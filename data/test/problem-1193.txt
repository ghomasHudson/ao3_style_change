He ran both hands through his blond hair, trying to steady his breathing.  “Would you mind scanning it for us, Auror Potter?” he asked politely.  Ron rolled his eyes.
“Eat. Before you get dramatic,” she retorted. “You didn’t have breakfast before I got here, did you?”
“You were only asleep for a few minutes,” he interjected.  “But when they wake up and find you gone, it won’t be pretty.”
“No, his broom handling is sloppy and his technique lacking,” Falk stated dryly.

“Oh, thank Merlin.”  He wiped a trace sheen of panic sweat from his upper lip.  “So this,” he gestured vaguely to the room, “was for a 1% chance and a day late?”
Draco whispers against Harry’s temple, “You like it when I take what I want…”
From “Writings in Exile”
“I don’t give a shit if they do! Maybe Shacklebolt'll make you change your fucking procedures if they win. Four hours!
With an approving nod, she resumed lifting her t-shirt, first baring her stomach, then clasping the fabric over her breasts.  Turning at the waist, she showed him her back while she popped her head through, and hugged the shirt to her chest.
He showed no indication of moving any time soon, and his hands had started a slow, lulling stroking pattern up and down her back.
. Illogical, entirely. But it was near the townhouse in Paris. Debussy began study there when he was ten or eleven. Narcissa and I were at the townhouse on my eleventh birthday, and I got the letter from Hogwarts, instead.”
She smiled wanly.  “Better not just be you by your lonesome.”
Her other hand circled his hardening length and his breath caught, indecision freezing him between thrusting up into her grip or down onto her fingers.  She made the decision for him, stroking down his shaft as she thrust her fingers inside, pinning and releasing him repeatedly.
Hermione’s heart sank.  She could just make do with Muggle men again. It had been… serviceable.  She’d gotten rather good at casting wandless contraception charms without men noticing.  It would have been wonderful to not have to worry about hiding the charms, and her wand, and all the other little things.
The room is stifling, and the tile is hot through his shirt, and Draco’s magic bites along his arms, and again, he feels trapped and helpless and it makes him

“Don’t bother. And don’t try to tell me you’re sorry.” He turned and took the plate out of the microwave. “You said you were sorry so many goddamn times it’s lost all meaning.”
*********************************
“Dinner here tonight?” Ron hollered above the flush of the toilet.
“Holy shit,” Harry repeats. The back of his head rests against Draco’s shoulder, and he sighs. “That was…”
All of them come here for a quick, easy fuck. No complications. No chit-chat. No bloody soulmate marks.
He lifted his arm and slid it under Draco’s head, bringing his cheek onto Harry’s chest.  Harry’s thumb wiped a tear from the bridge of Draco’s nose as he sniffed and shook his head.
“Oh, thank Godric!” Harry said, collapsing back down against the couch. “You all scared me there.”
Robards is on his third doughnut, judging by the impressive coating of crumbs down the front of his robes. Jensen, on the other hand, is buttoned down, buttoned up, and entirely too proper. His buttons are polished, and his black robes have been recently de-pilled. His honey-blond hair is gathered in a sleek ponytail at the nape of his neck. He’s tall and lean and clean-shaven and too calm, and needs a good ruffling.
Harry surveys the cutting board, then Draco’s exhilarated flush. “How about I chop the vegetables?”
The name started on his lips, hard and tight, and his tongue flicked forward in the middle of the name, and the end of it rolled into the back of his mouth like cigar smoke.
“We can talk about what the fuck’s going to happen when Narcissa is released in two weeks.”  The faint smile disappeared, and Draco’s face drooped.
“And you’re practically naked.”
The Griffin had awoken when the egg hit the floor, to which Ron had responded with screaming and preparing to meet his ancestors.  He had not ended up dying in a secret basement under a joke store, but if he had, his last thought would have been
“Do you love her, too?” He said it plainly enough, but his insecurity was thick.
Quintaped limbs flopped onto the floor in a gangly mess.  Bottles of blood shattered in front of Harry’s feet as he stood, shocked, hand still reaching for the door.  His hand dropped to his back pocket and his wand, and he turned slowly to Ron.

Pain shot down Hermione’s neck, and she felt a few hairs snap with the most recent yank.  Her breath hissed in through her teeth.  “Maybe a little more gentle?
"Oh," Draco said, watching the man resettle himself in the hard chair next to Draco's bed.
The teacup had a faint line of oil just below the rim.  A remnant from someone else’s drink that had gone cold and congealed.  A mismatched, out of place, soiled vessel.
Draco’s arm slides under Harry, around his back, and pulls him down, nose to nose with Draco. His lips are soft, like always, but slow, hesitant. Unsure against each other, teasing in a gentle chase between lips that have decades left to hurry.
Flourish & Blotts, 2021
A cough from the bedroom startled him, and he put the dildo back in the crate.  It fit nicely back into its place next to the other three.  But where was this “Bonus gift”?
, I’ve got you.
Harry stood awkwardly on the short white platform.  It had been the site of recurring nightmares through his early twenties.  Now, it just made him nervous and eager to leave.  Something in his eye made him blink rapidly while he situated his glasses back in place.
A milk glass cake stand still sat on the counter inside, and he knew it had once held butter rum cupcakes that were better than sex. Probably. He remembered cupcakes and applesauce, but not sex, and it was rather disappointing.
It would take her a while to actually reach the door, and he didn’t intend to be cold any longer than he needed to.  And, truth be told, he wasn’t looking forward to finding out what had her knickers in such an epic twist that it could change her signature like that.
Ron and Hermione have friends in high places.
“Middle of London.”  Harry scrolled through messages, then tucked his mobile behind him and snuggled up around Ursella.
“Oh,” she squeaked.  “Uhm, sure.  I’ll just… wait for you to leave it on my desk?  Yeah.  Okay.  Uhm.  Bye.”
He sat back on his heels, more to hide his growing erection than to make space between them. Unfortunately, now he had a better view of her thighs, sex, and hips. Her shorts had worked up slightly into her cleft, and he was having immense trouble looking away.
He leaned back in his chair and prepared for launch as he licked the black powder from the last finger.  The galaxy unfurled above him like a woman sliding out of a silk robe.  Bloody beautiful.
he chanted under his breath as Draco’s hips were exposed, the geometric pattern of the black lace revealing stark lines and diamonds of pale skin.
Harry wasn’t “fine”.  Not by a long shot.  Harry was fighting an exhausted sexual combustion of his own making as he watched the hours creep by.  5:00 PM couldn’t come fast enough.  But he surely would.  Repeatedly.
—————————————
Harry stifled a laugh against Draco’s skin.  A soft tickle, little more than a sigh.  “I wasn’t sure she came.”
He reached for his Legilimancy and hesitated.  There were undoubtedly others here who would notice.  Boo.  Peasants and their pedantry, but very well.
With a gasp, Harry realized Draco was counting down to when he was going to use the Blood Magic bond.
Draco chuckled softly and held a hand out, palm raised, gesturing to his own cock.  “May I offer you this lovely seat,
He’d probably bought that person a ring that fit them perfectly and never said a word about his own being too tight. He seemed the type.
Whether or not they were actually watching the movie, he had no idea.  It didn’t matter, though.  Draco needed a nap, and Harry needed a minute.  Maybe an hour or two.
Flourish & Blotts, 2021
Sharp little splinters of want and coarse grains of contentment that could dissolve at any moment. All the more dangerous, because he was fairly sure he’d had and lost them before.
rings over.  Harry and Draco had been so damned happy.  They were too good together to be apart, but Harry didn’t seem to quite grasp that, obtuse twit that he was.
It seems akin to bliss.
“Flawless,” Harry whispers, lips skimming iridescent nacre in the smoke-filled restroom. “Fucking perfect.”
He turned and stalked toward Harry like a dark siren, gaze hot and lurid.  His steps and hips moved in perfect time with the faint beat of music starting up in the corner of the room.  Trim black trousers did little to hide a bulge growing in time with Harry’s.  Long legs strode through the crowd, and Harry’s breath shuddered as Falk’s memory of Malfoy straddling him surfaced.
Harry watched him mutter, eyes vacant.  Nothing he said was intelligible.  Most of it wasn’t even words, and it was all nothing short of terrifying.  He’d run out of nervous tears that morning, dry, burning eyes taking their place.
“I don’t feel well,” she whispered to the almost-dozing man next to her.  She rolled to her side to see if he was even awake.  His arm slid over to rest his hand on her hip, lightly skimming it up her waist to her rib cage.
“Uh…okay.” Hermione muttered.  “But I still think it’s excessive.  For the record.”
Ron rolled to one shoulder and took in the mess of his trousers and the blood that was just… everywhere.
“Liar,” Harry says. “Maybe do less coke if you’re going to pretend to be sober.”
Draco scoffs. “You’re a pervert, Pans.”
Annoyance flitted across his features.  “I know, Granger.  You’ve made it abundantly clear,” he said tersely.  “And I’ve made it just as clear that you

long.  Her parents and their relearned memories were superficial.  Their dinners together felt like rehearsals of long-ago plays.  All of her relationships in Perth had been equally one-dimensional.
Draco nodded to his creased sketch on Harry’s fridge.  He’d wondered how long it would take Harry to find it in his trench coat pocket.
Something hot and wet slicked across his lower back, and he yelped in surprise.  It trailed down one side of his ass, and over his hip while the hand kept its rhythm.
She looked up from the screen suddenly and turned her head toward the lifts.  With a curt wave, she trotted to meet someone opening the door.
“You should, uhm.” Harry’s voice falters as Draco’s teeth find his earlobe, and Harry’s pulse thuds in his groin. “You should still be able to cast. But without the overkill.”
“And she didn’t even wish me a happy birthday,” she added, breaking into jagged sobs again.
Malfoy scoffed.  “You’d have to be blind to not notice that orchard.  It’s a fucking masterpiece.”  Harry wasn’t sure if that was a crack about his vision, because he’d certainly never paid Ron’s orchard much mind.
How to tell a man that his father was going to be tried for several murders, not just the one? Draco had only ever asked that he find Liore, knowing it would be enough to put Lucius away for life. He hadn’t asked Harry to go send squads on a
.  At length.  Like an animal in captivity.  Goosebumps bristled along his arms at the thought.
“Uhm, family emergency,” she muttered to no one, in particular, as she zipped up her rucksack, hoisted it onto her shoulder, and slunk out of the classroom.
“Oh, Draco.” The man’s lips pressed against Draco’s neck. “Of course.”
********************************
Draco shrugged and turned back to the window.  “Eventually.”
A PA system clicks on in my throat.  “I love you,” the speaker in my mouth blurts.
Audrey’s voice thundered down the stairs.
Her head turned to scan the room, and he snatched the Christmas tree knickers out of the bag and slid the courtship guide into the front pocket.  Fair trade.
And Harry put them there. He put the wounds there, he put the scars there, and then, somehow, he caused the soulmate mark to do . . . this. He’d done this to the happy, successful, globe-trotting man in the pictures.

“Out with it, you jumpy, freckled fuck,” he groused, eyes not leaving the ledger under his hands.  “We’re not open yet.”
“Or, my personal least favorite, we can chit chat about our… whatever we’re doing.  Our not-dating,” Harry said, grimacing at his own poor explanation.  “You pick.”
A startled shout erupted from his chest as he surveyed the mess in his lap.  Opaque white splatters decorated his tan skin, and he struggled to put words to it.
All the refrains I’d hoped to sing…
Humming a short condescension, Draco pulled away and licked his lips.  “I warned you,
Harry’s continued silence made his chest flutter nervously.  Isn’t that just the way it goes, though, Draco thought.  Every joy burned to a crisp as soon as it’s tasted.  Someday, that would be how he knew he was dead.  If he woke up happy on three consecutive mornings, he couldn’t possibly be living the life of Draco Malfoy anymore.
Waiting too long, a haste to their hips.
Why would he dream of Rusalka children?  Of all damn things.
Neve turned to regard him out of the corner of her eye as she poured the kettle, eyebrow raised.  She smirked at his discomfort and turned away.
“Mm hm,” he repeated, offering her another piece from his bowl.
Harry’s pacing paused briefly to glance furtively in Draco’s direction.
Hermione yawned and stretched her arms high.  Through slitted eyes, she watched Draco’s gaze wander over her breasts, down her waist, and eventually back up to her face.  He always appreciated a woman in a suit.
The man’s name ended in the sharp vee of his hips, down to his soft, curving length against his thigh, spent and dozing. A corner of his lips twitched in his sleep. Someone outside tripped over a tent guy line, and the walls shivered. The man woke and rolled onto his stomach and scratched at a small, red tattoo on his arse.

“Me! A godfather!” Draco’s startled gaze flits to Harry. “I don’t know how to be someone’s godfather!”

“Yeah, you did, mate,” Ron said plaintively, wrapping his trapped arm around Harry.  Poor bloke was gonna have a second breakdown when he fully realized how big an asshat he’d been to a lot of decent men.
Ron released him and plucked a second scone from the plate.  “Taking one for Adams.”
“I’m an experienced wallower, I suppose.”  He sighed and laid his hand over hers.  “And you’ve spent too much time alone,

A blurry pink shape drifted down in front of him and derailed his anxious pondering.  It settled in front of him with a gentle tumble.
Ron broke first, and she felt him giggling against her back while he gripped her breasts.  Harry leaned forward, loud guffaws erupting from him, till one finally ended in a snort.  He wiped tears from his eyes.
The crashing reality made his knees weak, and he shakily made his way to the couch.
A low growl vibrated through his teeth, and she clutched the sheets, daring not to move.  Gently, he released her flesh, the flat of his tongue running over where his teeth had been.

Draco’s back is a pearl expanse that Harry’s lips need to feel to make sure it’s real. Sweat beads in the furrow of his spine, and it wets Harry’s lips as he kisses it away.

“Jace, round up the older staff and have them circle the building with that charm.  Tell the younger ones we’re working on a new spider illusion,” he instructed, shoving his way down the hall to the basement door.

There aren’t many entries in his records. A few visits for minor injuries. A sprained ankle while hiking last summer. An assessment after falling off a broom a few years ago. Travel immunisations. A gastrointestinal ailment picked up abroad and a note from a Healer, “Patient denies consumption of home-fermented foods but has mentioned cheese made from Siberian donkey milk twice.”

Multiple people had asked if he was on his way to see his brother or his father.  A woman in the lift asked if his mum had sent him with lunch for his dad, like he was some kind of domestic shut-in of a son.
kind of wards are these, Malfoy?!” Harry hollered.
“But the book said the ones in the middle were the theme!”
The impossibly fluffy duvet was heaped on the far side of the bed, which was probably good.  It looked too tempting.  And the whole room smelled like Malfoy plus the sweet, woodsy scent of this mattress, like some kind of small, delicate flowers in a mossy forest on a misty morning.
“But…” she trailed off and stared at her hands, a fine tremor starting.
The mental cadence that wouldn’t translate to pen nor harp returned, new instrument in his hands.  Harry keened a high, desperate note through his nose as Draco’s hands slicked over the head of his cock and pressed his prostate in a steady, building rhythm.
“Got it.”  Ron said, and turned for the Floo.
“How much?” The man stared at him until the mobile screen in his hand went dark.
Pansy huffed and slid her hands into the pockets of pinstriped trousers.  “Well, Granger.  What’s the emergency?  Knickers on fire?”
“First off, he pulled an infirmary’s worth of Blood Magic into my son who effectively killed himself doing... what was it again?”

did you auction yourself off to the Ministry for fifteen years?”
Shifting form, he stretched his shoulders, arms, and hands down to his fingers.  He groaned, already dreading the hours-long return flight.
———————————————
Harry locked his office door and leaned against it.  Draco assessed him quietly.  He’d used the hand holding the pastry bag, despite the fact that the other hand was empty.  That arm didn’t sway in counter-balance as it should when he walked.
Harry tested the bond expecting to find anger, but was flooded with overwhelming grief.  Tears shimmered in the corners of Malfoy’s eyes.  Harry frowned in confusion.
Draco took a long, shaky breath.  “Would you be demolishing Azkaban if you hadn’t seen its ruins in a dream?”
“God dammit!”  She flopped back on her cot and threw an arm over her face to hide an embarrassed blush.

A song in whimpers and pleas that lodged itself firmly in Draco’s throbbing erection.  His own hips pressed into the mattress, striking a teasing rhythm against the sheet.
“I expected to find you dead or having the wits cursed out of you.  Again,” he admitted quietly, finally saying it out loud.
Kissing his way back down to the back of her knee, he shook his head.  “Your lead.”
Ron and Harry were lovely, but they weren’t family.  Maybe they could have worked on becoming friends again first if she hadn’t sent Harry that stupid message.  If

He licked a finger, leaned back, and twirled in his office chair, the galaxy swirling above him.
“Just pull, Harry,” she encouraged.  With an unexpected pop, he suddenly held a slick golden egg in his hand.
“… so Ginny said come visit any time, but then she’s always got something going on and I don’t…”
Fuck, he knew what he’d seen in that dream.  This was his husband.  His husband riding his cock, desperate for his come inside him.
A scarlet blush crept up Janice’s cheeks as she mumbled her thanks and headed for the Floo.
She smiled and hummed in agreement and leaned forward to lift her hips off of Harry.  He slid down further on the couch to give her room.  Reaching underneath for his length, she rubbed the head of him along her slit, circling over her clit.  His breath hissed in and his hips gave an involuntary jerk.
Draco full-on grins, teeth glinting in the soft light. “About the same time you had to learn to open a beer with your hands. The magic-throttling charm in my ring wore off when Lucius went to Azkaban, and Mum didn’t have the wherewithal to keep it up.”
“You’re going to regret that,” she spat, climbing back onto the ledge, and back onto his lap.
Slytherin thing I’ve ever seen.”
She slid him deeper as Draco’s cock hit his prostate, and Harry's scream died with the tangle of his own tongue in a choking gasp.  “
Draco opened his mouth, but Harry spoke over him in an anxious rush.
She wasn’t opposed to having children. Intended to, actually. But she didn’t want her entire life to be nappies, snacks, and messes. The Ministry probably wouldn’t appreciate footing her expenses in Cardiff for her to run off and whelp a passel of adorable ginger miscreants. And they

Draco squinted, trying to see through the fogged shower door into the hall. He could have shut the bathroom door and locked it. He should have. A shadow crept down the hall, and it was too late to lock the door.
If he hadn’t just sicked up in the bin while preparing for this Wizengamot Committee on Wizard Rights meeting.  Lacking any other preparatory materials, he’d helped himself to Malfoy’s Pensieve vials all afternoon.
The keyhole shot sparks, and a thin stream of smoke rolled out, but the door remained shut.
Luckily, Harry was fairly gullible.  So Auror Potter really did think Ministry charms and uniforms needed to be kept in a well-heated room.  The lie had tasted bitter, but if he was ever going to get arrested for the contents of the basements, he’d rather it not be Harry who cuffed him.
They went back and forth, and Hermione started to regret texting a number out of the Quibbler, of all publications.  Free quibbling, delivered to the reader’s immediate location free of charge.

Less nonsensical than other passages, she thought.  She closed the book and rolled over, contemplating buying more pillows to snuggle up against.
“Uhm, yeah,” Draco muttered, settling the lid on his container.  “I asked how Muggles record video, and he told me I already had enough vices.  It was gone in the morning.”
,” he hissed, fist raised, opposite hand slapped on his bicep.
“Whoa, you got here fast, Potter!”  Janice hollered over the noise of the crowd in the hall.  She waved her hand, mobile screen a garish white streak through the clammy air.
“Do you feel like-” His eyes flitted up to Draco’s hard, come-streaked cock. “Oh, shit, sorry. You’re usually very fast, and...” Hazel green eyes watched Draco’s fingers move, and the man licked his lips. “And I knocked… And…”
————————————
“Pass that over,” Draco mutters, waggling fingers at the wine nestled in the sand next to Harry.  Far be it from Harry to judge whether sipping straight from the bottle is better manners than chugging it like a pint, but Draco makes it look proper.
,” Malfoy snapped again.  “Circe’s slit, man, keep your trousers on, at least.”
His gut dropped.  He’d wanted to leave as soon as he’d gotten Potter in the house.  Staying for tea and discussing his mother sounded like the absolute worst way to spend the wee hours of the morning.
Harry hummed as he chewed. “My new tent smelled like hot plastic for the first year, and it still gets a weird stink to it in the sun.”
“Didn’t think you’d object.” The man reached down to cup himself while his eyes roved down Draco’s body.
“Now, then. Do you plan on dying sooner or later?”
“Harry, stop rubbing your eyes,” Basilia snipped, squinting. “It’s just dusty in here or something.”
So either Granger was being held captive, tortured, and possibly killed by unhinged wizards, or she was in mortal danger from some other cause, and had exhausted literally every option available to her.
“Expecto Patronum,” she said firmly, circling her wand.
It was a nice finger, Harry thought, shoulders catching the beat of the music again.   It probably tasted nice, he imagined, leaning his head back, letting it sway.  Maybe he’d get to taste it when they got home.  Taste it, and lick it, and beg Malfoy to shove it up his-
The man ignored Draco the rest of the morning. Or, at least, it felt like being ignored. A DMLE guide to roles and ranks hung from Draco’s fingertips, skimming over the carpet as he lay on the couch.
Godric, he’d seen Malfoy like that more times than he could count.  Usually at the other end of a quivering wand.  Hot guilt laced through him remembering the scars across Malfoy’s abdomen.
The hours he’d spent filtering through her uni memories had been… endearing.  She was the same swotty girl she’d been as a child, but with the maturity and passion of a grown woman.  And her ability to link philosophical discourse to archeology in obscure, tangential ways made his cock throb.

Waking with a start, but not sure she’d actually been asleep, she looked at the clock in his room.  “Harry, didn’t you have to be somewhere an hour ago?”
Fresh towel and mug of tea in hand, he made for the hall bath and the rather nice shower there-in.  The door was ajar, but barely.  He nudged the door open, but it hit something dense.  Something covered in fabric.  Something heavy.
Draco whispered as he tucked the duvet up under his chin and settled in.  “I love you.”
Draco ducked behind the sofa, fingers in his ears.  Again.
I can’t form the words, even if dignity let me.  My cock is already leaking in his fist.
Actually, he thought, rubbing one out didn’t sound all that appealing, either.  If he physically could.  His balls were beyond spent.
“Please,” Molly beseeched, “and save half the carrots for muffins after they’re cut.”
She froze, momentarily taken aback by his words, before swallowing loudly.  Slowly, she licked her lips, dissecting his tone.  He had offered it as a suggestion, not a judgement.
Hermione and Harry and their movies.  Hermione and Harry and their concerts.  And their Brazilian steakhouse fetish.  And their penchant for PEZ dispensers and Power Rangers and a slew of other things that sound kinky but are absolutely barmy.  But I'd fuck the Green Ranger.  We'd all fuck the Green Ranger.  Let us all, in our heart of hearts, take a moment... and fuck the Green Ranger.  Fuck him good.  Yeah.  That's right.
“Uhm… Quidditch… something.  And etiquette…something.”
“Oh,” Harry muttered, silky strands sifting between his fingers.  “You seemed kind of… I don’t know.  Jittery, I guess.  This morning.  I thought maybe it was about this.”
“Am I wrong?” he whispered, sliding his fingers from her clit back down to the hot, swollen lips of her core.
Ron’s question from weeks ago about what happens when a Seer bleeds on a hearth rug came back to him.  Maybe that was what happened?  Would the Black rug turn into… that?  And when?  That hearth looked positively ancient.  But still lit.
I can’t, she panted,
“Huh,” he said, noncommittally.  This meant Ron could pick up Blood Magic if he wanted to.  And Ron would absolutely want to.

“This earring and the one going in your… left…” He watches Kate pull away and wheel her stool and tray to Harry’s other side. “This one and the one currently in your left ear are the receivers. The one going in your right ear is a speaker. It’ll send sound from the other two to your good ear.”
“Hermione.  Wake up.”
Draco took his towel from him and handed him his glasses.  The blur coalesced into jeans and the Cannons sweatshirt.
He shut the book and pressed thumbs to his eyes, but instead of darkness, images of students,
She hummed happily, lips against his neck.  “Probably.  That implies that sometimes all four of us… don’t?”
These were all Muggle baseball cards, which seemed like an inherently bad choice for not being attractive to Muggles.  Especially children.  If a Muggleborn child with any ability picked these up, there’d be no end to the chaos.
He dropped his hand and watched Malfoy turn around as the Chief Warlock cleared his throat.  The crowd had gotten a little carried away in greetings and catching up.  Bit of a who’s who in the Wizarding world.  Except for the antisocial woman in front of him playing a game on her phone.
The socks were as perfect as they looked, and he’d have been happy without another stitch of clothing, but his goosebumps disagreed. He popped his head through the t-shirt and wrestled damp arms into the sleeves. The joggers went on more easily.
The Azkaban guards this morning were both witches, and curiosity was going to get the better of him.  If he could think of a tasteful way to ask “Why are you both women?”
“Sorry, ‘Mione.  Sworn to secrecy and stuff.  You can ask them.  I gotta go.  Godric, I’m so late,” he muttered, followed by a loud pop of Apparition.
Other women could walk right up to Harry Potter and invite him to bed.  They didn’t have to explain why they’d disappeared for nine years, never visited, and not even responded to the damn ginger cat pictures.
Draco nodded and pressed the heels of his hands into the muscles just above Harry’s kneecaps.  A surprised grunt followed by a low groan escaped Harry as the muscles twitched and relaxed as his palms slid higher.  It was a painful kind of good, but damned if it didn’t hurt.  And damned if it didn’t make his cock twitch, too. “Fuck…” he hissed.
“Nah,” he groaned, hoisting himself up.  “You really shouldn’t be Apparating into a Muggle building in the middle of the night.  And it’s kind of a leap from Cardiff to Wheeze’s in the morning, what with you not having a Floo.”
Her mug refilled, she sat at the table to think.  Everything she’d done today had been interrupted by visceral memories.  She’d barely disguised a soft moan as a cough during a lecture.  But Godric, they’d been amazing, with Harry below her and Ron in front, and their hands run-
thrusts into him.
His brow smoothed, and he nodded, skimming his hands up her thighs.  She’d taken him like this easily enough last time, but her request for rougher sex still worried him.
She swallowed demonstrably and dried her hands on her t-shirt.  Her jeans were somewhere in the living room, and she was glad she’d packed a handful of knickers.
His hand groped around for his glasses and came up empty.  “
“My chew toy for your stick.”
For the eighth time that day, he considered running away to chase dragons with his feckless brothers.  It would serve them right for shoving the store off on him after they got bored with it.
*********************************
A deep moan poured out of him as she drove her fingers in deep, the rest of her fist grinding against his skin.  The urge to move with her broke through with the added touch, and his hips swiveled to meet her.
“Uhm, sure.” Harry stays seated, erection hidden under the table.
“Bye, Ronnikins,” she said with a sniffle.
An arm tightened around his waist and tugged the borrowed joggers tight over his groin. He bit his lip, careful of the cut, and let it slide out from his teeth as he felt his cock swell against the fabric.
Don’t lose your song.
“So, sometime… late ’98?  That year is a bit of a blur.  But it was cold, even for Russia.  And my scrawny 18 year-old self is full of vodka and pills while sitting naked on a 25 year-old Quidditch coach’s lap at a party.  And in walks this handsy Greek son of a bitch.  And starts talking to me like we’re old friends.”
Shocked, Draco’s walls briefly fell.  How could Magnus be satisfied with a dowdy husband he only saw a few times a month?  It made no fucking sense.  Magnus was an absolute deity in the bedroom, and he was married to…
They don’t.
Arching her lower back in offering, he growled low and pinned her chest to the mattress with his forearms.  Her hands reached behind her head to touch him, and he caught her wrists, trapping them.
Hermione sighed and wandered out.  The inebriated man-boy didn’t follow her, thankfully.  A chill ran up her arms in the outside air.  Not cool enough yet to raise goosebumps, but enough that she was aware of the light sheen of sweat from the heat of the party.
Burgock had been watching Harry's disrobing with an open snigger.  His gaze was glued to the rather impressive tent in Harry's trousers, but Harry didn't feel the need to care about it.
And the source was easing its towering, tragically underdressed self between wooden benches to sit between a silver fox of a woman with a press pass and an absolutely jubilant old man dressed like an Arthur Weasley impersonator.
—————————————-
Hermione’s eyelids fluttered against his neck, and he tilted her head back to watch her eyes open. Tears welled in the outer corners of her lids as gold-flecked brown eyes found his.
A gentle hand gripped Harry’s wrist, stopping his movement along Draco’s cock.  Not Draco’s hand.  Harry released him, and wiped the hand down his spit-slick chin before looking up from Draco’s ass.
“We wouldn’t want to sully this lovely rug, hm?” Draco says, listless. His gaze wanders down Harry’s chest, and his tongue darts out to wet his lips. “I’ll be very, very neat.”
“Without breaking confidentiality…” Grey eyes scan him below thick lashes. “I do believe that the Granger-Weasley children would make good use of the funds.”
Slippin’ down from heights scholastic
“Shall I be mother?” he offered, winking and pouring her cup.
“Yup,” he agreed, scratching his beard.
She was speaking to this Belinda woman, but she was looking at Harry.  He had no clue what she meant, but he’d learned well enough to trust her for on-the-fly decisions.
A soft whine filled the space, and she examined the man before her.  Her… Draco.  The tipsy women who’d named themselves the Plaited Posse had used many names.  Husbands, partners, lovers.  None of them felt right.
“Thank you for sparing the upholstery,
Ron’s shoulder was solid under his cheek, and an embarrassingly deep sigh escaped Draco’s chest.  “From what I can tell, the only thing you do with babies is talk to them and make sure they don’t die,” Ron muttered.  “They don’t get fun till they can talk back.”
“Pictures.  On his mobile.  Like you took of me.  And of a certain cock, once upon a time.”
Harry wouldn’t go after a man Malfoy still carried an obvious torch for, would he?  But had it been obvious to Harry?  The way Malfoy talked about Falk in the car that morning made it obvious to

Scarlet robes catch the light in the hall from the cell next door, and his magic runs a slick, wet swath down my hip to my groin.  The shallowest of the cuts, but the deepest of the wounds, because I could maybe ignore the others.

arena,” he sneered, punctuating the statement by sliding his hand up Falk’s chest.
“Between those vials and what Magnus dumped in your head, I guess you probably don’t have much left to learn,” he murmured, blowing a breath out.
The potion had only ever smelled like sex to him.  Sweat and bodily fluids.  It did occasionally smell more masculine versus feminine on certain days.  But he’d forgotten how strongly some people react to it.  Potter was apparently one of them.

“Okay, first off, that film has nothing to do with being a godfather. Nothing at all. It’s just a story. Second, being a godfather is the easiest job there is.”

“Maybe,” Draco drawled, licking his lips.
“Oh,” Harry murmured, his turn for vacant responses.  Draco understood the Muggle terminology in the message on his mobile, then.
clues were in a small safe under the bed. He’d expected to find a handgun, or wads of money, or important documents.
The shadow over Harry floated away as Draco walked toward the house.  Voices from the party drifted out of the open door, and he listened to Hermione as he dozed off.
Molly Weasley serves up cake and regret.
Draco swallowed past a lump in his throat.  Ron knew everything about the twins.  Granger knew about the dreams, at least.  How long till they told Potter, anyway?

Her mobile buzzed, and she checked it.
Green eyes watched him.  “Till

“Huh?”  Draco blinked at him.  “Yeah.  Uhm.  Excuse me.”
, Dray.”
“Fuck, yes,” Harry whispers, fighting down a whine. “Cast it and fuck me.”
Harry hoped his tired smile didn’t reach his eyes.  He knew damned well what these people were. The Aurors in the back of the room who’d been written up countless times.  The Wizengamot members who had soft spots for unrepentant, genocidal Death Eaters.  The bureaucrats whose only true loyalties were on a Quidditch field.
“Harder,” Draco whispered, moving his hands to the edge of the ledge in preparation.
“Half-mile radius.”  Malfoy had taken off his shoes to walk the sandy path.  If he left his guests and flew, he could be asleep in bed by the time they got to the entrance.  But, manners.  “Oh, and you won’t be able to use magic till you’re back outside.”
“Oh, no.  No,
“And, do you know what the cute Muggleborn from the train

Malfoy crossed his arms, mimicking Harry’s posture.  “So, just… drop it.  For both our sakes, just stop.  It doesn’t matter why.  I’m done.”
Draco scowled.  He didn’t want to use Blood Magic in the DMLE.  That sounded like a ferociously bad idea.
She groaned and thrust her hips back against his waiting fingers, driving them in deeper.  It wasn’t enough.  Hot threads of pleasure gathered, but she needed him to
“Is that even safe to-“
She grinned, and slid his head to her opening.  The tip fit easily, but getting the girth of his head took her hand easing one side, then the other, until the crown slid inside, passing the tight ring of muscle at her entrance.  Her whole core spasmed deliciously in response to the stretch, setting off a small orgasm.
Narcissa was grinning wickedly, and Lucius looked like he’d already had the piss whipped out of him, so he opted to sit next to the bedraggled blond man.  “Son,” Lucius grunted, oddly casual.
Gulping, and not sure the pufferfish was gone, Harry cautiously asked, “Do I want to know what a Bacchanalia is, Ron?”
“Dray, I really don’t think it’s a good idea.  I have no idea how long this will take.”
Harry takes another wary sip and lets his eyes drift over Draco’s bare skin. The cocktail is a sticky-sweet burn as he snort-laughs it up his nose.

Malfoy turned, striding to his pile of discarded clothing.  This room absolutely fucking reeked of sex now.  One of them, he assumed Weasley, had braided her hair.  And all three of them looked very happily rumpled.  Malfoy smirked.  Maybe this venture could be worth the trouble.
Draco whispered as his hips thrust down onto his fingers and back up to meet his hand.
With a dramatic sigh and roll of his eyes, he sauntered over to Percy and the fireplace.
“Granger, do you have a balcony?  Or roof access?”
It burned, though, he thought, that they would end up building the kind of life together that he could only dream of.  The kind that he’d only ever tasted.  But at least they’d be happy.
Startled by sudden illumination, he sat up, watching Molly walk into the kitchen through rapidly-blinking eyes.
“Prove it.”
Harry has a few reliable hook-ups who frequent this club. There's an older man who’s given Harry four different names, though Harry never asked to begin with. An Indian bloke who’s either a Healer or an Herbologist, based on the lingering smell of dittany on his skin. A Scottish chap he tries to avoid talking to, because he sounds too much like McGonagall.
“I want you to fuck me,” she said hoarsely. “From behind.”
“Council.  Woman.  Granger,” she said haughtily.
Falk looked away, relaxing a touch as he did.  Sensing an opportunity, Harry pursued the change in topic.  Thus far, he only had Weasley opinions, which were heavily biased in his favor.
Fully-clothed, Lou sat in the spray as his laughter faded into giggles.  Ron took the comb from Fleur and she sat heavily on the lid of the toilet, face in her hands.

No, really, Harry.  Use your whole cock.
“Mm hm,” she hummed.  “Gonna blow.”
“Hmm,” she mused, popping another piece in his mouth, his spreading smile contagious.  He looked like he was opening Christmas presents, not eating a late lunch in bed.  “What else am I missing about the eagle Animagus implications here?”
Malfoy’s gaze turned back to him, warm grey eyes churning back to a flinty glare.  “Prove me wrong.”
“It’s…” Draco trails off, eyes distant. His fingers open and close, fingertips rub together as he tests it.
“Hey, ‘Mione, can you see where the cat knocked my glasses?  And what does this bracelet say?”  He held his wrist up and waited.

The twin vaults creaked open, doors sliding away from each other.  The wall between the vaults was as thick as his shoulders.  Appropriate for Narcissa and Lucius to want such a barrier between themselves, he mused.
A dark silhouette with blond hair disappeared under a pile of men in red robes.
She didn’t know how to respond to that, but remorse and a certain tenderness filled her chest and tightened the corners of her mouth.
She drew two small sections of silky, golden rope out of her bag, a much longer silver rope, and a small white box with a red ribbon bow on top. A whiff of chocolate enticed him nearly as much as the promise of sex.
Harry could leave. He could stay at the bar. Or he could follow Malfoy. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s had sex in that lavatory. It’s not his preference, but it’s a quick answer to a too-big problem.
“Bloody hell.”  Hermione paused, wand poised.  Another sex talk from Molly wasn’t how she wanted to spend her morning tomorrow.  “Side-along to my flat?”
Draco, you're kind of happy!  Finally.
Another sharp jab from Ron lands just below his deltoid, driving straight to the bone, and he gasps silently and resolves to leave soon.
, let’s go home.”  Draco’s hand extended out to him, and he strode forward to take it.
“My parents haven’t told me they love me,” she murmured against his shoulder.  “Not since I Obliviated them.”
“Anyway, I just figured you might want to know.  I’m not particularly worried.  Your Azkaban infirmary files had similar info in them.”
“I mean, a lot can happen in eleven months and three days,” he said haltingly, “but at 5:00 on August 17th… Dinner?”   Harry dared to look up, wringing his numb hands.

He sighs, and exhausted flower petals skitter through my lungs.  “You’re jealous.”
Harry scoffed, looking up from the Head Auror application that had appeared earlier without warning.  Had it materialized because he’d used Robards’ Floo yesterday?  Or because he’d been taking over some of the more banal administrative duties since the man had left?

“Ohhh…” Harry exhaled, the connection dawning on him.
“And I’d say we were happy together, but obviously you weren’t.” The man threw the lump in the microwave, plastic and all, and started it. “So, ultimately, I don’t know what there is to tell.”

Harry positions his index finger over the blunt side of the blade, tip against the cutting board. Draco nods vigorously, hair bobbing as he concentrates on his pretend penmanship.
He blinked slowly, watching her settle.  Circe’s slit, it was an inviting position.
Peace asks a price.
I told them not to wrap your presents.  I really, truly did.
This had to be Ron’s doing.  Wand brandished, she opened the fridge door and whispered a barely-audible Vanishing spell.  The limbs just sat there.  Immune.
“They’re tight little swim pants.  Ron’s undergarments run high to tight and slick.”
Quietly, ever so quietly, he slid off the foot of the bed and padded into the kitchen to join his wife.
Cuz then you can’t take it back.
Hermione hoisted a shopping bag onto the counter, and began taking out cups, picking stickers off as best she could.
“No,” she grumbled, and turned her face up to him.  Hermione’s face.  Her chin, her nose, her brow, but his eyes.  “I want to go.  I want to go, and I want to ride that fucking-”

Malfoy brushed platinum blond hair back from his forehead and surveyed the room while he set the box on the table.  Draco’s gaze settled on Falk.  Harry’s eyes itched, but he resisted the urge to rub them.  At least he was getting better at knowing when it was Falk versus something in his eyes.

My voice box feels like it’s stuffed full of rice, and my appetite wavers as I peel plastic off of a tray.

Harry laid his head on his folded arm and closed his eyes. Draco did the same, a handful of cake between their chests.
He took the bait!
“Why the bloody hell did you buy it, then?”  Draco’s simmering pout had heated to a rolling boil.  His teasing grey eyes turned stormy, and he seemed to be pointedly avoiding Harry’s gaze.
“I think I am,” Ron said with a grin.  “I believe the Wizengamot has to do thorough background checks on new administrators.  Maybe even home inspections.”
He opened his mouth, but couldn’t think of anything to say.  She absolved him of his response by claiming his mouth in a slow, deep kiss that made him moan in surprised reassurance.
“Holy shit.”  He sat bolt upright and funneled what would have been a gasp in through his nose.  Draco stood next to the sink chopping an obscenely-large pile of onions, but he tilted an ear almost imperceptibly toward Harry.
Lucius stared at him while Narcissa let out a fake squeak of surprise.  Draco rolled his eyes at her theatrics.
“Oh…” he whispered.
Draco didn’t bother rubbing his eye.  He knew it wouldn’t help.  It was always faster to confront the source.
,” he said softly, eyes on the bobbing orange length as he tapped it.  “I’m not going to lie.  The last one was large.  This one is a bit intimidating.”
“But I’m not out of truffles,” he whined.  “Or Prophesies.”
The crystal balls squeaked as they rubbed against each other in his palm.  He may have left them in there a hell of a lot longer than he’d intended, but they were perfect.  Even if Draco said they were duds for Seers, they were still damned pretty.
“Mm hmm,” he hummed lazily.  He bundled the cat up higher onto his chest and threw an arm across his face.
He’s got come on his chin, but I’m not going to tell him.  It’s cute.
He looked down to assess his own bite mark, but the imprints were leaking ink down his finger.  Jet black rivulets streamed down his hand and plopped thickly on the tile between his legs.  He wiped the finger on his trousers and it left a silver streak.
So Harry and Granger, happy as a bee, f-u-c-k-i-n-g, fucking Ron and fucking me.
Harry stared at him, mouth agape.   Pretty little trout, Draco thought.
Malfoy:  You're used to shitty one-night stands, and that's sad.
“Please?” Luna whispered, fingers taking a firmer hold on his hair.
“But she’d love it!” Harry argued.
Hermione scowled.  “Poetic, Harry.”  She was grateful to him for breaking the tension, though.
“Fuck.”  Draco slid his pointed tongue into Harry’s hole again, and he shouted.  “I wanna come in your mouth, not my hand.”
He squeezed Harry’s hand and swallowed thickly.  This was Harry Potter.  Not the sadist who’d found him on a cliffside and lured him into human form.  This was the real Potter.  And the real Potter wanted to wash his dishes, not clean his fucking clock.
Pressing her teeth around the base of his cock, she pulled back enough to whisper, “The magnificent Harry Potter and his sticky shorts.”
“I-”  Hermione’s mouth hung open, shocked, then clapped shut.  “Huh.  Sorry.”

“Do you know where you want it, love?” She asked gently, watching him intently, ready to swoop in with another maternal embrace.

SMUT.
“What’s the difference?” asked Hermione, eager to learn more about alternatives to one of her most-used charms.
It had felt a bit off, anyway, appealing to one man using the memory of another.  Maybe the purpose of the casting and the memory worked better if linked.  Harry had needed a Patronus for protection, and used the memory of his parents, who had protected him.
Adams leaned against the opposite wall of file drawers, not in a hurry to go anywhere.  His stocky build always reminded him of Ron, but his carefully-coiffed brunette side-part made him look like a lecherous lounge singer.
She shrugged, hiding a smile.  “It’s been a while since he needed it.  Might as well clear up the space.”
A fork drifted toward him from the counter, lagging behind and taking entirely too long.  His finger swiped up a dab of chocolate and brought it to his mouth.
Draco unfolded the paper and scanned it with wide eyes.  Potter watched him read, glee writ across his face like a proper loon.
“No idea,
He’d put the onus on her to continue, and it disoriented her a bit. Telling men when to stop was familiar, but telling one when to proceed felt foreign.
, you do set a lovely-“ he gasped as Harry’s hand wrapped around the head of his cock, satin sliding against his skin.
“In the morning.” Harry yawned and snuggled in close. “It’ll come back.”
He clutched his hands to his naked chest in feigned modesty.  “Ms. Granger, I do believe you invited me here under false pretenses.”  He gestured to Crookshanks.  “I took my clothes off as instructed, and am enjoying this lovely pussy.”
“Weird?” Draco’s voice is scratchy, and he clears his throat. “Why is it weird?” His shoulders drop, and his frown turns into a pout as he sits up and straddles Harry’s hips. He’s entirely nude, and not entirely unaroused, by the look of it.
“Hmm.” Draco’s lips press into Harry’s hair, and he inhales, long and slow. The finger at his entrance presses lightly, and Harry shifts, trying to adjust for his swelling cock. “How long has it been?”
Molly set a mixing bowl and cake ingredients floating toward the counter, thinking about Narcissa.  They’d really been quite close until Narcissa’s second pregnancy.  But she could hardly talk to the boys about that.  She doubted even Draco knew.
“I’m far more concerned with the damage your snaggle-toothed mouth can do than your brother’s noodle-dick.”
Nostalgia and affection crept from him as she considered the myriad of questions on the tip of her tongue. “I am curious about the ‘spectacularly elaborate fuck’, as you put it. But only if you want to share. She’s… important to you, isn’t she?”
His ears popped, and he felt it in his molars right before his shoulder hit a mattress.
“Oh, Draco.” A second arm slid under his shoulder, and wrapped him in a tight embrace. “Shh… It’ll come back.”
Eyes blinking as if to clear dust, his gaze dropped back down to the room, and he licked the black powder from another finger.  The light of the furnaces snuffed out, leaving him in total darkness again.
“Behold! The product of a millennium of selective wizard breeding.” Draco’s chin tilts back, and he points a toe for effect. “Prone to catastrophic magical outbursts and sunburns the likes of which the Muggle world simply cannot comprehend.”

She opened her mouth to protest, and he crushed his mouth against her, tongue seeking, and lips catching hold of her clit.  Her hands clutched the sheets as she shuddered, knees drawing up, keeping him in place.
Draco stared at his hand for a moment, and Harry shifted, raising his own. With a sheepish smile, Draco slid his ring onto Harry’s finger.
The arm under Harry’s head turns, forearm wrapping around Harry’s shoulder, and Draco sighs into Harry’s hair again.  Draco’s free hand presses a firm line down Harry’s flank, and lingers over his hip before palming the flesh of his arse.
“Okay, but I’ve only read about it in books,” he said.
So, it begged the question of how she’d found out about it.  And why she’d used rather antiquated formulas.  She’d mentioned a book.  He only knew one person who’d suggest she learn finishing school skills from an outdated book.  And he had some impressive bookshelves in his cave.

The head of hair just below Harry’s chin smells like snow and popcorn. Gradually, Draco’s face turns away from the screen, and he melts into Harry. Draco is so still that Harry can hear his breath through the earrings. Draco’s chest rises and falls, slow and deep, as Harry eats his popcorn.

The tile is hot underfoot, but not enough to burn him as he approaches the shower, expecting to find Draco burned to a crisp, or knocked unconscious, or… languidly soaping up his backside.

He had great reasons to avoid Legilimency.  The last person in his head had been Voldemort.  The first person in his head had been Voldemort.  Suffice to say, those and none of the experiences in between had been pleasant, even the few that hadn’t been intrusive or painful.
Wallet, wand, pack of reds, lighter, cloak.
The casual familiarity knocked Harry off kilter.  Robards was a consummate professional, if nothing else.  It made him wonder what kind of shenanigans his supervisor had gotten up to when he was a young Auror.

She looked good, he thought as he waited for her to look up.  He wondered if her skirt was stretchy enough to pull it up and bend her over his desk.  Sharp brown eyes caught him staring and he inhaled an embarrassed yip.
A grunt from his not-husband drew his attention. “...still haven’t fixed this fucking deadbolt. Bloody building’s gone to shit.” The door opened with a sticky pop, and the man stepped inside. “Do the Kellehers still own this-”
Gods, he was in a shit mood.  Stopping by the mens’ loo had been a terrible fucking idea.  The hallway had absolutely reeked of teakwood, and he didn’t want to admit who he thought he’d see inside.

”  Draco bounced the pouch in his hand and smirked.
Out of the corner of his eye, Ron saw heads turning toward him, and a sudden hush in the restaurant.
That made no damned sense.  Harry couldn’t leave until Monday evening, and how on earth could he rough Draco up like this and just take off?  He set the basket of muffins on the table and took one out, walking it over to Draco, who was leaned against a bookcase.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Malfoy spat.  “The Ministry started an in-house fuckboy service?  Nice perk.”
But they had nice chicken, fresh tarragon, excellent mushrooms, and sweet, yellow carrots, so maybe they were just bad with fruit.  Even if the fruit Harry had bought looked rather good.  The fruit he had undoubtedly bruised in the process of lugging it all back to his flat.
“Yeah,” Harry whispers.
With a sniff, she realized Molly remembered her as a child more than her own parents, and her throat tightened, suppressing a pitiful whine.  Molly’s thumbs wiped under Hermione’s eyes gently and kissed the top of her head before standing.
Hermione and the Supreme Mugwump are sisters in righteous, red-tape arms.
Harry startled awake to a jolt of magic around his wrist, the sound of his own groan, a gratuitous slurp, and the most
He waited, waving, as the train chugged out of the station.  He waited, Draco in his arms, as all four chambers of his heart found their seats and disappeared down the tracks, a pull in his chest like taffy stretched to breaking.
“Well, which is it?  Yes or no?” Harry asked, rummaging through a drawer for Merlin knew what.  Definitely not a comb.
Lou collapsed onto the thick rug, giggling for all his little belly was worth.
Harry’s face dropped, and Draco wished he could cram the flippant comment up his own ass.  He ran a hand down his face in an attempt to squelch related imagery.
Compile the lives I’ve cost this world.
The gum is entirely too hard to be considered chewing gum, but it might make for amazing bubblegum.  The flavor’s nothing to brag about.  Spearmint and something floral.
“Granger,” he said with a sigh. “Every time I convince myself I like you for your tits and ass, you go and so something like that, and I just want to lick your brain till you come.”
Harry surveyed the table, three lovely gifts suction-cupped to the surface, and sighed.  Setting was important.  Mood.
“Mm-hm.  I think…”  Draco leaned over to rest his chin on the chair next to Harry’s face.  Sweat ran down Harry’s nose to drop between them.  “Maybe you were going to do this yourself.”
“Excellent!  I’ve already cried twice!”
“Can… can I ask you about your dream?” Harry said cautiously.
“You sick? Bit wobbly for a bloke on his first pint.”
He slid forward, straddling her hips, and her hands drifted down to cup him.
Setting the egg back on the ledge, he watched the imprints fill back in.  Interesting.  And unassuming.
Steam rises from the other side of the wall, drifts slowly upward, and condenses against the glass ceiling. The setting sun washes it in pink-orange light. Harry leans back against the counter, watching the potatoes in the pan soften as they cook, and he wonders what he could have done differently in kissing Draco.
“Ron,” she said, stopping him.  “You blasted out thousands of cubic yards under the shop.  In Diagon Alley?”

Flourish & Blotts, 2021
“Yes, but be sure to read it thoroughly,” she warned, tapping the file on the counter and handing it over.
She froze, his entire shaft fully seated inside her, and he waited for her reaction.  He expected her to move, but she just sat.  Faintly, he could feel the muscles near her opening erratically squeezing him.
Harry pocketed his phone and wondered if it had really been the best idea to poke Hermione right before a meeting.  Fun, though, he thought as he looked around the room.  He was in way too good a mood for the setting.
He froze, not knowing how to reply.  The memory of Malfoy’s threat of putting him in an early grave surfaced.
The chest against Harry’s back shakes as Draco chuckles, the vibration muffled by their shirts. “I do best what I do often, and I use those spells often. I may be a bit of a slut, but I’m a fastidious one.”
He could at least draw him a nice picture as payment.
His hands found the insides of Draco’s knees and nudged them apart. Draco’s hips fell against his own, and both pressed hard against each other. Harry’s breath hissed in, and Draco met his gaze, eyes wary.
For something so simple.  Draco swallowed past the welling tightness in his throat.
She wasn’t wrong about the risk of using his name.  It was how she’d ended up his unofficial Ministry liaison.
“Harry,
She opened her mouth to argue that she wasn’t his mate, but the current condition of his bedsheets could disprove that.  Her mouth snapped shut as he set the bowl in her naked lap.  A ball of rice, pile of sashimi, and shredded vegetables stared up at her.  At least he’d thrown a spoon into her bowl, she thought.  He’d apparently decided his own bowl was finger food.
The door swung open as Ron shouted, “Get down!”
“I… Yeah, sorry.” Basilia practically cowered.  “I didn’t know you were coming in early.”
Harry stared, stern-faced, toward the living room, avoiding Draco’s gaze.  Maybe it had been too much, the nickname.  Harry wasn’t wrong.  It was truly unflattering, to be called a lecherous glutton in bed.
Now that his tenure’s through.

he pleaded through gritted teeth. A whine escaped his throat.
“I’ve been going through your Pensieve vials for the Wizengamot meeting next week.”  Harry scrubbed his mouth with a napkin like he was trying to remove the day’s stubble from his chin.
“More” he crows.
”Fuck… fuck… fuck…”
the damp, and fuck this place.
Draco pauses, hands in Harry’s hair, and pulls away from the kiss to stick his nose in the air. “Something’s burning.”
Eyebrows raised in recognition, Harry watched Malfoy’s fingers experimentally pluck at the strings, launching into a few measures, then testing again.  It was nearly identical to the movements his fingers had made as he used Blood Magic on Ron.
to?”  Draco asked, a bit challenging, Harry thought.  As if he already knew the answer.
“And your French is terrible.
Draco clears his throat. “Should have known better than to surprise an Auror.”
“Do you want him or not, Blown Asses?” Draco spat, again aware that being on all fours with his head stuck through a Floo did not command respect. “Because I could always owl your mother and tell her you turned down an injured Griffin. I’m sure the board of her sanctuary would find that interesting.”
“I asked him to dinner when his parole is up,” Harry said, casting a glance at the Burrow excavation site.  “In August.  And he slammed the door in my face.  Literally.”
.  He could roam the entire Merlin-blasted planet for the first time in his damned life.  No Trace, no parents, no Ministry, no parole.
Lucius looked at her pointedly, daring her to acknowledge her own premarital hypocrisy.
Draco briefly considered crumpling to the floor like a disappointed toddler, but he was already lounging on a couch.  He allowed his will to live to crumple in his stead.
Ron scratched his beard and blew out a breath.  “I am open to suggestions, Harry.  Surely the Ministry has some kind of disposal protocol for magic-cancelling shit.”
He draws a short breath through his nose before parting his lips, but they’re… stuck. His tongue runs behind the seam of his lips, and it’s normal, but they won’t open, and his teeth won’t even part very far from each other.  Just enough to chew the gum.
Until hit happened again in early winter.  Yule, perhaps.  And this sliver was larger.  Nearly the diameter of a pencil.
Rounding the kitchen, bare feet dangling over the arm of an antique red velvet sofa greeted her.  She set her bag down on a kitchen chair and peeked over the edge.  He was really pulling out all the stops having her over.
“Alright.  Why didn’t you just let me have the six months of extra parole?  Why didn’t you let them send me to Azkaban so you could work on Liore’s investigation?  Just…
It didn’t have any magic embedded in it, but… it just felt threatening.  Auror instincts.
“No.” Draco sets the sweet potato on the counter and spins it. “Well, in part. The cottage was small to begin with. Tiny, really.”
Harry sighed.  He could do this.  He’d just had a finger up his butt, for Merlin’s sake.  And that had turned out to be fantastic.  The way to his heart may have been his stomach, and apparently the way to his head was up his ass.
A lazy grin spreads over Harry’s face as he steps out of the stall. “I’ll do you one better,” Harry says, finger pointed at Malfoy.
“I… uhm… we… table…” she stammered.
Folded in the bottom of the paper was a key, presumably to Draco’s flat. A wry smile tilted a corner of his mouth. One problem solved.
The self-appointed Wizengamot spokeswitch, Belinda, took up Codger’s podium.  Bold, Harry thought.  She had a similar bitter disposition, and reminded him of a professor whose only goal was making children hate learning.
, Harry thought.  It was difficult enough to keep his fucking hands to himself last time.  And he’d failed.  Spectacularly.

He started with a small rocking motion to his hips while he stroked, and groaned low and needy at the pressure on his prostate.  Such a small motion, but it made tension build so quickly already.

She watched Draco take a long swallow from the mug he’d painted for her so many years ago.  The cracks in the glaze made a spiderweb over it, and the chips in the rim were stained by over a decade’s worth of tea and coffee.
“You’re no fun, Harry,” she pouted, uncrossing and recrossing her legs slowly.

Draco swallowed another bite, and Harry realized he’d been staring off into space for several moments. “
and get a proper job?”
“About the ‘tart’.”  Malfoy bit his lip, but his smirk showed, anyway.
Harry rises from his stool, and a button on the front of his shirt snags on the edge of the workbench, pops off, and rolls away. He frowns down at the open gap in his shirt, but he hadn’t had many wardrobe options this morning. T-shirts and jeans are his usual workshop attire, but his shirts have been steadily disappearing from his hamper. Most likely a thieving house gnome.
“They’ve got a dead direwolf right in the middle of Hampstead Heath.  A female, and Adams says she’s got pups nearby, but they won’t come out for the Werewolf Squad.”
DMLE staff,” Hermione said.
“We’re a Dark Arts unit. We can’t function without a Medic. The day you didn’t show up for our assignment, three Aurors died.” The man sniffed and straightened his glasses. “I sat there with your pack and watched them die.”
“Potter, there’s no winning or losing with this.  It’s not Quidditch,” he’d cautioned.  ”All you can do here is find the moral high ground and defend it.  The rest is out of your control.”
He’d been letting his hair grow out, probably per Granger’s request, and it was getting back to its old rambunctious ways.  Draco secretly suspected Granger had made the request out of a desire to see someone else’s hair more unruly than her own.
Draco rolled his eyes.  Not concerned with having VIP access to the Malfoy Mental Maelstrom, then.
Draco grinned and released his hair. His hand tightened and his pace increased in anticipation.

Harry gulped loudly, screwed up his courage, and turned around to face the living room.  He’d expected Malfoy to be glaring at him during this weirdly candid monologue, but his hand moved quickly over the paper.  His left hand, Harry noticed.
It begged the question of if
“Hey, Percy,” he said, steadying his breathing.  Being around Weasleys sounded like an excellent distraction.
Draco’s eyes widened in terror at his words.  He was still cuffed and being held pressed against a wall by two Aurors with several guards nearby.  Harry was trying very hard to ignore how dangerously attractive Malfoy looked with his hands behind his back, shoved against a wall by several men.  He blinked and took a deep breath, shaking off the image of his black button-down shirt strained over his chest.
Harry bit back a nervous whimper as he turned to look through the crack at the mirror again. Long, elegant fingers delicately stroked an equally long, rosy-tipped cock. Fingertips only, still teasing a bit.

Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.

Harry grinned and huffed an amused breath.  “Tell me what you want.”  A soft moan followed his next stroke as he anticipated Draco’s words.
Draco gasped in mock shock.  “What have we here?  Oh, no.  It’s stuck.  Be a lamb, Harry, won’t you?”
Molly Weasley landed on the path near the short garden wall, a large potted plant hugged to her chest.  A rose bush, judging by the thorny, leafless branches.
“Merlin’s tits,” he swore, thinking more to himself.  “If Ron knew some decent healing spells, he wouldn’t have needed me.  And maybe wouldn’t have blown his leg off to begin with.”
Harry grinned, checked the time, and cleared off the table.  “Sounds good to me, but I know better than to fuck off on that couch again.”
Draco looked up carefully and nodded, embarrassed by his own reaction.  He hadn’t seen Auror robes in years, but they hadn’t lost their effect.
She licked her lips, drawing the bottom one under her teeth.  Her brown eyes practically glowed at the offer.  “I’ve never, uhm,” she stammered, “done that.”
*********************************
Hooded grey eyes catch his, but Malfoy looks so far gone that Harry’s not sure if he’s been recognised or not. He spins around on his stool and avoids looking at the mirror behind the bar.
The man’s gaze settled on the floor in front of Harry.  Basilia straightened and went back to her equipment.  Connie left him standing in the threshold to flick spells at the windows, levering them down.  A cool draft skittered through the room, and Harry shivered.
Having a good student almost made up for her preceding angry explosion.  He grinned, remembering her Legilimency skittering into him, feeling like feathers tickling behind his eye.  An odd sensation, but a very subtle one.  She’d do very well with it if she wanted to spy on people.  And she absolutely would.  Human minds were the ultimate Restricted Section.
Her mobile vibrated again, and she realized she hadn’t replied to the Ministry text.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake. Good night, Draco.” She rolls her eyes and makes for the door. Blaise follows her out with a wave.
“Mum, what’s burning?” Percy asked, tone pinched.  Pans clanged around the kitchen as he checked the stove.
“Unhelpful,” Harry mumbled to himself, watching Falk leave.  Unhelpful and rather fetching in a soaked t-shirt, Harry thought, as he made his way back to the Head Auror Floo.
His forehead rested on his forearm, and his other hand fumbled in his trousers. Malfoy was beautiful like this. Soft with sleep. Lips pink and pliable. His hair fanned out as though spread across a pillow.
“But aren’t you supposed to-“
“I see his penmanship hasn’t improved,” she quipped, deftly cutting the box open.
“Shh…” The man’s thumb stroked along Draco’s cheek. “Get some sleep.”
“‘A bit much’ is kind of my thing,
Home by-”
Thud.
“I just wanted to apologize,” he said, barely above a whisper.  “Jacob was supposed to be minding the door, and he didn’t warn the rest of us you’d arrived.”
Showing up unannounced and empty-handed seemed in poor taste.  The courting guide recommended flowers, and gave a horrifically detailed guide to arranging them to convey your meaning.  Enough of the ones she wanted were fall-blooming, so she headed out to Bute Park.
She sniffed back tears and straightened her trousers.  His fingers reached out and adjusted her necklace; a strand of mismatched, iridescent pearls, ostentatious in their brazen imperfection.
————————————————
eyes are green or brown or blue as she hops down the stairs, black or brown or red curls bouncing, so long as her eyes narrow to slits when she laughs.  Her eyes could be any color and still reflect the stars.
Her head fell back, Harry’s leaking tip grazing her lips as she parted them. Her eyes drifted shut as she felt them move.  All of them.
Wide-eyed, Draco tried to glean emotion from Harry’s carefully neutral face. “No, I was living in feathers at the time.”
Draco’s lips brushed Harry’s cheek; breath hot and panting over his skin.  “Come for me.”
He set his teacup down to untie the bouquet.  “That’s adorable.  But incorrect.”  He tossed the ribbon on top of her head, and she glared at him.
“Stupid git,” Malfoy muttered, inspecting the index page of the book. “Nobody’s making babies, Weasley. Just helping with the… drive.”
She sighed and leaned her chest into him. “That felt like Sunday mornings when I was little.  I used to crawl into my parents’ bed and they’d tell stories and read books till we got hungry.  Then we’d make pancakes.  They don’t remember it, but I do.”

He was vaguely aware that he was panting swear words as Pansy’s mouth found his, delving into a deep kiss.  Moaning, he sighed and kissed her back.

“You don’t trust me alone with him,” Draco accused, tone deceptively light for as heavy as his heart felt.
“Yeah. It was my grandpa’s eighty-fifth birthday, too. All my aunts and uncles and cousins met at Grampa Jim’s ranch for the week. It’s just close enough to Lubbock to see the fireworks. My mom drove all the way to San Francisco to get the dogs and . . ." Jensen blows out a long breath. “Yeah, anyway. Sorry about that. Our Howlers at home are black.”
Hermione barked a laugh, Draco shouted something incomprehensible in French, the kettle whistled, and Harry thought his heart might explode right in his chest.  It was all too perfect.
Pulled from water, pulled from dream.
If Pansy Parkinson smirked any harder, her jaw was going to fall off and roll back into the Floo without her, Hermione thought.
Don’t lose your song.
His fingers dug into the bowl of powder on the mantle, finding a hardened mass.  With an annoyed turn of his lips, he broke off a chunk and crushed it between his palms.
“Oh, fuck me,” he whispered, grabbing the remaining section by the tail and making a dead sprint for the stairs and the furnaces.
It had been cowardly of him to not answer Harry in front of Granger.  The poor bastard had apparently worried about him shagging other men for a solid day.  And all night, by the look of it.
“Yep.  She wants to see us.  Tomorrow night.  At her flat in Cardiff.”  Harry fished a pen out of his pocket, jotted down the time and address, and tucked it in the front pocket of Ron’s shirt.
A used condom next to his hip mocked him, and Draco scoffed at himself.  Thinking about Magnus on the heels of bedding Harry was extraordinarily poor form.  Even for a Malfoy.
“I don’t want to go back,” he whispered.  Knowing it was futile to argue with her, he put the lid back on the box with its three remaining truffles.  They might be more appetizing later.

Draco cocked his head and examined him.  It wasn’t an unappealing perch.  He rose up off the yellow dildo, withdrawing it as his knees slid forward.  Harry’s forearm was about the right thickness.  And warm.  And he was strong enough to hold an enormous eagle.  It was actually rather appealing.
“Language!” Ron hollered, mouth full of carrot.  Molly rolled her eyes.
Draco huffed a bitter laugh and ran his thumbnail down the seam in the denim along his inner thigh.  “If the Ministry’s records included Durmstrang files, that should have concerned you immensely.”
every boost feels backward.
“Got up and walked away.”  Harry raised his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose, huffing out a long breath.  “But it doesn’t matter, Ron.  I can’t do anything about it for a year, anyway.  I told you what the Ministry policy is.”
Magnus Falk was… different, Harry concluded, blowing on a cup of coffee, watching him.  Not bad different.  But… odd.  And wholly
It would be okay, because Harry loved him.  Even if he didn’t say it.  Even if he never said it.
“I love you.”

His chest rose, stalled, shuddered, and sighed as he melted into the wood.  The sun
“That ain’t the half of it, but yeah, I know.”  Ron said with a laugh.  “Smuggling children would be new, but it would work.”
A firm yank down on his pajamas made him gasp.  The soft fabric fell down around his knees, a chill immediately following.
you know, mate?”  Ron asked, suspicious that Harry hadn’t fallen for some kind of scheme. “You sure it’s not another stalker?  Or that that thing hasn’t been chopped?”
?! There’s more than one?!”
URSELLA, DON’T BURN THAT CHAIR!
But she’s so
The gum softens enough that his molars can finally sink into it a bit, and the flavor changes to a strong artificial grape bit of nonsense.
“Uhm, later?”
Malfoy sighed.  He’d been dreading this topic since their dinner at Hermione’s.
“Show me.”  It fluttered to cling to the wire door of another cage, where an equally tattered barn owl screeched inconsolably.  Draco swung the door open and offered her his other arm.  Her mate hopped off the cage and joined her as the door swung shut and latched.
Water cascades down his back, runs down his chest and hips, but slows… stops… and flows back
Fireplaces float by in the green flame miasma, and Harry wills his own to take shape. He’s not in a hurry, but his cock is, and unzipping during Floo travel sounds inherently dangerous to one’s bits.
———————————
“That’s the part you didn’t get,” she said.
“And you want me to come… in your ass…” he trailed off, letting her listen to him stroking himself.
*********************************
“Well, prepare to be disappointed,” he announced.   Her hands stopped moving and rested on his hips.
Harry dutifully spooned broth between his lips as Draco’s jaw clenched.  How much was even safe to tell Potter?  Was this man a friend or an Auror?
“Aww,” he cooed.  “Figures.  Put Granger in hot water and she gets all mushy.”  Those slick hands found his nipples and pinched.
She shrugged. “I played a Debussy piece for my last piano recital when I was a kid.”
Hermione gulped, “Records?”
The man’s vacant, dazed expression melted into soft horror that made Draco want to wrestle his question out of the air and put it on a leash. Husband? He’d presumed too much.
Harry was glad to have control over more than just his breathing in this form of Legilimency, and he relaxed into unpacking the images.  The next memory looked dark, and it gave him pause, but he opened it anyway.
a familiar voice heckles.
The bloody dough just absorbs all the flour Harry rolls it onto until it’s stuck to the counter itself, and Harry’s hands are gummed into it. Draco steps up behind him, merely observing, but his breath tickles Harry’s ear.
“What they lack in refinement, they make up for in eager gratitude.  An endearing kind of selfishness,
Harry’s stomach contents burn up his throat, and he swallows them back down. A bead of sweat trickles down from his temple to linger on his cheek, and he’s freezing cold and sweating to death.
He looked… cozy.  If one of the most dangerous people she knew could look cozy.  His hair was mussed.  Soft gray and black plaid pajama pants left everything to the imagination, but his thin black t-shirt cut a nice portrait.  The tufted red velvet against his platinum hair was rather lovely.
“Sorry.” Jensen wipes his forehead with his robe sleeve, and Harry briefly considers yanking it down to see Jensen’s mark. “Remind me again why we’re not using sound amplifiers or bugging the building or anything even remotely efficient?”
Harry peeked out from the edge of the fridge door, emerald eyes glinting.  “It’s in a frame on the back of the door of the
“C’mere.” Ron said, patting his shoulder.  Harry had already had a horrible day, and Ron felt guilty for ripping this wound open.
“Right.”  Draco’s body curls around him, and a thick duvet slides over them both.  Soft lips press behind Harry’s ear.  “Remind me to never underestimate your arse again.”
Harry scoffed.  “Like I’d carry it back empty.”
He gasped.  Light sparked off the blade.
"You love her."
“Luna,” Draco sighed, knowing damn well he’d told them this before.
“Also married.  Hufflepuffs marry entirely too young,” Pansy said matter-of-factly.  "Most of them, anyway."
“If it saves him, I don’t care what it is,” he decided.
The sunglasses shake as the door shuts, and Harry’s not sure if he exists outside of his reflection or not. A hand waves in front of him, severing his connection with his reflection, and his breath gasps in.
“Do eagles roost from sundown to sunrise?”  Harry asked, skirting around a theory and desperately trying to not imagine Draco in a little leather falconry hood, tricked into a nap by sudden darkness.
“Tit for tat, Granger,” Harry challenged.
Harry closed the door softly, redressed, and went to start another pot of tea.
Draco watched the rise and fall of the man’s side. He watched until his hair soaked his pillow. He watched until the man’s breathing evened out, slow and steady. He watched until his own eyes slid shut, certain in the knowledge that he’d watched this man’s back more times than he could count.
friends.  We’re not boys ignoring each other’s wanking in a dormitory.”
“And?”
"Where's my ring?"
It was a tossup, really, which would make him come first.  Would it be the tight, slick heat of Hermione’s pussy stroking up and down his own cock?  Or the lewd wet sounds of Draco’s cock thrusting into her eager mouth?  Both, probably.
“Fuckin’ hate chess,” he grumbled, inspecting the contents of his refrigerator.  “So, first five years, major DMLE policy overhaul.  Hermione’s already been drafting new regulations, because… she’s Granger.”
“Nah,” Harry shook his head.  ”Guys at school made so many jokes about it.  And a lot of the Aurors do, too.”
Flourish & Blotts, 2021
“Oh, you
Panic sweat soaked the armpits of his t-shirt, and he concentrated on steadying his wand as he walked to the table.
He could leave. Just like at the club. He could leave. He could turn around and go, and Draco wouldn’t follow him. But, just like at the club, he turns toward Draco.
The man’s chest shook with laughter, and Draco hid his grin in the man’s hand. “Did it?”
Harry hummed his agreement as the finger was replaced with Draco’s hard, slick length against his hole.  A soft whine escaped him as he stretched around Draco’s cock.  His hand found Draco’s hip and pulled him in faster, harder, than Draco had probably intended.  “
The sharpest teeth know
He shook his head and grunted.  “I thought about how I was going to make you come in my mouth tonight and drink you down while you moan my name.”
Huffing, she turned to him for more of an explanation, but noticed his sandwich.  “Not an egg salad fan?”
Ron gets a blowjob.
“I panicked.” The rope skimmed his chest, teasing a hardening nipple, before being drawn back.
“Oh, yeah, that makes-“  Harry’s mobile buzzed on the ledge above their heads, and a soft frown bloomed over his face.  “That makes sense.”  He rolled on his side to reach up and grope around for the mobile, and settled back down to scroll through messages.
The man seemed to stare at the floor for an hour before he answered. “I genuinely don’t know.”
A long breath through his nose did nothing to slow Draco’s pulse as he examined the row of buttons on the front of the building. The urge to turn on his heel and walk away was hard to ignore. His curiosity was winning out, though. She had certainly looked eager earlier. After he humiliated her. And after she’d slapped him.
Thorned vines and blood.  Was it a reference to his tattoo?  It didn’t have thorns.
“Did you hear that?”  Harry said with a wicked grin.
She sighed and relaxed her shoulders and chest down into the bed, hips still high.  It was a decadent feeling, she mused, to have so much of his come in her. The cat that got the cream, she thought, hiding a snorting laugh against the soft sheets.
With a grunt of sudden realization, he pulled his phone out.
Her parents had never hinted that they had any intention of moving back, but she thought about it every day.  Evenings like this one, dinner at her parents’ table sounded like a perfect refuge.
Her tongue pressed against the underside of his impossibly hard length, and he whimpered, knowing he wouldn’t last much longer.  A soft shudder escaped him, and he buried his face in the white leather.

“I won’t tell anyone how badly you want to fuck him, if that’s what you’re worried about,” Falk stated, setting his fork down.  “I’m sure he already knows.”
“Ah, ah, Harpy,” Ron chided.

“Oh, that little weasel-“ Harry winces. “No offense.”
. The one, in particular, that worked best with her rope. The one he used to avoid sitting in, as if it couldn’t be bothered for such mundane tasks.
Aleksander approaches, shots of vodka in each hand. He glances around, doesn’t find Malfoy, shrugs, tosses back both shots, and walks out onto the floor. Harry counts exactly three beats before the man’s covered in sweaty bodies.
“Okay,” whispered Malfoy.  “When I say move, roll as far away as you can.”
Ron got hot and puts his beard to good use.  He also assembles furniture with sexy competence.
“You were my unit medic. My second-in-command.” He rolled over and put his back to Draco. “Get some sleep.”
He propped up on an elbow, reaching his fingers just a touch lower, pressing at her core.  A low groan leaked out between her clenched teeth.  “Please,” she whispered.
“Brilliant.”
Ron’s warm hands rested on her knees, propping them up and open with her feet flat.  An embarrassed flush bloomed on her cheeks as Ron simply looked at her.  What must it look like to him?  To see her open and wet and ready, but with another man stretching her other hole open already?
Grains sifted from his fist to land on the floor.  The only Floo he’d stepped into years was in the Azkaban lobby, which always spat him out in a public Floo.  Having his own access felt intrusively good, even if he ended up fielding calls for Granger.  It might be incredibly fun to be Hermione Granger’s secretary.
His cock was so hard, it edged on painful, and he was only lightly stroking it. Clear beads of fluid graced the tip, and he carefully spread them around.
What would he have done, standing there nearly naked?  What would
“I mean by the decorations!  Not the bedroom…activities,” he gushed.  “Shit.”
Bugger. Out on the pier, he was just a large bird at a distance. Up close to humans, he was very obviously an enormous winged apex predator and foreign species. He also couldn’t shift and walk over as a human. Anyone holding her hostage would recognize him immediately.
The mobile vibrated in his hand, and he looked down to see a small box with his name in it. He tapped it, figuring it must have something to do with him. A different window opened, and he read the message from Harry.
Hermione grumbled and looked over at Harry’s bedroom clock.
Draco lay on his back and snapped the skirt wide, draping it over himself in invitation.  It was an enormous piece of fabric, Harry thought.  Practically a tablecloth.  Harry inhaled deeply and swallowed a sudden rush of saliva.
Best to just cut to the chase.
“Being pigs led to the slaughter instead of children.” Falk ignored his gaze.
The Mandrake leaf was verdant in color and flavour both.  Bitter, and floral, and saliva-enducing while it filled his nose with the acrid tang of snapped green twigs.  He spent three days on his cot with his eyes shut, savoring the leaf and refusing the bland puree on his trays.
He was born for this,
“Honey, please.”  He’s not tall, but he can fill an eight-foot doorway.  “Not tonight.”
She let the dream pull her back into its flow.  His contentment was thick like bathwater.  It was so unlike the short turmoil of his wakefulness before and after the dream.  He felt… at peace.
Dozens, at least, in red-robed fear.
stop.  At all.  Ever again.
Harry waits for Draco to look away so he can sneak another glance at his cock. Just one more. But Draco’s gaze stays on Harry’s face.
Harry winces as the tea towel wipes his oversensitive cock, but relaxes back against Draco’s chest, listening to their breathing slow. Absently, he wishes they weren’t wearing shirts. He can feel Draco’s heart racing against his back, but bare skin would be better.
“I’ve nev-“

“Harry! It’s been hours!”  Ron exclaimed.
Gringotts couldn’t just
“-dramatic change of pace from your usual attire, Mr. Potter.”
He wrapped his arms around the head of blond hair, and rolled himself on top of Draco, pinning his upper arms, and catching his hips between Harry’s legs.  Auror hand-to-hand training wasn’t entirely useless.
He sighed heavily, lips pursed.  “Blood Magic plus DMLE plus Death Eater equals life sentence.  First concern.”  He held up a finger for emphasis.
Hermione rolled her eyes to the ceiling and blew out a breath.  “Sorry!  Muggles lied!  Okay, so what if the werewolf outranks me?”
Then again, he couldn’t see her spending months getting to know a bloke, wining, dining, and all that, if what she fancied was a simple shag.  She’d always been one to order off the menu straight away, not listen to the specials.
“Not really.”  Barely a whisper, eyes still trained on Harry.
As he slid into the robe, a loud vibration shook his nightstand.  Startled, he could have sworn the golden egg had come to life shaking and flashing.

Harry’s mug landed on the table with a touch too much force.  “Nothing.”
“I’ll fucking bet. But that’s why they let me reassign you. You were the best.”
“I told him about your bowl situation,” she said, stifling a grin.  “I don’t know why they can’t get wet.”
“Uhm… Sounds like a hell of a party,” Harry said, trying to sound casual.  “Actually, sounds a lot like what he does in the men’s loo on Friday nights.”
.  A daughter.  Did she look like him?  Act like him?
Wary, he weighed his options.  He couldn’t inspect this guest at the edge of the wards without waking Harry and dragging him along.  If the person did mean him harm, probably better to be confronted within leaping distance of the Floo and with both Harry and Hermione by his side.
Hermione slid up on the granite ledge, resting the nape of her neck on the edge.  The stone was warm, and rough, and a pleasant distraction from the pain in her abdomen.
A cocked eyebrow and slow, slow assessment of Draco’s body was the man’s first reply. His gaze lingered over his own t-shirt on Draco’s chest, down to his groin, and back up to rest on Draco’s bottom lip.
“Fuck it,” she mumbled.  It was worth trying.
Ron blew a breath out between pursed lips.  “Well, it started as hatching dragons for the reserve.”
He waited till she was clear of the windowsill before he took the crust out of his mouth and threw it back in the basket.  Damned pushy bird.
Quidditch, the straw that broke the Wizengamot’s back, Harry thought with a chuckle.
“Not as much as the fucking eagle you let loose in the flat.” The man sniffed back tears of laughter. “Oh, God. It shredded half your couch before you got the hood back on it. Fuck. I’d forgotten about that. You were so mad.”
Ron was

“But I have to-“
It was everything his performance wanking wasn’t.  When he was being watched, he was enticing and lewd.  Self-indulgent for the showmanship of it.
“I may have to frame them,” he chuckled, hooking his thumbs in the waistband and lifting his hips to slide them down to his thighs.  She took them the rest of the way, ending by stepping off the foot of the bed.
“We can’t get him to the house.”  Malfoy said, kneeling.  Blood soaked into his trousers without his notice.
I’d die to be asleep, not soaked in blood and piss.
Godric, it was almost too easy.  And
“Yeah.”
“How many bites did you take out of it?” he asked playfully.  He hoped he sounded playful, anyway.  It was hard to not put his arm around her waist, or lean over to smell her hair.  They wouldn’t face consequences if he did, but it would be a whole round of Prophet headlines neither of them wanted to deal with.
“Right.” Draco’s eyes flick back and forth between the potato in his hands and Harry’s expectant palm. “Lucky for me, Blaise is a dab hand at Blood Pacts. Not that we had many occasions to use them.”
, indeed, he thought, barely wrapping his fingers around its girth before hiding it under the packing material.
“But where?” gently intoned
Shacklebolt had seen fit to supervise this hearing himself, thankfully.  Codger had quit in a spectacularly public display of outrage, while Belinda had quietly resigned two weeks ago.  They seemed to be at an impasse for leadership, and she kept being asked to speak.  Gentle nudges into authority.
“Where’s she staying?”
“So greedy,” she chastised.  “One more Prophecy, and you can take the box back with you.”
“Good,” Harry blurted, shuddering at the thought of candy corn stuck to his teeth.  “Is it a food Ron and I like to eat?”
“Oh, no,” Ron replied, taking a bottle from him.  “Hermione tried her and at Floriography today.  That’s the renovated wreckage.  She made a right mess of it.”  He chuckled, thinking how horribly wrong she’d gotten it.
“Harder.”
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
“Yes?” Falk replied succinctly.

“Of course we want him, beast fucker. Circe, you’re such a bitch. I thought Harry would have fucked it out of you by now.” Basilia huffed and rolled her eyes, reaching across her immense desk for her mobile. “Cal and I can come get him tonight around sunset. Where?”
Draco drained the mug and set it down as he squared his feet and started to
The fox yips over his shoulder and keeps walking, but stops at a door. Gold-embossed letters adorn the frosted glass pane and shine in the dim hall, lit from inside the office.
Brown eyes studied his reaction.  The harsh light from the hallway glanced off high cheekbones and traced his full lips.
Malfoy’s jaw tensed at the slur. “That didn’t sound terribly respectful, Weasley.”
“Yeah, but people expect…” Harry trailed off, not really knowing how to finish that thought.

Two more signatures tapped against the ward, and he frowned. One was the stop-start skid of too-clean fingertips over glass, and the other felt like licking sun-warmed citrus peel. Both vaguely unpleasant interpretations of otherwise rather pleasing things. Fitting for the Onasis twins.
Smut.
“Oh, no.  No, no, no…” Malfoy drawled, gliding over.  Deft fingers plucked the egg from her hands.

“Mm hm,” he hummed, settling next to her with his own bowl, which appeared to entirely lack rice or vegetables.

“Noooo….” she moaned.  “You’re supposed to tell me to stay in bed.”
He unloads his pockets on the dresser and blocks my view of the jewelry box, and I want to reach through him like a ghost and snatch the box away.
Draco slid to the side of the bed, and the man helped him to his feet. They let hands and arms linger on each other's waists.

!”  Intrigued, he stepped aside and waved her in. She left her sandals next to the door, despite the coarseness of the stone floor, like she always did.
This chopping block feels quite bereft.
“Maybe next time, tell me what your normal procedures are, and don’t leave me with my ass hanging out at an active scene, huh?”
“Like, people, even people I’m close to, may know the facts about my life before Hogwarts,” Harry explained.  “But having me dump it all in vials and leaving them in someone’s office would drive me absolutely mad.”
“Don’t hide, doll,” Pansy whispered, as she gently tugged his hair to lay his cheek against the footstool.  She laid soft kisses across his forehead, kissing away the trail of an unexpected tear as it ran across the bridge of his nose.
Her hips bucked, and Harry nearly lost his grip on her.  Ron slowed, alternating between sucking and licking, letting her join him in a rhythm.  Sweet tension was building quickly, and she knew she was close to coming.  With just enough presence of mind, she realized she didn’t want to come without someone inside her.
The teeth behind my ear hurt, and I don’t give a fuck.
It didn’t hurt, which helped him relax.  But it didn’t feel good, either.  He drew in a deep breath and remembered Draco saying something similar about one of the dildos.
Nine years without snow.
If Potter crossed it, it would be something akin to a light Crucio with a touch of Dementor’s Kiss thrown in.  Truly unpleasant.  Just like Potter, harbinger of pain and misery.

And that was all.  Not promising.  The Floo was little more than a large woodstove with the front grate ripped off.
What he thought, but couldn’t manage to say out loud, was
“I love you,” he repeated unflinchingly, voice thick.
Connie’s throaty voice drifted round the corner, and Harry blinked tears from his eyes to look for her.  “Rowena’s rut, Harry, you’re still here?” she clucked, staring daggers at Basilia, who had the good sense to stay silent.
Ron frowned, wondering why she hadn’t sent him an owl or anything.  Granted, Harry was easier to contact, what with Muggle technology and all.  But still.  He hoped she knew he was a much better kisser now.  Quite good all around, if anyone cared to ask.  Nobody ever did.

A poke on the other side makes him turn back to Ron.
“I’ve underestimated you, Ronald Weasley,” she said with finality.
He hummed softly, head tilting back, his hands coming to rest in her hair as she slid him fully into the back of her mouth, pressing gently into her throat.  “Fuck, ‘Mione.”
Draco sighs and straightens, pulling away from Harry. His fingers slide down the crack of his arse as he turns around, as if he’s checking to make sure Harry didn’t fake an orgasm and leave him empty.
“Uhm, yeah.”
The article had a small picture of the Falmouth Stadium, and damned if it wasn’t the one he’d seen in the Hall of Prophecy.  So, one of the twins was going to be having private lessons with their uncle on a league Quidditch pitch.  Fucking Quidditch.
, Ron!”  Hermione shouted into his shoulder as her body tightened around his cock.  “
Jensen unbuttons a cuff and slides his fingers up the loosened sleeve, digging fingernails into his soulmate mark. He scratches it with a simultaneous wince and sigh, both pain and relief.
“Papa!”  Ursella’s giggle broke through her tears.
It vibrated again, and he lost the mental image.  “Potter,” he stated calmly.  “I am going to challenge that contraption to a diving contest if you don’t shut it the fuck up.”
good,” Draco purrs. “Take your shirt off.”
He hummed in agreement.  “It’s kind of their thing.  The drowning.  But Mag might be able to get them to an orphanage or something.”
“Good morning, bella Sella.”
The hand between his thighs had crept steadily up his backside, wiping up droplets of come on the way to his ass.
Pitiful wailing oozed down the staircase, and his head fell.  “Merlin, not again,” he sighed as he turned to trudge back up the stairs.
Black-clad shoulders rose and dropped in a heaving sigh.  Harry felt the other man’s fatigue and disdain at the interrogation.
“Let’s get some things and get out of the city, hm?”  Harry asked, rising from the table.
Unfortunately, he remembered
“Yeah, you did.  Loudly.  Full of Goblin party drugs.  With many expletives.  Naked.  In my room.  But here’s the thing, Captain Oblivious,” Ron chided.  “There’s a lot of gray area there, and don’t you suppose telling him is the better option?”
Draco grunts and holds Harry’s head to his chest, but his hips pause mid-shift, and he leans to the side, over the workbench. Harry pops his head out from under the jumper and immediately regrets it. The workshop is too bright, drafty, and cold by comparison.
He flipped the fluffy comforter back in invitation.  Suddenly aware of how chilly the room was, she scooted back in.
Flourish & Blotts, 2021
Draco mused to himself that she was rather attractive, at least when she wasn’t talking. Unabashedly sleeping in a park in what amounted to pajamas over lingerie was unexpectedly provocative. He leaned forward to examine the book. A treatise on the rights of children. Exceptionally dull, even for her.
“Gods, Harry,” he sighed.  “Fuck.  Just- I’m not proud of any of it.  Please, just-  Just keep that in mind?”  He swallowed thickly and looked up, slate eyes brimming with unshed tears.  “This is not a fairy tale,
“Some of it.”
“There’s a thought.”  Ron felt his eyebrows raise in interest.  That wasn’t a bad plan at all.  Godric knew what they did in there, but making friends with Unspeakables didn’t sound like a bad idea.  “Want to sneak some down with a note tomorrow, ‘Mione?”
“Wanker.”
And they hadn’t actually kissed other than the brief one Harry had delivered yesterday between

“Other way around.  She wasn’t going to make rent this month, because of the… everything,” Harry said, dismissively waving his hand like it could fill in the blank for him.
********************************
The thick slap of glossy paper on the table startled him, and it took a moment to comprehend that what he was seeing wasn’t a figment of his imagination.  Or a leftover visage from a wet dream.
*********************************
——————————
“Convenient,” Draco quipped with a nod.  “Why did you tell Ron to build a bloody owlery out next to the road, then?”
He pulled a dining chair up next to the sofa.  Malfoy looked up from his sketch.  Grey eyes drifted up Harry’s body with excruciating slowness.  Harry’s breath came fast under the other man’s scrutiny.
“Or magic knows magic,” he responded, rubbing his other hand over the design.  “Thank you, Molly.”
“Does that happen every time-“
At least John had earned the honor. Eight years in the field with one of the highest solve rates in the department. Another two years as a field supervisor. Six months as a Deputy Auror. A year offering to quit the force so they could be together. Two nights in Harry’s bed. Four weeks at St. Mungo’s. And now three years in the ground.
, he thought.  She was so close.  Only a few dozen yards away.
In other circumstances, Malfoy would have been alarmed at Potter’s willingness to kill his own pets, but the solidarity was much appreciated.  Few people outside well-trained Aurors could recognize the seriousness of those spells.  It was rather validating.
Not for the first time, he wished he and Draco had mobiles.  Or that Draco had a Floo.  Or that he could receive owls.  Basically, he wished Draco Malfoy didn’t live in a literal hole in the ground and was a real pain in the arse to contact.  Occasionally a pain in the arse, in general.
A soft grunt responded.  “I’m texting Pansy.  Want her to come over?”
It was incapacitating, the touching, but a little less with every casual affection.  And maybe he’d screw up his courage enough to reciprocate.
His lips grazed across Draco’s jaw, nipping their way to his neck.  Draco swallowed thickly and offered his neck to Harry.  “Move for me, Dray.”
"Oh."
Harry inspected the eagle and noted it was the same type as Malfoy, but smaller.  And it carried a message.  It chortled and bobbed when it saw him, holding out its foot.
Ron blew a raspberry between her breasts, got tugged up by the hair, and flopped down next to her.
… busied himself with his mobile, and Draco blinked back questions attempting to exit his body as tears.
“Literally nothing.”
“Done.”  Harry announced, a touch too jubilantly for Draco’s liking.  There weren’t many Aurors who would want this task.  Not if it didn’t involve taking out some frustrations on a Death Eater.
Malfoy and Burgock slowly turned to examine him, and Harry was suddenly aware of his hands on his bare nipples.  When had they done that?
“Language!” Audrey shouted, pretending to cover Lou’s ears.
“Six months,” she added.
And I'm a praise slut.

His fork tapped idly against his plate to the cadence.
“Do you need anything before I go?”
“You lectured me about it quite a bit that night with the wards.”  Harry leaned back and shot Draco a challenging glare.
that Papa tried to swim the Rhine.
McGonagall and Dumbledore had sent messages via Patronus.  Maybe she could do the same to reach Malfoy.  The possibility of solving an impossible problem excited her to no end.  Especially if it meant preserving her dignity by not going through Luna for an introduction.
The clatter and soft splash of Harry climbing up out of the spring caught his attention.
“Malfoy, you nosy mother fucker,” she hissed, seething as she sat up.  “Didn’t know you were a Legilimens.  Hell of a way to find out.”
“Fair enough.  Got a contract for AstraNox handed to me in the Atrium while I was looking for you two.”
“Malfoy?” she whispered.  His eyes were closed behind reading glasses.  Several small books rested on his chest, one had his thumb in it.
“So set one down,” Ron said, shaking his head.  “Plonker.”
“No, not your earlobe,” Draco whispers as they linger in the parlour doorway. “The little bit of cartilage in front of your ear canal.”
it.”  He shuddered at the memory.
“Bring it in.”
“I hadn’t expected dinner, but it smells wonderful.” He leaned down to kiss her cheeks in greeting, but his hands snuck around her waist and pulled her in. With a soft hum, she buried her face in his chest. Scents of teakwood mixed with browned butter and coffee made her breath shudder in.
“Hey,” Ron hissed, “bed Auror.”
“Playin’ games tonight, huh?”
A sharp nip on one side of her slit made her gasp.  She needed less pressure, and up, and center, and her hips moved to try to shift him, but he was undeterred.  He let go suddenly and left her wanting.  His teeth found purchase on the other side and made her squirm.
She snorted, re-reading the conversation and realizing she’d replied to Harry, not the Ministry.  It didn’t need correcting, though.  She switched over to the correct window.
“My hours are flexible.” Harry laid a light peck on Draco’s nose, careful to avoid the temptation of his lips. “You missed Ron, but he dropped off your things, and groceries. A lot of groceries. Said he’d be back in a bit.” Harry hesitated, and Draco watched him carefully. “And we got you something.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” she muttered.  She’d Scourgified her neighbor’s mail into dust.
Draco sauntered out from between the bookcases, hair mussed, a giggle restrained by his grinning lips between his teeth.  He cleared his throat and took a deep breath, but his cheeks stayed unusually pink.
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
“And they gettin’ to the tamale filling, throwin’ it up
It was the “
“He’s right, Har.  I did think about making him soup earlier.  It’s just hereditary.”  Ron ripped off an overly-large piece of naan and shoved it whole into Draco’s mouth.
But she was more worried what Harry would think of her for trying to contact Malfoy.  Maybe he’d become a fine upstanding citizen.  Maybe he’d come out the other end of the war reformed.  Maybe he was still an absolute twat and Death Eater, to boot.
Silver hoops glint, smearing into starbursts as tears well in his eyes, and he swallows past a lump in his throat. “Why three of them?”
The title feels impossible and inevitable. “No, I’m fine. I’m just . . . It must have been hard to be away from your husband most of the summer.”
It’s not a date, Harry reminds himself. They’re just two coworkers on their way to lay out under a fireworks display with a bottle of wine late at night. Definitely not a date.

“And the long story?” asked Harry, gaze intense again.
********************************
Alarmed at his abrupt formality, she stammered, “I… uhm, yeah.  Alright.”
Hermione nuzzled her face into his armpit as they lay entwined, denim against slick floral satin, on top of the duvet.  The Kneazle was a steady, strumming purr on his belly.
Smut.  Drarry smut.  Finally.  But barely.  And not again for several chapters because plot and character development reasons.
His breath huffed out in frustration, jaw tense.  “I hope I come all over that fucking skirt,” he hissed.
********************************
“Okay.” Ron croaked, not relaxing one bit.  Visions of Azkaban danced in his head.  Or worse.  What was the international equivalent?
Harry, you need to not let Malfoy's hot ex ram memories in your skull.
He opened the grate, letting it fall forward with a deep clang.  A plume of scorching night air burned his eyes as he groped in his back pocket for his wand.  It was pitch black inside the drum.
With a lurch and a crack, they were standing outside the Burrow in the dark.
Harry huffs a smirk in my vague general direction, because Harry Bloody Potter is many things, but a competent liar, he is not.

“Boeuf bourguignon,” he exhaled.
“The unicorn hair. We tried a dittany core to keep him from chewing on them.”
.  Oh,
benefit, well, that was downright thoughtful.
“Gods be damned, Granger,” he whispered.  “I’m coming along with the next one.”
“What if dreams and prophecy are only meant to influence the moment in which they’re interpreted?”
He rambled on as she followed him through the kitchen, giving Harry a cursory wave as he sat at the table, looking ready to rip his hair out over a pile of file folders.
“I…” he tried several times.  “I can’t…”
Her hand brushed over the sensitive tip of him again, and his hips jerked.
Ron tried and failed to hide his excitement.  Two Christmases ago, he’d realized it was the first year he hadn’t expected an owl from her.  He’d always wondered if he’d done something wrong.  Harry said she never messaged him back, so maybe it hadn’t been anything to do with Ron, but it had still bothered him for years.

“Did she bring her parents back with her?”
He wanders the space, even though he knows he shouldn’t. Draco’s desk has post from multiple ICW offices in several languages, envelopes from Muggle law firms, a package from MACUSA. In one corner sits a tidy pile of Polaroids, and Harry’s lips spread in a slow smile, even though his mark burns.

With a steadying breath, he removed his touch and stared at the crystal.  Still ominous, then.  Perhaps this crystal ball was more of a doom orb than anything. A crystalline Augury.
Ron plopped down on the end of the garden wall across the path opposite him.
Not the best solution, but a decent enough one.
“I’m sorry, ‘Mione.  You didn’t know.  Ron did.  Or should have.”  He stood in front of her, uneasy.  “Dinner?”
She whistled, lower this time, and he chuckled.
Draco froze mid-rise on one knee, hand on the sofa back, not meeting Harry’s gaze.
“Harry.”
Draco holds his hands out, palms up, and his eyes dart as he thinks. He flinches on Harry’s lap, and a surprised squeak comes from Draco, but he doesn’t appear injured. Harry smells something vaguely sweet, and familiar. There’s a shiny glint on Draco’s hands.
“Well, maybe you can follow his buyer and get some info out of him. I’ll Apparate this guy into the holding cells, call the lockdown team, and report to Robards.”
“Yeah, Jace?” he asked, sweeping the pile into the bin.  “What’s the commotion about?”
people don’t repay that man’s kindness by fucking his former teammates in his bed while he teaches eleven year-olds how to fly on a broom."
“Hm?” Draco’s breath shudders in.
Harry’s head whips to look at his mark. It’s barely there. Nothing but a faint grey line.
“Lovely invitations.  Something about scattering her family’s seeds to the wind herself, seeing how her son refused to plant them properly.  Pansy put hers in a scrapbook.”  His attempt at levity fell flat.
A firm swat on his arse made him jump.  The rolled up newspaper was familiar, but by Salazar, she was sneaky for her age.
, Draco asked, putting up shields to hide his reaction.  Their marriage was nothing like his relationship with Magnus.  It was so placid, and, if he were to be honest, rather boring.  They seemed like an old… married… couple.  Hm.
.  Out of the corner of his eye, Harry caught Connie nonchalantly lean into the aisle and flip her “Press” badge.  Shacklebolt frowned at her, but Harry sighed in relief.
“Huh,” Draco huffed, blinking rapidly.  “Yeah, it works.”
It was tedious, and allowed her mind to wander while her eyes skimmed.  The flowers in Cassandra’s hair were artificial, so their meaning would be sarcastic.  There was a white peony, baby’s breath, and violets.  If she wore that hairstyle, with the braid, into the Ministry, what would it mean?
Chocolate wafts from the bag, and his eyes linger on it for a moment.
“No, I don’t mean the case,” Ron said, sitting down at the edge of the ledge, surveying his work and choosing his words very, very carefully.  “I mean that it’s okay if you find him attractive.”
Draco hops off his lap, lube-covered hands still raised. His dick bobs in front of Harry like an offering. Tools clatter as he shoves Draco against the edge of the workbench and takes him in his mouth, fingers wrapped around his hips. Draco lets out a startled moan and leans his elbows back onto the workbench.
Astute, he had to give her that.  Or maybe Draco had told her about the bedrooms already.  Or she just knew him.  Sometimes, he thought she was a Seer herself.
A trickle of apprehension tightened her throat.  This whole plan could backfire so easily.  The Ministry internship was intended to be a full-time position… as was her law school coursework.
********************************
His hand reached for the handle of the fridge door, and Hermione watched Ron’s eyes widen as he went for his wand.  With a flick, the air pressure in the room dropped, bounced back, and shuddered.
“Harry.” Jensen’s face is right in front of him. “Go be with him.
His vision had barely returned before it faded again.
Her weight shifted uncertainly as the rough stone bit into her knees.  He slid his palms under them and she nodded.  Her weight eased onto his hands as she took his length.
“You could do something with atmospheric charms.”
Maybe they were just really going at it in there, and he was ignoring his wards?  Malfoy, pale but flushed, beneath Hermione.  A rush of blood flow through his hips accompanied that thought.
Harry stirred his bowl around, and Draco wondered which bits he was hunting for.  He hoped it was salmon.  Salmon were his favorite to catch.  It would be nice if their preferences coincided.
********************************
“Fuck, Harry,” he whispers, forehead against the stall. On the wall is carved a litany of men's phone numbers, but none of them matter. Prayers to dead gods. “I fucking love you.”
“Mm hm.”  Draco bit his bottom lip between his teeth as he watched an osprey try to steal a fish right out of the talons of a golden eagle.  “Reckless…”
Walking, dipping the knife in the pitcher, flicking it, whispering incantations, and starting the process over every few feet was mind-numbing but relaxing, and they fell into a groove.
“That’s not so-“
“Go fuck yourself, Granger,” he bit off.
“Hm,” she said, mentally shuffling through all the Wizengamot members she knew.  “Who’s on this committee?”
But somehow, I know it’s a girl.  She’s a girl, like a griffin is a bird; fearsome and beautiful, and conceived in love, no matter by whom.  And I’ll make sure she grows up in the cocoon her parents gave their childhoods to weave.
"We... always."
“Harry J. Potter,” he drawls, fingers tapping a lazy fanfare, “just the wizard I was hoping to see.”
“You’re not joking.”  Draco’s tongue unsticks audibly from the roof of his mouth, and his gaze is unblinking as he watches Harry’s fist move.  Harry shakes his head with a hesitant smile, and Draco draws in a long, steadying breath.  “Alright, then.”
The pitted stone steps were slick under his feet as he walked down through the bleachers to the field.  He was out of place here.  The stadium felt like a future that could have been, and maybe that was true.  Or perhaps none of this was ever meant for him.  Cheerful colors zipping around.  Spectators waving flags, despite the fact that it was only a practice.

With a sigh, he realized he was getting hard again, and the discomfort had faded.  His hips gave a subtle thrust, and she smiled, rubbing her cheek against his full length.
“Fuck, fuck… Oh,
A soft pop followed by unzipping made him wrap his hand around the outline of his erection, squeezing gently.  No doubt the knickers that accompanied this bra would be worth the wait.  Even if he was starting to worry how long he could physically wait.
Harry mumbled something about tea and rolled onto his back.  Draco grinned as his favorite morning companion waved a salute.
“Come in!” Ron hollered, assuming it was one of his brothers’ wives' friends or something.
“I shall endeavour to-“ Draco’s lips pause, still parted. “Oh, God,” he whispers.
Instead, he walked over to the cooler and tried to ignore Potter’s lips on the slick glass of the bottle rim.  The tip of his tongue licked a drop from the rim, and he sucked his bottom lip in as it withdrew.
A shaky breath shuddered from him as he planted a line of small kisses up her neck.

Malfoy looked like he was ready to change topics.  Hermione cleared her throat none too subtly, “Shall we?”
“No,” she chuckled.  “It’s just too dark.  And too quiet.”
“No? Not the kitchen? There was a gorgeous brunette laying next to the fireplace. Maybe I’ll just go back and suck-“
Anxiety and a certain amount of dread prickled down his arms as he weighed the gravity of Potter’s reforms.  Merlin Almighty, the horrors that could have been prevented.  And not just for the two of them.

Not for the first time, he wondered what Hagrid would think of this room.  Of him.  He felt a certain kinship with the fellow bearded bachelor, but it wasn’t flattering.  Was he becoming some macabre version of Hagrid?  The Krampus to his St. Nicholas?
That reminded him, if this coming Monday was the third of the month, Eira would hand him a bag of them.  Which meant he could splurge on making coffee tonight.  Which meant
Harry’s cock twitched as his shoulders shuddered.
Harry grunted as Hermione wiggled her hips, sensitivity setting in.  Her lips met his, followed by an unexpected, familiar, salty rush.  With a groan, he opened his mouth to her, tongue chasing the remnants Draco had left.
He laughed softly next to her ear.  “She kicked my ass in the classroom.  She kicked my ass in the halls.  She kicked my ass everywhere I went.  If she’d played Quidditch, she’d have kicked my ass at that, too.”
. Her finger ran across the keys as she relished the perfectly tuned notes.
Even Harry winced.  Malfoy sighed and relaxed into the seat, already defeated and too exhausted to argue.
She brushed the offer off with a wave.  “No, no, don’t be silly. I could use the help.”
A waitress walked by and winked at Harry.  “Finally got you into our

“Don’t leave me!” The name was so close, and maybe the man would stay if it tumbled out between too-fast breaths. “Please!”
Harry’s mobile buzzed, and Draco reached for it.  A better option than a

“Fine, fine.” Shacklebolt grumbled.  “The paperwork will be on your desk by the time you get there.  You know the stipulations.  Does the ICW have anything they’d like to blurt out, scream, or throw?”
She choked back a startled sob.  Her vision blurred as tears collected against her lashes. “Damn you, Ronald Weasley.”
Two soft grunts to the negative.  Shit.
Hermione surveyed the drooping October foliage around her with an adorable frown, and Ron was content to watch her for a bit. She seemed to be looking for something in particular. Probably brewing potions in her Muggle kitchen. She spotted something in the next section over and perked up.

“And Narcissa,” Falk continued, “but I blame her overall cuntishness.”
“What was that?  Five?” he asked, moderately impressed with himself.  She shrugged, attention never leaving his cock.  He winced as her hand ran over the over-sensitive head, and she dropped her hand to cup his sac.
Lives given up to haste.
How ever did we take so long?
"... with the memory loss team. Or sooner, if need be." He let out a long breath and leaned back in the chair, eyes scanning over seemingly endless paperwork. "I think we're good to leave, then."
“Okay, so chamomile; longing.  And the opposites of unchanging friendship and indifference?” she guessed.
Malfoy lifted the strap of his bag over his head, set it on the table, and eyed the carnations and carnage.  He poked around in the plants and eyed Ron warily.
“To what, Cal?”  Harry prompted as he tried to discreetly watch the black silhouette out of the corner of his eye.  If he could see Malfoy, so could Onasis, though.
I thrust into his hand, and push myself onto his tongue, but I want more.  So much more.  I want him inside me, and on top of me, and around me.  I want him to engulf me like a force of nature.  I want him to burn me down to the girders and kick the ashes.
“Your Trace went nuts, and the DMT told me you came here, so I came to-“
Draco’s quiet plea for her to stay with him their first night came back to her.
Flightless, housebound, and bored, bored, bored. Another deep sigh, another heart rate spike and drop, breath held at the bottom for the stillness.
“Yes…” Draco drawled. “They’re twins. I think Baz is married, so I don’t know what her last name-“
“Yeah,” Ron replied.  “Want me to get anything for you at the shoppes?”
Harry wraps a hand around Draco’s length and is rewarded with another of those guttural groans that makes his dick throb. Draco’s fingers creep down Harry’s shirt with deliberate slowness, and Harry lets out an impatient grunt.

He clutches me to his chest, pins my arms to my sides, and fucks me in a hard, thudding rhythm that makes his hair bounce against my cheek.  Desperate, begging whimpers fall from my lips, and I recoil at the sound of my own need.  A hot, rough hand claps over my mouth and holds my head to his shoulder.
What the fuck was he supposed to now?  He knew what he wanted to do, but that was…. Could he do that?

“Another word for ‘integral’?”  The terrier barked from the other room.

to fuck off, too.
The bracelet hummed gently and text scrolled at the same time Malfoy stepped out onto the path in front of Harry.
“Still just muffins and burnt daffodils,” Draco whispered.  “I think it’s broken.”
“Uhm, no.  Thanks,” Harry said thickly.
From “Writings in Exile”
The platform was unnervingly identical to the dream.  All four kids had run off to join a game of cards.  He glanced over, and Ursella popped up, spotted him, and ducked back down.  Exactly like the dream.  Exactly.
He twisted in mid-air and broke the fall with his face; blood blooming between his teeth like climbing roses. A shadow loomed over him, half-obscured by dancing silver spots.
Harry stirred, woke by Draco’s indignant huff at himself.  He yawned against Draco’s chest and arched his back, stretching to the point of a tight shiver of muscles.  His limbs settled back onto Draco with a content hum, and Draco’s heart sank.  He wasn’t worthy of this.
He pressed a button on the phone, making the screen go dark, and handed it back to Hermione with his compliments.
—————————
He watched the man roll out of bed and rummage through a wardrobe, tossing a t-shirt and joggers onto the bed. The sheets under Draco’s body clung to his skin as he reached for the clothes. The man came back with a pair of thick socks, and Draco felt all the more naked for how badly he wanted them.
“Honestly.
Narcissa and Lucius are both terrible humans.
And even if Draco had told him he
“No,” she mused, swirling her cup.  “But it’s a skill I’d value my son and perhaps grandchildren having.”
It would be fine, because Harry didn’t mean to do this, and maybe he could even fix it.
Hermione, should you trust Pansy and Luna's recommendations on men?
“Oh,” he murmured.  He stepped down next to her, arms running with goosebumps at the sudden chill.  “The stone would be beautiful covered in silver roses.”
She leaned forward and caught his lips against hers.  Hesitantly, he kissed her back.  He opened his mouth and gasped, accepting the wet rush she slid across his tongue.
“Well, it was three when I left the party to come here, only to be thrown on a floor and choked and . . ." Draco halts, mouth agape. “That was supposed to be a complaint, but it doesn’t sound like one.”
“I’m sorry.  I’m not used to.. this…” She trailed off, thumbs stroking along his upper arms.  “I usually get dressed and leave.”

“Why the adoption?” Ron asked, visibly working through the information.
Orange-hued light from the windows hit patches of the room, but left the bed in darkness.

“I was disappointed, to say the least. It’s really all I remember of that summer. There is… or at least was… a garden of mirrors next to the conservatory. I used to sneak off and bounce spells off the mirrors when Narcissa was… Narcissaing.”
DLM 2007 Truro
Draco ran his lips over the slick surface.  The shiny exterior showcased the rippling light show inside as he turned it in the air.  What would it feel like to have something so damned beautiful inside him?
“Just…” Draco frowned, “don’t let either of them touch your dick.”
He smiled warily. “Not red and gold.  Got kind of sick of those colors.”

“Do you want to know what he did that was worse than hiding in robes?” she asked lightly.
Projections lined themselves up in front of him, and dread crept in.  The next one showed flickers of red robes and fire again.
“Huh,” Ron huffed.  “Yeah, hand it over.  I didn’t know it was out already.  Oh, and let me know if you notice anything weird with the temperature in the store.  I’m airing out the downstairs storage.”
“Luna.” Pansy stated flatly.  “This does not look like an
No, not like that.
Rather than come straight to bed, Draco wandered to the crystal ball mounted in the wall.  Harry yawned loudly to announce his consciousness, but Draco ignored him.  He settled his fingertips against the glassy orb for a few seconds, shrugged, and slid into bed.
Vertigo in “yes” and “no”.
Alarm raced through Draco’s veins, hotter than the water running down his skin.
Hermione scrolled up to see what else was…
Draco’s chin digs into Harry’s shoulder. “If you add a little sugar and let it rise again, it might be worth eating.” Draco presses his lips into Harry’s shirt and sighs. “I’ll see you next Thursday.”
“I would say I’m sorry, Draco.”  She looked up at him, gold-flecked eyes intense.  “But I’m not.”
Harry paled.  It was the size of his hand.  That should have taken Ron’s leg off.
Epiphany on the morrow.
Perfect darkness?
“Draco?”
And he knows it.  He knows I’ll be waiting: hard, ready, burned out from the inside before he even sees me.
He threw a forearm over his eyes, figuring she didn’t want him staring at her while she got her bearings.  Her middle finger circled the puckered skin of his entrance and pressed lightly, earning her a light gasp from him.
Draco gasped softly and glanced toward the window.  Sure enough, eagles swooped and reeled in the distance, the day’s dying light glinting orange across white feathers.
They grinned and slowly made their way downstairs.
He’d had to look away several times, and this time Molly caught his eye while doing the same.  Neither of them needed to see Draco Malfoy drowned in a fountain again.  Bubbles floated up to meet a moonlit surface, and the mirror went black.
“Oh, big deal, disposing of a beast,” Draco said, nose wrinkled.  “What are you even going to do with the thing before it rots?”
Red robes marched toward the front of the room, and Harry wished he’d have dropped the bond with Malfoy.
Draco shook his head and stared at the man’s chest. Memories of red hair and rampant jealousy flowed, thick and warm through Draco’s mind.
Harry was now thoroughly confused.  “Why would I choose to tank my career on my own time, Ron?”
, the noises Harry had made this morning when she’d had her finger inside him.  He’d probably come entirely unspooled with Draco’s cock in his ass, and his own length buried inside her.
Just so we could say we waited?
He paused, an amused huff escaping his throat. He chewed his lower lip, thinking. Her intransigence and humor had put a dent in his anger. Guilt at his own lack of control churned his stomach.
His bracelet glared an angry red and scrolled
Scowling, Harry opened his eyes, letting the memory wait.  How many times had he seen Malfoy sneak out of the Great Hall, or away from assemblies and Quidditch games?  Dozens, at least.  He’d always assumed Malfoy was up to something, but maybe the poor bastard just didn’t like crowds?  Gods, that was enlightening as all hell.
Harry nodded and leaned back, reaching between them for Draco’s cock, grateful he was still hard after what was hopefully Harry Potter’s last round of
She peeked out from behind Ron.  “Harry, did you leave him alone?  Afterward?” she whispered, already knowing the answer.
covered in crumbs.  If she had to be imprisoned, at least it was turning out to be very educational.
I think… something… no one should hear.
Percy set a paper transcript of Malfoy’s Floo records on his desk.  Harry’s eyes scanned the column of dates and destinations with a frown.  The man went to Azkaban far too often.  At least once a week.
“I fucking
“Harry,” Ron encouraged.  “It really is fine.  And I’m not going to drop it.  Not this time.”
Pen still poised, he nudged his office door open to find a man in his chair.
Her hands slid back down to his cock, so lightly touching him, that he wondered if he was imagining it.
Hermione’s dismantled bouquet was still scattered over the table, and he arranged and rearranged pieces mindlessly like a word puzzle.  He still couldn’t believe she’d tried to teach herself.  He’d been a teenager by the time he could read them accurately.  It wasn’t an especially useful skill.  Not the kind of thing Hermione Granger would bother with.
————————————
Nodding, Harry turned to look at him.  “Yeah.  I liked it when we were all at Hermione’s flat.”  Harry bit his lip and continued.  “But whenever I’m alone with him, it just gets… I dunno.”
“August 17th, 2008,” Harry said softly, gathering his hands in front of his mouth to exhale into them.
He snorted a laugh into her shoulder, rising to look at her.  “That’s not what I meant.”
could carry a note tied to his leg.
He hoped his gulp wasn’t audible as his hand snuck inside his shorts to finally fully grip his length.  Heat built alarmingly fast inside him, and he loosened his hold.
Knowing what Harry and Draco were doing burned in her mind, a scorching meteorite of lust embedded and smoldering.  If she’d had a sleeping
“Uhm, I’m going to need clean clothes later, so… Sorry,” he said, as he began to unbutton his shirt.

“I’m awake,” Felix said, face still buried in the pillow in front of Ron.
“Betrothals?  In school?  Why was I so out of the loop?”  She sat up, worked into a solid huff.  “And why the hell would you and Ernie not be the talk of the Great Hall?”
He hadn’t gotten a chance to tell Ron about the whole loo party thing yet.  Ron would find it fascinating.  Hermione might, too.  If she were going tonight.
Draco sighed and swallowed down a quarter of his beer.  If he thought Ron had cared, he would have told him that a feather in the front of the bouquet was the proper way to denote orientation.  At least per De Pompadour rules.  He frowned, quietly hating that his brain was crammed full of such useless shit.
‘Twas a pub night. Much like this night. Cold and
————————————
Tears burned Draco’s eyes and left cool paths down his cheeks, and he was grateful he couldn’t see Harry’s face. He didn’t deserve to. He hadn’t deserved to say his name. Ever.
“I didn’t know who to ask, because what am I going to do, go to Hogwarts and ask Snape’s painting? No. Terrible. For a lot of reasons. But the cinema down the block was showing an old movie about a godfather, so I took the afternoon off-“
Ron shrugged.  It had been a weird day.
Seeing a paper crane drift down out of nowhere had startled Harry plenty, even before Malfoy disappeared.  He wasn’t proud of the squawk he’d let out.
And then Draco steps back to watch him, expectant but timid, as if he expects Harry to give chase. Draco’s bottom lip is caught between his teeth as he waits for Harry’s response, but nothing comes out but a stammered, “I- I-”
“Not great, honestly,” Draco said heavily, trying to sound remorseful.  “Issues with powdery mildew, but better than the neighboring estates.”
Godric, she was going to have words with Luna about this.  Maybe more than words with Parkinson.
He shook his head to clear the image, and Harry was wiping the condensation off the inside of the shower door.  Draco scrubbed his face with a nearby hanging towel.  Whether the sweat was from this tidy little breakdown or the shower, it was hard to tell.
Misplaced twitches in smoldering britches,
“I think you’re very caught, Draco,” Harry whispered.
Harry tosses a handful into the fireplace, and green flames surround Draco. For a moment, he looks like a Slytherin Phoenix, hard angles and watchful eyes.

Metaxas kicks up another plume of dry dirt and stubs his toe on a rock in the process.  “Fine!  Just walk the lap around the field with the teams, wave, and release the bloody Snitch.  Malfoy, you’re a right bastard, you know that.”
“I can’t change it from the outside, Malfoy,” he whispered.
The couple walked calmly toward the door, and the man took Molly’s hand and brushed a cordial kiss across her knuckles on the way.
The sun was high, but a wall of clouds looked to be coming down from the north.  He hoped he could Apparate the whole distance back to the Burrow and not have to hop in the rain.
Hermione sighed and spun around, grinning wickedly.  Her face dropped to his thigh, tongue cleaning a line straight through the mess.  Rising, she let him see the white pool collected in her cupped tongue as she hid it behind her lips.
She knelt, bum back on her heels, knees spread.  Ron knelt behind her, chin on her shoulder and one of his hands between her legs.  Her eyes were fixed on Draco’s cock, and Ron watched her watch Draco, equal amounts of heat in both their gazes.
There were only a few times a month where she needed to be in two places at once.  Creative scheduling would be imperative.
Because you read it alone, didn’t you?
“Shit shit shit shit…”
“So what
His hips stuttered, vice-like grip on her wrists holding tight. He cried out and gave one final deep thrust.

Malfoy shrugged, not at all interested in explaining the evolution of human affection to Potter.  “Be a dear and summon Granger for me, would you?  Tell her I have an exceptionally long, hard tome and I’d like her assistance.”
Harry leaned onto his back and laced his fingers behind his head, thinking.  What

“Do you
“Uhm . . . Yeah.” Jensen wipes under both eyes, sniffs, and puts on his best Auror face. “The Fourth of July is our family’s big get-together. I didn’t think I’d miss it that much.”
“Oh,” he said softly.  “I hadn’t made much of it,
Draco straightened and ran the tines of a fork over his chin as he thought.  “That might be interesting.  Quintaped blood wards.  Hm.”
“Oh…”  Harry dried his face a second time.  Then a third.  “Huh.”
“Anyway, I’m off,” he said, rising.  “I’ll see you soon.”
Blue eyes twinkled at him in understanding. “You found it, then?”
Draco blinked against a spreading swarm of hyper grey sparkles at the edges of his vision. “Let me out.”
He couldn’t help but inspect the hair-fine cut between the boy’s fingers.  The precision and placement didn’t look like a normal toddler injury.
,” he said, breaking into a yawn.  “Later.”
“Oh, shit,” Harry whispered.  “She probably doesn’t.  I only learned about it from Ministry orientation.”
Ron’s breath hitched, and Draco wondered if he’d gotten to the part with the auburn-haired boy.  If anything made Ron run away screaming, it would be the boy that looked like his nephew.
“Us?” Ron squeaked. “How did I get involved?”
From “Writings in Exile”
Smut.
Shifting substrate grows below me.
Green flames danced quietly, and she sighed as he turned.  “Wheal Elvan.”
A mortified blush started at her chest and spread like fire to her face.  Oh, Circe, he could taste Ron’s come on her.  And he was just staring at her, waiting.  Harry tasted a second finger and hummed low in disapproval.
“I mean, I think I have a fever,” she huffed, wincing but leaning into his touch.  Her skin was painfully sensitive, and she wanted both more and less of his touch.
Maybe she wouldn’t show up next month.  And maybe he’d burn these silly damn knickers.
The bed had come out of the estate vault years ago.  The Ministry appraiser had deemed it worthless, and thus available to him.  He’d actually been prepared to negotiate with Robards after seeing them pull it out, and maybe Robards had picked up on that.
And grit through my disdain.
“Oh?” Lucius inquired, interest thoroughly piqued.  “And who is the lucky witch?”
Hermione’s hand drifted between her thighs as she leaned back onto the couch.  Logs thunked into the fireplace, and Harry lit them with a quick spell.  He seemed in no hurry to dress, nor did she want him to.
She yawned, nodded, and handed it to Ron before surveying the bed.  A cold whisper of magic tickled Ron’s eye, and he looked to her for an answer.

“Agreed.”  Harry and Audrey said solidly.
.  Frustration simmered in Draco’s throat at Potter’s blasé attitude and asinine line of questioning.
“Are you setting a trap, Auror?” Draco asked indignantly, sitting up straight and taking the yellow dildo’s full length.  Harry’s gaze drifted to the disappearing golden shaft, and Draco wiggled his ass demonstrably.  “You’ll have to do better than that.
Draco rubbed his face against his forearms and weighed magically cooling his coffee against ending up with cold coffee.  He then briefly considered freezing Harry’s oatmeal for his own amusement.
“Fucking hell.”  Ron sniffed, wiping his eyes.  The expansion had been on track for the start of the term.  Moving the store beyond candy and pranks had been his goal for five years, now he’d be missing the critical window.
“Mm hm,” he hummed drowsily.  “A strange one.”  She sent a tendril of Legilimency toward him, probing, asking, but not demanding.  “Not yet.  I need to think it over.”
The knife scrapes around inside the butter dish, and Harry wonders if Draco is going to leave now that it’s empty. He hadn’t left when Harry said the bread wouldn’t be ready for an hour. He hadn’t left when Harry had said he was going to shower. He hadn’t left when Harry came back to the kitchen in his pyjamas and yawned loudly. And he doesn’t seem to be in a hurry now that the butter is gone.
“Very romantic,” Ron quipped. Hermione rolled her eyes.

“Wheal Elvan,” she shouted above the sizzle and crack.
“Don’t give me that look, Potter,” Malfoy admonished.  “Hindsight and all that.  And no, I did not indulge like that often.  Or don’t now, anyway.”
His squint deepened as he leaned his shoulders over the back of the sofa.  “They don’t call it ‘eagle-eyed’ for nothing, you know.  I think it’s the Kneazle.”  He sprang over the back of the couch in one fluid, long-legged sweep.  “I’m going to fly out and meet her.  And scare the

The corner of the tent was taken up by an olive backpack the size of a pillow, and the sight of it made Draco’s movements falter. His breath came fast as memories bombarded him. Every pouch, vial, tincture, poultice. Every small pill, ointment, and concoction. The notebook in the side pocket of Aurors names and treatments The larger notebook at the bottom of the pack with supply lists and on-going experiments.
“Potter,” Draco said dryly.  “It is not even noon, and you’re planning a fourth go at it?  That I’m aware of, at least.”
Harry rolls over, and my stomach rumbles.  Did I eat anything at that baby shower?
Her lips spread in a wide, toothy grin as she leaned forward and crushed herself against him. “I love you, too, Ron.” Her face nuzzled into his jacket, and he buried his nose in her hair.
“Tell me… that your bathroom explodes?”

He gripped his cock harder, her directness making his breath catch.  Women never actually told him what they wanted.  They only ever told him to choose.  Whatever the Chosen One wanted.  And it was beyond boring.  Not only did she know what she wanted, she told him how she wanted it.

The last column was labelled “Source”, which was generally used to link evidence to the case for ease of prosecution.  This column just had “#58720” in every blank.  Shrugging, Harry figured it was a mistake.

“And so,” Ron continued, “if you also find him attractive, you’re in good company.  Do you follow me?”
Last walk down the dank, gloomy hall.  Good riddance.
Malfoy sighed again and set the vials down.  His mouth was turned down in a contemplative frown, and Harry wondered if he’d overstepped.
“Yeah. Do me a favor, and when they offer you the Head Auror position, just take it.”
And what if he did?  Was he willing to just tell Hermione he wasn’t available anymore?  It would be rather nice to tell
“Slinky Malinky long-legs!”  A canvas cart rumbled over the uneven stones of the hall, coming to stop in front of his cell.  “I told ye ta stay away.”
down here?  Just generally avoiding your cases again?” Harry asked disapprovingly.
After the estate assets had been frozen, he’d had enough in his own vault to buy the piece of land.  Its only amenities were the coastal bluffs and a short mine shaft that had hit a hot spring and been abandoned.
Harry nodded and wadded up the empty pastry bag.  “Yeah, I’ll show you sometime.”
He tilted his chin up, blinking rapidly.

“Dray…”  He’d intended it as a warning, but it came out as a plea.
Dreams of falling off a cliff and not dying?  Fell off a cliff and turned into a damn bird.
Harry watches the film, but not really. He already knows the story, and watching Draco watch an animated fox is more entertaining than the movie itself.
He sighed, deep and… done.  His body sank into the mattress in a way that made him wonder if he’d ever fully put his weight on it before.  As if he’d always held tension against it, and had just now truly lain on it.  He sighed again and hummed, low and content.
Ron’s eyes darted side to side under hooded lids, trying to put words to the sentiment that had driven his actions.  He definitely hadn’t been motivated by malice, so he figured he didn’t have anything to lose by being honest.

Potter’s flat had a new couch, which begged the question of
The guards at the gate weren’t playing along.  Harry was almost ready to admit that being Head Auror would be nice right now.  He also was almost on the verge of admitting that his shoulder was a blazing, agonizing mess under his robe.  Almost.
Maybe get some space between his jail time today and divulging to his Auror friend that he was a petty criminal.  Well, more than petty, really.  And now he’d offered to delve into child trafficking, he thought wryly.  But for
“Deal.”  Falk slid his underwear off as Harry buttoned his jeans, openly watching.

Circe’s snatch, Potter took a surprisingly long time to get dressed for someone who usually looked like he threw himself into a Muggle clothes dryer and just wore whatever stuck to him.
“Yeah, I know. Do you think they’d help?”
“Harry,” he said thickly.  “This is the part where you go home.  But we both silently wish you didn’t have to.  Yeah?”
Harry realizes that when someone loves you, you can just ASK them for stuff.  Yes, Harry, even SEX STUFF.
So, maybe this level of intimacy was foreign and got under his skin.  That wasn’t so uncommon.  Not for somebody with his upbringing. And Draco understood.
“My shoulder is fine,” he murmured.  “I think you can stop staring at me.”
Or you torched it as you saw fit.
His grip on Draco’s hand shifted, as he stepped up closer, until they were gripping each other’s elbows.
But his thumb runs over the crest of my hip, onto the slick skin of that scar, and I’m undone.  His magic gushes down my skin, hot and wet, and flows between my legs, and I don’t notice my face pressed against the bars until he’s kissing me.
“I was essentially a house elf till I was eleven,” Harry retorted, cutting him off.  “Don’t insult me.”
“Two weeks, Dray.”
“You…” he drawled, flopping onto the mattress “are a fucking pig, Harry Potter.”
Floo in to Ballycastle and see Magnus.  It would mean a horrifically long flight home, but it might be worth it.  Especially if Magnus had relocated for more than Quidditch.
“Mm hm,” she hummed satisfactorily, running her nails up his back.
Longbottom was one of the few people he’d discussed it with.  Neve’s grandmother and the Dursleys had a bit in common.
Resting just below his navel, his hand sat, having collected most of his semen.  Her knees slid up to the outsides of his thighs, her elbows gently resting on his hips.
What was he giving Malfoy that he needed privacy for?  Especially in a room of half-naked party-goers?
“Wow.” Harry sat back in his chair and exhaled slowly. Chalk one up for Lucius being an unrepentant murderer, then. In fact, issuing a recent death threat was pretty good evidence.
A stifled snort and chuckle sounded above him.  Dignified, this last Malfoy.
Feed me desire, I’ll return fire,
Pansy’s phone vibrated again and Hermione’s name slid across the screen.  She read it with another smirk.
Only people born into that kind of legacy got a life like this.  A life where you could love who you wanted to and have them love you back.  Even print it on the front of a fucking magazine.
Draco squawked and hugged the soundboard of the harp, as if it could shield him.  Harry stood awkwardly in the doorway, frowning at his mobile.  White cords were draped loosely around his neck, and Draco wanted to grab a hold of them and pull him in and snog him till his horrible flat in

does it hurt?”
“Uhm, you busy?”
“-business at Wily Wands, Harry?” Dean asks.
She shook her head, but it was a lie.  She absolutely thought he’d been living out the twins’ teenage fantasy.
“And why the bloody bomber owls?” Ron chimed in.
*********************************
Harry moaned softly behind her, grinding his cock against her back.
In the kitchen, three glasses of water later, he noticed an improvised envelope with a note from Ron to Malfoy.  He had utterly no clue what Ron would want to tell Malfoy that was better-delivered in the post than by just Apparating to his house to tell him.
trying to catch my not-war-criminal arse.
” he said, loud enough for Harry to hear.  He whimpered in reply, but didn’t stop moving.

Harry moved on to washing his hair.  He could have just rinsed the rock dust out, but Ginny had left some very expensive shampoo back home.
Two mugs, he noticed, leaning to the side.  One had been obscured by the back of a chair.  Why would Draco get up in the middle of the night and make
Harry leaned down to whisper in Felix’s ear.  “Have the detention Owls sent to my office again this term.”
“Since when were you so bloody
Sliding his gaze away, Draco was exceptionally glad the bond from Healing Potter’s shoulder was gone.  Sexual exhibition was one thing, but emotional exhibition quite another.
Harry blinked rapidly as a cold breeze skimmed under his glasses and immediately disappeared.  “Are you wankers using Legilimency?  In bed?  Seriously?”
“Alright, there are some bits I can take creative license with, but you won’t be able to get out of it entirely without breaching the contract.”
Ron stood, slack-jawed.  “I-” He hesitated, catching himself nearly committing the unforgivable act of thanking a Goblin.  “I do drive a hard bargain, don’t I?”
“You’re too far away,
Losers weepers, Draco thought, rummaging through a drawer of t-shirts. A thin, stretchy red shirt with a Swedish broom company logo caught his eye. He tugged it on and ran his hands down the length of his torso. The shirt smelled faintly of old cigarettes.
Draco rolled his eyes as he stepped in front of Harry and bent over to lay silverware on the plates.  “Oh, please.  I’m still the Ministry’s dirtiest secret.”
should stop kneading, then. It’s very distracting.”
“Oh…” Draco sighs. “Okay.”
He knew Harry would decline, but held a sliver of hope, regardless.  Thrusting into Hermione to the sound of Harry’s moans would be utter perfection.  Much more fun than discussion of dead women, crystal balls, suspicious aprons, and parole.
“Sorry.” Harry said, embarrassed.  It hadn’t been a real kick.  “I see what you’re getting at.”
She bit her lip, trying to assemble memories into a cloud like he’d shown her, but they were slippery.  In a last ditch effort, she pictured the Occlumency as a big net, and scooped them up.  It worked, and she squeaked in surprise.
Harry nodded somberly, and Draco sighed.  It wasn’t the conversation he’d planned on having, but it was the one they’d ended up with.
Draco gasped, slamming the mug down. The man grinned and bit off a quarter of the piece of toast before nodding.
“She’s a bit of a child collector,” Draco mused out loud, thumbing the blade of his knife.

“Gods be damned, Malfoy!  What the fuck is wrong wi-“ she sputtered as her panties landed on her face.  “Stop digging through my bag!”
********************************
Draco isn’t home, and it should feel intrusive to be here without him, but it’s just as inviting as it had been last week. Harry peeks in the bathroom, and the walls are coated, floor to ceiling, in a layer of soot that can’t bode well for the tile. The edges of the floor have faint lines of crumbling grout that’s fallen from the walls. Harry bites his lip and hopes his project succeeds.
Instead, she swept the shreds into a pile, gingerly stepped in the middle of it, and nestled herself in with a wiggle.
“I might spend the winter in Greece,” he said, gaze distant.  “Especially Kos.  Nothing like a Mediterranean island in January.  Or maybe late winter and meet Magnus in Slovenia in spring,” he continued, palms skating down the fabric over his thighs.
Plucking the gold egg from the nightstand, he held it up in the light.  With a trickle of magic, the finger holds reappeared.  Interesting design, he mused, wondering if smelting would be a worthwhile hobby.
, he thought.  Maybe he really was just that terrible a partner.
“Family stuff,” she whispered.  Fatigue rolled off her in waves.
Ugh, he was going to make her ask again.  Like laying it all out last night hadn’t been embarrassing enough.
“SPEW will be happy with your filthy rags.”  Odbert shifted his weight nervously.  “You understand what we Goblins feel is ours.”
Ron pulled trousers on and scratched his beard.  “You’ve got the key to Harry’s flat, right?”
The ledge carved out several inches below the surface of the water was his demolitions oeuvre.  Hoisting himself up from the waist-deep water, he settled into the subtle curve of the warm stone, letting the water lap against his sides.  The radiant heat was luxurious, and his body melted.
Dean and Seamus holler as Ron comes through the door. Harry and Draco both flinch. Harry ducks down, using Draco’s head as a shield between him and Ron. “Let’s get out of here, and I’d be happy to show you.”
Dust tickled his eye again, and he took his glasses off to demonstrably rub it.  Fuck her admonishments and her implied threat.  He was hungry, and cold, and insulted, and more than ready to leave.  Gods, both eyes itched like hell.
Teeth dig in around his nipple, and he yelps. “Okay! Not a Golden Retriever!”
“Love you, too, ‘Mione!”

mug, on the coffee table kept drawing his attention. The cartoon men smiled in their sleep, and Draco wanted to crack the mug down the line of their bodies and split them apart.
, Granger?” He hadn’t flown here, hunted her down, and kept his own anxiety in check all day for idle chit-chat and ice cream in a fucking park.
“No,” he admitted with a shake of his head.  “You spend enough time in feathers, you lose your taste for eggs.”
Harry shuddered.  The bottom of the glass came into view, oddly clean.  None of the bitter, gritty remnants stuck to the inside.
“A challenge!”  Draco barked, settling himself over the golden length.  The blunt head wouldn’t be great fun on the way in, but fantastic once seated.  Again, he relaxed as he let his weight spread him open around the tip.
