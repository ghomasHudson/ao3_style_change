He saw Mrs. Malfoy suck in a breath and tears welled in her eyes, her shoulders slumped and it seemed Harry wasn't the only one freed by the statement. He could still feel her breath in his ear asking after her only child. Next to her Lucius was nodding imperiously, as if he wasn't shackled and bleeding.
He led them to a table in a corner of the bar. It was small and out of the way and Harry might have cast a small muggle repelling charm when he got there to make sure it would be available for them. He cancelled the charm as they got closer and signalled a nearby waitress. She nodded back in acknowledgment.
“I hope you plan on talking to that young man Harry. We need to be able to say thank you for this. I can't even begin to imagine how much a commission like this must have cost.” said Mr Weasley.
The sudden silence was almost as painful as the screaming had been. It felt like it had gone on for hours, but Harry knew it had only been seconds.
“It’s late. Your mother is already asleep. We can side along you to our home if you’d like? I’d love for you and Draco to finally meet your god-daughter.”
Ron smiled with tears in his eyes, reaching for his phone to text Draco, only to realize it wasn't there. Frowning he turned to Hermione.
“Draconis, if you sully my quarters I'll make sure to complete the subpar job Potter did on you  earlier.”
Ron took Scorpius by the hand and saw Draco out a comforting hand on Caesar’s shoulder. He looked at his small family and then at the large Weasley family he had once been a part of. He missed them of course  but standing with the two facing off he knew he would abandon the Weasley’s to be a Malfoy every single time the ultimatum was given to him. He just hoped no one would make him choose this time. Taking a deep breath he looked each sibling in the eye, then turned to his mum.
Malfoy went still. Whatever color had left drained from his face and both his jaw and his fingers went slack. Good maybe now he would see why it was so important they go tonight. The Wealseys were all coming around to Malfoy being there and him running off to go to some other party where he didn't know anyone was not going to help his cause.
“My baby.” she whispered, the night so silent around them the soft sound sounded like a shout that Ron felt stitching up the small broken pieces of his heart he had gathered and put into a box the last time he had left the Burrow, apparating heartbroken and sobbing directly into Malfoy’s flat.
“You’ve missed lunch. You can have that to maybe hold you over until dinner.” Neville had said softly, still waiting for the blonde to spit something cruel at him. He had been surprised when all he received in turn had been a soft, but curt, thank you. His surprise must have shown on his face because Draco’s lips twitched into that familiar cruel edged smirk, only smaller and more tired.
Harry was entranced by the flush still staining Malfoys cheeks. He took his hand once he had righted his clothing and led them both outside and around the corner to the pub. When they got there Malfoy pulled his hand from Harry’s.  Confused Harry turned around to look at him. Malfoy looked confused and agitated.
“Ugh, never mind” he turned back to the floo and tossed in a handful of powder calling out for Granger. Harry was calming down behind him, but he could hear him murmuring to himself in between coughs.
“I understand Severus showed his disdain for your openly at any opportunity he had despite his overwhelmingly unrequited love for your mother but in Draco’s eyes that acerbic man was everything. So yes, Harry Potter. Draco’s grief and pain over the loss of his godfather bore him a dementor” Mr. Malfoy hissed. He stood unmoving and unblinking until he curled his lip at Harry and turned away from him, dismissing him.
“He’s looking for someone.” Harry realized. The group in front of him stopped and turned to look at him, apparently surprised by his company.
Harry was stunned. Everyone knew Lucius Malfoy had escaped Azkaban in the first war by claiming to be under the Imperius. That he would allow his son to claim the same under his own hand to guarantee his safety was completely unexpected from the man Harry thought he was. The older Malfoy he had seen through Voldemort's visions had been a broken shell of a man. Even the man Harry had seen only minutes before, still cowering behind his lord, seemed ages away from the desperate father in front of him. That Mrs. Malfoy loved her son was obvious from the first, but he had never realized that Mr. Malfoy might love him as well.
“Draco!” she yelled, ignoring the four boys and moving directly over to where Dean and Malfoy were now whispering to each other. She paused at the end of the bed anxiously.
The school had commissioned mandatory counseling for anyone looking to come back.  One hour a week, no excuses, no exceptions. It was nice actually, to be able to talk to someone without feeling stupid or weak. It was also nice knowing everyone was either dealing with the same issues, or had learned to deal with the issues someone else may have. Every 6th, 7th, and returning 8th year student knew how to spot a panic attack, or help someone who was dissociating. Everyone knew what to do or who to get whenever a problem arose, and as the months went on even those episodes were decreasing. Not that they had been prevalent in the first place.
“Thank you, yes ok, yes of course. I'm going. Maybe call Sasha? He was ready to take over the class until the end of the year for me. Right you knew that. Ok yes. I-I-I’ll go now.” Ron rambled as he pulled off his quodpot leathers wrinkling his nose at the sweat tacky clothes underneath.
“I don’t care how anxious they are to come out, there will be no pushing until their sorry excuse of sire arrives!” he screamed.
“And Malfoy, Draco Malfoy felt enough grief over Professor Snape to create a dementor?” he asked skeptically.
“There! Over there! Draco!” she called out to Malfoy’s retreating back. If he heard her he made no sign of it. He kept moving slowly, but purposefully onward, his head swiveling back and forth over the ruined terrain.
Ron looked over at him and noticed the beautiful woman standing next to him for the first time. Percy cleared his throat when he noticed all eyes had turned towards him. The woman rubbed her hand down his back encouragingly.
He wondered, not for the first time how things would have gone had he shaken Malfoy's hand all those years ago.
He had imagined rooming with Potter and the Weasel for eighth year would have been miserable. He imagined days filled with scornful glances, and nights spent with hateful words away from the watchful eyes of the professors. Or even worse for the two,  Granger.
“Come on, let’s go grab a table. Someone talked up the fish and chips in this place, and while I can't really imagine him eating with his hands, I do trust his judgement.” Malofy flushed slightly and Harry knew he had said the right thing.
Nearly 10 years after leaving England behind Ron had not anticipated being a quodpot coach at a new Wizarding school in the Americas, but he loved it. Every so often he would have the kids play quidditch just for fun if he could manage to convince Draco to stop by on one of his days off.
“Do. Not. Try and tell me that you love me Potter so help me i will hex you where you stand” Malfoy hissed through gritted teeth.
He had a specific name for each of his closest friends. Pansy was Love, Goyle was My Sweet, Zabini was handsome, and most recently Hermione and Ron had become increasingly, Darling and Sweetheart respectively.
“Please, that was AFTER everything was done! My bill had already passed the Wizengamot, which is the only reason Hermione even heard of it. You helped it be readily accepted by the masses, i'll grant you that, but don't act like you did it out of the goodness of your heart. You did it because it directly affected you with Teddy and William. I certainly didn't see any of you when the magi-muggle primary school opened.”
Malfoy said something to the bartender but whatever it was Harry couldn't hear it past the roaring in his ears. Malfoy looked incredible and he was heere for Harry. He had dressed up looking like a wet dream Harry didn't even know he had and all Harry could hear was the rushing of his blood as it all gathered in his groin.
“Please leave.” Ron blinked at him and snapped his mouth shut “ I'm infinitely more afraid of your husband than I am of being down a professor 3 weeks before school ends.” Kolit told him with a wide, toothy grin.
“I looked for you everywhere I could think of, anywhere I remembered you mention.” he felt Draco’s stomach muscles tighten as he dropped kisses in a perfect line across his abdomen.
“We’ll have to be careful with that one,” Kingsley said beside him. He still wasn't smiling but his eyes were a little less dull than before, Harry thought. “She’ll take the palace over if we send her to Azkaban.”
Harry groaned out loud “what now? I thought we were done fighting.” he was done anyways. Harry might not always listen to whatever Malfoy had to say about his work but most nights they spent together he was either tired from a long day or not exactly in a talking mood.
“Well for tea of course” she answered as she engorgio’d the gift box nearly stumbling under its weight once it was full sized again.
“What do you mean what am I doing? I thought we were having a good time and frankly i'm not looking to end the night yet.”
“Nonsense” Mrs Weasley waved him off with a hand while reaching for the shrunken box “that boy had much more important things to do tonight. I can't wait to see him next wednesday to hear how it went!”
“And before you lose your tenuous grip on your temper , I only ask you that to say this: the grief you felt at losing your godfather is nothing -” he hissed, finally losing his Malfoy composure “to the grief Draco is feeling at losing his and being the one to find his mangled body. He has always  been there in Draco’s life, from the moment he slipped from my wife’s body into Severus’ waiting hands until the dark lord called him away on the steps of this school.”
“Er, she asked me to try and track them down actually. Maybe a week or two ago.” Harry chimed in running a nervous hand through his hair. Ginny looked dismayed at the news.
“Tell me Potter,” Lucius said behind him “how much grief did it cause you when you lost the godfather you had only truly known for a handful of months?”
“It’s ok,” Neville murmured, taking the cloth from Draco and soaking it again. He suppressed a flinch when the dittany met the skin of his lip.
“I need to know we’ll be safe here. I need to know we won’t be shunned or attacked. It’s been decades I know. But my family comes first. I’m a Malfoy mum,dad. And if you can’t have a Malfoy in your home I understand. We’ll leave.” his mum let out a despairing noise at that but he pressed on.
“I’m pretty sure it was that bitch of a sister in law of mine. Do remind Draco to send the Weasley’s a gift basket on my behalf. I’d do it myself but I may be out of the area for the indefinite future.”
“Please, just let us find him and we will all go with you.” Narcissa Malfoy pleaded with Kingsley who looked put out, but not unsympathetic.
i actually really liked this one and will be posting it as a one shot as well. i worked really hard on it and it was originally intended for this challenge so i figured i'd just do both. thank you!
“What?! Just because i dont care about your stupid Gala more than i care about my family, your just going to break up with me?!” he couldn't believe the level of selfishness Malfoy was showing him. Maybe he should break up with him instead.
“Malfoy, I'm going to remove the blankets and move us to the floor so Pansy can sit with you ok?” Malfoy didn't answer him,but his eyes flicked between Dean and Pansy while Dean worked to pull the quilts free of his body. All his writhing had pulled them in tight and Dean had to manipulate Malfoy’s body to and fro in order to yank them off of him.
“Oh Harry he had already told me he wouldn't be coming. But how could you not know? About the school? It's so important to him. He said if children could only learn about each other's worlds then the fear and jealousy that fueled him and his family would never have been allowed to happen. He worked so hard on that on top of his job at the ministry. You really had no idea?” asked Mrs Weasley quietly.
“I am ready to go now. I will take the body with me to the ministry and have my lawyers begin burial proceedings according to his will.”
This was unbelievable. their fight had devolved drastically and Harry had no idea how. What did that poncy school even matter?  There was no way he was going to let Malfoy off the hook on this.
She cleared her throat slightly and Redding  began to fidget before looking at Harry and crossing over to him.  He barely had time to shove the letter and memories into his pocket before he found himself with an armful of unconscious long limbs and pale skin. Harry looked down at Draco and then up at Mrs. Malfoy. She smiled serenely at him then with a nod from her Redding activated the portkey and they were gone.
He could see the rest of his siblings drawing nearer to get a glimpse. He caught Fred’s eye over his mum’s shoulder. He was crying and Angelina  held him tightly.
The small well of dissatisfaction that had sprung that night in the pub had only grown as Harry began to catalogue all the new information he had on Malfoy’s habits.
“Oh so because i didnt go to that stupid fancy pureblood school opening all of a sudden i dont care?”
“Tell me Potter,” Lucius said behind him “how much grief did it cause you when you lost the godfather you had only truly known for a handful of months?”
“Oh, uh yes so-sorry professor. Erm, Harry is on the pitch right now if you wanted to try and find him there.”
“I can't carry both of these Malfoy, come help.” it said in Blaise’s lazy drawl that was so like Draco’s only deeper.
It was his first first date in ages, and really he didn't count anything with Ginny as first date material. They had just . . . . .been together. Breakfast in the great hall with everyone they knew around them didn't count he didnt think. So really if he thought about it, this was his first first date ever.
Ron turned around to walk back up to the house, stopping only to lace his fingers with Draco’s over their son’s knee.
Ron could feel the blood rush to his head and swoop back down into his stomach as he stared at Draco.
“Draco, if anything was going to make me see you as ugly I think it would have been the whole poisoning Ron thing, this? This is like a roadmap I get to follow.” Neville told him with a smile. At his stupid boyfriends confused look Neville couldn't help but smirk. He leaned in for a kiss that was eagerly returned. Lowering himself to his knees on the floor, he sat Draco up, moving the blanket off him completely so he could get as close as he could between his thighs. When Neville finally broke the kiss he leaned his forehead against Draco’s.
“Well it’s the thin lips for me.” Harry said and promptly began a hacking cough that had Draco recoiling in his seat.
Draco shifted next to him, pulling his hand away. He looked like he wanted to say something, and Ron smiled encouragingly.
“Yes, i suppose that’s all you’ll be able to do.”  she turned and nodded to Kingsley and held her hands out to her auror who still had Draco in his arms.
“If those are your reflexes, Potter then I'm not  surprised you left the aurors. Relax, I'm not going to hex you. I'm also not going to work with you any longer. I suggest you find another place of employment Potter. I'm not leaving Hogwarts and you are not staying. Understood?”
“It's almost as if you don't remember what angry Malfoy looks like, Potter. Lucky for you Draco takes after his Mother. Unluckily  for you, Draco takes after his mother.”  Blaise smiled sharply from where he was seated. “ Draco already forwarded me a list of his things. He said if he missed anything to keep it. I'll be by yours tomorrow at 10 to pick up his belongings, be a dear and have everything ready.”
“He’s looking for someone.” Harry realized. The group in front of him stopped and turned to look at him, apparently surprised by his company.
Before he could think of a loving Malfoy family dynamic, another younger auror stepped into the great hall.
And while Harry loved that they had all come so far since the end of the war and were proper friends nowadays, he couldn't help but be a little resentful of the fact that apparently everyone was privy to Malfoy’s affection.
He could feel himself getting defensive, but he wouldn't let anyone degrade his family, or his name. And Malfoy was his name now and he was certainly proud to use it. Ron felt Hermione dig her nails into his arm pulling him back towards her. He hadn't even noticed he had moved towards his siblings until she did. He looked over at her wide, pleading eyes and sighed. He knew he needed to at least try, for his mum’s sake if not his own. But there was only so much he was willing to subject his children to.
But when Harry eventually managed to pluck up his Gryffindor courage and finally kiss Malfoy’s sweet lips he decided he didn't care what Malfoy called him. So long as Harry could be the only one to taste the candied flavor of Malfoy’s mouth it didn't matter. So he drank down the sugared taste on Malfoy’s tongue until he knew every flavor it had to offer, not breaking the kiss until the need to breath overpowered the need to savor everything Malfoy was giving him.
“This has nothing to do with the Weasleys, though I am sad to find out they disliked me. They did a rather good job of covering that up I must say. Give them my regards for tonight if you feel like it. That was actually the reason I came. To give you their anniversary gift from me. I shrank it down for you to transport.”
“Mr. Longbottom, if there is nothing you need from me I have another Gryffindor to hang and quarter.” Professor Snape said in front of him.
“What exactly have they done for me Harry? Not that I don't appreciate their acceptance but they didnt DO anything for me. I worked hard for myself. I lobbied the Wizengamot for the opportunity to complete my mastery on my own. I completed my studies at the top of my class years before anyone. I clawed my way up to my position in the Council of Magical Law alone. I took myself to therapy. I taught myself all about the muggle world in order to learn past my prejudices. I rewrote the laws that allowed muggle born children the opportunity to learn about the magical world before hogwarts. I campaigned for a greater inclusion for werewolves on my own. I dragged myself out of the mud my parents dragged me into YEARS before you or any weasley showed up, so tell me, What. Exactly. Did. They. Do. For. Me. That would excuse me not going to when I had this planned for months now?”
Ron circled the pitch watching his students carefully as they ran drills in front of him. The quick quill and notepad he used to take notes hovered in the air next to him, waiting for him to narrate the next series of corrections he could make to each of their forms.
“I’m pretty sure it was that bitch of a sister in law of mine. Do remind Draco to send the Weasley’s a gift basket on my behalf. I’d do it myself but I may be out of the area for the indefinite future.”
Harry got in bed but didn't close his curtains. He watched Dean whisper to Malfoy behind a silencing charm, introducing him to Seamus it seemed, if the handshake was any indication. Malfoy spoke for a minute and Seamus looked angry for a bit then more resigned than anything before shaking his head and waving Malfoy off with a small smile.
He could hear the shouts from the rest of the family calling her to stop and to slow down but all he could see was her moving towards him, and he ran to meet her part way. She didn't slow down at all barreling into him with far more weight to her than he had been expecting. Thankfully his job kept him in top shape 9 months out of the year so it was no problem.
“I'm calling Granger and the Weasel. Your no fun when your sick.” Draco threw himself off the couch when Harry threw an old tissue at him scrambling for the floo on his hands and knees. Harry let out a croaking laugh behind him.
“And it was the biggest mistake your father and I ever made.” his mum’s voice rang out in the silence.
Neville ignored him, moving towards the door, surprised to see they really were Snape’s sleeping quarters and not his office after all.
Draco didn't move any faster, every once in a while he would stop and peer at a- peer down Harry corrected himself firmly- Harry could see his shoulders shaking harder and harder each time he moved on.
Harry opened his eyes and saw the others still in front of him, clutching themselves with their hands over their ears. Mrs. Malfoy was openly crying and leaned heavily into her husband's arms. Kingsley had his hands to his head but his eyes were open, looking soberly at the boat house through squinted eyes.
Ron debating apparating the few meters back to the car when he heard a shout up ahead and his vision was taken over by a bright silvery light that coalesced  to form two separate forms. A stag and a doe stood before him, bathing him in light. Throwing a quick glance back to the car, he confirmed the light of the Patronus did not reach the car before casting a quick Finite to dispel the glowing forms.
“Mr. Weasley we understand, but you waited until the end stages of labor to come in, we really can’t wait any longer.” Ron heard Healer Brixley say.
Draco tried to raise his arms to help Neville but yelped before they could get too high. He sighed, already knowing what was wrong.
Draco tilted his head and considered Harry. He was looking rather flushed and had sweat beaded on his forehead. That, and the way he seemed to huddle in on himself instead of draping his body across the couch with his legs intertwined with Draco’s pointed to him probably actually being sick. He wrinkled his nose.
''Fuck-ah'' he moaned pulling her into him with his arms wrapped around her back kissing her and motioning his tongue with hers, tasting that sweet taste she always held while his spurts of thick, white cum shot up into her filling her up.
''Ok'' I breathe out ''Enjoy the rest of your day'' I mutter before walking back up to the manor, taking a glance behind me to see him greeting Astoria and walking her up the gardens where we just were.
''Such a good fucking girl for me'' he smirked, allowing one of his fingers to dip into her entrance and thrust in and out softly to prepare her for his cock.
I could just go check on her, see if she's ok. She did almost trip up the stairs, I could ask her if she's ok from that.
He grabs my leg lifting it over his shoulder giving him more access to fuck right up into me as I moan through the pleasure.
''Juliet could you grab the other bottle please'' Narcissa calls out to me making me snap out my thought.
She nods in response and I shake my head at her pressing my hand further onto her neck and tightening my hold to which she grabs my wrist at with a sharp breath.
And as soon as he says that my hand flies up to his shoulder pulling him closer to my chest as he keeps thrusting his fingers in me and rubbing his thumb on my clit as I jolt and shake through my high. The rush going straight to my head and I feel like I'm seeing stars at the orgasm I'm having right now, one like no other.
''Shut the fuck up'' I smirk pulling the covers over her arms and brushing a piece of hair out of her face ''Ok?'' I ask to make sure she has everything needed before I leave.
''No?'' he laughs at me then pushing himself out of his chair and bang his hands on the table making me flinch ''Get me a fucking drink-''
''It's good to have friends'' she smiles widely then looking at Draco ''You should invite Blaise and Pansy around one day. I'm sure they'd love Juliet-''
He tilted his head up to look at her again with a confused look before a smirk appeared back on his face ''Are you trying to seduce me?'' he said through a hushed tone looking at her humorously ''If so, lift your dress a bit higher and undo a couple of buttons'' he looked her up and down biting his bottom lip as she shook her head at him ''No?''
''You're beautiful. Better?'' I ask with a smirk and I notice her lips curl up slightly, no matter how much she tries to hide it.
''I'm not going to go easy on you'' he say as if he's trying to get it into my head now before he even starts ''So I need you to understand that when I begin, I'm not stopping'' he says sternly.
''I do actually yes'' I smile and he turns his head away from me with a slight curl to his lips, trying to surpress that smile again.
His voice becomes a little more gentle when he says ''If you want me to stop at any point, you have to tell me loud and clear darling, ok?'' he asks and it's as if for a moment he might actually care.
Her nails dig into my thighs as I thrust into her violently, chokes coming from the back of her throat before she slaps my thigh making me pull out of her as she catches her breathing back.
She grabs my thighs as she sucks on my cock, bobbing her head up and down in fast movements as I let out another moan thrusting myself into her mouth slowly.
I shook my head, "I've been avoiding him. He's had the past couple days off and I've managed to keep him away. And don't even bother telling me he deserves to know, because I heard it all from Blaise."
“Longbottom.” I speak, authority in my voice. He turns to face me, at the top of the stairs by now, looking worried with what I have to say. I soften my tone. “Stay safe.” I say. He blushes further, if possible, and the two men disappear into his room. I’m about to turn back to Blondie when a female voice distracts me.
She laughs as my answer. “I kept putting off our first time. I thought I don’t want Mr Big Dick to ruin me before I’ve even had a kid.” We chuckle together.
Spurred on by his praise, I slip him cock back into mouth, and begin sliding him in and out of my mouth, going as far back as I am without gagging. Each time I pull back, I hollow my cheeks and revel in the groans leaving Draco’s mouth as I do. I lose myself bobbing up and down on his dick, letting it settle deeper into my mouth and feeling myself getting wet. I accidentally let my teeth drag against him and stop sucking when he lets out a hiss.
I might have gone and accidentally written the next chapter completely, so hopefully I can get an update for this in a couple days. Hope you enjoyed, loves x
“He’s got a point.” Draco turns to me. “Next time you’ll have to be as loud as Longbottom there’s, right baby boy?”
The cottage was small. He could see lights on in the house and a roaring fireplace in the living room. Knees weakening from the cold, he tried his luck, prying open the gate and kicking snow out of the way as he made his way down the path, too cold and tired to even lift his feet.
”Of course. They’re fantastic.”Silence. Slowly, hesitantly, Teddy leans up and connects their lips. Scorpius replies gently, cupping my godson’s face. “You good?” He whispers as he pulls away. At this, I grab Draco’s arm and pull us out of sight. He lifts his eyebrows at me .
My mind blanked and my heart stopped in my chest as I lept away from the table, away from his hand. Everyone was silent, the noise of my chair falling the only sound in the room. They were all looking at me, a matching expression of concern on their faces.
I suck in a breath when I see what he’s packing. I doubt that thing can fit in my mouth, let alone my ass. I look up to him as I gently kitten lick the tip. His head tips back slightly and a groan falls out of his mouth.
Draco interjected. "Harry lived with me as a cat for a couple months. I didn't realise who he was so of course I opened my home to him. My friends immediately recognised him, but I ignored them, for the most part. But I promised him that if he was really a wizard, then he could stay as long as he liked.
"It's charmed to keep your head dry so you don't have to wear a hood. I know you hate how they mess up your hair. The makers charm the threads to create a bubble of protection from natural elements, each layer of thread creating a stronger bubble in a larger field."
Bogged down with a dumb cold, decided to write some fluff. Hope to be back with some smut soon, enjoy the chap x
“Harry, did you get the- oh, sorry. Guests.” Hermione smiles, standing at the foot of the stairs. I spare a glance at Malfoy before turning to her.
"Harry!" Charlie smiled when he saw me. The rest of the Weasleys, plus Luna and 'Mione, were all busy talking. "Long time no see, bud!"
Next chapter will be up in a couple hours. Been a hot minute since my last upload but my exam went well and I’m in a good mood. Quite a bit of smut next chapter lads so make sure you stick around! (And you can bet your sweet little asses that Scorp and Teddy become a thing)
"It should be a crime for you to wear that, fuck." He groans as I walk over to him, giving a quick twirl on the way over. By now he's sitting on the edge of the bed, so I straddle him and sit on his lap. His hands immediately move to cup my ass as he presses soft kisses across my chest and up my neck. "Are you OK to wear these?" He asks, obviously concerned about my dysphoria.
”Earlier? Like when I was fingering you in the alley? Or the kitchen? Or when you were sucking me off? It was a bit hard to drop into conversation.”
“You and Pansy are two peas in pod.” He rolled his eyes in return, leaning back slightly in the chair.
When it finally comes down to me, however, Draco takes one look around before grabbing my wrist roughly and pulling me into an empty interrogation room.
Gin returned to the living room as I headed up to Teddy's room, knowing he'd be in. I knocked loudly, and waited for a clear response before entering. He's a teenage boy with a boyfriend, I wasn't going to risk anything.
When I get home, I shower and dress quickly, slipping on the thong underneath my jeans. I take a minute to see how they look. Luna was right, it does match my eyes. Teddy, who readily agreed to come with me to meet Scorpius, and I were both surprised when the doorbell rang at exactly seven. I ran downstairs, out of breath when I opened the door to see a very smart looking Draco.
Harry didn't waste any time banging on the wooden door. And again when there wasn't an immediate answer.
”Dad?” I voice my thoughts, letting myself known. Draco’s head snaps up and his eyes widen. I step closer so I’m next to them.
”Astoria, you must remember me mentioning Edward, uh, Teddy Lupin? Remus and Nymphadora’s son. Andromeda’s grandson.” Draco explains. The woman nods slowly. “And Harry runs the Griffin gang. Teddy, as his Godson, was named heir. Andromeda kicked him out because he accepted the offer and so he’s living with the gang. I don’t think he”s officially joined yet.”
“Really?” Harry asked, getting excited. Draco rolled his eyes and laid on his back, making a point of it as he did.
"He doesn't love you. You mean nothing to him! He's only with you because he can fuck you for free and not worry about having some kid because you're so caught up in the fucking idea that you're a guy! You're a girl! God gave you a vagina and a sweet pair of tits for a reason!" I tried to scream in my mouth, but barely any noise came out. His hand holding my wrists moved away but his hand stayed on my mouth. As soon as I tried to attack him, it went back. "Listen here, slut. You'll do as I say or I'll have every one of your pathetic gang shot. You included. And then I'll shoot Draco and his kid. And then every one of those other fucking gang members in this shithole, alright?" I blinked rapidly to stop the tears as his words cut me deeper and deeper, but I nodded slowly. Fuck, if anything happened to them I would never forgive myself. "Good girl." If only he would just kill me instead.
"Perhaps you could tell him it's a girl who's been assaulted. He obviously knows - Well that's a lie. I'm a guy but he still believes I'm a girl, so maybe that might help throw him off a bit."
”Hey. I’m Harry. I’d shake your hand but they’re bit oily.” I grin. The boy is taller than me, but clearly younger, if only by a couple years. He has bright blond hair that reminds me of Draco, but his eyes are a dark brown.
“The detective will just be a minute,” he said as he left, but he paused before he opened the door, and turned around. “It’s a female detective. I’m not going to tell Draco. I’ll be waiting for you when you’re done. I’ll make sure he’s out on patrol.”
”Actually, before I go.” Scorpius walks back in and I can sense Draco rolling his eyes. “Who’s the cute kid with the blue hair?” I smile.
”Yes. Correct.” I smile. Only ten. “Ten for each.” I whimpered. He pulled my panties down so they fell to my ankles. “I’ll count them today. If this has to happen again, it’ll be your responsibility.” I nod in reply.
Despite being the King, or simply leader as I liked to think, of the Griffin Gang, I didn’t have my own house. Sure, I owned the housing in the area we lived in and usually had first dibs on things, but I hated living alone. Which meant that I shared a house with several other people, namely Longbottom, Thomas, Weasley and Granger.
When Harry looked up, he smiled at him, putting the book down not bothering to mark the page. "You're done." In hindsight it probably was meant to be more of a question, but Harry seemed a little too excited for it to be so.
”Don’t get too worried about them. Trust me, if Teddy really wasn’t into it then Scorp would stop going after him.”
I spend a few minutes trying to work the coffee pot, but when I fail I instead fill the kettle and set about making a pot of tea. As it boils, I tidy away dishes off of the draining board and empty the dishwasher, and find myself giving the kitchen a general once over. Once the kettle has boiled and the tea has steeped, I lean against the spotless countertop sipping my mug of hot tea. I hear movement from upstairs.
"I can't be with you anymore, Gin. Every day since we got together after the war, you put me on some pedestal. Like I'm some hero who can handle everything that comes his way. You forced me into a career which has almost killed me several times. You don't care when I'm not okay, if I'm ill or injured or just not having a good day. I try to talk to you about things and you brush it off like ignoring problems will fix them."
Draco took the cat to the vet, surprised that it dutifully followed him there, not needing to be carried, and stuck close by him when he walked up to the receptionist.
”This is a punishment.” He reminds me. I take a deep breath before lying on his lap, my crotch pressed against his leg. His hand moves over my asscheeks gently, rubbing the smooth skin. “Tell me why you are being punished.” His voice is deep with authority and I shiver.
As soon as I was in the cell I was pinning him to the wall with my arm, pressing down firmly on his windpipe.
Draco wanted to ignore what she had said, he really did, but despite how hard he tried, over the following few days he watched James closely, almost hoping to see whatever Melissa had been on about.
"Oh, Luna's working today." Cho shrugged with a smile. I held back my confusion, knowing for a fact that Luna was not working today, and was actually enjoying her day off with her girlfriend, but I allowed the conversation to continue. "It's just, ever since Marcus' death, I've not felt safe at the Serpents. I know the gang all feels like that, but I'm scared something might happen." You and me both, Cho. "I'm sure you can understand. I just was wondering if I might be able to move residence for a while, stay here until everything's calmed down." I listened to her as I saw a police car pull up down the road, and three people get out of it. "I'd just feel so much safer with such a strong leader around, who knows what he's doing." Her tone had changed, as had her body language, and I blinked in surprise.
”Hi Draco. Lovely to see you again.” The younger of the two women says. She has long, light brown hair, partially pinned back, and eyes that match Scorp’s. She’s not much shorter than Draco, and appears to be the same age as him. Despite this, she looks beautiful, make up perfectly applied to her heart shaped face and an outfit that accentuates her subtle curves.
The wine was followed by a box of chocolates from a patisserie near his mother's French summer house, where he used to visit as a child.
"Hi baby," he grinned. "I'm technically still on duty but there was a breakthrough with the case and I had to tell you now."
"Honestly, it's a wonder why they haven't fired you from the force. You're a shitty police officer." I walk over to him and blow the smoke into his face, before holding it out to him. He takes it after a second of hesitaition, putting it to his lips experimentally. "Breathe it in, hold it for a few, then exhale." I instruct, before turning to make the bed. It's barely a second when I hear him coughing, and a smile crosses my face. I turn to him, his face red from the coughing. I take it from him, and make sure he's looking at what I do. I inhale the smoke deeply, before holding it in my lungs for a couple seconds and letting the chemicals flood my system and then exhale through my lips, aiming at his face, which scrunches up at my action. "You just need some practice."
It’s two days since Teddy had arrived and he had taken to the gang like fish to water. Despite his history of staying locked in his room, Teddy was almost always talking to someone. Everyone was eager to meet him. They - including Teddy himself - knew that it wasn’t most likely he would take over from me if something happened, and they didn’t disagree with my choice. His charismatic nature meant everyone was friendly with him and was glad he had joined.
"Couldn't sleep last night. Nightmares. The usual," I shrugged. She frowned for a second, knowing I hadn't had nightmares in years.
When I went downstairs, I could hear voices in the living room, but I headed to the kitchen to avoid them. Unfortunately, my smartest friend and gang member was stood making herself a coffee.
tiptoes to close the distance. Draco's mind barely had time to register what was happening when Harry's lips pressed against his. Draco's pressed back, trying to hold back after years of waiting for this moment.
"What d'you want, Scorp? I already gave you this week's allowance.” Draco turns from his spot on the stairs.
"Right, now get your ass in the shower." He got up and grabbed my hand, pulling me up before heading to the door.
"We're the same age, you twit. That's not what I meant. During school..." Harry leaned back on his haunches a little. "During school they were always glaring, you had a harsh look. Angry and... scared, I think. Now they're calm and wise. I like them much more now." He added, not thinking about his words. "You have crows eyes too!" Harry leaned back in, brushing a thumb along the end of Draco's cheekbone, his hand cupping the blond's purely accidentally.
Goyle grabbed my wrists and pinned them above my head with one hand before letting go of my neck. Immediately I gasped for air.
Blondie hauls me into the back of the police car and we wait for a truck to arrive to pick up my car. I watch with horror and worry about what they’ll find when they search it.
Once he finishes spanking me, I’m lost in a haze of pleasure, pain and lust, and I can feel my crotch is dripping wet right now. Draco’s fingers glide about on my asscheeks, before he pushes my legs apart slightly.
"I'm so close, baby." He says, following it with another moan. I try to reply, but I can only whimper. He leans back, using the new angle to thrust deeper into me, yet more erratically as we both edge closer to climax.
"And if you're not, then it helps with your disguise. That's why I'm assuming you're a cat. You're hiding from something. What kind of animagus willingly gets adopted by some ex-Death Eater who runs a coffee shop?
"Yes, Gin. I have. So many times. But you keep ignoring me and keep pushing me away. I tried to love you, so many times I tried. I can't. I can't try anymore."
“Yeah. I need to tell you a few things, some very important things. You need to listen, alright? You can ask questions as we go along, but keep your ears peeled.” He nods, solemly.
He shook his head. "It's not." I stepped back, before laying on his bed, my back to the headboard. I patted the space next to me. He hesitated, going to pick up his sweater off the floor.
”You’d have me following orders in no time, daddy.” I whisper. He smiles, before pressing a kiss to my forehead. He lets me go before calling someone.
"Lord of the Rings... The Hobbit..." Draco muttered aloud. As he read the blurb, he raised an eyebrow.
"Definitely an idiot," he heard Draco chuckle. "I've got your towels." He added, clearing his tone. "Your clothes were soaking. I'll leave some outside the door for you."
"Because I ran away from home and hid as a kitten? And now you know who I am. So now I have to go home before the reporters find me."
"Sorry daddy." I look over my shoulder for a second, making eye contact with him. When he starts to press a third finger into me, my head drops, but doesn't press into the bed, and I let out a moan for him. He repeats his actions from before, except with the third finger as well this time. When he pulls his fingers out of me, I let out a small sound of annoyance and he chuckles softly.
"I... I guess I just want you to be safe, James. You can change back whenever you like. You can stay with me as long as you like, really. I think I'd like the company. But-" Draco was cut off by a small black paw pressing against his lips.
. They are families, no less than yours or mine. They've been through hell yet you have the gall to call them scum because what?"
“It’s your café, Draco,” they laughed. “You’re allowed to go for a break. I’ll be fine here, it’s quiet.”
”She said that that’s fine. She’ll take responsibility for anything until they are. She just... she doesn’t want a gang member living in her house.” She adds the last part in a whisper. Luna had gone through something similar. After she began dating Ginny in college, she joined the gang but stayed living at home, planning to move here when college finished. Her father had found out, however, seeing the tattoo on her collar bone peeking out under a shirt, and kicked her out the following day.
?" Ginerva gestured toward Draco, before sending him a look of disgust. Draco didn't know whether to be pissed off or a little proud that she still hated him. "You prefer living with him than your own girlfriend?" Harry had his head in his hands at this point and Draco could see him mumbling replies. Ginerva stood abruptly and stalked over the counter, leaning across slightly to begin her verbal assault on Draco. Jen and Draco both took a step away quickly.
.” Teddy’s face drops. “You can’t get angry with me. My godfather is the Griffin King. I’ll set him on you.” Teddy’s nose scrunches in disgust. “Ew! I don’t want to hear about you two in the bedroom. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ALLEYWAY?!” I try hard to hide my laughter behind my hand, and Teddy gives me a strange look, before passing me the phone.
"You won't. Because how many times have I told you simple things about me, and how many times have you ignored that? Do you not understand? I wasn't happy being with you. Yes, I was wrong to run off. But I'm so much happier with Draco than I ever was with you. Please just accept that whatever we had is over."
“I...” I begin, trailing off. “In my ass.” I say quietly. He steps forward again, placing his mug on the counter and brining me into a hug.
"You saw the way that officer was towards gang members. What's a better way to hide your crime than to be the officer investigating?"
"When you said you find me attractive-" the ravenhead called after Draco, who slammed the bedroom door shut between them in response.
”Yeah but when Seamus wants something he rarely gives up. Trust me.” I gave Draco a look which told him to explain. “We’ve had him in the station before, he had a thing for me. Guess it stopped when you came into the picture.”
"Dress code? It's The Burrow, dress code is wear clothes like a normal person." She rolled her eyes.
I let him finish it off, not much left in it anyway, and placed it in the ashtray on my bedside table. Straddling his lap, something deep in me began to get antsy and, before I knew it, I was starting to grind on him gently. He saw my movement and smiled at me.
”No, definitely not. Why, you on shark week?” He stops laughing when Neville slaps his arm. “Alright, Alright. He hasn’t told me this one for sure, but I reckon he has a bit of a daddy kink. As in, he likes to be called it, not calling others it.”
"I would too if you proposed with a silver ring," Draco rolled his eyes, not that Harry could see. Harry was grateful that the blond hadn't bothered to inquire with the 'why' which most people followed his statement with. "There, all done." He pulled back, towel in hand, just as a ping came from the kitchen behind them. Draco leaned forward and dropped the towel in Harry's lap, leaving to man on the floor for the kitchen.
“Before we go any further...” I pull my sleeve up, revealing one of my tattoos. It’s a triangle, with a circle inside of it and a line through the middle. “Most members tend to get this. It symbolises the strength, community and power of the gang. Apart they mean nothing, but together they have meaning.” I briefly explain. “I don’t know if you want it, but if you want to get it, you’ll have to hide it from your Gran.” Teddy purses his lips in thought.
”How are you so pure and yet so dirty?” He chuckles, slipping a hand under my panties to tug gently at the plug. I gasp at the action and tighten my grasp on my tea. “Well done for last night, baby. I’m so proud of you. It’s very hard to punish such a pain slut when we haven’t been together for long. Trust me, once I teach you the rest of it all, you’ll be perfectly behaved.” His praise warms me inside, and the rest of his speech sends a shiver down my back.
Draco wanted to laugh at how offended Harry looked, but he kept his resolve. He openly glanced down to the way Harry was practically - no, fully - straddling him. The ravenhead quickly moved back to the other side of the sofa, blushing brighter than Draco had ever seen him.
"Don't you DARE speak about him like that." I pressed harder against his throat. "I hope you don't get sent to prison. That way I can hurt you worse than what you did to him. And I know a few people who'd be willing to help me."
A week later and Draco hadn’t seen Pansy again. He didn’t doubt for a second that she would return. Despite being absent in his life for almost seven years, she had always,
"It's usually only busy for an hour, it should really calm down after that. Then there's another rush around four o'clock before it tapers off for the evening." Draco explained quickly to Harry, sliding a coffee onto the table as well as a small pastry. "Let me know if you need anything," he added over his shoulder as he headed behind the counter, an elderly couple walking into the café as he did.
When they got called into the room, the vet watched with a smile as Draco placed the cat on the table.
After he makes us breakfast - which is certainly something to see when he’s buck ass naked - he picks me up bridal style, earning a surprised squeak from me, before carrying me up to his room. He throws me onto his bed and pulls his hoodie off me. My nipples harden at the contact with the cold air and he growls, leaning down to take one in his mouth, rolling the bud between his teeth and he pinches the other between his fingers. I’m a gasping mess by now, hands lost between gripping the bedsheets and wrapping around him, holding him close. He pulls back, capturing my lips in a searing kiss as he rips my panties off me, throwing the torn fabric into a corner of the room without hesitation. I want to make a sound of disappointment at the torn underwear, but when his fingers begin to stroke me I can only moan into his mouth, undulating my hips.
I clambered into bed, unable to nap, let alone close my eyes, and simply lay and let the tears fall, wanting the comfort of my boyfriend but simultaneously wanting him to never have to see me again.
“So you’re the leader, huh?” Blondie raises an eyebrow. “The Griffin King. I’m honoured.” He drawls sarcastically.
When Draco did wake up, it wasn't long before the black ball of fur curled up next to him was awake too, excitedly mewing at the man.
”Me and my ex-wife tried it a couple times.” He shrugged nonchalantly. Dean looked surprised at this info. “Yeah, I get it. I’m old.”
“Draco and I are nowhere near the stage of having kids. We aren’t even properly together.” I brush him off.
My orgasm hits me, making my back arch as pleasure shoots through me and moans fall from my lips. Breath heavy, I fall asleep with his name on my lips.
“You’re just a plain old cat, aren’t you?” Draco sighed. James chirped. “Sorry, not plain. You’re an interesting cat, then. Just not a wizard in disguise, right?” Draco chuckled, scratching under James’ chin, earning him that loud purr again.
"Could you not have even done some wizarding work? Working with magical animals or plants doesn't always require using magic, and I remember in potions, lots of recipes don't require spells or runes," Neville offered. Draco spotted Blaise looking at him with something in his eye. Pride, perhaps.
“Just a vanilla cappuccino, thanks,” she smiled, digging in her bag for her purse. “Would you care to join me?”
He walked the short distance to the door just to the right of his cafe, heading up the stairs once inside and into his small, two storey house above the cafe.
”Hey Dean. Seamus? I didn’t expect to see you here.” The Irish boy looks up at me with a wonky smile.
“OK, I’m sorry. But I needed time to heal. You weren’t the only one who lost things in the war, you know. I lost my parents too. And yes, I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you, OK?”
Draco and I share a shower, touching each other intimately but non-sexually, soft kisses here and there as he massages my scalp. He lets me take control when I clean myself out, slightly annoyed I had done this before his cum dried in me, and he watched with a small chuckle at my annoyed expression.
”Keep your eyes on the road and shut up!” I yell lightheartedly. The two boys chuckle, but resume their own private conversation up front.
James meowed boldy, running over to him. Rather than waiting for Draco to pick him up, the small kitten began his own ascent of the stairs, slowly taking one at a time due to his small stature.
"Can't let you have all of it." I smile teasingly, before smoking some more. Draco goes about throwing clothes on, having to put on a hoodie that I'd borrowed from him a while back instead of his shirt, which was now tossed into the bin. He lay back on my bed, watching me as I walked about, still undressed, the blunt hanging from my lips. He motioned me over, and I clambered onto the bed, straddling his thighs. Feeling like I was treading on air, my head floating, I let Draco's hands brush down my sides, resting at my waist. I placed the blunt to his mouth, giggling as he struggled to take it from my hand with his mouth, and watched as he took a deep drag, keeping it between his lips as he blew the smoke up at my face, eliciting another giggle from me.
He slipped out of bed, leaving for the kitchen. Normally James - James? Harry? his flatmate? - would have been up, but perhaps a cat on the run is more of a light sleeper.
"Don't worry James," he shouted from where he stood, a light laugh in his voice, as the meowing continued. He spelled the small cuts closed, running his finger lightly over the small scars. They'd disappear in a day. "James?" He called once it went silent.
If we could finally find out who murdered Marcus, then perhaps the police force would stop looking down on us gangs. So many had been dragged into questioning, even my own people, when we all knew it was one of the officers. Only a handful of officers respected us because of our connections to them, and even then it wasn't only out of respect to their coworkers. Hell, maybe even finding out who the murderer was could bring the gangs closer. Show us that none of us were each others' enemy.
“Harry, please. Did something happen? Did Draco do this?” He shouted through my door. “Please Harry, we haven’t seen you all day. We’re worried.”
“Well... I woke up and had a shower. Then I had breakfast with Hermione and Neville - he’s made us pancakes. Not that you need to know that...”
I shrug. “Age aside, you obviously didn’t come just to drop my car off. I could have come to get it from the police station.” I lean against the wall opposite him.
”Hey Dad could I get the- Oh fuck shit sorry guys!” Scorp cries as he walks in on us. I try to pull away from Draco, but he’s insistent, dragging out the kiss. When he eventually pulls away, I bury my face into his arm and he hugs me against him. “I see everything went well then.” I can head the smirk in his voice,
Compared to the cafe downstairs, the floorspace of his house was nothing, with a kitchen and lounge on the first floor, and bedroom and bathroom on the floor above. But Draco managed, because he had worked hard for it, and he was glad he had something to show for it.
The rest of the drive was silent, and when we pulled up to my house I thanked him quietly and hurried inside.
I spent rest of the evening trying to act like nothing had happened despite everyone's concerns. Hermione shot me worried looks every few second, as did Luna, but I do my best to brush it off.
If any of you were confused, I aged Teddy up a fair bit. So, he’s 16, three years younger than Harry.
"They're the only colour that looks good on you. Other than blue, but that was dastardly cheap. Makes you worry what it was made from."
"Yes, and I thought I could deal with it. I thought maybe I could make you understand me if I kept telling you. But you ignored me, time after time. You wanted to rush into marriage and rush into having kids, and I didn't even know if you actually loved me."
"Ok, Ok, I'll help you. Give me a few minutes to finish cleaning up and I'll sort you out." He sighed, looking around the cafe for a second. "You trust me?" He asked, holding both hands out to the kitten. It sniffed them for a second, bumping its nose against his middle finger affectionately. "Alright, up we go," he said gently, picking up the cat as softly as he could. He took the cat through to his office, grabbing a tea towel from the kitchen on the way through, using it to make a makeshift cat bed on his office chair.
"Oh, thank you so much Harry!" She pulled me in for a hug that was too tight, and as she let me go, pressed a lingering kiss to my cheek. "I'll see you around." She winked, before leaving the eastate. All I could do was stare at where she had been standing, unsure of what happened.
“I know, mother. Scorp told me you two were coming about half an hour ago. I didn’t have time.” My boyfriend defends.
"Print out some posters. If no one comes back after a few days, give it to a shelter or take it in. You might want this," she grabbed a strange sheet of plastic from a shelf. "It's a cone, in case he starts licking his wounds."
“It’s my right to decide whether or not I tell him. And if he never finds out, then I can pretend like it never happened, he won’t look at me like I’m a piece of shit and everything will be normal.” Blaise was silent for a minute.
Harry and Dean exchanged knowing looks, Hermione had hell of a good influence on Ron, he is beginning to be mature for once.
Harry was trying to find the right words to describe the beautiful creature in front of him. His fellow Gryffindor had cut his obnoxiously long dark-brown hair and replaced it with small curls, that reminded Harry of his younger days at Hogwarts. He had shaved the small stumps of hair on his chin and left it perfectly clean. “Wow-” Was the only thing Harry could say at the moment, completely star-struck.
Harry nodded slowly not really understanding what she meant by magicum nuntius and why she was so kind to him all of a sudden…
The raven-haired half-blood aperated straight into his flat from the nearest apparition point. Dean didn’t even flinch from the loud noise that filled their lovely living room. “Hey, Harry.” He said blankly, not looking up from his phone.
Ron nodded and leaned forward to grab Harry in a tight hug. The hug didn’t last more than five seconds before Harry broke away, his face was a little pink, he just hoped his skin tone was on his good side, masked his embarrassment a little. “And for your record, you are still family Harry-” Ron said softly. “Nothing between us has changed from me coming here this morning and Dean accidentally coming out, for you.” He stopped like he was thinking about something important. “So- are you and Dean.”
Harry tried to stay calm, clutching his hands into fists, and digging his nails deep into his palms. “Mrs Malfoy.” He nodded and tried to smile. It didn’t turn out as fake as he would have thought. “So- ehm, you're working here ey?” She nodded politely, showing with her whole being that she didn’t find this conversation comfortable at all. Harry didn’t know what else to say so he went quiet for a while as the lady examined him. “Ehm- Why are there wizarding-”
Harry felt Dean wake up beside him because the brunette quickly stood up on his elbows staring furiously at Ron’s confused expression. “Do you have a problem with us sleeping in the same bed?!” Dean began angrily. “And for your notice- no we didn’t have sex.”
Harry nearly ran out of the house hoping he wouldn’t have to talk with anyone else, he didn’t have the time for Ginny’s partners or Ginny or Bill’s stupid birthday party.
Narcissa nodded as he spoke. “Uh- Draco…” She said more to herself than Harry. He didn’t quite understand what Ferret had to do with all this, he just hoped it wasn’t something of the things he used to do- “I’ll show you.”
Harry had to hold back a sneer and try his best not to roll his eyes. “So?” Harry said confused, beginning to feel slightly annoyed with this whole situation. “Isn’t his birthday in a month?”
Ron rolled his eyes. “For that comment, you have to complete your assignment on muggle-police due- let us say the 15th?” Ron smirked leaning against the doorframe.
Harry walked inside of the grandiose library, the book filled walls were nearly as tall as in The Great Hall. A wave of nostalgia hit him as he looked around, he remembered Hogwarts- it was long, so long ago. Harry sighed and went to the nearest bookshelf to pick up a random book, he froze when he saw the green cover; Quidditch through the ages. Harry didn’t have time to freak out before a familiar voice hit his ear, a voice he hadn’t heard in such a long time- It was like he was thrown back to the dark forest, to all the suffering, to all the death that happened that night…
“Because I care about you!” Ron screamed. “And by the way, we joined the Auror program together, I just- don’t fire you guys-” The ginger scratched his head trying to calm himself down. Ron sigh and continued calmly “Sorry I let my anger out on you.” He collapsed in his dark-red leather chair.
Harry looked at his friend with a smile. “As I said- Yes I am. Don’t worry about it alright, everyone makes mistakes.”
He felt his cheeks burn, he had actually fallen asleep with Dean right beside him, in not a very friendly type of way.
The half-blood wizard frowned, tossing his warm and cosy blanket aside, and immediately regretting it. Harry lifted his legs down from the bed and onto the cold floor, he felt a slight shivering going up from the spot his bare feet had touched the floor.
“No!” Harry cut Ron off before he could finish his sentence. “No we are not- I just had a nightmare.” Ron nodded, smiled, and disappeared behind the big wooden door. He had already woken up both Harry and Dean, his mission was accomplished.
“No, he was not.” Ron stood up from the table placing both his hands on the part of the table that was not covered in paper. “He was in Slytherin, yes, but he wasn’t a bloody death eater, as you so kindly pointed out. Yes, he was in Slytherin at a bad time, but that does not mean that he is evil! Now can you please move your arse from my table and return to your work?”
Ron frowned following his friend in the bathroom and watching him pour toothpaste on his toothbrush. “It’s Hermione.”
“I read the papers.” When Narcissa saw Harry’s smile her worried expression quickly faded. She smiled awkwardly and began to expeditiously move towards the other end of the library, where Harry assumed the books should be. “Here are our books from the 13th hundred to 14th hundred.” She gestured at the stalls, moving her hands and pointing to each stall.
Narcissa smiled politely pulling out her wand from her little green waist bag, it matched perfectly with her grey shirt and black trousers- her dark cores were a real contrast from her bleached blond hair. It all fitted so perfectly together, if Harry didn’t know she was married or thirty years older than him, he would probably have asked her out.
“Come on, don’t be like that.” Harry smirked, punching Dean in return, who just rolled his eyes and walked back to his room again. “Bye-” He shouted as Dean smelled the door close.
Harry had finally given up trying to come up with excuses to ‘not leave’ the house. Ron had practically been living in 12 Grimmauld Place just to make sure Harry and Dean didn’t stay in their bed the whole day.
Harry thought about what Dean was saying, he had been in love with Ginny, but of course, it was the fact that he knew he liked men. “Could we talk about this later?” Harry asked nervously, he really didn’t want to spend his day wondering about his sexuality, when he already had decided not to think too much about it.
The two Gryffindors were sitting beside the kitchen table, sipping their boiling hot coffee, Harry usually had Cappuccino or just black coffee with milk; it helped him concentrate on things at work, but not enough to make him filled with energy. Dean, on the other hand, was a whole different nut to crack, you never knew what he actually wanted, it could be a cold Late or two Espresso shots; depending on what mood he was in.  This Wednesday morning Dean was going for; two espresso shots.
Harry could see why Malfoy liked his mother so much, she was actually very attractive when she smiled. “This is one of the main London libraries.” She began professionally. “Not only is this building full of non-magical books, but we also have a big collection of wizarding once. Would you like me to show you- or perhaps someone else?” Her pale white cheks, got a slight pink colour, Harry noted that Malfoy blushed in the same way; maybe this was a family thing?-
“Look.” Ron folded his hands on the table, looking straight at Harry. “I can’t say that I’m not worried, but I trust Sarah, and if she really thinks that Zabini is capable of the job- then- I think we should believe her.”
Harry nodded in agreement unwillingly returning his gaze to the woman beside him. “Yeah-” He stopped for a second to read her expression, it was soft, and loving… “I’m working on an assignment for the Aurors about the zodiac killer and how the muggle police handled the situation, the rest is classified- but it has something to do with Arthur Leigh Allen’s choice of code.” Harry cleared his throat, having to bite the inner of his lip from spilling all the information- it was fun to talk about work with someone who had no clue about what he actually has been doing.
Harry looked up at him confused. “How could I have a date, Thomas?” Harry chuckled before continuing. “I’m going to the muggle-library, and- maybe- just maybe there will be some hot people there…” He rubbed the back of his neck, viciously. “You said I should always look-”
Harry felt slightly touched that Dean was so happy with bullying him- who would have thought that making fun of other people could help you deal with breakups.
Ron reacted in the exact same way Harry had expected. When the two of them walked inside of his big office Ron lost all the paper he had held in his hands just a second ago, and rushed towards them with questions like what happened?! Or Harry, how did you force him to change his hair? Dean just stood there, a little concerned for his own appearance before his transformation at this point.
“Alright team, you are lucky today.” Ron started talking, as he always did in the mornings around breakfast. “You will not have to show up at work until eleven o’clock since some newcomers will have their tour today.”
Harry quickly let his hands slide back to his own side as Ginny drawled herself back from him. “What are you going here?” He asked artificially, it was too loud and sharp to be his natural voice.
“Fetch Dean here a cup of earl grey, dear.” She disappeared instantly but Harry saw her smile before she departed.
Ron took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes tiredly, he had begun to wear them after getting the job as head Auror, the amount of paperwork he had to handle could kill every man's eyesight. ”Harry for starters I didn’t give out the jobs, that was Sarah’s job. Second of all, I really think that we should lay all this war crap behind us, I don’t see a point in fighting about it anymore.”
“I just don’t get it, why does she wanna get married, we have briefly been dating for a year. The war is over- we don’t have to rush anything.” Ron complained sitting down on the toilet seat lid.
“What’s so funny?” Ron exclaimed, looking in between the two guys. “I do not sound like Herman!” He finally understood what they were laughing about.
Harry heard frustration sounds coming from downstairs like someone was about to destroy the house. That, someone, was Ron- Ron was trying to get the door open. Kind, loving, caring Maissa must have locked it so he had to talk to Harry. “You are overreacting,” Harry said low, as he approached the door.
He was rudely interrupted by a loud voice coming from the fireplace. “Oi! You two, stop snigging, I’m here.” Harry grimed at the face in the fireplace. He didn’t let go of Dean only sat up straighter, still one arm around the brunette’s shoulders. The boys and looked at George’s happy face and then at the service they had forgotten Maisse had placed in front of them.
Harry spitted in the sink, washed his toothbrush, and looked up at his auburn-haired friend. “Come on, you are so in love,” Harry smirked. That smirk led to being hit by toilet-paper, so Harry understood that Ron was annoyed with his snarky comment. “Come on!” Harry continued walking out from the bathroom, away from the toilet-paper-throwing-ginger. “I want to see the wedding. I also wanna see some ginger-haired, almond skinned babies.”
Harry followed Narcissa’s example, pulling out his wand from his inner pocket. “Magicum nuntius.” The lady said low, tapping his wand once with hers. She smiled, proud of herself putting away her wand rapidly. “You have about 15 minutes to choose what you need from here, then your wand will point you in the direction of the DVD.”
“Shit!” George exclaimed, looking back at the boys again. “I’m just warning you.” After those words, George’s red face disappeared back to, wherever he was calling from. The flames looked normal again and Harry felt Dean relax instantly.
Ginny rolled her eyes at Harry and turned back to her, partner? “Let’s go to Ron’s room and make out? Huh-” She sent Harry an annoyed look and turned her partner around, but not without Harry noticing how hard Luna blushed.
Harry said softly, sending the pureblood witch a warm smile. “Thank you- for everything.” He could see her grey eyes shining brighter as she nodded and walked away.
After some time Hary finally got how the screen worked- he had to place a black, small box beside the wide black screen, tap on the little round button and place the weird circle inside. Dean, who had a tv at home with his parents, just laughed at Harry’s failing attempts to get the tv to work.
Narcissa led the way up some small stairs, they looked really old, but the colour was still there. She stopped beside the smaller bookshelves on the wall and pointed at a small trail of books. “These are the ones about this exact case, and this one.” She pointed at a smaller white book. “Is the screenplay of the movie. If you would like to watch it I could send you the directions by magicum nuntius?”
It had been seven years after the war and six after Harry James Potter, The Boy Who Lived, saviour of the wizarding world, the Daily Profits favourite subject had left Hogwarts. Now was the Golden Boy laying in his bed, trying to ignore his best friend's energetic verbal attempts to drag him out of bed.
“Come on Harry-” Dean hurried after him. “Where are you going? Do you have a date?” When Harry didn’t answer both of his questions, he grabbed his friend by the elbow to twist him around. “Do you have a date then?”
As the evening came around Harry finally crawled out of his room and went down for a snack. He kind of hoped that Dean would show up, but he didn’t- in fact, Harry didn’t see his fellow Gryffindor for the rest of the night.
“Maissa,” Harry said calmly. The diligent house-elf appeared instantly. “Could you be so kind and open the door for Ronald?”
The half-blood jumped from the table and stood, arms crossed. “I knew that this position would change you, I was right, wasn’t I?!” Harry said with disbelief, he must have sounded like a baby, but he didn’t care, he was done with accepting that Ron treated him like he was something that needed help or guidance. “You promised it wouldn’t change anything between us, and here you are acting all bossy, and high upon yourself!”
Ron’s secretary Alvin, asked Harry immediately as he walked out what all the noise was about. Harry just told him he and Ron had a disagreement about the home situation. As Alvin knew that Harry and Mr Weasly were friends and he didn’t want to get in trouble with either his boss or The Boy Who Lived, he instantly shutted up and went behind his desk again.
She looked down at her white jelly’s, slightly embarrassed, but nodded. Harry heard a little click from the door, meaning it had been opened. Surprisingly, Ron didn’t move from his previous spot but turned his gaze to Harry. “Why didn’t you tell me-” He said low, he looked rather sad than angry.
“I wasn’t sure yet, I'm still confused alright!” Harry said, a little too loud that was expected to be normal. He stood up straight and ran a hand through his morning messy hair.
“Don’t go, Harry.” A soprano but soft voice came from behind him, it made him twirl around rapidly, his wand at the ready. “It’s just me.”  Luna laid a hand on his shoulder making him twitch. She quickly drew it away when she saw how the raven reacted.
The half-hour goes by in a wreck of blood and murder. Until Harry couldn’t watch it anymore- when another jumpscare happened, he tossed the controller into the screen with a flick of his wand, making it shatter in a thousand pieces, leaving behind a rectangle hole on the dark display.
Harry sent her a look of disbelief. “If you don’t mind-” He smiled, stepping back as her white arm reached for the book he had just placed back to, where he thought it belonged.
“Harry?” He screamed from downstairs. Harry heard footsteps running up to his room. “Did you need something mate?” Dean’s happy face appeared through the opening.
The big dark brown shelves had a slightly weird power coming from them that Harry didn’t quite understand, they looked completely normal, but something about them reminded him of magic, of mystery, of his first ever home- The enormous wooden creations touched the ceiling, like it was a part of the wall, it forcing Harry to look up. The ceiling looked wonderful with golden marks around the big round window in the middle.
The two boys sat in silence, just hugging each other. Harry broke the silence first, clearing his throat before speaking. “Do you wanna-”
Ten minutes later was Harry fully dressed in fancy black trousers, a dark green sweatshirt matching his emerald eyes, and a nice white shirt with the edges tucked over the sweatshirt. He hadn’t actually ever cared what he was wearing, but Dean had forced him to dress appropriately so he could get a nice shag after a drunken night.
“Schedule has changed.” Ron moved his eyebrow up a bit, still smirking. “I’m looking forward to seeing you both today at eleven.” He waved his hand and disapparated.
“For starters, no, absolutely not, I’m not gonna settle down at age 25, and definitely not have kids,” Ron stated, marching out of the room to wake up Dean, giving Harry a free space to change.
The weird vibrating began to fade away as he got closer to the DVD section. Harry finally found the right one, and just on instinct pressed his wand at the cover.  Harry’s wand Instantly stopped vibrating and fell still in his hand.
“We are planning Bill’s birthday party, I thought you’d come.” Luna said vaguely. Her girlfriend tucked her arm around her waist as she blushed and looked down at her.
“Harry-” A very tired and slightly annoyed Ronald Weasly exclaimed. “I will not-” Harry could note that he said the word not very harshly. “I will not spend more time here than I did yesterday! Either you get your lazy arse out of the bed or I’m gonna curse you, and you know I can, don’t you dare try me!”
Not only the smell of the library reminded Harry of Hogwarts, but the whole place was filled with magic and history that it was overwhelming.
“Your right.” Harry sigh and stood up to go out of the room, he didn’t want to argue more with Ron, he did his best.
Harry continued to stroke the dark-skinned boy’s head, softly playing with his curls. “Do you wanna watch a psychopath, ala murder movie?”
Harry quickly sat beside Dean on the cough folding an arm around his shoulders. He shook him a little to bring the boy back to reality. “Did he cancel again?” The raven asked softly. Dean nodded and placed his head on Harry's shoulder, tossing his phone away. Harry began patting Dean’s head and fingering with his dark curls. “I thought you had a thing going on?”
“Of course not! Sarah Garcia, will pick out some of the new ones and give them basic knowledge on how we work here, then when Bill is back he will take another group, but of course, that would not happen until next year. But we have many candidates so space could be a real issue.”
“Don’t forget to begin your research on muggle police.” Ron grinned at Harry’s back. He ginger got a middle finger in return as Harry walked out and slammed the door.
“Hi, Ginny.” Harry pressed out not wanting to meet her blue diamond eyes. “I’m just gonna-” He nearly ran towards the door to get away from the happy couple.
“No!” The other said loudly. “No, of course not, I only mean to say that, maybe you like both, that’s also a thing you know…”
Harry sat down, on the chair in front of Ron’s table, a little embarrassed that he had reacted in such a way. “No, I'm sorry I shouldn’t have burst in like this. Your right, you're completely right.” He laid his forehead on the table, steadying his breathing.
“He is a muggle- what did you expect?” He answered softly, still stroking the fellow Gryffindor’s head.
Dean's scared expression quickly turned into relief and Harry was hugged for the second time that day.
“Hi harry.” Ginny jumped on him, gripping him into a tight hug. Harry laid awkwardly his arms around her waist, Luna didn’t seem to bother at all.
“What can Maissa do for master Harry?” She bowed her bald little head slightly down, and then quickly up to look in her master’s eyes. The house-elf was wearing a nice light blue dress. Harry had actually insisted on giving her clothes after someone had sent him her as a gift. She didn’t have to work for him, or even talk politely, but she had been trained to do so by her previous masters, and it seemed that she didn’t mind helping Creature around the house.
Harry decided not to aperate inside of The Maughan Library since it was in fact only for muggles. So the half-blood decided to take the flue network to Ron’s and just walk, happily, Ron didn’t live far from the library.
“Yeah, it’s beautiful,” Narcissa whispered from beside him. These three words snapped Harry back to reality from the path of nostalgia he was going down.
Harry went to sit by his own desk, getting quite annoyed with people coming up to Dean to congratulate him on his new hairstyle.
“Just wow,” Harry muttered before, finally, looking away from his friend. “You look bloody amazing mate.” He exclaimed. “Wait until Ron sees you.”
“I’m working on a case, I’m an Auror you know.” He felt the urge to add, maybe she didn’t read the papers, or maybe Narcissa despised him so much that she skipped ahead each time she saw his name in it…
“You know what!” Harry began standing up from his chair. “Maybe suggesting my best friend as the head of Auror wasn’t such a good idea after all!”
Dean didn’t let him finish before bursting out in a peal of fake hysterical laughter. “Hot dudes at the library?” He punished Harry's tense shoulder. “Are you kidding with me? You should go to a bar, seriously Harry.”
The rest of the day couldn’t get better for Harry James Potter, he was sent multiple fan-letters, he had two undone reports, and that’s not including the one Ron had shorted the time on. So when Harry flued back home he didn’t stay there for long, he had to change from his usual dark red robes into, something more ‘muggle-friendly’.
“What the hell happened here?!” Ron’s loud voice woke Harry up rabidly from his peaceful sleep. “When did you have the time to get together?!”
Dean sigh and chuckled, “Harry- Of course, you do, you know green is your colour right? You should stop wearing red all the time.”
“What the hell am I supposed to do then?!” Ron shouted, beginning to get mad at his fellow Gryffindor. “I’m trying to be a good leader here. When I hire someone, it’s not because you have to like them, or because they are my best friend, but it’s because they are the best person for the job!”
Harry interrupted her before she could finish saying sorry. “You are an angel. Thank you Maisse.” The house-elf smiled proudly and vanished.
“Cut out the bullshit Ron.” Harry answered annoyed, placing his arse on the table. “Why did you let Zabini on the team?! Have you seen him even once break a curse and not throw it?!”
Harry shrugged, "gut instinct. Got me through life, really. I finished late at work anyway and no one's at home waiting for me so," he shrugged again.
”Why don’t you give it a try, Dean? Just once. And if you don’t like it, we can get you a restraining order for Seamus.” He offered, ever the negotiator.
“Officer Goyle, I think Officer Crabbe was looking for you.” Blondie ignores my existence, but thankfully ‘Goyle’ gets up and leaves. Blondie takes his place. He studies me for a second, and I realise now I must look like shit. I’d gone straight from working in the garage to the deal, so my face was still dirty. Blondie sees the card on the table – my driving license – and picks it up.
”Oh, what a lovely name!” Millie spoke, her voice light with good intention. “Like the flower? My mother used to love narcissus flowers!” Draco felt easier that his mother seemed to relax at this, smiling along and chattering away for a minute or so.
“Please.” I whisper, feeling my second orgasm of the day nearing. I can feel him grin against my skin as a hand slips into my boxers and he rubs at my clit. My breath quickens and he begins to assault my neck with bites and kisses, no doubt leaving an array of marks. “I’m going to...” I say, breathless.
“Not to sound sappy, but I like to think I’m good friend material.” She offered with a grin. “Plus I can get you free flea treatment for James,” she whispered.
“Blaise wants to meet...” he mumbled, sitting at the kitchen table. James jumped down from where he was sitting as Draco continued thinking aloud. “3 o’clock at the Leaky Cauldron. Reckon I should go, James?”
As I chatted with Charlie, and eventually the rest of the family, I felt more relaxed. The other day's events weren't at the forefront of my mind, for once. When we sat down for dinner, it was chaotic. Eleven of us cramped around a long table, plates piled high with food. Us Griffins were sat at one end, and I was sat next to Charlie. We were all a little cramped, but it was like being back with family.
”Please... suck my dick. Please daddy!” I hadn’t meant to let the last word slip, but the fire that blazed through his eyes as he sent me a lustful gaze told me I had just pressed the right button.
”Fine.” I whisper. “You were right.” He grabs my hand and pulls me close, before pressing his lips to mine. I kiss him back with vigor and wrap my arms around his neck. I jump and wrap my legs around his waist, his hands grabbing my thighs. He pushes me against the wall making a thud as his tongue enter s myth mouth. I feel myself get aroused and I can feel him straining against his trousers. I pull back and look into his eyes, which are clouded with lust.
“Wasn’t expecting that.” I manage to replying, a bit shocked at his question. “Could have asked that a bit more tactfully, Malfoy, but go off.”
"Harry," she started. I looked at her, mouth full of cereal. "You know if anything were to happen, you can always talk to me. We've been friends since high school, and we've saved each other's asses countless times. I'll always be here for you, you know that, right?" I nodded, swallowing. "Ok." And with that, she left the room.
“James is an odd cat. Doesn’t use his litter tray, always goes outside where I can’t see him, never uses his bed, always sleep on mine, even when I’m in it. Plus he doesn’t care for his toys. Honestly sometimes I think he’s more interested in the TV.”
"Uh, cat?" He called, poking his head out of the room. He saw the black kitten standing on the bottom shelf of his coffee table, peering out under it at him with a mischevious look in its eyes. "You want something to eat?" He asked and, in reply, the cat mewed, before bounding over as best as it could, the limp more prominent with speed.
“I should hope so,” she muttered. Draco raised an eyebrow. “Oh.” Was all she said. She glanced at Draco, at James, then back at Draco. “Never mind! Ignore me.”
He woke the nest morning to a small weight on his chest, opening his eyes to see James sitting on him, waiting for him to wake up.
“You wouldn’t need to ask that if you knew what’s good for you.” I smirk, ruffling his hair before walking up the street to the main house where I lived. Parked outside is a small Fiat that I don’t recognise as one of the gang’s, so when I enter my house I’m cautious.
“That was weird,” was all she said from where she sat on his armchair. “You’ve got to admit, he does look a little bit like Potter.”
“Hey, don’t be embarrassed. It’s a perfectly normal question and it’s fine if you’re unsure about these things. We’ll go at your pace, yeah?” I lean back slightly, standing on my tip toes to press my lips to his. He returns the kiss with passion, bringing one hand to cup my jaw as his tongue slips into myself mouth. He presses me against the counter, grinding his hard cock against me as my hands slip into his locks, pulling him closer. I moan into his mouth and he moves to nip and tug at my earlobe, pressing kisses on my jawline along the way. “You’re so fucking hot.” He says, lips against my ear. “Can’t wait to bend you over and fill your tight ass.” I moan at his words, pressing harder against him.
"He does, actually." Harry spared Draco a small glance which Draco savoured. "He loves me more than you ever did, I think."
He headed down to the lower floor of his flat, making sure James was with him - not that he offered much in the way of protection - and buzzed his guest in, waiting a few seconds for them to begin knocking at his other front door.
“Yes, but I’d also like to think of myself as a bit of a size queen, so we’ll have to see what happens when you take those pants off.” I quirk my eyebrow. “I’ll see you around.” I bid him farewell and, after giving my ass small squeeze, he heads out the door. I don’t wait to watch him drive off, simply slamming the door and heading into the lounge to see my friends.
He brushed away a couple hairs which had fallen onto Draco's face, the man's eyes fluttering open as he did. The calm expression left his face for an angry one, one which Harry knew to not believe.
"Where do you work? The tabloids were all over us when we finished school, which of course I ignored. I never found out what you did."
A few hours later, the two entered Draco's café just before the busy lunch rush. Harry situated himself in a window seat, tucked away in the corner, as Draco got ready for the busy shift ahead.
“Listen here, Zabini.” I begin, ignoring Blondie. “You better remember who Neville’s family is. You break his heart or hurt him in anyway and I’ll slit your throat myself.” Blaise, of course, doesn’t think I’m being reasonable and immediately goes into cop mode.
They gave me a ride there, Gin and Luna going in a separate car. The drive was a couple hours, but I was glad to finally spend some time with just Ron and Hermione. We'd been friends since the first bus ride to school, and had been by each others' sides ever since.
Harry blushed, nodded, and settled into the seat a little more. He waited until he saw a more approving look on Draco's face before answering.
Despite my best efforts, Neville still saw them and swore loudly. I hid in my room, locking the door.
He grabbed his wand and rushed into the bathroom, leaving James sat on the bed, meowing apologetically after him.
in what they do wouldn't have needed any details of Harry's evening - other than his whereabouts - unless further evidence required it. But you're just a bigoted piece of
”How’ve you been?” He asks genuinely, sitting on the edge of my bed. His legs are spread and his hands prop him up behind him.
”Draco,” she smiled motherly, but he didn’t feel the love it was supposed to exude. “Who’s this lovely lady?”
"Please, daddy." I moaned as he avoided my sex for what seemed like the hundredth time. "Daddy please just touch me!" The last part was a little louder, perhaps too loud, but it got his attention.
James meowed in a way that sounded sad, like he too wanted to spend the day with just Draco, as Draco let out a small groan of frustration. It might have been his birthday, but he hoped no other bugger knew it.
"Baby, can I hug you?" I asked quietly. He nodded. I wrapped my arms around him, slightly higher than I normally did so I wasn't putting pressure on the bruises on his torso. "Harry, I haven't felt about someone the way I feel about you in a very long time. Trust me when I say that I want you. I would never want to leave you."
"Before you ask, no, he hasn't jumped me. Hasn't even tried to kiss me." 'Not properly, anyway' Draco could tell Harry wanted to add.
I shrugged it off. "That's alright Molly. Often bullies project their own problems onto others," I shot back, glaring at the twins. They looked proud of me, Fred nodding as George gave me a thumbs up.
James then curled up into Draco's side and Draco curled an arm around the kitten protectively, the cat's purring the only noise between the two of them. Aside from the occasional roar of thunder which made James tense up, the two remained curled up next to each other until the storm passed and the house flickered back to life.
"No, I was just... perusing while I was waiting. I can't really picture you as a fan of anyone other than Wilde though," he added with a smile.
"After all I've done for you, I hope you aren't running away," he chuckled as he let it out his flat, following it down the stairs to let it out onto the street. He leant in the doorway, cupping his mug, as his eyes followed the cat to the small woodland area across the street. Small was an understatement; it was a tiny gathering of trees at the edge of a playpark for kids.
"Parents are in a serial killer's cult and now you sell medicine," Harry said in a mocking tone. Draco frowned and shoved Harry's leg with his foot.
"And you're stood in your doorway because...?" As she trailed off her question, the black cat came running back over, brushing against Draco's legs. Melissa aw-ed, but Draco bid farewell, promising to explain later, and heading into his house again.
"Yeah, he. And if you do keep him, register him here and we can get him neutered. Although, given that he's so young, that might not be for a while."
”I’m Harry, Draco’s boyfriend.” I introduce, holding out a hand. Ignoring that, both women bring me into a tight hug and I’m taken by surprise.
”I think it’s time you showed me that surprise of yours, baby.” He remarks, loud enough for the two boys to hear. I press kisses to his face as he carries us upstairs to his room.
Draco was sat on the sofa deep in thought when Harry reentered the living room, now donning a pair of emerald green, tailor-made pyjamas, probably silk. Both the trousers and the top were too long for Harry, meaning he'd had to roll up the sleeves and the legs.
”I’ve got a surprise for you later, daddy.” I say, before softly pressing my lips to his. “You could call it a thank you for this evening.”
“We think his name is James, so there’s that. No one’s come forward yet, so I think I might keep him. And his leg’s much better now, thank you. Didn’t have to use the cone, though.” He shrugged.
“Come for me, baby.” My orgasm hits me almost immediately after, and my grip on his hair tightens as it rolls through me. “So good for me.” He whispers. “Such a good boy. So proud of you.” Again, the warmth fills me at the praise and I lean back to give him a tired smile. He pecks me on the forehead, before pulling away to rinse his hands in the sink. I give his crotch a glance, which is still rock hard. I go over to him and place a hand on his covered cock, before going to undo his trousers. “Don’t worry about me, baby boy. I’ll be fine.” I stop, and pull my hand back.
When I wake, I'm alone in Draco's bed and there's a heavy throbbing in my lower back. I sit up slowly, feeling something disgusting in my ass. I wish I'd showered after last night. I hobble over to the en-suite, showering quickly and cleaning out my sore hole. When it comes to dressing, I get lazy and throw on my thong and his shirt from last night, running my hands through my hair before heading cautiously downstairs. In the kitchen, I smell fresh coffee and cooked breakfast, and can hear the radio playing lgiht, joyful songs. I stop in my tracks, but my footsteps have already caught the person's attention. Draco appears in the doorway, smiling when he sees what I'm wearing.
”You look ravishing tonight, baby.” He winks, before the three of us climbed into his car and went to his house. It was fairly large, in an expensive looking suburban area. The inside was  well decorated yet minimalistic, and little colour around the house. “I’ve ordered in. Dinner will be served in a few minutes, but Teddy if you want, Scorp’s room is third on the left upstairs.” The boy nods, running off the greet Draco’s son. I follow Draco into the kitchen and he begins placing plates on the marble counter of the island. I lean up and press a gentle kiss to the back of his neck, getting his attention.
"Morning," he replied, raising an eyebrow. She stepped in uninvited, hugging him lightly before pressing a kiss to each cheek. Draco felt James tense up, making him smile.
"Ok, Tyler, I'm going to go in with the swab now. If you begin to feel nervous, I want you to concentrate on keeping your breathing steady. Officer Zabini is here if you need him, OK? Anything you say here won't leave this room. You can trust us." As she leant in, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked up to Blaise. His eyes said everything. I shook my head at him.
speak like that to these people. Police officers are supposed to support the community and enforce the law, arresting and convicting when there's evidence to prove it. But you," he shoved her back further, "come in here, accusing them of being drug dealers and of murdering others. You come here, calling them scum and pushing an interrogation too far. The nature of Harry's relationship has no bearing on your investigation into Marcus' murder, a
On one such occasion, Draco almost spat out his drink when he saw the last person he expected to walk through into his café. She waved to the barista before scanning the café, heading straight to where her son was sitting.
“Oh, sure.” She replied, sarcasm dripping from her voice. “James is a real cat, you don’t want to shag Harry, and Nifflers can fly!” She crossed her arms, raising an eyebrow at him. “Well, don’t make me say I told you so when this all goes tits up!”
Draco led his mother up to his flat, neither of them talking on the way. He didn’t even need to call for the cat when he entered, James instead bounding up to him regardless, brushing up against his legs and purring to his owner.
“Your car, Potter. Thought you’d like it back.” He stepped forward into the household, placing my keys into my hand. “Sorry about Zabini. When he sees something he likes, he doesn’t waste time.” He says, leaning down to whisper into my ear. I look past him, and see that Neville has began to drag the other man upstairs, to his room no doubt. “Don’t worry. We’re not working today.”
Red and blue lights flash throughout the room and, thinking it’ lighting effects, everyone cheers and begins to dance with more rigour, but the noise of the front door crashing in sends the people into drunken panic. I laugh and continue dancing. No one can harm the Griffin King.
"See? Wasn't so bad, was it?" Draco said, stroking James to wake him. He woke quickly, poking his head up from where he was curled into a ball. "You're ok now," Draco smiled.
Draco spun on his heel and headed to his room, with Harry quickly gathering his thoughts and scrambling to catch up with the blond.
I ignored everyone and showered immediately. I don’t know how long I spent in there, scrubbing at my skin until it was almost bleeding and I was staring at my bruises with tears running down my face. There were more dotted along my hips and thighs.
“Baby I love your tiny dick. So hard for me.” He whispers, before diving back in. Warmth swells up inside me at his comment and I smile. Feeling the familiar heat of my climax growing in me, I let out a soft moan for him.
When we got home, I was happy I'd gone. It had, for the most part, been a welcome distraction. And being surrounded with family had reminded me how much I missed them.
Just as Draco switched on the light in his room, it went out. The whole flat seemed to grow darker. He fumbled his way to his dresser, swapping out his mug of tea for his wand, casting a soft lumos to light the room.
”No like, blood stuff?” I ask. I hope not. I don’t want any knives near my skin. Blaise shakes his head with a chuckle.
I grabbed a bowl from a cupboard, hoping she hadn't noticed the sleeves from the jacket slip down a little, and sat down to eat.
towel while I was still there. May I point out that you’re a very lucky boy, Harry.” Finnegan winks. “My man won’t even undress in front of me.” He huffs.
"Officer Zabini is fine," I tried to smile back. Blaise was looking at me with a face full of emotions. The doctor returned to her station between my legs, and Blaise made his way to my side.
“He said he hurt Draco and ran away like a coward, had no idea if Draco even lived, he said. I can't protect that.”
“Dementors are not born exactly. They're more. . . . ..brought into being.” he said.  His eyes were still trained on the boat house, switching between the door and the dementor hovering above it.
“And four arms and four legs.” he confirmed, pointing out the shapes for his father who was still hovered closely. His mum hadn’t stopped staring at the twins, rubbing their fine strawberry blonde hair.
“Actually,” Draco cleared his throat “twins runs in the bearers' side. Ginevra may have twins one day. Your grandmother was a Black Mrs. Weasley. As was mine.”
Draco didn't move any faster, every once in a while he would stop and peer at a- peer down Harry corrected himself firmly- Harry could see his shoulders shaking harder and harder each time he moved on.
“See sweetheart this is why I'm saying you need to come. I don't want them to have another reason not to like you.” Harry reached for his hands but Mafoy stepped away from him. He frowned at him. “What now Draco? We need to get ready to go. You’ll have to change, it's a formal anniversary party tonight so we’ll need your dress robes. I'm sure whatever you had planned on wearing to the gala will be ok.”
Ron nodded, he knew how specialized wards had to be in order to allow electronics and he wasn't surprised his parents never had theirs updated.
Ron frowned wondering what they needed to carry. Their bags had been shrunken down and were in Ron’s pocket.
There was no way Harry could wait another second to get out of there with him. He got up and threw some money down on the table startling Malfoy.
“Blimey,” came a voice next to where he and Hermione stood. Harry turned and saw Ron, together with most of the Weasleys, Neville, Luna, and Dean.
“We don't need your boy, just the two of you. We saw where his allegiance lay and who’s wand defeated your lord. I don't think for a minute anything he did wrong here was his idea.” he said with a glare towards Malfoy Sr.
The Weasley anniversary party was winding down as it began nearing eleven. All the siblings and their significant others were laid out around the living room with Mr and Mrs Wealey sharing a large love seat.
“Right then, good luck with him Harry.” Kingsley told him with a wink, before disapparating on the spot leaving Harry alone.
Mrs. Malfoy came to Harry holding an envelope. Harry took it and what looked like another vile of memories. Both had Draco’s name on them in the Half Blood Prince’s handwriting.
As always, she made the decision for him, moving more swiftly than he would have thought she could, down the stairs and across the yard, pulling him into a fierce hug. Ron was over a head taller than she was but he still buried his face into her neck, breathing in the familiar smell of sugar and bread she always seemed to hold. She pulled away after a few minutes but held his face in her hands taking him in.
Harry was stunned. He had never given much thought to where dementors “came from” before and he wasn't sure he wanted to know.
The scream brought back every defeated memory Harry had. He could see Tonks and Remus laid out dead still reaching for each other.
Ron hesitated. He really hadn't thought about what to do if he wasn't able to see his mum right away.
“Yes, i suppose that’s all you’ll be able to do.”  she turned and nodded to Kingsley and held her hands out to her auror who still had Draco in his arms.
Neville wasn't sure what he had expected, but Draco snapping out of his thousand yard stare to pin him with a look that looked so lost and confused wasn't it. Him bursting into a fresh round of tears was even more shocking. Without thinking Neville scooted himself across to the blonde and wrapped his arms around him, only mildly surprised to feel long spindly arms wrap around his shoulders in return.
“Weasley, I swear to everything inside me, namely your evil red haired spawn, I will bloody end you if you don't get to this hospital immediately!”  Draco’s sleek cat patronus snarled at him in his husband's voice as it staked along the tip of his broom.
Draco sighed and let go of the quilt covering him . it fell to his lap revealing long angry red slashes across his chest from left hip to right shoulder.  He gasped and reached a hand out to touch the darkest one laid right across his ribs.
“Oh! Actually, no I can't. The battery was fried when I texted him from inside the burrow earlier.” she grimaced.
“Harry, you do know that that is Draco’s school right? That he funded the schools first years? He went out and found muggle teachers who knew about the wizarding world or squibs who taught in the muggle world and had them work with pureblood wizarding tutors to create a curriculum that was beneficial to both. Tonight was the reunion for his first graduates. The first class to go to Hogwarts was going to be coming back to the school to talk about their experience and share their thoughts and ideas for improvements.” Hermione spoke softly but her words created a shockwave through Harry’s system.
Harry was seething. He couldn't believe Malfoy was being so selfish. Mrs. Weasley had had this dinner planned out for weeks for their anniversary and Malfoy couldn't be arsed to rearrange his plans to be there for him. That he even had the nerve to ask Harry not to attend so that he could go to some stupid charity event was just like the stuck up man. Malfoy was unbelievable for even asking him to go.
They were having twins, and of course Ron knew his brother could never be replaced and maybe he hadn't talked to any of his other brothers, or any of his family really, in the 10 years Draco and he had been married but just having that small part of them with him meant so much. A pair of Weasley twins just for Ron and Draco was more than he could have ever imagined at the beginning of his eighth year when he and Harry had been made to room with the Slytherin.
“You! You, Potter, never talk about your wife or your family! That doesn't make you any less married!”
They had sat in silence for the next few minutes. Neville ate his lunch while Draco ate his apple one tiny bite at a time. Neville was pretty sure the Slytherin hadn't been at breakfast that morning or even dinner the night before.
Draco padded, eyes closed and bear tucked under his chin, over to Weasley’s bed. He knew the route by heart at this point and made it without bumping into anything Potter had lying around.
It started at Hogwarts, two  redheaded brothers embracing each other and touching their foreheads together. One was missing an ear. The next one was a wedding to a faceless bride. Then him laying a kiss on a rounded stomach and laying his ear against it. Fred Weasley looked radiantly happy. The portraits moved through his life, showing him with a baby,then babies then growing children and with a wife and a home and a life that would never be lived. It cycled through the images slowly enough to catch his face in every frame. The happiness in holding a daughter's hand and the sadness of his son boarding a train. There was pride while watching a quidditch game and even sadness when his daughter got married. All images of Fred living the life the weasleys had always wanted to him.
“I heard Harry talking and I swore my heart stopped. I have no idea how I even left the common room. Barely noticed a thing till i was outside Madam Pomfrey’s.”
Before he could think of a loving Malfoy family dynamic, another younger auror stepped into the great hall.
“He asked me what I saw Fred doing with his life if he were here.” Mr Weasley whispered, voice thick with emotion.
“Ah actually,” he began looking around the group before turning to Ron with a large smile. It made his heart beat wildly in his chest, just as it had for decades now.
A commotion near the main doors drew the attention of him and a few others. Hermione who had been hovering nearby stepped closer to him.
Harry sat for a few minutes looking around at the great hall. It was still beautiful, still looked like home to him. But there was so much sadness packed into the grand room. So many dead, fighting for him, with him.
“I'm not going to the Weasleys, Potter. And i'm not going to some gala. I'm going to a fundraising event for the school. The one you don't care about. Tomorrow I'll be back here to pick up anything i have left here. There shouldn't be much.”
“A dementor is born from the pained scream of a soul. That’s what we heard back there.” Kingsley said motioning behind them. Harry looked back for the first time since leaving through the double doors, he was surprised to see a crowd of people hovering about and watching them. They were too far for Harry, even with his glasses, to see who they were.
“You did Draco a huge bloody service killing that thing Nev. By the end of it he was tall enough where that bitch could comfortably wrap around him seven times.”
Draco reached out a hand to snatch the noise out of the air and found a face on the pillow next to him. His fingertips found the mouth and held them there in case it opened again.
Draco rolled his eyes. Ron and he had been circling Ottery St Catchpole for hours now and Ron was becoming more and more insufferable as the night wore on. Coming back to Britain had been Ron’s idea. He had been more than happy to live the rest of his life in Seattle but he would never have deprived Ron of reconciliation with his family. He had known they would be coming the moment he had read Hermione’s email.
Harry looked around at the shocked and uncomfortable faces around him. Had his whole family known? Had they listened to Malfoy talk endlessly while Harry sat next to him and ignored the conversation in favor of his own. If it was such a large part of Malfoy's life, enough to basically be another job for him, how had Harry completely missed it?
Even at a distance and in the pervasive darkness he could make out most of his siblings. Bill stood the tallest with his slight and slender wife next to him. Ginny, of course, was the only girl, though with her short hair, and seekers figure she was almost easily mistakable for Harry next to her. It seemed Harry never did gain the height or musculature his upbringing deprived him of. Charlie was next to them, shorter and stockier than any of the others his impressive build stood out. Ron wondered idly if Draco would find him attractive. He always loved watching Ron add a few pounds during the summer months when Ron was on break.
“They weren’t here last year, with the Carrow’s. There’s no way for them to know.” he said softly while he dabbed the cloth against the cut on Neville’s brow that was still sluggish bleeding. He winced when Neville let out a hiss.
Still mostly asleep he crawled into the bed and nuzzled his face into the pillow. Weasley’s shampoo was a wonderful mix of wood smoke and citrus and Draco loved it. He laid out his lovey over the pillow and laid his cheek on the cool fabric with a smile, already drifting back into sleep.
Now it was Harry’s turn to scoff at him. “Please it was just a way for all the purebloods to save face and make themselves look good. I saw the curriculum when Andromeda tried to enroll Teddy there. Proper etiquette and the history of the founding fathers and the accomplishments of the sacred 28. That has nothing to do with inclusion.”
“Sorry, sorry.” he blew softly against the skin to ease the sting, watching the cut stitch itself together.
Harry sat for a few minutes looking around at the great hall. It was still beautiful, still looked like home to him. But there was so much sadness packed into the grand room. So many dead, fighting for him, with him.
“And who’s fault was that huh?!” he hissed at him through clenched teeth trying and failing to reign in his anger.
“It really was dear” replied Mrs Weasley “I can't believe we got so many gifts when we specifically stated no presents on the invites! I'll have to find a place for all of them”
“And Malfoy, Draco Malfoy felt enough grief over Professor Snape to create a dementor?” he asked skeptically.
“It’s just that, we have told them. Me and Gin have told them how much help you were last year with the DA. We told them about all the shield spells and disillusionment charms you taught all the younger years. We even told them about how you made sure you or Daphne or Blaise were the ones to lead detentions so you didn't actually have to hurt the children. And all they can say is how you should have done more! How you should have stood up to them openly instead of hiding in the shadows. They have no idea what it was like to be here last year but they think they can cast judgement on those of us who had to live it!”
The cry was loud, and high pitched, and full of so much anguish. Harry felt the grief and hopelessness of it as if it was own. He felt his chest crack open right between his ribs, the pain so real he reached up with hand to rub at the spot.
Draco sat with Harry in the living room, reading while Harry dozed on and off. Harry was wearing one of his Christmas jumpers and still wrapped in a heavy blanket.
Ron let his dad have the picture and pulled Draco in for a tight hug, dispelling the glamor he still wore. He heard sounds of shock and congratulations all around him when Draco’s large pregnant belly was exposed. Ron never could have imagined his family cheering for them at hearing their news and the sound of it was almost as wonderful as the beautiful family the man in his arms had given him every day for the last twenty years.
“Nev, you got away from the Carrow’s and the rest of the Death Eaters whenever you went to bed last year right?” Dean paused, waiting for Neville to confirm “well, the Slytherin’s didn’t.” he told him ominously.
Ron loved a pregnant Draco. Oh he loved Draco plenty the rest of the time too, their entire life together was a clear enough indicator of that. But pregnant Draco glowed brightly. The look he usually reserved just for Ron whenever he told him he loved him seemed to be a permanent fixture on his face nowadays. Ron used to revel in the shine of his eyes whenever he was open with his emotions, but it seemed like that was all the time now. Draco was constantly open and loving and in love with Ron and the lives they had brought into being.
He wore a fitted jean jacket rolled up  on his arms that showed off stark black and white tattoos Harry always wanted to see more of. Only the bottom few buttons were done up leaving only a perfunctory view of a white shirt underneath. His pants were black and stretched obscenely over tight muscled thighs. Malfoy held on to his seekers body long past his own hogwarts days. He had a gleaming silver chain looped around his waist, hanging low to one side, drawing Harry's eyes to the miniscule sliver of pale skin showing above the low riding pants. The chunky black boots he wore added about an inch of height to his already over 6 foot frame. When he stopped in front of Harry, Harry’s eyes were even to his mouth and he wanted to lean up and bite at them. Malfoys blonde hair was hidden under a dark colored beanie and there was a small earring dangling from his ear in the shape of a dagger.
“Blimey,” came a voice next to where he and Hermione stood. Harry turned and saw Ron, together with most of the Weasleys, Neville, Luna, and Dean.
“You should have waited for me.” he told him, taking Scorpius from one of his arms. Draco hovered making sure they didn't lose their grip on either boy in the hand off.
Suddenly a small black shape began to materialize above the small shack. Harry squinted, trying to make out the shape but it seemed to be shifting as if not sure what it wanted to be. It looked more like a black patronus than anything solid.  Next to him one of the auror’s spoke up.
The wizard smiled at him and held out the lime green visitors gown and booties. Slipping it over his head he hopped towards the swinging doors while securing the thin paper booties over his feet. Once he was through he ran down the hallway, Draco’s high pitched voice leading the way.
Dean looked over at her, not seeming the least bit surprised to see her there. Harry saw a look of understating pass over his face before he turned back to Malfoy.
this one came a little short of the 1k line but I really liked where it ended and didn't feel the need to add anymore.  hope you like it!
The swooping sensation in Harry’s stomach returned with a vengeance. Mafloy was looking at him with a mixture of horror, pity, and anger and Harry didn't understand.
With a glare towards the partially opened door behind him, Snape ignored Neville and turned on his heel to walk back towards the Slytherin dormitory.
Harry felt his breath catch in irrational fear. He knew Draco was fine if not just emotionally and physically exhausted like the rest of them but he felt his heart skip a beat, then take off at high speed when he saw the rise and fall of his breathing.
“Ron!” he heard his name yelled out before the front door to the Burrow swung open and Hermione ran down the hill towards him.
Ron wanted to laugh but all he could do was stare at her wondering again if it was the right thing to do. As much as he loved his mum and dad, Draco and the boys and the baby came first.
“If you have no idea what the problem here is, Potter then I'm really not sure what to tell you. If you don't even know what I'm doing tonight or why I'm doing it despite it being all ive been able to talk about for the past month then there’s no need for me to be here anymore.”
He saw the Weasley’s silent in their grief surrounding their lost son and brother, even George who looked closer to dead than alive.
Malfoy was attentive whenever Harry talked, asking questions about his plans over the summer break and how his first year of teaching went. He listened to the boring stories of being an auror during peacetime. Neither brought up the war. They didn't talk about their families or the dark year or two that the trails were part of after the war. They never did. Maybe one day they would have to air all of that nastiness out but not that day.
Harry could hear the fury in Malfoys words. Even if he hadn't it was written all over his face. He shook his head. Of course Malfoy was going to discount the Weasleys. He always had hadn't he?
But Harry didn't have one pet name. Malfoy seemed to cycle through an unending list of things to call Harry, but never stuck with one. He didn't use his sneering voice to spit out Potter anymore but he never seemed to land on one specific endearment for him. Harry loved them all of course. He knew if they were not as close as they were he would be relegated to Potter again but he couldn't help the sting of jealousy when he heard him speak to any of the others.
Harry wasn't too sure what to think about the few number of them to actually be present for the battle. Tonks and Moody had been outliers on the force, morally good and not just able to follow orders. He knew if he was going to go ahead with his plans he would have to do something about that. But for now he was ok to sit between Tonks and Remus and grieve for what was lost.
Harry reached for his hands before he could pill the jean jacket from the chair behind him, getting in Malfoys personal space. Malfoy blinked at him with wide, shocked eyes.
“Ah sorry, what was that?” Harry asked. He could feel his cheeks heating up at being caught staring. Malfoy made a face.
“Draco!” he cried seeing him laid out on the settee in front of him. He rushed over to him, hands reaching out to pull him into a hug. He pulled back slightly when he felt Draco flinch away from him.
“But you like me! As Much as I like you!” Harry cried out. This was not what was supposed to happen. Malfoy had never even said Ginny’s name since they had begun working together. He acted like she didn't exist just as much as Harry did. Harry crowded Malfoy close to the wall.
“Apologize or move, I need to get my husband to the healer to take care of the boot shaped bruising and broken ribs he has.”
If Ron hadn’t been worried about Draco and his boys he probably would have been annoyed. But of course Draco had waited to come in until he absolutely had to. The git hated having to go into the healers office on a regular day, he had probably tried to wait until Ron was home before coming.
One by one they each promised safety, until Ginny surprised him with a hug, whispering her promise in his ear.
“I won’t stay if we’re not welcome. If we are not all welcome.” he told her hoping she would understand.
I used the Inuit word for wolf for the name of the school and an Inuit name for an OC. if any of it is wrong i'm very sorry.
Fred stood next to a woman he could easily identify from a distance, though the stiff posture of his long, willowy frame spoke of the same kind of protectiveness Ron knew he exuded when strangers were introduced to his family. Percy was a ways away from the rest of them, the gap never having healed completely it seemed, even with all the intervening years since he had returned to the Weasley fold. The small divide made Ron’s heart ache, wondering how anything between his family and this, larger, more rigid, stubborn family could be bridged if they couldn't even fully forgive the brother and son who stayed and tried to make amends.
He watched Harry reach down and pull the blanket off of his feet and tuck it under them. He couldn't feel Harry's thighs shifting underneath his heels anymore but they were kind of still touching so that was ok.
“We’ll have to be careful with that one,” Kingsley said beside him. He still wasn't smiling but his eyes were a little less dull than before, Harry thought. “She’ll take the palace over if we send her to Azkaban.”
All of them turned to her, but Ron was the only one to gasp at her appearance. His mum had always been robust, with frazzled red hair and a permanent blush on her cheeks. The woman in front of him had bright white hair to rival Draco’s platinum white locks, and  her face was sallow sunken in. she was smaller, frailer than he had ever seen her. Her body was thin, bordering on emaciated. But she still stood strong, even with his fathers arm around her waist. She looked sick, but she could never look weak.
“I am ready to go now. I will take the body with me to the ministry and have my lawyers begin burial proceedings according to his will.”
Mrs. Malfoy had made it into the boat house, not even glancing at the spectre above her head. Her handler let her go in alone, clearly unwilling to pass beneath it. Following her lead Mr. Malfoy was also unhanded and marched inside, though Harry could see the tension in his shoulders as he made to pass.
“I spent a lot of time with him in between appropriated torture sessions and sneaking us food and blankets. You know how much he talks right?”
“I understand Severus showed his disdain for your openly at any opportunity he had despite his overwhelmingly unrequited love for your mother but in Draco’s eyes that acerbic man was everything. So yes, Harry Potter. Draco’s grief and pain over the loss of his godfather bore him a dementor” Mr. Malfoy hissed. He stood unmoving and unblinking until he curled his lip at Harry and turned away from him, dismissing him.
Dean stopped and turned back to them. Harry thought about all the times he had gone to the Manor to return Malfoy’s wand, angry and hurt at being ignored.
“There! Over there! Draco!” she called out to Malfoy’s retreating back. If he heard her he made no sign of it. He kept moving slowly, but purposefully onward, his head swiveling back and forth over the ruined terrain.
“From the scream of a soul. One in unimaginable grief, or pain. It’s said the first dementors were born of the squib bastard of the family Azkaban, who was tortured in their private mansion where the prison now sits. Their torture reached his soul and unleashed the dementor on them and drove them madder than they already were. The boy was an obscurial, used every piece of magic he didn't know he had in him to separate his pain from his soul.”
Ron had argued the first time Malfoy had had a screaming fit in the middle of the night after waking up wrapped tightly in his quilts, that he was faking it for attention. Seamus and Neville had also looked dubious and though they hadn’t outright agreed with Ron, they also had not moved to help Malfoy, who was still writhing on the floor crying.
“I have to wonder Harry, how it never even occurred to you that neither me or Luna were tortured down in those dungeons. Starved a little, yeah course. But we weren’t hurt, you know.”
Ron shoved Scorpius into the first set of free arms he could, not even bothering to see who it was. He only vaguely heard Charlie laugh behind him before he reached Draco and his dad, snatching the small black and gray picture from the latter’s hands. Draco made a disapproving noise but Ron ignored him, pulling him into his arms and staring at two very separate shapes.
Harry cringed at the reminder.  He thought of Malfoy, bent over a sink crying, but ready to accept the prospect of his own death. For his family, as dysfunctional as they were.
“Time heals a multitude of wounds, but only if you let it. Draco and i moved on from your words and actions of that night a very long time ago. But we will only stay if you’ve all moved on as well. I need to know nothing will harm my family here.” he said softly but with conviction as he stared down each person there.
It also led him to his Sunday afternoon habit of migrating from his bed once the outside sun was shining full force across it, to Weasley’s bed, tucked in the perpetual shadows of the far corner. This particular Sunday was not any different, save for the fact that Draco was TIRED.
Mrs. Malfoy moved away from him, not bothering to wipe at the black tear tracks marring her face. She did straighten her shoulders and take a step forward, then another larger one, dragging her handler forward with her.
Most of the deatheaters had been stunned watching their lord crumble to ash before them. A few had gotten away, but those not quick enough had been handled easily by the aurors who had shown only seconds too late.
Dean spoke up next “I saw him do it, saw him cast an imperio at Malfoy.” he said and drew a nodding Luna into his arms.
“It’s ok” Draco told him again “as long as you know, and as long as I have you, I don't care what Potty has to say to me.”
They had met there again a few days later. And a few after that. By the time Neville had worked up the courage to kiss Draco, they had been meeting at least every other day.
What kind of idiot used an unknown spell on another student? Neville loved Harry but sometimes he couldn't help but agree with Draco that the boy was truly an idiot with nothing but luck to get him by.
He saw Neville’s jaw clench and fire flash briefly in his eyes before he deflated completely. Draco touched the hand still cupping his jaw. He could feel where the skin on the knuckles had split. He pulled the hand away and kissed them again in silent apology the same way he had when McGonagall had sent them on their way after breaking up the fight. Neville’s eyes softened like they did whenever he thought Draco was doing something wholly uncharacteristic.
Mrs. Malfoy came to Harry holding an envelope. Harry took it and what looked like another vile of memories. Both had Draco’s name on them in the Half Blood Prince’s handwriting.
“I had no idea if it was a lot of blood or if the water made it look worse.” his tongue trailed down the puckered flesh to where it bisected a pectoral, barely missing the dusky nipple. Neville made sure to give it attention while he was in the vicinity.
How had he not seen it? Had Draco noticed it before today? Draco had gone out of his way to not only come by to make sure the elder Weasleys received their gift but had let them know ahead of time that he would not be able to make it. And Harry had called him selfish, Malfoy had never actually even asked him to go with him tonight, Harry had just assumed that's what he wanted. Because that's what Harry had always expected from him. A convenient plus one with added benefits.
Everyone had stared at the only two remaining Malfoy’s, but neither of them seemed to register the shock of those around them.
Harry wouldn't actually believe that it was over. Voldemort was dead. Most of  his deatheaters were in custody. And it was over.
“It’s what you do when you love someone.” Ron said with a pointed glance at the wedding ring on Fred’s finger. “Besides,” he continued “Weasley didn't leave the best impression last time we were around.”
“It’s OK. That’s why he split up with his wife, ex-wife now I suppose. He realised he was into guys. Took him long enough though. Shame for-” Teddy cuts himself off by slapping a hand to his mouth. “Sorry. Not my story to tell.” He apologises with a small smile. “So what were you saying about the gang?”
“Oh god,” I whispered to myself, shock filling me. I jumped in the car and looking at my neck in the mirror. Sure enough, dark bruises where his hand had grasped my neck, and some smaller ones on my chin from where he had held it roughly. Tears were running down my face before I knew it, and a sob wracked through my body.
“I won’t hesitate to bend you over right here and fuck you. I’ll fuck you anywhere, I don’t care.” I gulp at his forewardness, and at how clearly he speaks. Anyone in the house could hear him. “Imagine what the Griffins would think if they saw their great and glorious leader taking it up the ass, being pounded into by a police officer of all people.”
"Well maybe they'd let me in out of the cold for a bit, a hot drink perhaps. It was worth a try even if they say no. Why are you being nice to me?"
"If you say so." Draco shrugged off Harry's strange atmosphere, getting changed as Harry tentatively clambered into the bed, careful not to look at Draco.
"Harry, that's not been washed in days," I said with a soft chuckle. "Take mine." I said, pulling off my own sweater. He put it on quickly, the sleeves covering his hands because of the size difference. He climbed into the bed, kneeling beside me for a moment, pausing in thought, before going to sit in my lap.
My fear is pointless, however, when I let my breath go in a breathy moan as his fingers deftly brush my throbbing clit. He dips into me, swiping the juices and using them to lube up his fingers before painfully slowly stroking my clit. I break the kiss, leaning my forehead on his chest as I let out moan after moan thanks to his teasing. My fingers thread through his hair, pulling at the blond locks. I feel him kissing along my neck, sucking a mark into the tan skin. The sensations build up inside me, and he senses I’m close. As the warmth builds up in the bottom of my stomach, he strokes me faster, bringing me to completion in no time.
When we arrive at the party later that night, it’s already in full swing. We climb out of our cars - we being Longbottom, Weasley, Granger, Thomas and Finnegan, and Ginny and Lovegood - and head inside. There are cheers when we walk into the house, and the wildly lit building is busy with activity. Most of the Serpents are here, as well as a few from the Bloodskulls and the Rooks, most of whom are wearing their gang’s clothing.
When I saw the car pull up outside, I didn't wait for him to knock before leaving the house, knowing most of my friends would still be asleep, and got into the car.
He passed a small picket fence and smiled to himself a little when it rang a bell in his memory. He paused, pacing backwards to the fence again. He looked to the gate, to the small cottage which lay twenty or so metres within the confines, and back to the gate.
”Daddy I’m close.” I whine, trying not to buck up into him. At this he pulls back, making me whine at the loss on contact and he quickly flips me over.
James meowed again, almost fed up with the wizard, hitting the clock harder making it tumble to the floor. Both James and Draco watched it fall, James not moving a muscle.
"Uh, Mum said she's gonna stop by today." Draco let out a sigh. "And Grandma's coming with her." Draco's shoulder's sagged further. "They said 10ish, I think."
I felt my eyes drooping and my heartbeat releaxing, and I cuddled close into him as sleep captured my satiated body.
He began pressing kisses to the inside of my thighs, getting dangerously close but never actually touching my aching clit. I was growing ansty.
”I don’t need thanking. Trust me, this whole evening is very selfish of me.” There’s a yell fro, upstairs as the doorbell rings. “You ok to check upstairs?” He asks with a sigh. I smile, before pecking his cheek.
“Well, when Sirius passed away, as his Godson, I took over as leader of the gang. My parents were killed when I was one, your father passed away when you were younger and Pettigrew... Pettigrew disappeared. I was only 15, but there wasn’t any other choice. So, there I was, about to sit exams and I just been landed with the title of King of the Griffins.”
I go to stand by Draco, trying to act naturally. I tug on his shirt and look up to him. He meets my gaze and quirks an eyebrow.
"Officer Gregory Goyle," she muttered, tapping a couple keys in her keyboard. "Arrested on sexual assault charges."
"Just went for a long walk, had to think some stuff over. Sorry I didn't let you guys know," I lied seamlessly.
He dressed quickly, not bothering with breakfast but instead giving the cat some more tuna - he was going to run out quickly at this rate.
”Keep it down, kid.” I shout. Knowing Neville, he’s a blushing idiot right now. If Draco is at work, that means that Zabini is with him on patrol. So Longbottom must Ben having one hell of a solo session, unless Zabini managed to get a phone call with him. Sneaky bastard.
“I know that! But cats do this slow blink thing at you, it means they love you!” Draco chuckled at her enthusiasm. “Seriously, that’s what they do! You’ll have to keep checking if James does it to you. You took him in and all, I’m sure he does love you.”
”This is still a punishment. Get up.” I stand quickly, scared of what’s going to happen next. He motions for me to follow him, and he leads me down the upstairs hallway to what appears to be a guest room. The walls are bare, and the bed looks cold and unused. I give him a confused look. “Part of the punishment, now hop on into bed.” He says, giving my ass a pat, which jostles the plug in me. I whimper, and take a few steps towards the bed, observing it cautiously. I hear the door move and I whip around.
”You’re so perfect. I love your hole, baby. So tight for me. Just for me.” I can tell he’s close, and as he starts to stroke me I begin to near climax too.
Finally in bed again, he relaxed as he watched the kitten sit on his chest and play around with his hair. There was something amusing about the way James chased the blonde locks that fell onto Draco's face.
"Harry I'm going to murder you, Merlin as my witness." Draco grumbled, turning to face away from him. Harry frowned but mentally shrugged it off. He leaned over Draco's side, placing an arm either side of the man to keep balance and leaning close to his face.
“I suppose each cat has a different personality, just like people do,” she smiled in return, before sipping at her drink. “Would you be sad to see him go?”
“If you’re here any time soon then trust me, I’ll make you learn how to follow orders quick enough.”
"Apparently he was found beaten to death. Mostly head and torso wounds, I think a fractured leg as well. For some reason they think it was you who did it."
"Merry Christmas," he whispered, a smirk in his voice, relishing in the expression of anger on Harry's face.
The softest of meows came from behind him. He whipped around, seeing a pair of green eyes hiding under his bed.
I'm not sure how long I sat there for. It could have been minutes. Perhaps hours. I didn't know. Still don't.
”Mhmm. Well.” He quickly pulls my boxers down and moves the packed out of the way, revealing my clit. “Looks like you’re just hard, baby. Who knew you got off so much just from sucking dick? We’ll definitely have to do that more often.” He rubs it inbetween his fingers. It had grown thanks to my testosterone, and even though I knew it was nothing like what he had, something about his actions made my heart soar.
you, I'm just a poor sod who is of the misfortune to find you stupidly attractive, idiocy included."
"Let you go? In your wildest dreams, girlie." Fuck, that cut deep. But I knew that he was just an asshole, and in a few minutes I'd be able to go home, cry a bit and surround myself with people who actually gave a shit.
”Scorpius?” I nod. “He’s 17.” I don’t answer immediately. “See? Weirded out. I’m fucking a kid that’s basically the same age as my son.”
When I wake a couple hours later, I can hear a phone ringing from downstairs. I slip out of bed quickly, the cold air hitting me sharply, and run to answer it, still naked from last night.
”You’re talking like a frog, Mr. Croak. I think someone’s ill.” He pulled the covers down slightly. “Come back to bed. I’ll look after you.”
“Thanks, ‘Mione. And don’t worry about Malfoy. He’s...” I trail off, looking for the right word to use.
"That was amazing baby. You're amazing." He whispers queitly. I reply by pressing my lips to his. He pulls the covers over us and pulls me close to his chest, wrapping an arm around me. "Get some rest, baby. I'll be here when you wake."
”No welcome for your own mother?” The other lady harrumphs. She has white hair, with a streak of dark grey running through. She looks like she’s very upper class, and her outfit screams expense I couldn’t dream off. Nevertheless, she brings Draco in for a motherly hug I had never experienced, and the way he softens around her tells me she’s not how she might first appear. “Draco, it’s a mess in this house.” She tuts, but there’s love in her voice.
He turned the lights off and got comfortable, resting on his side facing Harry. He closed his eyes, drifting on the edge of slumber, and felt the body next to him move closer. He let out a smile when he felt his arm being wrapped around Harry's waist and fell asleep not long after, his forehead coming to rest on Harry’s shoulder.
“See how manly it is when I have you on your knees begging for it.” Draco smirks, before slipping his shoes on.
”Well, I’m not as gullible as they are, so get back to bed. Working yourself to death isn’t going to make this cold go away anytime soon.” His voice was firm, and I did as told. He tucked me in, pressing a kiss to my forehead, before pulling away. I let out a gentle whine as he did. “Get some rest, I’ll be back later.” As he closed the door softly behind him, I felt my eyes fall and I drifted into sleep.
"This is home," he said to the kitten, as if it really cared. He carefully put it down onto the floor, letting it explore his home as he tried to find something for it - and himself - to eat.
“I’ll be using a very different type of handcuffs. That’s a promise.” His voice is low and his eyes darken slightly.
”Hey, I was drunk and high. Still am a bit.” His grip tightens and I yowl in pain. “Please daddy that hurts.” Slips out of my lips before I can stop myself.
”Hey Scorp. You good?” A slight pause. “I’m fine. Look, you think you’d be able to stay at your mother’s tonight? Need to bring Harry back for a day or so.” His lips purse in thought and he spares a glance to me. He mouths ‘stay quiet’ to me, before seamlessly sliding a hand down my trousers, where he immediately begins to rub my clit. “Stay for a couple nights if you want, you know she loves having you over.” A short pause before he lets out a laugh. The rubbing on my crotch doesn’t stop and I begin to let out short pants of breath. “Thanks Scorp. You know I wouldn’t unless it was an emergency.” Emergency? “Love you.” He hangs up and I let out a small moan. I feel the heat building inside of me.
James meowed quietly, almost sadly, in understanding. At least, Draco liked to think it was in understanding.
“Since he spoke out at my trials, saved me from being locked up in Azkaban. Sometimes I go for a walk in Diagon Alley and enjoy not being glared at by other shoppers.” Pansy glared at him, raising an eyebrow. “Pans, for Merlin’s sake! Ok, I liked him a bit, but that was then. This is now. I haven’t seen the tosser since the trials. Not even in passing.”
I opened my eyes. Still in the alley. As his hand pulled my boxers down and reached along my crotch, I couldn't help the sob that escaped me, my vision now blurry with tears.
"I got over it, though. Plus, being a muggle vet is almost magic in itself. So many injured animals and not long after they're healthy again. I think you lot don't appreciate muggle medicine enough."
“I’m fine!” I tried to sound convincing, but my voice cracked. “Just tired.” I changed into a pair of joggers and a turtleneck sweater hidden deep in my wardrobe.
James looked to the couple at the door before leaning back on his hind legs to rest his front paws on Draco’s knees.
”I’ll throw you onto this counter and fuck you til you scream. Don’t make me make the delivery guy wait.” I smile and saunter off upstairs, swinging my hips. I knock on Scorp’s door and walk in, seeing a frowning Teddy sitting on the foot end of the bed, and Scorp lying awkwardly on the floor, as if he’d been pushed off.
Draco tried to mumble against it, but James meowed loudly, angrily almost. When James was happy that Draco was definitely going to stop rambling, he removed his paw and licked the tip of Draco's nose, before sitting on Draco's chest, seemingly pleased with himself.
Draco was taken aback a little when Harry rolled his eyes and practically straddled the blond. Harry seemed to thinking nothing of the position, naïve as always.
”Teeth, baby. Watch out for your teeth.” I return to my ministrations, and reach a hand to play with his balls. “Fuck,” he moans, dragging out the word. “I’m close, baby.” He doesn’t give me much warning before grabbing my head and pulling my down on him until my nose is buried in his pubes. I splutter but can’t move back as I feel him release down my throat. He moans loudly, slowly pulling me off him as he cums. I taste him on my tongue, a bitterly, salty taste and I swallow quickly. I give his dick a few licks, cleaning off some cum from the tip. He leans down, grabbing arm and making me stand before pulling my onto his lap. I straddle him awkwardly, my cheeks flushed.
”Thanks for arresting me, daddy.” I giggle, before a yawn escapes my lips. He chuckles and pulls back, before throwing the bed covers over me.
