He glanced at his boyfriend, taking in all the details in his features, his expression, wishing he could alleviate the sorrow in his eyes.
Harry blanked. He had fantasized about it quite a lot, but he had never really explored any option other than the one Draco suggested.
Despite her sweet tone, the light in her eyes sent a shiver down Harry’s spine. He still shot her a quick smile.
Following his devilish look, Draco ran his fingertips all over his thighs, igniting sparkles wherever he touched. He jerked up to meet Harry halfway before he could bend to kiss him again.
“Draco, I hope you don’t mind showing Harry his room. The teal one should be ready.” Neville then added standing up, promptly followed by Blaise.
“It’s not hexing, or I would be bleeding by now.” Harry swallowed, enticed by Malfoy’s velvety voice, as the man tilted his head while still moving closer.
Soon out of breath, Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair, leaving soft kisses on his lips and cheeks. Draco blushed, but kept coming back for more, tilting his head and turning his face to offer him new spots to kiss.
Now that was what Harry wanted to hear. It soothed his nerves, despite having no reason to truly believe him.
Harry opened his mouth, flicking his tongue to tease him before flattening it to give it a lick, using his own saliva as make-do lube. Could have conjured some, he thought absent-mindedly, but nothing beat the taste of a sweaty cock in his mouth.
Harry only half listened to the series of profanities that followed, busy gloating at the clear annoyance on Malfoy’s face at his innocent comment. Good for him to remember an interview where Malfoy was asked that same question and he reacted as if someone had shoveled manure before his eyes.
“You and Callum, uh?” he then asked, his voice suspiciously cold. Harry nodded, a part of him glad there weren’t that many men with private pictures of Malfoy, although he postponed to another day the analysis of the implication of that thought.
“We should go say hi to Nev,” he suggested, hoping his casual tone would sound more convincing to Malfoy’s ears than it did to his.
Harry raised his eyebrows, but that was all the reaction he allowed himself. After all, Draco held on tightly to his pride, and there was only so much scratching at it he would tolerate before snapping.
“Oh no, it’s working,” Draco smirked, pressing his body against Harry’s, “still didn’t sound sexy at all.”
“I tried, you know? I went to funerals and functions and memorials. I got back with Ginny and told myself things were fine. I was fine.”
“As a safety measure?” Malfoy added when confusion grew on Harry’s face, “No? It’s like a standard feature, nothing?”
He didn't expect to meet him so soon after inviting him out for a drink to definitely close their brief relationship. The memory still bothered him almost a week later.
“No, I – ” Draco licked his lips, too late to stop the words from slipping out, his nonchalant attitude fading for a moment.
“Should we go somewhere more comfortable?” Draco asked, and, once again, Harry only answered with a silent gesture of his head. He shook it as he tugged on his panties, which fell at his ankles, and he kicked them away. He ignored the chuckle coming from Draco as he pushed the boxes on the floor to sit on the table. His hole was still sensitive, but Harry ignored that too.
He took Draco's hand, shutting his eyes as he prepared himself for the unpleasantness of an Apparition. He stumbled, still close-eyed, in a small living room, bumping against an old sofa. He had never been in Draco's flat before, but in his mind he imagined something more... luxurious. The room looked more like a studio than an actual living room. The walls filled with bookshelves and Magical artifacts. Polished, strong wood seemed to be the common denominator of all the furniture: the bookshelves, the table and chairs, the door and window frame, and even the staircase leading upstairs looked made out of the same type of wood, the floor covered with a soft, white carpet.
Harry ran his hand over his shirt, playing with the tiny white buttons. He unbuttoned a few, brushing his knuckles against Draco's soft belly.
“Draco.” Harry chuckled. Said out loud, the name rolled out even better, it fit that it forced his mouth in a pout, and that thought made him laugh even more.
However, he appreciated much less Malfoy fawning over the room Neville mentioned, especially once they had left Pansy before her bedroom and they were alone. Had he changed his mind? He seemed perfectly fine at the idea of them having separate rooms.
Harry sneered at the sarcasm infused in Draco’s voice but held his tongue seeing the sparkle in his eyes.
Hearing Nev’s name pronounced so candidly by Malfoy brought a smile to Harry's face. There was no animosity in his voice, no resentment, but the mere acknowledgment that was in fact Zabini and Neville’s house.
He tried turning his back on Malfoy, in the hopes it would get the image of a vulnerable, undressed Malfoy out of his head, but that only made things worse, as he rolled closer, laying against his body, his breathing tickling the back of Harry’s neck.
Draco leant in to kiss him as he pushed himself inside his body. Harry gritted his teeth; despite the rimming and the lube, his body still burned at the intrusion. Draco caressed his back, mumbling soothing words on his lips, patiently waiting for him to relax in his embrace.
Harry closed his eyes once again as he let out a slow sigh, but Malfoy’s dick rubbing against his ass shook him up right when he was falling back to sleep. He bit his lips to stop himself from chuckling in frustration. Using his elbow, he tried to push Malfoy away, but that only made him hold on to Harry tighter.
All the comments died in his throat as soon as he felt Draco's tongue against his skin. Holding on to the table, Harry got lost in a storm of pleasure that had him weak and took his breath away.
What did surprise him, though, was the choked “Oh no” coming from Malfoy, who rushed to down his second shot before the woman could join them.
Harry shivered; hadn’t Draco been right before his eyes, he could have sworn Lucius Malfoy had just walked into the room.
“I didn't think dating would be on the table,” he confessed the only thing that came in his defense.
“I did,” Malfoy whispered, barely looking at him. His regret hit Harry as sincere. He smiled at Malfoy to reassure him. “It’s not a big deal.” But he shook his head.
“I refuse the title, if someone is a drama-magnet here, that’s Pan, remember the time she got drunk and laid in the bushes, whining because Weasley didn’t love her back?”
Hermione rolled her eyes, careful not to let Robards see her, before excusing herself from the table.
“Have a nice day, Sir.” The agent that brought him there said, pointing at the trailer with a flick of his hand. Harry nodded in response, careful not to turn his back on him as he walked up the steps to the door to knock.
He smiled at the picture. Draco didn't send a racy picture either, but this one looked more real, intimate enough to make him feel warm.
Draco winked at him as he walked toward the door. Harry shook his head with a smile, watching him leave. No need to tell him he was right.
Harry sighed, wiping the sweat on his forehead with the back of his sleeve. Three weeks before he had accepted Callum’s invitation to conclude their date at his place. He couldn’t have known back then that his nod would mean the beginning of the end. Melodramatic? Maybe, but their newborn relationship died then and there for sure.
The young owl glided midair, closing in to the garden, her ivory feathers beaming into the light of the late afternoon.
“I'll wait for you then,” he said with a wink. Draco's cheekiness had finally rubbed on him, and he felt light leaving the track, sure Draco was looking at him as he walked away.
Harry looked back at him, and Draco didn't avert his eyes, staring at him with an open and honest expression that wrenched at Harry's heart; Draco rarely showed any vulnerability, and he had soon learned to treasure those moments.
“Does it matter if I still get what I want?” Harry smirked back, his arms around locked Draco’s neck, rubbing his nose against his cheek.
He hesitated before touching the second picture, enjoying the feeling of Draco's fingers caressing his back.
“That's what you like, uh?” Draco teased him. “You are lucky, I have plenty of those. I'll fuck you while you drool on them, I'll make you feel so good you will come back begging for more.”
With a snort, Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering where his life went so wrong to bring him in those gardens under the scorching sun of mid July. Of course he knew the answer. It was his ancient, squeezed-in-a-box-at-the-back-of-his-mind obsession for Draco Malfoy. It took a lot of work to be able to show up there at the right time. Three weeks worth to be exact.
Harry didn't only find Hermione's Howler in front of his house, but he also found Ron. The redhead was looking at him with a look that could kill. Harry checked to see if Draco was sleeping on the couch, then he closed the door slowly and went to Ron, trying to look like he didn't know what was going on. It was almost midnight and tough it was spring, Harry could feel the cold in his bones. Only to realise it was not cold.
"I'm so sorry, Harry! I'm so stupid! I can't believe I assumed something like that! Please forgive me! I know I have no excuse for myself, but-" Draco's crying was interrupted by Harry's lips that crushed onto his.
When he woke up, he saw Hermione. His woman best friend smiled at him and stroked his face. He gripped her hand and looked at her scared "Draco, the babies. Are they-?".
For the first time since he woke up, Harry talked. "What have I forgotten? Who are you talking about?"
"It's not like I asked him to get pregnant so don't make it sound like it's my fault!" Harry said, then sighed. "Fine, I'll go with him, but if he looks at me again with those broken eyes, like I died, I might strangle him".
James hugged him "I missed you Papa! And I...couldn't sleep. Daddy has been feeling very bad today. He cleaned the house but then he puked and he was shaking and then he fell asleep on the couch".
It was Molly's turn to look down "I kinda told Narcissa and Lucius and they are both very mad and they said they will stop by" she said quietly.
He knew he was falling for Malfoy. He was falling hard and fast, but he wanted Draco to deliver their baby first. He wanted to stay home but he had to work. He would retire, but he loved work. One of his colleagues made a contest. All married guys had to write some divorce papers and who made it seem the most realistic, they would win 50 galleons from everyone in their department who participated in that game.
Anyway, enough about me. How is Blaise? Did you have sex last night after we spoke on the phone? Are you alright?
Draco was so surprised that his appetite died with half of his sadness. He rubbed his belly and nodded "That's...unexpected. But in this moment, I just want to start kissing your feet as a sign of thanking you" Draco said and Harry smiled amused.
"Since you lost your memories, I hoped that you'll remember. I hoped that you'll be like my Harry. But you're not him. You're not my Harry. My Harry would never want to divorce while I'm pregnant, my Harry would NEVER cheat on me, my Harry would NEVER see me just as an useless fat ugly emotional ex Death Eater that's worth nothing, even tough I KNOW I am!! He would never make me feel bad and cry, and he would take care of me and kiss me and make love to me and comfort me when I'm sad! Because I have been diagnosed with pregnancy depression and it's not fun!! And I hate you!! I want my husband back, not this imitation of him!!" Draco screamed, breaking down like a child. Harry rushed to him and tried to hug him, but the blonde pushed him away "Don't touch me! Leave me alone!".
Draco flinched and started shaking, then he looked at anything else but Harry. The raven haired man sighed.
Ron sighed and took a photo album from Hermione's bag. He opened it at a photo from 2002. Harry and Draco were hugging on a bridge.
"Do you know what I told Draco before he married you?! I told him that you're going to be a great husband and an amazing father, that you will always make him happy, and that if anything happens, you will always love him!! And what do I hear from Molly, Draco and Hermione? You want a divorce and you cheated on him!! You absolutely broke my trust!!" Narcissa yelled, getting dangerously close.
"Look, I'm sorry Malfoy, but this is all new and strange to me. I couldn't imagine even being friends with you, and now I woke up one morning and we're married..."
Harry covered his mouth and frowned "Let's go to grab a Butterbeer at Leaky Cauldron, Ron" Harry said.
Hermione's eyes became sad. "Right. Sorry. I forgot" she said, then turned ti to Harry. "Harry, you forgot some things about your life"
Draco looked at him with a trace of sadness in his eyes, and Harry sighed. After they ate, Harry made sure he left a plate for James, then he took Draco to the living room, putting him on the couch. He sat on a chair in front of him and took one of the blonde's legs.
Seamus wanted to say something, but Harry heard a door shut, so he felt like panicking. He was afraid that the man in black came back. Harry hung up and took out his wand, going to the front door. A person appeared next to him and he almost shot him with a spell, but he saw that it was only Draco.
The brunette sat on one of the chairs next to his husband's bed, then he kissed him on the lips and on his head "I'm glad you are alright, Draco. I was so scared that you and the babies were not going to make it. I can't imagine my life without you".
She was so angry, that Ron had to hig her and kiss her to calm the small demon that hid itself in Hermione's little body. The redhead looked at him with a look that said "you're screwed". Hermione took a deep breath.
"Don't, you will not be able to get up until you deliver this baby" Harry said and, for the first time since Harry woke up, Draco laughed.
Draco moaned, and he relaxed under Harry's touch. The blonde's husband massaged his feet for almost an hour, when Draco fell asleep, book in hand. Harry smiled and took the book away, then laid him in a more comfortable position. He covered his husband with a blanket, exactly when the Floo roared.
Harry nodded and stood up, taking the girl from Draco's left arm. He looked at her small features and he started tearing up. She had his nose and his ears and Harry couldn't be happier. He sobbed and carefully holding his girl with one hand, he wiped his tears.
Harry sighed and took two steps back "Draco, it's not how you think, I swear. It's just a big misunderstanding" he said, but Draco refused to believe a word.
Draco moaned, and he relaxed under Harry's touch. The blonde's husband massaged his feet for almost an hour, when Draco fell asleep, book in hand. Harry smiled and took the book away, then laid him in a more comfortable position. He covered his husband with a blanket, exactly when the Floo roared.
Draco made him lay in bed, then he put his head on his shoulder. Harry smiled and started stroking his hair "Sleep, Draco. You neede extra sleep".
Harry turned to him and shushed him, pointing to a sleeping Draco on the couch. He made them a head sign to the kitchen, and the three of them headed there. Narcissa closed the door and put a silencing spell on the room. She looked at Harry with a look that could kill.
Harry smiled and kissed both her cheeks, then said that he wasn't upset at her. The Malfoys left, and Harry went to his office and started working. James was with Ginny for the night, Draco was asleep, so he didn't worry that somebody would bother him.
"And you didn't think this was something important that I need to know?! Honestly, Ronald! Now he thinks I'm just an evil Death Eater that wants to harm him!" Draco said, trying to stop crying.
"Well..." Harry started, but just then a snowy owl entered the kitchen through the window, with a letter, making Harry furrow an eyebrow "Merlin, that was quick".
"You don't know how happy it makes me that you are in my life. Since I've lost my memories, I refused to accept that I'm in love with you, because I was scared to destroy your relationship with the other Harry. And to repress my feelings, I avoided you. But I shouldn't have done that. I now realize how important you are to me, to my evolution. And I've grown to love you. That's the truth. I do love you. Everything was just a big misunderstanding. The divorce papers were just part of a stupid contest at the office. Who made the most real divorce papers, would get 50 galleons from each person in the office. I cheated, that's why they looked real. I took them from the internet. The day of the contest, I forgot them home. That's when you found them probably. They're fake, I swear. I would never leave my husband and my children for anything and anyone, so that excludes the fact that I cheated on you. That letter was from Kingsley. You see, he gave me the opportunity to work from home for the next few months, so I could take care of you and our children. I didn't want to tell you because I knew you would never let me do that. But I want to. I need to take care of you every day and make you smile and laugh and to keep you happy and safe. I love you, Draco Potter-Malfoy, and this is the only thing I'm sure about right this moment. I wish I could've told you this when you were awake, but I am too much of a coward" Harry kissed his forehead, then he went to his room, but not before he heard some footsteps.
Harry picked up the toddler and took him upstairs, putting him into his bed. "Daddy is going to be okay. He's strong. Now, go to sleep".
When he woke up, Ron gave him a glass of water. He took a deep breath and looked at his best friend and then he remembered what happened. He widened his eyes and grabbed Ron by the arm.
So this is the end. I'm going to start writing the next Drarry fanfiction, where they know each other since childhood :))) Have a good day!
He hurried to the bathroom, that was right next to their room. Without meaning to, he heard Draco's phone conversation with Pansy Parkinson.
"It's me, Hermione! Harry, I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I-" Hermione was crying when Harry interrupted her.
"But Ron, it's 2009. When did I meet him again? When did we get married? When has he gotten pregnant with that spawn?"
Draco came closer and passed him, going to the wardrobe. Harry looked at him confused. "What are you doing?" the raven haired man asked.
They waited a few minutes until the healer came and started checking on Draco's health. After that, he spread a gel on Draco's stomach, and Harry took his hand, kissing it. The healer, whose name was Henry Moore, started scanning Draco's stomach, showing them a screen.
HARRY JAMES POTTER-MALFOY!! HOW DARE YOU CHEAT ON DRACO AND THEN WANT TO DIVORCE, WHILE HE IS PREGNANT?! HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?! I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED BY YOUR BEHAVIOUR!! I SPOKE TO MRS. WEASLEY AND WE ARE VISITING YOU TOMORROW! DID YOU KNOW THAT IN TWO DAYS DRACO HAS AN ULTRASOUND?! NO, YOU DIDN'T, BECAUSE YOU WANT A FUCKING DIVORCE!! HE NEEDS YOUR MAGIC AND YOUR STRENGTH IN THE LAST MONTHS OF PREGNANCY, AND THERE YOU GO, CHEATING AND ASKING FOR DIVORCE PAPERS.
He put on his shoes and went into the backyard to his snowy owl, named Hedwig II. He sent the letter to Kingsley, hoping he would reply soon. When he returned to the kitchen, he didn't even have time to take his newspaper and pretend he's been there the whole time.
Draco smiled and took his hand "I'm fine, love, really. Me and Jamie will be fine. You don't need to call Hermione or Pansy. I'm not a child, I can take care of myself" he said, and then he kissed his husband.
“You escaped twice, so did your big, unreal, extended family. Keep them close, you don't have too much time with them. I will start killing each one of them, starting with Malfoy and the children inside of him.”
Draco didn't say anything when Harry picked him up like he was a baby and took him to his room, upstairs. Harry put him on the bed and sighed, checking if he had fever. Fortunately, he didn't. The blonde looked at him with tears in his eyes, but Harry refused to let Draco realise that he saw his tears.
Harry cursed and he found another letter under Hermione's first one. In the second one, Harry could read her anger and surprise. He felt his stomach clutching.
"That's my favorite picture. It was taken a few hours before Draco gave birth. Ginny was screaming at mom and Draco's parents to stop fussing, because they were stressing Draco".
Harry smiled and took Draco's socks off, then he tickled it. Draco chuckled. The raven-haired man noticed how cold Draco's leg was, so he kissed it playfully, making Draco giggle.
Draco took a sip from the tea and forced a smile "Thank you, but...what are you doing home? I thought you have work".
Albus got into the train and him, Hugo, Lily, Rose and James started waving at their parents. Harry leaned into Draco and kissed his forehead, as Andy was telling Ron something.
Suddenly, Kreacher, their former house elf, appeared between them, holding a camera. Harry looked at the house elf confused, then Kreacher played the video, turning on the volume. Harry recognized his own voice and James's gasps, meaning that the little boy recorded him.
He put three plates on the table and two eggs in each one of them. He also arranged in the middle of the table more breakfast food, so that Draco could have a choice. Harry smiled at Draco's plate, then he cleaned the kitchen and got rid of the food smell, by waving his wand. He made coffee and put some into his own cup, then started writing a letter to Kingsley, telling him that he wanted a week off to help Draco and find a nanny for his son.
Draco giggled, but soon he fell asleep under Harry's touch. When Harry realized that the blonde was sleeping, he sneaked out of bed and went to the kitchen. He poured himself some whisky and saw a letter from an unknown person. He opened it.
James nodded and buried his face in the pillows. Harry left the room silently, then he went to his office and started working until the morning.
Ron took a deep breath, then pulled a very pale Draco back and whispered something to him. The blonde started sobbing and he held his stomach, as Hermione hugged him. He then looked at Hermione and Ron a little angry.
Harry chuckled and Draco hit the back of his head again. Ron laughed, so Hermione did the same thing as Draco.
As soon as they entered the hospital, Harry felt a sharp smell of blood. He thought of Draco and his heart started pounding. What if his babies died? What if all three of them died? As soon he and Ron reached the delivery room, Harry saw a flash in front of his eyes, remembering Draco's first pregnancy. He felt another sharp pain, thinking how he abandoned Draco when he forgot him.
Harry couldn't sleep all night. He hated himself for what he did to Draco. That was the moment he realised his mistake.
Harry left the room and after he closed the door, he sighed. He wanted so bad to run away and never meet his child's eyes of Malfoy's. But he couldn't do that. Still, he could avoid his son James and his former enemy.
Harry couldn't calm down until he saw Draco and James at home, safe and sound. He didn't gave Ron any explanation on his sudden departure. He just Disaparated and went home. Before he entered the house, he picked up the mail and looked at Hermione's Howler. He sighed.
"Just wanted to grab a drink, like mates!" Harry said loudly, then whispered to his best friend "I thought the protecting system would make you figure it out. Someone has been following us. Don't look now. The man in black at the bar. Act along."
Ron looked at Draco, who was shaking as Hermione gave him a pill. The redhead knew that Draco won't be able to take Harry's shit as long as he was in that condition, but he and Hermione would keep an eye on their best friend.
Ron shot the man a quick glance, then turned to Harry, whispering "Hermione told me about the divorce papers, about the fact that you are probably cheating and about you avoiding Draco for two months. Harry, this is not you! What is going on?"
Harry smiled and took Draco's socks off, then he tickled it. Draco chuckled. The raven-haired man noticed how cold Draco's leg was, so he kissed it playfully, making Draco giggle.
"I want you to relax, because you are way too tense" Harry said, as he started massaging Draco's foot.
"It's so hard, Pansy! I mean, we have only one house elf, that occasionally cleans a room or two, because Harry and Hermione freed all the house elves from Grimmauld Place and I have to do everything. I have to clean, to cook, to take care of Jamie, to work and I barely have time to eat or sleep. And I'm exhausted. Yesterday I went to the doctor and he told me that if I keep exhausting myself, the baby will die at birth. And also, I need Harry's magic! Otherwise, I may not be able to finish this pregnancy. But Pans, what can I do? I can't even get a moment to talk to him! How am I supposed to tell him that if he doesn't help me I will loose this child? I went to appointments alone and he is literally invisible. Like he's not even there! I'm so tired, Pandy. So, so tired" Draco was crying as silent as he could. "And I miss him. I miss my Harry that used to rub my feet, and make me breakfast, and kiss my belly and kiss me and make love to me, and even though I was in my first Trimester, he wouldn't let me do much exercise, afraid that I'll hurt myself. I miss those small things! I just want my husband back. Memories or not, I want him back. And even worse, he wants a divorce! A divorce, Pansy! I saw the papers on his desk when I was cleaning his office today. I did something wrong, I'm sure of it. I'm a horrible person, Pansy. Only thinking about myself".
Harry felt a bit guilty, knowing he upset Malfoy, but not enough to quash the sense of triumph at having him railing against his ex.
Draco had been out of sight for a few minutes now. Being all alone in a new place made him feel uneasy, but not having people close helped him slightly relax.
“Well, I can hardly blame them, and things are getting better. My mail hasn't burst into flames in a while now.” Draco's lips curled up at his attempted humor, but there was still a bitterness in his voice to undermine it.
Grateful for her help, Harry smiled at Hermione as her fingers swiftly fixed the crooked knot of his short tie. He had found his formal robes hidden away at the back of his wardrobe; he would have rather worn something more casual, but the event demanded formal attire, no exception, not even for a retired war hero.
“Good.” They both turned to Ron, whose ears were burning red and his face half hidden behind his glass.
“I was not fine,” he shook his head, “when he died, I had no other purpose. I was nothing. People began moving on and I was stuck.”
here?” Harry asked, frantically looking around the room until he spotted them. Luckily for him, Callum had his back turned on Malfoy and him, he couldn’t have noticed them yet.
“You shouldn't believe everything you read on the papers,” Draco sneered, “I have dated plenty of guys that didn't end up on those articles.”
“What did you do?” he asked, glancing at the wand Draco was pointing at his crotch, but he winked as he put it back in his pocket.
Harry sighed. An official Ministry event was the last place he wanted to be that evening, but he had given Hermione his word he would make an effort and show up at one of those at least once a year, and the Children of War Foundation was one of the causes he held dearest to his heart, but still, he couldn't help but feel hundreds of eyes staring at him.
Since that night, Harry turned a blind eye to his calls. And texts. And e-mails. Consumed by the need to find Draco, Callum had instantly become a distant memory, a nuisance he hoped would soon disappear from his life.
“Thank you for that,” he mumbled waving his hand before Harry’s face, who almost missed the come on his forehead now that it was gone, cleaned up with a silent spell, he guessed as he got up on his feet, accepting the water bottle he was handed.
Malfoy brought the bottle with him as he led Harry back into the main hall. Shooting around closed-lipped smiles, he followed, doing his best to stop his gaze from slipping down on Malfoy’s arse, nicely wrapped in a pair of tight jeans.
“So, what kind of cuisine does she make?” Harry asked peeking at the menus the waiter left on the table.
“When someone from the past comes to see me, they usually want to hex me, yell at me or shag me, therefore my question, which one is it?”
A few tables away, Hermione had sat down at Draco's table, and the two of them were talking. From their body language, they both looked at ease with each other. Hermione was laughing while patting Draco's arm, and he was giving her a smirk. Harry was sure his jaw had dropped on the floor.
“What kind of party is this?” he asked, diverting his gaze when Malfoy dropped his briefs on the floor to wear a different pair. He shrugged again, apparently unfazed by being naked in front of him.
Harry tapped the tip of his fingers against the gold-rimmed ceramic, as he waited for the tea to reach the right temperature before walking out of the kitchen.
Orgasm mounting fast, the familiar feeling bubbling in his belly. Judging by the shivers shaking Malfoy, he was close, too.
With the corner of his eye, Harry caught a glimpse of Callum passing by; he shook his head to shoo away the feeling of being closely guarded. Ron's words still rolled in his mind. He shot Draco a quick glance, biting on his lips as he gathered the courage to ask the question on the tip of his tongue.
“So,” Malfoy stopped to take a sip from the bottle, “you and Cal, uh? What does that make me? The other – man? The mistress-er?”
Then came the punch in the gut, taking his breath away and sending his mind for a hell of a spin. A black and white picture hanging on the wall with a bunch of others. Harry didn’t even bother to look at the others, his attention stuck on the stupidly pretty face of Draco Malfoy, his gaze lost in the distance, his pointy features softened by the grey shades. Enough to ruin his night, no doubt about it, but he and Callum could have survived it hadn’t he made the fatal mistake of taking his pause in front of that particular picture as a sign of interest in his work, or maybe a way to get things going. Harry didn’t ask. Callum had taken out a whole album of Malfoy’s pictures.
Malfoy’s heavy breathing above him was the only thing he could hear over the pounding of his heart. Harry fiddled with the semen dripping from his fingers, reassured by the fact that Malfoy didn’t look in any better condition. Now that his lust was sated, he looked like he didn’t know what to do with himself either.
Harry looked at him, shifting his position oh so slightly trying to understand what Spell Draco used. His boxers shrank and the fabric felt softer on his skin, and Harry wished he could see it.
“Keep watching the photos,” Draco whispered, his tone lewd and rough. Harry blinked at his request, his head empty, his heart roaring in his chest. He looked down at the pictures on the table, brushing his fingers against the last one. He licked his lips, basking in the view of the new picture. Draco was still in the shower, facing the camera this time, a red towel tactically placed to cover his dick, leaning with his arm against the shower stall, raised eyebrows in a pleased expression. Harry held his breath, unable to look straight into those eyes, so intense he felt they were staring into his soul.
“Thanks.” He smiled at her, but Hermione shook her head, her earrings beaming under the light of hundreds of candles.
“I guess I did dodge a nasty Hex there,” he said instead, hoping it would bring the conversation back to a more casual tone.
Draco chuckled, gently pinching his skin right below his buttcheek, and Harry left out a sigh of relief when he stood back up, giving him the pause he so desperately needed. He leaned on the table, his legs too weak to sustain him. The gentle touch of Draco's fingers on his back a welcomed soothing balm as Harry tried to come back to reality.
“I didn’t – ” he paused, “I didn’t know how to live in a world without Voldemort.” Harry ignored the grimace on Malfoy’s face at the name.
He gasped, his fingers flickering with the need of getting closer to the Draco in the picture to wash his back and play with the drops of water and trails of bubbles gliding down his pearly skin.
“You like them?” Draco teased him. Not trusting his own voice, Harry slowly nodded without lifting his eyes.
He left a kiss on Draco's chin, and he arched his eyebrow in response. Judging by the expression on his face, Draco grabbing his ass did not surprise him at all. He rubbed himself against Harry, holding him still to create more friction. A quick sigh left Harry's lips.
Harry turned again, but this time Draco had disappeared from the table now empty. He couldn't help but feel disappointed, he had hoped he would get to wish Draco goodnight before leaving. Harry looked for him through the crowd, but Draco was nowhere to be seen.
“Really?” he whispered, his lips tugged in a grin, “Is this really enough? Don't you want something more?”
“That's hot,” he grumbled with no hesitation in his voice, and that seemed to melt away part of the tension gripping Draco.
“What - when did that happen?” Harry asked, unable to look away from those two, still talking to each other. That was more than getting along, that looked more like being friendly from where he was standing. Well, sitting actually, but still.
He barely had the time to catch a breath once he was out of the crowd that somebody put a hand on his arm. He regretted the tug to free his arm when he turned and found himself face to face with a police officer.
“And you guys didn't tell me because...” Harry let his sentence open, bothered by Ron's reticence. When did he stop telling him things?
He flinched at the kettle whistling on the pot. Adding cream, he brushed his fingers against Draco's cup; he had brought it with him the first time he came over, lamenting having to drink his tea from a Channon cup, but Harry had kept all his comments to himself. He liked having Draco's things around, it felt like his way to say he was there to stay, and that cup, well, it was only the first thing Draco left at his place.
Best part was the corner of the one he sent visible beside the sink in Draco's bathroom. He had taken the picture for him, and for him only.
“Because I didn't realise it at first and when I did it was too complicated...” Draco let his voice die down.
He had lured Harry in his room, stripped down to his underwear and then fallen asleep as soon as his head had touched the pillows, his hand softly laying on Harry’s chest, a constant reminder of what could have been, and one of the reasons he couldn’t sleep properly.
“We are getting better at this,” Harry whispered, peeking over his shoulder; flashed and disheveled, Draco stared back at him, his lips, slightly parted, tugged in a smirk, a blissful light warming his eyes. He leaned forward to leave one last kiss on his back before helping him lay on the carpet, rolling over beside him, running his fingers through his hair to try and fix the mess Harry made of it earlier, during a particularly intense snogging session.
Harry snorted at the comment. “It worked,” he said, walking up to the table. Laying on top of the box in the middle, a single picture of Draco sitting on the kitchen counter, looking at the camera with a smirk on his face, long naked legs dangling underneath him. Harry bit his lips. He could see himself getting closer to the man in the picture, wrapping those legs around his waist and kissing him until he lost that cocky smirk. What a delight it would be to make him lose control of himself.
Draco slowed down, coming to a halt, and took off his shirt, using it to dry himself as he walked toward Harry.
He licked Draco's lips, softly sucking on it, before he moved on to his jaw line and then his neck, leaving behind a trail of pink marks on the porcelain skin. He smiled hearing Draco sigh.
Harry’s heart roared in his chest, his senses tingling his fight or flight instinct, but his feet were glued to the floor. He wasn’t going anywhere.
Curiosity had him put his hand in his pocket right after Draco left the bar, and his fingers recognised the smooth surface of a picture, but he hadn't had the chance to look at it yet. He saw it as a reward for being there that night, but also brought him to wonder how Draco knew they would meet or if he just walked around with a picture to give away just in case.
“Thanks for telling me. I won't freak out, I promise. You say he is alright and I trust you.” Harry tilted his head, infusing as much honesty in his voice as he could. He and Ron exchanged a long look, but in the end his oldest friend chose to trust him too. Ron nodded, gently squeezing his arm.
Sitting in his favourite chair, Harry stared at his own name, neatly handwritten on the back of the envelope. He didn't recognize the seal impressed into the rich red wax, but he smiled at the little flower stuck in it.
So, he winked in an attempt to reassure her further. “I'll need a couple more of this first,” he said, swinging the empty glass before her eyes.
“Aren't you a tease,” Draco mumbled when he gently bit the soft skin under his ear, as Draco's fingers played with the hairs on his thighs. The glance he shot him sent a shiver down Harry's spine and right into his cock. In any other context, it would have raised an alarm in his mind, making him run like the wind, but in that moment it made his blood boil.
Draco's hand on his belly brought a smile on his lips and he sighed when Draco kissed him again, nuzzling against the back of his head.
And to think Callum caused his own demise. Using his word-wild famous work as a photographer as a rouse, he welcomed Harry into his home. And up until then, Harry had been into him. Taller, light blond, snobbish and sarcastic, Callum ticked almost all the boxes to be his type. That night he was horny and ready to sleep with him.
Harry cautiously tasted the purple, glittery mousse as he nodded to something Robards was saying, not really listening. Everybody was still heartbroken he had given up his Auror training a few weeks in, Harry didn't need to hear that story again. He had no intention to go back on that decision, but having that discussion again might bring problems for Ron, so he simply shrugged and kept his attention down on his plate.
“I mean, he does seem nice,” he said, carefully observing Malfoy’s expression. “A bit conceited, perhaps,” and Malfoy’s lips trembled.
Harry walked to the fountain, summoning a few treats for her. Keeping himself busy helped him ignore the racing of his heart. He didn't expect her back so soon.
“I wanted to be an Auror, did you know that? I remember telling my mum I would be the best Auror the Wizarding World had ever seen. That I would go on adventures to catch the bad guys and keep her safe. I remember she smiled and ruffled my hair. I was just a dumb kid with big dreams. Clearly no point signing up for the Auror training programme with the Dark Mark on my arm.”
“I don't mind being here with you, but the running... I guess I'm more out of shape than I thought – ”
All and all, Harry had worse nights. Sitting next to Shacklebolt turned out not too bad, the Minister treated him like Harry and didn't push too much for him to join the conversation. He fell in love with one of Cal's pictures, but feared that bidding on it would send the wrong message, so he kept quiet during the whole auction. There was nothing he wanted or needed, and he had already sent his annual donation directly to the foundation.
Harry swallowed the envy grasping at his throat at how easy they made it look, to bring his attention back on the woman before him.
Silently chuckling for getting away with it, Harry turned his back on Malfoy once again. Better not push his luck any further.
“People always have expectations,” he sighed, “They want to date Harry Potter, but when it comes to just Harry...”
He could have sworn a Spell hit him: his skin tingled where Malfoy kissed him, over and over, new sparkles bloomed at every kiss. It felt nice, but not enough to distract Harry from the fingers sliding over the crease of his hip and under the elastic of his boxers.
Without paying attention to where he was going, he followed Malfoy into the kitchen, where he was studying every single bottle available on the counter.
Draco followed him soon after, with a last, deep thrust before collapsing on his chest, face buried in the crease of Harry's neck, who hugged him and caressed his back, leaving kisses on his hair.
“Ok, one hour and then we can leave,” Draco said, leaning in to steal another soft kiss from Harry's lips, his arm wrapped around his hips like he feared Harry would pull away.
“Not really,” Draco sneered. “But in my experience, this kind of thing tends to divide men in creeps and those who run the other way.”
He raised his eyebrows, biting on his lips as he took a step back. Harry frowned, but his pout melted into a smirk as soon as Draco began unbuttoning his own shirt, letting it slide along his arms and onto the floor. His belt hissed when Draco tugged it out of its loops.
Malfoy’s breathing was the only noise in the darkness, his body warm against Harry’s, his arm pressed on his hip, his fingers tangled in Harry’s shirt.
“Harry Potter?” the man barked a couple of inches from his face. Harry nodded, shivers running down his spine, hands sweating all of a sudden.
Without thinking, he put a daisy behind his ear; he picked a few more to arrange them in a crown. Keeping his fingers busy helped him focus on his thoughts.
“Good. Sure,” Harry bit his lip. “I guess I should – ” he paused again, unsure how to explain what he needed to say.
Harry propped himself up to look at his face. “There's people who don't?” He couldn't help but snort when Draco nodded slowly, chewing on his lip.
Harry winked at him before picking up the mauve panties. Now he had time to properly look at them, he had to admit Draco chose them wisely. Simple, no weird lace or frills, and a natural, hearty color. They did look like the kind he would choose for himself if he ever had to buy a pair of panties.
Harry blinked. Another voice for his ever growing ‘Was not expecting this’ list. He watched Malfoy fix his hair for a moment, then the address again. Not like he had anything better to do, and yes, Malfoy owed him one.
He sat down next to him, elbows resting on his knees and eyes studying Harry's face, before stealing one of the daisies from his hair to put it behind his ear.
“I guess I just wanted an excuse to spend some time with you, I didn't think – ” the smirk was back on his face, but his eyes were still dense with concern for him. Harry gave him his best smile, but he feared he came out looking more like a sour face.
“No thanks,” he whispered, “I want royal blue now. We will have to make the whole one-bed thing work.”
Distracted by the warmth building up in his belly, Harry only managed to blurt out a “Uh?”, which gained him another chuckle.
Callum wasn’t the only one who left. The party had calmed down while they were locked in the bathroom, the crowd reduced to a few handfuls of people chatting around the living room, and a few more admiring the view of the gardens from the terrace.
“I mean, it’s not like I disappeared from the Wizarding World, I still go to the Burrow for lunch every Sunday, and I go for a pint with the guys, although making plans is tougher now that Ron and Hermione have kids, but still – ” Harry swallowed. He would have given up his fortune for a glass of water at that moment. He felt raw and exposed, and the piercing grey eyes staring at him didn’t make him feel any better.
Hearing stomping on the track gravel, Harry lifted his eyes. Draco had taken a turn and was running towards the point where they had stopped before. He looked completely focused on his run. All flushed and messy-haired, Harry found him gorgeous.
His gaze fell on the tip of Malfoy’s nose, slightly moving with his breathing. Harry didn’t know where the impulse came from, but he bumped it softly with his finger, freezing when Malfoy sneered in his sleep, but there was no other reaction, so he left out a sigh.
Malfoy gasped on his lips when Harry closed the distance between them, throwing his arms over Malfoy’s shoulders as he seized his mouth, impatient and demanding. The man's surprise didn’t last long as he kissed him right back with matching intensity.
His gaze fell on Draco's torso, glistening under the sunlight. Harry took in a sharp breath, he was still not used to the effect Draco had on him. A painfully clear image of himself licking away the sweat drops from Draco's body and tasting his salty skin played before his eyes; Harry sucked in his lips, wondering if Draco would let him do it.
“A few years ago,” Ron mumbled, and Harry didn't need to look at him to know his face was as red as his robes.
“What is it, Duchess?” he asked again scratching the back of her head. She patted him with her soft tail, showing appreciation for the cuddles, but her yellow eyes were still staring at the sky. Harry chuckled, not many things would wake her up or keep her from getting a full belly scratch.
They reached a white gazebo, softly lit with floating candles, where three people were gleefully chatting
He didn’t need the pitiful look Pansy gave him to know how pathetic he sounded, his burning cheeks were enough for that.
He shook his head in disbelief. The ridiculousness of his situation dawned on him for the millionth time. He didn’t have a plan, he simply showed up in the hopes of – he didn’t even know what he hoped for. That Malfoy would see him among the crowd and fall at his feet?
Following his example, Draco had written little more than a note. A few lines in the same handwriting to inform him the shooting in Rio went all right and now Draco was back in Milan. In the last line he wrote he would be back in London at the end of the month, asking if Harry still fancied the idea of going on a date.
Harry looked in the direction he suggested, and the soft shade under the branches did look tempting, but he didn't like the idea of disappointing Draco leaving him alone.
The woman shrugged, sincere amusement blooming on her face. “Well, better now that Draco owes me ten Galleons – ”
The grass felt nice between his fingers; Harry leaned against one of the trees, taking in a deep breath of fresh air. He had to admit the place was delightful. Set in the countryside, the track ran beside a bubbly stream, surrounded by trees that offered plenty of spots for a break. He had never been there before, but Draco had assured it was one of his favourites, secluded enough they could be sure nobody would bother them. And he was right on that, too, the few people they met were too busy with their own exercise to pay attention to each other.
“Yeah, but that time we were also busy with the naked dumbass in the main fountain demanding someone take pictures of him.”
She leaned in to kiss Malfoy on his cheek before walking away, immediately lost in a sea of people, leaving them still embarrassed but now alone in the kitchen.
“Ok, then,” Draco said warily. “You owl me with yours, so I'll know you are thinking of me and I can write you with that one.”
Neville swept in to save them all from the embarrassment – and to save Malfoy from Pansy’s murderous look.
“I don't mind the acknowledgment, but I don't like making a fuss about it. Usually I have dinner with the Weasleys, open my presents, eat Molly's cake and go home. Simple things, no fuss. You know, for future references.” Harry blushed, as his soda became the most interesting thing he ever saw.
A soft smile tugging on his lips, Harry watched his fingers skim tenderly on the points of a snowflake, playing with it as, Harry assumed, Draco decided where to put it.
“And I said I was going to make us some tea,” Harry mumbled in response, blinking to clear his head.
Finding Malfoy would have been easier hadn’t Harry lived under a rock for the best part of the last ten years. Or had any of the Slytherins he asked gave him a proper answer.
“I'm sorry,” Draco said, his gaze on the ground and a new shade of pink on his cheeks that Harry doubted had anything to do with the exercise or the fresh air.
“Enough about him,” Malfoy said. “What about you? From what I heard you dropped off from the face of the Earth – ”
Harry bit his lower lip, only then realising the opportunities that new position had to offer. His cock laid almost right on top of Draco's, and, rocking his hips, he rubbed them together. The fabric between them only added friction to his teasing.
Harry tilted his head, “I’m not,” he paused to plant a soft kiss on the top of his nose, “I'm just trying it out.”
When his gaze fell on the boxes on the table, though, he forgot every thought about the furniture. The three large boxes left little to no space on the table. Harry glanced at Draco, who offered a smirk in response.
“I said in a few minutes,” Draco chuckled as he moved a glass snowflake a couple of inches to the left.
Harry felt the electricity buzzing on his skin, Malfoy so close it was enough for every ounce of rationality he had left to fly right out the window.
Hermione gave him a sad glance. “I'm so sorry, higher-ups insisted, but it will be just for the dinner, I promise.”
“Hey,” he brushed, but the curiosity was too strong to be swept away. “Do you really have those pictures?” The silence following his question knotted his stomach. Draco tensed up in his arms and his fingers stopped caressing his hair.
“That makes me feel better,” Malfoy sighed dramatically, “I would never participate in such immoral endeavours.”
Malfoy even had the audacity to sigh in his ear, and Harry was ready to throw in the towel and go back to his room. But then his skin tingled under Malfoy’s breathing, so he sighed in defeat. He wasn’t going anywhere.
He took in a sharp breath, blood boiling in his veins, startled by the chuckle coming from below. He blinked in surprise when Draco tugged his trousers down to his knees, and Harry managed to take a peek of his own panties before Draco yanked at those too. Deep mauve panties, he spotted a tiny bow on the front and their nice contrast against his golden brown skin.
The music volume had turned down as well, Harry realised humming along the song playing in that moment, it now worked as a background for conversation rather than a nuisance disrupting it.
“I'm ok,” he whispered against his lips, kissing him as he arched his back to help his body stretch to welcome Draco inside him.
to be here, but his body was frozen in place. He suddenly felt unprotected. Exposed. Vulnerable. Too close, too
“Because I love you, Potter. Because you’re kind, generous, irritatingly brave and smarter than you give yourself credit for, infuriatingly argumentative, handsome, and can wandlessly hurl very heavy shit at me when I’m being a prat.”
Still several feet away, Draco’s gaze roamed over Harry, his father’s ranting portrait, and the bureau, absorbing the current situation.
“Huh?” That uncharacteristic response didn’t inspire confidence, but Draco soon continued, “Uh… yes, the others are fine. Weasley… why don’t you go downstairs and check the ground floor for residual dark magic?”
Oddly, that really helped. Harry could do this, or not. And although Draco’s lidded eyes betrayed his true feelings on the subject, Harry was certain that he could have Draco buggering him in less than a minute if he flipped them both over and freely offered his submission.
Finished dressing to what he decided was an acceptable standard, Harry moved to stand directly in front of Draco, face close, fishing for a kiss. “I like to
Weasley’s left eye was developing an erratic twitch. Draco tensed, preparing himself for an upcoming rant, but Weasley spun on his heel and padded hastily out of the dormitory, muttering a query to the room at large. “Why does Hermione have to be
The selection in the display was interesting, Harry decided. Without the distraction of trying not to hack on every breath, he could see the value in the goods which ranged from brightly-coloured children’s school supplies to more solemn and expensive items not dissimilar to those being sold by Draco. A lot of them were overly ornate for Harry’s tastes, but what looked like a simple brown leather journal caught his eye. Harry might enjoy doing some writi -
“I could stand here and tell you that I told you so,” Harry said. “But I think the point’s being made pretty well for me.”
Harry groaned with gratitude as his rim stretched to accommodate the invader, then his inner walls shifted as it moved in, in… a tiny bit out, then Harry almost shrieked as it relentlessly continued inwards, forcing its way into Harry’s rectum. More, more, bloody hell… how much more? Harry could stop its progress with a single spoken word, but he was not inclined to. He’d never had anything as large as this inside him. And he was thankful for every inch of it.
“Nothing is without risk, Potter. And you know that I could persuade you. All I’d need to use is a particular tone of voice and you’d be longing to please me.”
But Harry supposed that Draco’s fascination shouldn’t be surprising, given his upbringing. It was kind of adorable, but Harry decided not to mention that.
As Draco used the grip on Harry’s wrists as leverage to push himself up and back, Harry automatically lifted his legs and curved his hips to provide access to his hole. But, for the first time with Draco, he wasn’t sure if he wanted to allow this to happen.
Harry wished he could believe that possibility was as absurd as it sounded. Some of those old ladies were
I can do,” chuckled Draco. Harry rolled over, found his comfy spot upon Draco’s chest, and closed his eyes. His shoulder was nudged soon after. “Hey, don’t go to sleep.”
Although the idea of turning Lucius Malfoy’s portrait into a fireball had previously been entertaining, Harry wasn’t sure it’d be the kindest option for Draco.
, as I choose. I think that’s an important fact you forgot during your infantile tantrum. I’ll make sure you won’t forget again. Do you understand?”
“They miss you, Harry. They all understand that you were extremely busy running the country but to be honest, I think they might’ve been hurt that you couldn’t find
“Do you expect us to bare our souls?” Potter asked. “All our innermost secrets? Sorry to disappoint, but I’m not going to do that. And my secrets aren’t that interesting, anyway.”
Potter claimed Draco’s wand again, cast cleaning charms over both of them, then replaced the wand on the nightstand.
“You asked them not to give a shit about you, so now they don’t? Great friends you have there. Very loyal.”
Harry felt a distinctly wet snort against his shoulder. “Are you trying to turn my own advice around on me?”
to my reluctance. But I also liked what we did in my conservatory today. So, there’s definitely room for more experimentation. To find out more about what we
it… taking a deep, deep breath, Harry closed his eyes yet again. He clenched the scroll in his fist, noted every crinkle of parchment where it touched his skin, envisioned all the shapes and strokes of the words that had trapped him and concentrated on the level of his desire, his
Harry sighed but complied, extracting himself from Draco to sit up with his back against the headboard. He may as well get comfortable. If Harry was required to sit up to hear it, the list might be fairly long.
Malfoy growled hoarsely, voice betraying the abuse which he’d subjected his throat to. “We will discuss your punishment for
“I have so many things to teach you,” Harry teased, pecking a quick kiss to Draco’s lips. He wanted to linger for a better taste, but time was limited.
Yes, Harry did. Of course, he did. In an abstract sort of way. Harry had held the most important official role in Britain for the last three years, he wasn’t naïve. But the harsh justice he would’ve sought for someone else who had been subjected to that coercion didn’t seem apt for him. Harry was used to bad stuff happening to him; it was the way things were sometimes.
Disregarding the gapes from the other occupants of the table, Draco manoeuvred onto the bench between Potter and Weasley. Potter didn’t look directly at Draco, but the expression of fury on Weasley’s face made the risk Draco was taking more than worth it.
been Harry’s home. Molly hadn’t wanted Harry to go off on his own immediately after the whole Voldemort issue was over, so Harry had lived here until he’d found his own way. And Harry had cared for each member of the family as if they were his own. A fact which would only make it worse if they knew the truth about him.
“No,” Harry answered. “Yes. No. I… do, a bit… but I’m… worried.” Harry was worried about questions, worried about judgment, worried about running into Ron or Michael, worried whether Molly and Arthur would accept Draco
the Ministry, fuck the delegates, fuck the endless trade agreements and all the rest of it. Fuck his fucking life.
“There you are. I got preoccupied with…” Draco stopped short a couple of steps into the study. “Oh. Hello, Father. Umm… you remember Harry Potter, I'm sure.”
“No,” Harry giggled, the absurdity of his situation sinking in. “I don’t think so.” But he considered that a lot of work might be needed on his magical control if his unrestrained power was cracking heavy desks in two when he came. The earlier magical issues might’ve also highlighted an issue.
Draco revelled in the contact, the rapid rise and fall of his chest, the pooling pleasure in his groin and belly, until Potter suddenly stopped moving his fist. The fingers retained their firm grip though as Potter’s other hand nudged Draco’s head up.
“Just in case. I’m not planning leather restraints on a first try, but I won’t do this without one. I’ll need to know if you want me to stop." Then Malfoy grinned, which seemed out of place in that serious moment until he added, “I’ve read about that.”
“I’m going to need… a minute.” Draco whispered back. The hardness poking into Harry’s groin explained why. But it wasn’t as if Harry’s erection was any less… prominent. “It’s your family. You go first.”
After a break for lunch, Draco was explaining the difference between the many classifications of Arithmancy books when a new type of movement from Lucius caught Harry’s eye.
Draco rolled his hips slightly, sliding forwards within the groove, paying close attention for any signs of objection. When the only response was a slight wiggle of Potter’s hips, Draco slid back a few inches, encouraged by the quiet but unmistakable sound of a groan.
Potter looked doubtful about the merits of Draco’s intentions. “A stroll in the pouring rain… and you constantly imply that it’s
When Potter eventually spoke, it was a distinct anti-climax. “Like I said before, just to talk. I thought that, maybe… but it doesn’t matter.”
“Right. Okay,” agreed Draco, thinking that it might prove safer not to call him anything at all. As Potter turned over, Draco was mortified to be shaking at the prospect of what might be about to occur.
Harry chuckled again. “You’re going to need to sound more convincing than that if you’re trying to reassure me.”
Draco wasn’t allowed to play Quidditch anymore, so that was hardly an appealing topic. “Boring. What I meant,” Draco spoke with an inflection which he hoped wouldn’t be misinterpreted, “is what do you have to
Draco’s hips were rocking in earnest; a constant motion to complement Harry’s busy fingers. It was obvious that Draco was becoming impatient to be fucked soon. But as Harry listened to the breaths of rising expectation, anxiety and doubt began to overrule his arousal. Although Harry had initiated this, Draco had probably only agreed to satisfy his curiosity about why other men had badly desired Harry in this position. Draco would want to know what all the
The arrogance in his tone struck Harry’s nerves, but before he could tell him off, Malfoy moved from the sink, taking a step toward him.
Harry shot him a glance with the corner of his eye; Draco was studying one of the crystal spheres, but the smirk still curled his lips.
“Come in.” The voice was different, and yet so familiar it was enough to make his heart jump in his chest. Harry rubbed the palm of his hands on the jeans before opening the door.
Harry brushed his fingers to the pictures in his pocket, the only positive note of the evening. Consumed by curiosity, he wondered if he had the time to find the bathroom and take a quick peek of the image, but that would have meant walking through the room, in front of everybody, all alone, as he couldn't ask Ron to go with him.
“You know what? I'm done, I can't... doing this to a cheesecake should be a crime, we are leaving,” he sneered, throwing the handkerchief on the table.
“It was a joke,” Malfoy said in a small voice, but Harry saw, and appreciated the concern in his eyes. He sighed before drinking a sip of whisky, riding its burning feeling as he tried to bottle everything up.
“It's fine,” he then added lifting his hand to stop Harry's response. “Not like I was dying to come in the first place – ”
Which, ultimately, was the reason he was standing there, pressed against the barriers put up for the occasion, surrounded by people trying to catch a glimpse of Malfoy as well. Giving the man on his left a quick glance, Harry wondered if he should have brought flowers too.
Harry swallowed. Draco’s glance brushed over his skin, leaving it tingling and yearning for his touch.
And it was not for lack of trying; ever since Draco came back into his life a couple of years before, Harry had done everything in his power to establish and maintain a civil relationship with him, thanks to Neville crossing over to the dark side to date Blaise Zabini. Not that Harry could blame him, he had eyes too after all, but Draco made it almost impossible for them to get along, with his snarky remarks and rolled eyes. Rather childish, all things considered, especially when Harry winking or smiling at him was enough to get him all flustered.
Harry arched his eyebrow, surprised by it, and took a peek. A naked Draco had his back turned to the camera, his head tilted to let the water from the shower head run down his neck and back.
A smile curled Harry’s lips. Never in a million years he would have guessed he would find himself in that situation, watching over a sleeping Malfoy. Did he know he was cute? Lips parted and the occasional mumbling in his sleep? He probably knew that too, but the Malfoy he remembered would never accept to be called ‘cute’. Harry wondered if
“Correct,” Harry nodded, handing over the cup, “One in kindergarten, and then I helped him with the others.”
As in, he woke up at least once every hour, all hot and bothered, crying in frustration. He couldn’t help but feel like Malfoy was pranking him somehow.
“You remember where your room is, right?” Draco waited for Harry to nod before continuing, “You should go mess up the bed, then, you know, plausible deniability.”
“Been together a couple of years, my career finally taking off, so I was traveling a lot. Came home from a shooting one morning and he had packed my bags, saying he was in love with some other guy.”
Harry still hadn’t recovered from the shock of Draco Malfoy having social media profiles, but the pictures, the interviews and the videos were all over the internet for everybody to see.
“That’d be nice,” Draco said, his tone so plain and polite like they were exchanging pleasantries all of a sudden, but the glance he shot him stirred up the fire in Harry’s belly.
Malfoy sighed in his ear, his fingers flickering over the elastic of his underwear. Harry held his breath, melting against Malfoy’s chest. He didn’t move a muscle, afraid to scare him off, but Malfoy got over his hesitation, his fingertips running over the bulge in Harry’s boxers, gently teasing him, but still cautious, like he feared Harry would take his hand off.
He laid back on the table, leaning on his elbows. He didn't know how to be more explicit than that, but luckily Draco got the hint.
“We can stay longer if you want to,” Harry said. If Draco could do it, he didn't see why he couldn't, also, this being a Muggle place, the chance someone would recognise and bother him were close to none.
Draco turned to look at him, an eyebrow arched. “But I don't want to,” he said. “The owner is an old friend and I promised I would stop by at her great opening, an hour is more than enough, she is not that good of a friend.”
Harry blinked at his back. The officer’s voice had softened into a whisper and the quick eyebrows lift the police officer gave him before turning eased the weight on his chest. He reassured himself brushing the tip of his fingers against the wand safely tucked into his back pocket before following the agent down the path in the park.
“Tell you what,” Draco said. “Why don't you go rest under those trees? I'll join you as soon as I finish my laps.”
“I don't know,” Harry shrugged, “A nice walk, maybe? Definitely not jogging.” He massaged his side, hoping it would help with the pain. Definitely not what he expected from their second date.
Meanwhile, Hermione had noticed his cold greeting with Cal. “How are things between you two?” She asked.
Draco ran his finger through his dark air, nibbling at the soft skin of his neck. He was tender and careful with Harry's body, changing his pace to indulge his needs.
His eyes shone in the dimly lit corridor as they walked toward the end of it, with Malfoy stopping before the last door on the right.
He held his breath watching him stretch to reach near the top of the tree, the lines of his back caressing his movement, his calves blooming under his skin in the effort to reach just an inch higher.
The moon was hidden behind fluffy looking clouds when they came out of the restaurant. A light breeze ruffled his hair.
He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath before diving in. He let its length slide down his throat, pulling back when Malfoy’s hairs tickled his nose. Moving his head back and forth, he dictated a slow, lazy pace that still had Malfoy moaning and gasping in no time.
Harry pressed his lips together to stop himself from laughing. Using Hermione as a shield against his boss was Ron's oldest trick, and it worked every time. Ron swore Robards was terrified of his wife, and Harry couldn't agree more.
“Wow,” Harry whispered. He felt the bitterness in Draco's voice, but they were in public, so he didn't dare do anything to reassure him.
Harry arched an eyebrow at Draco's comment, but his next words killed any hope blooming in his chest.
“Some of us have real jobs, Malfoy, we can't all be pretty for a living,” Ron clapped back, his eyes rolled and a sneer on his face. He looked like he already reached his limit of tolerance for Draco; he patted on his thighs and stood up from the stool.
As they went on reminiscing funny episodes of their past, it felt natural for Harry to sit among them, admiring the ease Neville clapped back at the Slytherins, even going head to head against Malfoy and coming out of it unscathed.
He raised his hand and nodded to greet Callum from the other side of the bar counter; luckily for him someone else stopped to talk to him before he could walk over there. Harry didn't recognize the witch, but deeply thanked her.
“I've never tried it, but it does sound interesting,” Harry replied warily. “Is this making you uncomfortable?”
“Technically.” Malfoy hit him with another of those smirks of his. Harry had seen them before on magazines and shootings, but having it right there, in person, that was heartbeat-skipping material. Or at least it was to Harry, who gulped down half his beer to drown the Billywigs in his stomach.
“No,” Harry finally answered, “I had different expectations, too.” He ignored his own flushing cheeks as he stared back at Malfoy.
Harry cast a few spells to clean the dried sweat, feeling much better once he couldn't smell himself anymore. Usually he didn't mind, but waiting for Draco made him self-conscious about it. He then ran the fingers of both hands through his hair trying to tame the wild locks on his hair, combing them back, away from his face.
His first reaction was an amused snort as his gaze fell on a beautiful, white Persian cat elegantly laying on a bed and staring right at the camera. Looking at those incredible eyes, Harry understood why Draco would give his cat such an unconventional name.
“Well, I don’t, but I do. I was happy growing up. I know what people think of my dad, but he did love his family. We were happy.” Malfoy paused to down a sip of whisky.
“I have to get back to work,” Malfoy said, turning his back to scribble something on a piece of paper.
Harry shook his head. No idea what he was talking about, so he shrugged. It didn’t matter anyway, he just wondered why so much of his life revolved around bathrooms.
Harry looked away; he had blurted out his comment without thinking, he couldn't blame Draco for finding the conversation upsetting.
Chewing over the possible consequences of disapparating right there and then, he failed to notice they were walking in circles. The agent wasn’t leading him out of the park, he simply had him walk around the trees beside the shooting spot.
Two decades. Draco had thought he was pretty for two decades. If anything, it showed his consistency. The thought had Harry lightheaded.
Unable to resist the need to look at the man he was falling in love with, Harry turned on his back, hurt to find him distracted, his head facing the other side, his chest still fluttering as he tried to catch his breath.
Harry tangled his fingers between the sheets, arching his back to expose his throat to Draco's teeth. The soft cotton caressed his knees as he dug them into the mattress to gain more traction to rub their cocks together.
“No, that's not – ” he began, pausing to put order into his thoughts, “I didn't know you were interested, I guess I just didn't think of that, I mean – ” Harry stopped his mumbling to take a deep breath. He peeked at Draco's face, still refusing to look at him, with the expression of someone who would rather take care of a Blast-Ended Skrewt than be having that conversation.
‘This is a first’ was his last coherent thought before the feeling of Malfoy’s semen, thick and warm, hitting his face pushed him over the limit.
“Well, they are wrong, I want to see them, I want you to do the things you said.” Harry managed to finish his sentence despite the burning feeling on his cheeks. Draco sighed at his request, another reaction Harry didn't understand.
Harry turned his head, Draco sounded genuinely hurt by his reaction, taking away his hand and meeting his glance with a perfect pout of his own. He guessed he could try to explain himself, but he also knew actions speak louder.
Harry smiled on his lips, parting his own as Draco dove his fingers into his hair, leading him into a deeper kiss that took his breath away and had his heart jump in his throat.
“Malfoy.” Hermione nodded warily, a strict smile tugging her lips. Ron barely raised his hand, and that was good enough a greeting. Harry sighed, dabbing his fingers against the counter.
His gaze fell often on Malfoy, so handsome under the candles light, as he smiled and returned in kind all the teasing and jokes he got.
Ginny had confided him how her family was giving them a hard time since she brought Pansy home, and he had sworn he would support her the best he could.
Harry was aware the two of them had been together for years, Blaise even joined the Gryffindor group on many occasions on their nights out, but he had never been at their place before. From the little time he got to know him, the house was surprisingly modern. Despite staying out of the war, the Zabinis were one of the oldest Pureblood English families, so Harry was expecting something more similar to Malfoy Manor.
“Well, yes,” Draco blushed, “at first I was pissed you didn't want to be my friend, it never happened before so it caught my attention, and then... I guess I never looked away...”
“What is it?” Harry asked when his cat, until then snoozing under the sun, got up staring at the clear sky. He lifted his gaze, but he didn't see what had caught her attention.
Deep down he knew magazines had the tendency to print whatever would sell more copies, they still insisted on writing about him despite all the precautions he took to protect his privacy after all, but he had also received reassurances like that by his partner before. In the end they all figured out he wasn't exaggerating when he said he much rather stay at home or at least avoid crowded places.
And it was right then, staring at that last picture, that Harry realised he had to find Draco Malfoy, he had to find him and make him look at him like he did in the picture. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt so determined as when he had stormed out of Callum’s apartment, this new mission the only thing in his mind.
The silence fallen upon them grated at his nerves, as he frantically looked for something to say, but before he could come up with anything even remotely interesting, he gasped at the sight of a shiny-eyes, elegantly dressed Pansy Parkinson striding toward them, effortlessly fending through the crowd. He didn’t have much love to spare for the woman, the memory of her willingness to hand him over to Voldemort still bothered him when he stopped to think about it. Add to that her recent engagement to Ginny Weasley, the grimace on his face should have come with no surprise for anyone.
“I'm not sure." Draco frowned. “I think Celia said something like fusion or futuristic. She also used the words experience and concept, but I wasn't following anymore, I don't know what she meant," he added as he played with the melted plastic thing in the middle of the table Harry assumed was the centerpiece, and it startled them when it began fuming as soon as Draco moved a little lever.
“You know, I should still have a few of those panties somewhere if you are interested.” The smile curling Draco's lips did not reach his eyes.
Harry blinked, sure Draco was making fun of him, but his arched eyebrow suggested otherwise. “G – girly panties?”
“Wow, you are really bad at this,” Draco chuckled, but he still sent the half-empty cup floating toward the mantel, turning to wrap his arm around Harry’s hips.
“Then I turned fifteen,” he sighed, “my dad went to Azkaban, a monster moved into my childhood home and Aunt Bella was teaching me to kill people – ” his voice broke, his gaze lost in the memories of those days.
Holding his breath, he reached out to brush the tip of his finger against Malfoy’s cheek. He wrinkled his nose in response, but didn’t wake up.
The image was too much for Harry to handle. Adding tights in his fantasy had his mouth water. He knew that pictures existed somewhere in the world, and the idea pushed him closer and closer to the edge.
He cleared his voice before finishing his thought. “I tried putting them up in my loft, too, but I got a lot of complaints from fans and my agent threatened to Hex me, so...”
“Yeah,” Malfoy yawned, “Blaise’s mum thought naming the rooms would make keeping track of them easier.”
Draco must have felt the concern in his voice, because he tilted his head and gave him a soft glance. “Of course,” he reassured him, but Harry shook his head.
Malfoy still didn’t look convinced, but he shrugged and let it go. “Fine,” he sighed, “not my fault I thrive on chaos and drama.” His comment brought a laughter to the group, easing the tension that arose after their arrival.
“A little get together, uh?” Harry smirked as they barged through the crowded living room. He noticed a few familiar faces, but nobody close enough for him to stop and greet them. After welcoming them on the door, Zabini had disappeared again, probably busy with some sort of host-duty.
“It's Malfoy, of course I checked when he showed up at Hermione's office. He is still an ass, but it looks like he did clean up his act. He is alright, I guess,” Ron shrugged again as Harry raised his eyebrows. Hurt and confused, he needed a moment to take in Ron's words.
Harry bit the tip of his tongue. “Doing what?” he asked in his most innocent tone as he ground his cock against Draco's, and Harry could have sworn he felt it tug back.
The bitterness in his voice wrenched at Harry’s heartstrings. Malfoy looked so vulnerable in that moment, sitting in a tub reminiscing of a life that could never be. He patted his arms, at a loss of words to comfort him, but Malfoy wasn’t done yet.
Harry gave up on the whole cuisine when his chocolate cake turned out to be some fumes he was supposed to inhale from a vial. Draco's face was his only consolation. He looked defeated. He had dutifully taken pics of the dishes to post on his profiles and clapped loudly when the chef, a young, chubby woman with bright green hair had paraded around the room, but once his job was done, he was left staring at the dark red droplet in his plate, a berry cheesecake in theory, but clearly not.
Harry snorted at the comment, impressed by the nonchalance Draco cut through the crowd with, ignoring the protests and dirty looks he got from the people around them.
Harry wrinkled his nose at the Cleaning Spell, but made no comment about it, focusing instead on the man that cast it. A disheveled Draco was pulling up his panties, his throat covered in pinkish marks where Harry had bitten him, his eyes still darkened from the passion they had just shared, and his cheeks flushed. Harry noticed his lover didn't look back at him, so he frowned, sitting up straight with a groan of pain.
It took him a moment to find the strength to walk away, but he needed a break; with a certain irony he was willing to admit, the terms of their relationship might have changed, but he still found it hard to focus with Draco around.
Harry groaned in protest, but still moved to let Draco free to get out of bed. He watched him walk around the room as he got dressed.
Harry swallowed at the sight of the new photo, and didn't hear Draco drop on his knees. In the shot, he looked like he was tiptoeing away from the camera, wearing only a pair of black lace panties that hugged his hips and barely covered the upper half of his arse.
He stuck his finger inside Draco's pants, pulling him closer. He smiled at his pleased expression as he leaned forward to kiss Draco on the lips, glistening and bright red.
Malfoy’s voice, husky and low, startled him and made him look up. The man was staring back at him, with darkened eyes and flushed cheeks. His lips were swollen and bright red, like he had been chewing on them up until then. The flames burning inside his eyes engulfed Harry, who felt compelled to listen to his request.
He nuzzled under Draco's neck, glad when he wrapped him in a sweaty hug, seeking his lips to kiss him over and over until Harry calmed down.
“Long time indeed,” he answered, lifting his gaze from Malfoy’s chest. He was looking back at him, arched eyebrows and curiosity shining in his eyes.
The professional shots turned into candids of Malfoy doing mundane things, drinking coffee, his eyebrows lifted in an amused expression, or a red-faced Malfoy wrapped up into a huge scarf not so amused-looking. Harry flinched at the final series, back to black and white. Malfoy was sprawled on the bed, naked and yet so composed, looking directly into the camera, a dangerous, daring light in his eyes. It looked so intimate and natural, no way it was staged.
Soon, Harry found himself gasping for air, his body shaking with burning hot pleasure, his mind light and empty; he wrapped his thighs around Draco's hips to pull him closer as he reached pure bliss with a hoarse moan, digging his fingers in the muscles of his back.
“Anyway,” Pansy said, “I’ll be expecting my money by the end of the night. And, Draco, love, work on your blushing-bride act, because this isn’t it.”
Harry licked his lips, waiting for his joke to land, and landing it did. Draco shot him a shocked glance, but could do nothing to stop the chuckle in his throat.
“Maybe,” he shrugged, “but still... I see no point in getting dressed. Since you let me fix your tree, I’ll be feeling quite grateful in a few minutes.”
Harry wrinkled his nose, but the smile on his face betrayed his thoughts. That did sound like a nice plan.
Draco turned to give the waiter a quick smile, while Harry chewed over his words. He was not wrong, but he didn't need to say that out loud, Draco looked smug enough as it was.
“I thought maybe going back where it all started might help, so I moved to Godric’s Hollow. It’s an old village, nobody lives there anymore, it’s quiet. I built a cottage next to my old parent’s house, I take care of my little garden and my parents are right down the street. I love it,” he shrugged, “I just – I guess I let the routine get the best of me. Weeks turned into years and I’m still there, on my own.”
"Look, Hermione, if you feel guilty, then don't. You're protective of your friends and it's a quality I very much appreciate at you. So don't be upset. But darling, you need to understand to leave things to solve on their own. Draco is sensitive these months and he sees things different, but don't believe everything he says. Talk to me about it, because he won't. So please, for the love of God, mind your own business" Harry said, then he smiled at them both.
Harry gasped "Draco, I can't, I'm afraid that I'll hurt you or the baby", but when Draco laughed, Harry accepted the offer.
Harry restarted cleaning and tried to tell himself that Hermione will be nice and kind, but deep down he knew the truth. He was damned. And he only realised that when an Howler arrived in their mail.
Thinking it was just imagination, he went to his room, not knowing that James recorded him from the very beginning.
Draco and James entered the kitchen, the blonde clearly talking to their son "Ginny will take you to kindergarten today, because daddy has to clean the house and he needs it to stay clean, alright?"
"Oh, Harry, I'm so sorry! I literally couldn't believe when I heard! But I just snapped, you know? I sincerely apologize" Narcissa said, eyes teary.
"Well, they are a boy and a girl" the blonde said, and Ginny gasped, hugging Draco very tight "Air, Weasley, please".
Harry nodded and felt his husband's lips on his. He smiled and broke the kiss, looking into his eyes "But I still want us to get married a second time".
The other man suppressed a laugh " 'Ello Harry! Everything's goin' good! My question is how's your life goin'? Is Draco alright? Are you alright? My whole department heard about your accident and your amnesia. I hope you didn't damage your marriage very much" Seamus laughed, making Harry roll his eyes.
"Albus Severus Potter-Malfoy. You have such a strong name. You were named for two head-masters at Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was, probably, the bravest man I've ever met. And look at your daddy. He was in Slytherin too and he is amazing and devoted. The house you're in doesn't change your character. But it it matters to you, the Sorting Hat takes your choice into account".
Draco suffered a lot that pregnancy, he suffered because of him, and now their babies might not even survive? Harry thought about two little kids running to him, James following them, and his heart ached. He started stupefying every single Death Eater in the room, without even blinking. Then, he glared at everyone but Ron, and grabbing the redhead, he Apparated to St. Mungo's.
When he returned home one night, during Draco's sixth month, trying his best to be quiet, he saw his former enemy on the couch, in the living room. Draco was sleeping, making no sounds, his big belly not being covered with anything. Harry looked around and realized how clean everything was.
Narcissa and Lucius looked at him surprised, and then the woman burst into tears and threw herself into Harry's arms. Harry sighed and hugged her back.
Entering the room at St. Mungo's, Harry felt nervous. He held Draco by his arm, too scared to let him walk on his own and fall. He let the blonde sit on the bed and lay down.
The brunette ran into their room and laid next to Draco, taking him into his arms. The blonde opened his eyes slowly and yawned.
After Draco told his son that Papa is alright, just a little confused, James went on with a house elf and left his dads alone. Harry entered his room and realized that it smelled like Malfoy. He sighed and turned to his "husband", who looked at him with those broken eyes.
Draco laughed and once again, he fell asleep in Harry's arms. Harry, however, could only think about one thing: an amazing surprise for Draco.
"I want you to relax, because you are way too tense" Harry said, as he started massaging Draco's foot.
"I'm so sorry, Harry! I'm so stupid! I can't believe I assumed something like that! Please forgive me! I know I have no excuse for myself, but-" Draco's crying was interrupted by Harry's lips that crushed onto his.
The other man suppressed a laugh " 'Ello Harry! Everything's goin' good! My question is how's your life goin'? Is Draco alright? Are you alright? My whole department heard about your accident and your amnesia. I hope you didn't damage your marriage very much" Seamus laughed, making Harry roll his eyes.
Narcissa and Lucius looked at him surprised, and then the woman burst into tears and threw herself into Harry's arms. Harry sighed and hugged her back.
Harry felt his heart beat faster. He knew the man who hit him with a spell was free, but he didn't think it was something personal. He threatened0 not only Draco and their children, but also the Weasleys and the Malfoys. Harry drank all the whisky and closed the kitchen door, then he put on his headphones and started listening to Voulez-Vous by Abba.
Ron stopped him and helped him get up. He saw the worry from Harry's face and he smiled to himself, knowing that Harry without memories was finally learning again to love Draco and James.
"Mate, you lost your memories of Draco... I mean, you two are married. And while I still don't really understand your relationship, I know he loves you. And you will remember everything, I promise" Ron said, but Harry stared at Draco.
"A game and a letter. Nothing serious but even the smallest things can be turned into something bad. And I guess he believes I only see him as an useless fat ugly emotional ex Death Eater that is worth nothing, judging by the fact that he is insecure, domestic and sad, and trust me, I'm more afraid to hurt him than the baby" Harry said, laughing lightly "But I love the guy, Seamus. I really do. I don't know how I was and what I felt before I lost my memories, but one thing is for sure. He makes me happy".
Albus stopped and stayed behind, so Draco signed Harry to go to him. The brunette crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Harry looked into Albus's eyes, his mother's eyes.
"Seriously, Harry, we were really worried that you won't make it. Do you know how the Ministry announces families that an Auror is down? It's an alarm, like a bell, ringing through the Floo. If it's not something very bad, ir rings three times. But if it's bad...it rings 15 times. Rosie said that it rang at our house too. But when the alarm started ringing at the Burrow...Merlin, I will never forget Molly's face. She was pale as death and she started sobbing. She is like your mother! Think about how she felt, thinking that another son could be dead! Think about me and Ron and Ginny, who were visiting and we were ready to Apparate anywhere to see what was wrong with you! Merlin...and I can't even think how Dra-"
For the first time in a while, guilt cut him deep. Going in the kitchen, he saw a plate with pasta and sighed. Harry heard some footsteps and turned to face his son, James.
The pijamas fell from his hands and Draco held his belly. He sat down on a chair and took a deep breath. Harry came next to him a little nervous.
"It's not about Kingsley" Ron said harshly "It's about Draco. I mean... dude! What the hell are you-"
Harry sighed and though he was a little engrossed by the whole situation, he picked Draco up, bridal style, and put him on the bed a little too harsh "Rest. Maybe I don't like this situation, but Hermione told me about how hard it is to be pregnant and you can't sleep on the couch".
"Do you know what I told Draco before he married you?! I told him that you're going to be a great husband and an amazing father, that you will always make him happy, and that if anything happens, you will always love him!! And what do I hear from Molly, Draco and Hermione? You want a divorce and you cheated on him!! You absolutely broke my trust!!" Narcissa yelled, getting dangerously close.
Although, I'm a little surprised by the fact that he made breakfast. I don't know what to think and you know that this doesn't happen very often. I am going to talk to him nicely about it, and explain to him what he did wrong, as you are too afraid to hurt his ego. Everything will be alright, don't worry.
Harry sighed and explained Molly and Hermione everything, then the two women gasped in surprise and guilt. Molly hugged Harry really tight, while Hermione looked down.
Harry bit his lip to stop himself from grinning, then hid the letter. He looked at Draco, whose eyes were filled with sadness "Alright, so I thought I should stay home to take care of you and to help you around the house. This way, we can bond and I can keep an eye on you. Also, I'll take Jamie to kindergarten today and until I come back, you'll stay put, okay?"
"Mal- Draco, are you alright?" Harry asked, looking at Draco. "You know, uh... I'll take the couch. I mean... Ron would kill me if he found out that I let your pregnant ass to sleep on the couch, so you can take the bed."
Harry smiled and nodded, excited. He gathered all his strength and picked Draco up, then took him to bed. After he made sure he was comfortable, Harry sat next to him, on the edge of the bed. Draco stared into his eyes.
Harry tried to allow the rational part of him to absorb what Draco was telling him. To understand. To
Commitment made, Draco muttered a spell and watched as the letter turned to flakes of ash, fluttering down to the floor.
okay to reply in the affirmative. “Magic… pppft,” he offered, aware that it was one of his typically undescriptive explanations of his sometimes-wayward power.
But reading about these things was a far cry from doing them unsupervised. Harry hadn’t been working in Ollivanders for long and had no previous wandmaking experience, so this seemed way too soon for him to be making a wand from scratch. People usually apprenticed for years before they got to that point. But Luna had her own ideas about many things.
Harry opened his eyes, surprised at how wet his eyelashes felt as he blinked. Draco was kneeling between Harry’s legs, looking flushed and sated. Draco’s eyes were still alert though; pupils blown wide with lust.
Right now, that wasn’t as much of a deterrent as it should be. And as usual it must’ve been plain on his face.
Harry was kneeling facing Malfoy, the ruins of the desk beside them. As he scanned over the mess, he noticed the contract on the floor about a foot away from him. Harry presumed it must have rolled off the desk, either before or after the collapse of furniture. Nothing was different now though; Harry’s situation remained the same. Body tensing, shoulders hunching with a sudden rush of despair, Harry lowered his head and clenched his eyes shut, so he didn’t need to look at the source of his anxiety.
Minister anymore, as I understand,” Lucius said with a smile which didn’t look any more sincere than his nod had been.
Wrapping his other arm around Draco’s torso, Harry encouraged Draco back down to lie atop him. Wanting to give time, Harry stayed quiet, letting Draco breathe harshly against his skin. The wait was indeterminable, but Harry refused to rush.
The result of Harry’s wave was the removal of the silencing charm. The room was immediately filled with an imaginative combination of pure-blood ranting and explicit homophobia. Harry hadn’t heard a few of those insults before. He didn’t think some of them were physically possible.
But all too soon, Draco climbed with as much dignity as possible through the portrait hole. The bang which the portrait made as Draco slammed it shut behind him didn’t go unnoticed by the common room’s occupants. Even Potter, located exactly where Draco had predicted, shuddered as the wooden frame connected with unyielding stone wall.
“Do you want me to fuck you, Malfoy?” asked Harry in an echo of Draco’s earlier question. Harry was affronted and primed for progress but wanted to check for continuing consent before he did anything else.
Harry was reluctant to open doors and be overly nosy on his own, but a door about halfway down the hall was ajar, so he didn’t feel so much like he was imposing as he nudged it open the rest of the way and stepped over the threshold into the centre of the room. It was spacious, but not overly so. Cosily oppressive. A padded leather chair was tucked behind an large, ornate desk near the far wall which was covered with heavily laden bookshelves, but not nearly as extensive a collection as the previous room. A study, Harry decided. He peered up at the decorative coving in a corner of the ceiling, trying to decide what animal the carving was meant to depict. A bear, or an extremely badly rendered dragon, that was maybe more lik -
stupid, he reconsidered as Draco perched on the edge of the bed behind him. Harry could just see Draco’s hand in his peripheral vision, and it seemed that he was getting ready to make a productive move. This was confirmed when Harry felt cool, wet, smooth glass prodding at his arsehole. Draco hadn’t prepared Harry nearly as well as the toy, but the edge of pain only served to make the push inside him more delicious.
,” stressed Draco, evidently thinking that Harry needed further convincing. He wasn’t wrong. It didn’t seem that clear cut to Harry. “Did you press charges?”
to have known that’d end badly.” Harry had been puzzled about Ron’s apparent naivety back in the Burrow. “I couldn’t understand why he would truly believe that I’d do Michael a favour. People like to think that Ron’s stupid, or rash, and he

naked when I answered the call,” Draco conceded. “My mind was slightly… preoccupied by trying to stay downstairs for longer to emphasise my assertive point when all I wanted was to go back and ravish you. You looked so hot with that thing stuck up your arse. It took immense willpower on my part.”
“Okay,” repeated Draco. It didn’t look like Draco thought it was okay. “Hmm, did you know that Weasley and his partner had both been applying to replace what’s-his-name as Head of MLE when he retires?” Draco asked.
“And you believe that,” Harry said as he moved closer to Draco. “It… helps. I’m… still trying. But your message might be starting to gradually sink in. Enough to deal with
After he’d made it down about three more steps, Harry realised that Draco wasn’t following him. He turned, curious about the delay and saw that Draco was regarding him with a scrutinising gaze and a quirked eyebrow. Harry was about to ask what the problem was when he suddenly understood.
“Oh… a counter-offer?” Draco said before he threw the duvet off himself and the bed, sat up, swung his legs over the edge and stood. Harry was pleased to note that Draco’s wand was certainly celebrating its rigidity. “Get your hand off the merchandise.” Harry complied, uncurling his fingers as Draco walked slowly towards him. “What does my wandmaker require tonight in exchange for his services?”
“I don’t want to be a Dark Wizard,” Harry said. He shut the wardrobe door and walked towards Draco, quickly adding more before Draco’s expression fell too far, “I just want to be
“Financial and employment difficulties do hurt, but I feel that a more… permanent solution would ensure your continued safety.” A bad feeling was growing in Harry’s belly. “We’ve found some intriguing things in the Manor, haven’t we? Within one room in particular?”
Shortly, Draco found himself back in the position in which he’d awoken, but it seemed like the best place to be, so that was fine.
Now he was here, Harry only felt slightly like fleeing. He was still anxious, but the easy, flowing nature of the Weasleys’ chatter was like coming home. He supposed that’s what it
“You’ll do no such thing,” warned Harry as he rose to his feet, embarrassingly aware after he’d said the words that they were usually Draco’s turn of phrase.
Harry wasn’t sure what to think about that, so he kept his silence, hoping Ron would explain further about how he apparently
An indeterminable time later, Harry heard Draco walk back into the kitchen and a series of clicks which indicated that the flames had been extinguished beneath the frying pan. A stasis charm followed, presumably cast upon the partially-cooked food.
"You're beautiful, Draco" he whispered, making the blonde blush "And I don't know how you manage to be that beautiful while carrying twins. You're incredible, really".
Then, the letter blew raspberry and it burned itself. Harry sighed and canceled the silencing spells, then went to Draco's room and entered slowly. He was in a deep, deep sleep, so Harry sat at his head and started stroking his hair and face. He watched his swollen belly and smiled.
"It's Draco! He- he went into labour but your magic transfusion from every night was not enough how I said, because there are two lifes inside of him, and the babies...the babies might not survive. I'm so sorry, Harry. It's all my fault. I'm so-"
Harry shot Kreacher a murderous glance, but the elf looked at him confident "I'm sorry sir, but master Draco had to know the truth in order to forgive you".
"Jesus" he said. "It smells like you in here. Mint and...something else. And stop looking at me like that!"
"Trust me, you did. I do love you and I only realised that a few days ago. Not your Harry. Me. I can't wait to get my memories back. Then I'll maybe realize my unconditional love for you, because you are the most loveable person I know. And I'm serious. I love you, Draco. And this is not your Harry or mine or something else. This is just Harry. The same Harry who had no idea he's a wizard until 11 years old, the Harry you married and who lost his memories. It's just Harry. And Just Harry loves you a lot" Harry spoke from his heart, taking Draco's hands.
"They're fine. Draco has no idea about this...attack. Two aurors came to ask about you and Draco said you weren't there. It was the most subtle way, I promise. And then the two aurors reported directly to me that they were alright. So calm down" Ron said, and Harry drank all the water from the glass.
Harry smiled and kissed both her cheeks, then said that he wasn't upset at her. The Malfoys left, and Harry went to his office and started working. James was with Ginny for the night, Draco was asleep, so he didn't worry that somebody would bother him.
Harry realized Malfoy had the same blonde hair, that he was annoyed of. But what made Malfoy different, was the fact that his stomach was swollen. He stiffened a laugh.
"Hi baby, it's Papa. Tomorrow we will find out if you're a boy or a girl. I hope you're a girl" Harry said to the belly, kissing it "Don't be to aggressive, baby, and I won't make daddy sad. We need to keep him sane and happy".
He drank two more glasses of whisky, but he stopped when he saw a flash of an image. He realised that he saw himself and Draco in a shop, looking at each other with hate. Harry took a deep breath and ran into the bathroom, looking at his figure in the mirror. Suddenly, some images of him and Draco appeared in front of him.
I'm glad you finally accepted the fact that you are married and that you have two children, one on the way. Because you are the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, you are allowed to work from home so you can stay until a month after your baby is delivered. A tip: at Draco's first pregnancy, you told me he liked when you rubbed his feet. And to be honest, I believe it will work now too. Take good care of Draco and I hope I'll see you both soon.
"You don't know how happy it makes me that you are in my life. Since I've lost my memories, I refused to accept that I'm in love with you, because I was scared to destroy your relationship with the other Harry. And to repress my feelings, I avoided you. But I shouldn't have done that. I now realize how important you are to me, to my evolution. And I've grown to love you. That's the truth. I do love you. Everything was just a big misunderstanding. The divorce papers were just part of a stupid contest at the office. Who made the most real divorce papers, would get 50 galleons from each person in the office. I cheated, that's why they looked real. I took them from the internet. The day of the contest, I forgot them home. That's when you found them probably. They're fake, I swear. I would never leave my husband and my children for anything and anyone, so that excludes the fact that I cheated on you. That letter was from Kingsley. You see, he gave me the opportunity to work from home for the next few months, so I could take care of you and our children. I didn't want to tell you because I knew you would never let me do that. But I want to. I need to take care of you every day and make you smile and laugh and to keep you happy and safe. I love you, Draco Potter-Malfoy, and this is the only thing I'm sure about right this moment. I wish I could've told you this when you were awake, but I am too much of a coward" the recording ended, and Draco looked pale as death.
"Healer Moore, is something wrong with Draco? With the baby?" Harry asked, panicking, his heart starting to race painfully.
Harry looked at the man in black and saw that he was watching them. He quickly looked at Ron and whispered back "It's just a big misunderstanding. The divorce papers are from that stupid game at the office. Remember I forgot them at home? I cheated. I took them from the internet, that's why they looked so real. And I would never cheat on him or anybody else. It was the letter from Kingsley. He told me that I could work from home, but I knew that if Draco found out, he would insist on me going to the office. And he needs my help! I heard him talking to Pansy. Mate, he's miserable. I want to help him because I think I lov-"
Harry giggled and shook his head, then he started walking towards Draco "And I told you to stay put. It's not that hard". He gathered all his strength and picked him up, laying him on the couch. His legs didn't touch the floor, so Harry found it a perfect moment to cover the blonde with a blanket.
Draco yawned again and put his head on Harry's chest "Remember what?" he said, and then he widened his eyes and raised his head to look at Harry, a small smile on his lips "Wait, really?".
Draco closed the wardrobe and held some pijamas. "I'm taking my pijamas for the night. I assume you don't want to sleep in the same bed as your enemy, or former enemy, so I'll take the couch and you can sleep in the bed" the blonde said and started walking to the door, Harry looking at him speechless, wnen he felt a sharp pain in his stomach.
Seamus gasped, and Harry moved the phone to his other ear "Well, what did you do this time?" Finnigan asked, curious.
Harry smiled and nodded, excited. He gathered all his strength and picked Draco up, then took him to bed. After he made sure he was comfortable, Harry sat next to him, on the edge of the bed. Draco stared into his eyes.
His heart started pounding faster, and his vision became blurry. He supported himself by leaning into the wall. Harry felt like he couldn't breathe and closed his eyes, passing out on the floor, Ron shaking him worried.
The brunette laid in their bed and he went close to Draco's belly. He started stroking it softly, and Draco smiled, hoping it wasn't a dream.
"Hey mate" Harry said "What's bringing you here? If Kingsley wants me on the field, you can tell him that-"
"Smooth, mate. You're very encouraging, thank you very much" Harry said, giggling "And me and Draco are fine. Everything's alright between us, except for the fact that he believes I want a divorce, and that I cheated on him!"
"James, be good. Don't cause McGonagall any problems" Draco said, as he pushed him and the twins to the train "Lily, honey, don't listen to your older brother and take care of Albus!".
"I prepared more stuff for breakfast, because I wasn't sure what you'd like" Harry said, then pushed him slowly on the chair "I also made you some tea because I know coffee isn't good during pregnancy."
Lucius looked at him with hate in his eyes, but Harry stopped them both "Oh God, this is just a big misunderstanding! I explained this to everyone! The divorce papers was a stupid contest at the office, that I regret! I lost that stupid contest anyway! And I didn't cheat on him! I got a letter and it was from Kingsley and I grinned because he let me work from home for a few months, so I could take care of Draco because I FUCKING LOVE HIM!!"
When Harry woke up the next morning, he was confident to repair his mistake. He prepared breakfast and as he was doing so, he called an elves store to buy one, so he could take the elf when he came home after visiting George's Tricks shop. Hermione would go nuts, he knew that, but Draco needed help.
"Oh, Harry, I'm so sorry! I literally couldn't believe when I heard! But I just snapped, you know? I sincerely apologize" Narcissa said, eyes teary.
Draco nodded and started crying, then he kissed him and as he was doing that, he took down his marriage ring and put on the engagement one. Harry broke the kiss and bit his own lip.
Seamus wanted to say something, but Harry heard a door shut, so he felt like panicking. He was afraid that the man in black came back. Harry hung up and took out his wand, going to the front door. A person appeared next to him and he almost shot him with a spell, but he saw that it was only Draco.
Seamus gasped, and Harry moved the phone to his other ear "Well, what did you do this time?" Finnigan asked, curious.
Harry woke up because someone was banging on the front door. He yawned and opened it, revealing two angry faces. Hermione and Molly Weasley. Harry glanced behind him, hopind Draco didn't wake up, then he looked at the two women and took them out.
Harry smiled at Draco, who sighed even more offended than before. But somehow, Harry knew Draco was happy that he stopped hin from working. The raven haired man kneeled in front of him, and felt the crazy urge to kiss Draco.
Harry took the address from Draco and took Jamie to kindergarten, apologizing to Ginny when she came to pick James up. Harry and his son made it to kindergarten just in time. Before the raven-haired could let Jamie go in, his three year old hugged him tightly and kissed his cheek smiling, then he ran into his class.
