“It hasn’t been going well for a while, actually. I mean, you know me. Never was very good at doing what I was told.” He aims for a self-deprecating laugh, but it comes out tired and a bit defeated. “Turns out the DMLE was a lot more interested in the idea of me than the reality.”
Prompt Eighteen:
“I only told her what it was like for me,” Draco continues, more seriously. “Telling strangers was comparatively easy. Telling the people I loved most was hard.”
Harry thinks about Dobby. He thinks about Kreacher and his own dusty house, and what it will be like to go home to when his friends aren’t coming over every evening to plan an adventure. The idea of hiring an elf to just have someone to talk to seems a bit desperate. And he’s never found them to be conversationalists.
would print their story.
Harry sighs, leaning back on the cold bench, looking up at the gaudy lights around them.
“I doubt it,” he shakes his head. “I don’t think they’d want to be associated with me even to rip me off.”
Sato drops her wand, and lets out a little gasp. Malfoy just rolls his eyes.
. Harry, avoiding yet another useless pile of leads on the missing witch in Shropshire, and Malfoy, pacing around his office solving puzzles like some sort of sexy professor.  “Yes, but I just wondered—”
Harry never ordinarily bothers with
“And so then, what? I was a coddled pureblood child who didn’t know the first thing about looking after myself. The Mark meant I couldn’t get legitimate employment, even on the continent where they like to pretend the war was just a
Harry shrugs it off. “We have been merciful. None of them got the punishments they deserved, really.”
“Just bring both, please. I’ll explain when you get here.”
“Sodding cold out.”
Mina gives him a thoughtful look. “Viktor’s not answering my owls at the moment either, but if anyone knows where Draco is, it will be him.” She hands him a scrap of parchment with an address in Romania on it.
“You don’t need to know what these mean, exactly,” Malfoy says, and he reaches into the inner pocket of his suit jacket and retrieves another, folded sheet of parchment. He smooths it out on the desk alongside Belle’s results. Even Harry’s extremely untrained eye can see that the arcs and lines follow similar shapes.
Harry buys a box of training Snitches to take home. His students will love them.
“You could have splinched me,” Harry complains much later, lying warm and content against Draco’s chest, tracing idle patterns over a tattooed vine.
“Actually, I think I saw it,” Harry offers tentatively, pausing the footage. “That was really impressive.” Mina gives him a pleased smile. As he explains to the team how she’d leveraged the speed from a conventional feint with the assist from her sister in a kind of slingshot manoeuvre around Wood, Harry starts to feel the warm satisfaction of learning something exciting and new himself.
“Scarfed?” Harry asks, curious.
He stalks out of the room, with Ron hot on his heels.
Hannah leads their little chain carefully, swimming over the uneven ground. Soon Harry can see submerged below him the steps where the boats tie up. The gap between the roof of the boathouse and where they’re swimming narrows, becoming more like a tunnel. Up ahead he can make out the passageway in the rock that will take them up into the castle.
Harry pulls their joined hands toward him, pressing a dry kiss to the back of Draco’s knuckles.
“Very well. Lovegood and Longbottom keep their jobs,
Neville passes out the Gillyweed.
Malfoy nods. “If you can find one here who’ll see me.”
Ron raises his eyebrow at the “we” but Cassie looks curious. “We’re listening,” she says.
“Give me a hand, Malfoy,” he sighs. And Draco flushes as he realises this is not a
literally?
Harry huffs out a wet laugh, his throat feeling a little choked up.
. The whole thing. If he confessed, Hermione would probably have him committed.
He’s in that hazy state before sleeping when his magic surges over his skin and he’s suddenly wide awake, feeling the angry bend of the wards. He reaches for his wand as he hears a scuffling noise and a curse outside.
Ron sniffs noisily and nods his head.
There’s a long silence while Malfoy just stares at him, as if he’s trying to solve a particularly difficult puzzle. Harry’s determined not to fidget under his gaze. Finally Malfoy picks up his quill and turns to the file on his desk.
“Most of it,” he shrugs. “I use magic to hold things together while I hammer, or support things while I’m sawing. But the techniques are all by hand.”
“See, here,” she says, using her wand to freeze the footage. “This is where we took the upper hand.” She launches into a detailed explanation of the moves she and the twins had used, pausing and replaying the clip over and over. The Arrows stare in rapt attention.
“I felt like I let everyone down, when I quit the DMLE. Like I’d failed somehow.

“You played seeker for Gryffindor,” Draco goes on. “Picked in your first year even though it was against the rules,” he can’t resist adding.
Harry bristles a little at the idea that his key campaign platforms are to be characterised as just
Harry doesn’t talk much about the renovations at Grimmauld Place, but Draco knows he’s spending far less time wandering around annoying Jack with questions about beading, and far more time annoying Draco by just being underfoot, so it must be nearly complete.
The bottom half of the Christmas tree is absolutely laden with decorations, strangled with tinsel, and dripping with fake icicles. The top half is completely bare, and when Harry looks around he realises there may not be much left to decorate it with.
The woman hands Malfoy one of the envelopes and he pays her with Muggle money. He turns back to Harry as he opens it, drawing out the stack of pictures, starting to leaf through them quickly. His expression collapses.
“You’d like that, wouldn’t you,” he sneers, lifting his wand and turning as if about to take off running again.
“That decides it then,” Hermione says unhappily. It seems even she’s not emotionless enough to see this as a victory, though she’s gotten exactly what she wanted. “We can’t Portkey out and leave Ron trapped in the castle, and our only other way out is to finish what we’ve started.”
“So by the time Auror Granger finally answered, and confirmed that Specialist Malfoy was free to leave, I feel like all of us had really had an education, you know? I certainly heard suggestions about what’s going to happen to parts of your anatomy that really made my blood run cold, and I’m a qualified Healer.”
“I’m here to see a patient. You’re investigating a case.
Harry figures he could go to the hospital in the morning, because Belle’s awake and recovering, and the concept of visiting hours is stupid anyway, but there’s something that holds him back.
was able to get me some European plants that are very rare. And well, here we are.”
and heads to the till. Malfoy is long gone.
“I need to go home,” Maxwell says, in a very small voice. “I need to lie down for a long time.”
Hermione arrived an hour later.
Thanks for coming along for the ride. There's a tumblr post
“You weren’t at your flat. And I went to the Farm, but there was no one there. I looked everywhere. It’s a bloody big place, you know. Took me ages without magic.”
“You checked?!” Harry says, startled. Just the idea that Malfoy would entertain the possibility the happy couple in the photos was
“Quite. Now: show me around this dump.”
Casey has turned around now, and stands with his arms crossed, arching an unimpressed eyebrow at Harry.
“The goblins have been made an offer to merge the club with Puddlemere. It looks like they’re going to take it.”
“Is this why Theo didn’t want to come?” Hannah asks, her voice shaky.
As if on cue, Malfoy’s mother appears, a determined set to her expression.
“How else would you bloody—
venture into wizarding stores, for sweets and parchment and broom polish, no one batted an eye at wizards wearing Muggle clothes. No one stared at his scar, or whispered behind their hands, or pressed babies into his arms. He ate like it was going out of fashion. Thomas helped him buy proper running shoes and they took to jogging along the river each morning. By the time Christmas rolled around, Harry felt healthy and happy. Almost whole. He was looking forward to seeing everyone, delighted by the idea of a Weasley winter wedding.
But so what. Even if Draco has been running around befriending Arrows fans and players, it doesn’t change the fact that he cheated. That Harry thought he could trust him, when it turns out he couldn’t.
“Malfoy,” he says quietly, and realises he doesn’t know what to say next.
Something happened in the hours after the final battle, after the evacuation of the living and the dead. As the last of the survivors left the castle, and as the castle itself turned its wounded back on them all. The loss of Hogwarts has been felt by their entire community. And it’s something that needs to be put right.
Harry waves him away. “I don’t want your money,” he sighs.

Above them, the Hogwarts clock tower starts to chime.
“So, Harry, counting down the days now, I suppose?” Arthur asks. “I must say, it will be good to have some clear direction from the top.”
Iyer tucks and rolls and reaches and the whistle sounds. The replay screens light up, showing her clean catch.
“No, Harry. Be sensible. You’re suspended because you couldn’t follow protocol if your life depended on it, which it
His first instinct is to crumple the parchment, lob it into the bin, and forget about it. He doesn’t need any more money—he barely touches the Galleons he has now. And there’s no way he wants to present himself in person. Not because of some goblin administrative balls-up. His cat, Cassie, wanders out of the bedroom and winds her way through Harry’s legs, looking for attention. Harry scratches her head distractedly, turning the page over again.
Ron’s jaw is tight with frustration, and he’s still eyeing Malfoy as if he might bite, but eventually he gives a short nod of agreement. Hermione gets out the wrapped sandwiches, clearing a space among the parchment and lining them up. Harry picks up the egg and cress and hands it to Malfoy, who gives him a small pleased smile that Harry swears has probably caused his own face to flush several inexplicable shades.
Unfortunately, when they Apparate back to Grimmauld Place, they find the calendar doesn’t agree.
Zabini, at least, is more forthcoming, if only because he really likes the sound of his own voice. Even his black suit is ridiculous. At first glance, it seems sombre, but then Harry notices the fabric has a pattern of tiny shimmering dragons woven into it, dancing and flying across the thread.
Harry feels like the house is a little warmer when he wakes the next morning. He’s down to using two duvets instead of three, in any event. And when he checks in the sitting room, the fire lights on his first attempt and seems happy to stay lit. He opens the seventeenth door on the calendar, revealing a picture of a family wrapping presents together.
They gather around the book, reading what they can find about the spell, and then concentrate their efforts on planning for the party on Wednesday.
“Yell at me. I know you want to.
, Draco?! How could you be this reckless with your
“Now, though, I need you to cast.”
Harry gestures a little helplessly at his tie. “I can’t get the knot right.”
Malfoy looks uneasy. He keeps tugging at the cuffs of his suit jacket, as if it’s too small, or too tight, though, Harry notes, it’s definitely neither. Harry is hit by an unexpected urge to reach out and touch him. Brush invisible fluff off his shoulder. Elicit something, some sort of reaction. He shoves his hands in his pockets before he can do anything stupid.
“You could have said, mate.”
“Do I look like Antiques Roadshow to you?” Harry laughs. He thinks he might have hooked him now, though; he can tell by the interested tilt of Malfoy’s head. The same one he gets in the field when confronted with a particularly difficult problem to solve.
when he left Britain. Eighteen years old and the worst kind of gathering storm of messed-up kid and traumatised war vet. He held it together through the funerals. Through that long ugly summer at the Burrow as Molly wept, Ginny drifted away from him, and Ron and Hermione wrapped themselves up in each other. He stomached the cloying adulation every time he went out in public and the invasive stories about his life all over the press. He thought that if he just kept putting one foot in front of the other, it would be fine. He would start Auror training, move out of the house that had once felt like a sanctuary and now felt like a mausoleum, and get on with his life. He kept repeating it to himself like a mantra.
“Hermione can take him,” Harry says with a rush. “It will only—I only need a few minutes, I promise.”
“The results of the
The first winter after the war, Harry lived at the Burrow. It was only the following year when he started to try and make Grimmauld Place liveable that he began to realise the full extent of Kreacher’s rigid Advent rituals. He and Hermione would stumble in from training exhausted and aching to find Ron staring in open-mouthed bemusement as the grouchy old elf dragged miles of decaying festive bowers down out of the attic. They ate takeout stacked on boxes of Black family Christmas heirlooms, and ducked under a ridiculously oversized wreath he’d somehow managed to fix over the front door. But even in those early years, with everything covered in dust and grime and a layer of tragedy, by the time Christmas Eve rolled around and Kreacher’s house-elf magic worked its miracles, the house shone from every corner.
Harry keeps thinking about this as the Tempus charm sounds to let them know the biscuits should come out of the oven. He’s still thinking about it later that morning, as Teddy squeezes the piping bag too hard and red icing shoots all over both of them. Harry smears it all over this nose, calling him Rudolph and producing squeals and giggles. He’s definitely still thinking about it as he finishes cleaning up, and packs some of the biscuits into a tin to take to St Mungo’s.
“Oh, sorry,” Ron says, looking around the room and then at Harry and Hermione. “I was looking for … Zabini. For the bar.”
. Rose does an excellent job as the narrator, but Harry’s still struggling to grasp why Teddy—as the front half of a camel—is leading a troop of enchanted nutcracker tin soldiers across a desert in the second act.
“No, I. No, nothing new, sir.”

at it, and then brings it back to the bench. “See what the diagnostics show now.”
Harry refrains from muttering
“Exactly,” Ginny agrees triumphantly. “Come on, get dressed. I’ll stop you from embarrassing yourself on Christmas Day, you buy my lunch at Auberge. It’s win-win.”
“Any frozen pond?” she suggests, looking confused.
Luna’s voice drags him from an uneven sleep.
The room falls silent. Several of the men around the table shift uncomfortably in their seats. One of them pulls out a pair of spectacles and squints more closely at Parkinson’s screen. None of them seem to want to make eye contact with any of the others.

“Can you do it or not?” Potter blurts impatiently, still clearly lacking in any courtesy or manners.
Draco sighs, but decides to press on.
A small mercy.

Harry’s mouth falls open in disbelief. “You’re going to lecture
she was referring to,” Hermione laughs, her tone smug.
“What?” Granger’s on her feet in an instant as if she can do something, rounding the bed to grasp Potter’s hand. “What happened?”
“And mulled wine,” Malfoy adds.
“Dawlish? Dawlish took Malfoy’s things?” Harry asks.
“And as for you, Maxwell—”
Harry decides to give it one more shot before bed. He fetches his presents for Rose and Hugo and sits by the tree to wrap them. He uses rather more spellotape than is perhaps required, and the boxes come out a little lumpy and uneven, but at the end he has a pile of red and gold presents tied up neatly with bows.
And of course, Hermione frowns disapprovingly, which is gratifying, but Ron—Ron seems to have developed superpowers or something.
“That’s enough.”
The rest of the week is a bit of a shambles. Malfoy and Wood continue to butt heads over even the smallest things, leaving Harry caught between a rock and a hard place. While it pains Harry to admit it, about half the time Wood is being a bit unreasonable, but Harry will be damned if he’s going to side with Draco Malfoy against the captain he specifically hired and has played with since he was eleven. And that leaves Harry feuding with Malfoy over everything from what the players should wear for their training practices to whether it’s appropriate to punish tardiness with flying laps.
“Met your young man this morning.”
, but that’s not to say that there isn’t an awful lot of ancient magic surrounding this calendar.”
“So nothing is to be gained,” Hermione leaps in, deciding she’s found an ally in Malfoy. “Ron wants to stay. There’s no reason to overrule him on that. And no reason not to carry on. We were fine getting him up here to the hospital wing, weren’t we?”
,” she clarifies.
And so he finds himself nodding, grateful, and it does help, to just kick back on the couch and chat with them both, the kids at Molly’s for the evening. He suggests they watch a film, but Hermione complains that it’s a dull way to spend time together and argues for a wizarding parlour game. Harry’s pretty sure she mostly likes it because she always beats the pants off Ron and Harry.
“Nev, help me here,” she asks. “I’m going to lift him; I need you to sweep all the glass out from underneath.”
“We’re going to walk along and collect Rosie from nursery in a bit. Want to come?”
Harry laughs out loud. He tries to convince her to have a pint at the Broomsticks before they use the Floo, but she says she’s promised to take Luna out for dinner and leaves him to it.  Harry decides to have a drink anyway, settling at the bar and ordering a firewhisky.
Sensing something amiss, Harry turns slowly to realise that Malfoy is no longer with them.
“It’s an old pure-blood tradition,” Ginny explains to Hermione, rubbing at her eyes tiredly. “A sort of modified Patronus, I think. Anyway, it’s a magical illusion they’ll be hunting. Just an excuse to stomp around in the woods and show off their wandwork.”
His grandfather notices as soon as he gets back to Brooklyn.
unsolicited fire-calls.
He’s still half-convinced based on their track record that the bathroom will try to drown them, but if it does, at least they’ll be together.
Harry’s not the only one who is starting to feel like he has a new lease on life. The team’s recent victories start to energise everyone in the Arrows squad. Luna devises new workouts with Leila and has the team drinking smoothies that look like cat vomit and don’t taste a lot better as far as Harry’s concerned.
“The last six weeks for us—and for Ron and Hermione and others—have been altered in some way. We forgot my birthday party, for example.”
Harry looks at the invite curling into ash in the grate.
Ron lets out a roar of laughter so loud he startles Hugo, who immediately starts to cry. Ron’s still laughing, practically tearing up with it, as he picks up the little boy to settle him.
“Why, though?” Hannah asks again, and Harry’s pretty sure she’s thinking that if they wait six months she can
The Aurors pay them no attention, standing to the side as Granger approaches the door. She must have briefed them about his arrival.
He realises with a start that he must have said that bit out loud, judging from the confused looks his team are giving him.
Maybe Christmas hasn’t quite reached Kreacher, yet.
A few days later, Draco comes out of Gringotts and stops at the coffee cart for a latte. Two witches on the street opposite do a double-take when they see him, murmuring to each other as they hasten away. Years ago, he had to put up with this whenever he went out. Muttered hexes, rude names. And he’d borne it, head held high, because there will always be some part of him that feels it’s what he deserves, regardless of what his Mind Healer has to say on the subject. But gradually it became less and less frequent. The press coverage swung slowly from scathing to suspicious to grudgingly complimentary. So when the barista hands him his coffee and he turns to find someone else in the queue literally pointing him out to her friend, he’s pretty sure his day is about to take an unpleasant turn.
“Do you feel alright now?” Harry asks her.
Merlin, but Harry’s a fucking mess. Getting maudlin over a pair of socks.
“I’ve been thinking about that,” Hermione responds, tugging a notebook from her pocket. Harry wants to yell at her.
“No,” Draco insists immediately.
Blaise loses his internal struggle at that point, laughing so hard he almost falls off his chair. Even Pansy has managed to close her mouth and is eyeing Harry with a surprised and delighted smile.
Farm, reinvigorated and filled with ideas. Wanting to fix things. About the slightly off-kilter planter box by the front door. He bites at his lip.
something before now. That it was somehow his responsibility.
Harry thinks about coughing to announce his arrival, but there’s another loud thump as a pile of folded linen flies out of the box and hits the floorboards in front of him and he decides to escape without enduring any further lectures.
He leans to whisper something in Luna’s ear, and she pats his hand gently, a sad smile on her face. For the first time, Harry gets a glimpse of what this might all be about. Malfoy’s home life is clearly impossible. His childhood was probably as traumatic as Harry’s own. His wartime experience was obviously as bad, if not worse. And now, he has no family to speak of other than his mother. And now, strangely, it seems — Luna. Harry feels a faint ache in his chest, a twist on the feelings that have been bothering him all weekend. He can see Malfoy is suffering; and like it or not, he cares.
“We’re nearly through it, though,” she says, scribbling another quick line of notes in response to something she sees.
Draco waits for a better explanation, but Harry’s not sure he has one.
?” Harry explodes at her, unable to believe she’s seriously suggesting that they jettison their injured friend and keep going.
Harry says nothing.
“Obviously not, Potter,” snapped Robards.
Despite the hangover, despite the suit, despite the fact that
Harry wakes first. He lies quietly for a long time, Draco warm beside him. He tries to relax, chasing after sleep as it slips away from him. But his brain is racing and adrenaline is fizzing in his veins and eventually he gives up and slides carefully out from under the covers.
The first half is incredibly tightly paced. Puddlemere United are every inch the finely-tuned machine they were in the semi-final. Every player’s face is a mask of fierce concentration. Their hexes are sharp and precisely targeted, and the Chasers’ patterns are unbelievably quick and difficult to predict.
“At the Manor,” Harry agrees. “We need to get out of here.”
The Head of Magical Games and Sports, Orion Cribbe, gives the opening remarks. Harry sees Parkinson hovering over his right shoulder, dressed inconspicuously in a dark suit, and wonders how much of her hand is in all of this. Cribbe stutters through a carefully prepared speech about a new era of the ancient game, and receives only a smattering of applause, but then the room goes dark and a video screen descends behind him. The soundtrack is deafening—MIA’s
When he arrives at the bar, everyone is in high spirits. Draco asks Mei, a soft-spoken Ravenclaw who sometimes plays guitar, to be the emcee for the evening. He likes to share that role around, so that the evening is entirely about the young people and not about him. He doesn’t do anything now, really, except pay for their soft drinks and adjudicate the occasional dispute about who gets to perform when.
and the way people perceive taste and flavour.
Harry waits a moment, both to let his disappointment settle and to take another look at his beautifully decorated house. Everything about it is magnificent. Malfoy’s magic, the delicate arrangement, how festive it all looks.
Beside him Draco is cheering triumphantly, waving his Omnioculars back and forth at the team. He grabs his jacket and notepad and doesn’t even wait for Harry, presumably expecting him to follow him straight down to the changing rooms.
“Perhaps you’re right, Harry,” she sighs, transfiguring it into a neon orange one-piece that makes her look like a cartoon fish.
” Luna cries, her voice ringing out clearly in the damp chamber. Suddenly, all around them, tiny coloured Christmas tree lights blink into existence, dancing along the edges of the rock in bright reds and greens.
His suit is a tan checked tweed and it makes him look like an aristocratic country gentleman, which, Harry supposes, is exactly what he is. Or what he
“Pansy was in my room the night Lucius was murdered.”
Teddy loops back around, screeching to a stop a few feet away. “Did you see how much faster I was that time?” His cheeks are bright and his hair is now a shiny black.
Harry pulls out a gold envelope. It has the fussy, formal air of some pure-blood charity nonsense. When Harry left the Aurors, the invitations to cut ribbons and make speeches mostly dried up. It was one thing to have the Saviour of the Wizarding World turn up to your posh event in his dress uniform with his Order of Merlin pinned to his chest, and quite another to have Harry Potter, Private Investigator with a dingy office in the worst part of town, mumbling through a speech. Plenty of people feel comfortable asking for his Galleons, though.
“He cast
“Why would you do that?”
At Friday dinner, Ginny has managed to get away from practice in time to join them, which only happens infrequently. She gives Harry a warm hug and congratulates him on the Arrows’ recent results.
“She knows about me, and she knows about you, and she still wants to marry me because she’s better than both of us.”
Malfoy may not read the
Harry’s secretly delighted they’d come up with the same reference, but also a little gobsmacked. “You

“You’ll need to be more specific,” he sneered, pointing at a nearby stack of journals. “I’m very prolific.”
Harry thinks about Parkinson’s sleek, confident demeanor. He tries to picture her out of her depth and unable to support herself and can’t. It’s simply too hard to imagine.
Harry shakes his head. “It must have been a one-off.” Neither of them are entirely happy with that explanation, or rather the lack of one, but Harry promises that if there’s any further security breaches he’ll get an Auror team to reset everything top to bottom.
“Did you give them money?” Ron asks, but Harry’s already shaking his head. He’s never been particularly political about his sexuality, and he’s certainly never given any thought to Muggle charities.
“No, it is. It looks like Dumbledore sent along anything that might have had personal value to you. There’s some photo albums, a box of old letters. Some of your toys, looks like.” He gives Harry a small, sad smile, before consulting the list on the parchment in front of him again. “A jewellery box of your mother’s. A portrait, but the frame is empty. I expect the occupant would prefer not to spend any time they don’t have to in an abandoned vault.”
“So when he joined you last night, how did he seem? Agitated? Upset? Anything unusual about his demeanor?”

Because it’s his.
Bulstrode takes her wand out and holds it in Cassie’s general direction, but far enough away that the Auror has to stand up to cast the spell — a deliberately petty gesture. Cassie is clearly unfazed, watching the results of the incantation record themselves neatly on the enchanted parchment she has set up in front of her.
Hermione grabs him in an impulsive hug and kisses him on the cheek. “This is brilliant.”
Draco shakes his head. “I’m serious, Harry. My father is dead. My mother is still claiming that she murdered him. And meantime, there’s the
“It has your name on it, Harry. But it’s … this is a parking ticket for a car?”
Draco pauses to draw breath. Harry finds he can’t say anything at all. His throat is tight and the anger and frustration and betrayal is raging in his veins. He clenches and unclenches his fists.
Hermione decides that they need to take full advantage of it before it disappears again, and so she sits on a colourful quilt under a tree in their back garden with Hugo beside her, kicking his fat little legs in the air and making gurgling noises. Harry asked for a chore to help with and is now wanding clean laundry out of endless baskets to dance and flap on the line in the light breeze.
The Emergency Ward is busy—crowded with the first patients of the day who’ve woken up to find that whatever they’re suffering from didn’t get better overnight, or the drunken injury they thought was just a scratch is considerably worse than first thought. Harry ducks around a man reeking of Firewhisky who seems to have had both hands hexed to grope his own arse. “Can’t even scratch me

“I don’t want you to think… That is, I’m not trying to…” Harry blurts out in a hurried rush, tripping over his words. “The

“Master Draco,” the elf says, bowing low. His pillowcase is bright blue and he has a wide smile on his face. “Harry Potter is being in the kitchen.”
Harry scratches at the back of his neck. He doesn’t want to think about it as “helping” Draco. He’s doing a job. Solving a mystery. That’s all. That’s what he does.
Harry takes a step back to appreciate it more fully, and with a sinking feeling of dread he hears a sort of snap, and a fizzle, and a groan from the crowd. The line of trees behind Harry have all had their lights go out. He spins around guiltily, but he’s a good couple of feet from the nearest branch. It can’t have been him.

“Still working on that bit,” Ron admits, as the fire lets off a whoosh of sparks. “Just saw the Knut-boxes full of this trash and sort of… grabbed them and Apparated home before I really thought about it.”
“That’s my cue,” Harry says with a smile, a gentle hand on Hermione’s arm as she starts to protest. “We can talk more later, I promise.”
Harry flushes, but waves the question away. They talk about work, and the gossip from the DMLE Christmas party the night before. Hermione fills him in on the loose ends from the Marsden case.
But it’s enough to break whatever has held Draco glued to the pavement. He shoves his hands in his robes, his fingers curling around his wand. Takes one last look at this awful, entitled, destructive,
“Frustrated, maybe,” Draco replies, and gives him a smug little smile. “I feel like we probably had a pretty good time.”
The admission seems hard won. Malfoy looks grief-stricken. He reaches out idly to pluck at a decoration on Harry’s tree: a sparkling heart in a deep, ruby red.
. Maybe it’s time we shared those feelings with your former colleagues from the DMLE.”

When he turns slowly around, he sees the impossible. Stepping out of a shadowy corner is Bellatrix Lestrange.
Neville gives Harry a strange look, but agrees quickly, and the pair of them spend a long hour opening all of the players lockers and checking all of the equipment. Neville teaches Harry the diagnostic spells, and they cast them over and over until even Harry’s wand hand is tired.
It’s all Draco can do not to scoff out loud at this oversimplification, but fortunately Andromeda more or less does it for him, laughing gently as she says, “There was a little more to it than that, but yes.”

“What are those?”
The Healers’ station at St Mungo’s is unattended. A small sign says
“I did!” Zabini crows, appearing delighted with himself. “I would have invited you, of course, but you lot all scuttled off after Daddy Malfoy disgraced himself. Pans and I decided to crack through another bottle of the ‘39 Burgundy.” He leans forward and stage whispers, “It’s what the old man would have wanted.”
He watches Hermione tremble, her wand arm shaking by her side. Harry racks his brain trying to think.
Harry shrugs, feeling his cheeks heat.  “She doesn’t have anyone else.”
Malfoy arches an eyebrow. “Yes, but you’re meant to eat them.”
Draco gives a startled nod. “I...yes. Of course.”
“This is impressive,” he manages, taking a deep breath and reaching for a change of subject, gesturing around at the pub night. “Creating an environment like this.”
“Why do you want to see her?”
Harry’s not sure what that’s got to do with anything. He’s tried and tried to get Neville to understand he doesn’t have to stay out of a sense of loyalty to Harry, and he—
“Wouldn’t have it any other way, Pans,” he agrees, kissing her on the cheek.
It happens before he can really process it. Potter’s face turns thunderous and he produces a wand he absolutely didn’t have a second ago.
On Sunday the hospital is inexplicably quiet. It’s not ordinarily quiet on the weekends, Harry’s been here often enough to know. There’s usually a press of amateur Quidditch injuries, home improvement accidents, and people for whom Saturday night took a turn. But this afternoon there’s an unexpected lull. Peaceful enough he can hear the repeating chime of heartbeat monitoring charms, a baby crying somewhere in the maternity ward.
Harry slaps his glass down a little too vigorously, annoyed that she isn’t taking him seriously. His beer slops over the rim.
“Oh yes, quite a tragedy.”
“Oh he’s imagining that sort of life all right — but not with a wife. Harry’s current idyll involves weekends at the beach with Teddy, and framed photos of him and another wizard on the wall. The life he feels he
“The Aurors have it,” Harry sighs.
It shouldn’t matter.
Harry feels a bit guilty. “Yes, there’s something wrong,” he concedes. “But I’m fixing it. Or Malfoy is….Or will be.”
Harry thinks he might be about to suffer the same fate, but the carol changes and Luna wanders off singing loudly.
Hannah gets to her feet.
“Look with your eyes instead of your whole stupid body,” Malfoy seethes, pointing back at the door. He takes an abrupt step backwards, releasing Harry, who very much wants to rub at the tender spot on his breastbone, but doesn’t.
can,” Hermione says quietly. “I’m not sure
“You can do this.
Malfoy takes a half-step back as Harry barrels uninvited into his personal space. Harry bites his tongue to stop himself from pointing out Malfoy hadn’t exactly objected the last few times they’d been together. It doesn’t help to think about that, though. Harry shakes his head and tries to focus.
“New owners,” he says with a broad grin. “Got to spruce the place up a bit.”
It’s this that manages to startle an almost laugh out of Malfoy, who glances between the two of them in astonishment. Gibbens’ mouth has fallen open, and Harry thinks that will probably put him out of commission for a while.
“It was depressing,” he shrugs. “The whole office is. You should decorate.”
“So this is a surprise, isn’t it?” Bill says, as he unwraps the string around Harry’s file and spreads some of the papers out across the desk. “There was so much confusion when these vaults were uncovered. You can imagine how annoyed the Powers That Be here were to discover that their records were incomplete. They think that whole section was blocked off when the Muggles started on their Jubilee Line extension.”
“And you, it seems, are no exception.”
“Yes. Everything’s exactly as we expected. The founders made sure the castle’s magic was established with strong protections woven throughout it. Over centuries that magic grew and evolved. It’s a big part of why Hogwarts was always considered such a safe space.”
But Harry has quite a significantly more serious question, given the circumstances under which
Draco finds himself bristling for an entirely different reason. He wouldn't blame Potter for never setting foot in Diagon Alley ever again given the way the
“Meningitis when I was a baby in Morocco,” she says to Harry, her smile open. “Nothing magic could do about it even once I found out I was a witch. Can you imagine what they thought of me first year at Beauxbatons?”
Harry thinks he might cry, if only he had the energy.
. The bindings flap back against the floor and as the pages fan, flying from within them come knives, swords, arrows — an absolute
Harry straightens up in his seat. “There’s something cursed in there? I thought it was just… my parents’ stuff?” His mind races at the possibilities. Awful things Voldemort could have done in their final moments. Dark Magic he could have left behind.
“In the sense that it didn’t require the same unequal match as prior generations, yes. But in all other respects, the magic is the same. It gives both Ron and Hermione the same access to their affinal magic and allows them to create a wizarding house together.”
Except.
“Give it,” she says finally, with a tired groan, reaching for the file.
“Bloody hell,” Hannah shivers as they huddle together for a third time. With Malfoy carrying half the weight of the shield it’s much easier. Harry feels the gentle press of his magic at the places where their spells knit and overlap. He finds himself focussing on that, rather than on the noise and devastation around him. When the ghosts flee again, he feels a reluctant tug as they end the incantations.
It’s only when they get to the upper levels that Harry realises his mistake.
“Look,” Hermione tries to reason with them again, “it’s terrible what’s happened to Neville, and he should get the care he needs right away. But there’s no reason for the rest of us to stop now when we’re
In all the years Harry sat under it for meals, exams, and assemblies, the enchanted ceiling has never made a noise, and yet Harry swears he now hears a roll of thunder. He figures it must be coming from outside. The air feels ionised, like the conjured weather above them might actually be real. Like rain could strike his face at any moment.
Harry feels an odd pang of discomfort: it’s not as if he expects to
Right on the top shelf of Neville’s cupboard are three very small boxes, and stencilled on the front of each is a symbol of a serpent wrapped around a cup, its forked tongue licking out. Harry staggers back a step, pointing up at them.
“You what?” Harry splutters. “Really?”
a birthday party. He’s never made much of a fuss around his birthday, and this year he just...well, he...he’s pretty sure it was just another day. “I didn’t—”
“If they’ve broken the curse then I’d like to … uh … examine the scene.”
He feels like he needs to keep up his momentum, and he doesn’t have any wrapping paper, so he quickly scans the other doors for something he can do. The picture of the couple building the snowman seems straightforward enough, something he can surely manage before work.
When he finally finishes his notes, he’s exhausted from maintaining his protective magic and both of his coffees have gone cold, undrunk, in spite of the charmed cup. His arms ache and he carefully seals an enchantment around the rings so he can safely lower the remaining wards.
more accurate than that.”
“Where would the car be now? If you owned a car, Potter. Where would you park it?”
Belle follows his line of sight. “You read to me!”
.  It’s such a lazy fix that it causes irritation to well up in Harry. He waves his wand at the wall, causing the sticker to vanish and the letters underneath to change into Malfoy’s name.  He wonders why Malfoy hadn’t done the same.
Harry’s relieved to hear her say it. The idea that she’d become a completely unrecognisable person was too hard for him to comprehend.
“You’re right, you know, your rug isn’t as good as mine.”
“Merlin, all right”, she rolls her eyes, “I’ll transfigure a perfectly good bra and pants into a bikini if it makes you feel like there’s a difference”.
There doesn’t seem any better explanation for finally receiving an affirmative RSVP on the thirteenth invitation he’s sent to Potter’s residence. But if it is a prank, Blaise has really mastered Potter’s unreadable scrawl.
Draco breaks eye contact with Harry, fiddling with the coaster under his pint glass and at a loss for words.
Harry hums in thought.
, Harry thinks. Not horses. A wizarding farm, maybe. It’s peaceful. Pastoral. Oddly incongruous with the noise and bustle in the hospital’s corridors and the chaotic press of shopping Muggles out on the street.
“Which is the true part?”
Harry picks up a slim leather wallet and inside finds the driving licence he’d seen photocopied on the mailbox form, his own face staring up at him. The rest of the items are uninteresting: Muggle bank notes, a receipt from a bookshop.
“I’ve found things at home that I don’t recognise. Items of clothing, Muggle things. And then we discovered this letter, which led us to a Muggle postbox service near my house.”
“But, I’m an Auror, and there are certain
When he’s farewelled Wood he heads out to the pitch to find Leila flying some complicated laps. He summons his broom and soars up to join her.
“That seems a bit daft, mate,” Harry calls. “Get down.”
. “God I’ve wanted to do this for
“I fled with my family after the war,” Malfoy eventually says, still not looking at Harry. “Because I was a teenager and I had no other choice. Because, on some level, I’ll always be beholden to the truly terrible decisions my father made when I was too young to know better, and this was no exception. It took the Aurors six months to find him in Vienna. And he wasn’t going to Azkaban, so there was only ever one way that was going to end.”
No, in fact, all of it must be bullshit. Iyer has never said to Harry that she’s ever had any trouble with the playbooks, and if Cranswick’s son was an Arrow, he’d have told Harry that by now, Harry talks to him all the time.
“There were challenges,” Harry explains. “Trials and tribulations before an audience. It was very much like a Triwizard Tournament.”
Harry bursts out laughing.
After breakfast, the preparations for the hunt take on a jovial sort of air. Elves appear with laden picnic baskets and screw the lids onto steaming thermoses of coffee. Harry watches Zabini fill up a silver hip flask from the bar, tucking it into the chest pocket of his robes with a theatrical wink.
Ron gives him a concerned glance at this revelation, but holds his tongue.
Finally, as protected as he can be, Draco starts with his suite of diagnostic charms. He sets his wand to one side, flexing his fingers. Affinal magic is visceral. It’s easier to understand when he can
Draco dismounts, and lets Teddy run to grab his own broom.
“Can you believe it, mate?” Ron says to Harry, looking in awe at the belching red steam train idling at the platform. “Seems like bloody yesterday.”
“I’ve a good mind,” Wood carries on, yanking the neck of his flying jacket open and tugging off his gloves. “To just go to the League as Captain and say that we’re forfeiting the rest of the season.”
come with me, stand there with us all, and smile,” Harry says, reaching down to take Draco’s hand. “It will be terrible and we’ll both hate it. But this is how it changes.”
Instead he finds himself shaking his head slowly, and sinking to the cold pavement beside Potter, his back against the lamppost.
Harry’s done a masterful job of keeping the Malfoy he shags occasionally entirely separate in his head from the Malfoy who was raised at the Manor to oppose everything Harry stands for. And Harry maintains that very careful separation by not considering it at all: like a blackness in a dream you fear looking at in case it swallows you whole. But he can feel it there sometimes, even when he’s with Malfoy. The past looming over them. And he wonders a bit whether the sex is part of studiously not examining it, of imagining none of it left scars.
They stand quietly for a moment, side-by-side, watching Teddy and Rose start up a game of tag around the Quidditch hoops.
“Show me where he’s buried, Harry?”
“I mean bloody
lying, and not your
“I didn’t want you to find out this way,” she starts, her voice small.
Harry is dressed up — a beautifully tailored jacket and no tie, his shirt open at the collar and his hair tamed. It makes Draco’s mouth dry. He glances down at himself and is not surprised to find he’s wearing a suit. But he’s absolutely dumbfounded to see he’s wearing a suit that he
“You remember my cousin Draco, Harry,” Luna chides gently, patting his hand like a senile patient destined for the Janus Thickey Ward. “We all went to school together.”
Instead, he explains quickly where the two of them have gotten to, showing Hermione the timeline they’ve worked on and handing the packet of photos to Ron. Ron lets out a startled laugh as he looks at them.
There’s something unnerving about how still she is, lying there. Worse, somehow, than watching someone who is sleeping. She looks unbearably frail. Harry keeps thinking about how vibrant she’d seemed in that split-second as he stepped into the room. Her head tipped back in laughter at something Marsden had said. Her eyes bright and alive in that instant before everything fell apart. Had she known what Marsden was doing? And if not, what had she thought was in all the boxes in their basement? It replays in a loop: her laugh, head tipped back, the popping sound of the tripwire, the flash. Harry shakes his head to clear it, and tries to concentrate on the words swimming on the page in front of him.
Harry is grateful for the excuse to get out of the room and away from Malfoy for a second. Sitting so close to him is clouding up his last functioning brain-cells. He goes upstairs and finds the matching t-shirt, the parking ticket, and the leather gloves. He heads back down to the kitchen and retrieves the phone charger, and scoops up the trainers from by the front door. When he gets back to the front room, he finds Ron and Hermione are alone, muttering to each other on the couch.
“That was a while ago. I spent some time coaching kids’ Quodpot. I’m working with an educational programme now for… Muggle-born kids. Getting them ready for school at much younger ages.”
“No alcohol at all last night. The chef insisted.”
As he gathers his things to leave, he compliments Maisie on the log.
Hermione, however, seems nonplussed. “We’ll swim in. Neville has gillyweed.”
“Yes. No,
. Everything would pass to the firstborn son.”
“Well, it suits you, doesn’t it? Not here to offer condolences or sympathy to Draco or his mother. Just the Golden Trio racing around trying to save the day. Casting suspicion left, right and centre. No room for Draco to live a normal life. You disgust me, the lot of you.”
Dinner is a boisterous affair. Arthur has the whole table in stitches with a story about the toilet entrance to the Ministry malfunctioning the day before, flushing employees to random wizard’s homes like some sort of possessed Floo network.
Once inside the playing area—to call it a stadium seems like something of an overstatement—the noise becomes absolutely deafening. The stands are packed with fans jammed in shoulder-to-shoulder, their collective breath fogging the chilly night air. Enormous spotlights illuminate the pitch, and Harry can smell grilled meat and mulled wine from vendors plying their trade up and down the tiered steps. Malfoy leads them up and up, winding around in spirals and eventually out onto an exposed area of seating where there’s space for the team to squeeze in, pressed together on benches that seem to be made of nothing more than planks and concrete blocks.
“No, no,
Harry’s heart sinks. He looks around the room, at his overflowing desk and the rattling steam pipes.
Draco laughs. “You’ll have to be careful with it around your Muggle friends. It’s the charmed version, so next year you’ll be able to use a wand with it instead of the—” he waves his hand helplessly, forgetting the word.
. A strange flood of emotions passes through Harry. He can’t decide if seeing Ron’s older brother is great news or the worst possible outcome.
No one seems to know what to say, least of all Harry. Of course Malfoy had always been smart, so it makes a certain kind of sense that he’d be able to do this sort of thing. But it leaves Harry with more questions than answers. Why was he in France? Why didn’t he and Narcissa come home when they could? Why is he back now?
“I cut you open,” Harry says flatly, staring at the ash in the grate of the unlit fireplace. “How do I offer recompense for that?”
He looks up at her, silhouetted in the warm light of the Burrow, her hair a radiant halo around her head. His life would have been much simpler if she had been what he’d wanted. She gives him a knowing smile.
“I keep thinking about the raid. There’s something I’ve missed, and I can’t put my finger on it. I wanted to look at it in a Pensieve.”
He turns back to the group, all of whom are staring at him in surprise.
broom was still in the changing rooms, or lodged in the maintenance rack. “We’ll check them all.”
The staircases move into place again, and the little group makes its way down to the Great Hall.
“Awful,” she murmurs.
The situation is more and more familiar: the glint of fury in Malfoy’s eye, Harry himself, poised somewhere between irritation and desire. They each know exactly which buttons to press, how to shrink the whole world down to nothing but the sound of their own, quickened breathing.
profile written about Harry since the War.
“Will one be enough? The tree’s pretty big.”
“I’d have thought you knew some snow-sculpting spell,” Harry jokes, as they head into the overgrown back garden. Harry’s sort of glad it’s covered in a blanket of fresh snow, so that the true extent of his lack of maintenance isn’t obvious. He expects a bit of a lecture about the elemental properties of liquids and solids and how snow doesn’t respond to certain kinds of formative magic or something. But instead Malfoy just shrugs.
over before a vicious looking queen can haul herself out of the binding, casting to send it flying back against a wall.
Nott rolls his eyes and follows them both.
“I’m coming with you.”
And yet Harry can’t escape the sense that there's more to this than he understands — depths to Draco's situation he hasn't seen. Or perhaps has deliberately looked away from.
Most of the ceremonial things Harry’s asked to do bore him to tears: giving speeches, cutting ribbons. He usually only agrees if there’s a substantial donation made to charity. But Hogwarts is different. He’ll always say yes to anything Minerva asks of him, but particularly this, the chance to open the Cedric Diggory Memorial Wing: a long, low stone building filled with bright, airy classrooms, and an enormous new gymnasium charmed to be several stories higher inside than out. Harry’s seen the plans and progress photos, but nothing could prepare him for the sight of Hogwarts students on brooms indoors. The Gryffindor Quidditch players are swooping overhead in neat formation above the gathered crowd of students and dignitaries sitting in neat rows.
“Were you very shocked?” Harry asks, his voice small. He’s not even really sure which of them he’s addressing the question to.
“If you’d kept your mouth shut, Ron would be in a real hospital by now.”
The afternoon the Hogwarts letters had arrived, he’d left the Burrow with the excuse that he was overdue to visit Teddy. Which wasn’t untrue, exactly, but what he really needed was a chance to breathe. To get a lungful of air in his chest for the first time since May. Maybe even since before then.
When Draco returns to the Farm at lunchtime, Potter is nowhere to be seen, but Jack’s there running bits of timber through a bandsaw and giving Draco an incredibly smug look.
“And at first it seemed like you were exactly the same annoying little fuck you were in school. You pressed every one of my buttons. You knew exactly how to get under my skin. Everything you did drove me absolutely bloody mental. But then, after we went to Prague, I started to realise that you probably weren’t some special punishment Pansy Parkinson had cooked up just to drive me insane. You were patient and clever and wildly talented.”
“There’s nothing else you’re keeping from me?” Ron asks, and Harry senses the pointed nature of the question. Ron isn’t asking if Harry’s keeping information from the Aurors. This is much more personal.
“It’s okay,” he reassures his neighbour. “She was a stray. Always had a pretty big independent streak.”
“I was in a hurry. There was a
“He was at the Hogwarts library last week, getting a book. So, yes?” Neville looks puzzled by the question. “Draco is my friend,” he explains to Elsa. “And Harry’s—“ he trails off and waves his beer bottle around vaguely.
Malfoy kicks off his boots, sprawling out on a long blue sofa. In the flickering light from their torches, his expression is thoughtful. He’s grown into his ridiculous aristocratic features. The mean edges of him have softened somehow. Harry keeps thinking about his pale chest damp with bathwater, and the unrelenting irreconcilable urge he has to punch him in the face and kiss him at exactly the same time.
The Appleby stadium is surrounded by Muggle-repelling wards, so each morning he Apparates just to the south of the High Street and watches Muggles sitting glumly at the bus stop, ignoring one another on their way to work. Of course, all
“Ooh, who’s
“Look, Harry. Even she can see how wrong she was now.” She gestures over at the sofa, where Hermione is listening to Draco, bright-eyed and attentive, nodding enthusiastically at whatever he’s saying and pointing at something in Rowena’s diary. “Luna’s right, it’s going to work. Those two can do anything they put their minds to.”
a second chance. It’s really something, Harry.”
“You mean the most likely to want us dead,” Draco snorts.
Harry feels instantly awkward, like he’s been caught staring inappropriately. “I mean, she’s very talented. It’s not that I think she’s—”
“But it turns out…the thing is…”
“I can go without you,” Draco clarifies. “I just wouldn’t want you to think that I wasn’t doing everything I can to complete the job as quickly as possible. You know, that I was
the same as this one?”
Harry sits at the weight machine trying the new exercises Luna’s given him for his leg. They hurt, but he leans into the pain, waving his wand to increase the amount of weight every second set. It doesn’t take long before he’s beyond fatigued, sweat running down his back and his hip throbbing. He stares at himself in the mirror, face flushed with exertion and his black hair matted to his head. He grabs a clean towel from the pile by the door and heads to the showers. Usually he’d go straight home, but the team’s long gone and he feels clammy and disgusting and just wants to get under some hot water as soon as possible.
Harry grimaces. He’d truly just forgotten to let Malfoy know. Malfoy peers in at the little doors of the calendar.
“It’s possible I need you to help me vanish a bell-tower without destroying the structural integrity of my roof.”
“You’re the least of what happened to me,” he says, with a sad smile.
“And I need another coach who can teach the team how to win under the new rules. That’s obviously not you.”
Potter frowns, working his lower lip between his teeth.
“Hermione, come on!” Harry calls again, moving to grab her and that finding he can’t take a step. He tries again, but it’s like he’s glued to the floor. He glances around at the others and finds them all struggling as well.
house with the dead body of Lucius Malfoy, and possibly a killer, and you’re off chatting in the kitchens?”
“We always said the best endorsement we could hope for would be other people implementing our work. You’re being handed an absolutely golden opportunity on a plate, with a beautiful location and funding and government support. Think of all the No-Maj-born kids you’ll be able to help.”
Hermione isn’t remotely discouraged by his lack of response. “Brunhilde says he’s very impressive.”
. Excuse me if I doubt that you’re the right man for the job.”
He experiences a strong fight-or-flight surge of adrenaline and briefly considers Apparating away immediately, but he pauses a second too long. Long enough for Harry to turn and catch him with those brilliant green eyes and the tentative beginnings of a smile.
Hermione’s mouth opens and closes again, at a loss for words. Harry can see her warring with herself internally, because he’s heard one too many of her own
The assembled group filters out into the halls, sticking their heads in the empty classrooms and admiring the work that’s been done. Rows of brand new tables and chairs line up in front of clean whiteboards and coloured walls as-yet undecorated with art.
“Go and talk to him, Draco. There’s no reason to make yourself crazy until you know how he feels.”
He sends a Patronus to Hermione immediately and then thinks about the fastest way to get off the Hogwarts grounds. In the end he forces the lock on the Quidditch equipment shed, which is closest, and grabs a crappy, half-broken broom. It’s too small for him by half but gets him to the school gates far faster than walking. He briefly considers trying to Apparate straight to the Ministry, but it’s too far in one hop and he can’t be bothered trying to think of the waypoints so he goes straight the Broomsticks and into the Floo.
He makes his way up to the coach’s bench, where Malfoy is already ensconced. It feels like an affront to Harry, to have even this little sanctuary invaded. It’s not that he hadn’t thought Malfoy would be at the game, but he’d somehow imagined he’d find a perch somewhere else in the stadium instead of encroaching on Harry’s space. On the contrary, Malfoy’s lounging back to rest on his elbows while they wait for the game to start, expression impassive behind his sunglasses in the bright autumn light, looking like he owns the place. He’s like one of those bored-looking models in Luna’s fashion magazines—the ones Harry pretends not to like looking at—indolently reclining in expensive clothes for some fragrance advertisement. Harry decides to focus all his attention on his Omnioculars and pretend Malfoy isn’t there at all.
Oh Harry! It’s so good of you to come today.”
Ron claps him on the shoulder abruptly. He realises Bill has taken over at the barbecue. “Thought it was time we taught those kids how to throw gnomes!”
Malfoy isn’t even listening, pivoting to a new target.
“Harry!” George greets him with a smile. “Just in time! We’ve been unpacking these all morning!” He tosses a box at Harry’s head and he’s forced to react quickly to catch it.
Hermione comes in with a tea tray and a plate of homemade biscuits, and it should be awkward but somehow it’s not. Luna chats happily about writing for the
Harry sighs, kicking off his boots and standing up to get changed for bed. But then Draco tugs at his hand, pulling him slightly off balance, and his other palm is warm on the back of Harry’s neck as he surges up and captures Harry’s mouth in a kiss.
Once they’re there, though, it feels so much harder than Harry could have ever imagined.
.” His eyebrows waggle theatrically over his rather underwhelming wordplay.
“So what will you do now?”
Harry makes a list of all the unlit doors on the calendar so far, including today’s door, which opens readily to reveal Christmas lights adorning the front of a house. That doesn’t seem like a very sensible place to start, given the current state of Grimmauld Place, but there are others he thinks he can tackle pretty easily.
But then Harry’s out on the street and the cobble-stones are a bit uneven and it
, Potter. It won’t matter how long you stand there gaping at me like a fish.”
Harry and Draco are so busy and concentrating so hard that they’re more or less asleep as soon as they crawl under the covers at night. Harry drifts off with Draco’s arm warm around his waist and the long, lean lines of him pressed up against his back. And he wakes to find him cursing under his breath watching yet more Omniocular video. He knows that they need to talk: about the Puddlemere offer, about everything that happens next. But honestly, finding a minute in any day is difficult enough—there’s no way to set aside the time they need for that. Everything feels on hold until the season is over, one way or another.
, but Malfoy doesn’t say anything at all.
The doors to the Staff Lounge are standing open, and from inside he can hear music and the unmistakable sound of Luna singing.
Being given instructions seems to help, and the creatures immediately bustle away to the kitchens.
Harry and the others lob the fruit into the centre of the room. One of Luna’s throws goes wild, but the rest hit the bench, and before they can even roll, the knives rearrange themselves in a tornado of activity, peeling and slicing. The flour pours out of the bag, and a bottle of oil uncaps by itself, and suddenly the whole air in the kitchen changes.
” and “
“It does,” Malfoy gives an annoyed huff in response, starting to draw a diagram on a blank page in his playbook, but Leila just laughs and bats it closed.
The first time Harry stays over, it’s mostly an accident. They tumbled into bed late and had the sort of slow, intense, sleepy sex that left them both waving lazy cleaning charms and passing out almost immediately. But Draco’s body-clock is well trained, and his eyes open at a few moments before six as usual. He swings his legs over the edge of the bed, testing the ache in his muscles. Harry stirs, flopping an arm out to grasp at Draco’s hip. “S’too early,” he mumbles into the pillow, and Draco thinks he must still be mostly asleep or he’d have one leg in his trousers on the way out the door already.
At lunch, he calls into Scribbulus to pick out some rolls of wrapping paper and pops by Luna’s store on his way back. The crowds in her shop haven’t eased at all, but she seems unfazed, kissing him on both cheeks and asking him to hold his hands out while she loops a sparkling grey wool around them. “The needles are running low,” she explains, pointing to an elaborate window display where charmed needles are knitting piles of soft-looking and elaborately-cabled cashmere scarves.
Malfoy has gone bright pink and is looking down at his lap, shaking his head.
,” Melissa-maybe-Melinda replies.
“Dawlish apparently emerged in the bathroom of an elderly witch in Yorkshire, just as she was about to get undressed and take a shower. She hit him with a Body-Bind, went downstairs to call the Aurors, and promptly forgot what she was doing and made a cup of tea.”
Harry’s not sure how the hell
“Firewhisky?”
Wood isn’t giving an inch. “You’re too childish to coach together, and so we get Malfoy here telling us to use magic and new manoeuvres at every opportunity. Then we turn up to practice with you and you prohibit magic and make us fly traditional drills.
Harry puts up a standard Auror shield in front of them as Neville gently pulls open the door. The noise is suddenly much louder and more discordant. The huge copper cauldrons hanging over the long-dead fires ring with the sound of giant stirring rods banging against their edges. Two giant sinks appear to be flinging dishes from one to the other, splashing scummy grey water over the edges and onto the floor. But the truly terrifying part — the part that has Harry double the strength behind his shield charms — is the wide central bench where over a hundred knives rhythmically chop at nothing.
And just like that, Harry is back — sitting in an armchair by a window in the now-empty Blue Room, gazing out over a long expanse of lawn grown dim and dark in the fading evening light.
Harry looks at him, waiting for the rest of the sentence, but Malfoy is just looking at him wide-eyed like he’s realised something incredible.
Harry looks at the ornately carved set of wooden Quidditch figures lined up on a windowsill and tries to imagine Draco as a child, before Hogwarts, playing here in the sun.
,” he manages after a minute.
“There’s a dinner tonight?” Harry asks, and immediately feels like an idiot, because that much is obvious from the boxes of produce being carted past them into the kitchen.
The lists are terrifyingly long and detailed. Hermione has cast Extension Charms on each of their packs, but even with every item shrunk and lightened, they’ll be carrying enough supplies to keep an entire army on the march. Hermione has not budged an inch on this.
Hermione retreats into one of the dorm rooms, saying she needs the quiet to check over her work, but Harry suspects she also needs to lick her wounds. It helps lift the awkwardness a little with her gone though, so he doesn’t mind.
Harry’s so tired he’s not sure he can distinguish that speech from any of the others he’s given but he’s glad it’s having the desired effect. It’s important work that he’s doing and he’s glad the Head Auror can see that.
. Harry waits behind them at the bar.
“Where there is no
When Harry turns back into the house it feels unaccountably brighter, as if the light is finally making it all the way down the corridor for the first time.
Archie bloody Allsop is quoted throughout. “
Belle is lying propped up against several pillows, her blonde hair limp and her skin so pale Harry feels like he’s able to see more of her veins than he should. Malfoy stands at her bedside casting, so Harry waits quietly at the door, taking a moment to appreciate Malfoy’s form-fitting navy suit and very smart scarlet tie. It seems completely implausible that he can keep dressing this way in a hospital of all places. Harry knows Healers. The only people who ruin more robes on the job than Harry himself are Healers.
“It’s not the house,” Harry said glumly. “It’s me.”

“Let me be clear about something,” he cuts her off. “I will not lift my wand today until I’m sure you’ve told us absolutely everything.”
“Our paths cross,” Parkinson drawls, one of her dark eyebrows arched, as if she finds everything about the three of them terribly amusing. Harry can’t believe he’s subjecting himself to this. He takes a big swig of his drink and hopes Parkinson hasn’t laced it with anything.
Luna is standing by the table eating grapes and looking about the room with interest.
Harry feels his face heat. “Yes.”
“Auror Potter’s had quite an end to the year, I hear,” Kingsley says.
There then unfolds what might be the weirdest ninety minutes of Harry’s life, as Ron slides up alongside Draco and starts peppering him with questions. He grills him about the rota of League-approved spells, how a player can stay balanced when they receive an assistance cast on their broom, what the advantage is of casting on the Bludgers, and how a Seeker decides when to look away from hunting the Snitch to hex the opposing team.
Luna just smiles serenely. “I promise you I’m in my right mind, Hermione. You’re welcome to cast any diagnostic spells you like. You don’t know Draco the way that I do, that’s all.”
Draco can’t be sure, but it seems like Potter might actually be impressed by that. He begins to devour his food as if someone has just told him it’s his final meal.

“Please, raise your glasses, and join me in toasting Draco and Luna. May you both enjoy every happiness.”
When he straightens up and sends her on her way, he finds Neville grinning at him.
He wants to object. To tell Ron that he’s got the wrong idea or to defend himself in some way. He hasn’t even
Andromeda insisted weeks ago that Teddy could choose five friends, and no more than five friends, for his birthday party.
Hermione shakes her head. “And even if there were, would you want to leave the team now?”
approached me,” he says quietly. “You’ve always been the one in control. I haven’t set the terms of anything at all.”
Draco laughs. “Sorry to pour cold water on a promising situation, but—“
all day. Harry’s not about to complain, however, or do anything at all that might jeopardise Malfoy’s assistance, so he just gathers his coat and scarf and dashes after him to the Floos.
She is still wearing a small frown and Ron glances at Harry, apparently looking for confirmation that this is unfolding as Harry expected. Harry gives what he hopes is a reassuring nod.
“Bet he’s still a pain in the arse, though. Right?” Ron asks with a grin.
The tattoos are goddamned attractive, but Harry still knows it’s there.
Hermione looks confused. “Is it Slytherin’s crest as well?”
He should go home, he thinks, panicked. Snatch the book out of Potter’s hands and disapparate. Or leave the fucking book, he can manage without it. Potter is noble enough to return it to the library. Probably.
Blaise helped himself to the last olive from the bowl between them, giving Draco a speculative look. “You want to exorbitantly charge the elite of wizarding society for dinner and have them surrender their wands to
Malfoy rubs at his forehead briefly with his thumb as if trying to work out where to start.
“I got up to Floo with Luna. She’s already appointed a funeral director and managed half the arrangements with him.”
“We’ve got a minute,” he says, ducking into the store and buying a tiny pin with a troll on it.
“They’ll get help anyway,” he points out. “Doesn’t mean I need to move to Scotland of all places. The school will open with or without me as Head Teacher.”
Draco feels tears start to prick at his eyeballs, and he wants Potter to shut up. This isn’t how this is supposed to go. Draco’s supposed to say sorry. Supposed to grovel. Be careful not to open old wounds. Make amends. Potter isn’t supposed to be the one flaying him open all over again.

. Granger had been the Junior Auror accompanying Robards.
“It’s not difficult. I can show you if you like,” Luna says serenely, putting her cup down on the floor and taking out the ancient little book. “You were right about the protective magic, of course. But you didn’t share with us the context. Rowena and Helga were very concerned about Salazar. They didn’t agree with his political rhetoric even then.”
He knows Harry’s back, of course. Skulking around Scotland. Sidling in to Grimmauld Place for dinner whenever he can studiously avoid seeing Draco. Just as itinerant and useless as ever, half living in an inn and spending his life on transatlantic Portkeys.
“I’m going to get dressed before my colleagues get here,” Ron announces, closing the door to the study and casting an official Ministry
“Fuck you, Malfoy,” he manages. “If you can’t keep a civil tongue, we’ll conduct separate practices from now on.”
outside the four walls of the house. Hermione looks exhausted and sweaty, blowing a stray strand of hair out of her face and scowling at a wooden chair.
Malfoy scowls at him. “I love Luna a great deal more than you know anything about.”

No one so much as breathes.

“We can rewrite our story as many ways as you like,” Harry says with a contented sigh, tucking his feet under Draco’s leg. “As long as we do it together.”
, Harry,” Rose is indignant. “These are for the orphanage. We are taking them tomorrow before we come to your house!”
He doesn’t tell Ron and Hermione that he’s going to go to Malfoy’s. He knows that he owes them a proper apology, and he doesn’t feel like he can do that until he understands. Not that he expects to. He
Ordinarily, a safe bet. But this week, Harry thinks, he’s not all that sure.
“Do we need it?” Harry asks, waving a hand over his shoulder to indicate Malfoy and wrinkling his nose at the smell.
Draco’s ribcage feels too small for his lungs. A week ago he’d have said that was the truth. But he’s lived a whole lifetime in these tiny shared moments of the dreams.
We won Hermione! This isn’t real.”
It’s the mention of the food that seems to break a dam within Neville. His whole face lights up.
And the only person at the Healer’s station is Malfoy.
Fuck. Malfoy was so bloody self-assured that Harry had been convinced it would be okay.
“What?!” Malfoy gasps, shocked. “What are you talking about? I just told you what happened. My mother wasn’t even
“Thank you,” he says instead, voice rough with sleep. “For yesterday. Or earlier. Whenever the fuck it was.”
“Ow.”
“Narcissa didn’t leave her room,” Ron says with a tired sigh. “The confession
“Done, signed, the Galleons transferred. That’s what I was just executing when you walked over.”
The first time Draco ever walked a dream it was more or less by accident. Despite his years of study, he’d never considered himself a likely candidate. He’d only gone into Mind Healing as a way of working on the damaged places inside himself, and never for a second thought he’d be strong enough to hold his own in someone else’s mind.
Going to work on Monday as if nothing is wrong is one of the harder things Harry has  had to do. He’s immediately swamped with calls and Owls from Angelina and Parvarti about campaign activities, but he begs off claiming he’s coming down with something.
“You’d really do that? Talk to the press?” Draco asks, finding it hard to hope that this is really happening. Harry
Hermione leans forward and lowers her voice. “Surely now is the right time to leave, Luna,” she urges. “As soon as you’ve spoken with Ron. I can help you pack your things.”
“If it’s nothing then—”
“Harry,” Draco cuts him off softly. “You don’t owe me any explanations.”
.” Ron seems proud to have recalled these facts.
“Not without rest,” warns Hannah. “We can’t cast
After one particularly colourful tirade, Draco chases the team to the other end of the pitch far too quickly for Harry to keep up, and so he decides to descend for a break and some water. He finds Leila sitting in the stands, training bag at her feet.
Draco isn’t sure what to make of him. He looks well-dressed, his suit fashionable but subtle, and he’s clearly put some sort of effort into taming his still-ridiculous hair. Draco’s willing to admit that his obsession with Potter in school was at least partially a crush, but even with that bias he can tell Potter’s looked better. He looks tired, like he’s recovering from an illness. And possibly nervous, though that seems unlikely. Draco has the market cornered on all the nerves in the country right now.
Hermione’s expression becomes more serious. “I’m not saying you shouldn’t investigate a perceived threat, Harry. But it’s a giant leap from ‘some things in my house have moved around’ to ‘Draco Malfoy is trying to scare me into quitting politics’. It could be anything! Merlin, it could be a poltergeist!”
The assembled group titter awkwardly, glancing at one another in confusion. Not Dawlish, of course, who is staring at Harry with a piercing expression.
“Is it going to work?”
And she laughs, really laughs, a belly laugh, and she’s right.
Resolved, he turns into a narrow lane and finds the door to the bar.
Harry relays his conversation with Hermione and Draco reacts as he expected. He’s in, he’ll help. If Narcisa’s not sure, Draco will reconcile her to it.
“See?” Malfoy says, as if it’s obvious and Harry is a simpleton. “You’re just not being precise enough. Magic has rules. A binding magical contract is nothing but a set of rules.”
Harry looks around the house as if truly seeing it for the first time. It really is amazing. Between the antique Black family decorations, the ones made and given to him by the children at the orphanage, his cheap Muggle acquisitions, the glasses from the pub and Rose’s popcorn garlands, the whole effect is magnificently, uniquely Harry. It feels like
Harry leaned and kissed him on the cheek. “Let’s keep our hands to only us, then. He smirked and pulled him into the darkness.
They pass by very similar looking houses, all with chimneys and heavy wood doors and window frames. There’re children running down the street and people enter and leave pretty stores. The distillery where Ron and Hermione went in to buy some famous whiskey for them and their friends after the movie is open and packed with tourists. The previous week Draco had intended to go with them but stopped when he saw Harry staring further down the street, where a tattoo parlor was visible. Draco took him by the hand, strode firmly to the front, went in and made an appointment for them both.
on the rest of the wall. Greyback is stumbling to his feet close to Rosier’s position. “
“This is something new.” Harry whispers on Draco’s lips.
Draco sneered at him. “Those beyond the forest aren’t welcome, not anymore.”
“Harry, please.”

Aileen nods as she looks the design. “You have time for the whole day, yes?” She asks but starts moving around. “They’re simple tattoos but it still will take time. Mr. Potter, you first. Would you take off your shirt and sit?” She claps the back of a tall chair in the front of the parlor. Harry gets up and takes off his shirt.
Thank you for reading :3
Harry opens his eyes. The skin of his forearms is tender and red, but Sirius and Remus’ names are delicately written in cursive. He braves himself and looks at his chest. His parents’ names on him make it easier to breath. They’re here with him and Harry feels tears fill his eyes after months of nothing. He smiles at Aileen. “Thank you, they feel right.” She nods like she understands.
“Thank you.” He whispers to the room and feels a little gentle shake from the floor.
by Wordsworth. Harry remembers the author’s name from primary school. He shifts on the armchair and opens the book.
“You’re scum on her rotten body, half-blood. And you’re no threat, child.”
“Shush, Harry.” Draco reaches for his hand and Harry flinches. “May I? Harry?”
“I’m not going back,” said Harry.
“Lovely.”
Draco lifts the corner of his lips with a small movement, and Harry feels an urge to touch them, but stops disgusted with himself. Draco doesn’t need that now. And he remembers with a shake and a ghostly feel of cold hands on his skin that he doesn’t deserve that, to touch.
Malfoy looks confused and then lifts his eyebrows. He seems like he wants to tease him but only nods. “We’ll start tomorrow though; I didn’t bring anything today.”
Harry looks at the pale turtle. The Magical Menagerie’s seller had shown them all the creatures they had on sale before they chose a black cat with grey eyes for Teddy’s eleventh birthday. Draco liked he was tiny; Harry liked his eyes.
Harry feels his smile fade, he can’t let them see his nightmares are coming back. He smiles again and hopes it reaches his eyes. Hopes his strength is enough to keep it there, enough to battle the tiredness that has been settling slowly and deeper in the last four months.
It was helpful (almost always) for him, Kreacher and his friends when they fixed and redecorated Grimmauld. He started almost at the same time they did at Hogwarts. Harry had carried through May and half of June in a numb daze, visiting Teddy or under the bright sky at funerals or chasing after Death Eaters. Once the rebuild at Hogwarts started, they had almost captured every Death Eater that escaped Azkaban, and McGonagall forbid everyone to work on weekends.
“I think he will find it lovely, Harry.” Says Luna. “You don’t have to do anything else, just tell him. That’s more than enough.”
Harry can’t think. He’s warm from the fire, Luna’s soft support and Ginny’s outspoken manners. His mind is cloudy too, because of the want he’s been trying to subdue, and the tiredness that leaves the battle against fear. “How bad could it be?”
Draco nudges him in the ribs. “Shut up, Harry.” His name on Draco’s lips quiets him down effectively. “Daffodils, new beginnings and all that. It seemed appropriate.” Harry kisses Draco’s button nose and he wrinkles it. Harry hides his face in Draco’s neck and Draco hugs him, “Are you happy?”
The eight-year students have a little fun and relaxation in their Common Room.
“I’m not doing anything.”
He felt he had been looking at his reflection for years. For minutes. For seconds. Time was not a concept anymore; exist could do that. Exist felt short, fast, lazy, long.
Then he heard a whisper.
The light in Draco’s eyes dims, and Harry hates the seller, the owner and himself.
“Don’t worry, little Potter. Lestrange will only kill his sister in law, the disgusting blood traitor bitch. The little wolf is my dessert, so perhaps you’ll see him a last time.”
Harry looks up, “Drag me out; I’m kidnapped. I won’t leave by myself, love.”
“No, no, no, no. Not you.” Harry whimpers and lets go of Draco.
“But it’s the shop’s pet.” Says Harry.
Our boys go caving.
“You take care of yourself too, Harry.” She looks older when they break apart.
“Wordsworth and daffodils.” Harry says enchanted with Draco’s baritone, soft and crisp voice. “Reciting poems to me, that’s new too.” Harry snickers, “You’re so sappy.”
They both nod, and she looks at them expectantly. Harry clears his throat as he glances at Draco and sees him still flushed from their talk, “I want four names, two on my chest and two on my forearms.”
Harry looks at his arms and he’s indeed bleeding. Lightening cracks the sky and Harry moans. “I… I’m sorry.”
“Stop, Harry. I love you and I know you. All of your loved ones know you and they’re with you.” Draco gets closer. “Let me, Harry. I want to touch you, to feel you, to comfort you too. Let me.”
Malfoy turns to the wall and swallows. Harry sees him rub his thumb and forefinger.
He feels lightheaded and wants to get away from their friends’ presence, or he’ll ruin their joy. Once he and Draco have assured Seamus they will go buy the Dufftown whiskey everyone has grown fond of, he gets up and smiles to all his friends.
“The day before yesterday, in his visit to the Ministry with his father, he stopped by the aurors office and asked me what a television is. He said he had to settle with me, because Mione wasn’t there.”
Draco has trouble with his past and who he is. Harry is there to show him what he sees.
“It’s been five months.” Dean says.
“You would fancy being light up.” Said Harry.
Harry gets in his unmade bed and closes his eyes. He doesn’t think he can sleep.
The breeze blows through Harry’s hair, the sky is clear above. Hogwarts stands broken but proud in front of the black gathering of people. Grass sways peaceful and the green tall trees cast shadows over them, sheltering them from the heat. It smells like joy and life, and Harry’s throat constricts as the funeral ends and his gaze falls on the growing number of tombs in the memorial field next to the castle.
Harry wonders if Draco longs for spring and summer as he longs for rain and cold. If he perhaps wants to forget fire, ashes and cold big houses in a gentler breeze and spaces that Harry can’t stand right now. The easy passing of time suffocating him again.
“What did you do?” Ginny asks.
for one dialogue and it helped me build the idea overall.
“I’ll make no such promise.”
Ginny said he could cry with her. She had her head on his shoulder the day after Ron and Hermione left. He had just vowed not to burden them, and she was nudging gently at him to let his emotions go with her. He snapped at her, told her to stop meddling where he didn’t want her. She answered with fire, and they shouted at each other things they didn’t remember when they quieted and fell to the ground in front of the Burrow’s garden. They forgave almost immediately, and Ginny smiled at him. ‘I needed that’, she said and then told him they were better apart. He nodded and kissed her cheek.
“No, she mentioned him, and I bought it in muggle London.”
“Are you trying to battle the castle?” Harry says pointing with his head at the cuts on Malfoy’s hand. “It’s only been a week since you began your probation here.”
No one was able to make him let go of his hair. Minutes passed and some people suggested stunning him or that Madam Pomfrey be called. Until Seamus, as suddenly as he had started shouting, hugged Goyle and wept with him.
“Bishop to c4.” Harry says and the piece moves with a grunt.
“And you don’t want to get attached with me?” Harry looks at him ruefully and retreats.
Draco kiss him lightly and puts his hair behinds his ears, his fingers track the edges and slide down his neck.
“It’s too late, child!” shrieks a high-pitched voice. “I told you to clean yourself before you touch him. You don’t deserve him. You don’t deserve anything, freak.”

Before they arrive at the office Malfoy stops, “What am I doing? You know the way, Potter. I delivered the message and I have things to do.” Malfoy turns and walks past Harry.
Harry shakes his head. “I’m fine.”
They Apparate to Hogsmeade and walk to the castle in the middle of a comfortable silence. They come in the common room and Harry sees Ron in an armchair by the fire. He’s playing chess by himself. Hermione is not there.
“It’s not hot? Are you trying to die from dehydration?”
“You’re right. You’re not that, Draco. This is part of who you’ve become and keep growing to be. Dumbledore once said that it’s our choices that makes us who we are, and I’ve seen you battle to make the right ones since the end of sixth year. Though you
“Yeah.”
“Who?”

“Did you lose them?” Harry opens an eye, but she doesn’t seem unkind or full of false pity. He nods and closes his eye. “I thought so. Many people tattoo their loved ones or symbols of them. They want them close. The skin is as close as they can come to remember love isn’t lost. Yes, they’re in their hearts but we can’t see hearts.”
“Good to see you, mate.” Ron says. “It’s been ages.”
“Malfoy.” Harry follows him without realizing. Malfoy has already turned in the corridor that leads back to the stairs and Harry sees him rubbing at his shoulder. He stops then and frowns, is it possible?
Harry sees a yellow-light hover above the Hooded Hunter and, before he can say something, it whips on the air and the man falls against Harry with a grunt. Harry looks over him. Rosier is barely awake but points his wand at them, he moves it in a lash movement and the yellow light surges from the wand’s tip again. Harry pushes the man aside and stuns Rosier again under his stretched arm.
“I don’t want you to see me. Turn them off.”
“I don’t” You’re already pretty, Harry wanted to say, I’ll go blind if you light up more; but Draco could also float like Aunt Marge if he was lauded too much. So, he contented with a smirk and a stolen kiss in the deep earth, surrounded by luminous stars.
“You don’t understand, Draco.”
Harry had like having all his friends around his house. He knew they were under his roof, and Grimmauld knew he cared, so the house occasionally let him know they were fine.
When all at once I saw a crowd,
Harry’s arm became colder where the curse lay; it was spreading through his body, but it sang to his heart, and it was playful. Draco’s wand was shining green, imbued by his new magic.
These repercussions are the reason why Harry and Draco walk down the Main Street of Dufftown the next weekend, the Clock Tower standing at their backs, their steps resounding in the street. Ron and Hermione are not with them this time. Harry and Draco might take hours to be back and Ron and Hermione wanted to rest in the castle.
“You would never, Harry. Look at me. You would never. You saved me more than once. You saved us all, you died for it. You love fiercely like your mom. You would never ruin me. Your aunt was a cruel woman, it’s not you. It’s her.”
“I wandered lonely as a cloud
“But you touched him, you made him dirty.”
“Roll your eyes all you want. I’m adorable, and you’re smiling.”
“I have a scar in my forearm. I want a dragon looped around it, and the dragon should be surrounded by white and yellow daffodils.”
“Your arms, stop scratching them, you’re bleeding.”
“Get up, Potter. I’m not getting killed by Molly Weasley’s wand.”
“I’m just tired and this is boring.”
Harry laughed, Draco looked at him and smiled slowly, very slowly. Both have been watching the same feet show. “Thank Merlin for Nev and Ernie and all our lungs,” said Harry.

“They’re my family.”
“There’s the man. I thought he had abandoned you.” Aileen says fondly to Draco. “Or worse, that someone kidnapped my best client.”
“And they have delicious whiskey.”
“Have you finished? Breath. It’s not like I don’t try. I’m here, right?”
“You shouldn’t.” Draco tries to hide the hurt, but Harry sees it. “It’s not you. I always want to feel you, but I can’t, Draco. I’m a freak.”
“Draco, we both have history in our skin and mind.” Harry traces his fingers over Draco’s chest, his shoulder and his arm. “These were made with me next to you; you saved those people”. Harry trembles, “They show how I almost lost you.” He chases his hand with his lips, “But that you’re also here. Let me see you. Let me learn you again, and again.”
“I’m fine, really.” Draco doesn’t look convinced.
“Didn’t know she made an appointment.”
“Don’t worry, Zabini. He sold himself out with the enthusiasm he showed with the Potter Stinks badges.” Ron says.
“Not your business. But I’m telling her a story to relax her.”
“You left out that you like him but are scared?”
“If you have a better suggestion I’m listening. He’s really not good at it.”

Harry and Teddy play. Draco watches.
“We’re done, Harry.” Aileen says one and a half hour later.
were bad at it back then.”
“He hasn’t done anything to make me distrust him yet. And is not like I can say a word against a reconciliation between Dromeda and Teddy’s last living family.”
“Potter.” Nott greets with an amused grin.
Aileen laughs and claps the chair again, “Welcome to my dungeon, Mr. Malfoy.”
, with a significant look and a grin (that he hoped was full of innuendo and not an ounce of sadness or fear of losing them —a fear he still is struggling with, even more since the attack on Andromeda and Teddy in June.) She had smiled sheepishly, the same as Ron and they had nodded and that had been it.
“Don’t be. I’m fine. Just tired.”
“Are you alright, Potter?” Draco asks. Harry smiles and it comes easy now, though he doesn’t feel it. It’s like years have passed since he felt fine, but it’s only been a month, since he read Malfoy’s poem and played chess with Ron here. He’s tired, and he wants to let everything go. It will be easy. He no longer yearns for anything, but the man who’s speaking to him now. But he’s afraid and Draco still calls him Potter.
Thank you for reading :3
He returned to Grimmauld and curled alone in Sirius’ bed, the night weighted on him and he choked with fear. A crack inside him had the shape and sound of their portkey disappearing. He didn’t sleep that night, Fred’s funeral fresh in his mind too. The guilt at his lack of tears or emotions the previous day overwhelmed him and kept his eyes opened so he could feel how undeserving of the Weasley’s love he was. He vowed in the morning to care for them even more and part of that was not disappearing and burdening them with his nasty lack of emotions, or rather the tight knot that dislodged him from them. He has kept his promise.
Harry looks at them, he’s been looking at them. He sees their relaxed and confiding postures, the easy way they’re sitting and touching at each other. Comforting and taking pleasure from each other. Harry wants that and he wants it with Draco. He wishes it so strongly, he says, “I love him.”
A howl broke the whispers of the spirits. Draco growled.
Harry uncovers his arms. “You won’t see much. There’s another two here” Harry points at his chest. “Pawn to e4.”
The Ministry employs charm the coffins to go down deep on the ground and the soil falls on them. Harry shudders and Ron holds his shoulder. He wants to grab him like Molly does and keep him from leaving again. The mocking sun that blinds him when its beams cut through the leaves feels more bearable with him by his side. The sky should cry, so he could too.
A few days later, Harry was wailing he couldn’t get Walburga’s portrait down, though he had convinced the house to change everything else, including unhanging the House-Elves heads (Kreacher took and kept them with him, Harry’s never asked where, when Harry offered to bury them.) Harry pleaded, ‘You have more experience than any of us, you repaired the Manor.’ Draco looked down at him with disdain and Harry said ‘Please, Draco.’ It was the first time he used the name out loud and to the owner’s face. Draco bent his head a little, flushed and nodded.
“It’s not like I have something better to do, you nuisance. Next time find a hairdresser or pay me.”
.” The strength of the attack makes Harry back off on his broken leg and he can’t protect himself or dodge Lestrange’s next curse.
“Alright.” Harry says. He sits across Ron. “Hullo, mate. And Mione?”
The soil finished covering the tombs and Harry turns slightly to see Ginny next to Molly. Her eyes shine with sadness when she returns his gaze but they’re fond and caring. Harry turns his stare back to the front and smiles at the thought that Ginny seems to be better than him at letting go, as she promised him. He hopes he gets there soon too.
“He did look changed when he talked to me and apologized.” Hermione still has tears falling from her pretty eyes and dark circles under them. “Surprising of Malfoy, but it speaks volumes about him now.” Harry nods.
“It’s fine, Potter.” Draco moves his hand out of Harry’s grasp and touches his left forearm. “I want to change it. This is what I am, but not entirely. Not anymore, I think.”
Harry didn’t move. The spirits left Draco’s side and came closer to him. Those who couldn’t touch him climbed the trees beside him and hung from them.
“Anyway, the dragon is me and my family. A reminder of the wrong choices I’ve made, and the reasons why. A sign to never be full of myself again. The flowers are my mother’s love and new beginnings, something I wanted to give myself without forgetting the past. Never doing that.”
“Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy, Right?” The tattoo artist calls them and saves Harry from Draco’s sarcastic tongue. “My name is Aileen. If you like we can discuss what each of you want and the easiest comes first. It’s that alright?”
Prompt: mirror.

“Of course not. I’m a coward. I was not even them. A shadow in the presence of light is a silhouette, in the dark is invisible.”
“What are you talking about, Harry?”
“You’re not, Harry. Let me heal you. Please.”
“That’s what Voldemort thought too.”
Harry throws the teddy dragon in the air. Teddy sits in front of him. Draco looks at them, leaning on the wall under the porch of Andromeda’s house. Teddy’s chubby baby hands open and close, he giggles, and his hair is black and messy. Harry catches the teddy dragon and hides it behind his back. Teddy sobers up; Harry inclines and kisses his nose, which makes both of them laugh.
Prompt: carefree.
In his room he undresses and leaves his clothes where they fall, just like all the other nights since October began. If his room is not a mess it is because of Kreacher, and Harry knows it. The elf leaves food for him every night with a scolding note about the mess he’s found from the previous night. Tonight, there’s Treacle Tart with pumpkin juice and steak and ale pie. Before, it would have bothered him to leave the food untouched and the note unopened. Not now. The room lights shake, “I’m sorry, pretty. I don’t feel like it.” His bed creaks and the windows quake. “Tomorrow I’ll eat just fine, I promise. I just want to sleep.”
“I heard you got hurt. Don’t look surprised, Potter. It’s not that I care how are you, I just want to rub salt in your wounds. There’s never been anyone who gets hurt more than you while saving people. Really, Potter, what is your problem? Can you try not to die each time?”
Harry sighs. “I know, babe.”
“Just leave it, Potter”.
Everyone looks at him interested. In a flash too fast for Harry to keep up, his friends arrange a bonfire party by the Great Lake, it’s been at least a month since they had one. He agrees to participate with one of his bogus smiles. He hopes Hermione will have something to say about a party when they have NEWT’s to study for. But, when she comes back with her hair tousled, a happy small smile and says she will ask for permission from McGonagall, Harry’s heart sinks. He wants to be excited, but he isn’t. He wants to share knowing grins, like everyone is doing to Ron’s blushed and Hermione’s satisfied faces and feel it. He wants to touch Malfoy, but he doesn’t dare.
There’s an owl rapping at one of the glass panes. In fact, he recognises it. It’s Mabel, one of the Weasley’s owls, purchased for the Burrow after Errol passed away.
He grabs for his cloak and scarf, tearing back through the greenhouse, leaving the startled Professor in his wake. “Merry Christmas to you too, Harry!” Neville calls.
“No one uses it to mean
Harry rocks back on his heels with a self-deprecating laugh. He thinks about Ginny accusing him of having no life outside of the club.
What little time he and Ginny were able to spend together just seemed to illustrate how rapidly their lives were diverging. And when her travel schedule with the team picked up, they agreed that trying to stay together just no longer made sense. At the time, Harry thought he should have been more bereft, and credited his absence of feelings on the subject to being unable to handle much of anything in the way of emotion in the immediate aftermath of the war.
Harry’s stomach does an unusual thing at the idea of Malfoy discussing him with his friends.
One day Harry is going to have to get Hermione to explain portrait magic to him; he understands so little about it. But only when he has some extra time on his hands for all the reading she’ll inevitably assign him on the subject. Maybe the next time he has the flu.
“Malfoy.” Potter gives him a very small smile, just the corners of his mouth. As if he’s pleased to see Draco but doesn’t want to let on. It does something ugly to Draco’s insides when he realises it’s the first time Potter’s ever smiled at him that way. That it’s not something he’ll ever get to see in real life.
When Harry kisses him he tastes like salted caramel and a future Harry had long since given up on. One that he finally feels he might be ready to believe in again.
together. If only he’d moved faster. If only Ron had listened when he —
“We need to take him in, Harry. You’re basically harbouring someone who isn’t even allowed to be here.”
He nods, swinging his legs over the side of the bed and getting to his feet carefully. He feels a little lightheaded and food makes sense.
“I’ll ring you when I find it, I guess,” he says glumly.
“Stop speaking in riddles,” Harry snaps. “Who’s fixing up the house?”
Malfoy looks stricken. “And why
Harry lifts the heavy gift bag up and clunks it down on Draco’s desk in frustration.
“You want to pay me to sit with Malfoy while Ron questions him?” Harry tries to be polite, but it seems like a ridiculous idea. As if Malfoy needs that sort of help. He’s more than capable of slicing Ron apart with just the sharp edge of his tongue.
Hermione takes out Ravenclaw’s diary and unwraps it carefully on Pince’s desk. “All the more reason to finish as soon as we can. The castle will open up and we can walk right out.”
Harry shrugs and nods.
Draco shakes his head. “I don’t believe that Harry. And I don’t think you do either, not really.”
"It was a really good picture," she calls after him, sniggering, and he flips her off as he rounds the corner to the Floos.
“No, you daft prat. I want you to come ice-skating with me. The calendar cares about
“No, Harry, as usual, you didn’t think at all.”
“Are you going there this afternoon? Only I’d an extra box of dried nettles that Hannah doesn’t need in the Infirmary here. I thought they might as well have it over the holiday.”

“I suppose you think it’s all okay now. Hermione Granger lowering herself to shag Pansy makes it acceptable. Maybe you can get Weasley to take up with Millicent, and it can become an official thing for all three of you. The Chosen Ones pity shag their less fortunate former classmates to show just how
Teddy waves a charred and smoking stick of bread in his general direction. Hermione gives him an all-too penetrating stare that he immediately looks away from. He’s gone before Harry can even turn around from the fire.
ghosts, I mean, though the real ones were no picnic either — and I don’t want it to be because we’re not sure about tomorrow.”
“And we decided to sleep next to a room full of potions ingredients that haven’t been maintained in a decade,” Hannah concludes, looking even more pale.
The pub is crowded and warm, filled with witches and wizards having a final catch-up before the holiday festivities begin. Harry keeps glancing at the Floo like a nervous tic, until finally it’s Zabini and Parkinson stepping through, Draco right on their heels.
Maybe it will help him convince her to sign him out early.
The Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom is as much of a wasteland as the rest of the floor. The cabinet that once helped them train against Boggarts is collapsed across the doorframe and they shove it out of the way. Hermione heads straight to the bookshelves behind the teacher’s desk to get the dictionary of spellcasting. The others keep practising Harry’s shield spell.
Luna was the one who first told them Gallagher’s story. One of his friends had been admitted to the Janus Thickey Ward with mental exhaustion; the other had been whisked off by his parents to Durmstrang to complete his schooling. But Robert had come to Luna hoping
“You’re really good with him,” Harry says, as Draco lands on the pitch in front of him.
She looks around the library with a stricken expression. “Yes. The spell I cast deadened the magic in the books. It’s a horrible act of vandalism.” She almost seems more upset by that than anything else that’s happened today, which just unnerves Harry further.
Teddy is delighted, hugging Draco tightly, and immediately launching into a lengthy explanation of the game console to Ron.
“Not everything is about you, you self-centred narcissist,” Malfoy growls back. “I don’t give a fuck about your political campaign or the wizarding world’s stupid little elections. Someone has been messing with me. For days now. I’m constantly finding things I don’t recognise in my home. Everytime I turn around it’s like there’s someone just out of sight, out of the corner of my eye. I feel like there’s somewhere I’m supposed to be. Like I’ve forgotten an appointment but
,” Harry spits out.
Draco rolls his eyes. “I think you should start working on flying
In theory.
Draco doesn’t even have the good grace to look guilty or apologetic about it. He just looks confused and upset.
Harry shrugs. “No, no idea. He was just lying there on the ground.”
, Draco realises, as the Cottage re-materialises in front of them.
And before Harry can muster any kind of a protest, he’s gone.
“Draco, call me Luna,” she says, with a small frown. “And you’re not strong enough to go again right now either.”
Harry looks around, keeping an eye on the exits. The ballroom has been beautifully decorated for Christmas. Enormous green garlands are strung across the ceiling, woven through with holly and pinecones and enchanted snow. A truly towering tree stands beside the stage, with fairies dancing in all of the branches. Against the wall nearest Harry, a sleigh is stacked high with gold-wrapped packages.
Harry nods, waving off her concern. “What’s going on?”
Harry is polite enough not to ask about the
He gets up out of the wobbly guest chair, once again taking up too much space. Harry feels tired and uncomfortable. He thinks he should probably be able to muster up some sympathy for Balham’s financial situation, but all he can think about are Luna and Nev and whether there will even be jobs for them come next week. For a second, Balham looks like he’s about to say something else, but then seems to decide better of it. He waddles out the door of Harry’s office without so much as a backward glance.
accomplishment, Ms Granger. However did you manage it?”
Malfoy opens his mouth as if he’s about to protest and then thinks better of it, huffing as he pushes off the wall and past Harry, not waiting to see if he’ll follow.
“Yeah, it’s amazing!” He feels his face break into a wide grin. “You should come visit. I’d love to show you around. It’s a lot less stifling than here.”
“The thing is,” Hermione continues, her customary enthusiasm building, “it’s a restorative justice process — something we’re drawing on from Muggle communities — and so it requires the consent of the victim’s family.”
He really needs to get out more.
Harry stares at it in horror. He can’t escape a sense of guilt, somehow. That the castle has been here the whole time, wounded and lost, and they’d just abandoned it.
“Stop, please,” Lovegood says quietly, and they all fall silent.
With the Gillyweed no longer protecting them, Harry feels the cold of the water keenly. They need to get out and get dry. Ahead of them the top steps emerge from the lapping water, meeting the double oak doors to the Castle.
“A little magical exhaustion,” she concludes finally, writing some notes on a piece of parchment. “Nothing some rest and a few potions won’t cure.”
“In the basement. We—” He gathers his thoughts, trying to focus on his fuzzy memories of the raid, rather than the creeping sense of disappointment that Draco has turned out to be nothing like he’d imagined and exactly like he should have expected.
“Because I
“You disagree?” Harry asks. He expected her to want to understand everything she can about the spells. Maybe Luna could share the academic work with her and the pair of them can nerd out over it together. It doesn’t have to have anything to do with him. He doesn’t have to play guinea pig.
Harry thinks about Draco yelling at him when they fought weeks ago.
Malfoy rubs absently at his eyebrow with his thumb as he gathers his thoughts. “Well, as you know, I’m only allowed to go to St Mungo’s for life-saving emergency treatment, so I haven’t been checked by a Healer.”
Hermione pulls candles from her pack and sets them out on the floor in a wide circle. Draco follows behind her, lighting each one with his spell.
In the immediate aftermath of the roasted chestnut bombardment, it felt like every person working in the Ministry came running. The mediwizards made sure that no-one’s injuries were serious, refusing to let Harry do anything until he’d submitted to a completely unnecessary examination.
“Be a bit hard to confuse you with anyone when you’re here every other week with that scathing but very attractive viper you call a boyfriend.”
“Happy anniversary,” he says, clinking his wine against Draco’s, who is suddenly finding it impossible to think, let alone speak.
“I wasn’t even hit,” he complained, but he was ignored.
Draco shakes his head, but he’s still smiling, so Harry figures the news can’t be all bad. “The goblins got a better offer.”
Harry feels his face heat and suddenly he wishes he hadn’t said anything. He never jokes around about it usually, and it’s like he’s just handed ammunition to a mortal enemy. He feels exposed and vulnerable.
“Trust me, Hermione,” Luna insists. “Do it Draco’s way.”
Harry takes the package, which appears to be a set of pillowcases embroidered with festive messages. “Brrrrrrrr,” reads one. “Wake me up when winter ends,” reads another.
“Thought Hermione was tired of that Indian,” he muses in place of a greeting.
There’s a shimmer and shift, and a heavy wooden door appears. It has thick iron hinges and a haft with a giant lock hanging open.
“I like to fly,” Draco says absently, taking in the details as he sits in the grass. Potter is still wearing glasses, but not the cheap, cracked plastic Muggle frames of his childhood. There is no scar on his forehead.
Harry’s jaw drops open and his face heats up. That was
Harry looks at the pile of clothes he’s assembled on his bed. It’s not like Luna will care what he turns up in. She still dresses as though she’s been surprised by the contents of her wardrobe every morning. But Malfoy is a whole other story. Harry doesn’t know the first thing about fashion, but he knows that Malfoy always looks impeccable. He never has a hair out of place. It always makes Harry want to muss him up — tug out his shirttails and wrinkle his carefully pressed robes. And the idea of spending a weekend with his equally fussy pure-blood family?
Potter shakes his head, his expression pleading.
, spells that are
’? I certainly wouldn’t fight a cursed advent calendar for it.”
It’s only as Hannah is dousing the torches that Harry realises Malfoy has slipped off again. Harry goes to check, finding him back in his old dorm.
“Thanks, Malfoy,” he mumbles.
, but I can see what's in the pantry," he repeats.
Harry ignores the jibe.
Draco falls in step beside him as they walk down the hill.
“Interesting idea, Potter, but no, I don’t think I will. You signed a new, binding contract with me for the whole season.”
The Fiendfyre has disappeared.
Harry gets out of bed and opens the window, looking about until he finds a dish of owl treats on a nearby shelf. He gives one to Mabel and takes the rolled piece of parchment.
“Do you really not know?”
He walks away to the showers, the sound of the water turning on loud in the sudden, awkward silence.
Two Trainee Healers, identified by mustard-coloured robes rather than the bilious green of their qualified colleagues, are clutching cafeteria coffee cups and staring up at the giant charmed board showing Healer assignments for the day.
made against us over a decade later. We were
“I don’t know about you, but I have no more recollection of our weekend in Brighton than I did this morning. Or our plans to remodel your bathroom. Or that hike we went on.”
“I’m not really one for speeches, as you know,” Harry goes on, ducking his head briefly, a blush rising high on his cheeks. “But I want you to know how happy the last few years have made me.”
“Let’s test it, then,” Ron suggests. “We could do the basic exam battery.”
Draco turns and surveys the room. “She was always protecting me from him. Right from the start. She made this place so it would be a refuge for me. He thought of child-rearing as beneath him, so she knew he would never come in here. I can actually remember the first time she brought me up, I was really small. Maybe four? One of the elves was waiting — they would always do absolutely anything for her. And when I came in, she cast some enchantment that made all the pictures all over the walls come to life. All my favourite bedtime songs and stories — Babbity Rabbit, the Wizard and the Hopping Pot, the Three Blind Mice—”
Lily died. Her ultimate sacrifice, borne out of her great love for Harry, tore the very magic from her line to defend him.
Besides, he’s not an idiot. He’s more than capable of looking up a botanical handbook without Hermione, and if he does need help, there’s always Neville. As Harry makes his way to the library, he rounds a corner and collides bodily into Millicent Bulstrode, who promptly spills the cup of coffee she’s carrying down her front.
“Uh, the party...”
The voice is Draco’s, and Harry is impossibly glad to see him.
Harry walks over and sits down beside him, unsure of what to say. He wants to congratulate him on what was clearly a very difficult job well done, but it feels awkward. He and Malfoy don’t really chat, even when they run into each other at the Ministry or they're on a case together. Malfoy is leaning forward, his blond hair a curtain, his shoulders slumped with exhaustion. Harry hands him a bottle of water he snagged off one of the ballroom tables, and Malfoy accepts it gratefully, taking several long swallows.
“It’s not fair. You’re the one who set the terms of our relationship!” Harry protests. “You’re making it sound like I—”
Draco’s heart plummets through the floor. This is catastrophic. He can’t believe he’s let this happen. If he had
. Comforting. There’s supposed to be a lot of it.” Harry twists his hands awkwardly in his lap. “Not a fucking fernshoot rolled up on a plate.” He doesn’t look up in case he sees the pity he expects in Neville’s eyes. “So, what, you’ve just forgiven him then? You’re mates now?” He wishes it didn’t sound so petty.
“I can go again,” he says, ignoring Weasley and speaking directly to Granger. “Now that he’s on life support, it’s in some ways less risky. Lovegood’s spell will be sustaining him.”
He’d thought about going to the Wand the night before he left. But it was too raw. He was so disappointed that Draco hadn’t felt the way Harry wanted him to. Seeing him for another night of clearly meaningless sex after that seemed pointless, no matter how good it would have been.
but he has no idea what, and Bill seems content to proceed as if they meet all the time.
“I was actually hoping to use your kitchen,” Harry says, pulling faces at Hugo until the little boy chuckles.
Both Harry and Draco are almost at a loss for words in the changing room, clapping the players on their backs proudly.
was there!”
“There’s no way that should have happened,” she says with a frown. “I designed those mail wards myself. I’ll come by tomorrow and take a look at them.”
Harry fidgets, waiting impatiently in the endless silence broken only by the ticking of the huge antique clock on the wall and the scratching of Gasnard’s quill.
“Why would I stay in England?” Draco fires back. “I tried, Harry. I really did. But you’re never going to see me any differently than the way I was when we were boys. And that’s just a metaphor, really. If
Behind them, Hannah lets out a sudden scream. She had stepped away from the group to get dressed, and as they run towards her, Harry realises she’s wrapped in Devil’s Snare. The plant is much larger and more aggressive than the one he remembers, long flailing vines lurching around a corner out of the dark.
“Always after dinner Holber brings Master Malfoy Senior his nightcap in his study,” Holber says solemnly. “And last night Holber has prepared a tray and brought it to the study, but Master Lucius and Master Draco were inside and very angry. So Holber left the tray on a side table outside.”
The stone scrapes his knuckles as he heaves himself out of the water and takes the steps two at a time, reaching the top with a gasp.
“Come on,” Rose calls, wriggling down and dragging at his hand. “Let’s check.”
Harry wakes to an absolute thundering noise in his ears that he’s distressed to realise is just his head pounding. He groans, rolling over to find a small vial of Hangover Potion sitting on the nightstand. Malfoy is nowhere to be seen.
Harry is last in line, walking behind Malfoy.
“Once we chew it,” Harry says quickly, refusing to look at Malfoy opposite. “It happens quite quickly. And it’s not very comfortable. As soon as you feel the gills on your neck you’ll want to go into the water.”
you stay,” Ron says. “You’re obviously free to go. I’m asking you to stick around for one more night and help us finish our enquiries here, so that we don’t have to come and interrupt your
on holiday. And we all know how Potter had you in his thrall at school.”
“Seems to me that we’re all guilty of carrying a few too many secrets.”
Harry blushes violently. “No, he’s not...I mean we’re not...he’s not even here!”
“Not here, Harry,” he says, tilting his jaw to indicate the room they’re in. “It would be a little tacky.”
Hermione tells Harry all about Neville’s achievements, which just causes Nev to flush a bright red, as if being appointed full professor at Hogwarts at his age is something undeserved or that happened by accident. “I was just in the right place at the right time, when Pomona and Wilhelmina wanted to retire to somewhere warm,” he says. But teaching is something Harry feels increasingly passionate about, and they soon get lost in a discussion about Neville’s hands-on methods in the school greenhouses while Luna plays with the baby, and before Harry realises, several hours have passed.
An expression flickers over her face that’s hard to define. He wonders how Weasley feels about her bringing Draco here.
“I think he’s right,” Hermione says, prompting a slightly strangled noise from Ron. “Even if, somehow, you’d kept this relationship to yourself, and then decided to remove the memories of it…” She pauses for a second, and Harry can see that she’s thinking about her parents. “There’d be no way those of us who see you every day wouldn’t have noticed. There would be missing details, things that didn’t add up. We see you all the time. Lately, while you’ve been campaigning, all of wizarding London does.”
The back of Harry’s neck feels warm. It’s probably just the crowd.
“You what?” Ron’s obsession with the Cannons never faded after school, even as Harry signed with a rival team. Harry’s always been half-convinced that if he ever ventured into their bedroom, he’d find that Ron had persuaded Hermione to still have orange bedsheets and a team poster on the wall.
!” he calls, his voice ringing out around the pitch. “During practice with me there will be
He finds Neville in his workshop, bent over a piece of wood. He looks startled as Harry stalks into the room.
Before Neville can answer, the temperature drops again, and they hunch together while Harry casts.
Then he casts
Ron scowls, thinking, his fingers tapping a pattern on his knee.
It isn’t just that his alarm fails to wake him—
Hermione hums sympathetically. “It will pass. Harry was new and shiny, and Teddy’s just missing him.”
“What sort of techniques?” Nott screws up his face a little. Harry eyes him curiously.
Hermione’s late. Which makes no sense, because she’s usually in Harry’s library before he wakes up these days, and she’s always the one bouncing her knee and glaring at the clock waiting for all of the rest of them to arrive. So today — of all days — he’d expected her before dawn.
Malfoy’s expression is absolutely impassive. Harry searches for any sign to figure out what he’s thinking. If this makes him horribly uncomfortable, or if he feels trapped into this in some way, but there’s nothing.
“The woman you’re treating?” Harry asks in confusion.
“Come
“So, you’ve done… what we agreed?” Harry asks, and Draco nods slowly. He has. The vault is cleared. That was the deal.
“If you’ll excuse me. I don’t think I need to spend any more time with people who still clearly believe no one has changed one iota in over a decade. And I need to help Narcissa find a criminal advocate prepared to take Draco’s case.”
“We can’t stay in this, we need to get out,” he says, swimming toward the step beside Hannah and carefully reaching up to climb out. It’s almost as if someone shoves him; his locked elbows suddenly give and he finds himself sliding abruptly straight back into the lake.
What Neville is talking about would be different. More open-ended. This would be making longer-term plans. If he’s going to do this, he’s not going to half-ass it.
Harry stares at her like she’s been replaced by someone who he absolutely does not recognise. If they hadn’t been living in each other’s pockets for a week, he’d assume she was Polyjuiced.
“You’re right about that. At first, Hermione was simply very interested in the way the ceremony worked and what it meant for a couple’s magic. But you know her. Once she could see that there was a whole branch of magic she couldn’t have access to, she was determined to change that.”
. Ron, however, immediately trots after him, starting up a steady stream of conversation, replaying every spell cast in the hunt.
human being. You’d worked so hard and achieved so much. You took the second chance you were given and you absolutely earned it, and then some.”
“You should go catch up with him, Harry. You’ve changed a lot and so has he. It’s Wednesday, he’ll be at the Bent Wand tonight.”
Draco unfolds his arms. “You asked Hermione about this?” His tone is gentler, if still a little incredulous.
“No, I think…
told him what happened the night Fire-Lord Azulon died.”
?!” she snaps. “Cracked
“Hosting people I don't like in my own home for a weekend?” he retorts.
Draco manages to both shrug and nod at the same time, affecting a kind of indifference that doesn’t convince Harry. “I mean, I don’t have a wand, so it’s not like I could conjure you anything.”
know you want to. You clearly haven’t had time yet or your otter would have chased me down yesterday.”
“Did it go okay?”
By the time Harry hears the Floo roar into life again, he and Malfoy have spread blank parchment all over his coffee table and are trying to make detailed lists of everything out of the ordinary that has happened to them recently.  Malfoy startles, looking at Harry with a panicked expression and Harry feels a momentary surge of guilt. “No, it’s okay,” he says, reaching out for Malfoy’s wrist to reassure him but Malfoy snatches it out of his grasp. “It’s just—”
The following week, he helps Teddy pack extra clothes in his backpack before he heads off to a Quidditch game with Rose and her family. Teddy’s summer vacation is coming to an end, and Draco thinks about how much he’ll miss him when he’s back at his Muggle primary. It doesn’t do to dwell on it too much, or he’ll start to think about how much more he’ll miss him next year when he heads off to Hogwarts.
Neville seems glad to have someone else take responsibility for the whole thing now that it might be connected to the murder.
Harry gives Malfoy a bewildered look, but before he can ask any more questions there’s a horrible noise behind them. Hannah lets out an unearthly wail.
“She … You don’t think she’d
He showers and dresses before heading downstairs. He digs around the teetering piles of files and paperwork in his study for a scrap of parchment, penning a quick owl to Luna asking after the patient before heading to the kitchen for breakfast.
“This weekend was the final straw. The way you lot swan around as if we’re all somehow less than you. Still holding the decisions our
“You haven’t told him?”
The next morning, Draco’s owl looks absolutely flustered as she lands beside his breakfast, her feathers all ruffled and out of order. He strokes her gently as he unfastens the copy of the
“It will be okay,” Harry says finally, more to fill the silence than anything.
,” she says. “It was a really quite significant Muggle discovery. It’s an acronym for deoxyribonucleic acid — basically the building blocks inside human cells, whether Muggle or magic. It’s a finding that’s been incorporated into quite a lot of recent magical research, too. But,” she says, ignoring the fact that several of the others are now gaping openly at her, “I am confused, Ron.”
“Gods that feels so good,” he groans, waving his wand arm around to set the room to rights. “Now all I need to do is check back into my hotel, shower for an unreasonable length of time, and—”
Hermione, though, has already caught on. “This room would share ventilation with … Potions, oh
Ron is looking much healthier the next morning, but agrees with Hannah that he’ll spend one more day recovering before joining them again.
Sure enough, Harry’s first few steps are tentative and shaky, while Malfoy shoots off across the pond like he’s trying out for the Olympics, showing off with a swift little series of turns. It’s mesmerising.
“Thank you,” he says, backing away suddenly, his shoes crunching on the gravel. “I have to—” he gestures at the school over his shoulder, still smiling broadly at Draco. “I’ll find you at the end.”
At this, Hermione softens a little, as if she’s finally realising that they’re reaching a milestone here too. They’ve done all they can.
“Because the thing is, I don’t think I particularly care about wizarding politics one way or the other,” Malfoy goes on. “Certainly not enough to pay any attention to the fact that you were running for office. And yet when I try and think about it now, about the Post-War Prohibitions and so on, my brain just keeps looping on the idea that I should go back to France as soon as possible.”

“Is there something called an “entail” or is the elf I just spoke to confusing it with another word?”
“Yes, thank you,” Harry waves a hand to cut them off. “I appreciate all your advice, albeit somewhat belated.”
Harry agrees readily, and after they finish more trifle than is probably sensible for the middle of the day, he dons his thick winter cloak and follows Neville down through the snow to the greenhouses.
“My father never saw the point of this when I was a child,” Malfoy says, tugging the sled behind him. “
Her words are pointed. Hermione's eyes are huge.
And so now he’s the proud owner of a beautiful country property, still being carefully restored, where once a month, a
The food is marvellous—Kreacher really has excelled himself—and before long Harry is pushing back his chair and wishing he could unfasten the button on his trousers. Everyone compliments the grouchy little elf, who bats away the praise with decreasing ferocity as the afternoon wears on.
“Merlin knows,” Harry groans. He should have scratched marks somewhere for each day to keep track.
He idly pushes the last of his dinner around the plate with his fork as he tells them both about Balham and his money woes.
“Let’s say you did have a party,” Ron says, shaking his head and adopting a practical tone. “You’d have invited loads of people. We just need to ask a few more and we’ll get to the bottom of this.”
,” Teddy groans and immediately turns his hair a shocking fluorescent pink. “There. I’ll give them something to look at.”
“I’m sorry for being snotty yesterday,” Potter surprises him by apologising immediately. “Lunch is on me.”
. He’s still here. He lives on in the scars he left, the shades he made out of people, the things they go on to do because of what he did to them. I know this, because that’s what your father gave me, when he gave me that diary. A special connection to the Dark Lord. A whole lifetime’s worth of
Harry gives his hand a squeeze, grateful for what feels like his own second chance.
“All spin and nonsense from the PR department, which just pissed off everyone else who worked the cases with me. Particularly my superiors.”
“Harry,” he finds himself correcting quickly, though he has no idea why. He just wants some distance between the children they were then and the men they are now.
“Oh, I was having trouble with the fire the other night. I assumed that’s what it was.”  Harry fills the kettle, and when he turns back he finds Kreacher poking around in his shopping.
No such luck.
“Would you be able to—”
“What?”
Teddy reemerges with a Tesco reusable bag and crams his toys inside. When they arrive at Grimmauld Place, he gives Draco a quick hug, kicks off his shoes, and takes off up the stairs, bellowing out to Andromeda about wanting spaghetti for dinner, unconcerned about where in the house she might be at the moment.
“Harry…” Draco’s not sure he can take this. He needs to burst this bubble swiftly, before he doesn’t have the strength to try — physically
“You’ll
“In fact, I think I suggested that Bill should blow them up.” He gives Draco a beautiful, rueful smile. “I didn’t have any idea that these rings would bring me back to my grandfather, build me a home that I love, give me the gift of a godson I couldn’t be more proud of, and help me meet the love of my life.”
“Harry, what are you doing," she sighs with a rueful smile. "When Russell comes out of her coma, I’ll question her as to Marsden’s whereabouts and how much she knew. Until then, go home. Or make yourself useful and help Ron and George at the shop. I don’t need Robards finding you here and bringing more plagues down upon our house.”
Draco agonised over that first guestlist, carefully choosing the kinds of witches and wizards who would be so fascinated by the absence of magic, and so impressed by the culinary talent on display, that they would rave to all their influential friends.
“One more time, please,” he says.
“Did you see Luna again today?” Draco asks.
“Leila's using a metronomic charm series for balance that’s really fascinating,” she says. “I’ve asked her to send me her Healer’s details in Paris so I can write him for more information.”
Nothing particularly Muggle about—.”
Hermione and Harry wear identical expressions, bursting with not being able to laugh out loud.
with Malfoy.
Pulling out of a particularly athletic dive right in front of their stand is none other than Cedric Diggory.
“Decorations on trees, tinsel. I’ve also been attacked by a rogue delivery of Christmas mail, and possibly ruined Islington’s annual lights display. Honestly, I think I should just give up. Clearly this is not the year for me to turn my hand to the festive season.”
“I think that’s at the core of the Room of Requirement’s magic. The castle will always help if you ask,” Hermione goes on. “Part of the ritual we’re planning is
“Because....” Hermione eventually speaks, slowly, as if she’s struggling a little. “It’s time to—”
“What was me,” Harry mumbles, confused and still trying to tug at Draco’s belt. When he processes that Draco is really no longer cooperating, he swivels around to see what he’s staring at.
Again, Luna’s an absolute master of the understatement. The terms of Malfoy’s exile and subsequent community service are well known to everyone around this table.
Ron seems like he’s biting his tongue. He studies Harry intently for a second, and then shrugs.
“It doesn’t make any sense that he’d want to help. Where did you even find him?”
“So should you. We couldn’t have done it without you. We’d have been reduced to chasing down media reports of kids doing weird things and hoping that wild magic was involved.”
“The Portkey, Hermione.
“I’m not… I just… I have an idea about the rings.”
was going to be the one to back down.
Hermione is waiting in their office, pacing.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco says. “About Ginevra — Ginny. I know you broke up a long time ago, but this still must be terrible. For all of you.”
“Right. Here’s what you need to do.”
Harry tries to summon some of his famed Gryffindor bravery, so that he can find words to tell Draco that he’s miserable about the idea of not seeing him every day from now on without the excuse of visiting Belle. That he doesn’t want to wait until the next time a curse rebounds badly to find out what colour suit Draco’s wearing. That he’d like to have coffee in the blue dining room again.
Draco tries to regain control of the situation by ignoring Harry completely and retelling Hannah’s story about the Hogwarts student and his carrot.
But he’s managing, is the thing. This awkward detente where the two of them seem to have silently divided Britain between them and gone on about their lives is working. Right up until Draco walks in to the Bent Wand one Wednesday night to find Harry sitting at the bar.
“And towards the end there, I got the wrong idea. Or, I thought I did, anyway. Making scrambled eggs in your kitchen and taking Teddy flying and having you at my side at Hogwarts. I started to think that things might be different. That maybe you might be interested in something more with someone like me.”
There was no way Draco was not going to notice the boner growing between them.
It also wasn't like him to take such a keen interest in the love lives of his students.
Harry gasped before physically pushing Professor Snape out of the way.
Harry sighed as he waited for the remainder of the students to turn up.
Only this time, Snape seemed to pry further than just his surface memories, the ones he chose to sacrifice in favour of protecting his inner most thoughts.
Harry's broomstick acted as though of it's own accord, quickly gouging the brush of Draco's broomstick. Harry gasped, watching in horror as Malfoy lost his balance before tumbling from his broom.
"Professor, I have a question." Hermione began as her mind searched desperately to find something she didn't already know the answer to.
How did Snape know about his crush?
Then again, he'd take Snape any day over Umbridge.
Perfect.
He felt the blood drain from his face as he rose from the seat.
The professor wasted no time covering this expression up though as he turned on his heel, his back was now to Harry.
Snape sat within the stands, a smug smirk lined his lips as he gazed down at an agitated Malfoy and a very embarrassed Potter.
The chosen one interested in a boy from his house of Slytherin.
Harry's eyes followed the professor as he paced back and forth in front of him.
From the vantage point his seat offered, Snape watched in amusement as Draco's eyes searched the Great Hall; as though attempting to locate that which he had missed, yet Snape had so blatantly witnessed.
The mere smirk, reminiscence of a once, perhaps more playful Snape flashed across his lips.
Well, to him at least.
Perhaps he didn't want his mind taken off of it.
"So what?" Harry prompted after what seemed like an appropriate amount of time had past. It wasn't like the professor to invite such a vague demeanor.
"I believe you have a secret admirer." Snape smirked as he made sure to keep his eyes firmly fixed upon Malfoy.
Harry turned around, attempting to make his movements seem as casual and natural as possible.
He did, after all, take great delight in humiliating the son of James Potter.
His attention was soon broken as a notebook was gently shoved in front of him. He knew it came from Ron, after all, who else would it be from?
"S-sorry." Harry stumbled, racing to grab his broomstick
Snape decided it was time as he moved from behind his desk before hovering around the classroom. He kept his eyes on Potter as he once again turned his attention tot he blonde wizard.
Or perhaps the reverse was true?
Harry seemed to forget that he had an audience as the jeering and booing of the crowd around suddenly struck his ears like a whip.
Besides, he didn't exactly want to bring up the conversation of who his crush was again. Ron seemed to have forgotten and he could do without the pestering.
Harry flinched, his body seeming to have a mind of it's own as his groin began to stir.
Snape swirled the fire whiskey around in its glass before drawing it to his lips.
"What is it Ron?" Hermione stated, almost impatiently as her upmost priority was to get to transfiguration.
This would be much better.
From here he could gaze all he wanted without making it too obvious and if he had a repeat of the Defence against the Dark Arts incident again, well it would be less obvious from here. Besides, surely there would be no way Snape would put him through that, not after he had just relived it with him last night.
"Why don't you come up here to the front of the class and apologize for causing such an interruption?" Umbridge seemed amused as she didn't bother to mask to delight in her eyes.
"Fine." Harry lied, his tone cold as embarrassment swept over his face.
How had she not noticed?
Had he noticed?
"Tonight Mr Potter," Snape drawled as his fingers collected an assortment of ingredient bottles from his cupboard before placing them onto the table in front of Harry.
Draco lounged about lazily in the Slytherin common room, tossing an apple up into the air before promptly catching it.
It was the only thing he could think of to stop this intimate memory from playing out before his most hated professor's eyes.
~*~*~
~*~*~
At least that's what he told himself as he felt waves of pleasure course through his body.
At least this class wasn't a total waste, he might as well make use of the time as his gaze returned to Draco.
It wasn't like Snape to drag out these Occulency lessons, normally he hardly had a chance to think and the man was invading his mind.
It didn't seem like the answer Snape had wanted, nor expected as a flash of disappointment shot through his eyes.
No way.
"What was that about?" Ron screwed up his face, as though demanding an answer from his friend.
Potions.
Snape stood at his potions classroom window, his eyes falling on the Great Lake, yet his thoughts were further still.
"How about I apologize for him." Ron rose from his seat, preparing to stroll to the front of the class as a substitute for his best friend.
A chuckle escaped his best friends lips.
Great.
A mixture of disappointment and disgust welled inside his heart, all of which was aimed solely at himself.
Snape swooped in, placing himself conveniently behind the raven haired wizard before pressing his lips within a few inches of Harry's ear.
The raven haired wizard slid his hand down his pants, quickly tightening his fingers around his member before gently tugging on it.
He would have to be extra careful as his eyes ran over Ron's words before him.
Snape furrowed his eyebrows as he ran through all possibilities through his mind as though it were a difficult math's question.
"Who?" Draco began, at first sounded disgusted, as though he thought his admirer were Snape himself.
Snape raised his wand with very little warning, aiming it straight for Harry's forehead.
"What the hell are you playing at Potter?" Draco spat as he raised his hand before shoving Harry off of him.
Oh no.
Harry noticed from the corner of his eye that Ron was mouthing something to Hermione, something he hoped the rest of the class wouldn't figure out.
"Why don't you thank her yourself? She's right here." Ron screwed up his face in confusion as he yanked Hermione closer.
That was enough!
Harry bit his lip, knowing he was going to receive taunt after relentless taunt for this.
It had to be.
Too bad he knew that was never going to be his reality.
Not during class.
"Legilimens!" Snape called his first and only warning as Harry barely had time to brace himself.
~*~*~
"Not now child, can't you see I'm busy?" Umbridge chuckled as though it were the most obvious thing in the world.
"Think this is funny do you?"
He had to stay calm, not give a way any more displays of interest in the blonde.
He had to get a hold of himself!
Harry winced as Snape watched the memory of him sliding his hand down his trousers.
~*~*~
As close as this game would allow.
Snape chuckled ever so slightly as his eyes fell upon Harry occupying a seat at the back of the class.
what was it...?
Today was an important quidditch match, probably the most important one.
Crabbe burst out laughing, his action quickly intercepted by a dirty look from Draco.
Curiosity?
~*~*~
But tonight, it seemed as though the professor wanted to, talk?
He followed Hermione and Ron, only this time he insisted they sit at the back of the classroom.
The professor collected a glass half filled with an amber liquid; before holding it up towards his eyes.
There was no way he would be able to stop Snape from witnessing that memory if he were to invade his memories again tonight.
"It's nothing." Harry lied, hoping it was indeed nothing, yet a gnawing in his stomach suggested otherwise.
Potions.
"Ron?" Harry whispered as the trio wandered to transfiguration, he believed with the mutterings of other students, that Hermione wouldn't be able to hear these few words.
"He told me I have a secret admirer."
He had been waiting for this for far too long as a smug expression consumed his face.
"How would he know? He's a professor. What student would tell a professor about their crush?" Parkinson interrupted, making it blatantly apparent that she had been eavesdropping.
Harry froze, not actually expecting this degree of contact.
"Thank me for what?" Hermione looked genuinely confused as she reshuffled the large stack of books in her arm.
Or more likely pure wishful thinking.
The memory from this morning's Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson began to resurface.
It was also a fact that didn't go unnoticed by the professor.
He would just have to figure out another way to get to figure this out.
There was only one way to find out as he swung his broom around, wasting no time as he pursued the blonde.
This was new.
This was not good.
Snape's jaw dropped.
Harry resisted the urge to hurl up his breakfast as his eyes traced the words.
While he could be cold, cynical and down right mean at times, it also wasn't very becoming of him to tell secrets that weren't his to tell.
Damn it.
~*~*~
Still, that didn't stop him from prodding the bear as it were.
Harry sat at his usual seat towards the front of the class, his goal today was to keep Ron awake during another boring lesson of Defence Against the Dark Arts.
Who would have thought?
Harry stood outside the door to Snape's office.
Of course, he would rather Snape witnessed none of his thoughts and memories at all.
Never mind.
Was it...
Oh no.
He couldn't possibly guess why that might be.
What's worse is he had an occlumency lesson scheduled tomorrow evening with Professor Snape.
Hermione rolled her eyes before nodding ever so slightly, hoping to evade the eyes of Umbridge as she slid her wand out from her rope pocket. She wasted no time aiming it at Harry from under the desk before muttering a spell she had never had the need to use until now.
It was all starting to make sense now.
What was Potter finding so fascinating about Malfoy?
The hint of a smile grew at the corners of Snape's lips as he suddenly ceased his pacing.
Then again, this was Snape.
He'd given away his own secret.
"Sorry professor." Harry offered as he rose from his seat and headed for the front of the classroom.
It was a chuckle he seemed incapable of ignoring.
He pushed past the professor, yet Snape made no attempt to stop him.
"You know, that spell you used in class." Harry interrupted, suddenly wishing to cease this conversation.
He would be quite happy if he never had to look at another cauldron, potion bottle or better yet, Professor Snape ever again.
"Harry just asked me to thank you."
Harry audibly groaned as the three approached the all too familiar wooden door to the potions classroom.
Harry promptly closed his lips as he struggled to reset his poker face.
He knew this was going to happen.
Instantly Snape tore his way into the young wizard's mind.
It seemed as though Draco consistently sat at the back, which always made it difficult to stare without the whole class seeing him crane his neck at a very obvious angle.
Draco caught the apple before stalling, he forced himself to sit upright, as though what he was about to say was of the upmost importance.
Snape screwed up his face like a paper bag at the thought.
Or perhaps he just didn't want
"I have to go." Harry puffed as though he had just come back from running a marathon.
It was the beginning of the lesson as Harry felt a tightness contract in his abdomen.
This wasn't good.
There it was.
He wasted no time as his eyes searched the room for one person and one person only.
~*~*~
Snape leaned back in chair, a book within his grasp as his eyes danced lazily over the words.
If he had cast Legilimens upon him one more time before he left, he knew he would have been able to get to the bottom of it.
His eyes quickly darted to Umbridge before returning to the notebook now placed in front of him.
~*~*~
How would Snape know?
This couldn't get any worse!
Flashes of Hermione and Ron darted across his eyes, followed by an assortment of teachers. Harry had to stop Snape from getting a foothold in any memory and prayed this display of people important to him would suffice.
"Did Snape just laugh?" Ron raised an eyebrow in a disturbed confusion as he whispered the words to Harry.
Harry desperately wanted to thank Hermione for her help back in class, yet every time he tried, his throat would choke up in embarrassment.
A faint smile grew on Harry's lips as he watched Draco turn up late, an act that resulted in him being forced to sit right at the front of the class.
Oh no.
Yes, perhaps an intervention was in order.
Perhaps.
Harry wasn't ready as he felt Snape's eyes drill holes into him.
Snape stood as witness to Harry's humiliation as he relived this morning's episode of Harry has an unwanted erection in class and his best friend notices.
He deliberately veered left, his eyes immediately locating Malfoy as he honed in on him.
"Oh, don't mention it." Hermione nodded, as though suddenly remembering the event her two friend were referring to.
The young wizard had wanted to tell his friends, well Ron at least about his Occlumency lesson last night and how mortifying it had been. How Snape had seen his memory about his erection in class, about how Snape had pretty much watched him masturbate in his memories. Only, Harry decided perhaps it was best not to share such things, even if Ron was his best friend.
"Because it's embarrassing." Harry muttered in a low voice.
Was that disgust?
Malfoy and Potter in the same room once again.
"Come on, lets go! Don't want to be late!"
Not here.
The door flew open, as though Snape knew the boy was standing there.
Its not as though he would ever reveal these new feelings he was having to the blonde wizard.
Ron's face turned from horror to amusement as he appeared to sympathize with his best friends plight.
His heart started to pound faster, though he suspected it had nothing to do with his role in the quidditch game.
Is that why he shot off like that?
"Oh dear." The professor mumbled, yet no aspect of his demeanor implied that he intended to help the boy correct his accident.
Until he was in front of everyone of course.
His new goal was to get close to Draco.
Though there was really only one he was interested in.
seeing it.
"Oh." Ron stopped, as though suddenly realising the error of his ways.
"S-sorry." Harry stuttered as he realised he had just assaulted a Hogwarts teacher.
He was thoroughly under prepared for this scenario as he straddled Draco's hips, his jaw hanging open. He knew he had to move, yet no part of his body was being cooperative.
As though taunted by that very thought, Harry's mind turned to last night, or more precisely to his final action before falling asleep.
For the first time in his quidditch life, he didn't care about winning.
It wasn't like him to be so distracted
Of all the places.
Snape stared down at him, as though there were something else he wished to say but decided against it.
Maybe.
He must have figured it out.
Did Potter suspect Malfoy of being a Death Eater? Is that why he wont take his eyes off of him?
Harry gasped, Ron had noticed his erection after all.
"Distracted Mr Potter?" Snape smirked, the vague essence of amusement dancing at the corners of his lips.
Harry dared to glace back, noticing what he had suspected, the blonde wizard stood frozen.
His suspicions had just been confirmed, thirteen times in fact as he watched Potter sneak yet another glance at none other than Draco Malfoy.
Harry sped up, until his broom was right next to Malfoy's.
"Could you thank Hermione for me."
"What did Professor Snape say to you at dinner?"
"So." Snape began, tapping his wand gently against the palm of his hand.
There was no way he was going to stand in front of everyone with his very obvious boner.
Then everyone would know.
He darted his eyes away from the boy under him as he began to panic, why he didn't just get off of the blonde was beyond him.
"But Harry!" Hermione whined as she strolled instinctively for the front of the class.
"That's a good point." Draco furrowed his eyebrows as he almost instantly sat up.
But it seemed to Harry as though there were another emotion at play also.
He was an agile flier, not a clumsy one.
The man who used to get a kick out of torturing him.
"What is it Goyle?" The blonde wizard spat, as though annoyed at the boy.
What on Earth was Potter trying to hide?
Harry couldn't ignore the scratching of Ron's quill as he scribbled onto the notebook, a huff of suppressed laughter escaping his lips as he pushed the notebook back.
Harry nodded, feeling as though he had no other choice as he followed the professor into his office.
Gods he hated this.
"I am going to show you how to brew a potion. This potion will aid to master the art that is occlumency."
Ordinarily he would have hit Draco back for shoving him, but ever since this stupid crush developed, he felt immobilized.
How long would it take before Draco became aware of the effect he was having?
Harry breathed a silent sigh of relief as he prayed that this meant Snape wouldn't be invading his mind tonight.
Harry glanced, yet the expression on Snape's face seemed more amused.
Thankfully, neither of them had far too fall as Draco hit the ground, soon followed by Harry.
Yet he seemed to remain unaware that he had mimicked the sound of throwing up out loud, inadvertently drawing the attention of the entire class.
It seemed as though they had just gotten there and Snape strode into the classroom, it also seemed as though his eyes were almost instantly upon Harry.
His mouth hung open, as though wishing to release a barrage of insults, yet something was holding him back.
Umbridge was so awfully useless that he actually found himself wanting Gilderoy Lockhart back, though he would prefer Remus or even Madeye.
Harry was unable to take his eyes off of Draco for the remainder of the lesson.
How could she have forgotten about it?
But it wasn't his love of potion making that got him out of bed this morning.
His current reaction wasn't exactly helping to disguise the truth.
Why does he even care about who Potter fancies?
This wasn't like him, what the hell was wrong with him?
Damn it.
Despite all of his resistance, it still wasn't enough as he felt Snape continue to rifle through his memories.
Harry couldn't ignore the pounding in his heart.
How was he kidding? Of course Ron had noticed, what else would have prompted that chuckle?
