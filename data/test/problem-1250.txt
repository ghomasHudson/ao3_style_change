Harry threw the cloak away, looking at Draco both confused and amused, “You want me to pose your corpse?”
Zabini sighed as they came into view, Parkinson’s arm looped with Draco and Zabini hiding his hands in his jacket.
A small chuckle escaped Draco, as though that was the last thing he ever expected to leave Harry’s lips, “Your scar?”
I don't know what else to warn about, but if you think I should add another trigger warning to this or any other chapter, please tell me.
While standing behind them, knowing that they were focused and getting out of here as fast as possible, Draco looked at his wrists.
Tom stood proudly at his theatrical revelation, while Harry ferociously stared back and forth between his wrists and the man in front of him.
I wanted to address how stupid it was that Harry, who already had a pretty traumatizing childhood, would then pursue a triggering career. I believe that dumb Harry would not seek the mental help he needs and Draco would pay the price. And... I hinted about it a few times before if you guys are interested in doing re-reads.
Harry smiled, “Hmm. You said you wouldn't rat them out, but then you told me Parkinson is just full of empty threats.”
Harry shrugged, “I imagine you will find it funny me dancing alone, because I’m not going with anyone else, regardless of what McGonnagall says.”
Harry sighed, why can’t he ever have a nice conversation with Draco without someone interrupting it or something going horribly wrong? Looks like this time he got a two for one deal. It sucked.
Side note: I wrote a story once where I made people leave a certain amount of comments before I posted the next chapter. A reader complained about it saying it was unfair and that I was holding the chapters hostage, etc etc. I stopped doing it. If you are that person, here's what I really wanted to say, and I want everyone to know that even like 2 years later I still feel this way:
It was when Harry arrived back to his bed and laid down that he realized he hadn’t worn his wrist wrap.
Harry sighed, internally whining as he dropped the warm afghan and shuffled into his boots, the cold outside making the space outside his bed too cold. His socks were not warm enough to warm the cold shoes and every step felt like a wake-up call. He tried to return a favor, going to Dean and pushing him properly on his bed and pulling the blanket on him before closing the curtain, and as he turned around he saw Seamus giving him a sleepy smile and a droopy thumbs up before dropping his arm and going back to sleep. He’d never noticed before Seamus and Dean slept with the curtains half open, at least the ones facing one another, so he turned back to Dean and opened his a bit before leaving the room.
Ron looked at her confused before turning to Harry to see if he knew, and Harry believed he knew why Hermione laughed. I mean, the way elder Malfoy was acting, it was almost like he wanted to Weasleys to really know that elder Malfoy was aggressively ignoring them. It was childish and petty.
To be honest, Harry had not planned this far away. He did not think Draco would allow him the question, so he never planned one. “...” Draco smiled, like he had expected Harry to blank out and be stupid, like he knew Harry had no question.
There were mixed reactions as half the school cheered for the handsome boy who stood up, both proud and amazed that he was chosen, and the other half glared at nothing with disappointment from not being chosen or losing a bet. Malfoy seemed to be feeling both at the same time.
Harry knew he said that too aggressively, he knew that Ron did not mean to anger him, he was just worried. He thought about apologizing, but then Ron pulled a piece of paper from his pocket, covered front and back with words Harry could not understand at this angle, and smiled at Harry, nodding in understanding. And then Harry decided, ‘fuck him’.
Harry could not promise him that. The future was so fickle and any small decision could change it so drastically.
Harry shook his head. Draco sighed, “Rowena Ravenclaw who was a Ravenclaw by marriage, had Edmund and Helena Ravenclaw, the latter who is currently the ghost of Ravenclaw-”
Hermione shrugged, taking the coins and passing them to Seamus, stating their bet, “Art takes time.”
Ron shrugged, ignoring Harry’s seething glare and turning back to pretend what Binns was saying was interesting, “He’s your…” Sigh, “Soulmate. At least we hope that, so have faith that at the end of the story, he’ll be by your side.”
In the silence that followed after Harry was too afraid to move, scared he would hurt Draco, unaware of where exactly Lucius hit him. It was an hour later when Draco began to shift around, uncomfortable, and no position he shifted himself to seemed to fix this. FInally after attempting to sleep on the floor with his head resting on Harry’s lap, he gave up and sat up. His eyes made it clear that while physically up, his mind was still trying to join him in the waking world.
Draco shook his head, “Nuh-uh Potter, I answered one question, is only fair you deliver the same. I didn’t come here to be interrogated.”
“But no one knows what happened. James and Lily Potter just died at the hands of You-Know-Who protecting their only son, who then proceeded to become the only person on earth to ever survive a killing curse. That’s what you’re known for. Surviving the impossible.”
Draco paused and then shrugged, “I don’t know, out of all the books I’ve read, the bible wasn’t one of them.”
Draco continued nodding until what Harry added sunk in, and then stared at Harry with wide-eyes, “What do you mean?”
He had a feeling Hermione was going to spend the rest of the year being worried if his on-growing obsession with Malfoy was any indicator.
Harry snickered, “You make it sound simpler than it is.” Harry grabbed the hand on his face, covering his wrist knowing- believing based on his dreams that Lucius name is the one he’s helping hide. Harry kissed his fingers, his thumb rubbing against the name, almost wishing he could rub it off, not just of his wrist, but his life. “You can trust me.”
Everyone turned to look and follow with their gaze the aggressive looking ‘professor’ stalking into the room, demanding attention. Everything he said sounded like a threat, every move he made, every sound, every look. And immediately Harry knew distraction had come in the form of a bulky, scary looking auror.
“A wise greedy man could fool a whole unknowing village into thinking he was god, or govern and take advantage of a nation.”
Harry didn’t even let a second pass, knowing that everyone would tell him that that was exactly what Malfoy was at any moment he ever tried to defend him, and having had an entire year to come up with replies for it, “Malfoy is a spoiled brat, who is about as reckless as you and I, and just like you is a product of his father’s making. I whole-heartedly believe this is not who Malfoy wanted to be, but who his father forced him to be, and if given a chance he would choose a different path.”
Again, Draco seemed impressed with the edge of a smirk, “And then you got the egg with that damn maneuver… The Slytherins think is wrong that you got first place when you cheated, clearly. Only wands.”
His heart did somersaults in his chest, and he tried to hold his smile but he couldn’t, so he turned it into a smirk as he turned around to face Malfoy.
Harry looked up and half his pride left him. He was a few inches too short to reach the jar, and if he attempted to do it by jumping, odds were that he would knock others down, and he really did not want a fight with Snape.
Draco paused and took one good look at Harry before asking credulously, “Did you ever read Hogwarts: A History?”
Apparently, Harry’s new thing was being jealous and possessive. But it stemmed from confusion. He had no idea where he stood with Malfoy, and until he knew he didn’t want anyone having a better position than him.
He heard Malfoy intake breath as so to speak, but he interrupted him, “Mrs. Figg was- is a great woman though. I loved sneaking off to her house when the Dursley’s left. She would always have snacks waiting for me, or would bake them on the spot when she saw me. The Dursley’s didn’t like that though, so they tried to limit the time I ever got to spend with her.”
Harry was quiet, realizing he didn’t know the answer properly, and that he was the one who prejudice.
It was a long, sad walk that would sometimes irk Harry when either Ron made up crap about Draco or Mr. Weasley talked ill of a child he knew nothing about. It was long, but he finally understood Ron and Draco and their hatred for each other. They didn’t really hate each other, not naturally at least. They were trained so by their father’s and their petty hatred for one another. And so both boys made it to Hogwarts with prejudices about each other’s family, planted in their heads by their fathers.
“Were there no rumours going around regarding Vol-” Harry stopped at Draco’s glare and nodded, “Regarding You-know-who’s search for my family as he hunted me down?”
Malfoy didn’t say anything, just stood there patiently, analyzing Harry with an air of superiority. Only his fidgeting fingers scratching at his trousers gave him away. He nodded, “Bad night?”
She shrugged and mouthed, ‘Explain it to me later.’ Harry grimaced, neither agreeing or rejecting to do it.
Harry only had a quick glance -to not make it obvious he was looking for him- at Malfoy to see that though he did have his cloak, but he wasn’t wearing it, if the redness on his nose, lips, and the tip of his fingertips were any evidence.
Harry wanted to go back to glaring at the board, because now that his mind was not occupied with anger and pain, his mind wanted to look at the source of it. See how he was doing. Was he staring at him? Was he thinking about him? Does he also want to join the Triwizard Tournament? Does he care for that stuff?
3. I... graduated. Or at least I finished university. My uni cancelled the graduation and refuses to acknowledge there are alternatives to celebrate the achievements of their graduating class. I'm not bitter. I'm empty. I need my closure and I'm never going to get it. Whatever. I now need to get a job and I might be moving to the USA by October, so that's my future excuse.
Harry thought back on Malfoy’s hidden wrists, and figured that his parents had shamed him into hiding his wrist for either:
Very shortly after they dropped the Malfoy subject, moving on to quidditch. Ron didn’t speak to him for the rest of the evening, only giving him a few passing looks here and there, clearly looking for a way to approach the subject, and not finding it. It bothered him, not because of his cowardice, but because Hermione was quickly growing irritated with the silence between them and Harry was scared of what would happen once the bottle tipped.
“What were you thinking about?” Harry whispered, his voice as smooth as the howling wind, his eyes as bright as the lighting in the sky, never leaving the departing boy in front of him. Draco ignored him, walking past him to the stairs, and Harry, disgruntled, grabbed his wrist, for the first time noticing… the sleeve is not long enough to cover them.
Harry thought about it. What would he commit a crime for? What would he metaphorically tarnish his soul for?
Draco gave a ghost of a smile, pulling his hands free and grasping for Voldemort’s name. His nails scratched the shape of each letter, and Harry felt for a second the same anger in Draco as he felt in himself about the unfairness of this situation, of who they were destined to fight. It wasn’t like with the average person where their enemy was just some guy who would attempt to make their life miserable or was simply the most incompatible person for them. No.
Regardless, that week prior to the Yule Ball was silent terror. Despite all the letters the boys, Ron, Harry and Draco, sent to their respective mothers -adoptive mums included-, neither woman was in a mood to dispute to the teenagers how their… conversations were going?
They enjoyed each other’s silent company until the silence went away as student’s began to pour out of the school for the welcoming of the foreign schools. Malfoy sighed and stood up, “At least I brought my robes knowing I was going to be here until the welcome.”
“Dean mentioned seeing Lucius leave the school after supper. Figured this would be what you were doing.” He shrugged, “And after I noticed midnight had passed and you’ve yet to come back or move from this spot, I figured you had fallen asleep again and would need a watchdog.”
Harry smiled and went inside a stall, taking care of business and changing clothes. He was sitting on the loo, tying his shoes when Ron whispered, clearly leaning on the door, “Hermione came down at five. . . I checked the marauders’ map before that… I came down before that.”
Harry was silently baffled. Ron was shaking his head in shame. But it took Hermione’s scoff for Ginny to burst out laughing and exclaim in unadulterated joy, “I fucking love school!”
But they looked sorta good. . . Harry was still getting used to the accumulating heat on his wrists.
Harry shook his head, “You’re right. None of my business.” Harry knew he had gone too hard to back off now, but Harry had been harmed by his uncle when he was small. Harry knew how humiliating it could feel to admit that someone who you’re trying to make love you and that you love, maybe unconditionally, hurt you in ways they shouldn’t. It was not a matter of pride. It’s a matter of hope. Hope that they would change. And you don’t want them in jail when they do. Draco was not going to admit to his father hitting him.
Malfoy was in his room. Now he regretted dumping Ron and Hermione. But his pride didn’t allow him to go back in. So he waited outside, pulling them aside immediately when he saw them, “Was Lefty in class today?”
Malfoy huffed, moving towards the base of the stairs, where Harry would land in a minute when the stairs finally made it back to him. “
“Are you finally going to kill me? Make it quick, and please leave my body in a flattering position.”
It sounded like Dean tried to slam the door but the visitor stopped him, muttering something before Dean groaned and then closed the door. Shuffling footsteps and then his curtain was pulled, revealing a very annoyed Dean, “Someone is looking for you outside of the Gryffindor Tower, the Fat Lady is annoyed. Go.”
On the walk in the forest, on their way to some form of magical transportation, Ron, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Diggory kept on ranting about how despicable the entire Malfoy family is.
Harry bit his lips before standing up and leaving the stall, noticing Ron kept looking at the restroom entrance to make sure no one entered, “I’m on his left wrist.”
Draco shook his head and went back to his arrogant silence. And true to his arrogance, Draco did not utter a single word until midnight came. Harry didn’t mind. He enjoyed that half hour of panicking by his side.
And that seemed to be the status for everything around here, and the students kept getting more and more antsy, waiting for the goblet to finally tell them who would be their champion. Finally Dumbledore stood up.
“Isn’t Malfoy in that class?” Harry asked distractedly, starting to walk towards class. When he didn’t hear a response, or felt them walking with him, he turned around to find the duo glaring at him, arms crossed, looking like the stern parents he sometimes ached for. He kind of liked it right now.
Harry sighed, looking around for the nearest desk and settling on top of it, “Can I ask a question?”
Harry wondered if there was a word to describe that very… relatable feeling. Because it was one that hunted him as well as he filled the empty silence with talks about his average dancing skills, the rumors with Ginny and just… anything that he’d seen or noticed this past few days. Neither boy should be talking, they both realized. Their worry was too much to enjoy the company of each other or the pleasures of conversations or… snogging.
Moody gave Malfoy a knowing look and didn’t bother keeping it a secret why, wanting the entire class to know that he could hold the slytherin house on a leash with all the dirt he had on them.
Harry turned to look at Ron as he tried to hold in a gasp, then turned to look at where Ron was looking to see Malfoy enter with a group of Slytherins. And for a second, Harry wondered if he would dare.
“I know this is invasive, and I know this will make you angry, but was he right?” Harry joked to himself that nothing made him more gryffindor ‘recklessly brave’ than poking the snake in front of him.
Harry leaned in, wanting to share with Draco as much vulnerability as Draco has shared with him, “You know what’s worse than going to Azkaban for twelve years even though you’re innocent?”
Hermione looked ready to straight up sue the school, piling on them how illegal this was and how they should not let Harry compete.
These people were toxic. Lucius was a threat to the wellbeing of Draco. Riddle was a threat to everybody. And Harry was destined to end that. Soul markings; one hell of a curse…
Returning to the castle the Gryffindors forgave him, due to his win, Harry’s not stupid. He had the fastest time and an original method, landing him in the first place, and the Gryffindors had to rub it all over everyone’s faces. After opening the egg, freaking out with everyone about the noise, and joking with Hermione and Ron for a few minutes about it giving him nightmare fuel, while Ron agreed, Harry left. He needed silence.
Ron sat down, hands drooping between his knees, head hanging with signs of tiredness, “What’s on your mind?”
“How many nights of sleep had you lost up to that point?” Ron was genuinely curious and Harry knew why, Ron had idea up to the knock-out that Harry had a problem and he felt guilty for not picking up on it.
Walking out and getting hit with the cold air Harry shivered. Ron scuffed, “But he’s the one who’s running away from Harry!”
Draco stared at Harry for a good two minutes, like he was going to figure him out if he stared at him enough, eventually giving up and leaving without a word.
Ron smiled, “You like that h-” Harry glared at Ron as he was about to say ‘he’, “Lefty, err, you like that Lefty trusts you?”
Harry turned around, flanked on either side by Ron and Hermione who looked confused to hear Draco calling him out after all but running away from him for the past week.
Harry was almost gone from Malfoy’s sight when he yelled, not aggressively, purely confused, “Did you do it?”
I could spend some time re-reading and re-writing this chapter, and remove the self-insert from it. But I feel is stupid Harry barely ever reacted to things like a normal teenager. Harry has plenty of excuses and reasons for him to have various mental illnesses, including Stockholm Syndrome, anxiety, among others.
Harry had nothing most of his life and the only thing keeping his faith in place was the knowledge that there was someone out there who belonged only to him. And he can’t do shit about it.
He entered the storage room, eyes focused on the paper, trying to memorize it all temporarily for easy finding. Between waiting for other groups to get their ingredients and getting help from other students in terms of how much he should grab, he didn’t really notice who was in the room. Dried Nettles. Harry now needed Dried Nettles and he was set. Dried- Fuck.
“How the hell am I supposed to rescue something from it? Moody says use my broom, but for what? Do a few laps around the stadium and show off to the audience that the dragon knows how to fly better than I do when it knocks me down and kills me?”
Draco sighed, looking at his shoes for a second before climbing on to the desk in front of Harry, “What?”
A faint snicker escaped Draco as he heard the full on distaste in Harry’s voice as he succumbed to his unfortunate fate. Harry groaned, squating down with Draco’s hand on his left and his right gripping the banister as he banged his head against the rail, “Fuck man, it was hard getting you to come with me and now I have to find another one? One was hard enough,” He stood up quickly, turning to Draco with beg in his eyes, “Please just-”
Harry and Malfoy stared at each other for a few minutes before Harry gave up, assuming that to be the end of the conversation, and going back to his hunt for caffeine. He liked Malfoy, but with zero hours of sleep all Harry wanted to do were bad decisions. A few of them involved a bit of sexual assault on the blond from Harry, others involved Harry’s fist on Malfoy’s cheek. And Harry was too tired to try and understand those mixed feelings.
By the time Hagrid’s class came along Harry had given Draco enough sideway glances and barely-there smiles that his roommates had noticed. And when Dean asked Harry if there was something up with Draco, and Seamus asked him if they had or were going to fight, Harry wanted to let Draco actually beat him up. If his roommates noticed, others are bound to have noticed which could lead to Lucius having questions. And that… not good.
He was tired of being the biggest man in town, the hero, the warrior. For maybe an hour all he wanted to be was a teenage boy in the arms of his soulmate sharing a kiss that stole all rhyme or reason from Harry’s head.
Harry bit his lips, raising his eyebrows at them, “Alright, I’m leaving tonight with more questions than answers. Thanks!”
It was hours later when Hermione came to check on him, and he wished he had remained ignorant and that she had taken Ron’s approach.
The redhead nodded, passing the note to Hermione, “Anyone we maybe know with this penmanship?” Hermione shook her head, “I don’t exactly pay attention to that.”
And the ice filled his veins as he turned back to Dumbledore and finally understood what was going on. What a fool was he to think he could just one year. Ron pulled up, “Go.”
. He had no idea if Draco got it or not, his response fitting either situation, “Control your pests Potter! Lest you want me to tell my father!”
They were walking up the stairs to get to the minister’s box when Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm, holding him back from the group by a few steps. When Harry looked at her he noticed Hermione had Ron held back on her other side. She wasn’t looking at either of them, just glaring straight ahead.
“Muggles are bad, and they are proof of it. Muggles aren’t bad. Some are bad, some are good. Like wizards and witches.”
Draco shook his head, “That’s the easily digestible and very neatly cleaned up version of it. A lot of the history was removed. This castle belonged to the prestigious house of Ravenclaw before she agreed to turn it into a school with her three good friends.” Harry looked up at the statue of a little girl with a basket of flowers, long flowing hair and a circlet of sort on her head, Draco motioned to her, “Helena Ravenclaw. The only heiress to the Ravenclaw name and the castle. Each statue of a young girl in this castle is of every Ravenclaw woman that came before her. It was a rite of passage.”
After a far too long and uncomfortable silence, Hermione sighed, realizing he was not backing down until someone told him, and placed a soft hand on top of Harry’s, “The Killing Curse.”
He put a lot of emphasis on the word ball, but Harry just shrugged reaching for his hands again, “This but in front of everyone.”
“Read between the lines, Harry!” Hermione was geniunely wondering if they were playing dumb so she would get the pleasure of explaining it to them. It was quickly becoming less of a pleasure. “We’ve been wondering if Lefty has you as well and what that would mean, good or bad. I think from this we can assume he does. I still don’t know if its good or not, but Malfoy senior would rather keep you two separated than figure it out… Unless he knows.”
Harry searched in his bag to see if he had any spellotape, exclaiming internally when he found some in Rob’s bag, using it to tape the lavender to the ceiling of his bed, throwing the tape away and cuddling the warm blanket on a night that seemed to only get colder.
He turned to look around and ask another student for help when he saw someone in the corner of his eyes shoving their open palm towards him, “Dried Nettles.”
Harry gave a tight smile and walked away with a bag full of clothes and books and a heart heavy with worry. Ron is less guided by emotions. Ron controls himself more and will not let worry freak him out. He trusts Hermione, but not with this.
Malfoy tried to remain indifferent, but the way his chest took more air than needed at Harry’s word let him know that comments like that seemed to make him uncomfortable. He didn’t say anything.
Walking into that classroom and seeing that person you love broken and wondering over and over again if staying away was the right choice… sucks.
“What flowers do you want on your corpse, because you’re getting me there!” Harry would never hurt Draco, but he really wanted Draco to stop being so dry and sassy. At least for a moment.
Harry smiled. And he would never admit it to anyone, but that note would remain hidden under his pillow. Just like how he would never tell anyone where he got the afghan from, not for any reasons of shame, but for the sake of keeping himself on Malfoy’s good side.
Dean didn’t add anything more before dropping the curtain and shuffling back to his bed, dropping on it like a log.
It took two hours and two fights between Ron and Ginny about whether they should go back or not when finally Mr. Weasley arrived to pick them up. It took twenty more minutes before Harry realized he was wand-less. Mr. Weasley prohibited them from searching for it, sending Harry home with the rest of the Weasleys too early and without a say in the matter. It was hours later when Arthur arrived with his wand and a tired looking expression.
Harry was doing everything possible to not blame himself for this. That wasn’t his fault, and neither was it Draco’s. Now repeat that a few billion times and maybe both will start believing it.
Ron nodded, “I’ll try and see if I can convince her to come to Hogsmead. We can explain in person, better than a letter”
“You-know-who died. My father forbade me from leaving the manor until I was disciplined enough to not pull on my sleeves and show people I wore the name of You-know-who’s ‘killer’ on my wrist. It meant different things depending on who saw it. Some of ‘Daddy’s’ friends would see it as treason. Like he sees it. Some of his friends would see it as what my mother kept trying to convince my father it was.”
But it was affecting Zabini, and Parkison seemed annoyed by it. Malfoy, on the other hand, thought it was funny, as he helped his friend as well.
Harry nodded, pulling it from his trousers and handing it to Ron. Even now he wished it was more burnt.
Harry rolled his eyes, delicately picking at what parts of the story he could tell Ginny so she could have some context, but not so much that Draco would be angry with him.
He turned around, not waiting for their replies, wanting to believe deep in his heart that he could focus on something else other than the highlighted matter.
He knew Dean and Seamus accepted it with no question when both realized that they had each other on their wrists. They are now the best of friends and are appropriately growing into something more. That both had some pureblood family names in their opposite wrists that were once suspected of being Death Eaters.
McClaggan stood up, seeming like he was looking for a fight, “What? Scheming other ways to cheat your way into this tournament?”
Hermione ignored everyone screaming at her and hid in Ron’s bed, Ron closing the curtain with her inside and turning to Harry, “We are talking about this.” He warned under his breath and Harry shrugged.
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about Thomas. I…I wasn’t sure how you would react. He’s an orphan, you know. And…well, we all know what happened to the last powerful Slytherin who was left isolated in an orphanage.” He told his father in a low voice.
“Another boy! This tall, black hair, he had a wand and said he’d adopted Scorp as his brother and we couldn’t be his brothers anymore!”
! Now, no protests this time, I won’t have you wasting away after an ordeal like that. Magical displays like that take a lot out of you, young man. You’re coming straight to my kitchen to eat a proper meal.” She scolded him, somehow grabbing Ron’s ear instead of Draco’s to make her point.
It was their Daddy’s favorite saying, one that always made their Papa roll his eyes and then smile and usually agree with whatever Daddy was arguing about.
That was it, Draco was not going to sit here and be treated like some harmless infant dog. He drew himself up, pulling his dignity around him like a cloak.
“It would have taken longer, and in pieces. And Dumbledore would have interfered, made sure you didn’t get some of the more powerful heirlooms.” Draco told her.
The Great Hall was, as usual, intolerably noisy. The Ravenclaws that weren’t reading were having spirited debates, some individuals carrying on complex conversations with two or three adversaries, and managing to eat as well. The Gryffindors seemed torn between raucous laughter, loud bragging, and outrageous expostulating on the great battle against the Forces of Evil. And the Hufflepuffs…Draco turned his eyes away from that particular table, feeling his face go pale. Today the Hufflepuffs were all…cooing at each other. Like a gigantic orgy, only without the sex.
a Black after all. You’ve seen my mother. And highly intelligent. And she’s even from a similar upbringing to your own, I’m sure you’ll have quite a lot in common. What do you say?” Draco said briskly.
Tom wasn’t sure what to think of it. Apparently his new little brother, ‘Scorpius’, already had a family in place. They were clearly wizards, and that was quite literal – somehow
Then, a series of portraits popped up, like countless spots, replaying important memories…the moments that best defined the sources of Potter’s strength.
“Not just the Gnossic. That’s one of several. But yes, some humans can control the passage of several kinds of emissions from and through their body. It seems to be genetic, although it also appears randomly for some reason. And it leads to an extremely diverse set of abilities, once an individual learns to focus it. I’m not entirely convinced your math can actually explain all of it, but there are people I respect, intellectually who insist that magic is entirely a function of this ability.”
.” Draco corrected him, rising from his seat. “I think I’ve given you enough information to allow that, if you’re clever enough to extrapolate.”
“I’m so glad Fred and George were right! I was so upset that I wouldn’t be able to make a sweater for Harry’s love, and it turns out I was working on one the whole time!” Molly Weasley said happily while enthusiastically suffocating Draco by pressing his face into her ample bosom.
“He’s the Heir of Slytherin. Not liking sex is not an excuse for failing to produce a blooded Heir.”
It was, in fact a dump. And yes, hand-me-down clothes were clearly visible. The grandfather clock with the hands for each family member…including Harry, Draco noticed…was likely once a lovely piece but had not aged well. The tracking spell indicating the location of the family members looked like an interesting application of some of the more extreme familial magical spells but nothing terribly powerful.
“I never said I did. However as the new Lord Malfoy I have important strategic decisions to make for the Family. And it looks to me like something is going on with a…as much as I despise you…a key figure in the war. So, out with it Potter. Who’s been working you over all summer?”
There it was, the girl’s face betrayed just the slightest flicker of annoyance. Clearly he’d tangled her nets with his interference. Slytherin after all.
“So what’s it like living with them? We hear all sorts of stories. Do they really duel over breakfast and then start doing sex stuff right in the middle of the fight?”
“Exactly. But today you actually look quite respectable. I’m shocked to find out you are actually quite capable of dressing yourself. Perhaps you’d find yourself ready to handle some of the more important family business this evening?” Draco asked politely.
Neatly, he twisted it around the tip of his wand, four, five, six times and held the end in place with his finger. A red ribbon made of pure Acromantula Silk, dyed in Draco’s own blood – tied in a precise Targeting knot around the looped hair. Draco took the remaining ends of ribbon and added a Defensive knot, and a Transfer knot, ending with a large knobby cluster of red silk on the end of his wand.
Draco found himself blushing painfully as he realized this was his opportunity to reassure Potter about their eventual ceremony.
He moved on into the parlour and came stock still as amber eyes regarded him curiously from the doorway.
“Fine. See about making the other two boltholes operational. And begin transferring the more important heirlooms to the operational one. I’ll make sure the bulk of our assets are placed in the long-term protective vaults at Gringotts, as well.”
“Did he now? Hmm, no he’s not pleased then. Perhaps he’s finally realized he’s out of options.” Draco said just loud enough to reach only Blaise’s ears.
“Invisibility cloak. Tent-frame.” Draco said tersely, transfiguring the string into a roughly rectangular structure that would sit very low to the ground. Just enough room for two people to sit in, legs folded.
Lucius wiped his mouth and stared up at his new Muggle friend for a long moment. Something was very wrong. Something bad was happening, or about to happen. Lucius stared down at the irritated skin and shuddered. He needed counsel...and there was one person the wizarding world he knew he could trust with this.
“He is nearly as powerful as the Headmaster, so it’s likely he can do at least some magic without a wand. I haven’t seen him demonstrate the ability, however.” Severus told him. “Now are you going to tell me what this is about or will I have to use Legilmency?”
Draco looked at the list. He was ranked rather lower than he’d expected, on the overall list of enemies.
“Harsh, man.” Lysander didn’t take back his, or her, hand – instead it moved to rest comfortably on Regulus’ foot, picking absently at his laces as they talked. “Look, I know the score, right? People who get born alone just don’t get it. Especially that bloody Hat. It really sucks, and, like, no warning, right? Just, bam! And you’re on your own, and they all think it’s the best thing for you. Like, they genuinely believe it. No clue, man. None at all.”
Potter had taken out his wand, and was poking it carefully underneath the edge of the invisibility cloak, pointing it at the door.
Lucius Malfoy forced himself to breathe deeply and relax as the crowd of Muggles jostled him from every direction. He had never felt so out of place, and it wasn’t due to his magical status…he was dressed in the same pressed slacks and crisp white oxford shirt that everyone else wore – he knew he appeared as non-magical as they come. And he was also aware, from the smooth enunciations and modulated tones of those around him that he was surrounded by fellow representatives of wealthy and powerful families.
, his green eyes filling Draco’s vision and his hand slipping behind his neck and there wasn’t any lust because it didn’t burn when Harry’s soft lips brushed against his own and then pressed against him like purest warmest silk that made something painful and needy turn over inside his chest and he dared not move for fear Harry might stop kissing him…
Harry looked rumpled and just-dragged-out-of-bed, as always, and Draco felt the sudden urge to pin the Gryffindor down long enough to see what a few neatening charms would do to his appearance. He offered the green-eyed boy a small scowl and received a grin in reply.
“The stone will keep your phoenix from entering the office, and wand-magic is useless inside this room. With the door magically locked, you’ll be in here until the portkey activates – and then it will be far too late for you to intervene.”
“Arthur,” Draco nearly choked with surprise as the man’s first name rolled off his tongue. Of course. The spell would force them to use each other’s first names except in formal ceremonies. “you
“Draco, what was that all about? She’s been very nice to me, you know. And she had a special potion that kept you from scarring from that curse.” Harry protested.
Whoever had come up with the name for the collection could be tortured later for their insolence, Draco decided. Preferably before the actual marriage, as he supposed his future husband would probably make the cessation of such behavior one of the conditions of the contract.
“You are wisssse for one with your ssssad misfortune of being born with only a ssssingle head. Much like the Masssster Jamessss and hissss nestling. Perhapssss between the three of you, a proper ssssnake could be made.”
group here, so please mind yourselves carefully for the time-being. Our programme of study includes a great deal of highly advanced and in some cases top-secret, ah,
“Well that’s the weird thing, from the prospectus it’s pretty clear the course is Applied Quantum Mechanics but they insist on calling it Advanced Arithmancy.
James Remus Potter-Malfoy peeked around the corner, his balled fist held up next to his shoulder in a signal he’d learned from his godmother’s television.
They all gasped at the demonstration and quickly averted their eyes, turning themselves to resume forced casual conversations that failed to conceal their continued intense awareness of his presence.
Draco drew back a bit at her sudden hostility. Blacks were known to tend towards mental instability, though Jamie was a bit young to be manifesting
Harry sat down shakily, his hand sweeping the fine white silk of the tablecloth out of the way as he pushed his legs under the table. He seemed to freeze momentarily as his limbs met Draco’s beneath the table, and Draco gave him a small smile as he moved his legs to tangle slightly with the Gryffindors.
“I’ve done my best to help you make a well-considered decision. The Dark Lord doesn’t need recruits who don’t realize what they’re-”
“The heirloom needs to be appropriately ancient, but not Dark, obviously. I’m thinking perhaps the Crystal Sceptre for that. Given Potter’s situation
The magic was surging and Draco could feel that Potter, already, was nearly on the edge of an orgasm. He backed off quickly.
Jonas’ hand was on his wrist, and Lucius stilled. It wasn’t uncomfortable, in fact the gesture felt kind, but he was suddenly dimly aware that this act, this physical contact with a muggle, of his very own magically imbued flesh being touched and warmed by the skin of a mundane, was in the context of his entire life a momentous milestone. Particular in the fact that, now the deed was done, he found himself entirely unaffected by a change of his status that his younger self would have viewed with such grim horror.
Harry stroked the surface of the liquid with his wand – tap, tap, tap. He turned to look at the boys.
“We don’t discuss it directly, that isn’t our way. I’ve given them as much information to make the right choice as I can without betraying our own interests.”
Draco nodded and turned to the table, taking one of the glasses in his hand. Harry cast an inquiring look at the concoctions on the table and Draco hastened to explain.
, the rule had been, love for family, and only for the family, and never presume on a bond that has not yet been set in magic.
“Now, young Lord Malfoy. Ssssince you do not ssseee fit to asssk my absssence from your family land, do you then intend to make a similar giffft?”
And of course, that had been very wrong. The sexual energy in those encounters had been a mere token, a tingling of magic that enhanced the physical sensations but was only a detail of the play. Those, of course, had all been purebloods, and none had been Founders Heirs, and certainly none had had anywhere near the inherent power that Harry Potter had swimming in his magical core.
Potter blinked. Opened his mouth to answer…and then snapped it shut, that angry look flaring up again.
Ah yes. Tipsy had been called directly from her rooms, where no doubt his mother had been reorganizing her jewelry or taking a bath or having tea or some such nonsense.
Harry Potter, who had been watching this byplay rather helplessly was suddenly looming large, the air crackling with his magic.
Draco ground down the pain that rose up hearing him so listless, forcing himself to savor his victory.
Harry saw that his husband was right. After several moments of horrified silence, James had started to interact with his new housemates. As he watched, Harry saw his son laugh with a group of boys his own age, though not as long or hard as the others.
“There are…other things I can’t give you. I can promise them to you in the future, after…you know…after. But not until then. And I know from what I’ve read you’ll probably expect them before you’d agree to marry me.”
Draco found himself smirking as Harry finally fell forward almost flat on his face, rolling immediately to his side and that long, long body wriggling like an eel as inch after inch after inch of flesh was exposed, the trousers and pants working their way down his legs until Harry was deliciously nude and on his feet, dashing towards the crystal wading pool.
“Ah, but I’m not here to do what’s best for Regulus just now. What’s best for you is to be placed where your best qualities will be encouraged. And for you, that has to be HUFFLEPUFF!”
“We have to, Potter. We’ve gone too far, we have to pull back. We have been acting as if we were married in private, and it
Draco hesitantly smoothed the fabric of Harry’s sleeve, wishing he dared caress his face at this point.
I WON’T HAVE ANY MORE OF THIS SECRECY FROM YOU, DO YOU HEAR ME? YOU WILL BRING THIS SUITOR OF YOURS FOR DINNER AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOUR FAMILY PROPERLY, AS YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE AFTER RECEIVING AN HEIRLOOM FROM THEM!
Draco beckoned to the two figures hovering outside the doorway to his father’s office. They stepped forward and spoke their phrases.
The mediwitch cast another charm and the yellow glow merged into his stomach and separated before his eyes, the color flickering until they solidified. Two spots of blue glowed inside his flat stomach.
Draco thought back to that night under the invisibility cloak. The burning magic that had sliced through him with every physical contact with the boy. Only the small taste of excess magic, the traces of Potter’s desire for him.
“Sit down, Harry. The last Horcrux was not something that we could destroy. At least, not without breaking the prophecy.”
“I’m glad to hear you’ve preserved the fruits of my labors, Draco. Narcissa would not tell me whether you had been to see Our Lord in my absence.”
Draco smiled his coldest smile, concentrating on the impenetrable wall of a glacier he’d seen on vacation two summers ago.
Draco smirked, and reached down to open the small drawer to one side of the desk. He pulled out a narrow box of dark wood and placed it on the desk between them.
“We thought we had destroyed him entirely. The Dark Lord was conceived out of rape, and later embraced the hatred that act founded. He could not co-exist with love, and was destroyed by that brand of magic.” Draco finished.
to distract you! Now let go of me!” Draco was trying to pull out of the dive but Potter was holding him fast.
Arthur chuckled again. Draco was surprised to realize the man had a rather pleasant laugh. Was that the spell doing that?
Blaise nodded, knowing the Malfoy family history in France. The importance of allying oneself with the winning side was drilled into every pureblooded child.
“You can’t use a pseudonym in a magical place like Hogwarts, the secret will be out very quickly. Too many spells react to lineage.” Draco interrupted. “But that shouldn’t be a problem. Thomas has a magically enforceable claim to quite a few family names, especially after we’ve officially adopted him. The pressing question is his tie to Scorpius.”
“Dating…” Draco muttered. As in, going out to Hogsmeade, and holding hands in the halls, kissing at dinner and disappearing into semi-public alcoves for frantic make-out sessions.
Harry Potter, powerful as he was, would fall before this wizard. Fall, and bring Draco down with him, since Draco had allowed himself to become so attached.
“Tom can’t use spells with the wand that came with his soul, and the Dark Lord’s wand won’t recognize his magic. I tried to unite them with the Reflection spell but they acted like they weren’t the same wand.” Harry told the wandmaker.
“You know I would never endanger my son. Dumbledore, and Granger have been involved, and I don’t have to tell you that Harry and I are quite competent ourselves.”
Draco was suddenly seized with panic, pure fear that Harry had discovered his scheming and was now ending it, ending everything here and now. He seized Harry’s chin in his fingers and turned his face towards him.
There was a long silence, which Potter broke to summon a rather familiar-looking house-elf to bring them popcorn of all things – a wizarding tradition that seemed rather out of place in their current circumstances. Draco held his silence, refusing the offer to partake in the autumn delicacy but leaving Potter to his eccentricities.
“Your father and I spent a long time deciding whether or not to tell you this. We thought you might be too young, too immature, to handle it. And I was worried that you might treat Tommy differently, that you might not understand the difference between this Tommy and the one who became evil.
, could you tear yourself away from the philosophy lecture to get the door?” Harry’s exasperated voice interrupted the lesson.
Was it when Draco offered to turn Harry to the Dark? When he said he’d make Harry use an Unforgivable on him?
“So he can tell you about your father.” Draco told her. “And it’s family business. I’ll get you permission to go.”
“Well you know dragonsblood naturally raises the temperature of anything it touches, especially if it has no room to expand. Glumbumble when heated forms a rather strong crystalline solid that expands rapidly as it soaks in heat, attaching itself to the nearest solid anchor. So, when the two are unleashed inside a closed container, such as a
“Well, if you’re not willing to prove otherwise, I think I’ll take my chances with my consultants, then.” Draco sniffed. “I’ll be sending our fleet of ships to your Alexandria wharf location by tomorrow at dawn. I
Tom pursed his lips smugly. Spying on the famously crafty Draco Malfoy was the sort of feat that would be sure to be just the right kind of mind-boggling to an eleven year old boy raised by Daphne Greengrass and her secret muggle lover who had impregnated her in the middle of the war. This was a boy who Draco had promised would have been raised in the shadow of their relieved gratefulness to his cunning. That year had not been kind to the nerves of those caught between their parents and a madman intent upon them as expected recruits and breeding mares upon their swiftly approaching birth dates. As Scorpius was far too young to invoke the kinds of devotion that kind of debts could create between great houses, it fell to Tom as his bondmate to seize the reigns of House Greengrass’ allegiance. Such things were always an important resource that a great house must marshal well or lose, as Lucius and Draco had between them lost the hold his grandfather had established over Houses Goyle and Crabbe.
“Besides. I could smell you on him when he came home. I wasn’t sure if it was a fistfight or snogging, but the pheremones the two of you put out around each other when I taught Defense had me seriously considering the latter.”
“This is a Malfoy family bolthole, and tied by blood to each of us going back generations upon generations. It is magically impossible to sell or give it away. My father gifted you with the full measure that he had ownership of – control of the property during his Lordship.”
Harry just stared blankly at him for a moment before horrified comprehension dawned across his face.
“My Lord, your knowledge in other branches of magic is unmatched, I had not known any instruction was necessary.”
Draco kept his wand pointed at the water, his magical energy feeding the localized maelstrom that was forming around Potter’s straining member, leaving barely a ripple on the surface of the water.
“There are plenty of wards to alert us if he needs anything. And the house elves are very capable.” Draco assured him.
And then Draco saw him over Potter’s shoulder. The Dark Lord, approaching, stepping over Bellatrix as if she wasn’t there.
“We’ll wait for them to spread out, one to each bed. But thee three beds, on this end, will all be decoys. Because we’re going to be in the fort, that we’re going to build.”
“When the wands connect, Harry, you need to relax. Tom, there will be a bead of light, you need to concentrate on pushing that bead with your magic until it hits your wand in Harry’s hand. Understood?”
their first rite of passage, Harry. It’s good that they are so close, now they have to learn their separate strengths.”
“Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Potter! I am shocked at your behavior!” Professor Snape stormed up and grabbed Potter by the collar.
“I never said I was nice. Only powerful. Which means you should most certainly do as I say. Now, how has young Lord Malfoy been educating you on the Noble Struggle?”
“Indeed, and evolved with power beyond a point where such intercourse is possible or desireable, my Lord. But such is not the case for your budding heir. I would have the Malfoy line be the first to benefit from the fruits of your heritage, my Lord. And so I would become your son-in-law, by the bindings of magic.”
“To some extent. Those last few seconds were something similar to a bonding. But it was off-center because we were separated and it was in only one-direction.
The man was a disgrace to his house and knew it, a failure in all but the upbringing of his son – who had brilliantly rescued the Malfoy name and fortune from his own horrible miscalculations and then maneuvered the family into unprecedented prestige.
One smooth cut across the jugular vein, dark-magic-transformed blood, a sick black fluid, shooting out in an obscene geyser, and it was done.
“Of course, before my ancestor acquired it, the Sceptre was originally created to lift curses by absorbing their magical energy. According to legend, in the hands of an
Tom sighed, took out his wand and, with a few quick spells, completed the transfer the boy had once again forgotten he should be working on. The boy would need training into his role. Awe was a good foundation, but it must not choke out his competence or he’d be useless. Draco’s own father had made that mistake, leaving Goyle and Crabbe Jr., reduced to near automatons. Inter-Familial debt bonds could be tricky like that.
side, they are grossly out of line. If you feel the need to speak with someone about it, ask one of your Prefects to arrange for you to meet with you. My father was the Dark Lord’s chief lieutenant. I know what pressure is.”
That would not do. Fortunately, Draco knew exactly how to set it right. There was really only one currency in Slytherin alliances.
All the time, moving ever farther into the thick of things. Draco guided them towards where he knew the Dark Lord would be, leaving a trail of wounded and dying Death Eaters in their wake.
Hmm, the spells appeared to have frayed. His hair was still shiny and beautiful, of course, good genes don’t need magic to keep working. But the hairs were…
And it certainly wouldn’t do to have the Minister of Magic poking his wand in where it didn’t belong. That would not do at all.
Draco walked into the dining room and found it deserted. A rattling in the kitchen told him Molly Weasley was about, but he wasn’t quite ready to face her and her arsenal of tasteful time-bombs.
Draco reached a hand into his pocket and allowed his fingers to curl around the spine of the book he’d taken from the Black library.
His eyes, trained intently on the top of Potter’s head, and the curve of his jaw that he could see, and the delicious curve of his neck and just part of one shoulder…watching for any tension, any reaction.
James looked around the dorm room, waiting for inspiration. The Hufflepuff boys dorm was a semi-circle, with the beds arranged like spokes on half a wheel, their heads all facing the window where moonlight streamed in. He imagined the scenario he’d envisioned…and of course that’s how it would be, what else would the older boys do – spoil their own surprise attack by knocking the door in and shouting “Chaaaarge!”?
Draco lost hold of his broom, and tucked himself into a ball just before slamming into the pitch, tumbling over a ground that felt like a stone staircase.
Clearly the Marauders were planning some mischief tonight. Let her keep their silly secrets, then. As long as she revealed the important ones.
“She’s faxing your supplies list right now.” He informed his father, just as the phone gave a warning flash, and Draco deftly caught the rolled-up parchment that had been apparated right in front of him.
“How vvvery interesssting that none of you hasss chossseen to enlighten me of thissss, Luccciussss.” The Dark Lord said.
Draco considered his mother. She was right. Well, partially right. The wooing she had witnessed was the most recent one, involving both of Potter’s parents. It would form a basic map of explanations. But Potter’s Muggle upbringing would likely be somewhat different from what his parents would have provided.
Ron brandished his wand and started vigorously defending his de-facto girlfriend’s honor with a string of epithets. Some of them in Egyptian and Russian, Draco noticed, impressed. Clearly his older brothers had been teaching him something.
have a point. Stupid Blacks only having two children at a time…but that’s a lot of magic to just sit around going even worse than it is.” Weasley said.
Molly Weasley placed the spoon carefully back in the pot, and with a twirl of her wand, set it to stirring. Draco found his eyes tracking every movement…then staying with the spoon as it went around, and around, and around…delicious steam coming up…
“Wow, look at you boys! Every time I turn my back, you grow so much I can barely recognize you!” she smiled at them to let  them know she was joking and gave them another hug.
Harry’s arms crept around his neck and Draco allowed a true smile to spread across his face as he carried his love across the threshold.
“Um. He probably thought I wouldn’t know the variation of the shield charm to handle them both at once without tying up my wand?”
“Oh yes, indeed they would! Yes, Lord Malfoy! We will send one of our curse-breakers to look at your wards, and you will see him penetrate them ever so easily! Gringotts wards are the only truly safe protections for your riches, Lord Malfoy!” the creature assured him.
! Do not speak of those butcher in my house! Dentists are some of the very worst Muggle travesties of so-called medical expertise in existence!”
“The magical community. Wizards. Witches. Magical creatures. I’ve lived my entire life in terror of what is happening here today. Of what happens after. The fear. The jealousy. The human experiments. The stake. I hope to Merlin my son is right and your people are ready for this.”
They were also both masters of their expressions since toddlerhood. There was no revelation in Blaise’s brown eyes, and Draco was sure his own face gave away nothing.
And if Draco was going to consider changing sides, he wanted to be sure his current animosity with that blazing light was turned into something much more amicable first. A marriage relation sounded like an excellent start on that project.
Harry seemed to understand that, and went for his own discarded clothes, rubbing his arms with his hands to warm them.
“I’ll say this once, and only once. The Dark Lord does not mark anyone until they come of age. In Wizarding Britain, that’s 17. None of you will be expected to choose a side until then. My personal advice to you is that you avoid doing so while you have that luxury. Unlike some students I could name from other Houses, who have very nearly died several times as a result.”
He found his father pacing before the door, looking quite agitated and annoyed, now and then attempting various bloodline-recognition spells on the door to the study, to no avail.
He sighed, and stepped up to the cradle and lifted his son into his arms. The wails subsided into gentler sobs. He turned back to his two eldest.
most powerful wizard of this age, I’d say the muddy blood has been quite adequately cultivated and reclaimed.”
Draco clenched his jaw at the happy, encouraging look on his boyfriend’s face, and carefully unwrapped the gift.
“I believe my son’s acquaintance just explained to you that the spell Cloud used was perfectly legal. Allow me to confirm that this is quite correct, and that while its use upon casual acquaintance is rare it is not prohibited.” Mr. Zabini said smoothly. “Now kindly remove your hand from my son before I remove it from you.”
“Yeah but there’s six of us now! We can split into two teams, take out two by surprise and then we’ll have a chance against the others!”
He opened his robe and touched his wand to his manhood and muttering a quick spell to get this last part started.
“No, Lord Voldemort. It is improper for the Lord of Malfoy to bow before the honored guest in his home, except during ritual exchanges of gifts.” Draco said, taking a few steps forward.
He withdrew his wand and pointed it at the water, whispering a charm that had served him well in his early adolescence.
“Ok, carefully! There’s something weird about these other boys they don’t have normal auras even if they’re sleeping!”
“Um…hang on.” Potter fished out a Chocolate Frog, opening it and snatching the animated sweet before it could escape. Potter handed the empty box to Draco, who reached for the invisible edge of the cloak and pulled it up.
With some effort Jamie slowed her breathing and returned her face to a neutral expression. Her eyes belied the attempt, dancing with merriment as she stood before his inspection, waiting for him to finish so she could burst with her exciting news.
Ron’s face was turning dangerously red, Draco noticed. Clearly Arthur’s youngest had been chafing at the enforced friendliness between them for the past few months, and was method-acting this little scene to the hilt.
“Yes Master Draco! Kreacher found the artifact Master Draco is wanting! Very powerful and Dark! Kreacher has never felt so frisky, Kreacher had to enjoy himself with the statue of the beautiful wood-elf Laliarana in the back garden after touching the wonderful, wonderful Dark magic! Would Master Draco like to meet the Lady Laliarana as well?”
A shower of rice rained down on them as the townsfolk gathered to wish the charming young couple a happy honeymoon, and Fred and George snuck up on them and hoisted the two blushing grooms onto their shoulders, making them highly visible targets.
“And you saw me meet with the Dark Lord last night. How much did you hear, Harry?” he asked, trembling.
The children seemed to catch the idea, and their giggles merged with those of the older boy as he was mercilessly tickled, the wolf howling joyfully as he ran quick circles around the happy throng.
to be a potion. Perhaps some weaker variant of the befuddlement drought they’d sabotaged that morning, worn to celebrate the occasion?
“Knowledge is power, and we Malfoys have always sought after power.” Draco smirked, extremely pleased with the stunned expression on his husband’s face.
“I’m sure Hissy-fit gave you the limited account they could understand.” Draco said coolly, eyeing the creature disapprovingly. “Which is why they should have left such an explanation to wizards.”
“In that case, I would like to make a sizeable withdrawal.” Draco said, ice in his voice once again.
The Slytherins, of course, were all having their very discreet conversations: passing veiled threats, probing mutual weaknesses, and carefully keeping an eye on Draco, wondering what kind of devious plot their Prince could be hatching this time.
The charm didn’t affect Draco’s sight, of course. Sadly, Potter was clearly not enjoying what was happening so far.
“Yes Ronald, I think it’s about time I let you get to second base, at least. Draco is quite right, the best way to respond to this sort of humiliation is revenge, and I’m quite sure your mother would never approve.” Granger said briskly.
Potter was just coming out of the washroom. Draco quickly slipped his hand into his pocket and pulled out the blank scroll he’d shrunk there, quickly enlarging it and holding it innocently in his free hand as he pointed his wand.
Draco looked at the entire scroll again. Now he thought he could tell the difference between magical artifacts and glamour at a glance. And…what was that…an active spell to keep rain off. And that appeared slightly different than a listening spell there, or a customized Protego worn against the skin there. The old man had a lot of protections and spells around him. Draco ignored them.
The muggleborn imitated his attempt to touch the package, with the same result. The two turned to look at Harry, who was still petting the other swan.
Harry had jumped a bit at the theatrical bit of magic, then with a grin at Draco, reached forward and opened the lid.
“Actually, blood magic is permitted for the purpose of verifying a claim of birthright.” Tom interceded.
“Don’t worry, look!” Potter said into Draco’s ear, causing him to shiver again. That damn “aftershave” was messing with Draco’s head again.
“We’re no where near ready to take down Voldemort, Draco. There are things you don’t know. Things that have to be done
Nor was the center. A large lightning bolt, stretching from a Dark Mark at the top of the parchment, down to the portrait of Potter at the bottom. His connection with the Dark Lord was a point of vulnerability then, along with his protective heroic streak.
“You’re crazy if you think I’m going to be nice to a Death Eater that has me tied up on a cold bathroom floor!” Potter hissed.
and someone was whimpering and Harry’s tongue was like fire in his mouth this time and he needed to touch Harry, touch him, and feel the searing heat of Harry’s penis as his fingers curled around it and stroked it and Harry was shuddering and the burning pain/pleasure of Harry’s sex magic was suddenly doubled and doubled again as Harry was growling and moaning into Draco’s mouth as his body thrashed against Draco’s and his penis was leaping in his hand and warm liquid spilling between them and Draco’s knees gave out as he came too but Harry’s strong arms held him up for Harry to keep devouring his mouth until they were both spent.
Potter’s big green eyes widened in shock at the disturbing objects inside, and Draco leaned in to whisper to him.
“I don’t know. I know I was trapped in some place, I remember being there so long that it seemed like forever, but there wasn’t really a concept of
Draco tsked and drummed his fingers on the table…right next to where the other boy’s wand had been carefully deposited by the hex.
Draco shifted away from the cursed mop that was trying to get into the action, its ropes curling seductively around his ankle and lower leg like tentacles.
A knock at the door proved his husband had been monitoring that damn map Draco wasn’t allowed to use. (Something about him being too prim and proper to be allowed such an instrument of chaos…whatever that meant – a map that showed the location of every being in the castle seemed the
“Silence! Thank you! Now, you will all be pleased to hear that the Hogwarts team will be coached by our new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor…none other than our own Quidditch legend, the youngest Seeker in centuries, Professor Harry Potter-Malfoy!”
Draco needed an alibi. Blaise needed enough information to allow him to accurately choose the winning side.
’s gone, if you’re sure we can make it safe, I’ll want nothing more. But while this curse is on me…this damn prophecy…I won’t take the risk.”
Tom spun out from under Harry’s hand and raced back to the bedroom, fumbling frantically with the doorknob before bursting inside to find the infant still safely asleep.
Hermione frowned, “Actually I wanted to talk to you about him. When he wrote the note, I offered to involve him in researching it but he was very… he seemed to want to hand it off and forget about it. He said he’s made too many mistakes already and he trusts you two to deal with the Dark Lord. It seemed very… uncharacteristically humble. Draco, is your father quite well?”
“My son and Granger have started this, in our culture. But I gather they are here to gather the army of minds that will be needed to move this forward, and eventually, I am certain, their plan is to break this into your world. Maybe much later, after we are all long dead. But eventually, yes.”
Tom considered it. Rather a clever custom, he thought. Repetition on a daily basis, from a young age, would make young heirs quite malleable to their parents’ will by the time they reached adolescence. Draco had explained to him that a great amount of family ritual magic was designed to prepare for and counter the wildness that stage of life brought with it.
“Look, I know Malfoy will be there. But so will Jamie. I really want to meet her properly, even spend time with her. She…she’s Sirius’ daughter, Ron. I
, cut itself off with a quick “beep” to indicate the available message length had been exceeded, and vanished with a theatrical little pop.
“Both these subjects will be taught in a workshop format by one of our two new additions to the Professorial staff here at Hogwarts, which I am
A snickering arose, and someone coughed the word “Potter” behind their hand. Draco waited for silence again.
Accidental magic typically produced effects that would take many years to learn in spell form. Complex applications of Wingardium, or general-area effects of Reducto, or even Inflagrante and Lumos. Draco had heard rumors of infants who grew up to be immensely powerful, like the Dark Lord or Dumbledore, altering weather patterns according to their moods or causing individuals that angered them to grow sick.
“I asked if they could tell me about my father, and they were telling us that who I’m related to doesn’t mean anything, and Draco was saying that it does too.” Jamie informed the Head of House, ever so helpfully.
“I’ll join you in one hour, mother, Severus.” Draco bid them farewell and headed briskly for his office.
“No! Not them, please not them. Draco? Why are you doing this? We were going to be married! I thought you wanted to be together!” Potter pleaded, eyes desperate.
Potter’s eyes were suddenly going big in realization, obviously he was cluing in to the fact the proposal wasn’t about Jamie.
? Most wizards never even bother with girls until they’re married! Too much worry about bastard children or accidentally piercing the veil!”
“Look. Potter’s not going to be looking for the Snitch if his friends are nearly getting injured every five seconds. If you aim Bludgers at Potter, he just dodges them and barely notices. Aim them at the Weasel and the Weaslette, you’ll get his attention.”
Draco’s fingers froze as they passed across one spine, and he quickly drew them back, inspecting the title.
“My understanding of the mechanics is limited. Suffice to say that a surreptitious magical test showed Potter to be full magical heir to the Dark Lord.”
Harry Potter looked terrible. Dark lines under his eyes, his face was pale, his adam’s apple bobbed as his eyes slowly focused on the two intruders.
“Doesn’t it always? Yes. It’s a surprise for him. I’ve been preparing it since holidays, and now it’s ready.”
with Draco. Draco knew this was impossible, not because of the years of enmity between them, but because Potter was not
Tom watched in fascination as the multiple coils of a three-headed snake wound its way out from under a bureau.
Draco thought about that for a moment. After five years of watching is every move, he was sure he knew every mannerism and every foible Potter exhibited. It would be easy to translate that awareness into solutions for Potter’s small frustrations.
“I won’t hurt you, if you’ll be my friend, I’ll help you.” He shouted into the wind, edging closer to the pillar.
“Yes, Harry Potter. I’ve heard a lot about you from mother. The Wrackspurts tried to get Regulus too, but I chased them away.”
“Goodness you’ve grown over the past three months! Why, you’re practically as big as your fathers!” she praised them, dropping a kiss each on the two dark-haired heads before pulling back from herself for a better look.
Draco would not be the one in control of their first sexual encounter…he’d be swept away entirely by Potter…lucky to escape with his sanity and independence intact!
“Well…” for a moment the elder Zabini seemed at a loss, “perhaps I should reconnect with Draco again. It’s been some time…”
“While I’m anxious to prove my innocence, I am concerned that the nature of my business this morning remain…confidential.” Draco met the Headmasters eye and pushed the word “Horcruxes” to the forefront of his mind. The Headmaster blinked, slowly, then nodded.
“Is that so…” Draco said, not particularly pleased at the comparison, but also conscious that the Muggleborn witch was consistently ranked just barely below him in Potions, and had apparently brewed Polyjuice in her second year. If she had access to this highly developed Muggle version of potions, perhaps this explained her frustratingly instinctive understanding of one of the more mysterious branches of magical theory.
Harry was shaking in his arms, and Draco though he must be crying until he realized the Gryffindor was laughing. His gut wrenched painfully as he realized the other boy was hysterical with shock.
Potter got a very strange look on his face in reaction to the phrase, somewhere between confusion and amusement and absolute horror.
Lucius smirked “A significant portion of my family fortune may be attributed to early investments in the modern broomstick industry. I assure you the depictions in your literature, which would have come from before the concealment charms became standardized, are no more representative of a Firebolt than a piece of chalk is of one of these elegant devices.” Lucius held up the fancy fountain pen he was taking notes with.
“Are your eyes still closed?” Draco asked suddenly. Harry’s arm tensed with guilty startlement under his hand, and Draco pulled him to a stop and leaned in to talk low in his ear.
“I hope you learned something from that famous set of parents you’ve got, Potter. ‘Cause we’re going to need it. What have you got for us?”
“I wanted Slytherin,” the girl said. “And I’m too quiet to be a Puffball. And I don’t like to study.”
Jamie gasped in delight at the combination, then gasped again as the baby took a firm grasp of the finger she offered and tugged on it imperiously.
“We can’t be seen together. Granger, and Ron, and Jamie…they are the only students who know I’m courting you, yes?”
“HOOOOOONKK!” They were jerked from their reverent embrace by the sound of the Weasley twins blowing party favors that
Draco’s legs squeezed his husband and his hands clutched desperately at his shoulders, his torso, the sides of his head as Harry moved in and his mouth was devouring Draco’s mouth and he was
Flint raised an eyebrow and repeated the gesture, three fingers separated from a raised pinkie and tapped gently twice on the breast, the opposite forearm, and the groin.
Hours later, Draco was ensconced in his “throne” in the Slytherin Common Room, waiting for the nervous first-years to make themselves comfortable. He nodded to Goyle and Crabbe, who cleared their throats loudly.
A hand appeared from nowhere and grabbed his wrist, a thin shimmering layer of silk-like material was thrown over him and suddenly there was Potter, eyes glinting with excitement, less than a foot from Draco’s face.
“It’s connected to another artifact, in another location. Trust me on this, we need them both working. They’re part of my plan to ensure the Dark Lord will never bother us again.”
Draco unfurled the scroll and tapped his wand to the new icon depicting two pieces of twine tied together.
“This again? Albus, that is a terribly and inaccurately simplified generalization to two very different feats of ritual magic.” Severus argued.
accept it! It’d hurt her feelings so much if you turned your nose up at it, she knits them by hand for everyone in the family. I know it’s not pretty like your normal clothes but it means a lot to her. Please…for me? It’s not just a sweater.”
“They will polish and shine every inch of marble, and every cobblestone of every Malfoy path or road on the Manor grounds, before they eat or rest.”
“And you’ll have a mother, Harry. She’ll love you so much, I know it.” He whispered feverishly into Harry’s ear. “And once father gets used to the idea he’ll care for you too.”
The laughter was suddenly audible, a horrible, sardonic, slightly bitter chuckle that made Draco cringe.
“This sounds suspiciously…Hufflepuff, Mr. Malfoy,” Severus said, somewhere between disgust and admiration.
Tom picked up the baby and followed Harry into the other room and sat in the rocking chair Harry transfigured for him.
“The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. Born to those who have thrice defied him. Born as the seventh month dies. And the Dark Lord will mark him as an equal, but he will have a power the Dark Lord knows not. And either of them must die by the hand of the other, for Darkness shall reign while both of them survive.”
The man didn’t answer, just turned his head away for a moment, reliving some horrible memory no doubt. Then he turned back to Draco with a soft smile.
Draco didn’t return to Hogwarts until just after dinner, and immediately set out in search of one Harry Potter.
“My birth parents are long dead. But I believe you know both of my adopted parents, especially Draco.”
Potter sighed again, and this time Draco saw his shoulders bunching just slightly as his arms moved under the water…
“I trust there will be no further aspersions on my bloodline from within my own House?” he queried, noticing the flinches at his slight emphasis on the
Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry on the mouth, and Harry was suddenly devouring him hungrily, his hands eagerly pulling his robes open and exposing Draco’s pale skin to the air and to Harry’s exploring hands and tongue and chewing teeth…and that wildly powerful surge of magic that overloaded his mind with pain and pleasure and insane lust!
“Oh. That was just the pressure-system shattering. There are now pieces of crystallized dragons-blood scattered all over the Potions lab, and especially inside that one cabinet. It’ll take them a moment to cool to lose their structure. Then the exploding acid will leak out and-”
Draco! I cannot change them no matter how foolish they are! I may have decades left but my usefulness is at an end.”
The Ravenclaws were speculating on the identity of the translucent rod that had been spotted, as well as the implications of what could only be Heirloom, Magic, Blood – the rumors from second year about Harry Potter being the Heir of Slytherin were being brought up again and ruthlessly analyzed.
Of course. Draco could almost hear the lesson in his father’s voice now. “Never rule out a possibility. A Malfoy is never caught unawares. A Malfoy has a plan in place for every possible outcome, no matter how improbable. Those who are caught unprepared reap their rightful reward, and good riddance.”
The Runespoor, perceiving an insult, hissed their displeasure and started slithering their way out of the bedroom.
His conflict was solved when the door to the nursery suddenly opened, a bleary-eyed Draco Malfoy stumbling inside.
Then a list of Death Eaters. No surprise there, except that Severus wasn’t listed among them. Strange.
There was also the fact that different types of Muggles probably had their own unique rituals that applied to them, according to status and bloodline. The chances of getting his hands on a Muggle of similar status to Potter was unlikely.
The Black library was fascinating. Built along similar lines to the Malfoy library, and with a similar pattern of Neutral and Grey tomes and the irritating but not illegal revisionist historical accounts…all organized according to a system psychologically guaranteed to cause any uninformed searcher to give up on certain areas before they ran across the truly illegal Black tomes.
“Well, it seems the boy isn’t a danger, at least. I believe my work is done. Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, Mrs. Weasley. I shall take my leave.”
And since Draco was Jaimie’s cousin, and also her magical guardian, that made a sort of twisted sense then…Draco was the magical guardian of Potter’s magical sister, making him an odd sort of uncle to Potter.
Which explained the low rank Severus had in the enemies list. Right below Draco’s own position on the list. He may be on the Light side, and thus an ally to the Boy Who Lived, but was a personal foe of Harry James Potter.
“You’re the Heir of Gryffindor, Harry.” Granger said dismissively. “Anyways. The first is a very old family heirloom. I wonder what Malfoy chose…surely not something dark I hope!”
“Potter is a Gryffindor, dear Aunt. Jamie is quite adept at using Potter’s feelings on family to her advantage, even if he doesn’t understand blood-ties.”
“What-t-t-t the f-f-f-fuck?” Harry chattered, his eyes bright with shock. Draco quickly moved back away from him, grabbing for his robes.
“Yes. I am your cousin. And…wizards and witches take family very seriously. Do you know what it means to be a Black, Jamie?” Draco told her.
“The Dark Lord is an immensely powerful wizard, and has been known to detect the use of his name in places of magical power.
Draco sighed. He’d nearly forgotten about the movement of the more sacred Malfoy heirlooms currently going on in the house, his mother was doubtlessly frantic and paranoid with concern.
"Nagini is the one holding you, not me. You'll need to do it, Potter. One little Unforgivable Curse. Can you bend your Gryffindor morals enough to finish the job?"
Draco dove, taking the distraction as an opportunity to shake the insane Seeker off, but Potter simply inverted on his own broom, flying upside down and backwards, a handful of Draco’s front in his fist holding Draco’s face inches from his own.
“What in the name of magic did you think you were doing? Blood magic, and in front of muggles – look at them they’re about ready to run! Where did you learn such foul magic at your age? Has someone called an Auror?”
“Your father, Sirius. He was a brilliant wizard. I have on good authority he was an Animagus before he even finished school. Most wizards never achieve Animagus transformation in their entire lives. But…he was a Gryffindor, the first Black to be a Gryffindor in centuries. And, like all Gryffindors, he was brave, and hot-tempered, and a complete idiot. As such, he ended up in Azkaban. That’s the wizard prison. I assume that’s where he met your mother. They would have taken you away as soon as you were born, and he was never told. If he had, obnoxious Gryffindor that he was, we would have all heard about it. So someone else claimed the Black inheritance when he died.”
Draco slowly stood, ignoring the ruin around him as his eyes scanned the area where what used to be his desk stood.
The boy’s eyes widened at being addressed by name, and in the language of snakes, his mouth opening and closing in momentary confusion.
“Please, call me Hermione. I’ve never stood on ceremony among friends and colleagues, let alone family.” She called out.
“Why, Draco? I…I loved you. Why would you…just…why?” tears, falling down his cheeks. Draco tenderly wiped them away.
“Either he assumed your line and one of the other branches of Black would merge, or he just didn’t care as long as
“Not precisely. I would guess around one or two in the morning. Why do you ask?” Draco turned his head to see Potter staring at the back of his head as if contemplating something.
He stared at both his best friend, Ronald, and his newfound enemy, Malfoy, bite at each other, subtly looking at his left wrist, at the fancy name written in fancy calligraphy, and then looking at the blond git in front of him.
“Yes.” Harry nodded, feeling proud to have a response for that as well, “And I also have a blonde who needs a date.”
He let Hermione pull him up and out of the classroom, silently noticing Ron carrying his bag and patting his shoulders. If they were speaking, he didn’t hear them.
“Exactly. We don’t know three things, if Harry’s on Malfoy’s wrist, if Harry’s the soulmate, or if Malfoy knows who's who on his wrists.”
“Hmm?” Harry was not leaving. Just bringing his cloak towards Draco. This conversation was not over.
“Ice should help the bruising go away faster. I didn’t have potions when I was young so I can vouch that ice is really helpful when it comes to bruises.”
Draco nodded, “Mom implied he was… absent during my first year alive, focused on death eater business. It was after my first birthday that he… met his son.” He looked down at his wrist, and Harry winced at the slight finger marks surrounding both the names, “That’s when the names become more visible. Readable.” Draco sighed, “And he was mad to come home and find that his name was on one of his infant son’s wrists.” Draco shrugged, “For a while it meant nothing, though regardless he never let mum let me out of the manor, or let anyone visit me. Mum convinced him that whoever was the other name would be my… enemy. That this meant he and I would have a wonderful relationship as father and son.”
Hermione piped in, uncomfortable and shy, “It’s the dark mark, Harry. His… mark. It appears above an area where his followers or he… has killed…”
Harry nodded, not being able to speak through the knot in his throat at hearing someone else voice out loud something he feared only he felt. Draco has been a victim of circumstance and his only crime is being born in the wrong family.
… “I feel like the murder of your parents is enough trauma to create vivid memories, regardless of age.”
Harry opened his mouth to object again before Draco interrupted, “I’m not stupid, or stubborn, and maybe I am a masochist but I’ve had enough… But I’m not leaving him with my mother. I don’t fancy finding out what he would do to her. And convincing her to leave him… that won’t be easy.”
Harry heard the rain, the thunder, the disturbance in the lake, the wind in the forest. And yet his heartbeat was louder than all of that as for a second he wondered… if I open my eyes now… will I be in my room?
And don’t get him wrong, is not that he’s ashamed. Is just that after the very traumatizing experience with the Dursleys, Harry was scared of how the Weasleys would react to there being a guy on his other wrist, much more who it was.
Ron didn’t say anything more, looking almost like Hermione when she was struggling to solve something, and motioned for he and Harry to go to the box. Their problem was solved, their new silence had to do with something else.
He did get a little bit better, enough for the bags under his eyes to lessen. But the first challenge was a few days away and from Hagrid’s little helpful nudge, he had discovered it was dragons. And no matter what anyone told him, nothing could prepare him for dragons.
Harry groaned feeling his neck crack and reposition each bone as he properly sat up from the hunched down position he had fallen asleep in. He looked down and saw Draco had been smarter than him and at some point during the night had repositioned himself with his head resting on Harry’s lap. Maybe that was the reason why Harry never really laid down on the floor, the selfless yet selfish idiot that he is.
Hermione did not raise her head from the bed and at the angle she currently was, face down on the bed looking away from them, Harry couldn’t pin down what she was angling for.
Harry grimaced, looking away to Ron who was glaring at him, “Never make me do that again. I’ll fight for you, but only when it’s necessary.” Harry nodded. But honestly, he’d much rather both boys be angry at him than the possibility of Lucius appearing at school and bruising Draco’s face once again.
“Oh, you’re a fucking idiot!” Hermione sat up and rested on her knees on top of the bed, fist clenching her skirt as though that was the only thing holding her back from pouncing on Harry and punching some sense into him.
Draco shrugged, “No one knew about his son being a Deatheater until Karkaroff’s trial. He gave names for a lesser sentence, and in front of everyone and in the presence of both the father and the son, ratted out to Barty Crouch that Jr was one of the people responsible for the attack on the Longbottoms.”
Hermione nodded, looking at Ron proud, “Plus I don’t think Lefty senior would be so open-minded about his son taking the family name with him to the grave due to his sexuality. Lefty senior would want a son that could make him heirs and keep their tyranny going. Harry as an enemy is great, it gives them credit with their ‘friends’ and leader, it sells the idea that they are the baddest of the bad. But Harry as his soulmate? It just screws their whole plan up.”
Harry was the clear enemy, and there was somebody else, maybe a man, who maybe they thought was the soul mate.
Harry nodded and got up, heading towards the stairs to change into his school robes only to stop at the end of hall, where Ron and Hermione were sitting by the stairs, Hermione with a book in her lap and Ron with a bundle of fabric that Harry could quickly guess what it was.
Hermione waved that fact away, like it didn’t change her facts, “Senior has disliked you ever since we first met him two years ago, and we all assumed it was because of You-Know-Who and how you brought their demise, but!” She paused for the drama, watching as Harry and Ron became anxious in wait, “Do you remember everything about that meeting?”
Draco stared deep into Harry’s eyes, anger seeping off of him, his stare seeming to be digging for any lies in Harry, challenging him. And it wasn’t until Draco visibly flinched and his face contorted into that of pain, that he realized that Draco had been trying to pull his hands away ever since he mentioned Ron, and Harry’s grip on his palms had been only increasing in strength.
Harry looked at the paper, it’s not a long list, it should be easy to find in the cupboard, and considering Hermione was probably gonna drag him around with this potion, it's only fair he got the ingredients.
“He faked his death to blame it on Sirius and get everyone off his trail. He’s the one who gave my parents' location to V- You-know-who. And Sirius was the only one who knew the truth, so,” Harry shrugged like the actions of Petigrew were an obvious turn of events, “Fake your death and blame it on the only one who can call you out for the death of the Potters.”
He began to walk towards the entrance, never looking at Harry, “It is mandatory to wear it, so you should probably run back quickly and get it.”
“Lucius would rather he’d play none. Lucius would rather his son be dead than having him conspiring with us. I think Lucius is still a death eater. He’s still helping Voldermort, regardless if he’s alive or not.” Harry knows he is, but how is he gonna explain that to Ron, “If Lucius finds out Draco’s on my wrist as well, and that he’s not my… enemy... “
Draco was silent, and Harry nodded, letting him ponder on what he said. But eventually other students began to come in, and Draco sighed, “Let me think about it.”
After begging Draco to throw his shyness away and dance that stupid dance with him, to no avail, all Harry remembers is having heated discussions on who else could Harry take to that stupid ball. The consensus being the no-mates Padma Patil and Daphne Greengrass and maybe Ginny. Actually by the end Draco seemed to be favoring Ginny. Patil and Greengrass were wild cards, while everyone knew where Ginny stood, and that was in cloud nine with her favorite blond. Both her and Lovegood were too young to go to the ball. It seemed like the gents would do them a favor and all but sneak them in, for their own selfish reasons.
Malfoy didn’t back down from his glare disguised as indifference, but didn’t say anything more. Moody nodded. He didn’t bother explaining what the curse was before moving to his desk and pulling out a spider, placing it on the table and performing the curse on it.
When he felt the press of lips on his he rejoiced, following the lead in a slow dance of lips. Every small turn, every swift gasp felt like a gift, like an apology, like a promise. Harry was unsure of who was promising who what. So Harry turned off his consciousness for a few minutes and let his body speak for him. It usually did a better job anyway.
If you came back here through some other method... still go back and make sure you did read chapter 8.
Malfoy never let his eyes hinder on Harry for more than a second, in fact, he never let it hinder on anything for more than a second. He was nervous. “I had a feeling you didn’t.”
He knew that Ron had a hard time realizing that the know it all brat was his soul mate and that Hermione fussed for a while about the prick who was hers, but now they amicably accepted and are testing out their friendship to see how good this could be. Neither questioned which wrist was the enemy when both Hermione and Ron had Bellatrix Lestrange, a criminal who currently resided in Azkaban.
Harry could get away with this very easily, he realized. Everyone believed him to be slow, distracted, unaware. Someone like that gives quick answers of basic assumptions, so he shrugged, “My scar is telling me that something is coming.”
Ron sighed, pulling out from beneath his bed their trunk of snacks, “I know. But you have to get out of this alive.”
He tried to smile as he heard Pomfrey grumpily walk away. She cared too much and he could never fault her for it. But he was still exhausted so all he did was murmur, “I’ll try to limit my visits to one per year.”
It’s probably that he’s tired the reason for him finding Ron’s caring whispered voice irritating, “Awake because my life sucks and soon I’ll have to compete in some deadly competition and deatheaters are back, so maybe Voldemort is back and I don’t know how that will affect other aspects of my life and whenever I do fall to happy slumber someone interrupts it.”
Harry knew what she meant, and Harry hated the answer. But he wasn’t going to lie anymore, “You’ve all never hid your distaste for the Malfoys.” He muttered in return, not looking at her.
No one was breathing now. Everyone held their breath as Moody casted one last curse, shooting a green stream glow, ending the life of an innocent spider. For his own entertainment.
Two days later, Harry wondered if it was humanly possible to vomit all your organs. He wanted to. And sometimes it felt like he was about to whenever he heard a dragon roar.
Harry turned back to Draco, expecting him to expand on it, while Draco bitterly smiled at Helena, “Salazar Slytherin had a belief of blood purity and that muggles were beneath us, and a group of people to follow him in an attempt to achieve it. Gellert Grindelwald, believed that it was degrading to us wizards to hide and ostracize ourselves from muggles and that we should expose ourselves and establish dominance over muggles, and he also had a group that followed his beliefs.” Draco finally turned to Harry and tilted his head as though expecting Harry to finish that thought.
“Past that point he stopped even attempting to train me, father me or whatever he thought he was doing. Past that point I became a masochist and tried my best to fix something that was broken from the moment I was born.”
Harry did say though that he desired to stay in bed longer, actually feeling the lull of sleep. And Ron’s smile seemed to suggest his active desire to sleep was an improvement. Nonetheless Harry got up, following Ron to the showers to wake themselves up. By lunch Harry realized that Ron and Hermione were back on bodyguard status, never leaving Harry alone, Harry testing this by going to the restroom a ridiculous amount of times, without any desire to piss, and watching Ron suddenly also have an unreal desire to piss. Though… if it was real Ron seriously needed to see Madam Pomfrey.
She pushed Ron from his bed and laid down like Harry had just put the world’s weight on her shoulders and she was crumbling. Ron shook his head and patted her back, smiling as she once again huffed at him and ignored his attempt at soothing her, “How did he react?”
Harry sat in bed for hours till morning came telling himself over and over again “When the day starts I will ask Draco to the Yule Ball, warn him as vaguely as possible that his father will beat him for it, try to convince him to find a way to disconnect himself from his family, and I promise I won’t let Draco go to the Ministry mission next year”.
She continued laughing and Harry sarcastically joined in, bitter that people were talking shit on his dancing behind his back, “Ha ha, funny, it’s you.”
Harry stood up, slowly approaching the panicking Draco, trying to touch his arm to calm him down, “Draco-”
After a few minutes of staring, glaring and gawking at the letter, Ron huffed then switched his glare to Draco, “Dude… open it!”
That night Harry dreamed. Like a real dream, with weird amalgamations of Salazar, Grindelwald and Voldemort chasing him through a forest, his parents alive, crying on his grave and Draco and Ron dancing a waltz while Harry grumpily glares from a door. He woke up two hours before Ron feeling disturbed and jealous, regardless of the fact that he knew that Ron would never make a move on Draco. So when Ron woke up to find Harry glaring at him, he reasonably nearly jumped off his bed… More like fell off the bed.
Hours later the sun was shining on his face and Harry hated Hermione for insisting they’d sit by the window to help him stay awake. Harry had spent the majority of the day fighting for consciousness, losing his resolve during History of Magic, not consciously falling asleep, but passing out from exhaustion.
Other than that... Yes, this chapter was mostly filler. I did not want to rush to the Yule ball since that would be the schoolwide confession and when the Lucius bomb would in some way drop (though I already dropped a tiny one).
Draco let out a brief breathy chuckle, not really feeling it, but recognizing Harry’s attempt at lightening the mood, “Yes. That. He- He was the first to walk away and pretend he never meant it. If You-know-who hadn’t really died, he would’ve been the first to be killed for… treason. And if- big if… if he somehow were to come back… You-know-who would not be happy with him.”
Ron had not expected Harry to actually explain it. Harry had not realized he had an answer. But hearing it out loud, it wasn’t a lie. He could recall those nights at the Weasley’s when he’d spend the majority of them sleeping for thirty minutes, fighting to go back to sleep for two hours and then sleeping for another thirty, and blaming it on some noise that didn’t exist.
The next time Harry saw Draco, he was surrounded by Durmstrang and Beauxbatons girls and a few Beauxbaton boys. Harry had not expected someone to try and pursue Draco, much more considering the soulmate marks. But people liked to experiment with non-soulmates when they had yet to find their own. And they didn’t know they were hitting on Harry’s soulmate. And Harry couldn’t fight them. Draco was loving the positive attention.
They all remained quiet while they pondered this, Hermione settling back on the bed and Ron leaning against one of the bed poles. Harry on the other hand made the mistake of laying down on the bed, and the accumulated lack of sleep from the past few weeks-
If you came here through notifications, or whatever, this is the second chapter I post in less than 10 minutes. Make sure you've read chapter 8.
Finally he heard the aggressive opening of a door and the angry shuffling away of Lucius Malfoy with the rhythmic beat of his cane.
Draco smiled and nodded, “I’ve done what I’ve done trying to prove to someone I was worth their attention not realizing that they’ve never cared enough to begin with… What is your sin, Potter?”
Forgive me for the two rants in the a/n in the previous chapter. I could have maybe rephrase them better, but I don't apologize for either.
Draco looked up, analyzing the anger that has yet to leave Harry ever since he found out the truth of the shit show that became of the marauders. “I think my mother mentioned once that the Potters had been close with Sirius Black. It wasn’t in a good tone, or a remorseful one. The Blacks were not happy that he had ended up a Gryffindor. He’s considered a traitor in… what’s left of his family.”
Harry smiled and softly reached for his cheek, leaning forward and softly pressing his lips to Draco, flinching himself at Draco’s flinch of pain. That woke the boy up.
Harry was not so prideful as to deny that Hermione and Ron were basically his impulse control. But they weren’t there right now. And so when he noticed he lacked impulse control as he quietly followed the Malfoys a good distance away, he started digging for something else inside of him that would stop him from doing whatever he planned on doing.
“Seven. I’m guessing due to studying for exams a lot of people are having difficulty waking up. So thank your luck for that, Harry.”
1. This is for lovelyoons who sent that comment that put me under pressure to finish this chapter, despite the fact that they said 'no pressure'... next time, say 'full pressure'. Because apparently I work under pressure.
Harry stayed put, letting Draco set the pace. He patiently waited for Draco to gather up the courage to do whatever it is he wished to do, not judging him a single bit for however long it took. Harry knew how stifling-fear felt like. And Lucius has been attempting to condition Draco into fearing getting anywhere near Harry. Harry could wait.
Deep inside he understood why Draco had reservations in letting someone else in. Everyone who had been in before only disappointed him, just like Dursleys had with Harry. And then when Harry peaked out of the walls he hid himself in, he found the Weasleys who welcomed him with open arms full of love.
The trio continued walking until they reached the edge of the campsite, far away from any gossiping ears, where Harry’s secret could remain safe.
“I still want him to like me. I know he won’t. Destiny decided that long ago, but I still want him to like me.”
“Is only fair. Ask Diggory if he’s figured out the egg. You’re only in fourth year, he’s a senior. Try and use pity.”
They stared at each other for a few seconds, both daring the other to break from their statement, Ron losing this one, “Alright, Harry told me to shut me up. But it still counts!”
Harry stumbled on air, startled out of his unconscious angry trance, as he glared at the boys walking ahead. He looked to his side to see Ginny and Hermione, both looking confused at his anger. He guessed he hasn’t really done that much work really to defuse the hatred on this side either. So they don’t understand why he’s bothered by the shit-talk.
His ears perked up when the Hufflepuff seeker was mentioned. Harry believed he saw Diggory walking out of the goblet hall, but was unsure he ever put his name in. Harry looked at Ron and shrugged. “Two knuts for Diggory?”
She mulled over it, looking divided between joining the school party and something else. Finally she sighed, “I already made plans with Luna.”
Ron woke Harry up an hour before class with a few questions regarding his sleep, most of which Harry could not answer because he could not recall when he fell asleep, if he slept, or if he dreamt. It felt like Harry blinked and it was morning. But Harry did not feel rested.
Hermione nodded, leaving the room and leaving the door open behind her as Dean, Seamus and Neville walked in, still not used to Hermione coming into their room without any regards for privacy, now even disturbed with the idea of it considering they’ve all hit puberty.
Harry nodded, picking up his cloak, “You shouldn’t let anyone damage your face. It’s too pretty for that.”
Draco was ignoring everything and everyone. Parkinson was blatantly staring at them. Zabini was leaning back on his chair and sleeping on Parkinson’s shoulder.
Future Draco already told him it was a fluke, a trap, so why is he still going? Sirius dies because he goes there… ‘I will not go to the Ministry, I will not go to the Ministry, I will not go to the Ministry…’
Ginny shrugged, like it didn’t bother her that she was the only Weasley who couldn’t go to the ball, “And?”
So, after years of giving him only long-sleeves hand-me-downs from Dudley, so that he would hide his wrists, they began to give him regular summer clothes -- hand-me-downs -- and Harry had to figure out new ways to hide his wrists.
Harry has not actively done anything to change it either, all he’s done is convince himself that he won’t do something. But Harry still doesn’t know if there’s something else he does that could harm Draco, Harry doesn’t know the consequences of all these changes.
Harry looked around, physically looking around for his will to now ruin the moment and wake the boy. He almost wanted to cry, this was so unfair. Harry softly bumped his head to Draco’s, trying to nudge him awake, and the boy only unconsciously nudged him back, a small ‘hmm’ leaving his lips. Harry nearly cried. Harry tried to move but the boy only whined and Harry really just wanted to scream at everyone to go back to sleep. Sadly, he couldn’t.
Malfoy laughed at something Zabini said, a mocking laugh if his body language is anything to go by, then joined Parkinson on the seats, watching Zabini follow a few seventh years to the goblet, not putting his name in, but seeming like he was pressuring the older students to do so. This would not be the first time Harry wondered what was the extent of these kids’ social power in this school. A fourth year pressuring a seventh year to enter a competition was new.
He stopped and turned around, the weight of his sleepless night falling on him too quickly and too hard. Why did it bother him so much that Malfoy was asking him this? He shook his head, “I know you’ll never do it, but you can ask Hermione or Ron. I never left their side since the goblet came out, so they can vouch for me. I didn’t put my name in the goblet of fire.”
He turned from the flower bush to find Malfoy sitting on a cold stone bench, almost hidden between rose bushes.
“He’s known all along that they weren’t gonna get along so Lucius never bothered. Plus the fact that you-” Ron turned to look at Harry who was glaring at the mirror, water running over his hands, “It’s not a matter of trying to change destiny and maybe fix his relationship with his son, it’s a matter of destroying you. Destroying what you want. Lucius doesn’t know if Draco’s on your wrist but he knows he will have an impact on your life. So regardless of what role Draco plays-”
Harry silently grumbled, wanting to make a bet, but realizing Ron did not gambled blindly and Hermione was simply not stupid. He knew none of the names his classmates kept calling out for. He sighed.
Draco gave a pity smile in return, “Once he’d realized what he’d done he killed himself.” Draco turned to look back at young and innocent Helena, “And that’s our pride and joy, The Bloody Baron. The Grey Lady’s murderer and an example of what happens when you let your desire of something overtake your life.”
He looked around in the dark, grasping at the afghan, holding it tight as panic surged in him as he remembered the … vision… ?
Harry nodded. “I-...” Harry looked around, noticing the nausea never left, just shifted in intensity depending on the situation, “I also thought I was gonna die.”
Chapter 8 (this one) was finished 3 weeks ago. Chapter 9 (next one) was finished right now as I post this, and I started it yesterday. It's frustrating how I can go months with writers block and then write a fucking essay in 6 hours. Because the next chapter feels like a fucking essay.
With the simple motion of his left hand he silenced the entire room, and with a simple wave of his wand on his right hand he set the mood. Lights down as he walked towards the goblet, always the one for theatrics. And everyone ate it up as they all huddled together, anticipating the results.
“No, I meant,” Harry gave a breathy chuckle, “The… us… thing, is need-to-know till the Yule Ball. The other thing, no one has to know that ever. Except…”
Harry watched profusely as Draco’s eyes took everything in. His lips, his hair, his chin, his scar, his eyes. He really liked his eyes. Draco’s finger grazed his cheek again, slowly reaching up to the permanent reminder on Harry’s face of just how not easy it is. “My father doesn’t like you.” Draco’s voice sounded like an angelic whisper.
“And how does that hurt Malfoy? He was trying to piss the bird off, if anything, I made him sound a little cooler.”
Malfoy shuffled allowing Harry to see a bit of his face, enough to see him nodding, “I was actually going to ask why are you still with them. Why are you with them in the first place.”
The trio looked at her with looks of horror regarding the rumours that they themselves had not heard. She shrugged and went back to her group of friends.
Harry shook his head, stubborn to not learn at this point, “Bold of you to assume I understand patterns.”
Draco shook his head, dropping Parkinson’s arm and walking towards the corner they just came from, hoping to find someone hiding there and finding disappointment. “I swear someone’s-”
Neville nodded, dropping a parcel on Harry’s lap, “Someone left that for you outside of the tower. The Fat Lady refused to say whom it was from. Just started giggling.”
He shook his head, a small prideful smile making small youthful wrinkles of joy on his face, “Wear my shoes long enough and you’ll become an expert at stealthing around and gathering information people don’t want you to hear.”
Ron nodded, patronizing Harry, before standing up and dusting off his pajama bottoms, “Do I want to hear about it?”
Hermione nodded, her curls bouncing with her excitement, hitting Harry and Ron in the process, “If you’re his enemy, and they are in the side of You-Know-Who, why keep you separated? Is more beneficial for them to keep you close. Hell, is more beneficial for them to pretend and make you believe you are his soulmate to trick you and get your trust. The play they are making doesn’t make sense if he’s your enemy.”
“A-... kind-, no… not loyal either… I don’t know, fuck it. Hufflepuffs can do bad things too if coupled with greed!”
My mother sent me to my room as soon as he burst in bitching about how I was making him look bad. Didn’t stop him from coming to my room later, dragging me to the bathroom and fruitlessly trying to ‘clean’ away his name from my skin… Sometimes the way he looks at me is like he’d wished I’d never been born. Sometimes the way he looks at mum is like he hates her for failing to give him the magnificent son he’d wanted. Sometimes the way he looks at me… is like he’s contemplated cutting off my arms, but the only thing stopping him is the lack of alibi or excuse as to why.”
Harry didn’t realize how much time had passed, sitting next to a quiet Draco until he noticed the candles were being put out on their own and sunlight was beginning to appear at the end of some hallways. He turned to look at Draco only to realize why he’d never replied.
Harry nodded, “I prefer you over Hermione sometimes, she’d just tell me to wait to figure out how to diffuse Lefty’s anger. And then scold me. But also prefer Hermione… she would help me understand in depth what I did wrong and how I could do better.”
Harry didn’t let his smile drop, putting on confidence he didn’t feel, and just shrugged, giving him one last look before pretending to go back to whatever conversation Ron was having with Hermione regarding the two bearded twins. Maybe he should pay attention… Why did Fred and George have beards?
Harry looked at Ron who was grimacing at the Skrewts and leaned in close to whisper, “Pick a fight with Draco, I’ll fix it later.”
Harry wanted to give Parkinson an unsure smile, anything to try and ease the tension, but it came out as nothing more than a quiver on the corner of his lips. He sighed and decided to join those who were blatantly sleeping through class.
It’s been hours and Draco probably doesn’t remember what they said prior to him falling asleep. But Harry hasn’t slept just thinking about it.
Lets see. Finals were... rough. I thought I was going to flunk a class for the first time in my life. As an honor student, straight up panic. And I panicked so hard I reached the zen level of indifference and numbness. But I survived.
“He said a few wrong words while petting his hippogriff, but Ron greatly exaggerated. He did not attack the hippogriff at all.” Harry wasn’t even glaring at anyone, not really. He was glaring at the empty space between Ron and Mr. Weasley, imagining Lucius Malfoy there, wondering how much of this was his fault.
Basically Harry wanted to know if there was a way to change that. What if he delayed him asking. What if Harry asked differently.
Molly shook her head and ushered the kids to go to bed, so when Arthur got … honest, Harry was already too far away and all he heard was ‘Malfoy’.
The foreign students were confused to him being there, while Diggory gave him a pitied look, already getting the gist of the shit show that was Harry’s life.
Then Harry looked at Neville. And he could understand why Hermione burst out demanding he stopped. Neville looked the curse was being done on him. And once Moody stopped, Neville left too. Physically there, mentally gone.
That night he had another vision-less night. Dreamless even. And so on it went for a few days, to the point where Harry began to think it was a metaphor for the stillness in progress in real life. But in the moments of insomnia at three am in the morning, that wise old voice in his head told him it was because he has done nothing significant to affect the future, so it had nothing to show.
THANKS FOR READING! See you in like a month? Hahaha, I'll try to make it shorter. But... Read the second note at the beginning.
Harry’s tone never changed, sounded like he was bored asking these questions, and he thought Draco’s behavior was immature, “Why does he hate me?”
Draco looked back as Harry walked away with the muggles, and went back to following closely behind his parents as they searched for an appropriate place to apparate.
Harry had no idea where he was pulling all of this from, but Harry wanted to touch Draco and fool himself into thinking his fingers could heal his injuries, “I spent the majority of my youth covered in bruises and being taught the million ways to hide them. School would’ve had a lot of questions. You could say I’m a bit of an expert.”
