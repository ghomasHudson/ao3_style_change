He wished he could have told Potter that, because, more than anything, he wanted Harry to know he’d changed, that he’d come out of the war a different person.
Draco.
“What do I think?!” I know I’m yelling, but I can barely hear myself over my racing heart (or that infernal motor). “I think you’re a bloody mental patient!” I cup the bulge of his crotch just to prove my point; he’s as hard as I suspected.
“You’re such a drama queen,” he scoffs.
The thread unraveled another inch. “Pretty pathetic, huh? You know what’s really strange? The time I should have despised you and been the angriest, I wasn’t.” His hand went to his chest and traced the scar that lay beneath. “When you hit me with that curse, I couldn’t believe it. I was too shocked to be angry. In some ways, I think it made me like you more. How fucked up is that? You weren’t Dumbledore’s perfect little Potter anymore. You were flawed. It made you more human to me. I could understand an enraged attack. Even if I was the target. I’ve still got the marks, by the way.”
“Still hate the car?” he pants.
What can I say? I like to make him happy.
Draco bolted upright, taking a step back. “Okay, stop that now! It’s seriously creepy.”
Part of him wished he was still naïve enough to care what colors someone wore and what common room they called home. Ignorance really could be bliss. But living in the real world was a far cry from Hogwarts. His tribe no longer wore Slytherin green; they wore St. Mungo’s lime. And the only colors he cared about were the color-coded forms he had to fill out in triplicate for each body.
That got his attention. He finally spots me for the first time since his arrival.
“But that was before.” Harry’s icy fingers flexed around Draco’s wrist. “People change.”
It took only a minute to document the visible injuries on the grey “Morgue Use Only” form attached to the chart, and by the time he’d finished, his mind had settled into its professional groove. He had a job to do. And while he still wanted to bawl his eyes out, he felt compelled to do this last kindness for Potter.
Draco placed his wand at the top of Harry’s head and traced it down his body, following the invisible circuitry of magical meridians that lay beneath the surface, concentrating on re-opening them with a steady recitation of the counter-curse. To reverse the effects, he had to keep his magic flowing steadily through Potter’s inner channels, essentially holding open the pathways with sheer willpower and intention so Harry's own magic could flow again.
Jeans tangled at his hips, Harry bucks against me. I know he’s close, but I refuse to let him come yet. He owes me.
The truth was simple. And beautiful.
His hand slides up and finds my erection (as if that proves anything).
Stumbling over to the chair by the worktop, Draco collapsed into it, holding his head in his hands. The tension in him snapped, and the sobs that had been trapped in his throat erupted in a crackly bawl.
“Suck me first,” I hiss back. “Make it good, or I’ll never set foot in this disgusting heap of junk again.”
He went back to the grey form, noting all injuries he saw, then set aside the chart and cast a quick diagnostic at the leg. A ghostly recreation of Harry’s appendage appeared in the air above it and slowly split into layers, revealing that the break had been clean through the femur and, lower down, through the tibia; the fibula was hanging on by the skin of its teeth.
I can’t hold back a snort of derision. “This? A ministry car?”
He had to be dreaming. That would explain why the atmosphere felt artificially compressed and why the silence had begun to throb with an ethereal, high-pitched hiss.
“Well, what do your think?” he asks.
Never again would he leave himself open to such pain. There was too much risk when other people were involved. If he wanted to survive, he’d have to go it alone, because he couldn’t take another loss like this. It would kill him.
The friction is magnificent. Our bodies fit together as if they were made for each other. His lips and teeth maul my neck as we grind together. Slipping my hands between our bodies, I unzip his jeans and try to shove them off. His cock springs toward me through the gap in his shorts. Pressing my hips forward, our exposed flesh meets, and he groans when I move against him.
His roll of gauze ran out, so Draco crouched down and rummaged around the cart’s lower shelf for more. “I guess you know all about wondering whom you can trust, don’t you? Is that why you frequent so many Muggle establishments?” He popped up and gave Potter a little smirk. “You were trying to meet men who didn’t know you were famous, weren’t you? I can understand that. I’m thinking about going on holiday someplace where no one’s ever heard of me. I need a clean slate.”
And wrong.
And that was at least partially true. He wasn’t stalking Potter or plastering his image all over the walls of his flat; he just had a fictitious romance with a wizard who probably hated him.
Sighing, he tugged at the thread to see if it would loosen. “But truthfully? You humiliated me. And if there’s one thing a Malfoy can’t tolerate, it’s disrespect. Or, you know, that’s what I thought at the time.” Smiling weakly, he shook his head. “What a crock of shit. I can’t believe I wasted, like, five years of my life plotting ways to embarrass you.”
But telling himself not to think about Potter was like telling a starving man not to think about food. No amount of wishful thinking could deter a decade’s worth of obsession.
Sure enough, inside were full-size photos of Harry exiting the back door of the club, his head ducked down but still completely recognizable. He had most assuredly not been wearing any leather in that picture—but his jeans left very little to the imagination.
Until he saw Weasley and Granger walking together in the hallway from the end of the hall, whispering loudly to each other. He gave an idea to test the Weasley temper but it's no a good idea to do it alone.
He lands himself on his knee and eyes wide at Percy’s newly dead body, his vision became flickers of blur and his breath became cold. Tears still streaming on his cheek dripping down.
Harry was thrown into the nearest wall and they ripped his shirt off, leaving him naked. Harry still attempted to escape but he was pinned down, the gang forced his face into the ground and made his bare arse the main attention.
"I know very well that you killed my brother! You traitor, what's next?  Killing my family? " he growled.
"No wonder everyone attacked Potter earlier" Theo suddenly came to sit next to Draco on the soft sofa.
“Ow! Are you blind or something?” The owner of the voice paused and Harry became more tense when he recognized the voice that belonged to a certain red haired boy.
"What are you doing walking alone potter? Looking for another target and blaming it on you know who?"  Ron said in a dark voice.  Harry trembled a little as he faced his former friend, his mind immediately telling him how much he hated it like this.
“Need something?” Harry asked, hoping that Malfoy didn’t see anything.
" I also feel last year he wore a mask to look brave "Draco dropped his opinion to his friends.
He was tense and his breath was bated, wanting to pay no attention to all the people staring at him; his vision blurring as he started to panic.
"I can’t believe they let you back, ” Ron muttered darkly. “You killed my brother, you belong to Azkaban! You bloody murderer,” Harry ducked his head down and left, trying to avoid everyone and everything. He bit his lip to stop it from trembling, and firmly squeezed his eyes to stop unwanted tears from welling up.
He walked alone, he was usually surrounded by Ron and Hermione but it seemed their relationship was different now. In the hallway, Harry was bumped into, ignored, and sent hateful glares from the other students, mostly from Gryffindor.
Nothing interesting happens but he just wants to stay entertained by looking around and walking.
And look now who made the wrong choice. Now he felt sorry for Potter, but it was his fault for refusing his friendship offer in the first place.
-------------
"Please-"
She finally finds them but there is no sign the Potter boy was. She began to rush to the two Gryffindor,
Harry heard someone calling him from behind, he knew it was the voice that someone who was usually close to him had,
They must be disappointed with the child they have given birth to.  He could not see his parents angry with him, the pain inside him was already stinging against his chest.
"He already had with his relative Minerva, you shouldn't have to worry too much about the boy. I believe he could handle it on his own," Albus answer a bit firm but Minerva was having none of it.
"We haven't met him today, actually " Ms Granger answers. And it makes Minerva winder, how they haven't seen the boy?
“Potter, move your stuff so I can sit there,” Malfoy demanded.
He didn’t realize that he was crying, He pressed hard his palm to his forehead trying to ease the emotion he had, all awful thing has ever encounter flashing before his eyes. Harry harshly thug his hair hard trying to remove all memory he just remembers.
Ron, Hermione …No
“say what all you want Harry, but remember,” the other Harry walk closer and whisper,
"No," Harry panted as he felt hands roaming all over his body. He hated it.
"Nice arse Potty," Piers chortled. He slapped Harry's arse and they all laughed, enjoying the view. "Now, let's have some fun shall we?"
"It's your fault Harry, you failed me," said Percy's body laying on the ground lifeless. The dead body faced Harry with the eyes  open and staring at him.
But he realises that he was laying on dirt. He slowly opens his eyes, his vision still blurry. He got up to a sitting position and he blinks himself to clear the vision.
Dumbledore thought that they were only being strict with Harry, and Harry was frustrated with Dumbledore's asinine way of thinking. Sometimes he thought that Dumbledore was only using him, and didn't care about his health or well-being at all. In fact, only a few of Dumbledore's previous actions refuted such thoughts.
Before the end of the Hogwarts year, Harry had decided to let Hedwig go free, and he was happy that his lovely owl was finally out of this miserable house and didn't have to suffer with him. But his happy thoughts quickly ended as he recalled his recent dream.
Saturday, Sept 2, 1995.
When he decided that Harry was screaming too loud, Vernon started choking him to quiet him. "Shut up you useless brat! You should grateful for the fact we keep you in this house, but you decide to sicken my family." There was a strong venom in Vernon's voice as he blubbered on. Harry was pulling at his uncle's hand because he was choking, but he was too weak to do anything about it. He was running out of oxygen and his eyes were full of tears, Vernon was screaming in his ear but Harry couldn't hear him. He was fast becoming light-headed and he felt that he was going to pass out from lack of oxygen.
“Need something?” he asked dryly, Draco could tell he was hiding something but he knew he wouldn't get any further. Instead he responded, “Why would I need something from people like you?” He could've sworn that he saw Potter flinch a bit.
“Don’t you see?” the other Harry turn around and stare at the dead body of his best friend no…former best friend, “They left you, they let you down. They deserves it!” the other Harry said slowly and kick Ron’s head hard and he believes that he shattered some bone on the neck area.
“I’ll be waiting,” he can hear a smirk from the that “and you will be amazing as me”
Harry felt disbelief in the fact that everyone believed Ron rather than him, he felt hurt inside but hid it and walked back to the Gryffindor dormitories.
"Did you see last year? I saw something was not right with his behavior ... like he faked his courage at the tournament last year," said Pansy, the others started to shut up and set their eyes on his friend,
"Minerva," Albus walking slowly into his office while Minerva follows him.
He is back.
'I have to stop obsessing over that scar head', he thought as he shook his head.
The darkness swallows him and makes him alone with the fucking dark lord. His eyes glowing red and the cold stare is eating up in him and froze Harry in place.
Could he shut himself up in the Gryffindor dorm?  Wait why does he care.  Draco immediately threw away his thoughts about Potter.
"it's okay if you want not to tell it, if you want you can tell it to your friends," said Myrtle
He didn't know what happened or how he had gotten back to his room after the
"Boy!" Aunt Petunia called Harry from the kitchen, "Yes Aunt Petunia?" Harry answered, trying to keep a low profile to stay out of trouble. "Go weed the front yard now, I'm tired of doing it all day," she complained. Harry nodded, fully aware that she had done no such thing, and walked to the garden.
"I heard that you're a queer Potty," Harry kept silent, afraid of what would happen next. "Potty is a queer? How shocking," the gang laughed, Harry knew that they said it to get a reaction but he still didn't want to give them any satisfaction so he kept a stone face.
But he was now starting to wonder what Potter was up to ...
He walked to the bathroom and the surroundings were quiet and cold.  He walked in and he heard the sound of someone sobbing inside.  At first, he ignored it but he saw the ghost of a girl heading towards the sobbing voice.
" Potter, you won't know what's coming.But I-" hr stop for a while and grab Harry's collar harshly and whisper "I'm going to make your life miserable like you do mine"
"I heard that this year we have a new DADA teacher. Somehow I feel that this year won't be fun," said Pansy, Draco's attention turning back to his best friend.
He entered the Room of Requirement and the room changed into a small apartment. There was a bedroom, a bathroom, and a small kitchen. For some reason the nice scent permeating the air made him relax a bit.
He wondered why Dumbledore didn’t say anything about the Ministry's views. And why didn't he listen to him? He had told Dumbledore about being in a horrendous household, and about his friends who had casually turned their back on him without giving any explanation.
"Have you heard the boy? HAVE you seen the boy? He doesn't want to be there, even he begged me to not let him back to what is called his relative Albus!" She debunking
Harry looked up in slow motion and faced his best friend, no- his former best friend. Ron was hardly a friend now let alone a best friend. Ron's face became more visible but still shadowed and he saw the hateful face in front of him.
She just getting more and more worried about where the Potter boy at. Is there something that happens to him? Or someone just hurt him?
The whole time he was walking, everyone that he usually called friend just bumped him on the shoulder or scowled at him. Harry almost got hexed by Ron but thank Merlin he missed, the Weasley twins attempted to prank him as well but Harry's quick reflexes saved him.
"Let go of me- hhmp!" He was forced silent as a cock was shoved in his mouth. "Suck it you bitch," Harry refused the verbal command, biting the dick and making Gordon scream in pain. "The fuck?!" He screamed. "I SAID LET GO OF ME," Harry screamed, just hoping someone might heard him. The gang had none of it, they dragged Harry to an abandoned park nearby where no one would hear his cries for help. He was frightened and trying his best to get away from all of this shit. Unfortunately, Harry lost. It was his small, starved body against five large well-fed bullies.
She saw Mr Longbottom reading a herbology book on the sofa, she believes he one of Harry's close friend. She takes her opportunity to know where the Potter boy at.
Harry always managed to sleep three to four hours, and if he was lucky he might get five hours of sleep if he didn't have any nightmares. He leaned his back against the window and put his legs up on the seat, trying to get at least some rest. For once, he had a dreamless sleep.
Harry found himself lying on the uncomfortable floor and he felt the sense of dirt touching his skin.
“No? Why not? We finally free Harry, think about it. No one will stop you, no one will use you and no one will hurt you anymore.”
“No!” Harry cried. He knows that they are the most hated people he ever met but, they are mother family. What will she think of him now?
“Studying,” Draco answered simply.
He didn’t realize that the train whistle had blown, he felt tired and his eyes were heavy considering that he never got a decent amount of sleep at the Dursleys.
He threw himself onto the bed and lay on his stomach, crying into the soft fabric beneath him.
Minerva just stood there disbelieve. With a hard heart, she dismissed her self and try to find the Potter boy if he fine or not.
"You'll get in trouble for this!" Granger said warning him and seems to try to stop him from doing something
And when they are finished they on their way back to Slytherin dungeon since today there are no classes on Saturday and also is nice to starts a new year in Hogwarts without classes on the next day.
Also this haven't beta'd
He already failed as a golden boy. Always been.
The more he thought about it, the more he doubted that thought. It was almost his fifth year of Hogwarts, and he hadn't received letters from anyone. He tried to convince himself that they were probably busy with their separate lives, but then he remembered that they were spending their summer together this year. He was kind of jealous but mostly happy for his best friends getting together, Harry was fine with being the third wheel. But just remembering what happened in the Tri-Wizard Tournament at the graveyard and how differently everyone treated him afterwards, he knew that there was a high chance that they had actually said that.
"Who's the teacher? I hope it's not a wolf like before," stated Blaise, whose arm was still hooked around his girlfriend's waist.
Draco turned his head, side-eyeing the body, praying the man was just an uncanny look-alike, nothing more than a case of mistaken identity.
Stepping up to the gurney, he cleared his throat.
The tragedy wasn’t that Draco had lost his imaginary friend; it was that the world had lost an honest and good person who only wanted to protect those he loved.
“I think my balls are currently somewhere near my liver; could you possibly turn on the heat in here?”
“I’ll Apparate home, thanks.”
“It’s not an obsession,” he whispered to himself.
“I’m really sorry, Harry,” Draco rasped. “You didn’t deserve to die like this. I mean, maybe you didn’t mind dying in the line of duty, doing what you felt you had to, but, after everything you’ve been through, you deserved more. Something good. A family. Love. I don’t know what you wanted, but it should have been yours.”
He paused and stared at the abrasion on Harry’s side. “It’s hard when you don’t know who you can trust. The whole time I was growing up, I could never tell if people really wanted me or something I had. Slytherins can put on a good show when they want to, and they have all kinds of reasons for the deception.” Draco smiled fondly and glanced up at Harry. “I can’t tell you how weird it is working with Hufflepuffs who go around saying and doing everything with absolutely no pretense. It’s actually a relief to know exactly where I stand with them—even if they hate me.”
When it’s over, I pull out and rest my forehead on the seat beside him. We’re both out of breath, and he clamps one hand around the back of my neck to keep me where I am.
A hospital-issue white sheet. Common. Seemingly benign.
What he needed was some real reality, someone who could help him forget himself for a moment. A lover. Or just a quick shag. He needed the physical touch of sex to feel human, but he didn’t dare become too intimate. Not now. There could be weakness in wanting something too much.
Shaking out every sheet he had, he laid the thick stack atop Harry’s paralyzed body, and, tucking them around him, cast a warming charm to take off the chill. “I’ve just got to run up to the Curse Reversal wing. I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere.”
Having worked Curse Reversal for six months, Draco scanned the pages that followed for more clues, but he saw no further notes. Emergency always did the shoddiest paperwork. They claimed they were too busy, but those prima donnas just thought proper procedure beneath them.
His laugh sickens me, and I’m already sick enough. My stomach rolls as he makes the center of the road his own personal lane (the only consolation being we’re no longer inches from careening off the edge of the pavement).
“There,” he said to himself. “I’ll just get the Skin Restorer and start wrapping you up. You should be back to your old self by the morning.” He stopped short, realizing what he’d just said. “I mean, your skin—the wounds should be mostly healed.”
Draco’s hand dropped to the gurney with a dull
. “Now that I think about it, we’re kind of alike in other ways, too. We both took jobs that involve public service, we both despise dark wizards, we’re both targeted by the press—for entirely different reasons, mind you.” He broke into a grin. “And we both secretly send money to Granger’s Help the House-Elves Fund. I saw you sneaking in that cheque at the last charity ball.”
“Told you,” he smirks and yanks me into his lap.
Potter’s breath was warm but ragged, his lungs still partially immobilized by the curse. “Thank you,” he puffed.
Where the bloody hell is he? I can’t stop the impatient tapping of my foot as I check my watch for the millionth time. It’s been almost twenty minutes now. If he thinks I’m going to sit around much longer . . . what
Hope that he would fix the cabinet in his sixth year and keep his family alive.
He preferred to save his emotional breakdowns for the shower, where he could pretend that the wetness in his eyes had been caused by the spray. It was a ridiculous game he played with himself, as he lived alone and had no cause for subterfuge, but feigning serenity was the only way he knew how to survive.
“The road is perfectly straight, Draco.”
And, usually, he was.
“Potter?” The name had no sound, just an question made of air.
Malfoy curled his hand into a fist and slammed it into his thigh. He hated feeling lost, hated needing help and knowing it would never come. The worst moments of his life all shared the same pitted punch of isolation.
I snort. “Could have fooled me. I thought you were going to start humping it in the driveway back there.”
Draco peered over his shoulder, better prepared for the carnage the second time.
“Stop,” I grunt.
“I kind of don’t know what do now that you’re gone,” Draco said, his voice echoing oddly in the silence. “Isn’t that stupid?
Pressing his fist to his mouth, Draco fought to maintain his composure, but the prickling behind his eyes proved too hot to withstand. Clutching his tender stomach, he doubled over in an attempt to smother the howl before anyone heard. But he needn’t have bothered. His throat had closed too tightly for any sound to emerge.
Which proved to be exactly the clue he needed.
The eyelids shuttered down again and fluttered back up.
With a sharp snap the thread ripped, and for a second, Draco stared at it, startled by the loss. He’d needed something to focus on. A lifeline. It felt as if he’d been betrayed by that bit of useless string. Disgusted with himself, and the unreliable tensile strength of the hospital bedding, he dropped it and frisked the sheet’s edge, seeking out the torn end. But unable to see through his tears, he was forced to abandon the search in favor of finding his nose-blowing towel.
“But first, maybe you could do me a favor?”
Draco looked up at Potter’s placid face, and another lurch of regret gripped his insides. He didn’t want to be wanted by just anyone. He’d been holding out for the one person who might understand him and what he’d been through.
“Isn’t it great?” he beams.
prat. I wanted to make you pay for … I don’t know … not shaking my hand, I guess. Gods, that sounds stupid when I say it out loud.” Draco ran his finger over a loose thread, plying its frayed edge with his nail. “You probably don’t even remember that, do you? Me offering you my hand on the train? Fucking hell, I must have replayed that scene in my head a million times. And every time I thought about it, I just got more and more furious.”
Harry’s body responded with a purposeful blink.
In that moment, hope gave way to reality and—oddly enough—reality turned out to be
The bone slid back into place, setting as smoothly as he’d expected, and Draco spent the next five minutes casting healing charms at the muscle and tendons until everything looked the way it should.
The corners of Harry’s mouth curled in tired smile, and Draco almost burst into tears.
—but when he opened his eyes, the body, shrouded beneath it’s macabre white sheet, stubbornly remained, appearing even more stark and stiff than it had before. Too real.
Draco took comfort in the fact that he hadn’t started serenading Potter with golden oldies yet.
My hand aches from squeezing the door handle so hard. “Really? I don’t know any anti-death charms.”
Over the years Draco had seen at least fifty articles about Potter going beyond the call of duty and committing acts of extreme bravery. He’d been awarded about thirty medals of valor from the Auror Department, and although Harry dutifully stood at Shaklebolt’s side for the photographers, Draco could tell he found the pomp and spectacle embarrassing. He just wanted to do his job and to be left in peace.
With a smoothing swipe, he pressed the tape over the gauze and scanned Harry’s torso for further injuries. Finding none, he reluctantly moved above the neck. He’d been avoiding those cuts, dreading the idea of being face to face with a death he wasn’t ready to accept.
He practically shoves me inside then slams the door closed. While he’s jogging round to the other other side, I eye the interior. It appears that I have become trapped in a time warp. The 70’s are alive and well . . . and infecting my new silk suit. (Well, just the trousers. The jacket is still safe on the chaise inside.) Shivering in revulsion, I try not to touch anything.
“Holy fuck!” Draco whispered into his palm. “What the hell did they do to you?” He staggered to the foot of the gurney and fumbled for the chart. Underneath all the scribbled procedural notes, someone had written:
Several more twitchy flutters followed and, all at once, Potter’s lids snapped wide open. Draco pressed a hand to his heart, pleading with it to stop pounding, and he’d almost talked it into slowing when those green eyes slid to the side, finding his own, and Draco almost fainted.
much sweeter than hope had ever imagined.
I pause, mulling over his confession. My cock is obviously pleased with the idea, but I’m still angry about being kidnapped and tortured. He doesn’t sound repentant enough. “What makes you think I’d stoop to such a muggle cliche?”
He rubbed at the ropey line through his robes. “Is it wrong that I don’t hate you for that?” he whispered. “I thought it was hideous when it happened, and I was pissed off that you’d scarred me, but now … I look at it in the mirror … and I see you. It’s like this weird connection between us. We were both forced to do things we didn’t really want to do, and we both came out on the other side completely different than we went in. We both survived.”
Something is tapping the window, Harry ignores it until he heard a squawk from outside.
He only wanted someone ... one was enough to accompany him who believed in him, but that would only happen in his fantasy of living a normal life with family and friends.
-------------
Harry had been laying on the floor unable to move for hours now, it was probably already night time. He let his magic heal his body slowly, feeling some discomfort on his stomach.
He felt lonely again, he forgot how it felt to be surrounded, like before when Ron and Hermione were always by his side.
Draco shrugged, "So what do you want to do?” Blaise was about to say something but Draco swiftly covered his mouth, knowing he would get an inappropriate answer and he was having none of it.
Seems they already left. Draco knew that the Weasley is up to do something, which seems like an interesting thing to know but it's none of his business so he walks it off and continues to walk wander around the castle.
Draco looked around and sure, Granger and Weasley were already gone.  To be honest, he was wondering what Weasley was going to do.  He had the feeling that Weasley was punished it would be fun to look at.  He was again walking around the castle and he planned to go back to the Slytherin dungeons.  He already felt that he had enough to walk the streets of this large place that were secretive
Harry was locked in his room again as usual, nothing new. He usually opened his books and studied, he hadn't realised how fun studying could be before. Hermione just made studying feel like torture, and studying with Ron was no better, he always complained about everything and everyone.  He'd even acted like Dudley last year, looking back Ron had never been a good friend. Harry thought about the Weasleys, they all blamed Harry for 'murdering' Percy. Ginny gave him death glares and the twins had sprung an awful prank on him that had almost made him blind. Ron had started throwing insults at him, and it shocked Harry that Ron had done such a thing to him. Even Hermione had somewhat mirrored Ron's behaviour, going as far as to ignore Harry completely when he was in the same room. They'd both been ignoring him, and Harry didn't know what to do about it besides just dealing with it.
He was finally alone again in his silent, dark, and lonely room. Harry let out tears of frustration as his emotions rolled over him. He cried as he felt so
"I doubt about it," she steps up and began to speak in a demanding tone
The force, the pain, the blood-
Harry stunned when he hears the manic laughter from behind him, the laughter gives him chills everywhere on his body. He recognizes the voice. The voice he always hated. The voice who ruins his life.
Hey, I'm sorry for going like months and I tried to make the chapter longer but I think this enough, and also I thank anxious_hufflepuff for wanting to help me. And yeah I hope y'all enjoy it
“I’m you, and you are me,” he said
He watch himself casting a spell, he barely heard it. His cheek drenches wet from tears and terror in his eyes.
Harry was confused, his attention now on his hand. Red liquid dripping slowly, it looks a bit dark and looks exactly like blood. Could it be his blood? Is he bleeding? But why does the blood cover all his arm?
“What are you waiting for? Get out!” Finnegan screamed, making Harry shiver from the shout. He looked at all the people behind Ron, Hermione was completely silent but she didn’t take any action, Harry assumed her to be on Ron's side. Neville just looked at him in sympathy.
The dinner is still the same as usual except the golden trio had broken up and no more whispers about how amazing Potter was and how much of a potter fan he was until he wanted to burn each one down at how annoying his fangirls were.
“No, please Harry this isn’t you! Don’t do this!” He cried and begged for something that Harry didn’t understand.
He felt the world around him become dark, black, and empty. There was nothing he could see or feel or touch, just emptiness.
“Why would I be happy? You…you killed them!” Harry said in terror. But the other him laughs as an answer. He just keeps laughing louder and louder  and make Harry frightened
Harry still froze in place not daring to move a single thing, the fear overtaking him, he shouldn’t suppose to feel like this, he supposes to fight back but can't. He feels that he want to scream and curse Voldemort for what he did.
'Hopefully Blaise remembers to use protection,' Draco thought, sighing internally. He searched for a compartment that was empty or mostly empty. As he passed through the train, he could tell that most of them were crowded by the noise level. After a little while of searching he finally found a quiet one.
He asks himself and his gaze still on the red arm belongs to his clone. There was a blurred figure he can see beside his arm, he saw someone laying there but bleeding. His heart beating loud, his head heavy and his eyes winded when he saw something behind his clone.
‘No, that couldn’t be me!’ he thought to himself.
Gardening was Harry's favourite thing to do at the Dursleys. It let him get out of the house, away from anyone else, and cry alone. During this time, Harry let himself relax from the pain he received all day. He constantly pushed down his feelings to ease his days, but it only made his chest hurt and made it harder to breathe. He was always careful with everything he did so that his uncle wouldn't have any more reasons to hurt him.
He turns around on his belly and lifts his upper body with his elbow, he wonders where he was and how to escape. He wants all this thing to stop.
“Oh, Harry. You are silly, never thought I will call my self a silly bloke,” the other Harry laugh again and it keep terrified Harry.
Harry didn't know what would happen next, he just hoped that being at Hogwarts would make it better. His only home. His only hope.
Vernon decided he was done with the useless freak then, and ended it with one last kick on the weak body. He left, leaving the light off and locking the door. Harry could finally breathe, and greedily gulped the stale air into his lungs, not caring about anything else in the moment.
Draco was having a perfectly normal Hogwarts first day. Pansy and Blaise looked like disasters when he found them, probably from their snogging on the train. Sometimes he wondered if they had any sense of shame at all. Knowing Blaise he wouldn’t but it wasn't the same way for Pansy, he assumed that Pansy became like this because of Blaise which wasn't surprising if it was. The three of them were walking together leisurely.
"Look what we have here," Dudley walked up beside Harry (he was resolutely trying to ignore the bigger boy) who was staring at the plant in front of him."Bugger off Dudley," Harry had no energy to deal with this right now. "What's wrong, Potty? We merely want to have a bit of fun," the gang laughed and Harry wanted to escape, but it was pointless at the moment. "What do you want?" Harry asked with a tired voice. "You look a little
“Having fun aren’t you Potter?” deep voice circling him slowly.
"Albus, have you look at the boy?! He already tired from the Prophet giving him last year. Just give the boy a break!"
He accidentally bumped into someone. “I-I’m sorry, I didn’t look where I was going,” he immediately apologized.
"That would be helpful. I still need more information from that boy," He said dryly
“I miss you too…”
Again he thought of Potter
"Seriously, I don't know. What happened to the golden trio?" He asked curiously.
"No," he couldn't blame it on someone else, he was the one who's supposed to stand for the wizarding world, it's his duty, but.....is it?
Harry shook his head, "I didn't kill them! And I would never hurt you or anyone, why would I ever kill my best friends" he cried, because the thought of losing his best friends was one of the most painful things he could think of.
After that Potter didn’t respond to anything, just stared blankly out the window. Draco saw that it seemed as if his eyes didn’t shine the bright emerald that they usually were. Instead Potter's eyes seemed clouded over, a darker shade and rather dull looking. Draco studied the ravenette in front of him, he noticed many things.
"Maybe that Weasel has accomplished spread his stupidity to that mudblood" Draco joked and everyone laughed.
He's trying to find his glasses, but he has them on his face. His vision finally got clear and trying to analyze his surrounding. The terror on his face and his face became paler,  he was in the cemetery again. He forces himself to stand up and look around just to make sure.
"I - I don't know anymore" his voice was hoarse, and Draco immediately thought of leaving. He recognizes the voice that belongs to the golden boy. Didn't want Potter to see him in the same place again.
After what seemed like forever, Vernon decided to leave Harry alone on the cold floor, warning him to shut up so he could try to have a good night's sleep. Harry let out a soft sob, trying not to be loud so that he didn't disturb anyone else. It was good luck that Hedwig wasn't there, she would have been lot of noisier; desperate to go hunting.
After all of that dinner commenced and everyone started heading to their respective dorms.  Pansy and Blaise immediately went to the dorms and Draco decided that he wanted to take a walk.
He glanced beside the pink teacher he saw an unusual expression on the headmaster's face.  He looked like he was looking for someone and that must be Potter, really confused about what the headmaster had always wanted.  Why is Potter always the one he's looking for?
“Hey girl… h-have any letter for me?” he asked but Hedwig seems to have nothing on her, Harry doesn’t expect any letter anyway but he glad he can see his snowy owl again. Hedwig nipped his ear and that just make Harry feel a little better.
This chapter has been fix my @anxious_hufflepuff, huge thank you for her,
Harry didn’t realize that he had walked himself out with an expressionless face. He needed to find a place to stay for tonight, luckily he knew a place. He walked up several flights of stairs to the Room of Requirement. He had discovered the room quite accidentally. He was panicking last year and found it by accident when pacing around the castle. Harry hadn’t told anyone (mainly Ron and Hermione) yet because everyone seemed so busy that he forgot to tell them.
"Huh ... I didn't think Gryffindor could be that stupid, especially that mudblood know-it-all-nonsense," Blaise said jokingly,
"She's the worst and I have a feeling that this year defence won't be easy," Draco snorted and silently glanced at the woman.
“That is not the first word that comes to mind,” I sneer.
And maybe that was why he felt so adrift that he couldn’t catch his breath. The person he’d most wanted to prove himself to had gone. It wasn’t that he needed the praise or attention; he just wanted someone to see him for who he was, who he’d become. Potter, of all people, would see how much he’d changed, and he’d understand why. Because the war had changed Potter, too.
In light of Potter’s death, all those daydreams he’d had suddenly seemed wrong. Inappropriate. Depressing.
“I was a prat,” he confessed in a whisper. “An
Something touched the side of his hand, and Draco glanced down to see Harry’s fingers coming to life, reaching out for him. Malfoy turned his palm up, open and welcoming, and shifted his hand over in an upside-down handshake.
“Oh, bloody hell! Yeah, that’s great! I’ve never seen such a perfect fucking smile! Just sit tight, all right. I won’t be a minute.”
Draco’s hand started to tremble, the palsy traveling up his entire arm. Gritting his teeth, he strove to ignore it, but denial had a way of breaking the man who abused it. He could talk till he was blue in the face, pretend Harry was still alive, pretend he would find something else to look forward to. But the truth always came out in the end.
Closing his eyes against the stinging overflow, Draco nodded.
He doubted Potter was into that sort of thing. He didn’t seem the sort to dress up in leather trousers and carry a whip. Although … it did conjure some interesting mental pictures.
want him—not now.
Swallowing thickly, Draco closed his eyes and told himself to wake up—
Hope that he would survive his seventh year.
Harry’s mouth pulled into a wry, lopsided smile, and he blinked once.
“Yes, you are,” he says as though he’s just solved a great mystery. “You’re jealous!”
“The car is great, but it doesn’t compare to you, Draco. You know that.”
The tiny smile on his lips worries me. Is he so numb to danger? He takes us out to the country. When we get on straight stretch of road, he slams the car into gear again, and we pick up even more speed.
He’d torn through the magazine right there in the Healer’s Lounge, desperate for an answer.
Jamming the ends into his ears, he ran back over to Harry and pressed the circular diaphragm to his chest. Draco held his breath, listening as hard as he could. A lethargic, but undeniable, beat thumped in his ears, and Draco’s eyes locked with Harry’s. “Bloody hell, you’re alive.”
Totally disoriented by fear, but unable to turn away, Draco leaned in, praying he wasn’t about to get his face eaten off by an Inferious-ed Potter. “Harry, stop blinking.”
His chuckle is a warm breeze against my neck.
Not real.
Several more seams pulled free, but Draco couldn’t stop destroying the sheet one stitch at a time. “I thought it would be easier to tell you how I felt now that you can’t reject me, but honestly, it’s still nerve-wracking. I’ve never even admitted it out loud to myself. I guess I thought that would make it easier to live with. And maybe it did, but … regret might actually be worse than humiliation. I should have said something while you were alive. There was so much I wanted to say. You’ll never know how much I wanted to thank you for pulling me out of the Fiendfyre.” The tears came faster then; Draco used his free hand to push them away, unwilling to give up his hold on the thread. “I’ll never get to tell you that you pretty much changed my life.”
And it would explain why he’d been seen coming out of Hannibal’s, a gay Muggle club in London that drew a fair amount of BDSM devotees. Draco had almost fallen out of his chair when he’d seen the picture pulsating at the top right corner of Witch Weekly’s July ‘04 cover with the caption:
Leaning over, Draco started to blot and swipe at Harry’s cheek, soaking away the soot and smudges.
Draco had to stop and wipe his eyes. When he could see again, he looked Harry up and down, wanting to reach out to him, but the closest he could manage was the edge of the sheet, his frozen fingers trembling against the white cotton.
“Yeah,” Draco whispered back, throat tight. “You’re welcome.”
“Most certainly not.”
The eyelids went still.
He just needed to think of something else. Anything else.
Draco went still, holding his breath. Hope. He’d never given the word much thought before, which seemed strange seeing as how hope had sustained him through the darkest times of his life.
“Is this for me or the car?” I sneer and yank my hand away. His grin falters, hurt flickering through his eyes.
It had all been make-believe, an imaginary world where he lived happily ever after with his boyfriend, a boyfriend who found him irresistible and funny, who loved him even when he messed up, who saw past the scar on his arm. That was a lot to ask, but Draco needed someone to counterbalance all the self-loathing and doubt he battled on a daily basis. He needed someone full of goodness to remind him what life was really about. And who else but the amazing Harry Potter had enough light to outshine the monsters of Draco’s shadowy past?
“Hurry.”
Beneath the tears, Draco’s face burned with chagrin, knowing he was no better than the common mob. The memory of offering his hand to Potter on the train—and being denied—sprang into vivid detail, the embarrassment and hurt he’d felt in that moment just as fresh as the day it had happened. What hubris.
Just when I think things can’t get any worse, Harry grins and turns the key. An obscene roar nearly deafens me. We’re backing out of the drive before I can object. Once in the street, Harry shifts gears, and we shoot off down the road, tires pealing sharply in my ears. I’m sure to have hearing damage.
Harry’s robes lay shredded in four huge gashes, the skin beneath bloody and serrated like raw meat. But even more disturbing, the bone on Potter's right thigh had punctured the skin, and it emerged from the torn leg of his trousers like the broken prow of a skeletal ship. Further down, his foot hung at a terrifying angle, obviously fractured.
We near the end of the road, and Harry pulls his hand away from my thigh to shift and steer. The logical side of me is relieved, while my baser instincts claim disappointment. A couple more turns later, and we’re bumping along some heavily wooded “lane” (whatever it is, it isn’t a proper road), and then he eases into a deserted clearing. I’ve had enough. As soon as the car stops moving (and my head stops spinning), I intend to get out and Apparate home. This is insanity. Harry throws the car into park and starts grinning at me again, his hand falling right back to my thigh.
To prove it, Harry slithers between the two front seats and settles in. He stares at me, thighs parted, daring me to follow. With a weary groan I accept his challenge. Once I’m actually in it, the backseat is huge. I realize it’s an illusion; it’s been charmed for extra space.
He opens my fly, and I breathe easier now that I’m not bending to the iron will of my zipper. Hot fingers wrap around me and begin to pump a slow rhythm.
“What’s it doing in our drive?”
Rebuilding his reputation and finding his own way had taught him a great many things about what kind of person he wanted to be, but what really kept him going, what gave him the energy to tackle his shortcomings and overhaul his life, that was all Harry. Harry-hope.
Draco healed the ankle with a quick spell; he’d mended about a thousand ankles in training, and bone work had always come to him naturally. The thigh would be easy as well, but he’d have to repair the muscle and skin afterward, which tended to be a bit more difficult postmortem.
The tic came again, twice in a row.
It showed no rhythm.
No longer could he imagine bumping into Potter and striking up a conversation. No longer could he speculate on how he might ask him out. No longer could he pretend there was any chance, no matter how farfetched, that the man he’d been dreaming about for the past ten years might want him back.
Me? A drama queen? Not likely. I just have a healthy fear of death and dismemberment like any other sane person. I notice the seatbelt and, despite my distrust of Muggle inventions, strap myself in. Harry finds this hysterical. A warm hand grips my knee, and I tear my eyes from the rushing scenery to look down. His palm slides halfway up my leg, his thumb drawing small circles on my thigh. While I usually appreciate a nice groping, I don’t think he could have chosen a more inappropriate time.
Even though he knew his fantasies weren’t real, he found comfort in them as if they were. He’d read that the brain didn’t really understand the difference, and Draco considered himself a prime example of someone taking advantage of “perceived reality.”
Draco’s blood went cold. “What the … ?”
Now here he sat, in broad daylight, bawling in St. Mungo’s cellar like a little girl. Because of Harry fucking Potter. Christ! Even in death that bastard could make him look like a fool.
His fingers closed around cold metal, and he yanked out the dusty stethoscope with a crow of triumph.
I give him the signature Malfoy sneer and eye roll.
Harry’s eyelids drifted lower, and then, in a short spasm, lifted.
“When I’m better”—Harry paused to swallow, out of breath—“maybe we could go out to dinner. Talk.”
It wasn't until hours later when the door slid open did Harry finally wake up from his slumber. He looked at the person who opened the door, everything was still blurry. He blinked rapidly to focus his vision and saw Malfoy stepping into the compartment.
"Earlier I saw everyone, mostly Gryfindorks attacking Potter in the hall a few hours ago," explained Theo, his friend was stuned when they heard that.
“What do you mean?” Blaise asked curiously.
, he wanted it to-
Every time he made a mistake, Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia always punished him, calling him useless and stupid. Dumbledore did the same, just indirectly.
Harry wondered how everyone would react when they saw that
The blood was still slowly spilling out, dripping down to the floor and staining his oversized shirt which was wet from his tears.
Harry jumps a bit. Harry looks up slowly t the giggling voice come from until he says shoes. He slowly and slowly moves looks up and he saw a figure it the dark
Harry started to be silent and could only stare at his former friend, all the memories they had made suddenly darkened ... it was like burning a beautiful memory photo together and watching him become ashes.
-----------
Ron will not be sad and angry, he will be happy. Everything messed up because of him…. Now everyone hated him, he was alone again. He was supposed to be alone so no one will get hurt. No one will die because of him. No one will care. If he just dies, everyone will happy and Dumbledore can find a better replacement for him to fight Voldemort … a replacement that better than him, stronger than him, and powerful than him.
“who am I kidding, I have to get out anyway,” he whispers to himself.  In the end, he got out but using invisibility cloth just in case he ran into Ron and Hermione maybe another students who hated him by now.
It was nice to be outside again, to see the blue sky and feel the fresh air in his lungs. It was nice and Harry was having a great day, but he felt tired as he started to weed. Everything was going fine until Dudley and his gang showed up.
“The things we usually do like discovering new secrets in the castle, something  interesting might happen, bother the annoying golden trio,” the last option gained his attention, he thought about it and remembered what happened after the third task last year, the golden trio weren’t the same after Potter had come back bleeding and with two dead bodies in tow.
An hour into reading his potions book, Harry was very invested. It was a much more effective way to study potions than listening to Professor Snape explaining something. Harry learned a lot just by reading. To be honest, he found potions more fascinating now than he had ever had before. He wanted to try and make some of the potions, and experiment a bit with them.
Harry was forced into giving them each a blowjob, he gagged the whole time and it was obvious that he had never done this before, or wanted to do it at all. He felt hands creeping under his shirt as they started to caress his body. Harry tried to do something, he tried to kick them but his legs were firmly stepped on to prevent him from struggling further. He shook his whole body violently in an effort to make all the hands stay away from him, and his head away from their disgusting dicks.
-----------
"He killed him as a baby Minerva, I believe he can handle it wonderfully," Albus said again and make Minerva in disbelief
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a familiar boy with raven hair.  He saw Potter walking alone with an uneasy look on his face. He knew when Potter was wearing his mask, he had asked himself why Potter was faking his expression and more often, his smile.
"how many lies that have you been told us? Am I not loyal to you?  ," now Ron's face turned red in anger.
All the memories from his dream just… felt real. He remembers all the tragedy in the graveyard instead Voldemort kill them it was him…no, this isn’t right. He would never kill them, he just wouldn’t his dream messing with him, but it was his fault that Percy and Cedric die… they don’t deserve it, if it’s not for him they will live by now.
Harry's face instantly showed fear and discomfort until he hid it under a similar mask. "None of your business," he answered softly and left. Draco was mildly disgruntled by the tone of his voice but didn't think much of it. After a moment, he returned to the dungeons.
“I doubt it,” he said dryly.
other than that, nothing interesting happened.  Draco glanced at the teacher's desk and saw the new teacher named Umbrige, whose smile was utter disgust.  Darco immediately felt disgusted and ignored the pink teacher.
"Harry  Potter scared? "Blaise said dryly,
“Percy, what’s going o-“ he stopped speaking when something walking through his body like he was a ghost. He notices the messy black hair and the milky tan skin the person walk through him and pointing a wand at Percy.
He hadn't realised that night had turned into day until he checked his cracked watch and noticed that it was the time for him to go to Platform 9 and 3/4. Harry grabbed his luggage and went to the car because he knew his uncle would be getting impatient. Everything still felt dark and scary for him, ever since- No. He couldn't think about it.
Okay a think this long enough but hey I hope you guys like it, i am so so sorry took you guys so long :')
“Nobody wants you here.”
, but he didn't want to know. Harry had felt stuck in his head and his back hurt. He merely remembered that there was blood, and then everything went black.
Draco frowned and confused, "Why are you asking?"  ,
Why? Why did things have to be like this? He thought.
The sentence echoed over and over again in his head, fresh tears flowing down his cheeks.
He spotted some Ravenclaws throwing glares at him and some of them shamelessly gossiped about him right in front of him. All of this combined made him feel sick.
Harry continued to suffer and cry for the forgiveness of something he never did. His uncle soon got bored of Harry's whimpers and pulled out his belt. As Vernon hit him with his full power, Harry screamed with every blow of pure pain. From the corner of his eye, he saw Dudley watching him getting tormented and grinning, enjoying the show.
Harry bang his head to the floor hard and made tinnitus ringing in his ear. All the sadness, replace with a numbness shallow him... Now just empty and hollow.
Harry wished he could have a decent day, even just one normal day. Sometimes he wondered why Sirius never visited him. He missed him, but maybe Sirius had something better to do than checking on his worthless godson. Harry shook his head, trying to stop his train of thoughts, and continued doing his chores.
"Yes, Professor " he answers quickly,
"Cedric, no! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I should have done something! I'm sorry," Harry repeatedly apologized. His cheeks were wet from the tears, his throat felt raw, and he was trembling with the force of emotions he was feeling. White mist surrounded him, making everything seem less visible. It made Harry shiver as two figures walked around him, make him even more scared.
His face paler than ever and his eyes winded in shock and fear. His hand trembling and his knee are weak to keep his thin body stand. He saw a dead body belongs to Cedric.
After the Dursleys ate breakfast and Harry was forced to watch, Aunt Petunia handed him the usual extensive list of chores. The list included cleaning, gardening, cooking meals, scrubbing the windows and re-painting the fence. After which, of course, he would be locked in his room, leaving him starved and dehydrated. Harry wished he could stay with Sirius, but Dumbledore always denied his pleas and refused to believe that his relatives were awful to him. He probably believed that muggles were 'innocent' or some other such bullshit like that.
"Boy! Who do you think you are?" He growled, his face purple from anger. Harry found himself shaking in fear. "You used your freak power on my son! How dare you!" He kicked the smaller boy repeatedly and with increasing viciousness. Harry curled up and tried to protect his body with his arms, crying for forgiveness.
Draco got bored in the library and decided to walk around the castle like he usually does when he has nothing to do besides studying.
“Such a poor soul you are Harry, “ said the dark lot and his eyes locked to the emerald eyes. Harry notice the emerald eyes they have was the same color as him but darker.
“I doubt there will be a golden trio this year, unless the Weasel and the Mudblood are back to being civil with him,” Draco explained. Blaise was shocked while Draco was confused by his friend's reaction.
“Yes, we can. And now get out! Nobody wants you here,” Ron glared at Harry while the smaller boy froze. Harry was still shocked by his ‘friend’s’ behaviour, standing there dumbfounded while the others stared at him.
Harry wondered why he was alive when he was better off dead.
, he couldn't do anything to save himself, to protect himself from his own
"Just hope she didn't turn this school into hell as it is already is," Blaise howl and leaning to his girlfriend beside him
Harry tensed up and turned around, “W-what do you mean? I’m a Gryffindor, so this is my house?” he asks with an apprehensive and confused expression.
Harry froze in place until someone screams their lungs out and he automatically followed by the source of the scream. As he turns around but stopped, before he fully turns around he froze again.
comfortable, don't you think so?" Malcolm walked around Harry who was continuing to weed and ignoring the gang.
He looks at the window and the sun seems to shine again, he just realizes that it was a new day. Harry look at the time and he missed breakfast, he doesn’t feel to eat anything anyway. He wonders what he should do today… there’s nothing he can do except stay there hiding from anyone or go out there and faced everyone, repeat last
Harry sat alone in a carriage on his way to the Castle, the familiar feeling of loneliness sounding inside him. It reminded him of the Dursleys, trapped in a small cupboard for years- he shook his head, wanting to forget about it all, including the most recent trauma he had suffered only days ago. Harry felt disgusting and blamed himself for being weak, it was his fault for letting his guard down, his fault that that had happened.
funny ... now that Draco felt sorry for the golden boy, everyone should praise him, like him, love him.  Now that their topic of conversation was unusual, they never felt sorry for anyone other than their own house mate.
He watch the other him crouch and stare at him creeply
“Are you serious?  Blaise, you missed a lot. where were you last year?" from his smug face Draco knew what his friend had been up to.
Sometimes he wondered how the neighbours never heard his screaming, maybe it was just because of his lack of luck when it came to the Dursleys. Or maybe they just didn't care about the skinny boy who they thought went to a school for criminals.
"Ron…"
How people will react to him when they know who he is,
-------------
“Stop it! “ Harry pleads and crying in pain, the pain lasts longer and he jerks his whole body violently until it's finally over when Voldemort satisfied. Harry was alone again, his body is weak and he barely can bring himself to stand up.
“And our bloody relative, finally I can get revenge on them, “ he said maniacally giggles.
"I'm sorry professor but I don't know," he said softly
“Why would I need something from people like you?” Malfoy shot back. It made Harry flinch, the sentence hit too close to home. It called him useless and reminded him of everything he had heard from the Dursleys and Dumbledore.
"No, I don't want to waste your time Myrtle. It's my problem, I-I have to deal with it myself ... alone…”
"I didn't do anything!" Harry cried. A hefty punch in his stomach made him cough blood out of his mouth. "LIAR!" Growled Vernon.
Harry frow his eyebrows, "What ?! I Won't! Ron please, you are my first friend. I won't hurt you not once," now Harry's eyes were shining as his tears gathered and would slide his cheeks in a few moments.  He held back his tears,
Now he reminded of Sirius ... what would he think of him, he must have hated him right now.  And Remus?  he would agree with Sirius, Father ... mother ... I'm sorry.
‘Stop!’ he cried in his mind, he didn’t want to allow his thoughts to go any further. He looked around, it seemed the sorting ceremony was done because everyone had already filled their plates with food. Harry joined the others in the feast, although he didn’t want to eat anything. He could hear his uncle shouting when Harry attempted to eat more than he was given, the excuse being that they didn't have enough to feed him and that he was an ungrateful brat. Harry grabbed a small portion of food and ate it half-heartedly, at least he filled his stomach with some proper food that wasn't burnt like he was used to.
He tried to stop himself but can’t, he try to push himself screaming tell them to stop, garbing anything like rock but he seem can’t touch anything. He fell useless and panic trying to save Percy. But it’s too late.
Ron let go of him and left the Emerald's eyes standing stiff and in shock.  Harry believed he had heard a small, freak-like whisper from the tall man.  He felt somethings staying him in his chest,  the intense pain in his chest making him hard to breathe .  He wants to be alone now but he is alone, always alone, he runs to Mrytle's bathroom and cries there.  It was so painful, he felt back again in his past.
"Good Morning, Ms Granger. Mr Weasley " she greeted and the two pair greeted back
“PERCY!”
Harry heard that but he cannot seem to find where the source of the voice from. He finally kicks himself mentally and finally moves. He broke his gaze from Cedric’s dead body and look at in front of him. He saw Percy on the ground wandless and seems in panic and scare.
-------------
‘Stupid people’, Harry sprinted away from the crowd clustered in the hallway and ran to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom for a bit of privacy. He puked all his guts out into the toilet in the stall farthest from the door, it made him sick, all of this made him feel sick. He collapsed onto the floor and silently cried. No one believed him.
"May I ask where is Mr Potter at? I've been searching for him in this morning," she thought she heard "Why always him," from the Weasley youngest son.
--------
Draco thought that Weasley planing doing something stupid which is not surprising at all. And then it became silence, Draco wonders why. He peeks beside the wall and he saw no one.
Sometimes he wanted to know what Potter was going through, but his attempts sure didn't work. Potter had rejected his friendship in his first year. He still remembered the pain of being rejected by the person he had always waited for and wanted to meet, an unnatural feeling for a slightly spoiled child.
She stares at the twinkling headmaster eyes sharply and continues "Look how skinny the boy was, how unhealthy the boy was. I don't think they cared for him,"
Well isn't this fucking great, having two best friends who dated each other and ate each others faces out in front of you without any shame whatsoever. And him in the same compartment as them, sometimes he wondered why Pansy wanted a horny guy like Blaise as a boyfriend?
Pansy raised her eyebrow, “That doesn’t sound fun,”
They merely chuckled and continued to the castle.  The first day was the same as their previous years, there was a sorting ceremony, Dumbledore's welcoming speech and also the introduction of a new DADA teacher who looked tacky. Everything about her was pink and prim, making people's eyes hurt just by looking at her. Not to mention her annoying sickly sweet and condescending tone.
His anxiety hit him in a sudden rush and the pressure from it was too much for him to deal with. Harry started to walk faster and faster, but the eyes were still there following him. He could hear his own heart beating louder and faster, threatening to break from his chest.
"The second day at Hogwarts?"  said Blaise as he ate his breakfast, Draco also looked at the Gryffindor table and was snorted and didn't say anything.
Harry ran through the wall leading to platform 9¾, immediately noticing everyone's eyes on him. Staring. Harry internally winced and trudged towards the train, away from the stares he was receiving. He walked slowly, attempting to ignore all the eyes on him. The only thing he could hear was his heart beating faster and faster and harder, it became difficult for him to hear past the rushing in his mind as he tried to keep a low profile.
And thank Merlin it that it did.
"I heard that they were separated because Weasel's brother died and blamed Potter. The funniest thing is that they think Potter is a follower of the dark lord," Pansy replied, snorting.
"You," that voice was familiar, he knew who it was, "Ron?" No answer, "Ron is that you?" Harry felt desperate, the two figures were now more clear. They were his two best friends sporting angry expressions, and staring at Harry with hateful eyes.
He asked himself, did he even sleep anymore? He didn't even notice that his uncle and aunt had ignored him in the past few days like nothing had happened...or maybe they didn't know.
It would have been better if he had never been born
“We’re banning you from the tower, Potter. And we know that you’re up to something,” Ron growled. Harry was shocked, “What?! You can’t do that!” he cried.
In the great hall, he didn’t want to sit close to his "friends", so he sat on the end of the bench farthest away from them and hoped that no one would bother him.
