Harry fought to regain his breath. His back ached from falling asleep sitting up in his bed. “I didn’t see much if I’m honest.”
A low, slow cackle left the house elf as he clicked his fingers. A small, seemingly light, parcel bobbed over Kreachers’ left shoulder until it settled onto the grey fluffy blanket draped across the foot of Harry’s bed.  “Parcel for you Master, yes. There is a note... A note...”
Malfoy’s lips curled slightly at the corners, amused by Hermione’s question. He cleared his throat as he made his way further into the room, his eyes scanning over his other patients, making a quick mental note of their vitals. “Very observant Granger. I imagine Potter downplayed the severity of his injuries to you in a typical Griffindor manner. If Potter arrived in my care a couple of hours later than he did, septicaemia would have kicked in. His fever was already dangerous, and heart rate erratic. Treatment and bone regrowth would have been extremely challenging. We would have been looking at permanent damage in a best- case scenario.”
“I wouldn’t have thought your moral compass allowed for slaves, Potter.” Harry could hear the way smiled into his sentence.
I loved writing this little bit of fluff, but I assure you in the next coming chapters (starting with the next one maybe) you will understand why this has an explicit rating ;)
This had been an important case in the Auror department for quite some time now. The McDougal twins were infamous wizards with vampiric blood. They charmed innocent people to invite them into their houses, before sucking their blood dry and robbing them of prized possessions – selling them in the black market for extreme profit.
Harry sat formally in his chair and waited for his healer to arrive. As if right on cue, Draco had entered the room and searched for immediate clues for what Harry had done to himself this time. Harry watched as Malfoy raised his eyebrow in amusement and folded his arms across his chest. “No vegetable heads today then Potter?”
wrote on your chart that your fever was reaching dangerous levels. I ran another test and it’s slightly feverish, which is expected when a patient is taking healing potions, but no where near the temperature recorded here…”
Every thought and feeling Harry had experienced over the past couple of weeks had led to this night. For the opportunity for Harry to prove himself to Draco that he was worth something. That he was worth Draco’s time.
Harry felt the familiar cold metal press again his chest and the phantom ice burn that followed. His breath hitched in his throat as he stared at the base of Malfoy’s neck. He imagined the dip that lived in the gap between his collarbones, existing beneath his robes. Harry closed his eyes, unable to drink in another moment. It was too much.
All he could think about was the way Malfoy had left. It was more than a healer ending his patient’s treatment.
Malfoy was leant against a door frame with his arms folded across his chest, watching Harry. A stethoscope was hung around his neck, and his wand was tucked behind his left ear. The corner of Malfoy’s lip was raised into what could only be described as devious smirk. Harry’s mouth went dry. Emerald eyes never left platinum as he made his way through the double doors.
He couldn’t stay here. The ticking of the clock on the wall was plucking his last, fraying nerve. He had to go somewhere else, anywhere else, and fast. Harry rose to his feet and made his way to the fireplace. He grabbed a handful of floo powder from the bowl on the mantelpiece and threw it into the fireplace before stepping inside. He let the flames consume him, and his living room swirled away. He wasn’t even sure what address had left his lips.
Harry flashed her a grin as he followed her into the kitchen. As he stepped through the archway the music became louder.
Malfoy’s hands snaked slowly under the hem of Harry’s shirt. Harry felt his face heat up as he turned his face even harder away from Malfoy. Those cold hands trailed slowly up Harry’s sides, until they reached Harry’s ribs. They didn’t move. Malfoy just held Harry like that.
Harry stared at the man, who acted like he had not even noticed that Harry had entered the room. “Where are your robes?”
Forcing himself to move, Harry slowly uncurled his body and put his t-shirt back on. He ignored the way his ribs protested. He felt like he deserved the pain.
“Eliza if you keep fluffing that pillow, I’ll need to treat Potter for an enlarged ego as well, which is already at an obnoxious size. I don’t have all day.” Drawled a posh, sharp tone from the doorway of the room, commanding its attention. Harry’s eyes immediately snapped away from the medi-nurse, who was rolling her eyes playfully as he felt a heat prickle across the tips of his ears.
He couldn’t remember getting ready for work this morning before his mission that resulted in Harry’s arrival at St. Mungo’s in the first place.  “I-I remember putting on underwear but-”
That was all he needed to see. Harry’s eyes squeezed shut and he was seeing stars as the most intense orgasm of his life crashed over him like a strong wave. He came over and over as Malfoy’s hips rolled irrhythmically against his own before Malfoy gradually came to a stop.
Mayford said nothing in response, which unsettled Harry. Her brow was lightly furrowed in thought as she continued to dab Harry’s forehead with the cold, wet cloth.
In the late morning to early afternoon, Harry would always make sure to be in his living room on the ground floor of the house, which conveniently allowed him to lie on the sofa in front of his fireplace. Coincidentally, Malfoy would always emerge out of the fireplace in front of him in a grand entrance of green flames. The first thing Malfoy did as he entered the room is take off his robes, which always made Harry’s blood rush to his face as he would reveal an outfit comprised of tight tailored trousers and a soft looking, yet expensive, jumper. Next, Malfoy would check the contents of Harry’s medical bag, and ask Harry to undress ready for his examination.  Harry then would remove his shirt, probably more eagerly than he should, and would cherish the way Malfoy’s red glowing palms would travel across his torso. Every day he allowed the tall man to heal him, whilst feeling like he was being torn deliciously apart. The length of Malfoy’s stay always varied. The day that followed Harry’s release, Malfoy made no small talk, and left immediately after Harry’s treatment, which confused Harry considering how easy it was to talk to the git after he had given him the chocolate the previous day. Though, the following day Malfoy stayed until the early evening, insisting he had
She smiled softly and kissed Harry’s temple before looking back at Eliza. “Are we able to apparate in here?”
Harry’s faced cracked. He let out a disbelieving laugh, awe struck at Eliza. He rubbed his face with his hands before reaching for his glasses on his nightstand. As he put on his glasses, he could now see that the witch was sporting a pensive expression. Harry playfully shook his head. “You’re such a Ravenclaw.”
Eliza removed the cloth from Harry’s face and placed it into the bowl of water.  “Oh, he’s normally very efficient in keeping patient’s up to date with their progress, maybe he was saving the news for today.”
would spend hours in there, so I became increasingly concerned. I thought he would harm her. I-I…One day I noticed after he entered the room, he left the door slightly ajar. I peaked through the gap and I will never forget what I saw. He was holding one of her hands in both of his and his palms were glowing white. I couldn’t hear the spell from the distance, but I knew that it was kind. It’s difficult to explain but different spells have different scents and well… This one smelt like freshly washed cotton. The old witch was smiling in her sleep. She seemed to be at peace. I knew from that moment on I had to give him a chance. He worked extra hours to ensure his patients, regardless of their blood, were happy; a sign of a remarkable healer, and of a man who deserves redemption.”
Harry heard Ron grinding his teeth, cracking his knuckles absent-mindedly. It had become a nervous tick of Ron’s to click his joints, as if that would relieve his inner tension.
The time was now 7:59pm, and Harry was stood at the door of Malfoy Manner. He swallowed the hard lump that was forming in his dry throat before ringing the doorbell. Harry could have had 10 years to prepare himself for what would welcome him on the other side of the door, but that still wouldn’t have been enough time.
Eliza shook her head and smiled, clearly touched by the pair. “There are anti-apparation wards in here to stop patients disappearing in the night. There’s an apparition point at the end of this corridor. Before we go however, I need to numb Harry’s injuries so he can walk the distance required. Is it okay if I touch you Harry?”
Harry nodded and pressed more of his body weight onto Hermione; he already feeling light-headed from exertion. The palm of Eliza’s hands turned blue as she placed them against Harry’s ribcage. The sensation that followed was peculiar; it felt like Harry’s organs had been lined with pillows. Eliza withdrew her hands and the blue light from her palms disappeared. “Okay, let’s get you home.”
Malfoy raised his brow at Harry, who attempted to sit up straighter in the bed. Harry ignored the minor stab of pain that followed and lifted his chin at Malfoy in defiance.
They both laughed. Ginny impersonated a brutal downwards stabbing motion, grunting violently each time she thrusted down her arm, which made Harry laugh harder than he had in a long time. A weight bubbled out of his chest as he scrunched up his nose as the laugher kept on coming.
12 Grimmauld Palace had become a place that Harry had made his own. Gone were the ghostly relics of the past that haunted the headquarters for the Order, and in its place stood an open and light living space. The familiar troll leg umbrella stand was the first thing that Harry had incinerated, along with the old dark wood furniture tainted with the scars of dark magic. In the Summer following the war, Harry had thrown a bonfire party with his closest family and friends. The late summer breeze rustled through the trees and intermingled with the sound of over layered conversations and laughter, as the wood of the bonfire crackled. Harry fondly remembered Ron throwing the screaming portrait of Walburga Black into the fire. As the portrait burned, Harry raised his beer bottle to the sky as a silent
Ginny blinked. “Okay mister cryptic.” She huffed playfully, rolling her eyes as turned back to face the counter and prepared two cups of tea. “You show up in my apartment in the middle of the day wearing nothing on your feet and still in your pyjamas – not that I’m judging or anything since you’re recovering and all- clearly troubled about something.”
All three sets of eyes looked up, startled at the blonde healer who had silently entered the room. Malfoy was leant against the doorframe of the room, examining his nails, almost looking bored.
Harry found it extremely hard to swallow his mouthful. He felt the heavy, stodgy lump drag down his throat almost painfully. “No. I’m not looking forward to being a prisoner in my own home. I don’t want to sit around and do nothing whilst dangerous criminals are planning their next move.” Harry lowered his voice, staring blankly at the wall in front of him. “I let them get away once, I can’t let it happen again.”
Harry felt his face burn as Malfoy’s gaze travelled across Harry’s torso, a light smile on the corner of his aristocratic mouth. Malfoy held his hand out sideways, his eyes not leaving Harry’s frame. “Accio stethoscope.”
Harry and Ginny stared at each other for several moments, both frozen into place. It was a battle of wills to see who would crack first. Ginny stood in front of the fire with her hands placed on her hips and her eyebrows raised in challenge. Her brown puppy dog eyes were strong and determined, too much like her mother. Harry lifted his chin defiantly as he glared back at her. His brow was furrowed as he drew his knees even tighter to his chest. Their scowls at each other became more intense.
He opened his eyes slowly, letting his world come into focus on Malfoy, who’s grey eyes bore into his own from across the room.
Grey eyes stared intensely into his own once more. The red-light escaping Malfoy’s palms cascaded a flushed tint across Malfoy’s pale skin. His platinum hair shone rose-gold, his eyes a deep metallic. Malfoys lips were dark pink, moving quickly as he uttered the incantations. Malfoy wrapped his fingers around Harry’s sides. His fingertips pressed hard against his flesh. Harry bit down harder on his lip, tasting copper on his tongue. His prick twitched.
A fresh wave of bitterness rolled through Harry, so much that he felt the corner of his lip curl into a snarl. He sipped his coffee to swallow that feeling, resulting in a burnt tongue. “Gee, that’s fucking fantastic. What’s your point here Gin? I made a bad fucking decision trying to jump him after I left your place?”
.” She smirked playfully at Malfoy as she let the pillow drop to the bed with more force than strictly necessary before making her way towards the exit. She stopped short in front of Malfoy, who wore a faint scowl on his face. His eyebrow lifted slightly as he returned her eye contact, staring down at her. Harry watched the back of her head, refusing to look at Malfoy.  Harry could tell she whispered something he couldn’t make out to Malfoy, with her mouth next to his ear. He watched Malfoy’s mouth tighten in response, his jaw setting hard before making his way over to Harry in a long, slow stride. The blonde witch disappeared as Malfoy picked up the clipboard that was attached to the end of Harry’s bed. Harry stared at Malfoy, clutching the white sheets on either side of his legs
After last night Harry wasn’t sure how to convince Malfoy to give him some more of that chocolate. Would it be impolite to ask for some?
Malfoy stepped elegantly out of the fireplace and brushed the non-existent dust off his robes. Harry raised his body slightly and propped himself using his elbows. “Here already?”
Today was different, however. Eliza had left after amusing Harry with her insistence that Luna Lovegood was correct in her theory of the existence of Wrackspurts. But come early afternoon, Malfoy was no-where to be seen.
The softly hazed comfort that firewhiskey provided would eventually lull him into a dreamless sleep, where he would dream of nothing but of crimson hot palms running down his chest, and the snuffed-out embers inside him would roar back to life and engulf him in flames.
Harry’s mind was racing. “I know about the old woman!” He cried out desperately. “The muggleborn witch that you watched over on her deathbed.”
Unable to stop himself, Harry started to close the distance between them. “You came back here didn’t you when I was gone? Were you still on shift then, or was it a personal call?”
Harry sat in his bed, continuing to rest his back against the headboard for what seemed like hours. He absent-mindedly chewed on his nails until he reached the pink nubs of his fingertips. Hermione would kill him if she caught him doing this.
Malfoy folded his arms over his chest and leant back against the closed door. He looked unnervingly calm. Harry gulped. “What are you doing here Potter? I’m working.”
I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter! My last 2 exams are this week so please forgive me if its takes over a week for the next update! (Guess you'll just need to bookmark this story ;) )
To make Harry wait until 8pm felt like asking him to wait an eternity. But hell, if that’s what the handsome pointy git asked for, Harry would have done it.
Btw the song that Ginny was playing in her kitchen was 'We Could Be' by Hunna (I really love this song, so give it a listen if you want)
Harry rolled his eyes, letting out a playful huff. “Believe me, I’ve known it for years. It’s what Malfoy said earlier I-” Harry paused for a moment, hesitant to continue this conversation. “I crossed a line earlier and said something to Malfoy I shouldn’t have.”
Before Harry knew it, it was midday. His healer would be here any minute and Harry tried his best not to be nervous. He brushed his hands down the front of his shirt to stretch out any of the creases in the thin cotton material and took a couple of deep breathes.
The sound of metal cutlery scrapping across porcelain dinner plates filled the awkward silence in the room. Harry cut into his chicken breast and popped a piece into his mouth as he studied the blonde man who was sitting on the opposite end of the table to himself. Malfoy was the embodiment of awkwardness. His shoulders were hunched forward, and his gaze was unmoving from the plate before him. Harry watched as the man nudged his food around his plate with his fork.
A heat, whether formed by shame, guilt or arousal, spread across Harry’s skin. He felt a flush creep across his face and neck. His intake of breath hitched. “Why are you doing this Malfoy?”
“The only thing that matters is that Harry is here now. If you own this ward like you say you do then Harry is receiving an excellent standard of care, even if it is from
The time was 7:54pm, and Harry was stood at the gates of Malfoy Manner. The cold autumnal breeze blew a soft kiss against the exposed skin of Harry’s neck, sending a long shiver to spread down his spine. His hands felt clammy against the silk lining inside of his coat pockets.
Stumbling out of the second fireplace, Harry felt a surge of pain course through his left side. He pressed a hand against his offending ribs and took slow, deep breaths as he collected his bearings.
Harry swallowed the tight ball that had appeared in his throat. His mouth felt dry as he lowered his head and stared at the corner of his blanket. The silence that had grown between the two men was broken by a chesty cough that came from a man a few beds away.
Draco blinked. He adjusted his position and slowly unfolded his arms from his chest, visibly relaxing. “I told you I don’t want to play any games-“
Ron’s eyes gleamed at the change of conversation topic. Ron deserves to talk about his achievements; he made a fine good Auror. In the years following the war, Ron has really shone, and stepped out of his best friend’s shadow. “We think we know the whereabouts to where the McDougal twins disapparated. Kingsley has ordered a stakeout on the outskirts of the perimeter where their safe house could be. We’re making notes on how many people seem to come and go from around there. It’s good progress mate.”
of the wizarding world himself. You are so full of shit Potter, the toilet is jealous. Do me a favour and jump from the roof.”
They both laughed again as Harry playfully shoved her shoulder. Ginny responded by shoving him back before rested her cheek on his shoulder. “What I mean… Is that some people are worth fighting for, don’t you think?”
I'm sorry for the uploading delay, the past month has been so hectic, thank you for all your patience with me!
Hermione ignored Ron’s whine as her honey coloured eyes focused on Harry in a motherly fashion. She gently smoothed his hair in a way she hoped was comforting. “How’re you feeling Harry? Does it still hurt?”
Draco sent a bewildered look at Harry, which simply made Harry laugh harder and wave his hand dismissively. “Don’t ask.”
Harry nodded at these words, looking over Malfoy’s shoulder. He couldn’t look at him, it was torture. He subtly pressed his palm against his groin, pushing down against his ever-present erection. He suddenly felt really vulnerable, with his torso exposed to Malfoy. Cold air blew against his damp skin which caused Harry to shiver.
Thank you for all the kudos and comments so far, and thank you for so many hits on this story - it warms my heart to see it, it really does <3
Here you guys are!! I'm so sorry for the delay between uploading, my first exam is in less than a week so it's been hard trying to balance my time - I made this chapter a little longer to make up for it though so hope you all forgive me <3333
Harry shook his head and cleared his throat. He ignored how Draco’s presence sent sharp, tantalising jolts towards his groin. “You told me not to be late and here you are keeping me on your doorstep with your non-stop talking.” Harry smirked playfully and gestured a bent arm towards Draco for him to hold. “Ready to go?”
This time it was Ginny’s turn to groan. She rubbed her face impatiently with her hands before folding her arms across her chest. “I’ve shacked up with the biggest gossiping Slytherin that has ever graced Hogwarts. You think I wouldn’t find out that some weird shit went down between you and Draco nearly a week ago so now you’re both acting like forbidden lovers in a Shakespeare play?”
Harry knew her words were purposely ambiguous; whether she was referring to his treatment or his bitterly confusing heartbreak was unclear.
Malfoy leant in closer to Harry, whose eyes fluttered to the pale man’s rosy pink lips. “I’m studying your temperature.”
“After you left, I went to see Ginny.” Harry clenched and unclenched his fists at his sides. The nerves that rolled through him were immense.
Every thought and emotion Draco had swallowed in the previous moment was suddenly regurgitated as Draco stared at his
Harry was fully erect now, and he barely noticed that those hands on his body were venturing lower until it too late to stop what happened next.
Harry saw a muscle in the corner of Draco’s mouth twitch before he wetted his lips and regained himself. “Blood isn’t that shade of red, or that sticky looking.”
Unable to stop himself, Harry pressed his mouth hard against Draco’s. Draco’s lips were wet and plump as Harry moved his mouth hard enough against his lips to bruise them. Draco bit down hard on Harry’s bottom lip, trapping it between his teeth. “I fucking hate you.”  He released Harry’s lip and trailed his tongue across the metallic tasting indents from his teeth.
Draco’s eyes widened and his silver irises burned into Harry like a set of headlights. “Dinner.” Draco said slowly. “You did all of this... To ask me out for dinner.”
“When I was examining your temperature, by touching your face, you leant forward. This increase in mobility tells me that your bones are growing back at a rapid pace. It won’t be long until they’re back completely.”
Harry furrowed his brow in confusion before getting up and following his senile house elf down the stairs.
“Either way” Ginny spoke over Harry. “Draco talked about you all the time. You know, squeezing it into conversation when Blaise met him for lunch or whatever. But this past week, Blaise says Draco has rarely left his ward. He’s quiet and irritable and doesn’t mention you at all.” Ginny laughed before suddenly turning to look at Harry with an exaggeratedly serious expression. “He stabbed the lettuce leaf of his salad eight times Harry during his lunch with Blaise on Tuesday…”
“He’s all good to go! This bag contains painkiller tonics and the usual remedies that should help to reduce uncomfortable symptoms in between his potion doses.” Hermione nodded at Eliza. Her brow was furrowed in hard concentration as she took the small black briefcase from the Medi-Nurse. “There is only enough of each remedy and tonic to last him 24 hours at a time, so overdoses or substance abuse is prevented. This supply will be topped up when needed to by his appointed hospital staff, which includes Healer Malfoy, and myself, Medi-Nurse Mayford. If anyone else tries to gain access into Harry’s home stating they are medical staff, contact the hospital immediately. Do you have any questions, Mrs Granger-Weasley?”
Malfoy didn’t say anything. He stared at the floor in front of him, before focusing his stern gaze back onto Harry. Harry watched the man steady himself with a deep breath. “It means you don’t need me anymore. You’re not going back to work - before your Auror heart gets too many ideas. But what it does mean, is that I am not needed here anymore.”
Ginny beamed at Harry before wrapping him up in her arms in a tight hug, which Harry happily returned. “Hey Gin?”
Harry furrowed his brow again, swallowing his heart back down into his stomach. “I wouldn’t mind someone braiding my hair.”
Harry attempted to push Malfoy off, but this only made the man grip him harder. “I knew it was an act. You’re a fake.” A delirious laugh escaped Harry’s chest as he pushed Malfoy back again. Malfoy’s grip loosened momentarily, but he tightened it again, pulling Harry along with him as Harry continued to push him back. “You act like you’re so high and mighty. Like nothing gets to you. I knew you were faking it. You’re a fucking liar
I'm sorry for the delay in between uploading! My 2nd year Uni exams ended this time last week and I just needed time to unwind and start afresh~
“Oh my god you’ve got a big gay crush on the man and you did something stupid.” She muttered softly.
Harry felt his hands tremble in his lap, still fighting his erection. He felt scared and confused and angry and exhausted and
This of course made Ginny laugh harder. So hard in fact, that her face went pink. Harry waited for her laughter to simmer down into scattered chuckles and lifted his head from the table as she wiped the tears from her eyes.
Please Please PLEASE let me know what you guys think of the story so far, I'm so grateful for all your comments and feedback so far <3
Ginny was stood in the archway that joined her living room to her kitchen. Harry watched the way she studied his appearance and couldn’t blame her for the way she drank him in with a mixture of shock, confusion, concern and amusement. “You’re in luck, I’ve just popped the kettle on.” She nodded her head towards the other room and disappeared through the archway.
Please feel free to leave comments, your feedback means a lot to me! I really want to know your opinion of the story so far
Draco’s amusement travelled down to his lips. Harry couldn’t help but stare as Draco wetted his lips before he smirked. “No splinters? No condiments used as a theatrical trick?”
might be a git, but he seems to care a fair bit for you.” Eliza rubbed Harry’s shoulder with her thumb.
Harry adjusted his position on the sofa slightly, turning his head every couple of seconds to the clock on his wall. It was approaching 2pm, and Harry’s ribs were beginning to feel tight. He winced lightly as he sat himself up and made his way towards the armchair next to the fireplace that his hospital bag was sat in. He opened the bag and took out a pain-relieving tonic, secretly loving the feeling of the cold glass against his clammy palm. Harry was sweating lightly as he felt the skelegrow piece together shards of bone like a complicated jigsaw.
Slowly, Harry began to turn his back towards Malfoy and focused his eyes on the white-washed wall now ahead of him. He gulped hard, having a lot of shame to swallow. “Could you untie the knot at the back of my neck. Please? I can’t lift my arms.”
I know I'm teasing you with this chapter, but the next chapter is already in the works so keep an eye out ;)
Harry was sat in the edge of his seat, twiddling his thumbs in his lap. The room was fairly dark so it had taken a moment at first for his eyes to adjust when he was ushered in here by Eliza.
The next few days came and went in a blur. Eliza continued with her regular check-ups, providing Harry with countless small remedies and potions to heal his remaining rib fractures. During their moments together, she continually tried to engage Harry in several conversation topics such as: whether Harry believed magic to be a faction of art or science, why the sky seemed more blue a few days before a thunderstorm, and even why Eliza believed handmade cookies tasted better than those made with magic.
to Sirius, who Harry knew would have loved to have seen this. Harry laughed freely as he watched George and Ginny skip around the fire chanting
A frustrated sigh escaped from Harry. He closed his eyes and began to dismiss Ginny. “Gin I literally just said he doesn’t want me.”
Draco’s platinum hair was styled fashionably. The sides and underneath were short, and the perfectly tussled hair on the top that waved softly across his forehead. He wore a sky-blue silk button up shirt, with the top 2 buttons undone to expose the beautiful alabaster skin of his neck and collarbone. Harry drank in the sight of Draco wearing coal grey trousers, that were deliciously fitted to his slender frame before his eyes rested on his black, dragonhide loafers.
Malfoy blinked. “I don’t have time for these games Potter.” He turned and left the room hastily before Harry was able to change his mind.
patient.  Despite the emotional car crash that Draco was suffering from, his face remained calm and poised, like the gentle ebbing of water that hides the riptide underneath.
The conversation fell into comfortable silence. Once Mayford was satisfied that Harry was safe to be left alone to sleep, she vanished the wet flannel and administered Harry a sleeping draught. Harry felt the calming effects of the potion immediately. The infusion of the potion with the soothing scent of lavender from the plants made Harry feel like he was floating on a raft in calm waters. His eyes fluttered shut, allowing the current of sleep to gently take him. “Thanks, Miss Mayford.”
Harry shifted himself on the sofa, and slowly began to lie down. He winced slightly and chewed on his lip as he felt his ribs groan in protest to his torso being stretched. Harry sighed in relief as he focused his gaze onto the ceiling. He took deep breaths as his discomfort began to roll away.
The image of Malfoy’s snarling face morphed into a vulnerable expression. Draco was panting hard, wide eyed and scared as Harry rubbed small, reassuring circles on his hip bones
Harry pouted and ran his hands up through his hair, away from his face. He rested his elbows on the table and hid his burning face in his hands. “What do I do, Gin?”
“Draco’s been talking about me?” His heart leapt into his throat, pounding hard against his adams’ apple.
This was the first time Harry had seen Malfoy since he testified at his trial following the war. He remembered his sigh of relief as Draco was acquitted of all charges, and the clench of his stomach when Lucius Malfoy had not been so lucky.
“No, you’ve made it very clear, thank you. Oh, and call me Hermione. Mrs Granger-Weasley makes me sound old.”
Taking this as a cue, Harry pulled himself out of his chair and collected their plates. He stood next to Draco, and stacked Draco’s practically full plate on top of his own and placed their cutlery on top. Harry turned his head to the side slightly to look as Malfoy’s face, but Malfoy had turned his face away from Harry. The soft lighting caught the corner of Malfoy’s sharp jaw and his chin, casting a dark shadow beneath them. Harry tore his eyes away and carried their plates into the kitchen. He placed the plates down onto the counter. He would deal with them later. He hesitated for a moment before quickly taking a bottle of wine out of the fridge and two wine glasses from the cabinet nearest the pantry. He held the bottle in one hand and the two glasses by the stems in the other and hurried back into the dining room before he lost his nerve.
Harry smiled sincerely at her in response, still clutching at his sides, which were sharply throbbing in rebellion against every breath. He politely shook his head as she came towards his bed and began fussing with his pillow, fluffing it. “Everything is great, honestly there’s no need to fuss.”
Harry swallowed and nodded, unwrapped his arms from around himself, and knitted his fingers into the bed sheets on either side of him. Immediate regret followed this decision, as Harry opened his eyes in wide alarm at the sensation of heat pressing against his ribcage. Looking down at his body, he saw pale, elegant hands pressed against both sides of his ribcage. The palms were glowing red against his tanned skin. Malfoy was muttering an incantation quietly to himself in a deep, clear tone. Harry’s eyes studied the hands, taking in deep, shaky, gulps of air as a fire spread across his body, threatening to burn him alive. An unfocused gaze travelled up the pale healer’s hands, up his arms, to the graceful set of his shoulders. Like a flower going into bloom, Harry’s eyes met Malfoy’s, and his world came into sudden, sharp focus. With his internal blaze still roaring, Harry felt his lower back begin to dampen. His internal monologue only consisted of the sound a kettle makes when it has come to a boil on the stove, screaming a high-pitched noise. Eyes sculpted from ice stared into his own with such intensity, Harry almost whimpered.
.” Malfoy rolled his eyes as he wrote something down on the chart that was cradled in his arm. “I’ve contacted Granger to tell her that you’re getting sent home today. She knows the conditions of your release, so your aggravating hero complex won’t do you any good, Potter. You’re not going back to work.”
“Your fever will be stubborn to control whilst your body is repairing itself. I’ll have medi-nurse Mayford help you with it. At least just enough to help you sleep tonight.”
is your healer?! As if your luck wasn’t already rotten enough.” Ron shuddered on the chair beside Harry’s bed.
Harry turned his back towards Malfoy again, staring at the same previous spot on the white-washed wall. Harry began to pull his gown up towards his chest. He winced in pain as he reached his stomach, unable to lift his arms any higher. Electricity ran though Harry’s fingers as he felt Malfoy's hands gently overlap his, taking the gown from Harry’s hands. Malfoy lowered his head to rest his chin above Harry’s shoulder as he tied up the gown at the back of Harry’s neck.
Malfoy pulled away, and Harry saw a small wet patch on his jumper above his collarbone, undoubtedly left by Harry. Malfoy’s face was hard and empty. He stood up and went to fetch his robes. “You’ve been through a traumatic experience. You got hit with a curse and you are feeling emotional and out of sorts. I can contact someone in the hospital for mind healer sessions if you need them.”
Harry couldn’t get the image of Malfoy’s shock out of his head. More specifically, the way his grey eyes grew wide and fixated on the bulge that his wrist had unknowingly pressed against.
Harry tucked his legs up to his chest and rested his chin upon his knees. He eyed Ginny like a sulking child, suddenly embarrassed that she caught him looking sad and
“You’re taking the next week off work Potter, possibly two. I figured you’d prefer to heal in the comfort of your home rather than in this place. Did I assume wrong?” Malfoy took Harry’s silence as a cue to continue talking. “As part of your new treatment plan, you will rest at home. I will check up on you and your monitor your progress there. Is that clear?”
Sorry for the delay in between chapters, it was my birthday a few days ago and I have deadlines and exams coming up, so I've been a bit scattered if I'm honest. Of course I've always got time for our angsty boys, so I hope you enjoyed this chapter! (I doubled the length of this chapter compared to the other ones to make up for the time delay).
Harry shifted in his seat and moved closer to Malfoy. As Harry got closer, Malfoy got up and sat in the armchair next to the floo.
on it instead of acting like a lovesick puppy. Honestly, it made me feel a little nauseous watching you
Eliza learnt forward to rest a hand on Harry’s shoulder, giving it a soft squeeze. “It’s for your own good okay? If you resist treatment or go to work before you’re fully recovered it will do much more damage than good. Believe me when I say it would take a lot more time and rigorous treatment to fix you the second time round.
Harry delicately began to undo the lace and opened the wrapping paper. Inside was a dark green button-down shirt made of what appeared to be soft cotton and silk; looking illuminous as it caught the light. The price tag was removed, but Harry knew this was expensive. He hastily removed his t-shirt and tried on the gift.
The cold metal removed itself from Harry’s chest. It was replaced by delicate hands once more pressing themselves against both sides of Harry’s ribcage. A quiet, low incantation began escaping from Malfoy’s lips and heat transferred from his palms into Harry’s skin. A low groan escaped Harry’s mouth. Surprised by his own noise, Harry snapped his eyes open.
Malfoy’s eyes widened comically he stepped back from Harry, looking stricken. “Freckles?! Who do you take me for, a fucking Weasley?”
I know there is a lot of filler in this chapter, but I felt that it was important to submerge you more into Harry's headspace, especially considering this is written in his perspective :))
I love reading your comments and replying to you all! I hope you're all staying safe and healthy, much love <3
The clipped tone of Draco’s tone brought a soft smile to Harry’s lips. Harry pulled Draco in a little tighter towards him
The floo roared behind Harry as he pressed the bottle against his lips. Much too quickly, Harry snapped around to the direction of the noise, just in time to see Malfoy place his robes on the coffee table.
A smirk curled on the corner of Malfoy’s lips as Harry’s eyes widened in embarrassment. “You have such a way with words, Potter.”
This evening was different, however. Harry had assumed his regular position on his sofa, when his floo roared into life. Sitting up eagerly, Harry watched with wide eyes as a silhouette began to form out of the green flames. His breath caught in his throat.
Harry had gotten under Malfoy’s skin. He chewed his bottom lip anxiously as his mind raced back to their earlier conversation. “
Harry’s grin fell onto the house elf that was staring up at him expectantly. “Prepare a tea tray for my guest and I please, peppermint and Earl Grey if we have it.”
The joyous moment cracked back into reality, and Harry didn’t feel like laughing anymore. “He doesn’t want me Gin. He made that perfectly clear.” Harry felt hot tears brim his eyes again, and he shook them away. “Maybe I read the signs wrong, I… I just… Have grown so attached in such a short period of time, I’m probably just horny and confused.” Harry sipped his drink again, letting his words linger in the air.
A strangled moan came from Harry’s throat as he curled his fingers to cup Malfoy’s face. His thumbs rested beneath Draco’s eye sockets, stroking his cheekbones softly as he deepened the kiss. “No, you don’t.” A long whine escaped Draco’s lips as Harry caught his tongue and sucked on it harshly, bobbing his head as he did so.
Draco stopped outside of Room 3 and placed his hand on the handle. The white blinds were drawn closed on the window next to the door, which Draco immediately thought was suspicious at this time of day.
Please please PLEASE let me know what you guys think of the story so far, there is a LOT more to come!! I'm really excited to share it with you guys <3
Malfoy gently stroked Harry’s cheekbones with his thumbs and tilted his head softly to the side. Harry closed his eyes as he felt the pad of Malfoy’s thumb rest beneath his eye socket.
Harry let out a relieved breath that he wasn’t aware he was holding. “Wait ‘till Ron hears I’m back on the case with him, he’s gonna be so-“
It had been ten minutes after Hermione left when his floo activated. Harry was led on the sofa, with the taste of liquorice still on his tongue from the pain relief tonic Hermione had made him drink, when the green flames roared.
Harry began to close the distance between the two of them and despite Malfoy haughtily raising his chin, he didn’t make an effort to move away.
“Okay… Well first thing first, you really need to start dating people again if a healer examination makes you wanna cum-“
Thank you so much for your continued support with this fic, it honestly means the world to me, and makes me want to continue working on this and take you all on this journey with me <3
Ginny snorted and rolled her eyes. “Yes Hazza, Draco has been writing poems about you, and telling Blaise how he wants to braid your curly mop.”
Harry felt the plunging feeling of guilt settle in his gut. “They apparated because of me. If I had just dodged that curse they wouldn’t have had the chance to get away. They’d be under veritaserum right now, facing a possible life sentence is Azkaban.”
It wasn’t long until Harry had a light perspiration across his forehead, feeling his stomach sinking in a panic.
Malfoy shoved Harry hard. Harry drank in his dishevelled appearance as he stumbled back a few steps. His pupils were completely blown out from lust, with only a faint band of grey circling them. His cheeks were pink, and his lips were red and swollen. He looked vampiric and dangerous. They stayed like that for a moment, staring at each other whilst taking in deep breaths. The electricity between them crackled around the room. Harry’s cock was hard and leaking in his pants. He broke the eye contact to see that Malfoy’s cock was straining against his trousers too.
Ooooo how exciting!! I'm so sorry for making you wait so long, I'm in my final year at university and deadlines have been kicking my arse XD
“Side effects of skelegrow include irritability and drowsiness. I’ll have Eliza get you that pepper-up potion and some toast. Keep your fluids up Potter.” Malfoy took out his wand and pointed it at the glass of water on Harry’s bedside table. A soft “
on the mugs before they hit the ground. The mugs flew back up into Harry’s hands and he offered Ginny the red mug with fluttering snitches on it.  After a moment, Ginny slowly reached out to take the mug from Harry. She clutched it in both hands and cradled it in front of her chest. Her face was the image of shock, with her freckles even more vibrant with her skin paled.
Harry whirled out of his minds-eye back into the room. Mayford was dabbing a cold damp flannel against his forehead, stood at his bedside. The smell of spearmint filled his nose as she softly muttered a diagnostics charm. “Now that’s odd.”
“Eliza kept insisting that Loony Lovegood's theory of bloody wrackspurts needed to receive funding from the board. I swear that girl has fairies in her head…”
Harry closed his mouth and sucked on the square of chocolate. It coated his tongue in a thick, delicious film that warmed up his insides. “Mm… S’ amazing…Where’d you get it?”
Harry felt ridiculous for his heartache. It felt stupid to be mourning over the loss of someone who was very much alive, and to miss someone whose company only confused you.
“You’d think our saviour’s luck would have run out by now. Defeating the Darkest Wizard of our time would normally drain anybody of their lucky streak. But not
Eliza stepped out of Room 3 and closed the door behind her. Their eyes met as they walked past one another and a momentary expression crossed her face that Draco couldn’t decipher.
Harry felt the heat rise back into his cheeks; self-conscious Malfoy would feel the change in temperature underneath his palms. “I’m a model patient what can I say?” Harry’s gaze mirrored Malfoy’s, challenging him. Harry leant forward, wincing slightly in pain, to lean more into Malfoy’s touch. The pad of Malfoy’s thumbs travelled down Harry’s cheek bones, until they rested on the corners of Harry’s jawline. Malfoy’s eyes never left Harry’s face as he cupped his jaw with his hands. A delicious shiver went down Harry’s spine.
Harry allowed one shallow laugh to escape him before his mind raced back to that night with Draco once more, and his heart was once again swallowed by grief. “Her name was Maggie, Eliza.”
Harry thought again of the lonely island lost at sea. He thought of the lighthouse and found himself encased within its light.
Regardless of how long Malfoy decided to stay for, Harry’s routine after he left was always consistent. The moment Malfoy disappeared through the floo, Harry would stare longingly at the place where the man no longer stood. Harry’s cock would ache torturously as he would drag his damaged body to the master bathroom on the second floor. There, he would have a hot shower, and let the water trickle down the back of his neck as he would hang his head forward beneath the water.  The palm of his hand would be stretched out on the wall in front of him. In his other hand, would be his throbbing erection, that he would begin to fist slowly, until flashing images of short blonde hair and the feeling of strong, aristocratic hands on his body came into his mind, making him tug himself harder. Harry would squeeze his eyes shut and moan deeply at the thought of those grey eyes fluttering and staring up at him with blown out pupils, as Malfoy would close his lips over Harry’s cock, taking it deeply. It was this image of Malfoy on his knees with hollowed, blushing cheeks, that made Harry’s balls tighten and cause him to cum hard against the shower tiles.
“Harry said he was fine. What’s his real condition like Malfoy?” Hermione removed her fingers from Harry’s hair and turned in her seat to face Malfoy. Harry chewed his bottom lip, sparing a glance at the back of Hermione’s head, before snapping his eyes back to Malfoy’s face.
“I know Eliza gave you a lot of standard pain-relieving remedies in your hospital bag, but personally I can’t imagine you being a huge fan of liquorice.”
The eyes that bore into his chest snapped up to meet his own. Malfoy’s brow was furrowed in light confusion. “Pardon?”
“You need this Harry.” Draco’s voice cracked and sounded almost as quiet as Harry’s. “You need distance.”
Malfoy was leant forward in his seat to set his cup back onto the tray on the table. “We’ve delayed it long enough. Take off your shirt, Potter, it’s time for your assessment.”
Harry had already prepared a pot of peppermint tea which sat brewing on his living room table with a spare mug sat next to the pot. He sat on the edge of his sofa and grabbed his own mug of earl grey tea. He blew against the rim of the cup before taking a short sip. The mixture of bitterness and citrus mixed on his tongue, washing away the remnants of liquorice.
Harry heard the scrapping of chairs and departing footsteps. He took a deep breath to steady himself, suddenly feeling dizzy and overwhelmed.
Eliza laughed and her blue eyes twinkled under the ceiling light. “Home treatment is considered quite a privilege. You get the undivided attention of Healers and Medi-Nurses in the comfort of your own home.
A bird squawked from a tree overhead of Harry, startling him back into the present. A panicked tempus charm was cast.
“I suppose it’s also against the conditions to get a hard on over my healer, but here we are.”  Harry was stood directly in front of Malfoy, so close that their noses were nearly touching. Feeling petty, Harry smacked the clipboard out of Malfoy’s hands. It bounced off the corner of the table before hitting the floor.
Harry sighed as he chewed half-heartedly on a slice of toast. “I’m not irritable, Malfoy is just annoying.”
It had felt amazing to see life behind Draco’s eyes again. The last time Harry had seen that flame in his eyes was during Hogwarts, when Harry had raced Draco to grab the snitch. He would never forget the determined focus on Malfoy’s face as his fingers reached forward to grab the flying golden ball. The way his hair was thoroughly windswept, and the way the cold air tainted his cheekbones pink. Truth be told, during 6
Every evening Harry sat on the sofa in front of the fireplace and waited. He waited for things to make sense again. He waited for the dull thud in his chest to stop. He waited for a tall blonde git to waltz back into the room and make everything feel normal again.
Harry’s face broke into a playful grin, and felt his sexual tension disintegrate. “Well, the gene pool for purebloods is very shallow. Ron is basically your cousin. Would you spend Christmas at The Burrow with all your extended family Malfoy?.” The laughter erupted from Harry harder as Malfoy’s skin grew impossibly paler. It was when Malfoy’s mouth hung open to speak that Harry’s laughter began to die down, and his gaze lowered to the man’s dusty pink lips.
“I’ve performed a complete internal diagnostic of your condition Potter. It’s not good I’m afraid. High fever and erratic heart rate agree that your body is in severe shock and internal distress. From simple touch I was able to locate the places where your ribs are absent, 3 in total, by the way, Potter. The initial round of healing charms seems to be successful in removing most of the pain, but a couple doses of skelegrow need to be administered to you over the course of several hours. Perhaps maybe days? I’ll have someone contact the Ministry on your behalf.”
Harry’s bodily visibly recoiled in shock, taken back by the demand. He raised his voice. “Malfoy I said-“
Harry thought again of the man who sat across from him at his dining room table that previous night.
Eliza laughed and sat down on the edge of Harry’s bed. She placed a comforting hand on Harry leg and regarded him with a soft smile. As she tilted her head thoughtfully, her loosely tied up waves dangled around her ear and swayed with her head movement.  She offered Harry the potion with her free hand, and he took a short swig. The taste of liquorice bubbled on his tongue. “When I was younger, I always had thought that I see people for who they are. But when I first met
Harry threw floo powder into the fireplace and stepped inside. He watched Ginny’s living room spin until it disappeared, and his own living room appeared in its place.
If someone could bottle the uncontrollable joy that appeared across Harry’s face, they would be a millionaire.
Malfoy let out a slow sigh, closing his eyes as he did it for dramatic effect. “I know the name of my colleague, Potter.” Malfoy opened his eyes and paused for a moment, examining Harry’s face. “Do you want a pepper-up potion?”
How long had these feelings been living within Harry? He had been obsessed with his childhood rival throughout his entire stay at Hogwarts. He knew so much about the git. He knew that Malfoy had a sweet tooth from the frequent parcels full of sweets that were sent to him by his parents. He knew that Malfoy’s skin developed a grey tint when he was nervous. He knew that Malfoy never blushed, instead his entire face would flush pink if he was embarrassed.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry’s sudden change in demeanour. Harry deduced from the upturned corners of his mouth, that Draco must be pleased. Draco took Harry’s arm, wrapping his hand around it, following Harry’s lead down the steps. If Harry didn’t know any better, he would have thought Draco’s tight grip, and the subtle movements of his hand meant that Draco was trying to feel Harry’s muscles under his clothes. If Harry’s gaze wasn’t tunnelled on the steps before him, so determined not to trip in front of Malfoy, perhaps Harry would have noticed that Draco was staring at Harry from the corner of his eye. His gaze was fixated, making his slow way down Harry’s body- starting from the hair, to the earring, to his lips, to the shirt...
“Medi-Nurse Mayford informed me about your fever. It’s amazing how it broke in such little time, hm?”
Malfoy was clenching his jaw so hard that Harry feared his teeth would smash. Malfoy didn’t attempt to create more distance as Harry approached him, however. “I came here to tell you that it’s against the conditions of your home visits that you leave your home.”
The voice from the unannounced presence had startled Harry. It caused him to turn around in a panic, drawing his wand from his back pocket. He immediately lowered his wand and sighed towards the floor. “Not now Kreacher, I promise I’ll pick everything up before I leave tonight.”
a bottle of water from Harry’s fridge with her hand outstretched to the side. The moment the bottle was in her hand she immediately unscrewed the lid and took large gulps, clearing out her throat. She gave a relieved sigh before screwing the lid back on and placing the bottle, which sagged slightly to the side because of her vice-like grip, onto the table. “Yeah right, and I’m the queen of Egypt,
year. He is callous, cruel, and vain.  Malfoy is emotionless and purely analytical. Malfoy is ambitious and twisted; distant and untouchable.
by Malfoy, had provided Harry with a hospital gown. She also provided him with his first couple of skelegrow potions. The back of Harry’s throat fizzed unpleasantly at the memory, the taste of liquorice still coating the back of his tongue.
“Ron told me you were in the hospital, you alright?” The mugs lived in the top cupboard. Ginny had to jump and lock her wrist against the worktop in order to push herself up to reach them. It would have been so much easier to bring them down with magic but Ginny always stubbornly refused to give in. She wouldn’t give Blaise the satisfaction that he was right about the cupboard being too high up.
Ginny’s shoulders began to shake, which made the table rattle. Harry turned his head to the side to see that she had covered her mouth with her hand. He watched her half-hearted attempt to stop the laugher from roaring out of her.
Fearing for the safety of his arse, Harry admitted defeat and hastily jumped up to his feet. He groaned moodily at Ginny and glared even harder at her. He ran his hands back through his dishevelled hair and began pacing the room. “For fucks sake what do you want Gin?!”
Malfoy walked over and lowered himself slowly onto his knees in front of Harry. Harry refused to meet the man’s gaze, turning his face away from Malfoy. He saw those grey eyes studying him in his peripheral vision, and he wished more than anything that they weren’t the most striking colour he had seen.
The time was 7:57pm and Harry was stood at the gates of Malfoy Manner. He began to walk up the path towards the looming house, which was painted a soft eggshell white these days; it was a lot more welcoming than it once was.
Harry’s swallowed his mouthful and winced as the bitter taste of liquorice travelled down his throat, before turning back to place the bottle back in the bag. “If you need to unwind for a bit, I can have Kreacher bring us in some tea.” Harry heard the movement behind him stop for a moment.
Harry let a bright grin spread across his face. “The moment my feet touched the ground she shoved the bottle down my throat.”
Harry closed his eyes and sighed. Truth be told, he felt exhausted. A headache was beginning to form behind his eyes. “I should be heading off now.”
“Harry don’t be too hard on yourself. Vampire-wizard hybrids are extremely powerful. It would have been impossible for that curse to miss you. We should all be thankful that it removed some of your ribs, not all of them like intended.” Hermione’s eyes watered lightly, chewing on her bottom lip thoughtfully.
A mixture of emotions spread throughout Harry’s body with such force and intensity that he had gotten whiplash. “No. No you don’t get to fucking do this.”
Harry couldn’t blame him for acting this way. Not really. Just over an hour ago they had both told the other to practically drop dead whilst violently snogging. Malfoy had every right to look as sullen and awkward as he does.
Harry tried his best to continue with his day. He showered, but he couldn’t bring himself to wank. Every time Harry closed his eyes and saw Malfoy on his knees, the self-disgust he felt overpowered his arousal. He tried cracking on with paperwork, but his mind refused to focus on the words in front of him. The most productive thing that he did was charm a consent form into an origami crane. But even the crane fluttered out of the room and left him.
This chapter needed emotional depth to try and emphasise how complicated their relationship is. They have such a rich dynamic and history that it is such an honour to explore that on this journey with you guys <3
The Jr. Healer recoiled at Draco’s snappish tone and nodded feverishly. “Understood completely Healer Malfoy.”
She stared down at the ceramic shards on the floor and huffed. “Oh shit on it.” She grabbed her wand from the back pocket of her dungarees and casted a
Kreacher led Harry to the bottom floor. As Harry walked down the hallway, Kreacher opened the living room door and bowed so low that his nose brushed the floor.
Harry entered the room to see Draco Malfoy stood in front of the fire, reading a clipboard that he was holding in his hands. He was wearing his normal muggle attire, consisting of a burgundy jumper and black tailored trousers.
“You most definitely are horny there’s no denying that.” Ginny agreed unphased as she sipped her coffee.
A couple of hours later, an owl greeted Harry at his office window. It carried a letter of agreement for Harry’s next phase of treatment that he had to sign, and a small bar of chocolate wrapped in white packaging.
Harry swallowed before opening his mouth and hesitantly sticking out his tongue. Malfoy came and knelt before Harry on the floor. Harry adjusted his position slightly, staying with his body weight resting on his elbows. Malfoy was so close to Harry that they must have been sharing the same breath. Harry felt a heat spread across his skin so intensely that he closed his eyes. A soft pant escaped his lips as the heat spread to his crotch. There was nothing that Harry wanted more than for the blonde to close the remaining painful distance between them and suck on his tongue with such force that his cheeks would hollow. Harry’s breath hitched at the dirty image in his mind.
“I’m okay ‘Mione.  I suffered worse injuries in school from Quidditch remember? It’s not really that bad.”
Malfoy’s voice was deep and clear as he spoke. Harry’s erection throbbed as he felt Malfoy’s lips brush against his ear. “Bellatrix was a monster. She was also my mother’s sister, but she was no family of mine.
“Malfoy put his hands that low because he wanted to. To be honest it sounds like he’s been enjoying those examinations almost as much as you have. I mean come on, Hazza. There are plenty of charms that would carry out those examinations without physical touch. Why would he use one that required touching? Why would he use that exact spell, in your house alone with you?”
Harry sighed and shook his head playfully. “He came with the house. Honestly, just consider him part of the furniture.” Harry turned his head to look over his shoulder and felt his stomach fizzle in shock. Malfoy had approached Harry and was now stood right behind him. The breath in Harry’s chest hitched violently as he took this moment to evaluate Malfoy up close. The Healer was slightly taller than himself, about an inch or so. Flecks of celeste blue were scattered amongst those light grey eyes, and there was not a single freckle or blemish to be found across his marble skin. The sides of his hair were cut fashionably short whilst remaining long on the top, allowing for soft blonde waves to roll onto his forehead. Malfoy’s once pointed features still looked sharp, but handsomely so.
Harry awoke with a start, panting heavily. His skin was shining from sweat. The first flickers of sunlight were coming into the room from the window, colouring the room in soft golden tones. Harry jolted from shock as he noticed the tall figure that stood beside his bed with their back against the wall.
Thank you so much for nearly 3K hits, that number to me is absolutely crazy, and I am so so grateful to every one who has read this story so far, and also to those who have left kudos and comments <3
Malfoy snapped his eyes away from Harry’s to stare down at Harry’s tenting erection, before recoiling his hand as if he was burnt.  Malfoy must have suddenly been aware that he was staring, as he tore his eyes away and shook his head violently. A long, shaky breath left the healer as he rubbed his face in his hands, before running them back through his hair. In an instant Malfoy was walking and grabbing his robes. His voice was strained, but still composed. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Potter.”
Once the knot was tied, Malfoy stepped away from Harry and Harry immediately missed his presence. “Medi-Nurse Mayford will be here shortly. Rest up.”
charm casted by Malfoy caused Harry to choke on his unfinished sentence. Malfoy perched on the arm of Harry’s sofa and reviewed his chart. Harry frowned and frantically tried to shout at Malfoy for being an utter prick. After a moment, Malfoy put down Harry’s chart and casted a
into her skin. You don’t owe her any kind of respect or repentance, do you?” The room fell deathly silent. The ticking of the clock was loud and far apart like thunder; time had slowed down. Harry breathed hard as if his lungs had run out of air.
“I’m not traumatised Draco. You’ve got a lighthouse and I can see the light and I think I’m in lov-“
Harry could not go back to sleep after his conversation with Malfoy. Despite the minimal amount of sleep his body was running on, he felt wired awake and anxious.
appear in front of them in blue, digital-clock style font. “Finish your breakfast Harry, and I’ll get everything ready for you.”
“I never asked for her to defend me Potter. I don’t need an army of little Gryffindors fighting my corner.  I don’t suddenly owe her-“
Harry’s mind was racing so fast he couldn’t consciously keep up with his thoughts. “You’re an island. You’re an island with a lighthouse. And you make really nice chocolate. Don’t leave me again, I need this, I need you.”
They had reached the fountain and Ginny sat down on the iron bench in front of it. She took a sip of her drink and temporarily looked lost in thought as she stared into the water. Harry clenched his jaw and sat next to her, taking another sip.
Harry called out her name out into the empty room. “Gin? You home?” He pressed his hand against his side harder as he walked further out into the room. He heard rain hit the windows, modern-rock music playing in another room and the scurrying of approaching footsteps.
I'll update again before the end of christmas break, so make sure you leave some comments and bookmark this story before then to have your say, and to make sure you see the update ;)
Harry removed his abused fingers from his mouth, running them messily up through his hair before clutching the white sheets beside him. He tipped his head back against the headboard with way more force than was needed and closed his eyes as the dull throbbing ricocheted through his brain. The room felt like it was spinning on a tilt, making Harry feel slightly nauseous.
Harry was sat up now, stretching out his hand trying to reach Malfoy. “No no no no Malfoy wait I can explain just-“
? In hindsight, he should have questioned the young Healer about what injury this patient had, but he was just too fucking angry to even string two coherent thoughts together.
“Frequent fever spells during the night, however still substantially lower than during your stay in the hospital...”
Harry took a sip of water, wetting his mouth before smiling back up at her. “I feel like a sack of shit, truth be told.”
I’ve never seen him like that before if I’m honest. Normally he’s so calm and collected. But when I saw him…” She laughed to herself once more. “He definitely looked rattled.”
“Keep your nose out of things that you do not understand! I know that you’ve been pestering Greg and snooping around, thinking yourself so clever. Well, keep out of our way or you’ll regret it.”
At one point, James' difficult face on the sofa morphed into Malfoy's, who used to sit on the very same sofa decades ago. The blond hair, the posture, the furrowed eyebrows were suddenly all so familiar. Somehow, the clock chiming pulled Harry out of the memory like a Portkey and he blinked, not sure if James had said anything during his daydream. By the look of the stiff posture, that seemed not to be the case. Still, the atmosphere was wearing Harry down, and since his son did not seem to plan to talk any time soon, he finally spoke, the sound seemed to break the fragile glass case surrounding them both.
The spouses decorated the nursery with enthusiasm, happily filled up the once-emptied room with baby furniture and re-painted the room with flying griffins and unicorns.
Then, one of the spells hit him, and Draco experienced the most excruciating pain of his short life. He soon found himself lying in a pool of his own blood, chest badly slashed as if gorged by a rampaged dragon, limbs paralysed from pain, ears and eyes filled with a frantically screaming Potter. He idly wondered whether Dumbledore would be upset at his Golden Boy for unknowingly killing his back-up life battery and whether Pansy would make good of her many creative ideas to avenge his death. He sort of wanted to hysterically laugh at the irony of the situation, but his throat really could not move. Then he heard Snape’s gravelly voice and blissfully slipped into unconsciousness.
Weeks went by and he was got a torrent of visitors. Ron, who sneaked in treats for him from the kitchen. Hermione, who dashed in and out like a fluttering bird, coming to see him at least twice a day. Then Arthur and Molly and the other Weasleys, Neville and Dean and Seamus, even Luna took it upon themselves to keep him well-supplied with news and gossips.
They managed to destroy the Diadem, but was not fast enough to save Vincent and Greg. Then, as they headed towards the Castle entrance, passing by Nagini’s dead remains, Voldermort’s voice booming in their ears, Draco saw the look on Harry’s face.
"Wouldn't patient confidentiality prevent them from doing any of this in the first place, or an Unbreakable Vow? Surely there are ways to keep this hushed up."
Draco and his parents spent the summer of his seventeenth birthday at Grimmauld’s Place. Moments after their return from King’s Cross, Professor Lupin and Moody came knocking at their door and demanded that they packed. They told them that it was per Dumbledore’s instructions, that Draco and his family was to be put under the Order’s protection. The mistrust in their eyes told Draco that they were unaware of the true reason for such bizarre wishes. Draco was surprised that they let his parents stayed with him instead of just whisking him away alone, but he guessed that they supposed it was better for them if his parents were not free to be in cahoots with the Dark Lord. They arrived at Grimmauld’s Place to a dusty and dank living room, the fireplace ringed by a circle of suspicious eyes and mumbled swearing. But no one actually threw them a curse, so he supposed it could have been worse.
Two years later, when James walked out of the hospital room carrying a small bundle in his arm, Harry broke out into a huge grin when he saw the black mop on the baby's tiny head. He cradled the boy in his arms and rocked him carefully, grandfatherly pride obviously sparkled in his eyes.
Then, as the Hogwarts years went by and Potter, while getting himself into peril every school year like clockwork, never actually died, Draco supposed he could give the guy some slack. For awhile, Draco thought that Dumbledore had told Potter about the bond, that Potter did not have to fear mortal danger while there was literally a back-up life in reserve. That gave a bitter taste in his mouth, but then he overheard a conversation between the Golden Trio sometime in the middle of their Third Year, frantically whispered in a corner of the Library admist the general fear of Dementors and Sirius Black on the loose, and realised that Potter too was scared like everybody else. Then, as he pieced together Potter’s adventures from gossips, he started to feel sorry for Potter. All the grievances that he himself had wondered about in his childhood, Potter was now living them. While Potter was not innocent of some of the things he found himself in, danger did seek him out despite his best intent and the guy was only trying his best not to die in the process. Draco supposed that they were not so different after all, two boys whose fates were preordained for death and explicably out of their control.
Pansy was also a pain in the arse who was unaccustomed to being challenged in anything, which was endearing to mildly annoying depending on the day. Normally he could shake it off and moved on, but eventually it came a day when her nagging finally chafed at his nerve, which was already frayed from an earlier encounter with the Golden Trio. For once, he was not trying to pick on them, but Weasley thought it prudent to send a hex his way anyway.
article so early in the morning? Harry as good as destroyed half of their sitting room with his wild magic before barely calming down in the presence of a frightened Albus. James was not surprised by his father's reaction, but was mildly concerned by its extend: it was more extreme than anything he had ever seen, one that could not be explained by school rivalry alone. He knew that his father was horribly displeased with his decision and it would be so much easier to follow his will. However, strangely enough, James wanted the inheritance, not for its many gold vaults nor endless estates nor invaluable heirlooms, but just pure want, like a child wishing for his first cycling lesson. Somewhere deep in his mind told him that he deserved it, for what reasons he could not tell.
“We speculate that by the time Albus was brought to shore, Mr. Malfoy was already exhausted from the current strength and the cold water. Apparently there was a fallen log travelling downstream aiming at his direction, but we don't think he was in any mind to pay attention to it. According to witnesses, it hit him at the back of his head right after the child was out of the water. It is likely that the impact killed him immediately.”
They never told anyone about the truth of James' birth, not even to the Weasley family. The media had no trouble believing Ginny's made-up story, how she was under Healer's order to stay inside all through her pregnancy due to poor health, how she went into labour in late December and gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. The Weasleys, satisfied with the idea of a secret surrogacy, were understanding of tight-lipped the couple were, given the many failures that preceeded. As far as they were aware, James Sirius Potter was the son of Harry and Ginny Potter.
It was Ginny at the end of the rope when she visited Harry at work one day and found Malfoy quietly but constantly watching her husband from a distant table in the cafeteria at lunch. As she laid in Harry's arms later that night, she recalled the fierce stormy gaze and could not help but wonder.
Days later, when Edward stood in front of a freshly-dug grave, nestled between other lily-covered tombstones, he spoke of a man with a brave and kind heart, who never had a family but loved his friends’ children as if they were his own, who worked tirelessly for the good of everyone, wizards and witches and Muggles alike. He spoke of fond childhood memories of trips to the zoo, to museums and galleries, of impromptu Quiddich matches and of stargazing nights. He spoke of the man’s parting moments, eyes closed with a smile on his face, surrounded by comfort and the things he loved.
Later, when Albus dozed off once more, though Harry bet that he was only faking it to avoid the constant attention, the adults left the room and really breathed out in relief. Only then did they take in the presence of a young Auror waiting for them patiently in the corridor, looking as if he did not know if it was acceptable to interrupt the emotional moment of the Potter family. When Harry beckoned him towards them, the man seemed obviously relieved. He greeted them politely and asked the family to follow him, all the while recounting details of the accident. Apparently Albus' kindergarten class had a field trip down the river bank this morning. One moment when the teachers were looking elsewhere, the boy had ventured down the river with a couple of other children. It seemed to be purely an accident, but Albus fell into the river and was quickly submerged due to the strong current, even though the boy did know how to swim. While the teachers were calling for help and trying to calm the other children down, a man had jumped into the river after the child. After a while struggling with the current, he was able to bring the boy to shore. Fortunately the boy, while stiff frozen and hardly breathing, still had his heartbeat and was taken to St. Mungo's as fast as possible.
Years later, on one sleepless nights tucked in the Room of Requirement with Potter, he found out that it was the night a Basilisk almost killed the Boy Who Lived.
“He was nothing but a Malfoy. He was the one that tormented me, your aunts and uncles for years; he was the one who tried to kill Dumbledore; he was the one who let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, hell, he was a Death Eater himself. He was the shameless slut that had been staring at my arse for months even when he knew I was happily married to your mother. He had never deserved you, James...”
She heard him groaned pitifully into the flame, agitated that the fact that he had not been able to reach his son for the last three days. He was about to pull out of the fireplace before turning back abruptly, as if just recalling something.
Malfoy gathered his long overdue holidays and applied for a year-long leave at the same time Ginny started to stay home more often, only venturing out with a charmed pregnant belly.
Which meant, there was a very high chance that Draco would soon meet his end. And call it morbid curiosity, but he wanted to know how his demise would come to be. The suspense of waiting back at Grimmauld’s Place was killing him anyway, so he might as well made the most of the time left. And so, when Mother was momentarily distracted by all the coming and going Order members, Draco sneaked away and Flooed to the Hogwarts Headmaster’s Office. The first voice he heard when he emerged on the other side, funnily enough, was Pansy, apparently yelling at their old Head of House, demanding access to his Floo network to talk to him. Pansy’s voice was cut off mid-sentence as the two of them watched him stumbling out of the fireplace with a sheepish face.
At first, the words did not register with him. Then, his brain caught up to his words, spoken out loud for the first time in his life. Pansy’s silence dragged on. Finally, with dread, he turned around to her and learned from her face what devastation looked like.
James was suddenly leaning towards him and stared at him straight in the eyes. Harry flinched, seeing his own son so threatening.
Underneath the night-stand in the master bedroom, there was a metal ring laying still. A fine layer of dust had settled on it from being untouched for years.
“It's almost surreal when I imagine your face looking just like this when you saw mum the first time after I was born”, James mused when he and his father sat by the new mother, finally letting her hold the baby.
What Harry saw was a heartbreaking streak of pain across his son's eyes and it felt like he really did break something very fragile in this very room.
Later, he abstractly watched their interaction in the train carriage as it unfolded, as if looking in through a fogged window. As he saw Potter turning away towards his supposedly chosen friends, he did feel a twinge of regret. He wanted to say that he was sorry, that he only wished to make himself acquainted to the boy. But something tied his tongue.
After dessert, as usual when Harry came to visit, Albus quickly claimed the space next to his grandfather's side on the couch and begged him to tell a story about his Hogwarts days. Albus had always been more fascinated with Harry's heroic tales than his father ever was. Initially, Harry did start with a more truthful version of the stories, complete with all the faults and wrongdoings he committed. However, as Albus was quick to dismiss the thought that his grandfather could do any wrong, Harry began to gradually and unconsciously removed the more insignificant details and added more little white lies, eventually weaving a completely perfect image of Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived. He had never thought it was wrong; after all, what was some fabrication in a children's story? As Harry held his steaming cup of coffee in his hand, trying to keep it from spilling and looking fondly at his grandson, James suddenly appeared by their side. The blond placed a hand on his son's shoulder and asked him to go up to his room.
For all of the time that he had spent thinking about the meaning of his life, never had he envisioned meeting Potter for real. Intellectually, he knew that they were of the same age, that they were most likely going to attend Hogwarts together, that at some point they would have come across one another within the Magic community. He knew that Potter had his mother’s eyes and his father’s hair and a lightning bolt scar on his forehead and if knowing else, he knew that the link between them would would set Potter out like a beacon among the crowd. Yet, for all that he knew Harry Potter was the person in whose hands his demise was held, he had never taken a real shape in his mind, for how could a single human being had such power over the life of another?
Which was why it was such a shock to see Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy on the other side of the door on a Sunday morning. Both of them were in expensive robes, their coffers obviously untouched by the war, and they looked as if they wanted to be anywhere but here. The words when they spoke, however, were sincere.
Then, on a summer night shortly after Draco’s fourth birthday, Father and Mother set him down on the stiff lounge in Father’s study and told him a secret. This was the first thing that Father’s said: “You are meant to die for Harry Potter.”
“Look, James, if you have something to tell me, do so. You were all but lashing at Albus earlier, why keep silent now when you can finally talk to me without others' presence?”
Diane was equally confused when he told her that night but also did not see this as strictly a bad thing. Draco Malfoy had been anything but a scheming plotter for the last two decades of his life. He was solitary and quiet unless work was involved. He had worked his well-earned way to the top of his department using nothing but his skills and talents. He had no scandals of any kind nor trouble with the Ministry whatsoever. It was hard to look at the man and imagine him planting a huge trap for the son of an old school rival for no apparent reason. Still, they agreed that caution was necessary and had the estates and heirlooms checked for curses. After half a year of no negative reports, they decided to accept the will, half-convincing themselves that Malfoy had chosen James due to his relation with the distant cousin Diane Warrington but had forgotten to mention it in the will.
In the middle of the night, Harry once again found her crying in the nursery-to-be. The next morning, Ginny looked at him in the eyes and said, “We can try again”, more like to convince herself. Harry nodded and she finally let out a relieved smile.
“You know the Potions Master Head of the Forensic Department? Tall, platinum blond, I think his name is Malfoy?”
Even then, James did not look at him. He only walked pass him as if he had heard nothing at all. Until he paused briefly next to Harry and whispered quickly,
“I'll have you know that I have concrete evidence for your infidelity, my dear Mrs. Potter”, James played along, pointing an accusing finger at Diane but could not help smirking.
“… You're right. How about I tell you about that one time when I raced a dragon over the grounds of Hogwarts?...”
Well sure, he did spend the first few years or so of his life questioning the fairness of it all. Why should he sacrifice his life for this boy who loomed larger than anyone else over his life but had never once shown kindness to him? Why should he give up his life for someone who was practically a stranger, a strange who was meant to go up against the most powerful Wizard of their time? Why should he take that burden, he who had no say in the matter?
Then, tapping the Pensive and giving the vials an almost mournful look, James stood up and walked out of the room, leaving behind his very puzzled father.
Dinner was a strange affair. On the surface, it was no different from any weekly dinner Harry had with his son's family. Diane's roast was as delicious as Molly used to make, Albus still chattered all the way through the meal, completely ignoring his manners and at one time almost spilled his entire glass of juice. James still grinned at his son conspiratorially as Diane scowled, shaking her head and sending Harry pleading looks, as if she was begging him to just Apparate her idiots of a son and husband somewhere far away. Despite all of this, the laughter of Albus and the motherly scolding of Diane could not hide the fact that sometimes James seemed to be all too silent, slipping into a hard mask now and then when he thought no one was looking. Harry found this odd and silently reminded himself to question him, or at least Diane later, as it was no proper manner in the presence of company. For the moment, he feigned ignorance and laughed along his grandson, the grim face on his son's face never quite vanished in the corner of his eyes.
Gradually, people started to realise the estrangement between father and son. Ron and Hermione were the first one to voice their concern, “Was that why you started drinking and locked yourself in the Hollow for months?”. A worried Molly Apparated into his home one day to ask about James' injury then tried to console him when all he did was gave her a shocked look and burst into tears. The Warringtons were mildly surprised when James did not talk to his father at all during their yearly Christmas parties. Then it was his friends who were puzzled when Harry did not even know of his second grandson's existence. Ministry employers eventually found out that James stopped coming to functions that Harry was bound to attend. They all tried to talk to him. They all tried to talk to James. But still, James refused to look at his dad in the eyes.
And Harry nodded, yes he did know. He had been the father of someone related to Malfoy for twenty-two years.
For one, Draco could not experience any of Potter’s physical pain. He did not feel it when Potter fell from his broom during Quiddich, or when Dementors swarmed all over him that time in Third Year, or that time when a newly-ressurected Dark Lord Crucioed him the year after that. He certainly did not feel any of Potter’s emotional pain, like when Cedric Diggory or Sirius Black died. The only time that Draco got a glimpse of the bond’s effect was sometime at the end of Second Year, during the midst of the Heir of Slytherin drama. It was one evening as he and the rest of his House were cluttered in their Common Room, trapped inside by curfew. One minute he was leaning by his favourite window, listening to Pansy chattering on about one thing or another, the next his energy was completely drained and his knees buckled like a stringless marionette. For a minute, his vision greyed out and he felt trapped within his skin, mind racing with confusion and fear, unable to associate his sudden bout of weakness with his link to Potter. Then, as quickly as it came, the feeling was gone, life surged back into his arms and legs as if someone had dosed him with a strong Pepper-Up, just in time to stop Pansy from alerting others. In the end, he gave Pansy an excuse he was sure she did not believe and made her promise not to tell a word.
“Ginny, what can we do about that then? They were all tested before the implantation, some of them were even surrogates to other couples before. There was no indication that it would fail for us.”
“But Daddy, I want to hear Grandpa's story of the Chamber of Secrets!”, Albus pouted and snuggled up to Harry, confident that his childish act would gain him what he wanted. James, like Harry, was hardly a strict parent and had always yielded easily.
The meeting, strangely enough, only consisted of James, a law assistant as the witness and the solicitor himself, a methodical-looking man with peppered grey hair and discretion imprinted on his very aura. The will was short and straight to the point, stating that since Draco Malfoy was the last Lord without a legal heir, he was free to choose whomever he wished to inherit the Malfoy fortune. Such chosen person was to be Mr. James Sirius Potter and any children he may bear. The inheritance consisted of vaults in Gringotts and many estates, including the Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire. He may or may not wish to keep the Lord title, which obviously was of no concern to the previous Lord. The will seemed legit and the paperworks all looked legal. It did not seem to be a bad joke or a trap of any kind, James concluded when he read through the papers. What puzzled him beyond all else, as well as the reason he asked for more time to decide on the matter, was the motive of this all. Why did Draco Malfoy choose him as his heir? It was not explained in the will and the solicitor, when asked, gave no opinion of his own, years of working for ancient pureblood families had proven that it was not his place to question the clients' wishes.
“I'm not sure about Muggles but wizards can get pregnant. It would require fertility potions, but it can happen.”
For the first few years of Draco’s life, he had a relatively normal childhood, or as normal as it could be for an only child of a wealthy Pureblood family. He was doted on and spoiled and lacked for nothing. He had plenty of toys and plenty of hugs and got his first Blood Quill when he conjured one up from a book illustration as his first manifestation of magic. He chased the family peafowls in the garden and hid his crumb-dotted hands behind his back when he got lectured by his elf nanny. Father let him climb on his lap to peer at his parchments even when he was busy working, Mother let him interrupt her conversation with visiting friends just so he could show her his clumsy stick-like drawings. Most importantly, both of them always kissed his forehead and wished him good night before bed.
Approximately twelve hours later, he woke up to a dark Infirmary and invisible hands gripping his. When Potter leaned over and kissed him, his lips tasted like tears and apologies.
"Since pregnancy is so much more taxing on the male body than females, it is seen as a massive sacrifice to the carrier. If desired, the male carrying the baby will always be granted custody of the child, even if a mother might not be. Harry, they can keep the baby if they want to, especially if the father is you! The law would completely be on their side, even patient confidentiality can be overruled. It is also forbidden to place an Unbreakable Vow on participants in a fertility ritual, in case it has an effect on the well-being of the baby."
“Maybe I’m not the one who's going to regret his decision”, he said, done with keeping up the charade and suddenly feeling so tired, “Seriously, I only want to help. What have you got yourselves into?”
Obliviated him? And for all the things you claim to know, did you know that you manage to miss the biggest thing of all?”
Suddenly Harry's phone rang, the sound bounced off the closed room and startled all three of them. The baby wailed at the intrusion and Harry retracted his arm, looking somewhat uncomfortable. He sent glances at both Malfoy and the child, then down at his vibrating pocket.
But James was here now. He was in the sitting room of Godric's Hollow once again, standing in front of him in the flesh. When James sat down on the couch opposite of him, Harry almost thought that he was finally forgiven, albeit to a crime he did not commit; after all, there was no crime.
“And knew exactly what was to become of him. All of the Malfoys did. That’s the price they agreed to pay to right their wrongs.”
One evening, after a weekend dinner at The Burrow, Ron and Hermione announced that they were expecting their first baby. Immediately, all eyes went to Ginny who seemed to have frozen in her seat. There was a quiet hush and angry whispers coming from Molly's direction to the older couple, enraged by their carelessness of Ginny's condition. The guilty look on Ron and Hermione's faces were wiped off with a flick of Ginny's hand, assuring everyone that she was fine and her situation was no excuse to stop the family from being happy for her brother and sister. Everyone was reminded for a moment that Ginerva Weasley was a strong woman who did not tolerate pity in any way and hated being reminded of her inferiority. Joy was back in the room once more as people congratulated the expecting parents. Harry cheered as well, though he felt Ginny's heavy gaze on him all the while.
“Was raising me as a sacrificial lamb not enough that you need another at your altar? Draco was a child, Professor!”
The day Harry saw James off for Hogwarts for the first time, he was pretty sure he saw a mop of platinum-blond hair in the middle of the crowd at the station. When he returned to the Ministry later that afternoon, he heard that Malfoy had taken a day off.
They did not talk about this either. But then, they also did not talk about the kisses that followed.
The only good thing about his Father’s departure was that the Order became somewhat friendlier to the remaining Malfoys. He supposed that they felt sorry for them, being held back as bargaining chips while their patriarch was sent into the battle zone. They stopped giving them hateful glares as they moved around the house, and some, like Tonks and his Aunt Andromeda, even asked them to join for dinner, making awkward small talks and keeping up a sense of normalcy. Then, just as life was starting to be tolerable, Potter and crew joined them at Grimmauld’s Place. After the immediate shock, that brought about a fresh wave of hostile looks and words, especially since the reason for their supposedly defecting was still kept secret. For a while, things went back to zero, with Draco and Mother avoiding the Trio whenever they entered a room and sneaking around like thieves in avoidance of a confrontation. Eventually the hostility eased, thanks largely to Tonks and Lupin, who must have spoken to the Golden Trio at some point. They still kept largely to themselves, but at least could share a room without trading barbs.
“The Malfoy house elves were quite willing to talk too, what's with them being bound to the Malfoy lineage and cannot lie to the mansion's master. It probably helped as well that they recognised me as father's heir the moment we returned to the ancestral house. And we both know that those Pensieve memories were not altered.”
“Merlin, Harry, can you imagine a Potter or Weasley child being interested in Potions? Snape would've his eyes popped out if the slimy git was still alive”, Ron said after Harry had told him about the strange afternoon. Harry nodded at Ron's words, his mind only half paying half attention to the conversation. He did not care much about James' new-found interest in Potions, considering his parentage and all. What was worrisome was the way Malfoy had interacted with the boy. Weary and careful, very polite, considering he was a Potter. Yet, somehow in the way he explained the testing reactions, there was a subtle hint of pride. And there was the strange glitter in his eyes and those awkward half-aborted gestures. It was as if Malfoy wanted nothing short of touching and holding James. As if he remembered him being his son. But it was a ridiculous notion, he knew that Malfoy did not remember. It was just impossible. He was Obliviated, was he not?
“I was never born out of love, was I? Because you did not love him. After all those times when you told me about how your mother's love keeping you alive, don't you think the same could have been said about me?”
"Due to the nature of male pregnancy and the fact that conception has to be natural, the male surrogate is always pre-informed of the father's identity, lest they decide not to go through the process. And if our identities are known to them, there is no telling that they will keep it a secret, or that they will not want to keep the baby for any sort of leverage or fame."
Disappointment did not even begin to describe Ginny's despair. A stubborn woman on all account, she only uttered a quiet “Oh” as she stayed still and solemn while the Healer went on about possibilities and explanations, though Harry doubted she actually registered any words being spoken. She stumbled only lightly when it was time to leave and did not seem to realise when Harry took her hand and guided her to the Floo. She only sighed tiredly when they arrived home and rested her forehead on his shoulder, sobbing quietly into his shirt as he held her and rocked her gently.
The moment Harry stepped through, Diane was bombarded with a string of exclamations that was so uncharacteristic of her father-in-law.
“See, see how my concrete proof is revealed?” James' voice was booming but his mind failed to register the words. He was trapped in a trance caused by the irregular-coloured eyes. “How can a Warrington-Potter child possess such beautiful silver eyes, unless the mother had been unfaithful?” James continued, but after a while both him and Diane burst into laughter again. They stopped when they realised that Harry had not joined in and was apparently too busy staring at Albus' eyes.
Draco’s plan was to take Pansy to somewhere safe and then looked for Harry. Pansy, forever contradictory, did not want to let him go. Her hands gripped the back of his shirt tightly and she glared like a feral cat when he tried to pry her off, stubbornly holding on, despite knowing that there was nothing that either of them could do. Finally, he sneaked a Sleeping spell on her and handed her off to their Slytherin peers hiding in their Common Room, making them swear not to let her run off after him. He brushed a kiss over her forehead, apologised under his breath, then took off.
They started to see a private Healer who had been sworn to secrecy. Malfoy started taking fertility potions and Harry started to make a habit of fucking him in the parchment-packed Archives room where no one ever frequented in addition to their usual evening rendezvouses. Never once did Malfoy asked after Harry's intention to Ginny or questioned Harry's want for a child. It was as if he knew.
"Merlin help me... we would be taking advantage of someone in no position to say no! I'm still not going to force myself on anyone, even for you Ginny. It's enough I'm trying to force myself into this.”
So, against the rage of the families and the inferno in his father's eyes, James signed the papers and moved into the Malfoy Manor in December. It was two days before the death anniversary of Draco Malfoy.
“But it's still too bad we didn't know about him before. How come no one tells us stories about him? I've heard lots about grandma Ginny and grandpa Harry, how come there are no stories about grandpa Draco?”
than just announcing his son’s eventual demise. His ramble was long and convoluted and regularly interrupted as he tried to hide the pained expression on his face, or when Mother eventually succumbed to her tears; plus, Draco was too young at the time to remember every exact words. But years later, after he had trimmed down all of the simple analogies used for the benefit of a four-year old, it came down to something like this:
A long silence ensued. The Malfoys turned to stare at him, their mouths hanging as if cut off mid-motion, their face full of disbelief. Was this just a terrible joke, Harry furiously thought to himself. Then Narcissa turned back to her husband and whispered, tears heavy in her eyes:
Later when he saw the blond head among the Ministry crowd, he recalled that it was the death anniversary of Narcissa Malfoy.
“Well you should! This kind of violence was just uncalled for. What if you get brain damage from this and had a concussion and die from haemorrhage and–“
As Ginny felt the rumble from Harry's incensed yell above her head, she hushed him gently and snuggled up even closer to his chest. She assured that there was nothing he could do to make her stop loving him, she would not see it as an act of betrayal and she would rather prefer a child related to one of them than one of strange blood. She was certain that she would care for the child as if it was her own, and just because she could not have a child by blood did not mean that he would be deprived of that honour. But he did not wish a child from someone else, Harry cried, still failing to comprehend how Ginny could have thought of something so outrageous in the first place. Still, Ginny was nothing but stubborn and took it her mission to convince Harry night after night, whispering to him in desperation and urgency. By the end of the month, Harry finally yielded after one more night in the would-be nursery once again, Ginny sobbed into her husband's chest, “Please do it for me, Harry.”
“Yes, that's the one. That's the one with the least words, except for the flower stone. It looked fairly new too, so maybe that was grandpa? Is that right, dad?”
Pansy, unappreciative of his joke, just slapped her hands over his mouth. She was so unimpressed with his joke that she also started crying.
The first time he visited the National Gallery however, he was immediately taken by a landscape painting. It was hard to explain why it stood out among all the other beautiful paintings on display in the room. Abstractly, he could see that the paintbrushes were rough and unrefined, the different colours popping boldly like toy blocks, unlike Mother’s elegant favourites or the many paintings that adorned the walls of the Manor. Yet, the painting called out to him, and as he gazed upon it all he could feel was a quiet sense of happiness and peace. Right then and there, he told himself,
His smile died right away when he read the letter. He jumped towards the fireplace and Flooed immediately to St. Mungo's.
In all of honesty, Harry did not expect much to come out of his visit to Hogwarts. His mind was still reeling from the encounter, thinking that the Malfoys had been nothing but overtly dramatic. They had ulterior motives perhaps, trying to catch him off-guard by bringing up a sensitive spot, trying to leverage his once feelings for their son for their benefits. Maybe Draco had coached them so, telling them about his schoolboy crushes. With such frame of thought in mind, he Flooed into the Headmistress’ Office, expecting to have his suspicion justified. Yet, when he saw the glint in Dumbledore’s eyes, he knew that there was more to this than a joke of poor taste at his expense. He had been lied to enough by Dumbledore over the years to recognise the well-concealed guilt in his demeanor. Still, nothing could have prepared him for the truth.
The first time Draco kissed Potter was after the final Quiddich match of Fifth Year. They did not talk about it.
That year, he received a package for his birthday. The package was unsigned; inside, wrapped in fine tissues, was a smallish framed painting of brick-walled buildings in blue and brown and an expansive sky from afar, as if drawn from a window. He did not recognise the painting.
That night, Harry found himself in his living room. For the first time, he looked at the items around the room with full awareness. All the things that he had charted to his evolving interests over time. All the habits that he thought he had picked up from others around him. All the little quirks that frequently puzzled his close friends, all of those now had an explanation, one he could not bear to ponder on.
"So you're saying that there is no way out of this, since we will never be able to find someone who will absolutely keep their mouth shut."
“James!” Harry glared up at his son, his voice stern. Angry or not, it was no excuse to take it out on an innocent child. He started to feel pretty angry himself. “Don't you dare have that attitude in front of me. If you are upset with me, then talk to me, do not take it out on your son.” Harry gave his son his most displeased look, but was surprised by the lack of change in James' expression. The man was still glaring at him with what looked like quiet fire in his eyes, so foreign an emotion it triggered in Harry that his own flame was temporarily extinguished, in spite of Albus' little whimpers at his hip.
Harry became more attentive to the pregnant man, bestowing him with pregnancy necessities and gifts, more than half of which was originally from his wife and none of which was postnatal-related.
At the end of the day, he knew that she did not really understand. But that night, they snuck onto the roof of Pansy’s Aunt’s house where they were staying, dangling their feet over the edge of the building as they tilted back their heads and watched the country stars blinking brightly in the sky. When he felt Pansy’s hand curling up in his, he knew that she did not need to understand everything. This here, was enough.
Then, the Trio discovered a destroyed Horcrux and began plans to seek out the rest, all of which Harry truthfully whispered to him late at night as they folded into the ratty couch in the living room, a thin blanket draped over their cooling perspiring bodies. For a hot second when he found out about the plan, Draco thought about joining them. He and Granger had built a tentative sort of truce over their shared interests in reading materials, and he and Weasley could even play a game of chess together as long as neither of them looked at each other. He knew that they, not knowing that he must be kept hidden, would reluctantly let him come along, and if nothing else they could make good use of his knowledge of Dark Magic and his connections with other Pureblood families for their cause. Selfishly, that meant he could also be by Harry’s side. From the hopeful tone in Harry’s voice, he knew that Harry also wished for him to join them.
Harry just hummed lightly, focusing solely on the sleeping child in her daughter-in-law's arms, not hearing what James had said at all.
“... As I was saying, the baby was in that man's belly, until one day the baby was big enough, then he gave birth to the baby, and that baby was me.”
“I said now, Albus Severus Potter!” James' sudden thunder-like voice startled both grandfather and grandson. Harry stared at his crumbled harsh face in shock, finding himself slightly afraid of his son. Albus' expression had almost frozen, the boy was rarely called by his full name unless he was in trouble; it was also the first time he saw his father in such rage. He buried into Harry's flank and tears started to glimmer in his eyes
The next day when Harry paid a visit to the FD to retrieve a report, he walked pass the empty office of Malfoy and saw the glance of a symbol drawn on the calendar for the 17
It was a dark December afternoon when Diane's barn owl came knocking furiously at Harry's closed window. Harry startled, he had been too concentrated on a case report for the past half an hour to pay attention to much else. The shivering bird swooped into the room and immediately perched on the chair closest to the fireplace, all the while giving Harry the mightiest glare. Harry apologised to the bird with a smile even when she pecked at his hand violently as he reached towards the scroll at her foot.
“Bullshit! There was no way that the Malfoys would ever willingly sacrifice their own son. You tricked them into this somehow, didn’t you?”
, one with 'how could you accept something from a no-good Death Eater scumbag?' and another 'how could you accept the vaults of the prestigious Malfoy without telling us?'. None of the Howlers, however, was remotely comparable to the furious Harry Potter stomping through their Floo. Their father was enraged, loudly voicing his opinions on their sudden decision. He sounded much betrayed when he questioned them, was it not worth discussing with their families beforehand and preventing everyone of a heart attack in the form of a
As the flame in the fireplace burst into life, Harry heard his son's quiet voice speaking into the fire:
Eventually, he turned around the corner just in time to see Vincent and Greg hurriedly slinging into the Room of Requirement as well as the shimmering light from the Invisibility Cloak. He knew that Harry had also spotted him, for he yanked the Cloak off and came running towards him.
It was now hung above his mantelpiece, side-by-side a wall full of paintings, frame after frame covering the expanse of the dimly-lit wall, mostly replicas, but some were rare originals, obtained with the kind of effort that he would not normally spare for such a frivolous pursuit. Ron told him that it looked like tributes in a tomb, the kind of treasure hoard that Purebloods left alongside their dead ancestors in their pompous crypts. Hermione, knowing that he did not care for materialistic values, tried to reason that he must have had something to prove with his collection.
's first prenatal check-up. For a moment, Ginny herself forgot that it was not her who was carrying the child. Her excited voice was contagious, making Harry's own cheek tinged with excitement. But then, Ginny's voice suddenly seemed lost and Harry realised that she was asking about the child's birth. The pretense was gone as both of them were again reminded of the facts. That their rightful child was carried by someone else. That Ginny was unable to get pregnant. That they would have to erase a Malfoy out of their lives the moment the child was born.
For one moment, Harry's heart came to a stop James' words. Then, realising how ridiculous and paranoid he was being, Harry shook his head.
On the day of the departure, he gripped Harry’s hands tightly while the others’ backs were turned. He did not come with them.
Years went by and people moved on from the bloody horrors of the War. Things once seemed to important and relevant were no longer of concern, scandalous falls from grace left no more imprint than a vague memory. The Malfoys, like many of their peers, seemed to have faded from people’s mind. Last thing Harry heard, the family had moved to France. Not my business anymore, Harry thought as he left the other Aurors to their gossips. Really, no, he reminded himself, as he got on with his life, knowing that a boyish shadow was always at the back of his mind. A month after the tenth anniversary of the Hogwarts Battle, he heard through Ministry grapevines that someone had seen Lucius Malfoy in Diagon Alley just the week before. Sometime later, Hermione mentioned seeing Narcissa Malfoy with Pansy Parkinson in a café in Muggle London. Nobody mentioned Draco.
“I’m not that desperate to see you that you have to come all the way here, Draco. You know, I would really prefer to have you back with your mum than running around active combat zone like this.”
Thus, it came as quite a shock, really, to see him perching on a high seat in the middle of the lab, much like a shrunken version of eleven-year-old Harry, staring in awe at a bubbling cauldron and the various phials of blood standing in neat lines on the top bench. Even more surreal, was the fact that Malfoy of all people was talking to him in a quiet voice on the other side of the bench. James looked up as Harry entered the room and started to talk animatedly about how he was bored with the office and had found his way down the Forensic lab when he spotted Mr. Malfoy working on a fairly recent murder case. James did not see the way Harry frown nor how Malfoy stared quite rigidly at the father and son. In the end, James talked his dad into letting him stay and watch, provided he stayed still in his seat and did not try to touch anything without permission.
“Come,” she breathed, as she bordered the perimeter of the room to a tall opened window. She hoisted herself up the window frame and hooked one leg over the edge, dangling half outside of the window to the tall height beneath and leaning against the vertical beam. She did not ask again. Harry supposed he could have ignored her, or better yet just left and returned to his dorm room. Yet, he found himself approaching her and copying her posture, leaning against the opposite side of the window frame while keeping a large gap between them. For awhile neither of them spoke and just stared out at the heavily clouded sky.
On the one hand, it felt like a weight off his shoulder, now that he had given words to his destiny and that someone outside of his immediate family knew.
Diane looked at the panicked face of her father-in-law floating in the green flames with blank eyes. “No, he's not back yet.”
“You’re lucky that not more people have caught up on your stupid scheme, and that I’m only asking nicely. Now again, what wicked plans have you two been sneaking around for?”
“That's because my aunts and uncles didn't know enough about him. Shall I tell you his stories then? How about that time when grandpa Draco's findings led to the capture of a very dangerous criminal that had not been discovered for three years?...”
The moment Harry saw Ginny's beaming face at the little baby, the last thread of guilt in his heart melted away. He looked fondly at the sight of Ginny, with radiant smile and gentle hands, cooed at the dark-haired child in the crook of her arms. Ginny, who sent him a smile full of gratitude when he handed her the boy for the first time. Ginny, whose nightingale-like voice whispered the name of their newborn with such love it made one's heart ache. Ginny, with footsteps light as feathers, walked to the bassinet and tucked the baby in tenderly. Ginny, whose entire being yearned and ached to be a mother.
“Don't worry Harry, my great-great-great-great-or-something grandmother was a Malfoy, and since we all know Malfoys are the only one with silver eyes, it must be part of my inheritance. It's not rare for ancient characteristics to show up after some half-dozen generations.” Diane's explanation seemed to brought Harry back and he finally blinked, looking away from Albus. James patted his father's back, assuring him again that it was a joke and there was no way the babe would not be a Potter, did you see that unruly Potter hair of his?
Harry thought it was the worst day of his life, far exceeding the days of the Final Battle, when he saw Ginny broke down into tears in the cold and impersonal room of St. Mungo's. The way Ginny kept her back straight as she tried to hold back her sobs yet could not stop her tears made an even more heart-wrenching picture. The way Ginny looked straight at her Healer's sympathetic but professional face as he explained her condition, how untreatable it was even with the combination of magical and Muggle methods, how she would not be able to live pass thirty, how her health would deteriorate at an unpredictable rate. How she would never be able to carry a baby.
“I can’t believe you didn’t just hex him right back! How could you just let him, Draco?”, Pansy shrieked as she poked at the lump on his head.
Months passed with little news. Every now and then, he would catch the tail-end of someone’s conversations, or would get a bit of gossips between Mother and Aunt Andromeda, or would stumble across someone’s Firecall. From this, he could vaguely sketch out the Trio’s adventures, their trip to Godric’s Hollows, their capture to the Manor, their heist at Gringotts. From the increasingly excited chatters of the Order, he knew that something big was about to take place at Hogwarts, that perhaps it was the showdown for the Fate of the Magic world. If nothing else, he knew that Harry was meant to face the Dark Lord there.
He could see Dumbledore’s mouth moving, could see his face shifted in a moue of sorrow, but the ringing in his ears had drowned out all sounds and he knew that all was lip service to him. Before he knew it, he had slammed a chair at the old Headmaster’s frame and Apparated out of the room, leaving behind the stunned silence of Dumbledore’s portrait and the alarmed voice of the Headmistress.
“Nah, that was the theme question for last month already. This month's dare is 'the birth of our parents'!”
“But he was my father, was he not? He carried me for more than nine months. He was the one whose hands I kicked when I was still unborn. He was the one who sang and talked to me. He was the one who fucking gave birth to me!”
Such irony indeed, Harry thought himself, all the while trying to forget the colour of Malfoy's lifeless eyes.
he wanted to say, but words could not come out of his mouth. Not when James had leaned back against the couch and was still crying. Then he remembered the Pensive and vials of memories churning inside, their silvery content glittering like mercury. He remembered Malfoy talking to a younger James over shimmering cauldrons. He remembered James noticing Malfoy's stares. And he remembered Albus' accident and the cold body on the metal bed. At this point, James were no longer looking at him. He had stood up and turned towards the fireplace, turning his back against his dad, the man he had practically worshiped for the better part of his life. Just like the day his dad turned away from his father more than twenty years ago with him in arms, never to return again.
"No, Harry, what I am saying is that we need a surrogate who will never be able to publicly admit to having relations with you. Someone who is perhaps ostracised from the society, or someone whose words will never be taken seriously even if they tell others."
Her reactions were rather predictable, as in they were all the things that he himself had gone through the first time round. Draco watched on with abstract fascination as Pansy cycled through the stages. Rage lasted the longest, as she raged and raved about everything she could think of, from the Dark Lord to his parents, from Dumbledore to Potter. She demanded to know how he could be so blasé of his own life, how he could speak so lightly of it as if he did not care. For a long few days, she did not speak to him, turning away angrily whenever they caught eyes. Then one night, he woke up to a jostle in his bed to find that Pansy had sneaked her way into the boy’s dormitory and underneath his blanket. In the dimmed light reflected from the murky lake water outside of the window, he could see her trembling form and the shiny tears on her cheeks as she silently sobbed. That night he held Pansy in his arms, both of them wide awake, submerged under the watery tomb of their dormitory. Neither of them mentioned it the next day, but underneath the table at breakfast, Draco felt Pansy’s fingers holding onto his, and he squeezed back.
As more days passed, Eliza’s attempts at conversation began to wither away. On the fifth day, her attempts had stopped altogether. At the end of her visit, she packed away the plethora of vials and tonics back into her hospital bag, but she didn’t head towards the exit with a kind farewell as she normally did. Instead, she simply sat on the edge of Harry’s bed next to him. Scared as if Harry would disintegrate, she carefully placed a comforting hand on the blanket that was rested on Harry’s knee.  She rubbed her thumb against the blanket in a nurturing manner in a way that reminded Harry of Molly. “I know it hurts, but it won’t feel like this forever.”
A soft “Of course” was muttered in response. Harry felt delicate fingers move against the nape of his neck, and a shiver ran down his spine. He felt the string pull and unravel under the skilled, long fingers that slowly, so slowly, untangled it. Fingertips brushed against the exposed skin of the back his neck, leaving tingling prints. Malfoy was made of metal, and Harry of exposed wire. Harry felt the white individual strings drop over the front of his shoulders, and the fingers he felt briefly on his skin retreated. Harry turned slowly to face Malfoy again, examining his face before breaking his gaze away to check the clock.
“Have you got peppermint?” Harry interpreted this as Malfoy trying to nonchalantly accept his offer. He couldn’t stop the bright grin forming on his face.
Harry felt the material of the gown flop limply to his waist, exposing his chest. “Malfoy your clock is broken.”
Harry had glared stubbornly back at the house elf, who once again was examining the mess. Harry waved his wand, muttering quick efficient cleaning charms that sent the clothes flying back into their original places. The clutter of noise as the drawers and wardrobe doors closed themselves once they were full again echoed within the spacious room. Once everything was returned to its space, Harry returned his wand once again to his back pocket and crossed his arms across his chest.
“Heart rate slightly erratic. Your body is most likely in shock from pain. This is expected.” Malfoy almost murmured. “Yes. Expected, but still intriguing…” After what felt like a lifetime, the metal circle was lifted from Harry’s chest. Refusing to open his eyes, Harry felt a cold sensation trick through his body, like cold water going over a ledge. “I’m just running a few diagnostic charms. Is this okay, Potter?”
Harry stopped pacing and leant his back against the wall by the living room door with a hard thud. “What are you on about?”
Harry felt guilt plunge through his stomach like a stone into deep water, though he refused to back down. He took a deep breath, steadying himself. “If you think-“
Harry furrowed his brow lightly in amused confusion. He shook his head letting out a breathy laugh. “Explains what?”
Draco was different to Malfoy. Malfoy is the cold, heartless bastard who stamped on Harry’s nose in 6
Harry chewed his lip and felt a tingly feeling rush down his spine in a way that was becoming much too familiar. “I was such an asshole this morning.”
Malfoy said nothing for many moments. His jaw was set hard. Harry saw his knuckles whiten from his grip on his chart, though no emotion was clear on his aristocratic face. “Potter needs another dose of skelegrow and a physical examination to see the progress of his treatment so far. I am afraid visiting hours are over for tonight. You are more than welcome to come in the morning to check on him. I’ll let you say your goodbyes.” Malfoy gave a polite nod towards Harry’s friends, before making his way to the other side of the room to deal with another patient.
Harry swallowed as he let his eyelids drift shut. He heard the sound of the clipboard being placed on the table, and the sound of approaching footsteps. He felt the edge of the sofa beside him dip as Malfoy sat down. The familiar incantation began to escape from Malfoy’s lips and Harry immediately felt heat radiate from the man. A dark rouge tint appeared in the darkness that Harry could see; Malfoy’s palms being the source of the light.
A short laugh escaped Mayford’s mouth, and her serious expression broke into a fond grin. “He went home after he fetched me. Not because of you, so don’t get your apologetic knickers in a twist Mr. Potter. His shift should have ended over an hour ago, but clearly he wanted to do a final check of his patients before he left.”
Kreacher’s beady eyes fixed onto Malfoy and bowed so lowly that the tip of his pointy nose touched the floor. “To serve a Black again. Kreacher is honoured to serve the Masters of ancient and most noble house of Black.” The bow was extended for quite some time, before Kreacher stood upright again and vanished out of the room.
Malfoy’s voice was flat. His gaze was focused on adjusting the instrument around his neck, and the collars of his robe. “Granger asked me a question, Potter. I answered honestly. Would you rather I lied? I thought Gryffindors were about chivalry and doing the right thing.”
“Your fever isn’t as high this morning.” Eliza dabbed Harry’s forehead softly with the damp cloth. A few stray droplets fell down his flushed face and dangled from his jaw. “A couple more days and your daily treatments will be complete! Isn’t that exciting?”
, I judged him based on what I had heard; I thought that the hospital had hired a Death Eater who would put blood purity before saving lives.” Eliza’s bottom lip trembled lightly, but she steadied herself by drawing a slow breath. Harry reached for her hand and squeezed it. “He was quiet, and didn’t speak to us medical staff, so I had my guard up about him. I remember there was an old witch, a muggleborn, who was dying of age-related complications about two years ago… Her family had paid a lot of money to grant her a private room, so she could pass away peacefully. Alone. I noticed
That vulnerable side, that was Draco. The boy who cried helplessly as he pointed his wand at Dumbledore’s chest on top of the Astronomy tower. Draco was the ticking time bomb that stood waiting for Harry in his living room. Draco was the one that shook with fear after realising what he and Harry had done on the sofa. It was Draco that fled last night when Harry gave him a chance to.
Whether Kreacher had heard Harry or had selectively ignored him was debatable. Kreacher continued to move slowly, eyeing up the balled-up clothes that were randomly strewn across the room. “Yes yes... All too much, all too much... Nowhere to put the parcel...”
Harry was too aroused to think. His prick shifted against his thigh. Blood gushed to Harry’s groin with such force that the resulting erection bordered on painful.
Harry’s heart clenched with another wave of grief that made him want to shatter everything around him, himself included.
Draco kissed Harry frantically, whining against his mouth. “Don’t stop don’t you fucking sto-“Draco’s words became strangled as a deep moan escaped from him. Harry opened his eyes to see Draco’s eyes beginning to roll back as his hips jerked frantically against Harry’s, riding an orgasm.
“Focus on me Potter. Open your eyes.” Harry supressed a moan as he locked his eyes onto Malfoy’s, whose gaze was so focused and devastatingly alluring. “Okay, this is good.”
Malfoy completed the rounds of his patients before leaving the room. Harry kept his eyes trained on the back of the blonde’s head until he walked down the corridor, out of sight. True to his word, Eliza shortly came into the room with a blue plastic tray bobbing behind her. Her smile was bright and she all but skipped into the room. “Good morning Harry, I take it that you didn’t sleep very well last night.”
Malfoy nonchalantly flicked his wand, resulting in Harry’s black robe vanishing from his body, and reappearing folded at the end of the bed.
Something cold and smooth was placed on Harry’s tongue. Harry’s eyes were the size of dinner plates when his eyes flew open in shock. A second wave of shock rolled through his stomach when he saw the amused smirk that was curled on Malfoy’s lips. The substance began to melt on his tongue.
Judging by how the targeted grumpy git was standing in the doorway of the room, Harry could gather that the plan had worked. He smiled softly and lifted his hand to wave but stopped himself before he could, opting instead to awkwardly return his hand back to his lap.
Sitting down and having tea with Malfoy allowed for a pleasant exchange of conversation. Harry had found out that this was Malfoy’s first year at being the head of his department, and how surprised Malfoy had been to be named his superior’s successor. From the stories Malfoy had told him about his most memorable cases, it did not surprise Harry one bit why he was chosen for the role. It is in Malfoy’s nature to be calculating and analytical, though Harry no longer saw these traits in the malicious light that he did in school. It allowed Malfoy to think first before he acted, which was crucial when people’s lives were hanging in the balance of his decisions. Throughout their talk Harry was also discovering that this man was charming, witty had the flair for the dramatics within his storytelling. Malfoy gestured a lot with his hands, and his eyebrows moved emotively as he talked.
“I know that you have a complicated past. I was in the year below you in Hogwarts, I remember your rivalry. He is different now, Harry.”
Harry appreciated her efforts and tried to smile, nod and laugh in the right places, but his mind was always somewhere else.
Harry had practically skipped home from the hospital earlier that day. He must have looked like an idiot to the bystanders, who watched a grown man grin ear to ear as he made his way through the bustling London streets towards Grimmauld Place.
When Harry turned his head to look at Malfoy as they made it down the final step, he couldn’t help but feel a little puzzled. “Draco, are you cold? Your cheeks look a little warm...”
Her smile disappeared completely from her face as Harry stared guiltily at her like a misbehaved puppy.
Whatever piece of sanity that held Draco back snapped. He grabbed Harry by the t-shirt. His hands were balled up into fists against Harry’s collarbones. “You think this is fucking funny, do you?”
Harry wasn’t expecting anything in particular, but he still felt surprised to know Malfoy wore fashionable muggle clothing beneath his robes. A cable knitted jumper and tailored grey trousers to be precise. The rich darkness of Malfoy’s green jumper made his grey irises look like lighthouse beacons against a stormy sea. In that moment Harry was grateful for the loose fit of his pyjama bottoms. “I was a real git to you earlier. I’m sorry about that.”
“What happened at my house was... Weird and it was messy. I was intense and emotional, and I shouldn’t have put you in a position that would make you overstep a boundary with a patient.”
“Kreacher, send a thank you note to Mr. Zabini, and a new bottle of that poncy aftershave he loves so much.”
Slow, tantalising pressure was placed against Harry’s sides which caused Harry’s chest to deflate as he let go of the breath he did not know he was holding.
A smirk broke across Harry’s face before he could stop it. The man before him was stood on a knifes edge, and all Harry had to do was push. “What you gonna do Malfoy? Run away again? That’s what you do best isn’t it?”
Malfoy didn’t move. His hands were frozen on his collar. His entire frame was taught and solid. No one in the room breathed a sound. The other patients exchanged rapid glances between each other, their mouths were slightly agape from shock. They all waited as if they were on the point of a needle, waiting for what happens next.
“Your mind went dark, didn’t it?” The softness of Draco’s tone took Harry by surprise, and his eyes immediately darted towards the man. He watched as Draco fidgeted with his fingers and chewed on the inside of his cheek.
Harry shot up his eyebrows, letting out a single dry laugh. “Are you saying I need it? I look that bad do I?”
Draco closed his eyes and sighed hard. He wiped his palms together to sprinkle the quill fragments onto the desk before vanishing them away. “If there isn’t a coffee on this desk by the time I get back Mr. Jefferson
“—No! You don’t get to tell me I didn’t deserve to die! It would have been a hell of a lot easier if you just let me burn, you fucking ingrate!” Draco’s whole body pulsed with adrenaline at the confession.  Angry tears pricked at his vision. “But of course that wasn’t all.  You needed to march in in all your fucking golden glory and testify on my behalf when you bloody well should’ve just left me to rot in Azkaban with my father and all the other Death Eater riffraff. Now I have to learn how to be a better person when I only know how to be fucking miserable or the annoying pretentious brat from first year and I hate it Potter, I fucking
However, the feeling quickly vanished when he became aware of the wave of hushed insults and frantic whispers that trailed behind him as he made his way to the train.  He tugged gently at the silver chain fastener of his charcoal travel cloak to alleviate the growing choking feeling wrapping around his throat.  He blamed the growing heat on the train’s billowing engine and the hot humid air created by sobbing parents and first-years.
Oh yes, of course. The ickle golden children of the war didn’t have to worry their pretty little heads over such things. Only the rabble had to fend for himself. Lovely.
McGonagall folded her hands on the antique desk.  “I know breakfast has just ended, but would you like a biscuit?” She motioned towards a delicate crystal dish on the corner of her desk.
“And Mister Malfoy?” Draco swore he could smell the rubber soles of his shoes burning as he halted all movement.  He quickly adjusted the knot of the tie, trying to alleviate the choking sensation at his throat. “Do take a biscuit. I insist.”
He counted the rhythm between steps in his head so it looked like he was striding away with purpose instead of starting to sprint towards the nearest open door.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Draco’s shoulders slumped at the Scottish lilt of Headmistress McGonagall’s voice, “a word.”
They shared another silent conversation before Potter patted the taller’s shoulder.  “I’ll see you and ‘Mione at the table alright?”
Monday.  His hand now throbbed for no damn reason. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and melted onto the floor with the grace of a flobberworm.
Draco’s eyes bore into the mottled emerald velvet of his bed curtains. Sleep evaded him. The scene from breakfast replayed in his head.  He still didn’t know what was worse, the words themselves, Potter’s reaction, or that there were times where he agreed with the sentiment.
The next morning at breakfast, Draco massaged his temples with his fingertips. He’d been up all night drafting his letter to Potter. He might be out of his element, but he would be damned if his letter was half the mess Potter’s was. He took a strong gulp of tea before folding the small piece of parchment in an origami crane. Before bravery could escape him, he sent it fluttering delicately across the Great Hall and waited with baited breath.
He brushed his thumb against the corner of the familiar Hogwarts stationary. For once, he was grateful for the pragmatic witch’s strict conduct towards education.
” His index finger trembled as pointed sharply at the bespectacled git. “I had finally accepted my fate that I wasn’t going to make it through, but oh no, the fucking
Draco turned quickly and went in search of an empty compartment.  He drew out his wand and silently cast a Colloportus charm on the door before melting into the cushioned bench.  He ran his hands down his face while exhaling a long deep breath.  The journey to Hogwarts had barely begun and he was already exhausted.
Weasley was well, Weasley.  If his shoulders tensed any higher, he’d look like a gargoyle.  He heard the brute’s raised voice as he reentered the room.  It seemed like he was attempting to whisper but didn’t know the actual definition of the word.  “Look, I trust you but I’m not sure I trust
Draco forced down a small sip of tea as he felt his mother’s worried gaze try to reach him through the porcelain of his teacup.
His back arched like a distressed cat at the familiar voice. Every nerve in his body was telling him to crawl into the compartment or to bolt.  He took a moment to collect himself before turning around to face his current(?) former(?) rival. Draco bit the inside of lip and did his best to keep his tone neutral.  “Potter.”
Harry stood frozen in place, his fingers digging into the sofa as Draco continued undeterred. His chest heaved in anger and he gestured wildly to his left.  “Oh, what a lovely corner of castle.  Here’s where I tortured students!” He aggressively swung his body towards the opposite corner, “and here’s where
He cursed under his breath as the bright morning chatter in Great Hall dulled in volume.  It was October now.  One would think the other students would be used to it by now.  Hell if he, the bloody target of the ire, could become numb to it, they fucking well could as well, the vultures.
Draco froze as he felt the witch’s searching gaze on him. He finished breakfast in a daze.  He waited for the majority of hall to clearly before grabbing his bag and heading to class.
Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes as every head in the Great Hall turned and waited with baited breath to see what would happen. He’d clearly forgotten that the only thing faster than a golden snitch was the speed at which gossip traveled on the Hogwarts Express.  He might’ve made grave mistakes the past few years but it’s not like he was going to murder a child in bloodlust, despite Wizarding Britain’s views of his family name.  He raised his goblet at the girl and gave her a nod of sheer indifference before returning his gaze to the head table and waited for the sea of onlookers to turn back away.
Raging, echoing shouts of him being a coward or Death Eater scum were as mundane to him now as the scrape of a butter knife against toast, the clinking of dishes against the mahogany tables.
A lump formed in Draco’s throat as he gingerly unwrapped his wand from the rolled up parchment.  His eyes were misty, as if being reunited with a long lost friend.  His lips stretched out in a thin hopeful smile as his unrolled the rest of the letter.
He was going to be back at Hogwarts with Potter and the War Heroes as a Death Eater, a war criminal.  No matter his pardon nor Harry’s confusing attempts of acquaintanceship, the court of public opinion deemed him guilty.
Draco figured he was a ruddy pink mess and that somehow made him angrier.  His mind was going a kilometer a minute.  He felt like he was going mad, like that disowned cousin of Mother’s, the dog bloke.
Draco couldn’t hold back his irritated scoff. How dare he ask for a wee moment of The Saviour’s time?  It’s not like a letter would take more than an hour or so to draft up, the bastard.  He let out an undignified huff and carried on, merely skimming the drivel of his letter in search of the important bits.
Draco halted his pacing when the fire crackled loudly, the amber flame lapping violently against the ornate fire screen located on the hearth.  He stood frozen in place, fighting to keep his breath even.  He swallowed thickly as the fire subsided and forced himself to release the tension from his white-knuckled fists.   He shut his eyes tightly and took a deep breath as he heard the gentle cooing of his mother calling him for tea.
Boy Weasley and Granger stood frozen and horrified as if they had seen a ghost while Girl Weasley’s brown eyes glowed amber with anger as she wailed, “Harry, are you out of your fucking mind!?”
Draco’s fingers drummed anxiously against his thighs underneath the table. He brought a shaky hand back to grasp the handle of his tea cup. He took a deep breath as wild nest of black curls shot up and P—Harry’s eyes met his.
Draco ignored the crack in his voice as he responded, “That’s quite alright. I’ll be fine on my own, thanks.”
All eighth year students were notified beforehand that they would be housed in a separate area of the castle with a separate common room due to “special circumstances.” Draco wanted to scoff.  How was anyone going to get past the war if everyone simply pussyfooted around it?  It was all bollocks.
H—Potter looked like how he felt.  The normally warm brown skin of his face was becoming a pallid shade of beige.  Even from such a distance Draco could see his body tremor.  Nanoseconds later, there was a loud bang as Potter shot out of the Great Hall with all the power and speed of the level of seeker he was.  A deathly worried Granger and an intense looking Weasley rushed out soon after.
Indignation forced Draco’s voice out of his pursed lips.  “I can assure you I won’t be blowing up anything, Weasley.”  The two men jumped at his presence, which gave him an immature yet gleeful satisfaction.
Casting wordless wandless defense spells had become just as routine as combing his hair before breakfast.  If he wasted energy going after every person who tried to hex him, he would flunk out of Hogwarts.  Was it a petulant boil on his arse? Of course.  Was it fair? Draco couldn’t answer.
Considering their thorny past as teacher and student as well as his crimes of repairing the Vanishing Cabinet and allowing the Death Eaters entry on school grounds, Draco was quite shocked at the speed at which Headmistress McGonagall responded and sent her letter to the Ministry.
Draco would be daft to think that Potter wouldn’t have been at least slightly aware that he would be one of, if not the only returning Slytherin eighth year student.  Blaise, ever the pragmatist, began planning his escape to Italy during the holidays during sixth year.  His relationship with Theo became distant throughout the war, but he heard through gossip that he was already preparing for his N.E.W.T.S and looking to take them at the end of December if approved by the Ministry, the lucky bastard. Pansy refused to return stating that there were too many bad memories and fear of retaliation as were many of the other students and looked to transfer to different schools within Europe. His heart still ached at the mixture of fear and pain in her eyes when she floo-called him about it. Crabbe, well, he didn’t like to dwell on him for long.  Goyle—Greg didn’t even respond to his owl until earlier that morning stating he wasn’t ready to talk to him yet because Vincent’s death still hurt too much.
Draco blinked rapidly in an effort to bring back his stony shield of indifference.  He caught eyes with Zacharias Smith.  He gripped his wand tightly beneath the table.  It took every fibre in his being to not hex the self-righteous prick’s sneer off his grubby little face.
His fate laid waiting between the talons of the tawny post owl’s feet.  Draco traded a half-eaten sandwich for the letter and gave the bird a small pat on the head before letting it go on its way.
“Yeah…” Weasley shifted on his feet and scratched at his cheek.  “Maybe he’s changed, I don’t know.  I just don’t want to see this blow up your face mate.”
He turned on his side with a huff. There was no point dwelling on the past.  No time turner would magically fix their tumultuous past nor erase his part in the war. He would have to fix things the traditional way by starting anew and trying to become a better person and he fucking hated it.
Draco’s eyes shot open and he coughed as something bony dug into his sternum and squeezed the remaining air out of his body.  His body went rigid as he registered the feeling of Harry’s arms wrapped painfully tight around him.  Merlin’s tits. The bastard was
Draco fought back a panicked gulp.  Their tone was icy enough to give him hypothermia.  He cleared his throat and forced out the most neutral, unbothered tone he could manage.  “As fun as this,” Draco gestured to the four Gryffindors with a lazy tilt of his wrist, “reunion, was, I really must be going.”
A younger Draco would have shouted from the rooftops that Harry Potter had accepted his hand in friendship.  Now, the closest thing he could say he felt was indigestion.
The graying witch’s expelled a gentle breath and pushed up her glasses.  “Mr. Malfoy, it has come to my attention that you have been receiving harassment for some time.”
Draco cut delicately into his sausage.  He took a small bite and followed up with a quick sip of tea as the familiar garish scarlet flash swept past his peripheral.  He exhaled an annoyed breath out of his nose and rolled his eyes.  He rolled his neck and shoulders as he prepared for the daily onslaught of howlers.
Since his trials, Draco had fully become aware and finally accepted that he was a coward.  However, cowardice was no match for the stubborn pure-blood pride instilled in him since birth.  As much as he wanted to run or simply disappear to the Manor indefinitely, he already came this far and he would be damned if he proved his naysayers right.  With a long swig of his father’s aged fire whiskey and a sigh, he let his remaining dignity and will seep onto the parchment as he began to write.
It took all of his determination to swallow without choking or gagging.  His tightly fisted hand began to shake under the table and ice trickled through his veins. The only sound in the hall was the gentle clink of his fork landing on his plate.
Potter huffed and his brow furrowed with determination.  “Look, I know you overheard. I know this weird for you, it’s weird for me too.”
“I apologize for my lack of action, Mister Malfoy. It was a critical lapse of judgment on my end.” Draco rolled his eyes. McGonagall’s lips pursed and she sat in silence for a moment. “As you know, some… high profile students have their post screened before being delivered in the morning.”
, nothing angered him more than the incessant squeaking of snow caked shoes echoing through the castle because clearly 90% of the school had grown up in a bloody stable. In many ways, he often felt like a tea kettle waiting to boil.
He couldn’t control the reactions of other nor their mistreatment of him, so instead, Draco found other outlets for his rage.  He focused his anger on how dry and hot the air in the eighth year dorms were compared to the comfortable cool humid air of the dungeons, or how the clocks in the classrooms were too loud when he couldn’t get the tables right near the doors.  He hated when his quill dipped unevenly into his inkwell and left various shades of dark gray instead of the pitch black it should be, he hated when he woke up late and couldn’t shower first.
Longbottom in the eight or so hours they’d been housed together was quite alright, unexpectedly so.  Their only interaction had been a curt nod in the morning when Draco was on his way to the loo while Longbottom was leaving to head to the Great Hall for breakfast.
The fire crackled harshly. Draco, still groggy from a Fiendfyre dream, shot up in panic and backhanded his inkwell into the stone wall. The piercing shatter of glass brought him back to life.  It was only then that he realized that the essay was due the
Draco couldn’t hold back a scoff.  Bitterness and the snide drawl of his younger self bled into his tone.   “With all due respect Headmistress, were you going to address this anytime soon or did having a certain Gryffindor student of yours mentioned as well send you into action? Or were you, perhaps, waiting to see if the harassment would go away on its own before you had to intervene?”
He picked at the wax seal with trembling fingers, barely taking note of the hefty weight of the scroll. He felt like he was going to be sick as he slowly unfurled the tea(?), coffee(?) stained parchment.  Draco couldn’t help but take a moment to roll his eyes.  Potter’s handwriting was as messy as the parchment his letter was written on.
Potter continued undeterred “I don’t how you feel but I’m sick of fighting.”  It felt like he was trying to slap the air with the force he used to raise his hand. “Truce?”
He didn’t even care that his silk pajama top had shifted upward with his movement and the ice cold floor burned at his back, nor that the tip of his quill was digging into one of his dimples of Venus. Early morning light seeped in from the windows and began blinding Draco as he willed the floor to swallow him whole.  If Hogwarts was truly as sentient as legend claimed, now was the fucking time to prove it.
The majority of the opening feast was a blur of the same false, overtly saccharine drivel about unity and picking up the pieces that the pretentious pricks in the Wizengamot spewed after his and his mother’s trials. Draco lazily swirled the pumpkin juice in his goblet to keep himself entertained.  He just wanted the ceremonial bullshit to be over with so he could retire to his room and get drunk in the safety of his canopied bed.
Potter was jogging towards him, his merry band of Gryffindors running after him.  In any other situation, Draco would collapse from laughter at the various levels of shock and disgust displayed on their faces.  However, he had to fight to keep his face neutral at the painful twist in his gut. Potter was suddenly too close. He rushed out, “would you like to sit with m—um, us?” Draco lost the battle as his eye widened in shock.
Of course Potter—Harry, ever the saviour, rushed in to save him once more, the prick.  “Yeah, peachy.”
Draco’s body tensed as tentative footsteps brought Harry closer.  “Do you… do you want to talk about it?”
The sandwiches tasted of nothing and he kept his focus on the swirl of his tea as he stirred it with his spoon absentmindedly.  It was mere weeks before students were to return to Hogwarts.  He quirked his eyebrow in thought.  Perhaps it wasn’t too late to find a tutor.  Perhaps he would have to do what he secretly wished for when everything came crashing down after the trials.  Perhaps it would be for the best if he studied for his N.E.W.T.S on his own in the safety of the Manor.
let that prick win?  He wasn’t going to quit now, after everything he’d given up so far.  Come hell or high water, he
Draco’s fingers began to tremble and his lip quivered as Dumbledore entered the frame of Snape’s portrait. His eyes stung when the man gave him a gentle acknowledging nod of his head.
“Shit! Sorry!” Harry’s apology rumbled against his chest.”  The man’s dark arms flew off him in a flash.  He took a step back and bashfully rubbed his hand against the back of his neck. “I kind of learned how to comfort people from Mol—Mrs. Weasley… and Ron. And, well, that’s how they do it.  Sorry about that. Again.”
“I make the recovery period easier for my patients.” Malfoy searched Harry’s face one final time before getting to his feet. Harry watched the man clear his throat and run a hand back through his hair before he busied himself by rummaging through Harry’s hospital bag on the table.
. Don’t scare ‘Mione like that you prick.” Ron’s voice was level, but deep. Hermione gave a grateful smile towards Ron, giving Harry’s hand another squeeze.  Her eyes beamed with pride.
“You’ve looked better.” Malfoy spent another moment staring at Harry before turning his gaze back down to the clipboard, scribbling something else down. “Eliza will come by and return your clothes and belongings to you so you’re ready for your release this afternoon. You’re not in the condition to leave by yourself, so Granger told me she would side-apparate you home.”
stropped into the Nurses Station to summon me here with a face like a slapped arse.” She hopped off the bed, stretching her back. “Bless him, I’m so surprised he has such nice teeth considering how hard he clenches his jaw.” She gasped to herself, as if an idea had struck her mind like lightening. “Maybe he has veneers-“
After the war the Ministry allocated more funding to the wizarding hospital – originally to keep up with treating injured victims of war, but continued almost as reparations for the lives that were needlessly lost due to the corruption and ignorance of the, now late, ex-Minister of Magic: Cornelius Fudge. Harry’s mind wandered back to his fourth year at Hogwarts, and the way the ex-ministers’ face contorted with rage in response to the news of Voldemort’s return. Harry bit his tongue and mentally strained to keep his mind from wandering far; he did not wish to think ill of the dead. Harry did not have to keep his thoughts on a mental leash for long, as a young blonde-haired medi-nurse softly called his name as she opened the door to the room.
Within ten minutes Harry had gone upstairs, changed into a pair of black sweatpants and a dark green hoody and left his house with Ginny. She waited for him at the end of the garden path as he locked his front door, before making his way down the steps towards her. Truth be told, feeling the late autumn breeze against his skin felt amazing. The evening air was damp as a consequence of the afternoon rain, which Harry could smell within the air. Leaves scuttled across the ground by their feet as they began to make their way down the street. They walked to a small, family owned coffee-shop a few streets away under Ginny’s guidance, where she bought them both an Americano before leading Harry to the local park. The streetlights were beginning to light up as they entered through the park gates, which illuminated the tall, marble fountain that stood as the park’s centrepiece upon miles and miles of greenery and nature. They walked down a cobblestone path, leading them closer to the fountain, close enough so Harry was able to faintly hear the sound of the trickling water.
Flashing images of green eyes hidden behind wire frames and sparkling teeth were accompanied by hearty laugher and broken sobs in such quick progression that Draco felt his knees buckle. The phantom feeling of hot kisses and teeth clipping against his neck and collarbones was replaced with the phantom weight of a head buried into his shoulder and the feeling of hot tears soaking into his shirt.  Anger bubbled up inside him and consumed all other feelings as Draco dug his fingernails into the palms in his curled fists. He swallowed every unhelpful thought and emotion down into a dark place until the foamy taste of bile disappeared from the back of his throat.
Harry’s shook out the image of blood pouring down a shower drain and looked up to see Malfoy staring directly at him. Malfoy had pushed his plate forward to signal he was done with the meal, though the chicken and vegetables on the plate had barely been touched. His hands were clasped in front of him, and his posture has returned rigidly straight. “Doing what?”
Draco reached across to grab a coat from a stand that was out of sight from Harry as he stood on the doorstep.
Hermione, who was sat on the chair on the opposite side of Harry’s bed, spared a quick upwards glare at her bewildered husband as she tutted in light irritation. “Oh behave Ronald! He has earned his qualifications just as much as any another Healer. Don’t be so judgemental.”
“Good afternoon. I haven’t had time to review your chart yet, so if you could tell me your symptoms that would be extremely helpful. I have made my own assumptions based on the conditions of the blinds. Are you suffering from retinal dysfunction?”
Pushing his chair backwards Draco slowly began to stand himself up. He braced himself for a moment as the thunderous throbs in his brain ricocheted. He waited for the throbbing to subside slightly before he stepped out of the station. The young sandy haired healer scurried away in the direction of the canteen as Draco marched his way down the opposite corridor. He could barely hear the fast retreat of the other Healer over the sound of his grinding teeth.
The next day, wizards and witches nationwide swooned softly at the photo of five-year-old son putting a single rose on a newly buried grave, mouthing “Mummy”. The very same day, a man in his late twenties carefully cut out the exact same photo and put it in an album half-filled with photos of the same boy at various ages. He spent long moments looking at the newest addition to his collection, all the while covering the boy's mouth with the tip of his thumb. Hoping he could block out the child's utter. Like he wished the boy had said something else.
“Dad, I know your relationship with Malfoy wasn't the best in school, but don't you dare say things about Diane just because she's remotely related to him. Besides, it's not the worst thing being related to Malfoy, you know?”
birthday. Her death inevitably turned into a relentless wave in the media as papers were filled with articles soaked with the most sympathetic condolences to Harry and the family, especially to the poor little boy who had to part with his dear mother at such a tender young age. They then went on to tell the tales of the wife of the Chosen One, her innocent days at Hogwarts, her bravery during the War, her immense strength that served as an emotional pillar for her husband, how the wretched illness robbed her of her youthful life. Ginny's funeral, originally meant to be a quiet affair, ended up with journalists standing on their toes waiting for a chance to see the solemnly pained face of Harry Potter at the family cemetery at Godric's Hollow, where Ginevra Potter's body laid. Camera flashes went off with a thousand clicks at the sight of a single tear rolling down each cheek.
, Harry wistfully thought when he spied his wife singing a lullaby to their son as she gently rocked him to sleep.
Weeks after that, when the fervour of the crowd had died down and people no longer swarmed the cemetery wanting a last look at the hero, an old woman came to visit. She had bulbs of lilies and narcissus with her, which she planted around the grave with care.
At twenty, James was as excitable as a child half his age at the train station waiting for his first trip to Hogwarts. It was actually not really far from the truth, Harry mused, since it was the day he first started working at the Ministry. As he listened to the young man animatedly reporting his first day at work, he could almost see the story as words excitedly written in the letter his son had sent home after his first day at school.
The sound of Diane's footsteps became fainter and when a wooden door closed somewhere in the house, James walked towards the opposite sofa and dropped himself down rather rudely. Still glaring, still frowning at his father. After that the room was still, silent but for the suddenly too loud chiming of a grandfather's clock, one of those pretentious Malfoy antiques. Not even their breaths could be heard, nor the usual stomping and shouting of Albus in his room. Diane was probably up there, trying to keep their son quiet. The silence was of the unnerving kind, heavy like air before a storm, just waiting for the first strike or thunder as the sign of violence.
Only when they went passed the rows of disapproving Malfoy portraits did Harry remember. The fury James was harbouring was identical to that he once saw in Malfoy's eyes years ago when they were still schoolboys. Those were quite unpleasant memories, however, and Harry quickly swallowed them down like a particularly bitter potion.
All of the sudden, Harry was seeing a lot of Malfoy. He saw Malfoy when he stopped by the FD to turn in evidence or to receive a report; he found Malfoy chewing on his sandwich alone in a corner of the cafeteria; he had a glance of blond hair in the crowded lift in the morning rush; he used the Floo next to Malfoy's after work. Each time Malfoy acted as if he did not know Harry. Actually, he acted as if he did not know anyone but his team and Kingsley, obviously a poor attempt to erase his dark past and the offending tattoo underneath his sleeve. But that suited Harry just fine. He was still not fond of the man, despite being the one who spoke for him at the trial; however he felt no need to taunt on their past. As far as he concerned, they did not owe each other anything.
What inside was an old nursery. Soft toys on shelves and in opened trunks. Charmed magical animals running on colourfully painted walls. Soft blue carpet underneath his feet. A wide window looking out to the Manor grounds, facing a small lake and the forest afar. A cupboard full of baby things, clothing and napkins and potions. A few books on an old rocking chair. A cot in the middle of the room, green and white and looking untouched.
Harry shook his head, his mind coming back to the room. He swallowed the lump in his throat, letting out an awkward laugh. “I was under the impression they were broken, not missing… No wonder breathing is a little tricky aye?” Harry’s awkward laugh turned into a shallow raspy cough, that brought Harry to clutch his sides, hugging his sides together as if to keep his organs in.
When Draco left Harry for what was now the second time, he convinced himself that he had officially shattered anything that could have happened between the two of them and that would be the end of that.
Harry groaned as he felt Malfoy’s teeth against his neck, biting on a tendon, just below where his hands were. Harry bucked his hips and felt Draco’s erection strain against his own. Draco hissed and moved his hands to tangle his fingers within Harry’s hair. Harry continued to rock his hips against Draco’s, loving the burning white pleasure that spread throughout his body. Draco whined and pushed back against Harry, frotting against him senselessly. Harry gripped Malfoy’s hips hard and moved Draco’s hips back and forth to control his rhythm. Harry was completely overwhelmed by pleasure. His mouth was agape slightly he felt soft lips move eagerly against his own, and he moaned into Malfoy’s mouth as he kissed back. “F-Fuck I’m close I’m gonna-“
