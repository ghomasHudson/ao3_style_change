Ginevra was carding her fingers through Lovegood's hair while Blaise and Neville whispered to each other. Granger was on the couch opposite Draco and Potter, and much like Draco, was rubbing her boyfriend's feet in her lap. Pansy, Millie and Daphne were in a corner with Goldstein and Abbot helping them study. Thomas and Finnigan were down in the Quidditch stands, Draco was quite sure, making out with each other.
Hermione stared at her, bewildered.
‘What in the name of God has happened to this room?’ he asked, gesturing around him.
Draco craned his neck too, excited and eager. It was a simple tattoo of a fox sleeping curled up, it's tail tucked in with its hind legs. Decorating its head, almost as if it was a crown, was a small flame.
'And I,' someone said from the far back and it rang through them all like a war cry. Harry watched as more and more took it up. He smiled at McGonagall and snaked his arm around Draco's waist.
‘What?’
Evenings in the common room included homework interspersed with quidditch discussions, exploding snaps or occasionally, hair styling competitions between Millie and Lovegood. Drunk nights saw Pansy forcing a game of Truth and Dare on them all and everyone falling asleep in front of the fire. If sometimes his head fell on Potter's shoulder, who always sat next to him, or on his lap, Draco pretended to be ignorant of it.
‘RON!’
Draco got it after a moment. 'You want me to come with you?'

Draco and Ginevra were the only two people in the castle not waiting for the rain to pour no matter how many times they've been caught with their heads out of the windows. Yes, their plants needed the rain but they didn't. It wasn't their duty to make others believe them.
She stared at the Invisibility Cloak and growled, ‘Out! Detention!’
Pansy was more a snake than anyone else in Slytherin and Blaise knew it. They shared a childhood together and he had gone through her puberty with her. That was the reason she couldn’t understand why Blaise didn’t see what was clear as day to anyone with eyes.
The little girl immediately hid behind Hermione.
‘None of us can find her because she’s not one of us. She’s a witch, just like her parents. And she’s gone off to their world. She’s gone to Hogwarts!’
It hit him two weeks later. He had seen it all wrong, all in the reverse. Harry wasn’t following Malfoy.
‘No, but they all occurred at the same time,’ Cas said, frowning. He looked at Dean and Sam. ‘These reports of the victims, they are in the evening editions of the newspapers.’
Draco had to give him a once over then. 'Yes, I can see that.'
‘It’s very possible that we may not prevent the next incident from happening but all this preparation will help us protect the other unfortunate souls who are no doubt on the list.’
‘Dean,’ Cas said, turning to him, ‘after all these years you should know it’s not possible to save everyone.’
'Yes,' they replied in unison.
'If I didn't know better Dean, I'd think you were being purposefully jealous, riling me up.'
'Don't even think of conning it out of me or worse, convincing me to do it. This is one thing you'll have to do without, Potter.'
‘I like chaos. There hasn’t been much of it in the afterlife. I miss it,’ Tonks winked from her portrait.
'Shh,' Draco whispered, bouncing Teddy on his knee and looking pleadingly at Harry.
Pansy, Daphne and Millie had got some trinkets, rings and other accessories for all the girls while Blaise imported an Italian Bellflower plant for Neville. The purchases were all made through owl-post, from stores suggested by Narcissa Malfoy, under the name of Madame Zabini.
: Be righteous
'Here's to enigmatic Ravenclaws and their eccentric minds.'
‘This entire thing is fucking frustrating,’ he grunted, running his hands through his hair and tugging at it, a part of him wanting to rip it out entirely. ‘Today can’t get any worse.’
'Thank you.'
'You don't exactly have to love something, Ron, to appreciate its beauty. Affection only adds depth to admiration, it doesn't sustain it.'
He stood up to walk away. 'Oi, ferret!' Ron called.
‘One, it’s insane, not impossible,’ Draco corrected. ‘Two, we are stuck with paperwork because of your overzealousness in our last raid which means you brought this upon us. Three, I’m doing the remaining thirty so please, shut up.’
‘Some of them are going to take a while. But I can say that she didn’t have her memory erased. Someone cast a very strong shield on her mind. It’s difficult to break it and look through. I suspect the shield is also designed in such a way that it harms both the child here and the one trying to destroy it.’
‘Now, Sammy,’ Dean said groggily, ‘I’d love to have explored that possibility had the ghost not been that of a 70 year old man.’ He stretched his arms and smirked at both of them.
Harry didn't want to sing in front of Draco but Teddy woke up when he had sat and Harry had no choice.
'We regret not being courageous, not making the correct choice and not knowing right from wrong. We know how you all feel because we lost friends and family too.'
'Did Hugo want to draw a Dragonosaurus again?' Harry asks in the way of greeting.
‘I just don’t want them fighting because of me.’
Draco and Potter burst out laughing.
‘Dean..’ Sam began.
'If I knew pushing Harry to get his head out of his arse and talk to Draco would have smooch level consequences, I wouldn't have done it,' Weasley said, exasperated.
‘Who is she?’ Ginny asked, standing up.
'And how are you, Harry? Have you been to your therapist, of late?' Ron asked after Draco left.
‘Nothing,’ Hermione cut in before Ron could object. ‘Go and sleep. You look like a zombie.’
Important members (royalty)- Tom Riddle Jr., Seamus Finnigan, Daphne Greengrass, James Sirius, Mary Thomas (Dean Thomas' mother)
‘Can you tell us about the accident that orphaned your niece, Ms.Hope?’ Sherlock asked, after ensuring that the lady was sufficiently composed.
'HARRY!' He bellowed.
Narcissa hummed.
'Blaise and I too.'
'Anything?' Potter asked, a small smile playing on his lips.
Harry raised his brows but nodded and began to go his way. His friends were still arguing behind him. They haven't spent quality time owing to their busy schedules but maybe they could talk this issue out? It could just be stress.
Potter whipped around at the speed of light, a twinkle in the corner of his green eyes.
'You are being ridiculous, Potter. Why do you think people are always up to something?'
Potter stared at him some more before smiling tiredly. 'Get out, Draco.'

‘A ten year old popped into Wheezes today,’ Ron said, eyes wide and bright.
‘Rosie Watson,’ Sherlock replied, cuddling her closer. Neither of them spoke for a while and it became increasingly clear to John with every passing moment that he would once again have to be the mature one. Sherlock’s antics never grew old and John never tired of them, but he wouldn’t admit to the latter even if his life were on line. Doing the only thing he could, he threw his hands up in the air, rolled his eyes and went to take his four year old. Half an hour later, Rosie was in her bed, the floor was cleared up and John took the chair opposite his friend, steam billowing from the beverage in his hands.
----------
Sherlock was spared from further explanation by the arrival of the very woman they had been talking about. Emma Hope was a middle aged, black haired and frantic eyed spinster who had moved to Baker street ten months ago. She lived with her ailing mother and her niece, whom she had been taking care of since her sister and her husband died seven years ago. Nancy Lovhood was the ten year old who had gone “missing.” Both men observed keenly as she limped her way to the chair they set out for their clients, John’s racy brain quickly concluding that her limp must be from tripping on the last step she very obviously missed on the stairs in her hurry to come up.
'Hey! I call dibs on
Sam rolled his eyes. ‘Okay, this is what we know till now: seven different kinds of creatures have been preying on people left, right, centre for about two months and these are more powerful than the ones we previously faced, almost impossible to kill.’
'She won't. Sirius is very charming,' Harry replied, tugging Draco closer.
‘You don’t believe a word she spoke,’ John said, looking his friend in the eye. There was never a Morrison’s case or a trip to Bath. Sherlock had spontaneously made that up.
The first time it happened, Harry was happy. Zacharias Smith was being human for once, and the Slytherins were getting the respect they deserved. Though he initially doubted the rumours, he had to believe them when Smith and Terry Boot apologised to Draco right in front of him.
A loud cry sounded around a small town. ‘Great news at last! Harry Potter is dead!’
‘Oh yes,’ said John leaning back but he took Sherlock’s cue and refrained from speaking more.
‘Begin,’ Sam ordered.
‘What Cas meant was that,’ Dean said from where he was standing by the window and gazing intently beyond it, ‘something dark is about to happen. Dark and dangerous.’
Potter's mouth closed over Draco's as his hands, his hot hands, roamed all over. Draco smirked to himself.
Parkinson sneered. ‘He won’t admit so I’m trying to confirm. I have a wager to win.’
'Are they Sirius and Prof. Lupin, Harry?' Lovegood asked, pointing at the dog and wolf on either side of his waist.
'On the contrary,' Daphne said, picking the cigarette out of Millie's mouth. 'If the Gryffindors have had any influence on him, he would have physically tackled you both.'
‘If you help me with this, ‘Mione’s going to believe me, we’ll patch up and Parkinson would be off your back. Think carefully.’
‘In place of who?’ Harry asked, curious. This was unlike Robards.
'No, because discreet is something you two are not. We know who each of you brought in and how many times.'
It was not often that their highly revered Headmistress Minerva McGonagall was stunned, literally or figuratively, so Draco supposed this was a momentous occasion. There was a sudden lack of air in the room at the gasp everyone took and it made the already sultry April afternoon even more uncomfortable than the silence in the room. Draco thought it was totally unwarranted because Longbottom's idea was, for lack of better words, astoundingly marvellous.
‘Technically, it did happen in front of me,’ Tonks deadpanned, eyes gleaming.
'Garden gnomes love rain dancing, did you know?' Ginevra said. 'Or maybe only those of the Weasley garden variety do. De-gnoming becomes ten times harder.'
Pansy descended from behind Ginny, hair wild, expression so cold that Harry flinched as though hexed. Smith was still gathering his wits when Harry locked eyes with Draco, clutching his bouquet.
'You and me both,' Pansy empathised. 'I told Draco so many times that he was just assuming things that I ended up nursing a headache most evenings.'
‘She was up all night doing God knows what,’ he shook his head as he blew on his tea.
'But,' Potter said softly, 'they are not the good sort, you know.'
‘And yours is much easily accessible right here on the table,’ Sherlock replied, quickly shooting a text message. ‘Come on, John. We have a child to find,’ he continued, picking up his coat and sauntering out the door.
'Of course,
Harry smiled. The world would remain a beautiful place no matter how many wars, physical or emotional, try to wreck it. And if it wasn't, then he was sure he could make it to the other end with his group of friends by his side. It was a quiet and comforting thought.
Ron took it from her immediately and tossed it over to Ginny, who became Pansy's next target for leap practice. Ginny held her arm high above Pansy's head, ducking and swerving and keeping the cam out of reach.
Dean narrowed his eyes at Sam. ‘Are you babying me?’

‘I’m not really surprised,’ Cas said, coming over. ‘If it did, our work would become too easy.’
‘No.’
‘What are you guys doing here?’ she asked. ‘And who is this little woman?’ Ginny crouched in front of her and held out a hand.
‘A ten year old apparated alone into our shop with no memory of who she is or where she’s from,’ Ron amended.
He's truthful for once. 'I don't know. Half of it is the neck, though.' He bends his neck again and this time an audible snap releases. Harry's beyond happy. It's going to settle Ron. For now. Ron always looks like he suspects, and Harry thinks he really does, but he doesn't ask and Ron doesn’t tell.
‘So,’ Cas said, ‘what you mean to say is that nobody among the victims’ family, friends or acquaintances lodged a complaint?’
Harry likes how he can always count on his children to bring randomness into his routine. Once upon a time, it was the extra morsel of food he ate without the Dursleys knowing, then it was Voldemort and after him was Ginny. Like it or not, Harry is forced to acknowledge that it has been some time since life with Ginny became monotonous.
Two hours later, Harry was filling out the official records of the second case when a panting Ron waddled into their room and collapsed in a chair, interrupting their workflow. Harry exchanged a look with Draco and set his quill aside, taking the empty glass on his table and casting an Aguamenti. Ron took a large gulp of it before throwing his head back and running his fingers through his hair.
Or may be not so lucky after all.
Harry didn't comment on "us" or "Zach". He tried not to think whether or not Draco would have invited him if he hadn't asked, what "want to come along" meant. He frowned.
McGonagall approached them then. 'I see that your plants are growing,' she said without preamble. 'Yes, Professor,' Luna replied in awe. The smiles on their faces grew as they watched more shoots push up from the ground. The tiny leaves sparkled as the floodlights caught the water on their surfaces.
‘Well,’ Hermione said, lowering her voice. ‘The Unspeakables need to get something checked and we needed someone we could trust. Parvati, I want you to analyse her blood.’
When at last the quest for an answer was fruitful, it was in the unlikeliest of manners and by the unlikeliest of person. Harry woke up to a kick in his stomach to stare directly into the dangerously gleaming eyes of a stout man not much older than him.
Draco was surprised. ‘Why, yes Potter, there is something underneath that thick skull after all!’
‘It happened in spring, sir, and I remember every detail of it as if it had happened yesterday. Jane and Tony always took a trip around that time of the year to Scotland, to Hogwarts that is, where they had first met. They usually spent a week in a cottage they owned in the nearby countryside. It felt silly in the beginning but such are the follies of teenage love.’ Ms.Hope sniffed slightly, before continuing. ‘You see, Mr.Holmes, the cottage is situated at a good twenty minute drive through the village. It's mountainous terrain and the roads are rocky. On the fateful day, my sister called me ten minutes before they had started from there to inform me of her arrival in a few hours. Wizards have magical transport, Mr.Holmes. They can disapparate at one place and appear at another, they travel by brooms and there is also the floo network or the travel that happens through the interconnected fireplaces. The cottage didn’t have floo services and Jane and Tony preferred to travel the muggle way. It was something mundane to be cherished in otherwise extraordinary lives.’ Ms.Hope exhaled a deep, sad sigh that hinted at what was to come.
Blaise rolled up his scroll. ‘Forever or not, separation is a natural part of relationships.’ He began packing his materials into his bag. ‘It’s normal. Stop worrying yourself over someone else’s relationship. I want at least one year to be peaceful.’ He started walking towards the boys’ dorms.
‘I can’t not involve myself when it happened right in front of my eyes!’ Pansy exclaimed, tired of convincing her friend.
‘I’m not doing that,’ Cas refused and leaned back next to Sam, who was looking on expectantly.
Kreacher's usual retaliation included grumblings of how 'It's Merlin's sake, master is being a wizard!' and murmurs of 'Master be knowing rooms in the house to be befitting of the lord of the most ancient and noble house of Black' and rare snaps of how 'Living room be for the family (with a pointed look at Draco), and parlour be for the guests (with a pointed look at others). Potter and his elf's banter and growing relationship was something Draco absolutely loved to see. And Kreacher's interactions with Sirius were positively a riot.
'Oh hush!' Hermione cut in. 'You know they are trying to rile you up. Why do you want to give them more fodder?'
‘His actions prove otherwise.’
'A stag and a baby deer, how cute.' Pansy's voice didn't have the usual steel.
Narcissa chuckled, looping her arm through Harry's. 'If you are lucky enough, Mr. Potter, I shall one day let you know about his broomstick,' she promised with a mischievous glint in her assessing eyes.
'It will be better if it rains, I think,' Lovegood said in her usual dreamy voice.
Ron mock gagged. 'I don't understand how you could tolerate this everyday for almost three months,' he told Pansy, waving a hand in Harry and Draco's direction.
Try as he might, he couldn't not get Draco a gift. He wrapped it, set it on the dresser in Draco's room, where Draco spent his time now, and cast a Disillusionment on it, timed to wear off on June 6th.
Daphne had done that for him, however, whining every possible minute she could about how potentially disastrous the others could think their gifts were. Pansy and Blaise, in their attempts to find courage in liquor since they seemed to lack it in themselves, added to it after stumbling into the common room drunk, half an hour later than the time they had fixed.
If their first kiss was any indication, Draco would be a fool to do anything of the sort. He smiled and snuggled into Potter, inhaling his scent and letting more tears fall. People passed by and Draco knew it was the first time he was crying openly, but he didn't care.
‘Rose,’ Hermione said, coaxing her out. ‘Say hi, this is Ginny.’ Rose peeked out from behind Hermione’s legs and gave a small, shy wave.
Sherlock raised his brows at that.
Almost immediately Cas appeared before him as if he had been waiting for Sam to call him. He swayed slightly clutching his abdomen and Sam guided him to the foot of his bed and propped him up on pillows. He then gently attended to Dean’s cut before settling him into a sitting position on the floor, leaning his head against his bed, next to Cas’ bouncing knee. Turning enquiring eyes on Cas, he crossed his arms across his chest and waited for him to say something.
'I'm on the side of peace. It's not everyday that I get to relax,' she replied, stretching herself on the grass, their picnic basket, food, towels and napkins spread out next to her. Sirius barked, as though in complete agreement with her and went to lie down beside her. Soon, the rest followed suit.
Hermione frowned.
‘No.’
‘He wanted to be
‘Why didn’t you say anything?’
‘What does this mean?’ He turned to his friends, who had thankfully recovered from their moment.
It only made sense the others told him what presents he would be receiving. 'Neville, I'm getting you that sea urchin cactus. You said that was the only species missing in your collection, right?' Potter asked.
‘It’s not just bad, it’s big too,’ he said without preamble.
'Did you see that?' Draco sounded excited.
'It's Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter, 'Mione. What did you expect?'
Nevertheless, their presence was comforting. A stray Siberian Husky trotted up to Harry after a while. He ran his fingers through its fur for the rest of the night.
This chapter is only for future reference.
'Trust Hermione to know all the irrelevant facts too.'
Heir- Dean Thomas Riddle
'I don't want to see all of your teeth, Draco.'
‘But best is what we have right now,’ Sam pointed out. ‘Dean, you are looking into the victims, I’m researching the London issue and Cas here is trying to establish telepathy with his group so that we may learn something.’
Potter whipped around, light spilling out of his beautiful eyes.
‘How do you mean?’ she asked from her place on Ron’s lap without putting down the book she was reading.
Of course, like everything Granger, it led to relatively quick and effective improvement in their relationship. 'Yes, I'm happy too,' Draco replied.
'Bobby will drop by at 5 in the evening. What about the armory?' Sam asked, turning around from his luggage to the staring contest between Dean and Cas.
Like a bolt out of the blue
Weasley turned around at that, looking pale and aghast. 'The fuck kind of consolation is that?'
Five minutes later, John and Sherlock heard the front door close behind their guest.
'When did Albus Severus ever draw me?' Jamie grumbles.
Sam Winchester jerked awake to the sound of something heavy falling on the floor. He peered into the darkness of his room. The shadows all looked much the same as the day before. Whoever it was who had stolen inside was either a figment of his imagination or hid remarkably well in a small chamber that was rapidly getting bathed in the rays of dawn filtering through the windows. From his experience, though, Sam knew that the probability of the latter was impossibly high. He quietly reached under his pillow for his revolver, rolled onto the other side of the bed and assumed an attacking stance with his weapon aimed in the direction the sound came from. Before the room could fully light up and give the intruder the advantage of surprise. The sight that met his eyes, however, took his breath away.
Ron noticed it first, the nearly unmistakable similarity to their sixth year. Nearly. It was both there and not there. He asked the one person who could reliably answer him.
After dinner, Harry reads a story to his kids while Ginny cleans up. By ten o’clock the Potter household goes to sleep.
'I'm going to bed,' Harry announced.
'I have six years of Healer training remaining,' Hermione pointed out.
Harry raised an eyebrow at that but his attention was drawn to the disgruntled noises Draco was making as he stomped up to them. Harry took his wrist and dragged him back to the edge of the lake.
'I didn't ghost you,' Harry retorted.
Blaise wanted to blame Pansy. She had unnecessarily involved them both in a mess that wasn’t related to them.
Granger and Weasley had sat them down after their "totally ridiculous" spat and gave them "the talk."
In his dazed state, Draco didn't know what words left his mouth. 'Ha-' He cut himself off mid whine and Potter sighed into his neck. 'Draco,' he whispered, resigned.
It seems to be their thing, and maybe it’s just what they needed.
“Aw babe, you could’ve just said something,” Pansy states, her voice laced with fake concern.
Draco is about to protest, but Potter carries on, refusing to allow any interruption. For a moment, Draco gets a strong glimpse of what it must be like when Potter’s on the job, when he senses that someone’s hiding something. Potter’s eyes are dark and are entirely focused on him. “Who are you? Are you involved in some sort of illegal activity?”
Ginny’s retort is already on her tongue, but then the Floo glows green and both Ginny and Draco look wide-eyed at each other.
Draco stirs, his head still in a daze, and Harry’s hand strokes soothingly — and a bit uncoordinated — over Draco’s skin. Without thinking, Draco puts his hand over Harry’s, lacing their fingers together, similar to how Harry had done a couple of hours earlier.
“That doesn’t change the fact that I haven’t seen you in almost three weeks. But you can make it up by praising my beauty in the photos.”
“Oh yeah, don’t worry people, Dick Spotter will save the day.”
Draco’s brain finishes. It’s not that he hadn’t known what Harry looked like topless before they’d become a couple, but then he touched his body, ran his fingers over every inch of skin.
brainstormed with me and helped me find a good title. You're both amazing.
Draco stumbles over an image and is reminded of one of the best nights of his life. There’s a catch though; of course, there is.
either.
Nobody’s been able to get under Draco’s skin the way Harry does, and he isn’t even trying. Never before has the slightest of physical contact made Draco want to melt into the touch. Nowhere else has Draco felt this safe.
That's why Draco had come back; Narcissa. Being a Healer, an expert in Spell Damage, can't help his mother if he’s hundreds of miles away. He can't support her from France, and he
“I’m sorry about earlier.”
Draco reassured himself.
“Malfoy.” His voice is husky, and the sound of it sends an unexpected shiver down Draco’s spine. “I can’t say I’m surprised to see you here… visiting.” He closes the book he’s been reading, and holds it up. “Looking for this, I presume.”
Ginny huffs out a laugh. “You have to be a bit more specific. The plant lover, the Hufflepuff, or the gay one?”
This month's chapter would not have been possible without
Harry mumbled things into Draco’s hair, words he wouldn’t remember later, as the stage went dark around them.
“Yep. I’ve already brought the plants from the flat to the shop downstairs and put two small electric heaters in there.” Draco feels a warm, calloused hand on top of his own, a thumb gently stroking over the back of his hand in a far too intimate fashion. “It’s all right. We’ll figure it out," Harry says softly. "Let’s just get to bed.” Draco gets up and walks to the front door because his first instinct is to put as much distance between them as possible. “And where do you think you’re going?” Harry asks, confused. “The flat’s still cold as ice.”
“Well, Fleur gave me one of her old Beauxbaton uniforms; Ron has always admired them immensely. Hermione helped with a wig resembling her Yule Ball hairstyle. And the crown and sash, of course.”
“That sounds like it’s a long, complicated story.”
“Quel bordel!” Draco yelps, scrambling to cover himself.
Harry Potter has evidently deigned to show up, and his outfit is as dramatic as his entry. His robes are black as night with Glitter Charms woven into the fabric, turning him into an enticing figure draped in inky night sky that holds Draco captive. His face is obscured by an elaborate masquerade mask, at odds with the dress of all the other attendees, but it fits with the overall aesthetic. Somehow, he has tamed his hair into an attractive sweep of curls that rings the mask and his bright, bright green eyes perfectly.
Draco has no idea how to deal with Harry fucking Potter sitting in his living room one Saturday morning.
“No more ink on my skin. I have enough marks for a lifetime,” Draco finally says, linking their arms before they walk rather
Then the mood shifts. Potter looks as if he’s trying to solve a difficult Arithmancy problem. His brows are knit together and his right hand is at his chin, fingertips stroking the stubble there.
Draco wants to point out that Harry, by agreeing to this, has made a rod for his own back, but he doesn’t. At this rate, they’re going to be late for the gala, which is simply out of the question.
Draco would protest if Pansy wouldn’t, in turn, tell him about every time he’s been whining about Potter. So he just smiles.
It happened two months later. Draco was working on replenishing their personal stack of Potions in his basement lab Harry had built for him years ago when he accidentally bumped into one of the cauldrons, and contents spilt on everything in a metre radius. The majority landed on himself.
The sound of their footsteps echo off the stone walls as they walk further down the passageway. Draco proceeds down the narrow path first, turning back occasionally to check on Potter’s progress. He doesn’t want to leave Potter behind, but he doesn’t want to allow Potter to get too close either. This past year has taught him as much: even in the most infuriating of circumstances, Potter has always managed to sweet-talk his way into Draco’s pants. Potter’s face may look innocent—all soft edges compared to his own—but Potter’s mouth is another story...
“I had two patients today who were calling you, and I quote” — Draco moves his fingers, making an air-quote gesture — “a hot, thick Top.”
It grows colder as he talks, the temperature in the stone passageway dropping several degrees as the torches extinguish themselves once they pass each scone. It feels like they’re chasing an ever shrinking pool of light, and they begin to pick up their pace, eager to get back to the warmth and light of the library’s fireplace. Potter presses closer, shivering slightly through that flimsy bathrobe of his, and Draco lets him.
“That doesn’t explain their presence in my living room.”
I know I'm late. Very late, but I've honestly had most of the chapter written by life decided to shred all my plan with a smile on its face. Anyway, here it is. I'm gonna work on the next one now, hoping it'll be out on time.
Draco knows he’ll probably fall asleep during the film again, he can barely keep his eyes open as it is, but he has to stay for Pansy. Hopefully, it’ll distract him enough to not think about Potter for now.
To be honest, Draco doesn’t remember how they’d got him to agree to this — he blames the booze that Pansy kept buying and Ginny’s persistence. It doesn’t matter at all. The fact is that for over a week, bags had been in the corner of his living room. And not just that. Harry fucking Potter invoked some kind of drunken promise of help from said pub night and is now perched comfortably in Draco’s flat, blowing air into something Draco can’t discern from his position.
anyone to dance. Draco resolves to stay in his corner until he is literally dragged onto the dance floor.
The first shackle falls off your right hand. You reach in your mouth to take out the piece of parchment he'd stuffed into it. You move your jaw to relax the strained muscles.
The moment Draco hears the unmistakable sound of wood snapping, he wants to cry. It’s not the first time it happened since he started at St Mungo’s a few years ago, but getting used to a new wand is a tiring procedure.
Draco’s job as an Unspeakable usually complicates his life instead of making it easy. Nobody, not even his mother, knows what he does. It’s both a blessing and a curse—Draco relishes the chance to make a difference, to do work that he finds meaningful and honourable; that differs very obviously from Lucius’ footsteps. However, all his work is shrouded in secrecy, done under the cover of plausible deniability—if it became public knowledge that an ex-Death Eater was working as an Unspeakable, the resulting scandal would spell the end of the Minister for Magic’s political career. This doesn’t bother him most of the time, but sometimes, in the deepest, darkest recesses of his heart, he wishes that someone, besides his colleagues, would know. Would know what he’s accomplished after the war, would know how far he’s come, would see beyond the Dark Mark on his arm.
“Pansy, you’re the worst.”
particular patch of skin.
By the time Draco has told Harry literally everything he can think of, the bottle of lemon vodka is nearing its end. Draco’s never been one for spilling his guts, and he’s not quite sure how or why it happened tonight. He’d briefly considered the possibility that Harry had spiked the booze with Veritaserum, but no matter why it came to happen, he feels relieved. A burden lifted from his shoulders.
"This is unacceptable," Draco remarks. "I'm gonna cut the direct line between our Floos, Pansy, if your wife continues to abduct innocent Healers from their houses."
As Draco steps out of the shop’s back door on his way to the greenhouses, the evening air hits Draco’s face with brutal force. All he truly desires now is a warm shower, but he has to check on the mimosas and a couple of other plants before he can make his way upstairs to Neville’s flat. After casting a gentle Lumos as to not interfere too heavily with the plants’ perception of night and day, he finishes the to-do list for the day. The mimosas are thankfully better; Luna must’ve given them a proper dose of happiness because Draco can see the early signs of new buds.
“You know that wouldn’t work. They’d probably drag me out of here, have a house-elf fix me and my clothes, and throw me back in like prey to a hoard of hungry lions.”
“Please, Draco. I need— I need—”
It’s when Potter says, “come to the rug, my darling,” a clear invitation in his voice, that Draco finally comes back to his senses. He inhales deeply, pushes himself away from Potter, and takes the final three steps towards the double doors.
"Yes, that," Harry answers.
“Oh, darling.” There’s this smirk on her face that Draco knows all too well.
“Who?” Ginny asks, motioning at Draco to quickly finish up.
Clothed in one of Harry’s heady-scented t-shirts, Draco tentatively slips beneath the quilt they’ll apparently be sharing. While Harry's bed is certainly big enough for two adults, they're lying closer than Draco would’ve liked. Every time Harry touches him — why in Circe’s name can’t he keep his hands to himself — his body responds way too much.
“Right back at you. And since you’re stalling, I’m figuring your date went either incredibly well or horribly bad.”
Even after over two hours of being here, Draco mostly keeps to himself. He listens with interest to conversations around him and drops a comment here and there, but he’s still nervous. These are Harry’s friends; a pride of lions. And they’re celebrating Hermione’s birthday, so it’s not a casual after-work thing that he could’ve skipped. Having Pansy beside him makes it a little more bearable, although she’s been integrated for years while he feels as if he’s being tested.
One of Draco’s hands finds its way into Potter’s raven hair, running through it in a caress. As Potter starts to swirl his tongue around the head, Draco can’t restrain himself any longer and unthinkingly, he grips a fistful of hair as his moans begin to fill the air. Potter begins to move his hand, stroking Draco’s cock from the base up until it reaches his mouth.
“Your house is clearly encouraging this," Draco tells him, laughing.
If Draco had to guess it’s not so much about him not telling her, but more about Harry possibly telling Hermione — because he can’t shut up sometimes — who then told Pansy.
Draco makes a lip-are-sealed-motion and watches giddily as Potter’s face morphs first into a pouty expression before he gives Draco the biggest puppy eyes.
As the finale crests, Potter steps forward, bending Draco over in a theatrical dip, and Draco takes the opportunity to tilt his chin upwards, clearly indicating a kiss. Potter’s eyes widen, his pupils getting big and dark, and he leans down to meet Draco halfway.
They stare at each other, having one of those silent conversations married couples have, confusing Draco horribly. He’d remember if anyone had told him before, or if he’d read it in the Prophet. Potter being gay would’ve made the headlines for weeks.
It’s not that he sees Harry as any less of a man because he enjoys being fucked by him. It doesn’t make him “the woman in the relationship” or any such nonsense; that’s some heteronormative bullshit, and Draco knows it. Despite that, applying the same notions to himself doesn’t work, although it makes no bloody sense.
Draco’s hand motions for Harry to continue.
“I reckon the plants agree.”
It’s great to be famous, they said, but what they withhold is the price you have to pay for that. All the money and awards could never replace the lost years or anonymity. Every step you take, especially missteps, was splattered across the tabloids, discussed heatedly on the internet and other public forums. You could never be yourself — as soon as you stepped outside of the house, you were always a role model, an ambassador for one cause or another. Fifty people in one person.
“You were drunker than I thought,” Potter mumbles to himself, but Draco can still hear it. “All the stuff here is for Ron’s stag night. You promised you’d help me with the last-minute preparations.”
These lines were the first thing Draco had said after the doctor had informed them about Pansy passing. They’d been sitting in the car back to the hotel. Harry had been worried because Draco had shut himself off the moment the words had left the doctor’s mouth. At that moment, he’d been looking out of the window — utterly lost and fragile. Harry had been holding his hand, but other than that he didn’t know what to say. ‘Sorry’ wasn’t enough, actually no word in the English language could encompass what Harry was feeling.
Potter doesn’t give him any time to react before he leans in, his thumb stroking gently over Draco's left cheek. It’s a light, soft kiss, just a brush of their lips. It's completely unlike all the other times that they’ve done this before. Potter’s face is shining as they break apart, and he begins to laugh, but his gaze isn’t focused on Draco. It’s directed on something just to Draco’s right.
He goes to take a swig of champagne, but the glass slips from his fingers as someone grabs his arm and drags him onto the dance floor.
“That sounds like a lovely idea. Harry makes a mean hot chocolate.”
“You can’t hide in there forever.”
“Well, since you’re our best customer, how about I make it up to you over dinner maybe?”
Silence descends again, bringing with it a tension so thick that you could cut through it with a wand. Opposite him, most of Potter’s face is cast in shadow.
Potter swings around in the middle of wearing a hole in the carpet to stare at Draco. “The what now?”
Before Draco can even process the meaning behind her words, Ginny steps through the flames, grabs his hand, and drags Draco to her house.
. That was the worst word that Potter could’ve chosen. Something to use and then toss aside. Draco’s biggest regret was that he ever allowed himself to feel something for Potter, that he had ever allowed himself to believe that they could have been something more.
It’s actually quite nice to watch them together, laughing and insulting each other. Eventually, they’re done with both folders, and Draco finally gets his turn. He looks at two pictures of Pansy and Ginny before putting the folder aside — there are things you don’t want to see.
Draco’s skin prickles as Harry’s magic washes over them, and he knows that he never stood a fighting chance.
“Well done, Potter. Maybe there’s still hope for you after all. Ten points to the Aurors for Potter’s great detective skills.” Draco says mockingly. He looks out of the window, trying to cover up the fact that his cheeks are heating up once more.
Their breaths become shorter, jagged, and Harry loses his rhythm. Two more strokes are enough for Draco to spill all over the sheets. Draco’s barely conscious enough to notice when Harry reaches his own release shortly after him, but the shout of pleasure is hard to miss.
“We can certainly try.” Harry smirks at him and kisses him again.
“I guess you’re right.” Harry runs his hands through his hair. ”I just never had to deal with meeting the parents before. When I dated Ginny, I’d already known Arthur and Molly for years. And with the others, it just never happened.”
“What happened to Harry?”
In between, flashes from last night creep back into his head. The harder Draco forces them out, the more they come back. Every inch of his body that Harry has touched tingles, and it's amazing and awful all at the same time. A once-in-a-lifetime thing, and Draco wishes he hadn't been tipsy when it happened.
“Good evening, London,” he greeted them.
For the first time in a long time, Draco is happy. He enjoys the walk to Harry’s house as well as the domesticity of brushing their teeth standing next to each other. Nevertheless, he’s knackered, so knackered, in fact, that Harry has to help him to get into bed.
In the background, there’s the click of a lock turning over, and then the sound of wood creaking. They break apart and look over to the heavy double doors of the library. In the orange light of the fire, they can see that one door has swung open, a tiny crack that lets in the cool air of the dim passageway beyond.
The silence that follows is very awkward. Draco doesn’t want to say goodbye yet, and even Potter appears to be torn between staying and leaving.
have to work in the morning.”
Draco first ran into Neville at a Healer symposia a few years back. His speeches on herbal and plant-based remedies caught Draco’s attention, and since then, they’ve shared many conversations over lunches and dinners during similar events. For hours, Neville has spoken about the plants — some truly rare — in his greenhouses. While Draco is familiar with most of them because his mother tended to them at Rosier Villa, he’s been itching for so long to see Neville’s collection. Now, he finally gets to see them with his own eyes.
He’s got a fake boyfriend to convince into becoming his real boyfriend.
he thinks at first before he mentally curses himself at carelessly leaving Unspeakable notes lying around in Potter’s house.
to help her. There's this overwhelming guilt hanging over him, the notion that her poor condition is ultimately his fault. It follows him like a shadow everywhere he goes.
As if on queue, Daphne enters the living room. “Actually, I just wanted to avoid the constant poking of a certain redhead.” She holds out two folders, and Ginny eyes them greedily. Ever since this year’s motto reveal, she’s been excited to see the finished products.
“Who?” his mother asked, and the weight of his father’s gaze caused him to blurt the name of the only single man he could think of.
Then, Potter stops touching him. Draco watches as Potter’s left hand moves from his cock to his hips, joining his right hand to hold him in place as the bastard takes his time to slowly run his lips lightly over Draco’s cock, until Draco’s head falls back against the window pane with a resounding thump. Potter’s hands are keeping him from thrusting forward, so he has no chance to get the friction he needs. Draco pants, too lost to be able to form any kind of coherent thought. He can feel sweat forming on his forehead and his neck, and his entire body is on fire.
is my knight in shining armour.  I can always count on you, darling. Thank you so much for all your help on this. <3
Harry frowns. “What story?”
They resume their walk back to the library. Potter breaks the silence first. “So, you said this was because of the house? What’s up with it?”
Thank you so much,
“It’s going to be fine, Harry. It’s better to meet my parents like this than to face them two-on-two for a Sunday lunch. Ginny and Pansy will be there as well. So will a lot of other people you know.”
“If you’re a good boy and get me a new wand, I might be persuaded to tell you.”
“Well, I prefer cock, but the occasional prick doesn't hurt.”
The room is filled with moans, murmured swears, and slick slaps of skin on skin. Then, Harry presses open-mouthed kisses on Draco’s neck, his jaw. The second he gently bites into his earlobe, Draco mewls.
“All right,” Neville sighs and leaves the flat.
Draco knows. But he doesn’t know what to do next.
whatever it is that you want to tell me. When you're finished, we should try to open the door again. I have better things to do than spend my evening stuck in here with you.”
“Okay,” Draco responds, readily dispatching the beverages on a nearby table and rolling up his sleeves. He’s never cooked before in his life, every single one of his meals having been made for him since the day he was born. He’d never admit that to Harry, though.
“All right. I still need to get dittany from the apothecary to speed up the healing process. I can’t wait to show my lovely wife.”
“Hello, stranger,” his best friend greets him flatly.
The playful smirk of Potter’s mouth makes the entire situation more embarrassing. He feels caught. Heat rushes into Draco’s cheeks, adding a nice touch of pink to his otherwise pale complexion.
“That will be rectified tonight then.”
“Leave!” you yell.
One day, however, Draco would give Pansy the party she deserves. And it would be perfect.
“You don’t send dick pics if you want to say thank you?” Ginny asks at the same time as Pansy says, “Must’ve been quite a shag.”
“To the wall, hands on your head,” you order.
“What? Where?” Ginny is already at his side.
You lost.
“Would you rather have a werewolf’s fur or a Hippogriff’s feathers?”
“Oh fuck. I hadn’t realised… fuck. This is bad. This is so very bad. Can someone please throw me to the bottom of the Black Lake?” Draco’s hands bury themselves inside his hair.
“Know it was you? I adjusted them so that only you could enter without encountering any obstacles. Anyway, this plan was just thrown together at the spur of the moment. I had hoped that well... this would make you reconsider our relationship."
to try storm his way out. The door shakes heavily, rattling in its hinges and glowing red as the spell sinks in, before it stills again. Draco sighs audibly.
“Time’s up, Potter! Now, come back with that lovely mouth of yours.”
Potter gives Draco one more quick kiss, and then his hot mouth finds its way to the soft skin just behind Draco’s ear, before he kisses his way down from Draco’s jawline to his throat. Potter bites down gently, then licks over the bruised flesh. Draco moans, and in the same breath, tilts his head sideways.
Ginny is the first to laugh, but soon the entire table follows. Then, Pansy pretends to be a Prophet reporter asking questions about their bedtime activities. It turns into an 18+ game of ‘Never Have I Ever’ over food.
The clacking of her heels on the wooden floor becomes louder and louder as Pansy moves towards them. “Which one would I meet in the Ministry?” Draco looks up, directly into his best friend’s eyes. “Hi, Draco. Having fun down there? It’s my favourite position.” Pansy smirks at him.
The ringing of the alarm clock is the shrillest sound Draco has ever heard in his life. Draco isn’t sure if the horrible headache is caused by this or the liquor he was exposed to yesterday. In the small Healer kit he brought along, there are potions for almost every contingency, but since Draco didn’t think he’d get wasted while looking after plants, there's sadly no Hangover Cure to find in there.
Draco pulls away, batting Potter’s hand aside, and whispers seductively into his ear, “No, this is not how it’s going to end. You wanted me to take you on this lovely rug. So, get down, Harry, on the rug.”
Without hesitation, Ginny tells Harry she’ll pay him back before practically dragging her wife off the table. Pansy waves a quick hand at them on their way out.
“All right,” Harry drawls. “So, Mr I-need-a-proper-apology, what do you say about dinner tomorrow? I’ll cook.” Upon speaking the last words, Harry places a hand on Draco’s upper arm. Draco’s body leans — involuntarily — a little bit into the touch.
“Hermione and I have been presenting this one bill for months without success. Then, as a last-ditch attempt, she reaches out to Potter. He comes in, wearing his usual tight-fitting, and for once unwrinkled, robes. Basically, all he does is to smile brightly at the Wizengamot, and they pass it. How’s that fair?” She refills her glass and takes another sip. “How’s that fair?”
“I think I love my house,” Harry says, flopping back into the rug with a sigh.
Draco usually busies himself with the magazines lying around when Pansy is gone, but today, a binder catches his eye. He thumbs through it, looking at image after image of ink on skin. Draco admires some people’s bravery, quietly laughs at the stupidity of others, and rolls his eyes when he sees that somebody got Potter’s signature on their skin. Like an ‘I was here’ carved into wood. Draco wonders though if Potter actually signed
A shiver runs over Draco’s entire body at the feel of Harry’s warm breath against his ear, his body pressing against Draco’s back, trapping Draco between the counter and Harry’s broad chest, their hands almost intertwining as Harry moves them. Draco doesn’t have it in him to protest. Instead, he relaxes against Harry. Draco has been busy with work over the last few years, allowing little room for anything else. Also, he’d never been particularly interested in anyone.
The moment he steps out of the Floo, Draco’s nerves are replaced by smugness. Harry isn’t dressed yet, but cursing — from what his mother told him — like Great-Uncle Alphard during a lot of family gatherings.
Draco’s gaze is drawn to the slippers Harry had toed off and left by the edge of the rug. The lions are dozing now, their eyes shut.
“Who was she?”
The back door, when he tries it, is unlocked. It swings open to reveal a long corridor shrouded in shadow, and Draco blows out his breath in an exasperated sigh when he throws a small twig he’s just picked up over the threshold—and it isn’t instantly blasted to bits.
“What do you mean?” Draco says. He can’t look at Potter: his gaze shifts over to the fireplace, to the flames dancing in the grate. This secret is too big for him to tell anyone—even the person who defeated Voldemort. Precious Potter.
Several ideas on how to slowly torture his best friend are popping into Draco’s head.
“I loved hearing you calling my name,” a deep voice whispered.
Draco can still feel the ghost of another body cuddling him from behind.
Just that day, Draco had seen him through the small window of the scriptorium, his brown habit slightly lifted as he stood inside the big barrel, treading grapes with his feet. It had taken all of Draco’s willpower to focus on copying the given texts and make sure not to accidentally skip lines or miss a word.
He can’t see you like this. No matter how much your inner wolf snarls in disagreement, Draco is too precious, too important. He’d been an outcast before, and he’d be again if you open that door.
Also, Draco discovered — by means of looking long, intently, and frequently at Oliver Wood and Cedric Diggory — that his interests aren’t really part of the “Traditional Pureblood Heir Handbook”, so finding a wife had never been his intention.
After rubbing his temples, Draco unfolded his package. Was it some damned one-piece Muggle suit? Suddenly he realised what he was holding in his hands, and his face turned serious. Harry was the worst person in the universe.
If Draco weren't such a skilled Occlumens, he could’ve sworn that Harry is inside his head. Everything he wishes for is done the next second. Kisses on the right spots, promises about later tonight are whispered into his ear as Harry’s hand wraps around his cock.
, Draco thinks sarcastically.
You’re conscious of the location of every single knife on Malfoy’s body, but the push dagger disguised as a buckle is your blind spot, the single weapon that always slips your mind. Pointy, elegant, and deadly, just like Malfoy.
The entire time, Harry’s face was trained on Draco. He might still go off the stage, and Harry knew he would follow him. No matter what people would think or how much their publicists might hate them. But, of course, his incredibly strong boyfriend only released a few shaky breaths before looking at him and giving him the signal to start.
You hate him because it feels so bloody good. So amazing that your mind wanders without permission into the treacherous, and very dangerous, 'what-if' fields. For just a few seconds, you stay there, let the images unfold, linger there.
Pansy snaps him out of his thoughts. “All right then. How many dates have you been on? Tomorrow’s definitely not your second. And please don’t bore me by asking how I know.”
“Fine.” Harry exhales and runs a hand through his messy hair. “Last night was—”
Potter places a careful hand on Draco’s thigh. “We can go slower, if you want.”
“Yeah.” Draco feels Harry’s eyes on him as he returns his attention to his dough, glancing up only to find Harry making his way over to him. “And what do you think you’re doing? Giving the dough a gentle pet? Dig the heels of your hands into it.”
And then Draco began to sing in his unrivalled baritenor.
Draco has barely hung his coat on its respective hanger when his Floo chimes… and chimes… and chimes. He hastens towards the living room; panic rises within him, and a thousand possible scenarios pop up in his brain, each one more horrible than the previous.
Then, he pulled up the hood and retrieved a golden chocolate Galleon from a pocket. “I’m a Niffler.” His voice sounded way too delighted for Draco’s liking.
“More, Draco, more.” Harry’s moaning, eyes closed in bliss, one hand fisted around his own cock.
Draco thinks about it, but he’s embarrassed himself in front of Harry more than once already, and since dinner tonight will undoubtedly give Draco plenty of chances to add to this tally, he won’t go anywhere near the man until then.
. He counts it out in his head as his eyes travel across the books, before landing on a thick volume of astronomy. Draco rolls his eyes again. The Blacks couldn’t have been  more obvious if they tried.
It’s quite ironic that of the ten women his parents have invited, three are in a relationship. With each other. It’s even funnier that his father had been desperate enough to invite Ginny Weasley. She is probably as interested in men as he is in women. She can also lift him up and carry him bridal style over a threshold. Which would have made for interesting wedding photos if they hadn’t both been horribly gay.
“Seems like our thing,” Harry says. Followed by a soft, “I’ll make you feel so good.”
Draco can see the shiver that runs through Harry’s body before he complies. He locks eyes with Draco the entire time he gets down on all fours and presents his arse to Draco. Harry arches his back as he does, then turns his head to watch Draco over his shoulder. It’s not what Draco had in mind, but he has never allowed Harry to turn around whenever they had sex previously. It was Draco’s way of self-preservation, of trying to stop himself from feeling anything for Harry. Now, for the first time, he wants to see Harry’s face when he comes.
“Who says they’re gonna be cute?” the prick had the nerve to ask.
“Good. I’m gonna get this into shape, and then we can put the toppings on it.”
After hauling him to his feet — so far you didn’t have to even use a weapon — you force him to step back and back until he reaches the edge. The advantage of rooftops is that you can easily hide your traces by making it look like a suicide. Notes are so easily forged with the right spells that no copper, no forensic analysis will ever uncover the truth. And it’s not like people like him don’t have figurative bodies buried in various places.
When Draco arrives via Portkey on an early Sunday morning in Scotland, he almost slips in front of Neville’s flower shop. The frosty wind, laced with snowflakes, blows directly in his face.
Draco didn’t answer him; there was probably no way to phrase what was going through his head into a proper sentence. Or maybe there was nothing going through his head. The emptiness that threatened to consume a person, Harry was very familiar with that feeling. It could also be the not-understanding of how something like that could happen, and you had to live on without them in your life. Harry also knew that all too well, having lost so many people over the years. His parents, his godfather and his husband, some of his friends…
“Well,
Draco doesn’t doubt Harry’s abilities for one moment. From what he’s heard from Ginny and even Weasley and Granger, Harry is much more experienced in this area.
“What’s wrong?”
size?” Potter is looking so smug. Draco has to urge to wipe it off his face, and he gives in.
“A bit over an hour. Greenhouses?”
“Don’t you dare mock me, Weasley! I’d be brilliant.”
“I swear I’m gonna rip you into a millions pieces, you fucking—”
Potter’s pacing now, antsy like a caged tiger, all thoughts of seduction gone. Draco watches him, waiting. When the silence stretches on and on and Potter doesn’t offer any new suggestions, Draco finally gives in and says, “What about the secret passage?”
There’s one thing that stings till this day.
be happening, and Draco absolutely believes Potter when he tells him that he’s not sure why it’s not working, puzzlement etched all over his face. They try to Apparate out next, but get slammed back into the room the minute they do, stunned and dizzy.
He and Draco had worked on this song the night it happened. Waiting quietly on a chair while their friends were in surgery hadn’t been for them, so Harry had made use of his celebrity status and gotten them a room in the hospital where they could play some music together. This song just came to them as they’d messed around with Harry’s guitar.
“I swear, Potter, if there’s even a hint of glitter in my living room after you’re gone, you can search for your balls in the depths of the Black Lake.”
“I’m just giving you a dose of your own medicine,” Draco says, a cheeky smile spreading across his face, and when Harry tries to spur him on, he moves up again to capture Harry’s mouth in a quick kiss before saying, “be patient, I’ll make it good for you, I promise.”
“And you seem to do like the dragon wings on yours. I saw you earlier in the hallway.”
The next morning, Draco is woken by Neville faffing about in the flat. A quick glance to the alarm clock on his bedside table tells him it’s six thirty a.m., way too early for Draco to be up.
Draco smiles weakly. “Not much. Mostly fixing Quidditch Players post-game, and trying to get this one” — he gestures to Harry — “housetrained.”
“Oh yes, Draco’s stiff posture and icy glare at his guests scream ‘successful party,’” Millicent remarks.
"And your idea was to try and seduce me here, in the library, dressed in nothing but a bathrobe?”
“Ginny, one to the right,” Draco chuckles.
Draco kisses him hard, needing the connection in the post-orgasmic bliss. A slow and tender kiss that helps him come down from the high.
“I swear I didn’t see anything,” Harry claims after he’s turned around.
Draco’s heart begins to beat faster as they get ever closer to the exit. What if the house decides to lock them in the passageway? He looks ahead, and smiles in relief when he sees the welcoming square of light from the library flooding the passageway, and the still open bookcase.
He lets the glass sway gently in his hand, watching the wine swish around in the inside of the glass like a mini vortex. From the corner of his eye, he spots Potter setting his glass down on the wooden floor with a soft
Draco saw that Harry was opening his mouth to speak, but he beat him to it. “If the words out of your aren’t ‘I’m gonna do the laundry’, I’ll cast the nastiest Stinging Hex on you. The situation I’m in is entirely your fault.”
“Okay...” The word is dragged out. “How about we go down to the greenhouses?”
Draco cuts him off with a kiss. He needs to feel Potter’s lips on his again, just to make sure that it isn’t some mad dream. Potter kisses him back eagerly, and it isn’t long before they lose themselves, exchanging soft kisses.
“No, but it’s funny.” Ginny smiles.
Harry sits at the other end of the table, talking to Finnigan and Longbottom about Salazar knows what. He’s happy — smiling constantly and laughing whenever Finnigan cracks a joke. The cutest thing about him is the slight flush on his cheeks.
“Draco,” Harry sighs, “my bed is big enough for both of us. Come on, now. I have to be up in two hours.”
“Let me see.” She grabs the photo from Draco’s hands. “Sorry to disappoint, Draco, but that’s just a root.”
And then some moments forced you to see that you were just like everyone else — just another human being, as mortal as every person on this planet.
Beside him, Potter’s staring in slack-jawed surprise. “How did you know this was here?”
he thinks until his eyes catch something on the next image.
“It’s a onesie,” Harry said with a wide smile on his face. “I got one for me, too.”
Without a warning, Potter disappears before reappearing a moment later with a wand.
All of them were together in paradise where they belonged. Every single person that had been taken away from them too early. They would be dearly missed, but they would never be forgotten.
Ever since Ginny casually dropped the bomb that is Potter’s sexuality, hours have been spent imagining different scenarios. Many hours, more than Draco is comfortable admitting. It’s not that he
An unexpected remark makes Draco blurt out something.
Two years ago, they’d done it for the first time when Harry visited Draco in rehab after Draco had sent him letters. Harry remembered the black piano in the common room and the hours they spent behind it. Not just singing but confiding in each other.
Pansy knows the truth, and she’s certainly picked up on how nervous he is.
The lions eye Draco suspiciously as if they can read his thoughts, and they give him an open-mouthed, silent snarl, which he answers with a disdainful sniff, before turning back to the bookcase.
“Ouch,” Potter winces after a well-aimed, non-verbal, Stinging Jinx.
“As long as you keep your temper in check, sure,” Draco says, not looking up again.
“Ladies, I mean it,” Daphne warns. “I won’t let you help me with next year’s motto nor let you participate if you continue like this.”
“And you’ll be a Potions Master soon, I gather. At least that was what I got off the notes in that book you’ve left here. Why haven’t you told me before? We always need good suppliers for the Department. When we’re out in the field, potions are some of our lifesavers.” Potter’s voice is casual, like they’re just talking shop.
The surrounding air is buzzing. Draco knows he has to diffuse the situation because they’re standing next to the batch of magical mimosas for St Mungo’s. “Harry, please calm down.”
“Practice game, and the new Beaters are very… unerring. Which is good, but I wasn’t really prepared for that.”
Coming clean about his alcohol-induced memory loss didn’t cause the anticipated break-up. Quite the opposite.
The tension in Potter’s body is obvious, but there’s also something else. If Draco hadn’t known Potter any better, he would have said that Potter was shy, was out of his depth. But that’s so unlike him. The Potter he’s come to know is casual and flirty, has flings with ex-Death Eaters, and lounges around in his bathrobe on a rug.
“I expected you to hex me into next year, or at least to storm in here, maybe setting fire to the quilt.”
“Don’t worry. More anecdotes for me as your best man,” Pansy says with a smile.
Draco tries casting another Patronus.
“Harry, this is Draco. Draco this is Harry, the owner of this lovely place.”
Draco holds up a hand to cut him off. “Stop right there. You’re just saying these things because of the situation we’re in right now. You're stressed, and you're not yourself. You wouldn’t say this under normal circumstances.” Draco’s firm, almost fierce as he says it. He can’t allow his heart to cling to even the smallest spark of hope, or he’ll just be crushed again.
No, Harry is really dressed in jogger bottoms.
“Salazar, Draco, even the Giant Squid has more backbone than you.”
Harry’s entire body is trembling, and Draco can feel how close Harry is, can feel him pushing desperately against him, trying to urge him on. “Please, Draco, please,
Potter, but he’s intrigued by him, even more so now that he knows that something
“I hope I’m not crossing a line, and it’s not that I don’t like the way things are; actually, I do like it a lot—”
“Sure.”
“Aha, got you,” he says triumphantly, and carefully slides his wand through the gap until it touches the lock. When the keyhole glows golden, Draco turns his wand as if unlocking a door, and the rock wall slowly melts away to reveal a black wooden door. He takes his wand out of the lock and jiggles the golden handle, trying to open the door. Nothing happens.
Harry’s green eyes widen in shock, which is when Draco realises that this is the first time that he’s called Potter by his first name. Harry stays there, smiling at him happily.
If Draco wasn’t already head over heels for him, he’d have been now.
“Why hello, Potter. Not even a greeting for a good customer?”
Evidently, the confusion is too much, and it would look too gauche to undo the charms, because Draco hears the live musicians begin the dance music.
Draco checks the time, sees he’s almost late — for his standards — to pick up Harry, and makes his way to the Floo. He pointedly does not think about where they’ll be going tonight because then he’d need another dress shirt. Maybe even another shower.
He can’t help but notice that Potter hasn’t looked away from
“Werewolf or Hippogriff?”
“Potter, that’s disgusting. We’ll start sticking to each other.”
“Not even your father?”
“How didn’t
“I am,” Draco protests.
“Any louder, Weasley? I think Flint’s sister hasn’t heard it yet,” Draco hisses back.
Draco reveals that he went commando under his robes — they’re surprisingly rough — on his first day as a Healer. As everyone has expected, Ginny and Pansy have had sex in a bed while someone else was sleeping next to them, apparently more than once. What shocks both Ginny and Draco though is that their partners are members of the Fly High Club.
“I… I didn’t think of that. I’m really nervous, Draco. I’ve showered three times, but I still feel sweaty and sticky.” Harry slumps down on the edge of his bed.
“Okay,” Ginny and Pansy groan in unison.
who helped me sort through my ideas, and
Draco goes first. He runs to the gents as if he’s on his way to a patient about to die. A man on a mission. It crumbles the moment he’s in there all by himself. The last — and first — time Draco had done this, he’d had more to drink than two glasses of wine, and he’d been in a club, not in a pub with a lot of Harry’s friends outside.
Draco really could’ve lived without the images invading his brain. After quickly glancing at Ginny’s thigh again and seeing there’s only a faint red mark left, he gets up and takes a seat next to her. Pansy has occupied the armchair across from them and poured herself a huge glass of red.
“Draco, did you hear me?”
It’s always easier when it’s others and not you.
By the time you spill over, the fire has burned through you, leaving sparsely glowing embers behind.
“No, I most certainly did not. Anyway, this will be our fifth date, and no Ginny, we haven’t passed that line yet. Potter has been a perfect gentleman.”
“Evidently,” Draco deadpans. “I went to Beauxbatons and I've lived in France for most of my life.”
“Leave, please, and I’ll bring your order tout de suite,” Draco insists, trying to remain as calm as possible for the sake of the sensible shrubs. Harry just turns on his heel and leaves.
As it turns out, he can’t do this. Two hours later, he wraps himself in a blanket and makes his way to Harry’s flat, which is conveniently located above the bakery.
He tries to recall what his mother told him, humming the song under his breath. The Blacks had made it into a rhyme:
Draco bites his tongue to prevent himself from voicing his comment and says something else instead. “It was a patient. They sneezed so hard they flew across the room and into my wand. But I promise I’ll take better care of this one.”
Turning on his heel, Harry walked up the stairs onto the completely dark stage and sat down on the stool, placing his guitar on his lap. His heart was racing in his chest. Despite having been in the limelight since he can remember, every time he went to play in front of a crowd terrified him. Usually, people had paid good money to see him and his friends, and he never wanted to disappoint them.
“You might have, but the crown wouldn’t look even half as pretty.”
He almost slips when his calves touch the barrier. Your hand reaches out to grab his jacket, but instead of pulling him back, you leave him hanging, giving him time to look sideways and see the busy London street far below. The deep drop that’ll await him if he doesn’t cooperate. He will take this exit no matter what, but he won’t realise that until it’s too late.
“Normal people would send an owl.”
With him, you’re constantly tiptoeing on the thin line between safe and fatal.
Potter doesn’t do anything to help; just crosses his arms and stands there silently watching. Draco gives the door an irritated look, before running through the same list of spells that Potter used upstairs, in the exact same order, like a record on repeat. When
Draco gets off the couch to kneel in front of Ginny on the rug. “Spread your legs, darling, I need to take a look at the wound there,” he says, tapping gently on her knee. Very carefully, he pulls the badly applied magical bandage off Ginny’s upper thigh and quickly casts a spell to protect the couch. It’s more blood than he expected. And more tissue damage. “This is gonna take a while.”
A truly unflattering moan escapes Draco’s mouth, and he gets the sinking feeling he’s blushing again.
Draco grins slyly at that. “How exactly will Weasley walk through Muggle London tonight?” he asks while beginning to glamourise the crown.
“Be right back,” Draco whispers against Harry’s lips and makes as if to get up. Then his eyes catch sight of a familiar blue bottle near Harry’s head, reflecting the flames from the fireplace.
Then, “oh,” Harry says as realisation dawns.
“Alright, but first, I wanna eat those strawberries.”
Hermione laughs. “Does he still leave his socks and jumpers lying around?”
“What the actual fuck, Potter.” Draco grabs hold of Potter’s arm and heals the cut, murmuring a spell under his breath. It’s a superficial cut that heals almost instantly, the skin knitting together under the warm glow of the spell.
"Don’t answer that.” Draco’s voice is icy.
“And I suppose that’s just the tip of Potter’s
Now to one person without whom I'd have long given up on even posting this chapter,
“Sorry about that," Draco says after swallowing, "but this is amazing.” Harry chuckles and finally digs in as well. After he’s taken a large bite, Draco seizes the opportunity to ask him something he’s dying to know. “Why a bakery?”
And if this isn’t enough reason to never repeat this ever again, Malfoy forces you to open your mouth, effectively gagging you. Whatever it is, it’s so deep in your mouth that you can’t spit it out, but not so deep to constantly trigger your gag reflex.
When Harry is done yelling, the leaves of the mimosas have shrivelled and turned a dismal shade of brown.
“Kiss me,” Harry says between moans, and Draco does just that. He lets go of Harry’s legs, and leans over to capture his mouth with his own. His rhythm begins to falter; he fucks Harry wildly now, hips snapping against Harry’s, and all it takes is a couple more thrusts. Harry comes first, his cock jerking in wild spurts all over their stomachs, his body clenching tight around Draco, and it’s the feeling of Harry’s body gripping his, warm and wet and tight around his cock, that brings him over the edge.
?” he shakes his head, incredulous, as he rings the bell.
"C'est vrai." Draco stands up and takes a few unsteady steps. The ground is moving slightly, making it hard for him to know where it’d be safe to walk. He reaches the end of the table when Harry grabs his arm.
“So?”
Potter huffs out a laugh before continuing to inflate the dolls. Draco sprinkles blue glitter over a pattern he’d just created with glue.
You can’t hold back anymore. The first kiss is feral. You claim his mouth, and he lets it happen. The second is no less urgent. By the third, he’s gripping your shirt.
Normally, with other novices present, it was easier to fall asleep. It was easier to restrain oneself, knowing the others might be able to hear you as you’re committing a sin. But there was nobody here, and despite Draco’s efforts to keep his head empty and focus on his own breathing, black hair and emerald eyes appeared in his mind as bright as day.
Draco looked at the piece of fabric on his lap. It wasn’t unusual for Harry to buy presents whenever he saw something that someone might like. He supposed it could be something to wear — and the fabric was really soft and fluffy — but it couldn’t be for him. This… whatever this was, was probably intended for Teddy.
The soft thud as his head meets the door tells you he won’t leave.
Draco attempts to lighten the mood. “Is it just me, or are my wands getting smaller every time?”
Draco huffs. “You three can continue this game while I get another refill and try to steal some finger food from the buffet.”
Draco opens his eyes when Potter strokes his face with his thumb. Even in the orange light of the fire, he can see that Potter’s cheeks are equally flushed, his eyes blown wide as he looks at Draco and smiles. Potter’s face radiates clear affection as Draco pulls him in for another kiss. Potter rubs his hand over Draco’s erection, until he can’t help but moan shamelessly into Potter’s mouth, his hips rutting uselessly against Potter’s hand in a desperate attempt to get more friction.
“Well, I’m exhausted from work, and you’re rather squeamish today.” Draco rubs his forehead before diving back in. “How did you manage to look like this after a training session anyway, Ginny?”
Pansy’s words are totally lost on him. Draco stands in the doorway for two seconds, glancing back to the folder on the table before pulling the door shut.
Draco wraps an arm around Potter to hold him in place as he begins to move his hips. Their cocks begin to slide against one another, occasionally brushing against the hem of Draco’s shirt. The fabric provides some lovely friction, but it isn’t enough. Potter’s kisses grow desperate as his hands grip Draco’s hips, moaning into his mouth every time their cocks touch. He runs his hands over every inch of Draco’s body, then slips a hand between them to try and touch their cocks.
“Seems like the house approves.” Potter smile grows wider. “So—uhm what do you—”
“Neither did we.”
“Because you love me,” Pansy answers after pressing a kiss to his cheek. Draco raises an eyebrow. “And because you don’t want to get on my bad side.”
“Is this how you treat people who’ve been keeping you company while your boyfriend is running late?” Pansy asks.
He makes his way up the stairs to the library at a quick pace. Every time a wooden step squeaks under his shoe, he startles, and looks behind himself to check that the coast is clear. The paintings on the wall are all his distant relatives once or twice removed, and they eye him sharply as he goes past, but remain quiet. Draco exhales in relief once he’s past them. He stops on the landing and waits to see if anyone’s given him away; or if Kreacher would appear. Technically, Kreacher should be at Hogwarts, but he could pop back anytime Harry or the house summons him. When nothing happens after a minute and the house remains silent, he makes his way cautiously over to the heavy double doors of the library.
“And that’s all I ever needed to know about sex with Malfoy, thank you very much. I need more beer to drown the images in my head.”
Placing one hand on the golden door handle, he carefully turns it. The door creaks loudly as he pushes it open, the sound resonating throughout the entire house. When Potter doesn’t immediately appear, Draco takes a cautious step forward, then another, until he’s in the front foyer. It’s completely dark by now, but he knows the outline of the house by heart. He’s spent plenty of evenings here; months Flooing in to see Potter in secret.
It’s so cliché. Almost every Muggle action movie has one of those scenes in it.
You hadn’t been ready.
He stands around morosely, putting on his best air of “don’t talk to me”. It seems to be fairly successful because although there are potential brides aplenty in the Manor ballroom, none of them have approached (save Ginny, Pansy, and Millie, but they don’t count anyway).
Harry knew Draco hated himself.
Three steps later, he feels Potter’s fingers brushing against his own in a silent question. Draco pauses, and in that brief moment, Potter seizes the opportunity to interlace his fingers with Draco’s. Draco looks down at their joined hands, then up at Potter. There’s a small smile on Potter’s face, and he only tightens his grip when Draco tries to shake his hand out of Potter’s. They engage in this silent war for a few furious seconds, until Draco gives it up as a lost cause.
“Okay,” Ginny announces, standing up and clapping her hands in the air of someone who really wants to wrap this up, “let’s summarise. After being oblivious idiots for ages, you finally hook up with so much alcohol in your blood that you, Draco, don’t remember. And then you realise it as you’re in bed with Harry for probably the first time. What did I miss?”
“I’m not doing anything to the door, Draco.” Potter reaches past him to jiggle the handle. The door doesn’t budge, and Potter’s eyebrows lift in surprise. “What the—”
doesn’t work, Draco casts a couple of additional spells that Potter certainly doesn’t know about, muttering under his breath as he does so—they’re new Unspeakable spells which Draco is currently in the process of fine-tuning. He’s fully aware that he shouldn’t be casting them in front of an Auror, much less an Auror who is
As the person draws closer to the house, there’s almost no smell. No perfume, no aftershave, and only the slightest hint of shampoo or shower gel. You immediately recognise them. Despite eight years having passed, your body reacts instinctively. The closer they come, the closer you want to be. Not just you; your inner wolf sighs contentedly for the first time.
Draco feels heat crawling up his neck and he’s glad he can blame it on the warmth in the greenhouse.
It was all just a dream. Nobody would ever know about his fantasies. Tomorrow, after committing himself fully to the convent, the devil would have no more power over him. The Lord would be his guide, his light. Nevertheless, he’d devote more time than required to his labours and prayers to compensate for his corrupted thoughts.
Red, fiery anger rises inside your body when you allow him to distract you with a kiss, only to realise that the shackles bolted into the wall are now enclosing your wrists, leaving you to stare at the headboard. It would be possible to open them if you could just reach your wand.
“Go.” Daphne releases the folders, and with Chaser’s speed, Ginny seizes them mid-air.
All of a sudden, Potter emerges from behind the shelves. As he steps towards the counter, Draco has a hard time not to let his jaw drop. He’s had ideas (let’s call it ideas, okay?) about Potter in full work attire since he’s seen the photos, but oh my… he is
“Don’t play dumb, Draco. You’ve got the same look on your face as all the other Potter fans.”
“You mental?” He shakes his head and closes his eyes, trying to get the image of Potter out of his brain. He seriously wishes he could Obliviate himself. Seeing Potter like this, naked and inviting, makes it almost impossible to leave. It takes all of Draco’s willpower not to simply push Potter up against a wall and fuck him senseless. “Give me that bloody book and then I'm out of here. Now!”
“Harry disappeared when you decided to do this.”
Ginny was still alive, surviving the surgery against all odds. But they all had lost someone that night. A friend, best friend, or girlfriend.
Potter tries the fireplace, but although he tosses in a generous handful of Floo powder, the fire doesn’t switch to the Floo network. It remains a normal orange. One of the logs shifts slightly in the grate, and sends sparks and ash flying up the chimney.
That startles a laugh out of Harry. “It wasn’t our combined intellect that came up with them. We got wasted at a party, and we lost a bet against one of our friends’ older brother, George. It’s never a good idea to bet against George, especially not while drunk.”
“Harry—” There’s a pause. You can hear his heart pounding fast inside his chest. “—please open the door.”
“Perfect. Be at the bakery around half seven.”
for your encouragement and help with this chapter.
“Bath-bathrobe.” Harry’s breathless, and has a hard time getting the words out.
There’s one building nearby with the necessary height for this shot and the skill required to execute it rules out everyone you have ever worked with. Everyone except—
,” he adds, when Draco doesn’t move.
“Having fun without me?” Millicent asks as she approaches Draco and Pansy.
Draco runs his hands through his hair. He’s tired, he’s dirty, and above all, he’s exhausted. It’s almost midnight, and it’s all cold — the water in the shower, the flat, the shop. He’s spent the last hours casting warming charms, but the more he casts them, the shorter they last. He knows what he ought to do, but he’s already messed up once today and Harry will undoubtedly owl Neville who, in turn, will arrive back promptly. Draco can’t risk that. He can do this.
Retreating after a long day filled with painstakingly applying stroke after stroke on vellum pages, sleep should come easily. Every muscle in his writing hand was making itself known, and his back hurt while his neck felt stiff. He should be drifting off quickly but wasn’t. Instead, he was lying on his straw mattress, head on the small bolster, covered with a single linen blanket.
“Because it was terrifying. I thought I’d fall off any second.”
Both his parents knew; he’d told them more than once, but while Narcissa seemed to believe him, Lucius’ ambitions for his son have remained unchanged. In an act of desperation, Draco firmly reiterated over his Christmas pudding that he was
Potter’s advancing on him, a strange light in his eyes. “Show me,” he says. “
"Alors, je devrais le faire plus souvent."
“Yes, Potter, the house,” Draco says patiently.
“Banish the thought. Carry on, Potter.” Draco says, and leans over to give Potter a quick kiss of reassurance.
The moment he’s drying his back, the door swings open.
Draco scoffs. Deep down he knows Potter doesn’t mean it that way, but it still really hurts that Potter thinks he needs help to make it in the Wizarding World. “I don’t need your charity, Potter,” he hisses.
However, a Healer without a wand is as useful as a Quidditch player without a broom. So, Draco calls his substitute, changes out of his robe, and ends his shift three hours early. He steps into the fireplace in his office to go directly to the Leaky Cauldron. Ollivander doesn’t have a fireplace in his shop — for obvious reasons — and to Floo directly into a shop without a scheduled appointment is rude. His mother hasn’t raised him like that.
“I think the antlers suit you rather well.”
Sometimes, Draco even thinks that she’s been meddling in the past.
“And you thought tea would rectify the situation? I’m used to better apologies.”
Harry bumped against his shoulder. “When’s the party going to happen?”
Draco reaches over to grab the bottle. He pops open the lid and squeezes a small amount in his hand, astonished to feel that it’s already warm. He shifts down, and Harry spreads his legs obligingly. One hand finds its way to Harry’s arse, and he circles Harry’s hole with one wet finger teasingly. Draco shifts up until Harry’s legs hang over his shoulders, his mouth hovering over Harry’s erect cock, and then he licks a long stripe from base to tip before taking Harry into his mouth. At the same time, he pushes his first finger in, slowly. Harry moans, long and deep, his cock twitching in Draco’s mouth. Draco slides his finger in and out of him, careful and slow, until Harry’s looser, then adds a second finger. Draco’s hot mouth slides up and down Harry’s hard cock while his fingers push in and out, keeping the same rhythm.
When he finally speaks, Potter’s voice is low. “I’ve never been good at these sorts of things. Draco I— Fuck—” He ruffles his hair even more, trying to find the words. “What I’m trying to say is, I like you, okay?”
Potter looks like he’s stepped straight out of Draco’s best dreams. His skin glistens slightly with sweat, his sleeves are rolled up, showing the most delicious forearms, and his shirt collar is open wider than Draco is used to, revealing a tanned patch of skin that he wouldn’t mind licking.
Luna ignores his last remark completely. “Harry made apple tarts. You should get some,” she tells him before leaving.
Draco snaps his hips forward, slamming home, and Harry groans loudly, hooks a leg around Draco’s waist, trying to pull him in deeper. “Like this?” Draco asks, panting, and Harry responds, “Merlin,
It takes a few minutes for Pansy to enter the room. When she lays eyes on him, she simply asks, “When?”
“All right. Then—” she quickly flips through a magazine, making a variety of noises before finding something she likes “—let’s determine your true age.”
Unexpected and messy.
“Oh, we’re making pizza.”
He throws Floo Powder into the flames and calls out Pansy’s address for Potter.
In deliberate movements, he inches nearer to you, his hand almost touching yours.
The thing is, he's been incredibly happy for the past week, and as superstitious as it may sound, he hasn’t wanted to jinx it. Not when he isn’t absolutely sure about Harry feeling the same way. But since Harry apparently told Hermione — and by extension, Ron — about them, maybe Draco hasn’t been reading the signs wrong after all.
“Oh, shut up!”
“Potter, stop,” Draco interrupts, practically running towards him and batting his hands away. “What in Salazar’s name are you doing to your new shirt?” He casts a quick Ironing Spell to get the worst wrinkles out.
Draco sighs; a long, deep sigh. He doesn’t reply. The silence stretches on, and Potter finally says, voice soft, “You’ve asked what it is to me. I care about you. I thought you knew that, I thought you—”
“Oh stop it, Pansy.” Ginny slaps her playfully on her arm. “Not everyone is unable to keep their hands to their own lap. I think it’s nice that they’re taking it slow.”
“All right,” Draco sighs, resigning himself to his fate. “What can I do to get you out of here as quickly as possible?”
“I could put in a good word for you. That might help. No, it’ll definitely help.” Potter smiles, but the smile doesn’t reach his eyes. He’s watching Draco carefully, gauging his responses.
“What?” Draco asks.
He allows himself a deep breath, then shoves his feelings aside to concentrate on the problem at hand. Draco lights up his wand and spots what Potter had missed the first time around: there’s a small gap in the stone, and at the end, a rock shaped like a lock.
He takes the seat opposite Neville and glances around the shop. It’s small, only four tables, but it’s warm and homely. A couple of brightly daubed canvases line the wall, and Draco knows immediately that Luna is the artist. She’s always drawn, even as a child. Draco thinks of old times in Malfoy Manor with her, before his father chose his loyalty for the Dark Lord over his family, and his mother saw no other way to protect him than to go to France, separating Draco from all his friends.
Since he started at Hogwarts four years ago, there’d been no time or people to date. Then Potter came last year after quitting the Aurors, and Draco found himself eyeing his new colleague very closely, discovering in the process that the man was sex on legs.
A gentle knock on the greenhouse door causes Draco to glance up from his kneeling position before returning his attention back to the plants.
The fire is still warm, but it’s not as blazingly hot as before. The flames are smaller, painting the room in a darker shade of orange, shadows flickering on the wall. He scans the room carefully, and realises that more pillows and blankets have appeared—heaped on the sofa in a small mountain.
Once again, I have to thank the incredible
You wanted out. No Healers, no spells, just out!
Draco can’t believe it. Potter has never taken part in this.
Truth be told, Draco would like to try it, and he’s never trusted anyone more than Harry. He presses a kiss to Harry’s chest.
Draco doesn’t get the chance to reply before Potter leans in again to kiss his neck, nipping gently at his skin. Potter’s warm breath on his neck sends tendrils of excitement running through Draco, his skin goosepimpling with anticipation. He can’t resist, and he leans back to rest his head on Potter's shoulder, giving him full access. Potter takes full advantage of it, dragging his tongue in hot little swipes against Draco’s neck. Draco’s white-blond hair sticks in sweaty strands to his forehead, his cheeks are red, and his cock is straining against the zipper of his trousers.
Under normal circumstances, you’d have never let that happen. Blinded by fury, you miss the signs and Malfoy steps aside, leaving you punching air. You jump and dive straight into an ukemi roll when your ears pick up the sound of a knife flipping open. Space matters now.
The smug expression on Pansy’s face has an interesting effect on Ginny. “Wouldn’t you like to know,” she answers.
Draco stands outside the library for a moment, before he turns the handle and pushes the heavy double doors open. What he
Harry almost missed his cue for the chorus. The two of them had never sung publically together. Harry’s voice was much darker than Draco’s, but against all odds, it worked. They melted effortlessly together in perfect harmony. Rich and heavy.
A shiver spreads all over your body. Your exhales are shaky. Since he’d left, you’d missed this the most; him saying your name with softness and affection. Nobody but Draco had ever managed to make your knees go weak and your heart swell by the simple gesture of speaking your name.
“Hi, girls!”
Draco’s reply is distracted as he focuses on keeping one foot moving in front of the other, and not on the warmth of their interlaced hands. “Yes—the, uh, the house. Well, as you know, this house has been occupied by Pureblood Wizards for generations. Countless centuries, maybe. Anyway, it’s been exposed to magic for so long that the house has absorbed a great deal of it, and developed its own sort of magic. I thought you’d have experienced some of it by now. Like the mattress being softer or harder, depending on what you need. Like the house trying to cheer you up after a bad day. It’s like Hogwarts, it knows what you need. But I guess that’s not the case here, is it? You seemed just as shocked as I was when we discovered that we couldn’t get out of here.”
Call it fate, call it bad luck, but  Draco Malfoy has to get a new wand — again.
Harry’s warm palm strokes appeasingly over Draco’s side before his arm slings around Draco’s middle, his hand resting over his heart. Harry resumes to fuck Draco’s thighs, teasingly slow in the beginning and then in earnest.
Instead of having a nice relaxing evening with his boyfriend — it still feels weird to call Harry that, although they’ve been dating for almost seven weeks — Draco stands in front of the mirror. With a quick flick of his wand, his newly acquired dress robes fly out of his wardrobe, and with another few practiced waves, he’s dressed.
“I guess you’ll just have to wait and see. And if you don’t get ready, I won’t be your boyfriend for much longer. Mother, in particular, doesn’t appreciate her son and his date being late.”
For the time being though, Draco leaves him be. He slowly undoes his waistcoat, his fingers lingering on each button before he pops it open. He shrugs it off, letting it fall to the floor, then gets to work on the buttons of his white shirt. He’s in the perfect position to admire Harry’s broad shoulders, his gaze trailing down the smooth line of Harry’s spine until it reaches the curve of his arse. Harry’s Venus dimples are on prominent display, the flickering shadows of the fire darkening the shallow dip of skin.
“You’re one to talk,” Finnigan butts in, “when you—” The rest is swallowed by the pub noise.
And now Draco experiences it first-hand. Hands, lips, and tongue elicit the most unflattering sounds from him. He mentally claps himself on the shoulder for casting a wandless Silencing Charm the minute the door was locked.
He is, however, a good best friend, and Pansy promised him this will be her last piercing.
Draco braces himself on the counter, waiting for the kettle to boil while praying that it’ll never finish its task. He turns his head a bit, checking if Potter is still sitting on his living room floor and this hasn’t just been some delusion.
. Hasn’t the house shown you all of its secrets by now?”
“I think I’m ready.” His voice was trembling a bit; the effort of trying not to break into tears.
And shoutout to
“Sorry, Potter, but it’s my turn.”
Besides, Draco spots a very familiar owl in the distance.
They're supposed to be delivered today, but Draco can't get them to blossom. Only when in full bloom do they reach their full magical potential.
“Sorry mate, I didn’t mean to startle you,” Neville apologises, the hint of an amused smile on his face. Neville lets go of Draco as soon as he can stand upright. “Shall I introduce you?” he asks, nodding in the direction of the baker.
thanks for being my betas for this chapter.
The wide smile on Potter’s face bodes nothing good. “I have a special task, just for you,” he says and puts a green bag next to Draco.
Pansy is over an hour early.
On instinct, the pair nestle closer together, Harry’s warm chest pressing against Draco’s back. Soft lips brush against his neck, sending shivers of pleasure rolling over Draco’s skin. Draco adjusts his position slightly and Harry’s lips graze over another patch of skin.
Draco can see the uncertainty on Harry’s face. “No, I— I just never had it,” he confesses.
Draco’s mind is still in his flat, winding down from a stressful day at work. He takes a sip of his Pinot Noir, granting himself a few moments to catch up.
Suddenly there’s a foot making its way up Draco’s leg. Harry is too far away, and he doubts Dean Thomas would go for either him or his neighbours. Which leaves…
“Loos in ten. You look so fucking hot today,” Harry whispers into his ear and kisses him on his neck, quelling potential objections.
You hate him.
“Depends. If you want me, I stay, and we work on it together. Or—”
“Another?” Harry blurts out, snapping Draco back to the present. “You can just ask me out, Draco. No need to spend all your money on wands.”
People would normally cheer now, shout his name, or applaud, but the silence was deafening.
He opens his mouth but then realises that he doesn’t know what to say. Draco has thought about it more than once, but there’s this voice inside of him. It never shuts up, not really. Sometimes, it’s quieter, sometimes it screams at him, but it’s always in the background. Haunting him.
Never had Harry entrusted anyone most with his intimate thoughts, painful memories, and wishes for the future. With Draco though, it simply poured out of him. The same way the ketchup splattered out of the bottle after you hit it too hard.
Draco thinks.
day. Food hadn’t been high on his priority list either, but he’d been in better shape than Draco.
Underneath all these layers, Draco shouldn’t be able to feel anything. Yet his skin is ignited, and the heat rolls in waves through his entire body.
Despite his patching up Ginny all the time, they had so far managed to keep it hidden from Pansy.
Suddenly, a gentle breeze of magic blows over Draco’s body, leaving them both completely naked and making the hairs on his arm stand on end. For a moment, Harry lies on top of him, pressing their bodies together, skin meeting skin. The moans that threaten to escape Draco’s mouth as Harry begins to roll his hips, sliding their cocks together, are all swallowed by Harry’s kisses.
“About that, why exactly did you call your shop
It starts as a slow, steady movement, but the level of intimacy is scary and the intensity of the situation threatens to overwhelm Draco. He presses his thighs more tightly together and moves as well, shuddering at the feel of Harry’s cock stroking the underside of his balls with every thrust. Then Harry stops abruptly, and for a moment, Draco fears he’s screwed something up. As he turns to look at him, though, Draco is rewarded with yet another passionate kiss.
“Fuck, Potter.” The words come out breathy. Draco’s mouth is dry. He lets out a stream of curses as Potter keeps up the slow pace, keeps him right there on the edge. Then the wet hotness that is Potter’s mouth suddenly disappears.
either, but he can feel himself getting swept away and not just because of the rhythm of the music. He can’t seem to look away from Potter, those magnetic green eyes, the seemingly soft skin of his cheeks, his lips.
moved as well in the rhythm of Draco’s thrusts.
“Or… I’ll fuck you into that rug you’ve been lying on earlier,” Draco replies, smirking.
Heavy footsteps make their way over to him, and with every single one of them, Draco’s heart beats just that little bit faster in his chest. It’s just the nerves after what happened earlier, nothing else.
After ringing the bell again and waiting yet another few minutes, Draco cautiously steps back to see all the windows are still dark. There is, however, a light next door. From where Draco stands, he has an undisturbed view into the back room of the bakery next to Neville’s flower shop.
He’s lost in everything, he’s forgotten all about his own, by now achingly hard, cock. When Harry wraps his hand around it, Draco is ready to burst. His muscular fingers alter between loosely moving up and down and applying just the right amount of pressure. Every time Draco thinks he’s gonna come, Harry readjusts his grip. Torture in the best of ways.
It’s the only way to describe the man before him. The piercing eyes, the long eyelashes, a hint of freckles on his cheekbones, and the wide, inviting smile. He’s even more gorgeous up close. On a very objective level, of course.
His eyes fall on big hands kneading dough, on flexing arm muscles, and broad, moving shoulders. The white apron can’t hide the well-toned chest, and Draco is secretly grateful for it. When the person lifts his arm to wipe a bit of sweat off their forehead with a small cloth, Draco sees the most beautiful face ever. Or at least the profile.
“Alright, let’s cut the bullshit Draco. I’ve had four days to study your book. At first glance, they look a lot like a Potions Master’s notes, I’ll give you that.” He takes another sip before he sets the glass down again on the floor, and slides down the long cushioned bench of the bay window towards Draco’s direction. “But I’ve watched you today. You’ve cast intricate spellwork, unfamiliar charms, and offensive spells. And then there are the coded notes in that little book of yours.”
At exactly 8:53 p.m. — the time when it had happened — the stage was covered in blue, with a spot on Draco. They couldn’t go for her favourite colour since it was red and it would’ve been the worst choice for this kind of event. He took his microphone from the stand and turned to face the audience.
"I came to tell you that Dudley is currently fixing the boiler. He'll be done before Neville is back tonight."
“If you want me to stop, say the word.”
“You care about me? That’s heartwarming, really.” Draco’s bitter. Not about the fact that Potter’s uncovered his secret, but that Potter’s still pretending to be interested in him.
He opens his eyes, his heart pounding hard in his chest. He has no idea where he is, or how he ended up in this bed. On the pillow beside him lies a note. When Draco picks it up, his eyes fall to the name at the bottom of the paper.
“Please. Harry,
“Be patient, Draco.”
“Bloody hell,” Pansy gasps.
Despite being almost fully clothed, you shiver when his body moves away from you. A single flick of his wand and he looks respectable again. He casts a cleaning spell on you, takes your wand from your thigh holster and puts it into your hand.
Draco laughs loudly, his entire body vibrating against Harry’s. “That is the worst plan I’ve ever heard.”
He grins down at Harry’s stunned face and leans forward to lick the scars that crisscross Harry’s chest. He seals each lick with a kiss, and Harry pushes himself up on his elbows to watch him, shuddering under each kiss. Draco moves slowly, and by the time he’s done, Harry’s twitching under his touch and swearing under his breath.
Yes, you’re impulsive, and yes, sometimes your plans aren’t completely thought through, but you leave no traces. Nothing. Nobody.
"I've never known you to turn down actual dick sucking.”
"I like it when you talk French," Harry purrs, standing up as well with a little help from Draco.
“Rip off,” Draco chuckles when handing over the money.
After swallowing the contents of his mouth, Draco inquires, “Why exactly are you so invested in my sex life, Weasley? Isn’t Pansy giving you enough attention?” As soon as the words leaves his bloody mouth, Draco knows they were a mistake.
Draco takes one last opportunity to glance into the mirror before picking up the beer cans and wine he’s found in Neville’s flat and heading downstairs.
They try the windows next—the gorgeous floor to ceiling windows that take up one entire wall of the library, with a cosy window bay piled high with a mishmash of colourful cushions. It is—it
“Of course.”
“Ouch!” Harry exclaims. “You son of a… Why are you draped in a blanket?”
“Who’s in for wine, pizza and a movie?” Pansy asks.
The snort Ginny lets out is so loud, Draco wonders if the entire wizarding community heard it. “I highly doubt that.”
He tries to recall what Potter just said. “You’re dressed like that… while expecting company?” He swallows once, trying to compose himself and clear his face of any emotions. “Your outfit is
“Watch where you’re going,” Draco snarled.
Truth be told, it’s still a mystery to Draco why she’s so excited about the prospect of her ex dating him. If he were in her shoes, he wouldn’t want to hear anything about that. Sure, Potter has since then figured out that he’s gay, but shouldn’t it still be weird? Ginny has been nothing but supportive on the matter.
, which should have ripped the door from its hinges and reduced it to firewood. The door simply emits a faint blue glow when the spell hits, which grows brighter as the spell slowly sinks into the wood before fading away completely. There’s no way this should be happening. There’s no way this
“Oh? I, personally, think this is the perfect outfit for the occasion.” Potter sprawls back even further and tugs on his robe, slowly pulling it aside to expose more skin, until the robe hangs midway off one shoulder.
“I’ll be whatever, as long as we can finally talk.”
It’s a simple flick of a wand, and Draco is standing before you. He carefully shuts the door before sitting down. You close your eyes, trying for deep, calming breaths, but he’s so close now. You smell him, hear his breathing, his heart beating fast despite appearing calm and in control. Your wolf urges you to move, but you resist the craving.
thank you for constantly having my back. <3
“D’accord,” he answers.
“But—"
, he thinks before taking Harry’s hand and moving with him to the couch.
to find is a silent library cloaked in darkness. What he gets instead is a fire crackling merrily away in the grate, the library lit only by firelight, and Potter lounging on the fur rug in front of the fireplace, clad only in a terry-cloth bathrobe, a glass of wine in one hand.
“Merlin, Harry, how can you be in love with this prick?” Ron quips.
Pansy’s smirk is enough to not ask any more questions. He sips his wine and waits patiently for the girls to finish. He’s learned his lesson after doing this for four years now, and his butt still hurts when he thinks of Ginny’s hex from last year.
You hear the loud, shaky exhale.
leaning in, gravitating closer and closer to each other, until a noise from outside snaps Draco out of his trance. He pulls back, staring wide-eyed at Harry for a second before rushing to the bathroom.
Dreams were safe. Only when he was sleeping could Draco allow himself to explore his dark desires. Technically, he should never be thinking those tainted thoughts, but that was between him and the Lord. He’d be Draco’s final judge.
“Seems like Daphne was very dedicated to finishing them earlier this year.” Pansy smirks before taking a seat.
“You’re so… perfect… love the way you take all of me.” Draco pants, and he knows he’s going to get rug burns from the way his knees keep shifting on the rug. He can feel his own orgasm begin to build.
When Potter opens his mouth to try and protest, Draco just snaps out: “DON’T."
Harry felt Draco’s hand on top of his own.
is Draco’s first thought, which of course, he doesn’t say out loud. There’s no point. They’re done. The end for them had come four days ago.
Rationally, you know you should put up a fight and not let him guide you to the bed like a well-trained dog. You could tell yourself it’s because of the tip of the dagger he’s by now pointing at your neck. You could go even further and pretend it’s all to get him to accidentally drop information on the case you’re working on, but you’ve played this game countless times before. Neither of you is ever willing to give anything away because one of you has blown the other’s mind… among other things.
“Tell me Draco, do you want me to stop?” Potter whispers, before biting down on the left side of Draco’s neck.
The only thing that’s still somewhat a mystery to Draco is what they’re doing right now. Because this doesn’t really feel like a simple apology meal shared with… a friend? Are they even friends?
Draco rests the palm of his hand on Harry’s cheek, stroking Harry’s skin tenderly as he looks at him. Harry’s face is open, happy, and Draco takes a deep breath. He has never expected to say these words to anybody and mean it, and yet here he is, steeling himself to bare his heart. He loves Harry; has loved him for a long time now.
“Oh, yeah, sorry.” There’s a faint blush on Potter’s cheeks as he re-ties his bathrobe firmly around himself. Then he marches over to snatch his wand off a side table and points it at the door.
“Now, we wait. I might try to read, though the light is terrible.” Draco takes another sip of wine. He has to remind himself to keep it casual, to keep Potter at arm’s length.
Harry wished it was true what they’d written in these lines.
“May I?”
You know they hit the nail on the head. Of all the people to show up, you never thought Draco Malfoy would come all the way from Australia to see you here. There’d been no future for him in England; not with him at the wand’s end of so much hate. Too many attacks, people spitting insults in his face. You wanted to hate him when the letter arrived, telling him that he could start his Healer studies in Brisbane. You couldn’t. Not when he’d pleaded for you to come with him.
It’s not like he isn’t aware of what you want, but you spell it out for him just in case. “Where is he?”
"Let's get you more comfortable, darling. It's far too hot in here to be dressed from head to toe in multiple layers."
dating.
He feels like an intruder, and technically he is one. Potter hasn’t invited him over, and from the looks of things, Potter isn’t home. He usually spends Friday evenings at Granger and Weasley’s place. This makes it easy for him to grab what he’d accidentally left behind in the library the last time he was here and leave quietly. It’s a simple, clear plan, and the hardest obstacle—getting into the house—is already behind him.
Potter carries on, almost talking to himself as he tries to puzzle out the mystery before him. “I can’t decipher the notes, but we have similar, albeit simpler ways of encoding messages. We’ve been trained to detect them, and are instructed to at least attempt to decipher them on our own. The ones you used are almost impossible to crack, and usually, we would’ve given these notes to another department.” He lifts his gaze to focus on Draco as he says slowly, “...to the Department of Mysteries. That’s your department, isn’t it? You’re an Unspeakable. I’m almost sure of it. ”
“Still no, Potter. But feel free to run around in yours. I promise I won’t make too much fun of you,” Draco offered with a smirk on his lips.
need to see. Like Neville Longbottom in his not so proper teaching outfit.
Millicent makes an attempt at pointing her wand at her throat as if to cast a Sonorus, but Pansy stops her mid-motion. “I think we’ve teased him enough. What do you think of Ernie’s sister, Draco? I think you’d have lovely children.”
“Morning, sunshine.”
Draco glowers at her. “I can leave if you prefer that.”
“Yours?” Draco holds them up with two fingers.
towards the door.
, for the last-minute beta job. Thanks to
As always, a huge thank you to the last minute beta reader,
Draco blinks a few times in confusion.
And Draco selected these moments for the second verse — their own pain remembered in the lines.
“Harry, we should… oh fuck…” Draco pants. “Harry, maybe...”
And maybe he did spread his arms wide as he ran down the stairs. Nobody would ever know.
“We want to see them, too.” Pansy tries to get a hold of some pictures, but Ginny fights her off.
It’s her fault. Hers and her bloody wife’s. Never again will he go out to a 'fun pub night' only to discover that half of their year is present. Potter being among them, of course.
That’s why Draco is here. It would be impossible for Luna to handle the shop and the plants while Neville stays with his grandmother, Augusta, for a few days, helping her to get back on her feet.
You hate him when the first finger finally pushes into you, more so when, after another finger, his tongue gets involved. Until then, you kept quiet, but once there’s a crack in the dam, the noises spill out of you.
“Can I come in?” Harry asks calmly, interfering with Draco’s thoughts.
On Harry’s suggestion, they relocate upstairs to his flat, rendering Draco seated across from Harry in the dimmed light of his cosy kitchen. Add to that Harry’s soft expression, and Draco is suddenly unsure of what this is. He holds Harry’s gaze this time, feeling challenged by the man, and it’s not like he can start eating when his host hasn’t. He might not have acted like a Malfoy the entire evening, or the entire last two days if he’s honest, but he hasn’t forgotten everything he’s been taught.
Draco enters the Parkinson-Weasley house late Thursday evening, unexpected by the owners and uncaring what he might be interrupting. He pours himself a glass of their strongest vodka before sitting down in his favourite armchair.
for brainstorming with me and finding a title.
“Stay.” To you, it’s a shout, but in reality, it’s barely a whisper.
It takes all of Draco’s willpower to force himself to look away. He bites down on the insides of his cheek, and the sharp pain reminds him why he’s here.
All of that had been over a year ago. He’d come to terms with his new life, grateful for having received a second chance after being nothing but a walking disappointment to his father.
Returning with a stack of boxes, Potter opens the first one and hands the wand to Draco. He puts it down immediately. It feels like the first bit of food touching your tongue and you just want to spit it out. Instant repulsion.
In the flames, he sees a way-too-giddy-and-eager Ginny, and he releases an audible exhale. Relief and annoyance.
They had always been compared. Both of them came from wealthy families: their fathers were rich entrepreneurs. Draco’s mother was a famous model that had small acting gigs from time to time while his own mother had been an actress who sometimes did commercials. And then the only sons of these prominent families chose music.
Sadly, seeing Harry again is unavoidable, but maybe he’s been able to fix the boiler, allowing Draco to at least go back to Neville’s flat. He just needs to get this over with, and it’s not like it can get any worse. Dry and dressed, Draco exits the bathroom and crosses the room, taking a seat across from Harry at the dining table.
“I don’t give a fuck. I need those blossoms.”
“Lemme think…” Harry tilts his head, biting his lower lip as he thinks back to yesterday’s conversation. “It went something along the lines of, ‘It’s really quite simple Harry, the both of you have got to sit down and have it out. If you feel something for him, you can’t let him leave without being honest about your feelings for once.’” There’s a slight pause.
After pushing his guitar on his back, Harry stepped in front of Draco to embrace him and kiss him on the forehead. Telling him it would be okay not to go out there or to stop in between. Nobody would blame him, and Harry would be there for him no matter what. All of that without saying the actual words.
With the sleeve of his jumper, he wipes sweat from his forehead and casts another Patronus. The silvery stream barely hits the plants before it's gone.
he adds mentally, and then that old bitter feeling is there again, simmering just underneath the surface. He has never been good enough for Potter, and moments like this only serve to highlight this inconvenient truth, over and over again.
“So,” Harry said after clearing his throat, which brings Draco back to reality, “do you wanna try with the second dough, Draco?”
Potter wraps both hands around the handle and pulls back with all his might, straining. He might as well have been tugging on Excalibur embedded in solid stone for all that does. He jiggles the handle again, his face creased in a frown, and kicks the door hard in frustration. The door shudders against the force of the blow, but remains stubbornly closed. Potter curses, rubbing his foot, and turns.
He slides a third finger. Harry groans at that, his body trembling with need. Draco holds still, waiting until he feels like Harry’s adjusted, then slowly resumes pumping his fingers in and out of Harry, lets him get used to the burn and slide until he’s whimpering for more.
“Only ten minutes,” Harry protests.
After running a hand over his face, Draco finally reads the note.
“My, my,” says Ginny, letting out a low whistle. “They definitely got one thing right.”
Harry as always acted first and then thought later. Maybe this time he’s been a bit too hasty to agree.
“The book please, Potter. Give me my book and then I’ll get out of your hair.” Draco stretches out his right hand in Potter’s direction. His forehead is damp with sweat, and he’s not sure if it’s because of the fire, or because of Potter. It feels like the room is getting hotter by the minute, and Draco reaches up with his other hand to adjust his robes. Then he catches sight of the look on Potter’s face, thinks better of it, and lets his hand drop down.
Draco is pulled out of his reminiscent thoughts by the soft clink of china on the wooden table. To be honest, Draco prefers tea or coffee over hot chocolate, but this smells heavenly.
Draco isn’t sure if he’s ready to have the world’s attention again.
“Up,” Potter commands, his voice husky, and Draco does as he’s told. Potter slowly pulls Draco’s trousers and underwear down until they’re pooled around his ankles, until he’s wearing nothing but his buttoned-up shirt and waistcoat.
Draco takes a deep breath. He thinks back to all the things that have made him happy. Like his mother chasing him around the gardens at Rosier Villa, or the day he passed his exams and officially became a Healer.
“Shit, must’ve slipped out of the bag. Put it in my mouth.”
“Sure,” Draco replied, patting on the spot next to him on the couch.
“Malfoy?” Potter’s voice pulls him back, and Draco’s eyes meet green ones.
“What did Harry say?” Ginny adds.
He has a hard time trying not to roll his eyes.
“Point.” He lets out a sigh. “But why can’t your wife be here?”
Draco blinks a couple of times to make sure his eyes aren’t deceiving him.
The nausea might actually be a symptom of his hangover and not Harry-related at all. After managing to stand upright, Draco slowly walks to the bathroom and checks it for potions, but all he can find are empty phials.
He steps into the fireplace, and Draco is almost sad to see him leave.
He’s unceremoniously dumped onto the couch — Ginny is too strong for his liking — and has a glass of wine in his hand within seconds. Courtesy of Pansy.
“Here.” Harry is suddenly behind Draco, his hands on top of Draco’s. “See, you have to knead harder, otherwise…”
“I’m definitely not gonna complain.”
“Only to Potters,” Draco smiled.
After you nod, Draco’s hand rests atop your own. A few moments later, your fingers trail up his coat sleeve, coming to a stop where shoulder and neck meet. Your mouth is dry, unable to ask for it, but Draco gets the hint, leaning into the touch as your hand presses against his cheek.
He has an even harder time responding with a breathy, “Oui.”
“Can someone just tell me?”
Another kiss, and then he was gone.
When they break apart once more, Draco’s hot all over, and his cheeks are flushed. Potter must see it, because he smiles at Draco before leaning in again, gently licking Draco’s bottom lip. When Draco parts his lips, Potter, to his surprise, slides his tongue in slowly. Draco follows Potter’s lead, and takes his time to explore Potter’s mouth. He tastes traces of the wine they’ve both been drinking, and hints of mint. But he doesn’t have time to focus on that, because Potter breaks off and swings one leg over Draco to straddle him.
“Go away,” you roar before they can knock.
“Honestly, it wasn’t my dream growing up; I always wanted to be an Auror.” Draco huffs out a laugh. “It’s true,” Harry continues with an amused smile on his face. “I tried to be one, but I simply couldn’t. Not after all that had happened. Cooking is still difficult for me sometimes — long story short, the people I grew up with were abusive arseholes and forced me to cook for them before I even could read — but baking is different. I love seeing happy smiles on people's faces when they come into the bakery. And I also love the involuntary moans people let out as they taste my treats.” Harry smirks at him, and Draco tries his best to stay cool, knowing he’s failed when he feels the heat rushing to his cheeks once more. That’s when Harry begins to laugh — a loud, belly laugh that fills the room.
In lieu of replying, Draco opens the door for her and ushers her in. He just wants to get this over with. It’s not like she really needs him anyway — he’s not even in the same room when they stick a needle into whatever part of her body needs to be accentuated this time — but it’s more his physical presence that calms her down.
Draco’s eyes drop to the floor, hoping Potter will take this as a sign to leave, but there’s a pair of lace knickers on the dark wood.
"You have to admit that in the beginning, it seemed to work. Until I…”
“And awful gits.”
You remove the second shackle. Your hands rub over the reddened skin. The ghost of the metal restraining you will remain for a time, like his smell, but not as long as the burn you'll feel tomorrow and possibly the day after.
He takes a deep breath before speaking. “What in Circe’s name are these plastic monstrosities?”
Potter shoots him an inquisitive look, but does as he told. Draco waves his wand in a complicated flourish, then casts a
The memory of it is distant, foggy. His finger traces the lines absentmindedly, the simple outline. He can still feel the ghost of the raised lines on olive skin, the dark, unruly hair slipping through his fingers. Can almost taste the beer and whiskey on his tongue. Draco remembers how the loud music faded into nothingness, replaced by the sound of their combined moans. The way they moved together. How
“Hey.” Harry put his hand on Draco’s shoulder. He felt thinner, even bonier than usual. Harry knew Draco had barely eaten anything since
Blinking a few times to make sure that Harry has really sent him this and it’s not a horny mirage, Draco can feel heat rushing to his cheeks. Harry has never sent him a picture. And what a sight it is. Harry straight out of the shower, his hair still damp and his towel hanging low on his hips. Draco should play hard to reach more often if this is what he gets in return.
“It’s like Hansel and Gretel with dirty clothes. At least he makes up for it with his looks.”
Along with finding a wife and producing heirs.
“But honestly, why didn’t you tell me?”
“I better take that off you. How about we go back to find something
He gazes mournfully at the buffet. He’d been looking forward to demolishing the salmon en croute.
Then Potter adjusts his clothing, looking coyly up at Draco through his eyelashes, and Draco blinks twice when he catches sight of—“Merlin’s saggy tits, Potter! This is obscene.”
Every note clear yet so rich in colour. For years, Harry had hated exactly that because he could never win this battle.
“No, but I—” Draco looks down to where one of his hands is still holding a mimosa leaf “—Je suis occupé.”
“Because it’s such an easy conversation to have, huh?” Draco snaps back. “You’d think I’d remember shagging the Saviour in a Muggle club, and not to realise it when he’s gloriously naked, his arse high in the air, when I’m about to do naughty things to him.”
for her beta work. You deserve a big bouquet of flowers, chick.
Harry raises a quizzical eyebrow at him. “Okay, stay here. I’ll be back in a sec.”
“Dressing, for fuck’s sake. It’s impossible to get these tiny fuckers through the holes. I can’t believe you convinced me to buy it. It has more buttons than Snape’s sleeves.” Harry moves his hands to his shirt again, but Draco is quicker, using a wordless spell to close them.
Draco never ever thought he’d be this grateful for having a proper shower. For a couple of minutes, he just stands under the spray, enjoying the warmth, before soaping himself up and rinsing off all the dirt and tension from what has been an excruciatingly long day.
Safe and vulnerable at the same time. There’s a tenderness behind every kiss and caress that leaves him craving more.
“That explains so much.”
That night was perfect in every way possible. It was a high like he’s never experienced before. Sometimes, when he’s all alone, he catches himself wishing the person were… Draco shakes his head lightly as he gets up from his seat. It’s impossible and he knows it.
were the one that kicked me out last time.
You’re fucked.
“Just fuck off!”
“Calm down, Malfoy. You were rushing through here like a wild centaur.”
Draco’s eyes go wide at that.
“Please, I don’t know anything.” His face is unreadable in the twilight, but his voice is quivering.
“And imagine what arseholes they’d be,” Ginny offers.
When Potter browses the shelves for possible new wands, Draco wonders when they’d turned from friends to something that resembles flirting. They haven’t seen each other for a few weeks. He supposes that they bonded over crafting ridiculous items for Weasley’s stag night, but even then it hadn’t been like this.
“Your ex.”
Anger, so much anger, and pain. And the constantly present overwhelming grief.
Draco takes a sip from his beer, hoping Harry will take the hint. Naturally, he doesn’t, forcing Draco to eventually break etiquette. He picks up a slice of pizza and takes a small bite.
“Bugger off! I don’t want you here.”
Draco had thought Potter would show up, the two of them would put on a show of being lovers, and then they’d return to Hogwarts and carry on with their separate lives. The pounding thump of his heart as he gazes at Potter tells him that that’s a stupid idea. Instinctively, his hands clutch harder on Potter.
Suddenly, Ginny pops her head through the door, a red spot of what’s most likely tomato sauce on her chin. “If anything happens to Mum’s quilt, I will make you answer for it.” Her eyes move to Draco. “Want some spaghetti with your vodka? I cooked.”
“Wow. I’ve never seen so much of you, Pansy. When did the Wizengamot robes become so translucent? And what exactly is Ginny doing with the tip of her broom?”
“Enjoying the view?” a deep voice says from behind Draco.
“You liar,” Ginny gasps, looking at her wife. “You told me that you’d rather shag Pince before doing it on a broom.”
When the need for air becomes too strong, you break apart. “What now?” you ask.
“Now you’re lying, darling.” Pansy moves over to Ginny, perching herself upon the armrest of the chair and looking over her wife’s shoulder. “Because we look stunning. I mean, look at this.” She picks up a picture and holds it out to Draco.
The whistle of the kettle signals the end of his refuge in the kitchen. He pours the mugs and carries them to the living room. He halts abruptly in the door frame where he can finally see what his guest, or rather the invader of his sacred halls and thief of his precious time, does.
, for helping me select the perfect wand for Draco. I know it's not discussed in detail in the fic, but it was important to me.
“You’ve spent those well. This jumper is…”
“You're so beautiful,” he murmurs, more to himself, but Potter hears him nonetheless and smiles. He steps closer, placing one hand on the small of Potter’s back as he pulls their bodies together. He can feel Potter’s hard erection brushing occasionally against his own. His other hand moves to Potter’s lips, his thumb brushing over them before he slides his hand to the nape of Potter’s neck. He leans in to kiss Potter. Potter parts his lips, and Draco mirrors him, welcoming Potter’s tongue inside his mouth with a quiet, pleased moan.
“The secret passageway. You know, the one that connects the library to the mud room in the back of the house.”
The loud beeping of an alarm clock rudely pulls Draco from his dreams. It feels like a hoard of Thestrals have trampled over him; his head is throbbing, and muscles ache that he didn’t even know existed.
Before he can do anything else, Potter plucks the book from Draco’s hand, and sets both book and clasps down on a side table, and immediately returns to his ministrations of Draco’s neck—kissing, nibbling, licking. He feels Potter’s hands grabbing hold of the collar of his jacket, his nails scraping lightly over the skin, and loses himself in the combination of Potter’s hands and mouth on his neck.
“They’re ready; they’re ready!” she exclaims.
After Flooing to Hogwarts post-Malfoy family Christmas dinner, Draco needed some fresh air. On his way outside, he’d literally bumped into Potter as he was checking the corridors.
Draco is half asleep, but something in Harry’s tone catches his attention. He hums back.
under the apron.
It doesn’t take long for the expected man to arrive. Or for him to drag Draco into the nearest stall pushing him against the door. His hands untuck Draco’s shirt while his mouth kisses whatever it can reach. Mostly Draco’s neck.
“Am I a joke to you?” Draco says icily, snapping out each word. His heart is hammering in his chest, beating painfully hard against his ribs, but his voice comes out steady and cold. “You’ll make sure I’ll never want to leave? Potter,
He tugs the book out of its resting place. There’s a slight resistance before it slides free halfway. When he’s sure that it’s come as far as it can go, he releases it, and the book slides silently back into the bookcase. There’s a soft click as the old gears start up, the machinery slowly kicking into action after years of disuse. Draco steps back expectantly as the bookcase before him sinks back into the wall, and slides behind the others to reveal a gaping hole blanketed in darkness.
Usually, he’s not loud, but with Harry it’s always different. More intense. Harry knows him. And oh God does he know him.
“Sorry,” Harry says, blinking, confused. “Here.” He returns the wand and tries to step away, but Draco holds his grip.
Draco frowns at him. The words haven’t sunken in yet when Potter continues. “I mean, I really like you. I think, I’m in lo—”
In a swift motion, Harry removed his long coat and revealed another of these abominable pieces of clothing.
“Here, get yourself settled, love-ly.” Draco can feel himself blushing at the accidental slip of the tongue. He turns away to grab a couple of pillows off the sofa and hands them to Harry; helps Harry arrange them underneath him before he reaches for the bottle of lube with his free hand. Wiping his hand clean, he opens the bottle again, generously coating his cock with the transparent liquid before he settles himself between Harry’s legs. He guides his cock to Harry’s hole, already dripping wet, and pushes in slowly as he leans forward to kiss Harry. It’s a slow, long kiss, and Harry’s moaning into his mouth as Draco spreads him open; fills him up.
“But… here?”
If Lucius could see him like this, he’d be ashamed. This, after all, is not how the heir of the Malfoy family should behave. Draco has been raised to be in charge of every situation, to hide his emotions behind a mask of indifference, but around Harry, Draco simply forgets to put it up.
The music swells, and Potter’s steps quicken. Draco keeps up effortlessly, and his hands slide up Potter’s arms.
Draco shifts his attention back to the mimosas. He's so engrossed in his task, he doesn't notice somebody entering.
Draco nurses his third flute of champagne, wishing for the strong Pálinka Charlie had brought the last time he’d visited Potter at Hogwarts. He doesn’t realise how tight his grip on the glass is until Pansy appears on his right side, casually inquiring if he’s trying to get out of this by breaking the flute and cutting his hand on the broken glass.
Holding himself together.
“I’ve just finished polishing this one. It’s totally different from your previous ones, but there's no harm in trying.”
“Okay okay,” Draco chuckles, raising his hands in defeat, “you win. Now take your hands off poor Ginny here, you horrible woman.”
Moving off Harry’s chest, Draco props his head on his arm, looking at his boyfriend.
Talking about the past — his father, his mother, the war — is hard. Narcissa took Draco’s place when his father had failed to bring the Prophecy to the Dark Lord. To this day, only a few people know of how she had sacrificed her health and herself for her son.
Draco was belting his heart out.
“The rug,
Failure.
Potter blinks at the sudden change in the mood, his mouth opening and closing soundlessly like a guppy. Behind his glasses, his eyes are wide with surprise. Something like realisation passes swiftly across Potter’s face, there and then gone again. Draco doesn’t want to see it. If there’s one thing he needs right now, it’s to get the hell away from Potter, and away from those empty words that he throws around thoughtlessly. He turns away and tries the handle, except that the door won’t open. Draco breathes out calmly and tries it again. The door remains firmly closed.
gay and
“It’s taking you rather long today.”
“I don’t want to talk, I want to get out of here. Open the door.
The song was barely finished before Harry ran across the stage to Draco. He pulled him into his arms, shielding him from prying eyes and nosy cameras. The news sites and tabloids across the globe would run a story on them tomorrow, but he couldn’t care less about their opinion of his relationship with Draco.
“You’re… puéril.”
Draco quickly checks the pillow, but there's no message. He can’t smell bacon or waffles either. He didn't expect Harry to make him breakfast again, but for some reason, being left without anything turns Draco's stomach.
Draco’s heart is beating so hard, he’s scared it’ll leap out of his chest. Strands of hair are sticking to his forehead, and there’s still a chance Potter will bail on him. There’s honestly no reason why he wouldn’t. Potter agreed to help him weeks ago and has never spoken of it since then.
Upon opening the door to the bakery, Draco can see that Harry is still dressed in a stained apron, cleaning up. It makes sense, otherwise he’d been upstairs, but Draco’s brain doesn’t make the connection until now. Nobody should be allowed to look good in dirty clothes, but somehow, Harry manages.
“A Snitch on your arse? Draco, I think you can find something better.”
With a dedicated exhale, Draco blew out the candle, draping the entire dormitory in darkness. He could not even see his hand if he’d held it in front of his face. Flopping onto his back, Draco briefly looked in the direction of the ceiling, but since he couldn’t see anything, he decided he might as well close his eyes.
Well, no one says he has to
?” Harry inquires, one eyebrow raised.
Taken off guard, Draco jumps on the spot, slips, but is saved by a pair of brawny arms.
There's a brief pause. Mercifully, Potter keeps his mouth shut, and even has the decency to look slightly ashamed.
His heart beats fast inside his chest when Draco opens the door and the sound of the doorbell echoes loudly through the shop. The very empty shop.
Draco puts the bowl down on the coffee table. He looks over to Pansy, and she reads what’s on his mind as if she’s cast Legilimens. They always had this talent to communicate without words.
“Fine,” Draco sighs. “There have been heavy make-out sessions all over our flats, and he certainly wanted to, you know… help me find release, but he was not at all rude when I said I wasn’t ready yet.”
“Potter.” Draco raises his eyebrows, gesturing at Potter’s bathrobe.
“Not again,” Pansy sighs. “She always tries to outdrink Dean.” Two more shot glasses hit the table. “But if she ends up with alcohol poisoning, she’s your problem,” Pansy adds with a smile.
“You’re such a prude.”
As soon as a cup is set next to him, Draco knows his plan to avoid Harry has failed.
Draco’s heart beats hard against his chest, but he remains silent. He draws up his knees, determined not to give Potter a chance to get closer.
Potter’s eyes glitter as he leans forward challengingly, his green eyes still fixed on Draco’s face. He tracks Draco’s every movement even as he leans down to pick up his glass again, sipping at the wine. Draco can feel his pulse quickening when, unthinkingly, Potter licks his lips, still staring at Draco as his tongue collects a stray drop of wine from the corner of his mouth. It’s the same mouth that had driven him mad earlier, and the faint mark of Potter’s handiwork is still evident on his neck.
when she’d given her life to save his. He’d promised he’d do it, celebrate her in the only way they knew how.
“I know you don’t.” Potter moves closer. “Because you’re not really a Potions Master, are you?”
“I’m never gonna wear this, not because you have a bad sense of humour, but because this doesn’t count as clothes. Or anything really.”
said to me before I threw you out that day? You don’t get to blame me, or put this entirely on me. You think your words didn’t hurt me? I’m not a cold hearted arse like you. Fuck. That’s not what I—why is this so hard?” Potter scrubs a frustrated hand through his hair, sighing. He closes his eyes briefly, trying to gather his thoughts.
“Luna gave them to me when she visited yesterday. And,” Harry hesitates, but forges on when Draco gives him an encouraging look, “she basically told me to not let you leave so easily again.”
Sandwiched between Hermione and Pansy, Draco carefully takes a sip from his Sauvignon Blanc. Carefully, because the table at the pub is far too crowded, but since they’re in Muggle London, they didn’t use Extension Charms.
were the one who said that this was just a fling.”
“No, you just didn’t expect me to come,” they state.
inappropriate. Has no one ever taught you manners, Potter?”
“Merde.”
Draco reaches for his hand after only two steps.
“Ha, I knew it. It’s pine, nine and a half inches, with a Phoenix feather core. Quite flexible.”
Dean spluttered and spit out his burger just as Cas started snickering loudly. Sam glanced up at his brother and threw him a winning smile.
‘Robards wants those done by tomorrow evening at the most. Direct your fury at him,’ he said and bent over his desk.
--------
‘It was five thousand men,’ corrected a few.
Their age now is 24.
Weasley and his sister came up to them next, eyes shimmering. They held up Fred's chocolate frog card that read "one half of the only two who managed to set off fireworks in the Great Hall and literally got away with it." That had been Draco's personal addition. He would never forget Umbridge's horror at that.
‘’Mione, I think Harry’s acting strange again.’
They conjured wings, tails, ears and antlers and played tag wearing them. Teddy clapped and yelled in glee, Sirius scampered along with them, darting in between their legs, having the time of his life. By half past eleven, they were a panting heap of bodies. Draco hauled Potter away later, just before the clock stuck midnight. He pushed him against their bedroom wall, wrapped his arms around his waist and leaned in.
'Besides, you might have picnics in the future without 'Mione and me and we might have them without you or Harry and Draco. Whether we realise it or not, we're adults now. Life is going to be different,' Ron said.
'Sure you weren't. I suppose all the non kissing, non cuddling and non touching was all just my imagination.'
'Oh, Dray, is someone scared?' Another round of laughter. 'Oh,' Smith continued dramatically, gasping, 'It's because you haven't done it before, isn't it? No worries, they are all professionals who..'
They sat next to each other on a boulder, Draco making them face a certain point in the sky.
‘So called Peace,’ lamented Blaise.
'Shut up and watch, Potter.'
Draco stared at Harry for a minute. ‘They at least have a good chief,’ he eventually said, going back to his report.
Late that night, white curtains billowed onto them as they lay on Draco's bed, basking in the quiet coolness of the full moon, visible from the window above the bed. Draco reached out to take Harry's hand in his.
Narcissa only laughed louder.
----------
'Oi,' Harry poked Ron in the shoulder with his free hand. 'It's all on you and 'Mione and Millie and Goyle. Teddy would want cousins sooner rather than later.'
Harry laughed and plucked Teddy out of his hands. It was probably the familiarity but the toddler calmed down a bit. Harry paced up and down the room, one hand continuously patting Teddy's back.
He was more surprised that they were there since he made sure to return at ten to eleven, fifty minutes past the time Draco had said they'd be leaving for the pub.
'Yes,' Draco chuckled, 'so you see, there was no reason for you to go green with envy.'
Because Draco couldn’t imagine going up to her and saying, ‘Professor, I think someone there is out to get me.’ She’d give him additional homework in response so that he wouldn’t get out there in the first place.
. They turned to their friends in horror.
'Ain't that a sight to behold!' Hermione exclaimed, a clicking sound issuing from her camera. Harry chuckled. 'Oh Merlin, yes!'
A right, a left and another left later, they reached the door and burst in immediately. Hermione was sitting at a small table before a ten year old, both of them in a deep conversation. The little girl was the first to notice Ron and Harry as she tilted her head up and scrunched her face in confusion. Hermione looked up at that, relief crossing her features as she took in her two best friends.
‘Okay, maybe I didn’t. But if that is the account of an eyewitness, what choices do we have? She must have been drunk, delirious, dreaming or demented. And I don’t think she would have dreamt of her niece going missing, though her supposed theories could very well be a result of her dreams that, according to you, have proved to be as eccentric as the lady herself.’
He decided to give Draco a taste of his own medicine and began speaking only when addressed. He studied with Hermione (who raised an eyebrow and shook her head), flew with Ron and Ginny and went Nargle hunting with Luna. Everyone knew he was being quiet and mechanical. No one pressed.
NOTE- 1. The ages indicate the age at the time of first appearance in the story.
Harry groaned and took to the stairs.
'This feels so surreal, this hilltop, the stars, everyone sleeping happily around the bonfire. It's the first thing new in a long time that doesn't make me panic.'
Next morning found them both racing through the sky on their brooms at four am.
221B Baker Street, London.
'But why didn't you wish me?' Draco asked, his voice weak, pleading, defeated, confused and petulant. He didn't care. 'No gifts either.'
Hermione looked worriedly into his eyes. ‘Sure this is not your overprotective instinct flaring up?’ Everyone knew Ron became extra vigilant after Fred’s death.
‘Is that when you called us for help?’ John asked, shifting in his seat.
‘What’s with her memory? How do you know about it?’ Harry asked again and then narrowed his eyes. ‘Blimey, Ron, she’s a kid according to what you said. Why are you so nervous?’
Seven pairs of eyes blinked. Blaise deflated first. 'Oh, Draco!'
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that Neville looked ready to pounce, Dean and Seamus restraining him with their combined strength. Harry took a deep breath and walked towards the podium.
He wondered if that time he had been waiting for never came because they weren't meant to be. It was a depressing thought.
'Don't tell the others,' Potter had asked.
'My gift is a Canterbury Bell scented perfume,' Pansy added.
‘But you are helping, Dean. We all are trying our best.’
Sherlock hummed once more. ‘Can we suspect her of being high?’
‘Yes,’ Parkinson nodded, a quill ticking it off in a list floating beside her.
'Dad!' Lily comes barreling into Harry just seconds after he steps out of the floo. 'Dad!' she demands, extending her arms and Harry scoops her up.
Dean was about to open his mouth but Cas beat him to it.
‘Why is it?’ Bobby stressed.
'Yes,' Draco whispered, not looking away. 'The sunshine is brighter.'
'The tail needs to be a little less curved,' Ron nodded.
'Why, scared Potter?' He called back.
'Objectively, I know that black, white and grey exist. But I can't differentiate them in reality. People were being nice for the first time. Their intentions, my actions and their consequences all got lost in translation.'
'It's slightly cloudy. It might rain,' she added.
‘There’s nothing strange about it,’ she said as she turned the page.
'Can you take me to a tattoo parlour, then?'
‘Yes,’ Draco agreed, summoning said wand and producing a blue wispy stallion. He relayed the message that needed to be sent as he watched Ron and Harry cross the room’s threshold. He then directed a memo to Christopher Bones and Dennis Creevey, his junior Aurors, asking them to assemble in their discussion room in ten minutes. A quick note to Magical Archives ensured that by the time his orders to the duo were complete, his desk would be occupied with the list he’d have to painstakingly go through and separate. It was going to be a long day.
Cas looked amused. Sam didn’t. He turned his glare onto Dean who pushed himself off the floor, ignoring his younger brother and walking towards the bathroom. Sam, who was growing agitated by the minute, couldn’t control himself any longer.
‘Ron’s worried.’
‘Someone with a big enough motive and plenty enough resources to carry it out for two months,’ Bobby continued.
'Careful!'
'You sound more bitter about the fact that I have any rather than that I hex them.'
‘You have a fully functional phone in your left coat pocket,’ John complained.
‘Jane said it’s in Scotland.’
'The squirrel is real. You can't call a real squirrel a phantom, James Sirius,' Al adds.
Sam looked up from his laptop at that. He sighed inwardly. Dean was once again getting worked up over unanswerable questions.
‘Now you’re being possessive.’
Harry blushed and blushed until he was sure his face resembled a tomato. He was caught and he didn't want to lie to himself, his best friend or Draco. Luckily, Hermione came to his rescue.
It was the last day of his unexpectedly peaceful apprenticeship and the day of his interview. Potter woke him up with open mouthed kisses and two mind numbing blow jobs. And when Draco remained immobilised from his orgasms, Potter took to sponging him down in the shower.
'Good.' Draco didn't take his eyes off Potter. Even if it burned to look at the person he wanted to fall into and cry.
Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, Cadmus Peverell, Dursleys, Prewetts, Morfin Gaunt, Nymphadora Tonks, Blaise Zabini, Millicent Bulstrode, Astoria Greengrass, Barty Crouch, Rolf Scamander, Lorcan Scamander, original characters.
‘Oh John!’ Sherlock clapped his hands and leaned back in his chair. ‘It is like I always say. You see but do not observe. You woke up today morning with the decision you took yesterday sound in your mind and set out to bring us our supply of groceries for this month. Even considering that the list has expanded to include your daughter’s essentials, it wouldn’t have taken you more than thirty minutes to wrap up your shopping. So what does it say if you haven’t returned in that time? You’ve met someone you know and stopped for a chat. Seeing that you went out rather early, there can’t have been that many people who’d stop you and more particularly for such a long time. There’s only one person in this neighbourhood who’s schedule is tight enough to permit her a morning grocery run- Ms.Hope. It’s evident she didn’t want medical advice since she could have either called us or come straight here. Based on the impressions of the bags on your palms, it’s clear you have accompanied her home. But you didn’t stay. Why? Possibility points out that her storytelling was probably complete by the time you reached her house. Now what does this tell us about the nature of her problem? It’s major and something important.’
‘She’s clueless. She doesn’t know her name. George bolted out of storage within a minute of her arrival while I crumbled to the floor where I stood. Her aura, Harry, oh Merlin..’ Ron locked eyes with Harry once more. ‘The girl is projecting dark magic that felt akin to those horcruxes of Voldemort. Both George and I felt drawn to her as though called. It took everything in me to pull us out of that trance and not give in. I used those magic dampeners you gave me last winter to bring her till here,’ he said, turning to Draco at the end.
'Yes, when each house has made their peace with Slytherins is going to save my life tomorrow.'
Draco mock glowered at Harry. ‘No, because I’d like to complete the work before the weekend. Now, your files won’t write themselves, Potter.’
: Nine petaled lotus
'Well, Grimmauld is too big for me,' Harry shrugged, leaving a lot unsaid. The girls understood, though.
The Auror bullpen is in a flurry of activity by the time Harry enters. There's the sound of pages turning, owls swooping in and out, yellow interdepartmental memos whizzing to the recipients and the scritch scratch of quill on parchment. A steady thud of footsteps in and out of the cubicles follows him as he walks towards his room at the end. Astoria joins him midway, her quick quill and notepad hovering behind her as she briefs him up. Harry listens partially as his mind busily sorts through everyone he knows for the answer to Luna's question.
‘Yeah, but Dean, we’ve been dealing with that kind for seven years. We are professionals,’ Sam said slowly, realising there was subtext to his statement but not understanding what it was.
‘What happened after she was found?’
There was a cool breeze blowing through the leaves and rustling them. It was neither sunny nor cloudy. Just the perfect weather for their cosy little group.
Pansy and Daphne approached him as he stretched himself on the couch.
‘I always thought she fancied Blaise but she was in hysterics that Granger  and Weasley broke up. I wondered if she liked either of them. Then she urged Blaise to pacify Granger. I didn’t understand why. Now, she’s going somewhere with
Longbottom went on but Draco didn't hear it. He recognised those flowers. His mother loved to garden after all. Hearing it confirmed from their resident Herbologist made him snap his eyes to Potter's wonderfully blushing face.
'Is this some kind of regular Gryffindor bonding thing or something?'
'I'm a Puff, Daphne and I've been told I pack a powerful uppercut.'
‘I’m not suspecting him! I just want to know where he went and what he did.’
John coughed, took a sip of his tea and cleared his throat. ‘What do you mean by a witch, Ms.Hope? A sorceress who deals with voodoo and spirits and stuff or a magician who performs tricks?’
A sigh.
'Look who's talking, Ron!'
‘So called Gryffindors,’ glowered Pansy.
'So, Hannah, does this mean your house has finally accepted that Slytherins and evil are not synonymous?'
'This,' Weasley choked.
‘We went to the cafe for breakfast as we do every Sunday. It happened when we were leaving to go home. You see, Nancy went out first but as I was about to join her on the pavement, I realised that my coat got stuck in the door. I was untangling it when she disappeared with a yelp. One minute, she was there, Mr.Holmes,’ Ms.Hope said, pointing to a space to the left of John, ‘and the next, she wasn't. My situation is totally desolate. I won’t find her!’ She hid her face in her hands, her small frame shaking with her sobs.
'Can't or won't?'
‘Protective, but you know why. I told you!’
Draco looked on flabbergasted before he went after him. 'The guy hates me. He'll never approve of my apprentice work. At this rate, I'll be stuck there forever. Potter!'
The kiss was an explosion of sensations from the moment their lips touched. It started out soft and slow, a gentle, hesitant and long overdue press of two hot mouths against each other. Then they tangled their tongues and the kiss went from innocent to hot in seconds. Potter leisurely licked into Draco's mouth, exploring, searching for the delightful corners and sighing into his mouth.
'We can't carry it with us in an aeroplane. We can't go to another country armed to the teeth.'
Kreacher padded into the room, one bony finger pointing accusingly. 'House elves be trained in them things. House elves be knowing what is helping their masters.' He bowed to Harry and spoke in a much more obedient tone, 'Kreacher be taking over the dinner, Lord Potter.'
'Is this revenge, Malfoy?' Potter shouted when they landed on the hill, wet and shivering from the rain falling at Hogwarts.
'Alright Ron, that's enough for today.'
Pansy rolled her eyes. ‘I need someone to tail Draco.’
Thanksgiving dawned on them, abnormally cold and cloudy. Draco woke up late from a fitful sleep and didn't even have time to overthink if the atmosphere outside was setting the tone to what was to unfold that day.
The third time it happened, it was because of Potter's stupid house elf. Draco and Kreacher were two hours into their staring competition and Blaise was lounging on one of the couches, holding the timer with one hand and biting into his apples with the other.
----------
Blaise looked smug, like he approved. Pansy nodded gleefully. ‘Draco, you owe me twenty galleons for getting together with Potter before leaving Hogwarts.’
'To raid it. Why would anyone go to a tattoo place, Potter?'
‘Mr.Lestrade took him to the police station for questioning. He was probably suspicious of attempted kidnapping since we didn’t recognise the man, but the latter insisted he was only trying to help Nancy find her way home. Since the nearby security footage showed no signs of abduction, he was released.’
Evening had more surprises in store for Harry which didn't include the gifts their expected guests came with. Harry had scoured through London with Kreacher because "only the finest wine for Miss Cissy, Master!" Needless to say, Narcissa was not only impressed but thoroughly determined to see to the end of it by that night.
‘We’re starting easy then?’ asked the soldier, his lips curving against the scar on his cheek. ‘Who else? Ronald Weasley, his own relative. He led the Four Great Sects into the battle and stormed the Potter Manor. I have to say, I’m impressed.’
It was largely because of his soul. His body was lost and his soul couldn’t be found. This left the people with an opportunity to go wild with their theories. Not a week passed without someone or the other hearing from their neighbouring towns and villages about some kind of speculation regarding Harry Potter’s demise. The two most commonly in circulation were that Harry Potter’s soul had either been ripped apart by his ghostmen or that it disappeared without a trace.
'What's that on your arm?'
‘Rose?’ Ron asked, waving back in response.
Blaise
‘So?’ Dean asked.
Draco was still tense. 'For what?' he croaked.
Harry gestures at Ron's opposite ear instead of answering. When they settle down, he rotates his neck a bit and bends it from side to side, hoping to get some crick to sound. 'I have a stiff neck today,' he lies. Astoria watches him like a hawk but he doesn't glance at her. 'You guys can get started with… what's his name.. Murray, yes. I'll be by in a bit. And Astoria, can you get me the authorisations I have to sign on?'
'You literally spend half your day with your eyes glued to the sky, Draco. Just accept it!'
Harry listened attentively, stroking his thumb on Draco's knuckles. 'I'm sorry,' Draco repeated. 'When there's no light, one can't differentiate the colours.'
But sitting in front of Luna and hearing the same words from her, Harry wonders if Luna had been the right call. She's in a pinkish purple neon shirt, swaying side to side in her revolving chair and cleaning her Spectrespecs with a greenish fluid whose consistency is halfway between dragon slime and flobberworm mucus. To be honest, Harry's not as revolted as he's curious.
Houston, Texas.
‘The ghost of Canton has been put to rest,’ Cas said between heavy, deep breaths.
As things then stood, however, Draco could only fault Potter's deranged dog for his mistake.
Harry smiled, his mind suddenly flooding with the best parts of the day. 'It was different. Quiet, or as quiet as it can be with a toddler,' he chuckled, 'but it was a quietness that didn't feel out of place.'
'You're screwed.' Pansy shook her head and told him that day. Draco vehemently denied it. He had it all under control.
‘Great, what are you waiting for then? Zap us, Cas.’ Dean extended a hand in Cas’ direction.
'I should be saying that!' Harry cried, indignant. 'You two are attached at the hip!'
‘But they’re all different!’ Sam exclaimed. ‘None of the seven incidents I’ve picked as the most severe are because of the same supernatural creature. I mean, I’m almost sure we’re dealing with a wraith in Michigan and a siren in Colorado. My guess is, the remaining five are different too.’
'For which you'd have to start studying from now if you harbour any hope of passing them,' Granger said, rolling her eyes.
‘It’s not occupied,’ she replied and went back to her books.
Auror Department, Ministry of Magic.
For a few minutes, absolute silence and stillness enveloped the room, the likes of which can only be compared to that found in a cemetery. The three hunters held in their breaths, alert and guarded, as though under attack.
His patience was usually tested come Teddy's nap time. Putting a high on sugar and energy Teddy to sleep was about as easy as convincing the Ministry of Voldemort's return had been.
‘Easy or not, good riddance at last!’ exclaimed another man.
Harry tugged him close and wrapped an arm around his shoulder. 'Let him speak, Draco.'
Bobby looked from Dean to Sam and back before sighing loudly. That got Sam’s attention. He paused his research of the folklore and turned in his chair. Not everything got Bobby Singer acting abnormally and even fewer ones frightened him. The niggling thought that Bobby had more bad news to impart couldn’t be ignored any longer.
All of them exchanged significant looks at that. The tiny flame of hope that Harry didn’t know he had been harboring was extinguished in a single breeze. The conclusion was too much in their faces to avoid it now. The incident hadn’t been accidental. Someone had deliberately sent the kid into their midst. Why? Harry didn’t yet know. He just sent a desperate prayer up, wishing little Rose wasn’t a ticking time bomb walking amongst them.
Terry nudged Smith after an awkward moment. Harry narrowed his eyes at that.
Draco paid Ron no heed. 'I wanted to make my supposed boyfriend, who couldn't even get me a gift, suffer the sight of his crush being snogged by his ex.'
She pulled herself together and continued, 'Around Albus' grave and I'm certain he'd like some company. It's a great idea, Mr. Longbottom. I'm quite pleased.'
Finnigan stared at it for quite a long time before scrambling into Thomas' lap and pulling him in for a hug. 'Dean,' he choked out.
‘I’m pretty sure you can narrate the events in the order they occurred without misspelling any names or places with the number of times you’ve read them. So, what is it, Bobby?’
'You didn't speak to anyone for three days after receiving the news, you shut people out. I overthought and assumed..'
'Eating,' they reply, properly subdued and that is what they all get back to.
That was how Draco found himself walking down the path to the castle gates with Potter, just as Hogwarts got ready for the evening feast.
It was weird. It was the same Draco he saw and spoke to everyday at Hogwarts. Hermione had even once pointed out how, barring Draco's Ancient Runes class, they were both practically joined at the hip. Harry was forced to concede her point after they had returned, happy, light and laughing, from their impromptu trip to a place whose name Draco still refused to give.
'I'm NOT going to feed you tomorrow when Potter's not home!' Draco knew it was ineffective. He suspected the dog even flicked his ears.
‘You both disappear for ten days, turn up bruised and bleeding and all I get is “the ghost is dead?”’
'Dragon Lilies?' Harry cut in. Draco's mouth closed shut, as if only then realising. 'I hate Smith, Draco. I hated that you had time for him but not me. You behaved as if you didn't want this. You had time to play Snap before NEWTS but when I needed to talk to you, "personal things had to wait"? I was only giving you an easy out.'
'Means a lot,' Ginevra said, barely keeping it together. 'Excuse me,' she whispered and then she was exiting the common room, Draco's eyes trained on her till the door shut behind her.
‘I have something of yours.’ Potter was panting.
Potter sounded out of breath. Draco stubbornly kept going.
'Ted-' Harry began and paused. He cleared his throat once. 'Teddy's my godson,' he said by way of an explanation.
'Moving on,' Harry whispered. He felt Ron squeeze in behind him.
Their secret longing
Pansy turned to look at the pink haired Hufflepuff behind her.
'When you wish upon a star
----------
‘Doing Potions?’
Houston, Texas.
'I hate morning breath, though. So get off me now!'
Pansy wrung her hands together. ‘Yes, I need them to be together now. They are the only ones who can sort out the mess.’
Draco increased his strides.
Harry sighed. He knew once they were summoned, there was little they could do about it. ‘He is again going to go off about how we have enough men but twice the workload. Anyway, if AA requested it, I don’t think he had much of a choice in the matter. Those seven cases are going to be brought up during the eval. We just have to be prepared for it.’
Blaise wasn't totally convinced but then he had to admit, Ginevra had a knack for guessing right. Draco and Potter were indeed locked in a full blown snog session when they reached the pitch. In the air, that is.
Fate steps in and sees you through
Potter-Harry- smiled up at Draco, revelling in the wonder his boyfriend was. 'Draco,' he said softly, tucking Draco's hair behind his ear. Draco stopped and stared.
'I did these!' Al proudly picks up the topmost sheet from the pile of crayon drawings next to him and presents it over the table to Harry. He inspects the mis-coloured drawing of a squirrel that Jamie seems to have befriended in their backyard that day.
Whoops! I'm late. Sorry about that.
Ron looked at him wide eyed, his face as pale as Draco’s skin. Harry decided not to point it out because he doubted either of the two would appreciate the comparison.
Astoria returns with the papers. Ron shakes his head at her and she raises a brow at him. Five minutes later they go to Murray and Harry opens the first of the many documents he needs to pore over. His long day has just started.
‘Yeah,’ Dean agreed, tossing one of his shirts into a duffel bag. ‘We had enough on our hands here.’ Before Sam could even frown at the neutral reply, Dean shot a look at Cas again. ‘Which is why we’d like to get some extra time for resting.’
Cas looked on amused even as Sam facepalmed.
Ron wanted to blame himself. He really could have not overreacted.
'Not yet,' Draco murmured.
, like his namesake and his owner, was an absolute disaster. Draco would be lying if he said he never wanted to kick him out. 'Sirius! You blasted dog! Give me my papers back!' Draco yelled, chasing him. Sirius made short work of the stairs and disappeared to the third floor.
'Congratulations, love.' Harry pulled him down for a wet, toe curling, sappy kiss. Draco purred contended, tightening his arms around Harry.
It had been easy for Draco to get a first edition copy of Rare Charms and Unique Spells for Granger, a chocolate frog card made in honour of Fred Weasley for Weasley and his sister and an assorted collection of Celestina Warbeck's classics for Longbottom, who loved them and transferred some of his admiration for her onto Blaise as well.
‘It was across the road in a lane on the other side of the park,’ Ms.Hope answered. ‘One of Mr.Lestrade’s constables spotted her with a man.’
Dean crossed his hands over his chest. ‘Does this mean you indirectly agree with Sam on this matter of me ignoring the details?’
'Potter's tattooed now,' Draco revealed, responding to Potter's glare with a smirk.
‘Well, for the lack of a better word, they are interesting even if implausible.’
‘You have the details of the case right here,’ said Dean pointing to Sam’s notebook on his bed. Bobby made as if to take it but Dean moved it out of his reach and sat facing him instead.
They both turned towards Harry who gave them a sheepish look. 'Andy might look normal, but she is far from it. The war-' he stuttered, 'she lost her family and is extremely possessive of Teddy. Some days, it's like she's just a body, no soul. I don't know what she and your mother discussed, Draco, but if I know anything about her, she would have avoided talking about it altogether. She needed to feel like she still had a family. But Ron and the others needed me too, so I went over to theirs the next day.'
boyfriend!’
'Shut up, Seamus! Or I'll tell them why you don't mind.'
Harry grinned, letting his head knock into Draco's as the others roared in laughter behind them.
'They are,' Draco agreed, sighing and relaxing against Potter.
Blaise became pensive once again after lunch. They were lying in an odd sort of pentagon on the rug, surrounding the coffee table, in front of the fireplace. Daphne was resting on Pansy's legs, Potter slipped a hand into Draco's hair, gently scratching his scalp and Blaise was tickling Longbottom's neck with his toes, openly planning his upcoming birthday aloud.
'Well,' Blaise said, licking his lips, 'we should thank them too, don't you think?'
'If you don't have plans,' Potter mumbled, glancing down at his hands.
'Sharing a dorm with Seamus and me didn't teach you that you need to revise your definition of discreet?'
'Harry!' Granger exclaimed, awed and momentarily speechless. She traced the otter on his left shoulder even as Weasley hugged him, kissing his forehead, eyes teary at the sight of the terrier on Potter's right shoulder.
'McGonagall may have your dog thrown out, Potter,' Draco murmured, throwing an arm around Harry.
'Maybe it's just like how Lovegood said. Our magic and the rain's natural magic do not gel well,' Draco answered in response to Potter's grumbling. Potter just rolled his eyes.
John looked as gobsmacked as ever. He opened his mouth and closed it again. Finally, he sighed and said, ‘It’s about her niece. You remember how we heard something was wrong with her three weeks ago? Ms. Hope believes it isn’t all as it is said to be.’
‘Am I here to witness Ron going into Three Broomsticks at night with Parkinson?’
‘Your obsession keeps growing everyday! Stop being suspicious, Ron. He can take care of himself.’
'HEY!' Harry and Draco protested.
‘I’d like to remind you that I’m several years older than a lot of humans on the Earth.’ Cas said in between his chips.
'You,' Daphne pointed out when he passed by her in the hallway, 'are being irrational.' Draco paid her no heed, knowing the husky would follow him.
Draco quietly left the classroom, Potter’s hurried footsteps following him; they shouldn’t have bickered. That annoying idiot. Why was he trying to give Draco whatever in her class?
'So,' Ron slapped Harry's thigh as he took the seat next to him on the common room couch, 'how was Christmas at Andy and Teddy's?'
'And I certainly hate it when my supposed boyfriend doesn't even wish me on my 19th.'

'Strange why my mind conjured that when I was clearly receiving them,' Draco went on, deliberately riling Potter up.
‘You would do it nevertheless,’ Cas retorted and stared at the coffee table. The mess immediately sorted itself into neat piles.
Sam shrugged. ‘We neither travelled that far before nor expected to, all things considered.’
‘I asked you to meet me today because Pansy knows where they’re meeting tomorrow.’
Draco gave Millie a feline grin and waved her goodbye. She stuck her tongue out and banged the door shut behind her. 'They are never going to get just how chaotic rains are,' Draco said. Ginevra agreed happily.
Ron’s eyes glazed over. ‘Yes,’ he answered and cleared his throat. ‘Anyway, it’s different. I can’t pinpoint it but I know something’s changed.’
Thing was, Harry wanted to be asked. He didn't resent that his friends were couples and wanted privacy sometimes. He knew they would always support him but the realisation that he was on his own, would be on his own, from then on didn't sit well with him. Because Harry didn't do "alone". He couldn't.
It took Weasley one hour to convince him.
Harry's resolve crumpled at Draco's desolate look. 'The flowers were mine,' he whispered. 'I left a note too.' He knelt before Draco, cupping his wet face in his palm. He distantly registered their friends leaving the bubble of Muffliato.

'Are you seeing what I'm seeing?'

May of 1999 was in some way a recollection of all things that a large part of the wizarding populace was trying their hardest to forget or let go since the past twelve months. Hogwarts was no exception.
When Harry went back to the common room in the evening, he found Draco and Smith occupying the love seat next to the fireplace with tongues down each others' throats.
And watch they did as the sky lightened and the sun rose in a golden hue. Potter was dumbstruck.
'I didn't, Ron.'
There was the suffocating stillness to the room again disturbed only by Teddy babbling and chewing on his fist and clapping wildly at something.
Harry knew his speeches and actions would alone not be enough to wash away years of resentment and was aware that the lull of the past few months after school started was only suppression. He knew he decided to let bygones be bygones partly because he didn't want to lose more people and partly because something changed when he died. He also knew that wasn't everyone's case so he did what he could- wait. Because change was gradual and inevitable.
Ms.Hope deigned to concede with a short bow and continued as if she hadn’t heard Sherlock. ‘You don’t have to believe in magic, Mr.Holmes. The fact remains that my niece disappeared without a trace. It’s been two days and there have been no ransom calls suggesting abduction nor has Nancy returned. She’s ten years old, sir. I beg you to do everything you can in this impossible situation and at least find some light where others couldn’t.’ She became teary once more towards the end as she held her own trembling hands tightly in a grip.
Your dreams come true'
'We know these are empty apologies and that we can't do anything to make up for your loss. We are, however, willing to change. We want to become decent humans and better wizards. We want to right our wrongs. For that, we need something great from you.'
For some reason, probably because she's Luna, the questions didn't sound as offensive. But she's talked about hate just like the others and Harry's suddenly on alert.
Pansy sat up at that. 'That,' she said, pointing to the cam, 'is excellent blackmail material that will serve me for the next forty years to come. I'm too much of a Slytherin to let go of that kind of treasure.'
Important members (royalty)- Molly Weasley, Ronald Weasley, Ginevra Weasley, Harry Potter
'Hm,' Ron said, thoughtful, 'I think his methods there and the Slytherins here are helping you well.'
Harry.
'Potter!'
‘Shut up and listen, both of you. Honestly, it’s been a nightmare since you’ve become partners,’ he huffed.
‘It was-’ John began but Sherlock stopped him.
Draco Malfoy snorted. 'Nope,' he denied.
‘Because this can help us find out right now.’
'Hold your stone like this,' he said, taking Draco's wrist and wrapping his fingers around the stone. Harry could feel Draco's pulse racing madly. 'Now you flick it,' he motioned and let Draco release the stone. It skipped thrice before dunking in.
'So Harry, if you had to choose two people, two things and two situations you'd like to hate and resent, what would they be?'
Case. In. Point.
Harry loved Teddy so much that he was repeatedly told the only reason he wouldn't get custody of Teddy would be because he would spoil the boy to bits. Harry would shrug because "what else are godfathers for, do you think, Andy?" He had undoubtedly taken a leaf out of Sirius' "How to be the best godfather" book. As such, Harry could deny Teddy nothing.
Draco hunted it into their living room where Potter was reading a book. 'Sirius,' Draco growled. 'Give. Me. My. Papers.' Sirius stared unblinkingly up at Draco. 'I SAID GIVE THEM TO ME, IDIOT! Do you know what they mean? No, you don't. You're just dumb. Ha-'
It had been going on for about an hour. Dean was less than impressed that Cas refused to zap them to London and more than pissed that they had yet to get a proper answer to their questions to the Angels. It wasn’t Cas’ fault and Dean knew it. But Cas was the mediator and he therefore had to carry the information and any blame that came with it. So of course, Cas wasn’t impressed either. There was much more they had to do before they could even depart from Houston and Dean was being a child. Angel or not, Cas had his limits as well.
