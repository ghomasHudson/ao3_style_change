"Yeah, I'm spoiling her," Harry said, but his eyes were gleaming as they exited the platform and went to buy some ice-cream.
He had his wand thrust at him, and his tie loosened. Pulling the knife out from inside him, he got up and faced himself.
"Shut up. You don't know anything," Harry seethed, pressing a pillow around his head to cover his ears. But it did no use.
"Smith." the boy looked down at Draco, who sat on the ground with blood-stained clothes and tear-stained cheeks. "Rot in hell."
"They aren't going to give you a potion that hasn't been tested, Harry! They performed spells on it to see if there were any dangers."
"He's been acting weird, Hermione," Draco said, gesturing towards Harry. "He's having these really weird mood swings."
Tobias Henley was a frightening man. He towered over Harry, and he had a menacing gleam in his eyes that meant 'I have no time for you Ministry gnomes.'
“How come you’re not mad that he was talking to another girl?” he asked curiously. Hermione gave him a warm smile.
Pansy was roughly grabbed from her bed by her hair and Filch dragged her out of the dungeons and dropped her at Harry's feet.
Draco's voice was tart when he spoke. "Obviously, I don't care, Potter. It's the fact that I don't want to die alongside you, you see."
, Harry! I tried flirting with Draco to make you jealous, but it never worked! Because you're oblivious!"
Draco looked up from his phone with a bored expression. "They really do." He looked down and resumed tapping away again. Harry really regretted giving him one.
"Oh well," Draco shrugged. "I've been obsessed with you ever since I first laid eyes on you. This was bound to happen."
"She's still alive," he reassured Harry. "I think she drunk herself out." Malfoy gestured to the empty liquor bottles that were scattered around the limp form, liquid oozing out of them.
"So, Pansy's finally expelled!" Draco said, falling onto the bed with Harry. It was Christmas Eve, and the two were blessed with the luxury of an empty dormitory.
"Where were you?" Ron asked through a mouth full of chicken as the two entered the Great Hall and sat down across him.
"Because we're going to be studying the Devil's Snare today! And we'll be working with it up close!"
"I hate this! Help him, please!" the torn boy pleaded. McGonagall grasped her temples in frustration. She should know how to fix him! She should've- she should've-
Draco didn't shrug his hand off. Suddenly, the doors to the room flew open, and in came Ron and Hermione, their eyes wide.
Harry watched her leave with resentment. It was easy for her to comfort him! She didn't have to work with bloody Draco Malfoy. He sighed, lifting his head from the desk and taking the case file she had left. A murder in Piton Street of an old Muggle woman and her dog.
Malfoy opened his mouth to protest, but Harry obliged readily. "Of course, Professor." he took Malfoy's arm and dragged him over to Hermione's desk, grabbing an extra chair and plopping down into it.
"You can still heal him a little, nevertheless," Madam Pomfrey said, grabbing the blond's arm and sitting him down next to Harry.
"Draco! Go to Harry! Now!" she said, limping over to him and grabbing the front of his robes and tugging him from his seat weakly.
"I'm sorry, Harry," Draco said apologetically. "I just- she was my friend back then! How could she betray me like this?"
"They'll probably go in the system," Hermione had said when Harry asked. And although he had hated the fact, there was not much he could do about it.
The boy was pale but recovering slowly. His head was wrapped up like a turban, reminding Draco of Quirrel in their first year.
"Were you trying to break my phone?" Harry said, putting his phone away. To think the git didn't want to be friends. Fucking bipolar.
"The two were very close, apparently," Draco said. "From what her other neighbors have said in their statements."
"I know what you're thinking," Rob said, narrowing his eyes. "That just because I've got tats and large muscles, I'm not allowed to do 'feminine' things like sewing. I should be clubbing or working out. Well, let me tell you, Mr. Malfoy, that I'd rather die than live that life again. Because that life was the one that got me thrown in jail, and not a second goes by where I don't want to kill myself for it."
Harry stiffened at the familiar voice. Ron and Hermione got up and left, obviously wanting to give the two privacy. Draco sat down on the bed next to Harry.
"Did she have to live in a fucking forest?" Harry asked, grimacing at the mud on his shoes. Malfoy didn't respond, and his silence made Harry's heart pang slightly.
"Right," he cut in. "Moving on, I'd like you to call your friend and put him on speaker, Rob. We need to check if you're telling the truth."
Although they had come out, they thoroughly enjoyed the privacy of the Room of Requirement. Undisturbed, the two had done a wide range of things. Some of those being wholesome, like snuggling and talking. The others were... not so wholesome.
The holidays were edging nearer, and the students of Hogwarts were excited. Harry and Draco had taken advantage of the several mistletoes that had hung up in the corridors.
"I can't see her dad killing her mother," Harry said, frowning. "They hadn't seen in each other in over thirty years. He can't have been planning a murder for thirty years."
Harry slumped back in his seat as he was hit with a wave of strong emotions. His chest panged uncomfortably, and his eyes welled with tears.
"There is a high chance of death," she said through gritted teeth, as though being forced to tell them. "He might not survive, as the memories need to be given freely."
"Draco, I-" Harry's eyes welled with tears. "God, I'm pathetic. As if I haven't heard of people dying before. Hell, I watched them die."
"Harry, promise me you won't keep anything under wraps," Hermione said as they made their way to the boys' room.
Draco ran through the corridors and out of the castle. Just in time to see a brunet being held at the edge of the Tower by a black-haired girl. He knew the boy was Harry. But who was the girl?
"I don't think I want to have any agreement with you, Potter," Malfoy said, looking down at Harry with cold eyes. Harry felt a small pang in his chest. "We're partners. I'm not going to make friends with the boy I've hated since childhood for the mere sake of it."
McGonagall cleared her throat. "Well, I think we now know why your brain has locked off those memories.
"With all due respect, Professor, I don't think a mental disease is the problem..." Harry intervened shyly.
The match began, and Smith had no problem intercepting the Quaffle. The Gryffindor Chasers had been passing around as if they were playing pass the parcel. Harry stood up from his seat and all but yelled at them.
The Slytherin screamed as his body ripped to shreds, just like Voldemort's. Harry smiled gleefully at the ash pile and felt a pang in his head as he woke up.
“SO WERE WE!” Harry exploded suddenly, facing her. “WE WERE ALSO CHILDREN. WE WERE FACING SOME FUCKED UP SHIT! BUT DID WE TURN INTO ASSHOLES?! I DON’T THINK SO!”
They apparated in front of the house and saw a group of Aurors already surrounding it. A woman stood in front of the entrance, holding a man to her with a wand to his head.
"Professor, are you alright?" he asked, bolting out his chair to go stand beside her. She nodded weakly.
The spell hit Malfoy in the chest, and he seized up a little. "Bloody hell, Granger," he snarled. "Did you have to do it so hard? You little bitch!"
Malfoy opened his mouth to reply, but he was cut off by Henley, who walked back into the room with a letter in his hands. This time, Harry managed to grab it. Unfolding it, he read it aloud.
"When we got to the Department of Mysteries, we were attacked. And suddenly, the Order was there, and we were all fighting, and Sirius was right next to the veil, and Bellatrix cast that spell and-" he let out a sob.
"Well then, I guess you'll have to cry forever," Malfoy said simply. He turned his wand onto Hermione, who stood up straighter and raised her own in return.
"Well, I'll be going then," Harry said. He stood up and made to leave. He made it to the door before he felt the sensation of his abdomen being ripped open, and dropped ceremoniously to the floor.
"No one forgets when you tell them you love them, Ron!" Harry groaned. "God, I've probably made things so awkward now..."
"Is that safe?" Hermione inquired. "The Devil's Snare is deadly. It nearly killed us in our first year."
"Harry, we have some things we need to tell you," McGonagall said, taking a seat at the edge of the bed.
Malfoy ignored him. "Can anyone confirm this other than yourself?" he asked. Henley stared him down patronizingly.
"You won't have peace! You'll create a bigger war inside your head! Think about this; you're taking away a
"You're quite the flirt now, aren't you?" he heard Malfoy bellow. Harry sent a scowl down the stairs. He walked down the hallway and entered the first door he reached. It was an empty room, pale with splotches of grime and grease plastering its walls. He closed the door with a grimace before continuing down.
"You think I've got an imprint?" Harry said, bewildered. "I don't think you've noticed, Hermione, but I'm not an animal."
"They don't. They're in love with the idea of me finally getting someone to spend my life with. The fact that you're the Boy Who Lived only makes them happier, seeing your status and everything." Draco chuckled.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a wary glance. "You're acting like you're still high, mate. You sure Malfoy didn't spell you or something?"
He was standing in Hogwarts uniform, his tie was green and silver. His red pupils looked like those of a cat's, and he hissed like a snake.
Draco came up to him where he was standing in front of the counter and hugged him from behind. "Well, it is the
"Well, at least you're here," Tobias said grudgingly. He took a sip of his drink and leaned forward slightly. "So, what did you want to know?"
Draco's grip on Harry's robe slackened, and Harry shot forward, grabbing Smith by his collar and lifting him a foot up into the ground. Smith gasped for air.
"Sorry. I- uh, forgot," Harry stammered, looking pointedly over Malfoy's shoulder. "Let's just go back, and I can send the owl later this evening."
They were the color of liquid gold. If Harry looked close enough, however, he could still see a tinge of silver hidden beneath the gold.
"Ron, calm down. What is it?" Harry asked, a little disturbed. Ron shook his head and proceeded to drag Harry to the briefing room. Robards was sat at the head of the long table, looking somber.
"Alright. We'll ask. But it's completely pointless!" Harry said before slumping back onto the desk. He heard Malfoy chuckle at his victory, and he promptly left the room, leaving Harry alone with his thoughts.
"What would you wear then?" Harry said, turning from side to side, examining the different angles in the mirror.
"No! He wanted to wait! We didn't complete the bond!" Draco said, self-loathing seeping into his words.
Harry jolted awake to a bustling classroom. Malfoy was still crushing the horn, his eyes a little red around the edges from the sting of them, and Harry was still chopping up a flobberworm. He felt a stinging sensation in his hand and realized with a start that he had accidentally cut his hand. He hissed in pain and pressed on the deep cut with all his might. Malfoy's head perked up. He scowled at Harry and promptly left their table.
"I'm sorry, Potter," the Headmistress said, looking at the ground ashamedly. "I should've done something-"
McGonagall looked at him pitifully. "Cheer up, Potter. It's not like you to give up hope so easily."
“Harry, come on,” Hermione reasoned, exasperated. “They were children! You shouldn’t hold it against them-“
She didn't respond, making Harry growl in frustration. He grabbed Draco's arm and dragged him out of the library. He yelped.
Harry made to grab Draco's hand, before remembering Hermione's presence. Draco must have noticed the movement because he frowned deeply.
"Well, Mr. Potter, that would extinguish any hope for a cure," she reminded him. He scratched the back of his head.
Harry followed his best friend to the entrance to the girl's bathrooms. She didn't turn around, so Harry went after her.
"What do we need a child for? Aren't you happy with just me?" Draco pouted. Harry looked back at him with a frown.
"Hey! I'm six years old! I'm too big to be picked up! Put me down!" she cried, smacking his shoulder. Harry frowned deeply.
"Ron, mate, I swear I would never have done anything with her," Harry said, unable to bear the broken look on his best friend's face.
Professor McGonagall was beside him in an instant, grabbing his chin gently and peering into his eyes. She stared into them, murmuring something silently.
"And you have not changed a bit since Hogwarts. Did the War teach you nothing, Malfoy?" Harry asked, getting up from the desk and walking towards the blond until they were nose to nose.
"No improvement?" Draco jumped at the sound of Hermione Granger, her head poking in through the door. He shook his head sadly.
"Looks like someone missed me," Harry beamed, wrapping his slender arms around Draco's neck and pulling him in for a kiss. Draco shifted so he was straddling Harry's waist and the two made out passionately.
“And who, pray tell, is your type?” Draco turned to look at him, his steely grey eyes drilling into Harry, expectant. Harry was about to say something flippant, to cut the tension between them, but then Draco added, “You know what they say: Fortune favours the brave.”
Harry needed a drink. The starched collar of his shirt was strangling him--he'd already stuffed its accomplice, the tie, into his suit pocket. He was roasting alive in the bloody jacket but Hermione told him he couldn't wear just a shirt and slacks to an evening wedding. Who came up with those asinine rules, anyway?
Harry's head snapped up from the files he was reading on his way into the exam room, instantly recognizing that voice but disbelieving it still.
It was so bloody tight. Harry had expected that--he'd experienced it with his fingers just minutes ago and other times besides--but he hadn't been prepared for how it would feel on his prick. He wanted to thrust forward, to drive himself into that exquisite channel, but he held back for Draco's sake.
“Right,” he said simply, nodding a brief acknowledgment to the elf then turning his back to set to his belt buckle.
Fortunately, that worry, at least, proved unfounded. After a minute or two of Harry attempting to regulate his ragged breathing to something that sounded slightly less like the Weasleys’ Ford Anglia (after its run-in with the Whomping Willow) and Malfoy trying unsuccessfully to replicate any of the previous spellwork, the Slytherin pocketed his wand with a thoughtful expression pinching his pale brows. He seemed to have a philosophical outlook on the whole affair—Harry could practically see the gears turning in his head even from his ground floor vantage point (as well as wholly new angles to torment himself with remembering in the dead of the night). Malfoy and Hermione were more alike than he had ever noticed before. What he really ought to be worried about, he decided, were the experiments Malfoy would almost certainly dream up to test the theories he was developing at the moment.
"Hang on a minute," Harry replied, urging Draco to stay. "I'm nearly done here. I just need to make the hand off to Savage when he arrives and then we can go together."
"Three," Draco answered with an amused chuckle at Harry's eagerness. He lifted his hands until his arms hung above his head like before and gripped the pillow cradling his skull. The Slytherin's gaze was half-lidded and intense. He watched the way Harry's own dark, green-ringed eyes looked on, almost enchanted by Draco's sweating body and waiting hole.
Draco paused to look sideways at the man, appraising. It was true Potter had made a few offhanded remarks while organizing the pots and jars that had been displaced and he'd ignored them--he couldn't very well reply in any sort of meaningful way, could he?--but Potter had genuinely wanted to converse, it seemed, and he was now put out because Draco hadn't reciprocated.
"Not that I mind the view--because I really don't--but I've got clean pyjamas up in my room that you probably missed in your search for clothes, if you want them," he offered.
"Let's go, before I change my mind about making you a needy mess during our date and just fuck you."
"Come off it," Malfoy grumbled irritably, crossing his arms before his chest. "Malfoy's fine. I'm not worried about any of these old codgers alerting the Prophet to my whereabouts." He was looking about the facilities and the handful of other patients therein, many of whom were, in fact, elderly (and utterly uninterested in the likes of a toffy blonde with a sour attitude and a limp, Harry thought).
Harry opened his eyes in time to see Draco come apart--beautifully and utterly focused on him, pink lip pulled tight between perfect white teeth, brow furrowed with concentration and effort. Besides the wonderful hot, tingly feelings in and around his body, the sight made something in his chest constrict in a way that merited further examination.
He came with a violent shudder but continued pumping through it, willing Draco to join him in the perfect, shattering decent.
The blonde leaned back into his seat with his glass firmly in hand and his legs crossed. He chuckled as he sipped a bit more wine, determined to be less of a slosh (high tolerance or no, vast amounts of alcohol consumption witnessed by a potential life-mate was
His thoughts fell away, unwilling to put a label on the way he was feeling just yet (whatever it was, however, turned his brain to mush and was painted clearly on his face.) Instead, he closed his eyes and began to work the laces on his trousers. He slipped a hand through the loosened hem and skated his fingers across his cock--the thought of brilliant green eyes and wild black hair stirring it to hardness before it was even freed.
The Black Estate, along with any Black family heirlooms therein, and the contents of the Black family vaults, will be hereby made for claim to the next in line, that being one Draco Lucius Malfoy. Unless the new heir agrees to sign his rights over to you, Harry James Potter, you will be made to vacate the premises and surrender the aforementioned properties within 30 days of your receipt of this owl.
But then it rolled through his head again and it didn't seem quite so ridiculous the second time. At least not compared to all of Malfoy's absurdity.
"Father always wanted me to help restore our name by acting 'like a proper Malfoy', which may have helped spur my hermitage."
He didn't often pull out all the stops when he was cooking for one. If anything, he just ate store bought biscuits or ice cream straight from the container. It was nice having the excuse to get a little creative in the kitchen.
He cried out when Draco ceased trusting to press directly on his prostrate, milking it expertly. A fat bead of come dropped from his cock into the trail of hair below his navel. The pleasure was intense but Harry needed real release.
Harry gasped at the sudden change in sensation. He never liked those trousers or shoes anyway so he bid them good riddance--he didn't have to worry about what he'd wear when they were done because he had a spare set of robes in the office. He wondered briefly what Draco's plan was, but then Draco thrust against him and Harry decided they could figure that out later.
if necessary! And be certain to take your vitamins. Are you getting low on medicine or food? I doubt your cupboards are well stocked considering your abysmal dieting habits at work. I'll send soup with a separate owl--don't ask the contents, but let us say it works best for nausea and headaches.
He brushed his lips in a feather-light kiss to the back of Draco's neck making him gasp and flinch. Smirking, Harry filed that information away for later and returned to the task at hand.
Wild magic. The thought had occurred to him. It seemed as good an explanation as any but he hadn’t ever known wild magic to behave like that. But then it was capable of some rather odd things. Turning Aunt Marge into a balloon came to mind...
His (nonexistent) love life was boring and passionless. He'd never had a lover who made him feel the kind of energy and excitement Morias's men kindled in each other, someone who challenged and enticed him to the point that he had to have the person right then and there.
Draco grunted as he fell onto an unfamiliar couch. It was soft and smelled of Potter, which meant he was instantly at ease as he moved to sit up on the cushion and slowly drag himself across it. He plopped onto his back and grabbed the hem of his shirt, which he pulled above his head and tossed absently at the Auror--who he hadn't noticed leave the room. His hands went to address his boots next, both legs lifting to hang over his head to make access to the buckles easier. He preferred a lot less dress when he slept.
"I see. So you have true feelings for my son?" Lucius asked with a quirk of his fine, blonde brow. "Would you fight to keep him?"
Draco bit back any needless pleading that might have threatened in response, and instead closed his eyes and whined through his nose. His movements became more frenzied as he rode Harry's cock with abandon. Unlike the Auror below him, Draco hadn't even thought to wank before coming over--making his walk along the edge quicker.
Malfoy tried to cast a handful of spells on his own but couldn’t get the wand motions right. It was curious that that hadn’t stopped him before—somehow he had borrowed enough of Harry’s magic to make up for the lack of technical precision. Hermione would want to know all about it, Harry mused, but he was content to not think overly critically about it for the time being. His most pressing concerns were continuing to make sure he didn’t suffer a heart attack from overexertion and his growing fear that Malfoy’s repeated failures would rob him of his recent good cheer.
"Right," Malfoy snapped, bracing himself on the doorjamb. "Because I have nothing better to do than,
, Harry told himself sternly. Stretches were next on the agenda and he was in dire need of a break before that particular test of resolve. Especially with his traitorous mind saying fuck all to propriety and professionalism.
He couldn’t bear to look at Malfoy dozing peacefully, face open and trusting in sleep in a way it never was in wakefulness. But even with his eyes closed, he could picture Malfoy’s unbridled joy, his expression bright with wonderment, at the strange, sparkling, seductive twine of magic that had pulsed inside and between them as they’d pushed the limits of their spell casting as well as their bodies that afternoon.
"You won't be finding out this evening, I'm afraid," he replied, rocking slowly and relishing in the slide of their pricks.
As he set the wards on his office door--with Draco nibbling his ear and whispering the filthiest of promises--he couldn't help feeling like he was forgetting something...
Draco took Harry's wand that had fallen to the bed and tossed it carefully across the room to his full hamper, where it landed quite harmlessly. Draco's own wand followed soon after.
But Harry’s magic had been well-controlled since his school days—he hadn’t accidentally inflated anyone in years. He wasn’t sure how to tactfully ask Malfoy if the same was true for him so, as per usual, he went with the direct approach.
"I love you," he whispered as his body desperately tried to calm itself. "I'm such an idiot... There was so much going on and too many things on my mind and my Occlumency hadn't been utilized as often... These are all just excuses, but the point is I screwed up and put you in danger. Again."
"Oh, right." Potter gave a self-depreciating grin and dropped the towel to step into a loose pair of faded denims. "Um...bark once if this was on purpose and twice if not."
"Fuck, Harry... That voice you use, that's why I let you boss me around..." Draco breathed as he released Harry's cock and gently dislodged his hand. He began to crawl backward along Harry's ready body, peppering kisses down his chest and stomach as he went. "Tell me more..."
“You’ve seen the full extent of my disability—it’s only fair for you to show me yours,” he stated matter-of-factly.
He was quick, but Gladys was apparently quicker. Just as he turned he went from the Boy-Who-Lived to the Man-Whose-Arse-Was-Pinched. Her claw-like fingers had snatched forward like a striking snake just in time to latch onto his left cheek in a quick pinch before she settled back in her chair and continued to read her Witch Weekly column. She smiled innocently, despite her obvious leering at the pictures on the page.
"Sorry I took so long," he said with a small, apologetic smile as he approached. He took the chair across from Harry and accepted the proffered teacup.
"I like denims," Harry replied simply with another shrug of indifference. "Besides, it's all coming off later, so what does it matter what I'm wearing now? I might as well be naked, for all intents and purposes." It took a great deal of effort not to smirk as he said it.
“I think it’s to do with whatever that was back there,” he replied, showing tremendous restraint by both chewing
Draco patiently kept his hand outstretched in invitation. His grin widened at the look of shock on the Auror's handsome face. Without the glasses, not only were his eyes no longer obscured (and they were quite a brilliant green), but his cheekbones were also visible. They added to the realization that Harry Potter was, indeed, a full grown man now. A blush threatened.
. Harry nearly cringed but he managed to smother it. Malfoy went on, none the wiser. "My symptoms have steadily worsened to the point that I can hardly use a quill or wield my wand with any precision, and I can no longer hide my condition. And you will wipe that pitying look off your face this instant or I will march out that door and file a complaint with both your superior and
"Figures," Malfoy muttered, shaking his head in exasperation (at whom, Harry wasn't sure). "You're a Gryffindor, after all."
"You mean the bright red ones with your name stitched into the pocket?" Draco asked as he pulled out the end result of his labors and put it on top of the range to cool. He turned to Harry and smirked. "Want to make your claim as official as possible? Or do you just like tormenting me with red? It's my least favorite color, you know, and not just because it's a Gryffindor color... Red looks terrible with my complexion."
And for your information, I do not typically go for dark-haired men. I was using his body as reference. His is the lean, muscular, fair-skinned type I prefer, so I would just imagine him with a different head.
As for my own sexuality, I just don't talk about it with many people. I really don't care if anyone knows, but I guess I know who to trust not to run their mouths. I have no idea how it isn't public yet either, other than I am generally anti-social.
Harry ran straight up to Draco so he could see his face (and read whatever subtle nuances might be there). He held his wand at his side--ready in case he needed it but hopefully not too threatening if he didn't. Draco's casual pose and attitude suggested that he wasn't the one who'd left the traps, though if he really was a master actor, such artifice wouldn't be difficult to pull off.
"Marry me!" Harry jokingly proclaimed. He quickly sobered under the weight of Draco's significant expression. "Er, actually," he rubbed the back of his neck, feeling awkward and off-kilter, "in case it comes up later in conversation with your father, I might've accidentally implied to him something that, while true, I haven't said to you yet. So...sorry for that." He cleared his throat. Draco's Face flickered but otherwise he was totally still.
of all people. "I've been in practice for five years, with three years of training before that and my own personal experience with occupational therapy besides. I am fully certified to practice."
Harry stayed up for another several hours, writing owls to be sent first thing in the morning and compiling case notes. He concluded the night with a short wank and a long shower.
Draco arched his back forward to give Harry's fingers more room to penetrate his arse for him. Both his hands, now free, moved to grip Harry's hips for balance as his tongue battled for dominance. After a long minute of intense snogging, Draco pulled away--before one of them suffocated. He nipped Harry's lips.
"I do want to," Harry acknowledged, looking Draco up and down with a greedy leer. "You also have me questioning the merits of going out when we could just stay in instead and spend the next however long with me unwrapping you like a present."
Ron went to Hermione, unsure whether he should be seeking comfort or offering it. They moved as one to the love seat and whispered, heads bowed together, casting barbed glances in Harry and Draco's direction.
Quit whinging, Potter, I did you a favour. The appropriate response is, "Thank you, Draco. You are a phenomenal partner. I am so lucky to have you. I would be lost without you. And, might I say, you look quite fetching in Auror burgundy," etc., etc.
Once he was comfortable, and Potter had his back to him, Draco decided it was time for a bit of ogling... Specifically the man's tight, rounded arse. His eyes skimmed across the edge of the Auror's back pockets curving lovingly over two perfect hemispheres. The double stitched seams felt like a tease--the line underneath begged to be caressed with the tip of his fingers or tickled with his tongue. He crossed his legs and scooted closer to the table to hide a growing problem before forcing his eyes away to peruse the rest of the unusual space.
Secondly, I'll have you know I'm still in perfect control of my mental faculties. Though for some reason I'm hungry, my head hurts, my other head is hard, and I'm salivating more than usual. I also just read a twenty page essay on the uses of orange peels in potions and now feel like I can quote it. I guess it does work, but the rest of me feels like it's going into over-drive, too. I better get out the library before someone notices my growing problems. Next reply may be delayed since owls have trouble inside the castle sometimes...
He took Harry's hand into his left as he used his right to tug and pull off the tie still wrapped about his neck. He folded the piece skillfully with one hand before sliding it into a pocket.
Despite the precautions he took downstairs, Draco leaned across the bed and gently ran his bare fingers through Potter's hair--pushing back the sweat slicked locks until they no longer clung to his face or ears.
Draco was tired (and full of delicious bacon), but couldn't help but smile at the offer. He nodded and began to break his toast apart to eat in small, dignified pieces.
Draco led them upstairs, across his room, and to the French doors that led to the balcony. The weather was perfect for dinner outside--the muggy heat of the day was forgotten in the cool evening breeze. The garden really was wild, but quite lovely all the same. Flowers and vines tangled and spilled every which way. Harry grinned and seated himself on a cushioned chaise.
Friday, at least, had gone by quickly. Harry and Ron were called in to assist with a break-in at Gringotts. The would-be thief hadn't managed to abscond with any valuables but it was quickly determined that he was operating under the effects of the Imperius, so there was a wizard at large using Unforgivables. Hence the Aurors being summoned.
"Minor bruising. Twisted ankle." Malfoy cleared his throat quietly before adding, "My pride suffered the worst of it."
," Ron retorted archly. "You two are absolutely impossible. Like a couple of randy teenagers, you are! You have two minutes to get back to the party or I'm sending Hermione. How do you think she'll feel about her child's godfathers missing present time because they can't keep it in their pants?"
"I thought the instrument was strange. I mean, how could something so small do anything? There's the needle, but other than breaking the skin it seemed less effective than, say, a knife... I suppose security felt the same, or he got away with bringing it in because it was tiny. I found out later how badly I misjudged the lethality of certain muggle instruments once I conducted a little research."
Ron dipped his quill, scanning the parchment for the spots that needed his initials. "It's the case we solved last week," he answered without looking up. "The one with the husband who nearly blasted his wife's head off. Trial date was set. For now they just want confirmation of our statements." He signed his name at the bottom and the papers disappeared into cold, blue flame. He was glad to be rid of them.
"Shower, then dinner, then I'm on top," he dictated haughtily after breaking away. He smirked down at his still-dazed partner who smiled up at him with unfocused eyes. "With you in the dress again," he stipulated.
," he rocked against Draco, making him inhale sharply, his grin victorious and pleased. "But I still want to hear it from you: do you really want this?"
"Try that again and you're on your own," Potter warned darkly. "Spiteful little bastard," he grumbled under his breath, shaking out his stinging thumb.
Harry spluttered, becoming increasingly indignant. “In the context of therapy! Godric, Malfoy. You don’t go around asking doctors to drop their trousers just because they occasionally make you wear those awful gowns with your arse hanging out!”
bed, but neither one of us is going anywhere," he asserted presumptuously. "Secondly, forgive me, but you're just not very tiger-like. The ferret suits you better--they're pretty and agile and clever. Besides," he added philosophically, dropping back down onto Draco's chest, "rodents are more useful animagi. They and birds are best for reconnaissance."
Draco monopolized the shower head unrepentantly, but Harry didn't mind over much. His showers tended to be brisk and utilitarian anyway. He scrubbed himself from head to foot, dedicating only a tiny fraction of his brain to the task. The rest was entirely focused on Draco.
Fortunately, his voice of reason cut through the burgeoning anxiety to remind him that a prick was a simple thing (unlike, say, a vagina).
"Yes," Draco hissed through gritted teeth. He kept his usual cool commentary to himself, lest he piss the girl off and have the connection closed in his face. "Which is why he's been careful with me."
when he was limited to little more than high-pitched trills and squeaks--the two of them had a hard enough time speaking in the Minister's English.
Can we agree to stop using the word "pining"? It sounds so pathetic. And is no longer relevant, I hope.
He leaned forward in his chair, pinning Malfoy with a significant look, and continued, "You are right that catching him wouldn't eliminate every threat but it would send a message. Every citizen is equal in the eyes of the law: you are entitled to the same basic protections as everyone else, just as your assailant deserves to stand trial for his crime."
"The place where you bit me is sore," he breathed. "Did you mean to mark me, or was it just passion?"
"Come on, Drakey!" Pansy simpered (using the nickname she used to use for him back at school when she thought they were going to be inlove) as she approached the bedroom door from the entrance. "Come down and play! From all the hospital and Ministry rumors I have heard over the years while working with field officers, you enjoy a good threesome. I wonder if you could take two at once?"
He set an unforgiving pace that made Draco's whole body shudder on impact and their bollocks slap together loudly. Pleasure coiled like a snake in his belly, tight and ready to strike.
Draco kissed Harry's cheek tentatively, then gave in to an impulse he might not have if he thought Potter was 100% and nuzzled the side of his face with his pointed nose. It was finally dawning on him that Potter was fairly lucid, at least enough to make Draco believe he wanted him, but the idea of kissing a man who may not have even brushed his teeth that morning due to exhaustion from sickness was just too much to overcome.
"Ah, yes! The holy Savior himself... You know, Draco was a cute number back at Hogwarts. Boring as hell, dumb as an ox, and a spoiled brat to boot but nice to look at. That, and he was so close to the Dark Lord. So, did you stick him yet? Dove into that unused tunnel?"
With a barely concealed grimace, he surveyed the piddly bar offerings. There was nothing there to catch his eye... except perhaps the rather fit (if flamboyant) blond lounging against a nearby pillar. If he weren't stone sober and there in an official capacity he might even consider chatting the bloke up.
were part of his life and always would be. He mirrored Harry's smile at the mention of the baby. "How old is she? Who did she take after? Salazar, I hope she doesn't have a ginger shrub for hair!" That was a topic that actually did spur his attention. He wondered how Harry was with kids. He even thought about asking after his tiny cousin, the rumored ball of energy that was Teddy Lupin ("rumored" because he really didn't know), but it seemed like too big a leap just yet.
Draco nearly sliced his finger. The warm breath on his ear coupled with the tone... Even after all his teasing he never expected Potter to reciprocate. He lifted up a slice of carrot to the Auror's lips in offering.
"Good," Draco uncorked the bottle and lifted it up for Harry to sniff (just as he realized Potter had gone from "Potter" to "Harry" via the magic of fluffy words and a great blow job.) He poured some directly onto the tip of Harry's cock, letting the thick, blue liquid drizzle down the length on its own until it was circling the base of Harry's cock. Draco put the bottle aside on the bedside table and grasped his Gryffindor's cock once again--stroking it languidly.
It is because I love you that I hate to see you all sad and pouty over a scruffy, guileless Gryffindor. It has been particularly pathetic as of late. Just take a stab at a good shag, get him out of your system, and either move on or get on with it.
As the meal heated through it began to appear more edible. The brown goo turned into an almost translucent liquid that coated the vegetables and produced an appealing aroma.
"What I want," Draco began as he moved to hover over the Auror and smile, most evilly, above him, "is something to say 'hands off!' To anyone who might be interested besides me."
"I remember some things from Hogwarts. Like your insane love for Treacle Tart," Draco shook his head out like a dog for a second, further mussing up his once perfect locks. "Mother is in town. I'm staying at the Manor for now until she leaves next week. She wanted to go on a shopping spree and I demanded we go somewhere no one knows us, especially me... So, Russia. She also cut my hair. What do you think?"
The Gryffindor tossed his head back with a strangled cry, his ligaments and muscles taut and straining, the hand in his arse stilling while the one on his cock jerked unsteadily. Ropy strands of come painted the wall and Draco whimpered--his creature brain and human mind clashing fiercely over what he should do.
Harry frowned. He knew the anti-Death Eater sentiment was still strong but he hadn't realized it was bad enough for Malfoy's
"The Rose Room was one of Mother’s favourites," Malfoy explained, intuiting Harry's unspoken question. "It has come to be one of mine, as well." His gaze travelled the room, lingering on one of the paintings wherein a rosy cheeked cherub gave him a friendly grin. "I find its atmosphere more pleasant than much of the rest of the house." The ghost of a smile flickered on his face but it was gone as quickly as it had appeared. "Its location is another mark in its favour," he continued, "as I have moved most of my activities to the ground level of late."
I am sick and tired of his moping. You're single and apparently bi-curious. He's hot and irrevocably (and unfortunately for me) gay. You should do something about this situation. Like writing to him. Or, better yet, shagging him senseless.
Your version of caring comes with a tremendous amount of insults. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Thank you anyway for the soup. It was tasty and helped, like you said (though I'm a little afraid of what I might have just ingested without my knowledge).
The condom stack slowly dwindled as a long string of cocks stepped into the room, used Harry to slake their need, and then left. Draco had only been forced to take action once, when a man had balked at the condition that he had to wear a condom, saying he preferred raw. He had reluctantly agreed to wear a condom, but Draco’s instincts had screamed an alert and he had covertly grabbed the handle of his wand and cast a
“Yeah, but remember, fortune favours the brave,” Harry said, flashing back to Draco’s provocative words, the dare that fortified Harry’s nerve and won him a night of the best sex he’d ever had. The first of hopefully many more.
Harry cut Hermione off, “Thank you, sir. We’ll do that.” Kingsley gave Hermione an amused look and nodded his head before heading off towards his office. Hermione looked like she was about to protest that there was still too much work to do so Harry decided to forestall her. Circling around to behind Hermione, Harry placed his hands on his shoulders and began steering her out of the conference room and over to their desks. “Call Ron and have him drop the baby off with Molly and then meet us at The Hog’s Head. It’s time for some exercise!”
. Draco was making no move at all to prepare for their morning full of potion brewing and was lazily spinning a quill around in a circle inside the quill pot in front of him.
“Damn...that was amazing,” Draco panted, resting his forehead against Harry’s shoulder as he tried to catch his breath, small ripples of ejaculate still shooting out of his cock as he came down from his high.
Harry looked down at the jumbled mess of ingredients that he’d dropped haphazardly on the bench. “Oh, um… we’re just getting started now.”
Harry decided to be the bigger man and just sighed before grabbing his textbook and heading over to the ingredients cabinet to wait in line for his turn. He was so busy studying the list of ingredients to make sure he didn’t forget anything that he didn’t notice what was happening over at his bench.
“Scoot forward,” Albus barked the order as he yanked the magazine out of Scorpius’s hands and dropped it on the lounge chair he had just vacated. When Scorpius didn’t move, Albus smacked his back lightly a few times until Scorpius reluctantly slid forward, making room for Albus to slide in between his back and the backrest of the chair. “I’m going to make sure every inch of this porcelain skin is slathered with sunblock and then you and I are going for a swim.”
Harry ran his hand down the outside of the other man’s thigh before slipping it up between the closed legs, casting a wandless lubrication spell. Shifting closer, Harry slipped his cock through the thick pads of flesh, enjoying the filthy squelching sounds as his thrusts sped up. Harry’s thick fingers dug into the hipbone as his cock slipped in and out between the other man’s legs.
Harry felt the fog of lust start to lift as Draco’s concern began to register. “Just before I went downstairs to meet you at the bar, so...around 9? Why?” Harry asked, pushing himself up so he was leaning on his elbows.
“Earth to Scorpius!” Scorpius jolted to attention when he realized that Albus was trying to get his attention.
“I love you, Draco,” Harry said softly, the switch back to his name signalling that Harry was back from that space in his mind that he went to when they played like this.
“TEXT ME IF YOU NEED A REFRESHER ON HOW TO PUT ON A CONDOM!” A burst of laughter erupted behind them and Harry cast a look around to see a few of the pub patrons eyeing the two of them with a mixture of quizzical, amused and judgmental looks.
“That doesn’t seem too bad?” Harry asked uncertainly. “It’s not like we expected the campaign’s effectiveness to continue on exponentially. We knew it would slow down eventually.”
As the man crossed over to the bed and eyed Harry’s proffered hole, Draco shared the conditions, “Sucking and fucking him are both fine, but he stays in this position and you have to use a condom, which we have been kind enough to supply.” Draco gestured to the multiple purple foils scattered on Harry’s back. Draco could just make out the small field of goose pimples across Harry’s back that had arisen in anticipation. “And once you’re done, tie off the condom and drop it in this bowl over here.” Draco gestured over to a wide-mouthed porcelain bowl sitting on the table beside him.
“I also work in advertising,” Harry explained, earning a look of surprise from Draco. “In fact, we just launched a big new campaign a few months ago.”
“Good boy. Daddy’s not going to give you a cock ring to help you with that, so you’re going to have to be a very good boy and control yourself.” Harry bit his lip nervously as he panted softly. “If you’re a good boy for Daddy, I’ll take you home after and give you a nice reward. How does that sound?”
Draco stopped walking and whirled around to face Harry. Holding up his hand in greeting, he said, “Draco Malfoy, pleased to make your acquaintance.”
Looking disappointed, the man refastened his trousers and let himself out of the room, the lineup outside having dispersed since he entered.
“Come inside me. Fill me up,” Harry begged and that was all Draco needed, his orgasm crashing over him as he emptied himself deep inside Harry’s body. Draco may be Harry’s ‘daddy’, but he was under Harry’s thrall just as much as Harry was under his.
“No, no, it’s not that.” At Draco’s expression, Harry rushed to assure him, “I mean, you were, but that’s not why I’m here.” Draco looked slightly mollified by Harry’s reassertion of his skills in the bedroom.
Harry took a seat at one end of the long bar and flagged the bartender down, ordering a beer. When the cold beverage was placed in front of him, he took three deep pulls of the hoppy beverage before casting his eyes around the room. They were snagged immediately and hopelessly on the slim, blond man at the far end of the bar who was exuding an air of confidence Harry could sense even from across the room as he slowly twirled the giant ice cube in his glass with one long, elegant finger. The low murmur of the bar bled away and Harry felt like he could feel each icy clink of the cube hitting the glass resonate through him as if they were drum beats.
He wasn't quite ready to reciprocate in kind, but he was eager for the feel of Draco in his hand. He snuck his left under Draco's jumper to stroke his leanly muscled back and brushed the other along Draco's thigh to cup his package, kissing all the while.
It was perfectly Slytherin, really, to lure an old rival through a maze of potentially-lethal plants. Especially if that Slytherin was a one-time Death Eater and said old rival was the Saviour. That didn't mean it hurt any less, though. Draco had hoped those labels didn't influence them any longer, but apparently they still did. For Harry, at least.
He sent a patronus to Savage requesting an investigative and containment crew come to the restaurant post haste. He then marched to the back of the house demanding to see management. Amidst gawking patrons, a harried-looking wizard with an absurd pencil mustache rushed out to meet them.
Draco grinned. Why the woman had been sorted Gryffindor over Ravenclaw remained a mystery, but he trilled twice nonetheless.
"I certainly am," Harry retorted smartly, having found his voice at last. "But unlike you, none of the rubbish they print about
"Gimme a heads up next time, yeah?" he frowned, battling against the vertigo of unexpected apparation.
, for Godrick's sake, so what was it about Malfoy's snide tone that froze his feet to the ground as if spelled and made him turn back around, degree by begrudging degree, almost against his will?
"I've finally figured out how you managed to defeat the Dark Lord," Malfoy remarked, apropos of nothing.
Anyway, so right after the war I went to the nearest pub I could find to get absolutely shitfaced--disguised, of course. Everyone was celebrating, but I was mourning. I didn't have much time for it before then, you realise. A German man approached me who looked scarily like a young Sirius and I decided to go home with him. Never saw him again. He had no clue who I really was, but I knew then why it always made me uncomfortable when a bird looked at me with lust in her eyes and why I was always breathless when Sirius looked at me with so much love--platonic, mind--or happiness.)
"Professor McGonagall," Harry said. "There was nothing you could've done. This all happened because I was an idiot."
"Take a seat, Harry," he said, gesturing next to the seat next to Draco. Harry complied, and his worry deepened as he saw the blond's pale face.
"That is the same thing I've been told that for years! 'You won't be able to complete your education, darling, you're not well enough' and 'are you sure you're up for marriage'?"
Harry shook his head numbly. "No. I don't think so. I can't remember much from when I was younger. It's not something I like to remember."
"Anyways," Hermione cut in, her eyes gleaming. "We've come to take you two over to eighth year's little corner. We're going to play Spin the Bottle!"
"Bye!" Hermione said to the two boys as they parted ways, her warm smile lingering over Draco for a little longer than he found comfortable.
"Because I'm the fucking Boy Who Lived, that's how," Harry growled, crouching down and looking at her with disgust. He punched her, causing her to fall back, blood spurting out of her nose.
”I wanted to know if you were single to see if I still had a chance with you,” Malloy said, grinning. “And I do.”
Malloy shrugged delicately, his face betraying no emotion. “I just wanted to know if you guys were still dating.”
"I understand, Weasley," Draco said honestly. "I didn't want to accept my love for Harry either. But seeing him kissing you-"
Harry woke again to bright light pouring in through the large window and banging on the portrait outside. Sitting up, he tugged on his boyfriend's arm.
Harry frowned and turned over in his bed. He cast a silencing charm around his bed; he didn't need his housemates to think Harry was crazier than he already was.
The two worked on their cases and went about their business as usual. As if there had never been a kiss. It made Harry feel dark inside that Draco would forget.
Harry thought for a moment. What did he really want? He could say no and walk away from the chance to cure whatever's wrong with him and die anyway: or he could say yes and finally be free of the wretched disease.
Harry gasped as Malfoy edged a bit closer and wrapped a cautious arm around his waist. "Don't you have anything to help you?"
Ron, Hermione, and Ginny had come to the Hospital Wing immediately when they had heard the news. Hermione hadn't left Harry's bedside, and neither had Draco, and Ginny was sniffling as if she had a bad cold.
Draco knocked on the door lightly, standing back to wait for it to open. Harry studied the house beside him with avid interest.
"Here! Look! I got Professor McGonagall to allow me into the restricted section and I found this!" she said eagerly. Harry leaned over Draco's plate and inspected the book.
Harry blushed and said the password, and the gargoyles swung to the side, revealing the narrow staircase.
"There's this voice... inside my head," Harry confessed. "It's making me restless, Draco. I can't- I can't go through one day without it tormenting me."
"Thank God Neville was there. But who pushed Harry?" Ron asked, staring at Harry's pale face, which shone in the morning light. Draco sighed.
"What makes you think that?" Harry asked defensively, covering the item in question with his hand while staring at the two with suspicious eyes.
"See, I recall differently," Draco said, leaning against the doorway and admired how Ron's ears turned as red as his hair.
Malfoy rolled his eyes once again, drinking his coffee nevertheless. Harry frowned and groaned loudly.
"Because I'm in love with someone who played me and tossed me aside like some broken toy," Ron's voice quietened, his pride dissipating rapidly. "I didn't want to admit it. I didn't. But you can't help you love. No matter how much they hurt you."
"And you didn't tell us this because it would make her a liable suspect," Draco guessed. Rob nodded.
Harry grumbled silently before standing up and slowly walking up the stairs, typing in a reluctant reply.
“What if he actually does leave me, ‘Mione?” Harry sobbed into his friend’s shoulder. Hermione sighed and resumed stroking his hair.
"Don't worry, mate. I won't tell a soul. I'm super supportive of the LGBT stuff!" Neville chirped happily. Harry looked up.
He returned with some bandages, and Harry tried with all his might to restrain his heart from flipping.
"Tell me about it," Harry responded sadly. The two boys sighed in unison, and Harry became alarmed when Ron started to sob. He began to pat the ginger's back awkwardly and gasped when he was pulled in for a hug.
They stood there for a few minutes until Malfoy sighed. "Can't you even remember what the password was about?"
"Calm down, Harry," Draco sighed, clamping a hand over the brunet's mouth. "Don't waste your time on Thomas."
Harry swallowed it, his eyes fluttering closed. Madam Pomfrey looked at Draco with eyes filled with wonder.
"It was a mistake letting any of them on the team," Draco snorted. "But I guess you can make an exception for Russo."
Malfoy swept away from the room, leaving Harry hurt and confused. Harry stowed his hands away inside his pocket and left the room, trying to ignore the feeling of rejection crawling under his skin.
The man in her arms sobbed and writhed in her steel grip but to no avail. Unconsciously, Harry took a step forward with both hands held out. Draco grabbed at his arm.
"I think I'm going to throw up!" Harry exclaimed. Ron rolled his eyes a little. Next to him, Hermione couldn't tell if she wanted to feel jealous or amused. But she knew the boys had no feelings for each other.
"I haven't got ten galleons on me right now, Ron. And why-" Hermione flushed and turned to Harry. "You mean it's true?"
”No, Harry. You’ve saved so many lives. Including mine and Pansy’s. When you spoke at her trial, she saw you in a different light. She idolises you! She is grateful to you in ways you can’t imagine, and so are countless other people!” Malfoy exclaimed.
Draco fell off the bed in shock, and Harry stared at the blushing Pansy with a sheepish expression. She had a piece of parchment grasped in her hand, and she handed it to Harry.
"And since when are you the one giving orders, Potter?" Malfoy smirked, cocking an eyebrow. Harry stuck his tongue out at him.
"No one so far, seeing as we only got given this case a few days ago," Draco said, glaring him down.
Harry had wandered over to the window and was now leaning out, his arms flailing around as if he was a drowning man.
"I came to give you a Sleeping Potion. Try and get some rest, Harry. You lost a lot of blood. You're going to need more than one day to heal." she pushed the vial into Harry's hands, and for once, he didn't argue with her. He downed the vial and passed it back to her.
"I loved Lola. It was the child I didn't love. I don't regret leaving her, although I regret not being there for her when she died," Henley said, looking at Harry with ill-concealed shame in his eyes. Harry gave him an encouraging smile.
"Alright, thank you," he said. The two partners were halfway through the door when Molly's voice called.
"I saw him leave the dorm, so I followed him, and I came down here. I saw him fall, so I cast the slowing charm. He slowed down a little maybe he'll be alright," Neville said anxiously, putting a hand on Draco's shoulder as they all but sprinted to the castle.
The next day passed slowly. Harry spent most of it avoiding his boyfriend and wondering what he would find out on the Astronomy Tower. The smarter, logical part of him wondered why she would want to meet there. The scared part of him wanted to make sure that it was her letter, but the determined side of him needed midnight to come as soon as possible.
"Who would've thought," Malfoy mused. "The Great Saviour has not only offered me his hand in friendship but an apology too."
“Why would I ever leave you?” Harry asked, wrapping his arms loosely around Draco’s neck. “You’re the love of my life. And I- I trust you. With my whole being. I promise.”
"So we can study the contents further, of course," Malfoy said lazily. Henley snatched the letter from Harry and looked down at it, scanning the contents.
"Because now I know what I want," Draco said, leaning down and capturing Harry's lips in a kiss. Something tightened in his stomach, and all he could think was
"I think you've forgotten that we're wizards, Malfoy," Harry said, rolling his eyes. "And save the theatrics for your father."
"You two were talking about me?" Hermione said, looking suspicious. Harry could have sworn he saw hope in her eyes.
"Harry! So glad to see you're awake!" he heard the familiar voice of the Headmistress call out. The curtains around his bed were pulled back to reveal her and Slughorn looking wary but cheerful.
Molly shook her head. It unnerved Harry how empty her eyes looked. "My mother was a good woman. Even though she was a Squib."
"You're a... special case, Potter," Draco had said. Harry tried to ignore the butterflies fluttering in his stomach at those words.
"Not your fault," Harry said, wincing a little as he reached up slowly to touch Draco's cheek. "It'll be... fine... Wing."
"Ah, fuck!" Harry bolted out of the room, leaving Draco standing there with flushed cheeks and eyes as big saucers.
Harry laughed at that. He doubled over in his chair and thumped his fist on the desk as rapturous laughter consumed him. "
"One person will drink the potion, and the other will ask them three questions, to which the drinker will have to answer truthfully! Please make a record of the questions asked and the answers given for me to look at later!" Slughorn beamed.
As soon as they were in the corridor, Harry exploded. "Malfoy, what are we going to do? I can't stand six seconds with you, let alone over six months!"
, in the past," she said and swung her arms around maniacally, obviously thinking it represented their relationship. Harry thought it was pretty spot on.
The offer sounded tempting, but Harry wasn't about to fall for another one of Draco's games again and be forgotten about and ignored.
For some reason the time sight of the blond made Harry cry even harder, and Draco immediately took Harry into his arms, whispering soothingly into his ear.
"What was that?" he said, sounding slightly out of breath. "It was like the worst mood swing in my life!"
Harry and Draco broke apart and narrowed their eyes at Smith, who was walking up the staircase with ease. He smirked at them.
Harry gestured for her to carry on. She flicked through pages quickly before stopping somewhere in the middle. "There."
"Did you have to be so rude to him?" he asked the blond. Malfoy snorted, leaning back in his chair slightly.
"Unless you think I had a business meeting with myself, I think you know the answer to that question," Henley growled. Something snapped inside Harry.
"Time to man up, mate," Harry said. He grabbed Ron's shoulders and pulled him in for a kiss. Ron stiffened in his arms but returned the kiss nevertheless.
"You look good in everything, Draco," Harry said, leaning up to kiss him. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and tilted his head slightly, deepening the kiss. Someone moaned, and Harry's hands traveled up into Draco's hair and tugged.
Ron shook his head. "Was she ever going to tell me? What was I, her boy toy? All those months, did they really mean nothing to her?"
Draco took a hint and left him alone to clean everything up. All the while, Harry couldn't help but smile. Five years ago he was a man with no purpose other than to be the Ministry's poster-boy. And now he was a man with a loving husband and a job he loved.
"You're pathetic," Harry said to Smith. The Hufflepuff swung his fist around and collided it with Harry's shoulder, making him lose his balance. The two tumbled down the stairs as Draco watched in horror.
"We're going to put you in one of the holding cells for a day while we search your actual house, then. We've already taken your wand, and they should be going over it right now," Malfoy said. Jemma gaped at him and looked at the brunet standing beside him for help.
"Go get help, you fucking idiot!" Draco yelled. Smith flinched but ran into the Great Hall at lightning speed. The doors clanged shut behind him. Blood seeped into Draco's robes and through his fingers, and Harry's eyes fluttered.
Ron looked as if he were about to disagree but nodded eagerly when Hermione leaned in and whispered what sounded suspiciously like
Harry sighed, and turned to Malfoy with a dramatic eye-roll. "Come on then, your Majesty, I'm not going to wait all day!"
Harry and Ron were in the boys' dormitories, and Harry was trying desperately to get Ron to reconcile with Hermione.
"GO AFTER HIM! GET IT BACK!" he yelled himself hoarse, but he wasn't the only one. Countless Gryffindors leaped up from their seats and gave them a piece of their minds. The Chasers sheepishly zoomed after Smith, determined to gain their dignity back.
She obliged, and they gathered around the silver basin. They plunged in and sunk into Harry's memories.
The matron nodded her head understandingly and conjured a clipboard, scribbling down notes with a pen at lighting speed. "It may be possible that your brain has repressed the unpleasant memories of your childhood."
Harry flicked through it with a disinterested air. It was most likely another rogue Death Eater that wanted to start an uprising.
It was large, and Harry could tell the inhabitants were well-off. The door creaked open a little, and a pair of teary eyes and a watery smile met them.
Neville chuckled before going back to his half-eaten breakfast with his mind whirring, trying to figure what the pair couldn've possibly argued over.
"The Headmistress wants to see you," he said. "You're being expelled. You're going to stand a trial as well, seeing how you fucking tried to murder me."
"Draco Malfoy, he'll be an idiot to say no," she reassured him. When Draco didn't smile, she sat him down on the couch. "Don't worry, he'll say yes. And then you two can have dozens of children!"
"Yeah, try to kill me now!" Harry said, his eyes shimmering. Draco was helping him now; he could get through anything.
Draco sat in the near-empty Great Hall with a stoic expression, picking at his food moodily. The Christmas holidays had started, and Draco had stayed at Hogwarts, along with Hermione. She was visiting him, and the thought of her alone with Harry's helpless body made his blood boil.
He ran into the Wing and saw Madam Pomfrey standing by Harry's bed with a panicked expression on her face. Harry's clothes were soaked in blood by his abdomen, making Draco suck in a pained gasp.
Harry opened his mouth in outrage, but Professor Flitwick interrupted him. "That's quite a kind deed, Harry, but I'm afraid Mr. Malfoy will have to write up his own notes."
"Are you alright? You idiot, what were you thinking?" Draco exclaimed, looking over Harry's body for any injuries.
"He was an employee at the Ministry in the Department of Mysteries," Hermione explained. Draco scrunched his face up a little.
Draco abandoned his position from in front of the door and knelt in front of Harry's shaking body. He took his face in his hands and looked deeply into his eyes.
All three of them jumped at the sound of Neville, and they looked over to where he stood in the doorway. Harry hid his head in Ginny's shoulder and groaned.
"Look at what he's done to you, Harry," Sirius said, placing a hand on the boy's shoulder. "He never loved you. No one does this to ones they love."
"I'm sorry, Harry, but only the caster of the spell can turn it back!" she said,  her eyes widening in anguish as she stared at her friend falling apart. She turned to Malfoy and grasped his arm. "Please, turn it back!" she pleaded.
He nodded minutely without looking at her, taking the bowl. Pansy went to the supply cupboard to get her ingredients when Malfoy suddenly spoke again.
A light blush appeared on Draco's cheeks. "I'm a death eater, Harry. I'm not good enough for the Golden Boy."
"Oh God, you really are a Slytherin," Draco sighed. "And you look like my own personal devil with that tie on."
"Yes, now go back to sleep," he said, kissing Harry on the nose endearingly. Harry complied, his eyes slowly sliding shut.
Harry tilted his head back and let the cold liquid rush down his throat. He slammed the cup back on the table.
"I'm here! Look!" Malfoy's voice called out. Harry looked and there was a door exiting the living room and into another room. Harry ran into it and covered his nose with his hands with a shudder. Malfoy was crouched down by the floor next to a pale body.
"Yes. Yes, we did," Harry said. "It's a Saturday. I'll be damned if I go to Ministry on a Saturday."
"I think he'll be okay for now," Madame Pomfrey said, rushing around the room frantically as she looked after the other patients.
"This is ridiculous now," Harry snorted. "You'd think they'd have let this up now after five years."
"I was at a business meeting. Don't you fools check this sort of thing?" Henley asked, narrowing his eyes.
"You were bound to find out anyway," she said, huffing a deep breath as she went to go lean her side on the sink.
"We've already injected the antidote into both of your systems, and we'll leave the choice up to you, Harry," McGonagall said.
Harry sighed, looking at Draco. The veela was looking away from him pointedly. He had already drained his cup.
"Hermione, what if he says no?" Draco stressed, pacing the room nervously. The bushy-haired girl stopped him and rested her hands on his shoulders.
"I'm so sorry, I never meant for you to die," he sobbed, tears slipping out of his eyes. Sirius scoffed, pulling away.
"No, Harry," the blond sighed. "It's just... hiding our relationship is going to be a little harder than I thought."
How long has Draco known he was a Veela? Which side had his inheritance come from? Was it both sides? Were the Malfoys a long line of Veelas all along? Would Draco get a mate? Who would it be?
"My life is in shambles because of people who were supposed to love me!" Molly cried. "Let me have peace again by killing them off!"
Ron visibly shut down at the mention of the war. Hermione realised her mistake a moment later and bit her lip regretfully.
"For fuck's sake, Potter. It's not much to wrap your head around. Isn't your friend married to one?" Draco said, snarling.
"Potter," he said ashamedly. "I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to drug you. I'd never want to do that to anyone, I swear."
”Why did everything have to end up like this?” Harry sobbed into Malfoy’s robes. “Why do I hurt everyone? I- even you! It’s like I can’t even help it anymore-“
"I want Draco," she said, stepping closer to Harry, making him step back. Soon, she had him backed up against the wall. "And you're stopping me from having him."
"Ah, Harry!" Madam Pomfrey said, hurrying inside. Draco snatched his hand away and Harry felt his face burn. The matron smiled softly.
"Nice office you have here, Potter. I bet it's one of the many perks of being the Chosen One," he taunted. "Unfortunately, being a mere mortal, I had to work to get my own office."
"How are you feeling, Harry?" the matron asked, coming forward with a blood-replacing potion, which he eagerly drank. "You lost a lot of blood there."
Malfoy chuckled, and the deep sound sent shivers down Harry's spine. "Honestly, Potter, do you even know what to do?"
Hermione gave him a reluctant smile. "I know, and I'm sorry. But Robards has very high hopes for you two! Don't let him down."
Malfoy put a comforting hand on Harry's shoulder, and the brunet relaxed. Malfoy sent a snarl towards the man sitting behind the table. Rob hesitated a little before sighing resignedly and taking the vial. He downed the contents and his eyes cleared.
Molly's eyes flashed with an unknown emotion. She quickly recovered and growled like an animal. Harry took this as an opportunity, pulling out his wand and effortlessly Stunning the woman. He looked down at the hawthorn wand in his hand with a smile.
Draco opened his mouth to lie but thought better of it. Of course, he wanted Harry to himself! Was that so wrong? To be jealous?
"You can't lock me up because of some guesswork," the blonde lady chuckled from where she lay on the hospital bed. "You need solid evidence. You don't have any proof that I did either."
"Sure it was only the unicorn horn, Malfoy?" Harry said snidely as they turned a corner and headed towards their classroom.
"So you could go there and give him the Prophecy," Draco mused, his gaze on Harry softening a bit as he saw the tears streak down the embarrassed boy's face.
He screamed out when he saw a knife protruding from his abdomen. It stung, and Harry tried to move his arm so he could pull it out, but his arm wouldn't move. Paralyzed and anxious, he shrieked and called out, but no one heard. His cries faded into the distance, the darkness absorbing them like water.
Harry's mouth hung open, and she stared at him in pity. "I know. Mother had the same reaction. She beat me so much that time, saying I had ruined my life. I was worried she might kill the poor things."
”Jealousy?” Harry threw his head back and laughed, immediately getting up from his position on the couch. “Who the fuck said anything about jealousy? I’m not jealous! In fact, I don’t give a shit anymore! Go over to Peter and see if I care!”
The kiss was the most exciting thing he had ever experienced. Draco tasted of green apples and coffee. Harry's hand grasped the blond's platinum locks while Draco made his claim on Harry's waist.
Draco and Harry glanced at each other, and stood up, following Professor Sprout out of the classroom.
Harry walked back to their room with Draco in anticipation. Draco emitted a deadly aura, and his eyes had not changed from their gilded color. Harry would be lying if he said he wasn't a little excited for what the blond was going to do.
"Thanks," he said, inhaling sharply, staring pointedly at Draco's hand on his shoulder. Malfoy ripped it away.
"Of course not," Malfoy sneered in retaliation, his blonde locks swaying slightly in front of mercury eyes.
"You're as good as," Harry laughed, grabbing her arm and pulling her up. "I suggest you pack your things early, she's only going to give you an hour before you get on that train."
Draco squeezed his eyes shut in regret. "I didn't get to see them. I fell off the bed before I could. And I can't remember the voice."
For those who really don't want to wait, I wanted to let you know that this fanfiction's completed version can be found on Wattpad under m-blackhart
Harry sniffled slightly and nodded into the blond's chest. Draco's heart was beating faster than a hummingbird. It thrilled Harry.
”Nothing I didn’t ask for,” Harry said quickly. The last thing he wanted was for Ron and Draco to fight. Again.
She got up and walked up the stairs. Harry and Draco exchanged a glance. This was a weirder case than they thought.
"Potter, whatever sick joke you're playing, it isn't funny. Wake up, please!" Smith pleaded. Draco shoved him out of the way and hoisted Harry's head into his lap.
"Come on! There have to be other people with intentions of hurting Harry!" Ginny said exasperatedly, coming back from where she was pacing in front of the window. She had tear tracks on her cheeks, and she wiped at them, flushing.
They were in the library, and Harry was trailing after a determined Hermione. Draco followed sluggishly behind him.
"Harry, I need to go to our room, come on," Draco said a little later, and Harry got up with a sigh.
"She's supposedly killing everyone who wronged her right? Maybe she went to her ex-partner, Dylan. It says here the two were married for seven years before Dylan found out about Molly's powers," Malfoy said.
"No, we won't!" Hermione cried. "Harry is the foundation of our friendships! He's the glue that sticks us together! How will we do this without him?"
Draco groaned from next to him. "For fuck's sake, Potter! You make that face and expect me to say no?"
"Then drink up," he said warningly. Rob shook his head defiantly. "Rob, this is a matter of life and fucking death. DRINK THE DAMN POTION."
"Ah, boys," Professor McGonagall said as they entered her office. "I'm glad you chose to accept the offer to retrieve your memories, Harry."
Harry shook his head and took her face in his hands. "You're not just another girl, Hermione. You're important to me. Maybe not in the way you want, but I know that I can't live without you."
"You better be ready to not walk tomorrow," the Veela teased, his hands already pulling off Harry's shirt.
"I'm guessing you aren't planning on giving him the address?" Harry guessed. Molly shook her head with glistening eyes.
"I sent her a letter a few weeks ago," Henley said, looking a little sad. "She even responded. I wanted to reconcile before we died, but I guess we lost that chance."
"Hey, Draco," he said into the kisses. He heard a sigh come from somewhere else in the room, but all that mattered at that moment was Draco.
Afternoon light shone through the open window, and Harry was going over Molly's details. Suddenly, Ron Weasley ran through the open door and clutched at Harry's arm, pulling him from his seat.
"She's a squib! The Killing Curse killed her. She couldn't have cast the spell," Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. "And did we have to come here to discuss the contents of the letter?" he asked, gesturing wildly to the cafe where they sat. Harry narrowed his eyes and took a sip of his coffee.
"He made the right choice, being with you," she said, running a loving hand through Harry's hair. She looked at Draco, an unreadable air surrounding her.
Hermione was his best friend! His sister! The thought of liking her like that made him internally gag. What did she even see in him? And what about Ron?
Malfoy snarled. "Well, Potter, I suggest you suck it up. This is your fault, after all," he said, looking pointedly at the bandages on Harry's hand.
"It'll look suspicious if I sat with you. I'll sit at my own table," Draco said. Before Harry could protest, the blond was already drifting towards the Slytherin table. Harry pouted.
The two nodded. Harry felt cold inside. He had only known the bloke for a few days, but still. Henley was harmless. He hadn't done anyone any wrong.
"Everyone makes mistakes when they're in love!" Pansy said feebly, obviously trying to justify her actions. Harry narrowed his eyes.
Harry continued to pull him down the corridor towards their room. Once they were inside, Harry let go of Draco's arm and plopped himself onto the bed. The blond rubbed his abused arm with one hand while glaring at Harry.
"It was the anger charm," Hermione said simply, before giving Malfoy a sheet of paper. "Here, these are the incantations. You have to give a little flourish of your wand and speak loud and clearly."
They entered the Hall and sat next to each other. No one batted an eye. The story about their bond had gotten dull over the weeks, and the school had already moved onto the next hot topic.
"He was just checking in on me, like a normal friend. What's the big deal?" Draco said incredulously, sitting down next to Harry on the couch.
Draco sprinted down the staircase to see Harry lying in front of the entrance to the Hall, blood oozing out from underneath his head. He had broken Smith's fall, who looked pale and wan as he tried to revive Harry.
"Turns out it was Voldemort trying to get the Prophecy through me. He couldn't go to the Ministry himself, and I was the only one who could get it. So he..." Harry's eyes started to well with the tears he was never able to shed. "He sent me a vision, on the day of our last exam that year, of Sirius getting tortured in the Department of Mysteries."
"It feels wonderful, Smith, truly," Draco answered. "But how does it feel being captain of the worst House team Hogwarts has ever seen? Your seeker lost to a first-year."
"You've been asleep for twelve hours, give or take," Malfoy said thoughtfully. "I don't know exactly."
"We'll tell you later, please, hurry!" Draco shrieked. Madam Pomfrey took the brunet in her arms and quickly laid him down on the bed, frantically searching through drawers for blood-replacing potions. She found one and shoved it down his throat.
The two had moved into Grimmauld Place together a few months ago, and to say it was a challenge to live together would be an understatement.
"Ron and Hermione have invited us over for dinner tomorrow, by the way," Draco told him. Harry hummed, turning around in his lover's arms.
"What?" the Slytherin said, backing up slightly. Their spells faded away, and Harry grinned manically.
Harry was getting impatient. "Just because I was most affected means I'm crazy, does it?" Harry snarled. Draco's eyes widened slightly.
Malfoy scowled at the phone screen. "This isn't something we can talk about over the phone. It's is very urgent, so please hand the phone over to Tobias."
"Harry, it's a new partner, not a new Department!" Hermione scolded him, taking a seat in front of his desk and dropping the file onto the wooden surface. "You have to pull it together!"
Harry turned around in his arms. "You have to promise to not let me make an idiot of myself while we're there." he held out his pinky.
"I'm counting on you, Malfoy, to keep an eye on him," she eyed Draco. He looked sideways at Harry uncertainly. The old witch barely stifled her laugh.
Harry groaned internally. "Sorry to break this up, but this isn't why we're here. We're here to look for anyone with motives. Molly, you're completely sure no one disliked your mother?"
"Professor Slughorn is working on the antidote as we speak, but it will take at least six months before it will be complete. I'm sorry, boys." The two of them groaned, imagining the horrific six months that awaited them.
"How about I go first, boys?" Hermione suggested. They shrugged, their eyes leaving the other's face.
The gargoyles stepped aside, and the staircase leading to the Headmistress' appeared. The boys hurriedly walked behind Professor Sprout, and she rapped lightly on the door.
"Why would she kill her mother? The woman had done her no harm, and Molly had openly praised her. She told us she hated her father, but not her mother. Isn't that a little odd?" Harry asked. Draco's brows furrowed.
"The husband hasn't seen her in thirty-five years. I doubt we'll get anything off him," Harry pointed out. Malfoy frowned.
Harry woke up on a dark surface. He was all alone. Blood coated his body like a layer of skin, and his body shook in pain.
"Sewing club?" Draco said, unconvinced. Surely, a huge, masculine man Rob didn't do knitting, for God's sake.
They traveled along the corridor to the room in awkward silence. As soon as they entered, Draco ushered Harry and locked the door behind them.
”I’m so sorry you couldn’t work with us, mate,” Ron said sympathetically. “I couldn’t imagine having to work with them two!”
Malfoy was shocked. Harry... wanted to be free? Was he trapped? Draco shook his head and held the brunet tighter against his chest as the students inside were filed out of the room. He was talking to a boy on a high. He wasn't in his right mind.
"Ah, that was Draco's doing. I was going to go after you the minute you left," Harry admitted sheepishly.
"Come on, Molly. Let's go inside. Just you and me," he said, taking his wand out of his pocket and dropping it onto the ground. Molly's anger faltered, and she nodded slowly.
”No! I should never have used a spell on you when I didn’t know what it did! I knew it could only be sinister, and I used it anyway! I’m so stupid!”
Malfoy leaned forward and connected their lips, and it was ecstasy. They fit together perfectly, moving against each other like the moon and the tide. Harry felt his heart catch in his throat. When they parted for breath, they grinned.
They clasped each other's hand and walked over to the entrance. The two could feel every eye on them as they walked into the room. Harry's breath quickened.
"Well, Professor? What do you think is wrong with him?" Draco asked, unconsciously slinging an arm around Harry and pulling him close.
"He'll probably forget about it, mate," Ron said consolingly. He gave Hermione a look which Harry interpreted as
Harry's eyes slid open, and he looked at the faces above him. Draco and Madame Pomfrey were watching him with looks of anticipation.
"Well, Professor," Harry spoke up. "Seeing I have most of these symptoms, I think it's very likely."
Harry nodded meekly into the wooden desk, and Hermione took it as a dismissal. "I'll see you, Harry." and she left.
The Hufflepuff spun around idiotically. Harry whooped as he saw the Gryffindor Seeker, a short blond boy named Russo, speeding after the small ball.
Harry felt a warm sensation spread through his chest like a drug, taking away all his negative feelings. He relished in it.
"Agh, my head," Harry moaned. His vision came into focus as he sat up slowly, looking around. Draco's head was resting on his lap, his legs dangling off the edge of the bed as he lay horizontally.
, he thought. "Did Lola ever do anything to Molly? Do you think Molly might have had a vendetta against Lola?"
Malfoy laughed, his own eyes threatening to overflow with tears. Malfoy sighed and merely turned away from Harry.
"Boys!" Professor Flitwick said enthusiastically. "It seems that you have missed the instructions for today's lesson! Why don't you two join Miss Granger so she may explain it to you?"
”Being my boyfriend doesn’t mean you control the ins and outs of my life, Potter,” Draco replied coolly. Harry flinched; Draco never called him Potter unless he was really mad.
"I know. It feels like it was only yesterday that we got bonded together!" Harry whispered in awe. Draco nodded, turning on his side to face his boyfriend.
"Your mother was, uh, killed in her sleep by the Killing Curse on the fifth of July," Harry recited. "Do you know anyone who would have a motive for doing this?"
"I don't think you've noticed, Henley, but someone has murdered your ex-wife. You can cooperate, or we can take you into the Ministry. Your choice," he said, his voice cold and hard. Henley looked conflicted but eventually slumped a little in his seat, his stone mask slipping off his face. He looked like a broken man.
Harry made to flee the room before remembering Malfoy, who sat on the other bed with an air of annoyance. "Forget about me, Potter?"
"Because the supposed-murderer will definitely open the door to Aurors," Harry said sarcastically. Malfoy stuck his tongue out at him childishly and narrowed his eyes at the door.
“Sorry I’m late,” Harry panted, walking into the classroom looking mildly ashamed. He saw everyone was working in groups of threes.
Harry squeezed his eyes tight shut and tried to relax his muscles. He tried to ignore the butterflies that fluttered in his stomach at Draco's comforting hand on his shoulder.
Molly gasped, scandalized. "Excuse me, Mr. Malfoy, but it appears to me you're saying that because I'm a single woman, I am unable to provide for myself?"
"Harry!" Madame Pomfrey said enthusiastically. She was carrying a dark vial, which she handed to him cautiously. "This is the hangover potion. Be careful not to spill it!"
Harry sat tentatively on the edge of the double bed. It had been awkward enough, changing in the same room and having to be in the bathroom at the same time, but sleeping together?
"You're only questioning me because of my earlier sentence! That's over! That was a different part of me!" Rob exclaimed, bringing his fist down on the table. Harry winced.
He locked himself in a stall and proceeded to cry his jolly heart out. His breathing quickened and his vision blurred, and he sagged against the wall. The edges of his vision started to blacken and swallow him into a warm hole of nothingness when-
Harry smirked and nodded, and the two made their way out of the office and towards the Ministry entrance.
"Draco," Harry drawled, giggling at the sound of the blond's name on his tongue. Draco smiled affectionately and took Harry out of the classroom and towards the Medical Wing, despite Hermione's protests.
"I'm sorry, Jemma, but this is how it needs to go," he said. Frustrated tears filled the woman's eyes.
"Speak of this to no one," he hissed, before walking away. Pansy looked at Harry with parted lips, her eyes like balloons.
Harry screamed, and Draco comforted him through tears. "I'm here now, baby. It's going to be alright. I'm so sorry-"
"Harry, red really isn't my color," Draco pouted. They were in the corridor by the Great Hall, and Draco was eying his red tie with malice.
Harry thought for a moment. "Well... it was a name, I think." And that was how the guessing spree began.
He hid under his cloak as he traveled up the narrow staircase and pushed open the door. There was a silhouette standing at the edge, their black hair swaying in the wind. Pale cheeks shone in the moonlight when they turned to look at him.
Harry was sitting on the edge of his four-poster bed, looking as if he had committed third-degree murder. Ron patted his back.
"What do you think, Draco?" Harry said harshly. The blond was used to it now, however, and didn't recoil from the sharp tone. "Everyone thinks I'm crazy just because I passed out."
Draco stroked his hair and his body all but shook with relief. “You have no idea how worried I was. I thought you were going to leave me,” he said, his voice breaking at the end of his sentence.
"We're questioning you because you and Lola were close," Malfoy said coldly. "We don't care about your previous... crimes."
"Right. We need to find out where the guy lives and send a team over there fast," Harry said, pulling Malfoy up by his hand and leading him out of the room. The two men tried to ignore the feeling of electric sparks running up their arms from the touch but to no avail. Draco quickly snatched his hand out of Harry's, and the younger man noticed.
The Slytherin Harry's wand was tossed aside by Harry's Disarming Charm, and Harry looked at him with amusement.
Neville appeared from the bushes, and his face paled at the sight of Harry. Draco paid him no mind. Neville ran after him.
"Oi, I found something!" Draco called. Harry tentatively stepped over various papers and files and made his way over to his partner.
Rob's voice was empty and devoid of emotion. "I know she had DID and took regular medication for it. Lola asked me to keep an eye on her quite a few times when she slipped into the other version of herself. She failed out of Hogwarts because she could never concentrate on her work and was always daydreaming during classes. She didn't have many friends, either. Her husband, Dylan, was abusive towards her and left her after he discovered her magic."
"Hmm... it was on the fourth, wasn't it?" the pair nodded. "I was, uh, I can't remember, actually... oh, wait! My buddy, Mike, and I were in our sewing club!"
Harry wrapped his arms around the blond and pulled him in for a sideways hug. A muffled gasp of relief was heard, and the two boys looked up. Hermione. She ran over to Harry and reached out to touch him, but thought better of it, and her arm hung loosely by her side.
Harry was surprised at Hermione’s happy expression. If Draco had said that to him he would have been boiling with fury and rage. She went back inside to make another cup for Ron and Harry followed her.
"Alright, class! It's time to test out your potions!" Slughorn said happily. The class cheered weakly.
"I think that the neighbor, Rob, might know a little more than he says he does," Harry went on. "What do you say we bring him in and use Veritaserum this time?"
"Oi!" Harry yelled, pointing his wand in Malfoy's face, making him sneer. Hermione quickly muttered the counter curse, and Malfoy's features softened slightly.
"No, Ron! The fact that he sent you just shows that he feels too guilty to show his fucking face!" Harry yelled, shoving the door open and revealing his wayward hair and his sleep-deprived eyes. Ron's heart went out to him. "You of all people should understand how I feel!"
"They created a different kind of bonding potion, Harry. One which forced a Veela and their mate to be together. It only worked if the two had not already been, uh, mated, you could say," Slughorn said.
Malfoy looked strangely happy to be hearing this news, making Harry’s stomach churn. He was probably formulating a sick plan in his head. Or maybe…
"My name is not Harry James Potter. I am not eighteen. I am not a boy. I do not exist," Harry said robotically. Malfoy's eyes widened slightly.
"Harry, I'm going to need you to relax as much as possible for this to be as less painful as possible," the old woman said, as Harry sat down into a chair, Draco standing beside him.
"A few minutes should do the trick," she said and promptly left. Sure enough, Harry's eyes blinked open a few minutes later, and he looked around. Draco flung himself at him, sobbing into his shirt.
"Hey, mate! How's yours coming along-" he stopped midsentence when Harry gave a jolt and spilled the drink over himself and Malfoy. He made to apologize, but the liquid had already disappeared from Malfoy's shirt, seeping through his shirt. Harry felt a cold sensation spreading through his abdomen, and he felt odd. Ron made a quick getaway, leaving Malfoy and Harry by themselves.
"I'm trying to eat!" he exclaimed, gesturing towards his plate of food. Draco leaned over the large table and patted his shoulder.
Draco wrapped his arms around the smaller man and sighed. "We weren't expecting this. Only a few days before this man had been walking about with a smile on his face. It's okay to be surprised."
"Your DNA," she answered simply. "Draco, your tears must have gone in when you crushed those horns. And Harry..."
They cast their spells again, but this time, Harry had the upper hand. Draco's magic surged through him, making him feel more powerful than he had ever felt.
Harry screamed as he felt the Professor probe through his head, trying to rip open his brain's secrets. He could hear Draco fall to his knees next to him and cry out in pain. They gripped each other's hands tightly.
"Fine... I'll tell you," Harry mumbled, looking the other way. The truth was, he really wanted to let it all out, and telling somebody was the best thing he could think of. Even though it had been three years since Sirius' death, Harry felt as if he hadn't had the chance to mourn properly.
"Or find yourself a girl and have snogging sessions of your own," Dean said, laughing. He high-fived Seamus when Neville, blushing and spluttering, got up with his plate and moved to the other end of the table.
They ended up sitting on the floor, with Harry in Draco’s lap and with Draco leaning against the wall. Harry began crying again after a few minutes.
"Come on, we're nearly there," Draco said, tugging Harry in the direction of the Room of Requirement.
Harry groaned internally in frustration. What was happening to him? He was acting like a teenage girl!
Her dad rolled his eyes before taking her and putting her up on his shoulders. She clapped her hands in delight.
"Lupin," Harry said quietly, staring at the ground. The portrait swung open, and the two boys walked inside.
"You're not one to run away from your problems," Draco mused. "Aren't Gryffindors know for bravery?"
And Harry did. He turned his attention to the way Draco's hand had his in a tight grip. He could feel the scars and callouses on his palm and fingertips and the thought of them mapping his skin made them shiver.
Draco jerked back as the parchment set alight, burning Harry's hand. It went up in flames, ruining any chance of Draco reading it.
"Where were you on Saturday, the fifth of July?" Malfoy asked, scooting away from Harry and snarling distastefully. Harry pouted.
Harry gasped as Draco pushed him up against the wall in the Room of Requirement. Shivering as Draco gave him a ravenous one-over, he angled his neck to give his boyfriend more room to mark him. Harry could feel the smirk against his skin.
"Goodness! What- Poppy, explain!" McGonagall stood in the doorway, her face a mixture of horror and fear.
"I could cancel it..." Harry whispered, shrinking slightly. He really wanted to know what was wrong with him. He liked getting things over and done with.
"I'm just feeling a little under the weather, that's all," Harry reassured him before promptly having a coughing fit. Draco's eyebrows knitted together in concern.
"And what, exactly, do you plan to do about that?" Harry said, standing up a little straighter, taking a step forward. They were nose to nose, glaring at each other with pure hatred in their eyes.
”Fuck them! They’re just sad old people with sad old lives with nothing better to do,” Malfoy said angrily. Harry laughed a little, making Malfoy smile.
"And what about her daughter? You haven't questioned her?" Rob said, affronted. "That little bitch is a psychopath! She's not right in the head! When I would go over to Lola's house for tea, I'd overhear her and her daughter talking about the wildest things, even for witches! She's bonkers! I told Lola to stop feeding Molly fantasies and dreams but obviously-"
Thus accomplished, he preheated the oven and gathered what he'd need for dessert: butter, sugar, eggs, flour and, of course,
"You are quite the Hero, aren't you? Just like in school." The words were fond. "I'll give you the memory, but on one condition."
"You haven't made it to any of your appointments," Harry replied. "This is a house call." He opened the backpack at his feet to reveal the rope ladder, deflated exercise ball, ankle and wrist weights, and assorted other bits of gear it contained. "A genuine one."
"Don't bother Flooing me again," Pansy replied curtly before the flames went dark. Draco stared in shock at the spot her face had been a moment earlier. She'd been nastier than he had ever seen her, especially considering it was her precious Drakky she was talking to (a nickname she still used on occasion, though not as much as she had during school).
My portkey activates at 3:00. I will be waiting by the dining room table when you return home from work.
It was so powerful it left him lightheaded, with his face tingling and spots dancing before his eyes. "Holy
The ligaments in Harry's neck stood out, his head craning against his will as everything in his body tensed, primed for that final, delicious breaking point. "Merlin," he choked. "Draco!"
At Parkinson and Zabini, sure--snakes were apparently taught how to handle an interrogation at an early age; their refusal to talk convinced him of their guilt--but mostly at himself. His job would now be a whole lot harder because he'd been hasty in bringing them in. And Draco might be in even more danger because of his lapse in judgement.
"I don't have anything 'fancy muggle', which I didn't think was what you really meant. I mean, do muggles even know what 'fancy' means?"
"If punishment is what you want to give," Draco whispered back as he slowly licked his lips. He smirked, his eyes slightly hooded as he stared down his pointed nose. "Especially if it involves more of this."
Harry could hear Ron's snort even through the door--for some reason, he found it funny when Draco made outlandish excuses. That fact had saved them on more than one occasion.
"I wasn't sure you'd follow," Harry admitted from his hideout behind the door as he snagged Draco's shirt front and pulled him in for an aggressive snog. He was riding high on adrenalin and lust, the executive functioning parts of his brain temporarily disabled. Draco didn't have a chance to get a word in edgewise before their lips crashed together, masks bumping, tongues twining, each man making his own breathy noise of victory. He pinned Harry against the cool tiles of the wall--a welcome respite for his overheated skin--and Harry opened both his mouth and legs wider in invitation. He'd had a shitty couple of months. This was exactly what he needed without even knowing it.
"Where are we eating tonight, my personal Sex Auror? Judging by your clothes... Some place nice but also casual?"
"There's no need to rush," he gently chided, adding a second finger to the first and pumping slowly. As much as Draco wasn't a fan of using magic, Harry enjoyed the process of working his lovers until they were wet, relaxed, and ready. He massaged Draco inside and out until the grimace the spell had  put on his face melted away.
It sucked. It was with Cho Chang and I didn't know what to expect, but it was basically just a pressing of lips, maybe a half-second long.
, 'Morias's' third) to find Draco flowing down the stairs in what appeared to be blue silk. With his hair combed, shiny and loose, and a pink tinge to his lips and cheeks, he bore more than a passing resemblance to Narcissa.
Adrian wasn't the quickest broom in the shed, but he knew how to snog. Better still, he wasn't shy with his hands. We enjoyed our post-game ritual for the remainder of the season, his last at Hogwarts.
It was brilliant for them that they were still so wonderfully in love, but he wasn't exactly in the mood to be witness to it. Not so soon after Ian. And definitely not at another bloody Ministry function he was forced to attend against his will. (He still wanted to know where in the Head Auror's handbook did it say he'd have to attend ruddy
"Anyway," he continued, fixing his glasses from where they'd slipped down his nose, "if anyone bothers to notice you, they'll probably think you're a semi-pro footballer or something. But you'll find most of the folk in here to be focussed on their own business, not yours."
Harry stopped resisting his advances, instead planting a kiss of his own on Draco's collarbone and wrapping a leg around his waist.
The shopgirl was smirking slightly when he went to pay but there was nothing mean in the expression. She handed Draco the cone and waved Harry's sickles away. "I don't know what you are to each other," she explained, "and it's not my business to ask, but whatever it is, it makes me happy. This one's on the house."
"How long does it take to eat a bowl of treacle tart?" Draco asked tersely and frowned. However, his annoyance suddenly ebbed away and in the place of his frown was a smirk. They sat right across from each other and Harry had a tendency to leave his legs hanging open, despite certain past experiences with Draco. The blonde lifted one bare foot and without preamble pressed the ball roughly onto his lover's clothed cock.
Draco's legs were bared around the blankets, like he had wrapped himself back up in a hurry, though his hips and up were well cocooned. He gave a loud, fake snore indicating he was (badly, or perhaps playfully?) pretending to be asleep. Draco stretched his feet out and slowly rolled over onto his back (head still covered.)
The next day, Draco arrived at the Ministry exactly on time--the clock was just chiming noon in the lobby. Despite the clawing fear and the racing of his thoughts he schooled his features into a confident smirk and looked for his escort. His hands were jammed into the pockets of his knee-length coat to hide how much they shook. It wasn't terribly cool that day (actually, it was nearly blistering), but certain standards required certain dress codes. Coming to the Ministry meant he would need something to hide himself in, so to speak, in case he needed to, in fact, hide... Like his hands. Or the occasional leap of his chest at random noises.
"Are you bloody serious??" Draco flipped up from the couch and walked to stand a scant inch or so from Harry. "You know what this development means? It means I am going to have to spend at least a day sorting out old memories to see what else I've been hiding in here! It means I..."
He walked away from Harry, loosening his grip until their hands fell away as he strode up to the door of Grimmauld. Apparently apparating into the place wasn't as easy as apparating out, which was more than fine to him. He turned to lean his back against the door and suck in his bottom lip--eyes wandering over Harry with an obvious leer.
scoop, Potter. That is what I do every time. You will note that I have never been in a hospital-mandated quarantine despite our regular exposure to all manner of unsavoury individuals and situations.
The next question was: had whoever left the plant done so ignorantly or was it a deliberate trap. If the latter, who was it meant for?
"Apparently I judge everything harshly. Just ask--" Draco shook his head before he could finish that thought and instead huffed a laugh. "How can you be so talented at blow jobs and fingering, but utter pants at something as simple as hand holding? Honestly!"
Ordinarily Harry wouldn't mess with someone's hair--even if, for some strange reason, he thought he could improve on the style--but he'd been given express permission. He gleefully ran his fingers through Draco's gelled locks, shaking them out until the strands fell loose about his face.
"Secondly, just take a minute to think about how the situation looked to me, yeah?" he entreated, rubbing small circles with his thumb on Draco's bicep. "I was fairly certain you weren't the one behind the attack but I had to be sure. I am now, so let's get to the bottom of this together. Please?"
syringe," he called with a wave, and from the seemingly empty second floor flew a wooden case. He caught it and walked back to the living room.
Potter's hand finally got in on the action, squeezing Draco's prick once before it matched the tempo of his thrusts. It was heaven.
"How will I turn you on with my clothes ever again if you're already turned on? How can I give you inappropriate stiffies now if you can control yourself?"
"To put it simply, they married out of obligation and wanted me to do the same. Being gay changes nothing. I'm sure that on some level they did care for each other very much, as they do continue to be quite civil--even affectionate, but my father never planned to stay with her. I sometimes feel sorry for my mother, though her life today is apparently very exciting. She told me of exploring the pyramids just last week--the pyramids! My mother! But I think she was a lot like Pansy in that she had hoped it would be a permanent arrangement. When I broke things off--well... Nevermind."
Harry silently wished everyone else would follow suit and leave him and Draco alone to process the horrible evening, but he would never be so lucky.
So, yes, come save me. I hate this place and I am going mad being cooped up here. That, and I am curious about your ideas. I technically have to remain in some sort of quarantine for two more days, but I am certain your place would be fine for that. Or mine if you prefer.
Eyes shut tight against the spray and legs wobbling dangerously, he panted for breath in Draco's embrace. His body tingled and hummed, hot and satisfied.
"I mean, it's a bit soon, isn't it?" Nervous hands clutched at his trousers. "I was thinking we might do a bit more of the stuff we did earlier. There's no rush to--" He interrupted himself with a gulp. Muggle-loving Merlin, he felt like a stammering teenager. It had been some time since he was shy about sex, but this was new to him, too.
Malfoy said nothing. Harry could practically see his thought process--it was obvious the moment he put two and two together.
On the topic of pureblood expectations, I was under the impression that being gay didn't get you off the hook for begetting an heir. Not that I blame you. Ginny was none-too-pleaded about the fact I had a difficult time getting it up with her. (Does the line "it's not you, it's me" ever work with anyone?)
P. S. At least you've gained a bit of humility and perspective  from this ordeal. Really, though, I'd rather you be the same insufferable prat and for the contents of my stomach to stay there.
Draco laughed as if it was hilarious--and it was--but perhaps he should have felt more concerned about it. Harry's face suggested that maybe he should have. But Blaise was harmless, really. Handsy at times, randy
On that particular Thursday, at least, the intrepid retorter had done wonders for Harry's productivity.
Harry chuckled. "I find that hard to believe," he answered truthfully, wrapping around Draco like a clinging vine (lest he suddenly come to his senses and attempt to flee). He pulled the ridiculous mask and bonnet off Draco's head and tossed them off the side of the bed. Much better.
Harry chuckled. "Maybe we should just lay here looking fondly at each other, then," he joked, a smile tugging at his lips.
Loathe as he was to admit it, Draco needed help. He couldn't so much as hold his wand in this infernal form, let alone wield magic.
Draco's face twisted, agonized. His legs spasmed and shook, his feet curled, his core flexed, prick bouncing against his stomach as he fucked himself mercilessly, looking straight at Harry whenever his eyes were open. It set a new standard for erotic stimulation. Merlin, it set a whole new category. In Harry's mind there was now a space for everything else, and one just for Draco. (Not only was he possibly ruined for other men, Harry feared he might be ruined for anyone else ever; he'd better hope things worked out between them or his sex life would take a serious downturn when they broke them off.)
The girl placed their food in front of them and offered to top off their glasses. Harry declined. He could pour for himself and he was eager to be rid of her. The house lights flashed, signaling the time to take a seat, while the server continued to bustle around them. Draco looked curious and slightly alarmed.
I'll be fine by Monday. I've been taking my potions according to the directions and I've been resting in bed all weekend and I'm feeling loads better than last Friday when I sicked up on your shoes. (Sorry again for that, by the way. Just send me the bill for the new ones when you get them.)
He dropped into his chair across from Ron and leaned forward with his arms braced on his thighs. "Cold-cocking Zabini wasn't directly related," he answered with a self-satisfied smirk, "but it felt damn good. He was being an unrepentant arsehole. But that's neither here nor there. The important thing is his date--the very same witch who'd served me and Draco at the Garden Room!"
He continued working his fingers through Draco's hair, feeling the bumps and ridges of his skull and listening to his contented hums and sighs. Eventually, he brought his soapy thumbs down the back of Draco's neck to press into the tight knots of muscle there.
Your symptoms are concerning. You should be under the supervision of a qualified potions expert. Want me to come tend to you? I can help alleviate at least two of those problems.
as well as hear the power and authority in the word. The pillow’s seams, which had only just come unraveled, hastened to stitch themselves back together again, stuffing flowing back in as if the effect of gravity had been reversed. Seconds later, the item was good as new.
And Malfoy's continuous flirty little comments weren't helping matters. What was the point of them anyway? Was he trying to make Harry squirm? (If so--success!)
Harry was more than ready to put the day behind him by the time he left work to prepare for his date. Left over adrenalin from the case--and a bit of nervousness, if he was being honest--had him feeling twitchy. He poured himself two fingers of Ogden's, changed, tried doing something--anything--with his hair (and gave it up for a bad job five minutes later), and checked himself over in the mirror one last time before apparating to Draco's. He looked good. He smiled at the certainty Draco would look
There was a small, polite smile on his face as he nodded and vaguely interacted with the crowd. Apparently a few had gone the extra mile and changed their hair or eye color--was that Unspeakable Jones with green hair? A few guests even looked as if they could be related to Draco with the white-blonde they chose to sport. It might have been annoying, had it not offered the perfect opportunity...
His body seemed torn between wanting to let go of everything in passive surrender to Draco's mouth and clenching in rejection of the foreign object probing somewhere it didn't belong. His arse didn't hurt, which he was glad of, but the experience wasn't exactly pleasant, either--Draco's finger felt invasive and unwelcome. But the man had bloody well come on Harry's fingers so there had to be something he was missing.
He jogged to catch up and stopped his irate dinner companion with a hand on his arm. "Just listen to me, okay?"
As soon as Draco stepped through the floo his facade of superiority and haughty grace fell to the floor in exchange for a long yawn (which he hid behind a hand
Malfoy sat across from him smiling cherubicly between bites, continuing to stroke his leg all the while with a nimble foot that would never not be sexy from that point forward.
Over and around the deeply visceral experience of breathing in a cloud of Potter's sex--Draco's pink nose all but vibrated in its frenzied sniffing (quite against his will)--were the noises.
Though Draco was plenty receptive, and Gieves known for his discretion (the tailor would have to be with
"The fact that I can't apparate us from here, unlike other Level 7 employees," Draco replied with a chuckle even as he dragged Potter towards his office floo (after grabbing their wands.) The flames came to life in the same instant that Draco pressed Potter up against the old brick mantel and returned his biting kisses.
"Of course I am," he replied as he lifted his legs around Harry's waist to pull him in close. "And you... Are too damn handsome for anyone's good."
"I guess we both like it rough," Draco breathed a laugh at Harry's sudden, almost adorable eagerness.
Harry groaned deeply when Draco began wanking him with the slick, sweet-smelling lube, his grip sure and pace steady. He resisted the urge to thrust, fisting his hands in the sheets instead. He wanted this to last and at the rate things were going, that was going to be a challenge.
"Wednesdays are good for them usually. Molly watches Rose so they can have a quiet night to themselves."
“Do you make a habit of ordering your ‘manservants’ to strip?” he fired back, sneering around the offending word even as a part of his brain cautioned him to avoid upsetting Malfoy on day one of Operation: Grand Gesture (and another smaller but no-less-compelling and entirely Gryffindor part was urging him to just get on with it already and see what happens).
The room was large, with a deep tub, glass walled walk-in shower, and expansive counter top, all done in black with white accents and shiny silver fixtures. It was pristine--not a single thing out on the counter. It could have been a hotel bathroom, for all that it appeared no one used it.
Draco was just thankful Potter was easy to find. As soon as he saw the familiar tuft of black hair, the Slytherin practically darted across the floor toward him (without jogging or running and while somehow maintaining as casual an air as he could.) Once he was side-by-side with the Auror, he was being led toward the back of the lobby where a number of lifts were waiting. He happily took his biscuit and tea, instantly looking at least ten degrees happier, and sidled up close to Potter (without touching) as they approached and entered a small lift.
"Easy there," Harry chuckled, extricating himself from Draco's grip to save his robes from stains. "You're inky as a squid."
After long moments of hugging the man in his lap and trying to ignore the growing issue in his tight trousers, Draco regretfully pulled away and swallowed hard for air.
I don't know what you mean. I am absolutely not ensorcelled! It is not unheard of for me to think of you so constantly that I cannot sleep. Why, that's happened on and off for a number of years now. Nor is it so odd that I bought a lock of your hair for more galleons than is considered reasonable by my mother and am keeping said lustrous, lovely hair in a glass case on the off chance that you might come to reclaim it someday, which would require coming to see me in person (and that, I assure you, would
"OhthankMerlin," Harry exclaimed on a sigh, slumping with relief. "I thought you were dosed for sure. Godrick, I felt horrible." He grinned sheepishly and closed the distance between them. "I'm totally in my right mind," he assured the dubious Unspeakable. "I never drink anything I didn't see come out of a bottle or can. Too many close calls for me not to be cautious."
"I tried to tell you before," he admitted, hoping he didn't sound too pathetic saying so. "Too subtly, I guess. That's not usually a problem for me," he wryly observed.
And that fact alone was enough to ratchet up his anxiety to palm-sweat-inducing levels. Never mind what thinking too hard about the kinds of diabolical torments Malfoy might dream up for payback did to his nerves.
He cackled evilly at Harry's exaggerated frown, but stopped short a moment later upon registering the content of the parchment he held.
"Well, I technically didn't go through your things, being as it was right out in the op--" Draco stopped short with a regretful grimace. "Right. I'm sorry. It was just nice that someone I knew liked that schmaltzy romantic drivel as much as I do, that's all."
Draco chuckled. Instead of feeling mad or disappointed, he was relieved. He leaned back in his chair with a long sigh.
The trip to the loo was short. It didn't take long to arrive and finish his business, so with what he considered to be plenty of time left for one to be reasonably gone for the toilet, he decided to have a quick look around.The water closet often spoke volumes about a person, almost as much as the bedroom, after all.
"I meant that If you sensed a problem in your relationship or if Draco himself was pulling away, would you fix it or try to regain his attentions? If you broke up over something petty, would you try to make it right?" Lucius almost seemed to speak directly from experience with that. "Love is not nearly enough, and you don't have even that yet."
You fancy me? Since when? Just last week I overheard plans of you trying to poison me with something. Either your brand of affection is psychotic or you're more drunk than even
He dropped his arms to his sides and shuffled minutely where he stood, all too aware of their audience.
There was nothing Draco could do for the time being, and he was not one to engage in piteous self loathing in front of others, so instead he shifted his thoughts around via well practiced Occlumency until all that was left in the forefront of his mind was Harry, the earnest look the Auror was giving him, and just enough numbing nothingness that Draco was able to sport a slightly flimsy seductive smile.
Harry spared a passing thought over possible romance between them but quickly dismissed it as foolishness. Just because he had found love in the most unlikely place didn't mean anyone else would. Probably.
Draco leaned over the table and bit his lower lip as he regarded Harry with a smoldering haze. The bit of soft, pink flesh snapped from his teeth.
"Maybe," he replied petulantly (the delivery softened with a wink). In a seductive tone of voice, he added, "I don't think getting on your knees would be a good idea here as we are trying to keep things clean. Maybe
The day had taken a turn for the worse when Parkinson and Zabini arrived for questioning. Even though they hadn't been allowed to communicate with one another, they followed the exact same script when Ron began their interrogations, with Harry watching through a spelled wall. (He'd sat out so as to not compromise the results in case someone wanted to accuse him of bias at their trial.)
He slipped his fork into his mouth and sucked on it as his gaze stayed locked with Potter's. He let his tongue flick off the prongs. "My point is... I'm glad I didn't just get off on anyone when the opportunity presented itself, but I'm also no prude. I want to fuck you, but I'm willing to wait. Good thing we can explore and play in the meantime!"
"My clothes are a mess, so unless you meant I could have walked around completely nude," he spoke with a seductive lilt to his voice, "I did have to." He nipped Harry's ear and added, "Maybe later. If you ask nicely."
Enjoy this treacle tart. Or not. I suppose I cannot force you to enjoy anything I send, but I have heard you moan like a high-priced rent boy trying to make a client feel extra special when they serve these in the canteen so it seemed like a promising option.
Harry barked a laugh. (The man was funny, as well? He was learning all kinds of new and interesting things about Draco Malfoy.) His arse was leaking onto his desk and felt empty and underused; his spent cock lay limp across his hip in a shiny puddle of semen.
"Harry worked quite hard on the meal. I look forward to it," he said, knowing that was at least a positive sentiment he could be honest about.
Harry placed a hand where he could tell Draco's head was and suddenly wished he were naked. It would have been nice to run his fingers through the man's soft hair and to tickle his nape, but it wasn't to be. (
With a crushing sense of dread, Draco placed his forepaws on the black lacquered frame and pulled himself up for a look.
Draco quirked a brow at his date. At first, he thought Harry had followed him out of impatience (he must have taken at least ten whole minutes) and found it somewhat amusing, until he noticed the Auror's serious grimace. The way his brow furrowed and his lips thinned meant trouble either happened or was afoot.
"Oh...wow," he sighed and a tired, slightly delirious chuckle escaped. He turned to stare into Harry's shining, lust-filled eyes with a satisfied smile.
I'm not dead! But holy moly have I been bad at updating lately. To those of you hanging in there  waiting literal months for the next chapter, you have both my sincerest apologies and thanks. I keep waiting for life to settle and it continues…Not settling. The good news is I have another chapter ready to go following this one (and it's a smut fest). The bad news is, I can't make any promises about update frequency after that. But I will do my best! ~playout
He was getting ahead of himself. First things first: returning to a form that could even handle a broom. (Or a
I feel I must point out, you used the phrase 'not showing yet' rather loosely. Sneezing sparks and green between the toes are classic early symptoms and, yes, that detail has made it in the formal report. Which I have to do in
There was a special trick to a man's prostate that Draco had written about on more than on occasion. As delightful as it was causing the Saviour of the Wizarding World to come slowly undone, he was feeling impatient about finally getting to taste him--to see his face at the moment of release and feel his spasms in his mouth.
"... Excuse me?" he asked with a short bark of a chuckle. Harry wasn't the type to joke about such thigs, but it didn't quite click. "Pansy loves me, despite her occasional bad attitude. And Blaise has wanted me since his bollocks dropped. They're the only ones besides my parents who bothered to keep in touch. They always kept their standing visit with me every month, and Blaise even procured us private arrangements when the three of us would meet for coffee or dinner! Because he understands how I feel about the public now. He was even accommodating when I told him I would only see him with Pansy in tow because he knows what a horny bastard he is! Why would... They wouldn't."
Malfoy rolled his eyes but moved to comply all the same. He stood with some difficulty and stepped to the side so Harry could lift the settee and whisk the rug out from under it. He turned toward the door but halted mid-step to spear Harry with a stern finger and even more sternly worded, “No snooping.”
and went ballistic with photos and speculation any time he appeared at a charity gala or some such nonsense with another fat check from his family's deep vaults (the same vaults that had gotten Lucius released 'for good behaviour' after just
Eventually, his thumb was set free. He licked his drying lips and silver once again met bright, jewel green--which seemed to flicker. He smirked as confidently as he could muster.
Harry felt his face flame and resolutely refused to let Malfoy see it. He wouldn’t give him the satisfaction.
Draco stuffed his mouth with another spoonful of delicious soufflé (with ice cream) as he gave Harry the flattest frown he could muster while chewing. He rolled his eyes, though it was accompanied by the return of a small smile as he watched Harry's brilliant green eyes flash. The man was obviously plotting something.
Harry grabbed Draco's wrist to stop him just as Miss Perfect Timing appeared to ask if they wanted dessert menus. Harry put in their order and turned to scold the irrepressible tease as soon as their server left.
I am going to eat so much treacle tart when I get out. You should come with me--I will need some company after this mess. I feel like I'm in prison. I haven't been able to deal well with isolation since I was a kid.
"My sessions with Ms Nancy are progressing decently well," Malfoy replied eventually. "Though you were not exaggerating her lack of tolerance for complaining of any sort." Harry chuckled, suspecting Malfoy may have tested it on purpose just to see if he'd been right. At least he’d sounded fond when he said so Harry presumed the two were on good enough terms. “I told her I am a painter and want desperately to get back to my craft,” Malfoy continued, expression wry, “so we have been working with a paintbrush, amongst other things. It’s more like a wand than the writing implement she had me using before,” he explained. “It has been...helpful."
"Chocolate is good for health and soul! Especially when combined with red wine," Draco countered with a superior sniff. He eyed the fries and their almost carrot orange color with the same trepidation as the burger... Though that had turned out well. He broke off an end with careful minstration and popped it into his mouth--chewing slowly it as if to discern all its ingredients.
Harry beamed, trusting Draco to keep his word (how 'bout that?). With his hands now freed, he looped them behind Draco's neck to pull him down for a snog. They couldn't quite reach, but they could lap at each other's tongues and did so eagerly. He knotted the fingers of one hand into the silky hair at Draco's nape and trailed the other down his back and around his trim waist. Draco wasn't as thin as he used to be--he was still rangy, of course, but he'd filled out a bit, developed some muscle doing Merlin knows what down in the Department of Mysteries. It suited him.
. "If things between us ever go south, I trust that we can handle it like adults." He, at least, wouldn't be arranging or executing any attacks--bloody Slytherins.
Draco flashed Harry a grateful smile. Being in Diagon was beyond nerve wracking, and he could tell Harry wasn't having much fun with it either, but having him around was calming (though not completely) his ragged nerves.
"I do," Harry countered truthfully, having met skepticism like Malfoy's before (just never from a wizard). "Especially at the end of the day or if I've been on my feet a lot or it's damp out. But I spent more than a year in occupational therapy strengthening the remaining muscle and learning how to walk again. So I am a living testament to the fact this works." He gestured expansively let Malfoy know what all he meant by 'this.'
I composed my last missive much too hastily and did not consider the consequences of such a foolish suggestion. You are the Saviour, Harry. Your name, your friends, your life in general cannot contain a blow like being romantically attached to me. Even being seen as companions outside these letters is ill-advised. Instead, I would wish you to find someone more worthy of the honour (and less likely to get you hexed).
I wasn't exaggerating when I said my relatives hated me. They treated me like a house-elf... Like your
"It is... Passable. Somewhat...tangy?" He chewed some more as he thought. "I wouldn't object to having it again, I suppose," he announced, to Harry's apparent pleasure. "The truth is, I've never had much food beyond our local cuisine, French, and a bit of Italian. Unless you count bratwurst."
"You look good with your prick in my hand, Draco," he drawled, voice low and gravely. He felt vaguely embarrassed saying it but Draco's tiny gasp of response was plenty motivational.
“What’s the point?” came Malfoy’s tetchy reply as he looked away sharply. “I can’t do anything with it.“
You did WHAT? What gives you the right to go through my desk?! Yes, I had several sentimental items, including a pen holder Teddy made me and a snitch necklace watch I got as a gift from the Tutshill Tornadoes! And my mug--my mug had better be there when I get back!
Someone familiar walked up behind Harry that made Draco's eyes widen with surprise. Blaise Zabini, perhaps having followed Harry--though he was certain Harry would have realized, was waltzing up to them like he owned the place (a swagger he perfected thanks to Draco himself, the former master of such a skill.) At first he merely nodded politely and moved to walk past them before pausing upon sudden recognition. Draco could see Harry tense up like an angry dog.
Draco twitched. It was suddenly too hot in the kitchen, and not just because of the curry they were cooking filling the room with warmth. He took a long, deep breath and turned his back slowly on the Auror. With one hand braced to the counter and the other hanging loose at his side, eyes fixed on some random dot on the wall, he asked a plain, "Why?" in a wavering voice.
Maybe it wasn't too late to go back to school. Hermione could help him study. He could become a medical examiner--cadavers don't talk back or take offense or suggest the barmiest bloody ideas ever to be dreamt up...
He needed to remember for the future to make Draco come first. It was only Harry's powerful sense of duty keeping him from rolling onto his side and dozing on the table just then.
At this point, Harry wondered if it would be easier to tell her the truth. The chair beneath him creaked as he leaned back to regain a bit of personal space.
He followed Draco's lead and turned to the menus. When he saw that there was one devoted exclusively to chocolate, he wondered if there had been any validity to the story Ron told earlier about one of Draco's suitors being dumped over his disdain for the confection. If so, it was fortunate for him the chocolate lava cake was calling his name.
“I believe you’re right.” Saw, poke. “It seemed almost to be wild magic.” Bite, chew. “I’ve never seen anything like it. Have you?”
"Ugh. What else is new," Harry said disgustedly, crumpling the paper and dumping it in the bin. "I don't want to talk about the bloody Prophet."
Without further ado, he pulled a purple memo sheet out of the top drawer of his desk and took up a quill to write the request.
on a mission. Unfortunately, he had yet to divine a foolproof way to make Potter realize he was a wizard, not a runaway pet.
Draco didn't need the history lesson--he knew the material by heart, of course--but Potter's admiration was not something he would ever refuse. He pranced in a circle on the duvet and ended it with a regal bow, making Potter laugh, warm and easy as before (it did unspeakable, butterfly-like things to his insides).
I have been dared to pay you a compliment. (The dare-giver mistakenly thought this would be a challenge for me.)
He let the trio suffer a few seconds longer than was perfectly ethical, then put the lot of them out of their misery with a tight succession of stunners, trading the rune's ropes for conventional ones while the would-be assailants sprawled unconscious on Draco's bedroom floor.
"I wouldn't mind letting you keep doing what you're doing," he drawled in answer, sluggish from a long day, a full belly, and the warm night air. (Also the skilled hands on his prick--those were pretty great.) But he knew that he'd want to go to sleep as soon as he came, which meant Draco had to go first. He slid backwards until he had room to open Draco's trousers, which he did with haste.
At least Harry was getting out of the office on time. He hadn't heard a word from Draco (not that he expected to). He hoped he was still home.
Wait wait wait... Wait. "Stay conscious this time"? Did we do more than I thought we did? And are you offering in a matey sort of way or…?
“Other things being equal, I’d rather eat right away. I think my stomach might be digesting itself,” he said. After a quick, subtle sniff in the direction of his underarm, he added ruefully, “But I won’t be fit for formal dining without a shower. I wasn’t at my best before now and I’m afraid I smell worse than a wet crup after all that.”
easy, mind you--Malfoy often looked like he was sucking lemons after letting one slip--but it happened more and more often as he gained confidence with the exercises Harry put him through.) The likelihood of a gibe also increased in direct proportion to how hard Harry pushed him.
Sadly, this fic was put on hiatus by the unexpected demise of Prinn's computer but she is now up and running with a new one, which means so are we!
Malfoy looked calculating. "What about all that vacation time you threatened me with earlier?" he retorted blithely.
"Rinse," he prompted, doing likewise with his hands and forearms (praising himself for the foresight of taking off his shirt since his whole front was wet from unintentional splashes).
"Like that, do you?" he asked smugly, leaning up on his elbows to see Draco's face. He looked half-shocked and entirely awed, his hands were white-knuckled on the slats of the headboard. Harry felt a surge of mixed triumph and lust.
needed to be involved, Harry offered the vague, "He doesn't know how to take 'No' for an answer," and silently begged the women to leave it at that. He fidgeted in his seat, never having gotten used to being the centre of attention despite all the practice.
Draco's body was opposite to his in almost every way. Where Harry was short and broad, Draco was long and slender; almost skinny, but with enough lean muscle to lend him some masculine definition. Harry's tongue itched to taste those peaks and valleys.
Blaise thankfully let go after that. Draco held his hand up to Harry to halt his boyfriend from any rash decisions, the only thing keeping him in place.
I hope it's not giving too much away to say that I hoped I would pick you. I didn't think I actually would, though! I'm surprised you even chose to participate in the Secret Santa since you're only working here for your probation. (It is a pleasant surprise, I assure you.)
It wasn't just his thumb. The biscuit was decorated with a generous amount of chocolate, and by the time he was half-way through each of Draco's fingers were dotted in dark-brown. There was even a smudge on his upper-lip.
"I'm glad you like it," Draco replied with a chuckle as he avoided the vegetables, despite having cooked them. "I wasn't sure how you would feel about beets or the seared brussel sprouts, but I am glad you enjoy them. In fact, you can have them all! I mostly added them for color and tried to cook it to my tastes, but alas... I shall never be a health nut."
He bit into a piece of fish and forgot some of his indignation. Warm, flaky meat in the center and perfectly crisp batter outside. It was brilliant as ever.
Harry picked up the cheesecake plate and held it protectively against his chest, angled safely away from Draco for his next bite.
“It is not without complication,” Malfoy countered, tucking both hands into his sleeves, a plaintive look on his face. “She keeps pestering me to see my work. I told her I destroyed them all in a fit of pique but now she is insisting I begin painting again to build up my strength."
Draco shuddered, gooseflesh erupting across his skin, his nipples tightening almost painfully. If Potter asked, he'd blame it on the sudden change of temperature--it had been stuffy under the dress--not the very real effect his brash, domineering swagger had on him. (It was impressive how Potter could channel such raw masculinity in that ridiculous getup, but then that had always been his way.)
Thanks to @Halien for this important note: "a syringe full of air won't kill anyone. The worst it'll do is....put a pocket of air under your skin. Gross, but not deadly. What *would* kill you is air in an IV for a pretty long amount of time (long enough to deprive your heart or brain of blood). But the syringe thing is a common myth, so I think it's still perfectly logical for the assailant to have tried it! When I first had to give myself injections (I'm on HRT), I was super worried about it and a nurse set me straight. So just in case it scares anyone else...no need to worry!" Thank you, Halien, for the correction! <3 ~Playout
This smallish chapter concludes your three-part Christmas present.  Updates will probably slow down again after this, but there hopefully won't be another months-long hiatus! Thank you for reading and sticking with us!
But if you are serious about the boyfriend bit, that's something. You don't throw that word around lightly. And I know you'd be useless even if you did show up because you would just be thinking about him the whole time.
"I know I am," Draco replied with a short chuckle after a long, recovering sigh. He ran his fingers through Harry's sweaty, mussed hair. "That reminds me; you told me once you found sex boring. I never asked you if you still feel that way. And remember I am a Legillimans so I will know if you're lying."
"Apparently not," Harry groused, but he stooped to pick up his newspaper anyway. He surreptitiously adjusted his trousers and jogged to catch up to Draco.
You have crossed the line into serious hex territory. Send one more letter, photograph, or coded message to Potter and it'll be curses next.
"And I do plan to put the moves on you later, but we have to get through dinner first, so let's talk about something else." He cast about for a safe topic. It took more effort than it should have--his brain just kept supplying him with subjects that circled back to his desire to strip Draco down and put his hands and mouth all over him.
Draco grinned as Harry brought him in for a comforting hug. The kiss that followed was even nicer, and suddenly Draco felt secure again (or as secure as he could get these days.) He allowed Harry to lead him out, or did at first. Harry stopped and stared at his own reflection while Draco snickered.
Harry's finger met considerably less resistance after Draco's muscles were forcibly loosened and conjured lube was added to the much nicer berry-scented stuff he'd brought.
The long and short of it with Ginny is that I figured out somewhere around the time I was halfway to freezing and/or starving to death (while hiding out from the man who'd been trying to kill me since I was a baby) that what I was really attracted to was the
Harry rolled his eyes. "You are currently laying in a cocoon of my germs," he countered archly, indicating the bed and covers. "If you're gonna get sick, that ship has already sailed, my friend."
“We both know you’ve never been much of a gentleman,” Harry supplied instead, earning himself a reluctant chuckle.
," he grumbled, elbowing the boneless git in the side. (He was heavier than he looked!) Potter mumbled an unintelligible protest but complied. He rolled off Draco, pulling him along until their positions were reversed, chest-to-chest this time. Draco straddled his legs and deigned to give him a sweet, slow kiss in thanks for a fuck well done.
“I don’t rightly know,” Harry answered, equally breathless. In truth, he’d never heard of such a magical connection before. The only thing even somewhat like it was the strange affinity his wand had shared with Tom Riddle’s. But that had felt violent, chaotic. Mean. This was…
And that, more or less, was how he found himself shivering outside the Manor's gates in the murky time between days (where did one end and next begin, exactly?), blowing on fingers that were both numb and stinging from the combination of the damp cold and his several failed attempts to dismantle the wards keeping the wrought iron bars firmly shut.
"To new horizons and pleasant surprises," Draco replied at last before taking a long sip. "Music, dinner... You nearly have a perfect trio event set for the night, but even without the dancing this has been wonderful thus far... And I am very much looking forward to everything. Including this Mozart. I may have heard his music before, but if he was muggle then I may have simply decided not to bother remembering his name... It was how I was raised, you know."
But he attempted to turn the tides of Draco's ire one last time. (If this one didn't work, he was just going home...and taking his dinner with him.)
"It's obvious you didn't intend to become a ferret," he remarked (apropos of nothing), trailing his fingers over Draco's abdomen as though he still had fur. "What did you
Harry was already done washing but he'd be a fool to turn down an offer like that. He faced the rear wall and ignored the shadow of unease he felt turning his back on another person. Although he trusted Draco not to harm him--and wasn't that a novel thought--he didn't like not being able to see or anticipate what might happen to him. In this case, though, he had a pretty fair idea of Draco's intent and it was something he wanted. Rather a lot.
Their seats were close enough that Draco could easily lean in and kiss Harry's cheek, which he did with an added lick to his neck.
He looked back at his stack of useless files--Hogwarts' roster from the years Malfoy had attended, a comprehensive list of war casualties, and a single newspaper review of the high-end club where the attack took place, which highlighted their so-called 'impressive and innovative' security measures--with a frustrated sigh. It was always harder tracking down relevant information on a cold case.
He entered the kitchen, letting the door swing shut behind him as he strode inside and placed his hands on his hips.
Apparently having made up his mind, Malfoy opened the door and ushered him in. With only a small twinge of apprehension, Harry stepped through and entered Malfoy Manor.
After sucking the mark into being, he moved his mouth to Draco's ear. "You should know," he breathed across the shell, "I plan to know every inch of you before we're through."
It wasn't much longer. The waitress had returned and offered to wrap their food "to go", a concept Draco hadn't heard of at a sit-down restaurant before, so what was left was put into surprisingly lovely boxes with silver writing. The crowd had died down enough to walk through with only a minimal amount of issue. Draco had a hand on Harry's arm, "allowing" his date to carry what was left of their dessert.
"I should have known I would make even this look good." He chuckled. "You at least know how to wear a suit, even if it looks as hard as a brick. Why did you choose to wear something with such a stiff collar?"
Draco's outfit was ridiculous. Just completely absurd. Did he look good in it? Yes, absolutely. Was it enticing? Sure, in certain lights. But it was also impractical, ostentatious, and totally bizarre when compared with the attire of most of the rest of the establishment's patrons. And it had probably cost more than Harry's entire wardrobe combined. He would never understand haute couture.
He approached the stall under a red and white (and dirt) striped umbrella, said hullo to Mike the vendor (ignoring his dramatic eyebrow raise at the fact Harry was holding hands with a bloke), ordered for two, and handed over muggle paper money, telling Mike to keep the change.
Potter stood, clutching his towel to his waist to prevent it from slipping. Pity. "Well," he said. The shadow of a smile lingered at the corners of his mouth and eyes. "Let me get dressed and then we'll get you sorted."
"Do you need water?" Draco already flipped Harry's wand back into his hand. It didn't respond as well as his own, but his was in the bag and Harry's was right there. He placed the tip of the wand to Harry's lips and poured a small amount into his mouth with a small Aquamenti--carefully avoiding suffocating the man.
Besides, I admit I have wanted to ask you on a- to spend time with me anyway. That wasn't a side-effect of any hospital mishap.
Harry pushed and pulled and squeezed his prick, not wanking properly since his hand was dry, but driving himself mad all the same. His mouth hung open, his shallow, rapid breaths doing a piss poor job of delivering oxygen to his lungs.
"You mentioned that before." Draco meant back in the sitting room when Potter had tossed the book at him. His cheeks heated once more at the confession, though the frown he was trying his best to sport was an obvious (and failed) attempt to hide his embarrassment. His eyes were staring down at the counter.
over a table?" he smirked as he carried Draco quickly to the sitting room. (They hadn't even left the foyer before Harry was starkers!)
I doubt you should be doing such things while sick. Can't be good for you, though what you have and how you handle it is admittedly impressive.
The barest hint of hard-earned pride in Malfoy’s tone warmed an answering feeling in Harry. "That’s brilliant!" he beamed. “It’s a right clever lie.”
"Of course I thought about you!" he said exasperatedly. "And the more I thought about it, the more convinced I was you would disapprove. And look at that--I was right!"
