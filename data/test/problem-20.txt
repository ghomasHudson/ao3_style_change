"Are you Ms. Hannah Jennica Black?" the guy whom I finally recognized as the president asked, looking at me from head to toe.
"W-hat are you doing Dray?" I said as soon as the kiss ended. "Not here!"
I just couldn't help but whine at that statement…
I walked towards that corner they just left, and heard a faint sob. 'As I thought,' I said to myself. I was startled at what I saw. I saw Ren there hugging her knee, crying with papers(clearly been stepped on due to the dirt covering them) scattered all around her, I walked towards her and saw a little bit of blood on her white long sleeves.
"I mean you were chosen to be one of the candidates for the 37th Pageant of the Annual Hogwarts Yule Celebration."
"The sooner we scare her out of here the better, now will you come with me?"
"No… I'll get a big fat F in his class if he does."
"I told you it's in bad condition, after that incident in the bathroom with Ms. Ugly-mug Parkinson." Ron explained as he took a seat beside me.
"Since you might have just STOMPED your way here, I'm letting HARRY borrow that new Porche I bought a week ago." Sirius explained.
"What!" Pansy shouted… and I was sure her screech was heard throughout the whole damn school. "You can't do that! You can't suspend us not for a month!"
DAMN… just freaking great!
"Surprise." He said.
"As I was saying… That guy is none other than Draco Malfoy. AKA the prince of Slytherin, and the number one heartthrob in Hogwarts. Girls, mostly in Slytherin including those two goes after him every single time. He is also the son of a billionaire politician, another factor that attracts admirers." Ren said.
Sirius just looked away again.
"Nice to see you too, Cedric." I said, smirking at the vice-president.
"Okaaay,"Harry said. "Help you hide from who exactly?"
"Mmmm, Draco, more…" I said gasping as he pushed all the way in without warning. "Ah… o-ow…" I said as the pain of the situation hit me.
"This." Millicent said as he crumpled the article. "This is what you're stressing around for?" She said throwing it to the nearest trash bin. "There is just no fucking way that this is true." She laughed.
"Them…" I pointed at the group of people in the center of the ballroom… inside a huge-ass tent.

Harry looked at her cautiously as she drank from her tea cup. 'This is girl who will play mother to me?' Harry thought. 'She is a lot different from my mom…' He thought again taking a second glance at Tonks. 'This…is going to be awesome!' He thought smiling. 'My mom doesn't really know how to stand for her own. Maybe Tonks can teach her how to do that.'
'What the hell?!' I thought as Draco's lips met mine, and his lips were really soft. The kiss was short and chaste but passionate. I moved away first, I saw that we were both flushed red, we took a few short breaths before we kissed again, but this time it was rougher, more passionate and hot, I really don't know how but somehow after a while we were battling for dominance. His mouth tasted like chocolate, but I really don't mind.
"That hurt." He said as he sat up. "I'm sorry, okay; I'm sorry, now can we just sit here on the lake side." He said gesturing for me to sit on his side. I obliged.
"Is the wig really that bad?" I asked, looking really embarrassed.
"Will you two stop the PDA it's inappropriate." Hermoine said.
"Why didn't I felt them vibrate?" He said looking at both of his phones.
"I'm so sorry dear, but the results are clear and final. And apparently, people know who you are Ms. Black." She said looking straight to my eye. "And they either wants to make you, break you or even worse…" she took a short pause before she said the next words which frightened me to the core. "Destroy you."

"Keep whining and I'll kick you out of here…" Sirius said with a serious tone.
"So, why is this shit not starting yet?" I said, trying to change the subject. "You're pig of a boyfriend might have already eaten everything before the program even started.
room)
*The Business Guild- a club made for the exclusively for children of rich families that belonged in Slytherin, it only uses the name as a disguise… it has everything rich brats couldn't get inside the school. Like all kinds of luxury available at their homes (Jacuzzis, liquor etc.). Since only club members can enter a club's remises. The club rooms cannot be inspected without the proper paper work; which means that the Business Guild's club room was never inspected by the staff.
"From the same designer."
"Yeah, it was something I watched on YouTube a while ago. And I admit it I downloaded it using a converter… I know it's illegal but hey, I really liked it; and I featured it in my blog and I couldn't find it anywhere so…" Draco said while blushing and scratching the back of his head.
(Green Knitt Mall)
He hovered over me and kissed me hard after he ripped my shirt open, making buttons fly everywhere. I really didn't know where my coat is and how I lost it, but as Dray said. I stood back and enjoyed the ride. Then he pulled my pants down together with my underwear.
"STEAL! What do you mean 'steal'?" Hermione shouted. "Remember the last time you stole shoes from your brothers?"
"Not only is she President, but she is the ONLY president that isn't from the Ravenclaw."
"Shut up will you!" Sirius blurted out. Then he looked behind him after he realized what he did.
"Hello sir." I said with a smile. I almost forgot that my "Father" supposed to be in the military.
"Sorry Herms, I-" Ren didn't even finish her sentence before Hermoine shouted again.
"You really expected me to help you two?" The boy asked amusement clear in his voice.
"Why?"
"Are you sure you can still eat that much?" Ron asked looking disbelievingly at me.
"He really thought his words could kill." The shorter guy said making both of them laughed. They just smirked mockingly at me when they noticed my stare. They just walked passed me as I glare daggers at them.
The one I wanted to have me,
"I will study as Hogwarts, one way or another. I'm going to show dad that I'm much better than he think I am." Harry replied with a serious facial expression.
"Not anymore…" He then got out of the dark and stood beside me. Then I noticed him wearing the black coat that he bought from me, over a slightly unbuttoned white shirt with sapphire buttons(courtesy of his missus(snickers)), plain black slacks and a pair of leather shoes.
The next day, I was really shocked at what I saw, which definitely ruined my weekend vibe.
Auditor: (2nd to 4th year)
"Don't worry; even if they found out, you won't be expelled." Sirius shouted from the kitchen, making himself some coffee.
"I told you never to call me that in public!" Ron both shouted and whispered at her.
We parted again to take a few breaths before I pushed us both towards her bed.
Hermoine spoke first after she put her black berry curve down. "What does this mean?" She asked.
"Amazing?"
Why? Because everybody's staring at me like I'm from outer space. For what reason? I don't have a fucking idea. But whatever the reason is; it might be as epic as a nuclear explosion.
"I really don't give a shit about genre. If I like a song I listen to it no matter what it was." Draco explained. "Now will I
Chapter 4: Hogwarts…
"Enough, Pansy." Millicent said. "Tom, you know that even if you didn't help us expel her, we'll find other ways to get rid of her, right?" She said.
But after a while we did it again and somehow we ended up in my bed. He moved away first this time and started kissing my neck. He bit it a little, then he sucked it. His hand moved from my hips to my waist as his kiss moved down to my collar bone. His hand moved to my stomach.
"No sweat, it's not my money; it's the twins'. They said since it was their idea, they should pay for it… but I'll have to pay for mine though…"
"Draco, I don't remember saying yes to be your bo-girlfriend…" I said, the word almost slipping on the word "girlfriend".
I was born a son of one of the best and manliest man in the world… and I know he would flip out if he ever knew about this, but… this is actually the first time that I will do something that I really want, the first time that I'll do something for me and not for somebody else.
"See ya later." Ron said as he stopped in front of his room.
"If it's just the gimmicks and the publicity, I know the people." Ron said smiling at me.
I walked the dark trails of the forbidden, searching for my princess… in the middle of the dark… What the hell…
I took a deep breath, and then I took my hand from the receiver. "What do you want? And how did you get my number?"
"And we need to fix your real hair." Gray said.
"I'm always game for some alcohol." I said sniffing a little.
She said as she put the phone down.
"Oh. Harry." I said. A little bit relieved.
"Damn!" Harry shouted as he kicked the door. "I thought that will never work."
"We are not really sure about that!"
"Hey Blaise." I said. "It seems like you don't have the weasel with you today."
He didn't battle me for dominance this time; he let me take the lead. I obliged by exploring the mouth I fantasized about in the shower, the hot cavern that's Draco Malfor's mouth.
"Can I stay here for a while?"
"They might." Ron said as he put a whole shrimp in his mouth. "Mmm… so good." He moaned.
"Okay, I'm sorry… now will you please answer these?" She said handing both Harry and Ron the papers. They both sat in front of the nearest table and began answering the survey.
"Just answer me!"
"And what do you think we should do about this." I said gesturing to the hard little Harry who has his own way of thinking.
"Yep, they are my twin older siblings, Faith and Gravity." Ron said gesturing to the two. "Faith is a jewelry designer and craftsman, while Gray is a photographer, and hair and makeup artist. Also most of the shoes in the clothing line is either designed or made by them." He explained.
Right at this very moment a very angry woman, with brightly colored purple hair is stomping towards the Black Manor, followed by a worried, tall, brown haired man.
"H-how did you-" I said as I turned my head to look 'Disbelievingly' at him.
"Blaise liked the view…" Ron said covering his face with the dolphin. "But sadly he needs to perfect it now! If he wants to survive during the pageant and his competitor is Bulstrode, a trained one in that sort of business." Ron added to my already high misery. "I really feel bad for letting that bitch wear my clothes. She doesn't deserve it; remember what she and Parkinson did to my design room, collection and models last time! And they even tried to blame me!" He shouted pointing at himself for the last word.
"Yes."
"Oh you'll see." Hermoine said.
(My pov)
"Alright, but where did you get the papers?" Harry asked.
"Weird" He said out loud as shifted positions taking his Corby 2 and looked at his latest wallpaper, smiling in the process, as he looked at the 'perfect being' on his opinion, on his screen. No one saw it but as soon as he saw the boy in one of his breaks from his rounds, he immediately snapped a photo.
"We'll meet each other in the accessory department of the department store. We'll just have to take orders." George said.
"Oh, Harry…" He said worriedly at me. "You know you'll always have family in me and Herms. We'll always be here for you." He said rubbing my arm soothingly.
"Yep, but that was a mixed competition." Ron said.
"Hey kiddo. What are you doing here?" Serius said behind Harry.
"Man that's really stupid." I said and sighed.
"You know if I just walk the way I'll be in there much faster." She said back to him.
"Yep, all of my siblings, that's how we were raised by our parents. They raised us with love, sooo no one in the family will never have the right to hate another." He told me, with the widest smile I've ever seen in him. "Even if we do stupid things, even if we're the worst kind of people. We'll still know that whenever we go home, my mother's hot stew and forgiveness will always be on our dinner table. That's the true essence of family, someone to always come home to."
I want it to be real, to be something I'll remember forever, to be something to cherish if we ended up together. And something to bring me pain if we ended up apart.
"You'll still graduate, but they won't let you go. You'll get extra training. Then they'll test you again if you pass then you may go and leave. If you fail again then you'll stay and train until you get it right."
"Yeah, grumpy, it's not… but isn't that paper due three days ago?" He shot back as his lip glossed lips curve into a smirk. "You're lucky
"There were no slots left. For boys, that is." Harry replied.
"Will you please FUCKING repeat that?" I asked.
"Hey, do you like my job?" Ron asked from behind me.
"On Sunday. At the park near your past Elementary school."
"Meaning?"
Ron shouted in pleasure.
"To the council's monthly meeting; I'm taking you as my date. Now just get in the car."
Harry knows that he might look like a stalker right now, but he just couldn't help himself. He glanced at the clock and saw ten minutes before eight. He hurriedly got up from his bed and took his phones in his pockets.
"Mmm," I heard him moan to the kiss, as he put his arms around my waist to support me; which encouraged me to go further. This time I'm the one who begged entrance but tugging on his lower lip. Which he give after I put one of my arms down cup his ass, making him moan, which all it took me to shove my tongue in his mouth.

." Draco said making Harry's already blushing face even redder.
"Wait!" Sirius exclaimed, "I won't let this woman, with an outrageous way of dressing up, choose our Harry's clothes. No way!"
"We need a plan." Hermione said looking straight at me.
"How the hell does that work?!" Ron asked, in a little bit too high voice.
"Hi Babe…" Ron said as he turn around and kiss Blaise's cheeks. "Hannah dear has the same dilemma again."
"You know, for the short time I've been with you, I already knew it when you are lying or not. Wanna know why?" She said with a smirk.
"Nice choice by the way." He smirked.
"Asswipe."
"Look at those bimbos." Ren said pointing at the two *cough* ladies we talked to earlier. "Poor girls." She said as she shakes her head.
"And do I have a choice?"
"What's happening?" Harry asked.
"You wanna know what else he's eating tonight?" He smirked.
"I know you've been disowned. I'm asking WHY you have been disowned. What happened?" Serius explained, a little bit annoyed. "Okay, if you're not comfortable about it now, let's talk about it tomorrow, no big deal." He said again.
"What? What else do you want me to say?" Sirius replied.
Harry followed the man, obediently. He glanced at Sirius looking a little bit worried, but Sirius just smiled.
"Phew! That was close." He said as he tries to catch his breath.
"So, what are we going to practice?"
'What do those petty bitches want? Didn't they even understand the term second rate?' I thought .
"Ms. Black," The registrar said looking suspicious on the paper she's holding. "I didn't know you have a child." She said again looking at Sirius.
"Oh, Hannah! I was afraid that I got the wrong number." OMG! How the Hell did HE got my number!?
"No problem Father." I said.
"Shut up."
A few minutes after the opening speech of the school's board of directors, the faculty and the president and vice, the whole place went back to that noisy bargain market-like place it was before, with people asking waiters for food and alcohol. Our dates were allowed to come to stage ten minutes after Ced-Celine's speech.
"Who's that?"
"I see you're ready." Malfoy greeted me. And damn he looks really delicious in that black slim suit, and man! Some of his luscious fair skin is peeking from that unbuttoned beige under shirt, and that hair of his makes it even worse. I need to look away before my underwear becomes too tight.
eavesdrop on Sirius and Remus' alone time. A kiss that don't relate to sex, but just a sweet reminder that they like each other… wait a minute… scratch that! Why the hell is he kissing me? From my point of view I thought he doesn't like me much.
"Uh Dray what are you doing here?" Blaise says looking pass me. I turned around and saw him, the prettiest guy in the world! I didn't realize that I was staring until Hermoine patted my back. I surely hope he didn't notice it!
Public Relations Officer: (2nd to 4th)
"Dancing, how to move in the gala, etcetera." Draco explained.
"Are you stupid?" Hermoine snapped.
"Hmmm… I wonder how you'll prove that."
"What do you mean?" I asked Ms. Eves the grumpy looking woman, with a thick rimmed glasses and wearing a really t ight bun on her hair which looked like it hurt, by the way.
"Nothing. I just thought that, you will have..."
"Ren!" Hermoine blushed, and punched Ren's arm.
-0-0-0-0-0-
"By the way, as we reach the restaurant, leave your things in the back seat." He said as I entered the car.
If you were wondering why she suddenly called Ren, Ron, is because HE Renelle Weasley is actually a Ronald Weasley. Just like me he is in disguise just to study here, which explains HIS father's noticeable stutter when he talked about Ron.
"Ha. Ha. Fuck you."
"Hey are you free this week?"
"The best view I've ever seen." He said as he looked at my naked body, making me blush a little.
I continued walking and I suddenly felt the urge to visit the lake. What brings out the urge? I really don't know but I suddenly thought that with a moon like this; the lake must really look beautiful. So I walked there.
"No… I don't think so, maybe he's constipated." I said making him laugh. Which earned us two some spanks on our shoulders. Aside from that, he called only us for recitation, of things that has zero possibility of us knowing; ASSHOLE; a fucking huge asshole that looks like he's got a stick up his ass.
"Sirius... YOU MISTER ARE A DEAD MAN!"
"So do you." He said as he kissed my free hand. "Not to mention that you smell terrific."
There will M scenes here, not lemons but not as light as the previous chapter.

"I don't know what the hell you're talking about." Harry said as he looked away from Draco.
"WHAT?" Both sang in unison.
Malfoy took my hand and we walked together inside.
"Yes, she did…" He replied. "Won't you go run after her?"
"I'll let you use the bronze dress that I personally created and sowed. Now feel free to thank me!"
"Okayyyy…" Harry said while playing with his fingers.
I wonder why most of the girls here follow me around. I'm not actually very handsome. President Riddle is… but maybe his "I'm the Mad Scientist!" tendencies may contribute to lesser fans, but he's two times better than me in almost everything except sports and conversational skills. So I really don't understand why I have more fans, which is really annoying since they follow me around 24/7, not to mention that they do all sorts of things just for me to notice them…
"Call the boys; tell them to meet us in the science room later." Millicent said as she walked pass the tree.
And now here I am… thinking weather am I going or not… this
"Dray!" He tried to protest, but stopped and turns to moans as soon as I sucked harder. While kissing his neck, I moved my free hand towards his left nipple making him moan even louder, his blush going a deeper shade of red. "D-Dray… more… p-please." And that's my cue to go to the next level.
"What fuck is wrong with you?"
-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-
-" he almost screamed, but he covered his mouth with his hands.
"You're just numb from sitting around all day." Ron said looking bored, with a hand under his chin.
Okayyyy..... so, this is the latest chapter of this story.... meaning the slow chapter by chapter updates starts here. I haven't written the next chapter so, please don't get tired of waiting and please tell me what you think....
President." Millicent finally spoke. The venom in her voice was perfectly visible.
"I'm here to get you from that creature." He said pointing at Ron. "And I'm also here for this creature." He said pointing at Hermoine. "Didn't you get the emergency message from McGonagall?" He said waving his iPhone in the air. And just on cue, both Hermoine and Blaise took their phones out.
"No." I sniffed. "No Dray, I'm sorry." I said wiping my tears away.
Those facts she stated really made me feel better… Not!
"Yeah… so did yours." I replied with a smirk of my own.
I knew about these meeting, even Ron does, Hermione told us about these parties. But I never really thought I could be a part of it. Hermione said that even they don't know it's scheduled, until they receive a text from someone from the faculty.
"Oh about last time, mind telling me, why you can't have the one you love?" I said in a low voice, bluntly.
"Okay, see you later!" Ron said as he sat on the lounge chair, and Nastasia sat in front of him and began giving him a pedicure.
"Hey, just learned it the same time as you are babe." Blaise replied raising his arms up.
Minutes later they heard the girl shout aloud.
It was already free period when I reached the design room. I quickly walked towards my friends, who quickly noticed my state, bugged me the whole afternoon, then dragged me to my pinktastic room… I was automatically obligated to tell them EVERYTHING(starting from my humiliating fall, beside the fucking lake).
"What…" Gray said.
"Okay, there is still one but I rather not talk about it here." I said as I looked around. "Someone might hear me."
"I-I love you too." He said after he coughed a little.
And that sight is my room… my pink and fab room. Courtesy of my momma, Ms. Nymphadora Tonks, since each student will stay in only one dorm room for the rest of his stay, every student is allowed to decorate his room any way he wants… so my surrogate mother took charge and colored my room pink, baby blue, and lavender. But mostly pink. My wall paper is electric pink with watermelons on it, it is decorated with gold and silver frames, which have stars, hearts or dolphins all over them, inside these frames were pictures of Remus, Sirius and Tonks herself. My book shelf is covered with lavender, pink, and light blue see through fabric that have dolphins on the corners, my window has a layered pink and purple curtain with gold stars hanging from them, my door has pink and blue fuzzy wires on it that forms the words STRONG & BEAUTIFUL, and had hearts on it, my desk has baby blue covers with under the sea patterns, my pencil holder has teddy bears on it, my pens and pencils has blue, pink, and violet shiny covers, my ACER laptop courtesy of Sirius has beads and butterfly patterns, my new phone which is a white Samsung Corby 2 has a pink case. And my bed has apple green covers with electric pink linings, pillows have the same patterns and on the bottom left corner is a very large teddy bear in ballet outfit, on top of it is a blue canopy with silver stars, my dresser is a made of white wood with two doors and a large mirror on the left door.
“Ron, truer friends cannot be found anywhere.  You and Hermione have always defined me.  You both always will.  I need Hermione’s mind, quick wit and knowledge.  Your friendship, companionship and strategy… With you I don’t have to be an adult all the time.” Harry gave his friend a lopsided grin… Which the redhead promptly returned and tried punching Harry in the arm…
“The next what?  What kind of vision” Sirius asked looking baffled.
“I have no better words than the truth Professor, but your happy memories will not bring the balance to your bad ones, with so few as you have.  I understand your closed nature, your privacy, but we need to build up some happy memories, no matter how small.” Harry stated, trying his best not to offend, “We can work on some over the weeks before we have our next session.  Find things that make you happy, even as small as playing a chess game with someone you like or trust.  The balance is important to your occluding wall, the less happy memories you have in your wall, and the weaker it is.”
Draco had entered his dorms, he was still floating it seemed.  There was no way he could forget that kiss.  Everything inside him responded to Harry.  He was so sure that Harry had felt nothing, but understanding dawned with that kiss.  Harry was just focused, on one thing, his task.  Draco would make sure not to distract him… too much.   Draco wanted more, and he usually got what he wanted.
Harry growled when those hands gripped him, He brought Draco up by his hair and slammed his mouth onto Draco’s.  He took advantage of the gasp and let his tongue plunder the depths of Draco’s heat.  He took his time, biting and sucking on Draco’s tongue, drinking in the steady streams of moans coming from the blond.  He pulled away from Draco’s tempting mouth to whisper in Draco’s ear.
"Then you already know my answer." Sirius said laughing. "So what's your plan?"
My mouth moved from his neck towards his right nipple, which made him gasp. "
"But-" Pansy tried to reason but someone cut her off.
So now I'm in trouble, because every single fucking time I look at this lady, every quality I'm looking for seem to surface, like she was meant to be that perfect lady without even trying. And that is definitely an achievement for someone to please a Malfoy without even trying.
"Where? When?"
"Oh, I'm oozing with it darling." I smirked.
Good thing I went incognito… because if Sirius ever come here and check my computer, and I didn't went incognito… he might freak out and drag me to the nearest church for a confession… or worse… take away every gadget here… and make Remus see everything, which might land me in even more trouble…
"And…" I heard a male voice say.
"That's not the issue here." Pansy said as she held up a torn article from the day's school paper. "This is!" Millicent took the paper from her friend, she read the title and laugh at what she saw, making Pansy look at her as if she was crazy.
"Oh sweet Mione…" He said.
I looked at myself in the mirror in the suit I chose among the bunch. It was a gray tailor cut suite, with slightly tight slacks, black shoes and an emerald green tie.
"But, hey can you give me some tips on how to… you know; do it? I really wanna do it with him with no interruptions."
"I wish I'll have that kind of family someday." I smiled sadly at him.
"Don't say that smart ass' name in front of me." He hissed.

Now, ENJOY!
"Well Susan might be sweet, but when she gets angry she might lose control." The V.P. said.
(MY POV)
"The time with you I spent,
"Well, since you've been dressing like a girl for a while. I figured you must've missed wearing clothes like that. And i don't want you to forget yourself and your past completely. And I rented the whole place so you can be yourself while eating good food. And I know you'll get into trouble if someone saw you as a guy." I really didn't know when I started crying but as soon as he finished talking, he looked worriedly at me. "Don't you like it?" He asked.
"Thanks Mom…"
"Shouldn't they be expelled, those were high crimes." I said, remembering the second time I saw Ron, the broken version of him, with his babies, his works that's been trampled on the floor. And my chest tightened. 'I might not take that well.' I thought since that might happen to me.
"Dray what are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be on patrol duty?" Blaise asked as he looked strangely at the person behind me. I turned around and saw him… The owner of those captivating silver orbs… It took me reaaaaalllyyy long before I realized I was staring with my mouth open. I hurriedly snap my mouth shut.
"There's school tomorrow."
"Why would she want another meeting, a few minutes after we had the council assembly?" Blaise said as he passed his Nokia Lumia to Ron.
"I just wanna know my baby's condition… sorry for not calling in months… your stupid father took my phone away. Sooo I just bought a new one." I really can't help the smile that's tugging on my cheeks right now.
"I just wanna hang out for a while."
Sirius suddenly stops on his tracks, digesting the sudden shocking information. "You have been WHAT!" Sirius shouted.
"Why did you make me wear this? And why did you rent the whole restaurant just for the two of us?"
"AHHHH!" I screamed as I woke up in the darkness of my room. 'This is BAD!' I thought as I stare at the ceiling, I looked at my bottom half and saw little me standing strong and hard. "Damn!" I shouted. I stood up and went straight to the light switch; I turned the light on and lost my erection at the sight that bombarded my eyes.
She slid forward and reached for them.
Before Albus could say or ask any more questions, there was a tap at Harry’s wards. Harry looked up at the headmaster, “I won’t say much until I reflect on it, sir, if you don’t mind. I will need to refresh myself with where we are with this year. This is the year of Umbridge as Defense teacher, am I correct?” Dumbledore nodded, “And we have only been in school a few weeks right?” another nod, “Sir, I know you're used to knowing everything, but for once, trust me. Trust me to do the job I was born for, and fill you in when I need to. I have a feeling that this ‘sight’ is something I need to keep to myself and work around things. I may get to do some things better, and save more lives this time around.” He waved his wand to drop the ward. Professor Umbridge in her pink attire was standing there tapping her foot impatiently. “Professor, I think you can fill me in, for the sake of the ministry and this student?” She demanded.
Severus narrowed his eyes on Ron, “Describe his eyes, Mr. Weasley.”
Ron seemed to relax a bit, “I guess that makes sense, we are better than that.  I won’t guarantee anything though... other than I’ll try.”  Ron was not happy, but he would be better, see past the urge to put all Slytherins in the same bucket.  At least he would try.
Mr. Malfoy looked down at the small coin.  The significance was not lost on him, one Augur created a coin for safety and love, and another for communication and safety.  He did not suspect the boy to understand the significance in that moment, but looking at his wife, she too understood.  Gifted magical coins were a sign of trust.  It would be up to them to maintain the value of loyalty that lay in that coin.
“I had planned on a quick, peck and be done with it,” Draco stated, wanting to back away.  His stomach was in knots, his brain was mush, and his body sang.
Looking out from the empty tower, down onto the ground.  Dumbledore’s broken body lay askew, his once twinkling eyes empty and dead.
“That he actually got dressed up to apologize,” Snape said, and Harry caught something in those eyes, that he probably should not press.  Snape had evidently liked the fact that Sirius had dressed up, the soft rose tinge to his Professor’s cheeks were the indication.
Harry turned, leaving a pensive Professor in his classroom. As he made his way to the great hall, he caught a flash of bright blond in the hallway.
His body reacted to each footfall on the stairs.  His cock ached and dripped, his arms ached in an almost pleasurable pain as he held them behind his back.  He looked up with so much longing when Harry pushed open the door.
“Sir, thank you for helping me with this. It is much appreciated.” Harry said. He pulled a parchment from his robes and handed the list to Professor Snape.
“She was given a choice… there was much darkness in her.” Harry stated, “Yes, she experienced the Augur’s touch.”
“I need you, please.” Draco whimpered.
“I do not know if he plans on going himself to the Dursley’s or sending a team of Death Eaters...I will know more when I pass what Information we want him to have.” Severus explained.
“Nope, that’s what Saturdays are for.  Lying in bed, eating in bed, dreaming in bed, reading in bed...only getting up for the loo.” Sirius answered, grinning and laughing.
“I never had this with her or anyone. Vision or not..” Harry breathed the words over Draco’s ear as he held his husband close. He felt the blond melt in his hold. So he licked the shell of Draco’s ear and smiled when he felt the shiver.
Harry’s eyes widened and then a wicked smile came to his mouth as Narcissa’s words penetrated his mind.    He wrote a reply to Mrs. Malfoy and tried to make it as readable as possible. He sent it off before he even opened the one he knew belonged to Draco.  No matter what it would say, he already knew his reply.  He scrawled it onto a small piece of parchment and sealed it with his wand.  The impression his magic left on the letter made the seal look like a kiss.  That would either shut the blond up or enflame him even more.  Harry laughed and then read through Draco’s letter.  It was more polite, but not what he wanted out of the arrogant prat.
Harry noted the shift, “I ask not for riches, Mrs. Malfoy, but an artifact lies in her vault that is necessary for the fight. I have firsthand knowledge of where it is and what it is, other than that, I want nothing to do with her other items.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco asked, leaning in Harry’s embrace and stretching out his legs a bit.
“I don’t want to, Harry.” Draco cried out softly.  His body on fire, waves of pleasure coursing through his veins.
“I feel, Draco...  Everything…” Harry whispered, lips close, eyes locked on to silver.  Draco’s tongue darted to lick his lips and Harry came undone.  He pressed close, hard, and took those lips as his own.  He dominated the kiss, tasting, coaxing, and drinking in each moan, and breath that was given to him.  He kept hold of Draco’s hands with one of his own, and traced down a bare arm where the robe had fallen away, with the other, giving him more gasps to drink in.  He was breathing Draco, taking in his breath and exchanging it for his own.  The sensual moment was making him dizzy with need, and every part of his body began to sing and tingle.  Harry’s free hand moved to trace the soft angles of Draco’s face. Skin so soft beneath his fingers, his lips moved purposefully trying to feel each crease of Draco’s lips.  Harry’s lips slowly left Draco’s, breathing labored, he moved his head to rest against Draco’s forehead.
Mrs. Malfoy stood then, and walked over to Harry.  He stood still waiting for her response.  He did not move when she reached for something inside her cloak.  She pulled out a box, and Harry felt it. Lucius flinched, and Dumbledore’s eyes narrowed.  The evil aura that bled from the box was unmistakable.
"I see that you're having hard time on such a simple problem, Ms. Black." Professor said behind me. "Might as well work that artistic brains of yours to the brink, or else you might get even lower than C-." He said with a straight face.
"Isn't that a professional competition?"
"Thank you ma'am, I will never disappoint you." Harry said with glee before leaving with Sirius.
"Thanks anyway." I smiled.
The kind of suite I would wear as Harry Potter.
"All I ask is for you to pass, for you to get in my high school, for you to raise our family's flag, and to make the Potter name shine again. But what did you do? You FAILED, you FAILED the exam!" James yelled even louder.
"Oh, I'm sorry. I just thought that you were not as innocent as that." Ron said.
"That, my love, was your prostate." He said, with his usual smirk.
"Ass…" Draco said while cocking his head to the sideways in an absolutely adorable way. "I'm not an ass; you're just not ready yet."
"Looks like you're being set aside." I smirked… oh my signature smirk.
"Oh, don't worry it's fine." Ron answered, which made the girl's smile wider. "Well, that's nice to know. Okay, if you guys ever had problems in bullying, feel free to go to my office." She said as she walked away.
Ron pushed the close button as soon as we got inside the elevator.
"WHAT THE HELL!" Hermione shouted as she emerged from the student affairs office besides the bulletin board. "I can't believe it!" She said crossing her arms in front of her chest. Her eyes in a fixed glare the looked like it may shoot lasers out any minute.
Speaking of scratches, it's been a week and mine wasn't healed yet, it turns out that the wounds were deeper than I thought… bummer…
"Nice to meet you too." He said.
We drove LOUDLY for another two hours before we reached Hogwarts.
"Hi, I'm Blaise Zabini." The guy said putting his right hand out.
"Why in hell did you sent Cho to get us!?" I shouted at Tom.
"Sirius may I ask you a favour?"
"How about I'll make you see it tonight. Let's go out, maybe eat some dinner, watch movies, and maybe drink a little."
0-0-0-0-0-0
"Will you stop about the ass reference?"
"Oh, thanks. Ren designed it, yours to."
"That?" Ron said.
"I might never get a chance to be a mother. Because the one I like is already taken." She said with a smile. "Sadly I'm too picky and won't settle for anyone less. And that killed my chance for a family." She explained. "So please, don't act like a stranger around me, you can tell me anything. I know I'm not your mother, and even if you tell me something I won't support it if it's wrong. But I'll be with you till the end, because that's what I'll do for my child." She said it with such emotion that Harry couldn't help but smile.
"When? Where?!" Now I'm getting exited.
"We set it up as soon as I texted you." Fred explained. "Now, let's go home."
"No sex for
"Well, not all of us grope our lovers at every free second." Hermione shot back.
"Huh?" was all Harry can say, as Sirius pulled his arm.
"You just need three things for the first time aside from condoms… gentleness, lube and prep…" He explained. "If you don't know what I mean, you can always check the internet. Almost everything is there… if athletes foot treatment could be found there… you can also find gay sex pointers there." He said wiggling his eyebrows.
"These are the Blacks, Mr. Sirius Black, and Ms. Hannah Jennica Black, she's a freshman like yourself." He said, gesturing to the girl. She was wearing a vintage but beautiful white long dress with a lot of flower embroidery. She's also wearing a brown velvet belt, a gold brooch, a white leather shoulder bag, an emerald earring and an emerald ring. She held her hair up in a bun, but the front is undone.
"Yep… also known as the stuck up department." Hermoine said.
"Well I understand the poor girl's decision. After all who would want to get married with a self centered, childish and lazy bum like you?" The registrar remarked. This statement earned a scowl from Sirius and a loud laugh from Harry making Sirius' face red with embarrassment. "Alright. Ms. Black you have a very good record." She said with amazement in her voice. "You are good at football, playing the guitar, singing, acting, dancing and drawing. You also scored very high in the entrance exam. Scoring 98.56%. And you also have a high average from your previous school, 93.87%." She said with amusement in her voice. "Smart and full of talent," She said as she looked at Sirius. "Where did your genes go, huh Sirius?" She asked with a smirk, earning another laugh from Harry.
It's a nice sunny Wednesday morning, birds are flying chirping happily, the lake shines brightly and the wind hums lightly. And to top it all off, me and Draco are official, and he knows ALL of my secrets.
"Yes… I really do."
I looked at Tonks pleadingly, 'Please don't make me wear these pieces of shit!' I chanted in my head. Nothing looks weirder than a man wearing MCR black shirt with a pink clip on his head and a flower power bracelet. I already looked weird holding bags of designer brands, chosen by looking at the size on the tag, I won't be SEEN. In those clothes or my fucki'n name isn't Harry Potter!
"You've been eating that since last night?"
"That's not the point." I sobbed. "That is the main reason I can't do this, I can't keep doing this to you!"
"You ASSHOLE!" I shouted as I elbowed him. Making him fall on his ass. "You knew, you knew and you didn't tell me, earlier! You waited for me to cry before you told me!"
(Class)
"Do something bad, and I'll give you proper punishments." The boy said seriously.
"Yep and it happened for two straight weeks." I groaned. The dream doesn't happen frequently a month ago, but I guess it worsen after seeing him do his rounds every day.
"Uhm…" He said trying to fiddle with his pockets. "Here it is!" He said waving a condom.
"What members?"
"Don't worry, I'll keep that as a regular reference."
"Because if we sent little, sweet Susan there again you might not come with her right away." Tom said. "Now just sit here and make a show."
"No reason, I'm already used to this anyway." She said as she smiled, she stood up and took her bag(which were miraculously clean)from the floor. "Thanks." She said as she walked away.
Right now she was currently sinking her teeth in a fish fillet in white sauce. I to be honest, I haven't seen a girl eating like this in a formal occasion… but hell yeah! I like girls who are fearless and talented.
"Those two stuck up bitches don't live up to the name of their department…" Hermoine sighed as we walked toward an unoccupied table.
"Nymphadora Tonks." Sirius said.
"Yo! Old man, what was the entire ruckus about?" Harry asked as he entered the room.
"Bitch! Let go of my hair, this costs more than your face!" Ron yelled, as he turned around and grabs a hold of Pansy's hair.
"Oka-" I didn't even finish my word as Ron grabbed my arm and pulled me towards my door.
He just drove silently throughout the whole ride, as I watch the sun set. I was leisurely watching the sky change in color until the roof of a parking lot blocked my way.
The hotel he took me to was, well you guessed it; a five star hotel. But thank goodness it doesn't cause much staying here.
-0-0-0-0-0-
"Hey, hey, hey!" Sirius said as he opened his door and followed Remus out. "Dora if the traffic moves and I'm still away, you drive." He said as he ran off.
'Sadly… I didn't. I never did. Can this day get any better?' I asked myself as I smashed my head on my desk, which backfired immediately when pain shot up to my head. "Shit!" I hissed, Ren patted my back.
"Guess you did." He said as dived back to kiss me again. This time it was Hard, hot and needy. He bit my lower lip begging for entrance, which I gladly gave him. We battled for dominance for a while, no one wanting to give up. But as usual. I lost.
"Well I'm just here to look for my
"Really need to be the embarrassing best friend, aren't you?" He asked.
"What did you do to that poor hair extension?" Fred asked.
I imagined the heat of the water to be that of Draco's, while he's embracing me; while he's making me feel important and loved… making me feel the feeling that my own family refused to give me.
there seemed to be a short pause before she spoke again.
"Another sigh, Ron and I'll throw this French curve straight to your face!" Harry yelled at the love-sick teen by the window.
Okay… so this chapter will involve Draco and Harry's practice and a little peek of Millicent and Pansy "PLANS". And I swear this has "something" you'll like. Not lemon but likable... ;)
Unknown to them, two ugly souls were watching them. Plotting something.
So here we are again Hogwarts Academy the elite school.
Yep I had the usual flings and fucks. But hey! No one is yet to won Draco Malfoy's heart. Many tried but I doubt they ever will.
"You know already who it is."
"Every single day, I dance with you and hold you near me. Did you think I'll never notice?"
"Fine!" I huffed. "You have something with you?"
"Hello, may I ask who is calling?" Good thing he is on the other line… I feel like my cheeks were about to EXPLODE!
Now I'm really confused. I never thought that I'll ever wanna do this with a guy… never in my life have I thought that I might fell for a guy. And absolutely never did I think that I'd be willing to do this role for someone.
"No prob." Then he hung up on me.
"Are these slacks? And coats?" I asked myself as I looked at the clothing articles they slipped in my stall door. I took the bathrobe hanging in front of the mirror. I hurriedly got out bringing the clothes with me. I walked towards a sales lady.
"Well the uncompleted list on the bulletin board, it has been used as a teaser for the draw tonight." Hermione explained.
"Twin…" Faith said.
"Know what Tonks?" Harry said earning another look from Tonks. "You'll be a great mother." He said, truth shining in his eyes.
"Yes. Yes Dray, I'm a guy… I'm a cross-dresser I won't exist as Hannah Jennica Black after graduation. I won't even be able to… I'm so sorry." I said as I looked at him. He just stared back. "I understand if you quit as my partner, and I'll understand if you tell this to everyone." I said turning around to leave. But as I started walking I felt him pull my arm again; and embraced me from behind.
full moon… who knows what's out here at this hour, a werewolf? That would be cool…
She fell down, ass-first as I pulled her hair; never minded the ugly piece of crap that tried in VAIN to pull me away from her friend.
"Oh you know what I mean!" He shouted.
"What thing?" He asked by the way.
"You're an ass."
"Well at least I'm not the one who still clings to Malfoy even though she's been dumped more than 20ish times." Ren shot back. Making the other girl's face redden with anger.
"Fighting like an old married couple. Even though they are were only engaged." She said.
(After 15 minutes)

"Yep, wow."
"Did you hear that rumor?" Pansy asked as she banged the door of the *
"You are not stopping them, you should concentrate on me, bitch!" I heard Millicent said before I felt a blow on my face that made me fell on my ass. I just sat there dumbfounded as Ron and Pansy both stopped their riot and stare agape at me; Ron in disbelief, Pansy in amusement.
When I finally stopped the first thing I noticed was a lot of other students, from different departments circled around us, next thing I noticed was the damage I created to Millicent, which is not really that much, as she can still stand just limping a bit (only a
"I haven't fucked a guy."
"What makes you think that I won'?" I asked. Smiling at him.
"Uhm, excuse me but, what is a hair extension?" I asked, and honestly; I've been hearing the word a lot today and I do not even know what the hell that is.
Harry just smiled at his friend's message. He tried reply while he continued running, until he stumbled with a groan.
"Let's go! Here they come!" He said as he took my arm, ran out of the door straight to the elevator… and I freaki'n swear I heard a string of curses and 'come back here Ron!' behind us.
"By the lake, last night."
"What took you so long?" He said, taking a sip of his pineapple smoothie, handing me a strawberry one.
"Don't get me wrong babe, I like it when you take charge like that. It's just today I'm the one supposed to pleasure you. So just stand back and enjoy the ride." He explained as he stood there taking off his clothes, waaay too slow.
"I'm sorry sweetheart!"
"No one will come here at this hour
"Harry!" I heard Hermione called behind me. I turned around and saw her. And if I wasn't with the sexiest man on earth, I would think she's hot. She's wearing a gold gown with a slit that reached to the middle of her leg, the top of the gown has cobweb-like straps made of black beads, her hair was neatly styled on the left, she wears a four-inch high sparkly black sling-back wedge, and her make up; smoky eyes, long lashes, red lips… exquisite. "Draco."
"Please shout louder our other classmates didn't quite hear you!" He whispered-shouted at me. "Did something happen?"
"Oh really?"
"That I know when I can't have something, and I won't ever throw myself to something that doesn't want me!" I explained. "I know you'll back me up but let's be realistic!" I said.
"See you later too." I said waving my hand as I continue walking towards my dorm room. As I got nearer to it I saw someone pacing around in front of my door.
"I heard from my secretary that most of the girls that voted for Hannah were from Slytherin…" she sighed. "And they actually thought that it might be the best way to make their candidate win, and Bulstrode actually encourage some to vote for you because she wanted revenge." She said. "Then I went to the Student Affairs to represent the evidence we gathered but they rejected it without even seeing it, saying that they've already brought out the publicity and that would be a waste of money."
"Believe me I'm fine." I said. "And why did you thought I have a fever?" I asked.
"Common, just go there and kiss the lights out of the girl." He smirked at me… the fucking asshole.
By the end of the day I felt really drained. Like all my energy has been sucked out; one of the things that made me feel drained is that Draco is nowhere to be seen as of that moment. I just flopped on my bed when I reached it. Then I felt like sighing like a lovesick school girl but hey that's Ron's job. 'But since it's a nice day, why not go out, a walk would be nice.' I thought. 'A really great weather should never be wasted.' I thought as I stood up and walked towards my cabinet.
"Then…" Harry said, "You agreed with our plans." He said a wide smile evidently on his face.
And the internet I went. I went to a blog then followed a link and saw things I shouldn't have. I saw things from twinks, to double penetration, to BDSM… And I swear I need to rub some isopropyl alcohol all-over my eyes and brain to get rid of those disturbing images that would probably haunt me for the rest of my life.
"Yeah," I said as I stood up and walked towards the direction Hannah took. 'I won't take no for an answer.'
"And you'll both have a harder beating than Cho can give you." Tom said as he tried(in vain) to light a cigarette, only for it to be taken from him and thrown to the ground. "Noooo Smoking… I get it." He said as he faced the glare of Ms. Diggory.
"How do you get to do that… t-that thing with Zabini?" I asked my eyes closed. 'Please don't make me say it.' I mouthed, my fingers crossed.
"Harry, don't bother he's just on his menopausal stage." Ron whispered to my ear making me smile.
"Wow…"
We entered the door and I was DAZZLED in what I saw! A red carpet was right in front of us, there was a buffet table with all kinds of foods imaginable, a big chandelier with diamonds hangs in the middle of the ceiling with eight small ones surrounding it, the stage had a long wooden table where people, who might be the school staff, sat, and a lot of circular glass tables were at the sides. The pace is GINORMOUS! I stood there dumbfounded and amazed, while my three companions stood there clearly unaffected by everything.
"So true." I said. Their engagement hasn't really sunk in, but I support them, my dad even if they were best friends is another story. Even though he knew Remus dresses like a girl in order to stay in Hogwarts during their time there, and he didn't thought of it in a bad way, but sadly he really didn't thought that Remus will like another boy, which is his other best friend. He said they betrayed him, but only he is thinking that way, even Peter is fine with the engagement, he said he "Saw it coming". To make things short my dad is just a HOMOPHOBIC sucker.

"Are they allowed to have their own stock room?"
"Mind doing that faster." I demanded, which he didn't really listen to, as he went slower. Which drives me nuts! "Dray please I beg you come in here already!" I said motioning on my side.
-0-0-0-0-0-
"This is BAD!" Ron said as he looked at the bulletin board.
"Oh boy, this is bad." The brown haired man said, behind the door. "Harry, why don't you come here, the atmosphere might get a little scary, and I don't want you to see that, so come with me."
"Forget it Pans, we were not here for these losers," The other girl said as she look at me. "Hello there, we heard that you're a Black. I'm Millicent by the way, Millicent Bulstrode." The other l girl said. I narrowed my eyes at her and smiled.
I didn't really have a problem with finding the room for my first class. I just simply asked the people around me… another advantage I got in this dress up game. I came inside and got some stares which subsided as immediately as it happened. I saw some familiar faces including Hermoine's and Ren's(which looked nothing like it looked this morning).
He felt so humiliated.  Draco did not want to send it, and his fingers trembled as he attached it to the bird. She flew away and Draco sat down in his chair feeling drained.  The Potter he remembered would not have done that.  The Potter he remembered was strong but gentle.  He had always sneered at the gentle nature of Potter, but now when he needed it, he couldn’t count on it.  Beg him!  What could possibly possess Potter to say that? It was more of a Slytherin answer.
“Malfoy?” Harry asked loud enough for the person to stop. Sure enough his school nemesis stopped and turned around, sneering as he did so.
“Then do it today, it is Saturday and I am sure they are home,” Draco said with a smile.
Severus pulled out a bottle with a clear liquid in it.  He let go the stopper and three drops fell as Harry opened Vernon’s mouth…
Draco was already kneeling when he landed, it was on a soft plush carpet and he nearly lost it as he looked up. He almost came in his pants when he met the emerald gaze above him.  He heard a whispered “Fuck” and did his best not to smile.
Harry smiled. “So do you have major plans for the holiday?”
“I am working on the strategy to ensure everything is in place.  I am also looking to ensure any changes here on my side do nothing to upset the Dark Lord too much to discontinue his focus on obtaining the prophecy.  Everything hinges on that.  Any hints he could move faster than June on the prophecy would be appreciated.  Keeping him obsessed on the prophesy is key.  Other plan details are forming, and any that involve you, or your family, I will make you aware of.”  Harry explained.
Severus could feel it, pain was the power that hung over the room. It was suffocating, and cutting. His mutt evidently was drunk, and hurt. He remembered the words that had changed his world not so long ago.
“He isn’t here, get in before the neighbors start talking.” She said gruffly.
Harry shook his head for focus.  He looked up to see his professor wearing a smirk… He must look the worse for wear.  “Yes, thank you sir.”
“Let me know when you are ready, and I will enter your mind to get started”.
"I want to taste you," Draco said in a sultry voice.
Harry sobered a bit, “What is uncomfortable Ron, is watching my two best friends, who are clearly made for each other by the way, ignore their feelings for each other and live with the pain of being apart.  I want you both to be happy, and I know you will both make each other happy.”
As an Auror, this was one potion they could brew in their sleep along with the dittany, and he had Professor Snape to thank for being able to do it better than anyone else.  Now even his classmates stood a good chance at being able to do the best, after being afforded the best teaching by the best Professor.  A couple of times he had looked up and smiled at his professor. Though the man did not smile, he did quirk his lips.  There was no doubt that Professor Snape would see the potion results as a testament to how much better his teaching was.  In the end though, Professor Snape only nodded and accepted the potions as acceptable.
Sirius was surprised by the ferocity in Severus’ voice. That voice filled him with forgotten hope. Severus’ mouth was making his thoughts hazy, and his body could not seem to stop throbbing with need. Each sentence brought Sirius closer to his sanity. He clung tighter to Severus and gasped into Severus’ mouth. He let himself go, giving himself up to Severus. He surrendered then, to Severus, to his need to believe his dark prince… He needed, and when Severus plunged into him, his body and soul felt right. There was no Sirius Black without Severus Snape. He let Severus expose his neck, his body already shaking with need. When Severus finally bit him, his world exploded behind his eyes, and he became centered. He came with the thought that he was all Severus wanted. Sirius was not even down from his bliss when Severus moved in him. Heat continued to flow as if his body had not already erupted. Each push drove him further reaching for more and he came again with Severus filling him. He could not move, and did not want to. Sirius let his soul be calmed by Severus’ words as he was carried to their bed.
"To know who I am." Draco breathed out after a long guttural groan as his arse was pounded hard.
This change, it was beautiful, like warm butter sliding over Harry’s skin.
“Today we will work on just conjuring it.  The first step is to find your most happy memory.  It has to be powerful.  Once you have it, dwell on it, let the happiness of the memory fill you up.  Then one at a time, say ‘Expecto Patronum’ while pointing away from your partner. I’ll come by to give each of you tips on your posture and wand movement, and if you need help with the memory, I’ll do my best to guide you.” Harry said.
“For homework…” Harry looked up and smiled with a big grin. Severus rolled his eyes at the boy, “I want you to go through the memory bricks of this session, identify what was happy about those.  Small things, big things, events, or actions.  I need a list, I will guarantee my secrecy if you need, and then we can move forward with providing you the balance you need.”
“Do you love him?” She asked quietly.
Draco’s eyes were on Harry, curiosity, and apprehension.  He couldn’t look away, Harry’s green eyes held him.
She handed him the small coin. “Thank you, I will talk to the headmaster only, and once we receive your reply, we will get started. Remember, only the bad things will change from my vision, the good can only get better.” Harry stated.
“Someone was killed, you almost did it, but in the end, someone else carried out Voldemort’s request.” Harry replied.
Draco’s hand brushed his softly, though Harry couldn’t tell if it was intentional or not.  Harry’s finger felt like each nerve ending was sparking with electricity.  His eyes flew to Draco’s, he needed to know if the sensation was just him or did Draco feel it too.  The softening of Draco’s eyes and the upturn of his smile, spoke volumes to Harry.
“I can’t believe what that bug wrote about you...The Prophet is going too far attacking your credibility Harry!” Hermione was red-faced as she ranted about the latest article in the paper. Harry was being targeted on a smear campaign. He was sure the Minister had a hand in it, but he just smiled back at her. Dejavu was one thing… it was another to learn one’s lesson and get in between Hermione and her rant...He would at least keep his dignity this time around and not be blindsided.
“What did you do to me?” She asked as she grimaced rubbing her arms.
“Sirius.” Harry entreated the mirror.
Harry extended his hand and his quill flew into it. He penned a quick response at the end of the letter rolled it back up and tied it to the owl’s leg.  He handed a treat to the owl.
It was the truth; Draco could see the unwavering truth in Harry’s eyes.
“Do you want a pain potion for your arse?” Harry asked softly.
“Were there any Death Eaters?” Harry asked.
With that stalked loudly up the stairs, fear twisted in his gut over what he must say.
“Is he cheating now?” She asked trying to gain control of her emotions…The revelations were more than she expected, well she had not expected anything really.  Her sister… She could believe that of Lily… compassion was always there.  But her life, now would be upside down if she believed it all… Her life… a lie...No...
“RON!” Harry called the redhead out of an obviously embarrassing thought as he went as red as a cherry.
Severus had tried to make his voice toneless not to scare the brat, but Harry seemed to flinch and stiffen anyway, and his eyes did open...very wide.
Harry stood up, many eyes from the room shifted to their encounter.  Harry noted the defensive tension that Professor Snape exhibited out of the corner of his eye.  His Auror training still extended to his attention to details.  Professor Dumbledore, looked on with curiosity, and a twinkle, Harry had missed that twinkle.  Professor McGonagall made to get up, but Dumbledore's hand quietly laid on her arm to stop her.
“You did,” Harry said matter-of-factly.
Harry laughed and reached out to take his hand. “It’s been dead a while now, it isn’t going to do anything, trust me.” His green eyes were comforting when Draco looked up at him.
“For two years.”
“I need to talk to you Aunt Petunia.  Away from Uncle Vernon.” Harry said, emphasizing the word ‘away’.
Draco felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around, staring at two of his friends.  Blaise Zabini and Gregory Goyle.
His hands smoothed their way up the front of Draco’s legs, but Harry remained on his knees.  He stopped just before touching Draco’s aching shaft.  Harry moved his hands to cup the pale cheeks in front of him, and he bent down to kiss each side, laving the skin with his tongue.
Draco rolled his eyes, “It could have to do with that other coin my mother gave you, Harry.”
She hesitated, then chin up decided to test his resolve, “Not today Potter,” and stared at him.
“Harry.  Yes, but there is something important that concerns you and Uncle Vernon that I need to talk to you about. Today.” Harry said emphatically. He hoped that his presence was enough to encourage her to let them in.
Sign Here
Draco sighed then curled his arm tighter around Harry and smiled.
“Don’t go without the instructions I left after Arthur's departure.  You will need those as much as he will, and when you find what you are looking for, I’ll need the box.” Harry spoke firmly.  He knew the headmaster understood the importance of the matter, but he could not help but emphasize it.
Could he really pursue Draco?  Could he build something other than friendship right now?  Harry thought about that.  Voldemort again was the most pressing issue.  He would have to choose to focus there for now.  He wasn’t sure he could afford to spread his focus too thin.  He had plans to make, preparations to ensure, and He still needed to talk to Ron about strategy… Ron was an excellent strategist, or well... he would be.
“Care to exchange partners for the class? We might be able to spread some more gossip.” Draco grinned.
She was watching, the movements she knew well, but she had never cast one.  Only Aurors could, that was one of the spells they kept to themselves.  This professor always left her with more questions.
“The webbing is imbued with an unbreakable charm to ensure the threads do not break or fray, a charm that slowly disillusions your body, to imitate a fade to ghostly form, and then portkey you to a specific location beyond the fabric, while the third charm imitates and projects the assumed movement of your ghostly body form up to the top of the webbing.  There is also a charm that will hide the webbing when I activate it.  All these charms are added to each singular thread, so there is not a single thread left uncharmed.” Harry disclosed.
Harry smiled at all of them, turned to the headmaster and started, “Why don’t we all take a seat so we may feel more comfortable. Though you may want to stand Mr. Malfoy, as that is in your nature.”
Everyone took the moment to close their eyes and think.  Ginny was the first to try, and a slight white wisp appeared.  Hermione was the very first to succeed, her otter patronus wound its way through the group.  Draco looked at Harry, closed his eyes, and cast his charm.
Draco felt like he was drifting, he had thought to provoke Harry like old times for a reaction, but this…
Harry smiled, “That is called an Impervious Privacy Charm. Unbreakable by all except the caster. It is used by Aurors for interrogation purposes, but also when confidential information needs to be passed in public places. Give me a minute before you start asking questions. And I’ll explain a little not everything.”
Her demeanor tightened, “Of course.”
Mrs. Weasley backed off a bit and wiped her tears.
Harry landed softly on the green grass, it was a bright meadow of flowers. He could not determine his location yet. He turned around to find a very elegant, but cool Narcissa Malfoy standing to one side of the meadow.
She nodded, “I won’t make waves in whatever you are doing, Harry.  As a friend, you should know I won’t do that.  But I won’t accept it right away either until I’m comfortable.”
Pansy stiffened a bit, “Do I have a choice?”
“I don’t need the spell...Please…”Harry cried pushing back against Draco’s hand.
Her heart broke then… everything was true... her world was inside out and upside down… Her vision was already starting to go hazy from the mist gathering in her eyes...
Beside the older man was a sallow looking man.  He had short neatly styled hair that was a mix of grey and brown.  The man did not look altogether that old, but there was an ancient air about him.  He was tall, but not as tall as Dumbledore.
“You could have told me!” Hermione rasped.
Pansy squeezed her eyes shut, her hand went to her throat in a soothing gesture. “I … you obviously have won over Draco, I would consider myself more neutral than others, but I have yet to form my alliance, nor have my family.  I will consider carefully.”
“Sorry, I was just remembering some things.” Harry confessed. “Have you ever heard of a wizard Augur?”
It was empty, and filled with dust, which Draco cleared away quietly with his wand.  He helped Harry to sit in a chair in and waited.  He wondered if he should touch Harry, comfort him in some way.  The gesture rang awkward for him, so he waited.
"To feel."
“Mrs. Figg will let you stay with her I’m sure.  The papers need other formal signatures to release your vault.  I can call Dudley and let him know. What do you want Uncle Vernon to know?” Harry spoke softly.  She pulled away and sat down looking at her husband.  A coldness crept into her heart at the sight of the man, whale…He really was a whale… and Dudley would follow... She would do something… Her heart bore a viciousness that only a mother could feel as the faults against her family by this man were now laid at her feet.
“More anything...Please…” Draco begged. He needed the breaking.
“I’m sorry…” Sirius whispered against a pale shoulder…
Harry looked up and grinned.  He stood and pulled Draco into a sweet kiss before he heard a grunt come from his friend.  Harry just took it in strides.
“I’m not a girl, Harry.” Draco quipped.
Well that was reasonable enough. If anything he was good at getting out of bad situations. He just had to plan what to say. If the meeting with Arthur goes as planned, one horcrux will be taken care of and without the knowledge of Voldemort understanding what is happening. The Delayed repercussion potion will come in handy. He had to start brewing the potion needed today… that way by Friday it will be ready. So much for relaxation.
“I need to owl her,” Draco replied trying to sit up again.
A/N~ A continuation of the same day well it builds on the previous day where the last chapter lets off.. and there is one more chapter to this same day as well... Sometimes there is just a lot going on in Harry's world. :D  I thought I would share some things... When I write Harry and a little bit for Dumbledore, I listen a lot to Christina Perri's song Human...take a listen, it truly is my idea of Harry.  For the Magical scenes such as Umbridge or Dung... 'My songs know what you did in the dark' by Fall Out Boys.  Augur book and upcoming Merlin talks, Lily's Theme from the soundtracks...  Listening to these might give you a 'feel' for how I feel my perception of these characters.
“Harry my boy, just discovered a marvelous muggle candy you have to try… it’s a coffee nip...it’s delightful.” He said extending one towards Harry.
A/N~ The start to the eye in the storm... a bit more calm for now...but not without it's torment :D
Harry wondered if he was being foolish and that it would never work.  Just as he was to put it down, the scraggly face of his godfather appeared, as if just woken out of a dead sleep.  His heart soared at the sight.  Relief washed over him, mountains of guilt swept away by a wind of relief.
“Her vaults can only be accessed by the trustee of her estate, and that would be me as next of kin while she is incarcerated.” She answered.
“How did you think we could get him to drink the potion?” Harry asked.
Harry gave her a mischievous smile.
“Not at all.  Even Vampires must know how to kill a vampire from time to time.” the vampire’s expression was all easy smiles.
In that moment, there were no visions, no inclinations of the future, no ‘sight’.  There was only fire.  The fire was all consuming, reminiscent of the Fiendfyre.  Inside him it still burned, he was changed, touched, marked, and branded.  Though there were no outside marks, he still felt the branding down in his soul.  He would understand this, know this.  He would face Draco again, he could not let his fear of the unknown conquer him.
Harry quirked an eyebrow, then grinned, they were in for a pound now.
Draco sat down next to Harry, whose stomach was leaping at the closeness.  He could already smell Draco and his freshly washed hair that Harry’s fingers itched to touch.
Harry left and decided to spend some time in the Library researching his interesting change in Patronus.  He would also make sure his plans were in place for the preparations of the next Defense club meeting the next evening.
“It’s Hermione… She asked me out…” Ron stammered, face full on red as his hair.
Draco looked at Harry with a questioning look.
After they said their goodbyes Harry got ready for the next defense club meeting.  This would be an important one, Dumbledore would attend and so would Professor Snape.  It had to be perfect.
“Don’t move,” Harry growled out.  He rounded the other side of the bed and pulled Draco’s ass towards the other side.  He parted Draco’s thighs and growled an almost inhuman sound coming from his throat.  He bent down and in one swallow took all of Draco down his own waiting throat, he quickly staved off the blond’s orgasm and pulled back, savoring the taste on his lips.  He looked at Draco’s hole and let his saliva fall to coat the winking entrance.
“First to arrive, I see.  Did you plan that, or was I just the only one to grab the parchment on time.” He asked, his voice soft, his words playful.
Draco was lost, dizzy and entranced.  Nothing so wonderful as this kiss had ever happened to him.  It was addicting, the taste of Harry, the possession of those hands. Draco could only hold on to Harry’s collar, as he felt his knees start to give way.  He melted into Harry, every angle and curve met Harry’s body groove for groove. One of Harry’s hands glided down to his waist, holding him close, and keeping him from falling.  They kissed, and drank in the essence of one another.  Afraid to part, afraid to drop the passion that had ignited, they just held on.  Breathing heavily, forehead against forehead, emerald eyes staring into silver.
The school work and classes were tedious the rest of the day.  That evening before supper, they were informed that the ministry had decreed no participation in organizations, save for the sanctioned ones, that meant Quidditch was out for the entire year.  Umbridge had delivered the message, and it had spread like wild fire.  Harry just bided his time, this was not a great grievance, but still she should be watched.  So far, no inquisitor squad had been formed.
Harry nodded. He already knew there was no going back for him.
Harry was happy that his maturity was influencing his friends to rise above teenage issues.  It was a hard adjusting back into an environment where you are expected to be led, to listen, to follow the rules instead of making them and being in charge.  But he had always been in charge in his life, people had always looked up to him, he was born to lead, and now he knew how.
Mrs. Malfoy chimed in when Harry finished speaking, “What are you currently pursuing with my son?”
Harry nodded and walked out the doors, heading for his rooms, a place he hadn’t been in years, so it felt alien to walk the path again.
“Of course I care, they were not good to me, but I do not want them dead.” Harry knew Draco just wanted to know, but still… They were family.
Harry stood up, needing to break the contact just so he could breathe.  Draco stood as well and they walked silently out of the Great Hall.
Petunia thought about that.  She understood now, her view of her sister and her nephew were colored by her jealousy and her husband’s constant promoting of that belief, ‘different means freaks’.  She would wait though… what if crossed her mind.. this could be a trick.
“Want to come over to our cottage and fly this evening? I could give you detention… break a few rules, curfew and all…” Harry offered, watching his friends eyes light up.
“Try again, this time don’t insult him.” She stood and walked out slowly, parchment still in hand.  Once she got to her room she smiled.  She loved her son, but he could do with a tune-up to his attitude and she knew just the tool to use, plus she really needed something for the pain.
“You don’t deserve to work for that prick,” Harry mumbled as he shooed the bird towards his window.  The owl hooted and took off.
“I have spoken of the prophecy to only colleagues and the order, Harry, so that part would be a true vision. The Horcruxes I have only supposed, there is nothing I have been able to prove on that front, though I do wonder at you knowing about them.” Albus offered a little hesitantly.
Harry went back to his desk and sat down to his research after about an hour he penned a few ideas for ingredients for the cloth color-changing potion and then moved on to send a request to the ministry for Narcissa’s memories.  He might as well get started on Mrs. Malfoy’s potion.  He had asked about the effects of basic remedies in his reply, that would at least narrow down what not to try.  He only briefly remembered one of the dark rituals mentioned at the trial and decided to call a few books from his library to exclude that one.  Since it was only meant to prolong the life of Nagini, he was sure it was not the ritual to have caused the issue.
Harry was lost in the feel of Draco's skin, the taste, and the scent.  Draco's cries sent heat streaking through his veins urging him to worship the man in his arms.
Narcissa left the meadow gracefully, and then apparated away.
“Albus Severus… Get me a glass of water, I think I hit my head, tell your mum I need a headache potion please, son.” Harry spoke with an authoritative tone none gathered in the infirmary had ever heard before.
“What was this gift?”
Harry was happy with everyone’s progress.  Severus and Dumbledore both were intrigued to learn the charm as well.  Harry stated they would have regular sessions once a week, and their next new spell session would be right before the holidays they would be learning two new spells.  After the students departed.  Professor Snape and the headmaster asked Harry more about the next lessons.  And Harry walked them through how he approached each session to get them ready for quickness of mind and body.  Harry described how after every session that a new spell is introduced, several of the following sessions are for practice, to hone the skill until it becomes second nature to them.  Once mastered they will move on to one or two new spells and repeat the cycle.  The two men went away that evening with a similar mind… Harry would make an excellent teacher.
Hermione only shrugged, “That’s really all I know, basic really. But YOU could go look it up if you're that concerned about it.”   Ron laughed, “She has a point mate, can’t use her as a dictionary all the time.”
Draco looked up at the sound of wings, Hedwig was coming closer to him.  This was good, communication at least.  The beautiful bird extended her leg and he took the parchment.  He looked around but had nothing to offer her.  She only bowed her head a bit, and he pet her gently and let her take off once again.
“21 years!?” Albus exclaimed.
The look he got was beyond hatred.
“You may, Mr. Potter.” She replied, elegance and indifference conveyed in her tone and bowing her head gracefully.
“I don’t like manipulations, so while we come up with some plans, I would like their input.  I will send a note off, Can we all meet next weekend to discuss?” Harry asked hesitantly, “I’ll inform everyone once I receive confirmation.”  The headmaster nodded.
Severus groaned audibly, here was his nemesis’ son and he was about to bare his soul just to hide his thoughts away.  Was it really worth it?  Severus’ scholarly side won out. Learning at any cost was a weakness for him.  He was drawn to power, and new ways to harness it.
Those obsidian eyes changed, glazed in pain, tears streaking the angular lines of Snape’s face.  The death mask taking over slowly, spreading until breath choked the man before him. Blood running down Harry’s hands.
She stayed mum as Harry levitated Vernon to another chair in the room.
“He was trying to protect me from the book your father passed on. He has been attached to me since I freed him. He saved many lives… Ron, Hermione, Luna, Olivander, Griphook, and mine…” Harry explained, he let the tears fall without blinking them away this time. “He was a good elf, a friend...and like so many, he died to protect me…”
Harry moved his barefoot forward and he called for the flames, he could control them now.  They danced up from the stone into his body, he opened his mouth and the red flames rolled out and surrounded his body… cloaking him but not consuming.
Promptly at 8 o’clock, a sleek silver owl flew through his open window and dropped a parchment onto his bed. He opened it with sure hands.
Everyone seemed entranced when seven patronuses stood before them. A silver otter playfully running about, a hare following after the otter, a rather large frog, a small dog and a stallion.   Most of the group stared at Harry and Draco’s patronuses.  Harry was staring concerned by the exhibition of two lions circling one another.
Draco turned his broom to face Ron, a serious look in his eyes.
Severus stared at Harry, that book was very old, and he had forgotten all about it. Harry had improved, but he thought it really just that Harry seemed to be paying more attention. Maybe the vision Harry had, really changed him.
“Hmmm?”
“I have had some training, but I am not an expert.  I would like to ask for you to enter my class to give a speech.  I can arrange a special time, since I know daytime is not your best.” Harry offered.
High school SC
So now I've made my decision. Since she already pass the test; and she definitely likes me. Why not take things to a whole new level. Why wait a whole lifetime, like a certain president for something that I can take now.
"And how did you know that?" Harry asked.
them?
"Yes, that's right." Minerva replied.
"Nice hair." He said pointing at me,
"Damn! Why me?" Harry said to himself as he walks in the dark road (literally). "And what the fuck happened to the lights in here?" He shouted before he heard a familiar voice behind him.
"Yes, sadly. How come he didn't say that to me?" Millicent asked herself. "Even though it's clear, that I'm prettier than that Hannah girl." She said folding her arms, looking daggers at the unsuspected girl(snickers).
"Is the guy still angry?"
"I'm telling you Pans, it's definitely not true… and did you really think I'll let that bitch beat me? I was the one who nominated her. I don't enter something without a plan; and I never entered anything that I'm not sure I could win."
"Hello." The guy said.
"Dancing… Oh MAN!" Harry said as he took a seat on his bed.
"Okay! It's because..."
"Speaking of shoes, Ronald; where are the bronze and silver pairs that went missing weeks ago?" The taller girl said.
"Yes."
-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-
"See even Ron is seeing that." Hermoine said Ron just gaped at her.
Then just right after that I went straight to my bathroom. I turned the water all the way up then turned on the shower. I savor the heat and warmth the water is giving me, recalling the things that happen at the lake last night.
"What the hell!" He shouted as his ass met the floor.
"Please what?"
"I think we can still restore it… but it will need some work." George said.
"The coast is clear right." A soft scared, manly voice asked behind me… why is this place full of sneaky assholes.
Then he started walking, I didn't pay attention until he threw me on the bed.
"She's Hannah Black, a new comer." Blaise said with a smile.

"What!" I shouted. "When?"
"I'll let you use one of my new designs…"
"Ready for this?" He asked while coating his fingers with the lube.
"I know you won't young lady." The woman shouted.
"Well it not technically a da-"
"Sometimes he do, sometimes I do… I do when he felt like having the one wearing girl's clothes on top was erotic… like on those porn movies he watches." He explained, pretending to check out his nails.
"What?" Ren said dumbly.
-0-0-0-0-0-
"I'm really sorry." He muttered as he looked up, and saw the person Ronald warned him about. The head of the business and science department; the man all clad in black. Professor Severus Snape. "I'm really sorry professor, I didn't mean to-" Harry tried to explain but stopped.
"She got a whole day pass to visit her boyfriend in Durmstrang Institute. Since she's a part of the Student Council; every member has a one day off every month. She's exempted from everything. Though she hates the idea, she still uses it to see Victor." He explained.
What's even worse is that I haven't seen Draco in a whole damn week… talk about "love sick school girl mode!" and I'm not even a girl! And now I have a call!
"And here I thought you are already beautiful with that past hair style… now you just look simply
He closed his eyes as he remembered how that certain lady hurriedly grab her phone when she saw him after he drank from the fountain; and by the looks of that person's face. That picture probably turned out great.
"Lucky you…"
"It kind of slipped our minds." Ron said looking sheepishly at me.
"Dray, if only we're not here I'll be the first to one to initiate a make out session! Not here someone might come!" I shouted.
"You didn't wear a condom." I said as I felt cum leaking from my ass, breaking the silence.
"No, it's a little grotesque, but still acceptable." The taller one, Gray, said. "Actually, you can go on with your life without this."
As the word left my mouth, he began pushing one finger in, making a circular motion as he pushed it in and out of my hole. He then hit my prostate making me writhe in the process. Then he hastily added the second one scissoring the tight muscles, then he added the third.
I heard him stifle a laugh, which in turn made me smirk.
"Don't care." He said as he finally opened the lid and downed all the content left. He sighed and said, "This is the life!" making me laugh a little.
"Okay… by the way Hermoine might not come to class at all today." Ron stated as he took another sip.
"Please Dray, Please , I beg you come here already." This time he did as I said. He sat beside and embraced me again but this time he didn't let go before he kissed that sensitive part of my neck. He licked, suck and bit it, making me moan; while forcefully tugging on my tie and pushing me down on the bed.
'Why would a person be used to this kind of treatment?' I thought as I looked at her retreating form.
"Hey… too." I said as I walked towards him. "What are you doing here?"
"They said it was an accident, and they tried to blame me. But since they organized that fashion show it all came exploding to their faces." He said folding his arms across his chest.
's club room; making a certain girl who's currently doing her nails startled.
Representative for each year: (two representatives for each year, a male and a female, and two substitutes. A representative can have two positions ex.) He could be both the representative and the secretary.) Hermoine Granger, Draco Malfoy, Susan Bones, Blaise Zabini
Draco nodded, he had not danced since the Yule Ball last year.  He hoped his feet worked.  Harry took his hand and swept him up into a lovely waltz.  Draco felt like he was floating as they whirled around the dance floor.  Harry’s hold was firm but not too tight, and the dance was slow enough that they could just look at each other. Draco was content, to dance, and breathe in Harry.  The scent of sandalwood and apples enveloped him in comfort.
Draco noted the change in Harry. He had relaxed for a moment, then went almost limp in his embrace. Harry was somewhere else. This was not the same as when his Father used the coin. This was a journey… He was sure it was a guided journey for Harry, the blackness consumed those eyes. He looked in, wanting to see. He was surprised, he could see everything but heard nothing. He saw an older Ginny and Ron. A letter he could not make out the words to… and then he saw a reflection of himself. Only it was not him, the man had a beard, but the features were so similar it was eery. He watched until he saw the green fill up Harry’s eyes like a glass of water.
Harry’s quick movements had them standing off to the corner, Draco’s back against one of the shelves, and a disillusionment charm cast.  And then Harry was there, lips crashing and claiming.  Draco was lost once again, the fire, the heat, the pleasure of just one kiss.  Harry had never tasted another like Draco, the intensity was mind-blowing.  Harry reached down and picked Draco up by the waist, and those leg wrapped around him bringing their pelvises into union.  Each gasped at the contact.  Harry drank in those gasps, and let his mouth move to take flesh from Draco’s pale neck into his heated mouth.  Silk and cream, that was Draco Malfoy, sweet and salty, everything.   Harry had to stop, he pushed himself, this thing with Draco was powerful, and neither was ready for the explosive passion that was waiting to crash over them.
Harry relaxed, “You always were the one with the ability to make me feel better.”  She smiled back, “So… me and Ron?”
“You don’t sound happy about it.” Draco pointed out softly.
“I will be here, Albus will escort me I am sure.” Sanguini said looking towards the Headmaster who merely nodded.
Harry walked them down the first floor corridor.  Down a path he knew well.
Harry spit several times to coat not only himself but Draco’s hole.  He pushed in two fingers to coat Draco’s inner wall and then pulled stretching the hole slowly and as wide as his fingers could stretch. Without preamble or thought, he plunged in, needing to be inside Draco so much his knees were becoming weak. The connection was like life itself was flowing into him.  He reached down and held the base of Draco’s severely reddened cock and he began to pound hard.  His own body was reaching for something so damned amazing that he wanted Draco to go with him.
“That’s all I can hope for.  By the way, you and Dean would make a cute couple.” Harry said, as he watched her blush from top to bottom.  He would miss the friendship they had, but he knew her heart belonged to Dean.  He was happy for her.
Draco made sure he was looking as best as he could.  He knelt on the floor.  His tight black pants moved with him as he shifted, comfortable but sexy.  He wore a silk blue shirt buttoned only halfway.  Only when he felt the familiar tug did he remember he forgot his shoes.
“I know what this costs, to see Draco accepted into our friendship.” Harry said softly. “I have not broached the subject of the diary with him, and I only intend to when needed.  Some trauma is not easily forgotten.”  He put his hand on her shoulder, trying to give some comfort.
Harry wandered out into the corridor, found a secluded ledge and sat down.
“Thank you, Harry.” Ron said.
Narcissa reached for her quill and began to write.
Harry pulled the blond closer, “Then don’t...I have already told you...I can’t settle for normal after you.” Harry whispered the words as he pulled Draco down to his lips slowly pressing onto trembling pink ones. Harry took his time, tasting every corner of Draco’s sweet mouth. He pulled back, enjoying the dazed look in silver eyes.
“I have two things to discuss with you, and would appreciate if you would be open enough to listen, as they benefit you.” Harry said, turning only half-way away from the Professor, while quickly performing a locking charm on the room.
“Hence you’re befriending him in the Great Hall yesterday and the mending of your rivalry?” The headmaster asked.
“Dumbledore”
“I feel.” Harry whispered, “Too much.  Friends first, I want whatever we have to last.  Not a firework of passion that burns out after a moment.  With you, I want to create a fire that we keep stoked for a long time.”  He pressed his lips again to those addictive pink lips and let go.
Harry looked at the bag, he felt nothing, so he knew the Horcrux was destroyed, but maybe Professor Snape could use the ash for something.
“I’m not Lily… I can’t be her…” Sirius cried, tears forming from his own self-inflicted pain.
“Harry?”
A/N~  Part of the storm has now come...This chapter has held me captive.  Years and Years after writing this and many stories and books later... This is still and always will be my favorite chapter I ever wrote.  I had Fall Out Boys "My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark" on repeat! AND there is a bit of flashback timing in the beginning... so yeah don't get to confused.
Once inside Severus’ personal lab, Harry brought out the box and unshrunk it and ended the disillusionment charm. Severus backed up a few steps.
“Every chance I got.”
Severus set about the memory charms.  “We have to move him to Harry, unless you don’t mind him getting in the way when You-know-who arrives.”
Hermione was very impressed with the attention to detail he had shown in his plan.  She was also very eager to learn the spells and practice them… Though he was tempted to give her early lessons, he decided it was best to teach all at once and together, so they could all progress equally.
In a way that coin was Draco’s salvation.  He felt more free and at ease now that Harry and he were friends.  Harry’s rejection of his friendship in first year stung more than any other interaction since.  All of it was beginning to make sense now.  Draco fell asleep that evening more at ease than he had been since the return of the madman.
The next moment more students started popping in, one by one. Draco’s eyes fell a bit, but Harry only had smiles.
Harry woke up around 7:30. He at first thought he would be late for the meeting with Mrs. Malfoy, but was relieved after casting a glance at one of the bedside clocks that he had not overslept. Harry actually groomed himself. He knew presenting an unkempt appearance to a pureblood of high rank was considered rude, after all they had been forced to take etiquette classes as Aurors in their first year.
A/N: The poem included in this chapter is mine and is copyrighted by me.
Ginny looked at him, her eyes wide.
Out in the hallway, they walked side by side, no persisting first period class.  “How are you feeling?” Harry asked, looking Draco over for obvious bruises.
“Nothing… I just came to say goodbye… I can’t be your plaything anymore.” Grey eyes so full of pain shifted around the room. Sirius’ hands were shaking as he took another drink from the whiskey bottle in his hand. Sirius’ posture was sloppy, his eyes darted around the room avoiding Severus.
“I will circulate the news immediately, as it is known that Draco has befriended you,” Mr. Malfoy stated, “If anything, I will write through Draco since I know they will only see it as a way for me to convince him of his deficiencies.”
Harry slowly pulled Draco to his feet and moved them towards the transfigured bed.  Harry captured Draco’s mouth again in another heated kiss, more demanding than the last.  He could kiss Draco forever, that mouth driving him wild as their tongues danced together, and hands were soft against silky skin.  Harry wanted his own tasting.
“Thanks for coming with me,” Harry said and turned to give Severus a quick hug.
They entered the small entryway and Harry then moved forward to the living room and drew the blinds.  He saw her relax a bit more once he had done that.
Professor Snape sent a spell that collected each book and stacked them neatly into a tight corner of the room.  He then spelled the book on his desk to replicate and floated one copy per pair to the desks.
“During the life vision, Mrs. Malfoy did a great and exceptional deed, I owe her my life for that, or at least I will.  I don’t take that lightly.  I have spoken with her,” He saw the headmaster inhale sharply, “And she agreed to my terms.  I will protect her and her family, and instruct them.  This is so they not only stay protected from Voldemort, but their own inclination to do anything to save their family, including bad things that could get the eldest a lifetime sentence in Azkaban and ruin their family name for decades.  Family and position mean everything to them.  I need Lucius to be part of the Ministry raid that will happen… that is imperative.  I need no changes to that end that will endanger my plan.  Once we have a plan in place, I need to inform her, and she will choose to agree or disagree with our terms.”
“Mr. Potter? Are you coming in?” Severus asked, a smirk hanging on his lips.  The boy looked like he had just had a tumble.
Professor Snape came out of the office, robes swirling around him, and a contemptuous look on his face.
“I’ll teach you. In my vision, we Aurors worked with the Department of Mysteries to go beyond Occlumency, and work with mind shields. We paired the practice, until we found that our Occlusion could be manipulated into walls.” Harry offered.
One by one Harry showed him how to pull the hidden memories and shape them, into tight bricks, how to use the Occlusion fabric imbued with the shield and wrap each one up as a brick.  It saddened Harry how few bright happy memories the Professor actually possessed.   There were a lot of neutral memories, but that was standard.  The balance was going to be harder to maintain with so few happy memories.  He will have to help Severus build more, no matter how small, happy memories were powerful.  Harry went to pick up the last happy memory to help, and found it to be relatively new, and the aura that it gave off gave Harry the impression of Sirius.  Severus snatched the memory out of a surprised Harry’s hands, “I got this.” He said as he slowly pushed Harry out of his head.  Harry found himself staring at his professor with a wide grin.  He wiped it away before it could be seen, and decided to meditate while waiting for Severus.  Harry added his own new happy memory to the thick brick wall between two very dark bricks.
“Madam, I don’t care what makes the Minister happy. If you don’t work with me, you work against me, and this time around, you will not get very far. Do we understand each other Madam?” Harry stood his ground, though he was just a bit taller, it was his eyes that pierced her, causing her to nod. “Good.”
Voldemort was gone, Death Eaters were either in Azkaban or reformed. Even without that, most witches and wizards feared him and would not jeopardize their so-called security.  Harry had expected Voldemort’s death to be greeted with applause and happiness. Instead, He was greeted with fear and caution.  Sure his closest friends were still the same.  But the wizarding world both revered him and feared him.  Times were not like they were to the 11-year-old boy introduced to his fame for the first time. Even Ginny had feared him at first, but then she got over it.  Harry had never really forgiven her for that.  The girl had known what he was supposed to do, but when faced with reality, she couldn’t even look at him anymore.
“I need this too, Draco. Not this dark need I have for every day, but I need something to keep me going. Sometimes soft, sometimes hard, sometimes something in between...” Harry stared into silver pools, “I play for keeps because I don’t play.”
Harry waited in the Room of Requirements for the rest of the Defense club to arrive.  He had invited Professor Snape and Professor Dumbledore for this one.  Harry described the room he would need to the headmaster when he arrived.  He implied that the task was important for saving a very important life.  From his original discussion with Hermione and the dates associated with his Augur powers, Sirius’ death was the greatest mistake that needed to be corrected.  Getting that part right was his main focus and goal.
Harry stood still, just watching the blond in front of him. Processing what was just said was a bit difficult to say the least. Narcissa had given him a gift. Unknowingly it was her son. Harry was not sure what to make of this idea.
“With who?” Her voice shook considerably now… Harry walked over to her and let his hand fall to her shoulder.  She was falling into a pit… with no way out...
“What do you need?” Harry purred, “This?”
Harry walked into the Great Hall and sat down next to Ron and Hermione.  They stopped talking as soon as he sat down, and he notice a blush creep up Hermione’s cheek.
“Open your mouth,” Harry commanded.
She laughed and smiled back.
“I have a potion that needs to be brewed before Friday, Sir. I would like to request the use of some of your ingredients. I will keep a list of what I use and replace them, but ordering them is out of the question due to time constraints.” Harry supplied.

Draco and Harry found they worked well together.  As long as they communicated their intentions and divided tasks equally, there was no room to argue.  Harry was growing to like Draco, his demeanor and manners recommended themselves admirably.  Rudeness and arrogance was not Draco, that was Malfoy… and Harry started separating the two and realized Draco had a mask all along, that he had never taken the time to look past.  How many other misconceptions were there in his life that he had not seen?  Even as lost in thought as he was, Harry was able to get the roots to detangle, and the other ingredients to work as they should. Harry smiled as he crushed his Sopophorous bean, remembering Hermione getting flustered over this potion from his memory.   This potion was ingrained in Harry.
“I know it wasn’t him, Harry.  But it is hard for me to see the difference, and even harder for me to trust him.” Ginny replied, graceful as always.
“I was almost one of them,” Harry stated, “I’m sure I can figure out how to deal with them, after being the youngest Head Auror for 10 years, I am sure I can handle it.”
“I have two other brooms...which would you prefer?” Harry asked, ignoring the blushing redhead.
“Strength” a dark green rune floated next to the others.
“All-consuming?” She supplied.
“This is Sanguini, A vampire, friend of Eldred Worple...He was recommended by the Society for the Tolerance of Vampires. Sanguini, this is Harry Potter.” Dumbledore introduced them.
Draco walked up and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist.  Harry was standing on the veranda looking out at the dark sky, full of stars and a receding full moon.
Sunday morning, Harry and Hermione were working on the invitation letters for those who would be part of their ‘defense club’.  Harry changed the name based on past experience, just in case.  For the most part Umbridge changed nothing in her demeanor, but did not exert too much control in her post.  There were still detentions, no practical magic in her class, but the harsher tones that had once permeated her teaching sphere, were no longer there.   Best of all there was no Blood Quill...  Harry looked at his left hand a couple of times, he almost missed the scars, but then again he did not miss what they represented.
“What about Ginny?” Ron asked, his tone tainted with rage. Ginny was family, and that was still a raw moment for him, and for the rest of the Weasleys.  They do not forgive a trespass so easily against one of their own.
“I could not have done that without the Headmaster’s connections.” He said, brushing away the compliment.
“Please,” Draco called up to him.  Silver eyes had melted into soft mercury.
Draco pulled the crumpled parchment from his desk and handed it to her.
Ron stared at two of the latest models, so Harry played fair after all... He grabbed the one on the right and all three headed out to the rear yard… The wards extended straight up according to Harry, so there would be no entrance from above, but they could fly as high as they wanted.  The yard was expensive, though not as long as the Quidditch pitch, it was wider though.
Hermione was standing there… beet red in the face…
“Yeah...Ron?” Harry asked she nodded and blushed.  She understood then.
“I owe your mother a debt, I will not discuss this with you. But if you want your family to retain its current position in wizarding society, I suggest you arrange a meeting for me and your mother in Hogsmeade. Bring your goons if you must, but if you value your way of life, I suggest you do so soon, before I cannot repair the damage that will be done by your inaction.” Harry was quite in his words.
“I never said I did everything alone… Hermione has the best brains around, Ron’s strategy is perfect, and well, I improvise… we make a great team… Draco, well he is a balance that we never had…I think its a great addition” Harry sighed, they had such good times even in the darkest hours.  Harry noticed a look cross Severus’ face.
The holidays were approaching, and he knew that his plan would make things more difficult for the Malfoy’s but maybe there could be an upside to all this, at least in the end there would be.  He was sure that he wanted to spend the Holidays with Sirius, and if their plan for the Malfoy’s succeeded, he would offer them a chance to join them, if they were willing.
Severus looked at him curiously.
Harry sat at the desk in his office at Grimmauld Place.  The room was dark, with only two lamps in either corner bringing soft light into the room.  The walls were made of either dark ebony wood or bookshelves.  Only one window was set into the wall, and it faced the darkened street.  Harry rarely looked up from his work.  He was working on research for an experimental potion.  One of his friends had asked if there was a potion for coloring fabric since the charm only lasted a few hours.  They wanted something not permanent but would last for an entire day or longer.
Harry stood there, still calm, still self-assured, and lifted his hand. “So can we start over and call a truce?” Severus stared at the hand, wondering at the kindness, so like Lily. He took hold of Harry’s hand, and Harry pulled him closer, and then hugged him. An almost paternal feeling came over him, and he returned the hug as best as he could, with a pat here and there.
Inexplicably Harry bristled at the idea of Draco having deficiencies. But he kept his logic in control, Lucius was just strategizing.  Either way, these interesting responses were enough for Harry to note them and wonder at the meaning of their involuntary nature.
“Sure, Harry, I’ll do what I can.” Ron offered.
Draco watched in a haze as Harry moved above him, his throat raw from so much fucking.  Yet when Harry bent down to taste him, he couldn’t even scream, only whimper.  He was already strung tight as a bow and then to watch Harry’s eyes as they devoured him, was extraordinary.  He was pulled from his haze as blinding pain sliced through him, and the ecstasy that came with the breach was otherworldly. He almost felt like his body was floating.

Professor Snape was waiting for Harry in the classroom that evening, and motioned for them to enter his chambers off to the left.   Harry followed him and waited just inside the inviting sitting room.  He felt apprehension slide up his spine… The Professor was not in a good mood, his muscles were strained and his jaw clenched.
“Give me time,” Severus said, then stepped into the fire and disappeared.
“I think really well, the last two treatments have done wonders.” She replied with a smile.
“Whatever I do, the Death Eaters may undo as far as obscuring.  Finding a way to put the muggles asleep in their own homes could prevent exposure.  I am not sure that is a job for the Order… That may be another path altogether. I will wait until the meeting to decide.” Harry said.
Harry stepped forward, placing the book on the desk in front of Professor Snape. He looked down into the eyes of his Professor, “You are brilliant, but your methods could be better, not nicer as that serves you well, but this book should shed light on what you are missing for your explanations.”
“So when did you want to pay a visit to the Dursleys?” Severus asked, his face pinched with disgust.
Harry shook his head, “He is scum, but death is not for him…I know where to take him.  He should have loads of fun with his sister…”
Harry stood and crossed over to her, and her eyes widened in fear but she did not move.  He searched for just the right power...Who knew it would be love… deep down he did love her…
Harry turned to Hermione, “Have you ever known a patronus to change?”
“Civilly, why are you actually being civil? This is completely out of character for you.” Harry started, thinking it was obvious.
“What?”
“Keep kissing you,” Harry stated.
“During the war, every time we dispatched a dark artifact, it was like a homing beacon for Voldemort, he knew of the destruction which made him more dangerous, and he could then predict where we were going next. I found a connection between artifacts cursed with dark magic and their owners, the curse acted as a way for them to find it, or as a portal for them to act through when tampered, or for the curse to activate if the owner were no longer alive. This potion when applied to a container, instrument of destruction or the item itself, delayed the activation of the spell and allowed us time to capture the caster, or destroy the item without any negative repercussions. The department of Mysteries benefitted from the development, as they are the ones who study the dark artifacts the most.” Harry said, then went quiet, wondering if he gave away too much. He looked up at Professor Snape for a moment, then back at his work.
“I don’t want to know…” Harry cried putting his hand out as if to stop words from reaching him.
Draco stood, and the others nodded, and then they exited the Great Hall… More riotous noise could be heard as they left.
He saw the Headmaster hesitate.
They sipped their drinks, talked about various subjects. Harry asked Draco about his hopes for the future, his talents, his likes and dislikes, and they talked for what felt like an eternity.  They ate the food that the room provided, and danced a few more times.  Blissful was the only thing that could describe how Harry was feeling by the time they left.  Harry had to prepare for their next defense class, and Draco left to find his friends.  Harry was on cloud nine, when he got back to his room and flopped on his bed, a lopsided grin plastered on his face.
“It was a bet I lost.  I was supposed to kiss my worst enemy.” Draco explained.
Severus smiled at the thought of James Potter’s face if he heard Harry say ‘surrogate son’.  He could handle that… He patted Harry’s shoulder.  “Let’s get back to in then…”
Harry examined those bricks, he knew which memories they were, though their color seemed to have faded from black, to just very dark.  He would have to examine his memories soon to ensure the proper balance was maintained.
“Thank you.” was all he said before ascending the stairs, shielding his bed, and fell asleep with the last thought of Harry… that made him smile.
Sincerely,
They both broke out into a fit of laughter.  What’s the point of anything if you can’t laugh about it.
“What do you need from us?” Hermione asked quietly.
“Ok, if you say so. Do we have to eat with them too? I don’t see any empty spots.” Greg said… he sounded as indifferent over the change as anyone could be.
Harry nodded, “We have only a few months before she will be able to gain access once again, I cannot let that artifact stay in her vault. Can you retrieve it for me? I will provide all you need to contain its dark magic, all I need to know is when you plan on going so I can have the objects ready.”
“Draco is on his way, and his parents should arrive shortly, but separately.” Dumbledore stated, “I made a fuss over Draco publicly to explain the meeting to outsiders.”
Severus looked around the room, “I can keep it in my rooms for now, detention again Thursday. Can you get the test artifact by then?”
“More what?” Harry hissed.
“What happened in the tower?” Draco asked softly.  Trying to draw Harry’s attention back to him.  There had been a quiet stillness about Harry.
Harry had not thought of that, but then remembered a way to test it, “Yes, I will save some for an object that I know is cursed, and see If I can confine the dark magic from detection. That will give me the knowledge to know it worked or not.”
Harry walked through the door, watching the headmaster pop a new candy into his mouth and sigh as he leaned back into his chair enjoying the morsel.  Harry smiled when those twinkling eyes met his own.
“You each will share a copy of this text, it is to be left in this room.  Turn to page 365, where we will brew the draught of living death according the new instructions printed in the margins of this page.  I expect everyone to follow the book’s notes exactly in order to achieve high marks on this potion.  You have the remainder of the class to complete this potion to the first step where it needs to simmer.  If you have questions, raise your hand and I will approach you to answer them to keep from disrupting the class.  Is that clear for everyone?” Snape asked.
"What twin thing? That twin thing! You're doing it right fucking now!" Ron shouted.

I'm telling you, both of them really looks the same but one is taller, they were both wearing some accessories that Ron wears right now, the square book like locket, silver bangles and black heart earrings. But their rings were different. The girl in the converse were wearing silver or stainless ones with no or minimal stones, the one in the wedge were wearing black rubber ones and Ron is a sucker for really big stones that his finger may swear at him if it can just talk.
"But I think your junior got harder." He said looking at my very naked manhood, with a smirk.

"So how do you like Madam Malkin's work?" He asked as we reached the car.
'Such a simple mind set for a really complex person.' I thought to myself. Our happy hour didn't last long until a bad, stinky air covered the strawberry-pineapple scent of our drinks.
"Ron!" the guy said as he spotted Ron, still sitting on the floor. "What did those idiots do to you again?" He said as he pulled Ron to a tight hug.
"He's with me. And he's with his friends as of the moment." My dark skinned friend said.
'Good thing Tonks send me that yesterday.' Harry thought as Draco put the disc in the player. It took only seconds before the violin sounds were filling the air in the room. Then Harry realized that the song was a classical version of one of his favorite songs… Helena by My Chemical Romance. "Is that… Helena?" Harry asked amazement visible in his voice.
