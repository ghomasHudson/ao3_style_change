The first domino fell as Harry was leaning against a wall, holding a carrot stick in one hand and a warm beer in the other and debating which one would be worse to put in his mouth.
at the beginning of every song. Harry ended up sharing a joint with Dean, Seamus, Morag and Parvati outside, once Draco confirmed the staff wouldn’t give a fuck.
“You know, I really think you’re underselling our future kids, Pans. As long as they avoid anything from the top half of my face and anything from the bottom half of yours, we’re probably all right.”
“I think you might have left one out,” said Draco sardonically. “I kid, of course. Though bravery isn’t necessarily a moral ideal either, you understand.”
“I only smoke Cubans, Harry, and I’m not wasting them on your baby smoking habit.” He strode off, and Harry waited outside for a little bit, wondering when he’d become such an irredeemable bore, before following.
he can’t do that. All he’ll do is hang around the edges being a sad sack, and that will probably help cheer you up.”
“It’s not the first time a woman’s slapped me,” said Blaise. He seemed to be drawing himself back together. “Talisker, no ice. I’ll give her a bit of time to cool off. Try and talk to her again.”
Draco drained the glass, steadied himself and continued his crowing. “Write a letter to Macgonagall, tell her the Great Hall is going green. Finally, Slytherin has triumphed! Weasley, tell Shacklebolt I shall expect my medal in the mail. Granger, feel free to tell me how terribly handsome I am.”
“Please don’t? Don’t what? Just because you’re allergic to your emotions and can’t consider the possibility that having an open, honest conversation is the best way – “
“Yeah,” said Harry, grimacing. “He was really apologetic, second year. Kept thinking about how if he’d succeeded, Voldemort would have come back. I think that’s when I really started liking him, though. He knew he was a shit wizard, but he still tried anyway.”
Or at least it did, until he actually reached the courtyard and Malfoy caught sight of him. The long drag he took of his cigarette looked like it was meant to fortify him, and the long sigh afterwards suggested that it didn’t help. Harry wrapped his arms around himself and belatedly remembered that he was still wearing his pyjamas, and that he was possibly too hungover to tell what was real and what was not. Well. No backing out now.
Hermione resisted the urge to scowl. “Thanks, but I’ll probably just go out like this. Come get me when it’s time to leave.” She went to close the door, but Parvati had the nerve to actually stick her foot in its path.
The trick was to act natural. To say something normal. To do anything other than standing there like a deer in the headlights.  He’d talked his way out of trickier situations, he could do this.
He scowled, and then seemed to remember what he was doing. “I have been rude, and prejudiced, and bigoted to you for half your life. I’m trying to make amends now. Well, I’m trying to think of ways to make amends now. AndIwouldappreciateitifyoudidn’ttellPotteraboutthis.” He took a deep, wheezing breath. “There. Ok. All finished.”
“So what are you studying, Dean?” she said cheerfully, flicking Harry on the shoulder as she did so.
to shouting at Harry in the courtyard. Ron listened attentively – more than could be said for Hermione, who’d just said “Honestly, Harry, what did you expect?” – and suggested some fantastic modifications to the kitchen that he was reasonably sure could be tweaked to only spray Malfoy.
She barrelled through the crowd without looking, ignoring Terry as he called after her. She barely noticed when she ran smack dab into a familiar, welcoming chest.
“I’m number six. Try not to keep me up all night with your wild Gryffindor parties.” His smile was slow and teasing.
“Hmm,” said Ginny. “You know, Neville’s bi too. And Dean. Lots of options for Harry once you’re back in your right mind.”
“Ugh.” She buried her head in her hands. “Maybe I should just get back with Ron and have his terrible ginger babies.”
Looking at her now, Harry thought he could maybe see something of what Ron saw. She was never going to be pretty, but there was something faintly self-mocking about her prim little pout now. Her eyes were shrewd and intelligent; her dress was a violation of public decency. What had Ron said?
“Well, I just – I’d had my fun, you know? I think I’m ready to settle down into something more serious now.”
Draco’s face closed off, and with it the anger in Harry’s stomach was extinguished by a cold tide of terror. He had done something very wrong and broken something very precious, only he wasn’t sure what and how. They should have agreed to rules. They should have agreed to something, instead of leaving this nameless, shapeless thing to grow and shatter. Draco was gone, and Harry was shaking, shaking in Lee’s arms.
“Sorry, do you not like clubs? It’s just that George is opening one, and he asked me and Hermione to be there. I think he’s inviting most of our year, actually.”
“Yeah. Just peachy. I just mean – well, if someone’s in your head all the time. And it’s not even that you’re thinking about how wonderful they are, or how fit they look. You’re just obsessed with them. You want to know every single facet of them. You’ve got their voice inside your mind alongside your own. You dream about them talking to you. That kind of rubbish.”
Draco waved his hand and screwed his face up. He couldn’t think very hard at the moment, but he was sure that if he did the motions like he was, clever thoughts would come. “You say stuff that’s literal, but you’re thinking about it – deeply.”
“You have?” said Draco, slightly strangled. Oh god. He was going to have to drop out of university, and that meant he was going to be destitute, and then he was going to
“I said Harry was. Then he left to go have sex with Draco Malfoy, who I’m pretty sure is now his boyfriend.”
“Bloody hell,” said Harry. He was wearing his best shirt and his only blazer, and had until now felt quite grownup. “You’re going to give Skeeter a heart-attack.”
Blaise pinched his nose. “Harry. They are dates. Your friend is dating three boys at the same time, all of whom are friends, and sooner or later it’s going to devolve into an ugly fist fight. Do you not think you should be, maybe, talking to her about this?”
“Yeah. I’m bringing Parkinson. Can’t say I’m ever going to be the slimy gits biggest fan, but if you’re all getting along with him then I suppose he must have changed. Ugh, he’ll probably end up copping off with Parkinson there.”
“I fucking tried, didn’t I!” yelled Malfoy. He was gripping his water glass so hard it looked like it might shatter. “I went to find you first, actually, and what did I get? You took one look at me and told me to fuck off. So sorry if I didn’t fancy round two of that. Pity that I’m getting it anyway. And I don’t apologise to homophobes, not for my existence, not for
Malfoy jumped a little, and then reached up to rub his temples. “Potter. It is arse o clock in the morning, and you’re shouting nonsense at me. What apology? For copping off with a bloke? Sod off forever.”
Blaise’s laugh was roaring. “Oh, Harry. His parents have always known he was gay. They caught him sucking me off the summer before sixth year.”
“Oh yeah,” said Dean, elbowing Seamus. “Absolutely no one in Gryffindor fancied you ever. Isn’t that right, Seamus?”
Hermione was still staring at him. Then she pushed herself off the bed and started swearing in long, colourful strings.
“Yeah,” said Harry, trying and failing not to think about how it would be different. He felt a small ache for the comforting presence of Ron. The thing about Dean and Seamus was that they were a set, and it wasn’t one that you could break into. It had been ok when it was him and Ron, but now – well. He mentally apologised to Neville, always the one without a best friend.
Very quickly - this chapter contains a reference to hair-related racism that Hermione has experience, and includes a character openly describing a lot of internalised homophobia.
“Course, he’ll probably be too busy sucking up to Blaise. Or sucking – whatever. Want to give me a hand with this tinsel, Harry?”
“Little bit. I know what you mean, though. About being the nice one. Always having to look out for people’s feelings around you. It doesn’t leave any room for your own.”
He was just entertaining a vivid fantasy of finding out about Ron and Hermione’s wedding through the newspapers when he turned a corner and found Draco Malfoy, drinking alone on a bench at the edge of the Royal College’s grounds.
Well, they were doing something confusing. They were either flirting or fighting or bitching about every other person in the room.
Draco laughed and shifted. Harry was leaning back against the wall now, with Draco’s head pillowed on his shoulder. He ran his hands soothingly up and down Draco’s back.
“The Bones?” Parvati raised an eyebrow. “The most serious and well-respected family of legal scholars, politicians and all-round serious doo-gooders? Approving of Blaise?”
Draco patted his hair. “Don’t worry. I’m sure you’ll bond with someone horrible too. Maybe Abbot. All right, Potter. See you in the morning.”
“Eh,” said Malfoy, shrugging. “It turned out to be my father, in the end. So pretty much the same thing.”
“Mum and Dad definitely know you’re a lesbian now,” said Padma. “It was all ‘oh, Hermione had such interesting things to say about the inherent Christianity of the Hogwarts curriculum’ or ‘oh, Hermione taught me this really neat charm – “
“Nightcap?” said Blaise, and “Please,” said Harry. Blaise was mixing the drinks, so at least he’d be drunk enough to go to sleep.
“Sorry, sorry, just give me a second.” Seamus ran to his room, and was back a second later holding a CD. “Is this your dad?”
But Draco was just shrugging his words off. “I’m not talking about the homophobia, though I’m sure there’s a fair bit of that mixed in. I just mean that they were pretty symbiotic, weren’t they? And now with everything changing, I can see why Seamus might be feeling pretty insecure.” He sipped his pint. “We’ve all been through a lot, and most of it was only a year ago. None of us are going to be our best selves right now.”
Draco was standing there in the doorway, his hair ruffled, in a clean white shirt. He looked washed out and strange under the sodium glare. He looked like he hadn’t slept in a week, and then cried heavily about it. He looked absolutely beautiful.
“It’s Malfoy, isn’t it?” said Dean, looking at Hermione as if he were prophesising the end of the world. Hermione gave a small nod, and looked at Harry to check if he was ok. Which he was very much
“We’ve got to give Potter all his awkward first weed experiences,” said Morag. She was smiling in a way that promised terrifying things.
“He’s bi,” said Dean. “And so am I. I thought Seamus knew. It’s not like I ever came out or anything, but I’ve spoken about guys I think are fit before. I guess he always thought I was joking. And I thought – “ He shook his head. “It doesn’t matter what I thought. I must have been delusional. So now I either have to keep this secret for the rest of my life, or lose him forever.”
“I – I don’t know,” Harry said. Something shifted in Blaise’s face – some light going out in his eyes. He stepped closer, right into Harry’s face, which was quite a lot to deal with what with Blaise’s eyes and the cheekbones and the overpowering, expensive smell.
“Fuck,” said Harry. The Royal College was extremely strict on the fact that no press were allowed on their grounds, so Harry had largely been left alone. That hadn’t changed the fact that he was hideously famous. Right now a crowd of photographers were encamped outside, and at one point Ron had stopped mid-sentence, leant over and grabbed the notebook out of the hands of the man at the next table. It had been full of quotes from their conversation. Ron had kept it, and Harry had stuck up a thick muffling charm. “Wait, George is opening a nightclub? Really?”
“You were talking about Seamus,” said Harry, and Dean let out the first real sob, curling into himself more.
“This Saturday,” said Harry, thankful to be distracted from whatever Blaise was doing with his face. “Think you can make it?”
Blaise shut his eyes and swooned backwards dramatically. “She makes me want to do incredible things, you know. Fight a war. Slay a dragon. Punch a bad guy in the face.”
“Because it’s Saturday,” he said, “and you’re normally a little more intuitive than this. Not a lot, and the general level of oddness hasn’t changed, but normally you’d be being all perceptive.”
“Oh Ron,” said Susan. “Don’t worry, the aurors are really good at transferring partners when personal issues get in the way. Tough luck on this happening the day you get back together, Hermione.”
He remembered Draco saying that he needed a hand on himself to finish, and he reached round. His hand was batted away.
“I’ll tell him,” she said, her eyes very wide. “But Malfoy, I think you should talk to him. He really wants to – “
She straightened up, tried to radiate calm and self-respect and the general aura that she was only asking this as an intellectual exercise. “Am I attractive?”
And Draco did take his hand, and Harry utterly failed not to have feelings about it. From the look on his face, neither did Draco.
She got the details anyway. The details being that Draco was extremely fine with how things had ended with Potter, and just adored the way that he and Potter were now in sexless friendship, and he just loved spending time with Blaise and Seamus. He wasn’t thinking about Harry at all, except that he was, all the time, but that was fine. It was probably just something called the
going to be in some back corner of my life, snarling at me and telling me that I’m not good enough and never will be. But you know what? I’ve realised something now. I don’t give a fuck about your opinion of me, never have. You come in here, talking about how you felt so, so sad when you thought I hadn’t changed. News flash, Chosen One – I didn’t change for you. Some things aren’t about you. If you want to walk around being disappointed in me, then enjoy it. I’m done.”
“But she’s right,” said Hannah. “I know you go full throttle at anything Hermione, but he didn’t commit a crime. There’s nothing we can do.”
Harry reached out and covered Draco’s hand with his own. Was it possible that Potter knew all about his horrible secret feelings and was, in fact, a secret sadist? He probably did. God, Granger had probably told him. She was too clever for her own good. Maybe he should reconcile with his parents just so he could buy her silence. How much would clothes for every house elf in Britain cost?
Ron nodded weakly, as if Draco had said something terribly interesting. “It’s a nice cupboard to be bisexual in, I guess. As cupboards go.”
“You’re in a right snit,” said Pansy over Sunday tea, who was herself in a right snit. Apparently Weasley had stopped dancing with her and bolted out of the club as soon as he saw Granger leave, which any fool could have seen coming. He said as much, and she threw a scone at him.
“Don’t. Call me Malfoy. It makes it easier.” It had begun to rain around them. Draco tilted his head up and let the water run down his neck. “It’s better if I remember what I am to you. When you say my name when we fuck it almost sounds like you care about me.”
She stroked his back fondly. “Let me tell you something, Finnegan, something I worked out when I was sixteen and I had to start living at Hogwarts full time because my mother wouldn’t let me come back home. You can survive just fine if the whole world hates you, but you can’t live at odds with yourself. Don’t waste any time trying.”
And then he turned back to Seamus and Dean, apparently deciding that the conversation was over, to hold forth on the many values of Mariah Carey. As if he hadn’t just thrown a bomb into Harry’s mind.
“No offence, but I have never and will never trust someone who grew up rich as you to cook or clean. Only one condition on our glorious future together.”
“So, don’t take this the wrong way,” he said, leaning forward. “But at school you were quite, uh – “
“Hitting on you!” said Seamus. “Dean, seriously. Couldn’t you tell? He’s trying to gobble your prick, mark my words.”
“I don’t know,” said Blaise. He stopped pacing and sat, reaching under his bed to pull out a bottle of Elf-Wine. “Is it any worse than what he – what he tried to do? To Susan. I just – she won’t feel safe, not while he’s around, and all I want is for her to feel safe. Oh god, Harry, you can never ever tell her about this. She’d be so angry.”
“Unpleasant, yes,” said Blaise. His smile was beginning to look like it hurt. “Seamus, it’s your turn, isn’t it?”
“Sure you were. I’m sure that I absolutely destroyed your night. Those three dances you had with Gabrielle Delacour were probably just balm for your aching soul.”
said a sing-song voice in his head. It sounded like Pansy. He should have demanded to be placed in Hufflepuff. They didn’t have these kind of problems. “It’s fine, honestly.”
“Because I’ve changed and grown, and I really wouldn’t say any of the stuff I said about Granger back in the day now.  On the other hand, if someone walked up to me now and said “It’s the life of everyone in this room or Harry Potter,” I’d Kevadra you myself.”
He’d done two rounds of the dancefloor and another two of the whole club before he acknowledged, like a hole to the heart, that Seamus was gone.
“Yeah.” She tried, and failed, to blow a smoke ring. Dumbledore had made it look so easy. “Now I know I’m wanted in the way I wanted to be back then. And it feels kind of empty. They’ve all got an idea of me, and none of them just see me and know me like Ron did.”
“No, I mean, yes, I mean I’m sure she has. I’m sorry.” He raises his hands placatingly. “Remember how you’re doing that new thing where you use your words instead of bottling up your emotions forever and releasing them in a storm of rage?”
“Yeah.” She took a sip of her drink. The overpowering sweetness did nothing to mask the taste of vodka. “God. I’m sorry I took this all out on you. I wasn’t even mad at you. I guess in my head I’ll always be fifteen and mad at – “ She stopped, realising she’d trod on a land mine.
He finally, finally got to throw up, and stumbled back out into the bathroom hoping that nobody was listening to him. He looked a mess. Thank god men didn’t wear make-up, because his would probably be smeared to shit right now. How did girls do it?
“I know.” He smiled, and cupped her cheek. “I can be a man who’s hard to read. But rest assured, I feel exactly the same as you.”
“Yeah, maybe. Actually no. His best friend is being a right arse. When you came out, were your friends – actually, don’t answer that. Blaise has already told me exactly how supportive he was of your sexuality.”
He sat down miserably against it, putting his head in his hands. He was very much sober now, and really regretting it. Draco probably hadn’t even cared about him copping off with Jordan. He’d probably pulled himself. He’d looked a little pale in the bathroom, sure, but he always looked pale.
The shout echoed off the walls of the Muggle train as Seamus and Dean descended on the table that Harry and Hermione had grabbed. Across the aisle from them, an elderly woman in a bobble hat turned and gave them a distinctly dirty look, taking in the whole lot of them – the bags shoved under the tables, the mess of sweet wrappers in front of them, Harry’s dishevelled hair next to Hermione’s new close-crop. Hermione shhh’d the boys as they bundled into the seats opposite, trying to clear the table.
Hermione flushed a deep crimson, which was odd, but hovering low on the oddness scale of the day. “I – I’ll have you know – this is my flat, Harry, what are you doing here? In Malfoy’s room? Oh – oh – “
There will be a bit of a delay before posting chapter 3 - less of it is written. I have almost all of the ending, but I'm still winding my way there.
“I suppose. I don’t miss him. I just miss the way he loved me. Maybe thinking that I could always slip back into that, if I really wanted, was my safety blanket. Maybe I wasn’t really being brave at all.”
“And then he said to Greg “help, Greg, I think I’m a ghost” and Greg told him he should try walking through something –“
“I bet,” he said, grinning. He really was ridiculously good looking, with a chiselled face and delicate green eyes. “So how was eighth year at Hogwarts? Did a DADA teacher finally turn out to be useful and non-evil?”
“She did call me a mouth-breathing cretin the other day,” said Ron, laughing a little. “Felt kind of nice. Reminded me of… well, Hermione back in fourth year.”
“Yeah, but that wasn’t because you were going through some deep complicated psychosexual issues. That was just because you were dumb.” He exhaled slowly. “Which, by the way, is what you should tell Draco.”
“Isn’t she just,” said Parvati, wrapping her hand around Hermione’s waist. She was looking no-less heart-stopping, and seeing as she wasn’t Hermione and therefore practically his sister, it was causing a bit of a reaction in him. She wore a tiny dress of gold mesh that seemed to barely hang on by a thin strap round her neck, hanging low and loose around her chest. There was almost no back, and she seemed to have about eight miles of legs. Her hair was in a long, sleek ponytail with red flowers wrapped around the base.
“That’s why I called you,” said Blaise, doubled over and panting. “I thought to myself ‘who’s most likely to be down to commit a violent crime?’ and you came instantly to mind.”
Why on earth would a nipple be slippery? Harry never wanted to know. Maybe he’d ask Draco later. It certainly hadn’t
When Harry opened the door to the knocking, he found it was not Hermione, or Dean or Seamus, or anyone explicable. It was Blaise Zabini, with a crate of champagne tucked under one arm. Dean and Seamus were hovering behind him, gripping each other’s shoulders in a way that was both adorable and disheartening.
But that wasn’t Dean’s problem. He reached up and played with Sea’s curls, because they were drunk. Because it was ok when they were drunk. Always had been.
Harry sighed. “I realised afterwards at the club that I’d basically thrown you over to cop off with someone. I think with all the – the – “ He lowered his voice in a way that was
There was Malfoy, standing in the doorway, looking very small and very pale. Harry felt a swoop of fear, then a surge of anger. What had he fucking expected, after pushing Harry away? How dare he stand there, shaking like the first day he’d seen him? How dare he look so broken? It wasn’t Harry’s fault. None of this was his fault.
of it all,” Hermione was saying, hands waving above her. Theo and Athony were braiding flowers into her hair as the sun went down. “The, uh, the – Anthony?”
“Nah. Did it myself, back in forth year. Me, Rivers and Lovegood were very briefly in a band, and I thought it might add to our edgy image.”
coursing through his veins. But overall, he wanted less Potter in his life, and therefore wasn’t talking about him.
crap,’ and explain that a Goldberg was a machine designed to do a simple task in an extraordinary complex chain of cause and effect – balls rolling along shelves to drop into buckets to lift up pulleys to spray water on delicately balanced scales. She would show them a video, which Harry had to admit was pretty funny. Blaise would complain that she could have just used a chain of dominoes as her metaphor, and why did she always have to make everything so unnecessarily complicated?
The first thought Draco had when he woke up in the morning was that he needed to take stock of his life.
“I need to get laid,” he said to his little room, dick out and dirty tissue in hand. It was one of the lower moments of his life. He tried to compare it to the time he’d had to sneak off into the forest to wank on their year on the run, and concluded that no, this was worse.
“Spectacular,” muttered Draco, but he followed Harry out of the stifling air indoors and down the little alley that led to the courtyard.
“No?” You absolutely could, her eyes were still red around the edges, but he needed to talk to Draco, he needed to –
Except now he could, because this party was laid out for him too. He brushed his fingers against Draco’s.
“Fine!” said Draco. He tugged at his hair. Better out than in. “I have – I have fallen in love with Harry Potter.”
“Hey,” there was Seamus, balancing three coffees. “Blaise had to run back to halls, apparently something bad has happened to Susan. Harry, Hermione’s involved too.”
went the klaxons in his brain. “Look, I’m sure Ron would be up for it. I mean, you know each other so well!” Intensified sobbing. “I always thought you were meant to be, you know.” An actual anguished moan at that one. “And you go so well together!”
“That cowardly little cur,” he said into her hair. “That - that – we'll destroy him, Bones. I promise.”
“What are you terrible witches conspiring about?” demanded Draco. His face was very pinched. He looked a lot like young Draco, just then. Maybe he was going to tell his father about it.
“The very one. Well done on nearly sealing the deal, old boy. She does make things hard, doesn’t she? I suppose you heard about her little fit of dramatics at Eclectic. What’s the world coming to, when a man can’t make a simple pass without being treated like a monster?”
Harry felt a bit like laughing, and a bit like crying. It was too soon. He hadn’t seen Malfoy for a year, and it was still too fucking soon. He’d known, intellectually, that they’d run into each other. But he’d manged to repress it, assume that they’d probably just see each other on opposite sides of the hallway. He was not meant to be here, in Harry’s flat. Not here, when Harry was happy and Malfoy was so clearly miserable. He had done the war, he had done death, which meant that he was very much done with Draco Malfoy. If he had the
“Good grief,” muttered Blaise. “I’d rather blocked that aspect of it out.” He caught Harry’s black look, and sighed. “Sorry, Potter. Diggory was a good man, and had a hell of an ass. Pour one out, lads.” He dribbled his drink over the table, and after a moment of sighing, the others did the same – all except Daphne, who clutched her Bellini with renewed vigour.
for him, but something approaching that. He was just so thoroughly beaten, that was all. There was nothing of the Draco Malfoy she remembered from school, and therefore it was hard to keep hating him minute-to-minute. “I won’t tell Harry,” she said. Though she kept her tone cold. She wasn’t a
Harry closed his eyes. “All right. I’m sorry about first year, when I didn’t take your hand. Yeah, you were rude, but that must have been embarrassing. I’m sorry about the time I helped Fred and George set up a fire-work to follow you around the on your broom during Quidditch practise.”
He raced up to Draco’s rooms when he got back. Draco was leaning against the sink in his bathroom, carefully brushing his hair. He always looked so neat, so calm. It made Harry want to ruffle him up again.
They were curled in Hermione’s room on the bed, silently eating toast. Hermione was not looking at him.
It was just a bit lonely, she thought as she watched Draco dance with Harry, when you were the only one standing there.
“Sure,” said Draco. “Subject Dean and Blaise to socialising with a vocal homophobe, just so that Seamus can one day learn his lesson. Sod the damage to them.”
“Nah, I get it.” Seamus kicked the bed idly. “I was coming here to apologise, you know? But I guess this is how it’s gonna be now. Is this what turned you bi, Dean? Seven years touching your prick after lights out, waiting for Harry to notice you? Thank god I fucked off earlier so you could make your move.”
Harry sighed. “Look, maybe you should make sure you’re near another pair. You never know what she’s going to throw at you. If you’re concerned for your safety, don’t be a hero, tell your superior – “
He shifted and pulled her towards his chest. “Because you are – I don’t even know how to phrase it, Pansy. I mean, all the ways I know to phrase it aren’t for people like you and the way I feel. The best thing I can say is that it’s – recognition. I look at you and I see something I don’t see anywhere else, and it’s something that you don’t let a lot of people see but I get to. And you look at me and see me. Was that ok?”
“Woah, woah, Harry.” Ron held up his hands placatingly. “I don’t think she’s, like, evil-in-the-proper-way. I just meant – it’s gonna be a bit awkward, isn’t it? And she’s always so mean. I’m not exactly the best at… well.”
“Oh.” Parvati’s hand holding the bottle fumbled, and she caught it loosely. “Are you – committing to Terry or Anthony then?”
“It’s going to be fine,” said Dean when Harry caught him in the kitchen. “Everything’s just a little bit awkward now because I acted like a lunatic. But that’s fine! That’s life, you know? Sometimes, you cock up spectacularly and everyone forgives you in the end. Usually via alcohol. Tonight will be perfect.”
“I think the night Sirius died was the night I became ok with the idea of not making it through the war,” he’d said, and Ron had nodded at the non-sequitur and held Harry’s hand.
“And meanwhile, we’re here!” Dean spread his arms and indicated their dingy surroundings. “They’ve got a pinball machine and…. And beer!”
“Something like that,” said Seamus. “I didn’t see the note. He just told me to get you for Hermione and then sprinted off.”
“What, tell the lecturer that he’s a vile criminal shit? I told you, ‘Mione, I apologised to him. I’m just going to do what Blaise said. Ignore him.”
told me that I’d got it right the first time. So I want to know. Why did you lie, when I asked you last night?”
Seamus turned. His nostrils flared, his mouth twisted into an ugly grimace. “Sorry, Potter, was I keeping you from your hot date?”
“Nah, you cretins, it’s the name of a song – ok, who’s got a CD player? We’re getting wild tonight, lads. We’re drinking with rock royalty. Oh my god, Zabini – Dean, move over, I’ve got a new best friend.”
Realising her feelings for Parvati also meant that she needed to break it off with the Ravenclaw har- the three nice young men she’d been dating, who she
“Of fucking course,” scoffed Seamus. “Harry just couldn’t wait to be there for him, to hear all about poor little Dean and all his problems, and maybe they’ll just get talking to how I’m a bastard and then Dean will want comforting – “
“You’re such an overdramatic bastard.” He stepped between Draco’s legs and touched his face. All those sharp angles and strange features, combined into something beautiful. “What I mean is that you should come and stay with me at Grimmauld Place.”
haven’t said anything,” said Pansy. “What about you, Potter? Anything over here you want to comment on? Any extremely abnormal behaviour you’d like to ask a
“You…were?” She tried to keep her cool. These days, seeing him didn’t bring back any memories of his hideous house, or of mad cackling laughter. She’d done a good job of telling herself that he’d suffered too, they all had under the Dark Lord, it was time to move on. It was telling that she always got stuck on the fact that he’d
“He spent Christmas cooking for the homeless,” said Pansy. “Or possibly just cooking the homeless. The homeless were involved somehow. He’s very committed.”
“Draco!” Harry said the next day, springing out of the bushes (?) outside his law lecture. “I’ve been looking for you for the past week, I just wanted to – “
Blaise flung his arms wide. “I’m going to throw a party. A proper one, not one of our shitty little flat ones.”
“Maybe you should do something like that,” said Harry. “I mean, maybe something less violent. And don’t hurt any dragons.”
Malfoy looked at the ground. “Because I never had to beat Granger. I always had to beat you. And I lost.”
The man curled his lip at Harry in a way that suggested he hoped the pub would go up in flames. Malfoy was biting his lip and suppressing his laughter.
“Have you ever cast an Unforgivable?” He held up a hand at Harry’s splutter. “For fuck’s sake, I’m not going to
“Well, you know. No point getting dressed!” He ran out of the kitchen, spilling a decent amount of the water down his robe. Draco hissed when he saw it.
They stared at each other for a long moment, and then both collapsed into giggles, frantically shushing each other. It felt just like being back at Hogwarts again, slamming the portrait behind them as they  narrowly avoided Filch, but better.
“Why would she?” said Seamus, at the same time as Hermione said “Yes.” She grinned at his shocked expression. “I’ve been knowing things that Harry needs to know for him for years. You’re with Susan Bones, Terry Boot, Morag Macdougal and Blaise Zabini.”
“Don’t like what, Seamus?” said Dean. “You’ve been dancing round it all term, trying to avoid coming out and saying it, and I’m sick of it. What don’t you like? Come on, tell me.”
“My siblings are white. Kind of hard to miss. When I was little, I thought I might be adopted, but mum was pretty clear with me. So yeah, I’m the black, queer kid in a white straight family.”
of that has ended up on my trousers – “ said an unforgettable voice, and then Harry rounded the corner and found Draco holding Theo Nott up by the armpits as he vomited into a bush.
“Good man!” Blaise thumped him on the back, all trace of whatever-that-had-been gone. Harry felt uncannily like he’d been conned.
The Sunday before lectures started, Harry finally got around to going up to London and meeting with Ron. They went to a Muggle pub, because Harry was famous in an itchy, unpleasant way now, and Ron was not without his own fans.
“All right,” said Pansy. “I wish I could say that I truly, dearly cared about the poor little victims I’ll be helping to avenge, but the truth is that after seventh year it looked like my plan of marrying rich and living in luxury for the rest of my life was out the window, and the Aurors seemed like a good place to channel my penchant for violence. Is that enough for you, Potter?”
Harry looked up, like an idiot. What did he expect to find, a phoenix? But no, there was mistletoe, cheerfully menacing.
“When we’re out of here, you’re Harry. When we’re fucking, you’re Potter. Best that way. Lines don’t get blurred.”
“It’s fine,” he said. “You should probably go to bed, Hannah. I think everyone’s just a little drunk.”
He gripped Draco by the small of his back, dragging him foreword. He used every inch of his height, tilting Draco back. One of his hands stroked Draco’s throat, tugging on the short licks of hair at the nape of his neck. He felt the moment Draco broke and started kissing him back, earnest and messy and desperate. And in his head, he was already doing the calculations – could he get Draco up on the kitchen table? How quickly could he drag them back to his rooms and get him out of those robes?
“Oof!” Her victim doubled over, and Hermione suddenly felt, rather hysterically, that she was going to cry.
“I’ve got a problem? You seem like the one who can’t get rid of me fast enough, mate. Slobbering all over Blaise Zabini – and isn’t that a fucking laugh, thousands of wizards to go for and you go for that prick – “
“I kind of need a piss,” said Goyle. “Will you still be going when I come back or should I hold it?”
“Well, there was Lav of course. And then when it became apparent that the whole kissing thing was something I wanted to talk about and Lav didn’t, I started doing a lot of reading. Most of that stuff I’d leant you. A lot of poetry. Muggle stuff. Wizards don’t seem to have a flourishing queer community, even though Sappho was definitely among us.”
“Though let me be absolutely clear here – if Dean decides tonight that he’s going to shack up with Terry or Anthony or some anonymous twink at a bar? Good for him. If I’d been fucked around the way you’ve been fucking him around I’d be champing at the bit for a good shag to get it out of my system.”
“I find it very amusing that you’re shagging a bloke but still can’t talk about it,” said Theo, completely unamused.
She raised Hermione’s abandoned drinks. “To our golden childhood. Long may we repress our traumas. Did you know Amycus Carrow once told me he’d relax the uniform rules around skirt lengths just for me? And then followed me back to the common room to make sure I ‘got safely to bed.’”
Malfoy bared his teeth in what was nearly a smile. “Neither can I. But I guess we all have to learn new skills in this brave new world.”
“You’re lying, aren’t you? Fuck, I knew they were terrible. I had to go to a Muggle Tesco. And then I acted like a total buffoon and tried to pay with Galleons, because – “
apparently after Napoleon’s wife who was, in the words of the abbreviated biography on the cocktail menu, “a real badass bitch” who paved the way for women around the world. Hermione wasn’t quite sure what being the wife of a despot who tried to conquer half of Europe helped pave the way for. Perhaps Eva Peron and Imelda Marcos were thankful.
Parvati cocked her head. “Um, ok. Wow. You seem like you’re going through a lot right now. But – yeah, I can see how what Padma said sounded really bitchy, though I’m still not sure why I have to suffer for my sister’s sins. You know we’re sharing with Anthony and Michael? And Terry’s just upstairs?”
Yeah, she’s studying law too, so we’ve got a bit of a study group going together. Well, not really a group. It’s just the two of us, or sometimes Susan. I suppose we should invite Malfoy too, but it’s quite nice just to be around other women, you know? Not that you’re not great – I just wish I’d had someone like her at Hogwarts. Apparently I’m full of internalised misogyny. I’ve been reading all these really cool feminist authors – I have to lend you my Audre Lord. I’m learning so much, not just outside my course. I just feel – “ She sighed dreamily. “I feel like I’m really expanding my mind. Like I’m becoming a new person. Don’t you feel changed, Harry?”
Blaise sighed. “I was asking you if you had any plans to join a society, but fuck it. Just ask me what you want to.”
She waved a hand. “No, nothing like that. Casual sex only. I said as much, and he said as much, and it was all very nice and friendly.”
“Of course not,” said Blaise, through gritted teeth. “Because that would be a crime, and he definitely wouldn’t be stupid enough to talk about that in front of an auror.”
a nice place for a summer home,” he said, topping up her champagne. “No neighbours around for miles. Isn’t it worth knocking over a few giants for the sake of a weekend of true debauchery?”
“You have my deepest sympathies,” said Blaise. “What happened, if I might ask? I’ve only heard one side of the story, and I can’t imagine it’s accurate. Have some more wine!”
simply fucking. Potter was simply experimenting with his sexuality, and Draco was someone he didn’t care about and could therefore fuck with.
“It was not,” said Hermione, furiously. “It was selfish and awful and did nothing but make you feel slightly better while potentially endangering Malfoy’s education and his chance to rebuild his life. It was quite possibly the worst behaviour I have seen from you ever, Harry Potter, and I think we can both agree that I’ve seen a lot of shit from you.”
“What is your problem,” said Dean. “Ever since I came out, you’ve been weird. You’ve been fucking avoiding me, and then acting like you haven’t, and if you’re going to be a homophobic tosser about this again at least let me know so that I don’t keep trying with this friendship.”
mum. My siblings all crack jokes about it. Just stupid, sexual shit, there’s nothing really meant by it, but it’s all about gay sex, you know? Like, we’ll be eating hot-dogs and one of them will go
“Well,” said Parvati. She was carefully not looking at her. “That – that calls for shots, I think.” And she disappeared back to the bar, and didn’t raise the subject again.
“What the fuck was that?” Seamus exploded, as soon as Blaise was out of earshot. “Just as soon as I’m beginning to think he’s all right, he goes and carries on like that in front of us.”
He went to Hermione next, because she was usually more coherent than Ron. He took her out to a nice place just off Diagon two days before Blaise’s party, and was about to raise the problem of Draco sodding Malfoy when Hermione looked up and gasped.
“Fuck,” said Draco, breaking for air. “Ok, look, I’d feel terrible if your first big gay adventure didn’t teach you some of the basics. Grab that bottle of lube over there.”
So when Harry looked out the window the next morning and saw Draco, standing in the courtyard and using the same cupboard to avoid the same mizzle as he smoked, he didn’t really think things through. This seemed like a sign from the universe. He needed to go and talk to Malfoy. It just felt right.
“Michael,” she said, in tones that she hoped came across as adult and mature. She had cornered him on a pub night. “I know that we’ve been – seeing each other.”
“It’s not,” said Harry. “I know that you’ve got reason to be a bit sensitive about these things lately. I just wish you’d come to me and told me the truth.”
“Abominable. Disastrous. Shit. I can’t believe I’m arranging a party in honour of Susan Bones. Blaise keeps on trying to get me to go on these secret missions to find out what her favourite colour is, or what kind of tinsel she likes best. Like somehow me asking it will be more discreet.”
But there were little moments where the pain of not talking about it was almost too much. When Draco was making coffee for them and bitching about his professor, his hands moving through the air like he was sketching the lecturer’s incompetence. Or when he caught sight of Harry trying to dodge an over-enthusiastic fan on a day out shopping and mouthed ‘famous Harry Potter’ at him with such a trademark leer that Harry burst out laughing and the fan, clearly worried, offered him a hankie. Or when Blaise told a story about the first time Draco got high – holding off Draco with o nr hand, who was trying to fling himself boldly on Blaise to shut him up.
“You’ve scrubbed up,” said Harry, taking in Ron as they pulled back. He was wearing a tight black shirt that actually fit him and showed off his new muscles. Had his shoulders always been this broad? God, his new found love of cock wasn’t going to start applying to
Hermione traced her fingers around the rim of her glass. “I spent my whole life knowing I couldn’t be this. And that should have been fine, you know? Sure, I’m not very pretty and I’m not very friendly, but I’m fucking
The sound echoed round the courtyard, freezing everyone in place. Theo stormed open to the cupboard door and wrenched it open.
“Fine.” He tried not to obviously panic. They weren’t obvious, were they? Sure, there had been that time the whole block had gone to the pub and he and Draco had ended up in the loos trading hand-jobs, but he thought they’d pulled it together convincingly afterwards. “How are you and Seamus?”
playing muffled from within, with Dean and Seamus doing a lip-synced routine. The alcohol had apparently curtailed the awkwardness between them, and now they were the same as ever.
“The Ravenclaw?” Ron bit his lip. “Well. It’s good that she ended up with someone as smart as she is.”
“Harry. Harry Potter. I don’t know if you’ve noticed this, but your dear friend Granger is quite popular these days.”
“That’s nice. Yeah, it’s really nice, seeing you getting a job on the right side of the law. I guess a job like this – well, it might help with those people problems, yeah? Not that you’ve ever had any work experience really, I guess.” He swung to face the barman. “You’re gonna have a job and a half with this one. I don’t think he’s ever really worked a day in his life.”
Seamus’s hands undoing his fly, the pale curve of his cock. It had taken a long time, the alcohol turning it into a desperate slow crawl to orgasm. Some of Seamus’s come had landed on his hand and he’d licked it off, unseen.
“You should come to the Burrow, mate,” Ron had said. “It’s not like things are awkward between you and Ginny.”
“I mean, you could go shopping.” Hermione glared at her from between her hands. “Orrrrrr you could let me take your measurements and my gorgeous twin sister with her own boutique will make you something, completely gratis.”
Harry left them to it, and took the tea that Anthony offered him. Then it was just him and Draco, leaning on either side of Hermione’s door.
“Yeah. It’s called Eclectic. Shit name, but George apparently paid someone a lot of money to come up with the branding. It’s this Saturday. Do you think you can make it?”
“But unfortunately, she refuses to see my ardent expressions of desire as anything other than an irritant, so I remain in miserable chastity.”
“Constantly. It’s very annoying. I’m trying to have a nice day, and there’s Harry Potter in my head. And now that we’ve gone back to hating each other – as if we ever really stopped, I suppose.”
He turned away slightly, clearly expecting Harry to go. And he should, he’d done what he came here to do. But he was bursting with curiosity, and he never could repress that when it came to Malfoy. It was probably a bit rude to blurt out with
“No,” said Parvati, kneeling down and pushing her way through the books. “Are you going to hurt me if I disturb your nest? You just look like you really need a hug.”
There was something very important in that sentence that Harry was missing, he knew it. “No straight boys. Got it. And maybe no Malfoy.”
“Mary Oliver.” She leant into Hermione, her beautiful hair brushing across their shoulders. “That one reminds me of you, you know. The ‘you do not have to be good,’ part. You push yourself so hard. Always having to know the right answer.”
Theo was looking between the two of them, scowling. “I’ll just be off then,” he said, but Anthony grabbed his wrist.
Harry thought about asking him why, and decided against it. He had no idea if wanting Draco to talk to him was some kind of sexual-awakening induced mania bought on by the kitchen boner, but that didn’t mean he wanted him to stop. “All right. Does the rapport have to involve talking about Dean’s dick?”
“It’s not about his sexuality! I guess – “ Harry shrugged. “I guess I was just beginning to think that I could think well of him one day. Maybe. Possibly. Because I thought if he’d been cut off by his parents it meant that he’d had a fight with them about their values. Finding out that he got cut off because he’s gay means that he probably still thinks in that shitty way.”
“And you invited all your friends?” said Theo. “This is what I mean, Pansy. All the fucking Gryffindors, laughing at us.”
“Apart from that brief interlude where you dated the most famous quidditch player in the world,” said Harry.
He hummed noncommittally. “Forgive me, Granger, but I find myself tired of talk of love these days.”
“I have to go,” he said, fleeing this bathroom. He looked like a lunatic. He probably was a lunatic, running after Draco again, Draco who didn’t want him. Just like sixth year, except this time he was even more lost.
She’d slammed the book shut. “Harry James Potter. You’re acting like a great big lump. Yes, you had to do a lot of awful things, but it wasn’t all you being pushed around. You’re a big boy – what did you choose to do?”
Draco was still shaking, still looking at Harry directly. The tremors had spread to his whole body now. “You suppose right,” he said. “I – I’ll go.” And he ran – literally ran – out of the room.
Because he was enjoying Harry fucking him. Loving it so much that he didn’t trust his body. He was rocking forward onto Harry’s dick each time he thrust, moaning and clawing at the bedsheets, and Harry couldn’t help himself, went faster, rougher.
“Ah,” said Blaise, “I see. Being related to bad people is the same as being one of them.” He waved his hand at Harry’s astonished look. “Yes, yes, Malfoy let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts and did evil and cunning plans and once spat in your porridge. I’m asking about what you think Nott did.”
“Pansy got beaten again today, Potter.” Malfoy leant over his desk until he was inches away from Harry’s face. “I get that I’ll always be hated. I understand that I’ll always be the monster in your story. But
“It’s Blaise,” said Draco, dropping to his knees and fiddling with Harry’s fly. “He once told me that monogamy was the only STD he’d never caught.”
“Sorry, sorry. Wow, hangovers really do away with my normal tact. Harry, it’s good Malfoy’s changed, but was this really worth getting me up so early for?”
“I don’t know,” said Blaise. “I mean, he’s my friend and I live here. But I imagine after tonight he’ll ask me to go over to theirs instead.”
“Leave her, Hannah,” said Susan. “Hermione, the regulations are vaguely worded to protect men like him. You wouldn’t get it. If you’d been in my position, you’d have slapped his face off before the first drink.”
“Oh, relax. I’m not that kind of monster.” He was staring into space, musing idly as the tip of his boot traced Michael’s spine. “No, I think I’m just going to Crucio you instead.”
“So,” said Harry – god, when was he going to stop occasionally fucking up and using the gits first name? – “I think I’ve worked out why you’ve been avoiding me.”
“Yes, I remember. I burned my Inquisitorial Squad badge in a tasteful ceremony in the Manor gardens shortly before I left the house forever. Umbridge was only headmaster for, what, six months? And in that time she had to make about six hundred rules just to cover every single situation, because you sneaky bastards kept on finding a way to get around them.”
“They’re like – they’re like these big lizards that roamed the earth millions of years ago. A bit like dragons but more, uh. Birdlike. But no wings. Well, some had wings. But no fire. I think.”
“Thinking of something else I’d rather lick.” He let his head fall backwards, trying to catch Draco’s mouth. Draco moved away, one hand squeezing Harry’s arse rather firmly as he did.
As soon as he left, Dean collapsed. He was shaking, actually shaking on the bed. Harry was angry and aroused and much, much more sober.
She did, actually, her cheekbones magnified. “Yeah. You look great. I’m glad you’ve got a girl friend.”
“I wake up screaming half the nights and call my sister at three am, and I miss my best friend so hard that sometimes I can’t breathe, and my parents treat the whole war like it can’t be mentioned and just want me to hurry up and settle down. I’m studying law because they told me to when I really wanted to study Divination – don’t laugh. I practise by myself sometimes, but I can’t get the clarity to see the future, and I think it’s because I don’t really want to. Because I think it might be ordinary.”
“Hey,” he said, jogging over to where Malfoy was smoking. He really didn’t want to do this, but there was an inner Hermione still yelling at him in his head. Why couldn’t he have dragged Parvati into his adventures instead? She seemed like she had much fewer morals. “I just wanted to apologise. That was really shitty, what I did last night.”
Dean felt like he’d been punched. “Wrong?” he said, and pulled away just in time to see Susan slap Blaise as hard as she could and storm off.
“Can’t sleep, can’t eat, every song reminds you of him,” said Blaise, checking them off on his fingers. “You know, Draco, those are pretty common symptoms of – of something.”
that must have startled the birds outside. He collapsed on top of Draco’s back, which was shaking. He was actually shaking, Harry had fucked him so well. He was –
“Never have I ever come out,” said Ron, and everyone but he and Pansy drank. Draco pointed an accusing finger at her.
Draco rolled over so he was on his front, looking down at her. “Granger. I wasn’t lying that day. You are beautiful. You just got a gay man to kiss you, come on.”
“Oh, fuck this,” said Hermione, clearing the table with a discreet charm. She looked up and found everyone staring at her with raised eyebrows. “What? Uni is about trying new things. I’m trying saying ‘fuck’. I’ve been thinking it for the past seven years.”
“Told you,” said Parkinson. “Lions have claws, you know.” She looked suspiciously like she was smiling into her drink.
“Fuck you,” said Dean. “Harry’s just a friend and yeah, I snogged him, but maybe that was because my best friend was disgusted with me and I was hurting and lonely and Harry was actually understanding and kind. And how dare you, how dare you talk to me about kissing Harry when you got drunk and made a pass on half the girls we know, and then actually shagged Hannah. So what, you get to go around shagging any girl you like but if I kiss a bloke then suddenly there’s something wrong with me? That Irish Catholicism really did a number on you, mate.”
“Please,” said Susan. “What are you getting out of this? Just – why do you keep coming back? Surely you can’t still find this funny.”
“Uh, truth,” said Harry, because he fancied he knew Blaise quite well by now, and he didn’t feel like getting arrested this evening.
“I just miss my best mate,” said Dean. “Come on, we spent seven years attached at the hip and now we’re barely talking. I’m sorry, all right? Is that what you need me to say?”
Harry thought of the mountains of food Molly Weasley provided every Christmas, and wondered how on earth duck-fat roasted potatoes could ever be seen as a sign of poverty.
Just – Let’s just talk in the courtyard, Ron,” said Hermione’s voice, and then Ron was loudly complaining about the rain as he came down the passageway. Harry and Draco exchanged identical panicked looks, and then by mutual agreement rushed into the secret cupboard, closing the door just in time.
“You are always attractive, Hermione,” said Anthony, grinning at her. “Even when you’re spilling secrets.”
“It was a pretty good club,” said Blaise. “Weasley might really have something there. My night was – fine.”
“It’s fine,” said Harry, grabbing Malfoy’s shoulder. “Cheers, mate. Ring up the shots on a separate tab, yeah? With the staff discount. He’s paying for that.”
“Quidditch and glory, the unofficial house motto. Much better than the Ravenclaw’s unofficial motto.”
“Teaching,” he said, smiling. “It’s a new one. It turns out that Muggles actually make you get a degree in how to get children to learn stuff, rather than finding someone who knows a lot about a school subject and just hoping that they can get teenagers to learn. So you don’t end up with someone truly horrible who’s just mean to the kids that don’t understand.”
They sprinted across the grounds, heads low and wands covered. Harry followed Blaise into his room, slamming the door behind him and leaning against it like Michael might burst through any second.
Michael was realising the extent of his mistake now. He glanced between Anthony and Nott, face pleading. “Oh come on, seriously? You’re going to act like I’m some kind of monster just because I –“
“Uni is a time for trying new things,” he said, plating their sandwiches. “So, who was it? Boot? Corner? Ugh, not Nott, was it?”
She’d taken her new satchel, one she hadn’t Extended yet, and even with it stretched to capacity she was still balancing five thick tomes under her chin. Still, she’d made it back to her dorm intact, and as she struggled with her key card she gave thanks that she was on the ground floor, even though last night she’d seriously considered writing a letter of complaint. Someone had been blasting music above her and, even worse, it had sounded like
“Gross,” said Harry, pulling on a robe. He found Morag, Anthony and Nott in the kitchen, arguing over some obscure point of magic.
“No, I did. I should have said thank you. I am saying thank you. You saved my life too, back in the Manor. So, yeah. Thanks.”
“This is going terribly,” muttered Draco. “Also, why is this the most dramatic courtyard in the world?”
Parvati waved her arm. “Please. Not to be crass but you’re Hermione Granger at a club opening. There’ll be paparazzi everywhere. All you need to do is tell one of them that you’re wearing Padma Patil and we’ll be even. Though if you want to treat it as a favour, there is one thing you could do for me.”
“Will always be us,” said Harry. “I promise.” And he meant it, even as a small part of him sat up and worried. Hermione was great, but she was probably going to end up with a whole bunch of Ravenclaw types who Harry wouldn’t be able to keep up with, and without Ron there to be stabilise them, would there be space for Harry?
and it gives me the tiniest sliver of hope that I can actually change. So you can’t push me on this, please. My dignity is currently held together with threads, and if you ask me - if you – You don’t have a clue about what I’m on about, do you?”
“Great,” said Malfoy, frosty again. “You’re digging into my personal life. Well, turnabouts fair play, Potter. Why did you break up with the she-weasel? Finally realised you have about as much chemistry with her as you do with a chopped flobberworm? She get bored of two round of lights-off missionary position a month? Or did she just finally realise you’re an insufferable priss?”
Seamus huffed again but did follow Blaise, which left Harry with Draco. Who was looking at him – actually looking at him for the first time in a month.
“I’m not being a dick here,” said Harry. “I get that being shitty to you just because you were in Slytherin isn’t fair, but Malfoy and Nott – they were actually involved with Death Eaters, as in the evil terrorist group that tried to kill me. That isn’t ‘let’s put it behind us’ stuff.”
“Myself, mostly.” Harry drank again. It wasn’t so bad the second time. “Sorry I said that. Actually, I’m not sorry. I mean, I am. But. It’s going to come up, Draco.”
“Knowing the indomitable Ms Granger, she’ll likely develop three new fields of magic in the process,” said Terry dreamily, and Morag poked him in the side and snickered.
He was in the queue – maybe he could jump it, because he was a VIP? – when a hand slid around his waist.
“All right, Harry?” There was Terry Boot, making his way down the corridor and looking particularly hale
“Me too.” Their faces were so close. “I can do anything when I’m drunk. I’m fucking untouchable when I’m drunk.”
Her voice was trembling, her eyes shiny. Harry took a surreptitious look around and dragged her behind a conifer.
Draco laughed, low and rueful. “I think all of us, with the exception of Blaise who was always a supernaturally lucky sod, are pretty traumatised. Maybe not Hermione. She doesn’t seem like the type who’d have time for flashbacks.” He pointed at Ron’s arms. “Can I ask how Weasley got those scars?”
“Right,” said Harry. God, seven years of rivalry with Draco Malfoy, and he needed to comb through them all and pick out every little thing that really, truly was his fault. He supposed he should start with the obvious. “I’m sorry about sectum – “
Pansy sneered. Harry filled with pride at Hermione’s new claws. A better friend would have stayed with her and backed her up. But he was rapidly realising he was quite a shit person, and Pansy might have important Draco related information –
“There’s a girl in the class above me in training who keeps on coming to ‘spot me’ when I’m working out,” Ron said. “She feels up my shoulders something awful. I’ve got Parkinson to come with me the last few times I go just to scare the buggers away.”
He’d almost thrown a strop. Almost, and then restrained himself, because Hermione had cut off almost all her hair about a week ago and he still wasn’t sure if it was a cry for help. Still, it was difficult to keep the bitterness out of his voice as he said “Just because I did it, ‘Mione, doesn’t mean I wanted to. Half this stuff I didn’t choose to do, and the other half I was rubbish at.”
Except it wasn’t, because nothing was safe with these Slytherins, so Pansy smiled a vicious smile and said “What, Potter, surprised that they let the likes of me in?”
That earned him a smile. “Literally nothing surprises me about you anymore. You are the strangest man I have ever met.”
And that's all she wrote, folks! Sorry for taking so long with this story. Even two pandemic related mental breakdowns couldn't keep it down. Theoretically there was meant to be a part two that would deal with some of the unfinished threads of this story, but - look, it took me three years to write this, and nearly a year to post it. Don't hold your breath.
“Merlin’s beard, Susan.” Blaise’s grip on the top of the chair was tight. “It was just a kiss. I’m not sure what you’re so upset about.”
- so Harry found himself with Hermione (who needed to take this for Law) at the back of one of the lecturing halls of the Royal College of Magic’s Muggle sister school, Royal Holloway, listening to
“Morag, Dean, Seamus, Nott and you,” said Harry, talking it over with Parvati later as they waited outside for their ethics lecture for Hermione to finish quizzing the lecturer. “And me,” he added quickly.
“This one’s going to hurt, but there’s no wrong answer. If you love him, is losing him going to be any less painful than losing your family?”
“Nah,” she said. She was eyeing a tomato with mistrust, her mouth full of Harry’s toast. “It sounds sick. I’m gonna get Parvati to do my make-up. What do you think, Harry?”
“Sure,” said Harry. “Blame Seamus. It’s not like he’s just following through on what his parents taught him or anything.” He didn’t know why he was defending Seamus – he was certainly acting like a tosser. It just felt wrong, somehow, to sit here and bitch about him with Malfoy.
“Wasn’t hard to work out,” she said. “Everyone else walked out of that cupboard and into a relationship, and you and Thomas buggered off in separate directions looking like you’d just heard that Ogdens was shutting down.”
“It’s so good to see you guys,” said Ron, slapping Seamus on the shoulder and grinning up at Dean. “These tossers have been listing Gryffindor faults for the last hour. I reckon it’s time to turn the tables.”
“Yeah.” He pulled out gently, rubbing Draco’s hole with his thumb just to feel it flutter again. “You’re – you’re so brilliant. I’ve never had sex – “
“Hello, Sea,” he said, wrapping a hand around his waist to keep Sea upright. He’d left Harry and Malfoy to the tender mercies of Pansy Parkinson, hoping to get a breath of fresh air. There was too much sexual tension there that he really didn’t want to probe.
“Fair enough. Seamus, you really do have the most lovely colouring. But I think there’s only one person here who really combined grace, class and a fabulous ass.” He stopped. “Dean, would you do me the honour of making me the happiest man in this pub?”
“Nope!” she squeaked. Ugh. “No,” she tried again, in a lower tone of voice. Too low. Now she sounded like she was growling at her. “No, I haven’t.”
He came again, and Harry couldn’t help it  - he had to touch himself, had to, and Draco was crooning sweet things and running his hands up and down Harry’s thighs and then he was coming onto Draco’s chest. Harry kissed him again, because he just couldn’t help it.
She tossed her hair. “You know what they say, you should try everything once except for incest and morris dancing.”
Harry poked Ron in the ribs, which earned him an elbow, and the two of them tussled a bit until an elderly man at the table next to him cleared his throat and gave them a pointed glare.
Sometimes, thought Morag, being the voice of lesbian reason was a thankless fucking job. She knew this, because everyone else was back at the flat celebrating their big romcom ending, and she was off to sacrifice a bottle of her best whiskey in the name of gay solidarity.
“Tomato gin for you,” said Parvati. “It’s fitting, because tomatoes are exactly what your babies with Weasley would look like. Anyway, if none of the three tickle your fancy, there’s a whole world out there of other men.”
“I get it,” said Parvati, nodding. “Things can only be casual for so long. I reckon Michael was going to ask you to pick him soon.”
at his chest, Potter touching him in the hallways of the Manor while Draco tried to warn him about Nagini but he couldn’t speak, he couldn’t. Potter pressing kisses to his neck, Potter falling into Feindfyre beneath him. The days were better, but not by much – Draco would be innocently trying to eat a salad and suddenly there would be Potter in his head, whispering
Blaise snorted. “And with such a heartfelt and assured declaration, how could we doubt? All right, Potter, it’s your turn. Pick your victim.”
“But that’s my favourite game,” said Malfoy, almost a whisper. They were very close together, Malfoy’s head practically in Harry’s shoulder. He hadn’t realised the slight height he had on Malfoy, or the muscle build. Their thighs were almost touching. When had they last been this close? The Room of Requirements, Malfoy’s thighs squeezing his. Right now, it felt like their breaths were intermingling.
Malfoy swallowed. “Because I need to say this to Potter at some point as well.” He was actually managing to look her in the eyes now. “But that will probably be quite some while in the future, given how long my pride will need to recover from this.” He caught her glare and sighed. “
Anthony was all right in Harry’s book, because he took one look at Hermione once they’d all left Susan to sleep and said “I’ll put the kettle on. Harry, you make sure Hermione’s all right.”
There was Malfoy, wearing – well. Wearing Muggle clothes, and leaning against the bar like a muggle, and handing over a piece of A4 paper while doing something with his mouth that was probably supposed to be friendly. Harry spun back around violently.
Blaise rubbed his forehead. “Darling, when you walked in here and saw me and Susan waltzing, did you not think that it was a moment better left uninterrupted?”
“I did finish one thing,” said Draco. “I’ll show you when we get to the block. It’s very impressive.”
“Good.” Blaise grabbed his arm. “We were never here, you understand? You and I passed the night delightfully studying alone in our respective rooms.”
“What’s blowback?” said Harry, and Morag, grinned, took a huge drag, and turned to Parvati. Parvati closed her eyes and the two of them leaned in together, mouths almost touching, Morag’s fingers skimming along Parvati’s cheek as she blew a cloud of smoke into her mouth.
Blaise hissed under his breath. There was something sharp there, hot and lonely, and Harry – well, Hermione always said he had a saviour complex.
“And then – I don’t know. Maybe – “ her tongue stumbled over the word – “fuck Terry? I mean, he’s handsome, and charming, and really sweet and funny. But then he’d also probably slide into the ‘marry’ category. And Anthony – I mean, he’s just so fascinating, you know? We can go into long talks for hours and hours. And it’s not just academically fascinating – he really thinks deeply about everything.”
“Ok,” said Harry, wondering whether to mention that Hermione already knew. He decided against it. “Can you do to me what I did to you, that last time? With the lube?”
“Why do you even care, Harry?” said Blaise, lighting another joint. There was a tight edge to his voice. “You’ve made it very clear that you don’t think well of him. So he’s a poofter, and you don’t approve. Surely that can’t be very high up on the list of terrible things he’s done.”
Pansy threw a straw at him. “I’m a new woman now. All about being in touch with my feelings and stuff of that ilk.”
Draco shivered and buried his head in his chest. “God. This is why I didn’t want to talk about it. I’m having feelings, Potter. Like some sort of first year.”
“Shut up – surely, surely I can’t have that much appeal. So what is it? What, Blaise, because I don’t know what to do with you. Some days you’re my best friend and you’re making me laugh and we’re cracking up at the world together, and it seems like you really respect me, and then suddenly you turn around and you’re mock-flirting with me. It’s giving me emotional whiplash, and I’m through with it. If you can’t respect me – “
“All right, so utilitarianism – bugger.” Her wand had started to chime. “Harry, I’m sorry. I’m going for cocktails in London with Parvati tonight, and I need to leave now if I want to be ready in time.”
Blaise beamed. “We’ll meet down here for pres at six and then I’ll take you over. I’ll run upstairs and get the others. Harry? Michael?”
“I propose a wager,” said Pansy. Her eyes were glistening dangerously. “It’s nearly Halloween. Draco and Potter, drink off, and the person who wins gets to choose the other’s Halloween costume.”
“For fuck’s sake, Greg.” He put his head in his hands. His friends were awful. “No, not since third year, that was back when I still hated him. Since – since – “ When had it been since? He couldn’t really pinpoint a start date. “Since two weeks ago, probably. And what did you mean, you thought you told me?”
Theo was a useless art gay who mostly spoke in incomprehensible riddles, but Draco was getting it then. “So does this mean you’ll stop avoiding me and start coming out with everyone again? If it helps, it’s all dead awkward all the time now. Blaise has started talking about poetry with Michael, and I think Parvati’s going to hex one of them soon.”
Michael’s stuff disappeared from his dorm-room one night, along with Michael. Harry found Susan leaning against the doorway one day, looking into the empty room.
“Tell me if I’m out of line but – how would you feel if you’d never got to kiss Ron after the battle? I know you broke up, but – eight years leading up to something, you needed to know, right?”
The night was raucous and Seamus’s CD collection large, which was why no one herd the door opening. Harry only realised when Blaise went rigid, and he turned and felt a bit like he’d been runover by the Hogwarts Express.
– fine, sure. What’s next? Deontology? All right, that one’s simple, it’s just following rules. Oh, my mistake,
But Draco was already striding towards the door. He paused. “I know you’re bad at respecting boundaries, Potter, but you need to respect this one. Else I promise you, I’ll just disappear.”
“I’m not acting like a lunatic,” said Draco. “I’m repressing my feelings, like a good Slytherin. I’ll figure a way out of this, somehow.”
“No offence, Theo,” said Pansy, her voice acidic, “but if I ever suffer a traumatic brain injury and feel the need to ask for love advice, I will dig up the mouldering remains of Voldemort himself and ask him about boy stuff before I turn to you.”
He ended up wandering home early, his head spinning from the dancing and the booze until it all got a bit much. Hermione gave him a half-hug and told him to be careful – her other arm was wrapped around Parvati’s waist – and he nodded blithely and stumbled off. It was a nice night, soft and clear, with a the moon a little over halfway out –
The truth was, it had become unexpectedly hard to spend time with Parvati after realising that she was possibly, maybe, a little bit into her. It wasn’t like Hermione had just suddenly noticed she was gorgeous. It was just that previously, when she’d plastered herself to Parvati’s side and told her that her hair smelt good, it had the safe cover of female friendship. Oh god, she’d probably been really annoying, hadn’t she? Practically following her around, worshipping her wherever she went, gushing over every book she recommended –
There was a peeling green door in one of the science building walls, half hanging off its hinges, and when he and Parvati had kicked it open last night they’d found a deep cupboard, completely bare and surprisingly spider free, where they’d chain-smoked in comfort when a late-September mizzle started as Harry bitched about Malfoy.
“Sod romance,” said Blaise. “In your pants, Harry. Everyone else is using uni as a way of expanding their sexual horizons, and you’re – “
There was a small snuffling sound, and it took her a second to place it. Harry was crying. He wiped his eyes, looking sheepish.
They ended back up at the London Stone, because Dean insisted it was hilarious. They caught the Muggle bus over there, because Hermione said it wasn’t appropriate to apparate into a Muggle area when some of them didn’t have the best grip on landing where they were supposed to,
“You’re so lucky you found love young, like us,” she’d said, dreamily. “I’ve only ever been with one man, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. You never have to worry about all that dating or messing around or settling down. You two know exactly what you want.”
“Right. What Blaise said,” she said, but Harry wasn’t listening. Malfoy was sitting right on the front row, straight ahead, with his notebook laid neatly in front of him. He hadn’t even turned around to look at Harry. Possibly he didn’t know he was there. How could he not know? Harry felt like he had a Malfoy-sense that was constantly pinging whenever the bastard was around. He had an honest-to-god Muggle pen in his hands. Where had he even gotten a Muggle pen from? Had he stolen it from a Muggle?
“I was gay long before Potter,” he sniffed. “And I’ll still be gay long after this temporary insanity has ended.”
“He does terrible things for you ego,” said Pansy. “Remind me to have him arrested on false charges as soon as I actually make auror.”
“With pleasure,” said Harry, not taking his eyes off Malfoy. He slammed the door behind him, and brooded furiously while he pissed.
Seamus looked like he was having a breakdown. “Blaise Thin-Lizzy Zabini, you are a fucking legend. The boys are back in toooown!”
Draco was, however, finding plenty of time to talk to Seamus. Harry had seen the two of them studying in the library, or eating a picnic lunch in the sunshine. Draco’s eyes always slid off him. Apparently
“And snogging Harry,” said Seamus. “I thought you weren’t into all that Chosen One worship, but apparently you just can’t wait to gobble down some Golden Boy dick.”
“Hullo, Malfoy,” said Ginny. She was looking at him with a sharp expression, and he abruptly remembered that her brother had died in the war, and another one had been turned, and maybe he shouldn’t be sitting so close to her just because he had Harry’s protection.
“Great! So great. I’ve got to run. See you soon.” And Blaise took off at a sprint, still somehow moving with eerie grace.
“Would it have made a difference, Potter? You’ve already decided what to think of me. You’ve had eight years of choosing what to think of me. I was eleven years old the first time you decided I was scum, I hadn’t even done anything yet. You didn’t even know me. I was being nice. What is the point of grovelling, Potter? What is the point of humiliating myself even further? You’re never going to change your opinion.”
you.” Blaise sounded very, very tired. “He’s just trying to rebuild his life. Just ignore him, and he’ll ignore you. He’s served his punishment as decided by society. Doesn’t he deserve a fresh start?”
“Hermione!” There was Parvati Patil, waving to her with her twin sister just outside the door to the flat. “It’s good to see you.  How was your summer?”
Ron cupped her face gently. She was probably crying. Oh god, she was crying about the girl she was in love with in front of
“I’m not doing so great either, you know. And I don’t know if you saw that in there, but he doesn’t want to talk to me.”
“Ok, it’s just – I thought I knew what love looked like. And in my head, it looked like Ron and Hermione. It was familiar, and comforting, and safe. And you – you are none of those things. I guess I thought they would always get back together, because that’s what love is, right? But today – not just Ron and Hermione, all of them. Love isn’t safe. Love is reckless and terrifying and comes at you with no warning. Love is Blaise Zabini braving a Muggle supermarket because he’s out of ideas, and love is Pansy refusing to be beaten down by Theo, and hell, maybe sometimes love is actual, terrible pain.”
“I don’t think Dean will like that,” said Harry, thinking of Dean’s broken form last night, his whispered confessions.
“And what about you, Pansy?” snarled Hermione. “You might have swapped out one set of please-look-at-me clothes for another, but you’re still the same underneath. No substance, all – well, I hesitate to call it style.”
When he came back out, he found Blaise and Susan in the garden, joined by Dean and Seamus. They had also managed to get hold of some weed, and Harry took the proffered joint from Blaise’s fingers.
“No, darling, you’re not following.” Pansy jabbed a finger at him. “You’ve been in love with Harry Potter for years. You just noticed it two weeks ago. May I ask what bought this sudden realisation on?”
“So,” said Blaise. He was smiling. “Which is it going to be, Michael? Drop out of university for a while, or an unfortunate accident?”
“Of course,” Draco sneered, looking every bit the schoolboy bully. “Well, I’ll just get on my knees for you, shall I? Or would you prefer me up against the wall?”
“It’s where she belongs,” said Ron, but he didn’t look any less sad. “I just – I mean, the three of us – “
“Go,” said Draco. “I want to get in some proper Weasley torture time.” But he was grinning while he said it, so it was all right.
so there’s some nice anti-Finnegan sentiment going. I think Hermione’s whipping people up and demanding that no one talk to him until he’s apologised.”
“Sorry, Harry,” said Hermione when he looked at her beseechingly. “But I’m with Parvati tonight.” She shot a blinding grin back at the Ravenclaw boys – Anthony winking, Terry bowing, Michael fuming – and swept on without him.
“Sure,” said Harry. There was a teasing lilt to Draco’s smile as he walked away. Was he being cruel? Or was he trying to be nice? Tell Harry that it was all right to go cop off with somebody else? He’d meant to tonight, hadn’t he? That’s what he’d told Blaise. There would be somebody else out there who gasped like that when touched them. Somebody else who called him
“Oh absolutely.” She blew him a kiss. Harry darted his eyes quickly at Ron, but he just looked amused.
“What the fuck,” said Parvati. “What the actual fuck, Hermione. I mean, I always knew you thought like that, don’t get me wrong. It’s not like you were subtle. But what have I ever,
“Give it a rest, Parkinson. It was a polite question, and Harry’s not used to you. Maybe go easy, yeah?”
“Here,” she said, handing him the bottle. “Down as much as you can without vomiting.” She waited as he drank and then took it back, having a bit more herself for good measure before the boy necked it all.
“I think Terry Boot just came by to ask you on a date,” said Harry. “I might have accidentally scared him off. Sorry.”
Sirius had been drunk a lot, during Harry’s time with him at Grimmauld Place. Sometimes he’d called Harry
which continued to print the occasional photo of him on a night out lending Hannah his arm, or twirling Morag around the dance floor. Actual people who he cared about.
“Parkinson’s my partner,” said Ron, and even with his face made out of coals and flickers it was impossible to miss the abject expression of misery.
“Hello, all,” said Susan, giving Luna a quick side-hug. “Blaise told my uncle that his mother can only really be suspected of murdering three of her husbands, so we had to leave.”
She thinned her lips. “Parvati, Hannah Abbot, Michael Corner, Anthony Goldstein, Theo Nott, and – you promise you won’t get weird, Harry?”
“There was a vat of brains in the Ministry with tentacles, and – “ He was cut off by the noise of Seamus entering the pub with a bang, and then storming out of the front doors. He sighed. “Fuck. Sorry. I should – “
She took the next day off to study, and then met up with Terry after lectures for a coffee to politely end things with him.
Parvati snorted. “Oh come on, just one of you I could understand, but all three? Look, she’s lovely, but she’s not exactly a stunner.”
"Figured it out,” muttered Draco. “Sure. I’m going to hold your hand now. Try not to have feelings about it.”
“A degree in not being Snape,” said Seamus, and Harry forced his mind back to the sunny train compartment. “Will wonders never cease. Hey, you don’t happen to know who else is in our flat, do you?”
“Give me five minutes. Five minutes to fix this, please. Please, Susan, anything, anything you want, just give me five – “
“You’re a lesbian?” said Harry. Morag raised an eyebrow and gestured at herself, from the half-shaved head to the combat boots.
“No, Potter, I’m trying to fuck her. It’s not using if it’s a good time for all, you small-minded Puritan. But you may be right, about making a move on Saturday. I’ll dance her, romance her, keep her sober enough to not treat it as a mistake – “
She wasn’t exactly friends with either Susan or Blaise. Still, Susan had joined her and Parvati on many a study session, and Hermione felt it was important to pre-empt any awkwardness.
He couldn’t move. He couldn’t move, and clearly Draco couldn’t move either. It was kind of like that Muggle movie, with the T-Rex – they can’t see you if you’re not moving. Or maybe that was Velociraptors. Draco was more like a Velociraptor anyway. He should learn more about dinosaurs.
Well. Nothing like turning the tables on the snakey tossers – uh, the respectable Slytherins. “All right, Pansy. Truth or Dare?”
There was a moment where the library seemed to hold its breath, where their back and forth reached its natural point, and Harry was seized with the sudden urge to – to take Malfoy’s hand, to smile, to laugh, something that would mark this moment and keep it. He leant forward again, and Malfoy jerked a bit, his astonishing eyes going through ten different changes as he moved forward, then quickly away.
“I wasn’t complaining.” Draco grabbed the bottle back and drank. “I know. I just want to be a new person. But I can’t be, can I?” He grabbed the sleeve of his left arm and pushed it back, revealing his Dark Mark and spilling a decent amount of the gin on his trousers. He didn’t push it in Harry’s face. Just stared at it, sad and lost. “Same old Draco Malfoy. Always and forever. Written on my skin.”
She did end up smoking some weed, because she was possibly a lesbian now and also a fucking war hero who could do what she liked. Theo was very funny when pushed out of his shell by Anthony’s gentle encouragement, and just as nerdy as the two of them. They sank back into the grass, discussing magical theories that made less and less sense as time went on and the drugs got to them.
Like, you know – my mum said something about how if this was the path that I’d chosen, they’d support me. They always talk about my future as if I’m definitely going to end up with a girl. Or, actually – my mum will be talking about her kid’s weddings, and she’ll say something like “It’ll be so nice to meet your future wife, Dean. Or – or your
“Hey guys,” said Morag, poking her head out of the kitchen door. “I’ve got some great gossip. Did you know Ginny’s dating Luna?”
“Exactly,” said Draco. “Until they get so specific they’re barely rules at all, just descriptions of situations.
“And I couldn’t look away,” said Harry. “I think about you every second, do you understand? Even before we were shagging, I couldn’t stop thinking –“
Blaise went to get an empty pint glass while Daphne produced a pack of cards and spread them out in a circle, explaining the extraordinarily complex rules of the game. Harry tuned out and turned his head to look through the glass doors leading to the garden. He could only see Dean from this angle, but he looked furious.
Apparently not, because there was Parvati Patil, towering about a foot over Hermione and smiling like a real human being. She smelt vaguely of cherries, and her hair looked like the silkiest thing on Earth. Hermione hated her with a fury that was beyond human.
“All right then. Carry on. Least he’s gay. That’s something. Never get a crush on a straight boy, Harry.” Dean stared off into the night, his eyes dark and lonely. “Straight boys are bad for you. You think things that aren’t true, and you know they aren’t, but you convince yourself that they’re true and then it all comes crashing down, and you end up drunk in a forest alone.”
“Don’t.” That came hissed through his teeth with venom. “Here’s what’s going to happen, ok? You and I are going to get through tomorrow, and then you’ll go home for the winter break. When you come back, we’ll have spent three weeks apart and this – this – momentary madness will have been forgotten. You and I will go back to the way we were before, and you will never, ever, EVER bring up this moment again.”
“She keeps insisting that there’s nothing he could do. I don’t want to say it, but I think she might be right. It’s not like it will last forever, anyway. She’s going to be a good auror, you can tell. Eventually she’ll prove herself. I thought she might go a bit Malfoy, you know,
I’d forgotten that we were actually friends. I wouldn’t have treated Hermione like that, and I guess I got so distracted by the extras that I forgot to treat you as a person first. So I’m sorry. I don’t know if you managed to find anyone else to hang out with, but I know with Blaise distracted with Susan and Pansy drinking with Ron it must have been a bit shit on your own. Thought Nott was there – what
“Harry fucking Potter,” snarled Susan, grabbing his other arm. “You and me are going to have a little chat about Michael Corner.”
“I want the nicest one,” he said, and she plonked two shots of something black that smelt like coffee in front of him. He raised a toast to Draco and then tossed it back without waiting. Draco, looking irritated, did the same. It did not taste like coffee. It tasted a lot like petrol.
“Close enough to the truth,” said Dean. “Uni’s going to be amazing. Harry, have you seen that you’re in the same flat as me and Seamus? It’s going to be just like the boys room all over again.”
Even from people who didn’t believe in blood purity, who just thought that the thing to overcome was a Muggle childhood. But a lot of it was –
“What Pansy here is trying to say,” said Draco, grinding his teeth, “is that everyone my mother has picked out for me to marry is my cousin, to some degree.”
It wasn’t Seamus, tight and flushed with booze and shouting in his ear. There wouldn’t be that feeling of invincibility. His breath wouldn’t stutter in his throat when he touched Neville, and his lungs wouldn’t burst, and his heart wouldn’t give out.
Harry considered this as he plated up the fry-up. On the one hand, Draco hadn’t actually said it was going to happen. Had said exactly the opposite. But. They hadn’t been able to keep their hands off each other. Draco had whispered that he was beautiful. Well, actually his precise words had been “
“Hmm.” Draco sat down in the chair opposite Harry and tapped his nails thoughtfully against the desk. “Yes, ok. Casting an Unforgivable is wrong, right?”
“Awww,” said Harry, pushing a blushing Draco in his chair. “I can’t believe you put that much thought into it, and the best all of you could come up with was ‘Potter Stinks’.”
“Malfoy’s not on great terms with his father, these days,” said Harry, and launched into everything that Malfoy had done, from generally existing –
“I’m morally opposed to this shitshow,” said Nott, who seemed disinclined to say more. Harry ran inside to Draco’s room, knocking frantically on his door.
Brilliant flowers of ice exploded across the walls. They grew vines that raced across each other, frost-roses and verglass leaves threaded with delicate hoary veins, each bloom glimmering with a deep-blue light from within. Within seconds, the house was hidden behind a fairy-tale wall of shimmering loveliness. The last flower exploded high in the air above them, and the sky over the house was full of softly falling snow.
“Woah,” said Harry again, because apparently all his brain cells were determined to desert him tonight. Draco was wearing an exquisitely tailored grey suit, with a deep blue waistcoat and a tie-scarf-thingy in palest silver. An opal the size of a baby’s fist was pinned at his neck, and Harry couldn’t quite tear his eyes away from it. The pale colours combined with his near-white colouring made him look ethereal and unreachable. A thousand miles away from the boy who writhed on his cock. Harry was getting hard just looking at him. He tore his gaze away and focused firmly on the grotty routing by the kitchen sink. Nothing arousing about mould. In the corner of his vision, he could see Draco smirk as he started discussing fabrics and cuts with Hermione and Parvati.
