"Fifteen years ago, one month before Halloween, we received news from Dumbledore that the Potters may be in danger. A pregnant mother who was recently widowed by Death-eaters had been murdered in her sleep. The Dark Mark was spotted by the Aurors and when Dumbledore attempted to trace back the family tree of that family, he found that they linked back to Helga Hufflepuff. Thus the baby in that woman's womb was in actual fact the heir of Hufflepuff. Thus he deduced that the Potters may be in danger as the Heir of Slytherin may be hunting the heirs of the other founders." Sirius said
"Are you sick of Ron yet?" Draco teasingly retorted.
Suddenly the bubble disappeared and Draco's voice floated up to her. "All it meant was that we are likely to be good Aurors that's all. Sorry we almost lost control." Harry stood up and pulled Draco up. Both of them looked like they were back to normal.
"People would only think that your detention ended late. No one would know that you are missing till a few hours later. Or they may think that you are out playing a prank. By the time they find you, you won't be alive anymore." Pansy continued sneering at her.
"Then it's my fault too. I knew two years ago that I shouldn't get attached to people as they would be targeted for revenge. It is as much my fault as anyone else." Harry softly said, but in the silent room, it sounded unbearably loud. He gave Draco a soft kiss on his lips.
Dumbledore shook his head. "That's why it is so amazing to be able to see the transition from normal seventh years to powerful wizards. And that's why I love being a headmaster." He smiled as he left the room, leaving behind a thoughtful werewolf and an equally thoughtful dog.
"Well, I don't really mind, but that person at the door would." Harry replied in a mischievous tone to Ginny. He just caught sight of Ginny's boyfriend, Neville at the door of the compartment frowning at Ginny, as he heard Ginny's last comment. Neville was one of Harry's most insecure friends and it took Harry forever the year before to get the two of them together after he found out that both were interested in each other. However, Harry had noticed that Ginny had grown into a confident young lady and the relationship helped Neville feel more secure about him.
"See, you didn't believe me when I said that I could predict our first lesson. Double potions with the Slytherins." Ron muttered to Hermione.
"If I can't have sex, you two can't have sex. Harry, stop displaying yourself and go get yourself dressed. Shoo…" Seamus' frustrated voice brought Draco out of his thoughts as Harry winked at him, while being pushed out of the bathroom by Seamus. Seamus then came back into the sinks and started washing himself up.
"Nev… Neville Longbottom"
"He seems to approve." Harry smiled.
"Oh SHIT… Seam…." Dean reached his hand down to touch Seamus' hair, trying to urge him to take more of himself into his mouth. Seamus' mouth was warm and moist and his tongue was stimulating the underside of his cock. "Seam… can't hold back…" Seamus seemed to suck harder upon hearing that and Dean felt a finger thrusting slightly into the entrance of his body, the sensation being so surprising and with the three months worth of wet dreams urging him on, his body exploded into orgasmic bliss.
He stood up and raised his hands for silence in the Great Hall. The students quickly quieted down and looked at him. "I know you are all hungry, but there is an announcement I have to make. Last night, we found three students guilty of assault and rape of another student. The three guilty parties are Pansy Parkinson, Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe from Slytherin. Their reason for committing the crime was because they were under the orders of Voldemort to do it. Their punishment was to be stripped of all magical abilities and to be sent to the muggle prison for fifteen years. They have been expelled from Hogwarts and banished by the wizarding laws. I will not tell you who the victim is, but should you happen to know the victim personally, please be kind to the victim as the victim will need your help and understanding in the near future. With this, enjoy your dinner." With that statement, he sat down and food appeared on all the tables. The noise level went up as everyone was discussing about the issue and Blaise and Millicent looked at each other when they realized that they were the only Slytherin seventh years left. They quickly finished their dinner and left the hall as they found that their juniors were curious about their former roommates and made their way to their own dorm room for some peace.
"Believe me, you don't need extra credit assignments. You are already at the top of the class!" Dean exclaimed.
"You, my dear, is just jealous. Wait till you get someone of your own." Seamus said playfully as he also started tidying his bag. He never caught the grin Harry threw at Draco and the wink Draco gave to Harry.
"Who was it?" Blaise asked.
"Why is Harry so important that Voldemort would kill so many people to get to him?" Draco translated for Ron.
"Snape?" Harry wryly asked. Day nodded, as she rested her head on Draco's shoulders.
"So I should wait until I'm sure that this is really what I want?" Dean asked Harry, who seemed willing to give him space to think about the situation at hand.
"Wait a minute, since when is Malfoy pitiful? Herm, are you sick?" Harry asked.
The others all gazed at Day for a moment, before Ginny quietly said, "We are a weird bunch huh?"
"Harry, pass the chicken chop bowl, will you?" Draco asked Harry, eyeing the bowl that was in front of Ron. Harry sent Draco a glance, looked down at Draco's fork which Draco still held in his left hand, reached over to take the fork out of Draco's hand, used the fork to poke haphazardly into a piece of chicken chop from the bowl and placed the fork with the chicken chop back on Draco's plate. He then went on eating. Draco looked dumbfounded down at the slice of meat on his plate, sneaked a look up to the occupants of the table and saw Seamus trying to hide his smile by pressing his lips together in a straight line.
"So sure of yourself huh?" Harry brought his hand to the back of Draco's neck to bring him closer.
"Amazing in the fact that he doesn't know how good he looks." Seamus commented, looking at Draco. All Draco did was nod as he looked at the figure running. Draco was slightly aroused by the sight of Harry doing his warm-ups. He thanked Merlin that he chose a looser pair of jeans that morning when he dressed. Then he turned back to Seamus to find him scrutinizing him.
Hermione breathed in deeply and blushed, realizing that she just lost her composure in front of professors. She nodded, but remained staring fascinated at the whitish bubble and the two wizards in it.
Hogwarts was under attack.
"It was… you?" Day nodded to his question, picked up her broom, ruffled Draco's hair and making Draco scowl at her, and ran towards the team who was gathering at a corner of the pitch for instructions from the Captain.
Harry flicked a glance up at Draco's grey eyes, grinned and nodded. "Just now I was showering, it was really noisy, Seam… remember… silencing charm next time." Seamus and Dean just walked into the Study area and heard Harry's comment. Both of them blushed as everyone laughed at their expense.
"Some of them wanted to learn some chess moves. Most of them are going to analyze tonight's games to find out what a player did to win or lose the game." Day whispered back. Harry's eyebrows rose, wondering not for the first time why this game was so important.
Day suddenly felt her heart tightened, as the tears that she had been trying to hold back in the past week overwhelmed her and flowed down her cheeks. She burrowed her head on Draco's chest and started sobbing silently. All Draco and Harry could do was to be there, comforting her with their presence. She finally stopped crying, pulling back from the three-person embrace and smiled up at the two guys. She suddenly felt lighter than she woke up that morning, knowing that no matter what the future holds, she would still have the two of them to count on. She then pushed the two away and headed to the sink to wash her face. Lifting her face to look into the mirror, she grinned at the two boys using the mirror and said, "I'm thirsty and hungry. Shall we go out to join them? And hope that Ron left me some food."
"But what am I to do with my time? I can only study for so many hours."
"But somehow, you seemed nicer these few days." Neville pointed out.
"Ron, you do know that the prefects are going to hate the Head Boy and Girl this year. Both are SO hardworking. And most of the prefects are really lazy. I know from experience. Slytherins prefects are notorious for being unapproachable. I had a good year last year with the first years quivering whenever I walked past their group. It was so hilarious." Draco joked.
"Um, was there something I missed? Did I just see our dear Seamus blush? Dean, why are you grinning madly?" Ron exclaimed, confused.
Draco, who was always so cool and calm with everything that happened, seemed to be about to hyperventilate.
"No," Harry cut in, "it's not insignificant, it's important to me too, because you are my friend, and Seam is my friend too, and god knows, you guys deserve to be together if you like each other. I'm just pointing out that you shouldn't wait too long and also lamenting that I don't seem to have anyone, when all of you seemed to be at least eyeing someone and… sometimes, it gets lonely. Oh, now you're making me sappy. It's not your fault that no one likes me." Harry sighed.
"Don't you want someone to be with you for life?" Draco asked.

"I'm Dean Thomas."
"The rate you kids are feeding it, before long, it will be too fat to even patrol the halls." Remus had walked to their group after finishing his dinner, sitting down beside Dean. Sirius looked up at Remus, growled at him and went back to gobbling his food.
"Hello? Anyone there?" She asked, as she slowly approached the area where she heard the sound from. All of a sudden, a pair of hands came from behind and one hand clamped over her mouth as the other went around her neck. Her screams were muffled by the hand above her mouth. Another pair of hands came up and snatched her wand from her hand and grasped her hands in a tight grip. She could feel herself being pulled backwards, towards a wall, and suddenly felt herself going through the wall with her assailants trying to stop her hands and legs from hitting them. She heard someone yell a spell and all a sudden, her legs and hands could no longer move. Her assailants lowered her onto the floor and suddenly the lights in this room lit as she saw who the ones who attacked her were.
By lunchtime the next day, almost everyone had heard about the chess game that went on the previous night in the Gryffindor common room. Harry and Draco sat down to lunch with the rest after their free lesson. The two of them went up to their room to practice some spells from the library books they borrowed, but spent the last half an hour kissing each other senseless. Harry still looked a little flushed from the experience. Suddenly, two Ravenclaw sixth years appeared in front of them.
"Someone's leaking magic." Hermione said, noticing that Draco and Harry seemed to be trying to control their temper. Guessing that the ones who were leaking magic, she was afraid to approach them, as everyone around them became aware of the intensifying magic currents in the room. Ron's eyes went wide as he wanted to approach the two but was pulled back by Hermione.
"Okay. See you guys around. You too Snuffles." He cheerfully waved at the group as the panel swung open, opening to a small common room. This common room was different from the one downstairs as it seemed to be supposed to function as a study room. It was circular and along the walls were tables for studying. Chairs were tucked into the tables and the centre of the room was four one-person couches surrounding a small coffee table. The whole group followed Professor Lupin as he settled himself in one of couches in the centre, Harry, Draco and Snuffles settled into the other couches as the others went to the tables to pull the chairs towards the centre to surround the four of them. When everyone settled down, Harry spoke up.
As soon as the whole group stepped into the common room, Professor Lupin turned to them, "Can all the seventh year boys please follow me? Miss Granger, Miss Weasley, please follow me as well." He then turned towards the staircase of the boys dorms and went up the steps with Snuffles following behind him. Hermione and Ginny looked at the boys and shrugged, following the whole group up the stairs.
"Gin, you mustn't tease Harry this way, just because you have a boyfriend doesn't mean that Harry should have one. You should be on the lookout for a nice boy for Harry, not say this kind of words. Hi there, Harry! Sorry about what Gin said. Ron, I'm bringing her to another compartment to scold her. Come on Ginny." Ginny obediently followed Neville out of the compartment, after giving Harry a small wink and blushing. It seemed to Harry that Neville can't wait to say hi to Ginny either.
Harry spoke up. "There is nothing we can do till we really know what THEY are doing. And we don't really have many spies with Voldie because it's not safe for them. And everything did seem quiet. Voldie and the Death Eaters didn't even seem that stupid that they attack Hogwarts. What can we really do now?"
"I don't know." Draco answered, with his eyes closed.
Both boys blinked at the sudden change of subject. Both nodded, as they recalled their free periods in which they were actually unwilling to leave the dorm to face the outside people, as they just wanted to be with each other.
Day was lying on the floor, as pain surrounded her. How could anyone do this to her? Why? All she could feel was the knife slicing into her flesh till she could no longer differentiate where the pain was coming from. She had stopped screaming, just lying there, hoping the pain would either stop or kill her. Her eyes started to blank out, as the only constant thing was the pain. Suddenly she felt some one spreading her legs, and someone lifting her hips up. The next moment, she felt someone enter her, with a sudden burst of pain from her lower body.
"Okay Ron, I don't care about the wagers or anything. Main thing is to try to keep calm and treat it like normal common room chess game. I played you last night and you are really good. Okay?" Draco said softly, as they made their way to the chess set. Ron grinned and nodded at him. Draco got a wave of love from Harry through the mind link and sent happiness back to Harry. He looked up just in time to catch Harry smiling at him.
"Seeing that it's Ron who kept the bell, I assumed that it's Ron who was the mastermind? Good one Ron." Draco deduced. Ron just smiled as everyone made their way back to the Gryffindor dorms. Draco's earlier wonderings were correct as they all walked with Harry and Draco right in the middle of the group and Ron and Hermione's watchful eyes making sure that no one was going to create trouble for them. They came to the portrait of the Fat Lady and as Hermione was a prefect, she gave the password and the group stepped into the common room when the portrait swung open.
Draco licked his lips slowly, catching Harry staring at them. "Never? All the more to slow down. Kissed before?" Harry shook his head. Draco breathed in deeply. The fact that Harry was … SO inexperienced was so tempting. "Want to try a kiss first?" Draco whispered in a husky voice.
He subconsciously pitied the players, especially Harry. Due to the fact that the two of them deciding that learning how to transform into their animagus form was very important as a means of escape from danger, they had specially requested for Sirius to increase their lessons by adding a session on Monday evening. Between the Quidditch practices, extra Transfiguration lessons and their piling amounts of homework from the professors, all Harry had time to do almost every evening was fall into bed exhausted. The only chance the two actually got to practice new spells and interact was during their limited free periods and on Sunday. His bond with Harry had deepened due to their relationship, even though they had not yet gone all the way yet. They had not really discovered too many new powers, just that the emotional link between the two of them was stronger than before and that the two could actually dream at night together. Very often, they would comfort each other in their dreamscape when the other had nightmares. They also discovered that they could now handle charms and spells better than before and learn them faster too. Harry also discovered himself to be improving in his potion-making skills, such that Professor Snape could not really find many problems during his classes to deduct points for.
The two boys saw the spell leave Sirius' wand and fly in their direction. At that moment it was as if time slowed down, as Harry mentally constructed an invisible wall in front of both of them and Draco poured a little power into that wall to make sure that the wall would not allow the spell through. For fun, Draco changed the outer texture of the wall to an absorbing texture to see what happened when the spell hit the wall. Both boys stared at the spell zooming towards them, waiting for the spell to hit the wall.
The eyes of both boys went wide as Jon exclaimed, "You would? Really?"
"Let's dump our things and go find her." Harry commented, frowning as he got up. The group made their way up to their room. When they entered the Study Area, Harry muttered, "Accio Marauder's Map" and the map came zooming out of the room just as Harry placed his things on his table. Holding the blank piece of parchment, he touched his wand to the parchment and muttered, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good" and the map of Hogwarts appeared on the parchment. Both Draco and Harry were intently peering at it, trying to see where Day was. Draco found it first, as a sense of unease gripped his heart.

Draco knew what Blaise was referring to but he decided not to give a direct answer. He needed to know the reason why Blaise was asking before giving the answer. "Who was what?"
"Really?" Day looked up, smiling at Draco. He seemed stunned with her sudden change in mood and all a sudden the noise level of the hall went all the way up. Everyone was buzzing with the news that Draco Malfoy was also gay. Everyone around Harry and Draco settled down to have their breakfast, attempting to hide their smiles. Even Hermione had to hide behind the book that she was trying to read. Draco looked around and finally realized what happened.
Both of them turned to Harry and grinned, before turning to each other. "Good game, Malfoy." Ron smirked.
"Harry, what do you think is Draco's sexual preference? We need to get YOU a boyfriend." Seamus grinned impishly at Harry, as Harry blushed.
"She said she'll be down later." Ron answered, as he started helping himself to the food from the basket. Harry nodded and pulled himself up to sit beside Draco for his lunch.
Harry leant down and kissed Draco, gently sliding his tongue into Draco's mouth as Draco brought his tongue to trace Harry's invading tongue. Harry's hand started to slowly unbutton Draco's top as Draco's fingers also got to work on Harry's top. Draco then pushed Harry's top off as Harry moved his mouth to drop light kisses on Draco's neck. Draco's hand then moved to the waistband of Harry's pants, pushing it over Harry's hips as he moaned softly to Harry's administration of his tongue which was moving down to his nipples. Harry kicked his pants aside and moved his hands to Draco's waistband, as Draco lifted his hips to assist him. Harry then pulled both Draco's pajamas pants and his boxers down, past his hops, knees and legs and threw them aside. Harry then pulled back from Draco and looked at Draco lying there, still wearing the unbuttoned black silk shirt which was in sharp contrast with his beautiful and naked body.
Draco thought to himself as he walked towards Harry.
Harry stared at the back of Draco's figure as he disappeared into their room. He looked so lonely. As an 'outsider' it took Draco less then three hours to see what had been in front of him for six years. He recalled that since as a first year, after the welcoming feast, he would subconsciously let everyone enter the dorm room before him. His experience with his relatives made him used to walking behind everyone when entering a room. When they chose their beds, he had just accepted the only bed left, happy to at least GET a bed, never wondering why he had always got the bed furthest from the door. He never noticed that his friends in the recent two years had persistently waited for him outside the classroom to walk with him to the next class no matter how late he was detained by the professor. He just accepted it as house spirit. Then he remembered an incident when he was in the infirmary the previous year. Draco was also injured from the same Quidditch match. When he woke up, he was greeted by the numerous get-well cards on the table beside his bed, some of them even from students whom he never knew. When he glanced at Draco's bed, his table was empty, as if no one cared that he was lying in the infirmary. However Harry just shrugged it off at that moment. Then he recalled offering friendship to Draco in the Great Hall just now and briefly wondered how Draco had survived the six years in Slytherin.
Sirius and Remus looked at each other again. "Harry, it's true that only the Slytherin's and Gryffindor's Heir are left. However, we know something that Voldemort don't. He assumed that Parseltongue was a talent which only descendants of Salazar Slytherins have. It is not. The reason why Tom Riddle could open the Chamber of Secrets was not because he was the Heir of Slytherin. After all, Harry, you could open it. That just made Voldemort assumes that he is the Heir. But he's not. Heirs are passed down through the males of the family. And Tom got his magic powers from his mother." Remus answered.
When Day finally calmed down from her sobbing, she looked up at the two boys who had been patiently waiting for her to stop crying, although Harry cried a little with her. She gave them tearful smiles as Draco tried to wipe her tears away with a hankerchief and Harry tried to get her to lay on her back so that any injuries that had not been fully healed would not be aggravated.
"It's eleven. Day's not back yet. Detention should have ended long ago." Draco picked up his stuff, as he saw Ron and Hermione packing up. Harry packed his things up as well.
Their Subject Combinations
"This year we are focusing on spells that can transfigure animals into other animals. Then we will progress to the spells that can allow you to transfigure other people into animals. However, these spells cannot transfigure your own self into an animal. The only one that can do that is when you train to be an animagus. We will not be teaching that in our curriculum in Hogwarts, mainly because when you have completed the training, you will have to register with the Ministry. There are institutions in which you can apply for when you graduate from here to learn that, mainly because not everyone can do it, the process being very long and hard, as well as painful in the training. It is more useful if you can handle the spells I'm going to teach you, because of the variety of choices that it allows you. Animagus transfiguration does not allow you to choose the animal. Very often, the animal chooses you, depending on the character that you have. What you learn this year will help you in that area, should you wish to further your studies in Transfiguration. Now, please pair up. There will be a group with an additional member as we have an odd number of students. Please face your partner." Professor McGonagall ended, with the students turned their chairs to face their partners. Everyone chose to stick with the potions pairs that were assigned by Snape and Neville being the odd one out decided to join Hermione and Ron, thinking that if he did something wrong, Hermione would be able to correct the mistake.
Draco sighed with resignation.
Professor Lupin smiled. "That's a brilliant idea. Who thought of that?"
Harry grimaced. "I guess. He just wanted to encourage the relationship so that the bond can form and we can have better powers and… his Golden Boy will be more powerful than before."
"So are we going to stand here all day so as to examine that list of injuries? If you are really interested, all we had to do was to mutter a little spell and we could project that picture of Day lying there for you all and you can see it in full color instead of reading about it." Draco drawled, glaring at the professors. Snape glared back at Draco as McGonagall seemed insulted and was about to scold Draco for his rudeness. Draco continued on. "So, pray tell me. Where are those three animals now? Have they confessed? Why did they attack Day?"
"You know, I was wondering, why were Crabbe and Goyle sorted into Slytherin? They seemed to fit right in with the Hufflepuffs. Slytherins are supposed to be cunning." Draco snorted to Harry's comment.
Harry ran out of the room, carrying Day, heading towards the infirmary, hoping that they were not too late to save Day. As the rest of the group left the room behind Harry, Draco looked around for clues as to who was involved in this attack. He saw something gleaming at the corner and walked over to the table there. Recognizing the bloody dagger that was left on the table, he remembered seeing it when Pansy had showed him back in her fifth year. Pansy had said that it was a family heirloom. His face hardened as he realized that the culprit for the disgusting deed was Pansy, and her two henchmen who never left her side were likely to be involved as well. He then turned to leave the room without touching the dagger. On his way out, he saw Day's broken wand on the floor. He picked it up and held it in his hand, directing his anger towards it. He could feel anger and worry from his mind link and the anger directed to the wand became a burst of magical energy. A bright light flashed in the room and the next moment when he looked at the wand, it was a wand that was no longer broken. His eyebrows shot up as he looked at the repaired wand in his hand, and then placed it in his pocket. Looking at the room he numbly wondered if Day was still alive, due to the sheer amount of blood on the floor of the room. Using his own wand he sealed the room against entry on the way out, reminding himself to tell Harry about the wand incident afterwards when things had settled down. As he walked slowly to the infirmary, his mind was filled with murderous tortures for the three disgusting culprits who dared to do this to Harry and his family. He would see to Day, before seeing to the tortures.
He looked down at himself and found that he was dressed in his pajamas. Suddenly he felt fingers sliding into his hand and realized that it was Draco, standing beside him, dressed in his pajamas, frowning around the room.
Harry's eyes fluttered open, keeping his body immobile. He could sense from his link that Draco was still asleep, and he didn't want to physically wake him up yet. Looking at the blur in front of him, he realized that the past two months of frequently sleeping together beside each other had made the two of them used to each other in bed. They had fallen asleep the previous night just lying next to each other on the bed, but during the night, they had searched out each other in the centre of the bed. Harry was lying on his side, facing Draco when he woke up. Draco's face was leaning on Harry's shoulder and his hand was gently on Harry's hips. Their legs were entwined. Harry slowly reached up above the pillow and placed his glasses on his nose. Looking down at Draco's sleeping face, he smiled as he marveled at the fact that someone so good looking was lying beside him. He patiently waited for Draco to wake up, as experience told him that Draco would sense him awake and follow him into the awaken world soon.
While he was eating his only slice of toast and looking at his cousin breathe down his share of bacon, toast and eggs, he kept hoping that his uncle would finish his breakfast and they would be on their way. Two days ago his uncle had allowed him to make a trip to Diagon Alley to get his books and stuff for school, and as he was not able to inform his best friends beforehand, he had to make the trip alone. After buying his books and things for potion class, he went to buy some new robes for school as well as bring his old robes for lengthening. He used to be the shortest Sixth Year the previous year. After waiting for so long, he had finally gotten his growth spurt this summer and the running and push-ups that he had been doing every morning had made him quite muscled. This, however, made him outgrow all his clothes. Well, all but his cousin's hand-me-downs as they were so big that no one could outgrow their size. This growth spurt made him to the height of six feet (so he was still shorter than his best friend Ron Weasley, whom Harry last saw before the beginning of summer at taller than six feet and he seemed to be still growing). Harry then exchanged some money to do some shopping out in muggle London, where he could finally get some decent looking clothes and footwear to wear in the future. He walked past some guys who were wearing boots to complement their clothing and managed to get some boots for himself. His last stop was an optician who promised spectacles within half an hour and got a new pair of glasses. He walked out of the shop with his old pair of glasses on his nose and his new pair in a plastic bag. He did not want his uncle and aunt questioning his seemingly abundance in cash so the two days after getting his new things he continued to wear his old things. His uncle did not know that his parents actually left a vault in Gringotts Bank full of gold and he wanted to keep it that way.
The food was cleared from the tables, but the students wanted to watch the game as well. The only professors who did not leave the hall were Professor Lupin and Professor Dumbledore. Jon and Joseph came to Ron and Draco, offering the use of their sets, to which Ron agreed. Thus the sets were laid out on the Gryffindor table. Seeing that so many people wanted to watch the game, Professor Lupin cast a spell in which the spectators looked at the front of the hall which served as a screen. This way, everyone would be watching the screen, and not at the four players, creating unnecessary pressure on them. The students were to be quiet as well.
"That's the reason behind why Slytherin House had the tendency to turn bad. Not all of the people, but students who grew up in the environments where they are in constant contact with the power lure. After a while, they lose their sensitivity to their surroundings. That's when the dark lord comes around with all the so-called benefits and tries to convince you that a tattoo on your arm and death-eater robes is fashionable." Draco said, in a dry tone. He then noticed that the whole class was staring at him.
Harry's eyes went wide as he realized the implications of what Draco just said. "Dray… I… It's going to hurt a bit…" Draco nodded and pulled Harry down to kiss him again, as his hands went to Harry's boxers to get rid of it. His hands then moved to clasp Harry's hard-on as Harry arched his neck, whimpering at his lover's caress. He quickly pulled Draco's hands away and Draco pouted up at him.
"And also that it shouldn't be just because they are Gryffindors, they are okay or just because they are Slytherins, they are not okay. Get what I mean? House prejudice should not be taken into account here."
Just then the portrait swung open and Day entered with her group of Fifth Years. Some of the girls passed Harry and giggled. Day bounded up to Harry and stopped him. She then gestured for him to make a turn. Knowing that Day would not let him leave till she was satisfied, he made a turn, like showing off his clothes to Day. When he turned back to face Day, she leant close to him and whispered into his ears, "You look so HOT. Looks like Draco's going to have wet dreams tonight." She then ran laughingly towards her dorm room. Harry chuckled and turned towards the portrait, seeing from the corner of his eye that Draco was staring at him.
Harry then shot a glance at Draco. He knew that Draco and he were the only seventh years taking Advanced Transfiguration. (Draco's was taking Advanced DADA and Advanced Potions and Harry took Advanced DADA and Advanced Charms.) For the past year, Professor McGonagall said that she needed to get each other on par with each other's abilities before she could group the two together for combined lessons. Even though the two were still enemies then, Harry felt quite lonely turning up for lessons alone. Maybe she was afraid that she would have to spend time breaking up fights instead of teaching. And she meant whose abilities were NOT on par with whose? Harry frowned. He didn't want to lose out to Draco. Even though they were now sleeping in the same dorm, it did not mean that he was not competitive. He did care about the results he get, just that he also had other things on his mind, like Quidditch. Then he remembered that at breakfast when he compared his schedule with that of Draco's the only difference was that when he was supposed to go for Advanced Charms, Draco was to report to Snape for Advanced Potions. That meant that their Advanced Transfiguration was together.
"There is one thing we can do. Train ourselves up. In DADA, transfiguration and everything we can. We need to know as many hexes as possible. Learn to defend ourselves." Draco answered, turning his head to his left to look at Harry. Then he suddenly laughed, remembering something that Harry said a moment ago. Harry turned to face Draco, in confusion. "Voldie and the Death Eaters. Sounds like a band." Harry too joined in his laughter, still staring at Draco's face.
Thirty minutes had passed. Ron looked rather calm to Harry. Draco just looked bored as he waited for his opponent Joseph to make his move. Harry then realized that the two of them were people who actually look forward to attention. Draco grew up thinking that he was superior and deserved attention from people. Ron grew up as the youngest son in a family with seven children and was determined to seek attention. Both of them were actually quite similar.
"Harry, what did you call me just now?" He looked at Harry using the mirror.
, Draco sighed.
Draco Malfoy had been a rival of Harry's since first year when Harry rejected his hand in friendship, thinking arrogantly that he deserved a better friend than a person who made fun of people who were nice to him. From then on he had been against Harry in almost everything, from Quidditch to studies. The two of them were on par with their competition in their studies with Harry being better in Defense against Dark Arts classes and Malfoy being better in potions. Although they both lost out to Hermione, since she had the habit of studying about twenty hours per day and reading textbooks in the library for fun. The fights and quarrels between Malfoy and Harry were legendary in school and when one occurred, the whole hallway would freeze in position to watch the show. It was as if the two of them were performers. Harry once commented that if they actually charge admission to their fights and quarrels, he would be so rich that his family would not need to work for three generations. He often wondered what would have happen if he had accepted the offer then. Maybe he would have another best friend. Having more friends was better than having more enemies.
"It's stupid." Day finally muttered, finishing her sandwich.
From Sirius' point of view, it must have been quite comical, seeing both boys' jaws dropping due to the shock of the statement.
"Nope. No problems. But I do have some questions to ask you. So why don't you and Snuffles follow us up later?" Harry answered. Remus nodded and turned his eyes towards Sirius, who was now licking his paws, with the empty plate and a pile of bones in front of him. Harry saw his loving look and turned to look at Draco who was also staring at the professor. He lifted his eyebrow, to which Draco shrugged his shoulders. It seemed that there may be something between Sirius and Remus that they all did not know about.
The three remaining people stared at the closed door. "You know what the really amazing part is? The two of them did the spells and transformations in perfect coordination, without any talking. I know that they have a mind link, but it's only emotions. How did they do that?" Remus said, turning to Dumbledore, as Sirius changed back to his dog form.
"Why me?" Harry said.
Harry nodded, and grabbed his stuff to wash up.
Hearing Harry almost announcing his love for him to Ron and Hermione sent a feeling of being loved through Draco as he beamed up at his boyfriend. He sent that wave of emotion through their mind link and almost laughed out loud as Harry visibly shuddered and grinned down at him. Looking at the clock, he frowned as he saw that it was almost ten o'clock.
The trip was rather short, September the first happening to be a Sunday, causing the traffic to be smooth. Harry actually reached King's Cross Station at eight fifteen, giving him an additional forty-five minutes till his train. His uncle did not even bother to get out of the car to say good-bye and as soon as the door of the car slammed behind Harry, he drove off. Harry couldn't be happier. Looking at the station, he grinned to himself as he went off in search of the restrooms. First he took off the atrociously big t-shirt and jeans and put on a tight-fitting shirt that he bought two days ago, as well as jeans that fit him better. Then he took off his old glasses and put on his new ones. He exited the cubicle to throw away the old t-shirt and jeans, as well as all the clothes that once belonged to his cousin. Then he put his old glasses into his trunk to keep it (he just could not bring himself to throw away the pair as one of his best friends once commented that it seemed to be a Harry Potter trademark). Looking at himself in the mirror, he was quite satisfied with what he saw. The thinner metal wire frame of his new glasses brought more emphasis to his emerald eyes and make him look less childish, his messy hair was styled such that the scar was being covered and his clothes seemed to emphasize the muscles he had gained from his workout as well as the tanned complexion he had gained from his aunt forcing him to work in the garden all summer. The final touch to the whole outfit was a change of footwear from sneakers to boots. He stashed his sneakers in his truck and zipped it up. One last look at the mirror and his watch, he picked up his things and left the restroom.
A few minutes later, he felt Seamus settle his body onto his as he opened his eyes to look up at his Irish lover. "You okay? I think you passed out for a second or so. I wasn't that good, was I?" Seamus smiled tenderly at Dean, before he pressed his nose into the wonderful spot of flesh just below Dean's ear and hummed contentedly.
"Is that why… you are not willing to come near me? Because… I'm dirty?" Day looked up at them.
Seamus, Dean and Ron had the rest of the day free as the afternoon was triple Advanced Transfiguration, Arithmancy or History of Magic. Both Neville and Hermione rushed off as soon as they finished lunch. (Neville due to the fact that he said that Professor Binns being a ghost did not require lunch and had the tendency to start his lesson when he felt like it and Hermione was stopping off at the library again.) Both Draco and Harry slowly made their way into a room near the transfiguration classroom, where they had been having lessons for the past one year. It was a smaller room, with the chairs and tables stacked along the wall. As they went in, they saw Professor Dumbledore with Sirius sitting at his feet. Both Harry and Draco recalled that when they left the Great Hall, Professor Dumbledore was still sitting at the teachers' table drinking tea, and wondered how he managed to reach the classroom before the two of them. Harry shut the door to the room and Professor Dumbledore waved his wand, locking the door magically. Sirius then changed back to his human form.
"For?" Draco asked, also sporting the class that Harry was looking at.
Suddenly Hermione realized that the vases in the rooms seemed to be levitating. She saw a chair wobble as it rose two inches above the ground. The tables started to wobble as well. She suddenly gasped, realizing that someone in the room was leaking magic.
"I can look after it for you. I'll be sitting in the stands. Just leave it there and I'll guard it." Sirius said before changing back to the black dog.
"Professor Lupin, I told everyone here about Snuffles in my fifth year. Unless Draco doesn't know about Snuffles…" Harry looked at Professor Lupin, not wishing to say more in case Draco really did not know the true identity of Snuffles.
"I need to tell you something." He waited for Harry to turn his eyes to him before continuing. "Just now, when I saw Day's broken wand on the floor of that room, I picked it up. We both were angry and I sort of directed my anger at the wand. All a sudden there was a flash of light and this was in my hand." Draco held out Day's repaired wand for Harry to see.
All these were observed by Dean who was seated behind Harry. He even caught the worried look that appeared on Draco's face when Draco turned to face the front.
"Wow, Draco! This is like outside, if you bring a lover to make love in this bed, it would look like you are making love outdoors! Can I borrow your bed some time?" Seamus then sat down at the end of the bed, looking up at the canopy. "By the way, I'm thinking of starting a fling. Who should I target this time? Which house? The only good looking one left in Slytherin is Zabini, seeing that Draco is here. Hmm…"
Draco poked Day's knee with his right leg. "You borrowed that book?"
"I was thinking about something. You guys told me that Day is a fifth year. And her O.W.L.s are lovely. Something is not right. People only take their O.W.L.s at the END of fifth year." Draco asked.
He felt Draco's hand coming up to caress his cheek, as he looked at him. Looking into his grey eyes, he lowered his mouth to Draco's left nipple, till he was hovering one inch above it. He softly blew over it, seeing the muscle under it tighten. He then heard Draco whimper, before sucking his nipple into his mouth, his teeth tugging lightly on it. Draco arched his chest up in pleasure.
Harry frowned, nodding his head indicating him to continue.
As soon as the whole class settled themselves into their seats, they noticed a cat seated on the professor's table. Everyone stared at the cat, waiting for her to stop cleaning itself. Back in the first year, everyone ignored the cat. However seven years later, they knew better than to do that. In fact all the Gryffindor prefects attempted to discreetly warn all first years in Gryffindor to never ignore the cat in their first Transfiguration lesson, so as to avoid detentions and point deductions. That was because the cat was actually Professor McGonagall's animagus form. She had often used that form to patrol the hallways at night. The cat looked around and realised that all the students had arrived and leaped off the desk, changing to Professor McGonagall's form. She stopped in front of Draco, politely nodding to him. "I trust that you were comfortable last night in your dorm room?" She asked politely.
"Oh. You are here. We were expecting you but not so early in the morning." He smiled at the two of them as Draco and Harry calmly backed two steps, not knowing who the strangers are. Their bodies tensed up so as to be prepared for anything that might happen.
, Harry thought to himself and felt that he should explain the situation that Ginny was just joking. He, however, was surprised at what Neville said.
The Gryffindor group ate their dinner slowly. They could hear comments on how their younger housemates always knew that those three people were evil and death-eaters. Harry had to admire Dumbledore for the fact that his announcement was precise and actually did not even give a hint on the gender of the victim. Common sense would make people think straight away that the victim was female, but the fact that Parkinson was also involved made it possible that the victim could be a guy too. However, no guy would really accuse anyone of raping him, for the sake of pride. It would take a while before the rest of the school knew that Day was the victim. The Gryffindor students in Day's year had already been informed of the incident and were told to pretend that the announcement was the first time they heard of it. All of them were sympathetic and promised to help. Day had earlier showed them that she was not so weak as to let this incident make her into one of those psychiatry cases, thus all her friends could do was to stand near her and be there to support her when she needed it.
"Intention to harm" Hermione answered.
Using a drying spell on his hair, he went back to his bed to comb his hair and to put on his robe. Then he rushed out to the Study area, passing Dean and Seamus who just came out from the bathrooms.
A feeling of uneasiness woke Harry up. He sat up in bed as Draco's eyes flew open, and he too sat up. Something woke them up. It was three seconds before realization came to their eyes to the fact that they had just received a warning from the guardians of the castle. Both scrambled out of bed as they realized that their worst fears just came true.
Ron nodded again. "Sure, what about today after dinner? Um… here?" Both boys nodded and went back to the Ravenclaw table grinning stupidly. Ron stared after them and looked back at Draco. "Those two are weird. They reacted like they expected us to refuse."
Professor Dumbledore looked up at the students who had seated themselves at their house tables, frowning when the food did not appear on time. It was times like this when he wished that he was not the headmaster of Hogwarts. He loved being around children, but there were some problems that no one was willing to handle, like the announcement that he had to make.
"I think we should sleep together more often. I definitely like the waking up part." Draco smirked at Harry.
, he silently sighed to himself as he lifted his right hand and grasped Harry's hand.
"I don't know. You were the one who wanted me to come in here. To talk, I presume." Harry looked at Draco, amused. Draco laid down on the inner side of the bed, trying to make himself comfortable without kicking Harry. Harry, thinking only of Draco's comfort, decided to lean on the bed on his elbows alongside Draco on the outer edge of the bed. When he looked up, he realized that his face was just inches beside Draco's face. Draco was very amused by the fact that Harry blushed upon realizing what he unwittingly did.
Day hurried along the dark passageways as she made her way back to the Gryffindor dorms. Her detention had ended late because of some plants which had grown too huge for their pots and Professor Sprout had requested their re-potting in the last minute. Glancing at her watch and reading the time using the limited light from her surrounding, she found that she barely had five minutes to go back to her dorm before curfew started.
"Okay, we'll have enough time to catch up in the next few weeks. First things first. Professor Dumbledore felt that since we are placing Draco together with Harry, then we should try our best to protect the two of them. Thus we took the seventh year dorm room and convert it to what you see here. There are two doors there, as you have noticed. One is a smaller room than the other. The smaller room only has two beds. We would like to ask Miss Granger and Miss Weasley to shift up here. Is it okay?" Both Ginny and Hermione nodded, as Ron grinned happily. "Even though we have two girls up here, no funny business is allowed, Mr Weasley and Mr Longbottom?" Ron and Neville blushed and nodded. "Okay. Obviously the other room is for the guys. As there are six of you, we made the room slightly bigger. The password for the portrait of the Fat Lady is changed every week. But the portrait outside here will be different. The password for Marcus to open the panel will be changed on every Wednesday and Sunday. I know that the additional password may be tedious for you all, but it will be necessary. The password for tonight is Protection. Later before you all sleep, one of you go out to Marcus and settle with him the password for tomorrow till Wednesday. The only other people who are allowed in here are the professors and the Headmaster. You have to make sure that you don't let anyone in here. Minerva would have made the announcement to all the other students of Gryffindor just now regarding the fact that it is prohibited for all students other then yourself to enter this room. Get it?" Professor Lupin made sure that everyone nodded. Neville was frowning because he had the tendency to forget passwords.
The lessons after lunch were Advanced Charms, except for Draco, who had Advanced Potions in the dungeons. Neville had the afternoon free and offered to walk Draco to the dungeons. Although Draco bristled at the fact that he had to be escorted to the class, he kept silent as he knew that it was necessary that he was not alone. Professor Snape seemed relieved at seeing Neville appear with Draco for the same reason. Upon completing his task, Neville couldn't wait to go back to his dorm room, exiting the dungeons quickly as Draco got ready for his lesson.
"Harry, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be bringing this up to you. It seems so insignificant compared to what you…"
The two of them listened against the walls of the compartment as Pansy went on planning torture on Malfoy, with the two bodyguards who currently belonged to her grunting their agreement every now and then, till Pansy announced that she was going to change into her robes as the train was reaching Hogwarts soon. Both boys then relaxed and sat down beside each other.
"Okay, request is approved by the other two too. You can attach a thread to the sphere just like Albus did. We'll snip off the thread after sending a warning to you mentally should there be any attacks. Okay?" Godric answered. The two boys nodded and both started to imagine the thread similar to Dumbledore's, till a thin silvery blue thread attaching itself to Dumbledore's thread. Draco did a illusion charm to it so that it would not be discovered.
"How do you know? I didn't… oh…. What if he doesn't like me? What if it's just lust? We have a perfect friendship going on! What if it doesn't work out and… Harry, stop laughing!" Dean looked so frantic that Harry finally realized that Dean was really feeling wretched for liking his best friend.
It was then that Harry's legs decided to collapse. Draco caught him on the way down and let him sit on a chair behind him. He sat on the arm of the chair brushing Harry's hair to soothe Harry. Using his wand, he muttered a cleaning spell on Harry's bloodstained clothes before leaning his nose against Harry's right temple. He needed to feel Harry near him, otherwise he felt as if he was going to explode at any moment. He could feel Harry trying to comfort him mentally. He briefly wondered if this was going to be how their relationship would be going, by him comforting Harry physically and Harry comforting him mentally.
"Two months. Obviously, Draco isn't a frisky dog like you." Remus teased his boyfriend. This time it was Sirius who blushed as the two boys grinned at his embarrassment. "But seeing that the emotional link have developed into the ability to do some wandless magic, it shows that your magic is melding more completely. Take your time with the relationship thing. But let us just see what other spells you can do without the wand."

Harry happily stared up at the canopy of stars again, trying to get his breath back and to cool his arousal down.
Passing through the barrier, the first thing he saw was the Hogwarts Express. People were boarding it, trying to find compartments for themselves. Harry looked around, trying to sport familiar faces. Then he saw a group of four redheads. Smiling, he walked towards the group. It seemed that Ron and his sister Ginny Weasley made the trip to the station with their twin older brothers Fred and George Weasley this year.
As Harry made his way back to the two of them, he wondered what they have been talking about. He then thought about the Dean and Seamus situation. Dean should be working faster. Seamus had been in love with him for more than a year. He was so hurt last year when Dean got himself a girlfriend. It was so obvious in that every time Dean and his girlfriend talked to each other, Seamus would latch onto Harry's arm and engage himself in everything but not to look at them. It hurt Harry to see his friend so sad. Now when Dean finally decided to notice Seamus, can't he work harder to get Seamus so that Seamus could stop thinking himself as unwanted?
"Dray, my run, remember?" Harry patted one of the hands still wrapped around his waist. He needed to hurry in his changing of clothes if he was going to be on time. Draco whimpered, finally loosening his arms and took over Harry's position as Harry made his way to one of the cubicles to change. He was brushing his teeth when he suddenly recalled what Harry called him a minute ago. He rinsed his mouth just as Harry came out of the cubicle.
Harry and Draco were left sitting staring into space. Then Draco turned to Harry. "Did he just tell us to go have sex?" Draco asked, astonished by what Dumbledore had said in the past ten minutes. He had just recovered from the shock of being the Heir of Slytherin, and now the news of being bonded to Harry fell on his head.
"No Hegwig, no letter today. Fly to Hogwarts' owlery and wait for me there huh? No point you suffer the journey with me to the station." Hegwig hopped to the window sill, hooted in agreement and flew out towards the direction of Hogwarts. Harry hurriedly grabbed his trunk and the empty cage, what Uncle Vernon referred to as 'trash', and opened the door to the room. He glanced back into the room to make sure that he had everything that belonged to him before rushing downstairs to place his stuff by the front door and started cooking breakfast.
The next moment, two forms shimmered into existence in front of both Harry and Draco and both of them blinked in surprise when they saw the two forms. Two jet-black panthers stood in front of them. One had gray eyes when it looked back at Draco, smirking; the other had green eyes when it looked back at Harry. The two panthers then looked at each other and Harry's animagus form sat down on the floor. Draco's animagus form then draped itself all over Harry's animagus form and lifted Harry's form's paw and started licking. Both Harry and Draco blushed at this display of intimacy from their animagus forms, as the two forms shimmered again, disappearing.
Harry deftly buttoned Draco's shirt till he looked decent, before answering, "But I don't want to be predictable." He then left the bed, hearing Draco chuckle.
Harry felt Draco's body stiffen even more if possible as he hissed out what he found. "Parkinson. Crabbe. Goyle. Found a dagger belonging to them that was still in that room."
"How come we can feel each other's emotions now?" Harry panted, because the kiss they had just shared made him want to kiss Draco again.
Hermione: Advanced DADA, Advanced Charms, Advanced Arithmancy, Intermediate Potions, Intermediate History of Magic, Intermediate Transfiguration
Harry then slowly brought his right index finger up to Draco's forehead and rested the finger in the centre of his forehead. Looking deep into Draco's eyes, he slowly brought his finger down the bridge of Draco's aristocratic nose, brushing Draco's skin lightly. He then used his finger to lightly trace Draco's eyes, which fluttered shut at the sensation of finger touching skin. Harry then lightly traced Draco's upper lip. Draco looked up at Harry and suddenly tilted his face up slightly, catching Harry's finger with his lips and such it into his mouth. Looking at the way Draco was sucking his finger made Harry's imagination run wild, as his eyes stared at Draco's lips and the look of lust he could see on Draco's face. Finally he pulled his finger out of Draco's mouth and the slightly wet finger went to the edge of Draco's jaw and continued down his neck, which Draco tilted to allow Harry freedom to do whatever he wanted. The finger then slowly ventured down Draco's chest, tracing a few rounds over each of Draco's erect nipples, causing Draco to moan softly and arched his chest up a little to feel more. Harry's finger made the walk south on Draco's body, towards Draco's belly button. Harry traced it lightly a few times, as Draco wondered where the next destination of the finger was, with arousal and anticipation.
Everyone then turned to look at Harry, who didn't look at all surprised with what he had just been told. "Well, I'm not THAT surprised. Dumbledore dropped clues and I did have quite a few years of time to figure it out. All I needed was confirmation. So there are two heirs left? Voldemort and myself? Is that why the world seemed to think I can get rid of him again?"
"No, there must be a reason why Voldemort came after my family. He didn't want my father. He didn't even want to kill my mum. Why me?" Harry asked again, never taking his eyes off Sirius. Everyone then turned to stare at Sirius and Remus.
Draco grinned. "He's not sitting next to you. Sit, Snuffles." Draco said, as Sirius sat, happy that he was going to be allowed to eat at the table. Draco then filled the plate in front of Sirius with food from the different food bowls and Sirius started munching his food. "Snuffles, manners." Draco commented disapprovingly, and Sirius whimpered and slowed down his eating speed.
"Well, I had always loved torturing myself. And I happen to LIKE potions. I'm not going to change what I like just because the teacher seems to be in a permanent state of PMS. No offense Draco." Day shot a grin to Draco and continued eating. "So, my dear Quidditch captain, tell me, when are you going to start torturing us this year?" She asked, directing the question to Ron.
Seamus was in shock for the first five seconds, with his eyes open, staring up at Dean. Then his eyes slowly slipped closed as he melted into the kiss. Dean's hands slowly let go of Seamus' hands and reached up to cradle Seamus' face. Seamus' hands moved to Dean's waist to hold him there. Dean then slowly brought his lower body to rest on Seamus' body and rubbed his body against Seamus. All he heard was a moan from Seamus, as he brought his mouth away from Seamus' mouth and he softly kissed Seamus' forehead, both his closed eyes, his nose and headed for Seamus' earlobe. He nibbled on it before whispering, "I dreamt about YOU. EVERY damn night for the WHOLE bloody summer." He then pulled back to look at Seamus' face.
"So what's going to happen to those three?" Harry asked.
Draco looked up to the blue skies as he laid on his back on the Quidditch stands. Subconsciously he could hear Ron's shouting as he bellowed at his players for their 'incompetence'. After spending two months helping the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain plan strategies as well as aiding him in his 'bellowing' during the practices, he had come to admire Ron's ability as a Captain. However, he had to acknowledge that Ron Weasley could really be a sadistic Captain at times. You could see that from the relentless way he trained his Senior and Junior teams. Although he first said that they were to start out slow when term started, but after their first Saturday practice, he was so dissatisfied with his team's performance that he upped the second week to three practices per week. Many a times, the players would drag themselves up to the castle after their practice to just fall into bed in exhaustion. Some of them even had problems getting up on Sundays after a full day of training on Saturday, choosing to laze in bed and do their homework there.
The two boys looked a little ill at the thought that they had to tell her the reason she was there. They exchanged glances and finally looked at her again. It was Draco who answered her question.
"Give me a while and I repay the favor." Dean lazily whispered, dropping a kiss on Seamus' shoulder. He didn't want to move at that moment as Seamus felt so right in his arms. Seamus shook his head. "Why ever not?"
"What do you want?" Harry softly asked.
Walking towards Platform Nine and Ten, he could still remember seven years ago when he stupidly asked a conductor about the way to Platform 9¾ and being scolded for being stupid. As a group of girls hurried past him, quite a few of them looked back at him, checking him out. Harry blushed slightly as he wondered if this was the right thing to do, to change his style of clothing so outrageously. He wasn't very comfortable of people in the wizarding world giving him attention because his scar made him to be the supposing 'savior' to save them from the evil overlord, as he seemed to be the only person which the Killing Curse did not work on. This Boy-who-Lived name always made him feel disgusted as he really did nothing and the scar was given to him when he was one.
Dean shot Seamus a look. Seamus for once was paying attention to the professor and scribbling his notes on the parchment, and did not see what happened with Harry and Draco. Dean cautiously leant over and followed Harry's previous position with his chest lightly touching Seamus' right arm and Dean's left hand behind Seamus. He nearly couldn't control his elation when he felt Seamus freeze up and shoot him a glance. He copied the notes he missed when he was observing at Harry and Draco and then slowly pulled back when he finished. He nearly smiled when he saw Seamus looking at him with the deer in the headlights look in his eyes and casually gave a grin to thank him for letting him copy the notes. He then faced the front, keeping an eye on Seamus' face. Seamus looked at his parchment, swallowed, and bit his bottom lip, before glancing at Dean again. He then seemed to come to the conclusion that Dean did not mean to lean that close and looked up at the professor. However, he did not continue to take down any more notes as his mind seemed to be a mess at that moment.
"It just means an easier victory for us. We may not even use all our good plays and can keep them for the other matches." Harry leaned against the sinks and stretched, blatantly displaying his body for his lover to drool over, which was working as Draco's eyes were glued to his chest and abs when he realized that his lover is nearly naked in front of him, covered with only a skimpy piece of towel around his lower body. Draco's breathing quickened and he licked his lips, as his eyes trailed up to meet Harry's emerald eyes, which were glinting mischievously. Draco's mind went back to the time he woke up after falling asleep from their 'first' bonding …
Blaise looked at Draco, trying to read his face. However, years of being a Slytherin and a Malfoy had taught Draco ways of hiding his thoughts. The only person he actually showed all his emotions to recently was Harry. Blaise sighed. "The girl who Crabbe and Goyle raped."
By then all the guys were in the room. Ron just sat down on his bed as it was not the first time Seamus rambled off such questions. But Seamus was the only guy who did not notice that every other guy in the room shot a glare at Dean, whose face seemed to pale when Seamus asked the question. He bit his lip when he saw the frown on both Harry's and Draco's face. Even Neville was frowning at him.
"Sirius, any idea what I'm going to do with my wand? I don't have any place to tuck it in." Harry said to the dog. The dog seemed to look around and then transformed back to his human form in mid-stride.
Sirius nodded, and asked, "What time, I'll meet you outside the Portrait of the Fat Lady?"
He continued doing it to Draco, before switching to the other nipple. Looking up at Draco's flushed face and feeling Draco writhe under him, he brought himself up above Draco's face and kissed his mouth. He opened his mouth and welcomed Draco into his mouth. He then placed his lower body against that of Draco's and… rubbed against him. Draco moaned into the kiss as his right hand searched out Harry's fingers and held tightly, as he started rubbing himself back against Harry, moaning as their erections rubbed against each other over layers of cloth, bringing pleasure to both boys. Harry stopped kissing him and brought his lips to the hickey he left on Draco's neck the previous day and sucked hard, as Draco rubbed back at him even more frantically. After some more rocking their bodies together, Harry brought his mouth to Draco's ear and whispered "Now" as he sent a wave of love through their mind link. It was the softly spoken command and the feeling of love washing over his body that made Draco release, allowing his body to explode in ecstasy. His release was carried over the mind link and Harry reached the peak at the same time.
"Don't. He's attracted to you too. All I ask for is that you don't hurt him. He already lost too many things in life. And he isn't like me. I don't mind flings because I'm selfish. So that when I'm lonely, at that moment, I have someone with me. He once told me that he mate for life, because he doesn't want the emptiness of flings."
Ron shrugged. "Don't worry. Most likely it ended late. She should be back soon." Ron said as he went back to frowning at the assignment that he had yet to finish. Harry nodded as he picked up his Potions textbook to start studying for a test that Snape was giving them soon, as Draco also went back to his book.
"Now, that's the grin I'm used to seeing, but somehow did not get to see it all week. What happened to it?" Draco asked, using his hand to tilt Day's face up to look at him.
The four of them entered the classroom just as the professor of the class, a ghost called Professor Binns appeared. Harry motioned Draco to the corner furthest from the professor as he had some questions to ask him and now was as good a time as any. Once Professor Binns started lecturing, Ron laid his head down and closed his eyes, ready to take his nap before lunch. Ron was not actually supposed to be in this class, as he dropped it after his OWLS. He was just here to keep his girlfriend company while it is his free period, seeing as it is no different from him going all the way back to the dorms to take a short nap. Hermione started taking notes for the class. Dean took out his sketchbook and pencil and started sketching, and Seamus started following Ron into the dream world. Harry took out a piece of parchment and wrote something on it before passing it to Draco, who wrote a reply before passing it back, starting a 'written' conversation.
Harry collected his wand from his bed and went into the Study area. Stopping at the panel, he stared at the movement chart that Hermione had put up on the wall beside the panel the first night they had moved in. Her reasoning was that it would be known to all where everyone was if they ever needed to know where to find someone. She also taped a copy of everyone's class schedules on the panel. All everyone needed to do before exiting was to run their thumb over a box at the top of the movement chart, thinking about what they were going to be doing, and the chart was enchanted to recognize their thumbprint, recording the activity and the time. Harry ran his thumb lightly over the chart, seeing the word 'run' magically appearing in the column labeled under his name, with the time stating 6.28am. Seeing the time, Harry realized that he had two minutes to reach downstairs. He pressed a button indicating that he wanted to open the panel, waved at Marcus who was barely awake, and raced down to the Gryffindor common room. He then opened the portrait and saw Sirius sitting outside, wagging his tail in greeting. He motioned Sirius to follow him and man and dog made their way to the Quidditch pitch.
he smiled.
Draco looked down at the offered hand, understanding what Harry was trying to show the whole school, and remembered Harry's rejection of friendship in his first year. Harry Potter was the first person whom he ever wanted to have as a friend and not acquaintances like Goyle and Crabbe. That night after the rejection Draco had lied awake on his bed swearing to himself that he was never going to let Harry Potter hurt him like that again. However, every time Harry defended that Weasley and insulted Draco, he was hurt again and again.
"Did I hear Neville say that there is a wager on my love life?" Harry finally said, after they finished laughing.
"Hey, we haven't even seen that git and you are all talking about nothing else. This is not a good topic. Change topic!" Ron exclaimed.
The Gryffindors then traveled to the Charms classroom in which they were to have the lesson with Hufflepuffs. The first Charms lesson was based on theory and the whole class sat in the warm classroom listening to Professor Flitwick drone on and on. Harry was seated next to the window and was looking out of it, only paying half of his attention to the lecturing professor. He was quite restless as all throughout the summer, his aunt got him working in the garden and he was not used to sitting so much in one day. He missed his morning run that morning as well as he slept in. Looking at his schedule he realized that he had one and a half hour free after Charms before dinner and decided to go for a run around Hogwarts. Looking out of the window, he saw Hagrid bringing his class to a shed behind his hut to look at a certain animal. Knowing Hagrid, it must be something that was very rare. Since they took their O.W.L.s every one of them was to revise their curriculum in which they specialized in two areas of magic. Care of Magical Creatures, which Hagrid taught was taken out of the curriculum for the sixth and seventh years, for them to concentrate on other subjects. That also meant that he had less chance to talk to Hagrid, who was his first friend. From what he knew, there were only three people in the seventh year currently taking three areas of specializations, Hermione because she was the top student, Draco because he wanted to compete with Hermione, and Harry himself due to the need to be able to defend himself against Voldemort. Thus the three of them were no longer needed to take the Intermediate Herbalogy classes. In terms of workload, Hermione still had the most number of classes as she was taking Advanced Arithmancy, an elective, meaning she had an addition Intermediate Arithmancy class that she had to go. (A/N: the subjects that everyone is taking is at the end of the chapter.)
"So this is a self-discovery thing?" Draco asked.
"As if the 'US' will not continue if he disapprove." Draco grinned.
"That's only because they know I appreciate the food they cook. And they loved to serve people." Ron grinned at Sirius.
For the next two hours, they revised through the spells they learnt in their first, second and third years. It seemed that both of them were quite proficient with doing the simple everyday spells.
"It's my fault." Draco said to the silent room. He could feel everyone staring at him.
"What?" Harry asked. Hermione then laid her head on Ron's shoulder.
Looking at his watch, he realized that he day-dreamed quite a large bit of the lesson away, missing the notes that he was supposed to take. Glancing at Draco who was studiously taking notes on his parchment which was full of notes, he slowly leant himself over Draco's right shoulder, placing his left hand over the back of Draco's chair, and started copying the notes that he missed.
"Most likely because Draco had to be taken out of his house, and they had to do a re-voting. You can't have a Head Boy who is not of any house, can you?" Hermione answered.
Day wasn't that hungry. She was chastising herself for all the mistakes she made that morning. Looking down at the group at the stands, and how everyone seemed to be with their beloved ones, she suddenly felt really lonely up in the sky. As an only child, she would have thought that she would be used to the loneliness. It didn't seem that bad when she reached Hogwarts, when she was surrounded by people, mainly the fact that she had friends here. And she did recently gain a 'brother'. She then recalled what happened on the first day of school, when she teased Draco, wanting to know what Draco's sexual preference was. She was so elated when Draco and Harry paired up in a relationship. However, casting another look at the group at the stands, she noticed that almost everyone was paired up. Ron was chatting with Hermione while Harry was resting by leaning on Draco and Draco was wiping Harry's perspiration off his forehead. Seamus had his head on Dean's shoulders and even the other players had friends chatting with them.
"I knew you will get the post. Knew it six years ago when you were scolding me in Charms. Congratulations, love." Hermione beamed at her boyfriend. Everyone around was congratulating her. Hermione then quickly finished her dinner, went over to the Ravenclaw table to discuss the date for the first prefect meeting before going to the Hufflepuffs table to tell the prefects the meeting date. Terry then made his way to Blaise, the other Slytherin Seventh Year prefect and told him to pass the news to the prefects of his house. Draco shook his head.
Neville gulped, looked at Hermione and answered in a hesitating tone. "It… allows the werewolf to… um… maintain its… humanity during its transformation?"
Everyone was then led out to the common room. "Even though this is like your own common room, make sure you go down to the Gryffindor common room too. It's not good to be cooped up here. Join those weekend parties. Socialize with you fellow housemates. Enjoy your last year at Hogwarts. Those precautions are only for the attacks, which may not even happen. Are you all going to be alright here?" Sirius asked. Everyone nodded and then after reminding them to change the password, Sirius changed back into his animagus form and both of them left the dorm.
Dean gave him a chaste kiss. "I know. I love you too." He said, seeing Seamus beam up at him. Seamus reached up to bring Dean's head down and he kissed Dean, moving his tongue into his mouth and trying to taste every corner of Dean's mouth. He pushed Dean onto his back, with their mouths still attached to each other, as Seamus's fingers started pulling Dean's robes up. They let go of each other's mouths as Dean flunked off his robe and Seamus took off his own t-shirt. Seamus then attacked Dean's neck as his fingers hurriedly unbuttoned Dean's shirt. As his mouth and tongue was worshipping Dean's chest, his fingers slipped down to Dean's jeans and nimble fingers unbuttoned and unzipped it. The next thing Dean knew, he was naked except for his boxers. Looking down, he saw that Seamus was still half-dressed, and he was about to voice his objections when Seamus' tongue started tracing circles around his right nipple, with his hands tracing similar circles around his other nipple. Dean swiftly forgot what he wanted to say and arched his chest up towards Seamus. Seamus looked up at Dean, locked eyes with the person under him and took the nipple into his mouth sucking it. Dean nearly leapt off his back at the sensation. At the same time Seamus was pinching Dean's other nipple, still looking up at Dean, whose eyes had closed to enjoy the sensation. Seamus then slipped the nipple out of his mouth as his tongue and mouth continued to worship Dean downwards. He delicately licked Dean's navel, and finally used his hands to take off Dean's boxers. Looking up at Dean, he caught his lover looking at him and maintaining that eye contact, he licked his lips slowly. Dean whimpered. Without warning, Seamus took Dean's erection into his mouth and sucked hard.
Harry nodded. "It is. Why are we whispering? Don't we have a silencing spell up?"
Harry looked around him, taking note of his surroundings. He last remembered making love to Draco.
One after another, the whole hall heard Ron and Draco checkmate their opponents and stick their hands out to shake hands with them. Both Jon and Joseph looked at each other and dejectedly shook the hands extended to them. The noise level in the hall went up as many were astonished that the Ravenclaws lost. The Gryffindors only crowded around to congratulate the two winners and to collect their winnings.
"Came in my pants. Just want to lie here, in your arms." Seamus said, shifting himself so that Dean was embracing his currently naked self better. Dean pulled the bracket up to cover the both of them. "Stay with me tonight?" Seamus asked. Dean nodded, kissing Seamus on his forehead.
"Let's keep this quiet. Not a word to any one else while I try to get to Malfoy." Harry look at Dean straight in the eye and finally Dean nodded his agreement.
"He does look cute when he pouts huh?" He softly said as he also walked towards the door.
Everything was being observed by Neville who was seated behind Seamus. He was trying to hide his smile behind his hand.
Ron looked at the hand in front of him, looked down at his pieces again, and up at Draco. He then shook his hand. "Draw. Good game."
"Lovely breakfast, wasn't it?" He commented, patting his stomach. Everyone smiled, while Hermione frowned. "Hmm… Seventh year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws. I took you lot a few years back right? As I start out for every year, I need to warn you that as a professor here, I'm not here to dictate. I know things that you don't know, due to my experiences, but you may know things I don't know, because no professors know everything. Facing a seventh year class means that I have this year as a last chance to educate you in terms of certain things that you may face when step out of Hogwarts. And looking at the curriculum that you had handled in the past six years, especially due to the constant changing of professors, you are not THAT prepared for the outside world. Some of you may make use of DADA in your future careers, as Aurors, or even part of the Ministry. For people who don't intend to use this aspect of magic, it will be useful to at least know how to handle the magical dark creatures out there, for your safety. However, in view of the fact that Voldemort had returned, I think that the only thing anyone needs to do is to think of one thing. The choice. Don't think just because you are still a student, you can push the choice of joining what we call the Dark or the Light till your graduation. As young Mr Malfoy had shown us over the summer that the Dark had started to recruit. Likely from people around you. People who is of the same age as you. People who could even be sleeping in the same dorm room as you. So one thing you need to decide is that would you want to follow the Dark or the Light? And if you want to follow the Light, what can you do to ensure your own safety above all else? Throughout the year, you will realize that DADA is no longer just learning about magical creatures or the unforgivable curses. The professors will be trying to link all seven years of your education in all classes. We may have what we call as joint classes, where you may incorporate your Charms or even Transfiguration education into your DADA classes or assignments. We will be having many discussions to train you to be able to think for yourself. Understand?" He looked around and caught some of the students nodding.
Professor Remus Lupin, the new DADA professor, was seated beside Professor Severus Snape, the Potions Master of Hogwarts, and was trying to see if he could catch sight of Harry. He finally saw a tall boy with messy black hair and bright emerald eyes smiling at him. He smiled back as he relaxed in his seat.
Draco smiled. "Somehow, I think we discovered our newest power. Maybe we should get Dumbledore to teach us wandless magic." Harry nodded as he relaxed onto the bed. He closed his eyes and could feel Draco doing the same, as both drifted to sleep after the long day. They would need the energy to deal with tomorrow.
Sorry to be taking the hiatus when left on a cliffhanger. This story was written many years ago, while waiting for Book 5 to be published. It got stuck in my mind, back when I was posting it on FF.net and when Reality got too busy for me, I put it aside. Then after reading the published books and watching the movies, somehow I got rather upset by the events in the story. The following chapters after this were supposed to be on the escape from Hogwarts and also how Harry and Draco will finally get rid of Voldie, but that was where everything got stuck. The world out there changed and then I actually had quite a lot of changed views about the whole fandom over the many years.
Harry was muttering to himself in his mind.
"What kind of powers?" Harry asked.
"I never did thank you." Harry answered, continuing to look at the first year class, in which some of the broomsticks refused to answer to the 'up' command of certain students.
Draco had realized that Day was no longer in the air, and yet had not joined them for lunch. He softly told Harry about it and they decided to check the locker room to see if she was there. On the way, he mentioned to Harry that Day seemed to be a little depressed and Harry said that he noticed a little of that too. He once saw Day sitting at the steps to the castle, with Snuffles sitting beside her, staring out into the sunset, with a forlorn expression on her face.
Harry read what Draco wrote and turned to stare at him. He then noticed that Draco's face had gone emotionless. He had always thought that he himself had a childhood that was not very good compared to many people, but at least his uncle never really beat him up. All he did was to ignore and insult him. That was why when Draco insulted him, he didn't really mind, as he was used to it. But to be beaten till there were scars or even worse, and to be given that kind of treatment by your own father… Harry licked his suddenly dry lips. Draco saw his reaction and snatched the parchment back to write something.
Harry remembered the Draco Malfoy he knew for the past six years. Then he remembered that when he heard Pansy order Crabbe and Goyle to beat Draco, there was a sense of protectiveness that he was not sure if it was due to the fact that he was attracted to Draco or that Draco was a fellow human being.
Dinner found the Gryffindor bunch to be rather lively as quite a few students stopped at the group encouraging Ron and Draco to 'slaughter the Ravenclaws'. Draco was quite amused by the fact that the younger students tended to forget that he himself was not from Gryffindor. Many of the Gryffindor boys were patting him on his back in encouragement for the game, as if they had been friends with him for years. The other house tables were just as lively, as students were chattering about the chess game. It was as if it was a chess tournament. Many of the other house students frequently made their way to two particular Gryffindor fifth years, who were Day's friends, as they were in charge of the 'school-wide' secret wager on who was going to win the chess games. The two of them were so surprised when Snuffles appeared in front of them before dinner, with two galleons held in his mouth. Day persuaded them to let the dog enter into the bet, and they wrote 'Ravenclaw' and 'Gryffindor' on a piece of parchment to let Snuffles choose who he wanted to bet on. Snuffles, of course, placed his paws on the word 'Gryffindor' and the two boys entered the dog into the bet, both of them wondering what the dog would do with the money if he won.
Seamus blurted out, "It's Harry isn't it? Of course it's Harry. You went with him on a walk on the Express. He's so smart and gorgeous. And there I was trying to pair Harry up with Draco… you must have been laughing at me behind my back, isn't it? Poor Seamus, not knowing that…" Seamus couldn't say anything more, as his tears were threatening to fall from his eyes. Dean's eyes widened, as he realized that Seamus thought that he liked Harry. Looking at Seamus who was almost going to start sobbing, he realized how much Seamus really liked him. It was humbling, and at that moment, he did the only thing he could think of and the only thing he wanted to do for the whole day. He leant over Seamus, grabbed hold of Seamus' hands, pinned Seamus to the bed and kissed him, put all his emotions into the kiss.
"But I don't mind waking up early for HER." Ron frowned at himself as he got up. "Harry. Ten minutes."
Everyone went back to their rooms and with a depressed air got ready for bed. Harry laid down in his bed for a moment, before getting up with his wand. He went to Draco's bed and crawled in, as Draco shifted nearer to the wall. Harry then set the alarm for the next morning and laid on his back, staring up at the starlit canopy. Draco sighed beside him, cast a silencing spell and turned to stare at Harry's face.
Day shook her head, looked down and continued eating the sandwich. Draco shot a glance to Harry, who seemed to not know what to do either.
She scolded herself as she attempted to blink back tears.
Harry sighed as he continued to frown down at the parchment in front of him. He was a little tired from his Quidditch practice, which Ron finally allowed them to pack up before dinner time. He shot a glare at Ron who sat opposite him, also frowning at the parchment in front of him. He knew that Ron was a little anxious about the Quidditch matches that were coming up, but the way he was torturing the team was as if their team was the worst team on earth. He then glanced at Draco beside him, who was humming to himself as he worked on his assignment. Harry rolled his eyes. Of course he was happy doing the homework. All three of them were working on their Potions assignment. Hermione was opposite Draco, doing her Arithmancy homework, as she had already finished the Potions homework on the day it was assigned. All of them were in the Gryffindor common room as Saturday nights was supposed to be spent with their housemates in the common room. Chastising himself, he tried pulling his thoughts back to the uses of the separate ingredients of Wound Cleaning Potion, but found his thought returning to his soul mate seated next to him.
Draco sighed. "We really can't do anything else worse than that? I want to dig their black hearts out with a spoon." Draco pouted.
"So Harry, what questions?" Remus looked at Harry, whose expression quickly turned serious.
"What does it mean… if a dot is… flickering?" Draco looked up at Harry, who was frowning at the flickering dot labeled Day Lee.
Harry looked back at Draco, and lifted his hand to caress Draco's cheek. "Not if I can help it. Promise." He smiled.
"What? That git is going to sleep in our room? Protect him, my foot. I hope he…ow…" Ron stopped suddenly as Hermione nudged him very painfully with her elbow.
"It's not that… I mean… I didn't expect the question. I… um…" Draco licked his lips. "guys."
As the water in the shower cubicle started, Seamus looked at the mirror at his own image, as he continued to brush his teeth. His appearance did not change much in the past few months. However, he felt that he seemed to have matured greatly mentally in the past few months. In the previous years, his life in the Gryffindor tower was limited to having fun, studying, bitching about potions lessons, and at the end of the year, maybe there would be an influx of house points earned by some terrifying adventure undergone by some of his housemates, which was happening right under his nose. It was until last year when he realized that his dormmate was not a really normal one, like Dean, but someone who did not go searching for trouble, and attracted trouble like a crazed bludger. He was never so involved with security meetings that Hermione stressed they should have, till a few months ago. The general consensus was that since the adults were not willing to share the information with them, treating them like children, they would come up with additional security measures to ensure their escape should the castle be attacked, and keep the secrets to themselves. Although none of them agreed with the notion of running away, except Draco, they agreed on the importance that their key concern was to stay alive so as to plan and fight a battle on their own terms. The cooperation in the whole group was good as every one knew what they were supposed to do. When Day was brought into the plans, she built up on the cunning component that was more lacking in the planning, even when Draco and Ron were good strategists.
Ron looked at Draco, seeing the honesty in Draco's eyes, and nodded, getting up, to keep his chess pieces. "Another game on Thursday? I need to train myself. Who else can I practice against but you?" Draco nodded in agreement, as they made their way to their room.
"Okay." Day let go of Harry's hand and went bounding up to Draco before Harry could say anything to her.
"Hi, we heard about the chess game. The two of us like chess too, and was wondering if we could play against you guys." One of them said.
"Draco, how was last night? Did the Gryffindors give you any trouble?" Snape asked him softly, making sure that most of the students had left. Harry was standing behind Snape in a stunned manner as he had never heard Snape sound so… concerned for a student before. Draco grinned at him.
"It's not important. What's more important is that you are here with me NOW and I'm never going to let you go. I'm going to parade you in front of the whole school tomorrow to tell them that Seamus Finnegan is not going to fool around anymore. And they can settle that stupid wager I heard going around regarding my love life that they think I don't know about. I love you Dean." Seamus started to drift off to sleep.
It was a while before Harry finally rolled off Draco. Looking at Draco smiling at him, he couldn't help returning the smile. "Morning." He muttered, as he bent in to give Draco a peck on his forehead, and muttered a cleaning spell over the wet area on the groin area of both of them.
"Yes. The werewolf is supposed to be like a wolf during its transformation every full moon. With the Wolfsbane Potion, the werewolf would be able to recognize his surroundings and people around him and will not attempt to bite his relatives and friends. In other words, unless provoked, the werewolf will behave like a tame dog around you. What are the ingredients needed to make Wolfsbane Potion?" This time when he asked the question, he pointedly stared at Hermione. Hermione went on scribbling something on the parchment in front of her and did not lift her hand to volunteer her answer. Draco raised his hand. "Mr Malfoy?" Snape glanced at Draco.
Dumbledore sighed. "They confessed under Veritaserum. The reasons of the attack were … they were under the orders of Voldemort to kill a good friend of the two of you and she was the only one who was really unprotected and had the tendency of not traveling in groups. She also offended them in the past two months. She was a chaser for the Quidditch team and they wanted Slytherin to win. But the main reason was that Voldemort promised them initiation into the Death-eater circles if they could kill your friend and get away with it."
Harry sat down beside Draco and grinned. "Only you would try to teach Snuffles manners. How was Potions?"
All of them settled down in the compartment as Seamus finally let go of Harry's arm to start a game of chess with Ron, while Harry just looked out of the window at the changing scenery outside. After a while, Harry noticed from the reflection of the window pane that Dean was staring at him. He turned to his friend and lifted his right eyebrow in question. Dean shot Seamus a look and back at Harry and then tilted his head towards the door that seemed to indicate that he wanted to talk to Harry. Harry gave a slight nod and got up from his seat.
Ron looked at Harry like he was mad. "You'll wake up so early for a jog?" Harry just smiled at Ron.
"Harry? Ready to tell me the reason to this sudden loss of control?" Draco softly asked.
"Ron, don't say such things. He is already pitiful enough." Hermione was frowning at her boyfriend, making Harry frown in puzzlement.
"Me four." Dean said.
The twins helped them load their trunks onto the train, and got off the train. Harry then looked at Ron and Hermione who were sitting opposite him, cuddling and sighed. "Ron, Herm, we are barely out of the station and you two are cuddling already. Herm, you just spent two weeks in his house, you are behaving like you haven't seen him for two months! What have you two been doing?" Hermione and Ron both blushed as they glared at the boy sitting opposite them.
"You mean you didn't hear?" Dean asked, after coming into the compartment with Seamus. Harry shook his head.
Ron looked up at Draco. "You weren't even frowning."
"And remember we said that we are going to learn to defend ourselves? We need to get a spell book and learn to not just use the spells that school teaches us so as not to be predictable. Get it? That's why you are here." Draco pacified the pouting Harry, as they stepped into the library.
What they did not notice was that while they were making love, the two of them started glowing. All the two of them were conscious of were the pleasure each gave to the other and when Draco could open his eyes to focus on Harry during the rocking and stroking of their bodies, all he noticed was how sexy Harry looked with that love shinning from his eyes and his black hair was being messy from the rocking, with his enchanted starlit canopy as the backdrop for the love-making. Suddenly Harry changes the angle slightly in his thrusting and the pleasure was even more intense than before. Draco could not control himself anymore and at that same moment, Harry also reached his peak. Both of them threw themselves over the cliff of ecstasy so intense that they both blacked out from the sensation.
"You didn't grow up having to hide your emotions from everyone around you. This is sixteen years of practice." Draco easily answered. "Any more secrets you want to drop on us?" He asked Sirius and Remus, who shook their heads. Everyone just sat back in silence to digest what they learnt that night. Remus was leaning against the couch Sirius was sitting and Sirius was unconsciously ruffling Remus' hair. They could almost hear Remus purring if he was a cat. All the students noticed and were looking at the two of them in amusement.
The two boys strolled into the Great Hall together for lunch. They were early, as many of the students were on the way out of classes, and the Great Hall only had a few people, waiting around for the food to appear. They saw Hermione and sat down opposite her, who only lowered her book for a moment to acknowledge the two of them before going back to her book.
She couldn't go back to the stands with this expression on her face, so she guided her broom towards the Quidditch locker rooms.
Harry smiled to himself.
"They're okay. I actually had a good night of sleep. Some of them defended me against Parkinson at breakfast. I think they actually think that I'm … nice. Right Potter?"
"Hi Hedwig. Don't worry. I'm fine.  Got here safe and sound. We're not going back again. Okay?" Hedwig hooted in agreement, spread her wings and flew off.
He asked himself.
"Harry, what fertilizer did you eat this summer? It's been only less than three months since I last saw you! Oh you got a tan! And muscles! And new glasses! And… And new clothes!" Hermione stared at the new Harry in front of her in wonder.
"No one likes you? You are kidding me. Before you announced that you were gay, the girls were fighting to catch your eye. Then after you made half the school heart-broken over that fact, we have the boys starting to be extra friendly to you to catch your eye. It's just that they don't seem to be effective as you don't seem to like them. And this appearance change, maybe this year you would get someone." Dean was desperately trying to comfort Harry. Harry then tried to smile at Dean and pulled himself out of the sappy mood.
Ron then slung his arm around Harry and said casually "I never did tell you about Bill, did I? Well, he IS gay. I don't mind gay people, so long as they are not after me. You aren't in love with me, are you?" He added worriedly, looking at Harry. Harry shook his head, noticing that Dean Thomas and Neville Longbottom, his other roommates actually didn't seem to mind as they were both smiling at him. All of them went back to changing into their pajamas. At least he didn't lose his friends over that. The next day Ron told his girlfriend Hermione Granger about Harry as she was also one of Harry's best friends and she also accepted his sexual preference. It seemed that the wizarding world was more accepting of gay people and Harry told his friends that he did not want to hide it. However, Harry, being Harry Potter the Boy-Who-Lived, was so famous that by the end of the day the whole school knew, even the professors. The new gossip from then on was who his current boyfriend was, but since he did not get a boyfriend at all the whole year, everyone was left guessing.
"Day, you kept us, remember? No matter what happens in the future, please remember that you said that and we are holding you to the promise. That means that we will be there when you need us. Not every moment, yes, but whenever you need company, all you need to do is to tell us. Okay?" Harry continued softly.
Harry made sure the bed curtains were closed properly before waving his hand, casting a locking, repelling and silencing spell. He then turned to his right, staring at the blond boy who was lying curled up beside him. He shifted slightly so that he was facing Draco and closed his eyes to rest. He could tell that Draco was going to wake up soon. Maybe it was due to the terror of being hunted by an evil overlord, that the two of them never needed much sleep at night. Ron used to wonder how they could wake up that early in the morning as Ron normally needed Hermione to literally drag him out of bed. Feeling Draco's affection over their link was Draco's way of greeting him every morning and he now felt a familiar wave of affection wash over him as his arms tightened slightly around Draco. Draco's head was conveniently tucked under Harry's chin as Harry felt Draco plant a soft kiss on his collarbone exposed by the neckline of his pajamas.
Madam Promfrey held up a piece of parchment. "Thank Merlin they brought her in then. We would have lost her if they had been ten minutes late. She lost a lot of blood from the numerous cuts on her body. Here's a list of injuries she had. She was raped as well. From the sperm sample I collected from her body, the analysis told me that it belongs to two men. I managed to heal the physical injuries, but the mental injuries can only be healed by her own mind. She's still asleep now, from the potions that I gave her."
Seamus pushed himself up to look into Dean's eyes. "When I finally got you after two years? Always. I'll always come back to you." He kissed Dean on the lips lightly before leaning back into his previous position, closing his eyes with a sigh.
What the two boys did not notice was that the glowing of their bodies had increased in the last few moments of their love-making and there was a sharp silvery blue flash when both boys came and collapsed into unconsciousness.
"You do know that I was never going to leave you to face Voldie alone." Draco softly asked.
"I told you I lost my virginity already. It's true but… I've… never been… taken before. I… I want you to take me. I want to belong to you completely." Draco said softly.
"I'm sorry. If I never came to Hogwarts, then you all would be having a normal seven-year education in here, instead of living in fear. Maybe I should go to Professor Dumbledore and just tell him to take me out of the dorms and…" Harry leant against one of the tables, not wanting to look at anyone's face.
"Dumbledore says that they don't want to involve students in the Order yet. I don't think it's a good idea. Students get information from their parents. Students share that information. News spreads. If we can determine who is trustworthy in the different houses and get them into the Order, it would be more efficient."
Draco panted with arousal. "Touch me."
"Why are we here?" Harry asked.
Therefore, the whole group of them found themselves settling down in their common room, surrounded by the other Gryffindors. Ron was playing chess with the different people in the common room, and Hermione and Harry were persuaded by Draco to teach him the new charms that they had learnt in the Advanced Charms class. His reasoning was that since he had time, it would benefit him to learn more charms. After learning the new charms, he ventured towards the chess group, while Harry joined the group playing Exploding Snap and Hermione went back to her books. When Draco came to the chess group, he found that the other students had ganged up together against Ron, with the only two spectators, Day with Snuffles, seated observing them. No one seemed to be questioning why the DOG was watching the chess game. Draco sat down beside Sirius and nudged Sirius to lay his head on his lap to be scratched.
"It's almost ten. Day's not back yet." Draco commented.
Harry blushed even redder and gave a slight nod. Draco slowly bent his head down and touched his lips to Harry's. It started out as a chaste kiss but that only lasted for three seconds. Harry caught Draco's lower lip and started nibbling. Draco thus tried deepening his kiss, by touching his tongue to Harry's upper lip and the next moment, Harry let go of Draco's lower lip as Draco stuck his tongue into Harry's mouth. Harry had never felt like that before and even though he was lying on the bed, he had a falling sensation and he brought one hand to Draco's hips and the other hand went behind Draco's neck. When both finally came up for air, Draco saw that Harry's eyes were dilated, his face flushed and his lips slightly swollen. Draco knew that he needed to be rational if they wanted to go slow. Draco got up and sat down, with his back against the wall, breathing like he had run a marathon. He looked at Harry, who was smiling, before Draco lifted Harry's right hand up to his mouth and gave a soft kiss on his knuckles.
Everyone else in the room was so shocked when they saw the sudden whitish bubble surround the two boys. They then heard the vases and chairs in the room landing softly on the surfaces and realized that the intense magical currents were no longer there. Seamus stretched his hand out to the bubble and realized that his hand could not even move any part of the bubble. He turned to stare at the others, whose faces except Dumbledore's showed astonishment.
Just then the portrait flew open, and Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Day scrambled into the Gryffindor common room, with Neville carrying three thick books. He dumped them on the table in front of the three seated boys and collapsed beside Draco, while pulling Ginny to sit on his lap. Hermione immediately settled down on the floor in front of the pile of books and lifted the first book onto her lap. She opened the book and within five seconds was lost in the wonders of that particular book, while the people sitting on the couch stared at her. Day sat down beside Hermione and with a bored look on her face, took the next book from the pile and started flipping through the book. The people seated then turned their eyes to her.
"What?"
Day chuckled tearfully, before starting to sob. All the two boys did was hold on to her hands and trying to comfort her with their presence.
Ron frowned, shot a glance at Hermione who seemed engrossed in her book, and replied, "I thought we'll start off slow, for the first two weeks. Saturday 9am to 1.30pm. Okay?" He asked, looking at his seeker and his two chasers. Harry nodded, followed by nods from Seamus and Day. "Day, help me spread the word, will you? I'll talk to McGonagall." He said, getting up immediately to talk to Professor McGonagall, who directed him to Professor Hooch to ask for permission to use the Pitch. He came back smiling and continued eating.
As the students all settled down, the door opened again, with Deputy Headmistress Professor Minerva McGonagall leading the first year students into the Great Hall. The whole group of eleven-year-olds all looked around the place in wonder as they followed her into this enchanting hall. They were followed by Hagrid, who being a half giant, seemed so tall that quite a few of the first years barely came up to his knees. Harry wondered if he was ever that short. Thinking back to when he was eleven and first saw Hagrid, he must have been that short as well. He exchanged a smile with Hagrid as he passed Harry's table. When Hagrid seated at the teacher's table, Professor McGonagall brought out the sorting hat and it started reciting a poem about the founders of the school and the different houses.
Harry did not want to torture Draco anymore. He lightly brushed Draco's erection with the tip of his finger, making Draco moan, as his eyes closed with the onslaught of the pleasure brought on by that sensation. Harry caressed the whole of Draco's erection, pleasing Draco with the light yet erotic touch, as Draco's hands clenched at the bedsheets. He could see his love getting nearer and nearer to the edge with his actions. When Draco was finally perched at the very edge of his peak, Harry quickly brought his finger down to the small patch of skin under Draco's balls and poked it suddenly with his finger, while he bent down and sucked Draco's cock into his mouth. The sensation of being touched at that sensitive place as well as his cock suddenly being surrounded by moist warmth sent Draco screaming as he reached his peak and came in Harry's mouth.
Ron looked at Draco and lifted his eyebrow. Draco shrugged his shoulders. Ron turned back to the two boys and nodded. "Okay, when?"
"My father says that no matter what, we are not supposed to talk to that idiot Malfoy again. And that we can do whatever we want to that git. So tonight, Vincent, you and Gregory can beat him up to your heart's content. He won't dare to say a word to Professor Snape tomorrow." Both Dean and Harry stared at each other with stunned expressions. Harry suddenly got up and leant against the wall behind Dean and both of them heard Vincent and Gregory grunt their agreement. The voice belonged to Pansy Parkinson and she was talking to Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, the "bodyguards" who had for the last six years followed Malfoy around.
"Do I hear the great Draco Malfoy being concerned for a mere dog?" Ron teased Draco. Then a growl came from the dog behind Draco, who was baring his teeth and glaring at Ron for the comment of him being a 'mere' dog.
Hermione exclaimed, pointing at them. "That was… he didn't even touch his wand… he… shouldn't even know the spell… we don't learn magical protective shielding in classes here. Much less in the bubble form. And that amount of magic. They were levitating everything." Her eyes were so huge that they looked like they were going to pop out.
"Guess what happened last night. You know Dean and Seamus? Seamus was in love with Dean for ages, but Dean finally noticed recently. Yesterday Seamus was talking about fooling around again, and the next moment, Dean's face went pale and everyone in the room was frowning at Dean. He then called Seamus over and put a silencing spell around their bed. This morning when I woke up, Dean wasn't in his bed. Guess that couple is finally getting settled." Harry looked up at Sirius and saw the dog looking like he was grinning. Harry debated telling Sirius about Draco and him. He then decided that his godfather already missed so many events in his life, he would be the first to know about Draco. "Oh, and Sirius. I lost my first kiss last night." He grinned when he saw the ears of the black dog suddenly perked up and its eyes grew big. The next moment, Sirius was back in his human form, settling down comfortably, grinning.
As he walked towards the group, he noticed that Hermione was with them, as expected, as she had the habit of spending the last two weeks of summer holidays with the Weasleys. Hermione was wearing a blue tank top with blue jeans this morning, making her look quite feminine, with her hair tied up. No one had noticed Harry yet, and Harry wondered if they would be surprised with his new changes. He stopped behind Hermione and bended down to her, whispering, "Hi Herm." Hermione spun around, expecting to see Harry's eyes slightly above her eye level but stopped in shock, before dragging her eyes slowly up to Harry's grinning face.
"It's no use. If six years of nagging from us had no effect on her, what makes you think she will stop now?" Ron answered, while busy piling food on his plate.
Draco nearly couldn't stop himself from crashing into Day when she started towards him. Day caught hold of both his hands and pulled him into the Great Hall. She could see Harry frowning.
A voice inside his head asked.
She suddenly saw a flash of black and saw a large furry dog barking his greeting, while placing his front paws on the bed beside her shoulder. She reached out the hand that was not held by Harry, and scratched behind the furry ears. "Hey, Snuffles. Were you waiting outside for me too?" Snuffles barked once.
"I think we should allocate a few days in which we spend our time in the common room. Otherwise we're going to be sick of each other soon. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday?" Hermione stated.
"Hmm… no idea, but if he really marry Pansy after they graduate, that bitch is going to be so rich as Malfoy got all the stuff from his relatives!" Seamus pouted.
Even Ron seemed astonished over the fact that his best friend had changed so much over the course of a few months. However his twin brothers did not seem so. The two of them punched Harry on the arm playfully, with Fred exclaiming, "Harry! I knew that you cleaned up good. Finally grew to the height that you should be. Thought that you are forever going to be at Ginny's height and when she even seemed to be getting taller than you, we were all getting a little worried! Looks like our dear Harry have no problems now."
"We got to warn Malfoy." Harry said softly, afraid that if they can hear Pansy, then Pansy may be able to hear them now.
Draco returned his smile. "You know, you never did answer me."
"Harry, you are stoning. You haven't even got into Snape's class yet. So tell me, isn't Draco Malfoy hot? Do you think he will prefer me, or you?" Day pulled him out of his thoughts. Since Day found out that he was gay, the two of them had been checking out guys together.
Suddenly the door opened and a blond man and a black haired man walked in hand-in-hand. They paused at the door, staring at the two boys as the two boys stared back at them. Then the blond man spoke.
Draco looked at his raven-haired boyfriend in front of him and used the sleeve of his robe to wipe the tears off Harry's cheeks. What he said did tally with the feelings that he experienced… except for one emotion. "Harry, I need to tell you something." Harry looked up at Draco, frowning. "Just now, when you were crying, I… I felt your emotions. And what you told me tallied with the emotions I felt, except… for this." Draco tried to imitate the love that he felt coming from Harry previously. Harry gasped. "Did I get it right?" Draco looked at Harry, hopefully.
He turned to Harry. "You knew, didn't you? You told her to…"
"And seeing that you two were seekers on your teams, the past years had trained you with good reflexes. The wall was constructed without muttering the spell mentally but by imagining. Maybe the next session will be on which spells you can do just by imagining it." Dumbledore smiled. "Now, show our dear Professor Lupin what you two have accomplished in your Advanced Transfiguration lessons. Sirius, did you tell Remus their forms?" Sirius shook his head, shooting a grin in the directions of the two black panthers in front of them, while staring at Remus' astonished face.
"Wake up, Boy, and cook breakfast for us! Dudley is hungry! Bring your TRASH down so that we can get rid of you sooner!" Harry Potter was awakened by his uncle's shouting and banging on his door and Dudley's heavy footsteps down to the kitchen. He hurriedly got up from his bed, tidied it up real quick (he knew he would have to rush in the morning and ended up packing all his things last night and sleeping on top of his covers to prevent messing up the bed) and unlatched Hegwig's cage. Hegwig hopped out of her cage and lifted one of her talons, looking at Harry, questioning.
Then, silence. Everyone turned to stare at Ron, who was looking at his clutched hands and seemed to be about to blow his top. Ron sent a glare at Draco and asked coldly, "You refused to be a death eater?"
"Deal, Harry."  Draco said, just as loud, as the both of them shook on it. Harry did not let go of his hand and used it to pull Draco to sit down next to him. Then all a sudden the Great Hall was filled with whispers of all the students regarding what had just happened and magically the food appeared in front of everyone. Then did Harry let go of Draco's hand. Harry then glanced at Professor Dumbledore, who gave him a slight nod and he nodded back at the Professor. Then he realized that the people sitting near him were all staring at Draco and not eating.
"Any more I would have lost control." Harry answered the unspoken question and pushed Draco to lay flat on his back, as Harry lifted Draco's legs for easy assess. Covering Draco's crevice lightly with his hand, he mentally used a lubricating spell and Draco gasped as he felt himself being lubricated, leaving him with a cold feeling. Harry then used the spell on his index finger and brought it down against the puckered ring. Bringing his lips to Draco's and kissing him, he slowly pushed his finger against the hole and felt Draco relax himself to allow his finger to slip into the tight knot of muscle. Draco breathed out as he felt Harry's finger enter him and Harry slowly slid his finger in and out, letting Draco get use to the thickness of his finger. Under Harry's mouth, Draco was whimpering at the sensation Harry gave him with his finger. Suddenly, without giving Draco much notice, Harry started to insert a second finger together with his index finger. Then a third finger was inserted. When Harry finally inserted four fingers into Draco, Draco was writhing under Harry, as his moans and groans were muffled by Harry's lips and his fingers lightly brush against a certain point inside of Draco.
"Every Weasley is good at something. Ron is good in chess." Day answered, joining in the scratching of the dog, who was whimpering with pleasure by then.
"Finally. I thought they are never going to take the hint that they like each other." Neville said sitting down, pulling Ginny down onto his lap. Harry, Ron and Hermione turned to Neville in shock. Neville continued on. "Maybe we should add on the bet that Seamus ends up with Dean. Since everyone betted that he will end up with Harry, because they are both gay. No one took into the account that Dean may be bisexual." Ginny nodded. "Harry, can I choose the password for the first two weeks? I need to get use to the system." Harry nodded, still speechless with shock. "Come on, Ginny, let's go add on the bet. Something tells me that we'll win very soon. We'll tell you guys the password later." He got up with Ginny and went out of the panel together.
