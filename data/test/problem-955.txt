"It's barbaric how she has to cry like that, when a simple episkey or a potion, but of course you would think I meant...never mind."
"You're talking to someone who had Bellatrix as an aunt. And then of course there's my father...but the less said about him the better."
It was over, he thought, a fitting finale to his worthless life. It had all been a fucking waste of time after all. He supposed that at the end at least he was with someone who knew his name and was trying to help him. He thought it was probably more than he deserved.
Draco waited until Potter left the bedroom before he attempted to stand. If he was going to fall flat on his face, he'd rather do it in private and not under the gaze of those ridiculously green eyes.
"I've never seen that curse before. It hasn't even marked your jacket. Are you sure you feel alright?"
"Not really, well yes, I suppose. We've known each other since we were eleven. We went to school together."
Harry nodded, accepting that it was a valid point, but hoping it didn't imply that Malfoy was similarly engaged in illegal activities.
Harry frowned, struggling to regain a sense of professional detachment. It had always been difficult to remain detached where Malfoy was concerned and this was not the meeting he had envisaged.
He moved swiftly, had reached the top of a short flight of stone steps when he heard the scuff of a shoe against pavement behind him, much closer than expected. There was no time to react before the curse hit him between the shoulder blades, its impact so great that he was thrown forwards and down. His natural agility, honed by years of Seeker training, enabled him to tuck into a defensive position as he fell. If it hadn't been for the pillar at the bottom of the steps there was a fair chance that he would have rolled, recovered himself and attempted an escape. As it was, although he threw himself as much to the side in mid-flight as possible, the tip of his left shoulder slammed into the upright structure, and in turn that physical impact altered his trajectory enough that his temple met with the stone with an audible crack. Without making a sound, he sprawled onto the cold slabs behind the pillar, limbs splayed in a boneless manner and only the glimmer of his pale hair visible in the shadows.
"I'll let you know how I get on. I've a meeting later this morning and I'll have a chat with Shacklebolt."
Harry nodded and just like that, they were gone, draped neatly over a chair even as his skin shuddered with the shock of the cool air. Then Malfoy was naked too, his body lean and sculpted and warm against him and Harry was instantly hard, wanting the other man with every fibre of his being.
“Royal Oak Road,” Harry read off the glowing sign above them. He started laughing. He was light and happy and still a bit tipsy, and slowly realizing that he was going to get to sit with Draco at yet another bus stop and maybe walk him home afterwards.
In the same way that he’d never been able to follow his own train of thought back from conclusion to origin, Harry would never be able to explain how he ended up at a bus stop near Leicester Square with Draco Malfoy. The things that stuck out to him like pins in a corkboard were the softness of Malfoy’s hair under streetlights, the cold brush of wind-born rain against his cheeks, and the way Malfoy murmured happily, “Hackney for you too? I’m near Dalston Junction. We can catch the thirty-eight.”
Ron regards him like he’s lost his mind. He seems to think Harry is confused about Malfoy’s business in the DMLE, when he’s usually with Hermione down in Mysteries. While that is out of the ordinary, it’s not nearly as pressing of an issue as
It occurs to him then that he probably can, so with equal hesitancy and excitement, Harry reaches across the desk between them to cup Malfoy’s chin. He swipes his thumb across the corner of that smiling mouth and drags it across his cheek. Harry watches the red bloom against Malfoy’s pale skin, and it ignites such a dizzying level of delight in him that he worries Malfoy may never look put-together in his presence again.
“No! Never! I fell for you just as hard as you claim you did for me!” Harry hissed. “It was never a game. I’m— terrible at this, to say the least. I couldn’t tell if you returned my feelings. Some days I was sure I drove you spare. I was scared to say anything and ruin what we had. I was terrified of what you’d say when you found out my status.
Savage whistled lowly and Draco’s cheeks turned a darker shade of red. Harry made a note to taste the eggnog and see just how much Ron had spiked it—he’d never seen Draco blush quite like that.
“Hey! I like this shirt!” Harry frowned. Truthfully, he wasn’t too keen to part with his warm jacket, but the possibility of seeing Draco warm his hands in the sleeves was too good to pass up.
“Aren’t you even going to ask about the coffee?” he said somewhat desperately when they started down the corridor to get Ron.
He was passing a lesser-known corner of the Alley when something soft gave way under his foot. Looking down, Harry saw the red of flower petals peeking out from under his boot. A rose had fallen out of the displays set outside a small shop—a florist’s. Harry had never noticed the store before. It was so narrow, sandwiched between two brighter buildings, that the flowers at the front seemed to spill out of it, arranged as they were around the door.
They swiped their oysters just as the doors slid shut and spent a frantic couple minutes skidding around, trying to make it look like they weren’t nearly as drunk as they were, while climbing to the second level, which was hard enough to do on London buses fully sober.
Harry sputters. He points a threatening finger at Malfoy’s patrician nose and shakes it a bit, but he’s really not sure what to say. All he knows is he’s done with the emotional whiplash of these nonsensical replies.
chair is facing away from Malfoy and that rosy fringe. The fact that Harry has never passed up a chance to watch Draco in all their years of training and employment (with or without pink hair) is irrelevant. The pink is distracting, and it’s more so on Malfoy.
“So what else have you been doing other than baking?” Harry says when he comes back. “My mum’s hung this horrid cross-stitch in my bathroom because she thinks that’s an appropriate quarantine hobby and I just want to make sure you’re safe from the horror of bunnies with top hats.”
.” A broken sound fought its way out of his throat. He hated it. “I don’t understand, was there something
Harry finds Disney+ on his TV while he waits and opens the login window. He still can’t believe Draco has an account. He looks like he either works in Canary Wharf or for Runway magazine, even though he can hardly be older than Harry.
is brilliant. They part and come back again, and Harry sips at Draco’s mouth like there’s nothing he’d rather taste, and Draco can’t stop shivering.
Malfoy swallows. His neck is a long expanse of smooth skin, and Harry vaguely wonders what it tastes like. “We might make use of them on the case. Staples, I mean. Have you any more?”
“He likes that Muggle shop across the street,” Harry continued. “That one with a frappa-whatsits. The caramel ones.” Harry knew this because he’d watched Draco lick the whipped cream off a frappa-whatsit once a week for the past year.
Harry was too busy looking at the angel in front of him to care. His skin was so pale it almost glowed under the golden coffee-shop lighting, a rosy blush rising prettily to its surface. His hair fell in white-blonde swaths over his forehead, the strands drifting teasingly into his wide eyes and making Harry want to reach out and brush them back. Harry coughed once, then twisted his fingers together beneath the counter to quell the disturbing urge.
"Thank you, Mr Potter, but that won't be necessary. You can hardly stand yourself. What you need is a hot drink and a lie down."
Potter leaned down and kissed him, soft and gentle, summoned Draco's jumper to cover him and held him closer. Draco kissed him back with a sense of impending doom. The feelings he had for Potter were so far beyond friendship. He was so very fucked.
"Hmm." Snape swept around his chair and settled himself in it, one leg crossed over the other and his eyebrows raised in enquiry. "Sit down, Draco, before you fall over."
"C'mon," urged Harry, tugging on the arm in his grasp until they were back in the well-lit corridor. Malfoy stumbled along with him, half-falling into Harry's side before righting himself with a curse.
Harry frowned at him.  "We wouldn't even know about Romani if Malfoy hadn't made the potions connection. He'd hardly incrimate himself!"
It was no secret that Mattock had run with Fenrir's pack or that he'd been a regular visitor and on-site torturer at the Manor, facts with which Robards was well-acquainted. The Head Auror ignored Harry, keeping his sharp gaze on Malfoy.
Malfoy pushed aside the tangled covers and sat up in a series of careful yet graceful movements. He flexed his toes against the rug on the floorboards and ran a hand through his hair.
The owner of the voice dragged him upright, fingers digging into his biceps. Draco froze, breath stuttering in his throat, the room suddenly too warm yet the air icy cold on his skin. The owner of the hand gave him a little shake, then pushed him forwards until he collided with the edge of the table.
It may have been his imagination, but it seemed the long fingers warmed slightly in his grasp. He maintained the flow and found himself staring absently at their joined hands, Malfoy's pale skin contrasting with his own slightly darker tone, both hands bearing similar broomstick calluses.
"Of course not, but when did the Ministry ever see sense? I did try, but they were adamant. You both report for duty in the morning."
Potter sighed and levitated the boxes from one desk onto the floor, then flopped down on the chair behind it.
Robards stared at Malfoy for a while, the room frozen in an uncomfortable silence, then spun on his heel to face Harry.
He pushed his way through the kitchen door to find Potter slamming a kettle onto the grate. There were no house elves he realised, watching bemused as the most powerful wizard in England, possibly in the world, made two mugs of tea the muggle way and slid one across the table top in his direction.
Draco pressed his forearm against his mouth, stifling the cry he needed to make. He shifted his stance, open, wanting, needing.
"It's the right thing to do and the Minister saw the sense in it. Of course, it's a sound move politically if the potion supply is stopped, despite the involvement of a Death Eater. I'm sure he'll get it signed off by tomorrow."
Harry waited, slouching casually against a damp wall and wishing he'd brought some extendible ears along. George would be ashamed of him.
Harry watched him, hovering anxiously but keeping his distance, until the other man was settled back on the bed.
Harry shrugged. Everything had been a mess, was still a mess, would quite possibly always be a mess.
Bearing in mind that he was a former Death Eater trapped in a deal with the Ministry, his name was in a ledger tying him into illegal potion supplies, he was shagging the auror who had custody of him and that auror was none other than the saviour of the wizarding world, Draco should have been having a conniption beneath his icy Malfoy mask.
Beside him the faces of Weasley and Potter showed nostalgia, sorrow and pride, but Draco knew his own showed only guilt. He stared at Potter with a feeling of helpless anguish; there was nothing Draco could do to put right what he'd done in the past, but he had to help Potter finish this case and justify Potter's trust in him. He couldn't believe he'd entertained the idea that there might be a future of some sort for the two of them. Potter was worth a hundred of him and the man would soon realise his error.
"My colleague suggested that the most likely cure is for Mr Malfoy to start using his magic as soon as he feels able to do so." She narrowed her eyes at Malfoy. "Just make sure that you do feel well enough. Rest is essential at this stage of healing. Well then, if neither of you have any questions? No? I'll be off then."
"Look, its like, I dunno, two o'clock in the morning or something. I'm going to make some coffee. Do you want a mug?"
He swallowed hard, pulled himself together with an effort and stalked off in the direction of Winch's Potent Potions.
Malfoy gestured at himself, leaning closer until Harry felt the whisper of his breath on his face. "The question is, will you take a chance or not?"
"Oh Merlin," muttered Harry reverently and sucked it deep in one desperate movement, hands tight on the backs of Malfoy's thighs as he swallowed.
"She's a healer first and foremost, Malfoy. Anyway, she's coming by later. I'll owl her that you're awake."
He started to get up, the customary graceful movement arrested abruptly as he straightened. Despite the way his lips pressed into a straight line, he couldn't stop the small noise that broke free. He stumbled forwards and Harry moved without thinking, catching him under the arms so that Malfoy fell against his chest, his head heavy on Harry's cheek and the hiss of his breath warm against Harry's neck as he swore.
There was a group of people waiting for them outside a second warehouse. Draco observed the muggle policeman with surprise, then noted the presence of Granger with a sheaf of papers she appeared to be serving on an irate-looking man in a cheap suit.
Potter looked taken aback, but the heart-to-heart moment had been lost and he reluctantly moved on to discuss the case, all the while a little pinch of distress between his eyes.
No, of course Draco didn't mind, even if the thought of a flushed and gently perspiring Potter did funny things to his gut. He strode behind him to the auror gym, glad to see that the majority of workers had left the building for the day. Even so, the occasional venemous look or comment meant he was wound as tight as a spring by the time they arrived. Potter glanced at him out of the corner of his eye and seemed to read his mood.
Regent's Park was a tranquil oasis, with a gentle trickle of people strolling or jogging along the wide path; it felt a million miles away from the bustle of the city streets and the crowds pouring in and out of London Zoo. It was an unlikely place for a stake-out, but if Harry's informant was correct then there just might be a glimpse of elusive potion smugglers making a trade. It was a long shot at best and the itch building at Harry's hairline told him his disguise was close to disintegration. It seemed he would have to return on another day.
The sparks gathered, became a warm coil in Draco's gut that made him lean in a little closer, the rapid thrum of Potter's pulse against the side of his face testimony that he was similarly affected. Then the kitchen door opened and Potter stepped quickly away as Hermione emerged.
Privately thinking that Ron must like living dangerously if he'd told Hermione she was seeing things, Harry fumbled for an answer.
The sharp tingle of a scourgify brought Draco back to the present with a rush. Potter was already on his feet, straightening his clothing and patting at his hair in a vain attempt to calm its waywardness. Embarrassed by his momentary lapse in concentration, Draco rose to his feet quickly and tucked himself away. It wasn't a moment too soon; there was a perfunctory knock and Potter quickly grabbed a file as the door opened.
Harry felt his cheeks heating. He dragged out the visitor's chair and dropped into it with a defensive frown, unable to think of anything that came even close to an excuse for that particular decision.
"Let's keep it that way. I'll tell Malfoy not to identify anyone he only recognises from seeing them in the pub."
They'd found something, he thought bitterly. Something that wasn't in his favour. What were the odds of that when this business had nothing to do with him? It was just his luck really.
Draco's balls clenched, his back arching as sensation built and built until it exploded and he came, shuddering and crying out with Potter following immediately, shooting hot and deep into him. Then Potter's hand was on his cock, the pad of his thumb sliding over the super-sensitised tip.
Harry turned, on his lips were anxious questions he had no idea how to present, but they were never uttered, forestalled by the broken air of the man before him.
"I don't think I can go through losing someone else," said Harry, his voice coming out gruff and shaky. He sincerely hoped he wasn't going to cry again.
Malfoy nodded, two gentle pushes of his forehead against Harry's collarbone, then unfurled his fingers from Harry's t-shirt and rolled onto his back. He looked completely wiped out and listless and Harry stared at him in a considering way before summoning his glasses and their street clothes. Glasses on and clothing reduced to the size of a small sandwich, Harry got to his feet, stuffing the packet into his joggers' pocket. He leaned down and held out a hand.
Harry moved one arm from where it was wrapped around the other man's waist and gently stroked the head tucked into his shoulder, pushing away soft strands of hair until he could see the side of Malfoy's face.
Draco took the remaining stairs at a run, dashed into his room and locked the door both magically and physically. He faced the wall, his hands flat against the lumpy wallpaper. How could he have been so stupid? He dropped his forehead against the surface, pressing hard as he ground his teeth.
Malfoy's gasps became sharper; his hand reached down, casting some spell that sent a tingling, cleansing rush through them both and coated his crack in slippery fluid. The sensation was almost too much and Harry cried out, gripping the base of his cock with his eyes closed as he fought for control.
He loaded some bacon onto a plate and brought it over to the table, summoning a loaf of bread as he passed.
Potter stretched his arms over his head and yawned, his hoodie rising up to expose a stretch of tanned skin. Draco averted his gaze quickly and agreed.
"You know," he said slowly, "you're the only person who doesn't treat me like I'm going to break or like I'm some big celebrity."
They thrashed around on the rubber-scented exercise mats, neither really getting the upper hand until Draco's elbow sank into Potter's solar plexus, more by chance than judgement, and Potter dropped onto his back, winded and whooping for air. Draco collapsed on top of him, completely shattered, thinking that if it was anyone but Potter he would have thrown in the towel some time previously.
It was stifling in the small space behind the end bookshelf and Draco shifted by a minuscule amount, longing for a drink of water. The temptation to creep out of his hiding place was growing stronger by the minute and he was flexing his thigh muscles, preparatory to moving, when he heard a scuffling sound in the corridor outside Malfoy Manor library. He froze immediately, heart beginning to race as fear tightened its grip around his chest.
Whatever response Harry had at the comment Draco made died the instant the other boy's mouth fell on his own. Their movements were smooth, unhurried as the blond nipped the Gryffindors bottom lip, teasing for entry that was immediately granted. Harry lost himself in the sensations, all but dragging Draco closer to him, pinning the boy into his warm sheets as he let his tongue ponder past plush lips and into a hot mouth. Moaning, it was only when his hand landed on his discarded wand that Harry remembered what they were doing in his room in the first place. Jerking back he ignored Draco's confused huff, the blond's hands immediately linking around his neck in an attempt to bring him back down again. And boy was that tempting. Flush high in his cheeks and lips ruby red, Draco's debauched expression was making it increasingly hard for Harry to turn away when all he wanted was to go back to thoroughly ruining him.
"I'm still getting my head around being captain," he explained, as though Draco had asked him to. Furrowing his brow, the blond went to speak when Harry flushed, green eyes lowering to neck. "Also sorry about that."
"I love you," Harry muttered sweetly, brushing back Draco's hair as he kissed the top of his forehead. "I love you, so much."
He waited until Harry's hands fully laxed before reclining his head back. Wiping the back of his hand along his mouth, Draco stood, incredibly pleased by the flushed sight before him. He felt a raw surge of pride cast over him. Pride at the power he had over Potter. He did that. Brought the high flush to Harry's cheeks, caused him to chew his lip raw in pleasure to the point the edge was bleeding, put that adoring glimmer in his slanted green eyes.
"Kiss me." Draco said, intending the words to come out as a demand but they collapsed on themselves halfway out his mouth. They sounded yearning, a little too vulnerable for his taste, but he didn't dwell on it when Harry burrowed himself between his spread legs, hands cramming themselves into his hair with haste as his mouth reclaimed its rightful position against his own.
"Don't I dare what, Potter?" Draco said, a pleased smirk on his face that broke into a high pitched whine as he slid his thumb across the slit of his cock. White teeth dug into a plush bottom lip and Harry fidgeted, wanting nothing more than to slap Draco's hand aside, replace it with his own, be the reason his boyfriend was all but writhing in his sheets. Instead, he casted a reluctantly look at his Transfiguration book, ready to admit defeat and flip the thing closed, when a spell caught his eye.
"Afterglow is officially over, Potter. Time for you to go," He announced, curbing Harry's attempt to kiss him again. Guiding Harry's fondling hands back to his sides, Draco stood, grimacing at the come that slowly trickled down the back of his leg. Pulling open the bedside drawer he took out the box of tissues which lived there, gently wiping himself clean. He bit back a moan when his fingers brushed over his hole, knowing if he lingered on the spot he'd just end up agreeing to let Potter stay the night. Dumping the tissues in the small trash can beside his desk, he frowned when he didn't hear the sound of Harry's clothes rustling. Spinning on his heel, the blond scowled at the sight which greeted him. Potter, curled up under his sheets, fast asleep. Grumbling to himself, the blond slipped into the bed and steadfastly ignored the smile which tugged at his lips when Harry rolled over and pulled him into his chest.
Second being that stupid scar that glared at him every time their eyes met. Reminding him that Harry truly was destined for greatness, for goodness, that Draco had no place in no matter how many times Harry told him that his fate was in his own hands. That at the end of the day there was good in him, regardless of what his father said or what his House stood for.
Neither of them pulled any punches. Harry's tongue was questing, begging to get as deep into Draco's mouth as he could, to taste as much of the boy he loved as he could achieve. Draco moaned at the assault, going pliant under the attack and raking his nails across the rippling muscle of Harry's back. The skin was a more golden color than he'd ever seen it before, Potter having spent more time than not during the summer running around shirtless on the Quidditch field with Weasley and Thomas. He enjoyed the fruits of the suns labor, pushing his fingers deeper into the dip of Harry's lower back, nipping at his bottom lip as his hands plunged down the back of his underwear, revelling in the hot and bouncing flesh that greeted him. When Harry broke away, he pressed his forehead against Draco's, panting breaths laboured as he ground against the other boy, pleasant whimpers escaping bruised lips.
"Yesterday," He stuttered while Draco made a show of correcting his uniform, face impassive. "You knew already? I was going to tell you. How did you find out?"
"I can do whatever I please, Potter," Draco said hotly, raising his chin in defiance while Harry just shook his head fondly.
"I know that look," Harry panted out, gaining some sensibility to pull his trousers back up from the floor and re-looped through his belt. "You better not be practicing occlumency right now."
"Fine, but if you want me to stop speaking then you best keep my mouth preoccupied in other ways, Potter." the blond smirked, pressing back against Harry's tight fist. He gasped when the brunet suddenly let go, face planting into hot sheets as Harry slipped off the bed and left Draco's body cold in his absence. Moments later soft hands gripped his shoulders, yanking him to his knees. Draco blinked up when Harry pointed at the ground at the end of his bed, tilting his head in mock confusion. If Potter didn't state what he wanted, Draco wasn't going to help him out.
"Surely this can wait until tomorrow," He tried again, casting bored grey eyes over to the other boy. Harry all but glared back at Malfoy, wand suspended in the air as he cut off whatever spell he was ready to attempt.
"So good," Draco smiled, voice slurred as he let out a breathless moan of Harry's name and the Gryffindor was gone. Lips parted, he hunched over Draco, spilling inside him with a final thrust that took the air out of his lungs. Collapsing into the crook of the blond's flushed neck, Harry bit down on the reddened and bruised skin, savouring the salty taste of sweat and Draco, slowly coming down from his high.
"Liar." the brunet said, shaking his head as he draped his body properly along the bound blond's form. The skin was hot, dangerously so, and Harry couldn't help but drag his tongue along the gentle sloop of Draco's neck before speaking again. "I should just throw you out into the hallway at this point, maybe then you'll learn your lesson."
A fluttering sound filled the air as Draco strode across the room, robe billowing around him as he dumped himself at the foot of Harry's bed. Head rested against the poster the blond frowned, fingers reaching out to flick at the edge of one of the many books covering the brunet's red and gold sheets.
"Relieving myself of some tension since you appear to be indisposed at the moment," The blond replied, testily pushing against Potter's hold. When the brunet strengthened his grip, Draco went lack, looking for too pleased with himself when he lowered his gaze back to the sheets. "I truly was trying not to distract you."
Green eyes slid closed as Harry Potter rubbed at the bridge of his nose in annoyance, glasses lifting at the action. With deep breaths, he reminded himself for the third time that night that throwing Draco Malfoy out the window was not an option. It had taken over a year of nagging to get the boy to admit he liked Harry back, he couldn't just throw all that hard work away over one unpleasant evening.
"I will not hesitate to shove a broom handle in your mouth if you won't quiet down, Potter." Draco remarked, expression bored as he ran a hand teasingly up and down Harry's painfully hard dick. His eyes gave him away though, like they always did any time the pair snuck away for a few moments of passion. A subtle amusement lied in them, as well as a fondness that he couldn't bite back in the presence of the Boy Who Lived. There were days when Draco thought about dropping the act, admitting to Harry that he wanted something more out of whatever this thing between them was. That he wanted to hold hands down the hallway, listening to that ear sore of a girl Harry called a friend argued with Weasley about the important of homework, or whatever it was she talked about. To for once not shove Harry away when he went in for a final kiss before sneaking out of the closet, bathroom stall, section of forest they had hidden away to.
Draco moaned as the tip of Harry's cock brushed against his parted lips, slipping down the slick flat of his tongue and towards the back of his throat. Relaxing his muscles, Draco took him in as far as he could, heady eyes raising to stare into bright green orbs behind fogging glasses. Leaning in further, Draco worked his way down Harry's cock until it choked him slightly. He made to pull back when the brunet's grip tightened, holding him in place and Draco moaned, fingers clenching into fists at his sides, aching to run over any part of his lover at this point. When Harry finally pulled back, gave Draco a moment to gasp and regain his breath, the blond croaked a single plea.
"Thrilled," Harry said, attention already directed back to the open book in front of him. "I might save practicing that one for another night. Ron had a mix up in class yesterday, gave himself a rather unflattering moustache that I don't want to risk imposing on myself."
Draco blinked up at the brunet, lips parted as choked moans escaped through every few breaths. The feeling was intoxicating. Harry, hot and hard inside him, fucking into him as though nothing else mattered in the world but the two of them being connected, driven by desire and need for one another. The shine in his wide green eyes that let him know that whatever Potter was feeling, it was purely for Draco. Emboldened, Draco shoved at Harry's chest until he was forced to pull out of him. Groaning internally at the loss he urged Harry onto his back, the brunet confused but willing to go with the action. Planting himself on top of the other boy, Draco threw his legs either side of Harry's hips and reached behind himself to line the tip of Harry's cock back against his entrance.
Draco scowled further, grey eyes flickering with fury and something else. Tearing his own gaze away, Harry hunched further over his notes and aimed his wand ahead. He would get the spell done by the end of the night if it killed him. It wasn't hard, Harry reminded himself when his shaky whisper of Avis failed to produce any birds. In all honesty, the brunet was surprised his wand hadn't just burst into flames in order to save him the embarrassment of failing yet again. It was after a few more weak attempts that Harry's ears pricked to the sound of soft pants mumbled into the sheets beside him. Weary, the Gryffindor glance out of the corner of his eye only to have his jaw nearly drop clear off his face at the sight which greeted him. At some point during Harry's distracted spell casting, Draco has rolled over onto his front. The side of his face pressed into the red sheets, eyes shut in pleasure, the blond had been busy grinding his hips into the mattress in torturously slow rolls. Harry's wand clattered silently from his hand, immediately swallowed flying pages as the brunet frantically kicked his books aside and invaded his boyfriend's space. With strong hands, he gripped Draco's hips, pressing them hard into the mattress to still all future movement.
Draco stammered, for once thrown entirely off his guard that he couldn't resist when Harry laid a chaste kiss to his mouth. Blinking rapidly Draco fought to tamper down his growing blush.
"That's very rude of you to say, Potter," Draco said pouting to himself until Harry slung an arm around his neck, pressing a giddy laugh to the other boy's cheek. With a put-upon sigh, Draco changed his hair back. "Happy now?"
"What happened to keeping my mouth occupied?" Draco argued back, preening when Harry knocked his legs down, forcing the blond to hook his ankles behind Harry's back as he suddenly thrust inside him. The stretch burned in the best way, the Slytherins toes curling as Harry pressed hips against Draco's ass as tightly as possible, forcing Draco to take in every inch of him. Discarding his glasses to the floor, the brunet ran his tongue along the pale strip of Draco's neck, worrying the skin with his teeth until it grew near purple, kissing the spots gently once he was done. Working his way up by the time he reached his boyfriend's mouth, Draco was trembling, delicious pleas spilling from red lips, begging Harry to move, to fuck him already. His eyes all but rolled back when Harry finally pulled out, dragging torturously slow against Draco's inner walls, making sure every second was felt before he slammed back inside him roughly, skidding them a half-inch across the floor and Draco keened, loving every minute of it.
"Good morning, Ginny." He said, tone friendly enough but eyes feral. The girl ducked her head immediately, scampering past them with a barely uttered hello back. Harry watched the exchange in confusion until his face turned red in understanding.
"I won't be able to live with myself if I don't do this," She said, voice growing more nervous as Harry's brows pinched together. He glanced down the hall, as though something around him could give him an idea as to what was happening. "Luna told me to follow my heart for once, so I guess I've got to try it, just this once."
"Remind me that we're going to Hogsmeade tomorrow," Harry said, loosely entwining his fingers with Draco's. The boys skin was cold, enough so that Harry cheekily brought their hands to his mouth, blowing warm air on them. The action never failed to make Draco's lips twitch, cheeks blushing in a way that made Harry's heartbeat race.
On a whim, the brunet sat back on his haunches and raised a hand, slapping it across Draco's smooth right cheek. The reaction was immediate, Draco's back snapping in half as he arched, a low whine escaping his throat that had something in Harry break. His hand retracted from inside Draco, earning a quiet moan of protest, before he flipped the other boy over and onto his back. Legs like noodles, Draco didn't react when Harry shoved them apart and settled in. Gripping his cock Harry leaned over the blond, green eyes staring down intently into hazy pools of black and grey, and thrust inside him. Draco gasped at the sensation, trembling thighs moving to pull Harry in deeper as he bottomed out inside his lover. Choking at the warmth, the tightness, that engulfed him, Harry dropped his forehead onto Draco's shoulder. Mouthing at the skin he slowly started up a rhythm, pulling out a few inches before driving back inside Malfoy's tight heat.
"Harry!" The sixth year called out, pace not slowing even when the seventh year had come to a halt at hearing his name said so urgently.
"Need a little room to do so," he quipped back, gasping when Draco's hand latched itself in his hair and tugged. The back of his head hit the green walls and Harry didn't fight back the moan that broke through at the action, especially when Draco bit down on the side of his neck savagely before dragging his lips over the curve of his ear.
A deafening crack sprung through the air as Draco wrenched Harry's belt free, dropping it to the tiled floor, and sunk to his knees. With wide eyes the brunet stared down at the scowling grey eyed boy, unsure what was happening. Usually this would be the part where Draco shoved Harry to the ground, had his filthy way with him. Instead there was Draco, unflinching as he yanked Harry's trousers down and got to work.
The next morning after breakfast, Draco followed Harry back to the Gryffindor commons. The brunet was intent on asking his friends if they wanted to join them in heading to Hogsmeade. As they approached the entryway, Draco's eyes landed on a familiar head of long ginger hair at the other end of the hall. Tangling a hand in dark locks still ruffled from the night before, Draco enveloped Harry in a claiming kiss, roughly biting at his lips and basically sticking his tongue down the other mans throat. Dazed, the brunet blinked back up at him as Draco pulled back, running a thumb across Potter's wet bottom lip, humming to himself. Over Harry's shoulder the blond raised a hand and waved smugly at someone approaching them.
Flipping over, Harry shuffled into the middle of the bed. Holding himself up by the forearms he watched with rapt attention, captivated by the way Draco undid the buttons of his shirt. Unspeaking, Draco knelt onto the bed, and with each button that revealed soft white flesh he shuffled closer to his boyfriend until he found himself straddling his lap. Dropping down heavily, Draco sighed as Harry's hands roamed at his sides, creeping along his chest then into his hair as the brunet pulled him into a searching kiss. Shaking his shirt free from his wrists, Draco dug his nails into the meat of the other boys shoulders, kissing with a brutality that left both of them panting and eager to get closer.
"What makes you think I'm staying the night with you, Potter?" He scowled, though his eyes were teasing.
"Why would I need to do that?" He asked, tone choppy as they descended up the stairs into the Slytherin Dungeon. After barking out the password and shoving the door open briskly, Draco glared at any of the boys who attempted conversation with them and marched straight toward his room. In all the time the pair had spent together, Harry could count on one hand how many times Draco had let him enter the space. Which was why he more than willingly followed the blond inside, jumping when his boyfriend slammed him against the wall beside the now closed bedroom door.
"When are you going to let your grudge against Hermione go?" Harry all but groaned, running a hand down his face as Draco's grew more scowling. "You can't hold the duel against her forever."
A tied-up Draco Malfoy meant a Draco unable to seduce Harry with carnal thoughts and imagery. Eyeing the blond who had flung his shirt across the room, pants around his ankles as he unashamedly got himself off, Harry raised his wand and muttered a single word.
"Come for me," He said, brushing his lips against the blond's ear and relishing every laboured breath that reached his own.
"What?" He barked back, uncomfortable under Harry's warming gaze. Draco was just fast enough to avoid Harry's kiss, but not enough so to push away the hands that grazed over the scarf, laying the ends flat against his chest.
"As if you'd ever voluntarily let someone see me naked," Draco scoffed though the words were a little breathless as he craned his head back just enough to smirk at the green-eyed boy. "I'm sure you'd like to keep this image all to yourself."
"The entire purpose of you being here is to help me with my Transfiguration, Draco," Harry reminded, earning a hard eye roll from the Slytherin student.
"Is everything alright?" Harry asked timidly, suddenly aware of the very angry look breaking its way across Draco's pale face. His eyes shined silver, hard around the edges though his pupils were widening by the second as he shifted in closer to the nervous Gryffindor. A hand reached out, tracing along the curve of Harry's mouth, unfazed when the brunet's lips parted and his tongue lashed out, licking the tip of Draco's finger.
Christmas is an important time for the Merlin fandom, so I thought I’d use it as is. If you know, you know.
“So you’re saying, sir, ” He sits down and glances around again, almost trying to make sure that this isn’t some weird dream, “That you used to live here?”
Also I can’t figure out Grimmauld Place’s layout for the life of me, so forgive me for being handwavy.
He’s gotten quite good at avoiding spontaneous attacks in the halls these days. He usually has his hand on his wand every time he turns his back or turns a corner. And he does, when they approach him on his way to Transfiguration, but he loses his focus for a split second when he hears Potter’s voice coming from somewhere near.
He sits down at the dining table with a cup of tea, and starts digging through the references he brought, looking for spells that might make the sentient magic last longer. The comfortable silence in the room stretches for what seems like forever, before it’s broken by Merlin’s sudden mention of Potter.
“Of course.” She waves them away dismissively, before skipping down the hall towards the Transfiguration classroom. Potter turns to look at him.
“Yes, of course I — what?” He blinks, suddenly alert at the sight of Merlin’s mischievous smile. “How did you—?”
Draco considers that for a moment. He really doesn't see how the Weasleys would welcome him into their home on Christmas, despite him having gotten on relatively good terms with their youngest son in recent weeks.
Glancing down at the parcel in his lap, he could only guess that his mother sent them each some ridiculously expensive, French-made scarves or gloves. He unties the ribbon and lifts the lid off the box, and inside are two separate parcels, one red and one green, with the green one being quite a bit larger. He picks up the green parcel and opens it.
“Do you ever wonder,” They listen to the song in silence for a few moments before Potter whispers, all too quiet that it almost gets drowned out by the drumline, “if things could’ve been different, if I had shaken your hand on that first day?”
Draco’s already walking toward the door when his foggy brain recalls that Potter might still be outside. He doesn’t get the opportunity to ponder over his options, because as soon as he opens the door, he finds Potter sitting on the floor with his back against the wall. The other boy startles at the sound of the door and jumps to his feet, but soon drops his defense at the sight of him.
Before Harry could begin to panic about it, their destination corridor comes into view. They stop in front of the seemingly innocuous brick wall, and Draco closes his eyes in concentration. A moment later, a set of familiar double doors emerge from the wall.
It’s a perfectly pleasant outing. Too pleasant, in fact. It starts snowing quite heavily as they are on their way out, so Hogsmeade is less crowded than it normally would have been. Draco feels some relief at that. He’s certain that people are going to start talking eventually, but it’s nice to not be stared at too much everywhere they go, at least for now.
Potter seems a bit startled at that, but he smiles triumphantly, then starts tugging Draco toward Three Broomsticks.
“I think you’re just using me as an excuse to get drunk, Potter.” Watching as he twists open the screw cap, Draco shakes his head in amusement.
Well, the Slytherin had him there. Unconsciously, Harry grip tightened on Draco's hips as he imagined another person's eyes enjoying how beautiful he looked while restricted. He imagined invisible hands sliding along Draco's skin, making the boy moan and shudder and– No, Harry wouldn't have that.
He hadn't meant to snoop, honestly. It was just that Draco still felt a little anxious when wondering into the Gryffindor common room by himself. Usually Harry stood waiting for him in the hallway, easy grin and knowing eyes as he took the Slytherin boy's hand and dragged him over to his waiting friends. So that afternoon had found Draco pacing in front of the common room doors, waiting for the scarred boy to arrive. He hadn't expected the flash of red that stormed past him, eyes too firmly trained ahead to notice Draco's form. No, Ginny Weasley was on a mission and her target had just rounded the corner, eyes trained on his feet as he hummed to himself.
"What on earth is this, Potter?" He spat, shoulders wiggling as he attempted to break free. "Did you seriously just string me up like cattle?"
"Oh no, tell me that's not the time," Harry said suddenly, eyes focused on the clock hanging behind Draco's head. Letting out an aspirated groan, the brunet all but elbowed his way past Draco. "I'm late. I completely forgot I moved practice to today. I'm such an idiot."
"I love you." Harry gasped out, eyes screwing shut as his orgasm threatened to crest over him. Draco's eyes widened, hips stuttering at the admission before he righted himself, both hands dropping to Harry's red chest.
And let him not forget Harry choosing friendship with that dreadful girl and simple minded red-headed boy over him in the first year. Bruised egos never fade, which was what Draco told himself drove the reason he moaned when Harry whispered out his name in rapture as he came, nails piercing Draco's neck and making him shiver.
"Right. Head's a bit in the clouds today," He chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. "Any particular reason you called for me? I'm just about to meet the others in the common room if you'd like to tag along."
"I don't take well to tardiness, Potter," Draco murmured against his skin, taking time to run the tip of his tongue up to the other boys ear. "Especially when you were the one so desperate to see me."
Leaning forward, Harry trailed his lips gently along Draco's spine, mouthing at every bump that greeted him. His tongue flicked out against the warm skin, laving over areas at random until they glowed back to him bright reds and purples. Twisting his hands in his bedspread, Draco gnawed on his lips, wanting nothing more than to snap at Harry to pick up the pace, but at the same time desperate for his worshipping touch. When Harry finally reached the bottom of his spine, his hands gently kneaded Draco's cheeks, pulling them apart just enough to catch the winking hole between them.
Draco moaned, legs tight around Harry's waist as he drew him in closer, near screaming when his orgasm finally hit. Hot streaks of come coated his bound chest, leaking over Harry's hand, who worked him through it until Draco's groans became pained. Reclaiming his hold on the blond's hips, Harry mindlessly thrusted into Draco's still shuddering body, eyes focused on the blissed-out expression staring back at him as he chased after his own release.
At hearing his name, the blond realized he had gone still, awkwardly cradling Harry in hand like a wounded birds wing. Flustered, Draco dropped his gaze to the floor and berated himself for getting lost in such stupid thoughts. Potter was nothing more than fun, he reminded himself. Nothing more.
Whatever scolding Hermione had at the tip of her tongue bled away to excitement. Primly, she straightened her back, a gentle smile on her lips. "Oh, so Harry finally confessed? They're officially together?"
"We'll have to do this again," He muttered against the brunet's lips, breaking off into a chuckle when Harry all but hauled him on top of him.
"Be nice." She said, playfully batting Ron's shoulder in a way that did not go unnoticed by Harry. Fighting back a knowing smile, he perked up when Draco appeared in the door frame. Waving the other boy over he didn't notice the flicker of darkness that washed over his pale eyes for a moment, too busy making room on the couch for the other boy. Draco took his place, stock still beside Harry and stayed that way hours later when the brunet finally walked him to his chambers.
"Nothing," Harry whispered and forced Draco to maintain eye contact when he finally stepped away. "Just realised how good gold and green look together. Gold and red suits you, Draco."
"Harder." He grunted out when Harry had given up on teasing him, picking up a steady rhythm that had both of them breathing hard. Kissing was no longer an option, though their lips stayed pressed together more often than not, groans slipping through alongside each rapid intake of breath. A hand pawed at Draco's thigh, hiking his leg a little higher up as Harry grabbed his ass and moved his hips faster, squeezing the soft skin until the Slytherin whimpered at the dig of nails.
Potter's startled gaze narrowed and he flipped a towel from the rack in Draco's direction. Draco snagged it out of the air and wrapped it around his hips, wondering why he'd never noticed before how often Potter blushed and why it was so amusing.
Potter withdrew his hand immediately, looking unexpectedly upset and leaving Draco's shoulder inexplicably cold.
"No." He paused for a moment, then added, "Well yes, but it didn't seem fair, you know, with you getting muggle treatment."
"Look," he said, "I've been living in the muggle world. It's not as though I'm in an ex-Death Eater club or anything."
"You should eat more," observed Potter suddenly, a spoonful of tart halfway to his mouth as he frowned at Draco's barely touched plate.
The queue in front of them shuffled forwards a few steps and Harry moved after them slowly, suddenly very conscious that Malfoy's thigh was shaking against his own, that his elegant jaw was inches away from Harry's cheek and that his eyelashes were long and fine and pale gold.
"You are investigating Snakeskin Potions. You want to know everything I can remember about Crowfoot, Dangelos and Smithson, especially anything that will assist you in tracking down their current whereabouts. Am I missing anything?"
Harry gestured at the wand and only then did Malfoy seem to realise it was smoking. He let it fall with a curse.
"C'mon," Harry said quietly. "I've got a room ready. There's a bathroom on the same floor so it'll be easier for you."
He buried his face in the familiar fruit scent of her hair, which was pulled over one shoulder in a loose tie.
It was true enough, Draco's resentment had built up during the day to the point of explosion, piling on top of years of anger and hurt and fear until he felt the slightest thing would send him over the edge. If Potter wanted a good punch-up, he was happy to oblige. After all, there was no doubt that would be the result of any so-called sparring session; they were both far too competitive for any other outcome.
It's been a long time since my last update and since that update the world as we knew it has changed. If you are new to this story, thanks for joining us. If you are returning to it, thank you for your patience. To all of you - I hope you are well and safe and continue to be so. Take care 🤗
"Just hang on a bit longer, okay? They'll give you something to make you feel better, then if you want to go, we'll go."
He rushed out of the lift as soon as it stopped, bursting into the aurors' office to be met with a hushed silence that warned him Robards was not far away. Sure enough, seconds later, the man's voice boomed overhead.
He turned away from a mystified Weasley and dropped a wink at Potter, who flushed again in a way Draco would have found delightful if he wasn't so puzzled at his own feeling of detachment from the day.
"A ledger Ranworth found in premises we now know were leased out to Romani for an import business. Harry, it's just the break we've been waiting for!"
Malfoy gestured at it frantically, but each motion seemed to increase the speed further. The funnel howled, sucking greedily at furniture and snatching up smaller items as it advanced towards them.
Draco heard himself make a noise, shoved his own arm against his mouth to muffle the sound and braced himself as Potter's muscles flexed against his arse. Then Potter was fucking into him, long, hard strokes, fingers bruising against his hip and shoulder. Draco spread his legs further, his height lessening enough that he could feel Potter so deep inside him that he almost cried out each time Potter's cock rammed past his prostrate.
It was only as Ron walked away that Harry caught sight of Malfoy. He was still by the range, his face white and set and his eyes expressionless. It would have fooled Harry completely if he hadn't recognised it for the mask it was. His recent words came back to him, each one dropping as heavy as lead into the gap between them. He hadn't meant...
"Do you intend to take the lift, or is there some vital clue in here that I should be investigating?"
Malfoy was in the centre of the tap room, surrounded by prostrate and cowering customers and the debris of broken chairs and tables. He was shaking, his gaze fixed on an open door behind the only wizard remaining on his feet, although perhaps saying he was on his feet was an exaggeration, rather he clung to the remnants of the bar, his dirty robe glinting with shattered glass as a puddle of escaped beer grew around his feet.
Malfoy blinked at him slowly and pushed himself upright in easy stages. He looked exhausted, Harry thought, unsteady and pale and ill. The unfairness of it brought a deep burn of anger to his gut; a few potions and spells would heal the majority of Malfoy's injuries so easily in comparison to muggle medication. He decided that as soon as Malfoy was safely settled in bed, a flue call to Hermione would be a priority; with her position in the Wizengamot there was a slim possibility of a suspension of sentence, especially with Malfoy under his care.
"I don't," said Harry sharply. "You need help Draco. You're not going to be able to get there by yourself."
Potter responded by laughing and launching himself across the gap between them to bury his fist in Draco's stomach. Draco doubled over, taking a handful of black hair in his fist on the way past. It was on, although at first he felt sure the other man was pulling his punches.
"What? No. Here, lean on me." Without waiting for permission, Harry closed the gap between them. "Put your arm around my shoulders."
"Please..." Please fuck me, he thought privately; please make me forget everything but the feeling of you inside me, just please.
A tiny flutter of hope stirred in Draco's belly and he squashed it brutally; there were only so many disappointments a man could take.
Draco dried himself slowly, every swipe of the towel a symbolic polish to his fragile veneer of being "absolutely fine, thank you".
Draco gasped, the brush of his cock against the cold wall almost tipping him over the edge. Potter snorted a laugh behind him, pushed back in, fast, rough, grinding over Draco's prostrate with unerring accuracy.
"Really Potter, did you listen to Snape at all? Oil of Quintessence is the extract of poisonous plants. Its extremely difficult to prepare and a tiny drop can be fatal."
Malfoy's mouth was pure bliss, lavishing care as his tongue traced slow stripes, then dipped into the coarse hairs at his base, teased his testicles and the sensitive skin beneath. Harry arched into him, much too close to do more than groan and pat stupidly at the crown of Malfoy's head in warning.
"That's not unusual, not if someone has an intense connection." Hermione chipped in. "And you and Malfoy were always very aware of each other."
It wasn't Potter, of that much he was sure; he always knew when it was Potter. After all, the Gryffindor had spent years following him around, and the familiar vibration of his magic that announced his presence was individual and unmistakable. It was a vibration he hadn't felt for a long time and had thought he would never feel again, until two days before when he'd suddenly become aware of the familiar ripple trailing behind him.
"You'll be seeing Mr Malfoy home? Ah, good. And he will have company for at least the next 36 hours?"
The nature of that particular cell made it necessary to open the outer door and step inside to view a caged area. Some instinct kept Harry close behind Malfoy as he entered and his instincts were proved right immediately. There was the sound of movement and a deep growl resonated through the cell block. Malfoy froze, his breath catching audibly.
"So," he said, gripping his hands firmly together to still their shaking. "What precisely do you want me to do?"
Although Malfoy's demeanour during periods of delirium left Harry in no doubt that his hallucinations were deeply unpleasant, this was reinforced a thousand-fold by the transference of emotion that occurred every time their skin accidentally came into contact. He wasn't always sure from Malfoy's ramblings exactly what was going on in his head, but every emotion was transmitted with vicious intensity, to the point where Harry's own body reacted physically to the stimuli.
"It was every time we came into contact, but only if it was, you know, skin to skin. I got a blast of whatever he was feeling."
"No. It wasn't strong enough." Malfoy shivered, unconsciously pulling the sides of his jacket closer together. He kept his face angled down so Harry could see little but the fall of his hair and the soft curve of his mouth.
It took him a long time and everything he had in him to get back to the small but expensive flat near Regent's Park. Dawn was lightening the sky by the time he fumbled the key into the lock and shut the door behind him. He let himself pass out then, crumpling onto the waxed wooden floor. His last fleeting thought was that if he died no-one would care, but at least it would be in private.
Draco found his cheek against the wall, Potter still jerking inside him and his breath harsh pants on the back of Draco's neck as his hand milked the last come from Draco's cock. Then Potter pulled out, his semen a hot rush down Draco's thighs as Potter dropped back to his knees and turned Draco to face him. His eyes were almost closed, lashes dark as he kissed Draco's stomach, the swirling magic from his lips spreading to clean the stickiness, before turning him again to lap at his arse. Draco cried out as the warm tongue breached him, licking deep inside, the tip of Potter's tongue hitting its target with unerring precision as Potter's fingers curled around his cock, slid up and over the top in time with the flicks of his tongue. Helpless, shaking and crying out, Draco fell over the edge with a surge that filled Potter's hand and made Draco's vision fade. He slumped backwards, sprawling naked across Potter's lap and grasping at his thighs in an attempt to stay connected to reality.
The briefing was blessedly brief. Potter was clearly animated by the possible breakthrough and easily communicated his enthusiasm to a specially formed team comprising himself, Weasley, Ranworth - who looked more like a mild professor than an auror - and bluff and well-built Briggs . An anonymous unspeakable was also attached for the fresh stage of the investigation, but was not actually present.
Potter was cooking bacon, his hair in even more disarray than normal and a sheepish expression on his face as he turned. Draco took his time hanging his jacket on the back of a chair and then raised his head to find a look of shock on Potter's face, grease dripping slowly from the spatula hanging loose in his hand.
Malfoy had done nothing wrong, she insisted. He'd managed to throw a couple of effective shields, without either wand or word as far as she could recall, being a little busy herself at the time.
That was true enough and the conversation turned to safer subjects such as the re-decoration of some of the rooms in Grimmauld Place, which Malfoy seemed to find surprisingly pleasant, the bare bones of the potions case and general chat about the wizarding world to bring Malfoy up to date. By the time they'd gone through all that, the casserole was ready and Harry quickly levitated bowls and cutlery to the table.
"Severus must have been at Hogwarts at the same time," noted Malfoy quietly. "They'd be in different years but he may know something."
Harry jumped at the amused drawl, realising belatedly that Malfoy was awake and staring at him with his not at all fascinating eyes. He felt his face heat up.
"Well..." Hermione gave him a wise look. "If you're going to work together, it will be much easier if you're not fighting all the time."
Thank you for reading! Appreciate the kudos and comments - you're awesome! Please keep them coming :)
Draco jumped, shocked back into the present, and made some sort of garbled comment that Potter obviously translated as 'no', because a split second later the bathroom door flew open and the saviour of the wizarding world rushed in. He came to an abrupt halt as his glasses steamed up in the moist air and muttered a quick spell to clear them.
The Floo roared and deposited Hermione into the empty kitchen. It was too quiet, Grimmauld Place heavy with sorrow. Cursing herself for leaving Harry alone with a Malfoy, Hermione cast a quick seeking spell and hurtled up the stairs with Madam Pomfrey following close behind.
"Yeah, but no-one was talking. They brought in a couple of known suspects. Robards wants Malfoy to take a look, see if he recognises any of them. He doesn't know you were down there today."
Potter caught at him, steadying him automatically with a hand splayed around his waist that caused the direction of Draco's stumble to reverse. He fell briefly into Potter's embrace, thigh colliding with warm thigh. His heart stuttered, answered by the darkening of Potter's cheeks. They froze. A jolt of magic passed between them, undiluted emotions too jumbled to interpret.
Malfoy leaned down and kissed him again, their tongues curling wantonly around each other. The brush of stubble against cheek, teeth against jaw and neck and collarbone built the tension until they were both leaking, warmth sliding between them on belly and groin.
Even the customary snark was missing and there was a vulnerability about Malfoy's features that made something uncomfortable twist in Harry's gut.
Malfoy had came to a halt on the landing, waiting for directions. He stared down at Harry, his eyes dark in the gloom. "When you've finished," he said, an under-current of amusement lying beneath the exhaustion.
The muscle along Malfoy's jaw clenched and for a moment Harry thought he would refuse, then he held out his hand and let Harry drop the wand across it.
"I'll do what I can, Harry, but I can't promise anything. Feelings are still high about Death Eaters and the Ministry is obviously no exception."
Get the coffee and plan what to say, what to do to alleviate the ridiculous situation and actually get Malfoy some aid.
"But yes, I know potions, and I might know a few people to talk to, but you'll have to get my restrictions lifted; I'm no use if I can't even go to Wizarding London."
Draco cried out, frantic with fear, struggling furiously as claws fastened on his hip, digging cruelly into his skin. With a tremendous twist he broke free, yelping as filthy claws scored tracks down his side. He staggered to his feet and bolted out of the library, the tattered remains of his shirt flapping around him. Swinging left outside the door, he opened his stride and pelted down the corridor, the sound of the werewolf's pursuit closing on him from behind.
"Don't call her that. And no. Ginny and me are over." Harry sighed. "It's...I don't want you to get hurt because of this, because of me."
Harry nodded mutely, confused as to why his throat was suddenly tight and his eyes burning. Madam Pomfrey's grip tightened.
Draco handed him the list, fighting an urge to duck as a flock of paper memos skimmed over his head, bringing the disquieting sensation that he was under attack from a barrage of disapproving paperwork. He'd been out of the Wizarding world for far too long.
"There wasn't any point buying much. No magic, remember? But there was one thing." He turned to face Harry. "Lethe River Water."
"It's complicated; it's Malfoy," said Harry with a shrug, wishing it had been something as simple as a fight.
Harry jumped in front of him and threw a powerful calming spell at the violent column of wind and debris but the power of the magic battled with his own and the funnel screamed like a banshee as it reached out towards them.
Then Malfoy knelt up between Harry's thighs, taking himself in hand and sliding his fingers up and down his own length, swirling his thumb over his slit and spreading pearly pre-cum over the gleaming head. Harry raised himself onto his elbows, watching avidly as Malfoy reached one hand behind himself and whispered a spell. His eyes went wide, startled, almost frightened, then he moved forwards with determination so that his knees were on either side of Harry's hips, a question on his face.
That just made it all worse. Draco held his breath and fought to keep himself together, wondering what it would be like if the sympathy was because Potter actually gave a shit rather than because he was embarrassed that his best mate had less manners than a Death Eater.
"Malfoy has a theory," he said quietly, pushing his knuckles more securely against the other man's hand. "I think you should hear him out."
By Potter's expression of mingled guilt and embarrassment, it was obvious he was about to launch into a Gryffindor-style analysis of his comments to the Weasel, a subject better avoided in Draco's opinion. He butted in smoothly, cutting Potter off in mid-sentence.
"Do you really think I can't protect myself against a Malfoy?" "...we need him, and he needed the deal..." "We'll get this case sorted, Malfoy will go back to doing whatever it is that he does and we can all get back to normal."
That's enough, he told himself sternly. It was time to concentrate on business. Potter, for whatever convoluted reason, had helped him out initially and it was now his duty to complete his part of the deal. Even if the Ministry hadn't been involved, there was still a matter of magical debt to honour.
He was still gasping for breath when he felt Malfoy lifting away, his cock jutting in front of him and flushed pink.
"I bought a drink, made the usual conversational moves. It was going well; in fact I'm sure I had a positive contact with a third party, then that..."
He waited, letting Malfoy make the play, contenting himself with the slide of his hands over the long planes of Malfoy's back, the bone-deep pleasure of his weight lying between Harry's thighs.
"Now, Mr Potter! There's no need for that! If there's ever anything at all we at Hogwarts can do to help, you only have to ask."
"That's not like him," snarled Harry, too hurt to think clearly. "Did he trip or something trying to run away?"
They traded blows for a while, seeker-fast reflexes and their customary efforts to outdo each other making it a fast moving match that no-one in their right minds could describe as sparring.
In fact Draco was finding it difficult to shrug off an insulating fog of resignation that seemed to have settled around him overnight. He supposed vaguely that he was still tired, some lingering after-effect of the last few weeks...or maybe of the fuck-up he'd made of his entire life. Whatever Potter decided to do, or not to do, on a personal or professional basis, it would be probably be no more than Draco deserved.
"No," Harry gritted out, breaths laboured and abdomen clenching as he tried to keep up his powerful rhythm. "I want to see your face, Draco." His tone was pleading, mouth begging as it glided along Draco's collarbones and sucked onto the curve of his neck just below his jawline.
"Don't you dare," Harry warned, desire swirling in his eyes as Draco ignored him. The blond let out a soft moan, jerking himself in unrushed flicks of his wrist, eyes trained on Harry's.
"I'm not sure," Draco admitted, hand now slowly descending down Harry's neck, only stopping when he reached his chest. "I think I like the idea of you looking a little more rugged. Sully the good boy image you've got going on."
He let Harry all but fuck his mouth with his tongue before breaking the kiss, groaning when Harry just continued his endeavour down his neck. Running the tip of his tongue up and down the curve of Draco's neck, Harry risked sucking a hard mark into the flushed skin, all but devouring the blond who was finding it harder by the second to remember why keeping Harry here was such a bad idea. Trailing a hand down his chest, Harry lazily tugged at Draco's cock, which made a cheap attempt at hardening again, palm skirting to his ass to all but hoist Draco back into his lap. The blond went willingly, winding his arms around Harry's shoulders as he guided the brunet's mouth back to his own. Palms kneading Draco's sensitive cheeks, Harry gave the one he slapped a gently pat which Draco scolded at, hand reaching to push Harry's face away from his own.
Shaky hands made work of loosening the ropes, aided by a pair of a forgotten knife found idling under Harry's bed. Groaning, Draco shook out his arms, rolling his wrists to regain circulation before curling up into Potter's side. Though he would never admit it, one of his favorite parts of having sex was being able to cuddle up to Harry afterward. Feel the Gryffindor tiredly run his fingers through his hair, half-heartedly immediately attempt to start the next round though barely conscious enough to guide his mouth to Draco's own. He kissed Harry back adoringly still, taking the time to run his hands over his boyfriend's chest and arms, squeezing the toned flesh and grazing his nails against his hipbones until Harry scurried away from the touch, ticklish.
"You can do all that, but conjuring a bird gives you a migraine?" Draco remarked dryly, groaning when Harry shoved his legs up and towards his chest, exposing his ass to the cool air. Nearly ripping off his shirt and tie, the brunet wasted no time slicking up his fingers before driving one into Draco's tight entrance. The Slytherin cried out, shaking as Harry threw either leg over his shoulders, smiling cheekily down at the writhing blond as he hastily prepped him.
"If you're going to be a pain at least come over here and explain this spell to me," Harry caved, clearing up space on the bed beside him for Draco. Pleased, the other boy crawled up the bed, dropping down heavily at the brunet's side before glancing at the spellbook. Taking out his own wand Draco lazily waved it in the air.
"So long as you actually promise to help me practice my spells once we regain the ability to stand up," Harry countered and Draco huffed.
Harry snorted back, shaking his head as he brushed a thumb across Draco's nipple, enjoying the sigh it evoked from the blond. Dipping his head he swirled his tongue along the erect nub, nipping quickly when Draco made to bat his face away.
"So perfect," He murmured, bending over to kiss Draco's right cheek, repeating the action on the other side as he suddenly drove two crooked fingers inside Draco.
Draco tries to steady the slight tremble of his hand and starts turning another page, before realizing that he’s merely skimmed the previous one without registering any real information. His hand freezes in mid-air for a moment before he sighs heavily and closes the book, frustrated.
Draco grabs for the cloak with uncanny precision in the dark, and all but rips it off of him in haste. Harry quickly casts a
When he gathers up his belongings and bids Merlin goodnight, Draco’s still a little dazed from the rather incredible discoveries he’s made over the course of their long conversation. He’s not even sure which one he finds the most shocking, whether it’s history’s drastic alteration and fabrication of Merlin’s story, his firm belief in his destiny to serve Arthur, or the fact that he essentially recreated a piece of Camelot for himself with this room. What Draco is absolutely certain about though, is something Merlin didn’t have to spell out for him. Slytherins simply do not risk their lives for just anyone. To Merlin, Arthur must’ve been his everything and more.
On the page, underneath several scratched out spells is one that theoretically should fully restore the door. He whispers it several times to test his pronunciation, before raising his wand at the door, then swishes and points.
“Spending it at Grimmauld, probably. ” Harry shrugs. “Might be going to the Burrow for Christmas dinner.”
— that clings all too tightly to his legs, his hair slightly tousled now that he’s stopped putting so much gel in it. He’s cradling a hefty stack of books and journals in one arm, undoubtedly his research on Transfiguration.
“I think there are many versions. To Muggles, they're all just folklore. The one I read is a fairly popular version, I think. Merlin is Arthur’s servant, and he would use magic to help him in secret because Arthur’s half-sister became an evil sorceress. There might have been a dragon that talks — ” Harry trails off, trying to remember the rest.
“It’s not like that.” He shakes his head and tosses the newspaper back at Pansy a little vehemently. “We were just — hanging out
Draco nods and tries not to think about the implications in those words. He stands up and pushes the chair back to its place, still a little dazed.
He finally says it, just like that, as easy as if he's been calling him by his given name all this time. Draco thinks a little forlornly back on the boy who couldn't be at home in his own house, who muttered the name in secret to a tampered radio, praying that he'd live.
Draco takes another gulp of Firewhisky, but doesn’t tear his gaze off of him. Potter stops his humming then and opens his eyes, a dark, hazy green, smoldering with something that resembles longing. They hold each other’s gaze, while the song keeps playing.
Harry Potter is the saviour of the Wizarding World, the beacon of everything that is right and good. He’s a flash of lightning in the dark and gloomy sky in midsummer, electrifying and powerful. He’s so close, yet just far enough to be out of reach.
when I was young, could I?” The young man rolls his eyes, looking half indignant and half amused. He then leans back in his chair and absentmindedly waves his right hand, conjuring the flames in the fireplace into the shape of a baby dragon. Draco notices it then, the bright red cape draped over the arm of the chair—It’s embellished with a golden, embroidered dragon that looks rather regal. It matches the color scheme of the room.
They’re in Draco’s room. Potter had stopped on their way at Granger’s room to grab a bottle of Dittany. Draco sits down at his bed and huffs begrudgingly before stripping off his uniform jumper and loosening his tie. Admittedly, that hex does sting quite a bit more than usual.
But none of these is the most dreaded kind. That, by far, is the one closest to reality, the one where he makes it out of the fire and walks on solid ground, only to witness his savior lying pale and motionless, in the half-giant’s arms.
“Perhaps he went to visit someone for Christmas.” Draco sighs, resigned. “Portraits do that, right?”
A few of them gasp in horror, and Draco definitely has a newfound sense of respect for this woman. A few mumbled apologies later, Lovegood dismisses her younger housemates before turning back to Harry.
“I wouldn’t jump to that conclusion so quickly,” Merlin says eventually, pulling at the fraying edges of his tunic absentmindedly.
Draco soon notices that Potter seems to always know when he goes to the Room of Requirement. He’s there every time Draco is, but on the days that Draco stays in, he could always hear through their shared wall Potter’s radio playing Muggle rock music late into the night.
“Don’t you see, Draco?” Merlin glances down at the cape draped over the arm of his chair and splays his fingers gently over the embroidered dragon, caressing it like one would a lover’s cheek. “I wish I had told him sooner. I wish there were fewer secrets between us. I wish I had said all the things I wanted to say. I wish we had more time. And now, I don’t want to see you make the same mistake.”
“I — I’d be honored.” He sputters, and the older Slytherin tilts his head and narrows his eyes like he can see right through him.
“Harry, we’re getting married,” Draco says. He’s grinning like an idiot. “We’re getting married. You bought me a ring.”
Draco was sorting through tea orders in the storage room. He was always sorting through tea orders. When Starbucks closed, he’d made the split-second decision to buy the now empty space, and Harry had made the slightly less split-second decision to invest in Draco’s dream. Seven months later and the new cafe was doing better than they could have ever hoped. Draco often worked long hours, but when he came home smelling like coffee beans and Earl Grey with a satisfied smile, Harry found he didn't mind.
“Three days is perfect,” Riven murmured. Draco thought he looked beautiful then, with the evening light reflecting off the snow to cloud his face in shadow, and the steam of his breath floating over his cheeks. He wanted to tell Riven that, and explain why he was hurting. Explain why his heart still called for green eyes and full lips pulled up in a smirk.
After two days of sitting behind their cramped stall, however, even pondering the meager woes of royalty became dull, and Draco grew bored. Distraction came almost suspiciously well timed in the form of a dark figure slipping up to the side of the table. Shadows were growing over the marketplace and lanterns had already gone up on the street. Draco was polishing a ring when the man caught his attention.
“Harry wants to make love to him,” Hermione admonished. “He wants to take Malfoy on picnic dates and feed him breakfast in bed, isn’t that right, Harry?”
“Draco, as loathe as I am to inflate your massive ego, you are unfairly beautiful,” his friend sighed. “The perfect age to marry, and a completely hopeless romantic. I’d bet good money that he’s the topic of most of your—” he shuddered “—
Hermione was curled up around Pansy on the rug, her bushy head tucked under her girlfriend's slim chin. Ron, Neville, and Blaise were piled on top of one another. Theo was dating Parvati, a strange but intense relationship if Harry had ever seen one, and he’d noticed Goyle walking the grounds with Luna on more than one occasion. All in all, they’d managed to nurture a tentative peace between Slytherin and the other three houses, if the silencing charms around everyone's rooms were to be trusted.
finish that sentence.” He grimaced. “And don’t invite me ‘round for dinner for the foreseeable future.” He wasn’t sure how he would face Hermione now.
“Alright.” Six is great, six is perfect. Harry waves with a smile and finally closes his door. Draco’s heart is beating a mile a minute and he thinks he may just throw up on Pea, but he hasn’t been this excited in weeks. This is definitely the opposite of social distancing but at this point they’ve shared all their germs over Pea and he really doesn’t give a fuck.
“Don’t tease me.” Draco’s voice was so quiet Harry almost didn’t understand him, but his tone was exasperated.
“Draco,” Harry says. He swallows once more, and then he reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a black box. The band nestled inside is thin silver when he flicks it open, studded with diamonds and sapphires, and Draco knows it’s not what Harry would have chosen but it’s what Harry knows Draco would want.
He throws them both a saucy wink and leaves with all the smugness of a man who’s done his yearly good deed. Harry’s going to murder him before the day is done.
“Yes, the bloody hair!” Harry’s had his fair share of existential crises in his life. He’s well acquainted with the feeling, and this one is going near the top of the list.
“Here, sir,” Pansy said seriously. “The hottest thing we have. I'm sure you’ll want him to go, so here’s your receipt.” She waved the little piece of paper in front of Harry, and when he only stared she leaned across the counter with a sigh to shove it down his front pocket.
“Wha—I was meant to finish that!” Harry said. He hadn’t been looking forward to it, but he did feel terrible about being the cause of it in the first place.
“Y-your highness,” Draco stuttered, immediately attempting a bow, but struggling with the load in his arms.
He pushes his closed fist against Draco’s curled fingers, with no plan further than to see what that triggers. To Harry’s pleasant surprise, however, Draco latches onto his hand and cradles it to his chest without checking what’s inside.
“I mean— of course, yes...” Draco chanced a glance at Harry’s face, but it had grown dark enough that he could barely make out the gleam of his eyes. “A couple times. If I liked them, and they liked me, I’d clearly give it some thought. I know Pansy’s obsessed with the idea so it must be either madness or genius.”
He could feel Harry’s heartbeat against his chest, and he never wanted to let go. He could have kissed him forever like this, tangled together and drunk on happiness.
Draco was surprised to discover that Riven was not nearly as courteous and cultured as he seemed. Beneath his pretty words lay an extensive and well-worshipped vocabulary of the most crass curses Draco had ever had the pleasure of hearing. It had taken several slip-ups, but when Draco made it clear there would be no judgment between them, Riven relaxed and let his tongue run wild. He said what he wanted about who he wanted in whatever way he pleased, and Draco struggled to keep his amusement under wraps. This Riven was coin flip from the composed, serious prince he first met at the market and outside his house. It was refreshing, reminding him a lot of Blaise. It also reminded him of another dark haired friend, but Draco would banish those thoughts every time they crept up on him.
“Hm.” Draco seemed to deliberate for a moment before he drew his wand. With a quick glance around for nosy coworkers and a precise flick, he Vanished half the splatters from the ceiling down to the counters.
The thirty-eight was indeed pulling up just behind the first double-decker, and they jogged to the door together, waving clumsily to the driver. Harry almost slipped on the muddied floor as he stepped on and it was Malfoy’s turn to catch his arm with an uncharacteristic giggle.
“You don’t?” Harry shot back. “Oh, don’t try,” he rolled his eyes when Draco hesitated. “You’ve been eyeing my arse every quidditch game of the season— you’re not subtle.”
“Don’t hurt yourself, Potter,” Draco says quickly. He doesn’t want to listen to a verbal rejection. He can’t imagine that would go over well with his Veela magic. “I understand that that was the extent of our arrangement.”
Harry finds him behind an obnoxious glass desk on the top floor of an equally obnoxious glass building. There is an array of succulents spread on the left edge of the desk and a silver MacBook rests on the right. The center is crystal clear in every sense of the word, offering a view of leather-clad legs, and Harry briefly entertains the idea of smashing that ostentatious desk cleanly in half.
“What? Really?” Harry spun in his chair, catching sight of Draco’s long legs disappearing around the corner. For once, he’d been preoccupied enough that he hadn’t noticed him leave Savage’s desk. “Where’s he going?”
Silence finally falls around them in a deep hush. The ebbing and flowing of Draco’s breath whispers against the fabric of the sheets, and Harry sighs before nuzzling into his hair. His hand is already getting a bit sweaty where it’s held tight in Draco’s, but it keeps them close in the center of the bed, and Harry likes that. He closes his eyes.
“Didn’t take you for a romantic,” Draco whispered conspiratorially against Harry’s jumper. “Shall I ask Pansy for a few recommendations for you?”
(there being the Janus Thickey Ward). Harry’s Malfoy-stalking tendencies occupy their own corner of his mind however, and certainly don’t apply to the here and now.
Several things happened very quickly after that. He pitched forward, right at an alarmed Draco Malfoy, who stepped back, letting go of the doors. The doors themselves slid shut just as Harry passed through, which was fortunate, but not fortunate enough, because it meant that he tipped head-first into Draco’s waiting arms.
And he certainly wasn’t far off, was he? He already loved Riven as a friend, how hard could it be to shift that love into something different? In fact, if it weren’t for Harry, he was certain he a would have already done so. He had some measure of feelings for Riven. They just couldn’t seem to stand against the rest of his heart.
“I’d choose you too,” Draco mumbled the moment they parted. Harry didn’t give him a chance to elaborate.
It’s Harry of course, but it’s Harry in shorts. It’s Harry in a T-shirt that has no right being that tight, Harry with a sheen of sweat over his face and dampening his hair and flat stomach. Harry looking flushed and out of breath and like he’s just run halfway around the park. Draco gulps and drops half his mail.
“Is it something I’ve done?” Riven’s words were slow and careful, and they broke Draco’s heart. “Something I’ve said...?”
“I was trying,” Harry says against the corner of his mouth. “We’re on the same page that this is somewhat, sort of, in some manner a date?”
He didn’t blame the others for staying away this year. Where they had only lost a few weaker pillars of their status, pieces that could be replaced over time, the Malfoys were shattered. Lucius was in Azkaban for seven years and then on house arrest for another three. The sentence was lenient, the Wizengamot emphasized. The ministry had stormed the manor and scoured it top to bottom for Dark Artifacts. Expensive apparently now qualified as evil in the reformed Auror guidlines. They'd left enough behind, but it had still been hard on his mother.
“No, that’s not what I meant!” Potter groans and rubs a hand over his face. “I’d like to see you again, is what I’m saying. I had an amazing time, and if it’s alright with you, I’d really like to take you out. Properly.”
Fuming, he turned to the last place where he knew he’d be sure to get some peace and quiet. He trudged through the familiar corridors and up spiraling stairs upon stairs with a solemn sort of resignation.
Unlike the many celebratory balls held in May, the gala tonight was not mandatory. Harry had already been planning to go (he was under threat from Hermione), but he hadn’t bothered with new dress robes. He did, however, hang his old ones up before he left for work, shooting a quick ironing charm at them. He didn’t usually believe in superstition, but he felt compelled to make an effort if he wanted any chance of Draco going out with him.
Although Potter’s looking at him like Draco’s his own little world, and he laughs in a choked, relieved sort of way, as if he’s just as shocked as Draco is.
She reached over to squeeze his hand, and Harry wondered once again how he’d landed himself with such caring, if somewhat misguided, friends.
“Friends,” Draco let the word roll around in his mouth. “I’d like that too. Please stop by, I’m sure at the very least my mother will be ecstatic.”
wrong with me? Am I that awful? I know I was cruel to him, but he’d reply in kind and I didn’t realize I was— that he would leave—”
Harry gave her a nod in thanks and rounded the counter. Pansy held open the back door for him, muttering about horny tossers and low pay.
“It’s Riesling,” he explains to Harry, even though Harry has no idea what Riesling is. “You’ll like it. Everyone does. Remote please?” Harry hands it to him and sits down. Pea promptly trots over to sink onto his lap.
But Hot Neighbor is already holding his own phone with an expectant face, and doesn’t seem to be aware of the jumble of embarrassment that is currently Harry Potter, so he lists off his number with only the slightest stumble.
– shoved the cupcake at him and started digging about in his robes. “I had it here somewhere, sorry for not giving it to you earlier, but I completely forgot about it until just a few weeks ago. I would have given it back ages ago otherwise…”
“I’m sure you must have been wondering where I disappeared to, these past few weeks.” His voice was stilted.
Harry pushed past a group of tourists and opened the door to Starbucks, sighing in delight at the burst of hot air. He loved London weather— where Ron dubbed it depressingly drab, Harry preferred terms like calming or meditative— but the winters were undeniably too fucking cold. A horrid drizzle had just started, and while the day was perfect for sitting by the fire with a cup of tea, he'd instead been walking down Southbank for twenty minutes. To make matters worse, he’d forgotten his gloves that morning in his rush to get to work. Harry's hands were numb from the wrists down. He kept glancing at them to reassure himself that his fingers were still there, because he certainly couldn’t feel them.
“Are you certain you were meant to do all of this by hand?” Draco said, eyes wide as he took in the mess. “How does one go about cleaning this without magic?”
“I care for you,” Potter says quietly. “An awful lot. And I’d like to get the chance to show you how much. Is that alright?”
The department around him was silent. Bunch by bunch, he began to unshrink every rose. Harry spread their shedding petals over the floor. He conjured up vases and set them on the shelves, filling them flower by flower. Their scent, soft and natural, clouded the room as he worked. Slowly, meticulously, Harry covered every surface in blooming red, until they sprung from the cabinets, the drawers, the very carpet. From every corner they stared back at him.
It was barely noticeable, but Harry caught the muscle that jumped in Draco's jaw and the way his hands twitched on the edges of the blanket.
He worries for a second about sounding too pushy, then he worries about sounding desperate, then he realizes in horror that he’s used the word “arse” in a conversation with Draco in
And Draco, finding it in his coat pocket, had naturally checked the back. Perhaps Harry’s heartfelt and honest efforts, which up until that point had only led him to failure, had finally worked. Just not for him, it seemed.
hard, not even a little, but his panicked struggle to tug the mercilessly short Auror robes over his lap leaves him wrinkled and guilty-looking when Malfoy reaches them.
“I’m sorry, go ahead.” Harry nods at him in a way he hopes is friendly and not angry and/or belying the intense appreciation he has for the way the bloke’s hair falls in soft blond whisps into his grey eyes.
“So,” Harry says. Kiss. “I feel like— we’re on the same page that—” Draco licks between Harry’s lips at that point, which is his fault entirely, he knows, but he really can’t help it. He’s floating on something otherworldly, and he hasn’t crashed into the reality of ‘Harry’s not
. When he straightened again, there was a smirk playing around the corners of Draco’s sharp mouth. Harry tried not to lick his own lips. He felt a bit too ashamed to indulge in any appreciation of Draco’s form.
“Are you really trying to tell me I’ve eliminated all the bad choices and therefore I logically will have a good and happy life?”
His and Potter’s, perhaps. Once. Draco tries not to think about that. It’s an impossibility. Not physically, of course, and that makes it worse—the fact that he could have a child,
“See you in ten,” he waved. Harry had the presence of mind to step out of the way for the new group of customers filing in through the door and go find a seat by the windows. As he sat, periodically glancing up to watch Draco faff about with Pansy or fill orders, he thought perhaps the cold wasn’t so bad. Then when grey eyes met his over the counter, and Draco offered him a small smile, Harry thought he’d never been warmer.
Harry pokes his head back into the living room to give Draco a disbelieving look. “Wine is crying juice.”
“He was civil today,” Draco reminds Harry. “I can’t believe he let us go so quickly, too. He really looked like he was gearing up for tea.”
“This is my favorite part of the gardens,” Draco admits. He waits for Harry to make fun of him, to joke or to look surprised, to nod and tell him he agrees, but all he says is—
“He doesn’t know, does he?” Pansy says quietly from beside him. It’s how Draco knows to answer her seriously—she’s always either loud or louder, her voice shrill and snapping over every nearby conversation. But above all Pansy’s always spared his privacy. It’s also how he knows she loves him.
He could scarcely believe himself, could barely piece together what was happening, and he clutched Draco closer by the waist, desperate to hold him. As if that might prove he were more real.
“I’m going to shove currants so far up your arse, you’ll be shitting berries for months,” Harry shoots back.
“I see,” the prince paused. “And I am sorry too... but if you will not take my hand now, I can only keep asking. I will not retract my offer yet. Please think about it.”
Harry would protest, but wine sounds suspiciously date-like and he’s one hundred percent on board with that. He doubts Draco means it that way but it’s not going to stop him from enjoying the experience while he can.
Between the holiday madness and the Malfoy madness (as Ron liked to call it) the office Christmas party snuck up on all of them. Harry had forgotten about it entirely. Harry was thankful that Ron reminded him in time, because the sight of Draco in a Christmas jumper was turning out to be his favorite present.
Draco really doesn’t understand what’s happening. He’d resigned himself to a lifetime of solitude and misery. This turn of events is messing with his head. “What about Ginevra?” he finally asks.
Draco doesn’t respond, but his cheeks slowly darken and Harry thinks his heart might actually stop. Forget coronavirus, he’s getting taken out by a blond with a fat cat. What a way to go.
He thought about every mistake he’d made, and every decision that, no matter how terrible, he would never take back because they had left him and those he loved alive to see it through. Draco let them rush past and fly off into the night before regret could consume him. He was left with a gentle hollow feeling, as though his own mind was finally making temporary peace with him, leaving him empty and free.
Harry thought quietly for a moment, mostly to avoid Hermione’s stew, but also because she may have had a point. Draco rarely paid attention to his admirers, and they certainly shared a penchant for direct advances. Perhaps Harry did need to find a more subtle route—something that would show he cared respectfully, something that might indicate he knew Draco a bit better than Dennis Creevey did.
“It’s magnificent,” Harry says. “You think we’ll ever be able to get our garden at home up to standard?”
