She rolls her eyes. “You know what, take a month. Or two. Take the entire year, Draco, if you need it. Your job will be here when you come back.”
Harry left shortly after their conversation to a chorus of goodbyes.
I had to be happy for them. But it didn’t diminish the loneliness of realising I couldn’t gather my pieces together, either they didn’t fit anymore or I had lost them.
, she’d said the first day—and in her tall, intimidating stance.
It was easy to forget that Draco was…well Draco, when he wasn’t seeing him in person, just through notes. Draco stood by the door. His navy fisherman knit jumper was oversized and had slipped down one shoulder. He was wearing jeans and barefoot. Harry got the feeling he was in trouble, but he wasn’t sure why.
"Your mother was a much better pianist than I have ever been." But dutifully, he bent his head, squinted and pushed his glasses back up his nose. Draco played with more care before the melody collapsed underneath his fingers, and he gave up, taking his hands off the keys.
"What?"
“I’ve done it before.”
had started to appease Pansy’s concerns, but it didn’t take long until Draco started genuinely wanting to be better, to
“Elle,” he starts again, tone more sombre this time. Draco hardly ever calls his patients by their first names, and this prompts her immediate reaction, as her eyes find his. “I need you to come more often. I’ll need to monitor you more closely. Can you make it five times a week?” He’d like to monitor her every day, but Draco doesn’t want to take all freedom from her before it’s extremely necessary.
about ten years ago, when he had to stop frequenting the Muggle places he used to go, they haven’t talked about it anymore. Without giving it much thought, Draco had assumed Luna had also stopped going to the Community Centre, though now he sees it makes little sense.
There were more commemorative plates for weddings, memorials, and births; some for family, some for presumed friends. He recognised last names too: Meadowes, Longbottom, Nott, and even Weasley.
“It’s not up to you,” Harry says. When his hands slip away from Draco’s, it feels like he’s losing part of himself. Although they're just there… just out of reach, Draco can’t bring himself to grab them again.
And honestly, by this point, what wouldn’t Draco do to see this smile  every minute of every day?
Harry opens his eyes one after the other, grins softly up at Draco. “I did,” he mutters croakily.
Instead, he tries keeping his routine. He’s not drinking as much now, and he still goes out every day, even if he just ends up loitering around his neighbourhood.
Christmas that year was a disaster.
it had been spontaneous, and they ended up hanging it for everyone to see. It was taken on their wedding day, and it had been completely still since the morning Harry didn’t wake up again. Now, though, it moved again, slowly, as if waking up under Harry’s stare. Draco glances at both, marvelling at how the house he had thought so absent of magic, so ordinary and Muggle, recognises Harry.
"Where’s Neville?" Harry asked.
"I know you have your magical remedies, but ginger tea will clear it right up."
“I’m afraid I - I don’t have any idea--” Draco began, deeply unsettled and intent on ending the strange encounter once and for all. He didn’t even finish his sentence before hurrying clumsily into the dark.
"I’m fine," Harry said, wiping a few escaped tears. "Do you want to do more tests?"
"You’re very sweet," Atty said to Teddy.
"Sorry," Luc echoed.
He always ends up in Harry’s arms, lost in his eyes, in his touch.
“What I don’t like is not having my husband home for three days. You’re going to eat. And then rest for a bit.”
Draco frowns, face creased in a grimace much like Harry’s. “You think I like that, Potter? To watch you slipping away like this? I only want to make sure you’re safe when I’m not here.”
Rushing to the hearth, Draco’s met with a redhead’s face popping up in the green flames. He doesn’t know how to answer, and he’s thankful that Molly Weasley takes only one glance at him before coming over.
"He's different."
Draco nods, turning his flushed face away.
Draco knows he can’t keep treating Harry. Not officially. It’s too personal. It’s impossible for him, as professional as Draco claims he is, to separate his love for Harry from his duties as a Healer. Yet…
"Let's get you home," Blaise said softly. They left first.
Being without Harry felt like dying anyway, he thinks, without voicing his words. Instead, he says, “I’m fine.”
To Harry's surprise, after a round of hugs and cheek kisses, Draco took Harry's arm, and they left as they arrived. Together. He leaned into Harry in a way that made Harry feel like he'd been left in charge even though it was Draco who steered them to the Apparition Point.
“Oh,” Draco lets out ineloquently.
"Madam Vice-Captain." Harry gave her a hug, and she laughed.
"A scroll with a nasty bonding spell for a reluctant couple," Draco murmured. "It’s contained."
everywhere. From the empty space in the closet where Draco kept Harry’s clothes neatly aligned for years, to the drawers he refuses to fill again since he sent Harry his socks and underwear a couple months ago.
As the night falls quieter and the buzz of the hospital dies down, their conversation drifts to other innocent topics.
"Yeah, I saw," Harry said. "How did you get around the curse?" Harry asked out of curiosity.
Harry raised an eyebrow.
Potter's gaze flicks towards him. Draco’s found it is somewhat disconcerting staring into those green eyes—sometimes bright, sometimes distant—but he’s always drawn to them and he can’t avert his eyes, even if he wants to.
"I won’t lift anything," Harry promised. Not being cleared to play the Harpies next week was out of the question, and there was only a light workout to fill his day.
Draco’s trying to decipher how, in Circe’s name, to finish this beef bourguignon recipe in that damned empty kitchen—he is not giving up or his name is not Draco—when a voice calls his attention.
and spent half of their day recording the event.
Draco’s last hope had been finding Harry here. So, he had sacrificed himself, knowing the Dark Mark had rendered part of his soul dark many years ago. Pansy waits for him—for them—on the other side, his anchor in the mortal helm.
Draco finally understands why Marvin thought they could be good to each other, and why Potter reminded him of Draco. Potter, not unlike Draco, is paralysed by guilt and grief that shouldn’t live in a person so young; a pain so strong that it's hard to separate it from who they are.
“Why does it matter?”
, he had argued, and when Harry prompted him to fix it instead, Draco had raised an eyebrow and huffed vexedly. It’s beyond him how Harry manages to break so many things, but he can forgive it, only because those fingers are also very proficient in different—and more... organic—tasks.
What if everything goes wrong? More wrong than he can possibly deal with—because things aren’t great to start with.
He should know the answer to this, but he can’t put his finger on it.
Draco nods, lips coming to press against Harry’s palm. “Too much work. I will be fine,” he whispers to the lines of Harry’s hand.
He ceases all attempts when Harry only grins at him and almost makes his heart stop.
Harry’s fingers brush across the thin white lines scarring Draco’s chest. He stops, eyes roaming over the patterns that mar the alabaster skin.
The violin’s chords are soft, a low rumble in the distance. The song is a warning, Draco somehow knows. It’s time to go back, he thinks, with the faint realisation that he hears Pansy’s voice calling his name somewhere in the back of his mind.
"You can sort out your own issues without using me as some sort of f"—she glanced at Rose—"messed up justification for your guilt."
Neville’s expression changed to something inscrutable.
Draco glances around once, finds the branch he had used for the ritual resting on the bedside table, broken in two pieces. He summons them, casting another diagnostic spell over the pieces. But there’s no sign of magic in them anymore, which means it should have been transferred back to Elle by now.
“It’s going to be fine,” he insists, and then lists what he’s going to do for the tenth time. “Arrive early, find a good and private table, order coffee for me and tea for Harry. Wait for him.”
Other consequences to writing the letter followed on the heels of the announcement about Harry’s League fine.
"Yeah?" Harry asked. It wasn’t like Ron sat around pining. In those years, Ron had gone to Auror training and went on a date or two. Nothing serious. Ron was picking at the other edge of the carpet, separating it into beige strings.
Harry was careful approaching him, and Draco almost seemed startled when Harry faced him. His face was unreadable, mouth drawn and eyes hard. He was dressed as casually as Harry had ever seen him, with black jeans, tasselled loafers, and Harry’s grey Falcons sweatshirt.
"If you are getting married, I’ll look over the marriage contract. You’re the top athlete in the league. Do you remember what happened to Giannopoulos?"
I pressed my back closer to your chest. “I know.”
reporter, striking right at the heart of Harry’s insecurities. It was all politics, but there was a time he was so good it would have never been a question. Now they could go for someone else talented but younger, less controversial. Playing for England in Worlds made him ineligible to play for any of the other regional Nationals teams to discourage poaching; right about now Harry wished he had gone out for Wales in 2001 instead.
I breathed once, twice.
"They never go out of tune. I would be more worried about the curtain ties that are cursed to strangle people in your new receiving room," Draco said. "This reminds me of Malfoy Manor."
"I don’t suppose you have any music?" Draco asked instead.
“I felt you,” Harry adds. “Your sadness. I’m sorry.”
Harry’s nod is slow, a weak smirk spreading across his face, making Draco recoil defensively.
“It’s just a lot, Draco,” Hermione tells him, her fingers resting against his and eyes glistening with unshed tears. “He’s trying to understand all that’s happened. Suddenly, he’s thirty years old, his best friend lives in another country, his godson is a grown boy, people he loved died overnight, and he’s constantly reminded of all that by the papers.”
"Rich people problems," Ron joked. "It makes sense, now that I think about it. Might find some good stuff. Family stuff, I mean."
"Oh, Diane is fine. She’s very busy at the clinic. Kids are driving me up the wall. They are both obsessed with some popstar this summer, and at this point I think I could be his understudy. Any chance you want to take them to a stadium tour? No? What can I do for you?"
Where’s Harry? Harry always holds him tight whenever he has a nightmare. Harry’s arms are supposed to come around his waist, lips on Draco’s nape, whispering sweet nothings to his trembling form until he falls asleep again.
He didn’t—
“I believe you’ve changed. Hermione can’t stop talking about you, honestly.
And he has to agree, sure, but feigns confusion, frowning at his friends.
“Can I sit with you?”
"Show Harry the model," Teddy demanded. Draco didn’t react to his tone. "Please," Teddy added, late, as Harry opened his mouth to say something about manners.
Draco freezes to the spot. Luna pins him to his chair with a grin. “What do you think he comes so often for, Draco?” she asks softly.
He’s tall, his bulky legs wrapping around his own stool. The man smiles brightly at him, lips full and flushed.
I could do that, deal with those few people. “Yeah, okay… I’ll go.”
"Rookie is buying us a round. What are you drinking?" Stella asked Draco.
"I suppose I could have," Harry conceded.
This grants him Granger’s attention. She puts down her volume with more force than necessary. Draco recognises the cover as one of his father’s books about Celtic familial rituals. He remembers reading it a long time ago; he remembers longing to be a part of it.
It’s an old one. Draco is in this very living room while playing the violin with a faint smile on his lips. Harry had taken it while Draco played for him. Thus it’s wonky and half of his body is out of the frame, but it’s still beautiful, regardless.
Draco gave the portrait a much harder jab of his wand with a complicated wiggle at the end, and she fell silent once again.
Harry rolled it and gave him a thumbs up.
to bring Harry back. He gave
"Sweetheart." Only Blaise could make an endearment sound like an insult. "As much as it brings me great pleasure to deny you anything, we can't help you with your house." Then he sat back, "But if you bring me a tin of these, I'll tell you more." He tapped a yellow plastic container on his desk.
"Don’t worry Potter, your virtue is safe with me," Draco said, mistaking the vaguely stunned expression. Pure-blood traditions were so peculiar. Being here with Draco was peculiar. The only thing that could make this weirder was if Draco had pinned and kissed him. But maybe it was already weird enough.
your fault. I was living on borrowed time. I lived what I had to. And I’m okay with it.”
"Never," Draco said vehemently. "Whatever everyone else sees in him has always been a mystery to me, thank Merlin."
"I don’t know," Draco answered simply. He pressed one hand to the walls of the front hall. The candles flickered as if they were telling him something. Draco’s wand remained in his shoulder holster, so Harry wasn’t certain what he was even doing. All the other Curse-Breakers had cast several spells first.
There is, however, a Harry Potter sitting on the chair near Elle’s bed, smiling brightly as the sun outside. His magic stretches lazily across the room and mixes with Elle’s, sparking as soon as Draco enters. As if Harry knows Draco is there.
Draco rushes to help her, but Elle waves him away, instead sitting on her own with the softest grimace creasing her features.
That night, Draco is poring over his books when Blaise’s great grey owl pecks his window. He jumps out of his skin once he glimpses the giant animal’s eyes, round and golden and framed by diagonal lines that always give the impression she’s mad about something. Draco’s sure she’s going to give him a heart attack one of these days. But, despite her size and her horrifying glare, he’s never met an owl sweeter than this—which is a bit ridiculous, considering her owner.
"I don’t have to, I know how it’s going to play out within the first few minutes. It's a pattern," Harry said. He tweaked it and watched their Seeker fly less actively, inch high and circling the posts instead of covering the field. Cho was still off, injured from the Kestrels’ last match. Harry had sent them flowers. Kenmare’s second string Seeker wasn’t nearly as good.
Draco stirs, the violin resting against his shoulder, his fingers lightly holding the bow. He waits. But Harry stays quiet, wary eyes watching him so intently his cheeks burn a darker shade of red.
"Curtains? Enough with the crank calls. You call again and I’m phoning the police and your school, Timothy. You ought to be ashamed of yourself," someone Harry called at the Harrods said before hanging up.
Harry turns to face him, eyes cold, lifeless. He takes a few seconds before heaving a sigh. “What?”
“I’m sure he didn’t mean it.” Hermione’s tone is low and careful. “I don’t think Harry would try to hurt you on purpose, Draco.”
A cheer went up in the locker room.
"I was going to ask Coach to put Atty in centre," Stella said.
As if hearing his howling cry, the Forest replies in a low rumble, a guttural sound that echoes among the trees. Draco looks up, meeting only the great, dark canopy above his head. The blue night sky spreads infinitely through the cracks in the leaves, the stars twinkling in silence.
a sad way to ring in 2009.
"Have you always supported the Falcons?" Ron asked. He was trying to be civil, at least.
But how can Draco let him go?
Potter is wearing ripped jeans, a ragged t-shirt, and sandals that Draco’s sure are something he'd only see people wearing at tropical beaches. His skin is even more tanned than the last time he saw him, and his eyes, though framed behind ugly round spectacles, are as bright as Draco remembers them.
"I’ll send over a contract with a deposit agreement. I’ll be here at ten sharp."
“Look at yourself,” she challenges.
Draco’s head jerks to the side, his grimace directed at whoever interrupted them in his lunch break—though his glare is diminished by the satisfaction of hearing his name in the voice of the intruder Mediwitch. Draco had made a point of having everyone at St Mungo’s calling him by his new surname, since taking Harry’s name at their wedding. It’s got a nice ring to it that doesn’t seize to amaze him.
“It’s your time, Harry. It’s okay to need it, to take care of yourself,” Luna had offered. I didn’t need her to tell me she sometimes experienced the same.
"The second is that we are practising precision. The difference between a good Quidditch player and a great Quidditch player is a few seconds, a half inch, or a slight angle."
“Her name was Ruby.”
"For the Falcons, I don’t like it because we are already fielding questions about being a ‘political team’," Pansy said. She was holding Percy’s hand, and he pressed his lips to the back of her hand.
Pansy shakes her head gravely.
"You're on the bench for the next away match. I was supposed to wait until we were there to announce it. I won't do that," Coach said to him, after pulling him aside at training. "Some team investors were not happy with your writing."
Now, they’re finally ready to treat Elle, two days after Draco got Healer Cameron’s endorsement.
"You loved him," Harry said. Pansy had all but said as much. Draco looked into the distance before continuing.
Harry caught a faint wisp of nicotine and wrinkled his nose at her. "I thought you quit."
Hermione opens her mouth, but opts to not say anything before shrugging. Her shoulders slump down, defeated, as she rests both hands on the table. “It’s the only theory we’ve got so far. I believe it’s... I believe Harry’s connected to that tree.”
“I don’t know how to,” Draco whispers.
“I thought you two were the real thing,” she says, hugging the tray close to her chest.
“I like Draco’s books,” he hears Granger say, but when he turns she’s nose deep in a book.
The Mediwitch follows him in, talking behind Draco and over the buzz of the magical dome surrounding Elle’s body. “We’ve tried stabilising her, but none of the previous treatments are working. It’s like… The curse is even stronger now, it’s rejecting every procedure.”
Harry’s laughter is bitter and makes something ugly flood in Draco’s gut. “You have me?” Harry jumps out of his seat, arms heavy by his sides. “I barely have myself, Malfoy! I’m tired.”
"Why all of this?" Harry said.
do this alone. And he’s close enough to home if he suddenly feels the need to run away.
Draco repeats, voice barely audible, “You said you would stay.”
Well, Draco can imagine why Harry didn’t tell anyone. He isn’t really in the mood to share the memories of their disastrous meeting either.
Though they won their first match against the Wasps, the media coverage was universally terrible. It was a straightforward game with home advantage 200 - 120, sixty minutes and done.
Draco’s so confused he doesn’t really know what to answer. Then...
Until now, Harry hadn’t told anyone else the real reason why, except that little boy in a letter that had taken him a month to write. Sometimes, after all the ugliness in the world, Harry liked having something beautiful to look at. Even if it was in the form of a canary yellow that chipped in his broom grip, or a pale pink shimmer barely visible except in the light. He hadn't been allowed to do things like that when he was that boy's age. He wouldn’t have dared.
The afternoon sun is warm on his face and he freezes for a second, eyes casting around anxiously. Their life had always been extremely private, but the possibility of the press finding his address is a constant terror in his life, whenever he steps outside the house. And they have been rather insistent on contacting him. Draco can’t spot anyone, though, and tries to calm down his wobbly heart.
stop feeling hurt all the time, a pain that’s sometimes his, sometimes Harry’s. He
"Good morning, Mr Potter," Draco said when he entered.
"But Lucius Malfoy—" and Andromeda sounded faintly murderous here. "Well, my sister’s husband has always been one for dramatics. And my sister would perish on the spot if she exercised her moral backbone more than once. So, here we are. Draco is the best of the lot of them." She made a small flicking gesture as if to ward off a bad omen.
“We got married.”
He takes the letter from her and shoves it back in the envelope to deal with later, eyes intently staring at his hands as they manoeuvre the paper. When he finally lifts his head, both Pansy and Blaise have schooled their expressions to a mask of indifference that is clearly just a show.
“See those shadows? They’re dead. They come here before they part. Sometimes they don’t see me. Sometimes I don’t see them.”
“I don't have a job now, and I don't know what I have to do now, but... I have to take care of… my godson, and of people who depend on me." Potter sighs, his magic pulsing around them. “They expect me to know how to fix things, to be someone I’m not.” He shrugs. “I... Sometimes I wish I was no one, and no one knew me. I wish I could disappear.”
something that got us to our knees and kept us from moving.
"How closely do you follow Quidditch?" Harry asked. Draco shrugged. Harry took a chair and sat in it sideways.
Draco’s voice is small, almost inaudible. “The same as you, I think.”
Harry heard a knock. Less than that, it was the impression of a knock. He felt someone was at the door more than he heard it. The house had always been large enough that unexpected visitors—just Hermione and Ron, who were the only people close enough to drop in without asking—sometimes sent Patronuses to come find him, so this was unexpected.
"And why would I want that?"
“You forgot to mention his other best friend is a lesbian.”
A heavy hand falls on his own, and Draco holds Janet’s fingers tightly.
Harry longed for the days this had been a simple four bedroom flat, because each new room or expanded dresser was chock full of stuff. He wished for the days a biting snuffbox and terrible decor was all the trouble he could imagine.
So he forced himself to stop monitoring the house work and made sure to do an extra afternoon stretch, some light floorwork, even when he could hear Draco puttering around and opening cursed eighteenth century sideboards from Germany. Draco had left Harry to his makeshift gym, and sometimes Harry caught glimpses of him through the door before a simple goodbye around six each evening. He ignored the knock on his wards to keep up just one more hamstring stretch, dismissing it as a package for the house and therefore Draco. The front door creaked open.
Harry sighs, leaning his head against Draco’s shoulder like he’d done so many times in the past, when the warmth of his body felt like a furnace. Now it’s just cold. “You have to go on. You can’t stay here with me. I wouldn’t forgive myself if you got trapped here too.”
Draco pushes some books to the side, making space on the corner of the table for his mug. The answer comes easily. “Yes.”
"Sometimes I can’t believe you almost sorted Slytherin. You don’t owe me anything, Harry."
, Draco repeats in his head, finding it hard to believe.
Draco wore a light black cashmere turtleneck under a grey suit. There was something about the return of the fussiness that made him seem all the more appealing.
"I thought so. Keep it moving with my drills. I want to see passes so slow and beautiful that they’ll make Gwenog Jones come out of retirement to weep. Let’s go, let’s go," Stella said.
It was easy though, to lean in on her. It was good not to be the only one trying holding the weight of the world, not to be the one everybody depended on. I didn’t need to put anyone’s needs above mine, but that was a truth I was still working on accepting, trying not to see my behaviour as selfish and arrogant.
His Floo has been locked for almost the entire time he’s been away from work—except for the day he called Healer Cameron to let her know he’d not be coming back anytime soon. And no one seems to have noticed his isolation.
Everything is monochromatic, as if in an old Muggle movie. His surroundings are shapeless, imposing. Hills, trees, houses, an endless sea—or just glimpses of them, haunting.
the lucky one for having Draco Malfoy, Death Eater scum almost makes Draco melt right here and then. “And I’m great, okay?” He turns, then, to Draco, eyes glinting and lips wet. “Draco?”
Elle’s jaw works. Her narrowed eyes focus on Draco. She’s tried sitting on the bed twice since they entered her room, but when the pain became too much, she resigned to stay on her back.
Harry nods slowly, as if he’s not heard Draco’s question, as if he’s not actually here. Draco plays their song to him, hoping Harry will stay again.
"The match goes to the Falcons 270 to 80! No luck for Puddlemere against their old Keeper. It looks like Falcons #60 Harry Potter got a nasty hit off that Bludger. He appears to be moving under sheer willpower alone. Who knows what this will mean for their next match on Wednesday with the Wanderers? The Wanderers are having a strong season and have aspirations for the Cup…"
Harry. It’s you. It’s really you,” he cries, but no tears escape his eyes as his fingers trace every line of his lover’s vacant expression. What’s happened to him?
"Yes. Wood will be Vice-Captain," he confirmed. "I still need you. Even if you won't fly, I want us to crush Kenmare. Can I trust you with the playbook?"
Even though Harry had known as much as that by his calling ‘Grand-aunt Wally’, he kept forgetting. But Draco breezed past this, and Harry would not be the one to suggest lingering.
Harry kissed him because it was the only thing he could think of to shut Draco up. It was probably the least romantic gesture in the world, but Draco went with it. Perhaps Harry could pour this maelstrom of feeling into something tangible.
Harry couldn’t help but look when he got time to spread Draco underneath him in the full light of day.
"You can use your words instead of getting the house to try to trap me," Draco said, but he was teasing. He kissed Harry on the landing and halfway down the hallway and against Harry’s door. Draco Transfigured a candleholder into a cup, and the clink of rings in it was loud.
"What?" He looked shocked.
Congratulations surround him, except for Potter, of course, but Draco doesn’t care. Potter stares at him with narrowed eyes, and says nothing.
The teasing went on for a bit on the pitch too, until Coach told them all off for not focusing.
"Watch your questions Bertrand. This isn't a personal interview, it's about the match," Pansy snapped.
Harry probably just wants to see Elle, or to be out somewhere, not locked in the flat he told Draco he hates, but it’s better than imposing on the girls.
He’s lost, and he’s done. Draco is just so tired of constantly trying to hold on to something that isn’t there anymore. He shivers, nodding slowly as new tears climb down a path on his face. His voice cracks with a single plea. “I can’t do it.”
"Why?" Harry was puzzled.
Even on his worst days, he rises with the sun. He feels protective of--and protected by--those still, silent moments before the rest of the world wakes. He knows, better than most, that time has no morality--the dead of night is not inherently evil, and midday is not good by default. The arrival of dawn does not erase sins committed in darkness, and the setting sun does not eclipse daylight’s good deeds.
better. And he does. It’s a good feeling not to be covered in dirt and have the will to get up in the morning—granted that sometimes he feels like lying down again right after. Sadness and regret are exhausting.
It’s Harry’s old phone. Small and bright red, much like Draco’s, except his is green. He never uses it anymore, not since Harry stopped replying years ago and it stayed forgotten inside his closet. It had been an easier way for them to communicate back then, and Harry always seemed to find it enjoyable to send Draco endless messages detailing his days.
“I can’t do this right now,” Draco declares, in a low cool tone. The words oddly similar to what he said to Harry before he left Serendipity. “Can we reschedule?”
He can’t have heard it right. Harry can’t love him. He just can’t. This here is a farce. This is about Draco’s heart playing tricks on him, about their bond trying to take control of their lives.
She kept my eyes when charming my appearance to look like… Not too much like me. Simple charms, she’d clarified. The place we were going would change a lot more.
"Sorry, the car’s a mess," Draco said. His expression was a little sheepish.
Ruby meows, demanding attention, but Harry’s unwavering gaze and hands are still on Draco.
“What did you just say?”
"Cold iron, engraved. Date unknown. Probably twelfth century from the stamping technique," Draco said. Harry slid it on his finger and cocked his head to the side.
In the kitchen, Draco brought out a little tan briefcase. Harry was almost certain it was Muggle in origin even if magically altered. Draco reached in and pulled out a tome so large, Harry was sure its binding must have been enchanted.
Elle doesn’t stop walking, but her eyes are on Draco now. “I don’t know. I just do. I woke up here after I died and waited. I kind of knew somehow that you’d show up, eventually.”
No one had the upper hand here. Harry wanted to argue he only had five good years of playing left, seven if he was lucky. He wanted to be braver than caring about this but he wasn’t. It reminded him of before. He never wanted to return to before. Harry could see the future close and far away at the same time. For the first time, he wasn’t sure what he wanted it to look like.
Draco is distractedly tracing the blue waves Harry has tattooed on his hip.
"Lucky, watch out!" Sam called, and it was a sign of how much Luc had given up on hating his team nickname that he responded before a practice Bludger hit him.
When they were face to face again, Harry wasted no time in continuing their earlier conversation in the form of a kiss. There was something very simple in Harry pulling Draco down onto his bed for the first time.
Harry’s eyes seem greener than ever before. It might be the sun reflecting on the bright eyes, Draco argues, licking his lips and trying to remember how to breathe.
Draco sighs, not as relieved as he’d like. Harry’s alive, but barely. His pulse is weak, faint, his heart is struggling to keep beating. The most concerning thing, though, is that he can’t feel Harry’s soul anymore. Draco can sense the magic radiating from the tree, and Harry’s own, but there’s no sign of their bond, no sign of Harry.
Harry opened the cover carefully, but for all his cautiousness it was well bound, even with the yellowing pages, newspaper clippings, and sauce stains. In a cramped hand not dissimilar to his own, it said: Mrs Georgina ‘Gigi’ Evans - Recipes.
: Harry is here, awake, in front of him, anxiously scratching the back of his neck.
Harry mouths something, working his jaw before managing to get a few words out. “Stop touching me. Get.
It took a second, but Harry caught on. "That’s fucking foul." Harry Vanished it. "Gross."
"You're cold," Draco said. The covers leapt to his hand and the sheets were dry suddenly. He drew the blankets over them both.
So he tried another tack and visited the Ministry.
Sometime after a lazy and unnecessarily indulgent round two in the early hours of the morning, Draco turned to Harry in the dark. They should have showered, but Harry liked listening to Draco’s heartbeat more, and they'd fallen asleep like that until Draco moved. Harry saw Draco stirring awake and then he spoke.
It takes three weeks of silently staring at each other before one of them yields. Potter’s eyes widen for a second, when Draco finally accepts Marvin’s offer to talk about his week.
He raised his wand, pointing it behind Draco. Straight at where Harry’s chest was.
“Draco don’t forget you still have to pay for knocking up my son! See you in two weeks, pups!”
Professor Snape was sitting at the desk, surrounded by papers and books. He looked up from the parchment he was scowling at (probably a badly written essay) and raised a brow at the teenager in front of him.
The professor hums in agreement.
He still could not wrap his head around the idea of being pregnant. There was a tiny being growing inside of him. A
Sorry for the wait!
Harry decided that it was useless continuing to discuss. He locked is things in his trunk, took his wand and closed the curtains with a locking spell, and added a silencing spell for good measure.
Harry was startled out of his thoughts when he heard the Room give access to someone. He turned sharply towards the door. Draco was there, paler than ever and with a worried expression, his breath was ragged, as if he had run the entire way from the dungeons till there. He probably had.
One night Neville had even brought him a copy of a photograph of their parents together. Their mothers were sitting on an expensive sofa (it could belong in a manor), both wearing beaming twin smiles and holding two little babies with black hair, their fathers both standing behind them, hands firmly placed on their wives’ shoulders and both also smiling, eyes full of pride and happiness.
Harry frowned “I don’t want to go to Madam Pomfrey.”
“You… pregnancy? You fool boys! Draco you know very well how to prevent things like that from happening! I was the one that explained the spells to you in fourth year! How could you be stupid enough to forget them? You-”
“Potter. Can I ask about your muggle relatives?”
“How big do you think the baby is now?” Draco whispered, his fingers lightly trailing from Harry’s waist to his stomach.
“Dray-” Harry’s breath was ragged, his thoughts not coherent anymore. Only Draco had this power on him.
“Yes! This one-”
Harry was livid when he found out.
“What if you need help before the end of term? What if you start showing while we are still in school?” Draco’s voice was getting louder and louder with each remark.
Happy reading :)
Harry was starting to panic. Now you couldn’t tell the difference, but in a few months his stomach would start to grow… what was going to happen to his body? Did he even know how to take care of a baby? What would they do?
Harry nodded, but the other two were looking at them strangely.
He sighed and rubbed his face “I’m Draco’s godfather, of course I have been protective of him… so in the last two years I may have been more unfair than usual. I thought it would be just a phase, but I’m now realizing that Draco has been serious about this the whole time, and I was just blinded by my prejudice. I will help you two out with the pregnancy and devising a plan to go into hiding… we will have to be subtle and hide this from sides of the war. It will be hard and dangerous”.
And if Harry wanted to be truthful… other than Sirius, the only other adult that never tried to use him or lie to him ‘for his sake’, was Severus Snape.
“You’re not vaccinated?!” his voice raised in pitch.
“Do you trust him?”
Harry was shocked.
The mood instantly turned sombre as Remus nodded “I think so, but only in a small space or room with not many people, as the more people there are, the more difficult it is to distinguish smells”.
And once again the white light shot from his wand, creating a warm and soothing sensation around his stomach.
He hesitated before continuing.
, just like him. They ranted for months about the
“There are some things only a Healer can do, spells taught in medical texts we don’t have here at school.”
“We know it will be dangerous, but frankly, professor… I don’t think I want to keep fighting anymore, I lost too much and now that I have more to lose… I would not survive losing Draco or the baby. I don’t want to be a tool anymore, the only thing I ever wanted was just being Harry. And I am able to be that person only in front of Draco. I can’t keep the façade for much more.”
“He’s Draco’s godfather… and he trusts him, so I trust him. We had to tell him because we didn’t want to go to Madam Pomphrey, and he has enough medical knowledge to help us with the pregnancy and the baby.”
“Are you sure you did it correctly?” the professor asked.
Harry looked at him with confusion. Safe? What did he mean-
Harry took Draco’s hand in his and pressed it on his stomach “
They. Yes, because Draco was going to be there… right?
“Well, I can’t ask my parents, can’t I?” Harry snapped back.
Now it was Harry’s turn to frown “I don’t have any records other than a few injuries.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry went to his next class and the rest of his day was blissfully normal.
“He or she is not a blob” Harry scolded with a little smile tugging on his lips “And I’m almost 12 weeks”.
“Impossible. Your head of house should have a list of all the students with the full record of their health. Even if you were brought up with muggles, such things would have turned up during check-ups in first year.”
The professor studied him for a minute, pondering what to say.
“I don’t know. Maybe he wants to copy my potion’s homework?” Harry replied sarcastically.
“I know… I’m sorry” Harry was looking at his feet. He could not stand the piercing gaze of the other boy. “I felt that if I met your eyes, I would break down there in front of everyone” he whispered, his lips trembling.
Realization flickered in the other boy’s eyes, then he gulped “I will be in more trouble than you are, I’m the one that knocked you up.”
And if swallowing his pride and asking for help to the man who despised him ever since the day they met, was the only way to make sure his baby was safe… he would do it.
That was a conversation he really wanted to avoid. Being the one that got pregnant would give the professor enough hints about their sex life, and he really didn’t want him to know
Harry also stated to notice more changes in his body. His skin never looked better, and his moods were changing unpredictably. He was more conscious of every movement of his body, and during class he was always on high alert in case something went wrong with stray spells or pranks.
The adults headed to the door, not before giving a few more recommendations, some more congratulations, and a few more hugs.
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath. After a few moments he opened them again, emerald orbs piercing through the silver ones.
“I want to keep it” he said, trying to sound confident. “He or she… They deserve to have a chance. I want to try this”.
Harry sat in the Room of Requirement after having dinner in the Great Hall.
Well, to be more precise, after pretending to have dinner in the Great Hall. He was so nervous that he could only eat a few bites, even without taking into consideration the morning sickness.
“I’m sorry, but I’m just Harry, I can’t be who you expect me to be”.
“We created the baby together; we’ll also find a way out together. I am really scared about this, but I’ve known for a while that I want to spend the rest of my life with you, this only accelerates a bit my plan”.
He had confided in Sirius in fourth year, when he had started to doubt his sexuality and relationship with Draco. He was so confused at the time! The Dursleys had instilled in his brain that gays were the evil of the world, that they were abominations,
“We’re moving in together” the other man stated simply.
After thanking the professor once more, promising to be careful and arranging for a reason to get detentions to have an excuse to avoid flying and having more time to talk and think for solutions about the summer and next year, Harry once more hid under his cloak and headed out. Draco lingered for a few more minutes, whispering hurriedly with his godfather and finally hugging him before rushing out to catch up with his boyfriend.
. Thought Harry snidely.
“No. Harry, you don’t understand. Those vaccinations are mandatory for a reason. Some of those illnesses are deadly. The older you are when you get them, the more dangerous they are.”
Harry replied with a quick note telling Sirius he would see him Saturday morning, and they both headed to class as they both had DADA. They got to the classroom just in time and sat at their tables just as Professor Snape was entering the classroom. Ron, who was in the seat just ahead of Harry, in the Gryffindor side of the room, turned around and shot him a dirty look, but Harry shrugged and smiled to Neville, mouthing a ‘thanks’ for keeping him a seat.
“They want me to be part of your family” Draco was equally moved, his eyes shining with unshed tears.
“Draco. Breathe.” The professor lowered his wand and leaned back on his chair.
“You know there are ways around those. And asking for an Unbreakable to a stranger is unheard of!”
No one.
His beathing was quickening, his fingers tingling, the tell-tale signs of a full-blown panic attack, when a vial of clear blue liquid made his way in his trembling hands.
Harry tried to ignore the pang of hurt in his chest. Ron was his first friend in the Wizarding World and for years he had loved him like a brother. His rejection had hurt a lot in fourth year, and to be honest their friendship never recovered from then. Harry had hoped and tried for months to mend their relationship but as he grew up, he began to understand that Ron never really understood him on the same level as Harry understood him. Ron never understood what growing with the Dursleys did to him, he never understood the longing for family, love and belonging to a place. He never understood that money was not important, and fame was really not the list of things Harry ever wanted. He never understood what growing up believing that he would die before turning 18 would be like.
Both boys nodded and the professor once again raised his wand.
“I’m sorry, sir. We just wanted to be careful.” He shot a panicked look at Draco. He really didn’t want to be the one to break the news.
Katie cornered him after the meeting, asking if he was alright. Harry smiled and shrugged, telling her the half-truth that his sleep deprivation was taking a toll on his body anyway, and he would not have been able to play at his best anyway. She smiled sadly and hugged him tight, telling him it was alright, and he was forgiven. If she saw his eyes glinting with unshed tears, she pretended not to see anything.
Everything felt numb. It was like all feelings had left his body. He didn’t even realize he was now sitting on the cold floor of the sixth year Gryffindor boys’ bathroom, when he clearly remembered standing just a few minutes before. His hands were trembling, and his wand had fallen on the floor.
Draco, who was blushing madly at the beginning of his godfather’s rant, suddenly paled and looked at Harry with panicked eyes.
Draco’s head snapped up in alarm “Wait… so all werewolves can smell it? Greyback too?”
“I had stuff to do” he chose to reply shortly and headed quickly to the showers to avoid more questioning. He took his time under the water, basking in the warmth of the hot water splashing on his body. He tried to relax his body as much as possible, knowing that sleeping in the dorms was going to be hard for the next two days.
“They are not healers and Sirius is still on house arrest waiting for his trial.” Draco raised an eyebrow; he knew he was winning the argument.
Draco sighed and moved a strand of hair behind his ear. He kept it long to appease his father, but in reality, he despised the long hair and thought it was really uncomfortable.
Harry appreciated that the professor was not forcing for more details. He was giving Harry the power of controlling the pace of the conversation. It was something no other adult had aver done with him, not even Sirius.
Draco paled and widened his arms, shifting so that he was completely covering his boyfriend, he looked warily at the wand still pointed towards them and spoke quickly, voice trembling “Severus, I’m sorry. It’s not a prank. I swear. It’s not an emergency, but it is important. Very, very important. So important that no one can know Harry is here and this was the quickest way to get into your office, and-”
Ron avoided him, sitting with Hermione in every class and ignoring him during mealtimes in the Great Hall. Harry avoided him just as much, sitting with Neville in class and with either Luna, Neville or Katie in the Great Hall. The rest of his time was all dedicated to Draco in the Room of Requirement.
Draco nodded “Yes, we will not be returning to school next year… we need to find somewhere to go into hiding until it’s safe, or at least until the baby is born and Harry is no longer vulnerable.” He said.
Sirius smiled, but his eyes were also shining “So… we wanted to hear your opinion on where you would like to go, but we still haven’t told anyone our plan. Dumbledore thinks we want to take you on a holiday, which of course we will also have, but our priority is finding a house right now”.
“Merlin, you can’t imagine how much I missed you, pup” Sirius sighed in Harry’s hair.
They cuddled for a little more before deciding to go to breakfast and after that they would go to ask for help with an adult. During this time Harry asked himself more than once what was happening with his life.
“Which goes super well with our plan to buy a house!” Sirius exclaimed, thrusting his hands in the air.
“We could wait for one more month and ask Sirius and Remus for help after the end of term.” Harry tried to find a way out, his voice desperate.
They continue to work in silence at their respective works, until the end of the detention. Before letting him go, the professor told him he would look into hiding places and asked if he would be alright to hide amongst muggles.
The professor grumbled something about ‘hormonal teenagers’.
“I… uh… we… we are going to have to go into hiding”.
(See the end of the chapter for
In the end they decided to drop all the options in the city and were left with two houses that were quite isolated in the countryside, with a wide space for both the wards and a big space around the house to fly, play and enjoy some freedom, since they were going to spend quite a bit of time coped up inside.
Harry’s friends actually dared to say he was a spy sent by Voldemort. They had spent the rest of the summer throwing insults at each other, and Harry, for the first time since he had become Draco’s friend had defended the boy against his own friends. They were quick to insult him too.
“In the muggle world it is. But with the right potions, the baby will have no permanent damage even if it is born early. But this does not erase the fact that male pregnancies are more difficult at a greater risk than their female counterparts. You will have to be more careful. No apparition for the whole duration of the pregnancy and as soon as you start showing, flying, portkeyes and flooing are not recommended if not for emergency reasons. Once you hit the third trimester, any method of wizarding transport shall be forbidden”.
“We need to come up with a plan for the future, then.”
The door of Professor’s Snape office opened as soon as Draco’s hand had left the dark wood of the door. Harry was still under the invisibility cloak, and he tried to make his steps as light as possible following inside the room, his fingers tightly locked on the end of Draco’s school robe.
Harry nodded “I was worried about that part”.
Harry was awake but his eyes were still closed, his breathing was slow, his chest slowly rising. He kept a hand under the pillow and another on Draco’s waist, fingers lightly gripping his shirt and betraying his anxiety in the apparent relax of the lazy morning scene they were in.
“Oh God. I’m already terrible at this, aren’t I?” Harry panicked “We- I don’t know anything about babies, I don’t know anything about pregnancy even for women, what is like for men? I should be worried about the baby and here I am, horny as hell-”
It was only a few months until they would be both of age, and able to be independent. But at the moment they were still both underage. It was too risky to let others know of it, even if it was only a possibility.
“Oh boys… it’s really the worst timing” the man groaned.
“My baby is having a baby” Sirius sobbed “He’s all grown up” and he proceeded to hug both boys with a death grip.
. We want the both of you to be safe, and with Draco’s family and Voldemort situation, it’s given that anywhere you go you will have to be heavily guarded. It’s just… I can’t give Dumbledore anymore chances with your safety.”
He took a deep breath and stopped in front of the dark wooden door of the office. Draco hesitated for a few seconds, and looked in his direction, waiting for confirmation. Harry grabbed his hand, and gave a light squeeze.
“You were with
They had a big fight in the common room and ever since the ‘Draco is a Death Eater’ topic was dropped, but their relationship had become strained. He knew they were still whispering about the topic behind his back. Harry really could not find it in himself to trust them as much as before. At least, not until they proved to grow up a little and stop being bigoted.
And Harry always joked that the ‘Random Moring Checks’ were created because of them. The potions master was suspicious whenever he saw them together, and after fourth year he had become a real thorn in their side, always trying to keep them apart.
The professor seemed startled by the sudden declaration, and awkwardly coughed. “Potter. I don’t hate you. Sure, I never liked you either, given my history with your father, but you have to realize that the main reason why I behave the way I do in classroom is because of my involvement as a spy. The school is full of Death Eater’s children ready to report to their parents of anything I do.”
After finding out he was pregnant, Harry tried hard to put on a façade with his friends for the whole day.
in their house”.
“I won’t show that soon” Harry replied weakly.
“What do you want to do?” Draco accompanied Harry to the bed, where they sat on the edge. He kissed the tears on Harry’s cheeks and then looked in his eyes with a serious expression “No matter what you choose, I will be there with you”.
Ron and Ginny were easily influenced by their mother’s view of the world. Especially Ron, he was jealous and judgmental, he was used to judge people, and Slytherins in particular, depending on the colour of their tie. What would he do if he found out that his best friend was gay? It would be for sure a repeat of what happened in fourth year. Harry knew this was not how friendships worked, but Ron and the Weasleys were the only ‘family’ he had other than Sirius.
The pregnancy was getting very real, very quickly.
“You mean it?”
Harry nodded “They never liked me for what I was. I grew up thinking I was a freak” he shook his head, as if to get rid of the bad memories “I don’t want Draco to see that”.
Harry scoffed “Please, Sirius loves you, but I’m not talking about the baby, I’m talking about the fact that I have to go into hiding as soon as he is free… looks like we are not destined to live together… he will be so disappointed” his voice broke on the last sentence.
Draco grimaced “Blob?”
Harry chuckled “Remus… before… you said I smelled different. Did you smell the baby?”
“Brat” Draco smiled fondly “No, seriously. I’ve been thinking that maybe we should ask those questions to someone… and have you checked up. I want to make sure you’re okay. Both of you.”
There was only one word to describe Harry’s feelings now.
“Why?”
His past insecurities and doubts risked resurfacing like a tsunami. Would Draco want to keep the baby? Would he hate Harry because he was blowing all of their plans? Would he still like Harry after this? Would he want to
need that support right now”.
Harry shifted to look at his boyfriend, eyes glinting “I’m not vulnerable” he grumbled.
“Women usually start showing between 12 and 16 weeks, depending on their body type. Males usually start showing earlier, due to the lack of space for the foetus to grow, and you are on the thinner side, so you could be showing anytime now.”
Once was enough.
“I guess from your tone that it is a matter of great importance. Dragon, I don’t trust your judgment when it comes to Potter, but I do care about you and trust you enough to help fix whatever it is that you two managed to mess up. Will a magical oath do?”
The two teenagers both released a sigh of relief.
Draco leaned forward, and reached for the other’s hands, slowly rubbing circles on his palms. “We don’t know that. You could be more far along than we think of.”
They talked about their options both with Snape and by themselves and the best option seemed to find a safehouse somewhere in the muggle world, away from both sides of the war. The only problem was… where? While in school they certainly could not go house hunting, and Snape was already split between detentions, lessons, and his spy work for the Dark Lord. The professor had suggested to involve Gringotts and the goblins in the purchase as it would assure them some anonymity, but the problem of getting to the bank was still there.
Draco picked up the pace and started moving his hand together with his mouth, taking as much as he could of his length.
No one was going to touch their baby.
Harry nodded “What about..?” and he waved awkwardly in the direction of his stomach.
The professor stopped in the middle of his rant, he closed his eyes and pinched the space between them. He sighed.
Harry bit his lower lip and looked at the two men that he considered as good as fathers, Remus nodded encouragedly and this reassured him that whatever happened, they would support him.
“Professor… I never had check-ups like that. I don’t even know what vaccinations I got as a baby.”
Then, Draco patiently explained the history and the reasons behind the gene, and how the test worked. They passed the rest of the evening reading through every book Draco brought from the Library. All the symptoms were explained, and the papers were clear: Harry could be pregnant.
In reality Harry knew, Severus Snape was not a bad person. He was only a bad teacher and very,
And with that Remus succeeded in pushing Sirius out of the building, a few seconds, and a sound of apparition later, the two teens knew they were left alone.
“Draco, I remember telling you to use that pattern only in case of emergency. Emergency as in imminent death or-” the professor squinted for a second and slowly raised is wand.
“We found out yesterday. I… Severus… I remembered the spells.” Draco was blushing furiously “I always used them on me, because I knew of the possibility… But I never thought to ask Harry. I thought that being a half-blood it would not be possible, and that in the future I would be the one carrying.”
Draco suddenly leaped and hugged Harry with all his might “No, I’m the one who is sorry. I should have been there… Merlin. You must have panicked all day on your own”.
“Now, let’s be honest. Potter, your school record has only the injuries you sustained after your stupid Gryffindor acts. There is no record of health checks in first year, and no sign of either vaccinations or blood tests.” He sighed and looked at a few of the parchments with weird look before continuing “This could be blamed on simple neglect to remember that you grew up with muggles, or could be intentional. I still can’t understand which of the two it is… but I will need to take your blood and see what we can do about the vaccinations.”
Harry suddenly realized that while he was egoistically thinking of himself and avoiding everyone today, Draco must have gone crazy with worry. He felt a pang in his heart for the other boy. He stood from where he was sitting on the couch and made his way towards his lover.
For Harry it was home.
Saturday morning, before breakfast Harry was a nervous wreck. He was so worked up that he could barely swallow his tea, his food was left untouched.
Harry slowly returned to the dorms and found Ron sitting on his bed, waiting for him.
Pregnant. That was the result. And harry didn’t even know it was possible for boys to get pregnant until the day before, when he had confided his symptoms with his lover and they had tried to get some answers.
He had become almost addicted to the Room. He returned to the Gryffindor dormitory only in the mornings, to pretend to wake up and go to breakfast with Ron. But in reality, he only slept in the Room. Draco had to be more careful, so he dared to sleep there only for a few days after the ‘Random Moring Checks’ by Snape, when he was sure he would not be caught.
“Like you? You mean as a wizard?”
“You… know?”
“Ewwww” Draco grimaced and pushed Harry so that they were both laying on the bed in a comfortable position, his hand still pressed on the other boy’s stomach.
Someone should have probably taken a photo of Professors’ Snape reaction after that question. His eyes widened and his face became as pale as inhumanly possible, his mouth slightly open in shock. The surprise lasted only a few seconds, before anger took over.
Draco cleared his voice and took Harry’s hand in his.
If Professor Snape was surprised by his godson’s speech, he certainly did not show it. He pondered the teenagers’ words in silence for a few minutes, without ever losing eye contact, before he replied.
“Mhhh” Harry slurred, his eyes closed. “I love you”.
. That would grow and become a real person. A
“Why, thank you for the compliment, Potter”. The professor’s face was impassable, but for the first time in forever, his tone when talking to Harry was not condescending.
Yep. Definitely pregnant.
Then he knocked 5 times on the door, using a unique pattern.
They all laughed and started looking at the houses described in the papers, some also had photographs included, and Harry could not help but trying to imagine his life with his family in each one of them.
He couldn’t believe it. It couldn’t be right. But he had done the spell five times and each time delivered the same result: that damned white light.
The siler-eyed boy mouthed a ‘thank you’ to his godfather, who had made himself comfortable on a sofa across from them. Harry was leaning heavily on Draco, while the latter slowly stoked his hair. “It’s okay. Take your time” he whispered soothingly “we can talk about that later”.
He slept in the dorms only a few times and spent the rest of his nights in the Room of Requirement. Draco would be there with him most of the time too, as Snape now promised to warn him every time the Slytherin dorms would be checked. Every morning the Room would provide a huge mirror on the wall next to the bed, and Harry would raise his shirt and turn right, then left, then right again, looking for any sign of swelling, for a sign that the baby was really there.
Harry read the letter with a wide grin; Sirius was free! And he wanted to live together… which was his dream until a few weeks before. His smile faltered at the thought of how disappointed Sirius would be when he found out his summer plans were not going to work for them.
FLASHBACK –
“No. Please tell me you are not suggesting
Sirius frowned “Yes, we know”.
“Dray-” he panted “Harder”
Harry’s eyes softened “I know, it was only panic and a lot of insecurity coming back at me”.
A decision is made.
“I have been thinking”.
Draco sighed in relief, and finally relaxed his grip on Harry’s hand. The boys looked briefly at each other and after Harry’s subtle nod, Draco finally spoke.
If possible, Draco was even paler than before “I thought so… you avoided me all day”. His tone was not accusing, but hurt. His eyes flashed brightly.
Harry’s hand gripped the blonde’s hair.
I'm finally done with exams for my Master's Degree, so I will be able to post more regularly from now on :)
house, you once told me you would do your best to be what my father never was for me. I need that. No,
Draco kissed his cheek and sighed “I know you aren’t. But the baby is. He or she is so small, they still can’t defend themselves… you have to take care of your body to protect them.” Then Draco turned to speak once again with his godfather “which is another reason why we need your help. We don’t trust Madame Pomphrey to keep this a secret from Dumbledore and we don’t trust the headmaster. You are the only adult in the castle that I trust, and you have enough medical knowledge to be a Medi-healer.… ”
"Maybe," Hermione said. She worried her bottom lip with her teeth.
"I hope you get help soon for whatever is going on with your eyebrows right now," Harry said. "It's all fine, turns out I have a lot of stuff, and my house is bigger than I thought."
Harry gave hugs to everyone, even to a bemused Arthur, who patted his head. He kissed Hermione’s cheek and teased her about avoiding the wine (out of earshot of Molly, of course). Apparently, the matter of a sibling for Rose was settled. But all Hermione wanted to talk about was new legislation with him and Percy.
"I’m sensing a ‘but’…" Lee said.
"That part I gathered from observation," Harry said.
He wants to reach out and doesn’t know how. Not when he was the one to reject Harry, to distance himself.
Now, Harry would never be lacking. Draco touched him all the time, more than anyone he'd known. In small ways, like it was natural to hook an ankle around his when they ate together, to put his cold fingers in the holes in his old clothes to remind him to throw them out, to rest a hand lightly on his shoulder to manoeuvre around him, although now the kitchen had enough room to pass without being that close.
Draco’s chin falls a bit at Luna’s words. Since his and Harry’s outing in the
Luc made a gesture of surrender, both palms facing Harry.
With a loud pop, the portrait disappeared into the wall.
Pansy turns off the telly and plops down by his side, almost sitting on his feet before he curls even more into the couch. Maybe he’s becoming one with the furniture. That’s a reassuring thought.
"That’s not true," Harry protested. Simon had been nice. Boring as fuck, and they had lasted two months before Harry stopped Owling him, but nice enough.
Elle shifts her gaze from one to the other, eying Draco carefully, as if expecting any adverse reaction. Draco’s not entirely sure from whom.
“You should.”
How Harry—
But everything he says is true.
And so, Draco works. He distracts himself from the fact that his husband doesn’t remember their story, and doesn't want to see him. At least he knows he is close to Harry in a way; the magic pulling them together is warm and constant. He will be there, if Harry remembers everything suddenly or if he wishes to see Draco.
Draco nodded, his expression thoughtful. "I understand that. Being busy helps. I can’t remember the last time I went more than a week without a work project."
Maybe his friends have been right all along. Draco didn’t take the time to grieve the loss of Harry, or his mother, now Harry again. He’s glad he didn’t, though, because it’d be just
Draco raises an eyebrow, deciding it’s best to wait for him to get it out instead of pushing Harry like he sometimes did in the past. This Harry is scared more easily.
"No one is trying to trick me, Mills," Harry said. "I was just curious."
“What about you, Harry?” Draco’s fingers close around Harry’s nape, keeping him in place.
“I like it here,” Draco says faintly.
"Gwen, how are you? And your wife and kids?" Harry asked. Eugenia and Carlota were in their fourth year at Hogwarts. They had long since graduated from poking their heads into rooms he was in and giggling.
Draco is deep in his books a couple of weeks later before Pansy and Luna once again drag him out of his office for a coffee break.
"I…I’m sorry. I just don't want it in the house, even with the names on it," Harry admitted.
“I’m not opposed to that.” Your whisper in my ear made a shiver run down my spine.
Oxygen crashes in with a deep breath. A clank echoes in the bedroom when his wand drops to the ground. His hand is still burning though, where it’d touched the wood.
"It’s a very crude form of sympathetic magic, but we don’t have years here," Draco said.
"Watching people divide a bill makes me ill," Miles said.
"How do you want to…?" But Harry was already reaching between them to jerk him off too. Draco's eyes were half closed like he had been the one to orgasm, and he Summoned some lube to Harry's hand with a twitch of his finger.
"Greg's quiet now, I noticed," Harry said instead.
I turned around, taking a step back. You didn’t push closer.
Maybe Harry followed the same reasoning as he did. If no one knows about their not-date, they’ll be able to pretend it never happened if this doesn’t work out.
near them. The man can’t tell a jinx from a hex.”
"I’ll see you."
"Any closer to a working prototype of the Weasley clock, Ronald?" Draco asked. His pasta, at least, looked edible and Harry eyed his plate with envy. Ron looked surprised to be asked anything first before launching into a brief explanation.
“Fuck you,” Draco snaps, shaking his head aggressively. “Don’t finish that sentence.”
"Yeah, yeah, let’s see you do that after flying a full match," Harry said.
Harry.
"Don’t you—" Harry began.
He looked around the sleek room, with its glass doors, ferns, and abstract splashes of red. There had been a controversy when she first moved in here that her office was offensively Muggle and ruining the character of Diagon Alley, which Harry became aware of about five years ago when a
Draco can’t lose him again. But
He rushes there now, though, the blundering steps taking him to the door he’s kept closed since he lost everything.
“Or the worst,” Harry snorts, rolling his eyes. He continues, shifting on the mattress, making his thigh almost rub against Draco’s. “How did you know the bond would work?”
Harry hugs him with promises of “I’m here, babe” and “It’s okay,” while holding his shaking body. Harry doesn’t say he’s not going anywhere and Draco doesn’t ask him to. They’re both too terrified of the truth to acknowledge it, it seems.
"And a very complicated one."
Draco carries him back, and Harry only seems able to walk by himself again when they’re far from the forest. All the way back, only one thought floods Draco’s head… Why does Harry, of all people, have to go through that after everything he’s already sacrificed?
He chances the first step towards the beach, figuring it might be better to be there than in the cabin in the middle of the sea, though neither option seems auspicious.
will never give him what he needs. It will never be for him what he hoped, but Draco can still fight, and try. He may not be able to save himself, but he’ll do everything he can to save Harry and Elle Carrey.
"When did you start thinking of us together?" Harry wondered aloud.
“Yes, you did.”
Draco chances a glance at Potter, but the man’s expression is indecipherable. His magic sparks, and like a magnet, it calls to Draco’s.
“Harry.
Draco nods again, clasping his fingers tighter at the distant look on Harry’s face. “Yes. You did. Saved me from a trip to Azkaban, so... thank you for that.” Again.
lodges inside him and it leaves a bittersweet taste in his tongue. He needs to know.
Draco approaches Harry slowly, wondering if he’s hearing things, but Harry looks directly at him. “What did you lose, love?”
again.
“Yes.” Harry nods, and then flinches. “I mean. Not here. Outside it is… You shouldn’t see the same as I do, though. What do you see?”
It’s not, however, and he manages not to destroy everything he owns. He’s not repairing his room again or buying any new plates and mugs because of his destructive behavior. He goes to work, and treats Elle and his other patients with sepulchral silence, yes, but as a good healer.
Harry snorts. “You mean, the almost-kiss?”
"You mean, is the DMLE happy our petition cut their budget for five years running? Absolutely not," Hermione said.
Marvin probably sees it in his face, because Draco is blessed with another one of his reassuring smiles before the man is turning his head to the door.
"Shut it, Harry. I can ask at least. This is the closest you’ve come to a romantic prospect in a year."
But Mother smiles at him, the soft curve of her lips almost imperceptible. Her eyes sparkle with unshed tears and Draco falls into her arms.
He needed help.
It doesn’t matter, because Harry is here, holding Draco. There’s hope, there’s life again. Draco will find a solution for Harry’s curse, and things will be alright. Everything will be fine.
“What?”
Then she turned to Harry as if she had seen him in the doorway all along. "You will not fucking believe what happened. Remember how I told you about that Healer intern who was the daughter of that fucker who owns the Arrows?"
And then, Harry’s fingers are curling near the hair at the nape of his neck, his breath is hot against Draco’s cheek. Harry’s body is pressing against his and his magic is
Draco looked as though he had wandered out of a library and found himself at Harry’s front step. Harry had seen many society page spreads where Draco wore sharp, fitted designer Muggle suits and dress robes, so this must be his work attire. It seemed inappropriate.
Potter shouldn’t matter. Draco was here first. These people know him better than anyone, even though they don’t know the whole truth about his past. But he’s better, and Potter will see that.
Sirius also kept lists. Not a journal per se; all loose. But there were lists of things to teach Harry, things to tell Moony, the Quidditch rankings. He favoured Puddlemere.
During the fifth day, they both realised that nothing  that they tried made Harry remember his past.
"Miles doesn’t think when he speaks and never has. I feel about him the way I imagine some people feel about their older brothers," Draco said, gesturing so emphatically, it showed true annoyance.
He’s lost Elle, he remembers, getting up from the floor where he, apparently, had fainted. His whole body aches, his throat is sore and his eyes are stinging and swollen.
“Go ahead,” Draco says when Harry just keeps staring at him in silence.
Molly was so overjoyed I was going. She called upon generations of Weasleys to descend on the place for lunch. It ended up being only a few of her offsprings and in-laws — Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Bill, Fleur and Victoire, Percy and Oliver, even Andromeda and Teddy showed up — but it was too much for me.
"Fine, then I need personal care and attention," Harry said. Draco pulled at him to sit upright and then stand. Harry was shameless in letting his weight rest on Draco heavily, and they swayed a little as Draco tried to compensate.
Harry gave Draco one steady, heated look.
Harry was asked to present an award for the Junior Leagues. Ginny found him before the ceremony. She wore an emerald gown slit up to the thigh that must have employed the use of several sticking charms.
"Cake for breakfast?" Draco said, incredulous. "Do I want cake for breakfast?" But something in his expression betrayed absolute delight even though his tone was sharp.
, he thought. Breathing, yes, but just a shell, devoid of anything that made him the person Draco fell in love with. He had cried and yelled and called Harry back—
"Captain!" came a familiar voice from behind him as he entered the locker room. Stella Abidi, the centre Chaser, was grinning widely, already laced into her Quidditch leathers.
"Just like the pictures on your desk?" Draco smiled and nodded.
Billion was a problem that Draco could not solve, but Draco could solve his whole role in the equation.
"I don't remember that." Draco smiled and stood.
Draco looked like he had been caught off guard by Harry's question. He nodded but didn't smile. "Does Molly still invite you over for get togethers? I mean, knowing that Ginny will be there."
The bed caught Harry sending the dark grey sheets spiralling up around him. The redhead climbed on top and began kissing down his neck. Harry raked his hands over the soft jumper the other man was wearing, relishing in its familiarity.
The smile soon vanished and was replaced by a calculating look. Harry remembered his comment about not smiling and felt a pang of guilt stab at his heart.
Draco sat silent for a few moments, then he suddenly stood. "What are you doing?" Harry asked. The blonde didn't respond, merely walked towards Harry and lightly pressed his lips to his.
"I like my hand-written notes better I guess." He then paused and looked over Harry, he was in his Auror robes, underneath he wore black slacks and a white button-down, everything was slightly wrinkled.
"Which do you think?" Draco narrowed his eyes at the man.
His hair was left loose again and was slightly damp. He had a cup of tea sitting by his elbow on the end table nearest to him, his notepad was open and ready for notes in his lap, and he held his pen delicately between two long, boney fingers. Harry searched for his wedding band, and low and behold, there it was, sitting proudly on his ring-finger.
"No, I couldn't just keep a secret, because I know that keeping secrets that big can lead to a marriage failing and that's the last thing I want." Draco closed his notepad and stood.
"Voldemort killed your parents because they stood in the way of you. Killing you was his primary goal. I believe a prophecy foretold you defecting him."
"But when they got there they noticed you weren't there, but it was too already too late, they had caused a ruckus so they killed them just to keep their mouths closed."
I was asked to put notes in when Harry was with Billion so I would like to warn of that now. There is only mention of them being together but still, it's there! Also, we're going to be focusing a little more on Draco for a few chapters!
He could remember the boy crying while ripping his sleeve up to show Dumbledore his Dark Mark.
Draco considered this for a few seconds, "I think you're afraid that now that you're not tied down, a little fun might turn into something you don't want. A relationship perhaps."
"So on October 30th, he came and tried to kill you, only Lily's love for you protected you in the end, instead of 'killing' Voldemort. When the Wizarding World got news of this, they believed your Godfather was responsible, so they threw him in Azkaban."
As always, much love and happy reading from your fellow Drarry lover,
"Perhaps, if you wanted of course." Ron sat on the side of the bed and laced his trainers up. Then he stood and walked over to Harry's side of the bed and sat at his feet.
"So, you... had a romantic affair... with a 17-year-old?" Harry nodded and watched Draco's face, Draco sat silent for a long time, "What would you like me to do with this information?"
She smiles and tries to get away from him, but Dracos' already picked her up and is tickling. She screamed, and maybe they shouldn't be this loud in a hospital room, but it's beautiful.
Harry huffed and took up looking over Draco. His once pointy almost crass features had softened out, leaving him looking more aristocratic-looking than anything. Today he wore a tailored grey and blacked striped two-piece. He wore a black button-down under his blazer, and he had a neat grey tie strung around his neck.
Oh, he really hated Harry Potter for making him love him so.
When he finally got everyone's screams a little quieter, he dozed off and dreamt of Billion and the sweet, sweet relief tomorrow would bring.
“Thank you,” Draco says, not stepping out of Marvin’s embrace by sheer force of will. He’s never been one to avoid contact, and he doesn’t know why this feels weird now.
"Does it?" Harry said as Hermione snapped, "Ronald!"
This time, though, he’s more at ease when he opens the envelope and stares at Teddy’s message as guilt tugs his insides for having conveniently hidden himself the last time his cousin had been to London.
Harry left for home less than a half hour later.
"The house needs your personal care and attention," Harry said. They were sprawled on the carpet in the study, but Harry hadn’t played any records.
They rest on the beach, fingers laced together, thighs pressing against one another as the waves smoothly wash the sand by their feet and the other shapeless shadows saunter unaware of their presence.
I willed myself
Draco contemplated this.
"It’s not a big deal," Oliver insisted. "But I am…he has to meet them. It’s not like we could get married if he doesn’t…" Oliver trailed off, lapsing into thoughtful silence. "Fuck."
"It is. Jim Lisley, the founder, had been working miracles long before I got involved. He bought wands out of his own pocket for kids who had theirs confiscated by their parents. He tutored teens in their A-Levels. He even went around to local shops to find jobs for anyone who wanted to start working. I’m so glad that SafeHome has more resources now. They have mental health counselling, outreach workers, and drop-in centres. I’m very proud."
, Draco thinks, locking their lips together. His are trembling and weak against Harry’s, but he can’t begin to care about his display of vulnerability.
By the time they got to flying drills, the only thing keeping Harry awake was the knowledge that falling fifty feet hurt quite a lot, and he wasn’t keen on starting the season on the bench. When the final whistle blew, they all dropped to the pitch with relief. The first few days were always brutal.
"For work?" Harry asked. He caught a glimpse of architectural drawings of more manor-style homes.
"Good grip on you, although I expect it comes with the territory," Thaddeus said.
?, left unsaid.
, a tiny voice whispers in his head. Draco ignores it, because
"I never celebrate New Year’s," Harry admitted. "Usually, I stay in with Teddy, but they are going to visit Andromeda’s friend Cordelia in Berlin."
Harry lets the girls down, who shriek when he says, “We can have both.”
grinning at him, he can’t really care.
"Where's my baby?" Ron said. He peered around the hedges, giving her time to run away.
After a few days—weeks? Draco’s not sure anymore—Harry stops responding. His eyes are becoming increasingly distant with each passing hour in this dreary place.
The bond has been silent, a distant whistle Draco’s learnt to ignore the past few weeks. Now, though, it screams in his ears, makes his chest tighten, his fingers twitch. He can’t touch Harry. He can’t! And the bond will have to learn it the hard way.
It wasn't a question but Harry breathed, "Yes. Yes, if you want." God, Draco must be a devastating fuck with that mouth on him.
Draco doesn’t notice he’s shivering from cold, from fear, until he reaches out a hand and grabs Harry’s warm fingers, prodding them out of their hidden spot.
It turned out that Draco knew quite a lot about satellites. When Andromeda called them for dinner, Harry had drifted into a half sleep. Teddy raced downstairs.
, he doesn’t breathe. He’s dead.
“I’m sorry I vanished like that, but I… I can’t be in crowded spaces.” And after that, everything else spilled out like water running down on a waterfall. I talked about how the noise hurt me, how I was detached from everyone, how people sucked my energy, how hard it was for me having to deal with physical contact, how I was broken since the war and had no way of fixing it. I wasn’t the same Harry they were familiar with. I wasn’t normal.
“Draco,” she says.
"Falcons?" she said in a half-shout.
Harry had thought the little narrow path in the bare back garden was the only green space in the house. Now there was this little wild, lush patch of land heavily scented with citrus and honeysuckle and full to the brim with small bushes he didn’t recognise from Hogwarts or gardening as a kid. He was going to have to call Neville to check out the plants. The garden wasn’t big enough to fly in, but he loved it. Harry left it off the list for removal for Draco, which included the garage for flying carpets, the ballroom, the third parlour, and the galley for house-elves.
Draco knows she and Harry had been good friends during his time in college. His grin falls when he remembers the truth of why he hasn't contacted any of Harry’s Muggle friends. Draco couldn’t really be with them knowing an important part of their little group was missing.
But Padma and Seamus swept in before Harry could resume his interrogation.
The music was loud, pulsating, but not deafening, the hum buzzing in our bodies at a smooth pace. They kept the ambience darker, blue and purple light filtered by the few bubbles here and there. There were upholstered grey chairs and private tables scattered around the space, but most of the people were in the center of the room, dancing.
Draco gestured, and Harry reached out and grabbed a tiny bit of magic Draco siphoned out from the wall. It felt thin, brittle, and knotted like a strand of hair, so Harry tried to unpick the tie. It dissipated in his hands.
Mia tilts her head to the side, murmuring, “That’s rough, mate.”
"Blake is a talented Chaser and was our number one choice. But like all of us, she's here to play because she works hard and loves the game."
Draco’s not supposed to be so late, but since he’s already here, he doesn’t really need to reply to Harry’s text. That’s a relief. Learning to use the damned phone has been proving somewhat grueling, and he’s glad he doesn’t have to type with  those tiny buttons again. He’s so exhausted right now that the prospect is nerve-racking.
Harry averts his gaze back to his coffee and takes a deep breath. “I’m recovering fine, all things considered,” he states in a monotone, nothing like the words full of emotion and doubt from seconds before. “I exercise at least three hours a day, it helps control my body and my magic. I have to eat healthy or my stomach won’t be happy. And although I can’t sleep most nights, Sleeping Draughts don’t react well with my curse.” Harry lists these things as if he’s talking to his healer, but in a way, Draco is exactly that. He doesn’t mind if that’s how Harry feels most comfortable talking. At least Harry isn’t shooting daggers at him.
"We could have done one-on-one, Keeper and Chaser," Draco said as if he was accusing him of crimes against humanity.
They lounge quietly on the couch, watching yet another reprise of Notting Hill on the telly, with two dishes of spaghetti au pesto on their laps—Harry’s insistence, or they’d miss the film and apparently he likes it a lot. Draco doesn’t mind too much, mostly because Harry’s warmth by his side is solid and comforting, and his laughter is the most beautiful melody Draco’s ever heard.
Harry takes a few months to travel around the world. This time, however, Draco takes time off from work and joins him.
I hadn’t realised before how you needed PRTND as much as I did. As we laid on my bed that night, naked and sweaty, too terrified to touch each other but unable to keep the distance, I knew why you felt like hiding.
Draco stares at the open door of the train car, takes one deep airless breath, and boards it.
Harry waits for the end of Draco’s shift, and they get coffee that night. Draco tells him how Harry used to only drink tea, how he hated coffee and wanted to chide Draco for drinking it, even though now he can’t bear the smell of tea.
He looks embarrassed, and Draco doesn’t quite know why Harry is apologising for it. He can’t even contain his own grin at the possibility of Harry liking their old song.
Draco takes a deep breath and goes inside.
“No, Draco, this isn’t! Merlin… Draco, I can’t believe you just… undermined my position like that.” A heavy gust of air leaves her mouth. Pansy drags a hand through her hair, pulling at it. “
Whether it be from the lack of sleep, or the way the hushed confession sounds in the middle of the night—rushed and like a
"You would for illegal trading of magical artefacts. Ask Hermione, if you like. The Wizengamot isn’t likely to go easy on the people who made money stealing Harry Potter’s birthright, but we can call the Aurors if that’s what you want. Some of them are even your friends’ families."
. Harry calls her Pansy, but he can’t call Draco by his first name.
Draco’s grin turns brighter, larger. “It’s ours,” he confesses in a whisper.
“It’s not real, it’s escapism. And it’s addictive, I'm talking from experience.” You fixed your stare on a loose brick on the floor, freeing your fingers.
Draco takes so long to answer, Harry is already shaking his head and gesturing an apology with his hands.
When Harry expressed concern over the length of the project, Draco said "it all depends," and continued explaining what was needed.
"Aren’t I?" Harry muttered. But he tried to relax his shoulders and let his brow smooth. He was warm and uncomfortable with everyone watching him.
“Shut up Potter.” But he kept on talking.
Draco’s smile is strained when he points at his booth. “I’m with a friend.”
Draco swallowed hard once before turning away. "Ridiculous," Draco muttered.
"Of course," Harry echoed incredulously. He played Quidditch, and Draco Malfoy spoke to houses. The whole concept of magic seemed patently absurd sometimes.
Harry tips his head to the side, staring intently at Draco. “They said you are the one who cured me.” He doesn’t say it with all the words, but Draco is sure Harry knows he died for him.
The memory of that blankness and quietness makes him shiver.
"They’re all from Hogwarts. You know all of them," Draco said with a flourish of his hand. Harry did not, but he nodded anyway. Millicent took pity on him. At least he could talk to her all night if all else failed. He never saw this side of her as his solicitor. For the most part, he saw her in a suit with her hair pinned up while she pored through his contracts. He liked the striped short sleeve, the bowtie, her hair messily parted to one side. She looked far more comfortable.
"You’re familiar with the concept of food, I trust," Draco said flatly. He grabbed a piece of toast. Now that Harry got a good look at him, Draco was a little less of everything than usual. He hadn’t slept well or at all from the smudging below his eyes, he wasn’t wearing any jewellery at all, and his outfit was boring, plain black trousers and a starched white shirt.
“I don’t want to give you one,” Harry assents slowly, hands closing around Draco’s fingers on his chest.
When he leaves her room, Elle falls back in a deep, restful slumber, watched by the same mediwitch that had accompanied him during the procedure. Draco leaves strict directions about her potions and instructions to call for him if anything,
"Sometimes I wish…" Harry trailed off, not sure how to articulate how he felt knowing her attention was on him, but she was also watching Luna as she bent and picked up Victoire.
Blaise’s and Luna are the exception, as they’re vigorously discussing whether Draco’s and Harry’s flat is infested with Wrackspurts. Draco’s sure Blaise’s participation in the conversation is happening only to indulge Luna—he can never say no to pretty girls.
They don’t stick around for long after they have dinner. Once they’re all lazily sprawled on the couch and floor, they soon realise no more work will be done and make themselves scarce. Luna and Pansy kiss each of their cheeks, Blaise gives them a hug, and Granger is carrying too many borrowed books—half in her arms and half filling up her handbag—looking too disturbingly frazzled to be concerned about goodbyes.
“Are you okay?”
” And as if to prove her point, she lifts her arms trying to reach for the sky, opens and closes her hands several times. “I can
Harry stiffens, his voice sounds tight, “Then I had to go back to England.”
It was not the last time Harry said something that he regretted, if only because it was repeated thousands of times back at him.
Luna delves into a recount of her latest, most ridiculous case—a child who had somehow swallowed his magical mermaid figurine. And now every time he burped, he ended up vomiting water and fishes. Draco laughs despite himself, getting lost in Luna’s soft tone.
"Thanks Bletchley," Gemma said, pressing a kiss to his cheek, which Miles bore with good humour, waving her off.
song—wraps them both in warmth. The violin’s notes, warm and serene, spread between them, charging up the room.
He doesn’t let her finish. “Please, don’t tell me to go back home. This
anyone, and to be recognised by anyone.
In the end, he goes with, “I just thought it was past the time to say hello.”
Draco’s moved to his third box when he fishes a cookbook from it and his stomach rumbles loudly at the sight of a plate with beef on the cover. It’s probably time for lunch, he considers, glancing at the window. The absence of curtains lets the strong sunlight bleed into the room, bathing it in heat despite three cooling charms.
The minutes pass by in suppressed silence until the screen finally lights up.
"I'm accommodating, as I said," Harry said, and Draco let out a little huff of breath that might have been laughter. Harry stepped back for one more slow, appraising look. Draco looked away. Harry wanted him. A belly burning, potent feeling he hadn’t had in a while before him. Want. Want. Want.
Draco is still replaying their conversation in Serendipity when Pansy and Blaise come to lunch three days later.
He gets to be with Harry, who loves him. His and Mother’s tentative truce is turning into a nurturing and healed relationship a bit more at each letter and meeting. He has good friends and a bigger family than he’d ever hoped for. Draco’s still astounded by the fact that the Weasleys have welcomed him into their house with no less warmth than they have Harry.
"It doesn’t have to stay the same. I want…I want to put up some photos he has. And I think I’ll take some of his clothes. We can let some go."
"It was asleep?" Harry asked.
Luna has recently announced she wouldn’t be working so closely with Draco and Pansy anymore, for she’s decided to specialise in children. Draco and Pansy, both undertaking the curse-damage specialty, will be at least two floors away from her. Not that it had been a surprise, but Draco will miss being close to her every day. They can still have their usual coffee breaks, Luna had said, and he agreed.
"Speak French in the scrum for me, will you? You’re so handsome and useful," Pansy said, patting his cheek. "Go tell them something nice to make up for
"I like the way you kiss me."
"What are you going to say to me? That I would know about being a coward? I do. I’m not saying this for his sake. I’m saying it for yours. Don’t let him walk away from you."
"You’re not going to specify a type?"
Their breaths come out ragged. Harry pulls away, taking a deep gulp of air. Draco doesn’t let him go far, hungrily chasing his lips. Draco
"It’s got to be something like Atticus. Are your parents into Classics?" Stella asked. Atty took a long pull from her pint. "Adelaide?"
Teddy talked with his mouth open about his friends at Muggle school while they were slumped against the back wall of the shed, facing the surrounding field, tall grass scratchy against his arms.
Harry led him through the rest of the house on the tour that was interrupted yesterday. Draco made him point out every object that was stolen. He pulled out a black quill and notebook. Was this room used during the war? By whom? What did Harry want it to be used for? What renovations had he done?
Harry shrugs, still smiling . “Whatever helps you sleep at night.”
"He’s fine, aren’t you Harry?" Teddy said after a cursory glance. "Draco is telling me about outer space since we’re studying space at school. Can I show you?"
Actually, Draco reminded Harry of her, but he was not sure she would appreciate that.
"If it were different, would you—"
"So shall it be," Draco said.
Ron held his birthday at the Burrow as always. It was the last time Harry could relax going into the last stretch of the season. Some players were more lax, but Harry tended to be all or nothing. Halfway didn’t suit him for anything. He kicked up his feet and had too many ciders and watched everyone laugh and dance to the wireless without joining in. Ginny sat on the end of his lawn chair and nudged him hard with her foot.
“I like it here,” Harry says finally, gazing so intensely at the picture Draco wonders if his intent is making the moment displayed in the photo disappear by sheer willpower. Then he adds, “I can feel your magic.”
“No, you’re not,” Draco hears. Her voice is grave and loud. Too loud.
"What do you do after a match?"
Harry couldn’t help it. This was the final straw. He sat on the steps and put his face in his arms.
Draco huffs a laugh. “No, I don’t.” Just the tip of his index finger leaves the safety of his blanket, pointing at the ever-growing pile of papers and magazines on the centre table.
Harry wanted to press about his past a little, about his Muggle boyfriend Hermione and Ron mentioned. Someone had made Draco favour tweed and learn how to wash dishes by hand and drive a little silver Ford Fiesta hatchback. But dinner was lighthearted, and Harry didn’t want to show his hand this early. Draco fascinated him, especially when it involved the transformation from who he had been to now.
Draco doesn’t turn until the voice echoes in the quietness. “Hello,” the man says. “Can I buy you a drink?”
Draco raises a questioning eyebrow. “It died because of Voldemort’s dark magic. I already know that—”
A shiver runs down Draco’s spine, the hair on his arm standing on end.
"They can't as long as I still have the name," Draco said.
Draco leads the way as they run, drenched and laughing across the empty streets.
he thinks.
Harry’s inside it.
"Speaking of plants," Harry said. "I’ve got a new courtyard. Would you want to come look? Not sure what to do with it, and I don’t recognise the plants."
Everyone at the table, except for them, roars with laughter. Draco has to agree with Harry. In silence, obviously. Apart from all that Saviour of the world business, he’s finding Harry to be genuinely good, caring, and selflessly devoted to those he loves. He is, to this day, amazed at how he secured a man as wonderful as Harry by his side, and he’s determined not to let him go.
Does Draco even want to be flirted with?
At least verifiably true, and he paid the fine during the Quidditch World Cup in Athens, though the pride party was nowhere near the event. He was more careful from then on.
And then he shoves all the others inside the water, gets up and vanishes everything, from the tub to the letters, with a wave of his wand. It’s beyond him how he even used that bathroom throughout the course of those years, when all it does is remind him of the baths he shared with Harry after terrible days at work.
“You say this because you wanted to bring the dumb girls you pick up without mommy and daddy meddling,” Pansy snorts.
He takes a faltering step towards the door, trying uselessly to avoid the mess that is now on his floor, and his foot accidentally kicks something. The thing is hard, slides on the tiles and bumps against the closet before it stops.
It’s only when Harry releases a heavy breath, as his grin turns more confident, that Draco lets out a shaky breath he’s been holding.
He’s still trying to control his smile when he comes to fetch Harry, after sending a Patronus to Hermione. The room is ready for Harry. There's a set of the silk dragon printed pyjamas resting on the bed, and a new towel on the bathroom. If Harry feels Draco’s bliss through the bond—and Draco’s embarrassingly sure that he does—he doesn’t say a thing before thanking him and locking himself inside the prepared bedroom.
Harry grumbled. He'd said that because it was what you said, and he had felt sort of bad about how surprised Blaise was at the breakup. It wasn’t a storybook romance. They danced around each other for months before Harry spotted him after a match and took him home. They dated a bit. Harry was under the impression he'd hurt Blaise's ego more than his feelings.
Draco gets lost in her arms, even if they’re not the ones he wants right now. Even if her voice is not the right one. If her presence doesn’t bring the comfort he needs. And he cries, because that’s all he can do while trying to keep himself whole.
He Apparates on the spot, without waiting for Pansy. He feels the familiar pull of magic as the world darkens around him for a second before he lands.
“What is this?”
"Let's start with the former master bedroom," Draco said. "What do you want to happen?"
"Good to see you," Harry said ruffling Teddy’s hair. He worried that Teddy had seen, or worse, heard, the whole mess on the pitch, but he didn’t seem fazed.
He shakes his head. “No. I could have done more. I should have healed you.” He had promised her she’d be better, she’d be fine. But he had let her go. Just like he had let Harry slip from his grasp.
"Oh you came, good to see you!" Neville gave him a long hug before dragging him into the kitchen and dropping Harry’s rolling suitcase into a hall closet. "Fancy seltzer fine with you?"
"Nothing's wrong," Harry said. "I just found some of my parents' things, and it's been overwhelming."
Draco would be unaccustomed to both hearing Harry speak at length and with any passion. Harry took it seriously but it wasn't often he was able to just talk about this.
He wants to take the words back as soon as they’re out. They’re not true. Not entirely. But he can’t. He can’t undo what he’s just said. And he knows he will never forget how Harry’s expression creases in confusion, in hurt.
“You mean still?” Harry nods. “Julie took it. That Muggle friend from your college. You had your friends over occasionally. That’s the biggest reason we moved into a Muggle neighbourhood, actually. This and to run away from the press, naturally.”
Draco, however, never got to feel what it’d be like to have lived with this gift, to have access to such power, to such life.
"No," Harry said. "I'm not married."
He clears his throat, and Harry snaps to attention, staring at him through glazed and untethered eyes.
Fuck it.
Something in the attic exploded. Before Harry knew it, Draco pinned him to the ground, straddling him with his wand aloft, holding a Shield Charm so strong, it was opaque.
"Oh, shut up, Miles," Millicent said. She said as if this was merely tiresome.
He shakes his head.
Draco vanishes everything with a swift motion of his wand, and the kitchen descends into an odd silence, devoid of the buzz that had been ringing in his ears for such a long time.
“I’m alive, and fine, Pansy. No need to worry about me,” Draco mumbles from his place on the couch. Huffing a breath, he adds in a murmur, “Not that you asked.”
We had changed little, but I was both leaner and taller, and she was shorter than me now, her red glossy hair a lot shorter, in a way that reminded me too much of Ginny.
When Harry comes traipsing back to the kitchen, though, the first thing that tumbles out of Draco’s lips is, “Are they still a thing?”
like Draco always said it was.
“It’s better than doing nothing, than just waiting for a solution, like you were. And I was his Healer first!” Draco cries, and doesn’t let the unfairness of his words lodge inside him for long—Draco’s been there with Pansy and Hermione, studying everything they could to fix this. He’d not been alone. But Harry was his husband, his patient, his life to save more than theirs. “Finding his soul wouldn’t have worked if there was nothing keeping him
The next morning, Harry had run out of things to do and he was so bored he finally resolved to ask Draco if he could help with the house.
"People like souvenirs," Draco said in a neutral tone.
Then Draco left the way he came.
In the end, Harry always comes back. He’s sure his heart will cease beating completely soon just from the sight of Harry alone.
He stays silent, though, because it’s not his place to comfort, just to listen to him and be there.
"Like this. Tighter. Kiss me." Harry did, trying to keep a steady rhythm of his hand as he delved back into Draco’s mouth. He tasted like something complicated and expensive and
Draco approaches him slowly, closing the door behind him. Potter glances at him, but doesn’t move.
"Sinistra is the obvious choice. As a bonus, she was actually competent," Gemma said.
Pansy slowly shakes her head, her tone is now distant, not worried, but resentful. “Draco, you’ve lost your mind and crossed every limit with this. You can’t play with his life like this.” She raises a finger, pointing at his chest. “You’ll tell him today, Draco. Or I will.”
“How long do you have?” Harry asks, pulling back and running his fingers through his untamed hair.
Harry led him to sit in the kitchen. It was the nicest part of the house now, where the renovation had taken. Harry was proud that he had restored the long table with nothing more than sandpaper and a fresh coat of varnish. They sat.
"I love how much you talk," Harry admitted.
He notices new things about Harry every day, how he’s becoming a whole new person in tiny details: Harry shaves the sides of his head and stops using glasses because they make him feel older. He still takes some potions to help his body adapt after the long coma, but he finds comfort in exercising every day. Harry’s smile is broader, he’s wilder now, more active.
"Well, Jan’s dad says you can go fast on the motorway because that’s what it’s made for. You should get one, it would make you much cooler," Teddy said.
"Harry, hello. What can I do for you?" Pansy asked.
"Bonding spell?"
"Fifth year?" Gemma guessed. Something about her reminded Harry of an older Pansy. She had short, dark hair. Molly Weasley would have said it was a shame she cut her hair short since she was so pretty.
"That's an impressively elaborate ploy for very little information. There’s no way he let you out early with all that," Harry said, picking his clothes off the floor.
What a coincidence it is that Draco
His body feels limp, limbs heavy as his heart rests, raw and exposed, between them. He leaves it there. There’s no need for a crushed heart right now, and he leaves Pansy to a screaming battle with Kreacher.
Milo thumped Harry on the back hard and made kissy noises as he went by. But it was friendly, good-natured ribbing. Draco seemed to relax a tiny bit more when he saw that Harry wasn’t upset.
"I’m not your ‘mate’ so ease off. Draco is my friend. You are not. Watch yourself."
“You need to see light, to go out.”
"I accept. Your debt is cleared," Harry said. He recalled those words from the trial, but at the time he had never understood why Narcissa Malfoy had been so formal. A shiver settled over him as Draco tipped the ring into his palm, cold to the touch. It was silver and carved with delicate scrolls of leaves, a compass, and a bow and arrow.
"I don’t know if I feel up for anything stressful," Harry said as Draco led him down to the kitchen.
"Are you mad at me for the team or as a friend?"
Harry looks nice in his kitchen, at ease. More than last night. Though his shoulders remain stiff, his features are more relaxed. Eyes not as perturbed as they’d been the day before.
"Goldstein like Anthony Goldstein from our year?"
He forces a laugh. “You were very private about those years. Even
“You sure?” Draco lets himself be stripped, his shirt tousling his hair when it’s finally off. A shiver runs up his spine when his bare chest is met with cold air.
Hermione gave him a meaningful look. "I haven’t done that for anyone recently…"
"Don’t be like that," Harry said. He touched her arm. "Sorry for not stopping by."
"Malfoy is handsome, but he’s a morally blank stuck up ex-Death Eater. I swear everyone forgave him because he's useful. No, I will not try anything. Now tell me about the courts. How is the world of criminal law reform?"
And Harry did wake up, but he is nowhere close to this room, and it now feels devoid of the hope that kept Draco going for five years.
The owl hoots softly, raking its head against Draco's cheek, and only then does Draco realise his skin is wet. A stray tear falls on the envelope, marring the ink that forms
She’s been taking the potions for two weeks, her resistance steadily increasing. Elle can’t move much more than her face and hands now, but her body
"I find most cake too sweet," Harry admitted. He had gone off sugar in recent years, as it gave him headaches if he had too much. Last time he ate treacle tart, he had to go lie down, which made him feel like someone’s maiden aunt.
"Thank you!" they said in chorus. Each child got a chance to come up and shake his hand before queuing. Rose walked around the press table and launched herself into Harry’s arms instead. She was getting taller, looking more and more like her parents. He had to remember to get in a bit more kid time before training started.
"You can trust me with the playbook. I'll work on it."
“I really can’t share you,” he repeats, and Harry nods understandingly. “I missed you so much, Harry.”
"I hate it when you’re like this. Can’t we leave some mystery in the world?" Draco asked. He didn’t sound annoyed though, just embarrassed. And Harry liked the idea of Draco knowing his habits. After a long pause Draco said, "The trial."
"How was your off-season, Park?" Harry asked the alternate Seeker. He was newer to the team, and an intimidatingly good flyer, Seeker for South Korea’s Worlds. If he agreed to play any other position, Min-Woo would no doubt be starting for another club. But he was loyal to being a Seeker even if it meant playing a couple matches a season.
“Draco…” Pansy’s tone turns softer at his display of weakness, and Draco hates it. He hates she’s being condescending with him because she thinks he needs it, needs to be pitied. “Does Harry know about it?”
"You're one to talk," Astoria shot back at Millicent. She turned conspiratorially to Harry. "We should have known about her thing for older women when we were all talking about our crushes in fifth year, and Millie comes out with Professor Sprout." She was still loud enough for the group to hear. Millicent didn’t deny it, simply shrugging in response.
"Get out of my sight," Harry snapped. He pointed to the door, and Luc left. Harry dropped his head into his hands. Stella came in with a low whistle.
Harry hadn’t shaved this morning, so it looked like, with this uptick of luck, he was going to continue not to shave. He drew the line at not washing jerseys, socks or pants. Draco claimed not to like the beard, but he touched it a lot, rubbing his face against Harry's and then complaining.
“Harry,” Draco calls in the darkness.
be, and that the Forest’s magic finally realised that.
Luc dragged his feet walking over and Harry’s face must have been doing something unpleasant because Luc looked nervous. Harry gave him the warning. "She’s already under scrutiny you couldn’t imagine. You better be serious about her. Very. She’s your teammate. You fuck around, I will make you wish you had never set foot on this team."
Harry continues to laugh unashamedly when Julie tugs Draco’s shoulders and pushes him towards the main building. “Come on, it’ll be
At one point, she stops talking altogether, and they fall into a serene silence as they finish the tarts they’ve ordered for dessert. Eventually, Draco tells her about the procedure he’s just performed on Elle and his fears. Luna congratulates him for the unconventional thinking, and much like Elle, tells him he’s a genius. Draco blushes and hunches his shoulders back in the chair.
"I hope you don’t mind," Draco said.
"No. I…thank you," Harry said. It felt like an inadequate response, but there was a burning in the back of his eyes from unshed tears.
"It’s a crying shame. I’d rather see you in a Harpies jersey than Cannons one," said Harry. He was caught between admiration for Ron’s stubbornness and a desire to argue about his love for a last-chance team who, in Harry's view, would have been relegated from the Championship League years ago if not for their Historical Team status.
"No, you're quite right," Pansy said. She smiled but there was something of a hint of forced openness as if she was baring her neck for a blade. A hot flash of shame went through Harry. Even years later, the war was still present in every interaction.
Hermione and Ron came for an early dinner at the hotel restaurant since Rose was at Grandma Jean’s. The food wasn’t good even by hotel standards. All Harry wanted was a steak and a salad, and he was presented with an under-seasoned lamb shank and unpleasantly wet lettuce. Still, it was nice to have them around.
Draco spends sleepless nights reading every new headline about Harry—
"Krum! No one told me you came," Harry said.
"Yes," Harry said.
Of course he didn’t, Draco is aware of that. Harry hasn’t learned to be selfish yet. In Harry’s head, he just gave up his life so the Wizarding World could live and that’s the type of thing he does. He sacrifices. And that’s what Draco loves most about him.
Draco had never noticed before the day at the park the gold flecks in Harry’s eyes, like the sunlight finding a breach in all that green. He’s never been so close to Harry, not like this, never been allowed to stare freely at him and he wonders, absently, what Harry sees when he looks at Draco.
We crossed it.
"Yeah, I thought so," an Arrows player taunted. "Do what Mummy and Daddy tell you."
He invited Harry on an impulse, without properly planning how he’ll do this, as fear belligerently fought his morals. In the end, he decides it’s best if Harry learns about the bond from him rather than from anybody else. Draco’s not sure Harry’ll be all that inclined to forgive him for having kept it for so long, but he doesn’t want to make things worse by not coming forth by himself—granted that he’s being forced into it.
"Speaking of tradition," Luc said, reaching into his pocket and throwing Galleons on the table. The bar staff, all quite used to and well compensated for the frequent presence of the team, started pouring shots of whisky.
“It’s good to see you again, Draco,” Marvin says, clasping a hand on Draco’s back. “Look at you. You seem like another man. You look so much better. I heard you and Harry got married. Who’d have thought?”
"Now, Percy, your mother means well. If you’d like to bring Pansy, she is welcome and we look forward to meeting her."
"No, I sold some of them. There was more than I could ever need, even if he meant it as an insult. The dangerous ones I send to other Curse-Breakers so they can train their apprentices."
“Yes,” he replies immediately. Then, “No! I’m... I can’t. I don’t know how. I’m a coward.”
Draco gulps, sitting down by his side. He stretches a hand towards Harry, but when his fingers graze Harry’s warm skin, it burns him, and Draco pulls back. “Harry… Did you leave bed today?”
There were letters that he must have carried around for years, well-worn from all his friends. Photographs, some Wizarding, some polaroids, including ones Harry had never seen before: baby Harry with a cat, a bright and overexposed Remus and Sirius laughing hard, one where James popped in front of the camera to jump on top of his friends on a loop, Lily at twenty in a blue bikini with her tongue sticking out, portraits of friends with captions like ‘the Doc’ and ‘darling Marls’ in a script that wasn’t Sirius’. Harry could see why they hadn’t been included in his album; all of the photos had flaws, but Harry didn’t mind.
"She already signed, Stella. We’ll play some pickup, that’s it." They were both thinking of Coach and the unspoken convention that rookies never came before summer training camp, but Harry held more sway in this situation, and he’d be the one to pay if it upset Coach.
"Okay, we just have to be quiet by the stairs,"
“He only has to come when we need to track the activeness of his curse,” Pansy adds. “I can’t do that from home, it’s dangerous, but we only do that once a week now.”
"How is it?" Hermione asked, casually. Too casually.
"If you need a thrill, do normal stuff. Go to a nightclub. Travel. Skydive. Try Muggle drugs. Eat fried food. Party. Spend your time picking up as many lovers of any gender you like. This is a very progressive club in that respect."
nice to go out again with his friend, to not have to worry about anything, to have company and drink and forget his life. But this isn’t as easy as it’s supposed to be. As Draco wants it to be. Because he
When Draco looks at Harry again, he’s amused to find Harry poking a gruff looking dragon on the sleeve of his pyjamas. The dragon huffs a breath and flies away, disappearing somewhere under Harry’s arm.
"My apologies. I seem to have forgotten myself." Draco stared blankly at the blood welling up in dozens of little cuts.
“They are possibly kind of okay with you now,” Harry rectifies, smiling up at him. “And Teddy and Luna definitely love you. I don’t—This feels right, Draco. Don’t you think?”
Harry pulls away, taking with him his blessed warmth and Draco instantly misses it. But Harry’s staring at him with something like concern in his eyes, and Draco can’t really understand whatever is bugging him.
Draco is quiet for a moment, considering whether he’s heard correctly. He blinks, stunned, trying to focus on the words now repeating in his head. Harry is sorry he’s hurting. And Draco feels it in the bond. Not pity, but understanding, even though that bit of sadness and betrayal is still there.
agree with that. Harry’s awake now, and that means Draco has to move on without the love of his life. Even though he doesn’t know how.
"You see"—and there was a dangerous edge to Draco’s voice—"despite saying that you want me to come as a boyfriend, I’m fairly certain you don’t want people outside of our friends and family to know. I understand privacy, but it feels like you don’t think that I’m worth the trouble."
Ginny was still easy to be around, and Harry was grateful for that. Even if it meant on occasion, like this evening, Ginny slyly asked, "How is Stella Abidi?"
"Look at the beard burn. You look like I’ve been…at you for hours." Harry touched Draco’s neck which was pink. He picked up colour on his skin from everything. Harry found it fascinating.
Harry hums, reflective, and rests his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Living people count?”
Harry leaned back on her desk. She sighed.
They wrapped up in a half hour. Harry had to admit that he did look pretty good in all the photos she showed him. It was easy to see the sharp cut of the vee in his abs, the thick Quidditch thighs, the defined muscles of his biceps. He looked like he was contemplating murder in a few, but he also looked determined reaching for a practice Snitch. He also liked the one with him running his hands through his hair while leaning back and laughing.
“How did you find it?”
Harry’s grin is sad, slow. “I know.”
"If that’s all, I—"
"I won't," Harry said with a cheery wave.
glances back in mournful silence, as if Draco isn’t here, or if he isn’t worthy of an answer. He insists, cold tears burning his cheeks. “Why did you take him from me? Take me to him! Please! Don’t let—”
Weasley’s eyes are wide and they travel unashamedly across Draco’s body, and then the kitchen, and back to something behind him in the living room.
, he’s barely prepped enough for it. Draco pushes himself inside Harry, and tries to bury within him all that he feels, all that he is now, and Harry takes him with a pliant body and cries that welcome Draco easily. It’s not enough, nothing is, but maybe it will be someday.
He does what he can to make it better for Harry. Draco takes to using the sticky notes Harry loves so much, leaving them around the house with little reminders of what Harry might need. The first note had left Harry scowling for an entire day, darting annoyed glances at Draco whenever they met.
"What makes it a Wizarding piano?" Harry asked. Despite himself, he was curious.
Draco hasn’t allowed himself to think about
"A very fine house, and I’d be happy to see you in any of them," Andromeda responded. Harry and Draco each took a shopping bag from her. All four of them put everything away in no time, and Harry collapsed onto a kitchen chair.
family. Living together. Kids running in the hallways, delicious smells coming from the kitchen, feeling
Harry had shaken his head and cried silently looking at the photo and imaging what could have been. Neville’s eyes were also wet, and they just stayed there for a long while in silence, looking at the ghosts of the past, but for once, not feeling so alone in their grief. Maybe in another time, instead of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, he would have grown up calling Uncle Frank and Aunt Alice. Maybe in another world he would have grown up in a manor, spoilt and surrounded by toys and big rooms. Maybe in another reality he would have grown up loved and surrounded by family and friends, calling Neville silly nicknames like siblings do, playing, laughing, doing mischief and just not caring for what was out there.
It was late in the night when he finally crawled under the covers and let himself fall asleep.
Professor Snape frowned.
“Of course I’m not Sirius. I’m Draco” Harry knew his boyfriend was trying to lighten the mood and avoid a fight, but he was really not in the mood for jokes. He crossed his arms in a defensive gesture.
In the Room of Requirement, where they had created their little ‘Study & Cuddle Paradise’, which consisted of a big bedroom with a huge bed, a comfy couch, a table, a fireplace and a library. Little by little they had started adding details to their Room, like the bathroom with the big tub and the colours of the walls and sheets. Draco had instead in using dark green and white as a theme. The result was simply beautiful and elegant, and the dark colours were very relaxing. At one point they even tried to add their photos to the wall, to see if the next time they retuned to the Room, they would still be there. And yes, somehow, the Room stored the objects somewhere and each time they retuned it was still the same.
protective of his godson. He seemed to hate Harry even more now that he knew (oh, they were sure he knew) he had taken his godson’s ‘innocence’.
“Ah! Rem, I’m offended… after all this time he still calls us like old men!” Sirius whined.
The solution came for them in the middle of the week.
“And a male pregnancy is hard to hide with muggles all over, as soon as you start showing you would have to hide inside the house all the time or use glamour spells that might be too taxing on your magic”.
It was during the fifth detention, more than a week after the first interaction with the professor, that they really talked.
“Harry!” Draco shouted in surprise, his expression was horrified, their faces were now mirror images of embarrassment and shame.
, just about Harry Potter.
Thank you to everyone reading and keeping up with my slow updates... every comment and your support just keeps motivating me to continue this story :3 I have already many ideas for the next chapters... the baby's name has already been decided!
The next chapter may come after Christmas... so in the meantime Happy Christmas! Stay safe ya'all :)
Harry’s beath soon become heavy. He must have really been exhausted.
Sirius stilled with his mouth open, Remus closed his eyes and sighed.
They had agreed to see each other in the Shrieking Shack the day after.
The nausea and morning sickness continued, but Harry finally found a few ‘safe foods’ that he could ingest, so he at least didn’t starve, the house elves in the kitchen helped a lot too.
“Oh, I can imagine” Harry chuckled and let go of his godfather “Hi Remus”.
Harry swallowed and felt his eyes getting wet, Draco subtly placed his hand on his lower back.
Here you are... Hope you guys liked it!
“Severus, we need your help. But first you need to swear you will not tell a soul what we’re about to tell you, and that you will not harm Harry in any way, be it physical or verbal. After I ran away from
. And Snape had made it very clear that he wanted Harry, far, far, far away from his godson.
“Severus Snape? What do you mean?” Remus was the first to react.
I'm thinking of keeping up with this flashback method of story telling.
Draco nodded and inhaled.
At first, they only used the room to study and see each other away from the others. Then, one night, Draco had created ‘The Room’. The bed had been so inviting that the two teens couldn’t resist their hormones anymore. They took each other’s first time and continued in their explorations every night in that same place.
Hermione was the more rational of the trio, but she was also very firm of her beliefs. Harry had seen her defend fiercely her opinion and try to convince others that the only way to think was hers. And he had heard her snide remarks when Dean and Seamus were seen kissing once in the common room. It was not a pretty sight. What would she say if she found out he got pregnant at 16, while still in school and at the beginning of a war? She would become insufferable.
When Harry officially hit 11 weeks of pregnancy, a little bump started to be noticeable (that, only if Harry was naked and you knew where to look) and both fathers were so proud and
“He’s trying to turn you on
“Professor… I grew up with muggles. Until two days ago I didn’t even know it was possible for men to get pregnant. No one ever told me.” Harry’s tone was bitter.
Harry agreed that it would be the best way to hide from both sides of the war and promised to talk about it with Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
The week and a half after the confrontation with Snape.
“Thank you-” Draco’s voice broke “We’ve been a mess ever since I brew the potion to find out, but the books didn’t tell much more than history and how to brew the potion.”
FLASHBACK –
Harry swallowed and nodded, then he straightened his back and looked the professor with all of his determination.
To tell the first detention with Snape was awkward, it would be an understatement. The professor made him sit on the sofa in the office and gave him a stack of books on pregnancy and child rearing, that he would only be permitted to read in the safety of his heavily warded office. They talked very little, and the tension was palpable, but at least neither of them insulted the other. It was a first.
) to finally meet him. But all the others had doubted his every word. They didn’t believe he refused the Dark Lord to go into hiding. They didn’t believe he would rather abandon his family, than to follow the path of destruction and murder Voldemort wanted for him.
“Why does it matter who I study with?” Harry replied.
! Inside of him!
“Yes. But knowing and seeing is different”.
“It’s called having a stick up your--” Remus gave Sirius a slap on the back of his head.
again.” This was not a question. It was an accusation.
Harry started laughing out loud “
“We’ll have to run these two by Severus and see that they are going to fit with his plan”.
In the next chapter Harry will meet Sirius and reveal the big news!
Harry reread the letter and pocketed it, then he returned to the Great Hall, where Draco was still at the Slytherin table, talking with Blaise. He made a sign to talk outside and returned in the empty classroom, waiting for the other boy, while fiddling with the parchment in his pocket.
“What do you know about wizard pregnancies?”
“Yes, yes, you’re right. I had some things to discuss before summer… but using letters is not recommended when you don’t know if it’s being monitored”.
The ‘Light Side’ wanted him to fight. To be a symbol. Even though he was still underage and learning. Even though he never asked to participate. Even though there were Wizards and Witches stronger and more powerful than him. Even though he was never trained to do this ‘job’, they just expected him to pull out his wand and make miracles happen. He was not powerful. He was not strong. He was not brave. He actually came to regret arguing with the Hat to be put in Gryffindor. The Hat was right, in Slytherin he would have been great (and he would have more time with Draco).
The following week was hell for Harry.
“This better not be a prank, Potter” he spoke slowly, his baritone voice full of contempt “because you will be really sorry by the time I’m done with you”.
“Premature?” Draco’s voice was strangled “Isn’t that dangerous?”
It started with a simple question.
“Oh”.
Draco had helped a lot during the hard times of realizations that came one after another. First his professors, deaf and blind to what was actually happening in school, then the Headmaster, and finally his friends, one after another, that kept disappointing him.
“Draco. This is dangerous. Getting pregnant before being of age… you know that you parents are still legally responsible for you. If this gets out… the Dark Lord… I don’t even want to think what he would do to you knowing you are carrying Potter’s spawn.” He shot Harry a threatening glare. “Potter, I clearly remember telling you to stay away from my godson.”
Harry paled and shot Draco a panicked look. The other boy chose to catch the awkward moment to make his presence known.
“I can guess from this little outburst, that the reason you need my medical expertise is not for an abortion. Am I right?”
The professor looked between the two of them, aghast.
Crazy. Everything was crazy. And in a few hours he was sure he was going to regret making this decision, but he trusted Draco with his life… and the baby’s. So, he decided to take the leap, hoping that he would land safely.
Professor Snape sighed. “No, Potter. I mean the mandatory check-ups for muggleborns to get their vaccinations against magical diseases like Spattergoit and Dragon Pox.”
The loud sound of apparition startled the both of them.
Since the big fight with his friends, Harry had suddenly found himself with more free time, which he chose to dedicate to Draco.
Remus shook his head “No, I think I smelled your change of hormones”.
The plan was a success. Snape ‘caught’ him red-handed in the dungeons and assigned two weeks straight of detention. Harry didn’t have to act when he told his team he was sorry. The team didn’t take the news well, but Katie accepted to substitute Harry as captain, ignoring Ron’s heated glare. It was unanimously decided that Ginny was the best seeker as a substitute for the team, and the reserve chaser would take her place.
“I have no idea… Maybe we should read those books some more today, learn more about all this.” Harry sighed.
Harry shot him a glare.
Harry opened his eyes and found the other boy’s silver ones staring at him fondly.
It was a recessive gene, so some half-bloods could still be able to conceive if at least one of their parents was a pureblood. James Potter was a pureblood of a very old lineage. And with his luck, of course Harry Potter would get that gene.
When he woke up, the morning after, Draco had already returned to his dormitory and had left a note and a vial of potion.
“I don’t want to go back there” he said honestly “and they would never accept another like
Harry slowly took off the cloak and tried smiling sheepishly at the professor, but he was sure his face muscles were showing more of a painful grimace than a smile at the moment.
If I keep this method what would you like to see? Thier first kiss? The Yule Ball? Harry's confession? Or others?
“Of course, why else do you think we are looking at wards stronger than those at Grimmauld? We are even considering the
“Draco is not pregnant, professor. I am.” Harry took a step forward, and Draco wrapped his arm around his waist.
Draco nodded “I know, then let’s tell him together”.
“Are you better now?” he whispered, pressing his forehead against the other’s.
His ‘friends’ had obviously noticed his disappearance. Even though their relationship had definitely cracked from Harry’s point of view, they still insisted that they should know everything that was happening to him. They knew he had been spending some time with Draco, after all it was the reason they fought, but they didn’t understand the extent of their commitment. Or maybe they just refused to recognise it.
“Harry, calm down. Listen to me. We need someone to trust in the castle, he is the only adult I trust here.”
Draco and Harry finally talk to to Snape.
For a potion’s prodigy like Draco, it was quite simple to make but it required a few hours of simmering, so they stayed up all night preparing it. Or at least, Harry tried to stay up and keep Draco company, but he was so tired, sick and emotionally exhausted that he fell asleep.
Professor Snape sighed “You are most definitely pregnant. If I’m not wrong about 9 or 10 weeks pregnant. So you’re between your second and third month. Male pregnancies usually result in premature labour due to the fact that the male body is not as accommodating as the female one, so your delivery date could be estimated around the beginning of November. Since you are on the thin side it could even be the end of October, but to guess more accurately we will have to watch how the next months go.”
“We made him take an oath” Draco replied, “And he has been helping us finding a way to get away… we were considering going into a Muggle town to hide from both sides of the war”.
He had imagined that in the future, after the war,
“Oh, yeah but aren’t you already living at Grimmauld?” Harry frowned.
much.
“Be careful and be ready for when we will take you away, and please warn Severus that we will approach him soon”.
He even avoided Draco’s eyes in class and during lunch break, because he didn’t trust in his ability to pretend nothing was wrong.
Sirius was still confused “What?”.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked worriedly.
“A muggle town would be okay after the war is over, and after the baby is born. Right now the priority is to disappear and an isolated house is the best way to do it” Remus said.
Every evening.
CRACK
This chapter has no flashbacks... but they may return in the future, I'm tryng to give them a sort of connection with the progression of the story.
Really, brothers in all but blood.
Some fluff, some lemon and some more backgound story.
Draco blinked “And that’s not good because…?”
Draco kept one hand at the base of Harry’s shaft and slowly licked around the tip, tasting his lovers’ precome and making Harry groan in pleasure. Then he proceeded to take the length in his mouth and moved up and down, maintaining a slow rhythm. His other hand was on Harry’s waist, keeping him steady as the other tried to wriggle, moaning in pleasure.
The professor nodded and studied silently the two teenagers before him.
Draco laughed “It’s called having manners”.
Sirius frowned “Are you sure he is not going to tell Dumbledore?”
Harry smiled “He must not have been happy. But then, I don’t think he knows how to be happy. Do you think he needs to get laid? That would explain why he’s always grumpy.”
The blonde placed a light kiss on top of Harry’s cock. “Let me take care of you” he purred.
“He should stop by Grimmauld Place in the next few days for an Order meeting… we will find a way to talk to him in private” Remus said, tucking away all the papers and muttering a spell to place some dust on the table. At Harry’s confused expression he replied with a shrug and a wink “Better safe than sorry, can’t have people believing this place is used for secret meetings”.
“I was afraid you would react bad to the news”
Remus shifted and took a stack of papers from his robe, he shot a quick
“I didn’t mean her” Draco looked at him in the eyes.
“If you trust Severus, then so do we.” Sirius declared. Harry was so proud of his godfather for this.
Harry is a nervous wreck. He receives a letter from Sirius.
“I was so scared before you entered the room” Harry murmured.
There were only two ways to find out if a wizard was expecting. The first was obvious, going to a medical trained witch or wizard who was authorized to perform a diagnostic charm. But that was not really an option for them, because that way, the professors and their guardians would have to be informed, and by the time of breakfast the next morning, all of the school would know about it.
“What would be okay?” Remus asked.
For the millionth time in the last two days, Harry wondered why his life had to be like this.
The ‘Dark Side’ wanted him dead. Obviously. And they also wanted Draco dead, ever since he refused to take the Mark during the last summer. He had run away to seek refuge with the Order of the Phoenix, but he was not given a warm welcome. Dumbledore was glad to give him a chance, Snape always supported him, and Sirius and Remus were happy (Sirius was
at the same time.
Draco pushed himself up, do that he could look better in Harry’s eyes “Never.”
“They can take oaths-”
Draco posture suddenly went rigid, but he looked at his godfather with all the seriousness he could master, given the situation “We’re keeping it. Him or her… they’re our child. It is a little too early than I imagined… but I’ve known for years that this is what I wanted. A family with Harry is all I ever wanted for my future”.
Harry arrived at the Shrieking Shack over one hour before the time agreed with Sirius. Draco was with him, and he was sitting on a dusty chair while he warily watched his boyfriend walk up and down the small room. Even though outside was sunny, inside the shack it was still quite cold, so every now and then he would shudder and use a warming spell on both of them.
Ah. The baby.
“Yes, well… that’s right, but we’re actually thinking of leaving that nightmare of a place” Sirius continued “It’s not the only secure place the Blacks owned, and anyway we have enough money to buy and ward a manor to be even more safe. The truth is… I hate that place and, with the Order and everyone coming and going it’s more like a station than a home anyway. I don’t want you to have to call that place home, Harry… I want to give you the best”.
“We are going to help you. Of course, we are going to do whatever it takes to protect the blob” Sirius said after he released them.
“So… what is the reason you could not wait two more weeks to see me?” Harry decided not to beat around the bush.
“Did you know that your mother was my godmother?” he had whispered after giving him the photo. “And my mother was yours.”
“Oh” Draco was at a loss at what to say but moved towards the other boy and hugged him. They stayed like that for a moment and then Harry continued. “I think we should involve him. I trust him with my life, and he will love the baby… I’m sure.”
Harry let out the sob he was holding, tears leaking from his eyes, he hid his face in the other’s shoulder and murmured “What are we going to do?”.
They were already on top of the hit-list of the Death Eaters, news like this would only make it worse.
“I-I d-don’t know” Harry sobbed, his arms unconsciously wrapping around his abdomen “Is it going to harm the baby? Oh god… I’m already doing this all wrong!”
“Of course! We can’t leave behind my favourite cousin!” Sirius exclaimed.
Sirius was the first to enter the room, his face visibly lightened up as he noticed that Harry had already arrived. He didn’t hesitate to give his godson a fierce hug, while Remus stood by the entrance, smiling.
Really, Harry was tired. Both sides were judgmental and bigoted. One thought that muggles and muggleborns were not worthy of having magic, the other side thought most purebloods and all Slytherins were all evil and potential future Dark Lords. At one point they even hated Harry, ‘symbol of the light’, just because he talked with a snake!
“Ron, I believe we already went over this topic many times in the last year”.
The other way to find out was though a potion and a spell combined. Harry would have to drink the potion and then perform the spell.
“Oh no. Now, that is something to worry about” Harry joked with a smirk.
“Yes, aren’t all babies little blobs at the beginning? By the way how far along are you?” he said looking at Harry’s stomach as if expecting it to grow before his eyes.
“We don’t know if it’s safe to have sex, but we can do other things in the meantime”.
“I don’t believe you” he told simply.
He took Harry’s hard member in his hand and started to slowly stroke it.
Sorry for disappearing! I have not forgotten nor abanoned this fic!
Ron was still a child. And Harry had to grow up fast, he never had time to think about childish things, and he found that other than Quidditch, he really had nothing in common with his friend.
“Why? Aren’t you two going to share?” Sirius asked.
Always.
He was used to the lies. He had lied to his friends about the relationship with Draco for years. He knew them. They wouldn’t understand.
“Did something happen?” Harry asked worriedly.
“Oh… well… about the house, let’s choose one with one more room” Draco said.
“Thanks” he said, “I also think he can help with the Gringotts stuff, he has a lot to do with the bank these days, as Head of the House of Black and because of the money the ministry gave him, no one would suspect seeing him in the bank.”
Looking back, months later, he would realise that that evening was the moment his relationship with the professor changed permanently.
Harry’s breath hitched. He could not lose Draco. No. But at the mere thought of aborting- no,
Remus laughed and proceeded to also hug the boys “You better give up, when your mother was pregnant, he also called you that, and let me tell you, she hated it. James, on the other hand, he thought it was funny”.
Draco shook his head and picked up on the tail end of whatever Percy was saying.
However, he didn't. He walked up to the blonde and pressed his lips against Ackley's.
Hermione bustled over to them before Harry could ask though and kissed him on the cheek, "Hullo Harry!" She has slightly intoxicated Harry noticed, Draco took his leave then and Harry watched closely as he wound through the large room, towards the exit.
"You'll never guess what we did," Rosie says to Harry, eyes wide with anticipation.
"Oh? Who's Blaise?" Draco rolled his eyes and turned to look at Harry.
As much as he wanted to tell Harry to stop, if he really wanted Draco, he wouldn't have cheated. But, that was hard, when first off, it felt as good as it did, and second, you loved the man on his knees before you.
"On a table, in the living room," Harry replies. Draco smiled again. However, this was beginning to frustrate Harry. Why can he remember where trivial things sit in his house, but he can't seem to remember any of the days it was taken or the God damned house?
"So, what did you think of the Cornish Pastie?" Percy asked as he opened the door for Draco.
Another thing I'm going to reiterate is bolding and italic usages. If it is just in italics, it means it's a thought. If it is bolded and italic, that means it's a memory or a flashback as someone called it yesterday. Another thing is, the memories or flashbacks will never be from the future, they are always in the past, I remember some confusion about that as well yesterday!
"See, not flinching." Draco rolled his eyes and continued to scrub at his hands. When all the dirt was finally gone, Draco turned off the sink and began drying his hands. When he was done, he walked past Harry. Before he could get out the bathroom door, Harry had a hold of his wrist, pulling him back into the bathroom.
"Thank you for all the information Harry, I will take this into consideration." Harry huffed.
"Of all the things I thought of you, becoming a muggle therapist was not one." Draco hummed at his comment. He peered down at his watch then shook his wrist, making his blazer sleeve fall back over the watch.
Harry watched as Draco came up the front-drive. The man had his hands full of different papers. His satchel hung loosely from around his wrist, and he was looking down at his feet, watching each step, carefully balancing the papers.
Harry narrowed his eyes, maybe Draco was right after all. Harry looked to the wall right as the clock struck 11. That's the end of their session then.
WHHHHAAATT?!?! I know you never expected this day! I posted in the middle of the week when I'm not off! I think I'm hitting my stride!
Looking over to Harry, he slowly looked over the man. The scar that had lined his head for all those years was now slowly fading, leaving no memory or trace of Voldemort.
"Ron, Hermione, and you went on tons of adventures, which I was always jealous of. Soon enough, we were teenagers, full of angst at the roles life had sorted us into."
Drarryandmycat!
I am very sorry for not updating, I was kinda stuck, so I came back to it and realized the whole book needed a revamping! So, the previous chapters are all good now, no spelling errors, a corrected format.
Draco stepped inside to a lovely sunroom. It had tall windows looking out over the field they had been sitting in yesterday. He had a ton of houseplants. Percy helped Draco out of his coat and hung it on a rack.
"You're feelings about anything, or, should I say anyone, else! I mean Harry, you wouldn't even give me more than two words when we first started, now, you make a move on me and expect me to love you back?"
"Same time next week?" Draco smiled as the man shoved his glasses up his nose.
Draco's breathing became erotic and he let his head fall back against the wall as he wrapped his legs around Harry.
They sat in silence for a few more moments, "If you were to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or the body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?" Ackley finally asked.
"I guessed wrong about you two." Draco smiled and nodded.
"How are you?" Draco began, shifting slightly in the leather armchair he was sitting in.
"Good, Hermione will appreciate it, she's been working for ages on it." Harry smiled as he clicked on the lamp sitting on his bedside table, watching Ron redress.
When had he fallen for the other man?
Harry responded quickly, pushing against the blonde's lips. Then Draco pulled away. He stood awkwardly for a few scant seconds.
He was worn out. All the memories rushing back was really too much for him to take. Biding goodnight to Draco, he went to bed early that night.
Then he was off for lunch with Ron and Hermione.
"I understand why we didn't work, the kids were our tie, and when they were all gone, we realized how truly different we were." Harry paused, "Though I guess I could say I'm still unsure, yes."
He could remember all the hurt, all the pain he felt, all the pain his friends felt, all the pain his husband had felt, and his relief in using Billion.
"I feel like the more time goes by, the less I feel." Harry watched Draco pull at his trouser legs and take a seat, he crossed his legs and grabbed his notepad. Draco took a deep breath and began writing something at the top of his paper.
