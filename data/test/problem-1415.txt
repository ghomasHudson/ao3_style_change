Harry could do nothing but obey her even as the very thought of food churned his belly like one of the Weasley’s Puking Pastilles. Harry politely nibbled on a piece of cheese, snatching it from under the hot glare of Draco. Mouselike, quick and cautious in his movements.
“Harry!” a blur of hair rushed forward only to be stopped by Draco’s hand. “Errrrr.” Dumbfounded, Hermione looked at the foreign pale hand smack in the middle of her chest. The smoothness offsetting the coarse wool of her sweater. When Hermione no longer posed a threat of barreling into Harry’s unsteady frame, Draco retracted his restraining hand.
“Go back to sleep, Little One.” He said with subtle command and a quick kiss to his forehead. And, to his surprise, Harry did and he was grateful Draco had taken the decision from him.
locking charms on the door. No one dared to question her caution and Luna felt comforted by the fact that Pansy had included her and Hermione in her vigilance.
“Um…” Harry had no idea how to warn her about being inadvertently truth serum-ed. “Do you know of the Unburdening Potion? I think Sn… Professor Snape created it. I’ve had a dose. There are some unusual side effects. Are you familiar?” He lifted up his hand and twirled it slow.
Snape’s advice of avoidance was turning out to be sound reasoning. So, Harry leaned his head against the tense spine in front of him. He was not hiding so much as he was being prudent. To evade not tearing into Ronald Weasley. As much as he wanted to, Harry was sure this would solve nothing, only create more problems.
Harry, who never said anything heartfelt unless it was entirely important, was staring at her with beseeching and bewitching eyes. His focus unlike she had ever seen before. What they were doing was important. Hermione was the first. The example. The pioneer of exodus. And here she was questioning him when she should be doing what she had always done. Trusting him even when he led her into danger. Only, this time he was leading her away from danger. The unnaturalness of inaction was interfering with her emotions and her logic, colliding the two. Intertwining them like lovers, or the seaweed in the Black lake. Hermione was unsure which was the more apt analogy.
“You cannot blame yourself, Granger.” Draco told her in a way that brook no argument. “You may be bright,” he admitted, “but you are not omniscient. Plus, Harry is by far the most reticent Gryffindor to exist.”
Harry was positive he would not be able to sleep no matter how exhausted his mind and body were. But, he enjoyed listening to the screetch of the quill tips and the quiet mutters of his studious friend. It was nice to be able to rely on a friend on a cold dark winter night.
When he lifted his head, Harry expected to see the familiar sneer of Petunia’s or the gleam of a promise of pain like Umbridge. Instead, he saw the quiver of Lady Malfoy’s chin and the sheen of tears in her stormy gray eyes, so very much like Draco’s at this point, Harry could not tell any difference. Her dark lips were turned down in a sad little smile.
“Where, if I may inquire, are your new… house guests?” Severus asked, ignoring the delightfully seething boy, “And Draco?”
After they were dressed, Draco handed Harry a Nutrition Potion from the chest Snape had provided. It set atop Draco’s dresser like an impromptu apothecary. Harry eyed it curiously but otherwise wished for Draco to remain in charge of its contents.
Harry rushed down the steps, dizzy with the effort. The pain was growing. His dose of the Unburdening wearing off leaving him gasping for each breath. Harry grit his teeth and cast a wordless, wandless Silencio. There was no time to linger. Fetching Neville had taken the better part of an hour.
“If that is all, I’ll see myself out.” Severus bowed to the room departing with billowing robes. He left behind a rather large wooden case full of potions.
and the warm possessive touching had. Was Draco Malfoy his boyfriend now? Was that a thing Harry could have? Or do? Have a boyfriend he could snog whenever the mood struck (particularly when the morning light filtered through the drapes illuminating the height and strength of Draco’s cheekbones and the length of his golden lashes.)
“Take these.” Severus shrunk the fully packed case for Draco to pocket. “Fire call when you get there. I will visit as soon as I am able.” Snape promised. Draco sighed in defeat. “Winter Solstice is coming soon. You will see me then. Plus, your young man will need a continuous supply of my work to overcome the long-term malnourishment.”
“The promise,” Narcissa stared into Lucius’s confused face, searching. She did not know what she hoped to find. “was to protect Draco at all costs.” She reminded him, pleased when the angry red faded to a sweaty pallor. Narcissa hated to do it, but at times like these, needs must. “which you have failed to do.”
Narcissa was not sure if it had all been a ruse. Lucius’s devotion after the Dark Lord’s misfortunes. A way to pass the time before his return? A passing fancy? Lucius had spent considerable time and attention on both his wife and son. The Malfoy’s were a tight little family soaking in the gregarious devotion of a doting father and husband. The kind of husband every little witch wished upon stars for.
. Like you always do. I can’t help you trapped here with Umbitch breathing breathing down our necks.”
“Oh Hermione, don’t.” Harry pleaded softly. He flung his cloak into the snow, wrapping his arms around his friend. “I’ll see you first thing.” He promised into her neck. Hermione let out one quiet sob and nodded in agreement.
He wasn’t sleepy and he wasn’t hungry having never eaten so much in his life, and consuming the heavy Nutrient Potions faithfully to appease both Malfoys and the absent Professor Snape, his stomach felt uncomfortably bloated again for a whole hour after lunch. He tried to read but his eyes hurt too much to continue. And he missed Draco. Harry tried to wait. To be patient. To be good and stay in bed.
Harry studied her for a moment out of curiosity, accepting the cup of tea she poured with a murmured “Thanks.” Professor McGonagall stayed cool under his scrutiny. Her austere face was relaxed in her own territory. Harry had a bad feeling he was going to change that.
“I can literally hear you thinking.” Draco’s voice was rough from sleep. His blonde hair was sticking up on the soft pillows as he lay flat on his back with an arm around Harry anchoring the smaller boy to his surprisingly broad bare chest. Harry had never cuddled another human being much less shared a bed with anyone but Ron (who hogged the blankets, snored, and kicked viciously if Harry accidentally touched him).
“Then I should hold a grudge too.” Harry said thoughtfully, cocking his head to the side unknowing how adorable the movement made him.
“Not particularly.” Draco answered with full honesty. His hand left the dark head to trace a delicate path down the length of Harry’s spine, leaving goosebumps in his wake.
“Draco, dear, come sit.” Narcissa patted the plush sofa, smoothing the crushed fabric with her capable manicured hands.
“My mother is different.” Draco said kindly. “You should tell Snape about this. He will want to catalog the side-effects when he takes it on the market.
Snape sneered “For derogatory language.” The Slytherin ignored the surprised expressions on his students’ faces. “And another 50 points for violence. Ms. Granger, I am surprised by your behavior. Detention. Tonight. 7 pm.”
wasn’t right, which, was more irritating than painful. So, Harry lay on his back on the softest mattress he had ever experienced, wide awake and counting Draco’s light snores. He wore one of Dudley’s oversized tee shirts after a row with Draco.
, was the desperate thought resounding in his brain with he gasped for breath, bent over in the dank and dirty Riddle Manor. The Dark Lord realized another piece of his soul was in jeopardy right before he blacked out, crumpling to the floor like a sack of flesh and bone. Lucius found him unconscious on the dingy carpet and levitated him into a freshly made bed where he remained for days before he had the strength to rise. To eat. To bathe. The smallest of actions causing a wave of pain to ripple from his sternum to each of his extremities.
Perhaps it was a trick of the soot, a shifting in the ash making her older sister’s sharp angled face soften. Narcissa would not know. “I have to go, Cissa.” Dromeda announced. “It was nice to hear from you after all this time.” With that, the fire-call ended. On a better note than expected. No one flung veiled insults. And her sister never refused to help. A blossom of hope bloomed in Narcissa’s heart.
Bushy hair erupted out of the darkness followed by a pretty and intelligent face. A face, drawn pale from the frozen air. Narcissa tsked, the sound amplified down the empty village alley. They would have to hurry before anyone came to investigate. Narcissa reaffirmed her determination when Harry Potter’s unruly hair floated alongside Ms. Granger’s. He smiled shyly at Narcissa, warming her heart just like he had in Severus’ office.
” He continued as he unbuttoned Harry’s oversized trousers, yanking the pants down with gentle force until both boys stood in their underthings. Harry had stopped resisting, suddenly finding the Herringbone inlay fascinating while trying to make himself small.
“Harry,” Lady Malfoy finally spoke during a lull in conversation. “You should eat something, darling.” She was watching him with that certain look. The one he wasn’t sure how to name. It wasn’t disgust which had often graced Aunt Petunia’s face. Nor was it malice like Uncle Vernon. Lady Malfoy’s face was calm but not indifferent like Dudley and no where close to gleefully sadistic like Aunt Marge.
McGonagall’s face paled. Her thin skin resembling parchment. Harry knew she was older, elderly almost. This was the first time she had looked aged. He also felt no particular need to say this out loud. “I can assure you, Mr. Potter, I am unaware of how you acquired your injuries.” She said coolly. “I’m also aware you have a tendency for privacy about certain matters and I have never been one to pry.” She said in a decidedly warmer tone. “Would you like to tell me?”
“I know.” Hermione sympathized, surprising him with how genuine she sounded. He had been wrong last night thinking she had no bedside manner. “Let’s go.” She urged, again surprising him with a kiss to his cheek with quick dry lips.
Harry blink owlishly at the creature dressed in a clean and pressed pink pillowcase. He was too used to Dobby’s behavior to rationalize the quietly respectful demeanor of this
Harry was not buying their protests. A deep soaking tiredness penetrated his bones. He felt more than tired, he felt weary. And hungry. And his ribs (but not his ribs because they were healed) still ached deep inside. Harry nodded at Lady Malfoy while she stared him down. Not as an agreement to what she said, more as an acknowledgement that he had heard her even if he did disagree.
With as much control as he could muster, Harry spoke softly. “You’ve also ignored me. Every summer. When the Dursley’s were at their worst. You have doubted my sanity. Called me a Liar. Too many times to count. Or, and honestly this is kicker,” he laughed humorlessly. “ended our friendship because you thought I put my name in the goblet of fire. I could have forgiven you. Was already there, until I heard you with the guys yesterday.”
Before Ron could erupt again, Harry peaked around the unmoving Draco. “I’m really, very hungry.” he blurted out, enjoying the way his head of house’s mouth hung slack and surprised. Harry, as close as he was, felt more than heard Draco huff out a laugh. Harry caught sight of his friend and went back to the position between Draco’s shoulder blades. Ron’s angry face was just too much to bear. Harry recognized the stubborn, unreasonable freckled set of features having seen them far too often. Once again, Harry had somehow betrayed his friend.
“I take it this is part of the side effects?” she mused with pursed lips. Harry found his cheeks hot, burning with embarrassment. He had no idea why.
Beneath the shouts, the murmuring gossips, the worried whispers and the inaudible gasps, the slap continued to echo throughout the great hall. Harry was upset to have missed it. His former best friend’s face was deathly pale in comparison to the rapidly reddening handprint decorating his cheek. Harry knew exactly how such a hit felt and the addlepation that followed. Ron’s mouth was opening and closing like a landed fish.
Narcissa put her musings aside once the two witches reached the West Library. Inside, a fire had already been lit with a little table laden with tea and biscuits. Minsy was always quick and competent. Ms. Granger eyed the tea service speculatively while removing her school cloak. Narcissa showed her where to hang it near the fire to hasten drying. Lady Malfoy added her own cloak to the second hook.
“Try me.” Draco smirked, finally looking down with the same self-assuredness Harry had always mistook as arrogance. Harry did not argue further. He could not. Not when he
schedule for the future entrepreneurs and prankster duo, the boredom and anxiety set in once again. Though the two should not be compatible, apparently Harry could be both at once. Lucky him.
Though, Draco recalled Hermione’s school record. And her wicked right cross. He concluded both girls could take care of themselves. Harry’s worries were unfounded. A personality trait, Draco suspected. A weakness, he had once thought. Now, the Slytherin was not so sure. He marveled at Harry’s ability to care about any person at all with how often he had been betrayed.
Harry slowly made his way to Gryffindor Tower. The corridors were occupied with Umbridge’s Inquisitorial squad, even with the lateness of the hour. Harry did his best to stay quiet and
“What did you hear?” Ron asked suspiciously, his face flushing from the neck up. A clear sign of his guilt.
be deliciously cautious. And for the most part, Severus enjoyed the battle of wills even if the brat ruined the fun by letting his temper outweigh his self-preservation. Snape glared back at the brat as per their habit, purposefully ignoring the memory of the tiny broken and hurting boy trembling on his office settee. His feelings may have changed regarding the Potter spawn, but his methods had not.
“Fully healed Sir.” The boy said sullenly. He was clearly still upset. No matter, still a better course of action than to let the teenager stew in misery.
“Follow me, Ms. Granger.” Narcissa instructed to Hermione. While the foyer had been dark in spite of the fire, the entrance had exuded inviting warmth. The hallways, however, proved to be unwelcoming and cold. Narcissa hated to linger. She made her way up the stairs quickly, conscious of the silent muggleborn following. The marbled hallways were dim and foreboding. Narcissa made a note to make time to change the hauntingly cold aesthetic. Her timeline had been greatly altered by Draco’s frantic firecall. She had hoped to have the Manor ready before the children arrived. And to know the exact number to expect. Narcissa liked to be prepared and coordinate for the least possible confusion. Chaos did not reign while Narcissa was in charge.
There is a lot of shifting pov from the same character. it's a little chaotic. This was mostly done on purpose. Voldemort is still insane in it though he feels if things have changed...
“Believe me when I tell you,” Lady Malfoy caught his eye, held them there with her intense focus. “You will find justice.” She promised. “And” she used a sharp pointed black lacquered nail to lift his chin. “I will keep you safe.” Her eyes remained wide and unblinking. Hypnotic. Staring deep into Harry’s very soul. Something dark and cold unfurled with the warmth her words provoked.
“Whyyyyyy.” Harry whined forlornly when his arms trembled with the effort to lift the water to his lips. And his hand was on absolute fire sitting limp in his lap. Even breathing hurt with his ribs protesting each inhale, each exhale.
“Ummmmm.” Harry delayed answering, mostly because he could not remember when he last used his wand outside of class. Also, he did not want her to take it from him, even if he did not need it. “It’s probably in my trunk.” He sheepishly answered.
exactly what he was thing. Harry returned her smile, his own weak and sickly. He just could not find it in himself to smile. Or do anything but admire his plate filled with Treacle Tart. The desert was downright tantalizing and if it weren’t for the pit in his stomach, he was sure it would be the best he’d ever had.
“And we will. Please, ‘Mione. We don’t have much time. I love you too much to let her get her nasty little claws into you.”
“Helpful little thing.” Draco teased. Before Harry could retort, he found they had arrived at the portrait of the Fat Lady. “Try to get some sleep. I’ll help you with the silencing charm tomorrow.” Draco promised.
George fluttered his eyelashes at the younger boy, flirtatious and teasing. Harry could not be sure if Draco moved closer to him or if it were a trick of the imagination.
“I forgot.” He said dumbly. “I forgot about your prejudices.” He clarified to Draco’s dumbfounded look. Harry took another step away when Draco rolled his eyes and reached out again. “you… you… can’t…” Harry was getting worked up and short of breath, panting. His mind and his body at war with his needs.
“Are you ready?” Draco asked brusquely. The tall dark boy sitting at their desk looked startled for a moment after their door opened on its own. The look was quickly hid behind a blank handsome facade. Draco wasted no time revealing himself. He investigated his side of the room and was please to find Blaise had taken care of packing all his belongings.
“What you need… is rest. And a calm environment so your core can replenish itself. It will be boring, not being able to rush off into idiotic behavior, but it should be painless. I understand this will be hard for you to acknowledge any… vulnerability,” Severus spat the word knowing full well he would also be hellbent to do such a thing. “but… your pride can surely be put aside if you want to Retain Your Magic.” Snape was yelling as he clipped out the words.
“Harry would like to sit with the Slytherins today.” Draco announced smoothly. Not that it was unheard of for one house to sit with another. But Harry Potter sitting with the Slytherins was another matter entirely. Harry was not paying any attention to the uproar Draco’s announcement caused, instead, he was comparing the memories of the scathingly judgmental Draco of the past to the more confident and soothing sounds of his voice today. Harry sighed. His world had, once again, tilted on its axis.
“I won’t let him hurt you.” Draco promised. His storm gray eyes were trained on Ron, unblinkingly focused. Harry nodded.
“Can’t he stay?” The boy asked, only a little panic showing. Still, his big green watery eyes broke her heart that much further.
“I can’t take this anymore.” Draco announced as he cancelled the silencing bubble. “Why are you freaking out?” He asked Harry, turning the smaller boy’s attention.
He found out later, much later, Lucius had devised a plan to bring him back. Really, it had been the only thing to save Lord Malfoy from an untimely death. Doubly, it proved all along Lucius had been a faithful servant. More faithful than Pettigrew and his simpering fear-based pandering. And when Voldemort learned it was the boy to destroy his soul piece? Well, honestly, it was only fitting. The boy was proving his mettle just as he was ensuring his ultimate demise. The Dark Lord could only admire a boy so adept to surviving, wasn’t that exactly what he had done himself? And to defeat a fully grown Basilisk at a mere 12 years? Astounding. It was clear why the Potter brat was marked as his
she contemplated silently. “Come in.” Narcissa instructed, giving them both a pleased smile when they complied.
“You really have so much to learn.” The Malfoy Heir smirked. “Now, what to wear?” He stood in front of his closet, tapping a finger to his chin.
“I cannot leave the school, Draco, I won’t say it again.” Severus’s sigh was heavy with frustration. Draco accepted his annoyance with practiced ease.
“I see you’ve found your shoes.” Harry said after cancelling his silencing charm. He uncloaked only his head with a teasing grin. Luna smiled back at him soft and indulgent.
Harry flinched hard enough to fall on the stone floor, not prepared for the blinding spike of pain shooting through his skull. Ron stood over him panting, though he had hardly moved and for the first time, Harry felt fear akin to the fear he felt for the Dursleys. And this toward his best mate, his first friend. Infuriated to be brought to such a place, Harry jumped back to his feet, ignoring the twinge of his ribs, the throb of his hand.
What would it be like to hug someone without fear of being stabbed in the back? Or pushed away? Pansy was not sure which scenario would be worse. She shrugged off her contemplation by blatantly cracking her neck and rounding up the Gryffindor duo, a budding seer and her snake brethren. “Draco,” she half whined. “I’m starved.”
“Has he been dosed?” Draco asked while trying to maneuver the suddenly clingy boy to sit between them. Harry was low key refusing to let go until, with transparent frustration, Severus ordered him to:
“Who doesn’t?” Fred Weasley said jovially and with an exaggerated hazel wink. He plopped down on one side of Hermione.
“Now, now,” the other one said, and she was pretty sure he was Fred. “none of that.” He admonished wiping a tear off her cheek. She had not even been aware she was crying.
The thing was… Harry knew he was safe. He did not know how he knew. It wasn’t like Divination had taught him anything. And he had not picked up Luna’s
“Three days ago, we could hardly stand in the same room together.” Harry said flatly with a little inelegant snort.
Draco needed to keep Harry’s prize possession safe just as he felt the need to keep the boy safe. Added to all that, the bulk of the three silent nearly full-grown teenagers made maneuvering down the castle corridors tricky. Then there was the distance from the dungeons to the seventh story walk up on the other side of Hogwarts, their travel time took longer than previous two trips combined. Still, they arrived just after 5 a.m. with plenty of time to rest before entering the tunnels which lead to Hog’s Head Tavern.
That hurt, mean whisper of Draco’s pride was silenced entirely and his heart felt full to bursting. Draco returned the embrace, wrapping Harry up, relishing how he could tuck the smaller boy in close and smell his own shampoo wafting off the dark unruly hair. Following instinct, Draco bent his neck and kissed the soft tufts. Harry shivered and clung tighter.
The eight students waited, mostly in silence until dawn crept unseen beyond the castle walls. The time stretched until all too soon the group went one by one into the tunnel. Harry lit the way, leading them in the dark and Draco wondered if this was what his new life would entail. Following Harry Potter into the unknown. He did not have time to dwell. The Portkey started buzzing just as the burst through to a sleepy Hog’s Head tavern. The morning light flittering in from the dirty windows highlighting the warped wooden floor in a dance of dust and sunlight.
to say things. Or feel no reason not to?” he theorized. “I never called Ron a piece of shite even though he is one. And, I didn’t yell at McGonagall when she stonewalled me on a resorting. And I definitely unloaded on Lady Malfoy, and Draco, and Snape. Which I probably should not have done.”
“As you should.” Draco shot them a grateful grimacing look with undertones of smugness. The Malfoy Heir was a complex man, in their opinion. “You’re freezing.” Draco said, taking Harry’s hands, being extra careful not to put too much pressure on the injured one.
“Thursday.” Draco said flatly. His face was just as stormy as his eyes. A veritable thundercloud. Harry did not want to continue the conversation. He just did not see the point. “Are you telling me you haven’t slept since Thursday, Harry.” Harry, not Potter. The way Draco said his name caused goosebumps to rise beneath the borrowed supple green shirt.
“Yeah. Um… Yes ma’am.” Harry agreed. “All I’ve done is sleep.” He said sheepishly. “And read.” He frowned.
“I’m glad you told me Harry.” She sniffled. “Drink this.” Hermione said, holding a gray metal canister. The kind muggles use to camp. “Drink as much as you like, it’s charmed to never run out.”
“Are you Dragon?” she asked bluntly, well aware of her son’s mercurial mood when it came to The-Boy-Who-Lived.
“I need to speak with our cousin.” Narcissa said directly. Time was of the essence. She had not liked leaving the boys at Hogwarts. Snape would protect them as best he could, but even Severus could not devote the time and care needed in this delicate situation.
Harry’s only respite were when his friends would come to check on him. Or during Lunch and Dinner where Draco would make a fun picnic atmosphere in the middle of the bed and feed him crackers and fruit pieces and slices of meat. By hand. With people there. And really only Blaise and Pansy gave them strange looks while the twins cooed and Hermione look eminently pleased with herself. Luna and Neville smiled at him reassuringly. Because it was abundantly clear Harry had no idea what to make of the whole situation. And he was definitely not going to question anything when he
“You are a smart wizard, Lucius, I’m sure you already know.” Done with his theatrics, Narcissa turned back to her letters.
They landed inside the wards of the estate with an echoing bang. “Easy there, Ms. Granger.” Narcissa smoothed a loose curl from the girl’s flushed cheek. “If you are going to vomit, I suggest the grass.” Hermione laughed despite the very real possibility she might lose her dinner. “Or, if you would rather, just inside, there is a hideous vase from my mother-in-law. Absolutely terrible taste.” Narcissa led them to the warmth of the Manor.
“In the future, I want to hear you to say that again. For an entirely different reason.” Draco said seductively dark, leaning down so no one else could hear. His slim body was positively rigid. Harry turned his attention to the Slytherin, snuggling in closer for as long as he was allowed.
“Are you questioning my authority, missy?” Professor Umbridge implored, cocking her head to the side like a curious, heinous little kitten. Hermione felt a violence rage up inside. She palmed the quill as if it were a dagger.
“And you, Mr. Weasley, will be sure to keep your hands off other students as well. Detention tomorrow night for physically removing Ms. Granger from her seat without her explicit permission.”
She slipped it around the boy, smoothing the unseen material into place. “Hurry back dear boy.” Narcissa ordered. She softened the demand with an impromptu kiss to his temple, surprising both the Gryffindors. “before my son worries himself to despair.”
He was the only child she was to conceive. Her body was willing but unable to complete any other pregnancies to term. All the scans and all the mediwitches confirmed what she had always known. And Lucius’s devotion to their only son swayed her to stay after the Dark Lord fell.
“But you are still in pain.” Lady Malfoy questioned with a sharp voice and eyebrow raised. Her light sent of roses incongruent with deep burgundy lipstick.
“Draco.” Narcissa said with an air of nonchalance to dispel any notion that she was suddenly absolutely furious. “Would you give us the room?”
“What’s done is done.” Lady Malfoy stood, turning to look down at Harry in a way Draco was unfamiliar with. If he had to guess, he would have said she resembled one of the Valkyrie in the old stories. “You’re under my care now, Harry and you’ll be treated like the gift you are.” To which the brave little Gryffindor tucked his face back into Draco’s chest, breath hot and panting against his shirt.
Draco Malfoy readied himself outside of his mother’s study. He squared his broad shoulder and lifted his slightly pointed chin up with his nose in the air in a close imitation of his father, having seen the man do so his entire life. Draco took a deep breath. And then another. And then another, clenching and relaxing his long-fingered hands until finally, he knocked on the door as etiquette dictates.
It was grander than the Great Hall with high ceilings and floating chandeliers, each lit like the students were honored guests. The House Elves had laid out a feast for the teenagers. Luna was the first to dive into her sticky toffee pudding out of the bone fine, gold embellished dish. Harry winced when a crumb found its way onto the magically white linens. Luna sent him an ethereal smile, the kind where he
“There is no way I would trust they are not tampered with. In person only Draco.” Something in his voice eased Draco’s tension. And while he did not want to leave his godfather behind, Draco was well aware of how stubborn the older man could be. He left Severus’s office under the cloak and filled with a heady mix of anticipation and dread.
I want to thank each and everyone of you for opening, reading, commenting, kudoing and bookmarking. I seriously had no intentions for this being anymore than just a little ficlette to keep the juicing flowing. So seriously, THANK YOU!!!!
“Focillo” Narcissa whispered aiming the spell toward the teenagers. Twin sighs of relief blessed the winter night. The temporary warming ceasing the worst of their shivers. “Come Miss Granger.” Narcissa commanded, opening her arm in invitation.
“We understand.” Said George. Hermione was almost positive he was George. The posture was a smidge different and his tone gentler than Fred’s.
often giving her comfort and the lessons from her no-nonsense mother still flickering flames in the back of her mind. But now, as she lay as still as possible she felt a frisson of shivers dancing up and down her spine, unfamiliar and
Draco snorted with affection. “I’m well aware.” He faked a shudder and Pansy felt it was safe to let her hand fall away from his neck. He would be compliant. “Harry’s core is depleted from the blood quill. “ Draco explained, each word more terse with anger. “Umbitch was siphoning his magic.” The last part said between clenched white teeth.
“Why does it even matter.” The boy was back to slumping, already defeated by the idea of sharing pertinent information. His body language was closed off, small, as if he was willing himself to disappear. It was fitting the boy inherited an invisibility cloak. The two adults watched as he backed away to sit on the sofa. A step up from the floor.
“Ms. Granger.” Professor Umbridge chirped in a wholly unpleasant manner, “You’ll be serving detention with me tonight.”
“You look rested.” Narcissa said, hiding her smile behind her teacup when he whipped his dark head around in surprise.
“Are you alright?” The blonde lifted his torso to loom above Harry. A solid dark blurry mass of almost a man. Harry sighed again, this time about the loss of Draco’s touch.
“Magical Mediterranean Water Plants and Their Properties.” Harry picked up the book from under the cloak giving it the illusion of floating.
“Impertinent brat.” She sassed back and breathed a sigh of relief when Harry leaned back, snuggling into her with an unrepentant grin.
His large warm hands were like ghosts on her shoulders. The way his calloused palms caught on her sweater when he tugged her back into his own space in the Come and Go Room. She had drifted off to dreams remembering.
“You like it.” Hermione teased. Narcissa watched the girl’s mood drop once more. Big crystal tears threatening to freeze on her rounded cheeks.
Pain was a sharp hiss of breath followed by an empty hollow despair. The ache grew and grew beneath his very bones and threatened to dislodge all his remaining organs. His skin felt like ash and flakey even though he had finally been able to restore this body into something less… snakelike. While Nagini’s venom had kept him alive, it, when combined with residual unicorn blood had some… adverse… side effects.
Harry settled lightly on his shoulders, a responsibility he would gladly acquire. The Gryffindor’s wardrobe had much to be desired, though, in hindsight, Draco realized it was not Harry’s fault.
“Harry’s magical core is nearly depleted.” She flicked her eyes back to the boy and then again to Severus.
The seventh-floor corridor was the only empty hallway in the castle, foreboding with its blank wall. Neville had to help Harry up the last few steps then propped him up against the wall to pace back and forth and back until the door appeared. The action was reckless, but Harry was too winded to protest. He had to gather his strength prepared take off running once Neville was safely inside. Harry caught a glimpse of Draco’s furious face searching the hallway through the open doorway. A longing welled up in Harry. He wished he could join the Slytherin. To lean on him. To depend on him. However, Harry knew he could not do any of those things. Ron’s betrayal was too fresh, and this truce was too new. Harry could not trust it.
“Ugh. You are absolutely Ridiculous!” Draco’s voice had taken a screeching edge mixed with an incongruent primal growl. The Slytherin Prince was in a rage when Harry was revealed, shaking and sweaty, nearly sick with exhaustion. Luna had taken many steps back away from the fuming Draco only stopping when she bumped into Neville. The tall Gryffindor held her in place with two large hands on either shoulder. Harry squinted at the partial embrace speculatively. Neville and he were going to be having a discussion when things settled down.
Mere moments passed before Hermione was seated in the disgustingly pink room, at the delicate little desk with a piece of parchment and a black quill in hand.
The twins had proven to be a lively distraction as they had an excellent command of debate with their practice of twin speak. Luna’s airy voice was unwelcome. His indecision was short lived when both twins and surprisingly, Longbottom, sent him scowls. Draco scoffed. Loony Lovegood might be a seer,
“Yes, good idea. Showers!” Draco agreed sniffing his own odor. Harry went first, with a grateful little smile, giving Draco time to choose an outfit.
Harry sighed, blowing a strand of hair off his face. The sigh was harder than he had intended and roused Draco from his slumber. The exact opposite of what Harry wanted.
“Maybe you should’ve been sorted into Slytherin.” Harry moaned, knowing full well she had played on his weakness. He would never abandoned her. Instead of taking offense, Hermione barked out a laugh.
“Yeah Ron, I have not idea what’s that is like.” Harry snarked. “You only just kick me out when I’m having a nightmare. And then you treat me like a crazy person for being upset.”
“I can assure you, young lady, I do not joke about detention.” Professor Umbridge was not amused by Hermione’s behavior. Her beady little eyes narrowed further. “If you will gather your things and follow me.”
“Did you not almost get expelled for underage magic at the beginning of the year?” Draco asked out of pure curiosity.
“Contrary to popular belief, I do know how to share.” Draco said dryly. Harry gave him a dubious look. In the end, he needed to jump to get into the bed. He was all awkward limbs and blushes while Draco helped him get settled beneath the covers. Draco joined him, ignoring the squawking when Harry was made the small spoon.
Sharing a bed with another human being was… hot, and not in the sexy way. Harry felt damp with sweat and thirsty for a cool glass of water. Still, the rise and fall of Draco’s chest was how Harry imagined swimming in the ocean felt. And the warm skin beneath his fingertips was like silk with Draco’s heartbeat was a strong and steady, unlike Harry’s own, which always threatened to race or skip or stop with each new adventure.
Their jaunt to the professor’s storeroom was a quick walk. The halls at such an early hour were dark and empty with only the sounds of their heels echoing down the hall. Even the paintings were quiet. Snape used wandless magic to unlock the new wards. Draco knew Snape had installed them after the Triwizard Tournament. The door swung open in a ghostly manner.
the restructured dynamic. Which may be his stupidest idea since commandeering Lockhart into the Chamber of Secrets.
“Yes, well…” clearly Snape had not expected Draco to address him thusly. He had, if fact, expected an argument. Or, at least, an impertinent sneer. When none came his entire thought process halted, however, he rallied quickly. “Harry requires bedrest for the time being. Absolutely no use of magic.” Snape said to his little nemesis firmly.
“Professor Umbridge was siphoning Harry’s magic.” She told Severus firmly, daring him to argue. “I’m surprised he is even able to walk much less cast a spell. I am…” she paused, “hesitant to test his abilities.”
“Mother.” Draco greeted Narcissa. She smiled at him fond and loving. Something had upset her boy. She could see it all over his pinched pale face. And the white of his knuckles on his free hand. She suspected it had something to do with the blank face of Harry Potter, whose eyes only shown curiosity.
Pansy was only partially assured. A small part of her would never believe the lack of danger, knowing better than most how deceptive “safe” could be only to  be burned in the end. She eyed Luna’s ethereal glow in the darkness. The girl was curled up facing the Slytherin with unblinking blue eyes. It was eerie even if Pansy appreciated her unflinching stare.
“Will not reflect any choices you have made. My son will find his own destiny. I will support him, and his decisions and you will have no say in the matter.” Narcissa flared her power at her husband, something she was never prone to do in all the years they had been married. It shone in her eyes, as gray and stormy as her son’s could ever be. Lucius gasped at the quiet display and took a step back. Good, she had his full attention. “You will also destroy that nasty bit of parchment you had drawn up after your conversation with Draco at the end of summer.”
“I’m ready.” He said, reverting to the familiar, the acquiesce of punishment so often doled out at the Dursleys. He no longer had the stone walls of Hogwarts to protect him. Not that he had ever been truly safe within the corridors. Still, before Umbridge, punishment for infractions had been detention. Meaningless time-consuming task,
“Why is that Ravenclaw girl staring at you and crying?” Draco sounded genuinely perplexed. Harry looked up quick then back down at his still full plate. Odd. He was sure he had already eaten some apple slices. Draco nudged him for an answer. Harry had none to give.
the resentment and the only thing she ever heard from Harry was confusion hovering beneath his willingness to accept her. She was valuable to him as a friend and she did not need to
“When was the last time you slept, Potter.” Draco asked, stormy eyes drowning out the levity. Pansy shot a sharp glance to her housemate, with narrowed eyes that belied curiosity and some concern.
She had been blindsided by his gentle attention and had spent the next few hours trying to force the
… but I will try to be whatever you need me to be.” Draco’s sincerity was like another warm blanket.
“What was that for?” Harry did not pull away while Hermione shook her head, lips pinched tightly shut.
So basically, par for the course that was Harry’s life. He held back from rolling his eyes out of respect for her and her expertise. Mostly because Harry felt extremely lucky Lady Malfoy was willing to share her knowledge with him. And her home. He did not deserve either. Uncle Vernon’s lesson about freaks using the furniture reverberated in his head on the way to the spacious dining room.
Harry was a light bundle of “oomph” when he barreled into Draco with a complete lack of grace. His thin arms like bands under Draco’s armpits, cold nose pressed firmly into Draco’s sternum blatantly inhaling his scent. Luckily, Draco had enough grace for both and caught the smaller boy before any damage could occur.
Draco did not waste any time. “Potter’s Unburdening will be wearing off soon.” He announced coolly. He registered his professor’s surprise and wondered at it.
The arrival of Hermione was not chaotic as much as it was rushed. Draco had vehemently insisted the young woman leave the school tonight. Narcissa knew this was for Harry’s benefit and not any regard her son held for the intelligent muggleborn. Harry could be heard voicing one horrible possibility after another, having lost complete control of the Unburdening and his imagination. Draco had ordered him multiple times to stop pacing Severus’s office. Her son had a worried, pinched face, distorting his aristocratic angles, his attention mostly on the unseen boy-who-lived. Narcissa insisted he not worry and outlined the quick modification to the original plan.
Draco did not hesitate to enter as he had spent many hours with Snape after class. Learning. Observing. And absolutely not touching anything after the first accidental dose of Alihotsy Draught. Hysterical laughter was not a state Draco preferred. Quite the opposite, in fact. Why anyone would brew the damn thing, Draco would never know.
witch of her age.” Luna quoted leaving him to wonder when his friends had become so sassy. First Neville and now Luna?
Harry wanted to believe her. To trust. It always came down to trust. Harry dropped his gaze back to the floor, unable to look her in the eye when he could not take her at her word. She should not make promises she could not keep.
“The use of a blood quill is illegal.” Hermione stated emphatically. There was no way in Hades she was going to use the thing. Its dark magic made every goosebumps on her neck prickle and sizzle. A riotous nausea boiled in her belly. She was not going to obey this odious woman!
“Cissa.” Her sister admonished. “You should know better. Sirius Black is a wanted criminal. I do not know of his whereabouts.”
“Of course, ‘Mione.” Harry replied with the sweetest reassuring smile. “You can’t get rid of me that easily.”
“Harry!” Ron yelled. “You’re injured!” as if he were unaware. His friend thoughtlessly grabbed the bandaged hand. Harry could no hold back the pained gasp which morphed into an embarrassingly loud squeak when a certain blonde Slytherin reached around Harry, squeezing Ron’s arm right above the wrist until Harry was free. Then somehow Harry was twirled around to find himself staring at Draco’s broad shoulders. When did they get so large? Harry thought, luckily not letting the words spill out of his lips.
“Very well,” Snape acknowledged, letting the younger man into his sitting room. “Sit down. I’ll be a few moments.”
“Your mother says my magic core is empty.” Harry said in a dull flat voice. Magic had been his saving grace and now, Lady Malfoy was saying his gift was gone.
“I can’t fucking believe you are going to run to McGonagall about this.” Ron yelled. “You fucking coward.” He yelled to Harry’s retreating back.
“Yes Draco?” Harry inquired when Draco did not say anything else. He was hesitant to lift his head. The stares had been few but piercing. Their little tableau had drawn much attention. Harry could not find it in himself to care as long as he kept his head down. Draco was too busy trying to convince Harry to eat the oatmeal since there were a disturbing lack of pancakes. And Hermione was diligently reading the tiny print of the ingredients on the nutrient potions Snape had provided.
The table was also laid out with roast beef sandwiches, fish and chips, and a charcuterie board of apple slices and cheese which Draco glared at when he wasn’t trying to catch Harry’s eye. Lady Malfoy urged her son to eat his favorite snack only leaving him be when she saw Harry was also not eating.
“No, Ma’am.” Harry denied. “It’s not that I don’t ‘believe’ you.” He qualified. “You don’t have to protect me. I can take care of myself.” He said with conviction. A memory of Cedric Diggory's cold dead stare haunting him still.
Luna now found herself in a new situation with no experience on how to extract herself from her companions without disturbing them. Not that there wasn’t enough room in the bed, it’s luxuriousness matched it’s massiveness. Since she could not leave and the demands of her body functions were not dire, Luna took the time to think about how Pansy had said they should stick together even though trust between houses was nonexistent. Luna
“Yeah.” Harry agreed sheepishly. “He accused me of being in Voldemort’s pocket last night. As if I would side with the man who killed my parents.”
Not edited: my time is limited. I promise to get to any mistakes if and when necessary. please enjoy!
“You have plenty of time to tell me all about it while we get the manner ready. Hold on tight.” Narcissa once again lifted her arm to make room for the younger woman to step into. Hermione obediently let Lady Malfoy wrap an arm around her waist. Then, with a crack, they were gone from the empty streets of a frozen midnight Hogsmead.
“Reading.” Harry repeated the word with protest. Both Severus and Narcissa looked at him reproachfully until finally he sighed in resignation. “Fine.” He agreed mulishly. “
“I’m afraid I must request another hug.” She admitted, the emotions in her voice uncontrolled and warbling.
“Why are you crying, sweet boy.” Lady Malfoy asked. She was perched on the edge of her desk chair, half on, half off as if she were not sure she should get up or not. Harry was familiar with the awkward position of her body. He had been in it often enough himself. She was uncomfortable and he had made he so.
“Hurts.” Harry hated himself for whimpering, all the while enjoying Draco’s cool hands touching his forehead, holding his wrist. Completely juxtapose to the warmth emanating from the taller boy’s solid frame. He was still holding Harry upright.
Blaise, Neville and the Twins raced ahead in an impromptu competition. The group was energetic with pent up energy from the long wait through the night. Luna and Pansy had more reservation, keeping pace with Draco, taking care not to slip on the frozen ground. Luna spent the journey pointing out real estate for dabberblimps to lounge when the snow thawed, and the pond became a humid murky swamp. Apparently, Malfoy Manor grounds were prime for an infestation. Unsure what she was prattling on about, Draco spent the trip enjoying Harry’s stifled giggles of hot breath near his ear. Draco was so focused on each puff; he did not even realize they had reached the front of the Manor until his mother called out.
“Small things mostly.” Harry admitted. “Accio, Alohamora, silencing charms, the Patronus. I have had trouble levitating anything for longer than ten minutes and I’ve not been very successful at setting anything on fire. Mostly I just inhale smoke.” He laughed self-deprecatingly. And my Patronus is all wonky, looks more like a cat than a stag.” He shrugged.
The Slytherin caught him with ease, taking his time to make sure Harry was steady on his feet. “You’re up.” Draco said with a pleased little smile. “Take this.” He brought the blue vial to Harry’s vision. “Snape said only half this time.” He warned. Draco looked upset. “I would’ve gotten it to you sooner…”
There was no mixture of admiration with disappointment like Professor McGonagall or twinkling obfuscation akin to Dumbledore. And she definitely did not resemble Umbridge’s curiously disdainful countenance. No, if Harry had to compare, Lady Malfoy’s expression hovered closer to Madam Pomfrey’s concern with a splash of Snape’s unamused Potion’s lab stare.
Harry illuminated the dark and foreboding corridor. Hermione noticed he was not holding his wand. He would not be able to with the bandages. Instead, a small ball of light floated in front of them leading the way. Hermione was not surprised by his wandless, wordless magic. She was determined he teach her that spell.
“You should sleep, Little One.” Draco groaned again, softly this time, and lay back down. “Come here.” He demanded in that imperious way of his sending shivers down Harry’s skin. With gentle but firm hands, Draco moved Harry into a position where Draco was flush against his back and that petting hand back in place on his chest.
“Perfectly understandable,” Draco lied smoothly. It was a shame the House rivalries existed. Without them, there would be no need for security. No need to fear pranks or worse. No need to be defined for arbitrary and sometimes overlapping personality traits.
Soon thereafter the door opened with swiftness. “Mr. Potter.” Professor McGonagall greeted him politely.
he could not fend off an attack. Not at the moment. Not physically or magically. He was weak. Like a child. Like a
They only walked a few more feet before Hermione began to second guess the situation. “Harry, wait. This is ridiculous. I can’t just leave the school in the middle of the night.” She refused to move forward when he tugged on her hand impatiently.
“Try not to keep me in suspense… Narcissa.” Severus urged when she refrained from continuing. Harry had visibly tensed, his thin hands turning into fists with white knuckles. Narcissa ran her concerned gaze over her companion before turning her attention back to Severus like she was a flower seeking the sun. A shiver ran down his spine.
Draco, true to his word, had not abandoned Harry. He had even come to his defense with a new calmer approach. Completely different then just a few hours earlier. It was mind boggling. Just as watching Draco build Harry a plate of food was outside of the realm of reasonable possibilities. The world had become even stranger than when Harry had been told he was a wizard. Harry, in a moment of insight, decided everyone else could go stuff it. Draco was way more interesting than the nosy student body and the ominous teaching staff. Even when he was being bossy.
“Indeed Miss. Granger.” Narcissa said kindly. “Now,” she pulled Harry into another quick hug before setting him on his own. “We must not linger. Harry, take this. Have everyone ready in the morning. The portkey will activate at 7 a.m. and will bring you directly outside the Manor.”
“Harry’s just so adorable.” George sighed dramatically, easing onto the bench on the other side of Hermione with a little more grace.
“Damaged cores are not my area of expertise. I would have to do research, consult with a specialist. Tell me Harry, have you been using your wand? Where is it?”
“Hullo, Lady Malfoy.” He greeted with chattering teeth. “Thank you, so much, for coming.” He rushed to say. The enthusiasm bright with the glow from the snow.
Draco’s mother was doting on the teenagers. Her face was uncharacteristically open with indulgent smiles and reassurances. She feed them pastries and tea until they were drowsy, patiently fielding questions until the adrenaline wore off and the food filled their anxious bellies. The future was unknown but, for now, they were safe at the Manor. Narcissa Black Malfoy would make it so.
Hermione spent the next hour patiently listening, curled up next to him on the battered sofa. She had one knee up and the other dangling so she could see him better. Hermione was horrified by the fight with Draco, surprised by Lady Malfoy’s kindness, and had no objections to Professor Snape’s assistance. When he told her about the Dursleys, she cried, wetly hiccuping each time she pressed her plump lips firmly together to allow him to keep going. Her tears stopped completely when he spoke of Ron. Her usually warm brown eyes turned hard as stone. Still, she did not say anything, just let him continue. At the end of Harry’s account, he laid his head back, dizzy with the rush of relief from all the things he never thought he would say out loud to his best friend.
Pansy turned her attention back to Malfoy. He was studying Harry like he was one of Professor Snape’s newest untested potions. Apprehension mixed with a heady amount of glee. Pansy groaned internally. Draco was making her question her justifications for leaving the school and subsequently, her inheritance behind. Her best friend had already fucked up. She did not know how or why but to her, it was pretty clear she was going to have to work to keep him on track with his new companion.
“Gryffindor’s don’t get scared.” Pansy scoffed, even though she knew it was not true. Even though she had seen the smaller boy pace the stone floor of the Room of Requirement until dawn, worried about his friend. “What is wrong with him.” Pansy needed to
“Noted.” Draco said cheekily with a jaunty little wave out the door. The corridor portraits were starting to wake up. The castle herself flexing with each slow move of a staircase. The halls were still quiet as the Slytherin navigated his way to Gryffindor Tower. It was not until he arrived, he realized he had no way to get in. Instantly, the anxiety returned.
“Not happening.” Draco was not baring his teeth, but his mandible was working hard, jaw clenching and unclenching as he held Harry tighter.
“I’ll be quick.” Harry promised. He was stubbornly ignoring their protests. “We have less than 8 hours.” He reminded his companions. “I have the most experience with this.”
“There now,” one twin said, swooping the cloak off with a flourish all the while managing to hold her steady. Hermione smiled at him. She pushed her sweaty hair off her head with a shaking hand. Her other hand still head the Blood Quill. Hermione wanted to gag at the sight of it. Instead, she threw it into her bag with a panicky embarrassing cry.
“I’m not going to hurt you.” Draco’s voice was softer than the sheets. “I’m never going to hurt you again, Harry.”
“Draco, I think this important.” Hermione said, leaning forward in her seat. Everyone knew how little she valued Divination. Her interest yielded his reluctance.
The next two chapters are already written just need to type and post. Time may be an illusion but in my case it’s more of a mirage. The new glasses with a real prescription are helping tho, I Can See!
with embarrassment as he remembered the hard slam of arousal from the other night. A feeling he had never felt before. And now he was dealing with this low simmering heat of
“I need to speak with Professor McGonagall.” Harry spoke softly to not disturb the other portraits. “Please.” He hastily added when the cat ignored him to lick her paw. The speckled Animagus purred at him for his manners then disappeared.
“Draco,” his Godfather interrupted his musings. “May we help you?” Which in Snape’s tone roughly translated as ‘why are you interrupting?’ Severus never got an explanation (Luna Lovegood told him to come) because not a moment later, Harry Potter was clinging to Draco’s middle with two thin arms, muttering apologies.
“Godfather, please.” The young Slytherin resorted to his best wide-eyed expression, similar to puppy dog eyes, just, not as pathetic.
“I see.” Professor Umbridge tsked. “Well, that certainly changes things.” Hermione found herself face to face with Dolores Umbridge's short Birchwood wand. “One simple little Forgetfulness charm and no harm done.”
Harry’s head. “I do not like not knowing.” He continued petulantly reminiscent of a younger Draco. Harry looked up at him in the dim light and could barely make out the glint of stormy gray eyes. It was too much, Harry quickly buried his head back down, rubbing his nose on the soft skin near Draco’s pebbled nipple.
“I believe you might want privacy. There are some hard questions that require answers young man.” She warned him just shy of stern.
Soon, the frightening fast acting Unburdening dulled the throb of his midsection. The burning across his fisted lifted as if it had never existed. Dizzy with relief, Draco steadied him again.
“Do you want to talk about this?” Harry’s voice was small and quiet and on the verge of reedy. He held his breath after giving voice to the question.
“It means reading, little one, all of the reading.” Draco was not sure where the endearment came from, but he filed it away to use later since it produced the most magnificently dumbfounded expression on Harry’s cutely pouting face. Plus, it was accurate. Harry was little, practically tiny when compared to Draco’s height and new bulk. Hell, even Hermione was taller than Harry. And she definitely qualified as petite.
“I’d rather you did not.” Draco said quietly and heartfelt. For the first time Harry saw him humbled. It was a powerful thing to witness. Beautiful. The proud ponce Malfoy turned sincere and… kind to him. Harry swayed with the heady feeling.
The frustration bloodied Draco’s high cheekbones, staining them red just as his eyes narrowed. “As I said, Parkinson, I. don’t. Know.”
“With all your… extra-curricular activities.” Snape’s sneer held no malice. “You should welcome the vacation.”
Severus Snape arrived just after sunset on the crisp cold winter day. The Floo Receiving Room of Malfoy Manor was empty and chilled without a fire. A lone light flickered from the sconce on the wall by the door leading into the hallway. Severus wasted no time shivering in the chill. His body barely acknowledged the lack of warm having become accustomed to a lower temperature while brewing. He did, however, shudder with unease leaving the children unguarded and unchaperoned in the halls of Hogwarts. They were perfectly safe for the moment, with Umbridge distracted by her search. Instead of dwelling on the impossible act of being two places at once, Severus went in search of Narcissa. He found her in the first place he looked. Unfortunately, she was not alone.
Harry shook off his morose thoughts, washed his face and consciously avoided the mirror. When he exited the bathroom, Draco was standing, heavily leaning against the wall. The light filtering through the partially open drapes, purple with the dawn was highlighting the Slytherin’s broad bare shoulder and the length of his lightly muscled arm. He was as light as he was dark and beautiful, and Harry could only blink dumbly at the sight.
Severus was not surprised by the misery drenched all over Harry’s pinched face. He was more concerned as to why the boy was not firmly tucked away in bed. He went as far as to ask Narcissa why Harry was up and about.
“Things change?” Harry scoffed. “You beat me up!” He lightly pinched the soft skin on the far side of Draco’s chest. Draco’s hand settled against Harry’s head and the Gryffindor wished he had never opened his damn mouth.
“That’s my line.” Hermione laughed. No one commented on the tears they could hear in her voice. “Please be careful.” She cautioned. “Let Draco help.” She did demand with conviction.
“Some tea to fortify us on this cold night.” Narcissa said to Minsy. “Also, if you could gather the rest of the staff in the West Library.”
Narcissa Black Malfoy watched her husband as he sat behind his aged oak desk. He was buried in parchment up to his strained eyeballs. The ministry with their galleons influence, was overflowing his desk with requests. Propaganda against Harry Potter. Denials of the Dark Lord. Lies and obfuscations with Lucius Malfoy at the center of it.
“The little one.” She interrupted, overly helpful. She continued with some judgment. “How he’s the savior of the wizarding world is beyond me. As tiny as a third year! And at his age!” she was back to speaking in exclamations.
“Fuck.” Harry swore, unconsciously leaning into Draco, eyes never leaving the youngest male Weasley.
Harry snapped his mouth shut tightly. He shook his head ‘no’. She sighed in disappointment. “I see. I am afraid there is nothing I can do to help you. Try to get some sleep if you can.” Harry recognized the look on her face as one he had seen many times in the mirror. Resignation. Her hands were tied.
that was Harry’s life. Hell, Harry’s own family hated him. Ron did not understand him, and Draco’s own godfather barely tolerated Harry’s presence. Not to mention Lucius Malfoy’s attempted
“No trouble… Lady Malfoy.” He assured her. “Umbridge has spent the day frantically searching the forbidden forest for the ‘irredeemable brats’ as she is calling them. Her ‘brute squad’ should be returning to the castle now. I spent the day brewing, restocking the reserves for myself and Pomfrey. The day was blissfully unencumbered by dunderheaded students as all classes were cancelled. The entire castle is under lockdown until the ‘villainous things’ can be found.”
Draco’s mother sighed, plopping back down on the couch and slumping, inelegantly, back into the cushions. “That man wears me out.” She admitted. Out loud. Draco could only gape at her, completely scandalized.
Draco was no help, silently watching the struggle with a quirked brow. He was close enough for Harry to see the clenching of his mandibles, to feel his body heat. Harry was surprised to feel warmth. He had always viewed Draco Malfoy as cold. Like Ice. Maybe it was the hair.
“Hurry.” Hermione was told. This time she was quicker on her feet. She grabbed her bag and the quill before being shrouded by Harry’s fabulously invisible cloak. It was cramped beneath the fabric with two overgrown Weasleys and one Granger but, they made do. Hermione did her best not to panic when one had his hand on her hip and the other’s back was smushing her nose. This was nothing like her previous trips beneath the cloak. Harry was always conscious of personal space and Ron instinctively copied him. The twins had no such manners.
“Draco.” Lady Malfoy said her son’s name in warning. Harry shrank back from them both. Going as far as to put space between himself and Lady Malfoy. He felt cold and uncertain continuing down this path.
,” Draco stressed, turning Harry’s attention. “I will be most displeased if you got caught.” He assured the smaller boy.
“Cissssa.” Lucius, fury all over his face, hissed her name as if saying it calmly or rationally was shameful. His blue eyes were narrowed with burning red rims and his blonde hair, always so perfectly straight was tangled unlike she had ever seen. “What is the meaning of this?”
“It’s clear.” Luna whispered as she shouldered Harry’s weight. He tried to shrug her off, to lead her to the Room of Requirement. Luna would have none of it showing a rare sign of impatience when she firmly draped his arm over her shoulders. “Sometimes, its ok to let someone else carry the burden.” Luna’s voice strong and full of authority. She sounded entirely too much like Hermione. Harry said as much. “She is the
“The light bulb in my cupboard at the Dursley’s went out and they refused to replace it. Some nights it was too… dark to sleep. For a long time, I thought I was imagining it, the way kids do. It made more sense after Hagrid found me.”
“Yes! Let one of the devils go!” Draco exclaimed throwing his arms into the air as if Harry were being
“Ease up, haven’t you ever had a piggyback ride?” Draco asked with some exasperation. The poor boy was holding on for dear life.
“You may use the Dreamless Sleep no more than twice a week. And only half a dose until your weight comes back up to acceptable levels.” Severus eyed Harry critically enough to cause Draco to squeeze him tighter to his chest. Harry had no protests, only nuzzled his nose to the spot right above his nipple.
“Severus Snape.” Lady Malfoy, in all her aristocratic glory, swiftly and effectively interrupted his stare down with Harry by placing her body in front of the boy. She was an avenging dark angel, beautiful and deadly. The room practically crackled with her ire making Severus’s breath quicken with… anticipation. He would love to see her unleash her control. Harry, even with his intelligence in question, exhibited excellent instincts by staying out of the line of fire. It was the first time Severus had ever seen the boy not willingly jump into trouble and the Professor could only smirk at the scrunched up furious little face of the boy-who-lived.
The plan ended up being entirely too simple in Hermione’s opinion. Sneak out of the castle through the only passageway Umbridge had not blocked. The portrait in the Room of Requirement led into Hogs Head. From there Hermione would be apparated to a safer location.
“You care when it is convenient.” Harry said calmly, nodding his head in agreement. “You care when it benefits you. Unless I stray from your predetermined path of what you think a friend should be. Then you abandon me. Accuse me of awful untrue things. Talk about me behind my back like I don’t fucking
“Of course, Severus.” Lady Malfoy replied with only the barest hints of a secret smile. Draco watched with interest when his Godfather’s deathly pale cheeks flared with color.
“I need my sleep too!” Ron was back to yelling. “Every night, Harry! You wake up screaming like you’re being tortured. Honestly, it’s annoying. Dean and Seamus agree.
“I missed you too.” Harry said shyly before he caught Narcissa’s eye. She nodded to him and gestured to the empty seat next to her on the sofa. Harry rushed over after disengaging from his friend.
Three days in bed with weird meals and house elves administering snacks until he was feeling bloated and sleepy but also anxious to get up and out. Three nervous days with no word on what was happening at Hogwarts. Lady Malfoy was tight lipped each morning she came to greet him. Draco was mulish and Hermione was hesitant to deny him. Even Neville guiltily shrugged and said:
“Come on.” She urged him to stand. “We need to get you to Snape.” She whispered, casting a look around the common room. A few students were already up. “Or would you prefer Madam Pomfrey?” she asked with a saccharine falsetto.
. The attention being from Draco even more so. And the complete lack of censorship from his classmates kept the echos of Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon quiet. Because being hand feed from a boy who had been your nemesis for four years was not
“I just… just…” Harry could not find the words. His emotions were caught up, captured in the back of his voice box. Draco putting any amount of distance between them was the
Luna pulled Harry to the floor, rolling them both to the other side of the hallway where they stayed until Umbridge found nothing and lost interest. By the time the woman was gone, Harry’s whole body was on fire from staying so still and his nerves were an absolute wreck. Thankfully, Luna had her wits about her. They travelled onward and when the two reached the R.O.R, Luna had to literally drag Harry inside since he could no longer stand on his own.
“I believe it is.” Professor Snape’s dark voice joined in. Harry let out his pent-up breath. “You two better get started.” He said to the boys. “Perhaps, Mr. Weasley could explain his objections.” Ron visibly swallowed, shaking his head ‘no’. “No objections he mumbled to the stone floor before taking his abandoned seat between Dean and Seamus.
“Indeed.” Narcissa said behind rattled teeth. She raised her brows at his audacity. “breaking them should not be a new experience for you then.”
Harry barely made it through the meal before he started nodding off. Warm. Full. And secluded with Draco at the table, Harry felt his muscles relax, his head nod forward, his eyes sliding shut only to jerk awake, panicked.
“You. Are. Not. A. Freak.” Draco growled out. Feed up with the distance between them, he moved into the smaller boy’s personal bubble.
“It wasn’t safe.” Harry said. And to his relief, no one said anything else about the matter. Except himself. “It hasn’t been safe since Cedric…” Harry explained. “The dreams, you see, and I haven’t perfected the silencing charm. I can’t get it to hold during…” He trailed off too choked up to continue. “Ron kicks me out if I get too loud, so I read in the common room until breakfast.”
“Yes, Lady Malfoy.” The elf appeared in a clean white fitted pillowcase. Ms. Granger frowned at the creature then switched her attention to Narcissa. Back and forth this went on in silence. Minsy took no offense to the scrutiny and Narcissa was well aware of Hermione’s crusade to free the House Elves. This was just another example of the inadequate curriculum provided by the school.
“Do you remember the promise you made when Draco was born?” she spoke softly in her attack, forcing Lucius to listen instead of continuing to yell. The red rim of his eyes gleamed. They looked very painful. Lucius was shaking his head in denial and any thought of pity for his plight fled. “I thought as much. A shallow promise from a shallow man. Bella warned me you would not have the core to be the husband of a Black sister. Too weak.”
The unfamiliar nature of sharing a bed was mildly discombobulating to Luna. Not that she couldn’t share or did not want to, just that she was very aware of how vulnerable her position was. She was struggling to accept this since she had strived so hard to avoid being subject to her Ravenclaw roommates whims. It was easier and safer to stay apart from the rest of her peers. They refused to accept or understand her and she was not going to make them. So avoidance was the key to thwarting the repercussions of her differences.
, which was such an alien feeling he wondered if he was not in a parallel universe. Accepting magic as real was less disconcerting than the change in their relationship. Not that Harry felt the need to fight it. He was full on
“Tis good to see you again so soon, Mr. Potter.” Lady Malfoy greeted with the warmest of smiles. She gently tugged Harry away from Draco to embrace the brunette. Her fur lined cloak engulfed Harry’s small frame and the boy sighed at the warmth.
“Not the first time I’ve heard that.” Harry scoffed mostly to himself running shaking fingers through his short hair. “What does this mean?” he asked her, completely unaware he was squeezing Draco’s hand. Lady Malfoy gave him a look reminiscent of Professor McGonagall. Baffled and amused with a hint of reproach. She ran the spell again, twisting her wrist this way and that. Frowning at what she saw in his aura.
Hermione valiantly swallowed the threatening bile away, impressing Narcissa just that much more. They entered the foyer which held a merrily crackling fire to heat her frozen blood, Narcissa found she had more patience waiting for young Ms. Granger to get her bearings when the flames licked at the chill.
They complained with weary eyes. Luna lifted her silver blonde head off a stoic Neville’s shoulder. The quiet boy smiled at their safe return before resuming a soft hum and an absent sort of vigilance.
“Harry, sweet, won’t you come over here so I can run a diagnostic to check your process?” Narcissa made the decision for him before Draco’s temper could flare. Harry approached her obediently, chin nearly touching his chest. Narcissa was amused by his clear reluctance to be scanned.
Draco’s room was dimly lit with the heavy brocade curtains already drawn closed. The Malfoy Heir shut the heavy oak door with a firm snick and took little time to shuck his clothing, leaving it strewn across the floor in a trail to the bed. Harry watched with wide eyed wonderment until Draco moved to help him out of his own clothing. He protested with yelps and weak pushes at Draco’s hands.
to be acknowledged. Harry’s flush of shame lessened to a mere mild embarrassment and his mouth parted in surprise. “Tomorrow I will have a proper wizarding optometrist here to examine your eyes.”
The three barely dared to breathe during their stealthy walk up to the seventh floor. An eternity passed until finally, they found Barnabus and his dancing trolls. Hermione nearly wept with relief once they were inside the Room of Requirement.
The young girl looked startled, turning frantically to Harry with wide wet beseeching eyes. “I’ll see you tomorrow.” she all but demanded.
. Just over two years ago, when he was still recovering for the second time because the Potter brat had knocked him out of a body, he had felt a similar pain. Poisonous and sharp like teeth rending flesh from bone. The Dark Lord felt a piece of himself die. A horcrux. His first soul piece. The one he had entrusted with his Right Hand, Lucius Malfoy. It was just… gone. Painfully gone. Dead.
more to come!  Sorry for the abrupt stop. it doesn't even qualify as a cliffhanger. smh. Thank you for hanging in there!
“If it weren’t true, I’d demand you take that back.” Harry responded, too sleepy to take real offense. Pansy openly laughed.
“Hey.” Harry automatically said back. Draco smirked and brushed past to the bathroom. The light flickered back on, illuminating Draco’s bare back and the way his black sleep pants hung low on his trim hips. Harry nearly stumbled back with the way his stomach clenched in
“Yes, Harry, come here so I can inspect your hand. It should be healed soon.” Draco’s mother changed from awkward and emotional to calm and professional in the blink of an eye. “How is it feeling.” She had her head tilted, focused on unraveling the bandages. They were a day late from needing changed. Harry watched, tense and curious, his stomach in knots. He could vividly recall the mangled flesh of two nights ago.
“Easy there little one.” Draco warned playfully. “Before you embarrass us both.” But it was too late. Harry could feel the
Draco thought. He felt as if beans spelled to jump were playing with his insides. Anticipation, anxiety, excitement rumbling around creating havoc. Draco could not decide with emotion was more prevalent.
The goblin said nothing, only raising his hairless brows behind outdated spectacles. He steepled his long goblin fingers together as if to indicate he were listening even with less than perfect patience.
To Harry, this was the hardest task he had ever intentionally done. Including escaping a fire breathing nesting mother of the Hungarian Horntail variety. For distraction, Harry concentrated on the phantom pains of his core as they pulsed along his organs. Lady Malfoy had held off on giving him any Pain-Relieving Potions. She wanted Snape to scan him later with no interference. They wanted his system clear in case any of the new potions would be detrimental if mixed. Treating a drained core was more difficult than mere broken bones. Lady Malfoy made it very clear the cure, if rushed, could kill him.
Harry calmed down significantly after hearing it, even allowing Draco to pull him close to join the call. Her son always had been prone to cuddling. Narcissa was glad Lucius’s influence had not drummed the instinct out. Her son deserved whatever happiness he could find in this mad, dark world.
“Mr. Potter,” Severus said the name uncharacteristically soft, “I apologize.” And this time he meant it.
“Does she?” Hermione asked, surprise mingling in with the concern. Harry nodded, his head was too heavy to lift more than three times.
“I regret taking my anger out on you.” Draco admitted with a soft regretful voice. “If you want me to leave you alone, I will.” He offered sounding dull and resigned to the inevitable. Harry furiously shook his head, lifted up to stare up at the taller boy. His skinny arms holding onto Draco with all his strength. Draco chuckled darkly. “No?” He teased, squeezing gently back. “I can work with that.”
“I will always accept you Harry. You’re my friend.” Hermione gently held both of his hands, taking care not to jostle his bandaged one. “You must be smelling my shampoo.” She speculated. “And you’re exhausted. Why are you not in bed? Have you been to the infirmary? This bandaging was done well.” She rambled, inspecting his hand with delicate fingers.
.” Harry stressed the word. He could not even begin to describe the chasm of emotion he refused to acknowledge. “If a resorting is not possible, I will find another way.” He assured her with a mask of confidence built from years of having his life in danger.
“I’m the arsehole? You are the one who ignored me all day and sat with fucking Malfoy! He’s the enemy Harry. Remember!”
Breakfast progressed smoothly after that. Hermione’s cheeks were flush for most of it, being jostled by the twins were wont to do that to a person. Harry knew. They were both hard bodied and handsome. Harry was wondering if this was the first time Hermione had noticed. And she was noticing, if her quiet surprised gasps and furtive glances were anything to go by. Harry felt ultimate sympathy for her. The twins could be… overwhelming.
“Fineeee.” Harry slurred into his pillow as he snuggled back into Draco like a kitten demanding snuggles. Draco stifled his groan when the movement elicited
Harry protested with widened miserable eyes. “We must help them!” he demanded with all the sanctimonious self-righteous and indignant emphasis that grated on Severus’s nerves. Snape’s gaze hardened at the display to pin the boy in place before he could fly off half-cocked to rally the troops.
much less be told. Harry shuddered with acknowledgment of his ignorance, unable to look up at where she sat, poised and pretty at her desk. “You can punish me however you want.” He whispered, unwilling to let the tears welling in his eyes to fall. Harry braced himself, back straight, legs planted and arms hanging loose at his side no matter how much he wanted to protect himself. Uncle Vernon had hated when Harry tried to shield his body.
“I can assure you Mr. Potter, the student body is more than ok with the present situation. Those prone to… frivolous behavior are partaking in merry making and those more dedicated to their studies are taking the time to
Pansy tried to willfully ignore Luna as she shook Granger awake. The bushy haired girl immediately grabbed her wand and Pansy could not help but be impressed by her quickness.
“Hostage.” Draco latched onto her first statement with a foreboding face. Harry shook his head unwilling to explain. The Slytherin respected his silence on the matter. “I don’t know about allies, Granger, too much bad blood between us.” Draco said. This time Harry did jerk away, taking a full step to be out of Draco’s reach.
“You’re vexing me, witch.” He snarled. “what does that have anything to do with what you are about to bring down upon our heads?”
The manor loomed ahead, bold in white marble. Big and imposing. The wards were thick enough to distort the air like a wave of heat in the summer. Change was in the air but the safety and sanctity of the Malfoy Manor was beaconing him home.
“Sorry.” His apology was forced and only referring to the embarrassment on both their faces, not on his instinct to protect. Hermione waved him off, this time hugging Harry with far greater restraint. Harry hugged her back emphatically, his eyes closed tight with relief. Draco knew his little Gryffindor had been profoundly worried about the girl.
“I’ve got you.” Draco squeezed the soft tissue behind Harry’s bony knees. To the Slytherin’s relief, Harry’s grip eased enough for Draco to breathe again.
Sometime during the night one or both of them had yanked that ratty old tee shirt off of Harry in a flurry of strong limbs and grumbling protest. The thing disappeared into the dark cave of the room. And, unbeknownst to the boys, was retrieved by a house elf to be burned with the refuse. It would not be missed.
“I am not weak.” Harry interrupted with a tense, mean little voice. “I’m fine.” He muttered into the carpet.
“Could you…” Draco began, to convince her to wake someone up to get Harry, but the portrait squeaked in surprise and swung open revealing a disheveled Hermione Granger dragging a bleary eyed and grimacing boy-who-lived-to-be-adorable. Harry stumbled right into Draco’s arms immediately soothing the apprehension away. The turbulent noise replaced by a quiet calm. With Harry in reach, Draco acknowledged the weight of his new need to be so near the other boy and waved it away. This was not a burden to Draco. Strange yes, but not a burden.
“Time is wasted arguing.” Harry tried throwing out some logic. “I’ll be right back!” and with that, he disappeared beneath the ever so handy cloak, armed with his father’s map and an unflappable determination to succeed. The same resolve that made him so successful at catching the snitch.
. Here, Harry had no idea of the preferred method of penalty, having never been close enough to Draco to
I also have several other projects I’m working on: catching up/finishing up/palette cleansing/self indulgence but…
“I just wanted to talk!” Ron whined in a wail. Harry almost felt sorry for him. The feeling was short-lived when Ron continued. “Now, I don’t even know why. Malfoy was right about one thing. You are a filthy mudblood with no manners.” He spat; his freckled face was distorted in rage.
“Get into bed Harry.” Draco ordered softly, pushing the thin chest where the sternum protruded. “There is plenty of room.” He encouraged, pull back the dark gray duvet on the massive bed.
“Hermione, can you just stop arguing and let me keep you safe?” Harry blurted out, huffing, and blowing his unruly hair off his face since both of his hands were occupied.
That oily slick skin feeling came back. Harry tried to ignore it. Tried to distract himself with gathering his nightclothes. A pillow. Ron would not let him. He grabbed the fabrics and threw them with vigor across the room. Harry’s things littered their dorm room like a cyclone had hit.
the loneliness and fear in the other girl’s aura so Luna had taken both girls to her room and offered for Pansy and Hermione to stay.
Draco showered and dressed carefully. A casual black sweater, a fresh pair of black trousers, and the charmed bracelet his mother had gifted at the beginning of term. She refused to tell him the specifics of the charm. Draco suspected it was some form of protection spelled into the platinum links. Once dress, he immediately made his way to Professor Snape’s private quarters.
“I believe they are still in the dining hall.” Narcissa said vaguely, cautiously glancing to Harry when he sidled up next to her.
types of looks on the Malfoy faces. The horrified ones. It was best they truly know Harry as the total abomination he was now.
Draco Malfoy spent a very long, very sleepless night pacing back and forth in his empty dorm room. Blaise had left around midnight to meet some new mysterious girl in the Astronomy tower and had no intentions of returning. Blaise was entirely tight lipped about the whole situation. Draco did not mind, he understood the need for privacy and enjoyed reaping the benefits of having the room to himself.
“Harsh.” Harry had pointed out with no heat and slipped the thing over his head before Draco could yank the offending garment out of his hands. An action he was now regretting. He wanted to feel the cool of Draco’s silk sheets on his skin again. They had felt so nice… so decadent. He debated shimmying out of the tee before discarding the idea. Harry did not want to wake Draco. The other boy had knocked out flat on his stomach as soon as Harry settled into bed. Draco had latched onto his wrist like a manacle of flesh. His grip was loose enough for Harry to disengage anytime he wished. He did not wish. The feel of Draco intentional touch was thrilling, sending flickers of
Severus did not regret his insult. A despondent teary-eyed waif was proving to be more than Severus could handle. He’d rather feel the flame of hatred in those verdant eyes than witness the defeated desolation and despair he had walked into. Plus, riling up Narcissa was a perk all by itself. Severus had never appreciated her form more than when she was standing guard with indignation coloring her cheeks and a loose tendril of blonde hair waving in the wind of her barely restrained power.
Once they were settled, Hermione had begged for a play by play of occurrences after she had left. Neither Luna nor Pansy had much information and it wasn’t long before sleep claimed them. Luna was the last awake, experiencing this new kind of tired. The one that did not shut off her brain but caused her body to feel heavy and stiff. She was trying to absorb this overload of information which had never been a problem for her before. She often binged new information in her own placid way. Only tiring when she fully explored each rabbit hole.
“It was my room until I was eleven. Now I’m only put there for punishments. Or if Uncle Vernon is particularly tired of seeing my freak face.” Harry did not recognize his own voice. He had not intended to divulge that particular route of information. Nor had he ever wanted to see
“Ok… I’m up, I’m up.” Harry held out both of his arms for Hermione to help pull him to standing. “This sucks.” he admitted breathlessly, panting into her shoulder as she waited for him to find his feet.
. Narcissa was only slightly put out when her spell did not work. She took a moment to be impressed before impatience won out prompted by a full body shiver after a particularly lusty gust of wind.
“Griphook.” She acknowledged the goblin with a cool stare and a firm nod. “I’ll be needing a private meeting this morning.”
“I had detention.” Harry said defensively. An oily sick feeling crawled over his skin at the line he was toeing with the truth.
When Harry awoke the next morning, it was clear the Unburdoning had worn off. The groan he let out was involuntary and unwelcome.
“You were saying.” Hermione rallied. After all, knowledge was power. For the first time since learning she was a witch, Hermione felt powerless. Even after all the adventures as one third of the Golden Trio. Umbridge’s insidious control over the school terrified Hermione. Her heart was still racing, and her brain felt clogged with residual fear.
“We would.” Harry said before sharply shutting his mouth. He would not look her in the eye. Draco sighed dramatically.
“The chills should pass soon.” Narcissa commented. “Are there…” she paused, unsure exactly how to proceed. The moment passed. Narcissa forged ahead, manners were one thing, her duty as a healer another. “Are you injured in any way?”
“Sure,” Hermione acknowledged. “And you would be right to be concerned if you were alone.” When Harry looked on dubiously, she continued. “But Harry, that’s the thing, you are not alone. I’m here. Go to sleep. I’ll keep watch.” She promised.
. Pansy wanted to wrap him up and squeeze just to hear that surprised little “eep” he gave every time Draco surprised him. Not that she would ever admit any of that out loud. And Draco would probably cut off her hands if she tried. He did not share well even if Pansy only felt platonic cuddling urges. Which she did. It was weird, ok. And confusing. One thing she did know, though, was if she left with them, her father would actual facts kill her. This, she would also not admit to. Instead she said: “You know what my father would do when he finds out.” But they didn’t actually know because she would never tell them.
“What a handsome boy.” The Fat Lady said with interest. She was straining to watch Draco’s lithe figure descend the stairwell.
Harry awoke the next morning feeling refreshed. More so than he had expected, what with the fleeing into the morning light and the sharing of a bed with a boy he had previously only thought of as “prat” and “git” rather than “friend”. Much less the
With the manor looming ahead and a staggering Harry Potter at his side, Draco decided quickly the smaller boy would not make it up the hill to his home. Harry was swaying with fatigue and while they were all tired from the sleepless, tense night, Harry was running on fumes. With the Twin’s help, Draco convince Harry to climb on his back. The Gryffindor clung with uncharacteristic fear to Draco’s neck.
Harry lifted his head slowly. Scared but also hesitant to remove himself from Lady Malfoy’s embrace. She reminded him of Draco. Kind underneath all that Purebred behavior. He smiled at her tremulously. She smiled back at him much the way she looked at Draco. He did not know what to do with that realization, so he pushed it down and sat up a little straighter. Snape was looking at him with a blank parchment face.
“It’s not your fault.” Harry rushed to say, blatantly ignoring the child remark. He had never felt like a child. Harry shifted forward, reluctantly letting go of Draco’s hand to lean against Lady Malfoy’s lap. He hugged her quickly, letting go lest she take offense. She made a soft coo of a sound, not letting him step away from her own embrace.
“Harry.” Luna, fully cloaked and waiting outside of Ravenclaw territory, said with her breathy light voice. “You should rest before we leave. No one will be by here for a few minutes.” Harry understood not to question how she knew or why she was prepared.
The end of the sixth part. The seventh part will take a while to get out but forewarning… there will be smut.
The impromptu cuddling did not last long before a young house elf announced dinner. Draco politely offered to escort her. Narcissa declined, using the excuse of practicing the etiquette lesson she taught the Weasley Twins. “Why don’t you escort your young man?” she suggested with challenging eyebrows. It was to her delight that Draco took up her thrown gauntlet and led a bewildered Harry to dinner. And to her amusement when Draco pulled out a chair like the purebred gentleman he was, then sat down before Harry could, pulling the smaller boy into his lap. Harry squirmed and struggle against Draco all the while shooting her increasingly desperate and highly embarrassed looks. Not a one of the other teenagers said anything. They were all acting as if this was a usual occurrence. Narcissa took that as her cue to play along. She enjoyed the highly inappropriate spectacle. Warmth flooded her when she caught sight of Draco’s delighted smirk at the boy in his lap. She had never seen her son so happy and content.
Pain was nothing new to Voldemort. He had grown up with it as Tom Riddle in the orphanage before he had learned to control his magic. And after his first third Horcrux, had employed it as his own favorite weapon as the Dark Lord. Then, ultimately, pain had been his constant companion once he was obliterated into a wraith of a being.
“Harry! What are you doing down here by yourself?” His friend was crouched in front of him in a half abortive hug. She had relit the fire and was looking concerned, reaching up to feel Harry’s forehead with her cool delicate hand. Usually, she hugged him full force. Harry was grateful she was showing restraint just as much as he was sad to not feel her slim compact body slam into him. To feel her surprisingly strong arms around his torso. The softest of vise. Harry loved Hermione’s hugs. Loved the surprise each time and her general accepted of his
“Harry,” Severus used that tone. The one that never failed to get the attention of the most negligent student. He waited until the panicked eyes latched onto his face. “You are safe here.”
“Very well.” Severus intoned, unamused and droll. Draco’s mother rolled her eyes at the long-time family friend and his deplorable manners.
“Draco, dear, you’re seething.” She observed to lighten her own dark thoughts. Not that it worked on either of their ends. Still, Draco straightened out his façade, unclenched his fist, leaned into the cool marbled walls. “This does not explain why he wont let you touch him.” She pounced once her friend relaxed.
at the end of Second Year. Before Dobby had intervened, Lucius had had every intention on finishing what the Dark Lord started.
“Please, Severus, call me Narcissa.” Lady Malfoy sat on the sofa next to Harry, her skirt touching his skinny thigh even though there was enough room for three people on the furniture. She gestured for Snape to take her matching desk chair, her smile was secret and small before her visage turned grave. “The blood quill did more damage than we thought.”
“Weasel… er… Weasley…” Draco hastily corrected with an apologetic look when Fred threw a scone at his head. “… is an idiot.”
“You are taking too many chances!” Draco Malfoy, disheveled, red-faced, and slightly sweaty, was standing at his fullest height in front of the fireplace. The Room of Requirement had given them little. The blazing fire to protect against the winter chill emanating from the grey castle stone. The portrait of the ethereal girl, whom, stood guard to the tunnel to Hogsmead. A threadbare rug centered invitingly before the fire. There was no furniture. No training equipment. No mirror or pictures of the original Order of the Phoenix. The Room was empty, a place to wait. A safe place to hide. Exactly what they needed. And nothing more.
“Yeah.” Harry said, small and quiet, remembering the powerless rage he had endured during Marge’s tirade before magic exploded out of him.
“Where have you been?” Ron was on Harry as soon as they entered the massive dining hall. Ron’s whining voice echoed throughout, turning each head of the student body.
“Will dissolve.” Draco said firmly. “You will no longer be a Parkinson.” He half whispered her greatest desire. “Please, Pansy, I need you.”
“What the hell, Malfoy?” Ron yelled again, ignoring the hastily approaching Professor McGonagall in favor of causing an even bigger scene, complete with Professor Umbridge squawking from her perch at the Head Table.
It was not long before Narcissa handed a warm shawl to her companion. “Please, drink.” She told the girl with the authority of a parent. Miss Granger nodded gratefully, sighing over the first sip. Narcissa was once again surprised when she realized the young witch was exhibiting nerves of steel.
“Severus.” Narcissa spoke first, her voice hoarse as she acknowledged her guest with a strained smile. She was barely holding herself in check. He could literally see the struggle across her fine features.
It is what it is. And also it turned into a beast and since i promised myself i would post today (which is actually tomorrow but still the middle of the night so it totally counts) the second half will have to wait until i have time to refine. honestly writing twin speak is exciting.
Draco scowled briefly before turning the full force of his attention on Hermione. “My mother will be meeting you on the far side of Hogsmeade. There is a small cottage with blue shutters. You must stay hidden the whole way. Harry will go with you.” Draco spit out. “against my better judgement.”
Voldemort had spent over a decade trying to find someone to anchor him. To use as his own body. Sharing control had felt slimy and weird and gross. Quirrell had been so disgustingly easy to overtake but so tarnished by his fear it had required every ounce of strength for Voldemort to get him to do the simplest of things. Then to be burned so by a child. The same child who was no longer a baby but a stubborn steadfast little boy. Harry Potter of all people, who was too small and too uneducated to compare to Lord Voldemort but shockingly similar to Tom Riddle at that age.
“Bossy pants.” Harry accused playfully right before he grabbed Hermione by the hand and dashed over to the portrait. It swung open silently, the painted girl having an absent little smile. Hermione let Harry tug her through with one last look behind. Draco had a hard resolute narrowed-eyed stare, his attention fully on the retreating Harry. The farther they went, the harder the stare. All the while the twins shared meaningfully looks with each other. They waved enthusiastically to Hermione as the portrait swung closed and she heard them promise to see her soon. Relief eased the tight coil in her abdomen.
Previously: “The blood quill has severely depleted your magical core.” She told him somberly. “You shouldn’t even be alive.”
“I’m not lying.” Harry shrank back away from the other Slytherin. Away from Draco. He rubbed absently at his bandaged hand.
“But…” He tried to come up with a reason, any reason, digging in his heel in true Gryffindor fashion.
“No Mother, I am not.” Draco addressed her while staring at Harry with soft stormy eyes. “I am upset by the Gryffindor Martyr Mentality.” He clipped in explanation as Harry dropped his eyes back down to the floor. Narcissa could hardly believe how the teenager tried to make himself smaller as Draco continued. “Harry seems to think your efforts will be wasteful and unnecessary.” He spat.
Snape had, in fact, saved Harry’s life multiple times. First with Quirrel and the bewitched broom. Then again with Lupin. Snape had stood between three Gryffindors and a werewolf even when Harry had done what he had done to get to the truth, leaving Snape injured and more than angry. Not to mention the numerous occasions when Snape caught Harry out after curfew and not once had the man laid a violent hand on him. Still, it was hard to think past the pain and the loud angry voice. Flashes of Vernon’s purple rage bombarded Harry’s prevalent thought like bombs making Harry revert to a time when he was helpless and
“Professor Umbridge!” Hermione was startled when the door to Professor Snape’s classroom opened. The Potions Professor had not arrived. Hermione was early. She was often early, this time due to nerves than punctuality.
The Dark Lord’s original intentions had been to guide the wizarding world with a firm hand, teaching the influx of muggleborns how to survive and save them from the influence of hateful muggles. To keep them safe and away from the fear and pain and derision of the outside world. Away from wars and weapons and death. Instead, he had created an intolerable existence, he became the very thing he abhorred most. A tyrant. A violent murderer. A soulless beast of a madman who preyed upon children.
Soon, Harry found himself seated at the farthest table amid a sea of green insignia and suspicious yet blank faces. He could also feel the heavy stares from the Gryfindor table and the ever-watchful eyes of Head Table.
“You will see.” Luna said mysteriously rising to a sitting position, completely unoffended by Pansy’s skepticism and Pansy refrained from scoffing, as was her habit, to be polite. Instead, she asked about Granger.
“Good Boy.” Draco said quietly, enjoying the shudder that ran through Harry. He was positive the involuntary movement had nothing to do with the cold.
Snape was probably right, Harry mused tapping his fingers on the muscle of Draco’s pec, she was too busy with her children. Plus, no one else had seen, how could he possibly expect Mrs. Weasley to do so. It wasn’t very fair of him to hold her to a higher standard. He felt lucky she had been as kind to him as she had.
“Why do you call me that? Little One?” Harry asked too tired to be embarrassed and too awake to not be curious.
“Mother, how do they monitor accidental magic?” Draco turned to her, distracting the room from how he shifted closer to Harry. His new friend had crossed both arms over his skinny chest, as if he were cold and Draco was beginning to worry.
“Is this true, Harry?” Professor McGonagall’s voice quavered in a strange, strangled way. Harry focused on his perspective, trying to outwit the Unburdening. The goal was to get his weight up. The instructions had come from Lady Malfoy. But… Snape was there. And… Draco was aware. His former nemesis was already invoking a truce by helping him dress and not taking advantage of Harry’s weakened state. Sure, there was no grade involved. Harry would end up with better health. Which could theoretically help him concentrate on his classes thus raising his grades. The conundrum, Draco had nothing to gain.
“Well yes, he would have.” Hermione acknowledge trying not to make eye contact and lose her train of thought.
. Harry scoffed. Umbridge had succeeded in making his life miserable. The fear of losing his magic was greater than any instance where Uncle Vernon had come at him screaming obscenities and waving a leather belt. At least with his uncle, Harry knew what the punishment entailed. Umbridge could give
always having to be so proper all the bloody time. “Are you alright?” Granger plowed on in true Gryffindor style, blundering and worried. Any sleepiness the other girl might’ve felt was absent beneath her laser focus on the boy-who-live. Harry, the liar, nodded he was fine but went into a hug with clear and blissful relief. The boy was starved for affection. Pansy did not blame him as she could relate.
“If you have them.” Harry sassed back before turning shy again. “I don’t mind if he hears.” He admitted.
. Draco realized. He quickly pushed the thought away. He was too tired and too keyed up to make time for that now. Harry was stumbling against Draco very nearly asleep on his feet. The Malfoy Heir would rather concentrate on making sure his former nemesis arrived safely to bed.
“Draco I cannot eat like this.” Harry tried using logic. The Malfoys were fans of logic. To which Draco countered by popping a square of cheese in his protesting mouth. Which defied all logic. It seemed Harry could eat like that.
Thank you to everyone who has kudoed or commented. As I live and breathe, they sustain me in this mad world.
“I see.” Snape arched his brows when Narcissa shot Harry a particular look. That furious face morphed, the mouth opening and closing without any intelligence spilling out. Then snapped shut with resolution. Harry shook his head decidedly not expanding on his answer.
“Only you.” He teased back finally showing some life. He could not help but smile when she preened at him. “You’re so smart. Why were you not sorted into Ravenclaw?” He asked out of the blue. He also reached out to slide her loose bang behind her ear. “Pretty.”
“Merlin forbid.” Draco spat. Blaise laughed his deep dark laugh. It was rare but it was rich, and Draco felt more than a little bit of pride to hear it. “Alright. Time to get Pansy.” To which, Blaise groaned. Their next task would not be easy.
“I believe my Mother has a solution to that as well.” Draco mused with pursed lips. “Alright, enough chit chat.” Draco’s demeanor changed abruptly. “If you insist on this foolhardy plan then you must go now before I change my mind.” He said to Harry. The eye contact was a palatable thing to behold.
A huge thank you to all of my readers for all the kudos and comments. I value all of your feedback!  Thank you so much for sticking with this!!!
“Harry!” Draco’s mother yelped in the most dignified of ways. “You are a wonderful, strong wizard. You have no idea the power it takes to cast without a wand to direct or a word to control. Even the Dark Lord could not cast wandless.” Lady Malfoy said fervently.
“Unless you want detention for the entirety of your Hogwarts career, I suggest you take you punishment without further argument.” Snape warned.
“I should have realized.” Narcissa Malfoy said, baffled and besieged with guilt. “I only checked for physical damage. Honestly, I have no idea who you are even standing up.”
Harry returned her smile shyly, adorably. Draco’s mother took Harry by the hand and led the horde of displaced teenagers inside. Their cloaks were taken by the waiting house elves. In exchange, they were given a fortifying cup of steaming tea.
“Harry.” Lady Malfoy said his name softly on a sob, which in his opinion, was worse than Uncle Vernon’s fist. “Harry Potter look at me.” She demanded in a tone that broke no argument. Again, Harry could only obey. Not because of any compulsions or spells, but because he naturally wanted to
“Draco, dear, come sit. I will call for some tea. I’m afraid no one else is awake yet.” Narcissa waved to the loveseat near her desk. It was gray velour with an unusual sheen gleaming in the evening light. Draco sat first while Harry, still stone faced, fidgeted nearby. Draco huffed at the smaller boy, exasperated, and rolling his eyes.
A dark and primal part of Draco was closer to the surface than he had ever allowed before. He was experiencing trouble hiding behind his pedigree and breeding. He had been taught to carefully construct his persona of cool manners and proper behavior. Draco no longer wanted to emulate his father or his teachings. The Slytherin spent a long time concentrating on matching his breath to the rhythm of his bedmate. The intimacy of the soft snores and the warmth glowing off the thin body was precious and new. He did not want to miss any more of these quiet moments by keeping Harry Potter at a distance. The boy was going to be
“You can cast a corporeal Patronus wandless and wordlessly.” Lady Malfoy did not hide her surprise or her delight.
Harry straightened away from Draco’s warmth, reluctantly. “I can stand on my own.” He assured the other boy. Draco sneered at Hermione, all the while gently easing Harry back under his arm. Harry did not resist, too comforted by Draco’s presence.
Draco came back to bed and stood looking down at Harry with a sleepy smile. Harry watched him with tension. He kept his mouth shut afraid he might betray his thoughts if he said anything. Draco cocked his head to one side, a question on his handsome face. Harry had no answers. He waited, holding his breath, and desperately thinking about other things instead of Draco’s slightly parted lips and glass cutting cheekbones and the way his Adam’s apple bobbed when he swallowed. And he absolutely did not look below his clavicle.
The twins stood as one, towering over their little brother. Harry was not entirely sure they were not going to murder his former best friend. Ron swallowed audibly but did not back down.
“You need your sleep too!” Harry protested using her favorite tool, logic. No way would he ever want Hermione to resent him the way Ron did.
“I’ll be right back.” Harry promised and rushed to do his business. Draco may have the bladder of an elephant, but Harry had woken up for a reason. He fumbled around for his glasses then shot off before Draco could drag him back for cuddles, as he threatened. Harry was not sure if he was dizzy from thirst or Draco’s words or because of his… lingering affliction.
No. Harry could not trust Ron. Not at this point anyway. And Harry could not be sure Ron would not rat them out to Umbridge’s minions for the notoriety and house points. Decision made; Harry climbed the steps to the Fifth-year dorm. Maybe it was sheer dumb luck or maybe it was Mother Magic looking down on him favorably for the first time ever that found Neville Longbottom alone in the dorm studying on his bed.
“I’m not going to lie to you, Little One. I am not the most patient of people. But if the past five years of animosity has not pushed me away then I doubt much else will.” Draco shifted his bulk, once again leaning over Harry’s chest, peering down at him.
“To be fair,” Said Hermione, a little dizzy from the twin speak. “I wasn’t sure how I was going to get out of that.”
Only Snape showed any disapproval of the cuddling while his mother observed indulgently. Draco suspected she was catering more to Harry’s desire for close contact than Draco’s greedy, possessive grasp on the Gryffindor.
“Of course, Mother.” Draco spoke up as he was eyeing Harry like it was the first time he had ever seen the other boy. Something in Harry recoiled from the look, it being too similar to the way Ginny and sometimes Ron would stare at him.
The Dark Lord, formally known as Voldemort, was going to make a comeback as Tom Riddle. No matter how much he hated carrying his father’s name, it would serve him now and that was all that matter if he was going to thrive. That is to say: after he acquired his missing pieces. The loss of the one was manageable. Potter’s blood had healed most of the damage. The return of his remaining soul pieces would make him better, stronger, less vulnerable. He would find another way to defeat death.
“Harry, darling, there is no way to pinpoint an exact length of time.” Draco’s mother said. “Magic regenerates differently from wizard to wizard. And there is no telling how fast you will recover or how much damage there actually is. It might be a few days. Or…” she paused looking distressed. “… a few months. That woman… stole… what is essentially your life force.”
“I can’t believe your mother is letting you get away with this.” Harry hissed from his perch on Draco’s hard lap. The taller boy shrugged nearly dislodging his captive. Harry yelped and wrapped his arms tighter around Draco’s neck.
“Jealous Ron?” Harry accused. “Yes. I sat with Draco Malfoy. Who was actually Nice to me. And non-judgmental. And Caring.” Harry yelled back at Ron. The irony was not lost on him either. Defending the boy who was responsible for part of his injuries.
“Leaving would be suicide.” Pansy muttered darkly when she opened her dorm room door to see an empty hall. Draco snorted beneath the invisibility cloak and gently pushed their way inside. Like Blaise, Pansy had been told what was going on during the desperate race to fire call Draco’s mother. Pansy had been the one to console Harry before the Gryffindor finally lost control of the Unburdening. She had a soft spot for the boy-who-captured-all-their-hearts. He was adorable and sweet and so very
“Thank you, Mr. Potter.” She responded looking positively shocked by the compliment, though she quickly rallied. “What may I help you with?”
No one knew that Voldemort had once been a handsome half blood orphan. And the ones that did were dead. Except for Dumbledore. No one would recognize him. Especially since his face was once again his own, if somewhat aged. It was the nose that would make them doubt he had anything to do with Voldemort. The nose and the hair. People were so blind when it came to seeing what they wanted to see. Not that anyone believed he was back, Dark Lord or Voldemort or no. The ministry was throwing heavy denials to Potter’s proclamations of his return.
“Harry’s clothing is… hostage.” She said hesitantly. Her pretty brown eyes were darting around the corridor before landing on Draco. Harry could practically see her apply steel to spine. His poor friend had no idea how to deal with an enemy turned ally. “No. I don’t.” Hermione admitted to Harry. “I’ll have to follow your lead in this Harry.” She smirked, waving a hand to where he was still
“Why is it so bloody dark in here?” Pansy said as soon as she opened her eyes. The Slytherin’s heart was pounding waking up in an unfamiliar bed. She hoped no one noticed how she startled, jerking from dead asleep to completely alert with wand in hand. Her muscles tense and readied to leap into action.
The first two days, Harry had done as Snape had suggested and slept. For the most part. His body was unaccustomed to such rest and he had to fight the impulse to jump up and just… do something. Anything. Lady Malfoy suggested, when the impulse was too strong, he should concentrate on his breathing. And doing so was dull enough for the exhaustion to catch up to him, sending Harry into a deep slumber for several hours until he woke up and started all over again. He was enjoying the sleep especially when night came, with Draco’s warm body and light snoring, Harry found his nightmares suspiciously absent.
Inside the tower, Harry broke out into a sweat. This was absolutely the last place he wanted to be. As he climbed the stairs to his dorm, Harry dreaded every step knowing once he was in the room, there was little he could do to escape Ron. If Ron had not decided to ignore him again. Sure enough, Ron was already there, waiting on Harry’s bed, jaw set with determination. Harry did his best to avoid him. Ron was not playing along.
“I’d rather not.” Harry volleyed. Surprisingly, the Unburdening did not make him spill his guts all over the red head. Weird. Again, Harry thought of perspective, transferring the theory onto intent. Harry did not feel the need to tell Ron anything.
“You cannot do this!” Lucius cried out grasping his wife’s arms and shaking her like she was some kind of frail thing to behold. “I have made promises!”
“I d…” Hermione started to say only to pause and rethink, “thank…” she trailed off again. That was not right either. “Um…” again, the words failed her. She shrugged helplessly before sitting on the ground. The room was empty, only stone and mortar and one lone portrait of a young girl in a maze of gothic hallways not unlike the older parts of the castle.
“I love you too, Harry.” Hermione was not going to cry. She was a strong independent female and yes, she had just suffered a scare but no lasting damage and so what if her friend just casually threw out the “L” word. And
“Please hurry,” she implored. “Before we all freeze to death.”  Which was a possibility in this weather.
merely by spending time with the eccentric witch. Just… he did not know why he was acting so… childish. Snape was not wrong when he accused Harry of not thinking before acting. Still, he was not able to
Professor McGonagall thinned her lips, the skin above them turning white with the effort. “A resorting requires the Headmaster’s authority. You well know he is indisposed at this time. Do you think the current atmosphere is the right time to be… jumping ship?” she clipped the words in a way he had only ever heard toward the most delinquent.
They skipped going to the kitchens. Harry’s stomach felt bloated from the Nutrition Potion and Draco was still upset by Harry’s confusion regarding his health. Instead, they went to Lady Malfoy’s study, holding hands the whole way.
“You are wrong, Ron.” Harry told him without looking back. “I’m going to give you what you want. To be free from my shadow.”
“I see.” Harry said slowly, trying not to let out his latent temper. A million thoughts flooded his brain overwhelming the need to say anything at all.
“After Dobby tried to get me expelled second year, I didn’t want to use magic this way. I was terrified they would expel me. Then, after that time I blew up my aunt, I realized I had to use it to keep from doing accidental magic.”
“With such a severely deplete magical core, you would be causing more damage.” She instructed firmly. Her dark berry lips thinned at the thought.
“They cannot, my Dragon.” She smiled at Draco with all teeth, more as a response to the ineptitude of the Ministry of Magic than her son’s question. “Accidental magic tends to leave witnesses. I do remember hearing about a ballooned muggle over South London. I take it, that was you?” She turned back to Harry with a much sweeter smile.
“Oh.” Lady Malfoy said with genteel surprise. “I’m sorry, Harry.” She apologized with a worried frown and no other explanations.
“You will have the Malfoy name behind you.” Draco promised so sincerely. Pansy flipped her hair and lifted her unconventionally cute nose in the air to hide her watering eyes and skepticism. Draco forged on, “Think of it this way… if you are disinherited, you won’t have to marry Goyle.”
“You act like those don’t even matter.” Ron raved. The calmer Harry acted the more infuriated Ron became.
It was Hermione who approached Draco to take the potion. Her fingers were steady if reluctant. Draco’s smirk held no menace as he held them out to let her delicately pluck the vials from his hand. “I don’t bite, Granger.”
“To rescue fair damsel.” Possibly George took Hermione’s still trembling hand to land a gentle, sweet kiss on her knuckles.
“They are necessary, Narcissa. He must know how to protect his mind if he is going to flourish in the future.”
“Yeah.” Harry answered honestly. He could always be honest with Neville even without the Unburdening. “Doesn’t matter,” he added quickly when Neville frowned fiercely. And it did not matter. Not when time was a factor. “Grab what you need. We’re getting out of here.” Harry instructed brusquely. Neville stared him down, disbelief and something that looked like anger crossing his uncommonly handsome face. The silence lasted a moment. Long enough for Harry to remember First year and cringe because the Trio had had to stupefy the young Gryffindor.
“What does that mean? Theory?” Harry asked looking up at Draco with wide confused eyes. Again, giving into instincts, Draco leaned down to kiss Harry’s furrowed brow.
During her confinement, heavily pregnant with many difficulties, Narcissa had know very little of Lucius’s proclivities and inclinations. Her midwife had kept a tight lid on anything outside of the nursery during the difficult pregnancy. It was after, with Draco only weeks old, Narcissa had learned of the terrible plans set into place regarding Harry Potter and his parents. Distraught, Narcissa began planning to leave. Then, on a rain fill colicky night, Lucius had made his promise to protect their son. To keep him safe, to keep him alive. Narcissa made the promise binding, and they held hands as the sun rose on the peaceful chest of young Draco.
“You may return when you have proven yourself worthy of the property.” Narcissa paused. “Or reached enlightenment. Honestly, the goblinspeak gets a little wordy.”
while I’m gone.” Draco ordered with his long-fingered hand cradling Harry’s pale dumbfounded face. Once more he kissed Harry, this time on his damp forehead and with that Draco was gone.
Narcissa’s mouth pursed as she watched the poorly hidden animosity play out. “Thank you for coming Severus. Did you have any trouble?” She latched her gaze onto his profile like a lifeline, watching for a lead into how to proceed. Severus basked under her undivided attention even as he strained to keep Pott… Harry’s pale little face trained on him.
his new body and mind of the self-inflicted insanity causing Voldemort to remember what it meant to be the Dark Lord full of purpose instead of madness. To be Tom Riddle when he was bursting with ideals for a better and safer future. Of implementation which he failed. Spectacularly.
I’m taking requests… you know, if there is something out there in the realm of possibilities that you, dear readers, would like to see. Soft ball it my way and I will do my best.
“Oh! Harry!” Hermione turned to the newcomer ignoring the rest of the boys and forgetting for a moment that her very dear friend was injured. She sprinted to him for a hug only to come up short by the broad (when had that happened? Draco was skinny, right?) chest of Harry’s new self-appointed bodyguard. “Ooomph.” Hermione bounced off Draco and would have fallen on her bum if one of the twins had not caught her.
“Harry. Harry, stop. Stop please.” Draco said softly. “Its’ not like that anymore.” Draco visibly geared himself up. Harry held himself perfectly still, willing to listen. “All that pureblood bullshit doesn’t mean anything to me.” Draco announced, face like stone. “It’s arbitrary to measure power by bloodlines. The Dark Lord was a mudblood and raised by muggles. He is one of the most powerful wizards in the world. And Granger,” Draco looked her right in the eye, “is definitely smarter than any pureblood I’ve ever met. Except my mother, of course.” He said with loyalty. “I meant,” Draco turned his gaze back to a contemplative Harry. “she literally drew my blood.” He touched a pale hand to his still crooked nose sheepishly.
“You need actual rest.” Snape explained more fully with a kindness that was rare to see. Draco idly wondered what had transpired before he arrived to illicit such a behavior from the usually snappish wizard. Hopefully, Harry would tell him later. “The more sleep, the better.” Snape said.
“I do.” She snapped her teeth at him. Both boys laughed nervously. “Look, Malfoy, I’ll play nice if you do. My main concern is Harry right now. I am ashamed I had no idea what was happening right under my own nose.” She cast her eyes down to stone. Harry rushed to her side ignoring the twinge of his ribs.
“I’m afraid there are no rooms available Mr. Potter.” She said with some kindness. “Already we are having to combine years to accommodate. You are lucky there are not more boys in your dorm.” She reproached.
“You’re awfully quiet. Knut for your thoughts.” Draco murmured in Harry’s ear. Harry barely suppressed a shiver. Never mind Hermione’s predicament. Harry was in one of his own. “You really are.” Draco teased. Harry groaned as quietly as he could manage. Luckily, no one heard him. They could not hear anything over the loud shouts of Ronald Weasley.
“Yeah.” Harry agreed. He gave her the password to enter. She harrumped, clearly annoyed but swung open to let him through.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Ron yelled, heading straight into attack. “Has Voldemort finally taken possession of you? I know you have a connection to him. Have you finally turned traitor?” With that, Ron thumped him right on the scar.
Draco hummed noncommittal and moved up, adjusting his pillows to lay back down on his side. He curled into Harry making him feel
A house elf was assigned to take each student to their assigned rooms. The twins, by request, doubled up. They went deeper into the house first with ironic in sync “goodnights” just as the early morning sun warmed the windows. One by one, the teenagers were escorted to their beds until finally it was just Draco, his mother and his… Harry. Harry, who was drowsily blinking in front of the fire, staring into the flames like they held all the answers. Draco quickly gave him the Unburdening.
Harry followed her through the empty quiet halls to her study. Mere hours had passed since she had told him about his depleted core, still, the room looked so much different now without Draco by his side.
With that in mind, Harry tried to calm his frantic thoughts. He concentrated on Lady Malfoy. The way she smelled, soft and light. The way her arms were like bands around his shoulders, keeping him in place but also, not letting him fall to pieces. He subconsciously matched his intake and outtake of breath to hers. Harry shuddered when a hot tear rolled down his cheeks and dropped onto the skirt of her pretty dress. Soon he realized she was crooning a wizards lullaby and petting his hair with one hand. Slowly and calmly like one would an animal. It brought flags of color to his cheeks and under his embarrassment he reveled in the contact.
