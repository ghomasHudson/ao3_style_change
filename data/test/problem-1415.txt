“What are you doing?” he asked pointedly, pushing the wand aside so it wasn’t directed at his chest anymore.
“So pretty,” she said slowly. “Where’d you get that?”
“Callum’s back,” Harry said suddenly, a second before they heard the keys in the lock and Callum came in.
His heart was still hammering from the sudden shock of falling when he realised that he was lying on a bed, and then someone called, “Harry?” and Potter flinched and put a finger to his lips.
Both Lauren and Harry groaned. Harry sat down on one of the chairs. Lauren said, “Well, that fucking explains it.”
Harry was silent for longer than Draco liked, like he was seriously considering it.
“I know
“Ready to smash the Wasps?”
second?”
“Reasonable,” Potter agreed. “The food there is disgusting.”
He was acutely aware of every single aspect of his being – the blood rushing through his veins, the hasty encounter of their lips, Harry’s body weighing him down just so. Blindly he grabbed Harry's collar and just pulled it aside so he could get at his neck. One of the buttons hit Draco’s throat as it was ripped off, but he could fix that later. Harry took a shuddering breath as Draco’s teeth scraped along his neck and he finally licked the skin just behind his ear.
Draco slapped his wand to his own book a little harder than necessary before turning the page with some rustling, just to emphasize that he was
He was sitting on the floor because Ella and Callum’s apartment was chock-full of people and he had run late at the hospital. Harry had already been there – sandwiched between Ella and Olivia on The Best Couch – and just thrown a cushion at him when he came in. Draco had taken the last free spot, the one at Olivia’s feet and next to Hermione, who was sitting in front of Harry. Still better than enduring The Couch.

Marc breathed in heavily and then nodded slowly. “I guess …”
they try to murder you because they don’t want you close to him. Nothing good will come from this.”
“Good for you,” Draco said, glancing at him sideways. “Still a no.”
“What’s Potter doing out there? He doesn’t have clearance!”
Harry shook his head, if only just barely. “I can do this. Just distract me.”
It really did, which was why Draco couldn’t understand why Harry sounded so excited. Whenever Draco had sneaked through the castle, he’d been terrified, afraid that somebody would catch him and he’d have to explain what he was up to.
“Listen, Mrs. Capitelli. I’ve got to go to work now.”
still managed to be the strangest situation he had ever found himself in.
“Not yet,” Draco said, following.
Well, it was only three pm, which was when his shift would normally end, so Harry wouldn’t start worrying for maybe another hour. It wasn’t unusual for Draco to run late at work.
Too much caffeine really wasn’t good for him. Draco had Apparated with way too much force and was still spinning as he materialised inside his hallway. He would have spun straight into a wall if Harry hadn’t intercepted him.
. You’re just exaggerating. As usual. Now come in before your birthday present expires.”
“Oh, don’t you even start!” Harry hissed, shouldering his bag and crossing the room.

“Precisely,” said Narcissa, voice dripping ice water. “People try to end your life because they want to get to Potter
“I’ll just buy another twenty pairs.” Harry stretched his legs and placed his feet on Draco’s coffee table. Raised in a barn, that man. “God, that’s amazing. Where did you get these?”
“Huh,” said Draco.
“Hey, I already agreed!”
“Well, be that as it may,” Lauren said with a wave of her hand. “Fact is, we’ve been sticking to this pub ever since then.”
“Come back when your wife has bashed your head in with a cauldron because you forgot to give her chocolates. Maybe then I’ll have time for you.”
“It doesn’t matter. We are not good for each other.”
Incapacitate the doctors so they couldn’t cause irreparable damage?
“I’m sorry to hear that.”
“Oh no.” Brankovitch laughed. “Quidditch isn’t that big over there. Doesn’t even matter to them that their dad spent years playing it. But they
A nine-year-old Muggle-born had lost control of his magic and blown up his flat instead. The whole family – father, step-mother and two half-sisters – had been blasted with magic, which was why they’d been sent to spell-damages. But the boy had been buried beneath the rubble when the ceiling had caved in, so they’d given him to Draco. He guessed they’d been lucky the flat was on the top floor. Draco doubted any of them would still be alive if the building’s ground floor had collapsed.
“Oh? Is that why you fucking

Draco shrugged and kept his voice neutral. “Not my business, is it? Although, speaking as a Healer, I would advise against it. Just imagine the hassle of being involved with an idiot who constantly gets himself beat up at his job.”
,” Draco whispered.
He certainly wasn’t in the mood for cooking, so he sat down in front of his fireplace and asked to be connected to Linh’s. The line was busy and it took five full minutes until he finally got through.
“Didn’t use to be. Then I got slapped pretty hard for assuming – totally justified by the way – and that tends to change your perspective rather effectively.”
“Yeah, well, it didn’t say
She continued to stare at him for a few seconds without showing any signs of having heard him. She stretched out her arm again, but instead of Harry she grabbed onto Draco’s scarf.
“Is it working?” Harry asked, pulling him closer again, kissing his neck.
It was barely a whisper.
“Only Draco,” Harry said honestly, and Draco suddenly knew what had been in the vial the impostor had given him. Once Harry had answered the question, his face set in anger again, and his voice became a hiss. “You’d better not touch him, or I’ll break every bone in your body!”
Draco nibbled on his toast and watched Harry. He couldn’t hear who he was talking to or what was being said, but Harry’s hands were balled into fists and he looked tense. Then he wrenched his head out of the fireplace – like one would slam a door in somebody’s face – and got up, all the while swearing under his breath.
Potter frowned, and Draco could see the

“I’m not doing anything,” said Draco, emptying his cup (the re-filling kind, again – when would these people learn?) for the umpteenth time.
Potter looked down at it and then up at Draco. “You didn’t eat it,” he said stiffly, like Draco had insulted him.
Draco didn’t know if he should be disappointed or relieved. He wasn’t sure if he could look into Potter’s eyes ever again, but at the same time, he longed to see him, maybe exchange some insults and be glared at. That always made him feel better.
Draco got the feeling that Greyson wasn’t willing or able to call him Harry’s boyfriend. Draco certainly wouldn’t be surprised to hear that he was a homophobe. Or maybe it was bad for their image if the Falcons’ Golden Boy wasn’t available. Or with a former Death Eater.
“Vividly,” Draco replied. He’d been able to hear the commentary up in the Room of Requirement and enjoyed it immensely back then. But he’d never admit to it now, surrounded by Gryffindors and their unknowing supporters.
“Do you want to …” Draco started, but he trailed off when Harry smiled softly and took another step back.
“Where do you put it all?”
If Pansy was to be believed, Potter had gone to the library after Draco’s
As if Draco had the mental strength to resist him.
“I was going to interview some suspects later,” he said in passing as he flicked through the pages. “There it is. It’s not a perfect match, but close enough.”
“Why not? If you really trust her,
“Exactly. I took care of that, now it’s your turn.”
“Draco! I was starting to worry about you.”
“Alright, that’s fair.” Still Potter slid the tin across the desk so Draco could reach it. “Not today though.” Upon encountering Draco’s narrowed eyes, Potter sighed theatrically and shook the tin. “Fine. Pick one for me.”

happen, be it a reservation at a fancy restaurant or a meeting with some high-up Ministry official. Blaise either knew someone or he at least knew someone who knew someone.
Potter crossed his arms and rolled his eyes, though he didn’t look all that offended. “You get pretty good at them after about a week on the run. I doubt even Ron’s mum could make a handful of wild mushrooms and berries of questionable origin taste nice. And we’re definitely not as good at cooking as her.”
They had tried to visit Harry several times when Draco had still been unconscious. But
Harry pinched his side. Then he angled his head downwards, so Draco couldn’t see his face anymore. “Alright ... God, it’s
Over the next half hour, the Falcons scored three and Puddlemere four more goals, Harry tricked Grant, his opposing Seeker, into barrelling into the stands, and Phaedra Armstrong was heavily favouring her left side after having taken a Bludger to the side and refusing to be healed.
Draco shrugged and propped up his chin. He was so damn tired. “Have you talked to Myrtle lately?”
“Only in the hallway!” Draco protested. “What did you do with all the stuff that was inside the house?”
“What are you doing?”
Also a big thanks to everybody who read my oneshot! :)

Her mate Octavius Ross inhaled suddenly and then whispered, awestruck, “It’s McCarthy.”
Harry just blinked, which was confirmation enough.

“That was all in defence!” said Draco.
“Yes,

Potter’s face lit up then, which did a
“Entirely possible,” said Draco glumly, resigning himself to his fate as Pansy pressed a fork into his hand.
“Just ignore it,” he whispered while pressing kisses against Harry’s throat at the same time. “I’m not home.”

today,” Harry grumbled, sitting down on the chair opposite him. “He seems to think that I’m trying to get out of it. As if I were stupid enough to think I could.”
Draco tried to grab Harry’s hands, but he couldn’t stop him from wiping them on the designer jeans Draco had picked out for him. Draco made an aborted noise that Harry commented with the raise of an eyebrow.
“Will you stop that?” he hissed. “People are looking at you like you’re mentally challenged.”
But then, in total contradiction to what he just said, Harry unearthed a can of spray cream. The can released a tiny white cloud that floated a mere two inches above Draco’s mug and snowed glittering flakes of whipped cream onto his hot chocolate.

As his quill was no longer a wand, Potter was unable to charm his players into moving. He settled on drawing a collection of very confusing lines, which somehow reminded Draco of the London tube map.

The fake gestured toward the chest and the tip of his wand crackled slightly. “Open it, and Potter doesn’t have to get hurt. Promise.”

Harry inhaled slowly. The intake of breath against his neck made Draco shiver and Harry draped the blanket tighter around them. “The structure’s damaged.”

Harry nodded slowly, but his brows were furrowed as he turned onto his back and stared at the ceiling. Draco suddenly wondered if Harry could be doubting
“I’ve almost figured it out,” Blaise insisted. “As soon as I’m done exposing Draco’s conspiracy, I’m focusing all my attention on the Council.”
Draco frowned. The weird feeling he’d had just a moment earlier was immediately replaced by irritation. He didn’t easily forget what he saw by means of Legilimency. There simply was no way that he was misremembering.
One of Potter’s hands twitched and Draco had the sudden suspicion that he was restraining himself from ruffling his hair. Instead, both hands slid from Draco’s shoulders and down the length of his arms, leaving them ice-cold and burning at the same time, before they came to rest around Draco’s wrists.
“That’s what too young means,” Draco said. “You should start with something easy instead. Maybe don’t choose a rivalling player, that could get complicated. Also, I would advise you to go for someone who is at least
“Are you actually insane?” Draco asked despite the lack of such atrocities as Cockroach Clusters or even blood-flavoured lollipops. “Did you bring the entire Gryffindor party stock?”
Potter’s eyes darted across his chest and then snapped up to his face. It was hard to tell with the greenish lighting and Potter’s tan skin, but it seemed that he was blushing. Fucking fantastic. So now that Potter had clued in on Draco’s obsession, it was suddenly weird?
“Everybody, this is Ma– Draco. He’s twenty-four years old, a Gemini, works as a doctor and loves long walks on the beach. I assume.”
Greyson was pointing his wand at the sky now and he felt something like a weight lift from his shoulders. Draco grabbed Blaise, whose dark skin had turned ashen. “Go to Mungo’s and tell them we're coming in with an emergency. Tell them it's Potter, hopefully successfully resuscitated. They need to prepare for surgery. Tell them to call in Meadows.”
Draco thought about it for a few seconds but in the end, his curiosity won out. “You may do

Harry’s voice.
“Way to make it all about you,” Draco said, though he couldn’t hide his own smile completely. “There are actual studies about Patronuses, you know? They tend to look a bit further than
Well, it certainly seemed like the only thing Draco would be kissing good night were his grand plans for the evening. With a heavy heart, he squeezed Potter’s hand. A second later, he was forced to let go, so Pansy could properly drag him back to their common room.

Harry sighed and let go of his hand, turning to face Kreacher. “Alright. Kreacher, I want you to come here every Sunday to clean. Take a break every three hours
When Draco came downstairs a few minutes later, dressed in his second-best sweater, Harry was already waiting for him in the hallway, holding Aurelius in his arms. They raised their eyebrows at each other.
“Well, this was embarrassing.” Marc slid from his bar stool with a sigh. “I kinda need brunch now. Tessa?”
Draco had never heard him so relieved. He nodded and inclined his head in the direction of the fireplace.
“I’m not really in a mood to explain it. Also, I’m gonna need my bag now.”
But Potter just grinned at him and lifted it up between thumb and index finger before letting it go. It hovered in the air between the two of them and they watched the tiny wings flutter happily.
make her cart go faster? Draco wouldn’t be surprised if Harry had just told him otherwise to sabotage him. He leaned forward as well – just the tiniest bit, so Harry couldn’t laugh at him. He couldn’t say if it worked, because then he hit a banana peel. This game made exactly zero sense. Draco loved it.
Harry rolled his eyes in exasperation, but he seemed to have given up on defending his food. “Whose side are you on?”
“Malfoy.” Wood was still squinting. Not a nice look on him.
Mason gasped excessively and pointed at Harry. “
He wished somebody would come in with something worse than broken bones. A severed spine, for example. That had kept him occupied for hours when Harry (
“Who is everybody?” asked Pansy, digging out her magazine from where she had stuffed it under a cushion. “Trelawney? That centaur?”
Draco shook her hand reluctantly, never letting the beasts out of his sight.
“Well, I was going to, but then you just handed me over to the Weasleys,” Harry muttered as he grabbed a paper towel, dampened it and cleaned the blood off his face carefully. “So, I wrote a very strongly-worded letter instead.”
The only ones who were cleared to enter the wing were the Healers assigned to his case and the people Granger granted permission, as Potter had named her his healthcare agent in emergency situations such as this.
Potter smacked the back of his head against the wall with a sickening thud and a deep sigh. On second thought, the noise was more satisfying than sickening.

“Don’t even think about it!”
“Did you hear?” said Tabitha urgently.
“I … I’m … what?”
Draco Apparated to the pitch and almost collided with Harry, who must have appeared at the same time. Draco grinned at him and Harry smiled.
? That’s most of the fun!”
“It’s kind of a rotating system. I think they’ve got like a hundred samples and each month you can choose between ten of them. Who you choose indicates your preferences. There’s one for straight witches, gay wizards and so on. Makes it rather easy to find someone to take home with you.”
“Oh,” said Harry tonelessly. “I forgot about that part.”
“Honestly, Matt. It was the morning after our break-up. I hadn’t slept at all. This isn’t like that. I’m not going to let you down this time.”
And then, out of the blue, she embraced Draco too, blubbering out a “Thank you”.
alright. They just hoped it would go away if they hushed it up.”
“I’m sorry.”
“That was weird,” Draco said, looking after him with a frown.
The daylight was blinding him even with both eyes closed, so he turned over onto his stomach, hiding his face in the crook of Harry’s neck. Harry plopped a cold hand onto Draco’s arm in response, clearly too sleepy to do anything more, and Draco shivered slightly.

“No arguments! You can't rely on the Malfoy name anymore; you need to start networking. And nowadays that includes anybody that Potter is friendly with.”
Draco leaned back on his hands and tilted his head back, groaning in frustration.
Well, at least there was just the one press representative present.
, Draco accepted his fate and fished his mobile out of his pocket to make Tessa suffer with him.
Draco wiped away the tears with the sleeve of his unhurt arm. A pair of hands landed on Draco’s chest and patted their way over to his shoulders, but when he opened his eyes, it was only Potter leaning over him. The hedge dug into his neck painfully as Draco recoiled at the sight of his face.
“Yes, certainly. Look, Mrs. Capitelli –”
,” Potter commented tonelessly. Draco turned to look at him, but Potter’s eyes were fixed on the picture. “How old is he?”
Draco received equal parts pitying and reproachful looks. Harry didn’t even have the decency to wake up, and the other occupants looked like they would straight up murder Draco if he dared do it for him, so he just pushed his chair back as far as he could with his elbows still resting on the table, and resumed his reading.
Draco helped him take off the robes, but the form-fitting sports gear underneath was clinging to him tightly, so Draco just vanished it, shirt and trackies.

“Oh, that’s nice,” she answered, sounding delighted (probably at having found out something new – nobody should be delighted about air mattresses). “Was your
too? Make me believe I did all those things you’re going to pin on me and let them take me to Azkaban.” Draco briefly debated telling him that he had informed the Aurors about the Polyjuice, but he feared that it could sabotage the investigation after his death.
Draco’s once light blue sweater was drenched in blood and a large metal part was sticking out of it. Draco’s hand found its way to his own side in a trance and came away wet.
He was just pondering what to do next, when Harry suddenly stormed back in and pointed his wand at Draco, whose mind did an instantaneous backflip in confusion.
far-fetched, was it? He had let Draco kiss him, after all. Twice!
“Oh ho ho,” chuckled Slughorn. “Of course this won’t be news to
right?”
“Since when do owls know how to ring a doorbell?” Potter yelled back suspiciously.
Draco was hammered. Bill's party was nothing like the ones he had attended at the Burrow. There were no grown-ups present (if one followed Draco’s example and thought of grown-ups as people over forty years old), but instead a very large crowd of young wizards and witches. Some of them were Curse Breakers at Gringotts (and most of those were probably Gryffindors). Then there were a ton of students from Bill's graduating class and a respectable amount of French people.
“I don’t want
“Well, seeing as I’ve only got
“And how am I to know that really was the reason? This could just as well be the potion speaking.”
And then something grabbed his leg from behind, yanking him back to the ground in one brutal stroke, and ropes wound all around him, tying him up tightly, locking his legs together and squeezing his arms against his chest. It felt like there was no air left in his lungs.
a punchbag.”
It was like getting hit with a Bludger to the eardrums. The noise doubled suddenly and Draco turned around to check if any of the players had followed him out onto the pitch to warrant that kind of racket, but the door was still closed. He walked alongside the pitch to the two benches that stood parallel to its middle line and sat down next to Tabitha Woods, who was there on behalf of the Appleby Arrows.
Touché. Draco decided to skip this topic for both their sakes. “You’re a wizard. Why did it take you an entire evening?”
They looked at each other again. Harry was probably trying to figure out what had gotten into her, and she seemed to assess his reaction. Then Harry shot a pointed look at the road and she turned away again.
Potter crossed his arms and glared at her without any force behind it. “I’m
Another shake of his head, clenched fists, a desperate breath.
December was ‘Harry’ assembling a snow man. As far as Draco could tell, he was completely naked. One of the snow balls was hovering in front of his private area. He was also wearing a red hat and scarf, but Draco didn’t count those as clothes. July had ‘Harry’ posing on a broom in just his pants, which were also red, of course.
She was still looking at him with her eyebrows raised though, making it clear that Draco’s meagre attempt wasn’t cutting it. Draco latched on to the strap of his messenger bag and Granger’s eyes were on his hands instantly.
“I’m still in the room, you know,” Draco complained. “I can hear you.”
Draco pulled his arm out of her grip with a
“Well it didn't hurt that much yesterday,” Potter tried to vindicate. “And I put your stupid essence of Angela on it, but it obviously doesn't do shit.”
Draco was almost too relieved to see him to chastise him.
“I mean that Italian boy,” she talked over him. “I think he spent the night a few weeks ago? I never saw him

Harry took a shuddering breath. “Fuck.”

“Oh, no.” Harry laughed coldly, and pointed his wand at Draco’s heart. “You won’t leave this house alive. You will assist me. Upstairs,
“Well, I have to care about all of that, so I’ll be dedicating my time to studying.”
“Not bad,” Potter acknowledged. “You should really get back into Quidditch.”
Alright, you guys are seriously on fire. I really hope I got all of you!
“It differs. Some Hufflepuffs think you’re going to slip him some kind of cursed book one of these nights.” Blaise didn’t look concerned. “Also, there’s a Ravenclaw who believes you’re trying to get on Potter’s good side through sheer exposure.” Blaise laughed once and then added, “And they’re supposed to be the smart ones. As if
“You really can’t, Harry,” Greyson agreed. “He still works for St. Mungo’s. And I’m the one who’s requesting him for our matches.”

“Draco …” Harry said his name softly, but then he took a deep breath and continued in much more tense voice. “I made them keep Snape’s portrait at Hogwarts, and he was at least partially responsible for my parents’ death. He took out his bitterness on literal children. He outed Remus purely out of spite. He wouldn’t have cared if the dementors had gotten Sirius even if he was innocent. If I can find it in me to do that for

When Draco kissed him softly, his lips were rough and dry, and still it was one of the best kisses they had ever shared. When Harry’s eyes fell shut a few minutes later, there was a smile on his lips.
Pince, who wasn’t allowed to permanently ban them from the library despite her vehement protests, took to following them around and breathing down their necks whenever they stepped foot in her domain. Both of them were banned from borrowing any books at all.
“So what, are you gonna tell me

“Just resting my eyes,” Harry muttered. “Ginny made us get up at six. On a bloody Saturday. Literally dragged me out of bed. Hit my head on the edge.”
Blaise took the sweater from Ginny and turned it around. Stitched to the front was a silvery-white falcon.
And then,
Draco mentally added ‘Ancients’ to his list of Muggle things he’d have to look up later.
“I’d really like to see that.” Blaise grinned. “But be that as it may. Harry agreed it would be less suspicious if I went in first. People are already confused about why he was there for your stabbing in Muggle London in the first place.”

“He’s thirty-seven. I would marry him on the spot if I weren’t already shackled to you.”
Harry must’ve seen him coming out of the corner of his eye, but Draco caught his fist easily. Harry growled like an injured (but furious) animal, his eyes wild and unfocused. After a second, he seemed to recognise him and some of the tension left his body.
Harry gritted his teeth. “I’m not going to talk about that here.”
McAllister shook his head, scrutinizing Draco over the table even as she unloaded their drinks.

Draco raised an eyebrow. “And I can’t heal his spleen and ribs while the Body-Bind is compressing his torso.”
“Slander,” said Harry lightly. From his backpack he unloaded the usual box of sweets, filled to the brim like always, no matter how much they ate last time.
Draco locked the doors with a flick of his wand to prevent the Muggles from escaping after his shield was gone. He couldn’t risk them running around and telling the whole hospital about some daemonic happening and subsequent vanishing.
“Stop it, Harry!”
“This is not a date, Potter. How many times do I have to tell you?”
“We are at our best together,” Potter disagreed.
“What’s so funny?” he asked, grinning too.
“I don’t know … I guess the first time I noticed him acting strange was … what, two years ago?”

“Looks like you’ll be here for a while,” he said to his patient, grabbing a roll of pressure bandages to immobilize the footrest. “Your friends should go home.”
“Oh, Harry is not coming,” Luna (unicorn) interjected in her usual dreamy voice. Draco turned to stare at her, his eyebrows knit together tightly.
“You wouldn’t have lasted a day in Slytherin,” Draco said drily, scarcely trying to hide his disappointment.
To answer a question: I don’t reply to individual comments, because a) it takes too much time and b) it feels like cheating, bloating up the comment section like that.

Harry breathed out noisily and rolled off Draco to snatch his wand from the side table. Turning back into his own self only took a second and Harry didn’t seem all that annoyed anymore when Draco pushed him onto his back and rolled on top of him.

“Naturally.”
Potter shrugged lightly. “Should be enough for an A?”

“I think I had a great-great-great grand uncle of that name,” muttered Draco, burying his face in the crook of Harry’s neck. “Amongst others, of course. He had at least five names. Cepheus Something Ophiuchus Something Arvin Black. Very sophisticated.”
these things are?”
“Gay!” Lauren yelled from somewhere up ahead. Then, before Draco could give Harry a very pointed look, she added, “Come on, we want pizza.”
“The way I see it, he’ll be furious anyway.”
Draco pondered this for a few seconds. “
“Right …,” said Draco slowly. He didn’t know what to say to that, so he just levitated the book over onto Potter’s side of the table. “You’ll take care of that, then?”
Draco, who had not expected to see him again
good to see you. How are you?”
“He that will not hear must feel,” Draco replied, nodding at the quill, which began to fly over the chart (much to Potter’s protest).
“Stay awake, Potter. I don’t know when the others will be back.”

have thought that Draco was as touchy-feely with his friends and ex-enemies as he was, right? Potter wasn’t stupid.
Draco was on his third helping when doubt started to creep into his mind. Did he
“It’s not cursed, is it?” asked Draco, even as he was casting his spell, muttering under his breath as he studied the results, “No, there’s no trace of dark magic. Trauma?”
Maybe not the best alibi while only wearing underwear, but there it was.
“You are awfully confident,” Draco judged. “One of these days, you will find out that not everybody is at your beck and call.”
“What the – I’m not
That was how Draco found himself pulling Harry’s t-shirt over his head in a hurry while Harry tried to keep kissing his neck (which was exactly as impossible as it sounded). Maybe Draco shouldn’t have pulled the guy with the concussion from his sofa. In hindsight, that had been a pretty dismal medical decision.
And wow, where did
Potter swung his legs out of bed energetically without falling over, which he took as an overall good sign. Draco took a hasty step forward and prevented Potter from standing up by placing both hands on his shoulders. There still was the thing about Potter
When he finally managed to get his breathing back under control a few minutes later, Potter stood leaning against one of the sinks. Draco ignored him as well as he could and rinsed his mouth with water about twenty times.
“You let Harry boss you around
“Because she’s my friend and also Team Captain? Plus, she’s not an
“Tell you what: You can hold onto my arm and I won't have to touch you at all,” Draco offered. “You can even pinch me if you get too fed up with me, which I'm sure will happen sooner rather than later.”

painful somersault.
– but Draco had long since stopped trying to keep him from touching his arm like there wasn’t that fucking horrible scar branded into his skin. Harry only got angry at him if he did it, and Draco wanted to
Beater Easton Haynes laughed. “Again? Just two more and you’ll break the record.”
“Okay, yeah, fine! Sorry!”
Draco frowned. “What happens if there is no fight at all until we leave here?”
Potter was still pretending to be totally engrossed in his breakfast, but Weasley caught his eyes and narrowed his own at him at once, obviously hissing about it to Potter, who just shrugged.
Harry laughed and then groaned because of his ribs. He leaned down and Draco came up to meet him halfway automatically. Harry kissed him softly and then leaned his forehead against Draco’s.
Potter leaned his head back and grinned at him upside down. “Must have caught a slight case of whatever you were down with last week. But I’m all better now. As are you, apparently.”
, you say? I would not know about that.”
There was a sudden flash of light and Dayal, who was the Wasps’ Healer now, shouted something, but Draco couldn’t hear him through the thunder.
“Yeah, well,” said Ginny casually, gesturing with the card picturing herself. “Wasn’t meant to be. It was a long time ago and we’ve moved on, so no harm done, really.”
It was after eleven when they stumbled out of the fireplace at Grimmauld Place. Harry didn’t even bother with brushing the soot off his clothes. His shoulders were slumped, his eyes drooping. He was completely done for the day after spending the last four hours raging about the press and speculating about Chang’s attacker with almost the whole Weasley clan, all of whom seemed to have been informed that Harry was at the Burrow almost immediately.
Something inside Draco’s stomach twisted and twitched, and he hated it. He was unsteady, completely out of his depth, unsure how to proceed, and he
“Right? Those stupid fireworks, fucking hell. And now I’ve got to spend my birthday cold and wet and miserable. And it’s so bloody loud up there like you wouldn’t believe. I couldn’t even hear that fucking Bludger until it hit me.”
“Your boyfriend’s a model?” asked Draco, because he had been much too quiet for his own liking, there was an opening in the conversation and it was the first thing that came to mind.
?” Draco gestured at Potter’s bag. “You just wrote that down in one go, just the way it popped into your head?”
They were climbing the steps into the castle now, joining a stream of fourth-year Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, who’d just come from Care of Magical Creatures and started walking a little faster when they spotted the approaching Slytherins.

“A late birthday present? Is it more clothes?” Draco asked hopefully, approaching the chest.
“– of insults, yeah. I didn’t know it extended that far.”

“It’s not my fault you don’t have any self-preservation skills, Potter.” Not that Potter had to fear that
“I –”
“You’re probably not thinking about the right things,” Harry said quite unhelpfully.
“That’s actually impressive,” Draco said carefully, tracing the letters with a fingertip.
“Well of course not, it gets confused when there’s magic,” Draco said. “Everybody knows that.”
Potter sighed heavily and pushed both hands into his pockets. “Still dead. Achilles too, now. Completely ruined my evening.”
Draco briefly debated telling him that hypothetical intruders would actually have an

“It is! You cook too much.”
“– going anywhere,” Draco finished for him. “Don’t worry, Jian. His manners are
That evening, Draco was sitting at their new small and round kitchen table, watching the picture in front of him loop for easily the tenth time.
Draco too liked sharing with Potter. Not necessarily sweets, though. Also, not necessarily right then and there. He took a step back and rubbed his rear. (It didn’t even hurt, but Draco definitely needed a bit of distance if he wanted to retain at least a bit of his decency. By the way Potter watched him, he knew exactly what was going through Draco’s head.)
“So,” said Draco instead, “how do you feel about Blaise just
“I haven’t even seen my lawyer yet, Weasley! They can’t just do this! I have the right to see my lawyer before my hearing. They
Draco eyed Potter’s quite formal get-up suspiciously. “Are you going somewhere?”
Abby giggled and Potter gave her a stern look. Then he took a deep breath and soldiered on. “So, I went home with him, as you do –”
“Draco, you’re bleeding.”

“Even more reason to do something fun!” Harry said energetically. Draco just grumbled. “Well,” Harry continued. “I guess if you can’t move

“I don’t need your pity. I worked my arse off to get to where I am now and I won’t let

It was barely a whisper, but Draco knew it was he who had said it.

“Perks of being a healer”

“You deserved it!”
McAllister nodded, so Draco leaned back in his chair, taking another sip of his water. He knew that McAllister was in already.
He could feel Harry’s presence at his back, but nothing else happened except that Harry repeated, “What’s wrong?”.
secrets.”
He stood ramrod straight, unsure what to do. He couldn't even remember the last time someone had given him a hug. But before he had even time to pat her back or something, she had already let go of him again.
He wondered why the map showed the Squid but not any of the other animals. Maybe the giant sea monster was the only thing Granger deemed important enough to keep tabs on. That seemed sensible.
Potter was already inspecting the massive towers of books behind the backmost shelves. There were rows and rows of them, arranged in a vast circle that left a free patch in the middle, circa twenty feet in diameter, with a small table at its centre.
“I like to take the leftovers to work,” Draco lied.
The boys’ dormitory was blissfully empty. Well, if you only counted people. Talking about clothes and books and candy wrappers,
It was just that this had seemed like the most obvious choice. Wizarding locations were out of the question, he couldn’t take him to Linh’s, and there weren’t any other Muggle places he knew.
The real Harry sighed and pulled Draco closer. Draco brushed his hair back (it was tickling his cheek) and pressed his lips against Potter’s throat, whispering, “This is much better than your insane trips, isn’t it?”
Draco looked up from Chang to meet Nash’s eyes. “Then what do you need me for? You know how to heal a cut.”
Some of the team wished him a nice birthday, but nobody seemed really sad to see him go, if you didn’t count Greyson’s daughter. She stared after him in disbelief, looking on the verge of running after him. She probably wasn’t used to seeing people defy her father that openly.
“Flying accident.” Pomfrey looked from Potter to Draco with a very sceptical expression.
Draco grimaced at the sight. The snake had several deep, lacerated wounds that could well have been caused by the talons of a predator bird.
“Umm ...” Liv said, thinking hard. “I only learned how to swim when I met Lauren. A twenty-year-old girl taking beginners’ lessons. It was embarrassing.”
Potter shrugged, pulled a kitchen towel from one of his cupboards and started drying up their mugs. “I’ve got it.”
It was a tiny golden orb on a thread of silver. Draco grabbed Harry’s own pendant – silver wings on a golden thread – and held them next to each other.
“Probably,” said Potter. “But then it wouldn’t be as much fun.”
“What time is it?” Potter asked while sitting up and stretching his arms above his head, which exposed his newest scar at the side of his stomach.
“I think I’m close to the answer.”
“So she’s not in her bathroom. Did you check the one where I met her? On the sixth floor?”
“Somebody gave me a ride,” Draco lied. “And I know a shortcut.”
It went like this: Draco was done with his last patient around half past seven in the morning. He took a quick shower, dried his hair off with his wand and then immediately got it all wet again when he stepped outside and into the pouring rain.
Hermione took out her wand and drew two chairs for herself and Ron. They landed on the side of Harry, so Draco wouldn’t have to look between them.
had buried her filthy hands in it), “If you go home and rest for a few hours, I’ll still pick you up at eight for the party.”
Harry twirled them around again, and they inevitably spun out of control as Draco’s knees buckled and he desperately tried to keep upright by pulling himself up by Harry’s pullover.
Why did it always have to be
Weasley scoffed and led him into his tiny office. They sat down in battered chairs on either side of Weasley's desk.
owl and it was just concerned about him? Draco tried to get on its good side by bribing it with owl biscuits, but it just glared at him and wouldn't touch them even if he left them on the side table.
Draco leaned away so his back hit the wall and then squinted until he could make out the words, mirror-inverted as they were. Harry’s cheek read,
“No no, don’t sell yourself short.” Harry dropped the last piece of toast back onto his plate, having eaten none of them. “You were pretty successful at times.”
“Damn near thing,” muttered Draco, wrenching his eyes away from Granger and Weasley, who were very much present.
“I’ll –!”
They ordered their usual and then watched her out of sight. Harry turned to face Draco as soon as she vanished into the kitchen.
He turned Harry’s hand palm-up, but could find no injury, only the old scar at his wrist.
“And tie up your hair when you’re working,” Draco added. “Didn’t you read the guidelines?”
!” Draco said exasperatedly. He went over to the closet, pulled out a pair of jeans and a sweater at random and threw them at Potter.
Harry laughed loudly. Draco tried not to look in his direction. It was hard. Harry was leaning across the table (which meant closer to Draco) to be able to look at Lauren.
When Draco knocked at Blaise’s door for their usual Wednesday Dinner, he wasn’t home. Sooky opened the door and informed him that the Master had yet to come back from the workshop. Draco declined her offer to wait for him in the parlour and borrowed Blaise’s owl instead.
Tessa elbowed him in the side, snatched away the pen and then scribbled furiously,
After reading another chapter of his current book (
They turned around. Charlie Weasley was coming over to them from the Harpies’ stands, where Bill, Fleur, Granger and Weasley were still standing, apparently waiting for him.
Draco laughed harshly. “You think he’ll let Harry bloody Potter go before he agrees to communicate through Samantha?”
They stayed like that for a minute, just listening as the angry voices grew closer and closer, and Draco let his wand drop into his hand as silently as he could, concentrating on the door and thinking,
Before Draco could question any of it, letters and lines blossomed on the parchment, forming what seemed to be a map. Little black dots scurried across it like tiny ants. Draco stepped nearer and looked down at it.
To say that Draco felt relieved would have been an understatement. He was elated. Ecstatic. Inappropriately happy considering the circumstances, but there it was.
“You’re
Harry closed his eyes in denial and swiftly switched the topic. “So, are you gonna stay or what?”
It came back to bite Draco in the arse faster than he would have anticipated. He had barely opened his eyes on Friday morning when Potter’s harsh, somewhat panicked voice reached him in the sitting room.
It took twenty whole minutes to instruct Samantha, who gave him a weak, decidedly worried-looking smile when she left.
Draco lifted his chin up. “I think I’m handling this better than you did.”
was something he could easily believe.
Before Draco could grasp what was about to happen, Potter had already pushed him through the tapestry and into the corridor he’d come from.
“Let’s see. They exposed my private life, which I’m still angry about. They ruined my relationship, which makes me fucking livid. And most of all: They caused Potter to be suspended, which should make
The usher raised his eyebrows in clear disbelief. “Sure, and I am friends with Celestina Warbeck.”
Draco shot Harry a look that clearly conveyed that there simply was no way in hell he would get into that car. Everybody knew those things were unsafe. Draco could tell by the grin that spread on Potter’s face that he could read his expression perfectly.
“That’s a good boy,” Draco said praisingly.
Potter looked like he still might argue, but then Draco’s alarm clock went off upstairs. They were left staring at each other silently. The alarm stopped and Aurelius barked three times.
“Well, whoever it was, they did a pretty good job faking your signatures,” said Blaise as he opened his notebook and slid it over so they could see. “Yours is pretty accurate, except for that loopy bit with the ‘M’ here – You stopped doing that the day you turned fourteen, remember? – and his is just damn near perfect.”
“Yes, thank you, it was really ... something else,” he said, bending down to rouse Aurelius.
Blaise looked offended. “I’m not giving up on this. I’ve already composed a list of suspects to interrogate next. I could meet them in Firenze’s classroom. I’ve
Draco hadn’t initially known what to make of Davenport, who was the first female Slytherin player in almost two decades and the first female captain since there was Quidditch at Hogwarts. But it seemed that she was ready to make short work of anyone who wasn’t up to the task. They were barely three minutes into the trials, and she’d already weeded out one-third of all applicants, half of which were on their way to the hospital wing now.
“Never mind,” Harry said brusquely, letting go of him immediately. “I didn’t mean it.”
“That’s not –” muttered Marc, but Tessa cut right across him. “Marc actually hides when he sees him anywhere. It’s a real Greek tragedy.”
“You know I’m not actually –”
Harry straightened again, and Draco could see something small and square in his hands when he looked down.
Draco frowned, trying to fight his way through the muddy swamp that was his head right now. And then the scales fell from his eyes and his stomach dropped. He felt sick.
” he slurred drowsily, throwing back the blanket and sitting up on the edge of his bed. “Harry?”
The clock struck ten some time later, and Draco snuck another glance at Potter, wondering if he would acknowledge that their time was up or if tonight would be one of those where he didn’t feel the need to flee as soon as he wouldn’t have to feel guilty about it.
he get in?” Draco just couldn’t make sense of it. “He Apparated directly into your house; he shouldn’t have been able to do that.”
Mulberry managed to glance at his partner without moving his head an inch. The Auror stepped aside, conjured his eagle Patronus and muttered some instructions.
Harry shrugged lightly. “We are friends. Sometimes we have some fun, but never anything
. You’re blowing this way out of proportion. It was just a kiss, nothing else. I was really drunk. And if it helps, I wouldn’t have done it if I had known.”
Instead, he unlocked the door and fled. There was a guy at the washbasin, and he made a decidedly judgemental face as they made eye contact in the mirror. Draco grabbed their things and trusted that Harry would follow.
“He’s the son of God, who died for our sins,” Harry explained, still trying to animate Odysseus. “He’s also the reason we have Christmas and Easter.”
But she didn’t seem very sorry about that. The wizard had probably given her attitude. Draco didn’t want to know how long he had been waiting already.
Potter snorted, shaking his head. “

“I have one too, you know?”

Title: The Prodigy - Invaders Must Die
Draco snorted. He couldn’t help it – it was just that absurd, coming from Harry of all people, who should’ve recognised it right away. “A
Draco opened the window and the owl landed on his arm. It didn’t object to being petted by him while he read the letter, and closed its eyes in contentment. Why couldn’t Greyson employ more of this kind of owl? Did he think he had to impress Harry with that big-arse monster he usually sent him?
!” Harry trailed off there, brushing a strand of curly hair out of his face before shaking his head and squaring his shoulders. “And I couldn’t exactly take my test with a ministry official when I turned seventeen, could I now?”
in between. Very aristocratic. Astoundingly avant-garde,” said Harry. “So, it’s decided then?”
The potatoes had just jumped out of their skin when the window opened and Odysseus flew in. Draco picked up Emerald, who was coiled in a sunny spot on the counter, and retreated to another corner of the kitchen. He told himself it was to keep her safe, seeing as he had first met her with a serious raptor wound, but if the snake managed to keep the owl at bay, that was just as well.
Blaise drew himself up to full height. “The Council of Serpents is an ancient tradition!”
Draco couldn’t stop himself from grinning. “Is that why you abducted me earlier?”
Harry punched Olivia’s ex-boyfriend in the face.”
Draco finally dared to ask when they were waiting for the lift to arrive.
“Friends,” said Draco, who’d had time to think it over.
“They don’t!” Potter said, scandalised.
It was obvious that she hadn’t heard about the accident, or else she would have asked after Harry. Then again, that wasn’t very surprising. Draco didn’t suppose that any of the others had had much reason to visit a pub during these hard times.
you can eat all that by yourself!” Potter exclaimed, gesturing at the containers that were still on his kitchen table. “Why did you even order all that stuff?”
It was so utterly tasteless that Draco couldn’t help but laugh. Then he remembered
Harry sighed impatiently. “Then maybe her brother took the Potion and tipped him off.”
you?!”
Harry let go of him to press both hands against the scar, like it was causing him enormous pain. Draco scrambled to get his wand and then knelt down next to Harry.
“I’m not daft, Ron,” Potter said, grinning and clasping his shoulder. “I’m taking the Cloak, of course.”
“No.” Now Draco turned his chair around too. Even though he tried to suppress his frustration, his voice still sounded angry. “I wanted to say sorry. And thank you for saving my life.”
“Very well,” said Professor Vector, dragging Draco’s attention back to the front.
Harry and Liam were officially the most bizarre couple Draco had ever met. Jealousy seemed to be a foreign concept to them. Draco kind of got it, in Harry’s case. Because, honestly, if you looked like
He would have loved to just take Harry and leave, but it wasn’t Angelina’s birthday for another two hours. Also, people would talk if they saw Draco and a Harry Potter look-alike leave together. Somehow, he didn’t think that the overall reaction would be positive. Why did Harry have to be such a
“Because I thought you ought to know. I’ve also heard things,” continued Felicity in a lower voice, “about the team’s financial situation. That’s why the American is here, isn’t it?”
It only lasted for a second – the moment Potter noticed, his own smile faded slowly, and then Draco’s was gone as well and his concentration was back on the book and the page that he hastily Reparo-ed back into it.
Blaise and Ginny had already cleared the table from books and parchment and were now busy cutting the pizzas.

Potter jabbed him in the side twice in quick succession, but Draco could see the corner of his mouth twitch. “Sod off, you
would have liked to hex him,” Harry grumbled as he slapped the briefcase onto his kitchen counter.
anymore.”
He flopped onto his stomach and leaned over the edge of his bed, waiting for something green and silver to catch his eye. There was nothing underneath there. Draco ruffled his curtains half-heartedly, in case his tie had gotten caught up between them and the bed, but there was nothing silver there either.
Merlin help him.
Draco shrugged again and held out a hand for his own backpack. “It’s going alright, I guess. I just tell people I was raised in a cult. Most don’t ask follow-up questions. And if they do, I’m allowed to act all distressed.”
Pansy turned her hand to look at her left little finger. “Motherf-”
else who can do it.”
Harry let go of him and stuffed the letter into his back pocket. He caught Draco staring and gave him a weak smile. “You shouldn’t look at your mail for a while. I’ll keep an eye on it for you, alright?”
And Harry said the last thing Draco would’ve expected, which was: “Her name is Pansy Parkinson.”
After thoroughly examining and then disinfecting him, they took him to a three-bed room.
“I’m gonna hold your hand so hard,” Harry said fiercely, grabbing both of them like he was trying to prove a point. Then he nodded down at his toothpaste streaked torso. “So, are you gonna help me with that? You
Draco couldn’t help but roll his eyes. He had the strong urge to insult McAllister, so he took a sip of his water instead.
to be annoying about ten percent of the time.”
Watching Weasley watch the memory was very amusing. He winced and held his breath animatedly and finally put the Memoriculars down.
Ginny bent down to fetch the sweater, muttering something under her breath that sounded very much like
And then they were laughing. The sound of both their voices was filling the room and Draco was hit with the realisation that this was the first time they were both laughing about the same thing. Until now they had usually laughed at the expense of one another. He decided, then and there, that he really liked how their laughter blended together.

“But you
.” Draco fell back onto his bed and stared at the ceiling. He inhaled sharply when the impact jostled his injured arm, but he hardly cared about that at the moment. Now what? He couldn’t get expelled! He needed his N.E.W.T.s! Badly!
This managed to confuse Potter. “Moaning Myrtle? What’s she got to do with Chocolate Frogs?”
His money was on Fred Weasley. Harry’s father or godfather would have been more comprehensible, but he wouldn’t have called them a ‘friend’. Or maybe the person didn’t have to be dead? There was no telling if they had been real or just a figment of his imagination.
Something ice-cold slid down his back as she turned his hand over carefully, making the inside of his left arm face up. Her eyes were much softer than Draco would ever have thought possible, and she
“You shouldn’t have,” Draco teased, ignoring the tingling feeling in his stomach. “I hope it wasn’t too much of a bother?”
“We were on the topic of drinking,” said Callum suddenly.
“Did he have a scar? Right here!” Draco jabbed at his own forehead.
“By the way, this does not excuse your tardiness. You owe me an hour of my life.”
“You’re not selling

“Ah, don’t worry.” Potter waved the concern away. “Pince already asked me about it and I told her we spent our whole Monday session working on a particularly cursed book. We’ll just tell her that it took another two hours. She’ll never know. Besides, we did overtime on Friday.”

was painted completely gold, wearing only metallic pants and what appeared to be Snitch wings on his back.
“Don’t bother,” Draco said, opening the door halfway.
Wow. Great. Exactly what Draco wanted to hear while Harry was searching for the person who was selling him out.
“No wonder you don’t ever shut up,” Draco laughed. “Can’t even shut your trap properly.”
Potter didn’t seem bothered by the criticism in the slightest. “I made sure that my essay meets the length requirement, don’t worry.”
Draco supposed they did make an odd couple, Harry completely bundled up and Draco just in his thin, short-sleeved scrubs (under which he always wore a long-sleeved shirt, for obvious reasons). Harry let go of Draco’s arm almost immediately and threw on his Invisibility Cloak as soon as the wizard was out of sight.
“Anytime,” said Felicity pleasantly.
Draco got to his feet automatically, not wanting to cower before Potter. He felt completely useless – he did not know what Weasley would say in this situation. Talking about feelings was considered to be in very bad taste, so Pure-blood families never did it. Well, at least the proper ones didn’t.
“Just demonstrating how easy it is to break into your house,” said a rough voice right next to his ear, warm breath tickling his neck.

She seemed to notice his hands on her shoulder and turned bright red. Harry took his hands back, probably taking it as a sign that he was making her uncomfortable.
“Why is it that you are way more worried

“Wha- why would Potter be
“Well, you looked guilty, for one. Also, that’s a very long letter for that little information.”
He spotted him sitting around one of the bonfires with his team, feeding scraps of food to the salamanders flitting through the flames. He was laughing happily and Draco’s heart clenched suddenly.
No reaction. Draco wasn’t even sure that he had been noticed – Potter seemed completely lost in his book. His eyes were racing across the page and there was a frown on his face.
Jarrett Abrams was lying on one of the benches in the locker room, a newspaper floating above his face.
Narcissa looked him up and down, eyes lingering on his hair, which was probably a mess, and his sweater, which was actually the one Harry had lent him their first Christmas together. There also was dog hair all over it, because he had found Aurelius curled up on it.
“I’m not taking you because you are
Teddy lit up immediately and dashed forward, coming to a stop when he reached the stadium, where he practically bounced in excitement.
“Probably,” Blaise agreed. He placed the loose page inside his notebook and used a spell to secure it. “Draco, do you have any idea who had access to the catalogue?”
Harry actually leaned a little away from her. “Yeah. There’s no

It was only Emerald. Of course it was, because what else would it be?

her, genius. We’ll just say we had a small flying accident down on the pitch.” Finally, Potter pulled a small, silvery bundle from his backpack and put it back on. “Let’s go.”
“Here’s a tip,” said Liam gravely. “Check to see that you haven’t got any important things still lying around his flat before you break up with someone. Like the only copy of a paper that took you three weeks to write.”
“What

“Is it really?” Abby certainly seemed surprised.

“Yeah. That way I can keep an eye on it,” Potter said, gesturing at the window. “And nobody would suspect that I live right across from it.”
Draco reached over Harry’s head and handed him the movie he was pointing at. “I’m just
And then Harry went ahead and ruined it by freezing, by withdrawing his lips from Draco’s and whispering, “What’s wrong?”
“I got hit by McCarthy, who got hit by a Bludger, that stupid hag. Wouldn't have happened if she had just dodged. Probably did it on purpose,” Potter grumbled, brushing away some hair that had gone astray.
“Neither one of us should do it,” Draco said promptly, even though they were just pretend-strategizing and Coach Greyson would talk Potter out of it (Draco hoped) if he did end up remembering any of this later.

Harry stared at him for a few seconds and then stuffed his wand back into his robes. The whole group seemed to exhale collectively. Dayal felt his face, which was bruising already.

Draco laughed. It was nice seeing Harry not completely in control while on the pitch. He was still an excellent flier and managed to catch the Quaffle just fine, but the rest wasn’t as polished. He had serious trouble communicating a strategy with Ron, who had to lunge after the Quaffle, as it drifted off to the right whenever Harry passed it to him.
tried to jinx Harry behind his back.
Blaise was not at home when Draco came calling. He let himself in by touching the front door with his wand, but it was completely quiet inside. The sitting room, where Blaise spent most of his free time, was deserted. A half-full cup of tea stood on a little side table, but it was cold to the touch.
Would they even know Harry’s name?
he hissed. “You said this was a Muggle area!”
, and would pay for that later. Draco hadn’t yet decided between Canary Cream and Tiger Tarts. He supposed he could always mix them together. Maybe he would even do it in the Great Hall. (But probably not – he couldn’t afford to get into trouble).
The third door finally led to the bedroom. Draco immediately dropped Potter onto the bed, which was neatly made (something Draco never got around to do himself). He didn’t fancy pulling the blanket out from under Potter – his arms were aching as it was already – so he just enveloped him in it like a bird closing its wings around itself. Or maybe like a crimson burrito.
“Think about it? Yeah, I did. Really consider it? No. I still had unfinished business.”

chivalrous of Draco to carry any one of them at all) and led the way out of the study space.
And Harry laughed and put the apron on while Draco unwrapped all his other presents, including a guide book on how to effectively teach adolescent athletes and a Weasley sweater with the Hogwarts crest on the front.

“Not because of
Draco exchanged a look with Harry, who also seemed to suspect where this was going.
“Yes,” Draco cut across him. “We met at the pub. I asked him to look into your case, try to find out who’s behind it.”
Harry took off his robes and threw them into the laundry basket. He didn’t take off the sports gear underneath, which was a relief to Draco, who at least wanted to pretend to separate his work from his private life.

“I wasn’t going to kill him! He’s
Blaise had picked Draco up at nine in the evening (to make sure he was really going) and – after the girls were done hugging him like someone who had just come back from the dead – assigned him a chair.
He didn’t know why he’d said it (though he

The crowd seemed to be sure that McCarthy had unwisely pointed out the Snitch, and the cheering picked up a notch. Draco had watched Harry play countless times and knew that wasn’t it.

. No doubt about it. Merlin, this was definitely worth the run, and Draco didn’t even care that Red thought he was somebody named Liam. This was the least he could do after abducting Draco.
“Late? It’s barely noon.”
Tessa didn’t waste any time to ask her question as soon as Draco sat down at their usual table. She never did. This time, she didn’t even look up from the menu.
He pointed his wand at the area of impact while Harry shrugged and pointed his own wand at something over Draco’s shoulder (probably the potatoes).
“Some hooligan punched me in the face,” Draco grumbled. “Should’ve known better than to trust that he wouldn’t bite the hand that heals him.”
Harry looked back at him. A light reflected in his eyes, turning them an almost unnatural colour of the most vivid green, which made Draco’s hair stand on end.
“It’s probably best if you go home now, before your parents start to wonder where you are. What did you tell them? Tea at the Walkers’? Wouldn’t want to be you if they ever found out you’ve been trashing playgrounds instead.”
“You’re so extra, with your secret lair and all.” Draco kissed the top of his head, even if it undermined his own point. “So, what else was I secretly right about?”
Draco had a short internal debate whether he just ought to slap a hundred pounds on the table and be done with it, but ultimately, he decided against it.
“Where did you hear that?” Greyson sounded slightly panicked.
“He barely got hurt,” Potter said shortly, clenching his left fist.
Potter opened his mouth in outrage and pushed Draco’s shoulder. Both of them swung apart – the string was wrenched out of Draco’s ear rather painfully – and then slammed together barely a second later. Potter was knocked from his seat and landed with his back in the sand, clinging to the chain with one hand and pressing the Walkman to his chest with the other.
“Focus! Best thing for us would be an alibi, but I doubt we can fabricate one this fast. First, we’ve got to heal each other. You’ve got rope burn all over your arms and probably your legs too. Not much use denying anything when you look like
Draco smiled weakly, which made Harry smile for real. Beside him, the Patronus glowed a little brighter.
As Draco laid in bed an hour later, thinking about Potter’s Invisibility Cloak and his glamour and his nightmares and the way he didn’t want any strangers touching him, he was sure that it was the latter. Potter was definitely not okay and probably hiding behind a vast number of spells, even six years later.
; Draco didn’t know just how popular the sport was. Either way, Draco didn’t really have much confidence in Harry’s aim.
“Where’s your bedroom?” Draco asked, wiggling his shoulder to rouse Potter.
Harry returned the condescending look. “Oh
Draco was very thankful for Blaise, who immediately launched into an extensive lecture that saved Draco from having to reply. What was he even supposed to say to that? Every single time Potter opened up to Draco, he proved himself to be about the most forgiving person he had ever met. (Well, except for Lovegood, who was an all-around surreal experience.)
“She’s right, though,” said Easton Haynes as he pulled his shirt over his head in one swift move that revealed his very bulky chest.
Though Draco very much wanted to argue his case, he also wanted to leave as quickly as possible. He doubted there was just a slight chance they could do that right now, so he just glared at Harry over his shoulder and headed for the stairs.
“Only if it doesn’t last longer than two seconds.” That was proper etiquette, if one really did need to hug at all.
“No!”
Draco stumbled off the sofa, grabbed his wand and followed Potter’s voice almost blindly, wondering just what the hell could have happened now.
“You’re dripping on my floor,” said Draco calmly. Then, when Harry looked down to watch the dripple of toothpaste, he added, “I am displeased because you made a scene. That was highly inappropriate.”
Harry’s grin widened. “God, I wish you’d have let me stay.”
“Not until you mentioned it just now.”
wanted Harry out of it now.
Lancaster only glanced at Draco before he left them alone again.
Draco grabbed a quill and positioned it on a fresh piece of parchment. Then he floated his memory of the day’s Charms lesson into the stone basin and went in face first.
have it in you, don’t you think?”
As the darkness tightened around them and smashed them together, Draco’s world dissolved into an endless series of somersaults. The journey was halted very suddenly when he made full-body contact with the ground, but his brain kept right on spinning.
“Can’t help it if it is the truth,” said Draco as he returned to his own side of the table and righted his chair with a flick of his wand. “Also, you put me there.”
“What do you think you are doing?”
. No way, I would never.”
Draco wouldn’t have thought it possible for the library to become any quieter, but students seemed to hold their breath, motionless in their seats.
“No, I’m not,” muttered Draco, pulling Harry in for another real kiss.
The following bus ride was much more bearable – they had no trouble getting seats and the bus was much quieter. Potter leaned his head against the window and dosed off while Draco studied the landscape outside. He had never seen so much of Richmond before.
“Oh?” Draco propped his head up. “Were you trying to impress me?”
stupid. He did not mention Crabbe, after all.
he was still maintaining that.
Montgomery grinned. “You didn’t answer the question.”
The songs in this chapter are:
“Because Serenity is a dirty liar!” yelled Valdez, dropping his hands and balling them into fists. His face was red and streaked with tears, which was not a good look on him.
Draco picked up a flat box and opened it. Inside was a rich, emerald green scarf. He took it out and turned it over in his hands, the cool silk gliding through his fingers like water.
Draco focused his attention back on the door.
bossy,” Potter said, getting up and walking to the bathroom under Draco’s watchful eyes.
“Not particularly,” said Draco, who wasn’t that into Healing Tape and bruises that spanned half the torso. “What did Greyson want now?”
“Don’t encourage him,” Draco said. “Blaise, this is madness. Please tell me you didn’t spend all of your free time on this.”
“I’m right across the hall. Just call if you need anything,” he said, not expecting a response and raising his wand.

“Don’t you dare!” called Draco after him, but he had already disappeared into what had to be the bedroom. Draco turned to face the girls. “

“They are improving it!” Draco said defensively. “They are searching for ways to make it safer. No foul play there at all.”

was probably disfigured, and his shirt sleeves were ripped in at least two places. He felt as degenerate as Potter had looked when the Snatchers had nabbed him.
Potter nodded shortly, but Draco had a feeling that his heart wasn’t in it. Getting back on Potter’s good side – if he even had been there before – would likely take some time and effort. Well, Draco had nothing better to do, anyway.
Blaise took a moment to think about it before answering, “If it’s the same person, maybe they didn’t have as much time for the second signature as they had for the first one? So, they’ve got their mind set on what Draco’s
Draco was forced to look up then. Why had no one bothered to mention that there was a conspiracy under way? (Maybe it was because he hated conspiracies with all his heart, having been part of one too many for his liking.)
“He has guests over all the time. Piece of cake,” Potter said. “He has a soiree once a month. All you have to do is look rich or famous or influential and you’re in.”
Potter shook his head gravely. “Because we’re operating on a need-to-know basis, that’s why.”
He didn’t know why he said it. He didn’t want Harry to suspect him, but not saying it would have felt like covering it up, and that certainly would have raised suspicion if Harry remembered later.
“I already told you, it’s dangerous!” Harry narrowed his eyes at him but squeezed his hand at the same time. The other hand he used to mess up his hair. Not that it was necessary after tumbling out of the fireplace and all over that nasty carpet.
“But I thought those waiters were all Squibs?” Draco said curiously.
“Merlin’s bloody–!” Draco covered his mouth and cut himself off before somebody could hear and come looking for him.
interested in men.”
“Glad to see you’re still as modest as ever,” Draco said as drily as he could. “Also, you gave me an earwig that I’m still suffering from to this day.”
Harry pretended not to notice the look Draco gave him, or else he might have answered Draco’s unasked question, which was
Now the Falcons were in position too and the referee entered the field with her broom in hand and two broom-boys trailing behind her, carrying the crate. She kicked it open and released the Snitch first. It shot straight up and was gone in an instant. She pointed her wand at the remaining balls and blew her whistle as they flew upwards.
Draco sighed and disentangled himself. He peeked through his curtains – nobody was there – and then summoned his Pensieve. When he turned back after a mere two seconds, Harry had somehow managed to curl around Draco’s pillow. Draco grabbed it and yanked it out of his grasp before he could ruin it completely.
He wasn't dead, he couldn't be dead, he couldn't die.
People were whispering. Why? Secrets, maybe. He wasn’t interested. Just tired.

Draco aimed his wand at Harry and cast. It felt like his

Draco laughed. Any child against the Cannons and their horrible, horrible robes was a child to his liking.
Draco breathed out heavily, which was as close to a laugh as he could muster right now. “Fat chance,” he muttered.

“We’ll see,” she said, but she was grinning.
Haynes pulled his shirt away from his chest with a squelch and said, “Don’t ask.”

“If that’s what it takes.”
Harry seemed to realise that he would not get out of it on his own, so he went in search of allies instead. “Easy! A little help, please?”
“Just tell me!” Draco rolled onto his side to watch as Harry put on Draco’s favourite blue sweater and then rolled the sleeves up a bit.
His first instinct was to look after Harry, but his room would be teeming with Aurors by now. Nash had probably already told them that she had let Draco in, and he couldn’t risk getting arrested while their attacker was still on the loose.
Draco groaned. “Is it bad that I kind of wish you had lost against the Arrows now?”
“You could come,” Harry said, straightening Draco’s scarf. “It’s Gryffindor against Slytherin and you’re already dressed appropriately.”
Draco cast a strong heating charm before he dropped down on the examination chair. Even charmed underwear could only do so much. Harry shivered violently and then relaxed, blinking up at him.
“I wasn't trying to
he was possibly still under the influence of Confunding Concoction.
Theo jerked his head toward the stairs, where Weasley was in a heated discussion with Granger, both of them undoubtedly headed in their direction. Through all the noise,
Potter and Draco yelped in unison. Potter because he had probably pricked himself on some thorns, and Draco because Potter gave him a mighty pinch in the process. Mrs. Capitelli took a startled step back.
Draco put his hand on Harry’s upper arm and leaned in to whisper in his ear. “Watch this.”
There was a sickening noise as Harry was thrown off his broom. People screamed, cameras flashed, and though Draco’s stomach turned violently, he managed to grip his wand tight and point it right at Harry, not even sure what he was casting, only knowing he had to do

“Are you trying to
Draco supposed that she was beautiful, although it took a whole lot of concentration to really look at her. She had a giant afro, for one, but then there were also her clothes – a sweeping, floor-length skirt the same yellow colour as Potter’s backpack, and a patterned, orange shirt, also: bracelets, earrings, and several necklaces.
rather serious.
“The Falcons are playing the Wanderers.”
Then there were the paintings – the one above the fireplace depicted abstract blue-and-green shapes and another next to the door showed a blue potions bottle. Draco wasn’t even sure if they were magical paintings, as not a single one showed a witch or wizard. The door itself was enormous – two-winged, arching and with glass-panels at the top.
Harry laughed yet again and then pulled him to his feet. “Just to be clear, I didn’t cook this because it’s Valentine’s Day. I just got bored waiting for you, is all. So, don’t get any ideas for future holidays!”

“Potter! Do you

“Halloween.”
“I'll give you that,” Draco said. “But that's hardly proof of anything.”
“That’s why we’re not compatible,” Luna said, as if a guy had to be willing to let her die in the name of science in order for her to consider him.
A big thanks to serilla and AlluraBelle for the comments! They definitely made me post this sooner. :)
He didn’t catch Potter’s reaction, because he was out of his chair and halfway to the bathroom in the same heartbeat.
, Draco. You see, I have heard that our dear Blaise has enlisted two star players to help with the development of his newest model.” Slughorn actually winked at Ginny at the last part.
Draco felt the urge to whip out his wand and spell them clean right away, but he couldn’t do that, of course. Harry grinned wickedly – because he knew exactly what Draco was thinking right then – and took the last slice of Draco’s pizza.
And of course
“They don’t even look like me.” Harry glared at him and poked his side. “I need Samantha to find out who writes them.”
The inside was bright and cosy, filled with cushions and chatter and dozens of people from all houses. (Though all the Slytherin students seemed to be first-years.)

“Eighty-one now.”
A very small, very red car stopped next to them and Ella Reyes, one of Harry’s Muggle friends, waved at them through the open window. Olivia Townsend, part of the lesbian couple, was driving.
Draco’s feet caught on the last step, and then he was on his hands and knees, and when those gave out, he somehow managed to avoid falling on his face, landing on his uninjured side instead.

“That bad, is it?”
Olivia rolled her eyes at her. “Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, searching for a way to spin this in his favour. “You thought I needed help and waited the whole night to find me?”
Draco got up and went into the bathroom.
“The others will be glad to know that

“Mostly religion, I think. My aunt and uncle had pretty … firm views on that kind of thing. Adam and Eve being the very first dream couple and everything. And everybody knows that what comes first is always best and nothing ever gets improved over time. Not
“What is it?” Draco looked around to see what had thrown Harry for a loop.
There were bruises, but they were not the worst of it – on the side of his stomach, there was a new, round scar, several tones lighter than the surrounding skin. It seemed to stem from a puncture wound.
“Why would he?” Harry asked, crossing the kitchen to relieve the owl of its letter.
Had the gas stove exploded? Harry had promised the chances of that happening were non-existing!
“And then she tried to take him home, which was apparently when you entered the scene. Harry says he didn’t even know you were there.”
at ear-splitting volume.
Only four months apart and he had already forgotten not to startle Harry in his sleep. He could count himself lucky that Harry’s accident had depleted his magical reserve and left him quite empty, or else Draco might’ve been blasted off his feet.
Draco gave him a tired smile and gathered his things while Harry buttoned up his shirt and then took out his Cloak and vanished.

acceptable enough for his parents. Well, at least with their current social standing.

“See,” said Potter, “You get it.”

He tried not to think about the fact that, more often than not, he ended up sleeping on the couch, fully clothed, because he just couldn’t motivate himself enough to get up when the time came.
“Ladies and gentlewizards, give it up for the Falmouth Falcons! Here are Haynes, Robinson, Mason, Armstrong, Montgomery, Mills and the man of the hour, Haaaaarry Pooootter!”

Harry turned to have another laugh with Draco, who gave him a very confused look. Harry grinned and leaned in to whisper into his ear.
“Well, that’s rude. I’m pretty sure you’re supposed to be on my side.” Since he was preoccupied with cooling his fingers on the metal of the biscuit tin, Draco barely noticed Harry’s sulky expression.
“I just did the calendar shoot two months ago. They can’t
Draco leaned back against his wall, crossed his arms and settled on watching the rest of the teams. Some of the Falcons were still giving interviews. Most of the Catapults were giving autographs (even though they hadn’t even done anything at all except for getting exceptionally lucky).
He had an excuse though – he hadn’t gotten any sleep in between his night shift and Olivia’s early eight o’clock yoga class. Draco thought he should be given credit for that.
“That
The Great Hall was already packed with students, and Draco’s eyes immediately found the Gryffindor table, which was almost completely full as well, but not in any particular uproar. Hope blossomed inside him as Draco searched the rows of students, following Theo towards their own table almost blindly.
There was a knock on the door and then it opened, revealing Curses and Tabitha Woods, who was clutching a stack of books.
“Same leg as yesterday?”
“You know the rules.” Abrams grabbed his arm and turned him towards the door.
Draco was pretty sure one of them said, “I wouldn’t mind watching that,” and he straightened immediately, more than a little bewildered.
She waited a few seconds and then clapped her hands, making Harry jump slightly. “Alright then. Forty-five minutes to reflect on everything we’ve heard and then we’ll have the vote. There will be three options to vote on: 1) All Slytherins allowed, 2) Only partners allowed or 3) No Slytherins allowed. See you all back here at 4 o'clock sharp.”
“What about Potter?” he asked, trying for a more casual tone. His hands were shaking so much they were rattling the empty glass, so he let go of it.
that we did not fight each other.” Pomfrey still looked sceptical, so he added, “We’re totally getting along.”
They both nodded along, even though Hermione surely knew how Muggles moved. Draco guessed that Harry was just trying to cover how nervous he was.

“Even if I were a witch, I doubt Potter could manage to corrupt me.” Draco raised an eyebrow in emphasis. “I do have

“Why would it?” said Harry, glaring at Felicity.
. Suddenly he didn't feel cold at all anymore and when the guy began nipping at his bottom lip, Draco grew bold as well and slid a hand under his t-shirt.
“I got it,” Lauren said. She glanced at the door and then pulled out her mobile phone, punched in some numbers and held it to her face. “Buonasera!”
Draco got to his knees and then flopped forward onto his hands so he was close enough to reach Potter. Just then, Potter flipped onto his back. Luckily, he wasn’t seizing. He was shaking with quiet laughter.

He felt the impostor stand up. Then there were footsteps on the stairs. He seemed to be done with Draco, perfectly content to leave him right here.

“No, please,” Cuffe stammered. “If I hadn’t published it, somebody else would have!”
“I went to find some food. Potter wanted to join me, but I thought he looked unwell, so I told him to stay. I sent a waitress over with something to eat, to get him to sober up.”
“Don’t worry, Tedward. These are Odysseus’ hunting grounds.” He pointed at the dark stadium. “If the floodlights are out, that means it’s empty. I don’t think my Coach is here.”
“Then I’ll just undamage it. That’s what magic is for, right?”
“Adrenaline junkie,” Draco replied harshly, but he couldn’t really blame him.

“You read the book? You know there’s a movie, right?” Harry snorted. “

Their friends spent several agonising moments cooing over the photograph, but in the end, they had to move on if they wanted to look at them all, because there were a fuck-ton others after that one.
“That was cursed alright,” Draco groaned, getting back up onto his stool. He took Harry’s hand into his own. Just like the necklace at Draco’s chest, it felt unnaturally hot. It was also still bleeding, but that wasn’t surprising after he’d cut it open. “Fuck. That wasn’t supposed to happen.”
“Yeah,” he agreed happily. “Which is why we throw ping-pong balls and

“He made you Healer for his team.”
“Together, come on,” Draco said and he took Potter's wrist in his hand and pointed his own wand at Potter's broken body. “
“They’re prime suspects for the murder of Harry Potter.”
A moment later, they were standing behind the dumpster of Linh’s and Harry took off the Cloak. Wind chimes sounded when they stepped inside and Shen Jian, the middle-aged lady who owned the place, called out to them excitedly.
“My recipes
attacked me, Draco! At practice!”
Draco lingered for a second, unsure how to handle the scene, and then inclined his head slightly and followed Harry hurriedly.
It was immediately apparent that the reporters had surprised her. The photograph started with a view of her back, clad in standard Ministry robes, and then rounded her until the camera must have been right in her face, at which point she seemed to shout something and stretched out both hands to shield her face.
He didn’t have any time to lose – Muggles were highly unequipped to deal with life-threatening injuries. Who

mouthed Harry, eyebrows high. “So do you! And you are four years older than me!”
“Draco, dear,” she said, shaking her head gravely. “I know it when I see one of us. He did cook for you, didn’t he?”
“I asked her to take me to yoga with her. I even ditched a match to meet up with her. She wouldn’t have been there if
Potter crossed his arms and pretended to be hurt. “Would you stop slandering me?”
Then he said something in Parsel, sounding nothing like himself, and Draco knew what had woken him up. He would cast a calming charm, and then wake Harry gently.
Pansy didn't even look up. She was deeply focused on painting her nails with dark green polish. “Don't know. But I know where he can stick it.”
estimated it would take me until the middle of November to fully recover.”
that was obvious. Is he even single? Or interested in men?”
. Mrs. Weasley had cooked everything he liked and even made him a new sweater. Draco elected to forget about the homophobic lady they’d met at the video store and especially about
“God, remind me to take out my contacts before bed next time,” he muttered, head bowed and rubbing at his eyes with both palms. “I think they’re fused – oh.”
Blaise patted his arm. “Hermione knew what was up instantly, of course. So, we got him a Healer and they sorted him out in no time. And then he freaked out
“And then they invited me to join their pub crawl and I introduced them to Lauren,” Harry said.
“Right.” Harry untangled himself from Draco and shook his head a little. “Knew I was forgetting something.” He tipped his head back and took a few deep breaths. “Let’s definitely get a move on, though.”
“We agree that you guys only do this party so you can wear scandalously short togas, right?”
“How did they find out?” Harry said more to himself.
“I never liked Dayal anyway,” she said coincidentally. “He always acted like he was better than us. Only started talking to me when I got chosen for the Arrows.”
Potter finally let go of Draco’s arm when Polkiss reached them, his troop right behind him.
“Great going, Potter,” Draco snorted. “Maybe you should become a Healer.”
“Want me to distract you?”
Harry pondered this for a few seconds and then settled on shrugging. “I’ve had worse dates.”
Harry pulled some clothes out of the pile on the floor, clearly at random, and threw them at Draco’s naked chest. The sweater actually hit him, but the jeans flew right over him and landed on the other side of the bed.
“Are you sure you won’t Apparate us into a wall again?”
“They’re sober by now,” Draco added incidentally.
, how exactly are you going to protect me from potential dangers without magic?”
“Why did you have to smash my Pensieve?” Harry said, faking sadness (poorly).
And he replied (while trying to tie his shoelaces and failing miserably – Merlin, he was tired!), “That sounds nice. Have fun!”
“Your aim is abysmal!”
“Just say it already,” said Harry with a deep sigh, waving his hands through the air in an unenthusiastic come-at-me gesture. “Let’s get this over with.”
“Who’s that from?” Harry asked, having watched him read the letter with great interest.
“It’s a construction Muggles use to do things for them. They are metal and can perform tasks,” Potter tried to explain. He must have noticed the confusion on Draco’s face, because he seemed to think for a few seconds. “Imagine if you could use the
He turned his head to look at Harry, who seemed to be petrified. Olivia squeezed Draco’s shoulder lightly, maybe because she’d felt him tense up.
Draco stilled and looked up at him from where he was kneeling. “Come … to your flat?”
The good thing about running was that there was no chance to talk – well, in theory.
The second Draco relaxed visibly. The real one watched him closely, not daring to rummage around for his wand.
They were silent for a minute, Potter savouring his cake and Draco trying his hardest to eat slowly instead of imitating Potter’s usual style and just devouring everything at once. He had not eaten since lunch, more than ten hours ago, and he was starving. He thought about the cornflakes he would undoubtedly have eaten and about the zero presents he had anticipated.
And who could complain about that?
Draco had trouble concentrating on her eyes. His own were darting this way and that, and it felt like they were everywhere at once. His whole body seemed to be trembling.
Harry looked like there was a bad taste in his mouth. He gave him a scathing look and snatched the robes out of his hand. “I hate you.”
“My eyes are up here, you know.”
Had Draco not been so tense, he even might have gloated a bit. Ever since Harry had introduced him to his Muggle friends, Draco had felt completely clueless most of the time.
Draco took a step back, letting go of the chair. Then he said, almost incidentally, “Harry’s waiting for us there. I couldn’t take him
Draco snatched Harry’s wand the moment he lifted it. “Don’t you dare!”
Draco stopped dead in his tracks and instantly wished he had just Apparated from inside. Screw the neighbours. He’d rather they get suspicious about him never actually leaving for work than endure this.
But still he couldn’t rest now. He had to help Harry.
Harry never took off
Harry snatched the Quaffle out of the air and narrowly prevented a crash with Charlie. He dodged the opposing players expertly, and then completely botched his throw. Draco was pretty sure that Harry was aiming at the middle hoop – at last that was where he was looking. The Quaffle veered completely off course and hit the outer rim of the right hoop with a resounding bang that left it shaking.
He found Harry in front of his stove, stroking Aurelius with one hand. He was wearing a pair of Draco’s pyjama bottoms and the blue t-shirt that had led to this whole mess.
you.”
“Right?” Draco had never felt so much and so little like laughing at the same time. As if his parents knew anything about that. “What
The hand holding Draco’s wrist twitched and when Potter sighed, it sounded tired. “Could we please stop pretending for one second?”
, you know him too,” Olivia commented. “Right. So, I had just broken up with Zach that November and was doing our annual Christmas pub crawl with Ella, Callum and three other friends. They moved a few months after that.”
sounds bloody ominous.”
So, it's Tuesday. You know what that means!
Somehow, the Gryffindor common room managed to be just as noisy as the Hufflepuffs’, only that there were way fewer people inside. Draco couldn’t say he was surprised. What he was, though, was impressed by their talent to somehow clutter up every single available surface.
Harry’s eyes flickered up to Draco’s and then back to Maybe-Adonis. Then he scribbled,
Fortunately for him, she had only been made Chief two years ago (and promptly banished the lime green robes in favour of multi-coloured scrubs that indicated your ward – the only thing Draco had to give her credit for).
. Or maybe he knows you wouldn’t be able to handle Odysseus.”

that Potter wouldn’t be able to stand. That was
Well, at least Draco didn’t have to settle for boxed spaghetti today – he wasn’t really hungry anymore.
Potter gasped and shot up.
A horrible squeak jolted Draco from sleep and then his pillow was ripped away from underneath him, acquainting his head with the mattress. Harry was sitting beside him, covering his naked chest with the pillow.
Potter turned to glare at them and they blushed deeply and shut up instantly. In the back row, Hermione was practically vibrating in her seat while the girl next to her stared out the window intently. The bus stopped not a minute later.
“I love that song! Come on, let’s dance!”
“Yeah,” Harry said slowly. “You really didn’t have to wait up for me. You could’ve gone back to sleep. Now I feel bad about waking you up.”
“This one?” Draco asked, holding up what he hoped was a different box. Anything to change the topic.
to provoke him?”
“You know, the adventure holiday industry. Ride a dragon, overthrow a corrupt government, get a tan.”
after all. But
that you had the memory.”
you going to do now?”
“As usual.”
Draco lunched for his hand, but it was already too late – Abercrombie had grabbed the footrest and removed it from his upper arm in one swift motion. Blood started to gush out at once and Draco pressed the bandage, still rolled up, to the entry wound.
“I don’t like this. Why would she change her mind so quickly? She’s only been gone a few weeks.”
remain just that. That was just how it was. No matter what Potter called him in a moment of desperation.
“Why do they do that to me?”
“That doesn’t count,” Draco protested. “I was severely drunk. Refilling glasses should be banned. They’re a serious safety hazard.”
keep you here for the night, but let’s face it – you’d just bail as soon as I turn my back.
Harry pressed the empty vial back into Draco’s hand and lightly banged his head against the wall. “What for? That was abysmal.”
“More and more often, these days.” He sounded like it, too.
“... opportunity. I’ll do it!” one of them whispered resolutely and Draco didn’t like the sound of
. He just wrote to see what they said at Mungo’s and to tell me we’re taking two days off to recharge.”
Draco’s face felt weirdly numb. “When did I ever tell you no in the first place?”
“I will not want to take it back.”
They went down the corridor together, but the other two stopped short a few feet from the door.
It only took about two minutes of Harry turning pages while muttering under his breath for the remaining occupants of their table to clear out, including the smelly kleptomaniac primate. As Draco took his first lungful of fresh air, he felt weirdly inclined to just lunge across the table and kiss Harry. Quite possibly, King Kong’s toxic odour had just addled his brain.
Like Draco could argue with that without telling them that Harry had probably never played football in his life. Or maybe he

and Draco’s heart felt full to bursting even as his lungs struggled to function under the pressure. Getting his arse kicked had never felt so good.
Nearly three hours had passed when Pembroke finally packed up his notebook, which was completely filled by then.
“Shield!” Draco yelled desperately.
. Besides, at least I
“Mr. Potter, I’ll have to call sec-” the mediwitch started, but then Harry had pushed his way past her, dropping to his knees in front of Draco. She shut up as Harry took Draco’s face in both hands.
“Well, apparently it does,” Draco said, grinning. Harry looked extremely puzzled.
Potter stuck his head out of the kitchen. “Sam, what are you shouting for? Come on in.”
“And do you also know what it
And yet, there they were. A whole box of them, from the looks of it. There was no way to be sure, because Potter had scattered them all over Draco’s library desk, for inconvenience’s sake.
Harry traced a circle on Draco’s biceps. “You’re not touching me.”
“Never mind,” Draco said. “Here they are already.”
Too bad. Draco wasn’t going to turn down an offer like that.
Theo, who had been watching students on the other end of the lake skip stones, piped up, “How did
Potter was crossing his arms now and leaning back in his chair. “Well, I don’t want to. Keeping it warm screws up the texture.”
A tiny cloud of mist trickled out, barely visible in the bright sunlight and Draco was overcome with desperation. He was actually getting
“Potter,” Draco pressed out after a good ten seconds with no air left in his lungs. “Are you –” another fit of laughter before Draco could continue. “–
“Thanks,” Draco breathed out before he could stop himself.
He beamed up at Harry and then, finally, held the robes out to Felicity, who gave him an open smile and signed her name in big, loopy letters, right across where Harry’s name was stitched to the back.
Harry ignored that part and leaned back to examine his temple. Apparently satisfied with his work, he closed the jar and put it on the coffee table. “You
So, this is definitely going to be a daily-update-thing, let's not kid ourselves here.

“I’m talking long-term.”
, right?” Harry laughed and ruffled his hair. “Want me to take it back?” He held out a hand that Draco slapped away.
“Your trials are next week, right? That means there’s still time for you to practice. I can handle the library for three nights.”
” she groaned loudly. “What is the point of them?”
Draco just hoped that none of the Falcons’ players were involved. He knew that Harry would take it especially hard, because he trusted all of the starters unconditionally.
“Deal,” said Harry, still grinning. “Any suggestions?”
Harry breathed out heavily and looked up at him after all. There was defiance in his eyes. “
“Yeah,” said Armstrong lightly. “But I have the decency not to collar one of the really good ones. I know my place.”
“Really? I make a fool of myself here and you’re just gonna focus on the robes?”
There was disbelief in her voice as she said, “Don’t tell me you haven’t seen the Prophet, Draco.”
“Tell me who sent the owl. I can’t wait until tomorrow!”
it, right?”
Draco nodded, not really sure what had just happened. He was no expert on dating, but he had a feeling that there was supposed to be a certain amount of sex at the end of it. And it didn’t really look like that was where they were headed right now.
, of course.
One, two, three seconds ticked by before Draco finally understood the meaning, and when he did, he could only scoff.
“That was also against Puddlemere.” Robinson crossed her arms. “And we won that one.”

Everything was black and quiet. In the distance, so far, far away, the wind was howling, rain was drumming on the ground.

All three of them were nodding profusely.
“Potter will be back on Thursday,” Draco said resolutely. “Don’t you have something better to do on Valentine’s Day?”
“Alright, we’ll do a few preliminary exercises first. There’s no point bringing in the boggart before you’ve managed the basics.”
Hurry, hurry, hurry! No time, Merlin, what was he doing?! Fuck!
“She didn’t say it outright, of course, but it almost sounded like she knows.”
“It’s in June.”
“Please sit down, Mr. McAllister,” Draco said pleasantly, making a point to ignore the drawn wand. “Let’s talk about how the Prophet is ruining Quidditch.”
Just yesterday, a young Trainee Healer had asked him to please sign her copy of the newest
“Irrelevant!”
Blaise shook his head. “After they let Potter in as a first-year? They won’t. Besides, it’s not like they have a real chance of making the team, right? Look at the competition.”
“What, wanting to hex me?”
,” Potter whispered. “We have to turn left soon.”
Draco didn’t find out what they were wondering, because then he was telling Madam Pomfrey what he’d already done to fix Greyson and for the next ten minutes they were busy examining Greyson a second time and discussing some of the newer treatment techniques (which didn’t necessarily have anything to do with Greyson, who was sleeping tightly).
“What’s your fucking problem, Malfoy?!”
Tessa’s reply was almost instantaneous but very unhelpful.
Potter looked at him flabbergasted and ruffled his hair. “I completely forgot about that!”
It was pointless, but Draco couldn’t help himself. He stretched out a hand – Potter didn’t even flinch – and pushed the hood off his head. And there it was: Humankind’s most preposterous mob of hair, only that it had gotten even worse since Draco had seen it last at the second Hogwarts’ Anniversary three years ago. It was fairly short at the sides, but there was a whole lot of curly action happening on top. The scar was only visible where it crossed his right eyebrow, almost white against his tan skin.
Draco smirked at him. “Do you really want to go there,
Potter gritted his teeth.
– and the Falcons flew in as their names were announced.
Potter grinned sweetly, which had to mean that the following reply would be anything but. “Well, it would be of immense healing value if I could watch you lose pathetically.”
departure. Try as he might, Draco couldn’t find a satisfactory explanation for that. Potter sure as hell did not care enough about volunteering to justify this behaviour. Maybe he’d done it so they wouldn’t get in trouble. Maybe Potter had simply written his Charms essay. Maybe –
He tried to wrench his arm away, but Potter was holding on tight, still pinching him. Using his left arm, Draco pushed him away by the forehead and Potter fell back onto the bed.
“As if that would have worked. People would’ve taken one look at me and realised something was up.”
ago!”
Lauren’s room was a little less calming than Olivia’s. There were no plants, for one. The colour scheme was a whole lot different, for another. Where Olivia’s gym was painted in a soothing mint green, Lauren’s was mostly dark red and black, which created a decidedly aggressive atmosphere. Then there were the banners – the black silhouette of a wolf against a red background.
the first part of sixth was worse. You broke my nose.
“You hate it, you say so at least three times a week.”
“So?” Draco pressed out, grabbing his box tighter. The sooner they left this place, the better. Half an hour was way too much time spent on buying one single pot.
Draco placed a shaking hand on Harry’s shoulder, but he didn’t even seem to notice it. “I’ll take you to St. Mungo’s.”
how much I
Draco barely managed to grab a sofa’s backrest and keep himself upright. Harry wouldn’t have a single piece of furniture that wasn’t covered in Draco’s blood if it kept going on like that.
His fun ended only three seconds later, when Pomfrey touched his ankle and Potter gritted his teeth so hard Draco could hear it three beds over. Draco had no sympathy – there was actual fire creeping through his bones. Potter had no reason to make such a fuss.
like me. Maybe you should’ve actually let me finish my sentence before jumping in to defend your precious reputation.”
. That’s just … no. She’d be making her own job much harder than it has to be.”
“But she does not have any reason whatsoever!” Harry was still beside him, sounding scandalised. “Just tell her what happened and she’ll have to let you off the hook!”
Draco looked after him until he was out of sight, very confused. Potter had invited
Pembroke made no move to stand up. The grip on his briefcase tightened and he licked his lips nervously before answering in a slightly quivering voice, “How do I know you’re really Draco Malfoy?”
“Unfair,” Harry muttered into the kiss, tugging at his collar.
Draco would not watch Potter get his face smashed. There simply was no reason for him as a Slytherin to watch the Gryffindor trials. That would be highly suspicious. Besides, he didn’t even know when they started. It wasn’t like the schedule was posted on the school-wide notice-board. (It wasn’t. He’d checked.)
The rest of the package tumbled off the bed in a heap, but neither one of them was willing to take their hands off the sweater to retrieve it.
Draco grimaced and said under his breath, “That’s sprained.”
“About … Well, somebody signed us up for this, right? I’d just really like to know who and why.”
that to her is responsible. Not you.”
Sex wasn’t what he’d been planning on when he’d suggested going to his place. He’d only been thinking about making out in private, but now it felt like he’d offered himself up for
Draco just kept looking at him, which definitely didn’t help calming him down. “She thinks you are hiding your wand somewhere.”
“Obviously.” Draco said it lightly, trying to convey that it wasn’t that much of a deal as Harry seemed to think it was.
Draco laughed. “Sad to hear there is nothing anybody could do about your hair. But I definitely agree with you, that mob is an abnormality beyond compare.”
“It's not a network if it only consists of one person,” Blaise said, leading him upstairs.
“Don’t worry, Kassandra knows how to behave herself.”
“I should have immobilised it right away.”
She nodded at the house elf, who handed Draco her patient chart and then bowed out of the room, closing the door on her way out.
Had Draco had a choice, he wouldn’t have tried it anywhere near Harry’s heart either, but he didn’t say that.
“So, you broke your arm days ago and
The sudden banging and subsequent barking startled him so much that he jerked upwards and nearly fell out of bed. Harry grabbed his arm and pulled him back just in time. He was already holding his wand, like he hadn’t just been startled awake as well.
"I'm not doing anything," he said, voice cracking and barely audible. "
Tessa scoffed, and it sounded bitter. “
Potter’s grin widened at Draco’s confused look, and then he actually winked at him – Draco’s heart missed several beats – and got to his feet without waiting for an answer.
When Draco finally stepped out onto the street, the night didn’t seem as mild anymore. He wasn’t really sure which way they had come from, but of course that didn’t really matter. He just needed to find a dark alley. Now he wondered why he hadn’t just Apparated from inside the building. He doubted that the Muggles could watch him from the gym. Besides, they’d seemed quite busy when he’d left.
on hooking up with you?”
Draco glared at her, but instead of cowering she held his gaze and took a bite of her pizza demonstratively. Well, he couldn’t argue with that.
I’m completely fine!” Potter protested, wrenching his arm out of Draco’s grasp.
He felt close to tears. Sleep deprivation really did make people rather emotional. Better find a safe topic to take his mind off how
She pointed at him in accusation. “I know he’s there. It’s a million degrees in here.”
A group of small children, all of them costumed and laughing, rounded the corner and shot past him, some of them looking back at him curiously. None of them so much as glanced at the ruin.
Draco was suddenly aware that they were lying in Harry’s unmade bed, the sheets clearly rumbled underneath them. And damn if Draco didn’t want him so badly that it hurt. He couldn’t help it – one hand found its place between Harry’s back and Draco’s backpack, and then he was leaning down.
far and Draco wasn’t sure if they really should Apparate Aurelius thrice in one day. He didn’t seem to like it that much.
She smirked. “Well, if Potter tries to teach him, it certainly can’t hurt to have a Healer at hand.”
what you told him?”
Marc laughed a little unnaturally while Tessa stabbed a fork at her cherry crumble.
“I don’t know. Potter just sort of grows on you, I guess.” Draco elbowed Potter in the ribs. It wasn’t his fault if he did it a little too hard – it wasn’t easy coordinating something like that with his elbow pressed against his body. “Like a tumour.”
“They might!” Harry exploded, grabbing him by the shoulders and slamming his back against the door so hard it rattled in its frame.

Weasley and Granger exchanged a look that spoke volumes.
Bagman said, “Oh my, it seems that we are in for a treat now! Ladies and gentleman, may I present to you the cheerleaders of Britain’s biggest Harry Potter fan club!”
“I’ll be there,” Draco said eagerly.
Muggles were huddled around the table and all Draco could see at first was a single arm, completely scratched up but far too pale to belong to Harry.
Samantha wasn’t amused. “Oh, so
Then she summoned a backpack from somewhere beside the paddock and pulled a whole dead ferret out of it. She tossed it to Nivaria (who snatched it out of the air and cut it clean in half in the process) and then distributed dead mice to the rest of the herd.
“It’s like a finger print for witches and wizards,” Granger elaborated. “Useless without a database to refer to.”
Harry was pacing the room, eyes darting from his battered old watch to the patch of naked chest visible under Draco’s unbuttoned shirt. He’d just rolled out of bed, but that wasn’t the reason his hair looked messier than ever.
the houses on what a sign proclaimed to be Magnolia Road.
The last half of her sentence got lost as Blaise locked eyes with Draco, who pressed his lips together tightly.
Potter gave him a tired smile. Draco dropped the card like hot cauldron cake.
Potter’s shoulders rose and sank with a heavy breath, and only when he was done with that, did he look up from his book with a long-suffering expression. “You know, I’ve actually tried to forget how insufferable you’ve been the last seven years. But now you’re just a different kind of annoying. It’s almost worse, somehow.”
Draco didn’t care for the pity in his voice. He squared his shoulders. “Maybe I won’t.”
, remember?”
Harry, who had only agreed to the wheelchair after a whole thirty minutes of arguing and on condition of wearing a glamour that concealed his injuries, tilted his head back so he could look at Draco.
Draco opened his eyes in an attempt at clearing his head at least enough to be able to formulate a response. It wasn’t really helpful, since he was then able to see Harry again, and that was a distraction in and off itself. But he managed. Somehow.
Draco massaged his forehead with a groan. “Why am I even surprised that she told you?”
“They’re not going to
. Harry cleared his throat and squeezed his shoulder.
“Not that I remember,” Harry said with a grin. “But I
But Harry just shook his head with another grin and leaned down to pick up Draco’s backpack. He had it shouldered before Draco could begin to process what had just happened, and then he had no choice but to get up and follow his homework out of the library.
“You deserved that,” he said assertively. “You should
“Your concoctions could paralyse an Erumpent! You could’ve just brought me the same drink you
to the list, because
“Why didn’t you lead with that?” Blaise was on his feet and squeezing through the gap between their chairs without waiting for a reply. “You should’ve woken me last night! Now he’s had plenty of time to fabricate an excuse!”
“Oh, they were sure that I
–?” began Draco, unsure if he should continue the sentence. Was he even allowed to ask?
“How do you know that?”
Green eyes narrowed dangerously, and Draco recognised it for what it was – anger stemming from being accused of lying when one was actually telling the truth. How could Harry not be worried about this?
Potter snatched the abandoned box from the table and nearly walked into Draco, who’d made a single step towards the back of the library and stopped in confusion when Potter hadn’t insulted him.
,” he finally said, but it sounded flat – like he couldn’t decide whether he was elated about their loot or horrified by the existence of it.
Some things just had to be earned, even if he hadn’t thought so back then.
“But that’s exactly why we
“I don’t think anyone does,” Potter said, putting his pristine Quidditch uniform back into the box. “When and where?”
“Yes,” said Draco slowly, and then his face was breaking into a smile all of its own. “That wasn’t a disaster at all, was it?”
“They are not
“Huh? Oh.” Draco shot a look over his shoulder that was much too quick to provide him with any visual information whatsoever. “I think he could snap his broom and perform an elaborate Snitch-burning-ritual and they’d still put him on the team.”
“It’s not my fault people are wrong about me most of the time and unreasonable for the rest of it.”
to keep silent. He’d just been too startled to come up with anything clever. Also, now that Potter had declared his intent to stay until Draco yielded, he physically couldn’t break his silence.
If you can spare them, I will take any of your thoughts, suggestions, emojis. :)
“Potter, are you
development. If we could maybe keep this between us for now?”
“That’s really nice,” Draco said in a husky voice. He cleared his throat and then concentrated very hard on his plate. “She didn’t have to make this for me.”
When Harry landed near the Healers’ benches, his lips were blue and he was shivering violently. He didn’t stop to let Draco heal him but marched right past them, jerking his head in Draco’s direction.
he had gone a bit overboard with the alcohol after that.
As if Potter was sharing his thoughts, his hands went underneath Draco’s shirt, stroking his back. His hands were like ice on Draco’s skin and he inhaled sharply, biting Potter’s lower lip in the process, which made Potter groan and then there was his tongue against Draco’s and –
“Fascinating!” McAllister exclaimed, taking the pen.
Draco had to consciously close his mouth, as it wouldn’t do that on its own anymore. “You mean it’s
“I don’t
He started to run, down the only path that wasn’t yet aflame. The fire roared behind him, leaping after him in the form of dragons and lions and gigantic serpents, devouring everything in their path. He was going to die here and there was nothing he could do – he didn’t even have his mother’s wand anymore. Mother – he would never see her again and she wouldn’t know. How could she know what had happened to him?
“Game was cancelled ...,” said Florence Mills, clearly uncomfortable. “Referee got hit with a curse.”
Harry held the blanket open for him and Draco fell into bed face first. The blanket was draped around him and then he was dragged into blissfully warm arms.
“Absolutely not.” Draco took up his fork and stabbed several pieces of sausage as well as a whole fried egg. “Pansy, I can’t fight Potter. Word would get around. Nobody would even
“They do hate me,” Draco said, even though that wasn’t the reason, of course. “They hate seeing us together.”
Harry laughed. “That’s just poor planning on her part.”

Draco took one of the scarves and slung it around Harry’s neck, pulling him in closer. “I like to think otherwise.”

Harry glanced at all the shelves they hadn’t checked out yet, and then sighed. It was apparent that his enthusiasm had vanished completely. Draco followed him to the counter and watched as he handed the clerk some money for the stack of movies he was holding. They’d been planning to shortlist them, but that had apparently just been cancelled.
not once, but twice.
Harry laughed slightly. “I don’t really trust your judgement.”
“Did you abduct me to lecture me about math?”
Harry fixed Draco with a grim look that clearly said it was time to shrink some heads again. “Shall we?”
He wasn’t hard to find. Draco just had to follow the noise. Harry was slamming doors and apparently throwing things. Draco opened the door just in time to see him stuff his gloves inside his bag with so much force that it looked like he wanted to squeeze his whole arm in there too. Then he practically ripped of his ring and threw it across the room. There was a slight cracking noise when he wrenched his sweater from its hook. Draco was pretty sure that he saw a spark, too.

like one right now,” Draco said, summoning Harry’s chart from the table and pointing out the passage to Harry. “It’s prescribed right here.
There were six Aurors on his doorstep, and all of them were under Disillusionment Charms and dressed for combat.
The following welcome wasn’t exactly what Draco would have called warm. It was clear whom the majority of the spectators were here to see. The players filed into the arena, circling the pitch one time and then forming a circle, the Tornados on one side and the Falcons on the other. Both Seekers were hovering a few feet above their Keepers, Potter in his robes of grey and white and opposite him Timothy McCarthy (brother to Felicity McCarthy), whose robes were already soaked so much they seemed midnight blue rather than sky-blue. McCarthy was staring daggers at Potter, who was smirking back at him provocatively.
“I’ll probably regret this,” Draco sighed, as Potter fell back against the windowsill.
“Ah, well,” Harry said, shaking his head while rummaging through his bag until he found a pair of jeans. “He’s got three kids. Guess I’ll have to make do with you.”
“We won’t make it back before ten. I can’t afford to get caught breaking curfew.”
“Wait a second,” said Draco instead, giving Potter a quizzical look. “Did I understand that right? You broke into someone’s house wearing a bright red hoody?”
In fact, Harry didn’t even
The wall slid closed before Draco could do so much as blink, and Blaise stood in front of it, wand raised. Draco sat up slowly, trying to seem as uninterested as possible, which was nearly ruined when two strong, invisible hands were placed on his shoulders.
Harry didn’t say anything for a few seconds and Draco returned his attention to his cart-driving princess. He nearly drove straight off a rainbow when Harry suddenly slung an arm around his shoulders and pulled him against his side.

or obscure references the others understood and he didn’t. Plus, there was even a blood curse. Draco had been obsessed with those at age six or seven.
Draco should’ve anticipated Harry’s reaction – his wand was in his hand in a heartbeat and his jinx was flying at Draco before he could do so much as blink. He didn’t have time to produce a shield, but it didn’t matter.
The Muggle at the head end stepped away to grab something, but Draco couldn’t see the patient’s face because they had strapped a mask to his mouth and nose. His forehead was smeared with blood and his hair was completely covered with a cap.

“Yeah. I’d like to get that out of my head too. Permanently.”
better than it was two weeks ago.”
The wall closed again, rousing them from their stupor.
The girls went inside to pick up their pizzas ten minutes later. Lauren was pushing her way through the crowd resolutely, pulling Olivia with her, who kept apologising to every single person they passed. Either Olivia’s innocent face or Lauren’s muscular physique were working – nobody protested, though several people looked displeased to say the least.
several lines! You’re not even going to clean it up?”
What the fuck was so special about Potter that Draco’s subconscious had to make this all about him?
And there it was. That sounded like
” Draco repeated. He had a bad feeling about this. “Didn’t you get that checked out?”
Draco decided that that was enough eye contact for the moment – Potter really did look rather repulsive – and brushed the dirt off his trousers instead. “Yes, well, you’re kind of my only way back to school, so ...”
Draco began stroking Harry’s back in soothing circles and felt him tremble underneath his hands, taking heaving breaths. He tried to let go to see if Harry was actually crying, but Harry just held him in a vice. Draco patted his back helplessly. Why was he so useless at this?
When they came back, the others were huddled around a book that was placed in the middle of the table. Harry sped up and squeezed back onto the bench to have a look over Lauren’s shoulder, leaving Draco with the task of distributing the shots.
“What are you doing? We’re going in different directions.”
Draco didn’t get a chance to answer, because the next second Harry took off his ring and the pent-up force left his body all at once.
Draco Malfoy was an idiot.
Harry’s boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend. And as a Healer, the priority was to ensure the patient’s survival.
Harry snorted very loudly and probably involuntarily. He finally turned to look at her, which meant Draco could only see the back of his head.
“Ah, so
“You have such beautiful hair, my dear. Would you mind if I took just a strand of it? Just to show to my hair dresser, you see? For colour reference.” – A very creepy middle-aged witch. And yes, Draco did mind.
Harry glanced at the window. Odysseus was still keeping up with them and also still glaring at him.
Harry glared at him and pulled his brand-new cape (teal blue with the light grey ‘Zabroomi’ brand logo stitched right across) straight.
abysmal.”
,” Potter said, grabbing Samantha by the shoulders and steering her towards the door. “I’m sure you’ll meet again and I wouldn’t want you to use up your insults all at once. See you next week.”
“You would,” Draco sighed, taking another step towards the desk. His heart was hammering madly in his chest. He was anxious to get out of there. “It’s sigma, iota, zeta, omega.”
And then it came – the inevitably catchy chorus:
her,” Potter said, emptying his tea and then prodding the falcon on his mug repeatedly.
“Fine, you can help me make the potatoes peel themselves.”
Worst of all was that Draco found he
“Yeah,” said Potter. Draco wasn’t sure if he believed it. He was
He didn’t want to leave, but he had no justified reason to stay. He wasn’t family and there was an arrest warrant with his name on it.
“Oh, yes.” He looked back at her. “Um. So, I was saying … yes. So fundamentally speaking … I believed I was in the right and I was clearly misguided and plain wrong and I never wanted to take it as far as I did. I am sorry. And you’re not obligated to forgive me for what I did –” Draco had to look away from the cold glare he received – “um … but I
“I never … I … somebody –“ He was stammering now, as if he couldn’t find the right words to explain why that was such a big deal.
Teddy’s hand was suspiciously sticky. His mouth was already stuffed again – which only completed his portrayal of Harry – but he nodded enthusiastically, and his hair changed to blonde.
“Oh, you were both absolutely pissed,” Lauren laughed. “Harry, you forgot you live alone. You just repeated that you couldn’t ‘appear home’ that drunk. As if there was somebody home who would tell you off, or something.”
Potter shook his head, still staring out the window. “You didn’t hear her that night. It was ... bad.”
“Yeah, I know.”
“And you’re using it to tape me to the bed so I can’t leave?”
.” Blaise was definitely supressing a grin. “Well, you disarmed Pansy, so she couldn’t just Apparate with Harry.”
The lady turned bright red and handed out their change without another word.
So, he just gave her the tiniest nod and instantly focused his attention on the pitch, where a group of ten fliers kicked off and then immediately crashed into each other.
“Why don’t you stick around and see?” Draco slid his wand back into his sleeve and pretended like he hadn’t just almost stupefied the Chosen One. “Merlin, fuck. Can’t you just ask me to join you like a normal person?”
The chains creaked as Potter turned his seat to face Draco. Draco looked at him and was baffled to see that he was smiling slightly.
Potter snorted into his beer and shot him a look. He was definitely not sober anymore. His eyes were somewhat dazed and where they were touching, Draco could feel Potter’s body tension dwindling. But then again, Draco felt rather tiddly himself, so who was he to judge?
“No way she would have believed that! That is the
And then there was the sound of running water, struggling and several voices yelling all at once.
no other option than to hold his breath and Potter’s arm.
“Just saying.” Draco came over to drag the hood back over Harry’s head. “Don’t be shocked when it gets out after all.”
“No way,” Draco repeated, looking over his shoulder just to be sure that nobody was watching them. “That was way too easy.”
don’t want it,
Instead of addressing Draco’s objection, Potter changed the topic as smoothly as only he could. “And to answer your question: It’s not all Chocolate Frogs.”
“I don’t see
“I hate fashion. Fashion can bite me.
They were silent for several minutes during which Harry stroked Draco’s arm with his fingertips. Draco watched their shoes, which were sticking out from under the Cloak.
Harry grinned and finally managed to coax Odysseus out of the window several minutes later.
Well, there was one, but Draco certainly wasn’t going back to the place where he’d gotten bloody
“I wish I did.”
about?”
“Are you thinking Mafia?” Harry asked, clicking his fingers at him. Draco’s pizza was already gone.
“And what are the rest of you doing?” asked Draco in an attempt at lightening the mood.
They both knew Potter wouldn’t wake up for at least eight hours after taking the potion, but somehow Draco felt it would by hypocritical of him to point this out. It wasn’t like
“Don’t worry, Draco,” said Ginny, “I’m not really hungry anyway.”
Draco shook his head. His mouth seemed unable to form words and moving his tongue was getting harder and harder.
Draco sighed and put away his wand to dictate some instructions to his clipboard. He glanced at the clock and sighed some more.
“Quit buggering around! You should be doing your exercises.”
“Someone’s coming.”
“Partly,” he answered shortly. “How did you know?”
The cover of
So, who do you think volunteered them? 🤔
There were a few seconds of silence during which Harry held the contents up and examined them from all sides. Then he dropped them and turned to look at Draco, who was keeping his eyes on the Cloak.
His eyebrows were drawn together tightly and he looked somewhat imposing with the broom in his hand and his muscles on full display. Which were not exactly bulky, but definitely
with him?
Potter put a hand on his arm. “You can’t Apparate from here. They’ll be watching from the window.”
“Like where?”
“Pansy.”
“Together with thirty Hufflepuffs trying out for their house team?”
“Just you wait until Harry gets here,” Draco boasted, raking a hand through his (magically attached) hair. “You won’t be able to tell the difference. Unless he’s disguised as a vampire or something. Which would make me the more convincing Harry out of the two of us. But seriously, what’s with all the vampires?”
He started to play songs by the Weird Sisters inside his head. He didn’t even particularly like them, but Theo’s obsession with the band had ensured that he knew most of their songs by heart.
“Fine,” said Draco coldly. He turned around and left the attic without so much as a look back.
Draco stopped in his tracks. A man ran into him from behind, excused himself quite inexplicably and went around him. Harry grabbed his hand and pulled him along before there could be any more collisions.
He didn’t actually know if it really was, but it might be true, right? (No. No, it certainly
know they are dating, right?”
Also, had Potter called him ‘
Draco groaned demonstratively. He had nothing, really. But he wasn’t going to tell her that whenever Gryffindor had played, his focus had mostly been trained on one particular player, hoping with all his might that he would just get hit by a Bludger or fall from his broom again or maybe, just maybe, be upstaged by another Seeker. It certainly hadn’t been a secret that Draco had been a rather enthusiastic supporter of Diggory after that one memorable match in third year.
“Wonders never cease.”
“He’s a legend.”
“I find it unlikely that Potter would willingly spend time in the same room as me,” he said slowly. “And if he knew who did it, he wouldn’t have you investigating, right? I’d wager you’re not the type to
“Are you denying you were being a bitch?”
He went to the door, taking deep breaths and building up his mental walls with every step. Here was to hoping the glamour would hold.
(See the end of the chapter for
He cast a short glance over to the car, where Olivia was still trapped. He didn’t doubt that he could get her out in no time. He would probably even be able to pull some strings and get her admitted to St. Mungo’s. She was a close friend of Harry’s, after all.
“How very generous,” said Draco. “Inviting me to dinner at half past four, half an hour after I’ve had lunch.”
“Why would something be wrong with them?” said Draco, playing innocent.
“I could!” said Harry hotly, letting go of his hand to rummage through his bag. He handed Draco his Invisibility Cloak and then vanished underneath his own.
“What,” Pansy said flatly.
“You’re the embodiment of Christmas cheer,” said Harry, stifling a yawn himself.

Draco sat up and watched as Harry got to his feet, took off the backpack and then opened one of the remaining two pizza boxes to assess the damage.

Potter looked over his shoulder with a frown. “We’re eighteen, Malfoy.” Potter hesitated and added, “
“You’ve seen it five times already,” said Olivia in her sweetest voice, glancing at Harry repeatedly.
“Giving up after all?” Draco asked incidentally as he turned another page.

Or you could just read this chapter, instead. (Although it may take a bit longer than seven minutes.)
“Let’s go home. I need a very hot bath.”
Lauren sat upright and grinned down at him. “Please, if you like
Draco groaned. “I filed a motion with the Ministry. They’re going to see if they can find his mother’s family or place him with S.U.M.O. if they can’t.
Draco groaned and pushed some of the clothes off the bed so he could lie down beside Harry. “It’s Aurelius. He knows I usually shower after I get back from work, so he lays out something for me to wear.”
Draco, who knew Harry well enough by now, seemed the only one to notice the split-second hesitation before Harry said lightly, “Sure.”
“Because it will fucking
“Your nonna loves me,” Olivia said, unimpressed.
“It was a rough week,” Harry said tonelessly. “Could you tell Lauren ... tell her ... I’m sorry for what happened with Olivia.”
Well…
Then he placed his head in Draco’s lap, who patted him absentmindedly and muttered, “Thanks a lot for
“What do you need that for?” Draco asked, trying to evade the question. How should

Blaise barely listened. He was already striding over to the wall and examining it, shining his Lumos at every crack and crevice. Well, at least Draco would be able to smuggle Harry into his bed without trouble. Blaise seemed like he would be occupied for a while.
“I don’t think so.” The usher scoffed. “And I’d advise you to leave before I call security.”
“I think you’re ill, P– Harry,” Draco said. Might as well use Potter’s hallucinations to his advantage now. “Why don’t you lie back down and I’ll get you something to eat?”
it. He hated how much it excited and scared him at the same time.
They didn’t talk for close to an hour after that, but that didn’t mean that the library was silent.
Draco put away his fork to fully concentrate on Potter. “What did you
He pressed his ear against the door and listened.

He prayed that the wizard really

Liam’s head whipped around to face first Draco and then Potter, and he looked simply delighted. “School? Don’t tell me –”
“Oh.”
already,” Draco said mockingly.
Draco sighed and went to breakfast. So much about discretion. This was starting to be a nuisance.
Harry pushed the briefcase towards him in one swift motion. Draco sighed and turned the third wheel to zeta. There was a faint vibration at his fingertips as it snapped into place. Draco hesitated.
“Don’t tell her, then.”
Draco really didn’t know what to make of that. This wasn’t how Greyson had previously reacted when his players got injured. On the other hand, maybe Greyson was finally coming to his senses? After five months, he could be starting to trust Draco’s expertise, right?
Draco didn’t need to see this, didn’t want to be reminded of the day Harry had almost died. He didn’t want to think about the choices he had made.
“Malfoy.” Granger stuffed the chocolate into her pocket and looked at him with an expression he couldn’t read. Was it confusion? “Zabini thinks Harry signed the both of you up.”
” Draco said, sitting up jumpily and then instantly doubling over in pain.
“I didn’t ask you here to talk about myself,” Draco said matter-of-factly. “We won’t be overheard here, that’s why I chose it.”
else.”
“He’s ... um ...” She got up from his bedside and went to open a window. She didn’t turn back to face him. “He’s meeting with your parents downstairs.”
