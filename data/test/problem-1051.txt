…! If you think I’m good when I’m just whinging about being poor, you should see me when I actually put in some effort.”
“You should see the way they look at each other,” Cassie told Harry, reminding him inexorably of Peeves the Poltergeist.
McGonagall—she didn’t trust Draco. She wanted Harry to be safe and happy. Only Draco’s actions would win her round, so there was no point in talking to her. It was similar with Hermione. He listened to her, of course, but that was more for his benefit than hers. Draco suspected he and Hermione would have a lot to talk about if she ever actually trusted him. But that would take time, and his mother had warned him about trying to shorten the timescale of trust.
breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Wizards had long ago discovered an anti-cancer potion; it just needed to be taken every day for a prolonged period. If Malfoy had been caught giving it to a muggle, he would have been sent back to Azkaban in a heartbeat.
Everyone was a bit weird that year, anyway. By ten p.m. Neville was getting head from Parvati Patil in the kitchen in front of a cheering crowd. Harry retreated to the empty library and wondered whether he was a washed-up old man.
“Oh, of course it’s fine for you to fuck me, but God forbid the Chosen One’s manliness should be impugned!”
“Draco. It was brilliant. I loved it. The way the costume slowly disintegrated the more you cried? Amazing. Although I feel those people deserve to know that in reality, you’re not a pretty cry-er.”
That was something else— Malfoy’s questions were often ones that made Harry think positively. He would ask things like “What do you like best about summer?” or “Did you ever have a really great Christmas?”
“So, er, just make yourself at home,” said Harry. “Maybe after dinner, I could ask you about the curse.”
“It’s not lust. I told you. I’m in love with you. And I couldn’t be in love with you if you didn’t feel remorse.”
“Yeah! I know what you’re doing. You’re keeping your options open so you can still go and marry some respectable girl in four years.”
The first few times, Draco stalked through the entire manor, determined to find the source of the noise. Eventually, he had to admit that it was in his head. This realisation in no way changed the terror that struck him each time it happened, nor the several hours of sleeplessness that would follow as the adrenaline coursed through him.
“Nervous,” he said, because saying he felt happy seemed like a good way to bring down the wrath of the gods. Karma. Retribution,
Eighteen-year-old Draco would have asked, “Why do you care?” But the last few years had taught him that some people really just were kind, for no other reason than that the world was good.
“Well, don’t be! Christ alive, do you know how much worse it is, if they think you’ve been tattling? In any case, I’m
“And I’m sure your friends have a great deal of sympathy for your circumstances. Just as I sympathise with why Draco was a Death Eater. Doesn’t mean I can forgive you, anymore than your friends will ever forgive him.”
“Would… would you let me write you a letter? You wouldn’t have to write back. I wouldn’t bother you, I promise. Only dad always said you were the cleverest witch he ever met, and I—”
“I’m not going to curse you!” he said, but Draco still couldn’t draw breath, although he was clearly trying to. Harry pulled a chair out from the table and pushed Draco into it.
“You know, if you just want to be friends, I would be fine with that,” he said. “I mean, I’d be sad, but I’d get over it. I would never hold it against you. You don’t
“Never mind,” said Harry. He wished he hadn’t thought of the wild spontaneous sex comparison in his head. It wasn’t helping. “Cool, okay, see you at school then!”
“I wonder what it is about me, that people always assume they’ll be the ones who have to propose,” said Draco.
On Christmas morning, they exchanged gifts in Harry’s bed. Draco had slept there every night since the day they went ice skating. Draco still couldn’t quite believe any of this, but he did not question it too much. He tried to enjoy the temporary miracle of Harry Potter thinking he was in love with him, while it lasted.
“No, listen,” he said, but then he began to cough. It was by far the worst he had ever sounded. In fact, thought Harry, it sounded like Draco. Lamorak took out a white handkerchief and held it to his mouth as he hacked and wheezed. The handkerchief was stained with dark brown spots.
Not for the first time, Harry wondered what had happened to all of Malfoy’s friends from Slytherin. Crabbe was dead and Goyle was still in prison, but what of the others? Pansy and Blaise, and all the other Slytherins who used to laugh at Malfoy’s jokes and admire everything he did?
“And Adelaide hasn’t had another relapse, so that’s a weight off my mind,” said Draco, conclusively. “I suppose, between all that, my outlook has—”
“On a scale of one to ten,” said Harry. He didn’t finish his sentence. He didn’t need to, Draco knew what he meant.
“You haven’t got off with me without feeling guilty that you couldn’t get it up with your girlfriend. Am I right?”
“Oh, Draco,” he said. He took Draco’s gnarled right hand and acted on that old impulse, lovingly kissed each knuckle. “You’re not.”
couldn’t…!” spluttered Draco. “It would have been incredibly presumptuous, if I had started being like, Oh
“No,” agreed Cassie. “I’m very clever. But you know Father, he always wants to be the best. So he wants me to be the best, too.”
“Once you have a few years experience, it’ll be much easier,” he said, and this made sense to Draco.
“Oh, please. You haven’t fallen for his remorseful villain act, have you? You should have seen the letter he sent me when he got out of Azkaban.”
“Just seventh year, now,” said Draco, when Harry finished telling him about breaking up with Ginny and preparing to hunt horcruxes.
It felt as if Potter would laugh at him, if he said yes. As if Potter would call him a coward again. He could still feel all the places on his body where Potter had touched him like he mattered.
Harry remembered that strange, rootless feeling he had felt when he slept with Will. The longing he had felt for someone to tie himself to.
“I’ll help you tidy up,” she told Malfoy. It seemed a pretty clear social signal that Harry should leave.
Draco came back to Harry’s bedroom, of course. He hadn’t slept in his own bedroom since he broke up with Neville.
“Like what?” asked Seamus. On the screen, Malfoy’s eyes went blank as he read something on his computer. Then he laughed, said something with a smirk, and shrugged one shoulder out of his shirt.
When Harry thought about it, he knew that what Draco had said was true. Blaise would sell Harry out in a heartbeat if he needed to. But he’d also never stop caring about Harry; never, no matter what. It was a strange, conflicting sort of realisation.
“I feel duty-bound to tell you that Potter and I got off last night,” said Draco, after lunch. He, Mirth and Astoria were in Astoria’s dorm again.
“Narcissa,” said Andromeda, who had been staring into the depths of her coffee all this time. “When will you tell Narcissa?”
“You… what?” said Harry. They were in the park—it was a glorious, daffodil sort of spring that year. Blue skies, and even Hermione was wearing sun dresses.
“Bye Lucie! We love you!” shouted one of the naked women at the back of the dressing room. Lucius gave her an uncomfortable smile and left.
Draco stopped laughing, but he was still looking at Harry with a wondrous, joyful expression, like he couldn’t quite believe his luck.
The first time Harry saw Draco Malfoy after the trials was at Zacharias Smith’s bizarre country manor house party.
It was good to be back in England. He had missed clouds, and decent chocolate, and being able to order tea at a coffee shop without having to patiently walk the barista through the process.
“Some mistakes are based on unchangeable things,” said Draco. “Mr Dinsmore, if I don’t put in the lacewings now, I’ll have to start from scratch. Please excuse me.”
Harry, it had to be said, was still rather drunk from the night before. He had gone to a muggle club and slept with two different men in a row. The first one was shite so he had to go back for seconds. The second one wasn’t much better, but by the time they were done Harry was so dizzy he couldn’t stand up and he called it a night.
Harry knew he could be a bit oblivious, but the moment had been intimate. A step towards something Harry hadn’t realised how much he wanted until it was there in front of him: Draco, in his bedroom, caring for Harry, letting Harry care back.
Harry squeezed Draco’s leg under the table from time to time, and whenever he did, Draco would find his hand and press it.
Harry had let the Battle of Hogwarts happen. Had let people he loved die for him. He had done what Draco could not: sacrificed his home for what was right.
Draco tore his off costume like a dragon scratching off its skin. By the time he was nearly naked, it seemed less that he had revealed his body than that he had peeled his body off, unearthing something vulnerable and private beneath; something more tender than muscles and skin.
“You’re brilliant,” said Draco. It was like the intoxication one felt when sober around drunk people. “You suggested it. You’re a genius. You’re the cleverest person I’ve ever met.”
“I used to come here a lot as a child. It was lovely, back then. Apart from the elf heads. You haven’t kept them, have you?”
“I won’t.” He pressed his lips to Draco’s forehead. “I’ll be back soon. We’re going to fix this. I promise.” He stood to leave, caught sight of Draco, and had to swoop back down to kiss his forehead again. He was filled with an affection so fierce it made him want to pick Draco up and
“Because I saw him. On the day of the battle. I saw him beg Voldemort to end it, so that you would be safe.”
“Dean! Let’s find Dean, he’ll give you a line or two, and you’ll cheer right up, darling, right up, then we’ll go home and I’ll make you see stars, I’m so good, aren’t I, so good for you, I love you, and you love me, don’t you, you love me?”
“What has she got to do with it?” asked Harry, who hadn’t thought about Eloise Midgen since he was about fourteen.
So Harry attended alone. He quickly found Blaise, who had befriended one of the champagne waitresses. He was holding a champagne glass in each hand.
. She is—or she was—someone I thought of with pure and unadulterated affection, and the fact that that’s more complicated now is absolute shite, basically. God, am I the most boring person in this pub?”
“Yes, join the club, Scarhead,” said Malfoy. “Doesn’t stop you from seeking me out like some needy little girlfriend, does it?”
Astoria raised an eyebrow. She was six inches shorter than Harry, yet she made him feel like a child. Of course Draco would end up with someone like that. Someone intimidating and gorgeous and cultured.
“I’d know, if he were dead,” said Draco. “I’d feel a shiver run through me, and a cry in my very soul, or whatever. Like in novels. I’d
“There’s this website that Pansy—you know, I don’t want to go into it,” said Draco. The duvet had fallen down between them. Draco stepped out of it. He was naked, but Harry held him too tightly for it to feel vulnerable.
“You’re a show-off,” he said. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, drawing their hips together.
“There’s wild, and then there’s taking pills by yourself on a Tuesday,” said Harry. “She’s not okay, Draco.”
The eighth years were all in a tower together. Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws in one dorm, Gryffindors and Slytherins in another.
The article, when it came out in the Prophet, was not nearly as life-ending as Draco had thought it would be. For one thing, the writer had interviewed a dozen Hogwarts students, who had all extolled Draco’s mysterious dark charm at length. For another, the Quibbler article had appeared the day before, so the Prophet couldn’t get away with too many untruths.
) The man gave him one and lit it for him when Draco’s fingers trembled too much to work the lighter.
Harry finished cooking. Ate his food. Tried several times to coax the kitten out from under the sofa, to no avail.
It was true. Draco’s hands had a near constant tremor. Ginny had remarked on it several times. Harry had asked him about it, too, but questions about pain or discomfort were one of the things Steven had instructed him to respond to with belligerence, so he had practically bitten Harry’s head off. Harry had never brought it up again. Their wonderful, fragile friendship was fast withering, now that Draco was constantly being a dick, and also apparently sleeping with someone else. Not that Harry would have allowed himself to treat Draco differently because of
“That’ll be nice,” said Astoria, moving away from Mirth to go look for something in her wardrobe. Mirth tugged unhappily at the bobby pins in her hair, pulling the hairstyle down around her ears.
“Why didn’t you tell him about the curse?” asked Pansy, as if Blaise hadn’t spoken. He crawled to the bar cart and poured himself a whisky.
“Partner with me,” he said, his eyes darting around the room. Parvati was making a beeline towards him.
“When did you get permission from the Ministry, anyway?” grumbled Ron at breakfast. Harry watched Draco gloomily from across the great hall. Draco had been gone when he woke up. It would have surprised Harry that this hadn’t woken him, if it weren’t for the fact that, with Draco in his bed, he had slept more deeply and completely than he had in a year.
Harry stirred. His eyelids flickered. His hand broke free of Draco’s grip. He sat up, opened his eyes, and looked at Draco.
“Mayhem,” said Ron. “Pansy’s been voted Miss America. Hermione’s joined a nudist colony. Neville—shit, sorry.”
“Good thinking,” said Kingsley. He went to a locked cabinet at the back of his office and fetched a small glass vial. He knelt by Draco and administered three drops on Draco’s tongue. Draco’s eyes went blank and emotionless.
Harry figured that was all right— feelings. Feelings were usually fine to talk about. But when L opened his mouth to answer, the spell caught at his words, and he leant his head into the pillow.
“I’ll prove it,” he said, looking through his phone. “Hang on, can I text this to you? It’ll be easier. And then you can tell me next time you plan on leaving me languishing like a maiden in a castle.”
Draco was shivering in a cell. He looked fragile and freezing. Narcissa Malfoy sat across from him. But it wasn’t really Narcissa Malfoy, Harry reminded himself. It was Draco, talking to himself.
“I think you’ve had a huge impact on her,” said Harry, then, to Ron and Hermione. “Draco adopted her when he was only nineteen.”
“It would have been okay, if you were,” said Harry. “I mean, if you wanted to be with someone else. I mean. Just because we’re sort of living together—I just mean—”
“Harry!” He was still holding his flask. “It’s Pepper-Up Potion. Here, you can smell it.” He unscrewed the lid and held out the flask to Harry, who laughed.
“I’m just looking around,” he said. “I don’t want to be tied down.” He bit his lip provocatively. “I just want lots and lots of meaningless sex with good looking people, if you know what I mean…”
“He will go to St Mungo’s while we decide how to proceed,” said Kingsley. “Obviously, the bond cannot be reinstated now that we know how susceptible it is to abuse. However, I doubt we can shorten his sentence—”
“Sorry, that came out wrong,” said Harry, hastily. “I’m not—this isn’t, a confession of—I mean, I like you as a person.”
“Your problem is that you don’t want anyone to know you’re suffering,” she said, as if she hadn’t just kissed him. “But they
He was just thinking this when Draco’s slim, pale hand fell upon his wrist. Draco leant into his ear.
“Why?” asked Astoria. The room had fallen silent. The gramophone was magically designed to tune into the noise level of the people around it, so the music died away, too.
Only someone who knew Pansy very well would have known how distressed she was. Her voice was calm and steady.
“Of course I do,” said Ron, going red in the face. “And I think he’d be a hell of a lot happier with someone who wasn’t a bigoted prick of a Death Eater.”
“I was looking into the prison sentence for that sort of breach of the Statute of Secrecy, and it’s actually only seven years.”
changed,” said Harry. “Doesn’t matter, though. I could never date a Death Eater. It’s on his fucking arm, Lam. The Dark Mark. Kind of a deal breaker.”
When Harry made fun of Draco insisting it was casual, Draco changed the subject. Every night, Draco turned into a kitten and let Harry cuddle him, as if that made any difference to how serious it was between them.
In class, Harry watched L cast spells, quicker and surer the rest of their cohort. There were only fourteen left of the original twenty-six, and their two-year training period was coming to an end. Then they would be full Unspeakables, and the Mysteries charm would be removed. Harry tried not to freak out when he remembered. He knew L was worried too.
He lurched forward into Harry’s arms and sobbed his heart out. Harry stayed, wondering what Ron would say if he could see him, and murmured “there, there” occasionally, until Goyle finally stopped weeping.
“Goodnight,” he said, kissing Harry so quickly Harry barely had time to register it before Draco was gone.
The Auror department was in total chaos. He could hear the shouting all the way from the apparition point.
“Don’t mind him,” said Malfoy. “He’s just worried I’ll reveal how kinky the sex is. Make sure you mention that to Neville, when you next see him. See if you can imply that Potter beats me with a paddle.”
“You’re fun,” said Harry. “You know? You’re very lovable. I feel like you’re going to figure everything out, because you’ve become so—”
, only that Dean had mentioned he and Seamus were going to the anniversary event at Hogwarts), Draco got him a glass of water. Maybe he was going to get him water anyway, Harry didn’t know. But in the moment, it had felt kind. When Harry stopped remembering to eat, Draco showed up at his work at lunchtime a few times a week and took him out to restaurants.
“Please don’t mention it again, I feel humiliated enough,” said Draco sharply. His slight rudeness seemed to fortify Professor McGonagall.
“I bet you’re good at camping,” he said, and Harry knew exactly what he was doing. He wasn’t quite asking. He was maybe asking.
“I’ve packed you a potions case,” said Astoria. “Pepper-Up, more cough-suppressant, head-ache potion, a general pain-killer…”
It was like tickling, he realised. You couldn’t tickle yourself. He could say those words to Pansy and mean them, but applied to himself they lost all their effect.
“Kant says that—to simplify—every person is an end-in-themselves,” she said. “Their value is unconditional. It doesn’t depend on anything else. You cannot use a person as a means to an end, because a person
Draco was leaning so far out of the window that Harry had to tamp down an instinct to drag him back by the collar of his long-sleeved pyjama top.
“The boys…” she said. Draco tightened his grip around her. “… the boys only like me because I put out!”
Harry tilted his head. Draco was fixing his hair in the hall mirror. He hadn’t really looked at Harry all day.
to him. He would sit near Harry, looking disgustingly fit, and ask him what he was up to, how he slept, how he was feeling, whether he had plans. Harry answered in suspicious, short sentences, but that didn’t seem to deter Malfoy in the least.
“A stunning insight from Ron Weasley, as always,” said Malfoy. He sighed and stretched. “I’d better go answer him.”
Draco opened the door when Harry knocked. His pupils were wide, his cheeks flushed. He didn’t say anything, but turned around and went into his bedroom. Harry followed, closing the door behind him.
. I’ve just been busy with the cooking club, and they’ve been really weird about it. They’re just jealous.”
“You know,” said Harry, and this was the drinks, he was pretty sure, “you’re the only friend I’ve ever really felt was
if you can afford to buy a Firebolt, that’s an absurd broomstick to give a twelve-year-old, and anyway I’ve been saving up to buy Scorpius his Nimbus for years now—”
“What’s that?” she asked, coming back ten minutes late from her cooking club. She was wearing less makeup than usual, Draco noticed. He hoped it was a sign that she was feeling more confident.
“I like that you always let me change the conversation when I want,” said Draco, à propos nothing. Harry quietly took another bite of his salad. Draco frowned at the table.
“…and as someone who’s seen the best— and the worst—” she winked at Harry, and brought her index and her thumb together to denote his small penis (this, Draco thought, did Harry a disservice)— “of
“Okay, fine, I had it easier than Weasley. But come on! Four years I’ve been trying to get an invite, literally
“So the plan is, he falls in love with Lamorak, then you confess your true identity, boom bada boom?” asked Pansy, leaning against the enormous standing stones of Stonehenge.
The kiss was not at all the way Draco had imagined it would be, when he was fifteen. It was gentle and questing. It was soft, punctuated by the sharpness of Harry’s stubble. It was a little clumsy, because Harry was so drunk. He hadn’t even drunk that much, but Draco supposed his tolerance had gone down since the summer.
It was hard to think of what to say, after that. Will had long, sloping gait, and he walked with his hands in his pockets.
He didn’t have a way to contact Harry as Lamorak, so he went to see Luna. He took the tube, texting Jack when he had signal to pass the time. (Books were beyond him. He had read twenty off his list of fifty. He tried not to think about it.)
“And I never will,” said Draco, returning with sudden fervour to his hamburger. “Now fuck off with your nosy questions, the lot of you.”
“Trust me. It was more than nosiness.” Harry paused, trying to avoid thinking about the painful twisting in his stomach. “Would you want to be with him, if he was up for it?”
“Yeah, okay, yeah,” said Harry. He let Draco go. “I mean, I feel obligated to tell you that turning into a kitten when you’re upset is, at the very least, a
“I… It’s gone quickly,” he said. Harry nodded. He looked distraught, but in that noiseless way he had when he was sad but not angry. Harry had no problem showing it, when he was indignant. But when he was hurt, he was often still and brave like this, and it made everything so much worse.
. This one took up most of his time, because it was the most sensible option, particularly now that Draco had a better grip on Tertius’ business, which was illegal potions trading. But the Floo Network was monitored, and Draco only ever had enough money to buy precisely what he was told to get. Returning without resulted in violent repercussions.
“This is such a bad idea,” Draco said, over and over, but he didn’t stop. His skin was soft and damp and overwhelming. Harry focused on the bits of Draco that were undamaged. He kissed his way up the pure white of Draco’s neck.
“Oh, yeah,” said Harry. Draco must have been all right, because his hand was glamoured, and his hair neatly styled, and he looked absolutely untouchable. “Yeah, I thought it would be, just, easier.”
“Ron, don’t be so prejudiced,” said Hermione. “He was all right at the end, wasn’t he? I have to say, Harry, I think he was trying to save you from Crabbe and Goyle in the Room of Requirement. Remember how he kept telling them not to kill you?”
They walked idly through the park, feeding the ducks with grapes Adelaide had brought, stopping to get ice cream even though it was too cold. Harry continually forgot himself and touched Draco in small ways, taking his hand, leaning into his shoulder, tilting his head too close when he laughed at something Draco had said. In his defence, Draco was doing the same, constantly leaning in only to suddenly and guiltily pull back.
“I had a bit of a wobble over the weekend, but Theo took me to the National Portrait gallery,” said Draco.
“You’re going to be just fine,” babbled Harry. “Adelaide, you need, can you, I need you to take him to St Mungo’s.”
He wondered whether Malfoy had bought his way into the Department. He remembered Ron saying that the Malfoys always got away with murder. They were given chance after chance, all the way through history. Privilege earned them privilege, and now Harry was suffering for it.
And then he did. It was, as Harry had suspected, not a very close connection. A statue where some Knutters lingered on occasion, if you knew when to look.
“Funny,” said Mirth. “I guess we’re stuck with this comedian, Astoria?” Mirth looked at Draco with ill-concealed dislike. “Astoria’s got a hard-on for fixing people.”
“Why the fuck didn’t you speak at his trial?” asked Harry, as the thought occurred to him. “Do you know that he was convicted of 27 counts of the cruciatus curse?”
Harry was glad that Draco had found happiness abroad. He really was, and one day, maybe not too long from now, Harry would be happy as well. It was a strange, anguished sort of feeling, because getting over Draco felt like losing him. But increasingly, Harry could see that romance aside, he had the people he needed in his life. There was something comforting about that, even if it wasn’t quite what he wanted.
Ron and Hermione managed all right, but they had each other. Or maybe that wasn’t it, because they were always there for him, of course. Maybe it was just that Harry was boring, when it came down to it. Maybe the most interesting thing about Harry had been that someone wanted to kill him, and now that no longer applied. Certainly that was what Malfoy seemed to think.
When Draco returned to the table with a pint glass of water and some chips (which, bizarrely, Madam Rosmerta had told him were on the house), Steven Hodges was sitting next to Harry.
Draco didn’t panic very often anymore. The last time had been when Harry got his wand out and pointed it at him unexpectedly when they were having a heated discussion about artistic merit in Soviet Russia. (At least, that was what Draco had been arguing about. Harry had been arguing that Draco needed to come in from the cold—they had been in Lapland at the time, watching the Northern Lights.) Draco had a medium-sized panic, but it transpired that Harry had only cast a warming charm on him.
Draco looked unseeingly at his book, thinking. Harry knew exactly what he was doing, but Ginny seemed annoyed.
When Draco got home, he paused before unlocking the door. He needed to formulate his face. The last thing he wanted was for Adelaide to know something was wrong. Not that he would be able to tell her, anyway, the contract would bind his tongue, but all the same, he was ashamed of himself. He would hate for Adelaide to let someone treat her that way. He felt that he was a pretty poor example of self-respect. He also knew that he would do it again, given the chance.
said the front cover, splashed over a black and white picture of Harry looking much as he did now: topless and sex-tousled, except that Harry in the picture was completely relaxed in his pillows. Not a photoshoot: a candid, an intimate one, and although it didn’t show anything, it was a violation.
“‘Should have brought an umbrella,” Harry heard him say. “Is it all right if I stay until this passes?”
Harry felt faint. He was surprised to find that he didn’t feel self-conscious, because Pansy was watching him so affectionately, and he only had eyes for her.
“Of course I’m right,” he said. “I’m always right. So, now you can finally relax. Let me show you a good time, yeah?”
“I have, under the table,” said Mark lecherously, and everyone threw food at him, and Harry never found out what it was that Draco would figure out, eventually.
Things were starting to fall in place in Harry’s head. Draco’s conviction, when Harry first went through a difficult period, that Harry couldn’t possibly want him around. Draco’s insistence on transforming into a kitten to give silent comfort. The deep hurt he had tried to hide when Harry made that offhand remark about him being a Death Eater, moments after Draco had held him and loved him.
“Yeah, so I’ve been told. I don’t know how the fuck you’ve managed to convince all my friends that you’re my soulmate, but you can drop the act now.”
To Harry’s immense surprise, Draco’s whole face lit up. Harry had never seen him look like that, as if he had just won something he’d only dreamed of.
“Hmm,” said Malfoy, “I’ll take off that horrible shirt you’ve inflicted on yourself, and draw you a bath, and give you a lovely massage…”
“Read the room, Pans. Not that kind of night,” he said. Pansy shrugged and poured some out onto one of Neville’s coffee table books about South American plant life.
tell you. And do you remember what you said? Because I do. I’ve never forgotten. You said that I was still a fucking Death Eater, that you didn’t want anything to do with me, and that you’d only shagged me because I was easy. You said if I wanted help I should have taken it when Dumbledore offered.”
It was very hard to find a lead. The trail had been cold for so long. He couldn’t find so much as a trace of Narcissa Malfoy. The Slytherins in general seemed to have vanished into nothingness. After a few weeks of searching, he had to accept that unless Draco gave him more information, there was no chance that Harry would be able to find them. And Draco never spoke about them for long enough for there to be any stray details.
Which would have been touching, had not been immediately followed by Harry announcing that Draco would serve as Adelaide’s guinea pig. Harry pulled the sofa cushions out and made Draco stand in front of them and directed Adelaide to stun Draco, over and over, until she had got the hang of it.
“Think how different everything would have been if you’d been in Slytherin,” said Draco. “You might have actually pulled.”
“I am beginning to revise that theory,” said Draco, trying to sound unconcerned. He picked up one of Mirth’s perfume bottles and sniffed it.
say that,” said Harry. He hadn’t been to a therapist himself yet. He hadn’t had another episode in a while, not since his half-birthday party, when he had realised for the first time that no matter how lonely he felt, he was loved.
of dating someone on the opposite side of the war if he hadn’t come after me like a fucking heat-seeking missile.”
“That’s great,” said Michael. “I’m really proud of him.” But there was something off about the way he said it. He stood and went to look out the window. “I begged him to quit, and he never would. I’m glad he finally found something to quit for, whatever that was.”
After about fifteen minutes, there was a knock on his door. He opened it to see Draco, still looking rather unwell. Dean had gone.
But that wasn’t what Harry was angry about— he was jealous, and Draco didn’t have any patience for it. He was powerless to set Harry at ease, in any case. Steven had given him a long list of commands that prevented him from straying in any way from Steven’s version of events.
“Pretty sure you’re going to be hot well into your eighties,” said Harry. “You’ve got good bone structure.”
“Yes. But I’m not very good at hosting,” said Luna, chewing on her straw. She was drinking her latte through it, which Draco had resisted commenting on with difficulty. “Will you be there, at the events?”
“Budge over,” said Harry, climbing next to him. Draco moved so that there was space for Harry, but Harry had by that time realised he didn’t need space. He straddled Draco and kissed him.
Harry stunned the person who had cast the curse— he couldn’t see who it was, they were just a dim figure—and cast spells blocking off the corridor at both ends.
so quickly and easily, in the same breath as “Potter, you fucking idiot,” as if he was mopping up a glass Harry had spilled. Malfoy, whose hands had been all over Harry’s body, who had done Harry’s paperwork because he knew it stressed him, and left notes that said “I love you” in the pockets of Harry’s clothes.
“Should you be mixing that with your meds?” asked Daphne, sidling in to Pansy’s room and starting to make a round of gin and tonics.
“They’re very different places, Draco. Kuwait is in the Middle East, and Connemara is in Ireland,” he said.
with him? He had assumed Potter would rescue him out of pity. Lust was most definitely a step-up, although it was a truly bizarre, parallel-universe sort of twist. Was Potter even gay?
“Yeah,” said Harry darkly. He sighed again. “Look, I’m sorry I can’t help with your dad. That must have been really scary for you. Are you all right?”
“You said you were sleeping with other people,” said Draco, the choking pain reaching his throat. Harry pressed Draco’s face into his shoulder and spoke into Draco’s ear.
The next time Draco arranged to meet up with Pansy and Astoria to discuss The Bucket List, Daphne came too.
Harry did. He remembered Draco standing in his bedroom, docile and shivery, letting Harry touch one hand and then the other. He remembered that day at the office, convinced that something new was forming between them, only to come home to Draco making cocktails, celebrating getting back together with Neville.
Harry stood speechless, holding an icy bag of frozen peas. He wanted to say he hadn’t thought Draco was a bad person, but that wasn’t quite right, because he had, in terrifying flashes. Had liked Draco, and felt inherently connected to him, and wanted him—but had been frightened, all the time, that Draco would betray him. Better men than Draco had done it, after all.
This was so similar to the kind of thing Hermione continually said that Harry just stared at him for a moment.
“I’ve lost so many people, but always quickly,” explained Harry. “I’ve never had to watch them… deteriorate…”
Draco was to be the most Ravenclaw that ever did nerd. He quit the quidditch team (even though he loved it) so that he could study harder. It made Draco sad, but they both knew that Scorpius had a lot of repressed anger to deal with somehow or another.
“You have,” said Malfoy. “Here are your options. We can talk dirty for the next 45 minutes. I have a boundless imagination, you’d be surprised. We can play online geography quizzes. I could touch myself while you—”
For the first couple of hours, Ron and Hermione got him up to date on everything he had missed. There was a lot. The last time they had spoken, months ago, Harry had flooed in without warning, paced around their living room a few times, shouted “Stop pitying me!” and then stormed out.
“But I imagine it’s the same thing muggle borns deal with. A cultural rift. I mean, not that—I shouldn’t compare—I only mean, lots of people have this problem, in one way or another. Which lessens it, I suspect.”
“Fine,” said Draco. “You can carry me.” He tried to sound imperious, which was hard when all he felt was hopelessness. How had he ever charged down staircases so easily? He knew now he’d fall down them if he attempted it. He was so dizzy.
“All Unspeakables are protected by strict privacy spells, you know that, even if they leave the department.”
That night, Harry used his translation spell to look up up what Draco had said in French. He could only remember one word:
“He came asking for you,” said Seven. “I told him about how you gave me seventy pounds. He doesn’t seem to think much of you.”
Draco was still too stunned to do anything but nod when Bill asked if they were back together again, when Ron whooped and Mrs. Weasley cried and Ginny told Harry he’d been a real cunt and if he fucked up one more time she would personally ensure he never got laid again, by anyone.
“Draco,” said Andromeda. She sounded more surprised than appalled, which Draco thought was encouraging.
“There is pleasure in labour. Goodnight!” said Hermione, kissing Ron firmly on the mouth. Harry, Ron and Draco made their way up to their dormitory, Ron and Harry walking two steps in front him. Draco held back a little; he didn’t want to feel
“Oh,” said Draco. “There is no cooking club.” He looked at Harry, as if he was trying to justify himself, as if he expected Harry to criticise him. “I thought she’d joined a cooking club.”
Ginny Weasley looked more than usually pretty, and she kept anxiously twirling her hair around her fingers. They were settled in a corner booth at The Three Broomsticks. Draco had quietly excused himself when they first arrived and apologised to Madam Rosmerta. He knew what an awkward position Harry had put her in, and he explained to her that if she would like, he would happily arrange for Harry to order him to stay home whenever they came here. But Madam Rosmerta had been gracious and kind, and Draco rejoined the others feeling lighter.
He was lonely, Harry realised. Draco was crushingly lonely, so lonely that some days, it seemed to radiate through the screen; his desperation to talk to Harry, to hear about magic, to reminisce about the world he clearly still loved more than anything.
“It doesn’t really go with what I’m wearing,” protested Draco, but he wrapped the cravat around his collar and tied it with nimble fingers.
He stared at the books until the street lamps turned on, and went back to the mansion. Tertius knocked him once around the head for being late, but he didn’t guess what Draco had been considering. He was in a good mood that night, and after his flame of anger had abated, he pressed a cold compress to Draco’s cheek and told him, “Us Malfoys have to stick together, eh?”
“I can sort all that out, if you like,” said Draco. “We’ll just need to give an exclusive interview to the right reporter, so that we can spin it the way you want. Otherwise the press will have control of the story, and it will be… sordid.”
“Come on,” he said, and pulled at Draco’s hand. Draco stumbled after him, up the dusty stairs, into a messy bedroom. With a bed in it.
When she first joined their library sessions (and Merlin, did Hermione rule that friend group with an iron grip), Draco had instantly known what she needed. It was so obvious.
Then, when Draco said something to make them laugh, Harry crooked his arm around Draco’s neck, drew him close, and kissed him full on the mouth.
Harry idly ate a crisp. Seamus had bought a packet, ripped it open, and left it on the table so that everyone could have some. Harry admired Seamus for his casual little touches of generosity. Harry was generous when he thought about it, but so often he didn’t think about it.
“So… send me those,” said Harry, gesturing at the divorce papers. “And, er, thanks, I guess. I thought you’d kick up a big fuss.”
“I’ve been looking for you,” said Harry. “We want to play a game of quidditch, and the Hufflepuffs are short a seeker.”
The noise ebbed away as they left the pitch behind. Draco’s blood sang through him, exultantly alive. Colours accosted him with their brightness.
“What kind of flowers do you want for the service?” she asked, which was a ridiculous question, because obviously it was lilies. Draco had a grown a garden full of lilies for Harry when they bought the house. It kept stray cats away, but Harry’s whole face softened when he looked out the bedroom window and saw them.
“You say that about every year, and then it turns out you were fighting werewolves in the woods. I don’t trust your judgment.”
The kitchen was bright. Harry conjured blankets and swaddled Draco until all that could be seen of him was his pale, pointed face and his slippery, white-blonde hair. Draco’s delicate hands poked out of the blanket folds to clutch at the cup of tea Harry brought him.
“That’s a fucking awful thing to say. I know. But sometimes I just… want to see colours the way I used to.” Harry closed his eyes, remembering. “
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry, because that was part of the problem. He had thought he more or less trusted Draco, but the moment Draco said he wouldn’t apologise to Dean, Harry had instantly lost faith in him. Unfairly, as it turned out. But still. Clearly Harry wasn’t over the past. And the power dynamics were crazy. And also, it really wasn’t all that clear what Draco wanted out of all this.
“Are you… what do you mean? Because if you’re asking if Neville would ever hurt me, he wouldn’t. He’s an idiot, but he’s not…”
They leant in and kissed, long, with tongue. Draco got out his mobile. He had bought one at Jack’s request. They texted a few times a day.
“Sorry!” said Harry, removing his hands. There wasn’t an obvious place to put them, so he just sort of froze in a jazz hands position, which he was aware was not ideal.
“I—I’m trying not to think of it as permanent. Maybe I’ll have another good day, and I can go outside again.”
“Manipulate Potter into a relationship, become poster child for Evil Reformed, float through life basking in his reflected glory.”
Adelaide didn’t answer for a while. They only had her bedside table lamp on, the one with the pink shell-shaped lampshade, and the room glowed rose against the sunrise.
“You’ll be able to tell me, soon,” said Harry. L covered his face with his hands, as if Harry’s words had brought a fresh wave of grief upon him. “You’re scared about the Reveal,” said Harry.
“Well, night, love you,” said Harry. He realised what he’d said a split second after it had left his mouth. Draco’s eyes widened, and Harry fled.
“So how long will this let you keep the manor for?” asked Harry, once Draco had put all the documents into an envelope and sent them to Gringotts.
I was planning on having Harry try kittenhood BEFORE you all waded in with your puppy dog eyes so don't get any ideas
Pansy shut her mouth, shocked. Draco took a few steadying breaths before speaking again, and it worked. He sounded fine.
“I like them,” said Draco, still looking at the ceiling. Cassie swiped the box, opened it, and ate a chocolate.
Draco glared at them, flicked his hair bitchily over his shoulder, and turned to talk to Rain, the M.C.
“Don’t hurt them!” he said, because Kingsley had his wand out. Kingsley cast an incarcerous at Goyle and Draco and collected their wands.
“But that was only one raid—in one of the safe houses—I have no idea how they would have warning about the other raids, Harry, I didn’t tell him anything like that, I swear—”
Ginny Weasley had got the diary, but Draco knew. He knew, also, that when Harry spoke of his loyalty to Dumbledore and how it had saved his life, they were both thinking of sixth year.
Harry checked his pockets after Draco was gone, and sure enough, there was a tidily folded note in Draco’s clumsy, broken-handed print:
“Draco, you wear the invisibility cloak,” said Hermione. “If any of us are caught, we’ll pull the killing-Voldemort card.”
Draco shifted slightly. Put his hands on Harry’s chest so that he could push up and bare his neck to Harry. Harry determinedly looked only at the collar, not at Draco’s face, so near and so exquisite.
“Oh, no, Draco’s is by far the worst,” said Daphne. “It’s damp, too, isn’t it? And it gets such bad light.”
“Good,” said Draco. His fingers tapped against each other at his sides. “Good. So. Good morning. Goodbye.”
“You’re such a fucking coward, Malfoy,” sneered Harry. “Big enough to join the Death Eaters, but you can’t even say your master’s name, not even after I killed him.”
Ron looked at Hermione, and she put more milk in the saucepan, so there would be enough cocoa for Harry.
“It would be hard,” he said. “Because I wouldn’t be able to hide that, and he would know, and it would hurt him, and then when I calmed down I’d feel terrible but also… I don’t know, I mean, he poisoned me, right?”
Cassie glanced up at him, and Harry remembered how high the stakes were. He didn’t even know if he was in love with Draco.
“Er, yeah,” said Harry. “Good idea. Well, er, goodbye, then. Thank you for the, uh. So—yeah. Goodnight.”
“We could try it the other way round,” said Harry. They were in bed, even though it was eleven o’ clock in the morning.
“Could have fooled me,” said Malfoy, standing. God, he was tall, and his legs went on forever. “Oh, bollocks, Neville will be lurking around outside, like those charity people with the buckets outside the tube at Christmas—”
“Oh, sorry, I’m also a cheat,” said Draco, thrusting his hands deep into his pockets. “I wouldn’t call that one of my worst flaws, though, because I’m loyal to
The Aurors came the next day. Draco was writing in the study when the wards broke, and the alarm went, and suddenly it was like the war again, explosions and shrieks and curses streaking through the house. It did not last long. Fifteen minutes later, Draco, Tertius and Adelaide had been herded into the sitting room by the Aurors. Tertius was unconscious. Draco was immediately handcuffed. Adelaide, pale and tear-streaked, gave her deposition to an Auror with a clipboard. Potter wasn’t there. Draco had thought he would be. He couldn’t decide how he felt about his absence.
. It was like hanging out with someone out of a history text book. Potter would probably hate that. Potter probably wanted to be thought of as a
It was somehow different, picking up the kitten now that he and Draco were friends. Harry felt more comfortable manhandling him. He curled the kitten up into a small ball in his hands.
“You know, all you guys are dicks about him,” said Harry. “You could try having a little faith in him.”
“You two don’t look related,” said Sebastian, glancing at Draco. He appeared to have revised his opinion of Draco, who he had hitherto thought was a hopeless loser.
There was blood on the floor, rather a lot of blood. Heart thudding in his ears, Harry followed the red trail to a horribly familiar sight: Draco Malfoy bleeding to death in a bathroom.
He hadn’t changed, anyway. He would let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts again. He turned to face his mother. Her hair gleamed like polished silver as she watched him. He had to let them into Hogwarts, because unlike Potter, he had
, and he was… persuasive,” said Ainsley. “And agitated. So finally I said I’d go. I can’t have been gone longer than five minutes! I apparated there and straight back again!”
“I’ll see you around,” said Draco, at the last moment. Then the door closed, and Harry couldn’t ask him if he was just being polite.
“Beer?” he offered Seamus and Ron. Seamus didn’t seem to hear. He was too busy setting up Harry’s new magic-compliant laptop in front of a neutral background.
Harry tilted his neck slightly so that Draco could have better access to it. Draco kissed it slowly, reverently.
They went to the sitting room. Hermione paused by an armchair, her hands resting on its back, her face white and pinched.
For all Draco was clearly terrified, dinner with Ron and Hermione actually went remarkably well. Ron and Hermione were on their best behaviour, and Draco, who started out the evening with an impenetrable armour of etiquette, soon began to thaw. By dessert, he was telling them all about a particularly mad client he’d had, who had been the pampered boy toy of a South American shipping magnate.
“What are you two muttering about?” asked Ron, across from them. Now Harry thought about it, it was surprising that Draco had chosen to sit next to Harry at all—he was so nervy about anyone finding out about them. He made jokes about Harry’s BDSM exploits, but he didn’t stick to Harry’s side. He tended to butterfly around, although he often came back to whisper things to Harry, as if they were secretly tethered together. But today, unusually, he had sat next to Harry. Harry wondered what it meant, or if it meant anything at all.
Draco stared at him. His eyes were so pretty. Harry tried to see where the scars were but the glamour was too perfect. He couldn’t make them out at all.
Two months after Malfoy left, Harry returned to Grimmauld Place to find Timothy perched on his sitting room sofa.
Why not? That was, indeed, the question. The question that Hermione asked gently, and Ron asked bluntly, and Mrs Weasley avoided, and Luna Lovegood mused on— why hadn’t Harry found anything to fill his days with? Usually he made a joke and moved on, but under this small, Malfoyish eleven-year-old gaze, he felt disposed to be truthful.
Draco looked up at him, confused, then began to clink his glass, too. Soon the garden was loud with clinking.
“—yes, quite, and you’re a beloved national treasure, so it’s no contest, really. You can distract Cass from any anxieties this whole affair might cause her. Marvellous. I’m afraid you’re going to become extremely familiar with the Imperial War Museum. I’ve tried to get her interested in less militaristic pursuits, but it’s a no go.”
one of my flaws. But I meant my apology. That is—I mean the apology.” He looked at his hands. “I’m sorry.”
So they had gone as a household—the Misery Household—and Seamus looked fucking hot, of course. Pansy had seen to that. He was at his loudest and brightest, and Dean stared at him from across the room, handsome and intent and longing.
Colours became brighter. He spent more time with Ron. The two of them sneaked off to the barrow downs to smoke cigarettes. Ron didn’t like them, but he thought they looked cool. Draco didn’t think they looked cool, but he liked spending time alone with Ron.
“The year was 1996,” he began, in a rich, dramatic, melodious voice. “New York. I was a cab driver.”
He missed Pansy. Pansy would have sympathised with him. She had always been liberal with her consolations, even when Draco didn’t deserve them. She wouldn’t have pointed out that this was Draco’s own fault, for allowing himself to be used by someone who didn’t care about him, just because he was desperate and frightened and fascinated.
They had sex, as they did every night, slow and hard and dreamy. It was impossibly strange, to know each section of a person’s body in brief, hand-sized moments. The instant Harry stopped touching L, he forgot everything from the texture of his skin to the colour of his hair. He remembered only the feelings L had evoked; vague sensations of exquisite languor, and a sort of horrible beauty that twisted in Harry’s chest without him knowing why.
“Yeah, seems like the genuine article,” he said. His face grew serious. “And you’re not marrying Astoria?”
counts in the war, couldn’t be good and couldn’t be bad, and I made Neville utterly wretched, and now
“We don’t have the time to follow the rules,” said Harry, and thankfully Bianca didn’t argue with him any further. It helped that he was the youngest divisional head since the 18th century.
a Death Eater. But Ron had enough clout, and had said there wasn’t any proof, not even any motive. Draco was plenty rich. And everyone could testify to the fact that he was head over heels in love with Harry.
“Things are complicated enough between me and Cass without the press pitting you and me against each other. Whose side do you think she’ll take, if the whole world turns on you? She’ll blame me. You know she will.”
It was time, Harry realised, as he reread the conversation for the fourteenth time, to start telling Ron and Hermione about important things.
As always when Harry felt morally confused, he had turned to Hermione, and, as always when he felt pretty sure he was doing something wrong, he hadn’t told her the details.
Blaise anymore. Hermione was a better to friend to him than Blaise had ever been. Blaise still relied on Draco, but Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had talked about anything important to Blaise.
And then you’re back at the beginning again. I’ve heard it described as running through a house, trying to find a way out, but every door slams shut as you reach it.”
It was funny to think that fifteen-year-old Draco had fantasised about a situation not unlike this one. In fifth year, when his crush on Potter had spun nearly out of control, he had been disgusted with himself. It was necessary, therefore, to conjure up situations in which Potter
“Looks like it was four brothers. Vigilantes,” said Roseveare, passing Harry several photographs of burly, angry-looking men. “But they’re dead.”
“That you’re the best friend a boy could ask for. But I doubt I could even get it up. You’re so deliciously curvy.”
“Anyway, they’re staring at you because you look like something out of a fashion shoot, not because of who you are,” said Harry.
Draco grit his teeth and thought about not answering—but it was useless. He’d end up answering eventually.
Draco looked at her and realised her face was slightly… off. It was the visual equivalent of when you forgot a word, and kept thinking of other words instead, that were similar, but wrong. Her face was like that: similar, but wrong.
“What’s next? Half-breeds and Muggles?” asked Harry. He was trying—failing to make light of it. He wanted them to skip apologies, to go straight to jokes and friendship, because he didn’t know how to apologise to Malfoy for almost killing him when they were sixteen, for being cruel when Malfoy came to him, quiet and pliant and nineteen, asking for help.
“No one will respect you,” said Narcissa, or Draco, really. “They will pity you, if you’re lucky. But pity can easily be translated into love, and eventually that will lead to respect. You have to make them love you.”

of Draco’s tormentors, but others found ways to harm him, from pinching him and tripping him, to whispering horrible things to him in the corridors, so quietly that Harry could pretend not to hear them. Most days, Steven and his friends found at least one opportunity to beat Draco. It didn’t help that Harry wasn’t exactly punctual. Draco didn’t know
“I was only reading enough so that I could figure out how to sort them,” amended Draco. “You said—in your letter—about me taking care of you, and—and I know how bad you are at filing, and I thought it might be stressing you, so I figured I’d just—”
Draco chose that moment to come into the common room. Zacharias Smith went puffing up to him, guns a-blazing.
Draco looked at the biscuits and considered eating one, but the process of chewing and swallowing seemed, frankly, like a bit of a chore. As did everything. Every single option, except for the wind outside the window.
To punish himself for thinking such an awful, callous thing, he went to his parents’ bedroom. It was predictably wrenching. He stared at their bed in silence, bowled over by how much it hurt to grieve. And what was mad was that death was
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I’ve been talking to people. About the war. And just, I don’t know, talking more.”
Draco turned his head to look at him. His expression was puzzled, as if he was genuinely surprised at Harry’s stupidity.
Something was clutching in his throat. Draco had never mentioned that letter, never responded to it. No, he’d just kept it in his pocket. For months.
It occurred to Harry that he hadn’t really troubled to talk to Timothy about his prejudices. He had just forbidden them. He was silent as Timothy and Draco argued back and forth about blood purity and muggle culture. Draco was steady, patient.
Draco observed them for a moment. Cassie wore her most superior expression, and Teddy looked a little put out.
“I thought we’d broken up,” said Malfoy, when Harry finally cracked and booked another private session.
“Right,” he said. “Well, let’s not drag it out. I’ll ask Chief if we can switch duelling partners. I’m sure we can be civil to each other in class.”
Returning to Hogwarts had been about as unpleasant as he had thought it would be. Around Potter, people kept their distance. But they more than made up for it in the moments when Draco was alone.
Ginny seemed to be warring with herself. Harry kept his eyes fixed on her, trying to draw her out. Finally, she sighed.
Harry couldn’t tell if Draco was being glib, or if he meant it. If living with Harry had been a prison sentence, with Harry as gaoler.
“And if you told him about the curse, it would prevent him from falling in love with you naturally,” said Pansy.
“I didn’t think I’d get a chance to talk to you tonight,” said Harry, to try and cover the fact that his arm had goose pimples from Draco’s brief touch. “You’re very popular.”
Malfoy’s head was knocked sideways by the blow. His hand flew to his jaw and he opened and closed it a few times, tentatively.
There was a flash of blond hair behind the counter. Harry’s heart leapt up, and he pushed forward, carelessly knocking a few things off the shelves, only to realise that it wasn’t Malfoy after all. The boy behind the counter was younger, maybe nineteen, and his hair was darker than Malfoy’s. He was slight, and looked anxiously at the man who had entered the shop ahead of Harry.
“You weren’t there, either way. Why not give her someone noble to idolise? God knows she couldn’t look up to me.”
“You’re alive,” she said. Draco tried to sit up. The violent blood-thumping sensations in his head persuaded him that this was not a good idea.
“I love you,” he told Draco, that evening. Draco breathed out sharply and let his head fall forward so that their noses touched.
“I don’t want a house,” said Harry, but as he said it, he glanced up, and Draco spotted it: that same wistful look he had got the first time they saw the house. When Harry had pulled Draco aside from the estate agent and said, urgently,
“She’s the best lawyer in Britain,” said Harry. “And if you call her a mudblood and she quits, I’m not hiring another one.”
“I love you,” said Harry, and kissed him chastely on the lips. He pushed Draco towards the bed. “Now go to sleep.”
Draco turned on the lights. The room came into focus, sharply neat and elegant. It was like the cottage, but without any softening influences.
“Oh, yes, Harry Potter sir!” cried one, and then they all began crying it, and one of them unfurled a banner with Potter’s face on it, and Potter hastily pushed Draco out of the portrait-hole, following close behind.
“Draco did it,” said Harry, and he looked around him as if he was waking up. “He’s not a spy, Hermione.”
,” said Draco. “You should hear the fifth year girls in the Slytherin common room. The things they want to do to you…!”
“And, you know, I get it, I do. And you were angry. So… when you weren’t angry, in the Room of Requirement, or at the trials—what I mean is, it’s something I admire about you, actually.”
At the time, Harry had only noticed the kissing. Now, he could see that Malfoy’s face was set, determined.
It was like the incident when Harry had told Malfoy to stay in the house. Mostly Harry forgot about the bond, but Malfoy, clearly, could not.
Draco had never done it before, and he intended to show how careless he was, how this was just sex to him also, or maybe even just anger. But unfortunately, sucking Potter’s dick turned out to be a distinctly intimate thing, and Draco couldn’t help but do it slowly, carefully, as if it mattered to him. Which, obviously, it did.
Draco took a long time to respond, and he kept writing things then deleting them. Finally, he wrote,
Harry was so busy with Draco and Draco’s five thousand closest friends that he didn’t notice he hadn’t been quite so low lately until a bad day struck.
She did, indeed, look like a very ugly doll in the clothes Draco found for her. Possibly because they were, in fact, ugly old doll clothes.
Harry went to the dance floor and bopped about aimlessly. He wasn’t good at this. He knew he looked like an idiot when he danced. He couldn’t deny that the thought of going home with someone (
“I wasn’t going to,” said Draco. He clumsily pulled off his shoes and stripped down to his boxers. “I decided you didn’t mean it.”
He didn’t know it was true until he said it, but of course he couldn’t stay. The lilies; the curtains Harry had come with him to pick out, the silverware Draco had tracked down from an antique dealer because he was almost certain it had once been owned by Harry’s paternal grandmother.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Harry, standing up and catching Draco’s wrist. Draco’s gaze dropped to Harry’s hand.
“What? For telling me you hate my family? Don’t apologise on that account,” said Draco, aware that his voice sounded thin and unsteady. “You’re in very good company. Some of the finest people in Great Britain have wished me dead.”
“I’ve changed quite a bit, since school,” he said. He spoke lightly, as if the subject wasn’t of any importance to him. “Anyway. I’d better get going, I don’t want Adelaide to notice I was gone.”
When he got back to the flat, Adelaide had made creamy parmesan gnocchi with asparagus. It was his favourite.
He was right. The mist had shifted to reveal a glade, where Dean and maybe fifteen other people were dancing and singing and making out. Draco landed softly and removed the spells keeping Harry on the broom.
“He generally likes to play with his toys for a few days before he makes the kill,” said Bianca, “but we think he might move faster this time because he knows we’re getting close.”
“Okay?” asked Harry, into Draco’s ear. Draco nodded fervently, hoping that Harry would start kissing him again. Luckily, Harry did just that, and he didn’t stop as the students filed past them, hooting and whistling.
“—Dreadful coward, always have been,” said Draco, speaking almost as fast as he had that time Harry overheard him on cocaine. But Harry knew Draco was sober, knew he was just scared. “It’s one of my worst flaws, I think. Is that your first question?”
“Oh! Harry. Hello,” said Draco, running a hand through his hair, his eyes all over the place, looking as if he had expected to see anyone
Occasionally, there were evenings when none of the forbidden subjects came up, and Draco was able to be pleasant for hours at a time. But of course, Harry didn’t know what to avoid, and acted as if he was treading on eggshells.
“You’re the first person to think Bellatrix Lestrange is a funny burlesque name. So far it’s been a personal joke, just for my pleasure.”
“What the hell are you playing at, Malfoy, telling Scorpius that this is all fine and normal? That you deserve to be treated this way? You’re giving him a complex, you realise?”
Cassie and Malfoy both swivelled to look at him. Cassie may have had dark colouring, but her features were all Malfoy’s. They looked beautiful together. Their cheeks were flushed in exactly the same way. Harry remembered how Malfoy’s cheeks and ears would turn suddenly pink when he was angry. He wasn’t prepared for what it do to him to recognise that same trait in Cassie.
“Do you want to go somewhere more private?” he asked. Harry searched the crowd for Draco but couldn’t spot him.
“I know what you mean, Potter. It doesn’t make me uncomfortable. It fits, actually, you have fucking awful taste in clothes and fucking awful taste in men.”
“I take it you don’t want to go on a honeymoon?” asked Harry, the one time they successfully met up. If Draco’s eyes could have popped out of his skull, they would have.
“He was coughing up blood,” said Harry. “He said he didn’t have long.” He frowned. “He never got to go to Cairo. I rescued him from that fucking fire, I spoke for him at his trial, I thought he was safe, you know?”
Draco seemed to feel where Harry was looking. He quickly moved his left arm behind his back, hiding the Mark.
What he couldn’t work out was why Draco was such a dick about it whenever it came up. Nor why Draco seemed, if anything, more affectionate than before. He was constantly finding ways to lean against Harry, to touch him. The other day, Harry could have sworn Draco kissed his neck while hugging him goodnight.
Harry kept laughing for a while after Malfoy and his girlfriend had left, but he was conscious of something unpleasant growing in his chest. The idea of Malfoy having a girlfriend. The knowledge scraped at his heart, bitterly unfair.
“Yes, and who do you think had to pick up the pieces? You could turn out to be the world’s best father, but I’m never going to forget how you treated him.”
, for crying out loud, all about how family was the only thing that counted and Scorpius didn’t have any—”
“I know! He waved hello at me, took off his robe, and then I spent an hour painting his naked body!” Dean looked at Harry. “Was it you who gave him all those nasty scars, Harry?”
Harry filled up the water glass, but when he held it to Draco’s face, Draco sat up and took it in his own hands.
“Thanks,” Harry said. Draco nodded tersely. He didn’t speak throughout the class. Or any of the classes. Whenever Ron and Hermione paired up together, Harry would find Draco at his side, silent and taciturn. It didn’t seem as if Draco
, and every time, Draco nodded. It occurred to him that Potter might let Draco undress him, so he tried it, pulled at Potter’s t-shirt, and Potter obeyed his touch like a racing broom, instantly and effortlessly. Draco pulled the t-shirt over Potter’s head, splayed his fingers over Potter’s chest, touched the oval scar at his throat. Potter let him, his eyes wide.
“Why do you care so much about the bloody manor?” asked Mirth. “Isn’t it filled with traumatic memories now? You could sell it and buy a lovely new flat.”
“It’s… it’s very common for spies to sleep with the people they’re spying on,” said Hermione, slowly, as if she didn’t want to say it. “You know it is.”
His throat closed off. He blinked several times, gave a stiff bow, said, “Here all week,” and returned to the sofa.
Harry was too tired to answer. He took Draco’s hand in his and squeezed. Draco squeezed back, and Harry knew he understood.
, he would kill him. It was a certainty. Draco had a passing familiarity with existential dread, but the thought of dying usually held a hazy appeal. Not today. Today, he thought of it only with grim, teeth-clenched horror.
“Do I?” he asked, vaguely. He knew that used to be true, when he was younger. But then he took the Mark, and his life became so complicated and miserable that talking about it lost its charm.
He flung open the chest and rolled his eyes. No wonder Potter was so rumpled all the time. Why didn’t he hang his shirts in the wardrobe like a normal person—
“She’s run away,” he said. “I went to the Muggle police; they said she has to be missing for 48 hours? Before they’ll do anything? Fucking insane; and I can’t go to the Aurors because they’re about an inch away from taking her away from me, and maybe they
Harry was filled with pity and… disappointment. Draco didn’t know him well enough to fall for him. People fell in love with Harry all the time, because he had saved the world, but it had never occurred to him that Draco might fall prey to that. Then again, Draco had always been attracted to the powerful. Perhaps it wasn’t surprising that he wanted whatever Harry symbolised.
“Yeah!” said Harry, looking like the Harry that Draco remembered from school. Driven and determined, optimistic. “Have you done
“Oh?” asked Harry, adjusting the lettuce on his sandwich with focused care. “Does she not, usually?”
“And that’s what I always thought, when Draco and I were dating, and mum and dad would—you know, the hallucinations. I’d get back to Draco, and think, did your dad kill my parents? Your dad, who you still speak to? Did you know about it? Were you involved?”
“So,” said Draco. “When will I see you next? July? Or is that too soon? Have you room in your calendar for me before Christmas, do you think?”
“Did something happen?” he asked. “You both look grim. Or is that just what mornings feel like, when you’re old?”
Anger erupted in him like an explosion, wiping him out—a catastrophic, claustrophobic anger, that Draco didn’t
“There are advantages to a friendship with me. Granted, they’re largely aesthetic or economic, but they are advantages nonetheless. So, Harry, what brings you away from your busy schedule of saving the world?”
Malfoy nodded. Then he looked up, holding Harry’s gaze. His eyes were ambiguously grey, which struck Harry as symbolic.
But Malfoy was wrong. Cassie talked about him constantly. She told Harry elaborate stories from Wizarding history that Malfoy had taught her. She flicked rubber bands at Harry when he put his elbows on the table. (“That’s what Father does to me when I chew with my mouth open. He does it to people at restaurants, too. They never catch him.”) She never said anything exactly
said Draco, not giving Potter time to prepare. Potter was standing under some mistletoe. Cho Chang was crying as she kissed him. Potter burst into what looked like the Gryffindor common room and flung himself at Ginny Weasley. They kissed. Draco pulled out.
“You really are a prick,” he said. “He gave me seventy pounds and told me not to mention it so that you wouldn’t think he was doing it for attention.”
“No—I mean, because you’re a conniving, slippery bastard. You don’t want me to improve your standing in society. You just know that if I
“It’s been in my family since 1066,” said Draco. “Breunor Malfoy defended it from a magical siege led by Joan of Arc during the 100 Years War. Prince Rupert, the witch-prince of the Rhine, failed to burn it down during the English Civil War, because Elayne Malfoy performed sacrificial blood magic on the doorstep. Napoleon sent Spanish mages to infiltrate it in 1812, but Andromeda Malfoy seduced all six of them and turned the tide of the Napoleonic Wars. I can’t lose it because I want to play fucking
When he arrived at Grimmauld Place, Cassie sat at the kitchen table, bleary-eyed, as Kreacher made her a cup of hot chocolate.
“Yes,” said Scorpius. “Dad’s told me all about them. Well, more about your dad,” he said, turning back to Teddy, “because he had him as a teacher, of course. He said he was the best Defence teacher he ever had. Did you know that for their end of year exams, your dad made a sort of dark creature-obstacle course?”
It made it easier for him to bridge the gap between L and Malfoy in his mind. He started obsessing over the pensieve. He stole away between classes and watched their relationship unfold.
There was one loophole Draco could see, however. Steven had ordered him to look for dirt on Harry, but he had said nothing about how
“I know myself. But I can’t see how you would be happy if that’s what you were scared of. So like I said—I’m going to sleep with
“Has he ever mentioned how he got his…” he asked later, gesturing at his own face to demonstrate the scars.
sort of way. Draco dressed decently, but there was no way he could pretend he wasn’t trying. Which made days like today, when he looked like shit despite all his efforts, all the more depressing.
“Teddy doesn’t exactly have much family, Andromeda. Do you really think he’s going to thank you for keeping him from the few members he has left?”
“I’m twenty-seven!” said Harry. L (Malfoy) used to tell him to use face cream. He suddenly wished he had listened. “Anyway, what has that got to do with anything?”
“Oh, well, there’s acting and there’s acting,” said Draco cryptically. “Saying things you mean, and things you don’t.”
“Let’s dance first,” said Harry. Malfoy frowned again. He was still upset, maybe, thought Harry. It was hard to think. They made their way to the dance floor and Draco rested his arms on Harry’s shoulders, crossing his wrists behind Harry’s head. His eyes were glassy. Harry put his hands on Draco’s waist for the first time since he had briefly pretended to be Draco’s boyfriend at Eve’s wine and cheese party.
“He thinks he’s meting out justice,” he said, as they crept through an abandoned warehouse. “He tries to punish them in ways that reflect their own crimes.”
He wished he could take it back the moment he spoke the words. His father stood, went to the bar cart, and poured out two firewhiskies. He handed one to Draco.
For a few weeks, Harry and Draco were the hot gossip of the group, with Blaise ostentatiously telling anyone who would listen that he had known all along, and Harry blushing whenever anyone asked him about it. Draco was much better at spinning the narrative. He simply told extremely graphic bdsm sex stories when anyone asked him about Harry, until everyone learnt a) not to believe a word he said and b) to avoid asking him about it. His imagination was both vivid and disturbing.
Harry was silent, staring up at the sky. They had melted the snow off patches of grass and cast drying charms, but it was still freezing. Draco wondered what Harry was thinking. He could never tell.
Harry’s heart had sped up, although Harry wasn’t sure why. Maybe because it was such a generous interpretation of Harry’s loneliness.
“I didn’t have my wand,” said Draco. “He hadn’t searched me for anything else. He did a couple of cruciatus…es? Cruciati? What’s the plural of that?”
with sex, and with his body, and with talking to strangers. Even though he had clearly been acting all the way through, with his sickly sweet expressions and extravagantly loud orgasm, he had been
so far, and then it’ll be time for the show,” said Neville. “People who haven’t seen television before: it’s bloody weird but we’re all in it together.”
The next time he woke up gasping, he got out of bed and hesitated. He wasn’t even sure if Harry was awake. The explosion had been so vivid that he was still panting, and it was hard to listen for Harry’s breathing through his own panic.
“Seems to be yours,” said Potter, sounding almost envious. “I’ve been watching you. You can talk to anyone.”
“Very well. Mr. Malfoy, I must inform you that it is against my better judgment that you have been allowed to return to this school. Let me assure you that if I hear the smallest whisper of any wrongdoing on your part, you will be sent away immediately. And I don’t mean with Mr. Potter, I mean back to Azkaban. Do I make myself clear?”
Draco closed his eyes and sighed. When he opened them again, he looked determined but anxious, as if he had bad news to deliver. He was propped up on his elbows above Harry.
“He’s going to torture me into insanity, mother. Is there really any point in all this scheming? It all leads to the same place, doesn’t it? St Mungos?”
“I messed you up through your camming, now you can mess me up through mine, if you like. Wanted to give you the
“The court declares a brief recess,” said the judge. The murmuring that had begun at Harry’s outburst grew into a loud babble of excitement and outrage.
“No,” said Harry, automatically, then remembered that it was true. “I really don’t. Actually, if you’re anything to go by, I reckon he’s probably a pretty good egg.”
“Maybe he shouldn’t be seeing Teddy,” said Lamorak. “It’ll be upsetting for him when Draco dies. Rather selfish of him, really, to spend time with Teddy at all.”
“Oh,” he said. “One more thing. Not a big—but probably best you hear it from me. The wedding’s off. My wedding, with Clarence, I mean.”
“Yeah, all right,” he said. And Malfoy was right, it was a hundred times better now that he wasn’t thinking about how little he wanted Ginny, and what a betrayal it was, to have promised her forever when he could barely give her five years. Malfoy was unbelievably hot, and Harry came incredibly hard.
She was kind to him, he thought, as he kissed the top of her strange, hairless head. She was forgetting that just yesterday, he had snapped at her when she tried to help him set the table.
“Uh, his toad, I mean,” said Potter. It occurred to Draco that Potter would probably be an auror, after school, while Draco would continue to be a generally suspicious maybe-criminal. There was bound to be a lot more of this sort of nonsense in Draco’s future.
Hannah Abbott, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Michael Corner, Terry Boot (who was indeed handing out drugs, Draco had been right about that), practically everyone in the DA, every student from their year at Hogwarts, all smiling and wishing him a happy half birthday. But no Draco.
“I wanted to go hiking in the Peak District,” said Draco miserably. It was eleven in the morning and he hadn’t been able to get out of bed yet. His head pounded and his eyes were heavy.
“Of course. Why do you think I’d been put on duty with that man? They wanted me to prove my mettle. It was even more suspicious when he was painlessly killed, as well. I had to move all my plans up by several months; it was a fucking mess.”
Adelaide had a pretty good idea of what it was like to date a man, or at least, a certain type of man. But what Draco and Harry had wasn’t like that. She watched them, and thought,
“If you think you can’t ever forgive me, I can respect that,” said Harry. “But we’re dating. Aren’t we? I mean. We live together.”
Harry used his wand to spell himself clean, because, why not. When he looked up, Draco was watching him hungrily.
“I’m doing my best, all right? The situation isn't great for me, either. You think I'm happy about missing the first ten years of my daughter's life? And for your information, I
“Really, you eighth years are out of the loop,” said Ginny. “Everyone knows that. Steven practically put out an advert in the papers.”
Draco smiled and nuzzled his face into Harry’s shirt. Harry caressed the long, straight line of his nose, the pale curve of his eyelids.
“I love you too,” said Draco. “So much.” He pressed his fingers so tightly against Harry’s skin that it hurt. “
He dropped his hand to his side. Harry came to stand by him, and rested his head gently against Draco’s shoulder.
But Draco didn’t see. He had closed his eyes, leaning his head against the wall and bringing his knees to his chest.
It was surreal, sitting on a stoop with Harry Potter, talking about ancient Greek thought experiments, but so much about the past few years had been surreal that Draco didn’t even bother fighting it.
“I miss that Draco, when he’s not around,” said Harry. “Because he’s sort of one of my closest friends.”
“Just come have a coffee,” said Andromeda gently. She took Malfoy’s arm and led him down the stairs. Harry followed, trying to feel triumphant. It was harder than expected, because Malfoy looked so thin and miserable, the way he had at his trial.
There was very little Draco liked more than giving Harry sartorial advice. But Harry had only really asked because he thought it might soothe Draco, and when it became apparent that it wouldn’t, he just threw on an old jumper and some jeans.
“Do you have to fix the curse? He’s a lot better like this,” said Ron. He scratched the kitten behind his ears, and the kitten stretched languorously.
When Draco woke up, Ginny was still in his arms, Harry was asleep in the chair next to his bed, and Ron was staring at Draco in abject horror.
Harry lowered his hands again. Draco had said he could. Harry was visited, briefly, by the memory of Draco calling Hermione a mudblood in second year. Inexplicably, the thought made him press Draco a little closer.
“You miss your job,” said Harry, realisation dawning on him. Draco’s expression closed, and he put his cup down.
“Just want to check everything’s in order,” said Harry, because no matter how much Ron and Hermione told him that Malfoy had changed, Harry couldn’t shake the idea that Malfoy was probably trying to scam him out of money.
“All right,” he said. “So you really did fall for me. You also sought me out with the deliberate intention to humiliate me. You deceived me for months. You abandoned me with fucking
Such a slow kiss. It was like flying too fast, knowing you had lost control of the broom and were about to fall. Draco’s hand went to Harry’s jaw, and Harry heard himself make a little noise. He pressed Draco closer, his hands flat on Draco’s back, and he could feel how hard Draco was.
Harry had been anxiously downing drinks for an hour by the time Draco showed up, looking aggressively handsome. The kind of handsome that meant he was trying. Harry had lived with Draco, knew how Draco dressed and styled his hair when he was eager to please. The moment he caught Harry’s eye, he lit up, his face becoming soft and sweet. He waved. It looked nervous, as if he thought Harry wouldn’t wave back, and when Harry did, he smiled even wider.
Harry tried not to show his relief. The idea that Neville was off the market was deeply reassuring, although he knew it would wound Draco.
Draco didn’t answer for ten minutes. When he did, it was with a picture of a kitten cuddling several birds.
“God,” said Draco, sinking to the sofa and— and leaning back into Harry’s chest. Casually. As if they had been dating for years, and it was simply the way he sought comfort. “I’ve had such a rotten day.”
together on the phone. As Harry had predicted, Draco grew calmer. Harry fell asleep after an hour. When he woke up, Draco had hung up long ago, but there was a single text from him:
“No, I mean, he’s just a quite an anxious person,” said Blaise. “And I told him that you were pranking him with your letters, and he—”
think you were handsome,” he said into Draco’s throat. Draco breathed a laugh. “Sorry,” added Harry. “That probably wasn’t the most important part of the story.”
A week later, Harry brought him a bunch of daffodils, because they were the first ones he’d seen that season.
Lamorak cast him a glance that Harry could have sworn was flirtatious before slipping away into the crowd. Why had he paused for so long before saying he was straight, wondered Harry? And surely it wasn’t normal for a straight guy to look at your lips so much?
“As an earthquake. Goodnight, all,” said Blaise, and disapperated, which was both rude, and proof of his (in Harry’s opinion) sinister sobriety.
An awful silence fell as they all avoided looking at each other, except for Teddy, who Harry noticed was flicking peas at Scorpius. Scorpius glanced up when one hit his face, looking hurt, but his expression changed when Teddy winked at him.
“Get out of this manky broom cupboard, you terminal wanker,” said Pansy, and he loved her so much that he nearly panicked again. But there wasn’t time to panic—only six months—so instead he opened the cupboard door, called her a stupid bint, and took her out to get plastered.
“That also makes sense,” said Hermione, nodding. “Could be a form of insecurity. He doesn’t think he deserves someone who would treat him nicely, that sort of thing.”
The effect of the potion was immediate and remarkable. Within the hour, the lilies were back to their former, resplendent glory.
Draco’s body was hot all up and down, even though he clutched the duvet to his chest. He snuggled close to Harry to read
“I do, actually,” said Harry lightly. “I know that you hold yourself to impossibly high standards, and that you’re considerate in slightly manipulative ways, and that I’ve spent the last six or so months falling in love with you.”
“You sound defensive,” said Draco, who was starting to enjoy himself. “I can’t believe you wanted to snog my mother.”
Adelaide went into her bedroom when they got home, and Draco straddled Harry on the sofa, alternated between kissing Harry’s collar bones and starting guiltily away whenever he thought he heard a sound.
Draco wasn’t going to follow his mother’s advice. But Harry was so embarrassed. He had to give him something.
“Harry, I’m so swamped, I’m not sure I can focus on anything but the election—and you know I can’t keep him safe, if someone—”
But it was worse, because she was not Harry. Worse, because he would never get Harry again. Worse, because someone else would get Harry. Someone who deserved him.
“Fine. Whatever,” said Harry. “But you’ll back me up if I suggest this to him? The whole marriage thing?”
“You should let him, by the way, he’s an excellent writer. And he’d do a better job than Eloise Midgen.”
It occurred to Harry that Malfoy might have thought he was trying to talk Eve out of her friendship with him. The thought made his stomach churn.
“I assumed—” said Draco, and Harry wondered what, exactly, he had assumed. That Harry couldn’t possibly want to talk to him alone?
“Do the heroin addicts look down on you?” asked Draco. Adelaide’s face changed. It became old. It was funny that of everything, it was this that aged her.
It was absolutely tiny, with almost no furniture. Everything was spartan and so neat that the effect was vaguely hostile. It was clear that the only thing that kept the flat from squalor was the aggression with which its occupants attacked clutter and dirt. Cassie’s bedroom was only a little bigger than Harry’s childhood cupboard, and about as dark. Draco’s bedroom was not much better. Harry searched through the flat diligently, keenly aware that he liked having an opportunity to learn more about Cassie’s life, even though he knew he was invading her privacy.
Harry didn’t answer. He turned away. Malfoy followed him inside and shut the door with a quiet click.
Draco came towards him. Harry licked his finger and tried to get the icing out of Draco’s eyebrow with it.
“He wasn’t,” said Harry. “I was wrong, I misunderstood.” But he couldn’t explain any further. He couldn’t think, let alone speak. He only saw, over and over, Draco’s face, looking at him, saying
“From what I’ve gathered,” said Hermione placatingly, “Malfoy is a devoted father. He talks about you all the time.”
“You’ve always been loyal, Tasha,” said Draco. “I appreciate it. But Adelaide might be in danger. Her safety’s more important than any promises you made her.”
know more about it, but it hardly made a difference. There was a whole world of people who thought Malfoy had got off lightly, and any one of them might have broken into his flat to ensure that he received the punishment he deserved.
“Shall I get down on my knees?” Draco spoke in a low voice, almost too embarrassed to say the words, even though he knew Potter wasn’t going to take him up on it. “Is… is that what you want me for?”
“I think because, with cutting humour, you have to trust that the person making the jokes isn’t a dick.”
Draco grit his teeth, trying to avoid the compulsion, but the pain burnt through his veins. He knew it would build up to a full blown crucio within seconds.
Draco looked away from them, towards the Gryffindor table. Potter was buttering a slice of toast with sure, strong fingers. His hair was exactly the same as it had always been, jet-black and scruffy. He glanced up at Draco, and Draco looked quickly away.
“Boys,” said Padma, dismissively. She glanced at Draco and sighed again. “I wish he wasn’t with Astoria.”
“I’ve been meaning to ask,” said Astoria, at breakfast. “Are you taking Harry up on his offer of a quidditch career?”
But he knew what would happen. There would be questions, limitless questions, and arguments he wouldn’t be able to get out of, and Ron would be furious, and Seamus would smile coldly and not mention Dean Thomas, and then it would spread among their friend group; fuck,
Had Harry been concealing his nightmares from Draco? Sinking into a depression without Draco noticing? Draco knew how self-involved he could be, but he had been working on it. He thought he’d improved. But was he the same selfish person he’d always been?
“Yeah,” said Harry. He leant back into his pillows. He hadn’t talked about Cedric in a long time. There had been so many fresher, closer tragedies to process. But it felt good to talk about him. Like exploring a wound in his mouth with his tongue. “He wanted me to take the cup by myself. Said I’d won it. I insisted we take it together.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. And then, twenty minutes later, when he remembered the rules of conversations, “Work going well for you?”
Harry and Draco were in the sitting room, watching television. Draco was curled against Harry’s chest. He didn’t move when Adelaide walked in, only stretched idly, happy to see her.
He looked so fragile. It was all Harry could do not to pour himself around him, to kiss his eyelids shut, to tell him that it would all be okay.
Harry was filled with a growing sense of horror. For the first time, the full meaning of his behaviour dawned on him. Draco loved him. Draco trusted him. Draco lived a life in exile, unloved and unwanted, and trusted no one, and Harry had forced his way through his defences; made Draco reliant on him.
“Christmas I was seven,” mumbled Draco. “Got my first broomstick. Flew it around the living room, fell off, hit my face on the coffee table. It was brilliant. Flying.”
“Draco,” said Harry quietly. Draco made a small sound to show he was listening. “I’m really grateful to you for all your help.”
Unfortunately, he was not able to keep his thoughts to himself the whole afternoon. After an hour of traipsing through the WWII exhibit, they ended up at the museum cafe.
“No one’s trying to kill me,” said Harry. “I’ll write as many essays as they want. I have the time.”
Harry laughed again, his eyes crinkling around the edges. He was wearing a soft old t-shirt, and Draco could make out a slim vein running down his brown forearm.
“I haven’t done… they’re coming,” said Draco. “They’ve been informed.” He felt light-headed. Had he eaten that day? Maybe not. He had a habit of pushing meals later and later, until he was too tired to eat and just went to bed.
“Thanks,” he said, then took a deep breath and walked into the sitting room. “Unfortunately, I do still need to ask you for money.”
“It’s important to understand the theory before you try something dangerous,” said Draco, not looking up. He had finished scribbling, but kept his hand cupped over the paper napkin, staring at words he had written.
his mother had said. “But I understand if this isn’t working out for you. It’s up to you, of course.”
“I’m not talking, like, school bully stuff, by the way. Although he was that, too. I mean the guy was
“Goodnight, Harry,” said Ron, disappearing into the chimney. The green burst of the floo made Harry wince. He didn’t like people using floo powder around him anymore. It was too vivid. Everything was a bit too vivid, since May. Oversaturated. That was why drinking helped; it calmed the colours down.
Harry quickly changed the subject. Whenever he remembered Malfoy’s past, it was harder for him to make his peace with everything.
Afterwards, Draco turned off the lights and spelled them clean. He curled around Harry. They were both naked, now, and Draco’s skin was hot and lightly damp against Harry's back.
“I think he really thought about each person he was apologising to, and what he had done to them,” said Hermione. “He just… misjudged the tone.”
“Has it occurred to you that Teddy won’t benefit socially from being seen with Scorpius? He’s your godson. You should be looking out for
Harry knew that Draco could get anyone he wanted. It was something Harry maybe resented a bit, when he was honest with himself—the degree to which everyone seemed willing to let old sins go. He thought Draco deserved to be forgiven, or at least for his change to be accepted, but it felt as if forgiveness had happened so easily. As if it was less of a choice than a surrender. It was too difficult to decide what people deserved after the war, so a decision had simply and quickly been made, and stuck to.
“Let’s go to my room,” he said. Harry looked curiously at the closed door, and Draco sighed. “They’re playing Hunt the King.”
“It’s really fine, Harry,” he said. Harry jerked around to look at him. Draco smiled, and Potter managed to smile back.
Those words together made strange things stir in Harry. The idea of Malfoy being connected to people Harry loved. It was confusing.
The fight they had was about Ron, when Draco made some off-hand remark about the Weasleys being poor. Harry blew up, and the more he ranted about Draco being a snob, the colder and more distant Draco grew.
“Look, can we just do the transactional thing first? It’s crap, the way we’ve been doing it,” said Draco.
"Harry pulled his Saviour of the Wizarding World card. He seems to do that a lot when you're involved, Draco."
“I don’t want— I want— I don’t want to be with someone who’s going to leave!” said Draco. “I don’t want to go through this again; I
“Oh.” Draco looked at the thermos, unable to hide the glint he always got in his eyes when given something new. “Thank you."
“But there was one thing I was wondering about,” said Harry. “See, I’m madly, head over heels in love with you, and I know you quite fancy me, but are you up for being my boyfriend? Or would you rather keep things casual? Because I don’t want to pressure you—”
“You should teach me, instead of Draco,” Adelaide told Harry, after Draco had refused point blank to be stunned another time.
Harry looked up, too. The pale blue was faintly tinged with pink, like a blush spreading into the corners of the afternoon.
To his surprise, Draco found he did remember. Wanky Franky was an unfortunate fifth year who was a bit weird. His doom had been sealed when someone declared that he always smelled as if he’d just had a wank.
“And he’s famous! And he wanted me! You’re just fucking jealous and sad because no one ever wants to sleep with you, it’s pathetic!”
It was funny, but “I don’t want to talk about it” seemed like immense progress from just changing the subject. It happened several times, over the next few weeks.
In the Easter holidays, Draco’s sentence was officially ended and his assets returned to him. The first thing he did was go to Diagon Alley with Ginny. Harry didn’t even ask to go with them. The more time Draco spent with Ginny and Luna, the steadier he became; the less prone to unpredictable bouts of silent gloom.
Sometimes this happened. Usually Harry gave notice, but then again, Harry was nothing if not spontaneous, and that was at least a third of the reason Draco loved him. Draco drew himself a bath, read a book, and went to bed.
But although Adelaide had been a shock, Draco explained it away. There was no one else in his life, and so the idea that there was anything wrong with Tertius was too catastrophic for Draco to contemplate. He focused on the way Tertius doted on Adelaide, on the gifts he bought her, the way she watched Tertius, as if he was the whole world. Age was just a number, Draco told himself. True love should know no impediment. He could sense the excuses were flimsy. But there was no one else, and Tertius was generous to Draco. “Blood is thicker than water,” he said, and acted as if it was only natural that he should come out of nowhere and rescue Draco from the streets.
They were still for an eternal three seconds, resting their heads together, before the restlessness came upon them again, and they took off together, flying back towards the great stone castle.
, he thought, in an attempt to make himself laugh. It wasn’t particularly funny. He thrust the wooden beam into place, cast the stabilising spells, then stepped back. He looked at his Mark and imagined how it must have looked to Potter. Like the warning symbols on muggle cigarette packets:
“Yeah,” said Harry. “That’s right. And right now, I order you go find more firewhisky. There must be somewhere that’s still open.”
Harry hadn’t seen Draco yet. Ron sat on Hermione’s lap, and she needed the loo and kept giggling and saying “Stop,
“Well,” said Draco, trying to be light, but still watching Harry intently. “Hate sex, you know. It’s its own thing.”
approach to well-being. Draco had only learned about alcoholism from a pamphlet he had once spent twenty minutes loudly mocking in Kevin’s office, then surreptitiously taken home.
“Look, the point is, I should have… I don’t know, I should have… Whoever cursed him did it because of the war—I spoke at his trial, you know. He’s a prick, but he isn’t
“I miss it too. The vividness. But just because we were young during a war doesn’t mean war was responsible for everything that was lovely about our youth.”
“That’s what Father says. Old habits die hard, I suppose. He wants me to build some kind of muggle drag empire.”
“Adelaide. Is this a story about a person making a mistake in their youth and it ruining the rest of their life?”
One day, Draco couldn’t find bananas in the shop, and he shouted at the blank-eyed teenager at the till, and walked a mile to the next shop, a Muggle one. He didn’t have any Muggle money. He begged a nice middle-aged woman to buy them for him, making up a pregnant girlfriend with a potassium craving. The woman clearly didn’t believe him, but she bought the bananas all the same. Draco was astonished, both by the lengths to which he had been willing to go to avoid Tertius’ ill-humour, and by the kindness of that Muggle woman, who a few years ago Draco might glibly have wished death upon.
“So that’s it?” said Harry. “We’re all just doomed to be trapped in shitty relationships if we didn’t have the foresight to fall in love in fucking fourth year like you two?”
To Draco’s very great relief, the woman who took Adelaide to her dorm was… cool. She was pretty, not much older than Draco, and had tattoos on her hands. Draco could see Adelaide deciding not to hate her.
“It—yeah. More or less.” Draco had gone home and spent hours on his computer, researching carbon emissions. But he hadn’t come up with any grandiose and self-sacrificial plans, so he counted that as a win.
sorts of other ways I can show my gratitude,” said Timothy, putting his hand on Harry’s. Harry shook it off, and Timothy leant backwards in his chair. “I don’t want to tell you the gang names. You can force me to, if you want.” He balanced his chair on its two back legs. “You could threaten to throw me out if I don’t tell. You could drug me with Veritaserum. You could beat me up. Mr. Croome never forced me to do anything, but you can force me to tell, if that’s the kind of person you are.”
“Well, it was just a thought.” Nick sighed. “Fuck, he would be so pissed off if he knew I was talking to you about this. He was really nervous about us meeting you.”
Malfoy got unsteadily to his feet. He seemed to be scanning Harry for a reaction, as if he didn’t know what to expect.
“Is it okay?” asked Harry. “You hate it. We can change it. Millie and I have been working with a Charms expert to get everything done on time. But he can change anything you don’t like. Or you can go back to your old room. But look, there’s a trundle bed for when your mother stays—it’s really comfortable, I tried it— and there’s space for everyone to visit you comfortably, and—”
Harry leant his head into Draco’s and laughed too, a quiet, breathy laugh that went tingling through Draco.
me to be nice to him,” Draco told his mother. Potter was prowling around downstairs, and Draco hadn’t emerged yet that morning. When he woke up, his mother was sitting calmly at the edge of the bed.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I know he’s been a bit under the weather recently. Everyone’s bloody ill. Did you hear that Draco Malfoy is
He had started thinking more and more about Easter, when Draco’s sentence would officially be lifted. Once he was no longer legally responsible for Draco’s actions, might Draco consider…?
He was sentenced to a year’s limited magic and given a hefty fine. Beyond that, he was free. He stood blinking in the docket as the verdict was read out, and did not look at Harry once. Harry wasn’t really sure why that bothered him so much.
He was seeing a lot more of Ron, which was also because of Malfoy. A few days after they had gone to the pub together, Harry went to Malfoy’s and found Ron already there.
“Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you must have put that on by mistake. I’m afraid I’ve banished it, what a shame.”
Harry pulled her into his arms. She was stiff at first, but then she relaxed quite suddenly into him, and he sat with her on the sofa, holding her close. He couldn’t reassure her, couldn’t tell her that he trusted Malfoy when he didn’t. Draco. He suddenly imagined someone calling Cassie “Malfoy” with all the vitriol he used to throw at Draco and felt deeply saddened.
Although, of course, it was more complicated than that. There was a reason Draco hadn’t kissed Harry, despite the fact that he knew Harry wouldn’t pull away. Once Harry had had him, Draco would become loathsome to him again. However sweet the fruit, it couldn’t possibly be worth such a bitter aftertaste.
Michael Corner and Susan Bones were delighted to see him. Harry always forgot that anyone who had been in the DA thought of him as a friend. They didn’t question why he was there; it seemed natural to them.
,” and by the time Draco came home the three of them were so completely entangled on the sofa that Harry couldn’t move.
“You know where Draco is,” said the woman, and as she spoke she leant into their table, so that light fell across her face. Her small, pug-like face. It was Pansy Parkinson.
“I don’t know, was it?” asked Draco, his voice rising wildly. “I don’t even know, maybe it was about right, I don’t know… God, I

Potter turned his head away. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. Draco watched it in fascination.
been?” asked Harry. The question seemed to surprise Pansy so much that she forgot to look at him as if he was a piece of shit.
Astoria frowned, the delicate crease between her brows only highlighting her smooth skin. She was very beautiful. Draco knew he couldn’t marry her, but he also knew that not marrying her was accepting a life of loneliness.
Slowly, the real world came trickling back to him, in drops of understanding, at first, and then in a deluge. He was
“Is it like it was?” asked Harry once, as they lay in bed, after sex. The bed they had bought together years ago, the bed where they had spent their wedding night, where Draco had cried when Harry went missing, where Harry had slept when they got divorced.
“Ah,” said Draco. “There is, yes. Sort of. Not really? Harry Potter has to tell me he loves me, and mean it.”
“Oh, you mean like my father was, as a child?” asked Cassie. “Before he became a Death Eater and lost everything?”
“So—he can come on Saturday? Just so that you can—so you can see that he’s—and if you still don’t trust him then that’s fine, like I said, I don’t want to make things difficult for you, I’m so happy you’re back.”
“I learned from the best,” said Draco. Across the hall, Harry had rolled up his sleeves. It was distracting, knowing that the skin on Harry’s lean, pure forearms was the softest part of his body. Fuck, Draco
“Malfoy,” he said, confused, probably because Draco was smiling at him: Potter. The Saviour of the Wizarding World. Why on earth had Draco never thought of it? How could he have been so stupid? Of
“You must hate that I’m back,” said Adelaide. Draco smiled at her as if she had just said something very clever.
“Ohhkay, let’s get you a glass of water,” said Harry, gently guiding Draco back into the kitchen. Draco fell into a chair next to Cassie.
“Poor Harry,” said Pansy, and she ran a hand through Harry’s hair. Harry closed his eyes and thought, idly, of Draco. Of Draco holding him and calling him a poor, sorrowful thing.
“I don’t know, it just might have made him feel a bit worthless and confused, so just don’t, you know, don’t fuck him around, because he might find it really hard to deal with.”
Next to him, Draco rolled his sleeves back down, nodding to himself as if he had just won an argument.
“It’s a date,” said Draco. “Watch out, Potter, I’m extremely—” he coughed up more blood— “seductive.”
Draco finally managed to jerk his hands away and buried his face in them. Harry was seized by a sudden uncertainty.
Harry tried to talk to Draco about quidditch, but Draco didn’t seem to know he was there. Pansy tried lowering the dose. Draco’s eyes went from vacant to agonised with no period of lucidity. He howled for his mother, not seeming to understand that Narcissa was next to him, holding his hand, her silent, icy tears coursing down her pale cheeks.
“Yeah,” said Potter. “I guess what I’m getting at is that you can tell me, if she’s the one who told you the story.”
“And when I come out, we’ll get Shark,” said Adelaide. Shark was to be their dog. Adelaide had announced it at breakfast, that first morning after Sam.
“Has he been drinking lately?” asked Hermione, at lunchtime on the first day Harry had not come home.
They kept touching each other. Little gestures, at first— Draco tapped Harry’s arm to get his attention. Harry brushed a strand of Draco’s hair out of his eyes when he fell asleep. Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder when Hermione came to visit, and talked about the Reconciliation Act for forty-five minutes without pausing for breath. (It had been hard for Draco to see Hermione again, anyway. He did not apologise to her—Harry noticed that he rarely apologised to anyone for his role in the war; Harry suspected because he did not want to be forgiven—but he blanked out several times when she first arrived, and was so polite that he made everyone uncomfortable.)
Harry left to fetch Draco a cup of tea. When he returned, Bianca was gritting her teeth, and Draco was still talking about grammar.
And, in truth, Draco had felt the keen desire to kill himself less frequently, since Hermione first suggested they all become animagi. It still fell upon him from time to time—heavy weariness that seemed to lead to one inevitable solution—but less, less.
Narcissa repeatedly warned Draco that no one would ever love him. Which meant, Harry realised, that Draco told himself that, over and over again.
“He was a few years older than me. Really funny. Good at quidditch, too. We—we used to fly together,” and suddenly Marcus was crying. It was so quick that by the time Harry reached him, the tears had stopped.
to know what to say. I’ve been—I don't think I’ve had a single thought since I first read it, an hour ago. I think my head froze,” he said.
“I know. Or the ministry would give you a safe house, until they find the people who did this to you.”
When was the last time someone had touched Draco gently? Tertius, of course, in his softer moments—but that touch was laced with fear, and Draco wasn’t frightened of Potter. Far from it: he felt safe, secure. Potter had rescued him from the Fiendfire. Potter had spoken for him at his trial. Potter had given him a chocolate frog, in prison. Potter would take care of him.
They ate lunch on the floor of the sitting room and went for a walk in the afternoon. Draco had his hands in his pockets and told Harry stories about Lucius. It was hard, but Harry managed to stay silent throughout. He knew that Draco didn’t need to be reminded that his father was a bastard.
“You’re doing all right,” said Draco, with a kind smile. It was shocking and wonderful that it didn’t look out of place. That Draco had grown up to be someone kindness suited, that Harry had been allowed to witness the change.
“No, no,” said Draco, who by this point seemed almost delirious, “no I’m glad you—take accusations seriously, I don’t mind, whatever you need.” He was speaking only to Nancy. He wouldn’t look at Harry.
There was a pause. Draco used it to swallow, hard, several times, until the lump in his throat was gone. He suspected Pansy was doing the same.
“Ha. No,” said Draco. “Neville and I got back together. Would you fetch the rum out of the liquor cabinet?”
He and Harry didn’t get much of a chance to talk that day. Mainly because of how thoroughly Draco avoided him. Not for nothing had Draco spent two summers with Old Tom as a housemate.
It was a cold, wet evening, and Harry was exhausted in the particularly headachy way that he knew only came from too many hours of paper work. He apparated outside Grimmauld Place, already mentally pouring himself a glass of red wine and trying to shed the strains of the day.
“Remember—you must brave—humble—not cowed, but not arrogant—brave—stoic—remember—no one will love you if—be brave—”
“Seems a bit sad, doesn’t it?” said Ron, itching his nose with his quill. “I’d invite him to the Burrow, but I reckon it’s too soon, what with Fred, and Bill.”
But it hadn’t been. That was the problem. Harry Potter was allowed to fuck a Death Eater, that was probably appropriate, even. Shag the enemy into submission.
Draco could see Ron transforming into Auror Weasley. It was always alarming to witness. His face hardened, and he took out a quill and some parchment.
“Why does anyone want anything?” He looked away, then nodded slightly to himself. When he looked back, he wore an expression Harry had never seen on him before. It made Harry uncomfortable, because it was so fake, so out of place.
He talked about the Dursleys, about how he still had trouble identifying hunger pangs because he had become so immune to them growing up. He talked about the cupboard, and relating to that boa constrictor in the zoo (Malfoy laughed when Harry told him about setting the boa free). He talked about his horrible second year summer.
Harry and L had been instantly drawn to each other. The first day Harry moved into his dorm, L knocked on his door and asked if he wanted a cup of tea. Compared to the other recruits, he had been calm, measured. Harry had been soothed by his company. Their friendship had kindled at once, the sort of friendship where they sat together at every meal, and paired up together for duels, and stopped trying to make friends with anyone else, because they had found each other.
“…so…” said Draco, after about fifteen minutes, because he sensed he was talking in circles. “So you see, it’s—I know, I can
“You’re suggesting that when he’s on an adrenaline rush, he lets himself behave the way he secretly wants to?”
Sometimes, he was annoying about it. Sometimes, he wanted her to talk about it when she just didn’t want to. But mostly it was this: him asking her to
Harry’s office bedroom door opened and Malfoy came across the room to kneel in front of Hermione’s chair.
“That’s most depressing fucking thing I’ve ever heard,” said Adelaide. Draco did move away then, coward that he was. He shifted her gently off his lap and passed her the cup of tea. She said
“I thought we could discuss the wedding, maybe,” said Harry, because he could see that Cassie and Draco were gearing up for a lengthy exchange of insults.
“I’m willing to get hurt for you, L,” he said. Draco stood still as Harry stroked his pale eyebrows. “But I understand why you aren’t. So if you don’t want… this… then.”
They went back to Harry’s bedroom, and were silent as Harry gave Draco a pair of boxers and a t-shirt and got dressed himself. When he was done, he found Draco sitting, knees to chest, at the foot of the bed, his back against the carved bed post. Harry propped himself up against his pillows, facing Draco.
All the sympathy Harry had felt for Draco had merged with the empathy he felt for Lamorak, and now he was filled with the deepest urge to protect, to
“Me too!” He buried his face in his pillow. “Remember that time I was a Death Eater and almost murdered three people?”
Draco laughed. It was sort of a real laugh—more real than the MDMA laugh had been, anyway, except that the cadence was off; it trilled a little too fast, like the heartbeat of a small bird.
“We could…” said Harry hesitantly. “We could stay at the castle for Christmas. One last Hogwarts Christmas.”
“Thanks,” said Draco, with a quiet laugh that made Harry feel something warm in his chest. Draco and Ginny. Getting along.
“Quarter of a million galleons,” said Draco proudly. “Enough to add a new wing to the war orphanage. Have you been?”
“Florence,” said Draco, tapping his fingers against his leg. “I wanted to see Botticelli’s Primavera.”
“Disgusting Sweaty Tim asked me out on a date!” she continued, barrelling into Draco’s bedroom. “Oh,” she said. “Potter.”
“Because you said you embarrassed yourself,” said Draco, adding the “you said” in an effort to spare Harry’s feelings. It was too cruel to tell Harry that
. You’re invisible, in retail. Until someone wants something from you, and then, as you can imagine, I would very maturely stop breathing.”
Harry reminded himself. But then he remembered being high and finding Draco smoking out of a window and noticing that Draco looked for an empty bin to throw the stub away, and he wondered if maybe he had fallen for Draco Malfoy because he didn’t litter.
Potter crouched and put the chocolate frog just outside Draco’s cell door. Draco would be able to slip his hand through the bars and fetch it. Draco was conscious that he hadn’t washed his hair in five days, and that Potter looked like he worked out.
At first, Harry had been annoyed by Malfoy’s relationship with Kreacher. It reminded him of how Kreacher and Narcissa Malfoy had conspired against Sirius in fifth year. But he quickly realised that Malfoy had known Kreacher all his life, and it was obvious that the wizened old elf really loved him. There probably weren’t many people left about whom that could be said. Harry stopped feeling irked by how well they got on, and started feeling sad, instead.
“Said he didn’t believe I was actually going to get clean. Said I always said that. Said it didn’t make a difference.”
Harry wondered if Draco Malfoy was thinking about him half as much as he was thinking about Draco Malfoy.
cute,” said Ginny, pointing with her chin at a petite brunette on the dance floor. “For me, not for you.”
Mrs Weasley had taken a while to warm up to Draco. In fact, it wasn’t really until she met Scorpius that she understood why Harry had married Draco in the first place. This was often the case, Harry had discovered. It was hard not to love Draco, once you knew Scorpius, even though Scorpius was being a right moody prat these days and rebelled against literally anything Draco said. Unless Draco and Harry had a fight. Then Scorpius would aggressively freeze Harry out, to demonstrate where his loyalties lay. Harry was a Malfoy now (Draco had been horrified when Harry had insisted on taking his name, but to Harry it was a no brainer. He had always longed to be part of a family; and the Malfoys were too firmly Malfoys to become Potters), but ultimately it was still Draco and Scorpius against the world.
Harry supposed it made sense. Cassie doubtlessly suffered from being a Malfoy. Malfoy probably thought it would do her good to be photographed in the papers with Harry Potter from time to time.
“You don’t have to hide your arm,” said Harry, the second time it happened. Malfoy shrugged, changed the subject, and continued to wear the tie on his left forearm.
Thank you to Tepre for that lengthy chat about midway through that really solidified my ideas; I'm very sorry there aren't more cats. I headcanon that Harry starts wearing the cat collar sometimes as he becomes more relaxed and sometimes he and Draco just spend a cat evening together where Draco strokes him as he reads. And like it's not a coping mechanism, it's just pleasant. Draco is too aware of his tendency to use it as a crutch to use the collar anymore, but cat!Harry is just a nice part of their relationship.
Draco smiled, too. He looked just how Harry felt: nervous, polite, tired. He ran a hand through his dirty hair.
Thus, Klaus, who had been a perfectly agreeable sexual partner, if you didn’t mind dizzying loneliness.
“Maybe,” she said. “You’re the only Slytherin in your year who’s returned. I thought you might feel a bit strange.”
Harry, Ron and Malfoy got there early. Malfoy was dressed rather severely, with his hair slicked back. He was wearing a tie. He barely spoke as Harry ordered them a round of drinks. He had picked up one of the cardboard coasters and was turning it over in his hands, his eyes fixed on the door. Harry could feel him trembling next to him.
Draco’s mind wasn’t plastic enough anymore to defend himself against accusations. If Potter thought he had behaved badly, he probably had.
Draco obeyed. He stood by the sink and looked at his reflection. He thought how strange it was that he could once have been so loved, so prized.
“He was homeschooled by his mother when he was my age, so he’s worried I’ll be a dunce when I get to Hogwarts.”
Astoria sized him up with flinty eyes. It was obvious that she did not like what she saw. She moved slightly to Draco’s side so that she was no longer blocking him from view and took his empty mug from him.
“We were drunk,” said Draco. If he had sounded bored or casual, Harry would have known he was hurt. But Draco’s eyes were soft, concerned. It was as if he knew what Harry was thinking.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut and turned away. When he opened them, Draco was halfway down the stairs.
“Fuck ‘em,” mumbled Harry. He pressed a lazy kiss onto the nearest part of Draco he could reach, which was his collarbone, and Draco momentarily stopped wriggling.
