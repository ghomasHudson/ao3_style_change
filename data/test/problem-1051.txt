theories back to their Common Room. It was all going well, when his stomach grumbled again, louder than the first sound it made from the library.
and I never liked attention - in fact, I appreciate being left alone. And stop with the gay thing because I
Draco groaned and Harry closed his eyes again, curling inwardly to keep warm, attempting to sleep. He was used to this. The cupboard he slept in for eleven years was smaller than this room. Draco didn’t complain anymore, or at least Harry's tired-induced body said he should ignore whatever Draco was complaining about. He remained still for many minutes and instinctively rolled himself to face the other side, seeking comfort, only to hear a knee bump on a nose. He flicked his eyes open, finding Malfoy sitting beside him, hugging his legs together, shaky eyes trained on the small window that showed little moonlight from the outside. Based on Harry's point of view, it was Malfoy who's not used to being closed in such a small space – and the boy was barely three inches away from him. But Harry didn’t move, instead, he kept his eyes fixed on Malfoy. After a few seconds, the blond finally noticed Harry looking at him, horror washing his face.
He glared at Malfoy for his accusation and he seemed to have believed him after a few seconds of staring at Harry. "Okay then, just don't move, please," Malfoy plead and Harry nodded, causing him to rub his cheek on Malfoy's ear accidentally.
girls."
Harry winced inwardly. Of course Draco told her that. "Pansy,
To Harry, Snape was lecturing something in front but no words of his registered in his ears, as if the words were passing from his ear to another ear. After a while, he noticed Ron looking at him, eyebrows raised with crossed arms. Ron only looked like that when he's waiting for Harry to finish dressing up to his house garments and come down for breakfast at the Burrow. That is, Harry hadn't figured out quickly that they're already starting their task and Ron's tapping feet couldn't wait.
take the embarrassment anymore.
"Watch me, Potter."
"Come on then," Harry encouraged the scowling Malfoy, his wrist still in Harry's fist.
"Bugger, try something else."
“Open the Potions book!"
Ron, still curious and confused, slowly panned his eyes where Harry could possibly be giving his eyes. He wasn't certain, but Harry's gaze was sharp and murderous despite the cover of his rimmed glasses. The stare directly landed far beyond the two long tables of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff that separated them from the -
He saw Draco's eyes glinted with joy through Harry's very awkward sideglancing. Harry swore he saw Malfoy's mouth twitch upwards for a mere second too, valid to be called a genuine smile.
in this subject. The class watched the two sixth years, flurries of shouts and spells danced in front of them, all in awe except for Ron and Hermione who eyed the Slytherin suspiciously, just in case Malfoy decides to send Harry to the Wing.
nevermind I shouldn't have done this."
"Okay," Malfoy stopped him, his back once again propped to the wall with the lady in the painting shrieking again. "I'm... sorry."
listen to Finnigan, Potter," Malfoy said. "Do
Ron snorted.
Malfoy stared at him, then crossed his arms, the cool and cold look in his eyes was there as well, calm and nonchalant. Harry didn’t look away from it, though somewhere at the back of his head, he thought he might have been worried about Malfoy, but he couldn’t tell Malfoy that.
It was a good idea, Harry thought at first. Bring Malfoy to Hagrid to spend time with him together and talk about Quidditch, owls and other sorts of things they'd find amusing with a cupful of tea, two sugars and no milk just as Harry liked it. Harry, putting his wand back to his pocket, held Malfoy's arm and dragged him closer to Hagrid's house. He waited for Malfoy's breath to regulate before speaking again.
talk to me or else I'd resort to Hexing."
The rumors were already spreading when I got to the Hall," said Harry. He did tell the truth to some of the curious younger students, but none of them believed him. They would only stare at him, as if he was an amusing show animal and walk away.
Coughing again, he continued. "Alright, I was probably stalking you. Only because I think you're up to no good and was vanishing randomly from the map - "
"Harry? Are you okay? Ron – what... what happened to Harry?” Hermione's voice was hushed, sounding worried, and she was already done with the task. She tentatively waved her hands in front of Harry, who was, to her dismay, eyes drifting at a spot at the ceiling as if the two spiders creating a web there were that much of an importance. She was careful not to get the attention of Snape who was sauntering around to check their progress as he discussed.
"Fucking
"I’m going to study somewhere quiet where there is none of you. Good riddance, and please let me get the book," Draco said and stood up, gathering all of his things and grabbed a hold of the Potions book.
Though the blond didn’t remove his head from the crook of Harry's neck, nor slapped Harry's fingers that were caressing his hair. He stayed and remained silent. Malfoy whispered, "I'll get you tomorrow, Potter. I'll ruin your Potions quiz."
Harry closed his eyes, since it would  be 'til then before Malfoy wakes up.
Harry was caught off guard and before he had the chance to blink and gather himself, Malfoy's fist had already landed on his cheek, crunching. Harry, now combusting in anger, threw Malfoy his blow, wind whishing and knuckles dully aching after. Blood dribbled down Draco's chin and without attempting to wipe it, he limped forward and kicked Harry's stomach with his knee. They continued punching, kicking and pushing each other until Harry felt his knees suddenly freezes, causing him to tip back onto the ground. Malfoy flopped beside him next, in the same state as Harry: lips dampened with blood and jaw either colored a hue of red transitioning to violet.
Harry stood there, confused and lost, at least hoping for Ron and Hermione to appear to make him feel better of himself. He said he was not a coward, yet in reality he wanted to back out and choose to sleep through his Saturday night. That sounded like the best option. Harry thought of planning his glorious escape just like the other Hufflepuffs, but there come Ron and Hermione through the door, panting from running all the way up to the seventh floor. When they noticed Harry’s presence, they smiled.
Draco stayed silent for awhile, but it seemed that his curiosity got the best of him since he tilted his head up to look at Harry.
All of Harry's classes were finished on that particular Thursday afternoon, having a headache and most of it was caused by the "plague". He went ahead to the Hall and saw Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson inspecting him from their table like he was some lab rat, with Malfoy beside them being the only person not looking his way, too intent to stare at his afternoon mashed potato. Harry ignored them. After all this time, he admits - despite all the monstrosity of the rumors that had gone on for the whole dreadful week, risking his face from the
Malfoy tensed and stepped back one foot away from the table, as if waiting for his cue to run, obviously wanting to dodge a topic Draco had an idea what.
Harry kept his position. "Is answering me that hard?"
"I d-didn't expect ye will bring Malfoy but em very honored still.
information he's like a brother to me."
This time Harry wasn't laughing because Malfoy bit his neck
"Happy Christmas,
"You could leave, you know. You don't want to be here, just go. I can manage myself," said Harry, attempting to look like he can when he knows he can't. Expectedly, Harry's spoon fell back to his plate when he raised it.
Upon reaching the bathroom, he held the boy's chest gently and said, "I don't want you to come in here with me. You could get hurt. We don't know what's completely there. Could you run to the Hospital Wing and ask for Madam Pomfrey's help instead?"
This was the first time he’d seen Draco Malfoy up close again since his incident. He looked all better in his natural color and was wearing some casual loose robes.
“Okay then. Will you be fine kissing me again?” Harry didn’t know why he asked that, but he felt that even though they hate each other, consent was necessary since that's how he did it with some girls who confessed their undying love for him, them being dismal it was only a one-time thing for Harry's part.
“It's because Professor Snape
“I'll go then.”
"Potter! Have you no shame?"
"You know what Malfoy? I'd like to see you try," Harry teased, actually waiting for Draco to say an apology to him. He was confident he wouldn't receive any kiss from him. Draco didn't swing that way. He knew that they both didn't swing that way because of their preferences. He saw Draco blatantly flirting with a girl one time behind a pillar, and so was he, who had crushes on girls, shagged with Cho Chang and other than that, he was filled with fantasies of having it on the bed with a girl, girlish moans filling his ears, getting ridden by a fantastic girl who could lead. Someone soft and girly was enough of a turn on.
The boy nodded and ran away to go do what he was told. As for Harry, he braced himself for what was about to come, breathing in and entered the eerie and dark bathroom. He raised his wand, gathering and remebering all the spells he could use just in case for defense, eyes hyperaware and ready for potential intruders.
had been noticeably avoiding Harry since their unfortunate situation. It was great Malfoy no longer smirked and taunted Harry like he used to, but it would've been greater for Harry's peace of mind if Malfoy did it in
"Like?"
"I can't talk to a person tense about having me talk," Harry sighed and had let himself completely flop on his seat despite the dust particles crawling up his robe. "Could you... relax? I don't feel okay not being casual - "
, and it was all to be blamed to his carelessness. If the cloak did not reveal his feet at that time he was, now he'd admit, stalked Malfoy, then his faith would've been kinder to him as of the moment, sparing him a space of peace in his mind.
Harry Potter decided he wouldn't do it.
"It's not?"
get off fighting with you," Pansy said, and Harry did not miss the smirk that was quick to vanish off Blaise's face as Harry's face heated. Pansy's unannounced laughter reminded Harry of a tickled cat in Mrs. Figg's house.
- not the embarrassing one they're in now where they would be too aware of close proximity and think of other things instead of their normal,
That included Malfoy, who was standing the opposite of him, crossing his arms and like the crowd, he was staring at him too, but too much like he was some dirt. Harry squinted, confused and had the sudden urge to coil further on his seat.
It has been exactly three days since Harry lost himself further to his sulking. After classes, he would ignore all the greetings he was used to having to sit and eat a small portion of his bacon and sausage, all too little for Ron and Hermione's approval. Bacon and sausage used to be on his lists of favorites before, but now he couldn't make himself care for the simplest things such as taking care of his eating habits, or add new foods to his list where his tongue tingled for attention. Not just that, but he was also doing his best to avoid all the possible routes in the castle where there held a possibility he would meet
"But Potter, I could
love-hate relationship gossip! Potter, are you not aware that you and Draco are the hottest blokes wanted in Hogwarts as of this moment? They'd die just to create an issue even if they heard the truth already!
"Pansy, you're
"Madam Pomfrey, would I be able to leave later on too?" Harry asked and remembered his untouched assignments for three days that needed to be done by Monday. There was also their usual Inter-House Unity every weekend where he and Draco had to participate in as well.
A voice rattled him out of his thoughts. He realized the room was suddenly quiet, all eyes fixated on him, some gaping, some looking at him with horror-filled eyes. Wait, why are they looking like that?
"What's wrong? Have I done something?" he asked, genuinely confused.
and who in Merlin said he didn't want my germs to get transmitted to his robe? You're
This means that Draco is a Death Eater. Draco was already one of them. A chosen one.
He and Malfoy were paired up in D.A.D.A. without Professor Robin Harper's supervision in the Dueling Club right after their Double Potions (who was said to have accidentally stunned himself badly, and now in the Hospital Wing, said by Professor Scott of Arithmancy from the next classroom - who couldn't stand a class defending against the dark arts for a second and fled after explaining).
"Potter."
S-sorry I haven't cleaned up," Hagrid greeted, a little anxious of Malfoy but observably grateful. Malfoy's face was still contorted, not calming down but was convinced - forced rather (by Harry) to go inside. Harry gripped Malfoy's hand tighter, a fair warning to Malfoy not to insult Hagrid's fondness for dangerous creatures, the barn-like smell of his hut and the grease-bathed face of Hagrid's from work since Malfoy was known to never holding back an affront. Malfoy gasped in pain before Harry had let go, sulking on the dusty sofa he propped on whilst Harry sat beside him, saying his usual greetings to Hagrid ("Hagrid, great to be here. The usual tea for me"). Malfoy did the same, but a hesitant one, almost drawling but Hagrid was too happy to spot it. ("Hello, Hagrid. Fancy being here. Er - milk on my tea, no sugar"). The half-giant then prepared dessert for them, busy at his kitchen counter and in a good mood for having guests.
you are so stupid, I cannot believe you exist!
"Well, if you really were, could you be of any assistance?"
"Nowhere."
"So you'd boss me around, instruct me and let me do all the work?"
"We were friends?" Malfoy distanced himself further from Harry.
were you avoiding me then?"
"No. But it wasn't that bad. It was just a small cut."
"I deserve to know why you see it pointless. I did all these disgusting things!"
Harry still had his eyes anywhere except Malfoy, focused on the goal of reaching the Great Hall for dinner. He wasn't keen to know whether what Malfoy said indicated he enjoyed their day together or their last moment where they stared at each other.
lovey-dovey, let alone as a couple. The thought of... just...
Harry smirked, shooting Malfoy a teasing glance. Unfortunately, Malfoy wasn't always successful with his "
Harry's mind was suddenly bombarded with thoughts of needing to ask Malfoy. Malfoy looked softer than usual. A look that said he was in no mood to harass Harry or taunt him, so Harry tried.
"Well, what do you even want, Malfoy? You seem to not know what you're doing with everything," Harry whispered, this time it hurts to speak. Malfoy finally released Harry's wrists, resulting in Harry sliding down the floor.
Draco snorted, then opened the wardrobe tentatively, looking back at Harry who was side-by-side with him. “I don’t know that. It seems that the last time we kissed, Potter, you eagerly moved your lips.”
"I enjoyed it, Potter."
Pansy continued, her smile faltering at the sight of Harry's expression, "On the other hand, Potter, for those rational enough to attempt and debunk the truth, no one knows about the room that's not supposed to be closed in McGonagall's office - they'd say you made that story up to cover for the secret make-out session. Trust me."
Harry got distracted when Malfoy looked up to glance at him with just his eyes, but remained his head down, hand and wand on Harry's arm. "Stop that."
Voldemort and his Death Eaters are near. Harry couldn't explain
Harry snorted, mostly by the fact Draco had read him from

was a wrong decision of mine and we should forget all of it."
" he hissed at the Scurras who hugged his leg and watched them hiss simultaneously, crawling back to their hole beneath Hagrid's hut. After, Harry half-dragged, half-pulled Malfoy to the house who was deliberately making himself heavier. Hagrid, hands still shaking, still opened the door as what he originally intended to do and beamed at the two of them, a steaming pot of boiling tea in his hand.
Harry parted his lips to be able to breathe properly (which wasn't effective because he couldn't feel his lungs moving), letting Malfoy sooth his lips with a tentative, hot thumb. His lips felt dry so Harry unconsciously brushed his tongue on it that caught Malfoy's finger accidentally along. Harry shot him an apologetic glance but Malfoy remained having his half-lidded eyes.
Harry sighed in defeat, laying tense and still because if one of his mates bust in the door, they would find his and Malfoy's

wander around," Malfoy said, sitting Harry to his bed. It was obvious on his face that Malfoy didn't like being in such a red-infested room from the carpet up to the ceiling, his nose scrunched up a little, and Harry was embarrassed the blond really did bring Harry to his dorm. Harry relaxed himself on his bed as Draco assisted him, palm flat on Harry's back as he lowered the Gryffindor down to his bed. Harry's foot seemed to have step on Neville's toad (and why the fuck was it everloving there) on his blanket and slipped down along with Malfoy on top of him.
The boy nodded, almost teary-eyed, and tugged Harry's sleeve dragging him out of panic. He followed the boy, his heart sinking as he thought of the endless possibilities what may have caused the incident. Could a Death Eater be behind this? Myrtle herself? He doesn't know. Harry gripped his wand tighter than ever.
He stood outside the Entrance Hall after eating, back propped on the wall and eyed everyone who went out, waiting for Parkinson or Zabini. When a group of Slytherins came out next, he saw Draco among them and craned his neck if Pansy and Blaise were too, and they weren't. After a few more students fled out, they finally popped out of the door.
"Potter, you won't gain anything from this, even if I told you," Malfoy said, looking at Harry's eyes thoughtfully
As for Ron, the one who had always been Harry Potter's trusty companion, had his eyebrows furrowed, staring at his best friend who was frowning since they've woken up. To his frustration, Hermione wasn't in the hall with him to check up on Harry together, as she had given her morning time for studying for her extra classes such as Muggle Studies and Arithmancy. His main concern here was that Harry hadn't eaten a single edible thing since dinner last night, ignoring all of his favorite delicacies after a long day of being buried under schoolworks and showing no indications of hunger, which was bothersome. Ron pressed his palm on his face, wanting to scold his best friend who wasn't himself, for days he couldn't count that Harry was barely nibbing on biscuits and sipping on water in Quidditch practices. He was easier to explode as well, too sulky and preferred his alone time for interminably long after classes.
"You tell me, Malfoy," Harry said softly.
Harry didn’t expect for Malfoy to do that but his heart fluttered by it, and kissed Malfoy on the lips again, gradually losing his breath, his drunken head couldn’t think of anything but to continue kissing Malfoy until he was satisfied, until Malfoy was satisfied, harder, deeper and longer than the swift three-second kiss they shared days ago. When their mouth finally separated, Harry pushed him off and wiped his mouth with the back of his mouth. Draco's mouth tasted like champagne, and he couldn't remove it inside his mouth.
Shaking his head, he watched Harry vanish from his line of sight and ate the rest of his breakfast silently.
"I'm sorry," Harry said. "I shouldn't have asked such a sensitive topic. No matter how much we hate each other. It's… really callous of me."
Professor McGonagall looked at them for an intense second, like the cat-like focus she had before she scribbled something on a piece of parchment, handing it to Malfoy after. Harry raised his chin to peer at it, reading:
As his eyes drifted along the length of Draco's arm, there were noticeable red marks all over his wrist, as if randomly done on purpose.
yes! I'm fine, Potter. And again, it's none of your business."
Harry closed his eyes, leaning towards Draco's palm that may have unconsciously rose up to wipe Harry's damp face, Harry nudging the hand while holding on Draco's back with both of his hands. A moment later, he felt Malfoy's free hand caress on his other cheek, wiping off Harry's tears himself with his fingers that shook Harry's stomach a little.
And they went silent for a while, shoulders brushing past each other as their gaze found the stars again - which are each other's eyes, staring at the deepness of it. Harry was speechless, how Draco's eyes had a hint of blue under the scrutiny of the moon's glow, how intense it looked at Harry's own that inexplicably disturbed something in Harry's chest.
He walked across Hogwarts briskly all the way to the Stone Bridge, ignoring the pain of walking with his pointy, pinching and old school shoes that binded his feet in agony, wand firmly grasped by his hand.
Then Draco Malfoy, the man who was involved in the
, actually. I was first with this book!"
"Malfoy again?" Ron said. He spoke these exact same words hundreds of times since their first-year. "Could you please eat, mate? The oat and raisins were quite well-done. I asked Winky herself to add more sugar to your portion since you liked it too sweet. Go on."
Everyone actually liked greeting Harry, he had always been quick to respond to different requests, needs and other problems he would be willing to meddle in no matter how bizarre or foolish that is. Although not this time. He was barely approachable today, as if his looks alone could zap someone and leave fire.
They stared with wonder at each other first, confused why they did it, but Harry just knew at the moment he was curious to feel that thin and soft mouth again on him, despite Malfoy being a bloke. Harry's heart trembled at the thought, somehow guilty because why in Merlin does Malfoy's lips resembled Luna's? Very girlish and pink, very soft-looking. A few seconds later, simultaneously, they leaned forward, closed their eyes and bumped on each other's nose.
She ordered a kitchen elf to bring Harry a full meal and asked Malfoy to stay for a while and keep an eye on Harry, which made Harry feel like an utter toddler.
Harry stretched his legs before he massaged his thumb on his heels as he sat in  McGonagall's office alongside Malfoy on a couch, aware of their close proximity but too occupied thinking about their pending punishment. His bruises hurt, and it was embarrassing to sit beside the boy he just had a row with. The professor offered both of them tea and cookies, but Harry was sure his appetite was forestalled by her intent to stare so he didn’t get one. Harry was ashamed since he was the one who provoked the row between him and Malfoy. He'd never been in her office for good reasons – it was always for detentions.
he heard in Potions and would have to create an essay about its importance.
Harry flushed again, mixed with anger and humility. "I can't think of anything to do for you. I don't even know what you want! Plus, I know this conversation is pointless. We might end up killing each other right now - oh
"The hell is that?"
the girl I'm going to snog?"
. Help me, idiot! You should've thrown a broken goblet! What are you, a sentimental fool?"
Harry, without giving it much of a thought, smiled as he reached his free hand out and offered it to Malfoy. Malfoy had withdrawn his gripping hand off Harry's other hand first before the blond gawked at Harry's other offering hand, as if looking at a strange foreign object for the first time up close, his face first making a confused expression, then warped to surprise, and then panic. Harry shook his own hand a little, as if saying Malfoy should get on with it, and Malfoy, seemed settled and relieved by Harry's eagerness, took it and smiled back.
"I did answer your stupid question, so why complain?"
Harry groaned, trotting back to the castle side by side with still-in-a-laughing-fit Draco bloody Malfoy. "
"Meet me at the Greenhouses after classes," said Harry with pride in his voice despite the lack of oxygen from overexhaustion, yanking Draco's figure upward to help him.
"Malfoy!" Harry walked faster and felt his face hot. Hagrid shouldn't have shared a story that would give Malfoy all the reason to tease him.
And for an unknown reason, Harry blushed. The conversation was getting to nowhere and nowhere. Everything was turning childish. "And that's my fault now? That you didn't get your arse kissed?"
Harry only wanted to spell Malfoy's lips to be bigger for a couple of hours. Malfoy might've misinterpreted the meaning.
There was a gut feeling that Malfoy's absense was a form of premonition.
" Harry raised a brow, and now his glasses were slipping dangerously off his nose that Draco, reflexively, pressed it back to Harry's face with his... bloody nose. Harry almost gagged at the proximity. He was so full of Malfoy he was going to be sick. The blond's cheeks had pinked so much that Harry's disgust was overpowered with the urge to laugh at his power to embarrass the life out of the blond. The grip on his poor wrists tightened up his head that made him wince.
Draco pinned him to the wall, gritting his teeth as he aimed his other clenched fist on Harry's chin, hands pressed tightly on Harry's chest. "Potter, first of all, what the
He thought Malfoy wasn't taking notes of
"It's near the staffroom, idiot. Do you want them to confirm their suspicions about the Malfoy-Potter relationship? As we all know, that fucked up rumor reached the Headmaster because the whole staff said so."
Hagrid blushed behind his hair and went to the kitchen again to make some more tea and pound cake practically flying like a giant cupid in euphoria. Harry, a little bitter, grabbed one slice off the plate and nibbled off it to try it out himself. It was... scrumptious. It had the right sweetness, softness and saltiness mixed together that brought satisfaction to Harry's tastebuds that rarely rejoiced these days due to loss of appetite. "Hagrid, isn't it unfair that your pound cakes improved and Malfoy's the first to taste it and not me, Hermione and Ron?"
"So you like Loony Lovegood? I thought that was a joke? Oh god, Potter
of Draco Malfoy leaning on his face. How did it end up like this?
"May I
Draco growled, mouth twitching upwards as he stared at Harry avoiding his eyes. "Fuck you, Potter, don't make this about me. Goddamn this,
Draco roamed his eyes around the hut for a moment, seeing all the chicken feathers and fur Fang shed that Harry also saw. Harry sensed Malfoy's deep disgust, but suppressing it for Harry's sake. Draco's palms were glistening with sweat and kept it gripping on his inner palm as if calming himself down. Harry supposed it wasn't just for being disgusted.
Draco shook his head for a moment, like snapping out of his thoughts. "My mother had different plans for Christmas. I wasn't a part of her plan, I might as well stay and not get on her way."
"Did he say anything?"
Ron wanted to ask further questions, but chose not to press on about it, about, obviously about Draco Malfoy since Harry was so keen on stalking the blond, just to find out if he was
"Go to the Hall, Harry. We'll be waiting for you here," Hermione drew without breaking eye contact with the book. "And

"I guess," Harry said, and wanted to add
Harry jolted and spilled some of his choco milk at Ron's chest beside him who reenacted what Harry did to Seamus, but with pumpkin juice. Some Ravenclaws who passed by their table chuckled from Hermione's outburst and left comments as they went such as,
hear him, it'll be about his mum and their festivities at their manor. Although he's more childish when he was younger, but... you know, Draco's just
“Did… you get all that?” Malfoy asked after his lecture, using the underside of his palm to rest his chin. Harry nodded, skimming his scribbles of notes one by one with a satisfied smile. He really understood the lesson by heart and he couldn’t believe Malfoy was the one who made it possible.
like Hermione. His method of teaching was student-friendly, and the way he spoke said well of his mastery of the area. When Harry doesn't get something, Malfoy makes sure he explains it in another way Harry would. It turned out to be a surprisingly productive day.
If Malfoy wouldn't tell him a piece of information about the stab, maybe his friends could. If there's one thing that he was sure of, it was Zabini and Parkinson's similar love to Draco of what Hermione and Ron have for Harry.
and it's effectiveness of making a magic folk float in the coldness of the dim Potions classroom, and his paper was still visibly blank.
Harry groaned, arriving at a quick conclusion of: "You know we can share, right?" which was actually a horrible idea.
"Worth a try, I think."
Harry smiled. He suppose it was amusing. "We both stayed in the Wing for a couple of hours since we got warts. It was itchy."
"I don't know why I agreed to this, I lost my mind," Draco said after managing his laugh by coughing.
chance was to be grabbed. He wanted Malfoy to be genuinely his friend, he realized. But was that possible? When he rejected Malfoy's offer of friendship their first year?
"Was not!"
Harry unconsciously stepped his right foot backward, his heart pounding hard.
Chuckles erupted in the air, shaking from laughter.
"Would you be okay if you show me where he is?" asked Harry.
"Thirty points! BOTH OF YOU!" Harry heard a booming voice and he knew who it was. He closed his eyes and sighed in defeat. It was the end of the world, and Professor McGonagall saw a live-action scene of him and Malfoy fighting like twelve-year olds.
Harry glared at Malfoy for a second, and he saw nothing but amusement in Malfoy's eyes. "As if you can, Potter. You're going to faint in five minutes, trust me. With that smell? You'd better be off to the Wing and get your arse pampered by Pomfrey."
Harry looked down a little and greeted the little boy who seemed to be a first year student. He asked the boy what was wrong, and the answer was immediate.
girls couldn't stop talking about us, and I'm not gay, Potter."
“What’s wrong?” he asked, speculating the door along with Malfoy.
Harry clicked his tongue before he released Draco. Instead of letting Draco go, he trapped him between the wall, his hands on Draco's side, and for that reason, the Slytherin's cheeks created a very vibrant shade of pink. Harry wasn't sure if it was out of anger or embarrassment, and in Malfoy's case, it seemed that either was the answer. They both stared at each other with so little space to breathe, so little movements to create, a jet of thunder connecting them as their eyes darkened together.
in Potions as his final grade for the first term. If he kept this up that is, dozing off in such breath-constricting class, Snape could really give him that kind of grade since he looked eager to give Harry such a mark. Silently, he watched Snape write the ingredients for today's potion-making at the board in his very small and cursive handwriting, shortly announcing after that Ron was his partner for the activity after several callings later.
"... don’t like scolding you, but look at you! You’re paler, your performance in classes is dropping. Look at your cheeks too, they sank!” Hermione continued.
"Your presence is at front of the door. I'm
It was an awkward and breath-constricting session in Defense. Harry didn't know how to deal with a much more pliant and coy Malfoy that stood before him, barely managing to point his Hawthorn at Harry like a first year student in front of a boggart and Draco kept looking down at a tiny dust that was on Harry's shoe, tint of pink appearing constantly on his pale face. All that more-awkward situation made Harry's stomach lurch in anger that he declared he won't go easy with Malfoy, and gladly, Malfoy seemed to get back on his self and sneered at Harry again temporarily before going back to the avoiding-each-other thing.
and, by the way, had issues with his father currently in jail. He would cry on my lap all day long during the weekends, not muttering a single word about what his problem was. He would just sob like a kid, until he stops - then that's it. He'd leave and act like it was all fine once again. I guess sometimes he tends to run away from his frustrations by fighting with you." Pansy paused for a moment. "Draco isn't the type to spill all of his problems through talking, Potter. He prefers writing it all in his diary and not telling anyone of it. That's
“Malfoy, look at me,” he called, tentatively outstretching his hand and held on Draco's shoulder, who jolted upon contact. The blond looked up and Harry's eyes widened when he saw Draco's pupils, all shaky and glazed from crying. Draco pressed his palms together again to cover his face, realizing Potter had taken a good picture of his face.
He saw Malfoy's face softened in the dim light but as always, he was too quick to change his expression. Now he glared and walked towards Harry by one footstep. Draco leveled his face with Harry and stared at him, leaning suddenly forward. Harry's body instinctively did a fighting stance, his back already pressed on the door. Malfoy, taller by an inch, was already a mere centimeter away from his face.
good friends. Could it go like this until then? Harry was afraid they wouldn't be comfortable anymore after this, that they would be back to square one once Malfoy leaves his bed. He never found it a good thing to do but Harry was certain he didn't want this chance with Malfoy to slip away. Such a
Harry paused eating. If all prefects would be there, then it means Draco Malfoy would be there too, right? His heart immediately thrummed loudly in panic. He didn’t want to deal with Malfoy yet, no, no. His weekends are supposed to be his resting days from all the school's tiring work, not deal with Professor McGonagall's scrutiny, Professor Snape's permanent revolted facial expression, and especially Malfoy's silly Hexes and insults.
"Potter, you're not going to rape me, are you?"
"But, do try, Potter. A martyr like you? I think you could get somewhere progressive if you keep it up with him, even if it had to be
Harry was out of it, he knew, holding his essential things for writing, letting the ink from the tip of his quill drop to leave blotches on the self-cleaning paper Professor Snape had lent them just minutes ago. They were given at least ten minutes to finish a quick reflection regarding the
“Thank you for all the remaining wizards and witches here who knew what the word
After a few minutes of waiting, a familiar voice was heard in which Harry saw the name
"Oh, but that's not how I saw it, Malfoy, you kissed me so passionately
Harry sighed. He supposed Malfoy wouldn't ask if he didn't need the book.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows and swallowed a spoonful of his morning porridge, his other hand grasping his croissant nimbly. His stomach ached once the porridge reached his digestive system, growling for more food. He just realized he really was hungry he could eat a cow.
He wouldn't call stalking Malfoy his habit, but Harry would find himself constantly restless whenever he would see Malfoy's aggrieved footprint patterns on the map where it had the same route every single day since the start of their winter term, vanishing somewhere his marks wouldn't be spotted on the map and magically return before dusk. He had his growing suspicions about Malfoy ever since the first day back in Hogwarts Draco broke his nose and left him petrified in the train.
." He felt Malfoy lean forward because a forehead was now bumping on his own. Harry, eyes fluttering weakly, turned away and pressed the side of his cheek on the wall.
"Yes! Suit your bloody arse!"
, broom cupboard after classes."
. I don't want you to do those to yourself."
Harry, swallowing his dignity, enveloped his left hand around Malfoy, pulling him towards himself and rested his fingers on Malfoy's head. He waited for Malfoy to pummel him, to struggle out of his grasp, and kick him but none of those possibilities happened.
"Wait."
"Ah, of course, our Golden Boy liked the attention. Only this time, involving a
" wailed Hermione continuously and she was barely recognizable anymore. The Gryffindors in their table seemed to be keen to scoot away from her spot except for Harry and Ron.
Draco rolled his eyes, continuing his walk and found that Harry was being dragged to the nearest room Draco found. The blond didn't let go of his grip on Harry's front, he squeezed it tighter, throwing him beyond the latched door and closed it immediately when the two of them were both inside, locking it completely with a spell.
Malfoy's eyes narrowed. "Potter, stop it. We
Harry's eyebrows furrowed, though did what was told, resulting in confusion as to why he was in such a situation. How did Malfoy know their last lesson in Potion? He wasn't in class.
"Shut up!" Draco's hand tightened further on a handful of Harry's wrists. The Gryffindor whimpered. "You don't care about me, stop pretending to be so
Harry looked at her and the warmth spreading in his heart wasn't prevented by his obvious depression. Harry wouldn’t know what to do without them, Ron and Hermione. He was always lost without their guidance and support. Just now, he wasn't able to show it since the growing emptiness within him was overpowering his whole being.
It was
fuming on his seat, froth of anger bubbling on top of his nook.
Harry drew in a deep breath, uncomfortable from the contact. "Well, bear with it, Malfoy. It's just for a night. Consider yourself lucky since you have someone to comfort you.”
From time to time, Harry would catch Draco looking at him, which was odd, but he chose to deliberately act he didn’t know he did. Since the space  of the room was tremendously narrowed from all the cluttered stuff, their shoulders would brush every time they’d exchange areas, and their eyes would land on each other accidentally. It kept happening until they finished cleaning the trophy room that it drove Harry crazy. He couldn’t stand being quiet – he couldn’t stand the silence when he knew well he wasn’t alone.
I am talking to you and that's all we've agreed on!"
Draco held the small packet Harry had curiously. Harry expected Malfoy would say something revolting about a muggle stuff being on his skin, but he didn't. In fact, he looked amused and carefully tried to make himself comfortable around Harry.
"Bloody wanker, what was that for!" Harry asked, out of words. Here he was thinking his day could get normal.
Harry gritted his teeth, his left hand unconsciously groping his wand, in case he needed it to defend himself. He forgot Malfoy had tendencies to be a know-it-all like Hermione, but a more annoying version. "But why do you have to smell right on my neck?
Draco might learn to develop a soft spot for you," Pansy encouraged and Harry gave her a hesitant nod. There was something sneaky about her stare that he didn't dare ask, because she seemed willing enough to talk nonstop if she was asked.
It was obvious that Malfoy did all that for being aware of Harry's favorite past time of
You and your stupid Savior Complex should vanish off the Wizarding World, and maybe life would be better and brighter. And I won't have to deal with all this shit in my life."
"It's his dare! Isn't that unfair for my part?"
Harry, who was almost two steps up the staircase was yanked backwards when Malfoy grabbed on his wrist, his feet landing back to the ground. Harry was shocked but Malfoy wasn't retuning the expression because he wore a nervous face in contrary to Harry's petrified one. Harry was befuddled why Malfoy looked like he's about to panic like Harry was about to flee.
Pansy stood there, face gawking for a while before she nodded. Blaise was rooted to the floor with a blank expression, and Pansy dragged him by arm towards Harry's direction. Would they be suspicious of him? About to ask questions of how Malfoy's injury was? He never associated himself with Parkinson and Zabini properly before, but he knew the two were less annoying than Draco.
And Harry did because his hand was much more important than his dear life. He gasped as his hand started to form an ugly shade of gray wondering how it got that smoke-colored color. He had let Malfoy hold his palm, stroke his whole length of arm for a moment, examine it, before Malfoy murmured a spell, his wand running down the skin, poking softly on the ache of it. Harry was whimpering in pain and was thinking how daft he was for not knowing the sickly-orange powder's identity.
Harry was getting embarrassed but shrugged it off. He was determined to finish what he started. "Tell me the reason you were scared when you were trapped with me in the trophy room."
Without knocking, he opened the cupboard and found Draco Malfoy sitting primly on one of the disposed benches from the Pitch, still in his robe like Harry. His hair wasn't gelled, surprisingly, and had his blond hair all over his forehead which was a rare sight.
The blond smiled and grabbed Harry's wrist that was firmly squeezing on the front of his robe. Harry thought he was stronger, but unfortunately, this time, Malfoy had more strength since he was obviously well-fed and Harry was deprived of it. He pushed Harry to the wall and pinned him there. Harry didn't know how both of his hands ended up past his head with Malfoy holding them in place.
Harry grinned, pleased with how he projected himself, like he had control over Draco in even such a small situation. He smiled seeing Draco suddenly quivering in anger.
“Why the hell are you still awake?”
Harry gaped, not hiding the horror that crept on his face and internally combusted. Instinctively, he stood and ran towards the door. Everyone was encouraging him to come back to the circle, but he knew other things than to listen to them. He didn’t want to, even if God himself asks him to do it. There is no way he'd let his lips lay on Malfoy's again.
The blond's eyes shot open, giving Harry the look of speechlessness. The Gryffindor still looked confused and the color of his tanned face was almost as red as the color of their Gryffindor house. It took a moment for the two of them to compose themselves.
“I wasn’t the one who initiated that kiss, was I?”
"Yes, you did."
Harry nodded, noticing the awkward atmosphere vanishing, it must be a good thing Malfoy was good at being professional.
Parkinson rummaged through her robe pocket and raised an empty firewhiskey bottle. She hunkered down and placed the bottle on the floor. She sat first on the ground with both of her legs tucked under thighs, and everyone joined her to encircle the empty firewhiskey bottle.
Harry blinked slowly, remembering the time he stroked Draco's ego that seemed to have an effect on him that time Draco was sprawled on top of him. Could he really do what Pansy suggested? Reach that extent of humiliating himself in front of Draco? Harry could turn away if he wanted to, forget it and let Malfoy be but Harry was stubborn and persistent. He had been living for sixteen fearful years and faced almost-death experiences enough to know that about himself.
Draco had a look that said he started thinking fast.
not Malfoy!" then carried on gaping to his chair. It wasn't a shocking news that he was easy to read by her with just a scan of her eyes. "It's… something – but – but not Draco Malfoy. Plus I'm not hungry."
"Almost." Harry's eyes narrowed, hand slightly burning at the direct touch of the orange powder he was shoving in the phial with hasty fingers. He hurried up, sliding his eighth phial towards the other finished ones in the hopes of not embarrassing himself in front of Malfoy.
"But I don't know how to identify which is which and how to arrange it by their strength," Harry said.
He thumbed the phial open, poured three drops of it in the glass of water then mixed it with the spoon. He picked the dry towel next, dipped it in the bowl full of water and wringed the cloth. He waded and folded it, walked beside Malfoy's bed again and sat on the edge of it, letting himself sink on the mattress.
Annoyed, Harry tried to tilt his head, while he let Malfoy lean forward first this time. As their lips tentatively touched, ticklish and warm, Harry's soul escaped from his body.
"You know what Potter," he finally responded, “I don’t know what to do, really. There is a feeling of me wanting to run away as far away as possible from you. This is ridiculous – we
He listened to his best friends bicker in a hushed, hurried, angry tone, and so was Bulstrode who was Hermione's seatmate, silently steaming, forced to listen beside her and giving dirty glances to Harry. Distracted by something else, Harry's mind decided to float somewhere. This was usually the time he would think of the nights where he would have visions of killing someone in his dream, which was beyond gore and too filthy to be called a nightmare. The ones he had felt too real that he could barely greet his mates a good morning, because it wasn't.
bad one."
“I didn’t hear Abbot's stop signal,” said Harry. “Had she given it?”
Harry, not quite finished yet with his explanation, gasped when Malfoy’s hand pressed on his neck, constricting Harry from breathing. Malfoy’s eyes narrowed and the shaking of his pupils said he was extremely triggered.
Draco smirked. "Embarrassed about your trouser, Potter?"
Malfoy had gone in to the Room of Requirement. Malfoy had been doing this since the term started and Harry never bothered to find it suspicious at first when he himself had gone there out of boredom. Maybe this time, he could find it odd that Malfoy went there

often.
Throughout the first three classes of the day with barely eating lunch, Harry didn't see Draco Malfoy attended in any of it. Although the professors didn't seem too keen of looking for him or asked his presence while discussing. Harry would lie if he said Malfoy was the type to slack off, because Malfoy really wasn't. Slytherins are known for their quick response and submission to rules given to them by their headmaster. Draco was almost comparable to Hermione when it comes to being diligent in every task. Certainly Malfoy wouldn't abandon his grades like this, would he? Not even Harry would do the same.
"Wow," Seamus said, scanning Harry head to toe, opposite his seat. Harry looked at him with intent. "Don't you look... too cozy and formal mate?"
"I would really appreciate that."
Harry, despite himself, cackled atrociously, louder than the previous one. Malfoy's face was priceless and was worth the laugh. "Oh
bloody sharing a read with you, Potter."
" Ron fanned at himself. "Just ol' McGonagall assigning us some tasks just in case something bad happens during Inter-House."
It was making him nervous so he kept his eyes closed as he heard sounds of a robe fluttering disturbingly, small trinkets falling to the ground and a heavy breath of surprise echoing. Harry was under the impression Malfoy was in mortified silence to see a naked Harry Potter.
The blond glared. "I really don't care and I can't change!"
“Yes, the cupboard, my long-term bedroom. I don’t want to elaborate, but you can imagine what I look like there.” Oh yes, he looked really silly in there, being tall and having his feet curved just so he could fit inside.
Harry's heart clenched but prodded the wand further on Malfoy's skin, watching it sink on the soft and pale flesh since that's how he'd bring his frustration satisfaction.
"I'll think about it, Potter."
Draco groaned. "Merlin!" Draco walked forward and stole Harry's spoon. He scooched over to Harry's side and was now the one to prod the spoon to Harry's mouth, urging Harry to open his mouth. Malfoy was surprisingly gentle in doing so, and Harry remained still on his place, opening his mouth willingly when Malfoy shoves another spoonful of food.
and his blond hair makes him feel very ill.
"Dare?"
Double Potions had taken place, and it was the last of it before they proceeded to take Snape's practical test before the term ended. Harry had always admitted his hatred for this class more than what he had for Argus Filch and his cat, but this time, it seemed that his destiny was meant to crumble apart when Snape announced: "Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy at the left farthest corner.
And why was Malfoy, of all people, the first man he kissed? And the first bloke who had the honor of feeling Harry's man equipment? Harry shuddered, revolted, and forgot Malfoy was on top of him.
, alright," said Pansy, snorting. "Everyone loves some
Harry did the opposite, secondhand embarrassment spreading through him as he buried his nose on his knees as an attempt to hide his presence. He certainly didn’t want to hear or imagine the details of Ron and, dear Merlin, a bloke, making out or humping on each other like bunnies.
Sighing again, he trudged back to the circle and made sure he threw daggers of threatening glare directly at Abbot before he looked at Malfoy. He didn't knew this lady was up to no good. He always thought Abbot was goody-goody.
Harry looked up, and Malfoy was no longer smirking and instead had his hand offering to Harry. Harry, pissed and in the care of a defective Cleansweep five, accepted the offer and glided with Malfoy in the air as they rushed towards the loop, their coat fluttering by the chill of the snowy breeze. Perceptibly, Malfoy was arrogant, nose up on a Firebolt but Harry, a mere second slower, found out last minute that the Cleansweep was very rove and clumsy and that was an advantage to distract Malfoy's smooth zooming move, keep him dizzy and possibly slow him down. Harry did just that, wearing the most smug face he could don and won their race after almost losing.
Harry made a sound that was mixed startled and annoyed. The nerve of this git is unbelievable.
After a few more bickerings and death threats, the two sauntered together again and let the comfortable silence enveloped them, mostly tired from their yelling and pointless arguments. Harry supposed it wasn't bad except for the torment Draco brought him about his trouser. They rested at the Courtyard for a moment, letting their stomach digest the food and flew on their respective brooms at the Pitch to pass time.
"Fine."
I'm the Golden Boy, I'm the
He saw Malfoy's chest stopped moving, his Adam's apple bobbing and Harry felt relieved of his own fear since he wasn't the only one feeling on edge. He kept his position and waited for Malfoy to do anything or make a movement that would confirm he wasn't a figment of Harry's imagination.
After a few seconds of walking to the Hospital Wing, Harry's mind blanked, not able to move from where he was standing. His surrounding was blurring, followed by an unpleasant ring in his ears. Harry staggered and dropped down to his knees.
girls just sent you love letters this week. How are you less handsome, you damn sod?"
That was probably the stupidest thing he said in his life, but worth it.
And this was the sign. Malfoy raised his wand and trained it on Harry's face, slowly walking towards him. Harry constricted his breath, his eyes fluttering shut again, stopping his urge to back off from what's coming. He couldn't read what Malfoy would do, as what almost everyone said to him, the blond was not capable of being foretold. Who knew if Malfoy would resort to murder? Or summon Voldemort to do it?
It was nighttime, specifically two hours before their curfew. Harry was soaked in sweat beside a similarly drenched Malfoy on the edge of the fountain, took a moment to glance at Malfoy that was moments ago up above the dim star-sprinkled night sky. He wanted to say something like,
Malfoy adjusted himself, a little alarmed, but his competitiveness was showing open wide for Harry to see, and he knew how much Malfoy was motivated to beat him in everything. Since they were younger, it was always Malfoy who was willing to prove himself worthy and better than Harry. "And if I win, Potter, you'd leave me the fuck alone with my business," Malfoy drawled.
Harry, angry again with the world and the blonds and the Slytherins altogether, stabbed his own portion of shepherd's pie with a fork harder than intended, creating an unpleasant screeching noise across the Great Hall full of food-deprived students barely surviving the welcoming term. Their classes were done for the day and Harry was supposed to be hungry, gnawing at his pie and talking heartily of his break but he wasn't doing just that. He talked to Ron and Hermione instead about what dreadful of a thing happened to him during their break and the two of them made lots of faces in response to Harry's story. They mostly were horrified why Harry asked Malfoy to spend time with him, but they didn't make it a topic for the whole meal and shrugged it off.
Harry was getting more and more pissed as seconds passed. He looked at Madam Pince for a second, hoping she was somewhere else farther from his space (because his voice was rising! No Hermione or Ron to control him!) before he answered, "Unlike you, I need to work extra hard on Potions. You don't even need to read because your inflated head's already a know-it-all."
unwanted memories. Harry looked away and shushed the thought.
Harry flinched and flushed, eyes looking down again.
They twisted themselves in an unnatural way, dropped to the floor and swirled their hands in a rhythm that Harry and Malfoy could only do, not caring if they bumped on other students hesitant to form even a small Stinging Hex or shield. Harry was fastly sweating, and could not admit the thrill of the way how aggressive Malfoy was of fighting him. It only took a matter of minutes for Harry and Malfoy to be the center of attraction in the room. After all, they both are
. I've spent time with Malfoy for two weeks. We were friends."
which probably meant Malfoy had plans going home a hundred percent. This also meant Malfoy had told Parkinson that Harry Potter invited him to stay at Hogwarts for their break like a dolt. Harry could vividly imagine Draco and Pansy talking about it: Draco wearing his deadpanned face and Pansy squerming for his sake, because she probably thought he and Malfoy now would reconcile and be best of friends.
"Argh!"
Harry looked down this time, a bit discouraged from Draco's silence. He didn't want to be guilt-ridden about it, but he was. Waiting for a miracle on Harry's part, Draco had moved his feet to back away and walk forward again, lost what to do.
"Potter, are you finished with putting it in the phials?" asked Draco as he panned his eyes at Harry's working space. He was doing fine, thanks, but not fast like lighting.
Harry nodded understandingly, not forgetting to say "
"You." Harry stepped a hesitant foot towards Malfoy. "You stayed?" Which meant Malfoy actually regarded Harry's offer and didn't reject him.
Harry scoffed. “Why are you so close to me then if you hate me that much?”
"Everything I'm
Harry smiled at the little dance Ron made in front of their Common Room's fireplace, all dressed up to go to Hogwarts Express, his luggage ready and Pigwidgeon, his small owl, was leaping along with Ron in his cage, probably excited to play with Errol. Harry could share Ron's joy because finally, their first term was finished, including their examinations and other practical ones that induced stress for days. Hermione was practically jumping on her seat as well, probably overjoyed about the fact she would be spending her two-week break in the Burrow with the Weasleys. It was a lot more of a big deal for her since it was a personal invite from Mrs. Weasley.
A seemingly interminable minute had passed, Draco was more fidgety in his position, obviously desperate to be freed from Harry's grasp, but he kept his mouth firmly together, not sure of what to do next. Harry raised his eyebrows.
Harry squinted at the idea of Inter-House Unity. It wasn't usual in the ears. "What's that?" he asked.
First, he went to the Dueling Club Room and found none of Malfoy's figment of existence there. He next dashed about to the hall, which was a way towards the Ravenclaw Tower, but found nothing there as well but Bloody Baron's ghost urging Peeves to get off his way, bowing at his command – but other than that, it was deserted. He thought about going to the Room of Requirement next but a Hufflepuff boy caught his attention, wandering like a lost child. The boy was panting for breath and when he saw Harry, he sighed in relief, dashing towards his direction.
Feeling his face flush further from his remark, Harry determinedly opened his eyes and finally gazed at the blond, holding the eye contact that felt like electricity zapping down his spine the moment he saw the gray stormy eyes. Harry trembled when he found Malfoy eyeing him with the same intensity and darkness - paralyzed like what Harry wanted him to be in the state of. Harry had spread his arms to emphasize his point, offering himself in a sacrificial manner. "I'm willing to give you anything you want, so
“Head above the clouds this early in the morning? I'm surprised you still
"So what if he's a Death Eater? What does it have to do with me? Don't ask me about him. If there's one thing I want the best right now, it is for you to stick your nose up somewhere useful. Your parents be damned for having a son like you, out of control and freakish."
murder Malfoy right now.
Harry moved before his brain processed what was said. Draco followed right after, shutting the door behind them.
"Professor Snape, I
"Because," Harry's mouth pursed, "maybe I could... you know, help?"
"Come on, say your apology," Harry pushed. "I have the whole day ahead - "
They exchanged turns with Harry's Firebolt and Draco, in awe, screamed in glory when he got ahold it, saying he was ready to be a Holyhead Harpies seeker and defeat all the seekers in the world. Harry however, struggled so much with a school-issued Cleansweep five that he had his knees scratched on the ground three times with broken (now mended) glasses, which earned him another set of Malfoy's insulting cackles.
"A night won’t be enough to clean this," Harry said, covering his nose as the smell of something-dead creature wafted through his nostril. It was true. He had cleaned the Dursleys' basement that wasn't touched for thirteen whole years for three days. He realized it was a dumb statement since he knew well they weren’t Muggles who needed something too physical to clean the room. They had magic.
"Potter this is too unreal. You're being - "
"I'll be back. Just drop it, Ron, okay? I won't be long. I'll eat when I'm done."
warn me, you'd do that!"
“It – it won’t open! I tried spelling it yet it's still like this.” Draco persisted to continuously twist the knob and kick again and again.
Pansy chuckled and Harry blushed, realizing what his question indirectly implied. "Well, yes, considering I snogged with him more than ten times in every overlooked corner of this castle especially in fifth year, I managed to make him bothered the first time he saw me naked. We didn't do that anymore since he regretted what we did, saying he wasn't allowed to be with a Parkinson because he had a reserved arrangement with the Greengrass family. And it wouldn't work anyway because he never liked me the way I did. I have Blaise now and I'm at the peak of my happiness because he loves me very much." She smiled with a spark Harry was suddenly envious of. He never experienced smiling that contently and peaceful before about love.
Harry asked himself.
to arrange."
he thinks he had a chance of befriending Malfoy right now.
"Potter," a soft hushed tone spoke atop his face and when he brought his blanket off his face, he saw Malfoy glaring but offering his right hand to him, like it was alright to breakdown in Malfoy's arm where he wouldn't judge him for a few minutes.
Harry leaned towards Draco's ear that pulled a quick flinch out of the blond. "Thank you for considering this visit at Hagrid's. I really appreciate it. It won't be long since Hagrid would only talk about you, me then a little about Hogwarts. It won't be a waste of time," Harry whispered, ignoring Hagrid humming the Hogwarts song as he starts cutting the cake he baked. "Let loose. Hagrid won't judge you. He forgets his hatred towards people once they start showing signs of kindness."
"What?"
- I - "
"Why?" was the word that came out of Malfoy's mouth after a few seconds of consideration, voice soft and full of questions he couldn't summarize in one word. "Why now, Potter?"
left me there, Potter!"
“Why are you helping me study?” Harry drawled.
Draco sighed and took a moment to bite on his apple. After chewing, he wiped his mouth with the back of his free arm that held the apple, eyes cool and blank. "Let's see," he scrunched his brows, "a dolt just asked me to speak to him if he won the duel, in which that person in question needn't poking his nose.
His eyes went farther down, landing on the slightly parted thin lips of Malfoy's. He gulped, remembering
“You don't seem alright,” Harry said, voice a little cracked and Malfoy swiveled his head away, coiling further to himself. He knew what it felt like to be scared from not knowing what's about to come.
dead meat, Potter," were the first words Draco said to him in the Wing, and Harry fought his need to strangle him. "My weekend mornings are supposed to be relaxing, not accompanying a guy attempting to have micronutrient deficiency. And who in hell wears their school robe on weekends?"
disappoint them. They've shown you love when no one else could bring you that affection. At least appreciate their efforts if you can't appreciate yourself."
Harry's face flamed more along with his temper and pushed Malfoy as he spun around, slamming him to a tree. "Could you not do this madness, please?"
Harry was surprised by this revelation. "Certainly. Ron is logical, but time-to-time irrational when mad. Neville's just soft but he's more intense than what he shows."
“I haven't," he answered, and patches of red started to appear on his face. The circle gasped and so was Harry.
about Draco," said Blaise, and Harry's ears reddened. He had a feeling Blaise was someone good at observing others.
"I – " Malfoy coughed and nodded nimbly at him. "Potter, are you going to read that?” then pointed at one of Harry's held books. “I need to study something related to Potions."
Despite himself, he reciprocated Draco's careful gaze. For an absurd reason, the atmosphere felt odd. It was an atmosphere too calm to be called a storm, but too boggling to be called peaceful. Malfoy was too unpredictable, like a ticking time bomb. His eyes were empty despite the smile he had on his face, which disconcerted Harry further.
Harry's blood reached its maximum temperature. "Then go to your girlfriend and snog her."
"Map? You have a
And again, he remembered Draco Malfoy actually didn't enter class for the whole day. There was no blond hair to be found in every hallway and classroom. Harry stopped for a moment, getting greeted by the Fat Lady who had her nighttime visit to the other portraits and walked away again.
"You were saying, Potter?" Malfoy asked and Harry was gasping for air. They remained still for seconds and as if the light of rationality finally dawned upon Harry, he pushed Malfoy - but that didn't work since Malfoy's weight was crushing his whole body on a bed that one of them must've required while kissing. Harry breathed first, composing himself. He tried his best ignoring how numb his lips had gotten and Malfoy's abnormally reddened lips from their ravishing.
He wasn't far off the mark, except for the snogging part, Harry thought.
"Wait!
whole points - one night I've been gone beside you, Harry!
"Oh, Malfoy – s-sorry," he said briskly. Draco had books in his arms too, and compared to Harry's, his were lesser, and it only reached his chest.
Harry did not talk nor look at Malfoy anymore since it was pointless to complain - especially Gryffindors, to the likes of Severus Snape,
Draco was exasperated again. The same expression he made when he found out he ranked second to Harry in Defense class. "
"What?" he asked stupidly.
Harry let out a breathy laugh that he wasn't sure was a laugh or a cough to cover his shame, or both. "I was desperate." And it was true. He wanted Malfoy to talk to him again. He just didn't plan this thoroughly. It was weird being a man who had always been in to girls, baring his clothes off to display it to a man who happened to be his archenemy. He had gone truly mad.
where he would make Hermione disappointed of him and force him to add an extra hour to his study time. And second, when a witch or wizard is in trouble, no matter who they were, as long as Harry saw the trouble himself or whatever-it-is, he wouldn't be able to stop seeking for a long-term solution.
"Yes, I'm afraid so."
involve my parents," he whispered. "You don't know my life, as much as I don't know your own."
The two of them stared tense at each other for a moment before Draco broke away first. "Yes, I just said I
Draco groaned. “Could you
the Irish voice said, followed by a small muffled thud beside Harry's bed. It was Seamus on his bed, and Harry made sure he had his breathing constricted. Malfoy wasn't breathing either.
"Could I order a bunch of these next time when I want them? I'd pay galleons," Malfoy said hesitantly, eyes sparkling as if he never ate such a good delicacy off their manor, shy but kept grabbing pound cakes anyway while mouth still full. Harry found the situation odd but didn't retort. He never thought Hagrid and Malfoy would have such a smooth conversation.
Harry murmured a protective charm and finished separating the ingredients, ignoring the blond's continuous complaints who had no choice but to get back to their cauldron. Malfoy seemed like he wanted to fly off the room just to avoid Harry's questions because he was chopping and extracting extra fast, making sure Harry would have a reason to keep his mouth shut, so he did. There was no way Harry could raise a fight against Malfoy's walls.
"MALFOY!"
"You really don't like me, do you?"
In five seconds of watching Malfoy, Harry's lungs felt a strong force of contraction, and in a flash without realizing it, Harry was dashing out of the Great Hall. He could've raised his middle fingers at Malfoy, or curse him like the usual but he didn't. Regret filled Harry's insides because now he was nothing but a damsel in distress.
of all his poorly-made choices, Harry chose to keep quiet and listened to Malfoy. He looked at the paper for a moment and found it as complicated as Malfoy. Every word looked like a scribble to Harry.
Potter, you hate me and I hate you." Draco held his forehead and chanted to himself about being in a coma or fever dream. Harry took a moment to stand up and pinch Malfoy's leg. Predictably, Malfoy yelped.
Potter?"
A few moments later, Draco stood up from his seat, and that must be the sign of the start of Hermione and Draco's morning rounds as prefects. Harry seemed to have finally noticed him due to Malfoy's absence, brought his look down to his feet and smiled appreciatively.
Draco arched his brow. “I don’t believe you’d be able to digest what you'd read from there, Potter.”
Harry finally spoke, sighing. "Malfoy Hexed a couple of first-years yesterday. No, they weren't badly injured, but they were terrified to pass through the Great Hall's chambers because of the incident. Malfoy Hexed me in return and I was the one who lost house points when Professor Sprout saw me casting at Malfoy a similar Hex he did, on the shin. Ron - I couldn't - I couldn't control my temper these days. I'm really sorry," Harry explained, as Ron observed, as calm as his mate could. He gave Harry a pat on the back and carried on eating.
Harry froze, barely stepping his right foot up the staircase. He swiveled his body around like just as how he'd turn when the Golden Snitch zoomed to a different direction when he's about to grab it.
Harry’s brow creased. "I know, I just said sorry to make you aware I'm not as bad as you thought. You give me reasons to hate you, so don't be too self-centered here."
Pansy's grin fell gradually and held Harry's wrist, yanking him away from Draco's view and hid behind a large tree. "You know Draco is self-entitled. He wouldn't last a day feeling below and unimportant. He hates humiliation and had always needed to be the cream of the crop, the most valued and treated like a deity of some power. He's like that, Harry. Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy made sure he was spoiled with all the things he wanted. I grew up with him and he'd always been arrogant. He changed because... he's been lonely and confused."
Harry snorted, annoyed from the sudden haughtiness Malfoy emitted. He got all the girls, and who cared about that he was a lady man? "And who, pray tell?"
"Yes, but you will be supervised by your friend," Harry winced at the word
"Drink this, please," insisted Harry.
raised, but he's a lot deeper than what he portrayed, nicer than you think."
happy, I think."
He could hear the wet, obscene noises they were making as their lips smacked and Harry was sure he tasted how much Malfoy wanted him back.
"Persistence is sometimes admirable, sometimes annoying. You fall into the second category."

Just as Harry was about to turn the dusty doorknob to get off the cupboard, Malfoy spoke. "I can't wait for that, Potty -
“Even a mouse could tell you’re not.”
Harry gripped on his map as Draco approached nearer Harry's direction, his eyebrows crinkled as if it joined together. He looked rather stressed, unusually paler than usual, but couldn't be compared to Harry's ways of neglecting himself. He could almost be as thin as Malfoy at this rate.
each other."
As the door closed after a few hurried steps, Harry relaxed and exhaled in pure relief. He released Malfoy and was certainly not a good idea since he received a rather hurtful pinch on his waist.
"Is not!"
Peace was not an option for Harry Potter the following week.
Harry was supposed to be irritated by the statement but instead, he chuckled, not loud enough to startle Madam Pince busy checking labels in her place. Malfoy blinked at him slowly before he gathered himself and hissed.
When was eating not making anyone in the mood?" gasped Ron. He was right.
I know. This is horrible but – if the dare was not done with the people involved, you guys would be stuck in here unless the dare was done."
She dislodged herself off of Harry's hand and walked to the middle of the room, clapping her hands to gather everyone’s attention. Some of them were already inebriated, and some still excited.
Harry was happy for his two best friends' relationship development. The two of them are meant for each other, something Harry hadn't felt for Cho when he was in love with her. Could Luna make him feel such way? Heart all giddy and jumpy if he and Luna were given a chance to be together?
he'd do. He knew Harry's patterns, memorized it all at this point since they became good friends.
Forgetting his miniscule amount of disappointment over his expectations of Draco
"You'd rather kiss me?" Harry snorted. "Wow, that's new."
In this tension-filled room, the game continued after Ron had spun his bottle, red patches disappearing off his face.
Harry gulped, panicking that he hadn't thought this through. He knew Malfoy would probably go back to their manor to be with his mother for Christmas, especially now that Draco's father was in Azkaban as stated by the
"Even to Bill Weasley, if
wailed Hermione in the Great Hall that caused Harry and Ron to keep their heads down, because anytime soon, she'd be a ballooned bullfrog with a red face. They were being scolded, the both of them - Harry for not telling he was going to have detention with Malfoy by Professor McGonagall (then ended up, quite literally, stuck in a detention with Malfoy for
"How did you find me?" Draco panted and shut his eyes again, his voice scarily fading away from him. "Of all people who'd find me, why this
Harry didn't bother hiding his groan and found the professor halting his demonstration of how to keep the cauldron at a certain temperature since it was a complex brew (the fire couldn't be out of control). Snape looked annoyed because he lost his momentum. Snape remained in his position, staring at the both of them and said, "Mr. Malfoy, you know I do not allow changing of partners in Potions. Yours and Potter's mark is already being brewed along with your antidote,
"Thanks," Harry said, not forgetting to add sincerity to his tone. "I didn’t know it was easier to understand when it’s taught that way to me. Snape barely slows down when he teaches." Harry slipped his note between his notebook and threw it in his satchel, able to say he was prepared for tomorrow's Potions quiz. His shoulders relaxed and he took a moment to stretch his limbs.
"None of it is true!" defended Harry, although that wasn't the topic he was hoping to discuss with but there were some clarifications he needed to justify. He explained chronologically about his and Malfoy's detention issued by McGonagall and how he and Malfoy were stuck in a room together. He didn't know how he managed to tell all the information without stammering or blowing up, but he did. The two remained deadpanned as they listened, somehow making faces at the parts where Draco had curled himself to a ball and seemed to be terrified of the small space.
. He also heard some rumors from Slytherins about Draco associating himself with the Dark Lord, and Harry wouldn't be surprised if it was true since his father was a proclaimed Death Eater. Harry saw Lucius with his own two eyes back in the Triwizard Tournament, the day Cedric Diggory was murdered.
Harry reddened and snapped, "It's –
Harry settled uncomfortably and stared at Malfoy. He heard Malfoy murmur something incoherent, and for a moment, the blond's eyes fluttered open, in obvious pain, eyes glazed. Harry pressed the back of his wand hand. Harry felt his skin sizzled when it touched Draco's skin.
That voice was certainly Ron's.
"Oh, Mr. Potter!" said the clueless cheerful madam, and Harry was flaming inside with guilt. "You have Quidditch practice coming up, and you're the captain, I presume? I was informed by Professor McGonagall when I went to her office about your condition, so I asked Professor Snape for a strong healing potion for your quickest recovery." The madam held up a small vial. "Here, Mr. Malfoy, three drops on Mr. Potter's water. I have an important meeting to attend to! I trust you could be of assistance? And,
His voice was low and a few goosebumps had prodded out from Harry's skin. He explained to Draco how Harry found him in Myrtle's bathroom until he saw the mark on Draco's skin.
"Eat."
Harry hissed. "Do you want your lips swollen?"
"It doesn't matter if I skip my meals."
He’s been like that since this morning! He'd lost it," said Ron.
Draco shifted uncomfortably, face pink and glaring at Harry. "Potter,
If it's not for your doe-like eyes I really wouldn't help your arse," Pansy said . "Draco's a nut-job-type of complicated, Harry. He's like a riddle you could never solve unless you read all the things people had overlooked in all of the books they've read to find him out. He's
on Harry's crotch. Harry gritted his teeth, in the hopes of making the situation vanish along with his pathetic cock that pulsed -
Harry furrowed his brow, turned away and held his own neck as he walked out of the door. He really was warmer than his usual temperature. He couldn't smell anything but his own strong scent of musk even though he sniffed himself thoughtfully. Maybe Malfoy was toying with him but he might as well go to the Wing to make sure.
Arriving at Professor McGonagall’s office, he said the password, "
"What does she have to do with this? What do you mean?" Harry listened, not taking his eyes off Malfoy's back.
"Being
"It's the other way around!"
Just as promised Harry had eaten downstairs to the hall, plenty enough to make Hermione smile at him and lend him her notes off their first period after all their classes – there arriving dinnertime. Though before he could think of crispy bacon and mashed potatoes, he made sure he returned to the library for a better understanding of
A few seconds later, he had finally found his glasses and wore it back to his face, cheeks red. He stacked the books back to his arms before he stood to face the person he bothered the time of. And he gasped.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and stepped back. "Wizards tend to have some sort of distinct scent when they are sick. It's a technique Healers use to distinguish what kind of sickness a person may have. Was it a Curse? Natural sickness? A Hex? Aftereffects of drinking a potion that contained an ingredient you are allergic to? Healers do that, Potter.
Hermione was too quick to pick up what Harry might be thinking and said, “If you’re worried about Malfoy, don’t be. We'd keep you away from him. Luna Lovegood would be there if that eases you up."
Harry coughed to clear his throat and walked out from the Hall again. He didn't look back but he made his movements swift, not daring to peer past his shoulder to look at what reaction Malfoy made. His heart was pounding for no reason, and arriving at the dim depression-covered classroom of Snape's made his feeling worse. Snape was seated on the teacher's desk with his arms crossed, his movements telling Harry to not let his curiosity get the best of him and decide to touch all the ornaments and recipes scattered around the barely maintained and dusted classroom that smelled like spicy muggle condiments.
"The fuck?"
"Having a bit of fun by yourself, Potter?"
Harry was lost in thinking again. He was speechless and in no position to meddle with Malfoy's business, yet his disturbance about this sensitive topic was extreme.
Ten turns later, he halted on a dark corridor, letting himself breathe for a moment. Upon his recovery, he walked away through the corridor to come back to the Gryffindor tower. Turning left, his chest collided with another person, causing him to stagger backwards.
"Let me go, Potter. This is rather pointless isn't it? Nothing would change even if you punch me, or Hex me now. Everything would still remain the same, everything is still twisted as it is. Our faith is still rotten," Draco said.
"This is exactly what is wrong with you, Scarhead, poking your nose on other people's business while neglecting your own health." Malfoy crossed his arms smugly. "You're going to die at this point if you continue."
Harry's eyes widened. Why must it be him of all people? "Professor, it's Saturday and you know Potions is not my - "
"Good then."
who couldn't even last a year without letting shit happen in school."
“Hey, what are you doing? We can’t stay here, Potter. Kick the door too!”
"I promise," Draco said once more.
Harry's head ached more, not related to his hunger. "Why do you blame me for everything?"
"You love her."
change
. He wouldn't know he was shaking this much if Malfoy didn't hold him like this. "Was that necessary? Doing that? F-feeding me off your mouth?"
If Ron would be honest, this must be one of the effects of Harry's depression. Losing his Godfather Sirius hadn't been easy for his mental being and the knowledge of simply having to die before having the chance to win against Voldemort, the mad lad who had a killing spree when Harry could barely walk, is tormenting Harry to bits even though he hadn't told him or Hermione about it too much. Emotional support was all he could bring to his best friend, to express his brotherly-love as much as he could.
Harry sighed, sympathy tugging on his belly, remembering the first year Hufflepuff who helped him find Malfoy in the bathroom. At this point, it didn’t matter if they were enemies.
"Join me." Malfoy pursed his lips and did some sort of nervous gesture with his right foot, one violently tapping the ground. "I think it's better to have company while eating."
Draco arched his brow before he settled both of his hands on the table, preparing to sit down. Harry didn't appreciate that and raised one of his books, hoping he could smack Draco's head, but the blond didn't falter nor move away. Instead, he sat in front of Harry. Before Harry could retort, he was silenced by Draco's light-speed explanation.
And they were back to normal, Harry thought. "
"What?" asked Harry, confused by the sudden attention.
Harry would've glared if he had the energy, but exerting an effort, he saw Malfoy's eyes momentarily, almost brimming with... no, it can't be worry can it? Harry was annoyed and hungry. It must only be his imagination, or a trick of his own eyes. Harry tried composing himself again (for his ego).
It was observable that Draco Malfoy was the palest of them all. The only milk-skinned pray tell what product he used to have that type of complexion, lacking in melanin. He was dressed in a seemingly expensive black and fit clothing, the sleeves clinging on his slender arms. At the pit of Harry's stomach, there was insecurity somewhere in there because of his baggy clothes that was almost four years old, faded through time. He didn’t exactly know why Draco was still bothering his mind, making him insecure, but he didn’t want to think about it further. It only causes him  headache.
"If you want me to be honest, Potter, I feel baffled," Malfoy said, inclining with Harry's demeanor. He was a lot more poised this time. He was like his father because as far as Harry knew, Malfoys had their presence, a very strong one. "Speaking to you means having my ego thrown to the Black Lake, and I feel like I'm disgracing my family - especially my father."
"If you have plans of staying at Hogwarts for Christmas. Do you want to spend time with me?"
"If –
Draco's ears reddened in return. "I might as well throw myself to the Black Lake rather than get a full blast of your queerness."
"Potter."
Draco Malfoy had his back propped to a wall, a painting of a maiden behind him complaining of his hair covering her frame. Draco's hair was masking his forehead that softened his intimidating, prominent features, still as pale as ever, both hair and skin. He was all casual and warm in his black cloak, styled with a shiny belt that emphasized the slimness of his waist. Harry couldn't help but blink ten times to assure himself he wasn't being delusional.
"Just promise you won't and will
"Now, Potter," Malfoy bit on his apple, eyes fixated on Harry's green eyes, "go on, ask questions, I feel good-hearted today since you're weakened and it feels really good."
"Y-yes, I was... worried," he admitted.
"No! And I told you you could leave already right?"
Harry realized he stared at Malfoy too much and didn’t miss the pink hue pooling on Draco's cheek. Rolling his eyes to cover his embarrassment, he swiveled his head down and stared with intent at the book, his stomach aching.
"I wanted to talk to you." Harry would've scratched the back of his head if Malfoy had let him raise his arm. "But under our circumstances, normal talks aren't in both of our agendas."
Harry's breath restricted as Draco pressed on his chest further. He certainly didn't expect he would be cornered like this, but he could try to be... civil.
Shrugging, he closed his eyes, letting the side of his head rest atop Draco's own nook. He found their state ridiculous, but at that ridiculous moment, he wished that he and Malfoy wouldn't have to get on each other's throats all the time. Just… actually be friends like Hermione and Ron. He was given a chance to befriend Malfoy in the train, but he didn't – all because Malfoy had shown his awful attitude, and now they're life-sworn enemies.
said progress went straight to the abyss of misery in a blink of an eye because everything that happened between them during the break, like a fever dream, was forgotten a week after being out of their vacation, horribly flooded with second term's requirements with their
He received another smack from Snape's rolled paper because of the noise associated with heavily-stirring and took another set of five points from Gryffindor. Deciding it was best to focus on his and Ron's half-brewed potion, he looked down and chopped some of the ingredients remaining for him to do, face falling to a frown throughout the session.
on the map, pitter-pattering through at the same time. Draco was complaining something about the unimportance of doing rounds in the morning as a prefect.
"M-Malfoy. Your stab last week." Harry gulped a large amount of saliva. "Did you – do that to yourself?"
“Just go ahead to the wardrobe first, and I’ll follow,” said Harry.
"No," Malfoy drawled flatly, swatting Harry's arms away from his shoulder. That action alone made Harry feel a little hurt, but not sure where that emotion came from.
After their classes ended, Harry, along with Ron and Hermione, plucked a good amount of food off the hall, always except for Harry who barely get a fistful of anything, then went upstairs to eat in the warmth of their Common Room. The three of them sat on the large red carpet on the floor, encircling their food, and Harry, like the usual, didn't listen to them that much, having a world of his own.
for a while to see if you would need an extra day here or if you could be discharged in a few hours. Five points to Slytherin, Mr. Malfoy. Your knowledge in smelling sickness helped me to know what procedure I should do faster than usual. Very good!"
, please. No more trousers and Nifflers. Move on."
Malfoy turned his head away. "Get back to working please, and wear some protective charm. I don't want my grades to be badly-affected by you, so cooperate."
"Don't tell me you have been locked before? Those rumors were true?"
one in public?"
Harry felt himself redden. He couldn't say that he skipped dinner because he wanted to avoid Malfoy and think of ways to cope from his usually-occuring nightmares, by all means not eating.
Malfoy was on the floor, sitting and bleeding all over. He seemed to have been stabbed right on the side of his stomach with a knife. Who would do this?
"Yes, actually, I want to say something," Harry started, breathing evenly for the first time since he entered the room. "I was suddenly ignored and avoided after those two weeks we were friends. I needed an explanation."
according to Harry. Ron dropped being concerned about this certain obsession of his best friend, but sometimes, Harry tends to be too much, in fact, even at dawn and dusk he would risk the idea, just to see if his theories about Malfoy were correct.
"Fuck you, Potter," said Malfoy, vanishing off the room as the door slammed shut behind.
He trailed his fingers on the scarred arm, heart pounding. There was a lot more to the skin when he pushed the sleeve up, revealing a much worse-looking mark way up his arm. A skull with a slithering snake down to the length of his arms. Chill ran down on Harry's spine when he saw it up close. He couldn't help it. The mark was so familiar that there was no way he'd forget it. It was the same mark he saw on all the Death Eaters' arms in the day of the Triwizard Tournament, Voldemort's followers squeezing him to his near death.
"You go fetch the pail and cloth from the cabinet and I’ll go get the detergent, these are all what we need," Draco said blandly, face saying he didn't want any conversation with Potter besides cleaning.
Draco huffed. "I just hate you that much, yes." He wiped his mouth with a tissue paper this time and walked away.
Perhaps there was nothing wrong with trying.
Potter?" Malfoy was smirking, his voice rugged right on the ridge of Harry's ear that must've been his attempt to sound arrogant.
Harry clutched on Malfoy tighter, whole body feverishly hot as Draco kept playing with his arse. When he seemed to be bored of it, he slapped the two plumpy soft cheeks with both of his hands. Harry swore the ring would've created a temporary dent on his skin there. He yelped, punching Malfoy reflexively on the chest from shock. No one slapped his arse before like this. Not that it felt good.
The Slytherin blushed and looked away from Harry, and that was the most amusing reaction Harry has ever seen from him. Getting under Malfoy's skin had always sated his satisfaction and this was no different than the teases they shared throughout their years of studying together.
"Really?" Ron snorted. "That swamp of a pool? Mate, you didn't get infection or something, did you?"
"I know."
"Madness," Malfoy said raspily and Harry's face reddened, his own hands resting on the broadness of Malfoy's chest almost clenching at the cloth there. Harry didn't know why he's wobbling but it must be from dizziness, not because he was intimidated being naked
Harry buried his chin on his knees to seem smaller and kept his gaze on the floor, trying his best to look uninterested. His heart was beating so fast he couldn't hear the crowd. He knew how Truth or Dare games went in some muggle parties held every after Dudley's birthday party where he was forced to listen from upstairs. It was wild, exposing truths and daring someone to do something so bold. Harry couldn't handle it.
"Potter, what the
Gryffindor Harry Potter," said Malfoy.
" said startled Ron. "Bloody hell I didn't notice you didn't eat at all."
"Dilly-dallying in a very fine morning, Mr. Potter? What are your glasses for then?" Snape looked at him like what a normal person would look at an insect, and as usual, the Professor looked brooding and revolted of knowing a Potter still exists to this day. Harry composed himself for a moment. This was not a perfect time to let Snape add to his list of triggers this morming.
Malfoy threw him a scornful glance, not at all sorry for his action. "Neck is one of the weak points of a human body and Healers found out that weak points emit the strongest of scents, and what would you respond if someone asks you to smell your neck? Knowing your Gryffindor arse, you'd blast me off this room without using your brain! Better sniff than never."
"You are such an easily-swindled fuck." Draco pushed Harry's legs to sit between the space of it as he watched Harry sit, barely moving from hunger. "I want to tear you down and make you miserable all your life. That's what I really want."
"Oh, ye don't need ter pay me. I can bake ye, Harry, Hermione and Ron lots anytime ye lot want it. I gotta try making the cupcakes soon.
Basing on the cuts, Draco must've tried removing the permanent tattoo over and over again. It was all swelling and extremely scarred, little brown keloids and blotches of red patches are surrounding it already, and it looked horribly painful. Harry held Draco's hand firmly, sighing.
doing it made him feel odd. Was he fine with both man and woman? Harry couldn't tell but - he didn't mind both ways, nor did he ever think it was an issue. Only Harry preferred girls more.
. Malfoy smelled like damn apples. Harry was starting to sweat, and it was the softness of Malfoy's thin, girly lips that made him throw rationality out of his mind. He was bloody kissing Malfoy,
Harry, confused and mad and irritated with the unfair world, decided to avert back his attention to the discussion or else he'd get a big red
It was hard for him to utter something to a person he barely talked to properly.
Guess fucking what, I don't want you to be one because
As if a lightning had struck Harry, he remembered being reminded by McGonagall they shouldn’t close the door or they wouldn’t be able to get out. Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, striding back the farthest corner of the room and flopped down the floor, wading himself upon the cold wooden plank and closed his eyes, propping his head on his palm.
"And the Silencing Charm? Was that necessa - "
slow learners, Potter. He ensures they suffer in his hands. Now it shows who those snail-brained students are – I mean, you are included.”
"I said I wanted to monopolize you, not
Seamus said, and both Harry and Malfoy moved at the same time, their foreheads bumping in panic.
Hagrid guffawed, rattling half of his house's object. Draco sneaked in a taunting smile at Harry. "Oh! I forgot to tell ye! Ye gotta have
Harry's eyes narrowed. Given that Harry asked Malfoy's company for Christmas, he was thinking Malfoy would act more appropriately than this. "Let people talk then."
He watched Draco slowly release the tension off his own shoulder and looked Harry in the eye, unpredictable, but with a tinge of fear in it. Harry wasn't sure how he'd interpret Malfoy's expression but he could see that Malfoy almost broke his normal demeanor, an attempt to convey a reaction to the sentence Harry said.
? That’s preposterous. Why would they – ”
Now I feel awkward."
"That's when the shit happened? Getting seen and misunderstood?" asked Blaise.
“Yes."
"I'll keep this short and straightforward," Harry said, lowering his wand and cracking his neck before proceeding. "If it would have to be this way then, then so be it. You're up to something, just because I know you are, and I know that you know it."
“Let me guess, Potter. You, couldn't do this," Draco said, causing the whole circle to hoot teasingly. Harry clenched his fist, flustered. He couldn’t believe that his own housemates were cheering and betraying him like this. He apologetically glanced at Luna looking at him with worry before he answered Malfoy.
He hitched his breath when Malfoy removed his own hands out of his face, revealing his feverish-looking eyes. Harry's fingers unconsciously trembled, not wanting this odd situation more than Malfoy. He would sleep, alright… forget this happened, and return to their normal selves by tomorrow. Draco's heartbeats were felt by Harry's arms, and that didn't help the situation. They were
"The reason we got detention was because I
And Draco Malfoy's case wasn't any different from the second factor he just mentioned. The need for Harry to talk to him about what he witnessed in the Wing filled his mind and couldn't stop thinking of it. It wasn't his business, somehow, but then – what was that? Why was Draco Malfoy drenched in his own blood? Was his theory right about the suicide attempt or not? Harry wanted to find out, but not exactly knowing the method to use since this is a very sensitive topic to touch – very
trembled in his grasp before it cascaded to the floor, creating a startling sound. To his inconvenience, his glasses flew either, joining the fallen books.
Draco drew in a deep breath. "You ask me what I want..." Harry opened his eyes and found the blond hunkering down to level his face with Harry's. He looked

" then continued with his discussion.
After a few minutes of contemplation, he then told them what bothered his mind these days, excluding the bits of Malfoy kissing him inside an empty room. He focused on telling all the nightmares and odd visions of Voldemorts that were barely comprehensible to connect together, but also included bits about Malfoy the other day where Harry and Malfoy fought and ended up throwing themselves together in the disgusting, slimy water of the pool an the Clock Tower Courtyard right after they've found themselves walking their way together towards the bridge to get themselves the hill's fresh air.
fucking dare."
Harry almost vomited all of his breakfast that consisted of porridge and hard-boiled eggs. What the fuck was Malfoy thinking? "
Harry groaned, hands twitching uncomfortably. He vaguely remember something about Malfoy saying he would rather kiss his enemy than apologize. "Do you really mean that, or you got that thought off your nose alone?"
After they finished reading, they left the library and started chatting on their way to the Transfiguration classroom. Harry was glad they insisted for him to continue talking about Malfoy's incident, the three of them making theories as to why he was on the floor in a pool of his own blood. Ron said the knife that stabbed Malfoy wasn't a form of self-harm ("I think the knife is bewitched. Knowing Malfoy having too many enemies, anyone would want to kill him!") while Hermione differed from Ron's theory, similar as to what Harry thought of originally: an attempt of suicide. She said she had seen Malfoy herself go alone in Myrtle's Bathroom several times in a foul mood, blasting the door open and barely noticing her passing by, witnessing his dilemma.
rumor spreading across Hogwarts like plague. And days later, he still found himself in the same situation with Malfoy, who was suffering as much as he did. They haven't exchanged any Hexes or insults since.
“Look, Malfoy,” Harry said when they arrived in front of the wardrobe. “I didn’t know what was Abbot's motive, but I’m just going to remind you that I don’t
"It's Saturday," Ginny said, and the Gryffindors started laughing the loudest laugh they could produce. Harry swiveled his head around to look at everyone for a moment and he realized
Hermione winced. "
Harry looked at Malfoy's face right after he said that to confirm it was fine, chewing his lower lip harshly it almost bled. And he saw it. The glint of excitement in Draco's eyes, mixed with fear, hesitation and confusion.
"A Ravenclaw doesn't want a Slytherin ten minutes late, Potter."
It didn't make Harry feel better. In fact, he thought he was going to be sick thinking of him and Malfoy being sweet and
"You and your ways to get to me. So you've successfully captured me through the usage of seduction, lighting up my carnal desire.
Without a warning, Harry stood up from his seat. He drank his tea in one swift gulp, dropping it to the table. He looked rather fidgety.
He was now unfortunately experiencing a heavy breakdown, and he was too scared to admit the weakness pouring out his system at the moment because Malfoy was right. He shouldn't be disappointing his friends.
“Malfoy,” he called, then tugged on Draco's sleeve. Draco slapped his hands off him and plucked his wand out. He thought Harry was going to attack, but he didn't. Harry wasn't just about to do that. Realizing the ridiculous pose, he coughed and gave Harry a chance to talk.
Malfoy wore his fake smile, the one that Harry hated. "Bad
It was the oddest two weeks Harry Potter had ever experienced in his life. He was happy, of course, and it was weird enough when who brought him that euphoria was Draco Malfoy.
Harry seemed to have been triggered by the word 'Malfoy' and looked Ron in the eyes, eyes flicking fire that it took Ron a moment to swallow his oat. He didn't like it when Harry did that, he was scary, the ones that made girls intimidated and at the same time, liked him more. They liked anything mysterious like Harry, and his best friend wasn't aware he's a heartthrob, waiting for Harry to notice them and get him to bed.
Malfoy had his own support hadn't he? Parkinson? Zabini? His mum? He didn't really know about that since he barely knew Malfoy aside from what he looked like and what he portrayed in public. They weren't even close to being acquaintances, so he never knew anything clear aside from Draco's whole name and house he's in.
"Hagrid, this is some fine baking," Draco said, practically mauling at the pound cake as he licked his chocolate-covered fingers. "It's better than my Grandmother Druella's recipe! I'll be honest that I prefer this."
"A hundred percent yes," said Blaise. "Why
For thirty minutes, he circulated around the classroom and plucked vials he found, showing it all to Malfoy one by one and made him check what the ingredients were. Harry thought he would do all the work but truthfully, Malfoy only made him paw all the scattered vials off the ground and the blond was the one who mostly arranged it on Snape's shelf. For an hour, they got used to maneuvering around the room.

Malfoy, he walked straight to the Hall. The place still had surprisingly decent amount of students, not full but remarkably more than expected, knowing the danger the students may experience under the induced fear that Voldemort and his Death Eaters brought to the whole Wizarding World. He might miss Ron and Hermione during his break but won't dwell on it. He would, as always, manage to find some happiness around the castle, break a dozen school rules (under his dad's cloak) and do good deeds after like the old times.

Harry did think she had the right to be mad. He was mad at himself too for exceeding his temper that led to him and Malfoy having a fist fight. If
"Let me push you off when I get my strength, it won't be long for the potion to take effect," Harry suggested with a soft voice, and it seemed to help calm Malfoy down since he had let himself fall heavy on him, face on the crook of Harry's neck.
"Oh, er, this?" Harry plucked the thinnest book off the middle of the stacked books and raised it to Draco's face. They were having a casual talk!
He stared up for a moment, seeing the expected person's face. He wanted to ask,
you, not avoiding you.
Malfoy gripped on Harry's shoulders and it caused Harry nothing but butterflies to run amok in his stomach. He might be going nuts because that wasn't supposed to be his reaction. He looked up at Malfoy, bewilderedly. Sometimes he wished he knew what Malfoy had in mind.
"I'm sorry again. No one deserves being asked that bluntly about seriously personal things." said Harry, almost forgetting to breathe. "Please accept my apology."
"I see."
After a few minutes, Harry did not miss his instinct telling him that someone was staring at the back of his head this whole time he was temporarily focused on Potions. He looked around the dim room, to find who it was that was plotting to antagonize him. His eyes narrowed, realizing who it was and should've realized it sooner.
Malfoy sighed and disentangled himself off Harry completely, sitting at the side of the bed. "It wasn't a big deal, Potter. All I can tell you is that
Draco furrowed his brows and Harry's eyes widened, but eventually his lips curved upwards and momentarily, Draco got confused as to why that was Harry's reaction. He flinched when he realized this had something to do with what he said last.
Ron and Hermione seemed to had gotten that Harry didn't want to be talked to for a while, so they didn't bother him further, minding their own food instead. Satisfied and thankful for the small consideration, Harry looked around for a second, guiltily – left and right, and saw no blond wandering about the hall to antagonize him or Hex him.
He walked and walked per stall then eventually saw a pool of blood flowing like a water from a broken pipe. Harry dashed instinctively towards the blood's direction, heart dropping. He stopped his tracks when he arrived at the stall with the blood, he pulled the door carefully and gaped.
Draco’s smirk dissipated, not expecting Harry's sudden compliance and swiveled around to walk out of the circle. So, he was after all as scared as Harry to do the dare. He strode away and halted in front of a dusty-looking wooden wardrobe. Harry trudged defiantly, on the verge of puking.
anti-Gryffindor. Harry, disappointed but had more unfortunate situations in his life to be surprised by this, did the honor of casting a low-burning fire on the table and putting the pewter cauldron on top of the heat. Malfoy was doing the same, working and ignoring Harry. Malfoy grabbed the phial of what seems to be a poison off their working table and sniffed it, faintly chanting that identified and separated the ingredients of the poison after. Harry knew it was
Malfoy snorted at him, as if a response of letting Harry know he wouldn't believe the single lie he just said. Malfoy then cupped his own pocket, he must be attempting to feel his wand, yet basing from how his eyes widened, freezing on the spot, he seemed to have failed to find it.
That particular bothersome prick he was referring, to Harry's annoyance, seemed to be appearing everywhere in his line of vision, which made it harder for him to maneuver his way around the castle.  He declared days ago he would now antistalk Draco Malfoy, learn his schedule to avoid him, who, to his disappointment, had learned to observe Harry back the same way through the course of those three days. Draco would mock Harry, more aggressive in the middle of their rows. As if those weren't enough, sparks of Hexes would be thrown to Harry, always right on the shin or his poor bruise-covered shoulder from hasty first years who flunked their Quidditch tryout. Malfoy had grown fond of leaving Harry excess damage there, and wouldn't stop until it marked
"I wish to die," Harry said, letting Malfoy's warmth envelop him. "It's hard to pretend you are strong all the time. People have these
" and pushed the door briskly. He stepped forward and had let the cold and dim room envelop him, closing the door behind.
, your arm would be destroyed in a few minutes based on how those veins swelled beneath your skin easily, which indicates your skin was likely poisoned inside and out.
Harry felt his heart was beating so fast he might die on the spot.
Without another word, Draco fled out of the library with all of his things and Harry's adrenaline instantaneously reacted from it, calling Malfoy's name and continued trotting behind the blond. (Thanks to his leg muscles he developed over the course of continuous Quidditch practice, he was able to catch the pace of Malfoy's longer strides.)
And they stared at each other for a whole minute. Both of their eyes were filled with rage, questions, confusion and the need to understand things. Harry wanted to know all of it, but not in this circumstance, not as them being enemies.
. You smell off, like you're close to having Chronic Fatigue."
you too, Potter."
"You and your Gryffindor friends are a bunch of gits, you know that?" Draco said. "Making nonsensical and non-brain theories. What a bunch of
Harry nodded and didn't ask further, even though he couldn't trust Malfoy whether it was true or not since Malfoy was rather a notorious liar throughout the course of their stay at Hogwarts. Harry could only guess that Narcissa Malfoy's plan for Christmas involved visiting Lucius Malfoy in Azkaban bawling her eyes out for the rest of the break alone with him, shut out from the rest of the world.
not to act like an arse. We will try to - you know,
"I don't have any ulterior motives, Malfoy. And I've won our duel! Then after we could go back to our silly fights and childish insults with clear conscience. You should comply, because all in all you lost to me. And you're here for that."
Malfoy was right, he was being dumb and irrational but it was flowing from him naturally and he had lost the control to stop himself from lashing out. "I don't know why I'm mad at you for ignoring me. It used to be better for my peace when you fucked off. Now I don't want you gone!" Harry growled. "I want you as my friend and now you don't want to let me after all that?"
They stared at each other's eyes for a moment and Harry tried finding answers from just Malfoy's expression but failed. Draco looked like he was struck by lightning.
Parkinson's grin widened at the sudden enthusiasm, showing her perfect set of teeth. “Right! That’s more like it, Potter! We need more egoistic bastards like you around here. I know you’re looking for Weasley and Granger. They’d be here in a moment.”
"O' course lad! Em already rich ye know! Being here at Hogwarts is more worth it than any money. Yer smile was enough of a payment."
Harry's stomach grumbled again, and this time, he slumped down the couch from dizziness. He held his forehead to make sure his vision wouldn't have dancing stars in it. It felt like forever but Malfoy remained on his seat, staring at him rub his temple.
Harry kept calling his name, making sure Draco was in his line of sight. Harry dashed like his life depended on it and successfully clasped on Malfoy's shoulder. He turned the boy around, yanked him, and pinned him to a wall, causing the books in Malfoy's grasp to fall on the ground. Harry panted, sweat-licked from exertion and held Malfoy's shoulders steadily, squeezing it.
"I wasn't," Harry said, eyes back up stargazing. "I just - I don't know. It feels weird for me to sit beside you feeling relaxed." Harry fiddled his fingers, attentively listening to the chirring of cicadas to calm his nerves as he rambled on, sure that Malfoy was listening to him. "The first time we met, we were in a very unfortunate circumstance. We were kids, no firm stands in life yet and you were the least type of person I needed as a friend because you reminded me so much of my abusive cousin in the muggle house I grew up in - even if you did offer friendship. You look like a bully to be exact, and I hated bullies as much as I hate my cousin. I don't get why you hated me so much first rather than me hating you first. Somehow that hatred
"You seem looking for someone," the girl said. "Cheer up, you. Draco's not packed yet."
that I'm talking about," Harry said. "It is about you with me through this two hell of weeks since you seemed like you'd embarrass me through it, and get off on torturing me."
"Where are you going?" Ron asked, although he had an idea where to and
he was right,
Harry snorted. He got his Firebolt from Sirius, and cherished it dearly because it was one of the most important things to him, not because of its price but for the person who gave it to him.
Swallowing, he answered a brief, "Sorry," and went back to eating.
Lonely and confused? He was smiling when he was with Harry, almost enjoying himself. "What should I do?"
your system, take your life,
are you deaf?"
"But Malfoy - "
Shocked and dying, Harry dipped his head down and consecutively shoved spoonfuls of porridge onto his mouth despite his lack of appetite, face warm from embarrassment.
"Could you please eat?" Ron urged, nudging Harry lightly who was paying no attention to him and his surroundings. He pushed Harry's bowl and poked him one last time, hoping for his attention.
If it wasn't for the rather friendly competition they had, Harry wouldn't discover that Malfoy's eyes had a way of excessively tearing up when he's too happy, or how fast Malfoy was with morping his facial expressions that suited his current feeling. Even how Malfoy's forehead crinkled when he's disgusted. How his cheeks pink down to his neck when embarrassed and how Malfoy run his fingers up through his hair back to place when he's nervous. Especially how he looked at Harry so unnaturally piercing when he's excited and challenged. It all brought chill to Harry's spine, knowing they were going somewhere beyond the line of their established rivalry.
Draco didn’t respond anymore, lost for words. The two of them remained in their odd position for a seemingly interminable night and surprisingly comfortable silence: sitting together, with Draco curling to his side, listening to the sound of the calm blow of the wind from the outside. Harry's eyelids were starting to droop, completely sated despite knowing Malfoy was the one in his arms. Harry yawned after, snuggling closer to Malfoy who seemed to have fallen asleep first, comfortably pressing his head on Harry’s chest.
“She gave her stop signal minutes ago.”

book in the library with Ron and Hermione, solemnly having their head down as if praying in their own books. Harry hoped he could do the same, but the twists and turns of his stomach prevented him from doing so. He was hungry, that is, but then again, he skipped his lunch thirty minutes ago and went with his friends to use their remaining lunch time in the library for their fourth period's test. Annoyingly, his stomach made a loud noise, resulting in numerous heads turning his way, getting soft chuckles by it.
"No, sir. I'm sorry, sir." Harry blinked for a second and looked down.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes. "Fine by me, you really want to know the truth?"
"AAARGH!"
and has the
we see him. Alright?" Harry said, as if finalizing a remark of their "agreement". They talked as if a contract was binding them, but truly, the sole purpose of this (Harry thought) was to fully reconcile with Draco Malfoy, and Malfoy agreed to the unspoken attempt of Harry to be friends with him - at least acquaintances if all else failed.
A whole minute passed before Malfoy responded.
"What?" Harry asked in a haze and his eyes widened when he found Malfoy was no longer hunkering down at one of the bottommost part of the shelf. He was now beside him, inspecting Harry like a specimen and sniffed his neck in one swift motion. An overwhelming scent of apple wafted through his nose and Harry shuddered from the cold touch of air caused by Malfoy's breathing right on his collarbone. He pushed him in reflex but then he remembered Malfoy had an unfaltering strength.
"We don't think you're fine. You skipped dinner last night again, and I found you studying past bed time, that's
- now we're two blokes sitting close to each other talking about childhood -
"Potter, your trouser - "
The Slytherin yanked Harry upwards and pushed him to the dusty couch Harry previously sat on. He raised the apple he held dearly and moved forward towards Potter who had his eyes closed. He leaned to Harry again, shaking him and the Gryffindor could only hitch his breath.
in front of everyone - even in front of me."
. She needed her son's company more than ever. Malfoy, being family-oriented that he was, would obviously choose his mother over anything.
Draco sighed, not turning around to face Harry. "Well I love you, Potter. What am I supposed to do?"
After, he stepped back to inhale and looked at Malfoy. He saw crystal clear that Malfoy's eyes were widened, as if not expecting for Harry to apologize for the second time. As for Harry, he wanted to let Malfoy see he was genuinely sorry.
"Please listen."
Draco's cheeks pinked, but he didn’t look like he welcomed the feeling of it so he huffed and raised his pointy chin, back again to his default self.
"That's what you get for skipping meals, Potter."
"Harry
Or could it be... Malfoy? He didn't want that to happen to Malfoy, or to any other people in Hogwarts.

you, Malfoy."
"Malfoy is one of my best Potions students, Mr. Potter. If you would not be enough of assistance, then you two could work together. Go straight to my classroom.
Harry groaned. "Did that happen to you and him ever so often? The type of interaction that somehow bothers him?"
"I’m leaving!" Draco pivoted around towards the door and Harry didn’t stop him. He hunkered down and propped himself down the floor, pressing his back on one of the shelves. He closed his eyes, deciding he should rest before leaving but he jolted back to wake when a sound of a foot kicking a door startled him.
potion better than Malfoy, he used Malfoy's work as an example to the class instead of his.
"Don't look so sorry, Potter. There are
back to how it used to be. Malfoy didn't look at him when Harry greeted him, nor showed fondness when Harry attempted to slip in a small talk when Malfoy walked the same direction as him to any of their classes they shared. He also attempted to join Malfoy and Pansy the other day in a casual conversation about how their classes had been but Draco only pretended Harry wasn't there and he felt so mad for it. He has the right to – Harry was betrayed.
Draco glared at Harry first, as if saying he was stupid, before peering his head inside the door again. Harry flinched and instinctively stepped sideways to stay away from Malfoy's personal space.
"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
"Hey," Harry said, scratching the back of his head. He was terrified of being rejected himself, but he would risk it. "D-do you... I mean on Holiday, do you have - er, plans?"
Without a moment too soon, Malfoy was kissing Harry like it was their last time, pulling Harry to himself hungrily with a growl, hands shamelessly running over the skin of Harry's back, waist and arse. Harry cupped Draco's face in return, holding it in place for him and bloody not caring where his glasses landed on to, kissing Draco back with the same eagerness. He could taste and feel everything on fire, telling him that this

Harry felt tired, though he gave his nod and closed his eyes. Shy, flustered, mad and mushed up altogether he couldn't take it.
daft."
And with the same password as the office door, Harry pushed the trophy room open. The two of them coughed as fogs of dusts ghosted out from the inside. Harry held his breath for a moment and outstretched his hand inside to find the switch for the bulb. When he found it, light flooded the room which revealed a very dusty room full of stoppering trophies and crawling spiders. Harry's nose twitched.
, closing the gap between them, dangerously looming over Harry's smaller figure. Watching Harry freeze from shock, he pressed himself on Harry's body
Being up high in his thoughts resulted in a harsh rolled paper being slapped at the back of his neck. He peered past his shoulder to see who did it, eyes twitching from the sting and saw Snape, looming over like a tall building.
"Malfoy, let me go!"
"That's it!"
yelled Harry and catched the wand off Malfoy's arm that flew towards him. Malfoy was panting hard, his knees tempted to fall firm to the ground, and Harry was the same sweat-licked person. It was getting boring. They've been at it for ten minutes and Harry was getting cranky, wanting a little more spark to make the thrill in his veins last longer. But it was dissipating, same as the crowd they managed to form around them.
The blond's shoulders relaxed, or at least his attempt to be. "I just saw, okay? The way you look at her. You always looked at her in a way your eyes sparkled as if she's everything. Potter, I hated her."
should've been reading! Take note that it wasn't my job to remind you,
Ron and Hermione shushed all the Gryffindors (
Catching Malfoy's eyes, he gritted his teeth, which was responded by a quick flinch of Malfoy's upper body after Harry caught it. But to Harry's annoyance, Malfoy easily moved on over the sudden look and was now smirking at Harry, teasing and devious and all the things that make Harry's stomach churn in fury. Harry gritted his teeth instinctively and aggressively stirred in his and Ron's base in the cauldron.
He carefully studied Malfoy's next movements with a racing heart, and when Malfoy didn't move due to obvious confusion, he continued to fill the silence, "I'll be staying in Hogwarts for the Christmas break just as always
"Filch must've smelled your - "
"Well, I'm sorry."
Harry had urges to ask some Slytherins where could he be, where Malfoy had gone onto plunging on some danger, but that would look like he was concerned of Malfoy's being, so he didn't. Clenching his fist, he strode out of his finished class (History of Magic, which made him nod off and have an urge to create a slumber party with all the houses from Professor Binn's teaching) and looked around.
Ron's eyes softened, remembering those moments Harry woke up sweaty all over his neck, shouting half-conscious about a murdered man and other killings he never heard of where Seamus and Ron needed to assist him order to wake Harry up fully in the middle of the night, because he usually wouldn't wake alone, have random seizures and would accidentally do wandless magic in his sleep that had a tendency to harm everyone near him. It was a lot to handle.
"Formal?" Harry scrunched his eyebrows and stared at his chest and legs. He was wearing his robe normally and he looked decent enough for classes so there was nothing wrong with him. "What are you talking about?"
"Don't talk shit about Luna!" Harry watched blood drip off Malfoy's lips. His heart felt combusting and infuriated with every molecule that makes up Draco Malfoy.
"I should've ditched you, Potter," the blond said, looking at Harry again who was fuming more at Malfoy's words. "I was supposed to have a make-out session with a Ravenclaw after classes, and I told her we should cancel due to
Draco seemed to have curl against Harry and he closed his eyes, possibly becoming more uncomfortable than ever, realizing that his and Harry's personal space is too much occupied by each of them, too small, too privy, personal. One head movement, their noses would touch, their lips would collide - and it was terrifying for Harry to dive into that area of thinking in his brain. One heave, and they'd feel each other's breath. Harry winced, revolted by the possibilities that may happen.
"Potter," Pansy croaked, "you know, he didn't tell the both of us either about his stab. We tried to seek some answers as well. He kind of... shrugged us off and we didn't want to force him to tell us if he didn't want to. Were you that worried?"
Harry spelled himself dry when he felt the temperature increasing slowly on the touch of his skin. Malfoy was still quiet and vacant, but spoke after an interminable silence, moving closer to Harry.
"But Malfoy, you - "
"Don't
Harry looked down, stared at Malfoy’s curious eyes before answering. "Er, yes, when I was younger, my aunt and uncle would lock me up in a cupboard when I did something that irritated them. They won’t let me eat for a whole day too. I would cry nonstop then I’d talk to my figurines until I'm fine.”
They wiped their sweat off their faces first and spelled their clothes dry. Though Harry's heart wouldn’t calm down. It kept pounding, ordering Harry to talk to Malfoy, to address what happened this afternoon.
Pansy's eyes sparkled. "You can get his attention by shocking him, a one-way ticket to get him to look at you. He'll listen to you in no time."
"Your You-Know-Who visions, how is it?" he said, diverting the topic.
Harry mirrored her smile and shook the girl's hand timidly. "To you too
Draco glared at him, but eyes softened and oddly flattered it disgusted Harry.
Harry was about to throw his retort when his stomach churned again. His knees felt boneless and his legs' strength was escaping him. This time he was sure he had no strength left to get out a word to talk to Malfoy or open his eyes.
"You two are known role models of this school, Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy!" Professor McGonagall loomed over them, voice still trembling from shock. "A Quidditch Captain and a Slytherin Prefect fighting like children? I should’ve taken more points beyond thirty!"
"Fine! But are you... well?"
"Yeah, silly how this hadn't yet reached the

Harry's face heated, remembering his failed potion, broken glasses and lost five points. "Why did you bring that up? You were the one who dropped it in my cauldron and told Snape it was me! And – and, I'm
Harry's whole being trembled as he decided to go back to the room. He was boiling to a certain degree that made him throw himself at Malfoy and punched the smug look off of the blond's face. Malfoy was shocked but he couldn't care less. He
He stayed holding Malfoy's hand for he didn't know how long, but at least, even in Malfoy's sleep, Harry had offerred Malfoy the comfort he couldn't get when he's awake, letting the soft fingers get warmer and warmer in Harry's grasp. This was the type of comfort Harry wanted during those times he wanted someone to hold his hand in silence. Just holding hands, and lots of unsaid understandings.
He stood in the middle of the circle, clenched his fist. He clicked his tongue at Malfoy and asked Abbot, “So what do we do?”
Harry could sense his own blood boil and Malfoy was shaking, unidentifiable if from anger or from being on the verge of crying from fury. "Just tell me your reason, then okay! I could leave you alone forever for all I care. Just do this one thing and we're through."
Draco tried to maneuver his way out, craning his neck to seek a path to escape but Harry had already pressed his own back on the door, pounded on it, creating a startling sound. Draco jolted, stepping back.
someone eating breakfast with peers, possibly knowing that Harry was glaring their way but had chosen to ignore it, unfazed or couldn't care less of it because Gryffindors are unfortunately on the top of their most-ignored list. Ron shook his head, not in the mood for another game of
As soon as he flickered his eyes in front of his way, he saw Malfoy's blond head at the far side of the dim room holding a book, flipping the pages with his index and middle finger. He was wearing green silk pyjamas. His posh appearance could never compare to the rugged look Harry had while wearing his baggy pyjamas he got from his cousin Dudley in first year. Draco always stood out with his blond hair.
Thoughtfully, he shouted, striding towards Malfoy who gathered himself like Harry, "Malfoy, I want a deal!"
"Didn't work, I say!"
"Sure, I'd... talk to him. I'll try."
He could go to the Weasleys anytime for Holidays, or at Grimmauld Place if he's feeling wanting to be alone for Christmas with Kreacher as his company. But this time, he wanted to stay at Hogwarts, visit Hagrid, play chess with someone, fly his broom in someone's company, tend to Hagrid's creatures, practice his wand attacks for future purposes of becoming an Auror. He could all do that with Malfoy, and not as a replacement for his best mate, Ron.
Malfoy's low and hushed voice did wonders to Harry's stomach. He stared at Malfoy's eyes for a moment, defiant at first, trying to make something out of it, decipher it, read the greyness of the git's eyes that glared at him fondly for the past five years but he couldn’t. Malfoy was professional at masking his real emotions.
interaction, because now, Malfoy wouldn't meet Harry in the eye, and was quick to vanish from the scene to avoid the hoots they kept getting once spotted in a same room wherever in Hogwarts. Unfortunately, in some classes, they were paired up and needed to deal with each other, especially in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
The blond wasn't doing any of Harry's assumptions so far. After a few minutes of a painfully interminable silence, a feathery-light thing had touched Harry's lower lip that made him flick his eyes wide open instantly. Draco was,
the dare. Don't act oblivious.”
The broom cupboard was the only place he could think of since it was the space where Rita Skeeters had questioned him in his fourth year: The
"What's it doing to you?" Malfoy hissed, still confused at Harry's now reddened face comparable to an overripe tomato. Malfoy rolled his hips again, and this time, Harry moaned involuntarily. It was a reaction formulated out of the intimacy of the position, and not because it was Malfoy who was
Harry's lower lip couldn't help but tremble. "You should've reminded me!"
"Since Malfoy's a new guest. Let 'im have the honor of eating the cake first!" Hagrid boomed, setting the plate directly on Malfoy's lap and Harry could only hope for the best Malfoy's teeth wouldn't break, stomach churning at the image. Malfoy looked at Harry as if asking for a silent help, but Harry urged a hand instead, reassuring him it wasn't poisonous, though not promising it was edible.
"Yes, Madam Pomfrey," Draco responded, and Madam Pomfrey looked like she patted the boy's head mentally. Harry knew better, because he saw Malfoy clench his fist behind his back, and Malfoy was not too
Draco's face twisted, a face that said he was either forcing himself to agree or was just having a bad day of stomachache. Harry already got his answer based from it.
"Fuck this." Malfoy tugged on his own hair and hunkered down the ground as if throwing a tantrum. Harry stared through the whole scenario. It lasted for a few minutes before Malfoy stood up with a more composed look but hands still visibly shaking. He seemed to be uncomfortable facing Harry so turned his back at him. "Luna Lovegood."
Harry's laugh settled down, half-shaking to compose himself, settling at the idea of not to annoy Malfoy further. "Mind you, we are not evil-minded snakes. Also, is your shin fine now?"
“Right this is completely pointless." Harry stepped forward, almost cornering Malfoy on a shelf. "Forget it! No more pleasantries."
The same panic had shown in Malfoy's face but was calmer compared to Harry's bubbling mad reaction. "
at the table and asked Harry questions here and there when they decided it was best to sit in front of him, pushing Seamus away, but none of them received proper answers from Harry. It seemed that they finally noticed Harry didn't want attention at the moment so they resumed talking (with Ron changing the topic to legendary Quidditch matches between Montrose Magpies and Ballycastle Bats without involving Harry, which was highly-appreciated).
"Okay, come here already."
Harry nodded, holding a rather feral magical frog in his hand, screaming at his touch. He could feel Ron and Hermione staring at the back of his head giving curious gazes. "I know, but if you could give me a hint of how to make him talk to me,"
. Malfoy was left gaping, and Harry was victorious.
Harry drew in a deep breath. He arrived at the library and looked for the books that he needed. He walked to the familiar bookshelves and stacked heavy books in his arms until the height reached his chin – and now he was almost wobbling. When he managed to turn around to return to the table, his books had certainly hit someone on the chest since the figure groaned. The books –
"As you can see, I'm trying to
"Potter, for the record, we are
"I don't appreciate it, but thanks."
They’ve started cleaning diligently. Neither of them spoke to each other unless their exchange of dialogues was  cleaning-related. Malfoy spelled the cloths to clean the trophies one by one with an articulate swing of his wrist while Harry did all the organization, placing the trophies in the shelves one by one with hands since he was more used to physical labor.
"One could try, Malfoy."
Draco's mouth curled teasingly, and Harry was furious. "Interested?"
The brief silence meant Draco must’ve remembered it as well as soon as it was mentioned to him. “Wait… No, no, no, you don’t understand. You of all people should know being contained in a room with someone you hate is – "
Harry's eyes widened, eyes trained on Malfoy's - mostly strucked by his words. Before Harry knew it, tears streamed down his cheeks and laid back to his bed to cover his face.
it, he proclaimed. The inevitable karma he got for being too meddlesome of Malfoy's personal life.
Tuesday morning arrived and his face could already match the paleness of a pasty-skinned vampire, the bags under his eyes were comparable to the size of Hagrid's thumbprint. He walked down the Great Hall with tired, snail-like footsteps, looked for Ron and Hermione's usual spot and sat between them, burying his face on the table like his body was the heaviest thing he was carrying. Ron, who was first to greet him, nudged him his breakfast bowl and Hermione next, pouring him a glass of choco milk.
Draco's eyes widened and looked at a spot on the ground. A blush had crept on his pale cheeks and Harry, freezing himself, realized why. His sentence sounded -
"I'm not," snapped Draco, crossing his arms and Harry saw in his face the uncomfortability to spill more of the words that were obviously about to burst from Malfoy's mouth. He supposed Ron was right when he said about Malfoy not wanting to feel indebted to him, and was now doing it to make himself feel better about spatting insults to Harry.
"Y-your hips."
Malfoy shot Harry a look that was none other than a glare, a softer version of what he usually gave Harry - which was always immensely sharp, a trademark of some sort. His face was pinking up and Harry only raised his eyebrows, still awaiting Draco's answer.
To Harry's dismay, Malfoy's eyebrows conjoined, head swiveling to look at Harry with a glare and calculative look. "Potter, stop burning holes through my skull. If you have something to say, then out with it! You're acting really odd."
Harry's ears turned horribly red after he heard that and shoved mashed potatoes in his mouth without breathing. That was the most disgusting thing he heard since the spreading of rumors he and Dumbledore were fucking in secret so that he could win the whole Gryffindor the House Cup every year - and Malfoy being behind all of the damn rumor that led them both to detention with Mcgonagall for disrespecting Dumbledore.
Harry's face dimmed, looking away slightly, and Ron knew he asked the
Harry prepared himself, stood straight with alertness as he waited for Malfoy to pass through so he could stalk freely. He braced his hands, hunkering down a bit as the Slytherin walked closer and closer towards him, holding his breath so he wouldn't be heard. He made himself smaller on the corner.
Harry blushed as he doffed his robe off in an instant, folding it to his lap in the hopes no one would remember the embarrassing event.
concerned."
Draco swiveled his head away.
?" Draco asked, head tilting in confusion and Harry's stomach churned. He didn't have the time to think this through, or what to say to Malfoy since this wasn't what he planned to do before his classes started.
Harry didn't respond anymore and carried on with his reading, blood pumping through him fast. He stopped all the urges to tell Malfoy off the library because any second his arm would raise and attempt to blast Malfoy off Hogwarts all the way to the village down it. That wasn't a bad idea since half the population of the school would rejoice for his absence. Malfoy was just brave to mess him up in Potions because Snape favoured him in everything. Even at that time Harry's brewed
"You better be not thinking Malfoy!" said Ron. "Pointy git's been nothing but trouble to you lately. He wouldn't be able to Hex you now – 'cause,
"You."
"You four-eyed dolt! That doesn't make me gay. And it was a dare made by Abbot! Well you, you seemed to be satisfied moaning like a girl everywhere!"
Sighing, he realized he wouldn't try, because he would actually do it.
"Potter, do
"Five points from Gryffindor," said Snape familiarly before striding off to take his place back in front of the class.
"Ten points from Gryffindor." Draco's voice cracked, breaking the silence which Harry didn't understand why Malfoy said it so suddenly. To Harry, it looked as if Malfoy was trying to distract himself from Harry's face, to not be aware of it while he stared.
meant. Now, if you all could gather around in circle and play Truth or Dare with me, I’d appreciate it!" she yelled and everyone simpered excitedly, some murmuring their disapproval of the game, and some attempting to sneak off (the Hufflepuffs, Harry guessed) but the door was shut. Harry wondered if he's capable of opening it, just in case.
Walking pass the tables in a blur, Harry sighed and decided to sit beside Neville, and like all the other students, the Gryffindors' noise died down catching Harry on their vision. The atmosphere suddenly turned awkward and that alone made Harry want to Disapparate.
Malfoy was interested since, he too, seemed like want the fun to last longer. He crossed his arms as his eyes lit with small excitement. "Okay then, what might that be?"
"I’m just saying you would be a great Potions master if you pursue it," Harry said, and he wasn't joking if he says Malfoy was like McGonagall when teaching – that is, excluding the bits of Malfoy being childish who bully people off their rocker, he was rather a good mentor.
"Maybe."
"The hell with you, Potty. I'm out of here. This is utter nonsense."
obvious who you're thinking of. We have a test in a few minutes, tut tut! Let's talk about him later."
Arriving at the Gryffindor's sixth-year boy's dormitory, Harry sat himself to his bed, seeing that none of his housemates were left in their dorm. He rummaged for his cloak, then waded the folded cloth, wrapping it around himself and made his way all the way down to the Dungeons with the Marauder's map in his hands, avoiding every person he might bump on to. He's going to have to wait for Malfoy to finish his prefect duties in the morning, at the Viaduct, which Malfoy would surely pass by. At least after that, Harry could stalk him freely, without being seen but had the knowledge of what Malfoy was up to.
"I didn't expect you'd actually come," Harry said, sitting comfortably on his seat. "There once was a boy who asked me to have a duel with him in first year. I risked getting out of the Gryffindor tower such a late night, only to find none of the person who asked me
"You pansy, Potter!" Malfoy spluttered. He wouldn't be able to stand up when Harry was entangled with him. "The day couldn't get any worse, could it?"
"Better?"
are bloody stalking me, hiding in this bloody-what cloak. What the fuck is wrong with you?"
Harry lent his palm as the Healer handed him the phial. She squeezed his shoulder affectionately before scurrying and vanishing behind the large door, leaving Harry alone with a peacefully-asleep Draco Malfoy. He sighed, without a choice strode towards the side of Malfoy's bed and did all what was told.
He found himself relaxed, before sleep had dawned upon him and lost his consciousness.
He thought of Luna for a moment after that and explicitly blushed. Well since for so long already, harry never wanted the fame, glory and easy chance his faith had given him for being The-Boy-Who-Lived. Everyone only wanted him for his name and never for what he was inside. No one knew him enough or tried to know him for that matter. For now he just wanted to talk to Draco, clear up the tension between them and hear a bloody good explanation from Malfoy even if that would cost him his pride.
Harry chuckled, surprised he did it so unrestrained. He didn't know how long since he laughed like this with someone. "He's always hyper and vulgar with his words. Wouldn't restrict his mouth but he's the kindest person."
“Potter.”
" said Pansy, noticing Harry's flamed ears. "But you know, Potter. Er, the rumors, Draco never clarified you two did not, by any chance, do all the implied accusation."
"What do you think of me, Malfoy?" Harry asked while being drowsy from crying. He might as well ask since Malfoy wasn't too keen of pushing him away. Harry wasn't wearing his spectacles yet he could see the confusion plastered on Draco's face, as to why Harry asked such odd question. They looked at the deepness of each other's eyes for a moment, willing to be lost.
"I’m here to study," Malfoy broke the silence. "I believe you have the Potions book I wanted to read the most."
Draco's hand loosened its grip on his chest and slowly backed away, probably just now it caught him how close he was to Potter's personal space and stepped further back. He then nodded, urging Potter to go on and have his momentum.
Harry's heart skipped a thunderous beat. He wasn't wrong about his assumption with Blaise. Harry looked down and blushed. He had let the two quiet down first before he explained.
what I saw." Harry raised his head along with his wand. "Your father is a Death Eater."
“Sorry to burst your bubbles, Harry but I dared Draco to make out with you in a wardrobe until I say stop.”
Harry scowled, anger bubbling somewhere in the pit of his stomach.
And to Harry's further satisfaction not caused by the pound cake, Draco smiled widely at Hagrid and sipped on his steaming tea, clinking teacups with the half-giant. Malfoy may have not shown it, but it was striking on his face that Malfoy rarely received affection and was happy to accept Hagrid's.
Both of them gazed sharply at each other for a moment before nodding at the professor simultaneously.
"Calm down, Malfoy. You should - "
Harry gulped, swallowing the remnants of his embarrassment before he called Malfoy. When Malfoy turned around, he exploded.
"So," Harry cleared his throat, "I wasn't exactly stalking you, I was trying to get you to talk to me about some
Harry didn't know how it happened, but he was suddenly pinned down on a bed with both of his hands suffering the restraints of Malfoy's grip with his weight on top of Harry as they kissed passionately. Harry, pleased by how Malfoy's hair looked unkempt again, had ran his hands through the blond strands and rested it there as their tongues fought, Malfoy having the greater and stable control between them. Harry yelped indignantly when the blond withdrew himself from him, still having Harry's arms pinned to the bed.
"FUCK YOU, POTTER!"
"I don't want to hear you thanking me. Just don't neglect your health like this. Weasley and Granger would be worried of you.
"Potter I don't need you and your explanation."
“I am so sorry I didn’t see you!” Harry said, hands seeking still for his glasses, patting the ground. He had no idea who he bumped with. “I apologize too about my vision, being poorly-sighted is an inconvenience!"
“Well? What are you waiting for, Potter. Christmas?
Pansy chuckled, cutting whatever Harry had in mind to say. Harry looked rather offended and angry at Blaise's last comment, though it was true. "I heard Draco say Potter is a martyr and pushy prick. I'm seeing it now. I'll say he would get furious of Potter approaching him but... who knows? Draco is very unpredictable. He might kick you, yell at you or snog you senselessly. He's like that," Pansy said.
you down to the abyss of your darkest misery. You. Just everything of you. Is that answer enough?"
bloody getting away from it with his Prefect title.
percent chance he'd get a proper answer.
That earned Harry a vigorously loud and heavy smack on the shoulder as soon as they landed back on the ground, Malfoy winning two times and Harry winning three all in all. Harry had never felt so overjoyed with racing someone so whiny about losing to him and so arrogant in wrong moments. And mind everyone, this was
"How about I try?"
He suppose that was good, no student would be harmed by random Hexes that were originally meant for him. But knowing Malfoy, he never misses one of his breakfasts. He was strict with everything that he does, rules and Slytherin codes, and Harry found it odd. He really shouldn't be concerned about this, but he felt some uneasiness hanging on his stomach. Malfoy was prone to trouble, as much as Harry was he admits, and who knows if he might have been – or currently, in one again. There was a time he saved Malfoy from a couple of Ravenclaws who played with his breathing pattern to torture him in fifth year. That was too much, and so he acted about it immediately, and not because he had some serious Savior Complex. He didn't receive any thanks from Malfoy that time, but it was completely understandable since Harry was aware how much that helping affected Draco's ego.
"Parkinson!" called Harry. Both Zabini and Parkinson looked at him at the same time. "Could we..." Harry made a signal of opening and closing his hand.
," she greeted, eyes crinkling from the smile hidden behind her thick emerald green scarf wrapped around her neck.
expectations from me, and I did nothing but disappoint important people in my life.
Draco's eyes shook. Harry might have said too much, but it was all he could think of. All his pain and agony were suddenly on the verge of bursting off his body and projecting it all at Malfoy.
Malfoy did not hesitate to stand beside Harry and unfurled the paper on the table. It might be an illusion for Harry's part that he thought the blond was being gentle with him.
"Hey, stay with me, Malfoy. Can you hear me?" Harry asked, tapping his cheek lightly to check for responses and, gladly, Draco nodded. Relief washed through Harry's insides from the small response, because he didn't know what to do but to prevent the bleeding for a while.
and believed all it said. They were all rubbish nonsense, in Harry's opinion, having spies in the school and putting all information they could get from those spies so they'd have the reason for their newspaper to sell well, putting him on the front page. He was glad Rita Skeeters was gone – the articles could've been worse.
that it gave me sore eyes. I deduced you came here without letting food touch your lips. Suspecting your look and your wide eyebags, you lack sleep and food for days." He scanned Harry up and down, lingering at Harry's face the longest. "Then somehow at our duel, your pride kicked in and forgot you were weakened. Now you swagger here, using the remnants of your energy, then you just
. He never once saw Draco's good side, and if he had one at all. If he would think about it, he didn't want to hate Malfoy, if only the blond was a lot less like a prick in their first year, he would've tolerated Malfoy at some point in his life and become friends with him.
Harry's throat constricted, not really processing what was happening. He looked at everyone helplessly and only Abbot who offered him explanation. She was smiling, and Harry felt something so ominous about it.
"Mr. Potter,” said Snape calmly, hands dropping to his sides. Sniggers from the Slytherins arose in the air. They love it when Harry gets tormented by Snape.
Hermione's eyes softened. "Not here to scold you about your dropping marks –
near, but they just are.
"It's not what I want," Malfoy said more softly, face warping to an off-putting forlorn expression.
The girl smirked and she nodded at Malfoy, like some form of telepathy and signal Harry didn’t want to know. Draco, who seemed not bothered of everything, offered his hand to Harry noncommittally. He couldn’t believe Malfoy was okay with this, kissing him,
Harry drew in a deep breath first before nodding. That wasn't a bad of a deal but he was still in a situation where Malfoy was involved. He looked back at the circle and immediately turned furious when he saw Malfoy looking at him, impatiently tapping his foot on the ground. The circle wasn’t helping either, some are either cheering Malfoy, while some have blatantly disgusted expression written on their faces. Harry could relate.
wrong question to ask. "Well, it's the usual. Nothing changed."
"No. I did all the advanced procedures of unlocking doors, I did out-of-class spells too, but this won’t simply budge."
Harry glared weakly, but he considered the offer. It took him his pride and face to make Malfoy open up like this. After all, he enjoyed tormenting Harry. This was what he wanted, wasn't it? To talk to Malfoy? He turned his head away. He didn't know if Malfoy would make fun of him for his honesty.
He saw Draco bit on his apple, and was weirded out with the fact he had a
Draco snorted and crossed his arms, disbelief written on his face.
His body tingled for a moment, feeling his surroundings warp to where the room should bring him. He stilled and opened his eyes when everything seemed calmer around, revealing a heavily-detailed bronze door in front of him. He turned the knob with his heart on his throat, stepping inside carefully.
! I was bored the other day and decided ter buy me'self lots of good cookbooks and gave it a go. It was a ruddy mess practicing but I managed. Em glad Malfoy liked me first successful cake. Might as well make the professors."
And Harry was wearing his baggy trousers and t-shirt that made him feel like an utter outcast. Some students wore little to no clothing while he was the only one overly-clothed in a muggle's fashion. All the boys he saw were all half-naked and some of the girls were shamelessly showing their bras and undergarments except Luna who wore a tacky violet and yellow mixed dress that accentuated her difference from the crowd, making Harry's heart pitter-patter.
"Don't dodge me!" Harry gritted his teeth. It hurts. "Besides, you have me in your arms, I'm weakened and I'm at your mercy, I won't be able to move if you don't allow it. What could I do about that?"
Harry closed his eyes again and drew in a deep breath, feeling dizzy. "Before I drift off to oblivion. I just want to say you're a fucking piece of prat, Malfoy."
"I think my shin bumped on something sharp." Malfoy rolled his hips uncomfortably and that created some
personal. Harry wasn't exactly a complete sod to harass Malfoy for answers about that ("Malfoy, did you just attempted suicide?" he tried imagining but that would probably lead to a battle better than what happened between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald in 1945). But in any way, he knew Malfoy wouldn't tolerate him, if ever he knew Harry was creating an idea to find him out.
Harry trudged down to the Great Hall after doing his morning routine. As always, he ignored the greetings. This time, the students' stares were oddly longer than usual. Was it because he has crumpled face? Stubble here and there along with the ghastly remarkable bags under his eyes? He knew his body frame was thin, but his schoolmates never minded those, so why were they looking at him weirdly? Harry pursed his lips uncomfortably, determined to ignore everyone, including Ron and Hermione to avoid their daily nags about Harry neglecting his health.
"Potter." Draco raised two fingers, and Harry narrowed his eyes at the gesture. "How many fingers am I holding?"
. They like that crap!"
he'd asked out of curiosity and impulse...
"I don't know if I would be of any help to this but I admit I don't have enough brain power for Potions," Harry said.
Despite the content Harry feel for his best friends and his silly imagination, however, he was also feeling nervous as a codfish about to be hooked. He blatantly asked
Apparently it wasn't going well, to Harry's disappointment.
Five minutes before six, Harry went ahead to Professor McGonagall's office in his pyjamas. He didn’t talk to anyone through the course of the afternoon (since he stayed in the Hospital Wing for a good hour, getting his bruises tended with Malfoy) and finished his Charms assignments in his dormitory, avoiding Ron and Hermione at all cost.
"Well
"I don't care about what
"You held more secrets than I thought you would hold," said Harry softly.
"See? I'm real."
Harry could go back hating himself.
Harry drew in a deep breath, shook his head and ate the rest of his porridge silently with a disconcerted chest.
" he said, not accustomed to calling the girl by her first name yet.
The blond was about to breathe fire again for Harry's sudden motion when a sound of a door slammed on the wall, indicating Harry and Malfoy were no longer alone.
Harry nodded noncommittally, doing what he was told to do, preparing some of the ingredients, squinting to see the list on the board if he got it right and followed the instructions in the book at the same time of how to set up. He managed, at least, without exploding anything that smells of rotten aramantula or causing the base to create a completely different color that would eventually make Snape depressed than what he looked now.
