“‘M fine,” Harry squeaked. He tried to step back from Draco, but the lack of space in the closet prevented him from doing so. “Just claustrophobic.”
There was Harry’s first lesson in ordering. Rather than simply choosing a colour and then selecting the cheapest wine from that list, you were supposed to select a wine based on whether you wanted something with more or less tannins, flavour, depth...Harry would be lying if he said it hadn’t gone over his head.
It wasn't quite the same as Auror work, but apparently the Ministry looked down on 'needless acts of heroics' and 'mouthing off the government'. Still, Harry really thrived on helping students achieve their best, and supporting them to push through to levels they didn't think they could reach.
“I refuse to call it Nessie,” Draco said, after Potter asked him why he kept referring to the creature by its full name. “A silly story like that doesn’t need an even sillier nickname to go with it. Whatever this monster is supposed to be, I very much doubt it’s supposed to be cute.”
He pulled carefully out of Harry, casting a cleaning charm over the both of them. Harry pulled up his jeans and turned around to face Draco, who was adjusting his own clothing.
“What?” Harry said, his voice too strangled and high-pitched to sound normal. “I don’t keep staring at your, er…” he trailed off as Draco stretched his arms above his head, making Harry’s gaze drift downwards on instinct.
Draco’s eyes widened at her incredible perception, and he shared a glance with Harry who’d gone bright red.
Rapid change of subject must be a Malfoy speciality. Harry went along with it anyway, to ignore the gnawing guilt he felt for
Thus Harry had found himself staring at Draco’s crotch whenever he got the chance, both impressed and annoyed that Draco’s trousers were able to hide the beast that lay within them.
“Well, you’re certainly easier to talk to than the goblins; at least I know when you’re insulted me.”
Harry jumped about a foot into the air, not having heard anybody else in the library. He spun around with his hands in the air in surrender, and hastily lowered them when he realised what he was doing.
“Yes, it appears we have quite a lot in common,” Draco said, as Potter took the seat beside him. The cramped seating area meant that Potter’s thigh brushed against Draco’s, and it almost seemed like Potter was pressing harder purposefully.
Draco shook his head. “No, Pansy just said there was a group of us going and that I wouldn’t be a third wheel.”
“Why do you call me that?” Harry asked. Their mouths were mere inches away, and Harry wondered what it would be like to kiss Draco, there and then.
“Muggles know about poltergeists,” Harry said. “Not to say they all believe in them, but they’re not unknown by any means.”
“I don’t think the Loch Ness Monster eats anything, because it’s hard to eat when you don’t exist,” Draco said blandly, making Potter roll his eyes. “Just throw everything in, but be prepared to attract all the birds and fish in the area. Actually, don’t put meat in the water.”
Petunia huffed and handed over some Italian coins to him, before leaving without another word. Harry had no idea how to get to the village, so he supposed he’d have to ask one of the Malfoys or one of their staff for directions. He wasn’t stupid enough to hitchhike alone in a foreign country, so he hoped the walk wouldn’t take too long.
“Lakes are cold,” he said. “You’ll get used to it.” Then he strode past Harry, wading into the lake as though the temperature didn’t bother him in the slightest.
“Fuck off,” Harry muttered without malice. He coughed again and groaned, before casting a stealthily performed drying spell on his glasses.
“A draft then,” Draco suggested. “Or it just hadn’t been put back properly. A fallen book doesn’t constitute a demon.”
Dumbledore chuckled. "I couldn't have asked for a finer replacement. What can I help you with, Harry?"
The house inside looked like any other home, with a long entrance hallway leading to a staircase. Family photos lined the walls, and a vase of flowers sat on a mantlepiece in the corridor.
Draco gave Harry a wicked grin. “That little perv would be eaten alive by Pansy. As for me, I’m not quite so cruel. I apologise for disturbing your yoga, Harry, I’ll leave you to get back to it. Goodnight.”
“Couldn’t you work less? I’m sure you can afford to hire an assistant or two to give you some time off.”
"Unless I am simply unaware, or more have gone into existence since my death, the only portal to another realm which could be found in Hogwarts would be the Mirror of Erised."
“So, if you want to fuck I won’t mind if you skip out on my party early,” Blaise continued, the his delight at the situation obvious in his tone.
Draco sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. He was ready to launch into a lecture about the etiquette of wine, when he noticed the way that Luna and Dudley were looking at him. They both seemed strangely pleased, and had knowing smiles on their faces.
“Hello, kitty,” Harry murmured softly, crouching down and offering two fingers to the cat who eagerly rubbed its face against them. “You’re a pretty thing, aren’t you?”
It looked like Draco was going to have to allow Harry this Ouija Board as being a valid communication device for spirits. He was sure the spirits were simple ghosts, though, rather than the demons Harry had been talking about earlier—he couldn’t allow Harry to be that right.
Harry turned in Draco’s arm. “You’re not so bad yourself,” he smiled, before pressing his lips to Draco’s in a sweet kiss.
Draco had also made an antidote to the potion, which he’d already taken. Harry was an Auror, so he was sure to find it suspicious if they were drinking different wines. So now Draco could pour them glasses from the same bottle, and only Harry would be affected, none the wiser to what he was drinking.
Malfoy gave him a crooked smile. "I disagree about the dumb part, but other than that I'll accept your apology. Now, would you like to grovel for the charm?"
"So guess what I found out," Malfoy said, slamming a large tome down on Harry's desk, the force strong enough to spill his coffee over the rim of his mug.
“Both,” Ginny said without shame. “As I said, Pansy knows that Draco’s been smitten with you for a long time, and you were always far too interested in his coming and goings than schoolboy rivals should be. Besides, the two of you make a cute couple.
Both of them shucked off their clothes urgently, leaving them in a crumpled heap on the floor. Finally, the only fabric that remained on either of them was Draco’s boxers, which were tented with a promise of the huge erection inside it.
“Remember,” Vernon said through gritted teeth, shooting Harry a sideways glare. “If you mess this up for us in any way, you will live to regret it. Do you understand me, Boy?”
Harry’s heart skipped a beat at the familiar voice, and he turned around to see Draco cycling furiously towards them. Draco jumped off the bike before it had even come to a full stop, sending the bike crashing into a tree.
“Hmm, well I’ve grown up around ghosts so I know them and how they act. If this little girl is noticeably different than the poltergeists I’ve known, then I’ll willingly admit that you might be right about this one thing existing.”
Draco had never bothered to try any of the Muggle drinks that Harry favoured so much, especially as Harry had a taste for things which were overly sweet and sugary. Still, the coke would make it easier to disguise the fact that he had doubled the amount of vodka Harry had asked for.
“I play guitar,” Harry said, aware all at once of Draco’s steely grey gaze that was focused intently on him now. “I taught myself how to play a few years ago.”
They broke apart for air, both panting slightly from the urgency of the kiss. Draco’s pupils were blown wide, and his lips were bruised red.  Harry had never seen anybody look so gorgeous and utterly beautiful.
Harry smiled despite himself. “I can’t be irritating you too much, then, if you’re already inviting me on another holiday with you.”
Draco grinned too. “That’s true. It’s a wonder the Dark Lord didn’t off himself out of frustration when it came to trying to murder you. Then again, is it even possible to drive someone so insane even further into insanity.”
Vernon and Petunia were given a large suite, while Dudley was in a smaller, through still decently sized room. Dudley scrunched his nose in distaste as he quickly realised there was no television in his room. None of them said a word to Dobby, aside from his uncle snapping at him to be careful with their luggage.
He was so desperate to get just another glimpse of Draco’s cock though, just to see if it was really as big as he remembered. Even just the outline of it through his trousers would be enough to satisfy Harry, and as a result he couldn’t stop looking at Draco’s crotch whenever he got the opportunity to do so.  He was pretty sure Draco had noticed, but Harry had been able to play it off as him being lost in a daydream. He wasn’t nearly as spacey as Draco liked to tease him about being, but it sure helped him in not getting called out as a pervert.
“Truthfully, the first time was an accident,” Draco murmured. “Then I saw your reaction to it, and I knew I wanted to see it again. I must admit I’ve been teasing you by getting you worked up in inappropriate places, but that doesn’t lessen my desire for you, and frankly, what else can we do while we wait for backup, if not finally give in to what we both want?”
“Just you wait until you’ve been dating your Slytherin a while; they start to rub off on you. No pun intended.”
Harry felt his face flush, knowing all too well that he’d willingly pay the price without even wanting anything in return. “We’d need something to pass the time and make prison more enjoyable.”
“The wife and children don’t come here very often,” Harry said as they crept further into the house, down to a sparsely decorated sitting room. “They stay with her mother because of the violent activity that was going on here. The father stays most nights because he works nearby and someone needs to look after the house. Word got out that it’s haunted, so they’re finding it impossible to sell. I’ve promised him that we’ll give copies of all of our evidence to the local priest so they know what they’re working with.”
“Your dad peacocks roaming your front garden, and not just any peacocks, but albino ones. That’s an unusual sight to see, even in old, posh manors with a history of evil deeds.”
“I saw it!” Harry blurted out. “The day we fought that potions smuggler on the farm. I accidentally walked in here while you were still getting changed and well, uh, you’re
Harry slumped forwards and hissed when Draco pulled out of him. Harry’s hole was red and swollen, come dripping slowly down the crease of his arse, and Draco’s cock twitched at the sight. Harry looked so
Draco looked back at Potter, who was angled towards Draco and looking at him intently. He looked confused, no doubt lost about what was going on—either that, or he was wondering how he could have failed to find the Loch Ness Monster.
“Well fuck him, quite frankly,” Draco said, harsher than intended. “He’s stuck in some kind of purgatory, and you’re out here in the world of the living. I think he ruined both of our lives enough when he was alive, and who are we to let him ruin it from beyond the grave? I—”
It was Harry’s turn to preen, glad to hear that Draco had been driven as equally crazy by him. “My arse is all yours, Draco.”
Draco's hand reached between them to grasp Harry's forgotten cock, stroking it slowly as he inched forwards until he was completely buried inside Harry. It was a strange sensation, being so full, but Harry loved it.
“And be stuck in the crowds of tourists?” Draco scoffed. “Not likely. Get up; we’re going as soon as you’re dressed.”
Harry was worn out from their afternoon activities, having ridden Draco's cock as soon as they were both ready to go again. Harry had done brilliantly both times, taking Draco so well.
They stopped for coffee, or rather Draco did and Harry stopped with him because it was only fair, and took a seat on delicate metal chairs in an outside courtyard.
Draco stared at him, and then let out a short bark of laughter. “I’m honoured you would consider me to the heir of the great Slytherin. How did you get in?”
It was Narcissa, and Harry felt a fleeting moment of guilt for talking about her son until he realised that she was smiling.
Good things didn’t happen to Draco, but somehow in the last few months he’d been gifted with an eccentric and reckless, but brilliant partner, alongside an unusual but enjoyable and well-paid job. Strangest of all, Draco was beginning to feel like he truly deserved all of it; or at any rate, he was going to fight to keep what he had now.
“You want me?” Harry could scarcely believe that he’d wasted so much time not acting on his attraction while being completely oblivious to the fact that Draco returned those same feelings.
Blaise smirked, and mouthed something at Potter which Draco couldn’t make out. “See you soon,” he added with a smile at Draco before he left with his arm hooked in Pansy’s.
“Anything could make that sound,” Draco said. Truthfully, he knew very little about animals, though the sound to him did seem like some kind of dolphin.
Men clad in nothing but tight leather trousers, and women in leather corsets and tiny leather shorts danced sultrily in metal cages suspended from the ceiling, while others swung around on poles.
After taking some painkillers, Harry had a quick shower and pulled on his clothes from the day prior, too lazy to find fresh ones. When he left his room he ran into Dobby, whose lips quirked at the sight of Harry.
Draco scoffed. “They’d only be Mr Malfoy if their own surname wasn’t strong enough to double-barrel it. But no, there’s no future Mr Malfoy in my world right now. And you must realise that it makes you sound rather interested when you ask questions like that, don’t you, Potter? I don’t think Blaise would like that very much.”
“Fuck yes,” Draco ground out breathlessly, his eyes falling shut momentarily as Harry lowered the final barrier between them.
“We are going to have some time in the sun though, aren’t we? Not working, I mean,” Draco clarified. “I don’t mind going on a coyote hunt if I get at least a little bit of sun and relaxation afterwards.”
“I’m sure you’re more than a little bit good,” Draco said. “You have an annoying habit of being good at most things, excluding potions. And not getting yourself banned from banks, although I do appreciate your resulting custom.”
Harry’s stomach fluttered at the thought of kissing Draco, and he wondered why he had accepted his attraction to Draco so easily. Draco had gone from his schoolyard rival, to a reluctant enemy, to a civil financial advisor, and now an excellent travel companion. If he and Draco had any hope of a romantic future together, they’d certainly taken the longest, most complicated path towards it.
meet; she’s exactly your type, and very single. Keep Harry occupied, won’t you, Draco? I fear all these snakes might devour him if they discover a little lion in their midst.”
“Goody,” Draco said dryly, trying very hard not to smile at Harry’s ridiculous enthusiasm. “I do hope I don’t get lost in the woods with you.”
He opened his eyes, knowing there was no point continuing his ruse, and turned back onto his side. Draco was facing him, eyes piercing straight through him, and Harry swallowed heavily at the sight.
"Don't be a twat, Potter," Draco hissed. "If you move your Knight you're going to leave your Queen completely unprotected. Merlin, you're bad at this."
“I-I’ll beg you to let me come, now. And I want you to come too. I want to touch your cock, Draco, please. I want to suck it.”
His aunt and uncle were some of the first out of their seats as soon as the seatbelt sign went off, standing in the aisle and blocking other passengers without a care. It was lucky Lucius had sprung for first class, because there were less people to glare at them.
Draco smiled wickedly, flashing his perfectly white, and oddly sharp, canines. “I know for a fact that isn’t true. I truly do enjoy insulting you, Potter.”
The cat left Harry to go and nuzzle happily against Malfoy, whose expression softened as he looked down at the animal. His features remained pleasant even as he returned his attention back to Harry, though after a moment Malfoy seemed to realise this and slipped into a mask of indifference.
“Muggles are pretty good at making food, I’ll give them that,” Pansy said. “And I asked Millicent to ask Granger where the best pizza shop in Naples was, and she said it was
And while Puerto Rico certainly offered plenty of hot sun, sandy beaches, and lush greenery, it was the other situation that Draco had underestimated. He should have learned by now never to underestimate Harry Potter.
Harry didn’t think he’d ever been so hard in his life, and he wondered if it would be possible to come from just a tongue up his arse. Before he could figure that out, however, Draco’s tongue left him. Harry’s whine of disappointment turned into a yelp of rapture as both of Draco’s fingers pressed deep inside him and hit his prostate, sending jolts of scorching pleasure through him.
Harry hesitated, not usually one to share his paintings. It felt akin to letting others see his diary--not that he kept a diary; that’s what the art was for.
And when they fingers brushed as they both reached for the bill, neither of them mentioned it, but Harry could feel Draco’s touch on him deep into the night.
“But you never let me touch you,” Harry pointed out. “Do you think I won’t be any good? Is that it?”
Dudley’s expression darkened. “No, it was me that got that. If I made Harry’s childhood miserable, it’s nothing compared to what my parents did to him.” He trailed off, glancing around to make sure Potter wasn’t coming back. “I shouldn’t even be telling you this. It makes me sick thinking about what my mum and dad did to him, but I still love them because they’re my parents. It’s definitely made my relationship with them a lot more complicated.”
To make things worse, most space on the walls were taken up by ‘photos’, paintings, illustrations, and newspaper clippings of the Loch Ness Monster. A large group of tourists stood nearby, all wearing bright green hats shaped like the monster, while others—Americans, judging by their accent—spoke loudly about their upcoming boat trip to the Loch and how they hoped to see the creature.
“You don’t need to. I’m not going to intrude on your holiday with your girlfriend and be your tag-along third wheel. I’m sure you’d enjoy a holiday a lot more if you didn’t have to worry about your sad friend.”
Draco grasped Harry’s hips tightly, pulling back before slamming forwards again and setting a brutal pace. Harry moaned each time Draco thrust into him, nailing his prostate each time.
He wrapped his hand around the base, relishing the way his fingers had to stretch to fit around Draco’s prick comfortably. Harry was quite adept at deep-throating when it came to average sized cocks, but he didn’t think he’d be able to fit all of Draco in his mouth and that thought alone made his own erection twitch with excitement.
Harry grinned. “Lavender will be happy to hold him while he weeps, I’m sure. Thanks, though, Gin, for thinking of me. I don’t especially like your underhanded Slytherin tactics, but it was nice of you anyway.”
Daydreaming students were normal too, and Harry would be the biggest liar in the world if he said he'd never been one of them—Professor Binns had taught him for five years, after all—but Ava didn't strike him as a regular daydreamer. If anything, she appeared to be eternally sad, a frown almost permanently etched onto her face.
Watching Draco eat a peach was positively indecent, the way the juices dripped over his fingers and chin, and the way his tongue darted out of his perfect red lips to lick it clean.
Draco slid his hair over his shoulder and held it out of Harry’s way. He could feel the texture of his curled locks whispering over his skin so much more intensely than he should have. The room suddenly seemed both too loud and deathly quiet, Draco dared not move a muscle.
Draco's thoughts on Harry's behaviour in chapter 6 (only a little bit obsessed, really), and his actions leading up to the events of chapter 7 (the gauntlet)
Their eyes finally met, and Harry’s expression abruptly changed, he looked surprised, almost awed, and he outright stared into Draco’s eyes, faces mere inches apart.
The three of them arrived at the gala in plenty of time, greeted enthusiastically by many guests (Harry would sooner call it ‘harassment via compliments and prying questions’, but whatever). But it was obvious that all three were impatient for Malfoy’s arrival. Especially Harry. Because Malfoy was Harry’s school rival. Yeah. And he liked the dresses. Yeah. Those two things contradicted each other, but he’d worry about that at a later date.
doing it. So the first he heard of the little circus Malfoy had made for himself was about an hour ago.
He knew Potter was watching. Such an extravagant display was as much for his eyes as it was the other guests’. He scanned the hall and, just as he suspected, Potter stared intently, mouth agape.
Every time I open the document but neglect to motivate myself to write something for this, I post another chapter. It's like telling myself "keep slacking and you won't have anything left to post", y'know because I like to mentally torture myself like that. (I'm fine, i swear)
“No, no! Olen, don’t eat mummy’s campaign posters, please!” said Hermoine, plucking the poster from the child’s mouth and giving him a small toy to play with instead. Olen put it straight into his mouth, but at least it wasn’t a poster, or a choking hazard.
(did y'all know I can sew? I've been doing a lot of it in between writing and online classes. You will receive no more details about this, though you probably don't really care anyway, so it's a win-win🎉)
As he moved on to the other eye, he had to pull Harry’s arm further across his body, therefore bringing their faces incredibly close together. And amidst Draco’s internal distress, the thought of Harry engineering this situation himself again crossed Draco’s mind. He could feel the warmth of Harry’s face on his own, hear his quiet breaths and smell the barest hint of his shampoo. He found himself blushing furiously under his makeup and fought to keep a straight face and draw a straight line.
"Then give me a bloody reason to, Malfoy! I don't understand why you're making this topic of conversation such a ball-ache!" Potter grumbled. Gryffindors, no patience, no tact. Draco preferred Potter that way, but still. Oh, well. Here goes nothing.
Harry agreed to help almost immediately. Which was… good, that was good. Draco wouldn’t need to struggle with the zip and risk damaging the dress. This did not stop his heart from stuttering and his blush from deepening as Harry stepped towards his back, only slightly taller than Draco without his heels on. Draco’s throat was dry.
Once Harry was gone, Draco mused on his life a bit, and he found himself remembering one of his mother’s old proverbs:
“Did you know I used to be a potioneer on Diagon Alley?” said Draco, the smell of the shop he’d worked at filling his nostrils.
“I can’t help but feel like I don’t deserve all the support you give me. Our--” he hesitated “--friendship doesn’t quite feel real. Like a hazy dream. It makes sense in the moment, but if you think on it too hard it becomes absolutely nonsensical,” said Draco, “but I’ll look for you in the crowd.” Draco was trying this new thing where he was…
“Is that why you keep following me?” he continued, “Again," he added, eyes narrowed with malice. Potter continued to blink at him dumbly as he swallowed his food. Draco scowled harder. Potter spoke.
“Why don’t you use my hands?” Harry explained, “I’ll hold the liner, and you can guide my hand in applying the makeup,” he finished.
on shaking so profusely? He’d barely managed to finish the rest of his makeup but he couldn’t get this eyeliner right with such tremors! An injustice! And his naked back was freezing, on account of being unable to zip himself up. The leather gloves didn’t exactly help either… He definitely should’ve done hair and makeup
They had wasted so much time… Draco blamed himself, in all honesty. For not getting a grip sooner, for not being brave enough to leave and fight against Voldemort. For putting all he could into saving his own skin. But he knew Harry… didn’t see it that way. He remembered their conversation at the Ministry Ball, how Harry looked straight past his mask of disdain, even past the glamour and the glitz of the ballgowns. Harry stared right into his soul, he knew the things Draco had done, his sins. He knew this… and he had seen himself.
was with us… to help me sleep at night,” he spilled his guts to Harry, and at some point he had placed another hand on both of theirs, cradling their joined hands like a fragile, precious thing. Harry didn’t protest when he stroked his knuckles tenderly.
“Oh Merlin, you really have gone mad…” she said. Blaise groaned audibly. Draco set the owl on its way.
“I didn’t mean it like that!” came Potter’s slightly panicked interjection, “I just don’t believe that you would find it that difficult to get along with Astoria Greengrass, weren’t you friends at Hogwarts?” he desperately explained. Draco relaxed somewhat. A misunderstanding. That was… good. Better than the alternative. Still so quick to each other’s throats…
They started to make circuits around the kitchen, the gentle music guiding their steps. Draco felt so serene in that moment, and a longing so raw it nearly hurt, grasped at his chest. Harry’s eyes looked softer, but no less bright, and Draco could barely contain a blush when he felt the man’s fingers comb through his loose hair. He moved slowly, trancelike, and leaned his forehead to Draco’s.
“Do you agree with her?” he asked. Harry pulled a confused expression, “Do you think I’m sweet? That I’m… not so obviously… disdainful?” Draco really worried about coming off too… stiff. Too impersonal and unapproachable. He wanted Harry to be comfortable around him, to not feel like he had to meet expectations that Draco simply… didn’t have.
“What’s so wrong with keeping up with someone when their message is one you sympathise with?” said Harry, determined as a true Griffyndor.
Nice long chapter to return on. Originally, this fic was gonna be almost done by this point. But I thought it felt wrong to have all that buildup without something Dramatic happening. So, uh, it's now projected to be about 12 chapters longer than originally planned😂, hence the long break. But everything's planned out and I've got a modest buffer. My medical problems are finally being treated correctly, and I feel pretty good! And optimistic! Hope y'all are enjoying😊
Their hands were clasped once more, and Draco felt happy. Harry took the initiative to place his other hand on Draco’s shoulder.
And it took Harry a moment to realise that Malfoy wasn't really wet (most likely from an Impervious). The only signs that he wasn't actually soaked were that; his make-up wasn't running; and as he walked across the hall, the floor remained perfectly dry. Harry caught himself longing to touch - just a bit, just for a second - to really tell for sure that it was all spellwork and clever styling.
I based a few of Ginny's little signs of her queerness from my own. And I had no idea the Holyhead Harpies were from Wales until I wrote this chapter! Whaddya know!
. And Draco adored it in an entirely too masochistic way. He felt himself sink into his boudoir chair with a disgustingly besotted sigh, and smile dopily at nothing.
When Draco finished the surprisingly decent eyeliner, he dropped Harry’s hand as if burned, wary of being found out and making his friend uncomfortable.
“Uh yeah, fine, sorry,” said Harry, after shaking his head. It was then that his hands moved back down, and Draco’s spine tingled at the memory associated with the action. Harry took the zip and moved it upwards just as carefully as Draco had asked him to, the sound of the zipper and the sudden release of tension striking Draco like a static shock, yanking him back down to earth all at once.
He walked slowly, head bowed almost demurely. He looked amazing, even if he could only really be seen from the shoulders up. The only way you could tell he was wearing heels was from the way they clicked against the polished wooden floor.
Finally he arrived at the owlery - with a small roll of parchment, a quill, and a stoppered ink pot. He jotted down the shortest note in history. Then he began rifling through the pockets of his robes. He pulled out a slip of paper.
. Harry was here. He heard the man chortle from behind him in a thoroughly undignified and incredibly endearing manner.
. Harry couldn’t shake the image of a gangly and pointy-faced Draco Malfoy’s scornful sneer out of his head. And he struggled to reconcile that image, with that of the man in the pictures Hermione was trying to pretend she wasn’t gushing over. Surely Malfoy would look incredibly awful in a dress, if he’d be caught dead in one at all. Still, he couldn’t shake that curiosity, that tiny voice in the back of his mind that told Harry to
I think I should make it clear that I've recently been diagnosed with a chronic illness. Hence my sporadic updates. I've been going through a very difficult time and I want to thank my readers for being patient with me and for the well-wishes some of you gave me in the comments. Thank you. I hope you enjoy this chapter💛✨
low neckline that only tapered off at about midway down Malfoy’s chest. The hemline was covered with soft, red, ostrich feathers that whispered against the exposed skin.
This chapter marks the end of my buffer, I shall have to do some more writing. Juggling a lot at the moment, including my recently diagnosed illness. But writing still brings me so much joy💛 hope you all enjoy this one
"Why? She's pretty, you both have similar backgrounds. You don't seem to hate each other, so I'd at least think you'd get along?" said Potter, who had obviously taken one too many bludgers to the head.
Finally, Draco could get some answers. He felt a kind of nervous under-skin itch as he donned his garments. First the tango dress, then the decoy. The theme was duality, contrast in every aspect possible.
“You don’t know what I went through," said Malfoy. Red lips downturned and eyebrows scrunched in displeasure.
“Really?” Harry ventured, “because I was sure that it was a way of not only showing your personal growth since the war, but also to display your contempt for the pureblooded ideals that your family associated with for so long, and to bring attention to the harm caused by it,” he explained, and watched with sinful delight as Malfoy’s face grew more and more shocked with each word. “Oh! And most importantly, to overshadow and intimidate the pureblooded hosts and high profile ‘guests’ of these balls, so they won’t dare profit from the harm they caused (or failed to prevent) during the war," he finished with an earnest grin.
) and they decided on their cuisine for the night. Harry apparated away quite suddenly. Draco assumed it was to find somewhere close by that sold their food. Most likely in the nearby muggle town Draco told him about.
Harry almost full-body recoiled at his own mind, but still, it wouldn’t hurt to know… He glanced at a couple of papers, a delicate heat rising to his cheeks.
Writing speed is really slowing down I'm afraid, and I'm going on holiday soon, but I'll be sure to bring my laptop in case inspiration strikes👌
"Um. Right. I mean, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised,” said the Gryffindor, clearly out of his depth, “But still,
I used it to lift mother’s gramophone and smuggle it into my room,” he recalled. How the music that filled the hall as mother taught him to waltz filled his own room. It was the first, and most secret, time he imagined wearing one of those fine gowns he loved so much. He didn’t realise he’d been tearing up until he couldn’t see the radio dial.
“If you asked me ten years ago, I would’ve denied I ever did such fanciful things, let alone answer the question,” said Draco. Then he took a fortifying breath and looked Harry directly in the eyes, “but yes. Yes I was,” he said fiercely. If Harry was going to reject him, it was now or never.
He had only just settled on the chaise lounge and opened the book to the correct page, when he heard the telltale
been stalking me again, haven’t you?” said Draco. Yes, that was the most likely explanation. He was always a
“I’ve finished eating, and I want to show you something. So hurry up and eat, then meet me in the kitchen,” he instructed his friend, swiftly walking to the kitchen. He set the dishes to cleaning, and plugged in his radio, tuning it to his favourite station. The music evoked so many memories. Mostly of his mother and their fond times together. Of learning to dance, standing on her expensive shoes, her not caring if he ruined them. Of her soft voice as she hummed her favourite songs while she sewed.
He realised, belatedly, that he was still wearing the gown from that evening. So he quickly went upstairs to change into his comfortable muggle loungewear. He pulled his loose hair into a quick bun, and went back downstairs with a book in his hands.
“It is abundantly clear how little you understand of the statement I am attempting to make,” he hissed. But Harry actually did think he understood. After reading all those articles and going to all those parties (it was shocking how frequent they were), it would be hard not to.
“It’s no different than usual. They’re gonna love you, they always do--” said Harry. He was using that earnest tone that made Draco’s heart ache and flutter at the same time… but Draco couldn’t meet his eyes.
Malfoy sneered, and it was a testament - either to the man’s makeup artist, or to exactly how far Harry’s obsession was spinning out of his control - that he thought the blond still looked stunning. Objectively. Especially with lips painted such a vivid shade of red. And with eyelashes so long and black. Were they real? Was it just mascara? They looked like smoke. Malfoy was dressed like a flame, literally.
Your comments and love really do keep me motivated! Don't be afraid to interact a little, even if it's just incoherent babbling, I really do appreciate it so much💛
Suddenly, something came bursting to the surface of the water, and the guests erupted into uproarious applause at Draco Malfoy. Elegant as ever, Malfoy stepped out of the pool. And Harry realised that his dress was styled and charmed to look, and behave, just like a real waterfall. The clear blue current cascaded down Malfoy’s lithe form and pooled on the ground like real water, it even glistened and glinted in the light in the same way. The whole garment was thin and lightweight; it clinged in all the right places and flowed in all the others. White fabric resembling seafoam adorned the asymmetrical neckline and bubbled realistically with the ‘tide’. Malfoy’s entire right leg was exposed and he wore the loveliest satin heels, with jewels placed in a way that looked like bubbles.
Harry realised he had stopped breathing, so he started again. He also realised he had been staring… for a while. So he looked up at his two friends, sat together on the plush sofa opposite him.
“You’ll mess up your work if you scrunch your face up like that,” said a silky voice from somewhere behind him, amused. Draco tried not to flail any more than he already was. Naturally, he failed - and drew a black streak across his face. Without magic he’d have been in trouble, but as it was, he simply vanished the mistake with minimal effort.
The full-body coverage of the winter gown, and the acres of skin on show in the smaller dress. Symmetry and asymmetry; cool and muted colours, and warm and bright. Ice and fire.
Red jewels that looked like rubies littered the whole dress in a scattered pattern that clustered around Malfoy’s waist, where the fabric hugged close to his body…
Potter looked slightly taken aback, and then he smiled… he smiled so warmly it made Draco want to cry again.
If the cliffhanger was the wound itself, this chapter is the equivalent of a whole bucket of salt. Prepare to hurt.
Feel free to let me know any and all thoughts you have about this fic, all interaction is greatly appreciated 😁
“Oh, Harry,” said Draco, “I’m not sure he wants me getting under his feet all the time…” he saw a thoughtful look cross Harry’s face briefly, before it was gone.
The tension in the air was taught like a bowstring, but Draco worried if he moved or breathed wrong the string would just snap, and he'd ruin their relationship forever… friendship. Harry’s fingers were but a hair’s width away from Draco’s own where he held his hair back. A single thought repeated over and over again in Draco’s mind:
“Really?” said Harry. Draco made a noise of affirmation. Draco saw Harry pick up a tube of lip gloss out of the corner of his eye and do a perfect Swish and Flick. Draco chuckled. Well, truth be told it was more of a giggle, but who’s going to judge him?
“Am I some sort of spectacle to you?” said a posh voice. Harry jumped and whirled around, only to choke on his biscotti when his face ended up inches from that of a rather pissed off (and gorgeously made up) Malfoy.
"It's essentially a celebration to mark a 'pure-blood' young woman making her first appearance in high society. Its purpose was to show she was ready for marriage. Nowadays, however, they're mostly just to celebrate engagements, whenever the lady chooses a suitor,” he explained perfectly.
Harry never could resist a challenge where Malfoy was concerned, so he attended the ball, to prove the pointy bastard wrong.
“What was I saying?” Hermoine asked Harry, having lost her rather manic train of thought. Harry helpfully pointed to the newspaper in her hand.
Quickly, Malfoy was engulfed in flame, the ball guests cried out and fretted while Harry stood stock still, mouth agape.
The owl stretched out its foot haughtily, displaying the envelope attached to it, correctly addressed to one Harry James Potter at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Harry took the envelope with some bewilderment, and gave the owl a treat before it immediately took off. Harry took it that the sender did not expect a reply.
The sleeves seemingly split open just above the elbow and hung down, exposing the shimmery lining of the dress along with Malfoy’s forearms.
He locked his floo within the hour, and his wards soon after. And he retired to bed, feet dragging along the floor, the hearth fire reducing itself to barely flickering embers.
And Malfoy was still kind of right - because how much of his struggles, his suffering, had Harry missed? How much of it was known only to the beautified man in front of him, and no other soul? How heavy was the burden of the knowledge, locked away like a shameful secret, never to be unearthed?
Draco had inherited the house from his father’s settlements. It was smaller than the manor, and a bit more rustic to match its lush green surroundings. Draco found it peaceful, and secluded. Pansy and Blaise flooed in often (“To make sure you don’t lose your sanity from the isolation,” Pansy had said).
“Merlin, Potter, I was joking!” Draco cried in exasperation. “How can I make fun of your wavering sanity if you just end up agreeing with me?”
Draco’s hands moved to grasp Harry’s hips, but he made no further move to initiate the kiss. Well, he had asked Harry to prove himself, and Harry wasn’t a coward.
The weather was too hot for Harry to be able to concentrate on the pages properly, though, and he felt his eyes glazing over. He sighed again and closed his eyes, allowing himself to just
“Transparent? About what?” Draco demanded. His gaze drifted back towards Blaise and Potter, prompting him to do a double-take when he realised that the couple in question were no longer there.
“Yeah,” Harry retorted, stepping up on the front doorstep so that his face was level with Draco’s. “But this gives me one last chance to kiss you until I see you again.”
Draco froze for a moment as Harry’s thigh pressed against him, but he relaxed as he felt Harry stiffen in response to his reaction. Acting far braver than he felt, Draco stretched his arm out on the back of the sofa, as close to Harry’s back as he could without touching it.
Draco shook his head and smirked. “No, Blaise doesn’t care who’s there as long as he gets alcohol and sex as soon as he can. Get ready now because we’re leaving soon. Oh, by the way, Harry; your book is upside down. Nice attempt at a save though.”
If Harry could point out something he’d done wrong then he wouldn’t have minded so much that Draco was upset with him, but Harry didn’t think he’d done anything wrong at all. The only thing Harry could think was that Draco had only ever considered Harry a casual fling and was annoyed at Harry getting too attached.
Harry rested the guitar gently against his legs, and his gaze met Draco’s again. Draco inclined his head, and his eyes studied Harry so intently that Harry had to look away. He could still feel Draco’s eyes on him, and he felt his face flush under the scrutiny. It felt nice to have Draco’s attention, though.
to have a hard body beneath his. He rested his hands against Draco’s chest, breathing in deeply as he felt the study thrum of Draco’s heartbeat against his fingers.
And when Harry had nightmares, he'd told him tight until Harry fell back into the world of sleep, leaving Draco vowing to hurt anybody who dared to strike Harry's loving heart. Harry was like an obsession, like an ocean Draco wanted to drown in.
Potter rolled his eyes. “I never knew I could be attracted to such a prat, but all your ridiculous insults get me hot under the collar. But would you? Like to go on a date, sometime, I mean?”
Draco’ brows furrowed in confusion--there shouldn’t be any pain from the potion, unless he’d messed up the quantities of ingredients somehow--but worries of bad potion making flew out of his head at the sound of Harry’s delicious whimper as Draco’s finger grazed his prostate. So what if Harry hurt a bit? Fucking him hard would ease it.
“Besides,” Ginny added quietly as Pansy and Draco walked away to collect their Portkey. “I’m pretty sure Draco has a crush on you, so you can thank me later.”
Adding a second finger, Draco continued to work Harry’s hole open, pushing in a third when he felt Harry was ready. Harry pushed back against Draco’s hand.
“Up here,” Ginny called, and they turned to see her seat up on a raised compartment above the area a steering wheel should be. “There’s a lovely double bed, just for the two of you.”
“I orgasm just fine on my own, thank you,” Draco said coldly. “Now alcohol, on the other hand, sounds like it would be a blessing. Fuck off downstairs so I can change, unless you’re a bigger pervert than I thought you were.”
Harry was a babbling mess as Draco’s entire length pounding hard and slow inside of him, his prick hot and aching against the desk. He was so full and it left him feeling entirely blissed out, like he was floating on waves of electric pleasure as Draco continued to grind against his prostate. He knew he was close to release, even without touching his cock, and he knew that the second he did he would come almost instantly.
But if any of you guys out there are struggling with your health, take your meds, drink your water, and do what you can. You can get through this, I know you can💛
“Nothing! It looks just like my great aunt’s,” Harry teased with that bloody smirk of his. Draco’s body flooded with heat and he flushed visibly.
“I was unkind to her, wasn't I?” he asked. Harry first looked confused, then just gentle. Draco enjoyed it when Harry looked gentle. Draco enjoyed Harry, period.
But, as it was, he feigned a look of great concern when Harry suddenly remembered the mirror and met his gaze through it. Harry instantly looked guilty, so easy to read. Did he know Draco had seen him? He seemed rather… preoccupied. Draco met his friend’s stare, and wondered. The eyeliner… following him to all those parties… even just the way he
I've had the plan for this just sitting in my docs, so i got inspired one day and started writing. and here we are! hope y'all enjoy <3
There was a time where Harry would've found that sort of attitude insufferable enough to warrant punching the pointy git in the nose.
“Twelve years of combined classical dance tutoring - emphasis on ballroom, line, and tap,” said Draco. It was true.
"Why? She's pretty, you both have similar backgrounds. You don't seem to hate each other, so I'd at least think you'd get along?" said Harry, slightly confused and out of his depth in this topic. Malfoy looked at him like he thought the Griffyndor had been hit by one bludger too many.
Would he and Potter always be like this, even as grown men, with new lives and priorities? Was it simply their fate to always clash? To always fight?
My buffer is officially drained! But on the bright side, the plot of this baby just got a massive rewrite in my outline, so it's gonna be twice as long! And with some angst! and some further development of characters n stuff
The left side of the skirt would have sloped all the way to the floor, but where it tapered into a fine point was caught in a ring on Malfoy’s middle finger, and thus the skirt moved dynamically as he walked.
Once he reached the center of the grand hall, however, he slipped one hand out of the muff and grabbed at his skirt, hiking it up his leg to reveal a black leather stiletto. Harry thought it was a nice, theatrical bit of contrast.
“Make sure they don’t look too similar, I want them both to feel confident in these robes. But can you not make them too restrictive, please? Oh, this fabric suits you really well, Harry! Oh, I’m so sorry sir but I think you’ve made my husband’s sleeves too short- oh! And Harry hates anything with a high collar, so you may want to pick a style that doesn’t have--” she was interrupted by Harry and Ron’s simultaneous and pointed uttering of “
Fake fish of various bright colours were charmed to swim around Malfoy's head. His hair was styled to look wet as it fell over his shoulders and back, clinging to the exposed skin. That was when Harry really noticed the makeup.
There was a brief pause. "Um. Right. I mean, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised,” said Harry, completely wrong-footed, “But still,
"Then give me a bloody reason to, Malfoy! I don't understand why you're making this topic of conversation such a ball-ache!" Harry grumbled at Malfoy’s avoidant behaviour.
Harry wanted to say that wasn’t true. He wanted to tell Malfoy just how much of his journey, his struggles, had been witnessed by Harry. But he didn’t. Because they weren’t friends. They didn’t know one another that way.
with - doesn't really fit that criteria I'm afraid,” said Malfoy, who had graduated from pissed off, to
“Why did you quit the potions job in the first place then?” asked the other man. Draco steeled himself.
Perhaps Draco’s feelings weren’t so one-sided after all? In fact, Harry had looked every bit just now like he’d wanted nothing more than to run his hands up the bare skin of Draco’s back, tracing his scars like they were
It was well into autumn at this point, and the weather was getting colder - Malfoy was clothed in an icy blue dress, with vast fur panels around the shoulders and the base of the dress. All the fur was white, his head was covered by a fluffy kubanka, and his hands rested in a white fur muff.
"There's always a choice, Harry Potter," said Draco, with a private smile, a glimpse behind his defenses. Draco’s own olive branch. And a clap to the shoulder as he departed, just to feel the warmth beneath the man’s robes.
Their gazes met one last time, with Harry one foot out the door, and he looked at him. He looked intensely, and the door shut.
He reacted, alright. His eyes twitched before glossing over slightly, and Draco just about heard him audibly swallow. Heat flooded Draco’s skin, and it took everything in him not to
"Once upon a time she was to marry me," said Malfoy, truthfully. He watched with amusement as this time, Potter choked on his drink, "and if my parents had their way we would still be affianced. But as it stands, Astoria is not going to become a Malfoy. It would've been a rather miserable marriage anyway,” he finished, taking a lavish sip from his own flute. Astoria was a lovely girl. But unfortunately for each of their respective parents, Draco’s affections lay with… a rather different breed of person.
, Harry thought. It was a relatively light dress, more toned down than the one in the other pictures. The skirt was mostly made from a couple of layers of a very lightweight sheer fabric, with black undertones. It moved in the summer breeze, floating around Malfoy’s slender frame -
“Harry, are you alright?” Draco asked as gently as he could, barely keeping the worry out of his tone. He reached out with his hand, it was meant as a comforting gesture. Harry looked at it like it was the bone-thin claw of a dementor. He flinched. Draco felt his insides twist in shame and guilt and confusion and fear.
They were getting along well… really well. Draco was trying not to come across as overly clingy, but he’d quickly found that Harry had turned him into a complete sap. He was pleasantly tired after their latest ball, and they had decided to eat together before they both parted ways. The newly acquired sap in Draco couldn’t help but notice how remarkably this resembled a date. Potter wouldn’t stop staring at his dress, but that was nothing unusual.
He resigned himself to being patient with Harry, to continue seeing him and acting normal, to wait for just the right moment to… well he didn’t know yet, but he would.
Draco could scarcely believe what he saw… guilt, and longing, and a reverence that made Draco’s head spin. His hand moved, millimetres from Draco’s skin, up his back and along his spine (which was decidedly ready to collapse into a loose pile of pebbles at that precise moment), between his shoulder blades and all the way to the nape of his neck. Draco had to shut his eyes against Harry’s reflected expression, before he did something rash.
The worst part was that Draco knew that anger, that accusation, wasn’t unjustified. But Draco had put so much effort into helping those hurt by
“Um…” said Draco, dreading having to ask this of Harry. On the one hand, he was elated to have Harry so close to him, but on the other, the last thing he wanted was to make Harry uncomfortable or take advantage of him, “Actually, you wouldn’t mind helping me with this zip as well, would you? These damn gloves make it impossible to grab something so small, no matter how well they fit me,” he tried to justify the request to Harry, silently imploring him to not get upset.
The music the band was playing began its crescendo as a hush fell over the hall, interspersed by excited whispers. A few of the ministry folk in the hall began to whisper harshly to one another, irritated.
something, and Draco felt his eyes mist over. Harry rocked towards him, impossibly closer. Distantly, Draco could hear the music, as the Gryffindor leaned closer, a breath ghosting over Draco’s lips. They closed their eyes, and Draco almost melted at the feeling of - finally,
to make it float. Again, Draco laughed quietly, trying not to poke himself in the eye as Harry continued to “goof off” next to him. Pretending to transfigure various makeup products into items from his own pockets (wallet, keys, even his wand -  which Draco found particularly amusing). When Draco finished with the mascara, he used the applicator (wand) to cast a pretend
“What is a debutante ball anyway? What makes it different than any other ball?” said Potter. Was he…? Were they? Was Potter making
. He didn’t, “--and since getting to know you - especially that part - I… I feel ready. I feel new,” he forced the words out, heart hammering.
a fulfilling relationship at some point in my life, Potter. And a marriage to a woman - to whom I, a gay man, would be expected to be faithful to
It was then that Ron swooped back into the living room of their cottage, to the rescue, armed with Hermione’s cup of tea. She kissed him on the cheek in thanks, and took a long, slow sip. And a long, slow breath.
The dress looked exactly like a stylised version of the duelling stage the two of them had fought upon as children. In second year, when Harry realised he could speak parseltongue.
Malfoy looked up at him then, into his green eyes that looked like his mother’s, up to his damned scar, and then back down again. He looked open, and pensive. It was a good look on him.
“Well, at least we know that - considering their intentions for ‘coming out of the woodwork’ -  they'll try to be civil. Probably,” said Hermione, trying to reassure the group.
Hope you guys liked it as much as I do, have a lovely day and be sure to keep hydrated in this heat🔥
Harry smiled at his best mates in the world. He was so happy for them. He hoped Luna and Ginny were taking good care of his niece and nephew.
And I have my Covid vaccine soon, so depending on how that goes I'll probably work on restocking my buffer lol
“Maybe you have to see them in person, Ron,” she said, “I probably need to do some field research before making any final decisions. It’ll make my decision seem more credible; besides, seeing things in context always helps one to better understand their purpose or importance,” she finished.
Then Draco saw the man’s hand twitch, and his eyes regained a startling sharpness so quickly that Draco could’ve shivered.
Harry passed him some biscotti with créme fresh and spring onions. Malfoy blinked dumbly at the food.
I was. How I had a light inside of me that I must share with the world. I’m sure none of this is what she had in mind. But I like to think that in her heart of hearts she would be proud of me. The same part of her that used to play this for me… while
“Yes, well, we’ve got plenty of time before the ball. Plus, your hair is already done.” Harry appeared to be bargaining with him. Fascinating.
Luckily Ron and Hermione didn't hear him. Not that he'd care if they did hear, of course. He was in awe, perfectly respectable and reasonable awe. Completely normal straight man, comfortable with his sexuality, appreciating the craftsmanship of the dress and the bravery of the act.
“Oh, thanks boys,” she said, “but you both are going to look great too, once those alterations are made to your robes!” she exclaimed happily. “Oh, this is actually rather fun!” she added.
“Thank you,” he said. And he sounded… vulnerable. Almost fragile, underneath all that confidence and defiance and snootiness. Just a man. Just a boy. At the top of a very tall tower. With an impossible task. Making an impossible decision. With no decision at all really.
“Well,” Harry admitted bashfully, “I have an invitation to the Ministry Of Magic Congenial Quadrennial Gala…” he said. Hermione lit up.
“Oh, I know, but the Ministry hoped the increase in funding - especially coming from the Ministry itself - would put enough pressure on them to elicit positive change. And it did! Until now, that is…” she said, “I just don’t know how I can possibly get the Heads of Departments back on my side. How can I address this? How do I fix it?” Hermione finished.
- shimmered gold in places from makeup, and his lips were painted a deep blue to match his dress. It really had been ten years, Malfoy looked so different, he looked...
“Pansy, feed Arabella while I draft up a note for Finis. I’ve got big plans for our next stunt,” he said.
He scoffed outwardly, but found his mind wandering to the other man’s attire. It was the same dress robes he wore to the last ball. It still looked immaculate, and was still tailored to a perfect fit. Damn him.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat as he almost choked on his coffee, and his chest contracted violently. There was Malfoy, surrounded by wildflowers and sipping raspberry champagne in the afternoon sun, wearing…
Draco had always known Potter to watch him with a certain intensity, but he’d always thought that was hatred, he’d never even considered it could be… focus. To be focused on so intently, to be scrutinised so heavily, tied Draco’s stomach up in knots. He swore he must’ve been flushing scarlet.
“My mother died,” he said. Harry blinked owlishly at him. Draco remembered when it was all fresh. How long it had
Just then, Hermione drew the curtain of the fitting room in her new dress. If Harry were to describe it in two words, he would call it: straightforward and elegant. He saw it as fitting for his best friend. It was short and white, with a pencil skirt that ended just above the knee. From the bust area up to the high neckline, the fabric changed to a sheer fabric with simplified petals over it; because on the rest of the dress, were flowers in various shades of darker blue.
Harry flinched as if slapped, and yanked his hand back, of course Draco saw all of this in the mirror that Harry had clearly forgotten they were standing before. Draco almost audibly whined at the other man’s retreating hand, were his self-control on par with that of a lesser man, he may have outright swooned.
,” Draco finished reading the article with tight lips. He found himself once again in his conservatory, sipping tea with his two close friends. Draco narrowed his eyes.
How barbaric, to rid the world of all evil things through death. Did Draco deserve such a punishment? Potter clearly didn’t think so, not now. He sensed something… shift.
“Me too, mate, don’t worry. Hey, I know your robes aren’t fully constructed yet, but you look great! I think we’ll fit right in,” Ron said, grinning at his own reflection.
Potter’s green eyes lit up all of a sudden, and although this surprised Draco, he didn’t let his mask of defiance slip.
Oh! And the dress from the previous chapter is actually based on a real dress, that for some reason I can't provide a link to, no matter what I try😭
“Trying to teach you to dance, now stop running away!” Draco replied. He felt light and jovial, mirth bubbling through him pleasantly. His bun had come undone, and Draco let his hair fall. Harry seemed to pick up on his friend’s mood, and relaxed in response, allowing Draco to maneuver them into the correct position.
of apparition. He leapt up to open the door and invited Harry back inside with a teasing comment. Then he went back into the kitchen and produced the telephone, smiling triumphantly.
Y'know what, you get two for your patience. Plus the length of these is... yikes. Chapter title based on Where Is Your Heart At by Jamie Cullum (you may recognise it as the song the frogs sing in the movie Meet The Robinsons)
look how far you’ve come,” the compliments and reassurance poured from Harry’s mouth and this time, Draco looked up. He saw an expression of fondness and determination. And a rare gentle smile, that made the bright shine of his green eyes stand out more than ever. Draco smiled back, as best he could.
, I just thought miserable was a bit of an exaggeration that's all,” Harry attempted to explain his position, which only served to further baffle the blond.
him. He loved the way his hair grew wild, like the manor’s neglected rose bushes before it was sold. Draco loved laughing with him and making fun of him and touching him, and looking at him like he’d hung the stars. And Draco adored the way Harry looked at him in that exact moment. Their eyes met, and for the first time up close, Draco saw that same admiration reflected back in Harry’s eyes.
It's been a hot minute, so let's post another chapter, shall we? Just realising this is my first independent Harry Potter fic! Congrats I guess?
I've been very good and I've written about three more chapters since I've been gone. It's getting good, everyone!
“Yes,” Harry answered, “I agree. I think everyone can be so defensive all of the time, that they miss it. But, yeah, it’s obvious if you pay attention. You just need some love, that’s all.”
Ron hopped off the raised platform he was getting measured on and kissed his wife. The tailor protested but Ron kept her encircled in his arms and said, “You look lovely, Hermione,” kissing her once more on the nose. Then he returned to the platform while apologising to the tailor, who just huffed.
“Is that why you keep following me?” he continued, “Again," he added with a narrowing of the eyes. This only accentuated his vibrant orange eye make up, making his stare even more fiery. Harry should’ve been put off by that, he really should’ve.
“Well, I… um, that is… you see, it’s like this… ahem - excuse me - um…” Harry said. Or rather, attempted to say, through flustered stuttering. His eyes bulged as he stammered, and Draco couldn’t help but burst out laughing.
It was 9:30 in the morning, Harry had a late shift the previous night. Currently, he was nursing a cup of strong coffee brewed by Ronald Weasley. Why was it brewed by his best mate and not himself? Because Harry Potter had been woken up an hour ago to an owl plucking at his earlobe, requesting his assistance in calming a hysterical Hermione Granger.
“Fine,” he sighed, resigned to his fate. He dragged Harry to the boudoir and sat, before knocking Harry off his feet with
?” said Draco, “Potter, how about ‘I’m gay,’ how’s that for a reason?” he finished. That shut Potter right up. Briefly.
Draco began rattling off instructions, and Harry followed them to the best of his ability - which turned out to be pretty damn decent, to his credit.
He’d be remiss to ignore the parallels between him and Potter. Always at odds. Hot and cold. Either freezing or burning one another.
“Well, you probably already know what I’m going to say, ‘Mione. But, the Prophet has always just been a glorified gossip column. I don’t know why they would have changed now,” said Harry.

answers, and by Salazar, Potter was going to give them to him. As Potter took a bite of biscotti, Draco spoke.
Hi! So I made a pretty sizable mistake lol. I got Madame Malkin's and Flourish and Blott's completly mixed up 😬. The former is a robe shope, the latter is a BOOK SHOP. It's been a hot minute since I read the books, please don't hurt me😂
Harry had seen a kinship between them, and it had made Draco rethink how he thought of himself and his life. He wanted to give the Malfoys a good name, but he wanted to do it by being a good man. Harry was right, they were both given impossible choices. And Harry had surrendered to his fate as much as Draco had. Harry taught him to be brave, to find a source of pride that rested on him as a person, not his blood status.
he thought furiously. Potter’s voice swam back into focus,   “Oh! And most importantly, to overshadow and intimidate the pureblooded hosts and high profile ‘guests’ of these balls, so they won’t dare profit from the harm they caused (or failed to prevent) during the war," Potter ended his enthusiastic tirade with a broad grin, such that Draco had only ever seen him give those insufferable friends of his - noticed in passing, of course, Potter may be a stalker but Draco was not… definitely not.
Draco felt a tug in his chest. His grey eyes met shimmering green ones. Harry paid attention to him, enough that he saw past Draco’s well-maintained mask. He found him
Because, and he didn’t want to be thinking this, but surely it was true? Surely Draco Malfoy, after almost ten years, was yet again
. Potter’s eyes had strayed to the Mark - which Draco had opted not to hide, completely on a whim, mind you - and he seemed angry…
“I might as well have…” said Hermione, “but I think I’m making a lot of good progress with the ministry workers here. I think they’re warming to me, Harry!” she chattered excitedly.
He'd make new choices, they both could. Nobody expected anything of them anymore. Draco had always felt suffocated by this fact, like he'd lost a purpose. Especially after his mother passed away. But doing this…
Harry was trying very hard to ignore the rest of the ball, to resist the urge to turn around and stare at Malfoy again. Perhaps trying a little bit
. The man’s eyes briefly widened and Draco felt his charming demeanor crack slightly. Harry pulled on his collar as if it were too tight, or the room too hot, and looked away studiously.
Draco marched through the house purposefully, newspaper in hand. He knew Pansy would be hot on his heels, excited at the prospect of drama. Blaise would follow to make sure Draco didn’t do anything drastic, or messy, or involving himself.
“Really?” said Potter, “because I was sure that it was a way of not only showing your personal growth since the war, but also to display your contempt for the pureblooded ideals that your family associated with for so long, and to bring attention to the harm caused by it,” he explained, and every word was like an arrow to the stone fortress surrounding Draco. He… he knows? He paid that much attention to him? Why?
Malfoy’s heels clicked loudly, as all he did next was walk into and across the hall, in the direction of the buffet table. The feathers shifting and no-doubt tickling his chest, and arms - and legs -  as he went, and the hanging sleeves fluttered lazily in his wake.
Two hours went by, and the huge and ornate venue for the Gala kept filling up with people and conversation and the music of the band was slowly fading into the background at this point. Hermione walked up to Harry, seemingly slightly out of breath.
Draco suspected this may be the case. Be that as it may, tonight would give him the answer, even if he… he didn’t know how to feel about it.
"The dress is--" and he couldn't help the way he stopped for a moment. Because he had meant to say 'lovely'. But just then Draco (when did Harry start calling him by his first name?) caught his eye and smiled. Smug and red with lipstick to match the rest of the ensemble. He winked at Harry, face sparkling with some makeup product or other ”--
to bear his emotions on his sleeve, and Draco would always have the uncomfortable urge to cut open his skull and rummage around in his brains.
“Hey, how are your hands?” he asked. In lieu of an answer, Draco held up his still slightly quivering hands. The man hummed, as if in thought. If Draco weren’t so shaken up, he would’ve made a joke about the possible dangers of a thinking Harry. He didn’t, though.
He… how could he know so much? Or better still, how could Draco not have noticed the similarities between them…
It also had one single long sleeve, boldly on Malfoy's right side, hugging the man's arm up to his wrist, but putting the arm marred by the Dark Mark in full view of the crowd. Along with the scars. Harry's fist clenched and his throat closed up - but with a deep breath, he calmed himself. Malfoy wouldn't have let them see it if he wasn't in a better place. The absence of a glamour was his choice and had nothing to do with Harry or any of the Gala guests.
, in fact, know how to use a telephone. He was fine until the woman Harry met at the chip shop (Caron, he’d said) insisted on inquiring about the nature of Harry and Draco’s relationship.
Harry was gone for a while, so Draco meandered about his kitchen, and located his telephone. The one that had never been used… that Hermione helped him get. Maybe Harry would help him with it, and wouldn’t he be surprised! That his old-fashioned wizarding friend had acquired a real telephone.
Harry spoke up once more, “Have you considered that this isn’t your problem to fix? That it might not even be a problem?” he asked. Hermione sighed.
All at once, the great white doors leading into the hall swung open, revealing a figure clothed in shimmering red. Malfoy hadn’t come in through any of the staircase entrances, but rather straight through the front door. This dress was similar in style to the white one Harry had seen, with the diamonds, they contrasted each other. It was also a bardot - so Malfoy’s pale shoulders and collarbones were totally exposed as the off-the-shoulder sleeves wrapped around his arms and seamlessly joined the front, plunging into a
Another week, another chapter! My buffer is... depleting😅 I've been really dysfunctional lately so i haven't been writing as much. (pray for me y'all, my physical health is like a roller coaster right now)
Draco relinquished his grip of Harry’s hand and moved to the center of the room, beckoning the other man to follow. The gryffindor complied without question, but startled when Draco placed a hand on his shoulder.
“No,” Harry said, “I think she could tell you just weren’t used to such… friendly treatment. I think she thought you were sweet, more than anything,” he explained.
“Unfortunately Harry, when one is running for Minister of Magic, Public Relations is a very real problem. You have to have a stance, a solution, or at the very least - an opinion - on everything,” said Hermione, “and Draco Malfoy is taking over the Prophet. And it’s not just them either, every news outlet in wizarding Britain wants a piece of the pie. But the Prophet, being funded by the Ministry, is our only current concern…” she trailed off, gazing at the cover of the paper in her hand, “he’s not even being invited to these anymore, on account of upstaging the hosts constantly. He just shows up. Such a pity, too… the dresses are so nice…” she sighed longingly at the picture on the cover, of which Harry could not see.
“So Muggles have their own versions of elves?” Astoria asked. “Humanoid ones who don’t do housework?”
“I did enough last night, thanks,” Harry retorted. “My aunt wants me to go to the village, but I have no idea how to get there. Could you tell me which way to go?”
“So we’re searching for imaginary creatures then? Muggles are distinctly un-magical, and if their creatures did exist, our kind would have found proof of them by now.”
“Then I eat PB and J sandwiches,” Harry said, grinning weakly. It soon fell from his face at Ginny’s disapproving look, which she’d clearly learned from her mother. “You don’t need to worry about me, Gin, I’m doing fine, honestly. Or, I’m doing better, at least. Marigold is really pleased with how I’m progressing.”
He was a self-confessed size queen, and quite frankly, didn’t think there was anything better than a huge cock pounding him in the arse. Harry couldn’t be sure as sadly he hadn’t seen Draco’s cock hard, but he imagined it would be the bigger than any other cock he’d taken.
"I assure you, you won't be doubting my abilities once we're done," Draco said as he pushed Harry gently until he was on his back. He spread Harry's legs and slid between them so they could kiss again.
Draco was about to tell Harry how stupid that sounded, when Harry switched the device on and Draco instantly cringed at the loud static noise that blasted out of it.
Draco was entirely focused on the music, his face serene and calm. His long fingers moved deftly across the ivory keys--fingers that had brought Harry to new heights of pleasure--and the tune he was playing was utterly enchanting. It was a piece perfectly suited to be the backdrop of a glorious, magical, fantasy world, and Draco had chosen it because he said he knew Harry would like it.
Harry's body turned to ice as he passed through the glass, then began to tingle like there were thousands of burning needles stabbing into his skin. Though the sensation faded almost as quickly as it had come, there was still a strange throbbing in his veins, like his magic itself hated being away from their own realm.
All there was to do now was tell Draco what he wanted, and hopefully he wouldn't humiliate himself in the process.
"Don't be a prat," Harry retorted. "Go and get our drinks. I can already feel the glitter fusing with my soul."
Harry’s concern seemed to seep through the board and into Draco, just a little bit. For such a silly board, Harry was treating it like something extremely volatile, and given Harry’s previous, well-renowned reckless carelessness, it was no wonder his anxiety was rubbing off on Draco.
“Your life must have been bad, then, if being with me has been your highlight,” Potter said, not looking like he was sure whether to look grim or sympathetic.
Ava stepped forwards and stumbled, and Harry caught her easily in his arms. "I just wanted to be happy," she sobbed.
He didn’t know what he had to expect making such a decision on a whim, but with Draco by his side, it could only be a good thing.
“Do you want to try something different?” Harry asked after they got back to their hotel room, leaning against the door with a casual air.
“He's ‘eager for some action,’” Draco said, quoting Blaise. “Surely you must know that means he’s going to try and get Daphne into bed with him tonight.”
It was the deposit and furnishing an apartment that was his problem. While he desperately tried to save up some funding, he was forced to continue to intrude.
There was nary even a second for Draco to register the cool air on his cock before it was replaced by the hot wetness of Harry’s mouth.
And just like the students at Durmstrang, the kids at Hogwarts really seemed to be enjoying their classes. Harry had never been much of a studious academic himself, so his lessons tended to be practical based, with theory filtered through so nobody—including him—would have to sit through tedious lectures.
He fell silent as Malfoy pressed a finger against his lips. “Kiss me then,” he said simply. “If it feels right, then you can thank me for helping you by going on a date with me. If it feels wrong, then I’ll let you go with no hard feelings and we can pretend I never asked you out in the first place.”
Harry yelped as he stepped into the lake, surprised by just how chilly the water was. When he turned around, Draco was smirking.
“Buonasera, bellissimo,” a voice said beside Harry. Harry looked to see an admittedly attractive man, with tan skin, deep chocolate eyes, and an athletic figure.
Harry jumped, spinning round guiltily to face Malfoy. He'd never told Malfoy about the Mirror of Erised, or that he was going to be looking at it himself.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry in response, but kept his eyes locked on Luna as he mouthed ‘yes, and it was great.’
“I said you could kiss me, not that I’d kiss you,” Malfoy teased. “Sometime before Christmas, if you please.”
"It has become apparent tonight that the seventh-year Ravenclaw, Miss Ava William, has gone missing," McGonagall said. Harry felt his blood turn to ice. "Her dorm-mates raised the alarm, and per protocol I had to get an Auror's statement before I could declare anything to you. The Aurors found nothing suspicious, and given Miss William's issues with anxiety and depression, they believe it is simply a case of a runaway teenager." McGonagall sniffed." I for one, feel confident Miss William has not crossed the school borders, unless she somehow managed to beat security designed to keep out the Darkest of wizards. But the Aurors insist on focusing their search outside of Hogwarts, which means I must ask if any of you are willing to search the castle. I know the winter holidays start tomorrow and you have families to go home to but—"
Robards’ mission for them turned out to be an investigation into a safehouse that a suspected mafia-style gang were believed to have used in the past. One of their own, Selwyn, had recently been murdered, and as a result Selwyn’s brother had been willing to exchange some information to the Aurors. In Harry’s experience, professional criminal gangs were very particular about not leaving a shred of evidence behind, but Robards was just hoping they could get lucky.
“How did those two become friends?” Draco asked, while Potter began flicking switches on the box. “They don’t seem like they have anything in common.”
“Fuck, more, more, please,” he begged,shamelessly, grinding his arse to get Draco’s cock deeper. His eyes were almost rolling into the back of his head from the overwhelming pleasure coursing through his body.
Once they were far enough out, Harry stopped the charm on the oars, bringing them to a stop. He opened up a small bag, and brought out a large box which could only have fit inside the bag through the use of magic.
In the light of the moon, Harry Potter was ethereally beautiful. His midnight black hair framed his face, his vibrant emerald eyes looking into Draco’s with a look of pure adoration and desire.
“Turn around for me, there’s a good boy,” Draco commanded, and Harry eagerly complied. There was something about that tone of voice that would have had Harry doing anything Draco asked of him.
“It’s nice you cook the way your grandmother taught you,” Harry said. “I never knew any of my grandparents. Are your family all Italian?”
Though his own art skills were incredibly limited, Harry had come to have a deep appreciation for art of all kinds, and Lecce was an entire city of art.
They chained their bikes up to a tree, and shed most of their clothes in a neat pile. This close, Harry could see the fine dusting of blond hair on Draco’s slender but firm thighs, and the briefs were form-fitting enough that Harry could see the bulge where Draco’s dick rested against the material. Harry licked his lips, and forced himself to look back at Draco’s face. Thankfully, Draco had his hand shading his eyes as he looked at over the lake, and hadn’t noticed Harry’s staring or his accompanying blush.
“Sadly, you aren’t being paid to sunbathe,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “And these creatures aren’t imaginary.”
Harry opened the limoncello, the metal pull releasing with a click and a hiss. Though the drink was no longer ice cold, the tart lemon flavour was refreshing. He pulled his knees to his chest and rested his book against them, turning the pages with one hand and using the other to sip his drink.
“Strange, questionable noises don’t make proof for anything,” Draco said, sighing. “And I don’t mind what we go after next, but I think we should go somewhere hot. If we’re going to chasing make-believe creatures, we might as well get some sun out of it.”
“Hmm,” Draco smirked. “The jury’s still out on you. Still, if I had to share my entire days and nights with any of Ginevra’s friends, I’m glad it’s you.”
"Oh, yes, I see now," Malfoy said haughtily, tugging at his collar. His cheeks had gone pink, no doubt embarrassed from looking into the mirror wrong. "I see myself surrounding by piles and piles of gold. Why didn't you tell me about this before you came down here? We're supposed to be partners on this, but instead I had to ask that pompous almost-headless ghost where you were."
“Nothing,” Draco said, shaking his head and sounding faintly amused. “I just find fantasy worlds a little
He plonked down onto the first empty space he came across, his eagerness to sit down causing him to overshoot and land half on someone's thigh.
“She’s, uh, not my type,” Harry said, and his blush deepened as he continued to look up somebody who was
Harry was in his room, cross-legged on the bed listening to his walkman. It was only when the music went silent between songs that he could hear voices in the room next door. He paused his walkman and pulled his earbuds out so that he could hear better.
As soon as Harry got the key he gestured for Draco to follow him, taking him into a lift that only went up or down—a very basic version of the ones at the Ministry of Magic.
“Tell me about it,” Draco said, glowering. “What are you doing? Did you know you have paint on your face? Here, let me-”
He smiled again, and Draco took a healthy gulp of his beer to try and ignore the fluttering feeling in his stomach at the sight. It didn’t help.
“I’m glad you care about my happiness,” Harry said with a wry grin. “But don’t you think that everything at some point had to have existed without evidence?”
“Alright, alright. You’re welcome, by the way,” he said, giving Draco and Potter a mock salute before strolling away with an equally amused looking Daphne.
Harry didn’t think he’d ever felt like this about anyone before, and didn’t know he could even experience emotions so intense.
"Actually," Harry said coyly, hoping desperately that Draco wouldn't be able to feel how fast and hard his heart was beating. "I was wondering if maybe you'd like to fuck me."
Dudley clapped Draco on the shoulder as he left, leaving his departed seat beside Harry invitingly open.
Draco considered him for a moment. “I’ll take you; we can go by bike. I’m not usually so generous, but I need to post this letter. Find Dobby and ask him to get out mine and my mother’s bike--she’s around your height so you can use hers. I’ll be finished by the time you come back.”
“Harry won’t be the only one making eyes at someone in the museum,” Ginny said, shooting Draco a sly look. “We’ll just catch up with you at the campervan later, so you boys have fun.”
A number of different thoughts rushed into Harry’s head at once. What would this mean for them? Was it a one-off or did Draco want more? Would it ruin their now quite friendly relationship? How many double figures was Draco actually talking about? Was he just mocking him?
Harry followed Ginny out of the attic and down two flights of stairs to the kitchen. He washed his hands and face in the sink while Ginny clattered about in the pantry, and by the time he sat down, a plate filled with peanut butter and jam sandwiches were waiting.
"Oh,” said Potter, finally getting it, “I suppose I never considered that you had a choice." he admitted.
"Well forgive me if I don't take your word for it,” said Potter. Draco bristled, his nostrils flared in outrage.
The form-fitting bodice then led into an equally form-fitting, floor-length skirt with a slit in the front right. A slit accentuated by more feather detailing along the left side, and around the hemline where it pooled slightly and dragged effortlessly along the polished wood floor.
Draco felt strength pour into him, and he continued speaking. “Since I started pulling stunts though… and working with Hummingbird, and--” he squeezed Harry’s hand, he wanted to say
Pretty sure the reason my chapter lengths vary so widely is because I seperate them by major plot points, like stepping stones in the story. Some of these are more... concise than others.
He ruminated in the carriage, with no Blaise or Pansy to distract him from his thoughts today. In truth, Draco was angry. Did Potter really just see him as the Mark on his arm? As if he had a choice…
“What a load of bowtruckle piss,” he scoffed, dropping the Prophet on the glass table before the three of them. It was all tripe, the lot of it. The sentiment was probably true, someone like Potter did all his best lying with a truthful scaffolding, but still. He’d seen Potter at every one of those balls. Coincidence his arse.
That is, until Malfoy slowly and deliberately dragged the heel of the shoe along the floor. Eliciting a collective gasp from the entire hall, the friction of the shoe created huge sparks and - to everyone’s shock and intense worry - the dress caught alight like so much dry kindling.
How could Draco forget why he was here? Potter hadn’t changed. How disappointing. Draco remembered the gold hair ornament currently affixed to his hair. A phoenix. How sentimental of him.
Eventually Draco’s resentment festered so much that he marched across the hall to confront the Gryffindor. He
type,” the other man went along with the banter, as usual. But Draco saw an opportunity, a chance to maybe get a reaction out of the man, and his mouth was moving before he could think it through.
“What’s so wrong with keeping up with someone when their message is one you sympathise with?” said Harry, with all that bloody Gryffindor stubbornness.
him. For a significant moment, Potter looked almost tortured. This was one of those annoyingly rare moments that he opted
For anyone having their vaccine soon, make sure you have a ride home, bring a friend or family member if you can, drink plenty of fluids, and don't get it in your dominant arm! In case it aches after😁
He opened the envelope. Inside was an excerpt from the Prophet of the interview he did with that nervous bloke, and a note.
Hurried footfalls approached his boudoir and suddenly Harry’s hands were anchoring him to the Earth by the shoulders. He arose from his seat.
“Until we get there, that is,” said Ron, “you know all those bloody awful purebloods are all crawling out of the woodwork now. There’s bound to be loads at the Gala,” Ron warned the little group.
It was harder to spot under the foundation and bright colours of the makeup, but Harry could’ve sworn Malfoy flushed a little. Right before he went back to scowling. There were two locks of hair on either side of his face not swept into the bun. They were sweet, they framed his face well.
But I figured I'd give her a welsh name, Caron is one of several welsh names that means 'love' 😊 she's like a Karen-antithesis. Everyone loves a huggable maternal figure😁
Was Harry… engineering this scenario? If so… why? Draco forced himself to press on before he came to any… odd conclusions. He gripped Harry’s hand and complained audibly about the whole situation. As he drew the lines - which he had to concentrate extra hard on, since he was maneuvering a hand that
“Not like I’m going to give it to anyone anyway, is it Pans?” said Draco. With a few sharp gestures of his wand, he sliced out the interview from the Prophet.
Harry obviously misunderstood the blush, and reassured Draco that the phone was fine, but needed to be plugged in. Draco remembered Hermione mentioning that, and frantically searched for the place he knew would work. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him, and when he turned around, he saw the man was smiling softly. Draco’s heart fluttered.
Draco folded up the parchment and the newspaper cutting, and put all three items in an envelope which he hastily sealed with string (he hoped forgoing the wax seal wouldn’t cause any issues). He scribbled the address onto it, and chose his fastest owl, tying the envelope to his leg.
His anger continued to simmer as he watched Potter linger by the buffet table, stuffing his face, pacing like a caged animal.
As the Slytherin made his rounds of the venue, Harry slipped into an alcove and remained out of sight, just as he always did before the blond could spot him staring. He wasn’t… quite sure why he did this. But he felt like he should.
“Yes, well… I want to reapply for the position,” said Draco, “I mean, let’s face it - I can’t keep pulling ballroom stunts forever. I want to start contributing again, even if it’s just something small like that potions shop. More than just making a spectacle of myself,” he explained.
Well, Harry understood. He'd never seen someone look so free. Such freedom would've exhilarated Harry beyond hope, but Draco remained the picture of poise, slowly and deliberately taking each step.
The hall erupted into the loudest and most uproarious applause that Harry had ever heard. People cheered and whooped, and Malfoy remained poised, chin high in the air as if he were above it all.
“I’ve had it before, you boorish churl,” said Draco, quietly, not quite mustering the feeling behind the insult. He accepted the offered food, and savoured it. A peace offering, it felt like. Like in that British muggle religion. An olive branch to mark the end of the flood, a new beginning.
“Right, so sorry, this is your job, you know what you’re doing. I’ll just, um… do you mind if I use the fitting room to try on my dress?” she asked the tailor. He grunted his approval, and Hermione swept out of the room with her covered dress in her arms. The tailor muttered something along the lines of ‘anything for quiet’. Poor chap.
Draco concentrated on his theatrics when he entered the hall, with the wrong intent behind it the complex spellwork on the dresses could go south and they would both burn to a crisp - along with Draco. As it happened, the display was executed perfectly, and he knew the decoy dress now sat perfect and pristine back at Hummingbird’s - just as planned.
“I’ve had it before, you boorish churl,” he said, quietly, with little venom to the barb. He took the biscotti and ate it in several small, refined bites.
“I danced around my room, pretending I was at a grand ball. I imagined that everyone there was so flabbergasted by my appearance that they were stunned silent--” he shuffled his feet, shoulders hunched, “--and I always pictured two figures dancing. One in beautifully tailored dress robes, and the other in a stunning enchanted gown. As they danced the dress would swoop through the air and fan out elegantly, catching the light
Harry glanced around the hall and sure enough, everyone was chattering excitedly at each other, looking at the different staircases lining the round walls of the hall. The whole place was filled with this…
“I didn’t mean it like that!” he said, slightly panicked, “I just don’t believe that you would find it that difficult to get along with Astoria Greengrass, weren’t you friends at Hogwarts?” said Harry.
He wanted to cry, he wanted to clutch Potter so tightly he’d break the fastenings of his dress… he wanted…
been stalking me again, haven’t you?” he accused. It was Harry’s turn to feel his cheeks heat. He really had been, hadn’t he? He told himself it’d be impolite to reject all these invitations, but it was a really weak excuse. They were all weak excuses, that was why Malfoy sent him that note.
Which led him to the scene unfolding before him. Of a toddler having been flooed to school twenty minutes ago, and a one year old sitting next to him, chewing on a campaign poster.
“There, finally,” said Draco, moving on to mascara. With his own hands, this time, “did you know this tool is called a mascara
word for it?” he accused. “What? Don’t trust the word of a Death Eater?” said Malfoy, getting increasingly angrier and Harry needed to stop staring at the fucking dress and be better at conversations, for Merlin’s sake.
Draco applied his lipstick with great care, watching himself in the mirror. He paused, and blinked at his fierce expression staring back at him under the colour changing makeup. His lips were pastel blue, and he pouted at himself.
“Ah, we’re nearly to the village,” Draco said. “Allow me to buy your cousin his sweets, and put the money your aunt gave you towards your moving out fund. I’ll give you a little extra, too, so you can buy yourself some limoncello. It’s a traditional drink here in Italy. I trust you know your way back if I leave you now?”
