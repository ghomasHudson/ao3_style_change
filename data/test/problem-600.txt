The man really was passionate about charms, he was passionate about magic itself, and that was what made him a great teacher and head of house.
Somehow, Nott had found them, Nott was the reason Draco wasn't talking to him, he didn't know for sure, but Harry thought that the Forbidden Forest scared the blond. He didn't need to be afraid, Harry would protect him.
"Well, that much is obvious!" Draco quipped, tugging at Harry's arm with all his might, the twins and Ron were helping him but the man had a good grip, Harry was like a piece of rope.
Harry's cheeks pinked, he must have a thing for compliments, his cheeks always pinked when Draco complimented him, which wasn't often, but he could only assume that it was the same for other people, after all, why would it be different for Draco alone? A rather ridiculous thought.
Hermione exchanged a look with Ron and Harry and they left the common room, going to meet Dumbledore. This was getting out of hand; if they couldn't talk to Draco, then they would have Dumbledore do it. Maybe Dumbledore already knew, he did seem to know everything…
Draco turned left and walked down the hallway, most likely leaving the room. Hermione didn't want to follow him, but she needed to know what was happening. Maybe following him would lead to clues, and she had the invisibility cloak.
Draco stood outside Dumbledore's office, he had been instructed to come here before any of his classes.
Draco snapped his fingers, "Eyes on the clouds Weasley, and ears on me, I have some words for you!" Ron raised his face and looked at Harry, who was looking back at him in pity.
Just as he left the room, he heard Finnigan snickering and whistling as Harry tried to hide his head in his hands. The tips of his ears were red and his mouth was twisted in a cringe. Draco chuckled at the sight and cast a quick
"Alright, we're already kinda late, we need to go now." Harry hopped off of the armchair he was sitting in.
Draco laughed nervously and speed-walked out of the great hall, he would definitely tell Tom about this, they hadn't spoken much last night, Draco had to go back to his own dorm that day so he hadn't had much time to talk to Tom.
"No, we will not send him to Durmstrang, I do not like him conversing with such filth, they are beneath us, Draco." She turned to face him briefly and then turned back to Lucius.
It still confused Draco how suddenly Weasley's attitude changed towards him, he still wondered whether the Weasel had ulterior motives, but he knew it was unlikely, maybe he really could just become friends with anyone, didn't know it did that.
Draco jumped off the bed and made his way out of the dorm, Flitwick had told him that he didn't need to bring any books, so he didn't, it felt weird not having anything on him, but he also found himself looking foward to the tutoring session. Flitwick had always been praised for his skill in dueling, and now he wanted to teach Draco how to do it, he may  have been sorted into Ravenclaw this time, but nothing could take away his hunger for power, it came with the hunger for knowledge.
Hello to my lovely readers, you might have noticed that I extended the story ending by, about...41 chapters.
"Books can take you only so far in this field," Trelawney said, practically reading his mind. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry and Ron give Hermione cheeky grins. Hermione wore a shocked look on her face. Draco barely refrained from laughing, he could practically hear her gasping in her mind.
"A Veelas allure is very powerfull Mr. Malfoy, the weak willed will fall prey to it, and that is a dangerous thing. People will try to touch you, and you must tell them no, some will still try, if they do then you are free to use as much magical force is necessary to get them off. I do not want you to feel guilty about hurting them, while yes the Allure will be strong, it is not unfightable, and only those that want to give in, will."
"Harry wouldn't let us wake you up until Mum made him, he fell asleep with you there you know, carried you to the bed and everything. We tried to put you down on the bed, but anytime you were off Harry's lap, you started to throw a fuss." Fred (or maybe George) laughed.
"Hop in, mate! We're going on a rescue mission." A familiar voice called out, and Draco looked over to see three redheaded figures, the Weasley's.
Nearing the portrait, Draco waited for the Eagle to rise, it always took a bit too long, was it faulty or something, it could be another project to work on, fixing the damn door.
The thought of learning more sent a thrill down Draco's spine, with knowledge came power, and he did like power, just not in the megolomaniac kind of sense.
He wasn't even signing his letters anymore, Draco realized his hands were shaking. Why wasn't Harry getting any of his letters? He said that Ron and Hermione weren't writing to him either, he should owl them-
"Draco Malfoy." He answered, and Arthur's eyes dimmed a bit, his smile faltering at the prospect of having a Malfoy in his home, Draco knew he should be offended, but he didn't mind much really.
Draco pushed through the crowd to see why they were there in the first place, and his heart sunk when he saw who was there.
Davies seemed to jump, Snape was right behind him, looking at him with the look in his eyes, the look that everyone already knew meant that he was pissed and you were definitely getting dentention (and house points if you weren't Slytherin).
"And you must be Draco." Mr Granger stuck out his hand and Draco faltered a bit before touching it, he would have to learn how to get used to muggles and all the other sorts of people, he had only ever consorted with purebloods, and they never stuck out their hand so openly.
"Yes, what are you doing, Potter?" Davies and Malfoy said at the same time, causing them to look at each other in disgust.
They hadn't spoken about what Firenze had said in the forest, but he had caught Harry looking at him strangely throughout the day, but he didn't think it too out of the ordinary, Harry often looked over at Draco.
be able to change the timeline, fixed points do not mean that he is unable to change anything. A fixed point is the universe building the basis for that line, and since this is a branch of the main line, certain things have to stay the same to make up the context of that universe.
"Hurry, we have to get Draco." Harry chose to ignore Ron's words and continued down the hall. Yes, he was afraid of the basilisk, but that didn't mean he would give up on Draco.
"Welcome back to the world of the living, Dray." Hermione punched his shoulder lightly, and it hurt, but not unbearably so.
"No! Dumbledore made me swear not to." Draco looked Hermione in the eyes, there were tears in her eyes, Draco wasn't kidding when he said she was sensitive (at least, as a first year).
Now, an update on the Potter and Weasley situation, they had been talking quite a lot more nowadays, it seemed as if Weasley was starting to warm up to him, and he did appreciate that.
Draco followed both of them as they led him to the Headmaster's office, he didn't want to see him again, he
"Ron, are you sure you know how to fly this?" Before Ron could open his mouth, Draco interrupted him,
It was Monday. Hogwarts always started on a Monday. That meant there was just barely less than a week before he could meet Trelawney for their 'training.' He had made sure to take Divination. It was a win-win really; his friends were taking the class too and this way, he could use his 'Seer powers' to get good grades.
"What is this?" Draco whispered, trying to free his hand, he and Hermione may have been calm, but Ron and Harry weren't.
He was standing next to the mirror for some reason, he looked into it, and saw Harry, holding the stone. He looked at Harry, who winked at him, the stone was in his pocket. Quirrel was saying something again, but another vision, a shorter one this time, came into his mind, Harry touching Quirrel and him melting.
"Sorry, Dray, but it makes sense that it's Snape, I mean, he already tried to steal it, good thing Fluffy was there." Harry seemed set on convincing him it was Snape, Draco opened his mouth to tell him about how wrong he was, but suddenly, he was overwhelmed with dread.
"We're Ravenclaws. Third years, yes. But we can put our brains to good use. Think of it as a thinking exercise." Anthony clapped his hands together.
The chairs weren’t the normal wood but instead fluffy and comfy chairs with the occasional beanbag thrown in for decoration. Books were littered on randoms shelves. The desks were placed in odd places while the desks themselves were different shapes. Some circles while others were squares. And if you looked up you could see the purple drapes that decorated the ceiling.
"Yes! Hermione figured it out, but I helped! We know that something's wrong and we'll help you. I mean, what are friends for, right?" He tried to smile.
Draco sighed. "Alright, but don't expect me to Zonko’s with you." He directed the last part at Terry who, in response, gasped and clutched his chest as if he had been mortally wounded.
He had to leave. His breathing picked up. He had to get out of here. His heart started hammering in his chest.
Before he could write more, the words were sucked into the page and new writing took its place, it was fancier than Draco's,
"Something you want to tell me?" He asked when he noticed the shifty eyes and obvious layer of sweat on the boy in front of him. It was a look he recognized, a look he had seen on Father when faced with an angry Mother. A look he had seen an immeasurable amount of times this summer.
Making his way through the common room, he noticed the dirty looks he got from some of his older classmates, he didn't care, it would take a while and a lot of action before their views of him started to change.
Draco paused for a moment. "I know you want to protect everyone around you. But...try to protect yourself sometimes too. You can't protect us if you're dead." Draco put his hand on Harry's shoulder.
Draco was a sort of mix between the two. "Yes," he responded shortly, making a quick note in the textbook before flipping the page.
"Hmm.” Harry was still looking at Draco, like he could solve all the boy's mysteries by just staring at him.
"I know...I just..." He trailed off, his eyes never leaving the Diary. Just then, Harry came barreling into the common room.
But don't worry! I've got an outline and an amazing beta who both motivate me to give my all to this story. I really enjoy the liberty I have with the whole Seer and Divination thing.
"It's alright." Draco sat down beside him. Harry threw one of his pillows at the wall, not looking at him.
clearly." Harry nodded and took a handful of floo powder, Draco silently thought that it was pretty impossible to mess up saying Diagon Alley correctly, who could mess up such a simple-
"I heard a cat, I knew Filch was missing Mrs Norris, so I came down to see what was happening, and I saw Potter doing...
He heard Ron snicker behind him, but he didn't find it funny, now he didn't like Malfoy's attitude at Madame Malkin's and how he had tauted Ron, but he didn't deserve to be bullied, besides, the older Ravenclaw reminded him of Dudley, he should step in, yeah, he should-
Right now, he needed to focus on figuring out how to defeat Quirrel, something in Potter defeated him, somehow, he still didn't have all the details about that. All he knew was that Potter had killed Quirell, expelling the spirit out of his body. How he would recreate the power of something that great, he didn't know. He would have to rely on the stars to guide him from here, it had been quite some time since he had his last vision, his body must be adapting to this new magical core.
Oh, that was his godfather, he didn't look happy, and Draco was pointing a wand at him. They both looked and it and Draco laughed nervously, desperately trying to remember why he was here and where here was-
She turned her attention to Harry once more, "You look in perfect health to me. Excuse me if I don't let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not hand it in."
"What do you want us to do?" Terry asked once again. He was by no means a dumb individual, he had gotten into Ravenclaw for Pete's sake! But here he was, wondering who had downed a vial of polyjuice potion and decided to impersonate their friend. Even Anthony looked startled.
Draco didn't have to think about it, he forgave him. After all, Flitwick was Draco's favourite professor, and even Draco had thought he was going insane. The random surges of rage, as well as the blackouts, didn't help prove him wrong.
"Draco's your godson, Professor?" Harry tilted his head as he lifted Draco up, he was surprisingly light.
It reminded him of when he was a child. He couldn't understand why his parents looked at him oddly. He tried to imitate the other children but everything he did resulted in another act of cruelty. Things that he was just unprepared for. Maybe that was how he had gotten into Ravenclaw. He had always strived for the knowledge to know his parents would react. He would have plans set in place every time he did anything, making sure he could de-escalate any solution if he needed to.
"Yes, but how don't ye think the Nargles wouldn't like the Flobberworms that much because of the war between the Moon Frogs?" Hagrid asked.
Narcissa looked at Draco in disappointment, it was clear that she disapproved of his choice in friends, but it looked like she still stood by her sentiments that having her child that far away would be too much for her to bear.
Now, all he needed to do was ask Narcissa Malfoy. He hadn't met her specifically, but Draco liked to talk about her. But he had a feeling he might be just a tad bit biased as to what his mother was really like.
I'm trying to fix my mistakes, and I don't know why I can't!" The rage was still there, but now there was also sadness. His emotions were all jumbled up; he didn't know what to feel. Should he be sad, or angry?
The mood in the Transfiguration classroom was somber. Everyone who had come from Divination seemed to have a permanent frown on their face. Hermione was scowling while Ron kept on shooting Harry piteous glances. Harry was the worst of all, however. His mood had soured and every attempt at magic seemed to be going wrong for him. Draco tried his best to help his friend but even he could only do so much when a Wizard's emotions were running so high.
"There's no point in childish feuds when you have the chance to fix it, why be petty just for the sake of being petty."
She had never heard a seer make a real prophesy, it was beautiful, even if the words carried a dark meaning, the pure magic that came from the boy as he spoke the words were utterly beautiful, now she understood the look in Albus' eyes when he talked about them.
Draco thought about it for a moment, was he okay? No, he wasn't, he had just broken his friend's heart and he felt like crying, Harry and Ron would most likely never talk to him again and everything had just gotten so fucked up, he didn't even know why he had just ruined their friendship...
, I care about other people. Hagrid has helped me in the past and if he hadn't helped us with the Basilisk last year my chances of survival would have gone down the toilet." Draco raised his head, not looking like he was going to back down anytime soon.
I want to expand on Draco's relationship with the Ravenclaws so you can expect more chapters with the silver trio as I like to call them. Admittedly I got that name from the fanon Slytherin trio, but hey! You gotta get inspiration from somewhere.
It was hazy, but Draco definitely remembered Severus being there at the meeting with Dumbledore and McGonagall. Severus should have known he was a Veela. The thought had slipped his mind, what with everything else going on, but when he actually had time to think about it... it was wrong. Severus wouldn't forget something like that. It just wasn't in his character. You could make an offhanded comment about his hair ten years ago and he would still remember what you said the next time you 'had the audacity to show your face'.
"Why wouldn't I? He's nice and treats me well, unlike some people." She didn't make eye contact with him.
A Diadem, a locket and a diary, and for some reason a ring that was accompained by Dumbledore and black veins, Draco didn't know what was happening (for the first time in quite a while) but he knew that he had to get these items and he had to stop Dumbledore from wearing a ring.
was growing near. He jumped into the water that was next to him and climbed onto the statue of Salazar Slytherin.
Yes, that sounded like Crabbe and Goyle. Tell them to take a right and they turn around and go to the South Pole instead. He was a bit proud of Harry for standing up for himself. He did see the irony in it. How he had been in Nott's position more than once. But really, he just didn't want to deal with the boy right now. And from the look in Nott's eyes, he didn't want to either. He was probably just bothering them for reputation's sake. Draco had done the same thing more than once in the previous timeline.
"Come on, let's go lower, we need to find the train," Harry commanded Ron and he nodded as he lowered the car near the train tracks.
Had that look been there before? Lucius couldn't say. He had never paid much attention to Draco. Most of the things he knew about him were because of Narcissa. Or Draco would tell him himself.
then." She winked at him, she knew he was going to write in his diary again, he tried to smile at her but knew how forced it looked.
they got Harry in the car, the man fell down into some bushes and he could hear screaming behind them, he couldn't resist saying just one more thing,
The teachers were gathered around McGonagall's desk, all except Dumbledore. McGonagall stood behind her desk while the others stood in front of it. She looked incredibly stressed.
A year? Would he really be willing to wait that long? Well, he had been waiting since first year. But his feelings had only grown with him. It seemed every year Draco could come back looking even better than he did the last year and Harry would make some bumbling attempt at flirting and Draco would have no idea what he was talking about. And then the cycle would repeat. Every. Year.
The plant shrieked as it let go of Ron and Harry, Devil's Snare hated the sunlight after all. Harry and Ron fell on their arse's but were otherwise unscathed, that was good. Hermione smiled at him,
Draco heard a few chuckles around the room. He sent those he could see dirty looks. He didn't take well to people making fun of his friends.
"Where is the patient?" She yelled, a box of medicinal supplies with her, Albus smiled, Poppy always was passionate about helping her patients.
"Amazing! I have never met a student, in all my thirty years of teaching, met such a young student who was able to preform a non-verbal spell so easily and on his first try, 50 points to Ravenclaw!"
That was when Neville dropped his teacup. 9 minutes had passed. Trelawney didn't look surprised. Instead, she walked towards him and waved her wand.
have a session with Flitwick soon, the man had been practically giddy to start teaching him, especially when Dumbledore had told the little man that he was presenting as a male Veela, apparently, Flitwick loved the magic behind Veela's, and Draco knew the man would be absolutely heartbroken if he didn't show up, he was starting to think he was his favorite student.
Harry Potter and his friends were coming back from the Nearly Headless Nick's death day celebration, it was weird, all the food was rotten and they didn't exactly have fun there, they were just there because they liked Nick.
Draco didn't, sure, Snape could be a prat, but he would never try to kill Harry (at least not in broad daylight).
I'm having way too much fun writing this darling, feel free to leave a comment, I read every single one, as well as the bookmark comments, I love knowing what people think of my writing style and such.
Harry nodded, about to say something, but stopped when he heard a sniffle come from Hermione's stall. He looked at Ron and they both slowly walked up to the stall and knocked on the door.
He heard banging in the direction of his door. Anthony and Terry were probably knocking on it. But he wouldn't let them in. He couldn't let them in.
They levelled off when they reached the clouds, and Draco finally had the chance to get his bearings, and the chance to yell at Weasley.
"He's just feeling a bit under the weather." Anthony looked worried, were they hiding something from him? Strangely enough, Draco couldn't find the energy to care.
"Draco calm down, I believe you, I don't know what's happening, but we will figure this out, here." Flitwick went to his shelf and got some books from his shelf and handed them to Draco.
"It's not that big of a deal." Draco turned a corner, face on fire. They were so close to the DADA classroom. Then he would be free of this torture.
Nott himself looked livid as he glared directly at Draco. Draco winced. He had definitely heard about Lucius. That wouldn't be good when Draco would have to talk him out of being a Death Eater. Then again, Nott knew the consequences of his actions. There was no way to truly win here.
"Wonder where the git's gone to now," Ron mumbled under his breath. But Draco heard it clearly. He shot him an irritated glance, one that was returned fully. It seemed Snape would never be something they would agree upon.
"You're sweaty," Draco said dully. Stupid! It was the first thing that had come to mind. His mind had shut down and, of course, the first thing that had come out once he had successfully done a reboot was a 'You're sweaty.'
The only highlight of his summer was when he got owls from Harry, Ron and Hermione. Sometimes, he could even
"Hogwarts, now." He wanted to limit his speech and get into the castle as fast as possible. Harry helped him walk as he was still stumbling, and he was grateful, his legs felt like they were putty.
"Professor Snape, I know for a fact that Mr Potter and his friends were at Sir Nicholas' deathday party today." Professor McGonagall chimed in, and Snape looked at her, furious, his one chance at getting Potter expelled was gone.
Potter's eyes widened, and he looked away almost immediately, the reaction confused him, had he said something wrong. He couldn't think of anything that he had said that would cause Potter to be.. flustered, perhaps Potter saw someone in the mirror that he desired, but he was only eleven, most likely a school boy crush, was Potter already hooked on that Chang girl.
"I was showin' the class Buckbeak an' Nott insulted 'em even though I told 'em not tah. An' Buckbeak slashed 'em!" His accent got heavier and heavier.
"Potions, O. Defence Against The Dark Arts, O. Transfiguration, O. Herbology, E. Flying, O. Astronomy, E. History of Magic, E." Once he was done, he looked up at Draco, looking slightly impressed but far from satisfied.
"How do I talk to him?" Hermione asked Dumbledore. She trusted him; maybe he could help her. She had no idea how she would suddenly start talking to Draco after so many months of ignoring him. She wasn't like Harry; she didn't have the same connection that he had with Draco.
"No, I fashioned myself a new name, a name that I knew every wizard would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world." His eyes had a red tint to them as his voice became louder and louder.
Since Malfoy would be unable to do things like steal Neville's remembrall, Nott had to take his place, to make up the foundation so that new things could happen. Nott is his own person, he will do things differently than Malfoy because they have different moral compasses.
"I don't know, that's why we're going to do this, I'm going under the invisibility cloak, and you and Hermione will use the polyjuice, you can ask him questions, and I'll spy on him." Harry cringed at how wrong those words sounded, he didn't want to invade Draco's privacy, but something told him that Draco wouldn't tell them what was happening, or he would have already.
"Cowards!" Nott yelled after them but didn't make any move to follow. Draco was not in the mood to deal with him. His headache was already getting worse. Of course Trelawney would tell him when it started and not when it ended.
"No one was screaming, mate," Ron said, confused. Hermione was just watching them, her eyes narrowed, and Draco was suddenly reminded of McGonagall.
"Sorry mate, but we don't have enough room for all of you back there, you're gonna need to sit on Harry's lap."
Never in a million years would he have imagined himself in this position. Merlin would rise again before he would agree to this. But... the guilt for what he had done last year was eating him up inside. He would never disobey his lord but.... at the expense of his own child. The thought pained him more than he would ever admit. Could he really deny him this after the hell he had put him through last year? The summer had been hell for him. Hearing his child cry out in his sleep and the aged look in his eyes.
"Why did you apologize for what you said? I mean, you just changed, like that." Weasley snapped his fingers.
His words brought some comfort back to Draco, and he wiped the tears off of his face, he wouldn't cry again, he would explain himself to Hermione, and if she didn't believe him, then she wasn't a real friend, just like Tom said-
This one was different from all the other snippets he had gotten from the stars, this was accompained by some memories, memories that weren't his own, they weren't even like memories, they were more similar to flashes of places and things.
"Travelling back in time is disturbing the universe itself; maybe the universe is punishing you for travelling back here. I have to ask, Draco, why are you here?"
Draco was about to speak up when he heard a familiar voice, "Harry? Draco? What're yeh doing 'ere." Hagrid walked down the entrance to Knockturn, looking at Harry and Draco in confusion.
"Flashes of Jewlrey, a golden cup, a green necklace, and a blue tiara." Yellow, Green, Blue, there was something connected to Yellow Green Blue-
Sir Nicholas' birthday was today? Today was the Halloween feast as well, it would be better to be there for when Quirell would burst in, but what was the point right now? Hermione was safe, as long as Weasley hadn't said anything stupid, Draco had saw him and Hermione together but hadn't thought much of it.
Narcissa sucked in a deep breath, looking at her husband and her son, she didn't care what house he was in, she just wanted them to be happy. Draco looked at his father and nodded, "Yes."
Blood purists? He didn't remember anything like this happening last time. And why hadn't he heard of this? His mind immediately began to leap to worst-case scenarios. Was Voldemort back already? No, it wasn't physically possible for him to be back. He had planned everything so carefully. Did he manage to fuck up the timeline this badly? No, things were going so well. No, no no
Flitwick was looking at him in confusion, as well as fascination, "Your words were not your own?" He inquired.
That was when Draco had realized how much he craved knowledge, how desprately he wanted to learn and understand, to prove himself. That was how he had found that book, that book that was in the library for some unknown reason, the book that had saved him, the book that had provided him with the knowledge on how to travel back in time.
Harry coughed and pulled himself up. He gave Ron a glare before looking around the room. It was more of a cave than a room. There was a big passage in front of them. That must be where Draco was.
"Hmm? Yeah sure," He said absentmindedly. A quick glance at her mouse and he cringed. The book's cover was made with fur and he didn't even want to know what the pages were made of.
He had lost a whole year because of his carelessness. He would have to be more cautious, checking all of his things for dark enchantments would be a good start, he could be better, he knew he could. He wouldn't let all that research go to waste, all that planning and even what Potter had did for him.
"Sorry, Draco, the Wrackspurts don't want me to tell you. Besides, the Lovey Doves wouldn't want you to know right now either. They say it'll take another year at most; maybe eleven months at least." She mumbled that last part to herself. It was definitely to herself this time.
Hermione tried to stop him. "Draco!" she called out, but he didn't listen to her; he just kept on running.
Snape looked at him. "Perhaps Mr. Malfoy would be a good duelling partner?" He raised an eyebrow and Draco sighed, knowing that he would have to go up there.
"Ooh, Potter and his boyfriend?" someone drawled from behind them. Draco didn't have to turn back to know who it was.
But before, there was nothing Anthony could do about it. He was just a kid who was caught up in this. A kid who could do nothing more than feel sorry. A kid who felt like he didn't deserve the love his parents gave him when there were kids who obviously needed it more.
When he had finally come back, a few minutes had passed. Harry gave him a weird look while Trelawney gave him a knowing one. She was holding a teacup. She handed him it while her voice rang out in the class.
"Okay. I'm going to sound crazy, I know, but let's go to the library." It looked like it physically pained Ron to say those words, and despite the circumstances, Hermione giggled.
He sneered in disgust as if saying the name brought him physical pain, and Harry looked at him in confusion, he didn't understand what was happening, Draco suddenly felt...wrong.
McGonagall hesitated for a moment, her frown deepening. "His skeleton will lie in the chamber forever." She looked away.
Hary looked like he wanted to protest, but Draco started dragging him back to where he thought the exit was, he wanted to get out of this blasted forest already, he hated it here.
It seemed like an eternity, but eventually, Harry came out of the foundation, catching the snitch, while Nott fell off his broom and landed on his arse.
Draco sucked in a breath, he knew that the muggles were bad, but he had never heard of muggles hiding magic from a magic bearer, Draco briefly wondered how it would be without magic and shuddered at the prospect of it.
Everyone came running in, every teacher and every student, once they saw what the commotion was about, they were all looking at the cat in horror. In blood, it wrote,
"The one with the broken wing!" Hermione pointed at said key, it wasn't as in rhythm as all the others were.
The only thing to do was use the flying car, but who the fuck would drive it, Draco didn't know how to operate a 'car' and these two weren't exactly the brightest of the bunch. There was no other way, however, "The car?" He suggested, and Ron's eyes lit up,
Lucius bristled, looking at his only son in rage, he opened his mouth, ready to say something when Narcissa interrupted, "Lucius, darling, did you not see Draco's grades this year?" She looked at her husband sweetly.
Harry winced, no doubt remembering how he had almost become a pancake because of Weasley's awful driving skills. But it was mostly the house elf's fault. He still held a grudge against Dobby.
Perhaps that was the power that they knew not, something could have happened, what, Albus only had the slightest clue to.
"You put the book in Draco's cauldron. That day in Flourish and Blotts. He almost died." Harry's voice was deadly.
And thus Terry landed himself with Professor Snape as he ran through the types of potions that would help settle his... hormones.
She never thought she'd say this, but the detention was worth it just to see the look on Weasley's face.
He was surprised to see a racing broom (a rather ancient one), and a flurry of keys with wings flying above them. It looked oddly pleasing, he liked the little humming sounds the sentient keys made. Ron and Harry were right behind them, Ron was looking at the keys while Harry was staring at the broom. Draco looked over at Harry, a glint in his eyes,
It went silent, he opened his mouth to say something but he couldn't get anything out before Hermione slapped him. He didn't turn his head back, he stayed there in shock as she ran away, Ron and Harry looked at him, Ron was red in the face, his eyes wide and clouded with betrayal
"Professor." He nodded at both Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape who were standing beside Dumbledore, talking to him, all except Dumbledore seemed startled at the new voice.
Draco sighed and turned his attention back to his Charms book. He was due for a lesson with Flitwick soon enough. Last year had been a bit of a drag, for obvious reasons, and he was determined to make sure this year didn't go the same.
"They're attracted to negative emotions. They don't go after animals, only humans. They feed off the despair that comes off of you. Normally they're kept in Azkaban, but there are stories of the ones that roam free. The Ministry wasn't able to catch all of them, you know?"
Luna looked at both of them, a clear and wide smile on her face. And if her eyes were a little watery, no one mentioned it.
Hermione smiled and absolutely went off about all the things that she had learned, she asked him some questions and he answered as best as he could.
Lucius may love his son, but he always had dark intentions when it came to any sort of power he was gifted with.
"Pray tell, why do you need Veela suppressant potions?" He slowly added the Aconite to the mixture, his movements clearly second nature. He wasn't even looking at the cauldron, instead looking at Draco.
Draco stumbled backwards, but suddenly, he stopped, looking up at him with empty eyes, Harry stopped for a moment at seeing them, they looked so
"Library," Hermione answered and glared at Dean, challenging him to say otherwise. Dean gulped and nodded. It was nice to know that at least somebody was scared of her wrath.
"Hermione, yer gonna need to tell me what happened." Hagrid pleaded with her once more. When Ron and Harry came in he turned to them in hope,
There were multiple advantages of this form, but the one that was most prominent for a eleven year old was that he could appear as a scared child in front of the older witches and wizards that would no doubt be inside the headmasters office, a boy who didn't know what was happening and what was going on with his body.
"We're not in public, you may drop the pleasantries," he dismissed with a flick of his free hand. The other carefully stirred the potion three times.
Draco was in the great hall, everyone else had left and he was trying to get to his dorm, classes were over for the day and tomorrow he had tutoring with Flitwick, he wanted to study.
When she did something that was wrong or she pushed into others conversations, Draco gently told her that what she was doing was rude, he taught her how to analyze other people, and she was happy. He was kinder than other people, but she still saw the way people looked at him, like they were expecting him to say something completely out of turn.
"You seemed rather amused during that conversation, I would have expected you to start yelling at Davies and his companions."
"Father treats the elves horribly, but for some reason, he hates Dobby most of all. Probably because Dobby's not like most elves; he actually wants to be free." Draco shrugged.
Nott flew up to Harry, most likely mocking him, when the Snitch came up right next to him. Nott didn't notice it (how thick could you be?) but Harry did. Even when a Bludger was chasing him, he dove after the Snitch. Nott followed him right after, and they plunged into the foundation of the pitch. Draco couldn't see them, but he wasn't worried; he knew that Harry would make it out alive. He had last time.
They were coming this way. He got a book from his bag and started walking while seemingly reading it.
No one raised their hand, so Draco did. McGongall's eyes narrowed and it was quite some time before she called on him.
It was so sudden that he dropped his lamp. Death, an aura of death was coming closer, no, they were coming closer to him, why was he walking, he didn't want to walk that way, he wanted to run away,
"Sir! I was just helping Malfoy get back to his dorm, um, he got lost." Davies mumbled, the confident persona was gone.
It was completely different, seeing things from an outsider's perspective. He felt... detached, in a sort of way. He knew that he had been like that, but it hadn't sunk in yet. That he had been awful. All that anger whenever Nott insulted one of his friends or called Hermione that awful slur had been the same anger Potter had felt on Malfoy all those years ago.
"T-That's not true!" Harry said, looking back at Draco in betrayal, this wasn't the Draco he knew, and he still felt wrong! Harry didn't know what was happening, but he was certain of one thing, this wasn't his Draco! Something was very wrong.
"Wow, Draco, you have to tell us what you saw Potter doing!" Anthony exclaimed, jumping onto his bed. Why was Luna in the boy's dorm?
"Now, you have to register with the Ministry of magic if you become an Animagus, can anyone tell me the punishment for not signing?"
, plural. He belongs to the family. His true Master would be my father. House-elves always listen to the Head of the Family before anyone else. He'll be passed on to me unless my father frees him." Draco scoffed at the end.
"Wow, Hermione, how're you gonna do that?" Ron said from across him. Draco had moved from the Ravenclaw table to Gryffindor to sit with them when the feast started.
Dobby still looked suspicious, but spoke, "Dobby cannot say, but Harry Potter is in grave danger." Dobby started looking around,
who did it! I got a warning about underage magic. That's why the Dursley's put bars on my window." Draco listened to Harry rant and got more and more embarrassed on behalf of his house-elf. At the mention of the Dursley's, a question sprung to Draco's mind.
Everything suddenly clicked, ever since he had come into possession of that book everything had gone downhill, he had called Hermione that word, Tom had told him that he was getting sleepy, he wasn't getting sleepy, he was being possessed, that was why he didn't feel better after sleeping, he hadn't slept!
"Come on!" Ron said and grabbed his hand, leading him through the group of students and in the direction of the Hospital wing.
"Draco, you're not supposed to be here." Hermione put herself between the Diary and Draco. Harry was supposed to be looking over him, making sure he didn't do anything. It was a risk keeping Draco so close to the Diary, but as long as someone was watching him, he seemed to be fine. They had a system: Gryffindors would look after Draco during the evenings, and the Ravenclaws (Luna, Anthony and Terry) would look after Draco during classes and at night.
"POTTER KILLED MRS. NORRIS!" He yelled at the top of his lungs, and Hermione, Ron and Harry jumped all at the same time.
It felt like he had been punched in the gut. Was this what the others had felt when he had done the exact same things? He already felt guilty for his past but this...
They walked out of the dusty old classroom, and made their way towards McGonagall's office, Draco had to keep his lips pursed to prevent himself from ranting to them about how bad this idea was, Hermione was a smart person, but this was stupid, did she really think a 60 year old witch like McGonagall would listen to eleven year old children. Perhaps all that praise was going to Hermione's head.
"Shhh!" Harry put a finger to his mouth, he didn't want them to wake up Draco, he already looked really tired, if the dark circles under his eyes were anything to go by.
Hermione gasped again as Draco fell to the floor. She had followed him to his room when he had run away from Harry and Ron; thank Merlin for the invisibility cloak. Draco didn't stay on the floor for long. He slowly got off the floor and walked to the door.
"Check." The Weasley boy breathed out, looking at Harry, Hermione was looking at him as well, Merlin why were they both scared, it wasn't like it sliced him in half.
"Listen! Hasn't he been acting strange ever since he got that concussion, maybe it was a side effect of the potions or something." Harry tried, but he was thinking what they all were thinking 'did he just try to lead us on?'
Harry had stopped reacting to his lectures around 10 minutes ago. And that only infuriated Draco more. He just kept looking at Draco with that stupid dopey smile on his face. Draco didn't even know it was possible to smile that wide in these circumstances. Harry's grin stretched from ear to ear and it was getting hard to keep yelling at him.
"If one of the students tries, I want you to report it to me immediately." Flitwick had taken an authoritave tone of voice, he seemed rather serious about this, and Draco liked it, Flitwick was a nice man, strict, but nice.
The book, it was the book, as soon as he touched it, a feeling flooded through his veins, he didn't know how to describe it, content? Maybe happiness?
"That's why he looks so awful! He fainted and then that... thing took him over. Merlin, what type of friends are we?" Her vision blurred and she sat down on the couch in front of the fireplace.
"She wouldn't believe a bunch of little kids, Hemione." He told her, not focusing on them, he was still confused and shocked about what had happened, he couldn't speak, why couldn't he speak about it? Did he break some sort of Seer rule? There was only one person he could ask about this,
Draco froze. He looked up and sure enough, his father was standing in the doorway. An elf was peeking out from behind him. Dobby.
"Don't forget who actually found the thing!" Ron squawked. Hermione laughed, putting a hand on his shoulder.
"I only have 7 theories as to what happened last year, but it clearly affected your Eye. It's why you're going to get a headache in half an hour. I believe you should be trained in how to make sure your Eye is less exposed to these...hazardous occurrences. As well as expand on your abilities." She said the last part with a mysterious smile on her face.
"But why would he do this? That's not the Draco that we know." Harry said, and Ron looked at him in pity,
Harry had grabbed his arm, and was taking a bit of time to let go, Draco tugged his arm a bit, and he let go immediately, looking apologetic.
"My dear boy, my poor dear boy," she started. Everyone seemingly leaned forward in their chairs, the interaction getting more interesting by the minute.
Cold water was thrown on his face and Draco darted up. He felt horrible. He felt like throwing up but knew he wouldn't be able to even if he wanted to. His head was killing him, and he felt so
But the question had gotten his attention. "What of, Professor?" He asked, genuinely confused and worried at the same time. Had something happened?
"You are welcome to take him back to your dorm until he has recovered." Professor McGonagall told them, a small smile on her face as she looked down at Draco, and Harry and Ron nodded with a smile on their face, they rarely got to take Draco into their house, they normally went into Ravenclaw.
"We should get into the trapdoor-" Ron was opening the trap door, making his way down, but Draco had no interest in staying with the damn beast, he pushed Weasley out of the way and jumped down, he was soon followed by Ron, Harry and Hermione, he tried to move, only to have something wrap around his arm.
Probably because I am absolutely ecstatic to write 2nd-4th year, because there are so many things that I have planned for them, but 4th year's plan might have to be pushed to 5th.
"Ron and Hermione should be a few rows down," he told Harry. They both made their way down to their very back of the train before spotting both of them sitting next to a sleeping man.
"Correct, Mr. Malfoy, 10 points to Sl- Ravenclaw." He noticed that slip up, some of the teachers also did it, they really did expect him to be a Slytherin.
Draco turned to the left, where he saw a transparent person leaning into him. He backed away; once it wasn't directly in his face, he recognized the ghost as Moaning Myrtle. He had forgotten that she haunted this bathroom.
Draco glanced at his teacup and did a double take, blood draining from his face. He knew this would happen, of course it would, it had happened last time after all. But... that didn't change the feeling of ice that pooled in his stomach from seeing Harry's cup.
A snake flew out of Draco's wand. Harry barely had any time to react, and when he did, he was frozen in shock. The snake slithered towards Harry, hissing at the students as he passed them.
That was quite an argument, Narcissa and Lucius had broken into a screaming match right there, Draco had left, not wanting to hear it, all he knew was that it was Potter's fault somehow.
"And to Draco Malfoy, of Ravenclaw house, I award, 50 points, for intellect." Dumbledore winked at him, and Draco's jaw fell open,
The Eagle on the entrance to the Ravenclaw common room came to life as the young Malfoy approached it. The boy waited for it to speak its riddle, they were hardly challenging for someone of his mental capacity. It appeared as if the Eagle also know this, as his questions were always more challenging than the other first years.
Draco rushed in. He could hear Anthony's affronted sounds from behind and Luna's carefree laugh. He set his books on an empty desk and took a quick glance around the room. This was his last class of the day. It wasn't a class he had with the Gryffindors, so that was a shame. But he had his Ravenclaw friends and he was on good terms with the majority of Hufflepuff.
Ron looked in between both of them as though they had gone mad, "You're on my side right, mate?" he asked Draco.
His vision blurred and he fell to the floor, overwhelmed by fear. He coughed again, and the fact that air was leaving him only increased his panic. It felt like someone had their hands on his throat; like they were screaming in his ear and he couldn't do anything. His legs wouldn't cooperate with him.
"I believe that you need to be trained, Draco," Trelawney started as soon as the man went to the back (well not immediately, she had insisted on waiting for 46 seconds.)
"Draco?" A voice called out, and Draco knew who it was before he saw them, Harry. Harry was standing there with Hermione and Ron, he would apologize to them later, once he found out what this was, he needed to get rid of it.
He only stopped when he saw that Harry had stopped breathing so fast and was looking at him, a small smile on his lips and his face red with embarrassment.
It was a short process, the actual healing, once all the potions and spells had been administered, all they needed to do was wait, there was no rushing the waiting process, it was a crucial part of healing.
Was this part of the prophesy, the boy had said a prodigy, he had said many things, Albus had already stored them in his mind, he would write it down later.
And he really did. Harry's face looked much better than it did when they had come in. Instead of the sickly white he had been sporting ever since the train, his tan hue was coming back to his face. His eyes no longer looked dull, returning to the same spark they always did. And his mouth that had looked to be stuck in a permanent frown was smiling softly at Draco.
"Oh yeah, I came up here because Hermione wanted to invite you to Nearly headless Nick's birthday, we all don't wanna go alone."
A silent, awkward period followed as they stared at each other, Weasley was staring at him in surprise, his face had lost a bit of his colour and Granger was looking at him with his mouth open.
"If you do not have the sight, there is very little I will be able to teach you." Draco smiled a bit, remembering how easy and naturally the class had come to him. Back then, he had bragged about how smart he was. But now, he knew it had little to do with studying than natural skill.
instead. You know how much better she is with dealing with these sorts of things." Draco popped in. Now he could distract McGonagall while Terry paid more attention to Sprout. It was perfect!
"No, Mr Granger, actually, we curtsey, the boys normally bow like this-" Draco put his hand over his torso and bowed, "and the girls normally bow like this." Draco put his hands where the normal pureblood lady would hold her gown at her hips and bowed.
Hermione elbowed him and Draco turned to look at her, "And good job with the Devil's Snare, Hermione." He nodded.
He didn't know what they had to do with this, but he knew that those colors represented the founders, there was nothing else that made sense with them, it was a stretch, he knew that, but it felt right, and when something felt right, he didn't ignore it.
But right before she left, she turned back and gave him another smile. "Visit me on Sundays, child. They are the best for your lessons."
"Good, because Weasley is a jealous man. Very jealous," he muttered, mostly to himself. He remembered how Weasley had acted around that boy - his name was Cormac McLaggen? Or something - the glares he had given that boy were even more venomous than the ones he had given Draco himself.
"Mr. Malfoy, I'm sure you know why I called you here," Lupin started off, his usual calm demeanor was replaced with a stance that was both alert and tired at the same time.
"Are you okay?" Harry asked, and Draco lazily tried to hit him in the head once again but missed as he had aimed for the wrong Harry, oh great, he was seeing double.
Their bodies began to... bubble, and their features began to change and morph and warp. Harry's hair began to change, getting shorter and changing to blonde. His skin got lighter, and his eyes changed to blue. His scar was no longer visible. Harry could feel his bones rearranging, it was a horrible feeling. The Gryffindor emblem on his clothes morphed into the Ravenclaw bird.
Potter beamed, "Awesome, thanks, Draco." He tested the name for a bit and then decided that he liked it.
Draco took a seat next to Harry while Ron sat right behind them.  The classroom slowly filled with other students, some who looked disheveled, probably because they were in such a hurry to get to class. All in all, most of the students were late. And the teacher still hadn't shown up. Trelawney knew they would be late, of course. She had likely given herself a few extra minutes of sleep.
And then, things started getting weird. A Bludger came out of nowhere and almost hit Harry, that would have been normal if the Bludger didn't come back, again, and again. Oh, he had forgotten that this happened!
Hermione finally turned to face them. She had bunny ears sticking out of her head, and her nose had become much smaller; whiskers were sprouting out of her cheeks and her whole face was covered in white fur. She looked a tad bit like Luna, blonde hair and silvery eyes, but you could only see it when you got past the fact that she looked like a bunny.
"I still have my own free will, I am human, I am capable of being a different person with different values than Lucius Malfoy, or are you an exact copy of your parents? Have you never done something that your parents dissaproved of, surely they didn't approve of that. Does it not speak for itself that I was sorted into Ravenclaw, or do you want to insult your own house, Davies?"
Everyone, sans Draco, stared at her. He had forgotten she had said that in the last timeline. That raised Draco's hopes a little. Maybe the timeline hadn't been changed too much. Maybe this was another fixed point. And if this one was, then that meant there would be more coming up. He would have to draw a chart comparing them. Anything familiar could be a fixed point, no matter how small it was. Someone falling down the stairs could win a war after all. That was how the universe worked.
"Harry," Ron spoke up, startling Draco from his work. Ron's voice sounded so uncharacteristically serious.
feel the need to run away from home again, you're coming to my house immediately," he said. Harry's eyes widened. Whatever he had been expecting, it hadn't been that.
"Miss Granger, I believe that is something that you will have to find out yourself." Dumbledore smiled.
Once the crowd was gone, he looked at Harry and Ron and hissed at them, "What the absolute hell just happened?" Ron and Harry shrugged, Ron looked at the clock,
Professor Trelawney went on to explain, "This is a flower that is often used amongst older Seers. It is sporadic, and you need much patience to grow it, but if the conditions are just right, it will release a vapor that will heighten the clarity and length of your visions."
Suddenly, ablack dog ran out from the tree and lunged towards the wolf. But Draco's attention latched onto the rat that was scurrying away from the scene. He didn't know why he felt it was so important, but he couldn't look away from it. The blur that was his future self also seemed to notice him.
It was...nothing? But Luna looked terrified. It was odd to see such an emotion on her face. She always looked composed like nothing could scare her, like she was prepared for anything and welcomes surprises. But now, she looked horrified.
"It's just, Dad's always told me about how bad the Malfoy's are, and when I met him, Dad seemed so right, he was a spoiled brat, but, he changed so much, Harry, I don't get it, it has to be some sort of trick."
"It's not attacking you, only me!" The basilisk leapt towards him once more and Harry fell to the floor, scraping his knee. If he wasn't pumped up on adrenaline, then maybe he would have felt it.
She winced at the thought of Draco. Guilt still overwhelmed her. She thought she could hear Draco's voice telling her otherwise: he would say that it wasn't her fault, and then blame himself for whatever had happened. She sighed. She had thought that she knew him, she had thought that she was right when she had stopped being Draco's friend.
," someone sing-songed at the doorway. Draco looked over to see Terry walking in with a big smile on his face.
"I should have known it was your kind that kidnapped my child." Lucius pushed Arthur to the side as he made his way towards Draco.
It was like a beast; an uncontrollable beast. Sometimes it slept peacefully, and other times, completely random times, it woke up and ripped apart everything around it.
They walked to all their classes together now, she realized how wrong she had been about him, everyone had told her that he was a snob and that he would be horrible towards her especially and her 'kind' but they never explained what that meant, but Draco did, he answered all her questions on the wizarding world and even taught her more.
He was happy that he had the oppurtunity to be taught by McGonagall privately, but really, this was getting ridiculous, what was next, Quirell?
Hermione sat ramrod straight, and was immediately sucked through the wall of plants, Draco followed soon after her.
"Yeah, me too, sorry Harry. But I'm sure you and Draco could have fun in the castle." Hermione smiled comfortingly.
Draco quickly turned his thought away. Thinking about last year always made him feel awful. Like he was drowning. Like everything was muffled and far away and the only thing he could think about was that awful diary and how he
"I'm just so tired, Harry." Draco's voice sounded wobbly. He was fighting to keep the tears at bay. He had cried enough; he wouldn't anymore.
The new Ravenclaw got off his stool and made his way to the table, everyone was watching him, as if they expected him to start shouting and throwing a tantrum, but he didn't, instead, he sat down in his seat and politely said hello to the people around him, some even returned his greeting (the previously mentioned muggleborns).
"Every great wizard needs an apprentice. Draco would do great as one, and now that you-" He pointed at Ron who froze, "are here, I don't need to kill him. Your energy would be enough to sustain me. Once he wakes I'll put him under an Imperius, a good little slave." He laughed.
"Come on, we're going to be late!" Draco yelled as Harry and Ron struggled to keep up with them, he didn't know how they had been so late, but they had and he was currently zooming across the train station to get to the entrance, he would be dammed if he didn't get on the train.
"Why? If Harry's talking to Draco, we could talk to him as well. Maybe he's calmed down," she reasoned.
His Sixth year was full of sadness and stress, but he had never felt so mad at someone. It was uncontrollable. Yes, he had almost
"Nott." Harry had packed more venom into that single word than he had ever heard before in his life. Even Nott looked slightly put off by it, but he recovered quickly.
Draco shot Harry one last glare before going to get onto the train. He didn't have to look behind him to know Harry was following closely. He stopped at times when some hero-worshipping first years came up to him, but other than that stayed behind Draco.
"A Dementor is a creature that sucks all the happiness out of you," Draco started. That got Harry's attention because he stopped taking apart his poor bed and looked at Draco. The red slowly fading away from his face as his eyes got a new glint in them. One Draco recognized all too well: curiosity.
He cared. And that thought alone made Draco feel warm inside. It was nice to have someone that he could call a father figure. This time, he wouldn't have to live up to anyone's expectations. Severus cared about Draco for Draco.
"I mean, I disagree on that, why would seven be such an important number in Arithmancy?" Tom was going on about the number seven and how magical it was, Draco was interested.
His friends were acting weird. Anthony, Terry, and Luna were all giving each other small glances. They were brief but Draco felt like he was missing something. Something important.
"You're stepping on my foot," Ron complained as they crept through the hallway. It was nighttime and they had just left the common room. The cloak really was not made for two people. Harry had barely managed to fit them both under it.
"Although I can't guarantee word won't get out. I'm sure you know how gossipy Ravenclaws can be." Lupin tried to smile, but it came off strained.
"Yeah, I think I might be coming down with-" Draco got cut off by another coughing fit. He put his mouth in the crook of his elbow.
"Make sure he drinks these, and he gets lots of rest, I am putting you in charge of his health, if anything happens to him, you will be held accountable!" Snape held a finger in front of them.
"I have to go tend to my other patients now, and don't bombard him with questions when he wakes up, alright, Albus?" Poppy warned, causing Albus to chuckle, he wouldn't dare do that to the boy.
"Are you crazy?" Ron yelled at her. But Hermione was right, there was no way to get out of here, even a full-grown wizard wouldn't be able to get through this with their wand, the only reasonable thing to do was stay still.
"Draco, we need your help, we think Snape's gonna steal something from the third floor." Harry whispered.
"O-Oh, Hi Harry." Draco stuttered as he flushed the toilet, it made a horrible screeching noise as it went down, was it too much for it to be quiet?
Draco watched as Weaselbee tugged Potter away, why did Potter help him, oh if only the other Potter could see this, he would drop dead on the spot.
He was called into Flitwick's office, he knew what it was about, he gulped as he sat down at the desk of a very disappointed looking Flitwick.
"I knew we shouldn't have trusted Malfoy, his dad probably put him up to this!" Ron went on a tangent, his face getting redder by the second. Harry stopped him,
"Stop struggling!" Hermione yelled at all of them, even though Draco was moving the least out of all of them.
Perhaps she should have eased it onto her, Poppy's jaw dropped to the floor this time, and she wansn't closing it, she was truly and utterly shocked, Minerva couldn't blame her, she felt quite the same way.
"Dumbledore has told me that you've been presenting as a Male Veela." He didn't even try to keep the excitement out of his voice.
Suddenly, the whole animosity between Potter and Malfoy made sense. But he wasn't that person anymore. And neither was Harry. In a way, Malfoy was a different person. As well as Potter. It was no longer Potter and Malfoy, instead, it was
sorry for how long this took! My new niece (born on May 31st) has just fallen into my care and she got sick. I've been dealing with her. I didn't mean to be absent for so long. Hopefully, I'll be back more often now!
Draco glanced down at the cup, instantly recognizing his leaves as an Acorn and a Club. When put together, they told of an unexpected attack in the near future. The problem was that the 'near future' was always a bit obscure in Divination. That was the problem with the whole subject; it was obscure in almost every aspect. The 'near future' could be tomorrow or a year later. Technically, it was always the near future for someone; they all had their points in time and Tessomancy almost always told of a fixed point in time. But you could never know what was a fixed point in time.
"Mr. Malfoy, so you have decided to grace us with your presence." McGongall said as Draco entered her classroom late.
The basilisk slithered close once more preparing to leap towards him. Harry closed his eyes and prepared himself.
The twinkle in Dumbledore's eyes practically blinded him. "The bonds between family are great, Draco. Even when they are not bound by blood." His eyes grew distant, as if reliving something, and, for once, Draco found himself wondering about Dumbledore's past.
As for Draco, he looked like a fish, opening and closing his mouth, thoughts and emotions reeled through his head, but two things stuck out,
"I was looking, and you know Myrtle's bathroom. There's a sink there with a snake on it. Myrtle died in that bathroom and she heard hissing before she died. Parseltongue." Hermione puffed up triumphantly, she was proud of herself.
by his first name? Calling Granger anything but Granger was a struggle for him, but Potter? He looked back at him and saw him giving Draco one of his looks, he looked like he would cry if Draco refused, and Draco wasn't a
"Well, it's your time to shine, Mister youngest seeker in a century." Draco gestured to the broom. Harry turned scarlet in embarrassment, looking at the broom and then looking at the keys,
That was one favour done for a Ravenclaw, only a few more to go, little by little, he would make his housemates like him.
They crept over to the office. The door was just slightly open, just enough for them to creep through.
Draco looked back at the teams, the Gryffindors were looking at him in shock, while the Slytherins were looking at him in pride, especially Nott.
"Is the image really that bad?" Potter looked down, Draco didn't know what Potter had said, or why whatever Potter had seen in the mirror would cause a reaction like this from Draco, but he didn't care, Potter had asked him a question, and Draco wanted to answer.
It scared him because maybe Lucius Malfoy also made it back, he may have only been part Veela, but he had handled the family magic much longer than him, he was more skilled with that type of magic.
Now, there was the matter of dealing with Pettigrew. The damn rat was nowhere to be seen. He had asked Ron about it, but that had only led to an argument between him and Hermione. Harry had been the one to explain to him what happened. Apparently, Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers and he was still nowhere to be found. That was another difference. He specifically remembered Weasley having the damn rat in the old timeline. But, for some reason, Pettigrew had disappeared. A small difference at first glance, but when Draco was turning the situation over in his head, he had almost had a panic attack.
"Yes, your Eye has been taking quite a beating lately." On instinct, Draco's hand shot up to his literal eye before he realized she was referring to his Inner Eye.
Draco and Anthony were quietly talking (well, Anthony was talking.) Draco wasn't really paying attention to him, the other boy never had anything of value to say anyways.
Harry's head snapped up and he looked distinctly green. "No! No, of course not!" He yelled, probably louder than necessary.
"Yes." Draco didn't have to think, he would finally figure out what had happened during first year and why Potter had gotten so many house points, it clearly had something to do with Quirell, but he didn't know what, he didn't know what the man was hiding, just that he wasn't who he seemed to be.
"Yeah, I'm fine, what did you want to show me?" Draco shook his head a bit, trying to shake the thoughts out of his mind, he always was an active thinker, a bit too active if you asked him.
That took him by surprise. Severus had gotten the ingredients for the potion immediately in the last timeline. Maybe he already knew? Severus always was perceptive.
Draco rushed back into Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. He needed Tom back. It had been another month since he had gotten rid of the Diary, and the need just seemed to flourish over that time. He ran to the stall where he had flushed the Diary. It wasn't there (of course it wasn't.)
Speaking of Potter, one of the younger Ravenclaws had let him into the common room when they found him puzzling over the answer to one of the Eagle's riddles.
"You, boy!" she said suddenly, hand pointing towards Neville, who cowered beneath her gaze. Just then, a flash of Neville dropping a teacup appeared in his vision, hazy and far away. As though blocked by a cloud of invisible mist.
He ran to her room only to find her waiting for him, "Mister Malfoy, I have been expecting you." She spoke in her whispy voice.
"I am." Harry nodded seriously, a fire in his eyes. Hermione and Ron often told him - and on some occasions Draco, but it was almost always said as an insult - that he was extremely determined.
"Remember that day we found Draco in the bathroom? When he was flushing something down the toilet?" Hermione looked Ron in the eye.
"That didn't go well," Harry muttered under his breath. Harry rubbed the back of his neck, looked at Dumbledore, looked at them, and then muttered a quiet, "I'm just gonna go find Draco." He left the room.
"He said that he had a Master, I just didn't know that it was you." Harry tilted his head, looking oddly thoughtful.
"Sorry." He rubbed the back of his neck, feeling blood start to rush to his cheeks. Merlin, he hated humiliation, it was the worst type of torture imaginable.
"Now, I understand that this may be scary for some of you, but we will be facing the boggarts today. Remember class, the incantation to get rid of a boggart is
I'm sorry I haven't been here for a bit but I actually have an excuse this time! My computer broke. Haha, good thing I already had a bit of this chapter written, huh?
She only just caught Draco leaving. She left the common room and tailed Draco as he walked down the hallway. She didn't know where he was going. He turned multiple times, but he didn't look lost, walking with purpose confidently. He held his chin up high and the eerie grin never left his face.
"I don't know. Why would a Grim be in a muggle neighborhood?" he said, trying his best to make himself believe it as well. Hermione shot him an appraising look, their previous argument forgotten.
He used his wit to answer people, he was good at manipulating people, sure, that could be a bad trait, but he didn't abuse it, and that was what mattered, intent, not opportunity.
Maybe Draco was dead? The thought turned his blood cold. Draco was his best friend. Even more so than Ron. Ron had Hermione and Harry had Draco. Sure; Hermione and Draco liked to poke fun at Harry and Ron. But in the end, Harry and Draco were always best friends. If Draco was dead, then Harry would never be able to tell Draco how he felt about him. How he saw them as more then friends.
Draco scrunched up his face, he looked like he was in pain, he held his hair with one of his hands, grunting in pain, "Draco?" Harry said, he was worried and didn't care what Ron or Hermione said to him anymore.
That was when everyone pointedly looked at Harry, expressions mixed in the room. Professor McGonagall, seemingly catching on, scoffed again.
"Hermione!" Ron yelled at the same time as Harry yelled, "Draco!", were those dunces even listening to them, Hermione had said stay still and yet they were struggling like fishes out of water.
"I don't recall seeing Mr Potter at the feast today, I know that Mr Malfoy was in his dorm, so he is telling the truth, Mr Potter, the question is-" Snape loomed over him, "- are
"You know what? I'm sick of this, you all judge him because of his family, just like his family judge's yours! You're a hypocrite, Ronald Weasley!" His jaw dropped open, and so did hers.
Many sessions with Flitwick had him quickly rising above his peers in charms, he had turn down all the other teachers offers to tutor him, while he did want to take it, he knew that if he did, he would be being too much of a prodigy, and he didn't want to attract too much attention to himself.
Draco supposed that made sense, he would have to look into that, Tom always gave him the most interesting things to think about. Draco yawned, suddenly sleepy.
It didn't take long for his mind to come up with an answer, he didn't even have time to finish his sentence before he knew exactly what this was,
"You'll forgive me for saying so, my dear," Trelawney started and Draco cringed, knowing what was about to happen and how Hermione would react to it.
"No, you said it yourself, Ron, Draco's smarter than Hermione!" That caught Hermione's attention, as she stopped what she was doing and faced Ron.
I am sorry for not updating recently, I've kinda been down these past couple days and have been reading up on a few Drarry fics, guess who just found a 3 million words slow burn canon rewrite?
, but swung open nonetheless, he wondered if the Eagle felt accomplished if it spoke a riddle that a person couldn't figure out, was that its purpose?
"That is none of your business, Mr Potter, now, what have you done to him!" Snape was red in the face and Harry and Ron baulked at how bare the emotion was on his face, Snape wasn't just angry, he was furious.
Hello, yet again to my lovely readers! I can not tell you how excited I am to write fourth year, but there are a few things that I am
The time travel had messed it up so much that the eye had taken two months to adjust, not to mention the fact that it had to adjust to an 11 year old with the power of a 22 year old Veela.
Ron's fork fell. Draco's book did the exact same. They both gave each other a look, for once agreeing on something: concern for their friend.
Draco's eyes widened. His Eye had 'taken a beating?' What had happened? Did the Diary affect it in any way?
"Your next class is Defence right?" Anthony asked quietly. Unlike the other tables, Ravenclaw was always somewhat subdued. And that was how everyone in the House liked it. Sure, there was chattering here and there, but there was always a good chunk of people who wanted nothing to do with conversation and only wanted to pay attention to their homework or something of the sort.
"Yeah, you know, the attack on Mrs Norris!" Luna said in her airy voice, and Draco's face drained of colour. There had been an attack on Mrs Norris
Another gasp, this time, not his, it was Harry's, the figure spun around, just noticing them. It ignored Draco, instead, it got up and made its way towards Harry.
"Harry!" A familiar voice yelled. Harry pulled away so fast that he bumped his head into the headboard. Draco looked over at said voice and saw Seamus Finnigan coming in with a paper.
"No one is saying that he will, he does have power however, a power that Lucius Malfoy can not know if he doesn't know already."
"Harry James Potter, you get your things and get in this thing right now." Draco hissed, poking his head out of the door.
"Take my hand and stop looking down, you dolt!" Draco's eyes were crossing, he most likely had a concussion but he still managed to insult Harry.
Draco stumbled as he pushed off of Harry and spoke, "I think the death tree did more damage..to.." Draco couldn't finish his sentence as his eyes rolled to the back of his head and the world went black.
When they didn't get an answer, Harry opened the stall door only to find Hermione facing the wall, crying silently.
But who would be courting him? He hadn't noticed anyone... but he hadn't really paid attention much, had he. Too caught up in his work to even think about things like love.
"Draco." Snape said in his stern voice, Draco looked over at the man to find him looking at Draco like he didn't know who he was.
Harry put a finger to his mouth and rapidly shushed him, looking around to make sure no one heard. Draco couldn't believe it. Did Lucius have a killing kids fetish he didn't have in the original timeline or something? This man was more fucked up than the woman who fucked whatever snake to birth Voldemort.
Tom raised an eyebrow in amusement. "Well, well, well, Potter knows my name," he said, walking over to him.
"I don't know what to do, Hermione!" Harry whisper yelled at Hermione in the carriage, making sure Draco couldn't hear them. He was one carriage away, but still.
But now Draco had a question, if he didn't travel back, if he had stayed in the Manor while everyone was dying, while the Death Eaters were killing everyone one by one, when they had finally killed professor Snape, if he had stayed, would he still have had the vision, the prophesy.
Draco screamed, Ron screamed, Harry screamed, everybody screamed. Ron spun the wheel the other way and they tumbled out of the train's path, spinning and twisting all the way down.
. Potter, that bastard had this cloak since first year,  that was how he had never gotten in trouble.
"Hmm, Mr.Malfoy, can you tell me what happened?" Snape turned around to face Malfoy, who was purposely avoiding eye contact.
Did this person give him a blue flower just because he was a Ravenclaw? No, they wouldn't put this much work into making it look nice and then make such an obvious move.
- the name Firenze flashed in his head, a small vision, his name must be Firenze, Firenze started walking over to Draco, fascination in his eyes.
She continued with her lesson, not asking questions again, it wasn't like this lesson was hard, they weren't even learning any new spells, she was just talking, all they really needed to do was open a textbook. Although he supposed it wasn't a well known art, the Animagus.
The car shot them out as well as their things, and Draco wanted nothing more than to just fall asleep on the grass, the tree had hit in the back of his already pounding head and he knew that he most definitely had a concussion.
He closed his eyes, ready to go to sleep when Fawkes screeched once more. Fawkes swooped down onto Harry's arm and his eyes started to tear up.
"Myrtle! You didn't happen to see a... a book, did you?" Draco was acutely aware of how desperate his voice sounded.
"Draco, please, we can't be too late," Harry muttered to himself as he held Draco's body. He felt cold, so,
"No really, tell me, how does a death eater's son get into Ravenclaw, shouldn't you be in Slytherin?" An older Ravenclaw taunted.
Harry put his arms around Draco and rested his head on Draco's hair which was tied up in a ponytail, it was
Dobby squeaked and left. Harry made to follow him but was stopped when Draco grabbed his arm. Harry faced Draco, confusion lining his face.
"Strawberry Yeti," he said before the Gargoyle even tried to ask. The staircase was revealed and Draco bolted up the steps. He didn't want to think Dumbledore had actually Obliviated Severus, but what else was there to think?
Draco wasn't backing down either. "Meditate!" he yelled, "Open your Inner Eye. Ask Professor Trelawney! You're treating her like a
Potter and Weasley both looked like they didn't understand, the truth was that he had arrived here at the worst time, right when his name was called to be sorted. But he supposed he could bullshit his way through this conversation.
are unable to change them, people do not need to know for you to help them, but keep in mind, if you did not speak it out loud, then they are not meant to know."
"And he hit his head when we were spinning around in the car when you fell out, remember?" Ron added, and Snape lost some colour in his already pale face.
Harry didn't try to break out of Draco's grasp, which Draco thought was strange, but he was too focused on getting him out of here, this place screamed danger.
"Both of yeh should be careful, Knockturn Alley's full of dark wizards and witches," Hagrid told them and Draco scoffed, like he didn't know that. Hagrid stopped and turned to face him,
"Fine, let's tell McGonagall." Draco would love to see how this would turn out, if they weren't going to listen to him, he wasn't going to suggest his brilliant ideas anymore, that would teach them.
"How do you know?" He wasn't referring to how he knew about the art of Occlumency, Severus had taught him about the art himself, he was asking how he knew that he wanted to look inside his mind.
"Speaking of," Luna chimed in, finally looking up from her copy of the Quibbler, "Hogsmeade weekend is coming up soon. Would you like to go with us, Draco?" She took a sip of her pumpkin juice before staring at something above Harry's head. Probably more of those Lovey Doveys she had been talking about.
Luna opened her mouth to say something else but stopped suddenly, inclining her head and muttering to herself. Was it to herself? He couldn't tell. She looked up again, a slightly apologetic look on her face this time.
Draco hadn't known that, his Allure had only shown itself in his sixth year, and that had been quite an... experience. Many people had tried, but Draco had managed to get away, he didn't know that people were able to fight it, perverts.
"Stop moving!" Hermione yelled again, when Draco remembered, that he was, in fact, a wizard, who knew how to do spells.
"Who's that?" he asked, trying to keep his voice steady. It wasn't easy and he was pretty sure he failed.
"Did you Obliviate Severus?" Draco asked in a tone he knew was overly harsh. But to him, it was justified.
house Severus, and Flitwick has already agreed to take away 20 points from Ravenclaw for Mr Malfoy's part in this." Snape's eyes darkened, but knowing that this was a battle that he would not win, he reluctantly nodded.
Draco yawned. He wanted to fall asleep but he couldn't seem to with Hermione's constant chattering in the background. Not to mention the fact that every time he closed his eyes Hermione would hit him with a book, and they were
"Listen Draco," he started, in a voice that startled Draco. Terry actually sounded serious for once. "I know that you've been dealing with some pretty bad stuff lately. Last year took its toll on you, but... I can tell there's something else that's been bothering you. If you can't tell me, then I want you to tell someone else. I don't care about knowing your secrets. I just want you to feel better because you're my friend, and I care about you."
"You're wrong! Dumbledore's the greatest sorcerer, you left Hogwarts because you feared him!" Harry yelled and Tom's eyes narrowed.
Draco waited until he saw that Seamus was gone. When he was, he closed the door to the room and immediately launched himself towards Hermione's corner, tearing her pillows apart, pulling out drawers, looking in her cupboard and ripping her curtains.
Tom ignored him. "How is it that a baby with absolutely no magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort?" His voice had lost its amused tint and was now filled with rage as well as dark curiosity.
knew where the Divination classroom was, but they didn't know that. After all, it would look odd if he knew where the classroom of a subject that the rest didn't even know existed was. Well, they had never heard of the subject until about a day ago, when they first got their schedules.
"Mr. Malfoy! How have you preformed the spell non-verbally?" Flitwick ran over to him and looked him in the eye, a look of excitement in his eyes.
That was it! He could blame it on Lucius, Hermione wouldn't question him about that, and neither would Harry or Weasley. He looked away and pursed his lips together, practically confirming what Harry had just said.
"You failed us. You can't deny who you really are--" The voice (the high pitched, small voice) spoke in such a cold and dead manner, not even hateful for the things he had done. It was like all the life was gone from them and
"Of course, mate." Draco nodded and Ron smiled, Draco didn't know if it was because he was glad that he heard him or if it was because he was coming to practice. He wanted to see Harry fly anyways, he liked quidditch, maybe he would try out this year.
He didn't stop to think, he ran to the entrance to the Gryffindor common room and knocked on the door.
Harry cringed, but suddenly he came up with an idea. He pulled out his invisibility cloak (he had taken to bringing it with him wherever he went).
"A Veela? But that's not possible, Veela's are more commonly seen in females, and even then they're rare, most Veela's today only have 1/4 of the gene-" McGonagall lifted up her hand with a slightly impressed look on her face, maybe Draco shouldn't had spat out that bit of knowledge, but he couldn't help himself.
"Yeah." Harry huffed, looking put off for some reason as he kicked a pebble that had been on the ground.
"What worked, Professor?" he asked absentmindedly, his mind still on that... daydream? No, it was obviously a vision. But they had never been so clear before, or so long. They were normally hazy little flashes or odd signs here and there. At first, he wasn't even able to tell the difference between this 'vision' and reality. If these things were going to continue he would have to figure out a way to tell the difference between the two--
"I'm not an idiot, Godfather, yelling at him would've given him more ammunition, like I'd want that, being smart with him shut him up."
"It's...changed Draco somehow, he's different; like someone else is controlling him." Hermione narrowed her eyes when Ron scoffed.
But... the thought of being able to fly again. The exhilaration that always came with a good Quidditch match, and this time, his father wouldn't even be the reason he was doing it. It would be his own. Maybe allowing himself this little break wouldn't be so bad. Harry was asking him, after all, and how was he meant to say no when those eyes looked at him so hopefully?
He turned around and made his way towards McGongall's desk, he could tell that she was analyzing him, for what, he didn't know.
Potter dragged Draco across the castle, it was weird, they had walked past Flich without him even noticing they were there, Potter even did a few childish faces, moking the man.
"No, you idiot." Draco's voice sounded watery, and he sniffed in the middle of the short sentence, but he was feeling better, Potter was distracting him, keeping Draco from looking in the mirror again, keeping Draco from letting his emotions out, because Draco knew, if he let them out now, he wouldn't be able to bring them back in.
Inside the stall, Ron's hair darkened from its normal fiery red to a light brown, his freckles disappeared but his eye colour stayed the same.
He had about 10 minutes before he had to be in his next class, he had left early on purpose, wanting to talk to Tom.
"Not that it matters, but that's the first time my transformation's not got applause from a class," she humphed. It very clearly mattered.
Draco helped Harry get up and faltered a bit when he saw how Harry was glaring at him, he opened his mouth, ready to say something, but Draco shushed him, fighting fire with fire would do no one any good.
worried about Draco. Professor McGonagall had completely ignored him when he had asked about him, but she had heard him. The only reason she would do that was if something was really wrong.
"The what?" said Harry, looking between Draco and Trelawney with an expression that was both confused and worried.
Draco quickly launched into a lecture. And his thoughts were turned away from what he had been thinking about.
"Catch the key!" Harry threw the key over at Draco, who caught it without much thought. He ran over to the door and shoved it into the keyhole, twisting it. Once the door opened, Harry zoomed right into it, as did everyone else once they saw that the keys were following him.
"Look!" Potter took off the cloak and grabbed Draco's arm harder, pushing him towards what looked like a mirror.
"But we'll have class tomorrow, right?" Terry asked, a hopeful smile on his face. But there was a sad undertone to it. He knew as well as Draco that they wouldn't. And he wasn't even a Seer. Or from the future.
He reached out to take it from him but Ron threw the book towards Harry. It landed right in front of him. Harry glanced at the basilisk. Something Hermione had said flashed back into his head.
"And then we'll be able to bring Harry back to the Gryffindor common room without anyone noticing he left," Draco finished.
But it was working, he had already apologized to Potter and Weasley, Potter had taken it well, Weasley, not so much.
Draco held his breath as he walked into the office once again, almost two months after he had fainted inside of it, that thought brought another one into Draco's mind, he had stayed at the castle during Winter break, the first time he had ever done so.
Wait, what had they been talking about again? Oh yes, Harry had become seeker, he should probably be happy for him.
"Male Veela's are not uncommon, Mr. Malfoy, especially in families as old as your's." The others nodded along with her.
But it wasn't any of them. Instead, it was Professor Trelawney. Damn. He should've known from how airy and eccentric the voice sounded. He always wondered why her voice was like that; it couldn't have been because she was a Seer. Draco was a Seer and he sure as hell didn't talk like that.
Hermione looked at him, ready to say something, but before she could, Ron said something. "I know, there's something super wrong with Draco..." He still looked guilty and kept his gaze on the floor.
Ron and Harry hesitated for a moment before drinking the potion, while Hermione drank it right away. It took a moment, but eventually, their bodies started changing. It was a weird feeling, and it looked even weirder in the mirror.
"Well, I will be leaving." Dumbledore looked at Flitwick and they both left the room, leaving Draco alone with his friends. He looked over at Ron,
The young girl started reading from her textbook, tears slowly started to fall on the paper, causing her to wipe her face again.
They both walked over to the small shop that sold mostly books and trinkets. It was clearly a small business that was run by someone with no ambition. His thoughts were only solidified when he saw the man who ran the place. He looked defeated and looked like he couldn't care less what they were doing, only rattling off something that was clearly rehearsed in the most monotone voice possible.
"He feels guilty?" He asked, a doubtful look on his face. It spoke volumes of Lucius' character that a twelve-year-old boy who had only met him twice could see through his mask.
They started walking down the hallway, getting a few looks along the way, but Draco was used to it, Potter must have been as well, but he looked rather shy, he must not like the attention, as for Weasley, he didn't even seem to notice it.
Lucius was distracted momentarily, "Grades?" He asked, Draco was also interested, he hadn't bothered looking at them this year, schoolwork wasn't exactly at the top of his mind.
"Don't be a smartarse with me Draco," Lucius told him, and Draco didn't know what to say, what did Lucius want him to say, that he was sorry for being himself?
Knowing that he was the reason Flitwick was this happy brought a small smile to his face -he had a heart- which turned into a full blown one when he heard what the man said,
The dread was still there, but it was bearable, he looked over at Harry and saw him clutching his scar, his eyes wide, something was wrong, something about that
Now, he needed to analyze the prophesy itself, he knew the cause of it, but what did it mean. Draco doubted he would find much information on it though, hidden meanings, yes, he could find those, but they would take almost all of his time. Prophecies always were the one thing that bugged him.
"Harry Potter." Arthur's eyes lit up, but before he said anything to Harry, he turned to Draco, still waiting for him to answer,
"Meet me after class today." Flitwick comanded, and then he went back to teaching his class, but Draco still caught him looking at him in fascination.
She looked around pointedly. "I think that we should talk about this in private. Unless you want a man with a purple hat finding out your secret in 7 minutes." She said the last part in a daze.
Ron stopped for a moment before saying the two words that summed up how they were both feeling. "Bloody hell."
"It's just...you think he's okay?" Anthony asked again as they waited in the hallway right outside of Transfiguration.
Not to say Hermione couldn't be jealous as well. Case in point, relationship with Lavender Brown. Sixth year had been a mess of feelings for those two, hadn't it? Not to say it hadn't been for Draco as well.
"Why, I can assure you that I have dealt with these kinds of things before. Come, let's talk to Professor Snape. I'm sure he has a potion for these kinds of things."
The Ravenclaws knew about Draco's predicament. Hermione had told them. There was no point in keeping secrets from them.
"I have no idea." Harry had theories, but he doubted any of them would be true. Draco was clearly looking for something. Maybe he had found it; maybe he hadn’t.
Draco groaned and slammed his face into the grass, mentally preparing himself for the trauma he was about to grow through being in a car with three Weasley's, two who looked exactly like each other.
Harry didn't hesitate, he dove for the key, and was barely keeping up with it, finally, he caught it, but that wasn't the end, he had to use it now. The swarm was still following him but he made his way over to them,
Just a little note; these chapters are not Beta'd. I've started correcting them, but that'll take a while, so sorry.
Draco's head collided with the top of the car and he saw stars, he only briefly caught a glimpse of Harry opening his door,
When he looked back at the flower, he saw a whole array of different colors. Red, yellow, and blue vapors now swirled around alongside the green. Now he knew what Professor Trelawney meant.
"I was at the library getting textbooks for your class, Sir, when I was going back to my dormroom, Davies saw me and started taunting me, he threatned me with his wand before Potter came."
She burst into the Headmaster's office and yelled, "Headmaster you can't expel Draco! It wasn't his fault! I can vouch for him--"
Hermione snatched the book out of his hands, immediately spotting a flaw in the theory. "It says that the Basilisk will
Hermione have him a look that clearly said 'we'll speak later.' Harry gave him a smile and a thumbs up, Weasley just waved goodbye (an improvement from when he just pretended that Draco didn't exist), it was good to know that he was getting over their family's blood feud.
"Mr. Malfoy, I can already tell that your hair is growing in quite fast." Draco knew that his hair was growing at a faster rate than any non-veela's would, but that was to be expected, it normally stopped growing at about mid-length.
- acquaintances. Merlin, he had almost referred to them as his friends, but, weren't they his friends, they fit all meanings of the word, but they couldn't be, they were the golden trio, not the golden quartet, but-
Draco faltered for a moment, knowing his entire existence was a lie. The guilt was resurfacing, and he knew that he would have to tell them soon. But he would have to make sure it was safe to tell them. They were only children right now. They wouldn't understand, not for a while at least. Potter, Granger and Weasley may be extraordinary kids, but that was what they were. Kids.
Dumbledore popped a lemon drop into his mouth. "I was against it, of course, but he kept on insisting and eventually said that if I didn't do it he would do it himself. I didn't want him to get hurt and so I agreed."
"My favorite student!" Flitwick squeaked, making sure no one overheard him, he didn't want to hurt any other Ravenclaw's feelings, but he couldn't help it, Mr. Malfoy
Forming a friendship with at least one of the Weasley's was absolutely necessary, to break Potter out of his bedroom in second year, if Ronald didn't work out, then he would try the twins, he could tell he was already growing on them.
to be, as opposed to the Wizards normal. Harry looked at him in confusion and fear, he didn't understand, and frankly, Draco didn't understand either.
She dropped the hair into the green sludge that was the Polyjuice potion. They had agreed that she would drink the one with Luna's hair, Ron would drink Terry's, and Harry would drink Anthony's.
. Despite the circumstances, she was angry at how amused he sounded; like he was toying with her. So what if he was more magically advanced than her. This person was a conceited git, that was clear.
There was an ancient language on the top of it, Draco recognized it, and his brain automatically changed it into english, The Mirror of Erised. Potter was still looking at him, all giddy, a huge smile on his face, practically jumping up and down. Draco looked in the mirror.
"Sure." He smiled at her and they started walking, Draco put the diary in his bag and ignored the urge to write in it, he would have plenty of time during his free period.
The basilisk recovered quickly and Fawkes flew over away, dropping something while leaving. Well, Harry didn't know if Fawkes left; he was a bit focused on the snake.
"What did you see?" Draco stopped for a moment, should he tell Potter, of course he couldn't tell Potter the whole thing, that would raise more questions that he couldn't answer.
He made his way down a flight of stairs to find the Weasley's at a table eating breakfast, Harry was right behind him as he sat down next to Ron and Harry sat down next to him.
"Professor Flitwick kept him after class, he did a non-verbal spell his first try!" Patil said with the same childish excitement.
He was more irritated by the former than the latter. But the trio had noticed his discomfort. It was oddly endearing how they shot him sympathetic looks every time he winced and held his head. Harry especially, was fussing over him.
, the Draco in the mirror wasn't surpressing his Veela, that was why everything about him looked perfect.
"I mean really, you look like you just came out of a Quidditch match." The mention of Quidditch made Harry perk up. But it was for a different reason than Draco thought.
"Yes, like Draco," Anthony agreed as they both walked along the old abandoned tunnel. It should spit them out at the back of the castle and then all they needed to do was use the Portkey Draco had gotten for them. If everything went according to plan Harry would have an hour or two of freedom.
