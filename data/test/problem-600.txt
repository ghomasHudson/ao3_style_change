ing him from within. But Potter’s hand clamped down around his wrist, grinding the bones, and he surged out of his chair before Draco could yank away, their mouths still touching, so Draco distantly supposed Potter was mad or possessed, too. Because Potter was
“By more than—”
, an eighteenth century booklet of love poems and spells, it contains the title, author, and date of publication on one side, and Ron’s message on the other, just under a series of letters that look like runes — though none she recognises — in his handwriting. Splattered over his shaky lettering is blood, now long-dried, and long-since confirmed to be his.
“Wastefully?” Harry arched an eyebrow, pleased when Draco rolled his eyes and looked away. He pressed his head to the side of the mattress and contemplated the ceiling, the small changes there he hadn’t noticed before — a new lack of watermarks, a brighter finish to the crown mouldings. “I don’t know. I just assumed there’d be time to work out what I wanted to do. I knew it wasn’t what I’d thought back at Hogwarts.”
need the ache to stop. You let yourself sag into a pair of arms, feel the press of a cock to your backside. Whoever is holding you mumbles frantically in your ear and hikes your robes up, tearing at your flies. You don't want him, you
in and—” Turning the corner, he came to a hard stop, his cutoff sentence continuing without sound:
Neville cleared his throat and raked his fingers through the ruffle of his wheat-gold hair. “McSweeney. She’s only been playing one season and a lot of the press on her says she won’t have a shot against Day from the Wasps, but I saw her fly last year, and the only other person I’ve ever seen fly so fast,” he lifted his chin and raised a pointed eyebrow, “is Harry.”
Harry brushes it off. “And you’re not helpless.”
“Please,” Malfoy blurts, twisting his wrists. His fingers twitch, stretching. “Please, can't I just—?”
The furniture’s always at fault when Draco’s had too much to drink, something that used to annoy Harry but he now finds annoyingly charming, like how Draco occasionally drops his clothing in a trail, a drunken map of his jaunts around their flat for Harry to decipher. Harry has just enough time to think,
“Master Harry was not meaning his abandonment of Kreacher, Kreacher is being very old and was being willing to die with no one to take care of and nothings to do, for his good and kind Master,” Kreacher said guilelessly. He glanced over his shoulder, the droop of heavy wrinkles on his forehead multiplying momentarily.
“Yes.” In a fitting twist, physical contact between them before the addendum came into effect would nullify their signatures.
“I like socks,” Potter said. Probably because he thought wearing them was a good replacement for washing his feet.
could be cruel, the question was how Harry could so easily turn traitor to everything he’d lived and died for.
Potter, which was why he hadn’t let himself think about it much. And that had been going on since...  When had Potter escaped the dragon again? Fourth year.
Harry looked up from the hypnotic leap of the fire. Malfoy stared at him from his position on the sofa, one arm stretched over the back of it, one leg draped over the other. Harry wondered why he’d come back; he vaguely remembered Malfoy saying he was going to take a shower and go to bed. “When did you come in?”
“I’ll be in the library today if you need me for any—” He closed his mouth, noticing Draco’s casual choice of clothing in a new way. He’d eschewed robes for visitors for the first time, and the laces on his shirt were spread and messy, the elegant hollow of his clavicle on display — so Blaise could see it, so Theo could.
“Is it just fear?” Harry’d asked, and Draco had shaken his head, though he didn’t lie and say he felt none. Harry shook his head back. “Then we’ll avoid it. A feeling’s a feeling; sometimes you have to trust them.”
Malfoy comes down onto his knees and shrugs both of the bags from his back. Harry blinks; he’d somehow forgotten that Malfoy was carrying them. He waits for Malfoy to open the flap of his bag but Malfoy merely takes a brief glance around and reaches for Harry’s arm again.
“Because I’m speaking to Harry again in ten days,” she says flatly. “If your mental stimulation hasn’t jarred anything loose by that point, I doubt I’ll be able to find any more justification to allow you sanctuary within Hogwarts. Our resources are stretched thin enough as it is; I’d rather not waste them on someone I can’t trust if I don’t have to.”
The castle is quiet, supervised quarantine in effect. All of the children are accounted for, watched by either designated elves or professors to stop any errant and accidental magic that might disrupt the flow. Hermione opens the doors and reads herself the riot act as she heads for the Healing ward — thus far, all of their interactions have ended poorly: Narcissa silent and smug, Hermione frustrated and just as clueless. She knows she shouldn’t be surprised but, for the love of Merlin, she can’t figure out Narcissa’s angle. She can’t figure out why Narcissa refuses to cooperate, when her own son is in such danger.
“I opened a door in the refrigerated section,” Harry says. “Most everything left in it has gone off.”
Ron turned to Bill again as Harry stared into the fire. “Isn’t there any sort of loophole? It’s a thousand-year-old piece of parchment that’s been sitting in a vault for nearly half that time!”
been a dwindling thing.
“Yes, of course. Take whatever free space we have that works,” Hermione says. She stops by the door, chewing on her lower lip for a second and glances down the corridor to make sure it’s empty, but blinks when she glances back up at Neville, overcome by the disjointed realisation that he and Ron are the same height. Taking a small step back, she pretends she doesn’t see the worried pinch between his brows.
“Well, don't be. Get out of your head about it.” Malfoy smacks his arse lightly, as though it’s Saturday and they’ve just finished a round of pickup Quidditch on the Ministry pitch.
A meagre explanation of everything he's feeling and can't describe, hope and fear and pain, left unfinished because he doesn't know how it ends — or what might happen if he says it out loud.
Minerva clucks her tongue, the harsh lines of tension around her eyes fading. “Everyone is in good health. I’ve had to warn some seventh years once more from leaving the wards, the same group of—”
Delicately, Hermione said, “Whether that’s all true, I’m not sure how any of it pertains to… what you may need to know.”
him, and oh she would have done if she could have; together, they would have found a way—
“By the way, where’s my wand?”
“Friends,” Draco repeated sarcastically.
Fingers. Harry’d smeared most of the lube onto his own cock and Draco’s back, over one side of his arse. He reached for the tube, got more over his fingers. Panting, he spread Draco’s cheeks wide; his arsehole was furrowed, dusky pink, a little swollen from Harry’s hard use. It winked under Harry’s gaze, tightening, releasing, like the grip of Harry’s lungs, Draco’s muscles under his hands going tense. Harry slipped his fingers into Draco’s crevice and fluttered his middle against the spot — wetting it, making it glisten like it had during that glimpse Harry’d got when he’d pulled his cock out, before Draco’s fastidious cleaning charms. He circled it, the delicate folds flexing, needy, under his touch. Draco lifted his hips, needier still, pulling his knees under himself and out in a silent, splaying beg. Pushing against the tip of Harry’s finger, exhaling a shudder as his body gave to the pressure he’d created and Harry’s finger slid in.
“But you haven’t been able to stop thinking about having me since.”
Potter made a disgusted sound in the back of his throat. “You were the one who wanted to play.”
“But that’s when the Ministry gala is,” Harry said. “The Wizengamot will be putting the position to a private vote the following Monday.
Harry could claim a keen intimacy with this part of it — fingers curled tight against his own palms in a bid for self-control, following Draco’s body too close, the nearest surface they could fuck upon not satisfactory for some reason. Time measured by the throb of his pulse in his ready cock, waiting for what was about to happen. But the rest was unfamiliar. The nerves, his unwieldy shyness. He’d never felt shy before; never had reason to. He hadn’t cared what Draco had thought, or as good as: he hadn’t recognised it when he started to. All of it had felt like a means to one end or another.
her door before falling into his room. She followed, blood spatter covering her pale face, and slammed the door behind them.
Hermione allows the quiet to stretch out for a few minutes. She waits until Narcissa shifts — a small but restless movement — and then pulls the phone from her pocket.
I haven't even gone soft.
“We’ve established who I am,” he said, and because he was just as Machiavellian as I’d always suspected, added, “and exactly what I’ll let you do to me when you’re not a dickhead about everything. When you are, you get my back.”
Draco follows Potter’s gaze. They’re half-shielded by a bus with no roof that has
Harry watched him for a moment, then asked, “How long were you standing there, listening?” He hissed as Draco’s Numbing charm began to spread through the exposed nerves; they always burned a little before they started working, but not usually that badly unless Draco was feeling particularly cross with him.
As if he’d spoken aloud, Draco stirred and pushed the curve of his arse back to meet Harry’s swollen prick. He dragged his hand up and back, slipped his fingers into Harry’s hair and held him.
Potter gives him a half-smile/frown thing and tilts his head, laughing a little. “What? Is
“What’s with Malfoy?” Ron asked, dragging Harry in for another pounding hug after Draco excused himself.
“Being a wizard masseuse?”
“I see,” Malfoy said, an insidious whisper against the shell of Harry’s ear. “Neither would I.”
A hint of pink climbs Draco’s throat; his Adam’s apple bobs. Harry looks down at his meal, munching on a slice of bread and hoping the heat in his own face is coming from the fire, the blankets. When he glances back up, Draco’s cheeks are red and he’s holding the back of his hand to one of them as though trying to cool it.
“You’ll have to stop that sort of shit,” Harry said plainly, gripping the balls of his knees. They shifted under his palms, and he loosened his hold.
* * *
Draco, liquid by then with want, twisted to kiss him, as long and slow and heated as Potter had seemed to decide his little fingering session would go on for, and then said, “Shut up and fuck me, Harry, or I swear to Merlin I'm going to roll you over and take a turn.”
, nothing like the way he used to spit it at Harry, nothing like the way he says it when he’s trying to create a distance between them, so Harry doesn’t protest this time. The syllables of his surname tremble just enough that it sounds like an endearment. Maybe a plea. “We’ve had each other now. It might be wise to… stop.”
He stared at the parchment, trying to focus against the way the words jumped before he realised his hand was shaking. He dropped it, gaze following its trajectory as it fluttered to Potter’s pillow.
Hermione nods, mostly because doing something for no reason is better than doing nothing at all. But she says, “If she can’t speak and I can’t use magic on her, then—”
Harry breathed in hard gasps, his thighs aching, sweat gathered on the small of his back. His eyes had fallen shut and he opened them with some effort, words he’d never said to a partner on the tip of his tongue. But Draco was looking up at him, eyes bright but shuttered, something indecipherable shifting over his features when Harry cupped his jaw in one hand — and that jaw, tightening minutely against Harry’s palm, telling Harry something different even as Draco smiled at him wearily and let his leg fall. Harry exhaled and pulled out carefully, then leaned over him. Stroked the corner of Draco’s mouth with his thumb.
“How do you know I’m not?” Harry asked. But Malfoy only shrugged, frowning as Harry lifted the parchment. Embedded in the wax seal was the solicitor’s crest, and he looked at Malfoy again, who ignored him. Harry unfolded the letter, flattened it against the table. He scanned it, heart sinking. “What the bloody—? How are we not
you—”
,” he hissed, and turned up his toes to dig the heels of his shoes against the floor as if he’d realised Harry was leading him to one of the deserted alcoves off the atrium. Harry growled and tugged on his arm harder, so near he could almost taste it. But then Draco’s heels started to skid, and he huffed and wrenched out of Harry’s grip with a rather manic grin at no one in particular, stopping them in place. “What,” he said under his breath, smoothing down his robes with a nervous hand, “do you think you’re
“I hate
“Is that a question?”
, Pansy murmurs gently.
A small, churlish knot forms between Draco’s eyebrows before he can hide it. He stretches his legs out languidly, crosses one over the other. “Of course not.”
“Well, you’d better not start," Parkinson said, flashing Draco a warning glance.
What it
—until assassins poured into Draco’s flat, wands already ablaze.
“What?”
not sure which he’d prefer to hear. But Draco shook his head in place of finishing. “And under the stars, perhaps; it’s a tradition in my mother’s line.  As for the rest, I already told you: I have a talent for repair. I spent the majority of my sentence having a go at the damage done to the Manor. It was so extensive I couldn’t manage even half, but it helped me refine my technique.”
to prepare for this, hadn’t she? “I got Lavender Brown, if you can believe that… Though I actually like her form quite a lot.”
Harry sucked in a breath. He reached for Draco’s buttons, careful not to touch the push of fabric over his erection. There was a tremor in his fingers that seemed to come from the floor beneath him, a jarring quake that rippled up through his bones, out to every extremity. The buttons were wooden, smooth, polished. Harry pushed the first through its buttonhole, the second, the third, and moved to the parallel row.
* * *
“I’m just not sure what you’re referring to,” Harry says with as much honesty as he can muster. “There are a lot of things you could— The battle? Going into the forest that night? Dying?” He shakes his head. “The fact that people died for me, because of me? No.”
In the entryway, tearing his flies open as soon as his door was shut and locked behind him, and coming in a matter of seconds, a mere three or four jerks after he got a hand around his straining cock. Again, when he barely softened, making his way to the sofa and torturing himself with a variation of the image he’d had a few days prior of shoving Draco into the shadows, against the bricks — tugging on his erection slowly, one thumb smearing silky wet over his glans as he pictured Draco jerking his own trousers down and spinning, canting that arse towards Harry and spreading it open for him with a filthy, needy groan when Harry pushed inside. Later, in the kitchen, fucking into the tunnel of his fist when the memory of Draco’s tongue swiping over his lip got him hard in an instant, shuddering to climax at the thought of coming all over Draco’s cool, haughty face, and burning his eggs on the hob in the process. In the shower, gasping under the spray and leaning his shoulders against the cool tile, one foot propped on the lip of the tub, rolling his balls in one hand and teasing his rim with the other to the idea of letting Draco bend him over that massage table and have at him, until he was so maddened, just the sensation of his fingertips easing back the tight hood of his foreskin made him break.
, right?” The phrases were so deeply ingrained, it made his throat ache to say them in such a tone.
“It was Draco’s.”
Draco gives him a stilted nod. “I like… taking it. I’m good at it.”
Harry refuses to dignify that with a yes. In any case, the result isn’t nearly as bad as he thought it would be; Draco even managed to mend the metacarpals that had snapped under the pressure of Apparition. The scar stretching along the outside of Harry's hand isn’t pretty, has the look of something that’s just been cauterised — burnt raw and still oozing a bit of blood — but it’s something he can live with. Easily.
Draco whipped a hard, keen look at him. His skin was as delicate as winter, and just as pale and easily marked; Harry could clearly see the abrasions his stubble had left around Draco’s lips, on Draco’s chin and cheeks and neck. The rest of Draco’s body had been similarly branded by Harry’s hands and mouth, with bruises and love-bites, though Harry didn’t think their lovemaking had been particularly rough. He wondered what that indicated about Draco, if it was some sort of incidental, biological representation of how close to the surface everything Draco felt was, despite how contained he tried to be.
“I thought…” Draco’s voice thinned. “I— found it. Our third week here. I asked Kreacher… Once I’d got it open. And I closed it back up, but then you told me about him. Black. He was more than a godfather to you, closer to a father. Yes?”
And others, both informative,
of his body against mine. My orgasm drags out. If I'd been on my back, I'd probably have shot all the way up to my chin at the sight: Potter staring at me, flushed and gorgeous, that stupid spatula still in his hand.
recovery won’t take either of us very long.”
“I was actually referring to my letters,” Draco said. “Mother can attest to them.
“I know,” he said again.
him, and wanting to be wanted by him. Twisting his fist around the head of his cock and groaning, imagining his touch was Draco’s. Imagining what might have happened if he hadn’t denied him at the top of the staircase. Lonely for more than that.
She strolls to the fireplace and lifts the single photograph that’s been tipped onto its face. Granger’s wedding day. She and Weasley are looking at each other, and the lower half of Granger’s cathedral veil loops around the small of Weasley’s back, to pull him closer. A backdrop of fairy lights lends a warm glow to their smiles, but there’s something awkward about their positioning — the pose is clearly staged, but their stillness looks unintentional. “Very pretty. This is magical, is it not? What happens next?”
“I deserve to know if you’re doing something that might hurt you.” Ron grumbled it, but his face was already softening. “Even if you can’t tell me what it is. So I can be
“I didn’t. I’m sorry,” Harry says again. It sounds pointless even to his own ears.
” Harry asked, an odd, sickly burn of anger pitting in his stomach and cooling the rest of his body. It was startling and unpleasant, almost completely foreign — he could only recall having felt it before once in his life. He resolutely turned his mind away from the memory, staring hard at Draco’s back as he lifted the lid from the box to reveal an old-fashioned phonograph. “How?”
“You’ve got to see what my gifter got me! I’m waiting for you to open it, get out here!”
As though he can sense you want to touch yourself, he grabs the hand clutching his arse. Then the other, the only prop you have to hold yourself up. But he becomes your prop, holding both arms stretched behind your back as he rides you unmercifully, keeping you from falling onto your face, your back at an unnatural arch.
“That should make it harder for them to grab me,” Malfoy says, casting Harry a look. But he lets Harry haul him up from the floor and plops down easily at the foot of the bed. Harry can feel his gaze on him as he rifles through his pack to pull out a tin of beans, his can-opener, and the heavy bag of shelled pistachios he’d harvested from the market. Harry tosses the bag to Malfoy, who catches it deftly. The plastic rustles loudly as Malfoy unties it and reaches inside for a handful. Setting the bag aside, Malfoy adds, “If we ever actually leave.”
Malfoy didn’t answer; he padded to the door, footsteps long and quick. A moment later, Harry heard it open and shut. He let out a breath, alone for what felt like the first time in a bloody year.
“In all things. I am Harry fucking Potter, you know.” He kissed me — slow, easy. “Try not to forget it.”
Once upon a time, Draco thinks, his father could have been a good man.
That’s the least of Harry’s concerns right now, really, but there’s no real way to talk to Malfoy about them without alarming him unnecessarily. Or necessarily, he’s not sure. But he doesn’t want to go back to Malfoy’s stuttery panic from the first night. He’s got the feeling that no matter how well Malfoy’s been applying himself to their rigorous training, that break of hyper-awareness and disbelief is still simmering just under the surface of his psyche. Harry doesn’t really have time for that, and he resents worrying about when or if it’s going to happen.
yes. He wants to see Malfoy. Wants to have him. Wants to be able to decide on what charms they use, and whether or not to use any at all. Wants to bite him on that dipping point at the join of shoulder and neck, feel the split of skin under his teeth. The urge to lay claim is wrath under his skin. He feels strung out, like the worst sort of potions addict, at the thought he might not get the chance.
“Harry—”
It wasn’t really any sort of response but as they continued, Malfoy’s shoulders slowly came down and he removed his hands from the pockets of his jacket, swinging them curled loosely at his sides. He was still walking fast enough to stir the carefully-styled, pale quiff of his hair and his face was grim, but the hard nastiness of his scorn seemed to have faded.
He stalked from the dining room, Malfoy’s implied accusation buzzing like a hornet in his ear. It was downright offensive, not that Harry expected Malfoy to ever be anything else. Harry had never treated an elf the way the Malfoys had —
“You’re not here,” he says. He means to say it firmly but it comes out soft and wretched. She smiles and shrugs.
Malfoy drew back, his cheeks paling in the warm firelight, and a funny pit formed in Harry’s stomach. Malfoy looked to the fire, gave a slow nod. “Of course not,” he said smoothly, before Harry could speak. “Nor do I want to. But we are, as you so eloquently pointed out, partners of a sort, at least for the duration, and—”
The word sank in, blinding and overwhelming, and when Harry’s vision cleared, he was several feet away, looking at Malfoy still sagging back against the door jam, but slowly straightening. Malfoy made to take a step and Harry held out a hand, pushing him back into place — holding him there with the force of magic rolling in him, bleakly, the rage of a storm.
,” he said, staring Malfoy dead in the eye. “This shit? What I’ve been doing with you? It’s ridiculous, but it doesn’t have to be a
Harry blinked, the flood of adrenaline abating and resurging — dizzily, the room swam around him. He was turned by the grip of Bill’s hand, was wrapped in one hug, another and another. Ron said, “I’m sorry, mate,” and Arthur shook his head against Harry’s shoulder. The scent of Luna’s hair brought to mind freshly turned earth and lakewater — her hands were soft on the back of his neck — and when it was Hermione’s turn, she locked her arms around him and, in a wet, wobbly voice, said, “I’ll keep looking, Harry, I
Draco was looking at him blankly. “No matter what happens between—?” His eyebrows snapped together, and he flicked his wand at Harry’s robes, jerking him forward, then tucked the wand into his sleeve and pressed a hard kiss to Harry’s mouth. Stomach fluttering, Harry tried to kiss him back but Draco pulled away too quickly. He grabbed Harry’s hand and muttered, “Fuck this.”
Draco turns and meets Harry’s eyes. “Go on, then.”
last name. He didn’t do it with everyone — he wasn’t as hopeless as Malfoy seemed to think — but he could sort of see Malfoy’s general point. He nodded. “Okay. Let’s do that again.”
“‘The obvious reasons’ being that you’d no longer be able to threaten her life to control me.”
“Because despite how much you wanted me, and how much I may — or may
— and stood, shoving his pumpkin juice back in his bag.
The thought leaves an odd taste in the back of Harry’s mouth and he doesn’t know why. If Malfoy’s gone, he’ll be one of thousands, maybe millions at this point depending on how far this thing’s spread. Just another in a long line of losses.
The brass doorknob, the door, the wall—
Teddy sobs again and Harry’s heart starts to fall. But then Teddy hiccups, sniffles, and wipes his wet face against Harry’s wet neck again. Chest hitching almost soundlessly, he relaxes a little in Harry’s arms and mumbles, “Draco punk-anshoo?”
The official announcement regarding Potter’s permanent acquisition of the position is expected to take place in two months, after contract negotiations and a thorough overview of the current budget. In the meantime, we will be reporting on Potter at the fundraising gala for war orphans, which takes place at the Ministry two days hence. We anticipate furnishing all of our lovely readers with a plethora of photographs of our new Interim Head Auror in formal robes. Hurrah, you say? So say all of us, as well!
“What the fuck does that mean?” Harry asked tightly. “I’m doing what’s required to—”
Draco’s back hitched against his chest. “You can,” he breathed, rolling the heel of his hand up Harry’s shaft through his pants. “We both will, then I’ll—”
Draco gives him a cautious look. Harry nods at him to go on and he sighs.
* * *
Draco shudders; he doesn’t even bother hiding it. His pupils are shot, wide and black. But he says, “Not yet.”
Draco smacked him in the shoulder, pushing him back. “No there isn’t. It’s just my pillow.” He stuffed it under his head situating his temple against the lump of hard metal. “And dry it off, if it bothers you.”
“Good.” Draco nudged the door with his heel, swinging it open. “The bathroom is better appointed.”
” Draco hissed, even as his body seized to refuse Harry’s entrance. Harry reached down and cupped Draco’s arse, spreading his cheeks further apart. He pushed harder, a groan tearing out of him when he forced his way past the stubborn muscles of Draco’s sphincter— felt Draco pushing against him, determined to soften his own involuntary resistance. And then it worked, and Harry sank in with a stifled sound, pleasure washing over him, one long hard stroke lodging him as deep as he could go. Draco flattened his hands on the countertop, back arching, and said it again: “Yes.” And more, when Harry caught his breath enough to look up from where they were joined: “God. Harry. Do it. Fuck me. Fuck me.
, at least."
Catching Draco's elbow, Harry looped an arm around his ribcage, a few steps from his room. Kissed him, washed full with longing, a high-tide of it from his toes to his throat. The skin around Draco’s mouth was turning pink, and along his jaw, and down the side of his neck, and under his chin. Harry resented his own stubble, and was turned on by it too — by marking Draco as a well-kissed man in that little way, and marking himself on Draco’s skin as someone who couldn’t get enough of him. It was a good look for them both, he thought.
“Right next to that little mole.”
Harry met Draco’s defiant gaze. It felt like such a small thing to say, but cornered — a triangular statement, each slant leading to a narrow point. Harry thought it might cut his throat to get it out.
Draco’d said, voice hoarse after a weeklong holiday in Paris six months back. Harry, trapped behind his desk and furious, could only stiffen his jaw and fumble blindly in his desk for a lozenge. Draco had sucked it into his mouth, the rasp of his words fading, teeth gleaming with a shark-like grin in Harry’s direction before he’d gathered the files that had accumulated on his desk in a neat stack and strolled out to get signatures on them.
“What might you have to offer?” Narcissa asks, feigning interest.
The words practically had a taste to them, a fold of treacle-sweetness, a bite of lemon. Adrenaline shocked through Harry; he bounced on the balls of his feet and headed across the hall to pull on some joggers and a shirt, his excitement complicated only after he was dressed by the realisation that he had no idea where the duelling room
“How, then?” Harry asked. His breath had turned ragged, resentment spilling through him at the bitterness on Malfoy’s face. At his gall. As though Malfoy were the injured party in all of this. Harry’s hands caught the billow of Malfoy’s shirt at the waist; he fisted them, jerking the excess of material from his trousers. Sliding his palms under it when it was loose, then up over Malfoy’s back, over smooth skin and a tensing twist of muscle. “We go weeks and then have to shag before a whole day has passed, is that what I’m supposed to take from this?”
“So I recall from your little attempt to use Veritaserum on me.” Narcissa spreads her hands. “Not that it would have worked, regardless.”
“Did…” I cleared my throat, smoothing the uncertain note from my voice. “Did you not hear me when I said I dislike you?” Hate, I’d meant to say hate.
Harry kept his mouth shut for the long silence that followed. His lips throbbed; his whole body felt licked by heat, his flush probably visible even on the backs of his knees. Harry’d been at the centre of situations far worse, but in the moment it seemed like the most mortifying of his life.
“Potter.” Draco said his name weakly, his shoulders leaned against the door.
“No,” Harry ground out, and stared at the rug, drawing in a long breath. He forced his hands to unclench.
will never be a true replacement for water and soap. So, bath. Go draw us one.”
of it — but his hand landed on Malfoy’s shoulder instead, and he whirled Malfoy around to face him.
At about a third of the size of the one in the prefects’ baths after the transformation Grimmauld Place had undergone, the baths were still overlarge — roomy enough for both of them to stretch out with barely an overlap of their legs, if they chose to sit on opposite ends. They didn’t.
“The one thing I doubt anyone’s ever accused you of being is stupid,” Narcissa says.
“I thought that was when you realised you wanted me,” Draco says, surprised.
He hears a little sniff. More warmly, she says, “How are you?”
“That you saved him,” Harry said, flustered. “That he likes you. That he’s grateful.”
“You could have stayed,” he said. “I told you it was fine.”
When he was finished, he opened a window for any return Owls and ran a practiced eye over the lengthening shadows on his walls; they either indicated that he’d been awake for far longer than twenty-four hours — or that his flat was due for a good cleaning, which was very likely also true. Then he stripped out of his clothes on the way to his room. Leaving each item on the floor where he took it off, Harry removed his robes last and took them with him to bed, tucking them under his pillow, and then fell asleep for a solid fourteen hours, a blessing for Ron’s skill drifting through his head when he woke up.
“You—?” Minerva says. “Why?”
Lucius scowled and started to shake his head, but Narcissa cut off his gesture with a gracefully lifted hand, a nod. Her shoulders slumped, and Malfoy tore his hand out of Harry’s grip before he could weigh in, heading to Narcissa to prop her up. Sending a scowl of his own to Hermione.
“They wouldn’t,” Harry says, low. “And— And if they would— Draco, I wouldn’t let them.”
“But why are the clothes like that?”
“No.” Harry finishes off his coffee and sets the mug aside. He draws Draco closer and kisses his cheek, his mouth. He tastes like spiced coffee, and his tongue slides against Harry’s, warm and unrushed, until Harry pulls away. “I like you in everything you wear.”
Potter is forever
“Maybe these,” Ron said, frowning at a set of red and silver robes as if considering them. Ron twirled his finger in silent command, and Harry glared but turned like a mannequin on cue. Ron cocked his head. “So what
Harry fumbles for his wand, anxiety surging through him when no telltale warmth flares to life in his grip. Magic scalds its way through his veins, sizzling through to his frozen fingertips, but his wand is just a bloody
Potter whined, and then Draco was being handled, so roughly he had to cut off a moan that slipped out of his throat. His eyes flew back open and Potter pushed a hand between Draco’s thighs, lifting Draco’s right leg and slinging it over his forearm, pinning Draco to the wall.
Malfoy’s quiet for a bit. The neighbourhoods they’re travelling through lengthen. Space stretches between the property lines until finally they’re replaced with farmland — crops that have dried out and gone to waste from lack of care.
Potter’s eyes darkened. He flicked Draco a little glance, then pushed the hem of Draco’s robe higher, almost up to his armpits. “We don’t have time,” he said again.
Pansy’s eyes widened. “You’re really not even going to consider it for a second, are you?” she asked, burbling a shocked little laugh. She shook her head with a trace of admiration, then seemed to brace herself, the dips of her clavicle hollowing with tension. “I’ve already—” her voice broke, “—given you a lot of it. If you’re really that cle-ver.” Her words splintered, her forehead creasing. She gathered Draco’s covers tight in her fists. “But who. Might. Want Draco— to go?”
Still. Draco excelled at things, that was what he
Does he
Granger nods as well — suspicious, formal — and leaves as quietly as she came, with a slip out of Narcissa’s door followed by a momentary pause, ostensibly to ask the elves stationed outside to bring her the list of Narcissa’s requested reading material. Her tone is gentle, utterly respectful, and Narcissa sits back to consider it until she hears Granger’s footsteps fade from the outer chamber of the Healing wing before leaning over to retrieve the copy of
“She told you about him?” he asked. “What she’s doing for him?”
“Oh.” Hermione blinked. “No, I suppose not,” she said, coming to sit next to him. “I think it’d be fine even if you weren’t technically one of my clients.” She looked at him, apology shining clear in her eyes, then came over to sit next to him. “I wanted to tell you— things.”
Harry quirked him a grin. “Doesn’t the host get to dictate the order of events?” he asked, lowering his head to mouth along Draco’s cock through the cotton of his pants. It jerked under his ministrations.
Potter made a small, irritated sound and dug his fingers tighter into my sleeve, almost warningly. I shook him off and he said, “Malfoy, where is this coming from?”
Probably wanted to make sure he hadn't got himself killed, too. Harry doesn't begrudge him that, not after this morning.
“Elf?” Potter asked when Draco cut himself off, cheeks burning. He stared blindly at the recipe once more, the parchment now spotted with beef broth and olive oil. Potter sounded wry. “Close enough, I guess. How did you reorganise your gifts for Ron?”
, Harry couldn’t even comprehend its enormity in full. After everything.
you say to convince him?” He put the robes in a smaller ‘maybe’ pile at Hermione’s nod, giving her a wink and waggle of his eyebrows while he was at it. Harry grimaced and considered bringing up the time Ron caught him with a hand up Ginny’s shirt.
The Inferi lumbers towards him, and Harry holds his breath. He presses his back to the tree as its features begin to sharpen: It’s the one with no eyes. Her decomposing arms are outstretched, her bony fingers pulled into clawed points. Her balance is off, and the drag of her footsteps lists her sideways, robbing her of their usual speed, but Harry doesn’t doubt she’ll be on him within seconds if he alerts her to his position by moving or trying to run too soon.
Malfoy inhales shakily, and lags behind when they get closer to the building. He nods and waits beside one of the pumps, and Harry goes inside,
“Yeah.”
"That wasn't precisely what I asked, but I suppose it works," Malfoy says. And then he— he
what you meant, Potter.” Malfoy licked the shine from his lips, and said, “I was drunk and you were there. I’ve kept my head down since.”
Harry pushes the door open. Teddy’s in the fresh pyjamas Harry left at the foot of the bed, purple footies with a funny alien print, and Malfoy’s made the concession to leave off his shoes but is otherwise fully dressed in the clothes he arrived wearing, his stained white shirt pristine once more. Curled against Malfoy in the middle of Harry’s bed — though Malfoy’s on top of the covers, and Teddy’s tucked under them — Teddy looks at Harry and sticks his thumb back in his mouth, a wary kind of reaction that makes Harry swallow hard.
And yet, somehow, this is how things are.
He collects himself as best he can and joins Draco, who’s apparently decided he may as well pee, as long as he’s waiting. He shakes off and tosses Harry an arch look — with a little smirk that makes Harry, oddly, want to laugh— as he tucks himself away and zips up, and then hooks a finger into one of Harry’s belt loops. He gives it a gentle tug, releases it. “Now what?”
“Did I hurt your feelings?” Luna asked, the dreamy cadence of her voice taking on a momentarily forthright quality.
“I didn’t think. I sometimes don’t,” he admitted. The jut of Draco’s shoulder blade shifted under Harry’s fingertip, moving inward as Draco relaxed. “This part is new to me, too. When I woke up, when you kissed me—” he said, only for Draco to cut him off.
Shaking, Harry worked his remaining buttons open. Felt the fabric shift forwards as Draco’s erection was released. He reached for it, whining into Draco’s skin when Draco tightened his hands. “I— want—”
Weasley watched him approach, face blank, skin so pale his freckles stood out like a child had painted them on.
9. To see Harry Potter in the showers again, since I haven't shut up about it since it happened over a bloody week ago.
“Ah, he’s awake enough to comment on the time of my arrival,” Malfoy murmured. He unburied a pair of braces decorated by Snitches that Harry thought might’ve been a gift from Hermione years ago, frowned at them for a beat, and then threw them into the tiny pile of clothing he seemed to deem worthy of being kept. “And there’s another lesson: being ready for the unexpected guest oftentimes means waking up before eleven in the morning.”
“Don’t,” Draco said, jerking from Harry’s touch. “I don’t know why you did that. I said you shouldn't be involved."
“He’s not with us.” Pansy shrugged, one of her dress straps slipping off her shoulder. She fixed it with her pinky, then fiddled with the neckline of her dress, not meeting his eyes. “We don’t know where he is. Perhaps with Narcissa, but he’s never disclosed where she moved after the Ministry took the Manor, not even to me. It was safer.”
Draco shrugged — nodding, distant. “Didn’t need a lot of work.”
Before the fireplace, they let the solicitor read the incantation. Malfoy, for once, was silent, maybe for the same reason Harry couldn’t speak. There was too much anger boiling in his chest, a thunder of disbelief in his head. Then Malfoy’s hand slid into his. He laced their fingers together and lifted their hands before the solicitor, wrists pressed tight. The conjured length of silk wound around them, itchy and tingling. It was edged with tiny lettering that glowed brighter the longer it stayed in place:
“Well then.” Draco’s lips curl up to the side. Grey eyes calm, he hikes up his shoulder again.
Malfoy does, and a moment later pulls out a long, stretchy roll of bandage. Gaze narrow, tongue pressing the side of his cheek, Malfoy unrolls it and winds it around Harry, pinning his forearm to his waist and wrapping the bandages around Harry’s shoulder to keep it from moving too much. He hands Harry a small cloth and sets the bag to rights before exhaling and looking back to Harry’s face.
, he almost adds. But he can’t.
“Excuse him,” he said as Harry dumbly took the drink. “It takes him a few minutes to relax at these events.” He slanted a pointed look at Harry, then at the glass, his expression edging ever closer to a roll of the eyes. But colour was bled high on his cheeks, imperfect little blotches of emotion that told a different story and, almost as if he didn’t mean to, he pressed a little harder to Harry’s side, his hand coming up to rest flat between Harry’s shoulder blades.
“Not that I’d care, mind you,” Malfoy said when Harry didn’t respond. Harry heard the rustle of clothing, a whistle of fabric cutting the air as it was thrown aside. The clink and
Malfoy swoops down to retrieve the jacket. With an absent-minded sort of competence, he holds it open for Harry to slip his good arm into, then grabs a small, fitted crib-sheet from one of the lines and ties it around Harry’s waist. Harry tests it, twisting at the waist and bouncing on his toes a little to see if the jacket will slip off. It’s not the best solution, perhaps, a little too bulky to be truly comfortable or allow for the widest range of manoeuvering, but the jacket stays in place and his shoulder, while not comfortable, feels vastly improved from before. Without thinking, Harry smiles at him. Malfoy blinks and smiles back.
Something hits Draco’s door. Harry’s hand falls to Draco’s forearm, pulls him a bit closer. Hairline cracks appear in Draco’s window as it finally yields to the pressure of grasping hands, and they both pull their weapons, but then a
over them and swallowed hard at the small, appreciative noise Draco made in the back of his throat. “For the rest. Your future. What were your plans?”
“Or exact revenge when they won’t at all,” Granger says in a savage tone.
Harry shook his head to clear it, determined to avoid
Harry can’t even bring himself to take offence. “He woke up at five this morning,” he says, his shoulders going heavy with the realisation. “And the last couple of nights have been… interrupted too. I’d just gone to bed when he woke up. Not that I mind,” he adds quickly, in case Teddy can hear him over the sound of his tears. “Not at all. It’s normal, I keep telling him that.”
“That was pretty obvious from the second I got it,” Potter said wryly. “But until I saw the sort of things you picked for Ron, I thought it might be some big joke you were playing on me, that maybe you’d found out about…” His cheeks darkened. “...about the clubs. That maybe someone had seen me. And then I started to, you know, wonder.”
Something faltered in Malfoy’s expression. He straightened away from the table, a leisurely unfolding of his height. Uncovered, his shoulders took on a glow from the lit sconces around the dining room; his nipples were small and pink; the skinny trail of hair below his belly-button looked more golden than his distinctive shade of blond. His Dark Mark blurred, pale and shrunken, on the inside of his forearm. Harry turned away and picked up his wand from where he’d dropped it on the table, and he spelled everything to proper order.
He doesn't know how long they hold each other, but when Malfoy's shaking eases, Harry immediately loosens his grip. He settles on saying, “You look like you're hungry. I’ve got some food,” and is surprised into a half-smile when Malfoy gives a choked laugh.
“You think my father doesn’t.”
he’d clearly gone ‘round the bend and been committed, since he and Potter were both fevered and dreaming and cursed, he opened his mouth wider to the press of Potter’s tongue, pulling Potter down on top of him when they got to the bed. Potter groaned again, loosening his hold on Draco’s wrist and sliding up his hand to hold his jaw, tongue rubbing against his, lips hot and wet against Draco’s own. Draco took a fistful of Potter’s hair and tugged, not so hard that he’d pull away, but hard enough to wrench another groan from Potter’s throat, and he liked the sound so much he did it once more, even harder. Potter bit Draco’s lower lip, as if in warning, and sucked it between his teeth before crashing his mouth against Draco’s once more.
“I don’t think that,” he said quietly, relieved to find the grotesque swelling of Draco’s hand had disappeared. It still looked excruciating, his long fingers blister-red, but at least he wasn’t bleeding any longer. “I don’t think I’m better.”
“Then why have I been doing it for you for free?” Harry asks, and Draco smirks.
He stepped into his room and shut the door with a measured click.
Harry grunts, his wand swishing the water out of the break in the zippered entrance. “The elves.”
Jerking his pack from his shoulders, Draco leaves it on the road and runs for the trees.
stamped over every cover, every page. “But it’s not as if they’d mind or be shocked if they found out. Your friends. So it’s not really a secret of any real value. Give me a different one.”
“Malfoy?”
The ball of Draco’s throat moved in a hard swallow. He used his elbow to push off from the door frame. “Be that as it may,” he said, “he wants you. They might have an arrangement, like we’ll have an arrangement.” He walked up to Harry, smooth, loping strides that ate up the expanse of floor between them. “You could always ask, when we’re out of here. If that’s what you want.”
for your love of me, you love me
He blinks at her — so taken aback it brings a grim smile to Hermione’s face — before turning to the elves. “Would you voluntarily allow us to drain some of your magic to fortify the wards around Hogwarts, with no guarantee regarding how much we might need or the potential side-effects you may feel afterwards?”
Cleaning up is done with a wordless back-and-forth pass of Potter’s wand, and Draco pulls his pants and joggers back up as he hears Potter tucking himself away. They stretch out side by side, but Potter could be halfway across the earth for all Draco feels his presence, despite the unavoidable way their bodies touch, so he startles when Potter speaks.
“Ah. Well then.”
“Kreacher told me.”
unless it wavers.
“I gave him an order, okay?” Harry growls. “I gave him an order! He sensed I was in danger on a job several years ago and nearly got caught by curse fire when he Apparated to the middle of a wand fight. He’s not mine when I’m on duty, or when I’m on holiday,
Est. 2004
Done moving his creations, Malfoy sat on the rock. Harry swallowed again, abruptly aware of how much spit was in his mouth; there was a lot. His lips still tingled.
He’d flapped away the rest with a studied, careless wave of his hand.
Shocked, Harry opened his mouth to respond, but before he could think of any sort of reply, Bill shot him a weary smile and touched the mattress with the tip of his wand. Two bright, shining threads rose to curl around his wand, around each other, in an impressive display of silver and gold until his wand had virtually disappeared under their glow. It slowly faded, sinking into the wood — trapped for delivery. He tucked his wand away and pulled two gold rings from his pocket, setting them at the foot of the bed. Bill looked at them once more, to Harry and Malfoy and back, then turned and walked out.
There was something perverse about describing how many opportunities he had, when Draco’d been so matter-of-fact about his own status in society. And it felt dangerous, as well: working it out aloud, carefully, when he'd been so devoted to avoiding the topic before, even with himself. A sense of panic prowled about Harry, and he wondered at his own perceived contentment before the contract; so much of it had been about evasion.
Draco pauses, lower lip caught between his teeth and thighs quivering, Harry’s cock pressing right up to his rim. It clenches, flutters, and Harry takes in an unsteady pull of air.
“Your solicitor?” he asked. She whipped around to glare at him, haughty and disapproving, then past him, her face flickering with concern at the bangs issuing from Draco’s door. Harry winced a little; he perhaps shouldn’t have spelled the lock so tight — but it did give him a couple of extra minutes, so he said, “Didn’t you agree not to do that?”
can’t, not about—”
“Do you know what I’m going to get?” Draco asked, numerous horrible gifts flashing through his mind. “Raw meat. Someone is going to wrap up different kinds of raw meat and send it to me every day for nearly two weeks. If I’m
” Harry yelps, startled by a wet sizzle of pain racing across his nerves.
, because the magic in the contract is… unique, designed to furnish a marriage, and able to distinguish certain things about the descendants tied to it. Then there will be a period of private union, after which time you’ll be able to receive guests into your home."
“It’s one way or the other, Potter,” Draco says, curling it into the palm of his hand. “I’m in the thick of it, the same as you, aren’t I? You can take the glove or the wand.”
“I know. Which is why—” Harry stops. Draco’s worrying his lower lip with his teeth, gaze on the bead in his open hand. He lifts his face to search the sky, and then reaches out to pull Harry’s wand from the holster strapped to Harry’s thigh. Without using magic, he taps several points into the air above them like one might to wring a tune from chimes. He hands the wand to Harry, the breeze picking up to tousle his hair. Behind him, the sky matches the colour of his eyes, wet grey and intense.
Opening his eyes, Harry found Malfoy’s head still turned, his teeth clenched, his brow creased. But a hot blush had covered his cheek too, had tipped the creamy shell of his ear and bled down the side of his neck, and the long, slender fingers of one hand rested on the rug beside his head. Fisting and falling open, closing again, his thumb and forefinger catching the edge of the rug, trying to hold it. Harry stared at them as Malfoy continued his rutting upwards fuck. Thoughtlessly, they’d both begun moving faster, falling into a rhythm that wasn’t unlike weaving through the air on a broom — a swivel, a surge forward and pull back, a twist. A race to the finish.
“Well.” The look Draco gives him is sombre. “You’re a shit conversationalist, but I wasn’t exactly raised to hunt my own food, so I’m willing to make the compromise.”
“I did wait for you to come to me, after you ran from the Astronomy Tower — Rose is fine, of course? — but when a request for assistance isn’t forthcoming, it behoves one to be proactive.” Stirring her tea slowly, Narcissa adds, “You can only imagine my dismay upon summoning the Headmistress to find Minerva McGonagall at my door.”
“Uh, yeah. So what I said to Ron—”
“Fine,” Malfoy grinds out. Harry opens his eyes to find Malfoy’s trembling hand outstretched, palm up. Malfoy twitches two fingers. “Give it here, then. If it’ll shut you up. If anything will.”
"Oh. Yeah." Harry looked around. Loudly, he said. "Please stop offering that little shit extra worms! I promise, he's well-fed!" He glanced at Draco. "Good enough?"
Potter’s quiet for a beat. He stops and slides his glasses to the top of his head, then grinds the heel of his palm over one eyebrow. His voice is rough. “Yeah.”
“And I suppose you’ve got the recipe for boeuf bourguignon memorised,” Draco muttered, folding it up.
Draco shudders out a stiff nod, vision misting. Because yes… he did.
Harry aims the broom handle above the railing and leans in, and they shoot away from the hotel with satisfying speed, clean wind hitting Harry’s face as he takes them higher. Malfoy’s magic in him dwindles and pulses back, and they lose some height as the broom starts to fight them. Harry lets it happen and falls into an easy glide instead of trying to fly out of the district the way he’d been hoping to. The broom settles under them, putting more and more distance between them and where the Inferi have gathered in and around the hotel so stubbornly, like a dark knot of death closing in. From his periphery, he sees the ones from their balcony topple over it to the ground; they’re probably stunned but they’ve obviously noticed his and Malfoy’s flight, which means it won’t be long before the others do too.
” Malfoy groaned. He fucked himself on Harry’s cock, a helpless look crossing his face, and stuffed a hand between them. Harry shivered, hating how the heat of that — Malfoy touching himself, Malfoy about to come all over him — made his toes curl so hard his arches cramped. But even as he gasped and sought Malfoy’s mouth again, Malfoy twisted and pushed weakly at Harry’s shoulder. Clung to him. Pushed. “No,
Ron muttered something about Draco being a git; Hermione didn’t respond at all. But after they unanimously decided on the second set of black robes and Ron and Hermione were getting ready to leave, she pulled out of Harry’s hug to look earnestly into his eyes and said, “You really can’t figure out why Malfoy refuses to be seen with you in public?”
They think they remember what it was like, but memories have a way of fading over time. It’s been ten years, five months, and one day since the last time their names were on its list.
he thought. Why were they still using each other’s last names?
Draco swallows, nods. “Where?”
“And take some holiday time.” Malfoy shook his head at Harry’s open mouth, his own turning down grimly. “Let the current Head Auror shoulder some of his actual work for a while. I’ve been thinking on it, and I don’t think two hours per week will be enough. We’d be lucky to do it in six months on that time table; there’s no way we can accomplish it in one.”
Harry seized the opportunity to look away from the bright colours; the first warning of a headache flickered at the base of his skull. “I meant to talk to you about that, sir. How the audit went, if you’ve heard anything promising about my advancement.”
“And you think I do?” Malfoy asked, with a choke of laughter.
“She?”
Narcissa kept her smile on, vapid and expectant, and thought of the hexes her sister had designed for those who forgot to pull their heads out of their books, forgot to look over their shoulders.
Knocks sounded periodically throughout the day. Draco ignored them. With the help of a few eager-to-please elves, he was determined not to leave Pansy’s room until study sessions Monday — and maybe not even then; term was done, after all, and it wasn’t required he attend anything. Anyhow, Pansy had taken one look at his face and volunteered to bunk with her “new friend” from Ravenclaw who’d offered to “share notes,” though it didn’t escape Draco’s notice that she didn’t throw any pyjamas into the parcel she got together of her things. He ignored that, too.
Draco started to shake his head. Hesitated. Then: “No! Well— No.
Harry searches his face. Draco meets his gaze without hesitation — calm and mild, with a hint of
“Listen, Malfoy...” Harry doesn’t look at him as he trails off, and it hits Draco with the force of a hexed Bludger. Why he’s calling him Malfoy again, what he’s trying to find the words to say.
But love has been a saving grace at least once for each of them, and when Draco opens his eyes, Harry can see that he knows it. Harry slips Draco’s braces from his shoulders, leaving them to dangle, and takes off his shirt. “Come on.”
, it’s now thirty.”
to let the curse fly. Wanted to see Malfoy bleed again.
“Are you still half asleep too?” Harry asked, flopping down. “Because that didn’t make any sense.” He ran a hand down the long line of diagonal brass buttons from the shoulder of his robes to his hip, shrugging his robes off when they came undone. Draping them over the back of the sofa, he unstrapped his holster from his thigh. Honestly, it was probably a good thing Malfoy’d woken him; the last time he’d fallen asleep in uniform, he’d had a bruise-ring around his thigh for a week.
”, to Draco’s rattled-off questions, and Ron’s fierce rejection of Draco’s orders to leave the room, and the pained, choking sound Ron made when a strange, measured flatness crept into Draco’s voice as he said, “Go tell your wife and bring her back with you, he should have his family near him if— Ron. Get Hermione.”
It wasn’t that Draco disliked conjured lube, exactly, but it did have the tendency to run sticky if you didn’t have enough focus, and right before sex, it was almost sure that your focus would be splintered. And since he was definitely planning on having sex with Potter soon, he thought it might be wise to procure some. All it took was a quick walk down from the jewelry shop to the Disillusioned room in the back of
Despite that, your knees go weak when a sheet of parchment is pushed under the door. The hard onslaught of
.— and for once Harry doesn’t miss it.
Harry nodded slowly. “How much?”
,” he murmurs, breath hot and damp, and nips roughly at Harry’s earlobe. He doesn’t waste time making Harry ponder his meaning, simply rests the flat of his hand on Harry’s chest and skims it downward, then slides after it, his eyes on Harry’s the whole time. He avoids touching Harry’s cock but for a brief rub of his knuckles over the underside of the shaft, and crouches with his mouth hovering over where Harry’s erection juts toward his belly button. He gives Harry a waiting smile so slow and carnal, Harry doesn’t doubt his prediction. He shifts his hips.
“I truly wish,” Weasley said heavily, behind him.
“Well. That was quick.” Draco’s next kiss is perfunctory, his smile strained. He turns around, pulling out of Harry’s arms. Tipping his head back to rinse his hair under the water, eyes closed, he says, “They caught me leaving yesterday afternoon after a thirty-six hour shift; I’d been up all night tending a patient that kept trying to die and didn’t have time to think up a good response. But I’ve got a good one for next time, don’t worry.” He steps out from under the spray and runs a hand over his wet hair to wring out some excess water before eyeing Harry expectantly. “Poor Potter. Did you get to vanquish
Narcissa narrows her eyes for a beat. And then: “What a lovely offer.”
A month ago, Harry would have felt it like an ache in his joints, a healed bone break in cold weather that left someone scrambling to find warm shelter. But now, it didn’t have the same impact. Harry took the hit stoically, a brief, piercing disappointment; whatever the ‘but’ was about didn’t necessarily mean all hope was lost. He made a mental note to add it to his Owl to Draco, and nodded his encouragement. “What is it?”
“You complete shit.” I scowled. It occurred to me that if he’d really been looking for a way to get rid of me, he might have found it; I had no doubt I’d have my revenge if he walked out now, which would cost me my hard-earned placement here.
it is much more difficult a thought than showering in the open like he’d done so often after Quidditch in school. It takes him a moment to muster the courage to focus his magic, to let himself feel the thrum of it learning the shape and wood and core of Potter’s wand. There’s a disconcerting blend of curiosity and familiarity in his hand, like that first morning waking up in his own bedroom whenever he was on break from school. Draco takes a deep breath and aims the wand at himself, then murmurs
“Yes,” Harry said unthinkingly, voice low, gazing at the streak of custard on Draco’s upper lip. Harry took a breath and looked down at the clink of his spoon against his bowl. Hand trembling, he set his spoon down.
“Some of us aren’t horrified at the thought of having a life,” Draco snapped, scowling. It was both a confirmation and a rebuke. He dropped into his chair and waved a hand. “Get this before I throw it at you.”
in Harry’s ear. Four more stairs, Draco’s arms wrapped around Harry’s shoulders, his leg curling around Harry’s hip. Like a dream of a marathon where the ribbon gets further away the longer you run and you realise you’ve been walking in place. Like a dream of all sorts of things, the click of Draco’s boots on the landing after the last three stairs, but a continental divide still between them and Draco’s door, and his whined growl vibrating against the slope of Harry’s neck.
“Just— wait a second.”
The result of it all was an apology, softly spoken into Harry’s ear when Draco thought he was asleep.
, and popping out of the low waistband, which narrows to a tiny strip of material hooked over the jut of his hips. The rest of his cock is confined, his balls a tightly-pressed bulge under the solid panel of material covering the crotch, the intricate webbing of the lace beautifully obscene over the length of Draco’s shaft. Draco covers it with his hand, and Harry opens his mouth to object, but Draco merely palms himself, fingers splayed so Harry can see. “More.”
“God,” Harry breathed. He took his hands away and examined it closely, detecting a faint, white glow. “What, exactly, is it that you do?”
There’s always another choice.
“Malfoy,” Potter says again, gently this time. “You had to.”
That, and the close-knit cluster of buildings about a quarter of a mile off the road they’re following.
, it whispered in her ear as though tempting her,
But Narcissa knows when to speak, and when to hold her tongue. By all accounts, Granger is a brilliant witch; she’ll figure out the necessity of negotiation soon enough. Narcissa allows her lips to curve up just a little more, as vacant and expectant as the day she was Sorted. She spots a flash of colour behind the curtain and blandly turns her gaze from it.
“Oh shut it. Being in your presence, drunk or no, has
“We’ll talk about things later,” he says, shifting his gaze to the bin. He drops the cloth into it with a small splash and puts it on the floor. “You should rinse off and change. I put some clothing into the bathroom for you, and then we should eat; I’ve got food ready.” He hesitates. “Can you make it there on your own?”
Her hair is messy, dark, half-covering her face, and she walks with a limp, her slender shoulders rounded forward. Her pale green dress flutters in the breeze, its skirt stained with blood. She’s got no shoes on, and she’s so petite, the delicate bones of her feet reminding him of—
. He folded it in thirds and sealed it, then handed it over to the owl with a gentle stroke of its feathers. “61B Diagon Alley South. Draco Malfoy, all right?”
“He’s probably too noble to do the things you read in those gothic romances you hide around your room, Pansy.”
“No, but she’s rather stubborn,” he said fondly. “And her actions say enough.”
His team is looking at him silently — warily. Most of them have joined the ranks within the last few years, and have never before actually witnessed where the rumours about Harry stemmed from. Not outside the field of battle. When Ron worked beside him, he used to keep Harry in the loop for the gossip about him: Auror Potter in a temper can literally suck all the air from the room (only once, and the windows were open, so no one got hurt); Auror Potter duelled twenty Dark Wizards at once and killed them all (there’d only been nine, and he’d got lucky); Auror Potter shows as little compassion to his colleagues as he shows to his enemies (he simply has very high standards for the people entrusted with guarding his back); you can’t get as deadly as Auror Potter, Ron admitted to hearing when Harry began to wonder about the looks he’d started getting, without losing your ability to love.
Potter peers at him with bright eyes through his dark mop of hair, which Draco’s cock seems to take as a signal to start perking up, and Draco thinks,
“He’s, he can’t, he’s fine,
Potter shrugged, so unperturbed by Draco’s tone, Draco almost growled. “So nothing.” He propped himself on his elbows on the edge of the counter, crossing his legs at the ankle, and studied Draco silently for a few minutes as Draco Summoned a towel and charmed it to finish wiping down his station. “It was a good present for you, then.”
Ron narrowed his eyes. “I don’t think I’ve seen you out of your uniform in a year.”
been, that because it
. Harry,
The slender shafts of light coming in from between and around the doors steadily vanish under the golden scarlet of the spell Harry uses to solder the doors together; he drops his arm, and they stand in silence, watching, as the spell continues without undue force, graceful sparks of magic coaxing along the bright flares of melting metals.
But Draco was also determined to be of some use, or at least entertained. With materials Harry procured for him, he crafted a house for the family of sparrows Harry still fed every morning, drifting delicate charms in the pocket under its thatched roof to keep them warm, and interrupted Harry’s reading every afternoon to have him act as an interpreter with Fearful. The little snake had lived, Harry gleaned, in the marshes at the southernmost boundary of the Malfoy lands, and was still new when a bird had flown off with his Source. This had proved troubling to him and had led to many hungry nights in the nest as the rest of his Den went in search for food. But one morning, he’d woken up in his new nest, and there was warmth, though not too much, and an abundance to eat, though he did prefer frogs to the worms he was fed.
Harry locked eyes with him. “It’s fine, Bill. Don’t worry, you can go ahead.”
Ron’s gaze was heavy on the side of his face, and Harry wanted to say yes. Wanted to be stubborn about it. Draco had invited him over the very same night Harry made his desire known, after all; he’d pulled Harry with him into the registrar’s chambers. But neither of those things had been his idea. It was a sickening realisation. Harry shook his head.
“I needed coffee; you kept me up late,” Draco says, gesturing with his cup.“And I thought it wouldn’t hurt to clean up a little.” He tilts his head. “Where else could I have gone?”
“I meant what I told you this morning,” Draco says. His patrician angles don’t lend nearly as well to kindness as they do to scorn, but his eyes are serious, and the downward curve of his mouth looks gentle. “It’s alright not to presume the worst. Probably better that you don't.”
His forehead touched Draco’s, and Draco watched Potter’s face as Potter rolled his hips, cock sliding between Draco’s tensed muscles. His lower lip disappeared between his teeth and he looked down between them. Draco did too, unable to see more than hints of Potter’s cock between their stomachs. But he could feel it, smooth and hard between his thighs, rubbing over that spot behind his risen bollocks, sliding against the underside of his arse. Potter shuddered and cupped Draco’s arm.
In the long silence that follows, Hermione brushes her lank curls from her face, then starts picking at her ragged thumbnail to keep from biting it; she chewed it down to the cuticle days ago and, though it doesn’t hurt, she has a hazy memory of watching blood well up from the split in her skin, filling the nail bed, and streaking down to her knuckle. She looks up and meets Minerva’s thoughtful gaze.
“Okay, that was a very bad idea,” he said.
"We strike a bargain, then," Malfoy said. Harry continued the slow-stirring of his tea, unmelted sugar grating against the inside of the cup, and warily watched Malfoy's approach. "To…" Malfoy's lips twitched. "...get along."
Chapter Three: Psalm 27:2
Harry’s chest hurt. He rubbed it, grinding the heel of his hand over his heart. “Listen, I’m going to write to Hermione and Bill — don’t say no — to make sure your parents can’t— that there aren’t any other precedents that allow them to make this sort of decision for you. I won’t let them, alright?”
“Coffee seems to have that effect on you,” Harry said. He fiddled with his quill, pushing the fluttering brush of nerves down far enough that he could ignore it. “And I thought to apologise for not staying on Friday.”
Harry held up a hand to cut off his rambling. “Then he didn’t know what was wrong?” He touched Malfoy’s face; it was burning up. “Fuck. It’s a hotbox in here. Open a window and lower the fire. Turn up the lamps,” he said, carefully peeling down Malfoy’s covers as Kreacher scurried to obey. Malfoy was shirtless but clean, that same strange flush bleeding down his throat, keeping mostly to one side over his torso and one arm, and then the lamps glared bright and— “Oh, god.”
Harry couldn’t stand it, his nails dug deep into his palms with the effort it took not to touch him.
“Interhouse unity,” Potter said. Pansy gave a peal of laughter, as fake as any Draco had ever heard from her, and Draco’d had enough. He stood, briskly swiping over the rumples in his trousers and tucking in his shirt with short, jerky movements.
“Well, it's not
Whatever that may be.
“Right, you just tormented them for fun,” Harry said.
He Unshrinks everything and starts to close Potter’s bag, but Potter shakes his head and says, “Leave it open,” so Draco sets it near the door at the foot of the tent, and takes a long drink, stomach settling a bit at its reintroduction to fluids as Potter twists the cap of the small bottle and thumbs it open. He passes over two white tablets and says, “Take those, too. They’ll help.”
“Whatever.”
Sirius had told him once, in explanation of some of his tattoos: a stag’s antler rung by a wreath of lilies, a glowing moon on the wane. They were inelegant, messy. Magic practice in Azkaban, Sirius said, and unseen at that, worked into his skin under his fur but still there when he took natural form again. He’d squeezed Harry’s hand, then dashed a careless kiss across his knuckles. Harry, still not quite used to physical expressions of affection — and barely fifteen, besides, blushing whenever he had to work out how hard it was okay to hug Ron and Hermione back after summer recess — had flinched. Sirius’ eyes had darkened with an anger Harry didn’t understand, and he’d pressed Harry’s knuckles to his whiskered cheek.
The woman, coming from a different direction, seems to be somewhat more determined. Her eyes are as milky white as her thinning hair, her lips ragged as though she or her maker chewed them off. It shapes her mouth into a grotesque smile, and Draco can’t look away when Harry cleaves her hand from her arm. The slant of her eyes shifts to Draco, and she swipes out with her other arm towards him, then pulls back, Harry’s weapon whistling harmlessly through the air. It looks like a deliberate feint with the way Harry’s rhythm stutters as he’s forced to pull back on the swing, and Draco can’t shake the feeling that she’s
it had all been; as far as people their age went, Malfoy seemed to have a lot less than others to complain about. But what ended up sticking with Harry more, in the days and weeks that followed, was the way Malfoy had dissolved into broken sobs when Pansy Parkinson had Apparated in out of nowhere and pulled him close. The way Malfoy’s shoulders had rounded and shook as she hushed him and smoothed his hair back, her eyes gleaming with tears.
Malfoy yanks away, backing up against the cupboard  in— in fear, Harry thinks. He’s seen and felt enough of it lately to understand. Malfoy’s in a bad place, an even worse place than Harry is, and Harry’s at a loss for what to do. He’s not a bloody therapist, and he’s never even been that keen to study his
“I’m not—” Harry broke off with a helpless writhe against him, autonomy obliterated by the potency of his desire. He tucked his head harder against his arm to expose his neck, Malfoy leaning in and nipping at the bend of it. “I don’t—”
“I do what I have to, to protect my son,” she said, climbing to her feet. “As you well know.”
“All right,” Hermione says. “Call again in… in ten days to let me know where you are. Ten days from right now, and I’ll tell you when you can start through. I’m passing over the phone now. We’re running out of time, so he’ll have perhaps a minute or two to talk — and I’m putting it on speaker,” she says. It’s a reprimand, directed away from the phone. To Narcissa. Fuck,
“Right.”
she would say.
“Probably not as good as you will,” Potter said, voice rough. He flicked the buttons Draco’s nightshirt open one-handed and ducked his head into the crook of Draco’s neck. Kissing him there, he said, “I’d like to do that again, too. Uh, better than last time.” He laughed, warm and muffled against Draco’s skin. “I had to excuse myself for a wank today, I couldn’t stop remembering it.”
“Are you lying?”
“Do you really want to?”
Blowing out a breath, Harry swivelled again and tried the door. It stayed stubbornly shut. “Well?” he demanded. Silence answered him and he glared at the door. “I give my bloody word I won’t disrupt your bloody meeting in any bloody way, okay?”
Malfoy, that’s good.”
in it weren’t even looking at them. But still Potter sat across from him, as though he didn’t care one way or another whether they were spotted talking. His blasé attitude did absolutely nothing to help the edginess creeping through Draco, the heightened sense of fluster, like he was on display.
Paul grunted. "Div me gnomes and worms!"
“I’ve scheduled you for Friday,” Draco said, his eyes warming and lips pulling up to one side. Harry relaxed, surprised and pleased that it could be resolved like this between them: easily, calmly, no wands drawn. Then Draco said, “Even though you didn’t pay me for yesterday’s cancellation.”
Draco made a sound suspiciously close to a snort over his father’s quickly-indrawn hiss, but when Harry glanced at him, he was still perfectly composed. Narcissa cleared her throat, and Harry felt Draco straighten a bit next to him.
“Actually, I’m not sure how you managed to take us in here at all,” he says with a small purse of his lips. “The globe is charmed to respond only to me.”
train of thought for as long as possible, and set his shoes back on the floor. “Anyway, I’m here now,” he said more harshly than he’d intended. He stood and walked to meet Draco, who stayed near the back wall. Stopping in the centre of the room, he gestured, feeling beyond silly. “Do we have to do one of those evaluations first?”
* * *
Draco sighs and scrubs a hand over his face, good humour deflating. “I’ve been thinking about what I saw at the hotel. That, um. The first night. And since.”
“Don’t talk to Kreacher that way. He’s not a
“He was even wearing them when he got out of the shower last week,” Draco said. It hadn’t been what had first drawn his attention, but when he’d finally pried his gaze up from the soft bulge behind the towel hanging off Potter’s hips and the water clinging to his torso, those blasted things had sat on the bridge of his nose, crooked as ever, and fogged as well. How did someone shower wearing glasses? How could he even check the bottoms of his feet to make sure they were clean? He couldn’t, was probably the answer. The bottoms of Potter’s feet were likely caked with years of calluses and dirt, utterly disgusting.
“Right,” Draco said, pulling out of his fugue state. “No. I used a basin. But we were fourteen, and—”
"It's got to be a proper kiss, mind," George called out when they realised they were stuck, and laughed when Molly huffed and swatted him. Tipsy from the Firewhiskey crumble cake and gleeful about his joke, he didn't seem to notice that everyone else went still for a moment before joining in, as was standard back in those days.
“I will, if I get hungry.”
Malfoy didn’t turn. “It has holes in it,” he said dismissively. “And it doesn’t even look as though it’d fit.”
Malfoy looked good, though. At home and comfortable even in his discomfort, the shadows of sleep already chased from his pointy, aristocratic face. And Merlin, posh, even in threadbare pyjamas, the elegant arch at the bottom of his pale foot drawing Harry’s attention. His toes were scattered with golden hair, and the almost-delicate knob of his ankle peeked out from where his bottoms had hiked up. His legs were so…
“Nothing in particular. That you’re responsive to physical touch, how intimate you find it. That it… that it means a great deal to you. That it can.”
“Your lips are cold,” Draco said. He gulped and slid his fingers into Potter’s damp hair, pulling him in for another kiss.
Draco at that age had already begun getting taller, had already lost the last bit of baby fat in his cheeks. By the time he came home on holiday, third year, so much about him had seemed different, she’d nearly called a Healer. Lucius, chuckling and pulling her close, had reassured her it was all normal for a growing young man of good stock — how Draco would retreat to his room, seemingly at random, and set up his own wards so she couldn’t get past them; how hungry he was all the time, smiling sheepishly at her whenever she discovered him in the kitchens, eating a second dinner after the first.
It had begun snowing outside, unusual in London until later in December — like the storms before it and the persistent heat of the summer had been. More unusual was the way it seemed to be sticking, swirls of fat white flakes coming to rest against the high, ground-level kitchen window ledges, building there, a spread something clean hiding the grime layered over the city. Harry’s eyes wandered to it on every floor as he ascended through the house with Draco, wondering what all of it meant.
“I’m sorry,” Pansy said. “But it’s just a… crush. An obsession, you know. You’re already sort of becoming friends, aren’t you? You just need some distance. After enough time has passed and we get out of this dreadful place, you’ll meet someone who—”
, sometimes — and then folds his own fingers around them.
Harry ignored that. “He picks fights over stupid things instead of talking to me about— about how he hates my job, or if we’ll get mobbed when we go out in public, or that I’ll grow tired and leave him for the hot new Auror in the office—”
Harry wasn’t sure he did. But he pushed up with a final nip to Draco’s jaw and got back on his knees. Holding his breath, he cupped Draco’s arse cheeks — massaged them, pushing Draco’s hips to the mattress, a slow fuck downward, liking the small grunt Draco gave. He bent and kissed the dimples on the small of Draco’s back, licked them, dragged his tongue down between his hands, over the crack of Draco’s arse. And then lower, not wanting to stop yet, feeling as drunk as Draco sounded, from the scent of his sweat and the taste of him, and how Harry could scent himself too, under Draco’s freshening charms. Lips trailing along the pull of Draco’s seam, to his balls; they were plump, pressed to the mattress, his sac shiny and responsive to Harry’s tongue. Harry licked over them, sucked them into his mouth as well as he could, his tongue shifting soft, tender skin, lips pulling, mind lost in the heat. His position was awkward, wrong for this sort of thing, but worth it when Draco started shaking, when he cried out, and then muffled his cries with the pillow. They were devastated sounds, nonsensical, but Harry heard a
“I enjoy maths.”
Malfoy’s eyebrows came in. “Of course. There was a rumour you could find it at Hogwarts if you looked hard enough, so—” He stopped, a troubled look creasing his face.
in the title. It's incredibly overpriced, by the way."
Hermione takes a deep breath to modulate the suddenly frantic pace of her heart. It won’t do to start crowing in triumph. “It was more of a question, actually.”
The spit of the Floo interrupted him. Draco hurried over from the window, this time fitting himself to Harry’s side, and Bill appeared — ducking out, dusting himself off. He looked good, his hair cut a bit shorter than he’d had it a few months ago, blue eyes kind as ever. Seeing them, he stopped with a blink and straightened; Harry felt Draco beside him, pulling to his full height as well, and did the same, all of them standing absurdly tall, like children at a physician’s office, about to be measured.
Draco kicks him impatiently and rolls his eyes. “Are you going to play?”
Harry turned to scan the room itself in case he’d missed Draco’s emergence. In expectation of the sweeping numbers the event had garnered last year, the Ministry had expanded the floor space to that of a proper ballroom, and — likely in response to the incidents with the Owls flying overhead — had covered the open skyline with a glass ceiling, charmed to magnify the starlight. Combined with the fairies fluttering their luminescent wings near the hors d'oeuvres tables and between the arches of the balconies surrounding the dance floor, an ethereal glow washed over the entire hall and all of its inhabitants. The effect was delicate and shimmering, inviting, and if Draco could see it, Harry had no doubt he’d be impressed — but the pompous arsehole
Finally, Harry clears his throat. “Okay, ah, let me just...” Using his body, he guides Draco’s torso in a twist, left then right. “Your sense of balance is good, and you hold your core muscles right, but—” The hand on Draco’s stomach slides to his ribcage, holds Draco in place with a featherlight touch. With his other hand, Harry grips the ball of Draco’s shoulder, rotates it, then runs his palm down Draco’s arm, making minute adjustments in the angle of Draco’s elbow relative to his flank, before ringing his fingers around Draco’s wrist. He notches his hips back just enough to allow for the pretence of respectability, and rests his chin on Draco’s shoulder. “Try it now.”
In an ideal world, there’d be a suitable compromise, or Harry’d be travelling with someone less… provoking. Then again, Malfoy’s always known just how to provoke him, and it's always, in one way or another, fuelled Harry's drive to be better. If he'd been tasked with escorting someone else, it's possible they'd both be dead right now.
That seems to be the convincing argument. Harry sluggishly climbs out of the tub and Draco grips his wrist to let himself be hauled up. He requires Harry’s help, one arm clinging to Harry’s shoulders, to step over the rim. He feels wobbly under Harry’s hands, water cascading off them, but he quickly steadies — enough that Harry isn’t too worried — once his feet are on the floor.
— and proceeded into the shop.
"Oh. Yeah. I… I saw some of your designs, actually. In your bag. Interesting," Potter says. It sounds like a genuine compliment, though he can't seem to help following it up with, "But for what it's worth, I don't think there's an Auror alive who'd prefer the Floo over Apparition. Too easy to get trapped in one without powder."
Narcissa had hoped to draw things out until Draco had arrived at Hogwarts, to maintain an element of surprise; there are a variety of ways she would be able to protect him in person beyond the single failsafe she’s managed to set in place. Failsafes are never infallible, after all, as Narcissa herself has been so recently and intimately reminded. Even if hers is rather good and would likely incentivise Granger as nothing else might.
of agreement, Draco rolled his head back to face the fire, one long leg stretched across the cushions and the other bent, foot flat on the floor. As Harry watched, he lifted his foot to toe off his Oxfords, one after the other, and then undid the top several buttons of his robes. He crossed his socked feet at the ankle, trousers hiking up a little.
Harry doesn’t quite manage to hide his flinch.
“Pansy Parkinson,” Parkinson said drolly.
Merlin to Christ. If only Draco would let him count the ways.
“One form, yeah.” A yawn catches Harry off-guard and he starts to fight it, but really, what’s the point? He leans into it, stretching his arms and spine, letting his jaw crack. His muscles tighten and relax, and when it’s over he feels better, but wearier. “I need to sleep. We both do. We can talk logistics in the morning.”
“We should go to sleep, then,” Draco says. “How far did we walk today? Twenty kilometres?”
Potter removes his glasses. He folds the legs and sets them aside. Then he takes a breath and reaches to unsnap the button of his jeans. Draco comes up onto his elbows in surprise. Potter’s jaw is hard as granite, his gaze intense on Draco’s face.
“Then you could have covered your tracks better,” Draco says after another sip, an edge of irritation in his voice when he adds, “or at least included me in whatever side investigation you had going.” He searches Harry’s face.
“Well, then.” Narcissa paused. “Today has been enlightening. Mr Potter, if I may have a moment to say farewell to my son in private? You have nothing to fear from me, I assure you.”
“You’re not.”
“I’m marked,” Draco says. Chokes. “I’ll always be marked.”
“I only had to make sure,” he snapped. He followed Potter, a Terrible Thing growing even bigger inside him when his next push against Potter’s chest didn’t land right, Potter grabbing his wrists and planting his feet stubbornly so he barely rocked back. “You got me the things the list said I wanted! You offered to let me touch your fucking
you—”
No one moved. Then Draco dipped his chin and, in the same tone Lucius had used, said, “Dad,” before turning to look at his mother. His Adam’s apple worked for a moment. “Mum.” The clutch of his hand was desperate in Harry’s own, bordering on painful — and then Draco unlinked their fingers and took a deep breath. “Harry has something to attend to upstairs, but I thought we could take lunch in here.”
Laugh lines, people call them, smile lines. It’s hard to believe there was ever a time Harry didn’t know how to laugh with Draco, or how to make him smile. The knowledge that, over the years, even certain things about Draco’s face have been shaped by Harry, feels unspeakably precious.
He had a way of speaking when he was invested, a gravity not unlike Mad Eye’s. He paid attention. He was committed, and he cared. It was what made him a good mentor, and what made Harry so determined to do him proud; he was trustworthy, paternal, and Harry had always taken heart from that.
Draco hesitated. “Harry—”
Potter. It’s—” Draco seems to lose steam there, a muscle in his jaw jumping. “It was different with you, okay? I didn’t loathe it, there was none of the friction I’d come to expect. With few exceptions, it’s mostly been, well. As you mentioned.” Irritated, he adds, “Which is probably why I bollocksed up the spell.”
“I thought—” Draco shrugged, face still too hot for him to turn around. “I thought, lead up to the best one in the middle, then work down.”
“Did you not hear the part about the permanent Sticking charm and the constant screaming insults she would hurl at anyone who walked past?”
Malfoy. Merlin, Harry can’t quite pinpoint the last time he saw him; it had to be over a year ago, and then only at a distance, in the halls of the Ministry. He’d not even known he and Malfoy were sharing the same country when Hell on Earth landed. Why is he here? What could Hermione possibly need him for?
And Draco can’t even argue with that. He can’t deny the way his muscles froze when confronted with that young woman, the memories that blinded him in the face of oncoming danger. It’s been bloody
“How d’you you think your mum’s family would feel, if they’d known how the house could open up for a half-blood?” Harry asked the night before Christmas. He was tired from the late hour and the day of preparations for their guests, but didn’t want to close his eyes yet. Intermittent flurries of snow drew his gaze outside the window.
Draco shrugs. The shoulder of his dressing gown slides a little to reveal what looks to be the strap of a bra. Unlike the unembellished knickers Harry saw when he sat down, the strap is decorated with tiny silver threading. Draco says, “I— suspected there was something deeper going on when you didn’t talk to me for a week after I got back from Paris. I didn’t… I wasn’t— I couldn’t be sure that it was… that, until we got here.” He swallows and attempts a smile. “I knew you’d like to shag me the second you started showing up in the papers with that Unspeakable.”
Harry blinked, disturbed without cause. What did he care if Malfoy wasn’t shaken by every stupid tumble they had?
He hadn’t known how to explain that all he wanted was to walk through the woods and to sit on their terrace, that he enjoyed the novelty of peace too much to look for anything he wanted to do more, yet.
Vibrating with the need to snatch her child away from this monster's arms, Hermione forces her arm down when Rose hiccups, sniffling, and raises her head. She looks to Narcissa first, trustingly, but when her gaze slides over to Hermione, it's unsure.
Harry startled and looked up. Malfoy, on his knees about thirty feet away, had stopped gathering moss to stare at a fallen branch — or whatever glinting thing was hidden beneath it. Dropping his handful of Leaping Toadstools into his basket, Harry stood up and went over, pulling his wand on the way. Malfoy stiffened but didn’t object as Harry levitated the branch away.
Harry had forgotten them entirely. Deliberately. “Doesn’t leprechaun gold vanish?”
“Potter, it’s a risk, investigating unknown magic.” Malfoy crossed his arms, his shirt slipping to the side again, trailing laces spread. “
To an elf’s magic, an order will always usurp a request.
She turns back to the mantlepiece; though so openly displaying that which you find most precious has always seemed imprudent to her, she's never been so ridiculous to refuse studying the inner-workings of someone else's heart, when given the opportunity. Of the photographs remaining, there’s a family portrait taken sometime in the last year that includes Harry Potter, one of the nightmarish Weasley sprawl, two infant photos, and one with a teenaged Granger standing before two people so drab they can only be her parents. None of it unexpected, other than the last: A picture Narcissa’s surprised not to recognise of Granger, Weasley, and Potter as children — perhaps thirteen years old. The newspapers must not be aware of its existence.
“Yeah.” Harry nodded. “The wandmaker’s cabinet had a set of books in it… I guess with the changing fashions and— how difficult it became to get some of the materials,” he said, “wand pommels went out of style in favour of the hilt sheath and other accessories. But they seemed dead useful, by all accounts, so I thought maybe you’d… I did modernise it, a little.” Its design in the middle had taken the longest, a delicate filigree mesh that he’d been been terrified making with every miniscule spiral of silver that dropped away, but Harry pointed to the sleeker, solid bands of silver on the edges, and the tiny gemstone studdings. “They usually have bottoms, but with the style of your wand, I thought—”
But he could potentially fix this, and other atrocities like it — and, in between, perhaps find a moment to exchange an Owl or two.
“He’s probably dead.” It’s sobering, an unwelcome reminder, but Malfoy says it unemotionally, though the ghost of an ironic smile still lingers on his face. “Mother, too. The magic on our lands, to say nothing of the magic in the wards around the Manor, is… strong. Strong and old. Enough to feed thousands of them for centuries to come. It will have attracted the Inferi from London.”
Somehow, Draco pried his tongue out of his throat to say, “Yeah. Uh, further, so you get your head wet. Then… get it wet.”
No compassion, Harry’s arse.
“Right.” Draco gulped. “Yeah.” Potter narrowed his eyes for a beat. He let go of Draco’s wrist and Draco resumed working the shampoo through his hair.
Malfoy slides the hand clinging to the outside of Harry’s thigh up and around his hip, grips Harry’s bobbing cock in a sure fist. And, okay,
“My favourite colour is a prettier green,” Draco said automatically, turning to look at him. Then he blushed and bit his lip, lifting his head to the ceiling once more — a charming tell that made Harry’s heart pound. “It’s the Lithuanian flag.”
“No, that was the one whose father was still frequently using him for Cruciatus practice when he thought Goyle wasn’t behaving enough like a man,” Draco said with a tightly-reined look of anger. Taken aback, Harry met his eyes, and Draco nodded, tensely. “He’s gone through a
“Very well, thank you; it is good to see you again. Please, call me Elena,” she said. She introduced him to her assistant and two lower members of MACUSA’s cabinet. Harry smiled pleasantly, shook hands, and offered them the use of his first name as Draco slid his finger down the indentation of Harry’s spine — a zip of magic, through layers of silk — and then paused his hand at the small of Harry’s back.
“Don’t be stupid,” Harry said, tucking his gloves in his back pocket. “
“I don’t know what to believe,” Draco said, flashing a furious look upward. He flinched and bent his head again, as though eye contact with Harry was painful, then blew out a slow, controlled breath and drizzled something warm onto Harry’s hand. “I spent most of my life readily believing something awful, and was willing to give up—” The trailing, misty pink magic flowing from the tip of Harry’s wand paused, then continued. “—anything else I might have longed for, because at the end of the war I was supposed to go on to better things. I’m a fucking Death Eater, Harry.”
7. Some ties that aren’t in green and silver, honestly. Though they do need to be silk.
Suddenly twitchy with nerves once they reached the little grove filled with mushrooms and moss, Harry set down his basket and looked at the bike, shiny and new, propped against that same tree. He licked his lips. “So, uh. Did you want—”
Still too disoriented to be offended, Draco considers. If what’s happening now is real, then that means what happened before was, too. He closes his eyes. “It’s been—”
he blurted. “Am I—?” His hand flew up in alarm and he ended up slapping himself in the face. Yelping, he gentled the investigation of his own blindness as he seemed to remember that he was wearing a mask. He patted it, found the elastic holding it in place, and stripped it from his head. His mouth dropped open.
he’d said, and he’d been right. This has the potential to be dangerous territory, depending on what Draco’s decided — if he’s decided anything, other than to avoid more emotional topics.
Harry recalls all of it suddenly, clearly: McGonagall's clipped brogue, his own embarrassment and fascination. A time-out from the hell of his sixth-year, from his obsession with—
Draco swayed, cheekbones splotched pink, breath coming in short, sharp pants. They were on the fringes of the crowd, the room bustling and alive around them, but they could have been alone for all it mattered. Harry shifted closer, tilted his head up to put his lips against the hinge of Draco’s jaw. Felt the shudder, unrepressed, rip through Draco’s lanky form — felt the telltale twitch of his cock through their robes.
“No,” Harry whispered, climbing back in bed, putting out the light. The box was cool in his palm, trifling, when only moments before, it had felt so important. “Sorry, I just had to get… go back to sleep.” Rethinking things, as Draco yawned and scrubbed at his eyes, silvery even in the shadows.
“Don’t pretend you don’t want it
“I know.” Draco looks at him with uncharacteristic patience — waiting for Harry, like he had on the desk, and maybe has been in other ways.
he thought at the intent he saw on Draco’s face as he advanced.
Trusting Draco was a gift Harry gave himself, and perhaps the most unlikely thing he’d ever done in his whole unlikely life. Ron and Hermione, self-deputised as Harry’s fiercest defenders, don’t understand it. But they don’t know the things about Draco that Harry does. Some of them, Harry gleaned through years of intense observation and absurdly accurate supposition: that he’s physically demonstrative but flinches when someone squeezes his right shoulder, because that was how his father used to indicate displeasure in public; that he wakes up at three-hour intervals because that’s how long his warding charms on his rooms at the Manor lasted when Voldemort was living there. Other things, Draco shared in casual asides, as though unaware of their deeply intimate nature:
Of course, I couldn’t say any of that. I shrugged instead. “I’m prioritising. You’re simply not worth the amount of time we spend together every week.”
smell a relief to Harry’s lungs. His hands find Harry’s hair, his tongue curls into Harry’s mouth. He laughs breathlessly against Harry and rolls his hips.
He found that if he acted quickly enough, before they reached for him, their bodies stayed dead. But more were coming, and he paused only long enough to shout, “Come
Ignoring the second warning noise Draco made, Harry twisted his head. “I meant we could choose not to care. But if you’ve got something to say, say it; don’t put me off by pretending you don’t want it.”
Harry takes a step back.
Malfoy blinked a flinch, a crease vanishing on his forehead almost as soon as it formed. “Sex is part of it, Potter.” Inhaling slowly, he slanted Harry a cocky smile and touched one of the mottled marks on his throat in a way that looked idle but that he’d probably practiced in front of a mirror, then let the brush of his fingers drop —  to his collarbone, down his bare chest, his fingers curling to a loose fist as he went. He rubbed his knuckles against the line of hair leading into his pants and smirked. “After all, you are my h—”
“This is good.”
“Well, we’re not in the same hurry we were last time,” Draco said, brow knitting when Goyle remained quiet. Harry glanced at him to find Goyle’s chin shaking, his lower lip trembling with it. Draco threw Harry a worried look, then said, “
again, and perhaps try
Pushing his melancholy aside with a breath, Harry tugs on a pair of socks and his boots, awkwardly ties the laces, then sits back and watches the weak seep of dawn through the tree cover. They got a late start yesterday, both still so exhausted from their abrupt departure and escape from Paris. To say nothing of the distance they’ve covered — at once a lot, for people who'd been trapped together for days, and nowhere near what Harry had hoped. He's not entirely unrealistic; any trained human body should be able to cross nearly fifty kilometres a day at a walk, and he knows that from experience. But he didn't account for how their level of injury and the general soreness they’d experience might force them to take it easy, even going until sundown each day, navigating slowly through the forest off the beaten path.

.” Harry waves a hand to cut off Malfoy’s question. Beyond a two-second communication to let Hermione know Malfoy was alive when he’d woken up the morning after he'd arrived at the hotel, and the friendly flare of warmth that indicated she’d got his message, they’ve been out of contact. Harry hurriedly glances at the door; they’re still silent in the halls. Waiting. He takes his wand and transmits,
And by that time, Potter had extricated himself from whichever random Ministry worker who’d waylaid him and was on his way over. Feeling as though he hadn’t blinked since he’d sat down, Draco strangled out a “No,” slipped from the booth, and strode to the Floo.
“Then you really—” Malfoy cut himself off, blinking. Slowly, he said, “The Manor has been occupied since it was first built, so there’d be no reason for it to Vanish any of its contents, whereas Grimmauld Place might simply have been conserving its magic until such a time as it was needed. Or, I don’t know, someone spelled it smaller a few generations ago, for reasons of their own.”
came first, it shouldn’t be a problem. Pulling out of their kiss, Draco looked down and watched the glistening slide of his fingers in and out of Potter’s hole, trying to pay attention. When they were about halfway out, Potter would give an extra little shudder, so Draco went searching, feeling for the—
’s to regain his attention. When he finally dragged his eyes away, Malfoy no longer seemed reasonable and calm so much as ready to slaughter Harry where he stood. Harry blinked. “What!”
A ripple of shock works its way down Harry’s spine. Settles in the pit of his stomach. The word ‘leverage’ from Hermione in reference to a human life — any life at all — is unfathomable. That it’s regarding Draco induces a sharp, gnawing pain in his chest, a visceral rejection of everything her warning implies. “Hermione, I—”
Potter stared at me. Smirked. Then he peeled my shirt off with a rather challenging glare and tossed it to the ground, and my breath exploded from my lungs.
“I would,” Draco says cautiously. Harry nods, resting his head against the pillow they share. Draco’s got no idea where the others went.
Harry’s laugh sounds pained and half-mad to his own ears. He shakes his head. “We won’t get to half of… that,” he says, fighting with the instinct to let his mind wander back into the picture they’ve painted for each other. He realises how cryptic that sounds and starts to clarify, but Draco’s already nodding.
“Yes. A forty-six, here.” Draco watches stupidly as Potter turns away before he heads to the cramped room. The lock on the door is the hook-and-eye sort, and he latches it before stripping down for the second time that day. One after another, he tries on the items and finds reason to be pleased he held his tongue — not only because everything fits, but because the clothing Potter’s picked is all of surprisingly good quality. The jacket is especially nice, the leather supple and worn, soft as velvet, the inside lined with real silk. He leaves on the second set of jeans, and shrugs out of the jacket to try on the last shirt, a cream-coloured thermal, when the doorknob suddenly twists. The lock rattles as Potter tries to tug the door open, and Draco drops the shirt, fumbling to unlock it.
Potter!” Draco said, trying not to picture Potter in a tube top. “Pansy’s been saying she’d figure out a way to get me to do this since the first day of term, and I
“I want one, too,” Harry told him. "Let's go."
Hermione tenses and checks the time. “We have four or five minutes,” she announces to everyone, “so we need to clear the room of all unnecessary personnel. Please gather your things.”
“We’ll probably have to have quite a bit to talk about, anyway,” Draco murmurs, hands straying to the buttons of his dove-grey shirt. “Why don’t you go find us something hot to drink.”
to think this was anything more than a curiosity or convenience?”
have a handle on is the meditation Harry tries to guide them in. It’s a good way to clear the mind, the sort of focus Harry’s relied on to get him out of tight spots in the last few weeks. Malfoy’s flexibility fares well enough, but he ends up fidgeting restlessly the entire time, head twitching in a tilt to one side as though he’s listening to something Harry can’t hear, lips pressed so tight his mouth goes white around the edges. Harry suspects it’s to do with Pansy, who rests on the balcony just beyond the door, and with the dreams that wake Malfoy up every few hours, his hand hunting for Harry’s presence in the dark across the expanse of the bed. Harry’s taken to rolling toward the middle of the mattress when that happens and hooking a foot around Malfoy’s ankle; the touch seems to settle Malfoy enough that he can get back to sleep faster. Sleep’s important, and Harry can’t be sure when they’ll again have the opportunity for a restful night, once they’re outside.
“Got it,” Malfoy clips out under his breath. He slips into the other chair and, after a quick look around for utensils, simply lifts the entire tin and brings it to his lips, and tips it back.
The sounds of the room grew muffled, and the whistle of a train nearing grew clearer. Harry held onto the hand in his, and rattled out a final breath, his vision fading white.
“We need to keep the meeting with Weasley brief,” Draco said.
No. Draco didn’t operate that way; there were some transgressions too big to apologise for, and he knew it. Knew that what mattered was the demonstration of regret, and considered anything said before that frivolity.
“And yet you’re so concerned with an innocent brush of my hand over your backside making the papers,” Draco said.
Harry let go a breath. “I think so, too. Thanks.” He paused, taken off-guard by the urge to apologise. If Malfoy was merely pretending decency, it was a good act on his part.  “About what I said downstairs, I’ve been—”
“Oh.” Harry looked at him. Swallowed. His body was slender, almost willowy, his small pink nipples beading tightly under Harry’s gaze. Harry’d seen him several times with an open shirt in the last week, but somehow the effect was different with Draco’s narrow, lean shoulders bare, with his Hippogriff scar exposed over the curve of his bicep to the edge of his collarbone.
“Merlin, can you imagine?” Ron asked. He scoffed. “Magic revitalisation is done wandless, you know, it’s a pretty rare talent, but having Malfoy’s hands on you,
“Where is it?” he asks, nodding when Harry points. He takes a breath. “Leave it, Potter.”
she would ask.
Draco looked a the parchment one last time. The list was horrible, truly horrible. He never thought he’d resent
This is how it should happen:
Draco flinches away from her voice. “It’s nothing,” he says again, hoarsely. He nods at Potter’s shoulder. “Lift your arm up with your other hand.”
Harry swallowed, pricked by the same cold point of terror he’d felt before. But fear of a name only ever increased fear of the thing itself, and he knew that better than anyone; it was a lesson that had served him well for ten years. He nodded at Draco and resumed cleaning his legs — letting it sit with him, letting reality sink in. He washed the crooks of Draco’s knees, down along the lean plumping of his calves.
The night Ron and Hermione were to come to dinner, Harry caught Draco tossing through his wardrobe with a stoic sort of indignation, and let him be. He waited in the study, at first reading a book on wandlore and legends, and then glancing to the staircase every five minutes, every three, every thirty seconds. Draco walked in at two minutes of six; he’d ultimately decided on a set of casual teal robes that set off the colour of his hair and flared from the hip to his knees, black boots and breeks underneath. He left the top buttons of his collar undone, a flap of material that drew Harry’s gaze, just to the right of his jaw, Draco’s entire presentation either a testament to how much he’d learned, or a point he was trying to make.
The landing is a bit clumsy, the broom losing stamina as Malfoy’s magic does, but Harry keeps them straight enough that they make it to the wall concealing wizarding Paris before their feet touch the ground. Harry pulls his wand even as the broom hits the cobblestone lifelessly, but with a sudden ice flooding his veins, he sees he doesn’t need it — the magic barrier between the wizarding and Muggle worlds has all but fallen, the streets of Paris flickering but visible through the brick. He lifts his hand to the wall; it ripples, then disappears entirely.
* * *
Malfoy considers. “At the very least, it’s shaded,” he says. He looks down when Harry extends an arm across Malfoy’s stomach to signal that Malfoy should stay behind him, Malfoy’s stomach muscles tensing against the back of Harry’s wrist. He’d tensed up all over when they’d come together too, his calves hooked around the back of Harry’s going firm and tight, his thighs gripping Harry’s hips, his hand moving frantically over their cocks. The memory of the moment throbs between them, as inconvenient and tempting as the new throb in Harry’s hardening cock.

Nodding wordlessly, Draco sets off through the meadow. Harry thinks once about warning him to watch for dangers lurking in the underbrush, but Draco steps carefully without being told, and after a moment Harry follows. They settle on the wall, the bags propped at their feet, and Draco says something that Harry doesn’t catch.
“Malfoy. Draco. Look at me.”
“No, just a bad person,” Potter said. Draco swallowed and got up to check the sauce again, exhaling slowly when Potter said, “Leave it alone, it smells right.”
“No,” Draco said. “Not yet.”
“Say it again,” Draco breathed. The grandfather clock chimed down the hall.
, Malfoy, went as far as finding a way in here to see if you were alive. And any plan I make
“You go ahead, then,” Harry snaps. Malfoy startles hard, recoiling away from Harry though they’ve got several feet between them, and Harry instantly regrets his tone. He puts his tin down with a thunk and rubs his forehead. “Sorry. I—” He sighs. “Cloud cover is a possibility, but it’s nearly as dark today, and I can hear them moving around outside.”
If anyone had ever told Harry that there’d come a day when he’d prefer spending time alone in a room with Pansy Parkinson and Draco Malfoy to walking down Diagon Alley, he’d have rushed them to the Janus Thickey ward of St Mungo’s. But against all laws of nature, once he’d spent some time observing the way Draco and Parkinson behaved with each other — a bit like Harry did with Hermione, only meaner — he was able to settle the disquieting streak that tore through him whenever they paired to show Harry a dance. By the third day, Parkinson had stopped scowling so hard when Draco swept Harry into his arms to demonstrate how to appropriately follow, and Harry even calmed down enough not to tread on the poofy, heavily ruffled skirts of the gowns and formal robes she wore — and he was almost (though not quite) able to concede that it was possible she might grow on him eventually.
Arrogant to the last and clearly prepared to hold anything Harry divulged over Harry’s head.
“Okay,” Potter said.
“You’re Harry
He knew Potter wasn’t going to be hurting for gifts come Christmas morning, but it didn’t seem quite the thing to not give someone a token
Full of polite excuses for why he couldn’t stay as Draco looked warily around at the crowd, he promptly forgot all of them upon being accosted by a very drunk Neville Longbottom, of all people. Longbottom rarely made direct eye-contact whenever he dropped off something at the labs from his greenhouses for Draco to use as a comparison sample, but on this occasion, his face lit up when he spotted Draco, and he cried out,
Draco heard a high, disbelieving laugh echo off the tiles and, disturbed, realised that it came from him. He slipped his wand from the pocket of his robes and aimed it under Potter’s chin, the tip stabbing into his skin. Potter stilled, chin coming up when Draco added pressure.
But it couldn’t happen there, or in any of the stops on their meandering trip. Draco liked to communicate in a roundabout fashion regarding certain matters, and Harry liked that he knew that about him. He recalled Draco’s insistence that night in the garden and thought about what it meant that he was taking Harry to his bedroom now, that he’d offered himself there time and again. Thought about what the
. Oh. Okay, yes, that was— fuck, it was
“Wait—” Potter’s brow furrowed and he grabbed the loose sleeve of my robes. He brooded silently for a moment. “What are you doing, Malfoy?”
Astonished, Harry loosens his hold. He takes the paper from Malfoy and looks down at it, sees Pansy’s cheerful, feminine handwriting: the note he preserved. “I—”
“I’ve been taking it as water imagined into coffee for weeks, so I don’t think that’ll be a problem.” Malfoy takes a step closer to the stove, gaze flicking over it. “This is brilliant. Why haven’t you broken it out before?”
“No. Yes,” Harry says, finding Draco’s rhythm, a languorous rock, and then: “
“And I did it so we could be free two weeks early,” Draco said.

Quidditch, flying in general, reading, collecting magazines of sweaty, half-dressed athletes and pretending I keep them under my bed because I like memorising sports trivia, ordering others around, being a complete prat to my friends who love me, anything Theo wrote about me on the fourth-floor bathroom loo stall, and cooking — though I'm not nearly as good as I tend to think myself and should stop forcing my concoctions on my friends, who will
I blinked at him, dizzy again in that way I couldn’t put a name to, frustration roaring through me like Fiendfyre. “No,
"Are you all right?" Draco asks. He creates more distance between them. Removes his hand from Harry’s hip.
Harry started, face flushing hot. It didn't sound like a jibe, but... He re-tied the laces of his dress shoes and stood, feeling more awkward than he had while picking out the damned clothes. “I never thought if you as the punning type.”
“What—” Draco gulped and shook his head. He darted a glance at Harry from the corner of his eye, and then did a double-take at his shirt. “Slytherin?”
,” Granger says. “The call, we need to disconnect, we don’t have much—”
“This will help,” Harry says. He glances at his watch, the clock, to the window, then back at the list. He can’t seem to sit still, his energy accumulating by the minute. Whether he’s been filled with adrenaline by their discussion or just obnoxiously excited to talk to his friends again, it’s starting to exhaust Draco just to look at him.
“I don’t—” Harry stops. Breathes. He’s had no practice asking for things, not really; he either gets them as recompense for following orders, or he doesn’t, and what he wants has never been much more than a carrot on a stick for the use of others. He opens his eyes. “I was. I have been. For more than… But I didn’t— I didn’t know it was the only chance you’d give me.”
“Yeah.” Ron peeled off his apron and sat down next to him, exhaling a sigh of pleasure. “Ukranian Ironbelly. Charlie’s reserve has been selling sheddings to me for a good price when they can’t use them. Usually the way they molt, you barely get pieces big enough for a pair of boots, maybe a jacket. But one of the dragons had an unexpected growth spurt at nearly fifty and when Charlie asked if I could use it, I jumped at the chance. I’ve got enough for something else, I think. Maybe a chair.”
“The, uh. She found out last minute that the Icelandic conference about magical people with latent Creature characteristics didn’t allow children under eleven.”
“Are you trying to say this—” Draco gestured between them, “—would have ever happened,
Remus said,
“That, I can do,” Harry said. Probably, anyway.
Harry put the back of his wrist in Draco’s hand, breath growing immediately unsteady at the small, dazzling shock that rippled through him when Draco’s fingers closed around it, his thumb resting over Harry’s pulse. Draco took another step in, their chests nearly touching, and lifted his other hand to Harry’s cheek. Harry closed his eyes.
“How long,” Draco got out, nearly soundless, “did it take you to wonder if I was telling the truth? When I sent—”
That Malfoy would toy with Harry’s personal life after being allowed into it on some level— It was something Harry would have expected from the Malfoy of ten years ago, not the one standing before him looking strangely wilted in his ill-fitting pyjamas. It had come as a blow.
“Are you

been able to do what Harry does, not with the same level of commitment. He certainly can’t now, still overheated from waking up so close. Still wedged into his own bit of shock. Prone as he's ever been to obsessing over that which he can't control, the effort it’s taken all night to file away his feelings has been… extensive. A loop of repression whenever he and Harry touched, and when Harry said anything, and when Draco opened his eyes just before sleep to find Harry’s gaze resting on him, almost curiously.
Potter shook his head. He shifted, rising higher onto his knees, and licked his way up the soft trail of hair on my stomach, then twisted his head and pressed his cheek to it, tongue darting out to drag warm and slippery along the vein running up the side of my cock. It jerked and Potter hummed, glancing at me once more; he skimmed his open lips over the head and pressed the tip of his tongue to the slit.
, caught in the gale force of it all, his wand willingly laid aside for the chance to find respite in the wreckage.
Harry wasn’t certain. It was a good goal to reach for, and Draco was saying all the right things, but something still felt… off. They argued; that was what they
not on speaker, am I?”
Instinct tempted him to slump over Malfoy when it was over; the return of clarity made him push away and pull his pants and jeans up. His glimpse of Malfoy was mortifying, fascinating, Malfoy’s shirt shoved ‘round the back of his neck, his trousers unlaced and down around his thighs. His cock was pretty, even sticky and softening, long and pink and left immodestly
“Tomorrow,” Malfoy breathed, hips juddering briefly when Harry gripped one, then stilling. Harry pulled on the drawstring of his bottoms, untied it. Malfoy inhaled. “Halloween. Potter, do you—?”
“Okay.” Something unpleasant twists in Draco’s midsection, a matter to be thought on later. He nods. “Okay, Potter. I’ll follow your lead.”
“Yes.”
Suddenly Harry’s heart is more exhausted than the rest of his body. He rubs his chest with the heel of his hand. “Yeah. She should have left him with you.”
Dinner was tense. Draco was arch but distant with Blaise and Pansy, politely detached with Ron and Hermione, and actively cool towards Harry when he wasn’t busy being snide. He looked beautiful and untouchable in the Versace Harry had given him, a slim-fit suit in royal blue, and blue-and-black patterned tie. He toyed lazily with the tie over dinner, stroking over the silk and smirking as if to remind Harry of the game they’d played with it that very morning, and instead of saying
“Well.” Draco licked his lips, a small scowl resting between his eyes for a beat. “Whether or not our names are linked on the tapestry, Grimmauld Place isn’t likely to forget who I am to— it.” The hint of of uncertainty in his voice, of question, tugged at Harry’s heart.
“What?” Harry mumbled, smiling. All of it more simple than he'd given them credit for. He grazed the side of Draco’s neck with another kiss. “It’s Saturday. And Christmas. Happy Christmas.”
He closed the door.
He stands in the middle of the room for a moment, confusion on his face, his chest heaving. He shakes his head. His voice is raw with unshed tears. The link, chaotic with emotion, closes so hard Draco practically hears it slam. Untangled from it, Draco shudders, gripping the edge of the desk, as the sensations of his own body blare hot without Harry's feelings in the way to buffer them: the bruising ache around his wrists, the strain in his jaw, the flutter of distress in his stomach at seeing Harry so lost. Harry's throat works. “No, I—”
Harry swallows, standing. Not letting himself think about it, he smooths out the note on the counter and carefully folds it, then tucks it into his back pocket. His reflection stares back at him for a moment, dark-jawed and dead-eyed, until Harry lowers his gaze. Shaking it off, Harry checks the taps, frowning when the small drizzle of water that appears immediately slows into a drip. It’s really no wonder; the remaining electricity grids unaffected by the EMP-like pulse on that first night finally failed over a week ago, the water grids a few days after, and wizarding hotels tend to rely too much on magic for their lighting and plumbing. Harry’s just glad they took the precaution of putting muggle locks on the rooms. He twists the taps off and turns to lift the toilet seat, then drops it closed at the harsh, ammonia odour that wafts up.
It was like last time, and not at all; the sensation of arousal coursing through Harry didn’t come as a surprise, but as a sweet, exhaustive relief, sweeping away the cobwebs of rage and sadness that choked the flow of his magic. Draco’s hand trembled on his cheek, and Harry brought up his own to cover it, tilting into the press of Draco’s palm — little stings, sharp and needling like the bristle of Draco’s magic, a whisk of something
” Fearful said. Its scales rippled, down to its pointed tail. “
Harry closes his eyes, replaying it on a loop, the moment he understood what Ron was about, all of that joy spread out around him like the fulfillment of a wish he’d made as a child: having people to make laugh, and to laugh with. Feeling like things might really be okay.
Robards smiled — the same warm, jovial smile he’d used on Harry for years. But his eyes were hollow. With the gentleness of an assassin, he said, “Magic doesn’t play into everything, Harry. Chosen One or not, in the end you’re just another fatherless boy seeking the approval of a new one.”
“I don’t know how to put a tie on someone else.”
“I fuck around,” Harry says. “Yeah.” It’s true. Not as often as he used to, but for the necessary release, in place of lashing out to destroy everything they’ve built and what he can’t have. Harry doesn’t think he pretends to be much of anything he isn’t but, eerily calm, acknowledges that Draco’s perception of him can be unnervingly spot-on at times, so he doesn’t object to the accusation.
“Fine, what?” Draco asked, narrowing his eyes.
“Sorry, okay? I’ve been pulling overtime — I don’t always, but two of the Aurors were out with the flu — and I haven’t been sleeping much,” he said. “I really just didn’t… think before sending the Owl. I barely had time to send Gringotts an authorisation for sending you my cancellation fee this afternoon.” He yawned widely and headed back to the sofa. “I fell asleep not two minutes after writing your Owl.”
Even if Harry manages to get through to his friends, Draco is the one out here, in the thick of it with him. Before the siege, Harry’s circle of friends had grown to include other Aurors, people from the Ministry, dates with whom friendship rather than romance had bloomed. But like it’s been with Ron and Hermione since the war, there will never be another person from this catastrophe who understands Harry as much as Draco might, if Harry lets him.
Draco kissed Potter when it was over, tasting his own spunk as he wanked Potter off with long, twisting pulls from root to tip. He had
One eye on the doors, he Shrinks down as much of it as he can fit into his pack, leaving a little space near the top for anything else he might need. It turns out to be a good call, because a minute later he comes across a section that seems to be devoted to outdoor activities. It has torches and more batteries, camp stoves — oh, god, to be able to eat something
nerve-wracking; it’s never been less than five hundred before. Harry nods and takes the boots from Malfoy, sitting in the chair and putting them on blindly as new symbols form.

Her hair was up in a wispy coil at the nape of her neck. Harry’s heart clenched as he spotted the freckle behind her ear Draco had mentioned. And Draco’s, partially hidden by his starched shirt collar but visible
And Draco’s head banged back against the mirror, one of his long legs curling to hold Harry about the waist, muttering, “Don’tstopdon’tstopdon’tstop,” as he came too, his cheeks copper with exertion. He lifted up against Harry and stroked his cock in a tight hand, come shooting over his fingers and belly, the flex of him around Harry better than anything he’d ever felt, and then he slumped back with a deep exhale, muscle tension vanishing but for a tiny aftershock that rippled through him all the way to Harry’s spine.
,” Harry gasped, tears starting to seep from his eyes, “and a cat wearing a baby’s nappy, why is it in a baby’s nappy, please, explain the nappy—”
It wasn’t that Harry was a prude. It may have been a while since Harry’d got to give or get anything beyond a quick rub or blowjob on one of his half-days, but he liked sex as much as any bloke. He even had a toy or two of his own, hidden in the back of his bedside table. But they’d been bought at a Muggle establishment, far from those who were foaming at the mouth to make his private life public. And though he’d known that this section off Diagon tended to cater to a more discreet sort of shopper, it hadn’t occurred to Harry for a moment that he might need to be one.
“Right, so what the fuck— Oh.” Draco stared into the fire. Maybe if he stuck his head into it and called out two different addresses, it could Splinch his brain. “Oh. Shit.”
Draco sucks in a breath. Harry’s eyes are glinting, his gaze sharp and curious. He’s close enough that Draco can smell — can practically taste — the now-familiar salty sheen of sweat on his neck. Draco closes his eyes and blindly finds Harry’s waistband with one hand. He curls his fingers into it, his knuckles pressing over the silky line of hair trailing down Harry’s stomach.
“People won’t like it,” Draco said flatly.
“Yeah. That message Hermione sent?” Potter asks, indicating his jacket on the beach. “I’ve got it in my pocket. It included a series of numbers, and I can’t figure out what they mean. Hermione made sure I'd know we'll need some of the beads for them, only they don’t match with any coordinates on the maps. But I’ve been thinking: doesn’t the Department of Mysteries encode a lot of their information with numbers?”
,” Harry says. “I’m going to write them a letter telling them that I am Harry Potter, and that I’m prepared to use every ounce of power and influence at my fingertips to close their doors permanently if they don’t make an immediate retraction and apologise for their harassment. I think, because we’ve left it so long, they’ve let themselves forget what I can do.”
Colours around her blur, the world going terrifyingly soft-edged. The solitude she was so grateful for only minutes ago, a rare moment to herself during which there was no emergency to tend, now chills her to the bone, and she can’t— she can’t
“I promise,” she told him breathlessly, new tears streaking down her cheeks as she pulled him to her. And then his mouth was on hers again, his hands stroking her hair free of its pins, his body covering hers, warm and heavy. He made love to her on the floor of the attic, the air musty and somehow alive around them as she reached to undo his trousers with trembling fingers and he hiked up her robes around her waist, spreading her slender thighs with one hand and fitting his hips between them.
There’s a thoughtful silence before Draco comes down to the pillow of his jacket, tucking his hand under his cheek. He says, “Tell me what we’ll be looking for.”
, you do,” fiercely, as though it’s the only thing he knows.
“Yeah.” This is when they normally go to sleep, but the thought nagging at Harry for the last hour comes back, and he debates whether or not to say anything.
“Yes, well.” Malfoy finishes off his peas and reaches for the crackers. Taking the larger portion, he flicks his fingers dismissively at the rest. “Those are yours.”
“—lo? Harry?” It’s Granger.
“Yeah.” Draco licked his lips and made himself focus. “Tell me something.”

“Fine.” Granger’s stares at her, but she’s more alert than she has been since Narcissa arrived, at last paying attention. “Then explain why any of it matters.”
“Yes,” Harry said eagerly, guiding Malfoy’s head back to the pillow — leaving his hand under it, cradling. Malfoy’s hair was damp and soft. His fever had broken. “Yeah, I think it must’ve been. Your mum sent a potion.”
"If my parents had come today—” He broke off with a grimace and shook his head, gaze dropping. A tinge of pink coloured his cheeks, his thighs tensing under Harry’s hands. Self-conscious, Harry started to pull away, but Draco moved too fast, snapping the coil of his fingers around each of Harry’s wrists to keep his hands where they were. He took a long, unsteady breath, then lifted his eyes back to Harry — intent, sharp. “What did Bill say?"

him. Harry can feel Malfoy's long, lean thighs against the backs of his, the outline of Malfoy's soft prick against the cleft of his arse. Malfoy pushes against his stomach, straightening Harry’s spine, and Harry’s breath catches as his erection is brushed with a bony wrist.
“Yeah. Anyway,” Harry moved along Draco’s jaw, surprised to feel some stubble there, “he drank after Azkaban. Too much sometimes, probably. And sometimes I think he loved me because he thought I was my dad. I mean, I know that’s not true, but— maybe it also was, a little. And, god, I still loved him so much.” He blew out a breath and nudged Draco’s chin with a crooked knuckle. Draco silently turned his head, and Harry bent over the hives laddering the side of his neck. “Snape was horrible to me and even though he, you know, was helping the whole time, I think he meant it.”
Draco slices the air with Harry’s machete, in automatic rejection of Harry’s criticism. “No, I don’t.”
“What the hell did you do to that shirt?” Blaise asked.
“Muggles, I think,” Potter whispers. His back is a hard line of tension against Draco, from the nape of his neck to the curve of his buttocks. His knuckles are white. “I hope.”
” Harry stalked up to Pansy and handed over Draco’s letter. She took it with a single, arched brow, a familiar mask of polite derision. It was the same one Draco wore so frequently, Harry felt like he’d just swallowed a whole bottle of Polyjuice — his insides slimy and squirming alive, his skin stretching too tight.

“It wasn’t my favourite exchange, but I’ve been accused of worse.” Draco’s eyes locked to his. “Things I have been guilty of.”
“Where did you get your scar?” he asked Draco before bed — touching it without thinking, pulling away — because he couldn’t ask what was wrong.
“You and me, both,” Blaise said with a sleepy glare. “The next time you wake me up over Potter, I will be having an extra conversation with number twelve before he’s gone,” he added, and again, shut his Floo in Draco’s face. Blaise made a habit of keeping interactions with his stepfathers to a minimum — engagement parties, weddings, the congratulatory dinner parties he threw post-honeymoons, and his twice-yearly visits to his mother’s house — for however long they lasted until their inevitable demises, so it was a good threat. Though Nova’s fondness for Draco kept him (probably) safe from her machinations, her husbands always went overboard trying to accommodate Blaise if and when he ever asked them for something. And since Draco was pretty sure that Nova would be inheriting a cartel of assassins this time along with her usual several vaults of gold, Draco refrained from giving in to the spiteful urge to ring Blaise every thirty minutes for the rest of the night and quietly retreated to bed.
