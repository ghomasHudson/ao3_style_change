"You sound just like him, it's kind of hot" Blaise whispered back licking his lips. Harry cringed and raised his hand. "Yes Mr.Potter?" Flitwick looked at him. "Professor may I use the restroom?" Harry brought his hand down. Flitwick nodded and Harry got up.
"Thank you both for forgiving me. I feel terrible about how I acted. Neville seems to be it for me. He's an amazing guy seriously." Blaise was rambling on about Neville. Draco and Harry were both just sitting and listening.
"Well yes I cannot share a bathroom with this git he will take up all the tim-" Draco was cut off by Harry "No sir there is not problem thank you for taking time to show us to our room I believe we can take it from here"
Draco chuckled and sat up rubbing his eyes.
He curled up into a ball and drifted off into sleep. He would rather be asleep then awake and having to think about all of the awful things that Harry could be experiencing in this very moment.
"Oh well..well...I'm..maybe" Neville shrugged and began getting nervous again. "I've dated him, you'd be lucky to have him. Not as lucky as you would be if you got this one though" Draco smiled and laid his head on Harry's shoulder. Neville smiled in awe. "I hope I can have what you two do." Neville said.
Harry followed and stood in front of Dumbledore waiting for him to address Draco and himself. "Ah my two head boys" Dumbledore simply smiled down at them. "I know this is hard considering you two have been mortal enemies since first year."
“I wouldn’t call them fun,” Harry replied with a small smile. “Do you and Malfoy coordinate greetings?” he asked after a moment.
He eventually dragged himself out of the bath and shared a light dinner with Soup before turning in early. He mentioned Pansy would be coming around for breakfast and wasn’t surprised in the least to hear Soup mention having just acquired a jar Pansy’s favourite jam and cherries.
on the cigarette bud and looked up. “We can still hang out.”
“I have to get all the proper Muggle papers,” she answered. “Draco, do you have a beer or something? I am about to lose my mind, and I’m not doing it sober.”
“Hello, buddy,” Draco took the cat in his arms and scratched it behind the ears. “Got caught in the rain, huh?”
“I’ll find out anyway!”
“I’d bet anything the House-elves tracked me down,” Draco said in an irritated voice. “I hate it when he takes me by surprise. It always gets to me.”
Harry tried hard not to laugh. Fortunately for him, somebody knocked on the door. Draco immediately pulled a sheet on the two of them.
“Well, I don’t,” I replied firmly.
“Payment in advance,” I said, making a last attempt to get rid of him.
“Okay,” I dragged out. “So we have to find a place to Apparate from?”
“Um,” Harry hesitated a bit and turned around just in time to see a black guy wearing high heels hit the stage. “Can I chip in for the singer instead?”
“Really? This is wonderful!” Narcissa seemed genuinely happy and her contagious smile caused me to grin in reply. “Everything’s calm over here. It’s been a week since we had a rough night.”
“It’s disgrace. They want me to fake a straight life, whatever it costs. And I won’t.”
“No, didn’t have the time. What about you?”
“Copycat.”
“Fine,” he shrugged indifferently and pulled out his wallet. He counted out thirty golden coins and piled them up on the decorative table in the hallway. “I’ll move in in an hour.”
“I haven’t used a computer since I was fourteen, I guess,” Harry said. “Well, then I’ll search for the non-binary thing. Unless you want to explain that as well.”
“Well, I come from a pureblood family. Not rich like the Malfoys, but… Never mind. I guess I’m mistaken.”
She was still not at her ease, so Malfoy nodded shortly.
Malfoy threw his head back and exhaled slowly, letting the smoke out of his mouth. The tattoo on his neck – a wonderfully drawn sea landscape – moved with a gust of wind, and Harry was so impressed he almost stopped breathing. Malfoy noticed this and smiled.
“Yep.”
“Hi,” I said.
“I should ask you the same question!” Mr. Malfoy hissed. “What are you doing in this gutter? This is not a suitable place for you. I have told you multiple times that you should come back to the Manor!”
I have to gather the remains of my forces to explain you – again – that Dumbledore isn’t a scumbag, we have already discussed this. He has his reasons. I am tired of explaining, really. And you drag me to the Hospital Wing, giving me reproachful looks every five seconds, and when we’re there, you knock loudly and run away – no one can see us together, otherwise it’s all in vain.
, so she hasn’t seen us yet.
“I guess I’ve heard more Muggle music in ten days then in the ten previous years,” Harry said and took a sip from his glass.
“You are an Auror, aren’t you?”
“Damn, Harry, give me some space!” Ron exclaims, pushing me.
“No problem,” I replied. Harper gave me a weird look and was off before I had the time to figure out what it meant. I frowned, but decided not to give it too much thought: I had to write a detailed report on the case of Alan Mann, our freshly arrested thief.
“I will not let you insult my friends in my presence.”
“I thought you dated Parkinson when we were fourteen.”
“Hey, do you happen to have another cigarette?” he asked, without bothering to introduce himself.
They sat in silence for a minute or so, and this time it felt natural. Harry wanted to ask Malfoy how he managed to convince his family that the life he had chosen for himself was worth it, but it seemed to be an intimate topic, so Harry kept the question to himself.
Hermione took out her wand and transfigured the bottles into wine glasses.
“First: don’t leave your stuff all over the place,” I eyed the pack of the floor, “second: mind your own business.”
“This is a standard operation, Mr. Potter,” Emmet responded as he made a gesture to the other Aurors to back off. “These people are troublemakers…”
“We can go home,” Finn suggested, but Annalise shrugged.
“I wouldn’t mind another game,” she said.
“It’s a Muggle neighbourhood,” he reminded, but I still didn’t understand, so he added: “We only use magic if necessary. Besides, if we never leave the house, it’ll be suspicious. And the neighbours here are nosy, believe me.”
“I still don’t get it,” Ron admitted. “I mean they are nice and all, but why exactly are you hanging out with Malfoy and his friends?”
“What about them?”
“This bar is perfectly legal,” she said. “I have told you this at least four times this year. Stop terrorizing my clients, or I will file another complaint.”
“Yes,” I didn’t appreciate the official tone. Did he come here as an Auror? The last thing I needed was a problem with the Auror office. They must have found out that I’d erased some of the neighbours’ memories… I had already come up with at least five excuses when Potter said:
“What are you doing here?” I asked, not even trying to sound polite.
Fifteen minutes later Malfoy and I, fully dressed and ready to go to work, went out on the porch.
“I am going to see him today.”
“Thirty galleons a month.”
“I hope this wasn’t too painful,” Malfoy smirked. “Is your pride okay?”
“Tony’s non-binary,” he explained, but Harry still didn’t get it.
I live during the game against Slytherin. What choice do I have? You’re glaring at me from across the pitch while I am just keeping my word and not giving in. I live when I feel your shoulder as you’re flying next to me, and this moment is important to you because you’re so close to winning, and to me – because you’re here. I will catch the damn Snitch anyway, and you will most definitely hold a grudge for the next week or so and curse me in the gloom of the night corridors.
“I hope you remember about your shift,” Harry recognized Iris’s voice. “I’m not paying your part of the rent if you get fired again.”
“You don’t know?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
As he spoke, Draco put on a black t-shirt and a pair of jeans, grabbed the birth certificate from the desk and handed it to Harry.
“I’m not in the mood to stay any longer,” said Annalise. Finn put his arm around her, as she was methodically squashing what was left of her cigarette against the stone fountain - they were sitting there since the Aurors were gone.
“I’m gay, Harry. Do you know what it means to a pureblood family when their only heir is gay?”
makes sense,” I couldn’t help myself but continue to nag him.
It took a moment until they were settled, mugs in hand, but then she gave him her full attention, intense as that always was. “How, specifically, are you fucking things up?”
Draco nibbled at him again, experimental this time, and Harry threw caution to the wind in his haste and his need, damn near launching himself forward to chase Draco’s lips and teeth down into the pillows, propping himself up over Draco’s body, aligning them closer than they’d been during their violent fight just days before.
“Sometimes what?” Harry asked, and Ron shot a look at Hermione, then him.
Harry took his hand.
Harry groaned and sat down on the bed, setting the bag of papers and potions beside him. His hair was still wet. “For fuck’s sake. I was worried about you, you prick.”
“This
Quite the opposite.
Harry reached for Draco’s mug, and Draco actually handed it to him, tapping it with his wand to reheat the contents before he turned back to the screen. They finished watching the movie in silence — well, Draco did, barring his occasional chuckle. Harry mostly watched Draco, warm in the contentedness that he felt here, watching old films and watching Draco watch them too. Sharing tea, the sofa, and the home itself. He could almost imagine that the circumstances were different, that this was his life, with no extra complications.
The first thing he did was send away for supplies. It took two days for everything to be delivered, and another day for him to find where the postman had left his packages. He finally found them at the back edge of the lawn, a good twenty-minute hike from the house but apparently as close as the wards would let Muggles get. He shrunk everything down, dried the dew off, and set to work.
They traced their normal paths, zigging and zagging the entire way. Draco had shown Harry how throwing a Bludger at the manor would make the manor shoot it right back, and they ran drills for the better part of an hour. Draco seemed stronger now. He tried a Woollongong Shimmy and a near-perfect Sloth Grip Roll, flying with a fervor that Harry hadn’t seen from him in years. He was panting when they touched down, his hair stuck all over his forehead like he’d just gotten fringe. Harry smirked, but refrained from saying anything, since his own hair was likely worse.
here, in a way even Hogwarts was too practical to be. Hogwarts functioned as a school, where the Manor functioned as a seat of wealth and blooded power. Harry felt right there, more in tune with that strange magical part of himself. No one could grow up here without knowing they were a wizard - unlike Little Whinging.
It had started getting dark while they watched the movie, and they emerged into a cooling world, brushed with elongated shadows. More people were on the street now, heading home from their jobs to their families, and they crowds pushed them a little closer together as they went down the street, both lost in thought. Harry wanted to hold Draco’s hand again, but the dark of the theater and the swell of Casablanca’s score were gone. Instead he held tight to their bag of goodies and tried to see things through Draco’s eyes. He must have be exhausted, taking it all in, but he hadn’t said anything about going home yet.
Draco went first. "Harry, I knew from the moment you walked into Hogwarts you were something special. It wasn't that you were 'golden boy'. It's that you were so shy, so reserved and timid. Yet so fiery and fierce.  I tried to deny the way I felt about you for years and I hated every second of it. Now I'm lucky enough to stand before you and marry you. Harry you are my forever, you are my home. You are the one and only love of my life." Draco finished speaking, his voice breaking a tiny bit towards the end. Harry was in full blown tears, crying with a smile plastered on his face.
Harry swiftly removed Draco's robe and began unbuttoning his shirt. Draco picked Harry up and smashed his soft lips onto Harry's. Harry moaned slightly with satisfaction. Draco carried Harry into his bedroom, never once breaking the contact between their lips. Draco shut the door behind them.
"But I wanted to save myself for our wedding night." Harry said sarcastically. Draco smirked and chuckled. "Right" Draco rolled his eyes and reconnected their lips. Harry smirked and ran his hands down Draco's bare chest.
Harry rolled on top of Draco and kissed his chin. "Wake up darling" Harry cooed. Draco grumbled and turned over with Harry, pulling him back into his arms. Harry smiled and pecked the tip of Draco's nose. "It's Christmas darling" Harry said softly as he caressed Draco's cheek.
"Draco would you like to come up here and say a few words?" Dumbledore looked down at Draco. Dumbledore winked at Draco, letting him know this was his chance to fix his errors. Draco looked around and gulped. He took a deep breath. Harry would want him to, Harry would encourage him to. Draco nodded and got up. He made his way to the front of the hall looking forwards and standing tall. Once he had arrived at the front Dumbledore moved away and gestured for Draco to step in his place at the podium.
Harry shrugged and took his school robe off. "I don't wanna go anywhere" He said and walked over to his bedroom. Draco followed. "But are you hungry?" Draco caught himself. "I mean not that I care or anything" He said crossing his arms. "Right" Harry rolled his eyes. Draco smiled a little but wiped it off his face.
The train came to a halt at Hogwarts. They had finally arrived. Harry couldn't be more excited to get into his new dorm. Considering he was head boy his dorm would be larger but also smaller with just two bedrooms, one common room, and a study. Harry liked the thought of having his own quarters. Not having to share with anyone. The only thing nagging at him was the question of  'Who is head girl?'
"Oh I wouldn't want to be a trouble to her" Hermione said shaking her head. "It would be no trouble." Draco said.
Harry tried to look at Draco's eyes but couldn't. "I'm not nervous.." Harry bit his tongue. "Really so.." Draco moved closer to him "This doesn't bother you then right?" Draco was just as nervous as Harry was.
The feast was over and students started filing out of the Great Hall. Harry was on his way out with Hermione and Ron when he heard his name called as well as Draco's. "Oh well I guess this is it." Harry said pulling his friends into a hug "I will see you both everyday for meals and in our classes so this shouldn't be that bad right" Harry smiled sadly while pulling away from the warm welcoming embrace "Yeah of course mate" Ron smiled the same smile Harry had on.
"You're no fun" she huffed and whined. "Well if you must know, the other boy, Blaise, pulled out his wand and said a spell with an S, stupidy, stoopily..." Myrtle was trying to remember the spell.
"Yes, just stood up too fast is all." Harry smiled and looked around for his shoes. "Where are my shoes" Harry kneeled down to look under the bed. Draco walked to the opposite side of the bed and picked them up. "Right here" Draco set them down in front of Harry. Harry smiled and slid them on.
"Harry!" Draco yelled as he watched Harry hit the floor. Once the green light made contact with Harry's chest, his life left his body.
"I wish I could've heard your magical speech" Harry chuckled and got up. Draco got up and hugged Harry from behind. "It truly was magical, I think even I saw Crabbe and Goyle drooling over it" Draco chuckled and kissed Harry's cheek.
Draco got up and crept over to his door. He opened it and made his way over to Harry's door. He pressed his ear against the cold door which reacted with a shiver through his body. He couldn't hear much other then what sounded like Harry messing with the covers.
"Oh yeah why's that?" Ron said and got up, going to the couch taking Hermione with him. "He's always been outgoing and really not giving a shit" Draco said and poured himself a glass of water. Harry took it and took a sip. "Darling, if you wanted one you could've just asked" Draco chuckled and poured another glass.
"A favor? Are you crazy? You poisoned him pyscho." Draco got defensive once more. He put on a very tough exterior when he got defensive.
"Are you ok?" Hermione watched him sit down on the couch like an old man. "Yep yes I'm fine" Harry nodded and Draco sat on the fluffy white rug.
"Dudley please go tell that thing he should stay away from me for the rest of the night..and he won't be eating tonight"
Everything began moving in slow motion for Draco. His fight or flight instinct immediately kicking in. Draco backed up and wrapped his arms around Harry, keeping Harry behind him. Harry held Draco's arms. "I love you" Harry whispered into Draco's ear. Draco looked back at Harry with tears in his eyes.
Harrys eyes looked up to meet Draco's. Harry shot up from his bed, he basically jumped on Draco, mumbling "Thank merlin" Draco was confused. He felt like he should push Harry away.
Harry stopped him. "No darling, I have awful morning breath. I don't want to accidentally kill you" Harry chuckled. Draco shook his head and rolled his eyes. "I don't care" Draco kissed Harry softly.  A good morning kiss.
Harry hurriedly walked to the bathroom. Everything about that situation mads him uncomfortable. He really wished Draco had been there. Harry ruffled his hair and put his hands on the sink letting his head droop. The situation reminded him of his uncle. He wanted to breakdown and cry.
They had beautiful tents set up, there was a large tent for the reception. Two smaller tents for Harry and Draco to wait in.
"Well people who don't have a true interest in you will not even care what your middle name is. They may ask your favorite color or food, but middle name is a different kind of interest" She shrugged.
Within the next thirty minutes the water had cooled and the bubbles had disappeared. "It's time to get out love" Draco said, standing up out of the tub. Harry sighed and got up as well. Draco drained the tub and put his clothes back on.
"I love you" Draco mumbled down to Harry, he was crying again.
Harry was hungrily kissing Draco. Draco was in control, he kept the pace slow. Harry felt Draco's stern chest against his own. Draco's arms around Harry's tiny waist. Harry had felt every time Draco's thumb would caress his hip, or the back of his neck. These things made Harry weak in the knees.
Draco ran over to her and Harry. Draco was distracted and thrown off by the sight of both of them. He pulled both of them in for a tight warm embrace. "I missed you mum" He mumbled. She smiled. "Harry you're alive" He smiled and kissed Harry. Draco didn't care who was watching, he needed to kiss Harry. He needed to make sure Harry was really there. Narcissa watched in awe. She couldn't be more relieved Draco had found someone good for him. Unlike herself, Draco had found stability and safety.
Harry relaxed finally. Draco didn't understand what had just happened or why Harry had a blade, all he could think about was making Harry forget. Draco pulled away when he felt Harry relax and Harry began to speak."I- I'm sorry I was just-"
"You should be Potter, now go back to sleep I'm tired" Draco said yawning and slowly drifting off to sleep. Now it was Harry's turn to admire Draco. Harry looked up at Draco being careful not to move too much. He felt himself smile slowly as he saw Draco there. Draco's soft pale face. Draco Lucius Malfoy was holding him."Would you mind staring at me another time, I'd rather be awake to know that the wondrous Harry Potter was creepily staring at me" Draco chuckled softly and kept his eyes shut.
Draco knocked softly. "You may come in" Harry said sounding like he thought he was royalty. It made Draco chuckle as he opened the door. "Miss me too much Malfoy?" Harry said smiling innocently. "Yeah right Potter" Draco smirked and rolled his eyes. Draco leaned against Harry's doorframe.
Ron and Hermione were standing there smiling. Harry had completely forgotten he was on Draco's lap. "How long have you two been standing there?" Draco said. "Not long, just enough time to see you blokes getting lost in each other's eyes" Ron chuckled. Hermione chuckled as well. "We just came to see if you guys wanted to hang out or something" Ron said staring at them. Harry smiled. "Me included?" Draco said softly. "Yes you included prat" Ron said.
Harry turned over in Draco's arms and nestled his face into Draco's chest. Draco looked down and smiled. He sighed and closed his eyes attempting to sleep. He would need energy for the day he had subconsciously planned for the two of them.
Harry and Draco stood side by side facing the evil man who stood in front of them. "If anything happens look in the very back of my wardrobe ok?" Harry said, shaky voice and all. "Don't talk like that nothing will happen. I love you" Draco replied, tears running down his face. Tears of sadness and worry and fear.
They walked out of their dorm and down the hall. "See you later" Draco said smiling and walked a separate way. Harry watched him walk away. He smiled and walked his own way to charms class.
They were all trying to shake the memories of what had just happened. Draco was still shaken by the thought of Harry's death. Harry was still shaken by the thought of Draco's.
"Whatever" Barty rolled his eyes and left.
"You two really are so cute together" Hermione said smiling. "Well thank you" Harry smiled and walked over to the armchair. "We are a hot couple" Draco smirked and sat down before Harry did so Harry could take a seat on his lap.
Draco flew around the field slowly and calmly. He took in his surroundings and his company. Harry did the same. "What's your middle name?" Draco looked over at Harry. Harry smiled rather widely over a simple question. Of course it was because he had remembered what Hermione told him.
Harry pulled Draco into the tiny nook and looked up at his eyes. They matched the sky perfectly, gorgeous grey cloudy eyes. Harry thought for a split second he could see the clouds in Draco's eyes moving around. Draco let out a breath. Harry's eyes matched the color on Draco's robes. A true slytherin Draco chuckled to himself.
He got into Harry's bed and laid down under his covers. Draco felt as if his sun had just been taken from him. It felt dark inside of him. It felt like a light had just gone out. Harry could be being beaten and Draco could do nothing about it.  Draco shook his head, Harry was strong. Draco made sure he knew that. He heard something rustle within the sweatshirt's pocket. Draco's eyebrows furrowed and he reached into the pocket. He pulled out a smaller piece of parchment.
"-nice to properly meet the two of you" They heard Narcissa saying to someone. They rounded the corner and saw Ron and Hermione standing there, wearing some of the most beautiful clothing Harry had ever seen them in.
"Looks like it's just you against us now" Draco smirked at his aunt. "I can take all of you on, this should be easy." Bellatrix smiled and began throwing more spells. She was aiming all of them at Harry, but no one would allow her spells to touch him.
Ron and Hermione had completely different looks on their faces. Hermione was smiling and swooning over this new found love between Harry and Draco. Ron was shocked that Draco could care for anyone but himself. Nonetheless they were both thrilled for their best friend.
Draco was still showering so Harry took it upon himself to explore Draco's room. Harry opened drawers, looked under the bed, around the room. Harry chuckled, he kept forgetting not everyone was the chosen one. Not everyone had a bunch of stuff to hide. Draco's room was nothing out of the ordinary. The only thing Harry may have thought was odd if he hadn't known Draco was the Shakespeare book.
Harry shivered and moaned softly into Draco's ear. That sound sent a shiver down Draco's spine. The feel of Harry's warm shaky breaths on Draco's ear felt like heaven. Draco moved his mouth from Harry's earlobe down to his neck. His already marked neck. Draco smirked and went to the other side. He sucked one mark slowly and softly, circling his tongue around it. He bit the tender skin softly. He felt Harry's legs tighten around him.
Draco looked down at Harry's bruised body.
Harry walked out of his room and into the bathroom. He grabbed a rag and wet it. He slowly dabbed his new wound with it, cleaning the blood. Harry winced when it hit the cut, it burned.
"No one knows that I actually have real emotions, so I come here to express them" Draco ran his finger along the random carvings he had made when he was angry. Harry watched his slender fingers pass over the brick.
Harry smiled mischievously. "So you're not angry anymore?" Harry looked at him. "No, no Potter I was never really angry" Draco said through bites of his food. Harry really needed Draco, after watching Draco take control and defend him, Harry was on a short fuse.
Draco had just stood there staring into Harry's eyes. Admiring the sheer sensitivity and innocence that radiated from them. Harry's gorgeous green eyes. They were like gleaming emeralds. Emeralds that held secrets no one would ever know. Emeralds you could get lost in for hours, lose track of all time.
His thoughts were interrupted by Dumbledore.
"When do I get discarded from this god awful place. Believe it or not I miss the green" Harry smiled and rubbed his tired droopy eyes. "I knew you eventually would appreciate that amazing marvelous exquisite color" Draco smiled and caressed Harry's cheek softly.
"You want to see him dead just as much as I do. Bella. We can do it right after Christmas, once they think it can't get any better. It won't, it'll get much worse" He smirked evilly.
"I couldn't agree more." A deeper voice, sounding like a man said from the staircase. Everyone's heads snapped back to look at him.
"What's this for?" Draco said lowly into Harry's ear. "Thank you, for everything" Harry said into Draco's neck where he had buried his face. Draco smiled and hugged Harry tightly. "You're welcome" Draco said softly. "I'm sorry how things are for you" Draco whispered.
They awoke the next morning at the same exact time, sort of odd but also a funny coincidence. Maybe a lovers connection, but who knows. Harry grabbed his glasses and yawned.
The echoing sounds of moaning and their skin softly slapping were the only sounds to be heard. Harry felt Draco brush against his prostate causing Harry to moan. "I found your spot" Draco smirked and continued to hit it. Harry felt a knot form in his stomach.
"Voldemort's dead, I'm fine I promise" Draco said, now a bit worried.
He left his 'home' on his own considering his aunt and uncle would never doing anything for him, the freak.  Harry  arrived at platform 9 3/4 and ran through it with his things.
He looked up at Draco, Draco nodded. "Well it's better if I just show you" Harry said softly and looked around making sure the classroom was completely empty. He unbuttoned his shirt. Snape felt compelled to look away.  Snape's mouth dropped once more when he saw Harry's bruised body.
"Where is it?" Harry looked around and down at Draco's empty hands. Draco got up and opened Harry's door. "Come on he's up" Harry looked out of the doorway, confused at who Draco was talking to.
He walked over and hopped into the truck's driver seat. Draco pulled out of the driveway. "Bye we love you, come visit very soon!" Harry yelled out of the window. She waved until they were no longer in view. "Looks like it's just you and me now huh?" She smiled down at the puppy. The puppy seemed to smile in response. Although he was probably just panting.
"Harry" Blaise whispered. Harry rolled his eyes and turned to face him. "What" Harry whispered back. "You know that Draco's in love with me right?" Blaise whispered back. "Leave me alone Zabini" Harry whispered harshly.
Harry was smiling and crying all at once.
The bruises lightened and almost disappeared. Harry buttoned up his shirt and looked at Snape. "Thank you" Harry said softly. "You're welcome." Snape replied softer than usual.
A stormy sky, clouds and rain. As Harry looked, truly looked, into Draco's eyes he could begin to see a story playing out. A stormy day, a small cottage. Two people lived there alone. They absolutely loved the rainy days. The two people would just sit on their small couch and watch the rain fall against the window. They didn't mind the couch was small, they would just cuddle up to one another. Lovers. They must be lovers. The pitter patter of the rain and the soft grey tones running through the sky were calming. It rained almost everyday in those two people's version of paradise.
Harry just followed and Draco's feet smiling. Draco finally said something. "Close your eyes" Harry obliged and closed them. Draco lead him somewhere, where cool wind hit Harry's face causing him to shiver a little. "Open up" Draco said letting go of Harry's hand. Harry opened his eyes to see they were on the ground in the middle of the quidditch field.
Draco closed the door after Harry left and fell to the floor shaking. He opened up the envelope to read the letter again. He slowly started to re read it.
Harry got up and stretched. "Fine" Harry tried his best to look angry, but he failed and just ended up looking constipated. "What even is that face?" Draco laughed while putting his clothes on. "It's anger bloke" Harry rolled his eyes and dragged himself into his own room to change.
Christmas Morning.
"Where is Potter anyway?" Draco looked at them. "It's Potter now?" Hermione looked at him. "Just answer my question." Draco sat there hoping they wouldn't say the bathroom. He was back in there to grab his envelope and maybe talk to Harry. Draco remembered in his frantic state he had just thrown it about aimlessly.
No talking, just dancing.
"Yeah mate you're finally here, took you long enough the train is leaving soon" Ron said smiling cheerily. "Well..my uncle and aunt were running late so it took a little for them to drive me here" He lied through his smile. "How are those old farts anyway?" Ron said, making his way through the crowd of students holding Hermione's hand.
"Yeah mate sounds great." Draco smiled and lead them to the door. Harry followed. "It's been lovely. Bye you two" Neville smiled and walked out into the cold air. Blaise followed him.
"School has been utter rubbish, it's so boring this year" Harry chuckled light heartedly. Draco smiled over at Harry because Draco could tell Harry was trying. "I completely understand that. And that rubbish headmaster of yours probably doesn't help" Bellatrix said.
"Thank you, knowing that I have you to come back to will really keep me going" Harry smiled. "I'm worried too" Draco said softly. "Really why?" Harry stared at him. "I don't want anything bad to happen to you" Draco rubbed Harry's back. "I'll just hex them" Harry chuckled. "Stay safe please" Draco smiled.
"You scared me" Harry whispered. "I didn't mean to" Draco got comfortable in his seat and pulled out his book. Harry looked at his book. "Shakespeare?" He asked, confused. Draco nodded. "As much as you hate muggles I would've never guessed you would be reading a muggle book" Harry laughed quietly.
Draco sighed and caressed Harry's arm. He knew Harry would most likely go because knowing Harry he always walked right into the face of danger. Draco hoped he wouldn't. Deep down he knew Harry would. If he did he would be leaving tomorrow. Draco decided they wouldn't be attending classes tomorrow. He didn't know how he would pull it off but he knew he had to. If Harry was going to leave, Draco would dedicate the whole day to him. A whole day of positivity, fun, and time spent together.
As Draco was holding Harry, he realized how nice it felt. He realized how nice it felt to hold Harry. He couldn't help but smile. Harry had this grasp on Draco that Draco could never shake. Draco had always felt gravitated to Harry, but now that Harry was his dorm mate. Things just fell into place. Everything was moving fast, but Draco didn't mind. Draco had wanted this for so long, he was lucky he hadn't proposed yet.
"Everything just feels so right I'm just afraid somethings gonna happen..or you might fall out of love with me. I'm afraid you might come to your senses and realize how much better you can do." Harry stared into Draco's grey eyes. His eyes were filled with worry and sadness.
Neville and Blaise laughed and smiled, putting the necklaces on. "They're beautiful thank you Harry." Neville smiled. Harry liked this side of Neville, not so shy, reserved, and jittery. Neville seemed very happy with Blaise. It was another one of those rare loves. Where it was so unexpected yet so anticipated.
He found it and held it so close to him. Harry sobbed into the sweatshirt. He inhaled its scent and calmed down slightly. His breath evened out eventually. He was still crying, just not as heavily. Harry smelled Draco. Harry smelled safety and peace. He let out a shaky breath and laid down holding the sweatshirt. Harry tried to fall asleep, that would indeed numb the pain.
"Yes extremely" He said retracting his hand from Harry's arm. Harry finally looked up at him and smiled a sarcastic smile. Draco smiled back, warmly and sincerely with just a hint of sarcasm. They were, once again, just staring at each other. Draco's eyes flicked down to Harry's lips and back up to his eyes. Draco was finding it extremely difficult to control himself.
"..Draco" Hermione opened the door and walked in with Ron. His head slowly lifted from Harry's bed to turn and look at the two of them. "You need to eat something. Go get some lunch" Ron said.
Draco's head shot up and he furrowed his eyebrows. "Yes?" He looked at him.
"Bye boys" Hermione smiled and the finally left.
"Yeah yeah that sounds like fun" Neville smiled as well. "You two should come as well" Harry turned his attention to Ron and Hermione who were already listening in on the conversation. "We'd be delighted." Hermione said.
Once the applause calmed he made his way out of the hall and back to the hospital wing. Draco walked in and saw Hermione as well as Ron, just watching Harry. Draco smiled and let out a breath of relief.
"By the way Mr. Zabini the potion you used is temporary should wear off within the next 10 minutes" Snape patted his shoulder and walked out into the hallway making his way to the hospital wing. Draco had led Harry there, listening to him ramble on about how great Blaise was.
"I haven't actually, well for that matter no one except the head boy has been notified. He's the only one who gets to know. You should know that" He looked at her, scanning over her shocked face.
I told him I would...I would go" Harry looked down.
"That's why most of you saw blood in my clothes, it wasn't me. I didn't hurt Harry. I wouldn't hurt him. I did hurt the man who had taken him. If I hadn't he would've become a threat to us all...I know it won't be easy to just believe I've changed. I do hope someday, somehow you all will forgive me for my past ways." Draco smiled slightly and looked out at everyone staring back at him.
"We were wondering if you two would want to come to a dinner at the manor sometime during break?" Harry began eating. "Yes that sounds like a great time" Hermione smiled and nodded. Ron nodded as well. "Neville" Harry looked down the table and gestured for him to come over. Draco indulged in a conversation with Ron about how he was a ginger.
They both fell back to sleep. Comfortable in each other's arms. There was this silent anxiety Harry had, he constantly wondered how long this would last. The nude fragility that captivated Draco. He wondered when Draco would turn on him and build his walls back up.
Harry looked over at them then back up at Draco. "How did you manage this?" Harry chuckled. "I have my ways" Draco smirked and picked them up. He threw one to Harry and mounted his. Harry mounted his. "Race me to the top?" Draco asked challengingly.
"Nothing just a prank or something" Draco said softly. "Oh well alright" Harry didn't move. "Well go get dressed" Draco said with a little edge in his voice. Harry flinched at it slightly and walked out of the bathroom.
"No intrusion at all" Harry said smiling as well. "Kind of an intrusion if you ask me" Draco mumbled and snickered.  Harry looked away and blushed. "We'll be on our way now, you boys enjoy the rest of your day" Hermione said leaving the room and closing the door.
"What person? And what about me and Draco?" He looked down at her. "Oh so it's Draco now? I'm most definitely going to win." She smiled.
"Yes?" Blaise looked down at Draco and Harry. "Sit down" Draco said and patted the seat between Harry and Draco. Harry nodded. Blaise sat down. "What?" He looked at both of them. "Neville's totally into you" Harry smiled with excitement. "Really?" Blaise's face lit up. "Yes and we're having a dinner at Malfoy Manor, You, Neville, Ron, Hermione, and us. Will you come?" Harry said to Blaise.
Harry sucked and nibbled at his neck. Draco bit his lip and laid his head back. Harry finished sucking and licked over the marks he had left. Draco pulled Harry's face back up to his own and pressed their lips together again.
Draco walked over and lit the fireplace. He sat on the couch with his book and waited for Harry. Harry came and sat down next to Draco. Draco pulled Harry to lay his head on his chest,  he wrapped his right arm around Harry and held the book. Harry threw his legs onto Draco's and got comfortable.
He ate delicately like a doe. He took small bites. He seemed to be savoring every bit of food, but also eating as little as he could. The time had passed, Ron and Hermione had to go. Draco was relieved, he had heard enough of their jabbering. They got up and smiled. "Bye Harry, see you at dinner, or not" Ron chuckled and took Hermione's hand. "Bye Harry, Malfoy" She smiled and left with Ron.
Draco had taken up a habit of making sure Harry got to sleep before he did. Draco wanted to make sure Harry wouldn't be awake alone, so he always waited for Harry to fall asleep first. Once he was sure the love of his life was asleep, he could finally sleep.
"I wanna go lay down I'm tired." Harry grumbled and stomped off into Draco's room. Draco followed him. Draco removed Harry's shoes for him and helped him into bed. "I'm fine Dray." Harry said smiling. "I know, I still worry" Draco got into bed as well.
"He's uh..in the shower" Draco smirked as he said it. "But weren't you..?" Hermione looked at Draco but quickly shut up. Ron looked disgusted. "I'll go get him." Draco slinked away and into Harry's room to get him some comfortable clothes. Once he retrieved the clothes he walked into the bathroom and shut the door behind him.
Harry twiddled his thumbs and slightly lowered his head. "I don't know. I just...I don't know" Harry sighed. Draco placed his hand on Harry's cheek and lifted his face back up. "You just what?" Draco looked at him with concern.
Harry smiled and stood up, he began rubbing Draco's head to wash the shampoo out. Draco leaned his head back and moaned with pleasure, the head massage was much needed. "Look I've made you moan in multiple ways today" Harry smirked and finished washing out the shampoo. "Yes love you're right" Draco turned around and wrapped his arm around Harry's waist. The pulsating water hitting both of them.
Draco smiled a little and waited for Harry's reaction. Harry's face brightened. "I love it here" Harry smiled softly. Draco just smiled. Harry's eyes drifted along the field. Memories of past quidditch matches came flooding back. Harry couldn't help but smile brightly. Draco motioned to the two broomsticks laying on the ground a little from them.
Draco offered a small smile then let it drop. "It's fine Potter now go to sleep and stop waking me up" Draco said smoothly. "Alright Malfoy, oh and that beauty sleep isn't working." Harry said softly and laid back down. "You're such a prat Potter" Draco said walking out of his room.
"Your room has plenty green Mr. Malfoy." Dumbledore said softly and cooly. "Now the door on the right side is Harry's bedroom, the door on the left is Draco's bedroom, the door towards the back of the room leads to the study."
"That sounds amazing" They sat down. "What sounds amazing?" Ron looked up from his food. Everyone was wearing their normal clothes considering they were being fed breakfast and essentially being kicked out right after.
Draco and Harry.
That room was like the sun of Draco's manor. All the other rooms just circled around it. Snape and Dumbledore were looking around. "I've been expecting you, just not the others you were so kind to bring with you" Lucius said as he made his way into the room. All four of them turned around to face him. "Where is he you lowlife?!" Draco shouted. "Calm down son, no harm has been done. Yet" Lucius smirked sinisterly.
"You never do.. listen I might be crazy but I swear I saw a hint of red on his right wrist"  Ron looked up at her shocked and leaned in close "You think he.." Ron looked around to make sure no one was listening and leaned in  "...cuts?" Hermione nodded. "I don't want to ask him though. He would be extremely offended" Ron nodded "Let's just leave it be, the poor lad is already dealing with Malfoy's shit."
Draco slowly slithered out of Harry's grip. He watched Harry sleep. Just for a quick second to make sure it was over. Harry's eyes suddenly  fluttered open. Both boys had messy hair and tired eyes. "Merlin Malfoy you have got to stop doing that" Harry said wiping the sweat from his forehead.
"Mobilicorpus" Lucius flicked his wand at Draco and threw him into a wall across the room.  Draco groaned and grabbed his chest. Lupin grabbed for his wand and pulled it out. "Harry" Lucius smirked. "Don't touch him." Lupin said getting closer to Lucius.
Draco laid down and got under the covers as well. "Mind if I read?" Draco looked over at Harry who was taking his glasses off. "You better not be reading Shakespeare without me prat" Harry said smiling. "It's a different book you git" Draco chuckled. "Then go ahead" Harry cuddled up to Draco. He placed his head on Draco's chest and intertwined their legs.
"Yes I am and you can't stop me." Harry turned to face Draco and smiled.
"They're the same color as yours, a beautiful silvery grey" Harry smiled into Draco's shoulder. Draco was now the one to break into a big cheesy smile. His heart skipped a beat and his stomach filled with butterflies of excitement. Someone took the time to really see his eyes. To really look at him.
They all caught their breath and calmed down. "Well, since we've all laughed our arses off I feel the question doesn't need to be answered" Draco smirked and continued eating. "Well then. Christmas, how about you all stop by on Christmas for a little gift exchange yeah?" Ron suggested.
His cold heart would warm.
"Harry.." Draco chuckled breathily. "You probably know where this is going" Draco took a pause to take a breath. Harry smiled widely, tears now falling down his cheeks. "So, this is such a cliché. I promised myself I would never fall into a cheesy cliché, but god I would do anything for you. Harry James Potter. You risked your life for me and I would risk mine for you. Our hearts are tied together, I ache when I'm not with you. Almost losing you was the scariest moment of my whole entire life. I don't ever want to lose you. You're the whole reason I am who I am. I changed because of you, I'm happier because of you. My home, my love, and my darling..." Draco took a shaky breath.
"Please remember to be safe around these people" Snape returned to his normal face. "I will" Harry smiled. "You will be using apparition to get there I've heard?" Snape looked at him. Harry nodded. "Well then boys have your little moment so we can get this show on the road" Snape looked at the both of them. Draco smirked as he saw an opportunity to scar his godfather and get to kiss Harry once more.
Harry nodded and yawned. Draco walked out of his room and into Harry's. He walked over to Harry's wardrobe and pulled his pajamas out. "We've got to get you more in green Potter" Draco said to himself and chuckled. He walked back into his room to find Harry sitting on the edge of his bed with his ankles crossed and his hands folded neatly on his lap. "Thank you" Harry said smiling.
Harry finished putting his clothes on and walked into the bathroom, almost bumping into Draco. They both walked into the bathroom and brushed their teeth. "I'm nervous" Harry admitted and looked up at Draco who was wiping his mouth. "About what?" Draco turned to him. "What if your mom decided she doesn't want me there" Harry tapped his foot nervously.
With love,
"Be safe" Harry yelled from the shower. Draco opened the portrait and saw Hermione and Ron standing there. He could always count on them to ruin a moment. "Taking a shower?" Ron said stepping inside. "Just got out of one." Draco said and stepped aside letting them in.
"I'm such a mess I'm sorry you got stuck dealing with me, I promise when we're no longer living together you will not have to deal with me" Harry said softly and wiped his eyes once more. Draco felt a pang of sadness wash over him. Harry probably wanted him gone.
Draco slowly and softly placed his lips back on Harry's. Not with the same passion and fire that characterized their earlier kiss, but with tenderness and compassion. He got the same shock through his body. He smirked softly when he felt Harry kissing back.
Draco opened it, there lay one of the most beautiful  rings he had ever seen. "Oh Harry.."Draco was at a loss for words. A large band, an emerald in the middle. Shapes and grooves carved into the metal band. "You always complain about how you don't have enough rings, so I got you one more to add to your tiny collection." Harry smiled at his reaction.
Draco wanted a snowy wedding, something cold but beautiful. Harry wanted a wedding somewhere in a clearing of a forest. So they agreed on a snowy wedding in a clearing.
The day of his funeral. The day Draco would bury the love of his life. The day Draco would completely lose himself.
Draco kissed Harry like his life depended on it. Harry wanted to make Draco feel good as well. He just had no idea how to. Harry ran his hands down to rest on the small of Draco's back. Draco's lips were as velvety soft as Harry had imagined. Their lips fit together like pieces of a puzzle. Harry had butterflies in his stomach. Draco had complete control over Harry. Harry didn't want this to ever stop or end.
He could feel Draco's eyes burning holes into the back of his head. Harry wanted to turn back and say something rude, but he didn't. He couldn't even bring himself to be genuinely rude to Draco for some reason. Harry promised himself he would stay to himself, be calm and quiet. Harry was so lost in his head he hadn't even noticed Ron and Hermione waiting for him.
"A moron? Me?" Ron said looking down at Hermione curiously. "Yes Ron a moron" Hermione said going to a certain section of the library and pulling a few books off the shelf. "I just don't think it would ever happen it doesn't seem realistic?" Hermione looked up at him as she was sitting down. "Well personally I think it makes much sense, they've 'hated' each other for years. I always catch Harry glancing over at the Slytherin table, I've been trying to figure out what girl it was" Hermione said flipping open a book.  "Maybe it wasn't a girl at all" Hermione said.
Draco's heart slightly shattered. "Oh yes I forgot." He said softly. "Come help me pack" Harry smiled. "Of course" Draco smiled as well and helped Harry up.
Draco rubbed small circles on Harry's hip bone. Harry slowly and smoothly bucked his hips along Draco's leg. Draco held Harry softly. "Baby calm down" Draco smirked and ran his hands down to grab Harry's ass. This caused Harry to let out a shocked yet satisfied gasp. Harry was growing needy and impatient. He continued to grind his hips along Draco's thigh. Draco let both of his hand fall down to hold Harry's hips, feeling the motion of Harry eagerly grinding.
He knocked.
"Sectumsempra" Lucius shouted and pointed his wand directly at Harry. Harry's head shot to the direction of Lucius who was smiling cheerily. "No!" Draco shouted and watched Harry fall to the ground with a thud. Harry began bleeding. Pools of red spilling out of the man he loved, and it was all his fault. Draco was going to be sick.
Other looks weren't as kind. People looked like they were about to be sick to their stomachs. Mostly Gryffindor and Slytherin were giving those rude looks. Draco knew why they were receiving looks, it had completely slipped his mind to tell Harry of the speech in the Great Hall.
"Good to see you Sevy" Narcissa smiled and made her way up the stairs and out of the dungeon. Harry followed behind her. "Great to see you Sev" Harry smiled. Snape was rather confused why Narcissa was there. He shrugged it off they had much more to focus on.
Draco did the only thing he could think of, the only thing he could offer. He moved closer to Harry. Harry just looked down at his bruises. Draco spoke softly. "Look at me" Harry slowly looked up to meet Draco's eyes.
Harry woke up in a cold sweat to find a worried Draco staring down at him. "Potter what in  bloody hell is your problem today?" He said with his voice mildly shaky, but clearly trying to sound stern. Harry looked around and saw some light glistening through the sides of his curtains. "Yes i'm fine..i'm sorry i keep waking you" Harry smiled wryly. "You should be, but what then two in one night?" Draco asked
I only managed to collect myself in the evening. That’s when I realised: I had to move out of the dorm tomorrow, and still hadn’t found a new place to live. The mere image of Grimmauld place gave me a strong desire to sleep outside or to invite myself to Ron and Hermione’s, who were about to move in together. Surely, I had to show up on Grimmauld place, 12 - otherwise that old rascal Kreacher was absolutely capable of thinking I’m dead and inviting some purebloods to the house to take my place – but I was determined to waste no more than ten minutes there. I promised myself to find a quick solution to my housing problem and got in the shower.
“And transphobic,” Finn added.
“Well, I demand respect too! This is not your place to give out orders. Now please leave!”
“Go ahead, Mr. Potter. This case is perfect for beginners,” Mr. Harper patted me on the shoulder with a fatherly look.
“Is this Eaton Mews South, 28?”
“My parents chose home schooling,” she answered simply. “Can’t say I was upset to miss that authoritarian school of yours.”
But – rarely – I do live.
His eyes met Harry’s and he stopped talking in surprise. Finally, he tossed his purple hair off his forehead.
Tony let out an irritated sigh.
“Not every opinion is a riot, Potter. But I suppose you can't explain this to my father,” Malfoy calmed down a bit and took another smoke. “What about you? Are you happy with your life?”
“She is,” I agreed.
“It’s no use talking to you,” he snapped, but I could tell he wasn’t really annoyed.
“I don’t know where to start,” he admitted quietly.
Draco closed his eyes for a long second, and Harry wondered in what specific words he was cursing his employer in his head. Finally, Draco sighed and sat up.
“It would be stupid of him not to take such an obvious defence,” I argued.
“Whatever.”
With these words he grabbed a girl nearby by the hand and disappeared in the dancing crowd with her. I was getting ready to spend the night alone, as a cute blond girl emerged by my side.
I live when behind the condescending smirk in the hallway I – and I alone! – see real compassion. I live when you push me with your shoulder during the potions class - I know that you go through all the effort just to touch me. I live when we pick a demonstrative fight in front of everyone, and you can’t hit me, even though you know this will make you look like a coward.
“No way,” Annalise shook her head fiercely. “I bet you have heard…”
“A layer cake,” Tony answered, opening the oven and poking the contents of a baking circle with a long match.
The flames flickered and showed Mum’s tired face. Merlin, I still cannot help but feel guilty each time I see her, although she wasn’t mad at me in the first place.
“It’s okay, it’s over,” Harry repeated.
“You can look in the fridge. I’m sure you can handle it,” Malfoy responded and went back to reading.
Downstairs, in the kitchen, Malfoy put the coffee pot on the stove.
“Why would you invite the goddamn saviour, Draco?” Harry heard an irritated voice say. “He won’t understand…”
“Be careful. You’ll owe him a favour,” Draco noted.
Draco opened his mouth to answer, but Tony was faster and snapped:
He ran his hand over the surface, it was polished wood with a small metallic latch to open the compartment that stored the pieces. He was no expert but it looked well loved, and too nicely crafted to be something found laying around in a hospital. He easily opened it and on the underside of the top he saw the crude lettering of a child’s handwriting spelling out D. L. MALFOY.
“Have a good night,” he called cheerfully as soon as they got out of the hospital.
“I’ll leave you in his capable hands,” she told Harry, then she turned to Malfoy. “Call if anything goes wrong and don’t overwork him,” she recommended.
It was the sloppiest grip Draco had ever seen and Scorpius looked seconds away from rolling upside down, but he had this big excited grin on his face that Draco couldn't resist. He crouched down and beckoned him closer.
“No, I’m sorry, disregard my face. I want you to go and do what you need to do for yourself. We’ll figure everything else out when you get back.” Harry nodded. “And until then I’m going to make peace with Soup.”
“Something interesting?” Potter asked, watching him put the plant away.
Draco lifted his chin and straightened his shoulders tugging slightly on the lapels to make sure the robes fell right on his body and walked in, followed by Blaise half a step behind.
"Another white man being rewarded for the bare minimum. You
Much as he would have liked to spend his time off watching Potter and Foster set up better protections for the village against the fury of the river, he thought his time would be better employed tagging along with Healer Gupta and Professor Chambers to see what he could pick up in the ways of Bengali magical practises. He sat with the children, watching as they carefully applied henna to their hands and arms, mimicking the pattern on their parents as they practised patience and precision needed to harness the wild energy that grew within them.
“Probably? That’s not very comforting,” Weasley argued.
Andrews placed his elbow on the table clasped his hands and leaned closer “I wouldn’t call it abundance of evidence. All the reports are from Healer Malfoy himself. We have no guarantee they are accurate.” He raised an eyebrow in challenge at Blaise.
“Kneel for me, Potter,” he repeated, soft and inviting, uncrossing his legs, making a space for him between his knees.
“I didn’t” Malfoy replied, and from the finality in his tone, Harry knew he wasn’t going to get anything more about it even if he asked.
“As soon as I get out of the hospital we can go flying together again,” He promised “so you can show me all the new tricks you’ve learned.” He smiled, squeezing his shoulder.
"Good," Harry replied with a small smile. "Uncomplicated."
Harry insisted they wait until the curse-breaker arrived before leaving, and that meant a lot of idle time for him and a lot of work for Malfoy and Healer Gupta, making their way through the population performing cleansing rituals on everyone still sporting the creeping tendrils of curse damage on their skin, disrupting their tattoos, or anyone whose casting was inconsistent and erratic.
Malfoy towered over him when he straightened up and stepped closer, forcing Harry to look up to keep eye contact.
As usual many many thanks to Jay for being a wonderful beta and the best partner in crime I could ask for.
"It won't always be this bad, hopefully. Healer Gupta can prevent the worst of these accidents," Draco reassured him.
“I’m just a guest lecturer,” Draco reminded him, walking back out in a simple ensemble of white linen and olive green suit.
Draco smiled apologetically before paying the driver with a ridiculously excessive amount of money.
“Then?” It came out in a rushed breath, the question suspended in the air between them until Malfoy averted his eyes again.
“It’s more than I could have ever imagined. You have no idea how much this means to me.”
Hermione sighed and sat down in the chair in front of him. "You're not looking at the bigger picture, Harry; his past and the connotations his name brings is one of the reasons I want him here. He was the worst Britain had to offer and he's trying to be the best now. I have to believe he can, because if he can then we all can."
“What did you do?” Harry asked, his eyes flitting between the two of them. He could taste a good story, and he just needed someone to fill him in.
It’s not how it’s supposed to go.
“You pulled me in at one point,” he said, unsure. Malfoy nodded.
Then he woke up, restless and uncomfortable in his bed, when had the mattress gotten so lumpy?
Draco had already made a horrid mistake, two actually. The second one admitting responsibility out loud in front of Potter. It was the first thing one learned: don’t admit a mistake in front of a patient if you don’t want to get sued.
"You don't have to be around him, I can arrange things so you can be out of each other's hair most of the time and you can pretend he's not there," she offered.
"She's getting good, have you seen my nails?" Ron asked, poking his head out the bar window, wiggling a set of sparkly lime-coloured nails at Harry. Suddenly, matte purple didn't seem so outrageous.
She was going to have to talk to Harry.
Draco glanced at the small group, gathered in the embassy foyer, exactly where they'd met three months prior, each of them so different from when they started.
“Please?” Harry whispered.
(See the end of the chapter for
He had to take a moment to really take the view in. Harry naked, spread out like a buffet on his bed, looking delectable against the silk sheets, just begging to be ravaged with that smile on his face that made Draco weak at the knees.
"That's horse shit."
His hand went up to rub his chest, his wand abandoned next to him on the bed. It felt hollow now, like the feelings he’d been filled with had left him empty now that they were gone. There was something missing.
Draco nodded and gestured for her to take a seat. "It's a pleasure to meet you, and I have to thank you in advance for your invaluable work. I'm afraid I will be wholly dependent on you." He smiled a bit self-consciously as he took a seat in front of her at the small table beneath the window. He usually tried to learn at least a little bit of the language before leaving for a mission, so as to not be entirely helpless, but there just hadn't been enough time for it.
“Next time you decide to risk your life for mine without telling me, you better die because I’m killing you myself as soon as I find out,” Harry threatened.
"Maybe?" Harry replied, honestly unsure. He still saw the refined aristocracy of the arch of Malfoy's lips and the long elegant fingers, so similar to his mother's, and he couldn't reconcile that with the rough life of a disaster relief volunteer. But he'd counted the freckles on his cheekbones where he'd worked under the sun, and felt the calluses of his hands grown from his tireless wand work; he'd seen how Malfoy had changed into the man sitting in front of him. Wasn't it disrespectful to keep looking for the boy he used to be?
The gate.
Harry felt the same cold rage and boiling revulsion he'd discovered upon finding the horrid Muggle trials setup at the Ministry, ten years prior. Some things never did change apparently, and as horrified as everyone acted with Voldemort's rise and fall and second coming, it was just more of the same. Healer Gupta spoke of it calmly and with detachment, almost used to the horrors of the irreparable loss of generations-worth of knowledge and practices.
And then Harry was alone again.
Draco raised an eyebrow in question. "How so?"
"Siddhima ji, it's wonderful to see you again. Can I introduce you to our head of medical personnel Draco Malfoy?"
"A phallic symbol comparable to the Nelson column and the Washington monument?" he proposed.
“Malfoy? no, it was something with a D, Dennis, Dawn, Dana. It was Dana.” Seamus said “Malfoy’s your healer?” he asked, his lips twitching, trying not to show how absurdly funny the idea was.
Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy's upturned nose and turned into the alley his feet brought him back to, almost without thinking, until they stopped in front of the gurdwara and Harry could breathe more easily.
Draco smiled and shook his head, reaching out to touch Harry's arm. "I'm not going back to England, Harry. It's in safe hands, Blaise and Granger have it all figured out. And our work is not done here. If you'll have me, I want to stay, help you track down every last magical person in India and make sure they have the support they need and deserve."
“I was always
“An illegal bar,” Emmet retorted.
“Are you telling me
“Shit,” Tony cursed. “What do you do now?”
The high-pitched noise of the alarm clock forced me out of my sleep, and I found myself in a completely unfamiliar place. A double bed, a bedside table with a lamp on it, grey curtains… My sleepy brain tried to remember how I had ended up here. I reached out for my glasses and sat up. Shit… Malfoy.
They stared at each other for a short moment, then Harry remembered why he was there.
I rolled my eyes and leaned on the opposite wall, waiting for the possibility to wash up. About five minutes later the door opened, and Malfoy came out of the bathroom, looking a bit too chipper.
“Tell me honestly, Hermione, are you upset because you put so much effort in that house, and I still don’t live there?” I asked, deciding to call the big guns. Ron chuckled and glanced at Hermione: she backed down immediately.
Narcissa went quiet for a while. Then she added:
“Okay,” I shrugged and stood up too. It was time to get going.
“What?” I asked, confused.
“I guess it’s a bit late to go there,” he said hesitantly.
“What are you talking about?! It’s a bar!”
“Um, what if I brought you mine?” Harry asked, realising that his explanation was vague at best. “I’m sure I still have it. It’s a bit old, but we are about the same age anyway, right? We could make a copy and then just alter it a bit.”
Okay, the fic takes a direction you might not expect...
Malfoy gestured at Tony to be quiet.
“Always keep your word, huh?” he inquired sarcastically as we stepped outside.
We ate our breakfast in stony silence. Neither of us had forgotten yesterday’s fight, so it was still too awkward to speak. I think that if I’d had another option – Ron and Hermione’s place doesn’t count, of course, I didn’t want to be a third wheel – I would have left yesterday. But as it was too late to look for another place, I thought I could make a compromise and stay. Merlin almighty, I decided to make a compromise with Malfoy! Surprisingly, Malfoy accepted my terms. It has been twenty minutes since he went out of the bathroom, and he still hasn’t said anything diminishing.
“I don’t know what you’re afraid of,” I shrugged.
“Well, you could try and kick me out,” I interjected, diving under Malfoy’s arm as he tried to block the way, and managed to get inside. The bathroom was nice: a new shiny sink, yellow tile. It would have been perfect to have two, though. Meanwhile, Malfoy entered the bathroom as well – I could tell he was dissatisfied and perplexed at the same time.
The barmaid – and, as Harry figured, the owner of the place – turned to Harry and said,
“Nope. I’m lucky that the only thing Mrs. Black’s portrait can do is yell,” Harry chuckled. “If she was able to use spells, I’d be dead the minute I walked in here for the first time.”
special.”
Finn chuckled. Hermione looked intrigued. Ron took the chess box from the floor and put it on the table.
Ah, crap, there’s only one bathroom here.
“If you make me some coffee, I’ll make enough eggs for both of us. Will that do?” I inquired sarcastically.
“Who are you, again?” she insisted.
“What are you staring at, Potter? Am I insulting your sense of beauty?”
“Forgot this one: mind your own business,” I snapped.
“Well, to be fair, you can find a lot of things on the black market,” Draco conceded, still smiling.
Several hours later he left the crowd, soaking wet after dancing so long, and headed to the pavilion to get himself a drink. As he approached the entrance, a skinny guy with purple hair drew his attention: he was standing with his back to Harry, smoking. The sight of the cigarette and the casual way the guy flicked the ashes reminded Harry of how he used to smoke about once a week – that was before Hermione had lectured him on the outcomes. Suddenly, Harry realised that right now he didn’t give a fuck about the odds of developing lung cancer, and went over to the guy.
“Is there something illegal going on here?”
“He is sweet, isn’t he?” Finn chuckled, flicking the ashes into the glass. “He thinks there is a potioneer who would care enough for trans people to break the law.”
The elf Disapparated, and I went back into the kitchen. A large round tray full of food was waiting on the table.
“And she likes me. I hope you’re not jealous,” he said complacently.
Draco chuckled and took a sip of his beer.
guys, I swear, I’ll…”
“Why not.”
And then it struck me: I wanted a flatmate, didn’t I? Potter could be a decent choice. First of all, he’s a wizard, so I wouldn’t have to hide a simple Lumos, and I could continue using the Floo network as usual. Secondly, after our time at school, I knew him as the back of my hand. The prospect of making fun of him as in the good old days was honestly pretty tempting. The hatred was long gone, and now I only felt a bit annoyed when I looked at Potter. But the most important thing was that I doubted I could find another wizard willing to live here. So I decided to seize the opportunity.
Anyhow, trying to figure out Potter’s motives was a thankless task. Besides, as long as he complies to my rules, I won’t be complaining.
“Yes, Master,” the house elf replied, disappeared and came back almost at once.
“Better?” Harry asked in a few minutes.
“Everybody makes mistakes.”
“Illegal lucrative activity is under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department, not the Auror office,” he stated.
Harry was pretty impressed by the clarity of the answer; he wouldn’t have ever thought that Malfoy would end up explaining Muggle stuff to him. It was a curious feeling: thinking you know someone so well, and yet not knowing them at all.
“Hey,” I protested, taking the toothbrush out of my mouth.
Harry rubbed his neck nervously.
Draco gave him a thankful look and rushed out of the room; Harry followed, even though he wasn’t sure it was a good idea. He stopped at the door of the living room, so that he could hear what was going on.
“I told you to not leave your stuff…” I started in an instructive tone, but he cut me off.
“Oh, yeah,” Harry turned around, looking for a spot that wasn’t already taken by books or clothes. There was no room on the coffee table, so he finally put them on one of the drums by the window. “I didn’t see you here yesterday.”
“Why should I tell them that I’m staying at your place? They wouldn’t care.”
“I never tell lies, let’s put it that way.”
A Monday morning wasn’t an appropriate time to dwell on the situation, especially because today was my first day at work. So I pushed away my thoughts on yesterday’s incident in the kitchen that almost led to a duel, stood up, put my pants on and dragged myself to the bathroom which next to my room.
“Your Gryffindor strategies don’t work on me,” he answered and crossed his arms on his chest.
“Are you going to tell us who these people are?” she asked. “You hardly invite anyone here.”
He couldn’t help but give Draco an ironic smile.
“Not that it’s any of my business,” he started carefully, handing Draco one of the bottles and sitting on the bed next to him, “but there’s a Howler on your desk.”
“I should have asked for forty galleons. It feels like I rented out the whole place,” Malfoy muttered.
“Do you give up?”
? A Malfoy?” he snapped, and Harry nodded. “If only you knew how tired I was of being a Malfoy! I’m not playing by anyone’s rules anymore. At least, now I’m free.”
“It’s funny how some people are pushed into marriage, while others can’t marry even if they want to,” Draco said bitterly, rolling a flat pebble in his hand.
The next day I let Ron talk me into going to the mall with him and Hermione, because “she wanted to buy some stuff”. I tried replying that if Hermione wanted to buy stuff, it was probably for their future flat, but Ron insisted:
“Draco told me you were usually here on Sundays. I came to give you this,” Harry explained and handed her the certificate. “Take your time, I don’t need it right now.”
“I already looked there…”
“What do you want, father?” Draco snapped. “What serious business forced you to step in
Malfoy looked at me, eyebrows raised.
“He had a good reason to steal,” I retorted.
We were standing in front of the bathroom, arguing about who should go first. And even though I was there a step before Malfoy, he wasn’t ready to back off.
“That’s it, I’ve had enough of you two arguing!” exclaimed Ron. “I want to dance. Hermione?”
“Nice to meet you,” she added.
“Don’t stare at me, better tell me if we have something edible.”
“Well, yeah, I think we can both agree I’m not that straight after all,” Harry snorted.
“The Ministry? You sure were,” he smiled. “Me… Ah, I don’t know yet. Tonight I’m having fun!”
Ron opened his mouth to share his doubts concerning this decision, but Hermione was faster:
“Owl me if you need any help.”
“Deal,” he said.
“Thank Merlin, no.”
Soon I found myself in front of a long series of two-storey apartments, each with a separate porch. I found the one with the number 28 above it and knocked. I heard someone swear on the other side, and the voice sounded vaguely familiar. Finally the doorknob turned, and I found myself staring at the owner.
“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Run!”
“Never mind, Potter, you’re welcome here,” he said. “This is my flatmate Tony, they’re also the drummer in our band.”
“Enough with the celebrity jokes, please,” Annalise said, but Ron didn’t mind, nor did Harry.
all over the place.
“I don’t really like other bars. I suppose we could all go to our place, but we have nothing to eat, I guess…”
“I will one day.”
“Modest, of course,” I nodded. “If a girl likes a modest public defender, then it’s definitely about him, not the corpse of the Dark Lord.”
“Do you miss your family?” Harry asked quietly.
“Oh, do you want me to get the Minister here? Will that be convincing enough?” Harry snapped.
“What about you?” Harry asked. “When did you know you were gay?”
I sighed and dragged myself to the kitchen. Of course, the fridge was empty, except from some eggs and a bottle of milk. I should have guessed, though. I sighed again and went through the freezer where I found some frozen vegetables. I took out a pan and was about to start cooking – living with the Dursleys wasn’t that useless, after all – when I heard a muffled laugh behind my back.
“Oh. Is your family related to the Blacks?”
“Hi.”
Ron put the bottle down on the table with a loud clank, his eyebrows lifted.
The day went by calmly. Harper continued periodically sending me weird looks – I still couldn’t understand why. At six o’clock I finished work, went out of the Ministry and headed towards Eaton Mews. I didn’t want to call it home, but it was surely more cosy than the house on Grimmauld place. Just the sight of Malfoy in his stretched out pants this morning was worth it – I chuckled at the memory. I couldn’t have imagined that the usually neat Malfoy actually owned such clothes.
“Wipe your glasses in the morning,” I said and pointed at the watch.
Malfoy’s lips curled in an understanding smile.
“Dating? Is that what you’re asking?”
“Do you still want a cigarette?” he asked.
“I told you so,” Tony said to Draco, arms folded.
Annalise shook her head.
,” I sighed. Is it that difficult to boil two cups of water instead of one?!
“Fuck this, I’m out. But if you,” Tony pointed at Harry, “dare call me a ‘he’, you are never coming back here again.”
“Why don’t you change anything?”
“Will you help me figure it out?” Harry asked as the blueish stage lights gave Malfoy’s eyes a particularly beautiful glow.
“I bet. Well, in this case I’ll go to my room. I’ll have all day tomorrow to contemplate your face.”
“The Blacks?”
“Nah, I wouldn’t be able to make it presentable anyway. I’d love a tattoo, though.”
“Ugh,” Annalise sighed and sat on the couch. “It’s more difficult than I expected. Turns out the Confundus…”
But I was in for a surprise. Standing on my porch, more mature than in my memories but still quite recognizable, was Harry Potter. I was so stunned I forgot to take my burnt finger out of my mouth.
Emmet blinked in surprise when he saw Harry.
“Only complete idiots don’t like the loaded national hero. But when it comes to an ordinary public defender…”
“Wanna go back to my place?” Draco asked, panting.
An Apparition crack in the living room cut Harry short. He was about to ask if Draco was expecting somebody, but there was no need.
I was on the “enemy territory” – at least, that’s how Mr. Green jokingly called the investigation department. The office was small, with only two desks and a great amount of stuff lying around: books, parchments, two maps of London - a Muggle one and one of the wizarding city. Mr. Green and I came here this morning, so that Potter and I could discuss the strategy for the hearing. Potter’s desk was as much of a mess as the rest of the place, which made me uncomfortable. Mr. Green, however, didn’t seem surprised or bothered: he sat down in front of Potter’s boss, with whom he had some other business to sort out.
“In the meantime, I’m going to rent a flat.”
She cut herself short and glanced at Harry.
Harry found it a bit difficult to concentrate, as Draco’s shoulder was touching his own, and, once again, he had a perfect view of the tattoo on Draco’s neck. In the daylight it looked even better: the dotted work went perfectly well with the pale, freckled skin. Harry forced himself not to stare.
I doubt that anyone understands what my life is really like. I keep up with the appearances and, if asked, I smile and say that everything’s fine, although deep inside I know that my life is painted in two distinct colours: the colour of life and the colour of existence. And the bright, breath-taking colour of life only occurs on rare occasions; the rest of the time am content with simply existing.
“Yes, and I’m pretty sure this wasn’t the first time.”
“She’s Muggle,” he answered. “Billie Eilish. If you go out in the Muggle part of London, you must have seen her face on the billboards.”
“You are always welcome here, Mr. Potter.”
“Malfoy,” I said after thinking a bit, “does your fireplace work?”
“It’s going to be okay.”
I chuckled as I watched the door close. There was one thing that hasn’t changed about Malfoy: he didn’t let anybody know what he really thought. I could plainly see that he liked my company. It was quite obvious, actually: to start with, he rented me a room instead of brushing me off, and yesterday he spent almost two hours talking to me, and I could swear that he’d enjoyed our semi-official altercations as much as I had.
“What do you want me to do, send him a Patronus? And let go of my books already.”
They hadn’t seen each other since Monday, and Harry started to feel like the image of the purple hair and the tattoo was but a figment of his imagination, a hallucination produced by his exhausted mind. But Malfoy dispelled Harry’s doubts by owling back a brief note saying, “Well that’s a start. Wanna come over to my place this evening? We’re having a party. Floo: Honey badger.”
We went upstairs to change. I hesitated for a second before asking, “Are you walking to the Ministry?”
Hermione gave Harry a quick hug, and they Disapparated. Harry went upstairs to the bedroom and found an owl waiting for the window to be opened. He let the bird in, it dropped a note, made an angry noise and flew away. Harry recognized Draco’s handwriting.
Malfoy sighed and put the bottle on the floor next to the bed.
“What are your terms, Malfoy?”
“I don’t care. Get the hell out of here.”
“Harry!”
“Oh,” she calmed down, nodded understandingly and settled down on the couch. “All right then. I’m Iris.”
“We should eat,” I voiced my decision.
“I do,” Draco tossed his hair off his forehead and sat up straight. “But the price of being part of it is too high.”
Harry frowned even more.
Arguments then became inevitable at least twice a day: during breakfast and supper, the two meals father never missed and forced me to attend. Of course, I’m not one of those who stand by the truth at all costs, but even I couldn’t take this any longer. That’s when Mum decided that it would be better for me to live elsewhere.
“The flat’s mine, so is the bathroom,” Malfoy declared in the most arrogant way possible.
I watched him leave, thinking that Potter seemed far too calm. He didn’t actually enjoy my presence, did he?
Harry smiled to himself. Ron and Hermione were always fun to listen to when fighting.
“Close the door,” my new flatmate added as he ran down the stairs and strode away without even checking if I would actually lock up. I was already running late, so I swore to myself as the key refused to turn in the lock. I finally succeeded, dropped the key in my pocket and went to search for a place where I could Apparate unnoticed.
“We have to give him at least a month,” Potter frowned. “So that he doesn’t repeat it.”
We sat down and started eating, and I couldn’t help but think that living with Malfoy wasn’t too bad after all.
“That’s work, it’s completely different!”
“Calm down, Potter. Can’t you see it’s already occupied?” he said.
I shook my head. There’s no reason to lie to myself: my school friends were part of my past, as well as the careless years when my main preoccupation was the fact that Potter had a better broom and that Granger’s grades were higher.
“Sorry mate, didn’t know you had company,” Ron shrugged apologetically. “We arrived early and thought we’d stop by.”
After three hours of strolling through different stores I started to get Ron’s point. Clearly, Ron knew his girlfriend better than anyone else. Of course, Hermione had already bought a ton of useful stuff; Ron and I resembled pack-mules by now, but even I had to admit everything she had purchased was technically necessary.
“I’m off then,” Potter gave me a knowing look, but didn’t comment on my excuse.
“Not really.”
Harry heard muffled swearing followed by a crack of Disapparition and hurried into the living room. Draco was panting and clutching his head between his hands; Iris got up from the couch and tried to touch Draco’s shoulder, but he leapt away from her.
“For Merlin’s sake, what?” he snapped at the closed door.
Harry laughed and kissed him again. He had never seen Malfoy so close and was surprised to find out that he had freckles. It was nice and a little strange at the same time to note a detail like this.
“Don’t start, Malfoy,” Potter said in a warning tone. “Don’t joke with Auror training.”
I was half convinced that my large amount of conditions wouldn’t do for Potter and that he’d start arguing, but, to my surprise     , none of that happened.
“Can I have a beer, please?” he asked the barmaid, who was busy cutting cheese for the sandwiches. She was about forty years old, as far as Harry could tell, tall and plump.
“What about Alan Mann?” I changed the subject. “You said the other day that he was having a difficult time, but how do you know that, since you haven’t seen him yet?”
Confused, I tugged on the handle of the closed door. Locked? Why? I must admit, I was truly surprised to hear Malfoy’s voice from the other side:
“You are dodging the answer.”
Potter dropped his pack on the floor and sat in the armchair in front of the sofa.
“Did you get Alan Mann’s case? Don’t answer: I know you did. Malfoy, this is fate. We will definitely have to learn how to tolerate each other.”
“Oh.”
In about ten minutes we were already standing near one of the cafés in Diagon Alley, listening to the lady who had reported the theft. She was confused and a little scared; I understood from her fragmentary story that someone had stolen her bag while she was drinking her tea at Fortescue’s.
My thoughts wandered as I continued walking. I think one way or another I always imagined myself working in the Ministry, though maybe in a higher position. As father used to say: this is just a matter of time.
I came back home, opened to heavy door with my key and went into the living room. Malfoy was already there, lying on the sofa, reading something.
“Sorry, it’s really not about you,” Draco said. “Tony’s just pissed that I didn’t let them know I invited you to the party. It’s going to be fine, trust me. Oh, but you really should use the “they” pronoun with Tony. You can’t imagine the number of people who get this wrong, that’s where all of this is coming from.”
“Thank you, Tinky, you may go,” Malfoy said.
“I did, and so should you,” Malfoy smirked, without missing a beat.
It took two spells to warm the Florentine room he’d put his things in, but the beer helped him fall asleep right away.
Draco shrugged. “I’m lucky you showed up.”
“Distantly,” Harry admitted, put out. “By marriage. Of dead people. They disinherited Sirius, anyway.”
Harry clambered back up to his knees, determined to bury Draco in his stupid cloaks. They scrabbled against each other for another moment, Draco weak but warm, his body long and slight against Harry’s, his hair fisted in Harry’s hand like a handful of golden silk.
“We used to have horses,” Draco said suddenly, shading his eyes. He looked like he was miles away, seeing something from another time. “My dad got really into horse racing.”
In an echo of their initial kiss, Draco tipped his head forward and caught Harry again. It was sweeter, slower, and Harry felt like a hundred years had passed in between now and the one they’d shared upon his return home.
Despite the work it had taken to get Draco this far, Harry himself hadn’t put much planning into his idea. He had said it to be spontaneous, half-certain that Draco would say no immediately. While they’d redressed, he’d thought over a hundred places, of showing Draco Paris or Privet Drive, whirling through alleyways or awful memories. They could go anywhere, do anything, and that was too much to choose from. He wanted to give Draco a good impression of the muggle world, but in the end he’d rejected grand plans for the London Eye or the Eiffel Tower. He’d wanted to show Draco what the muggle world was to him.
Harry laughed, his confusion and tangled feelings finally evening out into something that made sense to him. “You’re so weak!” He shoved Draco back, and Draco threw a jacket into the air to climb over the pile for a better angle.
Then they heard the Floo, and Ron calling out, and the anxiety returned to his face. Harry rolled his eyes and took Draco’s wrist, tugging him along.
He came, of course, body shuddering down to earth in an instant.
“Christ.”
Soon, they could eat their sandwiches, sit tangled in fading bubbles and look out the enchanted window at the peacocks squabble and play. Soon Harry would tell Draco that his secret was out, that Ron and Hermione knew and were prepared to help. Soon, they would have the world open to them, and these days of being hidden away would feel precious in retrospect. But now there was just skin, warm and wet and new for discovering. Now there were kisses that felt like entire universes, Draco’s cautious yet growing in demand. Now Harry could grab and touch and
“I’m taking him home,” Harry insisted, and Draco snorted.
“You’re being weird.” It was like Quidditch: they were perfectly matched in the worst of ways. Back and forth with the intent to win until he could feel the exhaustion between them. Draco’s shirt had lost a button. Harry’s neck burned with bites. “You’ve been pulling away from me.”
“You don’t blame my dad?” Draco scoffed at him and handed the wine back. Harry brushed his wrist when he took it, holding Draco’s eyes.
“We go every week, he can come next week,” Ron said to her, lowering his voice as though Harry couldn’t hear.
and Hermione seemed pleased to have another collaborator.
Ron had promised to speak with Pansy, to bring her back to Grimmauld under the guise of partner bonding. He’d send word later on as to whether she’d go for it that night or put him off — he didn’t want to insist and risk her suspicion before anything could be safely said. It was going on two. They had a few hours of waiting, and enough antiness to fill every minute.
Hermione saved them, as always. She was lost to academic ramblings by her second cup of tea each day, and the looks Ron shot Harry around her hair felt like home.
“You might be,” he admitted, and Draco looked grimly back at him. His eyes were so, so grey.
“God, no, what a horrible concept. Can you imagine the old magic that would soak into the water? Death soup, I imagine. Besides, if the day ever comes where I see your Weasley in just trunks and freckles, I’ll Avada myself.”
Harry shrugged. “I can always eat. One of the few benefits of my childhood.” The air was starting to smell good, like meat and sweet apple, and Harry put together an egg wash before leaving for the lavatory. He lingered for a moment, so that when he came back in, Draco was spooning the cooked mixture into the dough-filled ramekins.
“Granger’s capable,” Draco said, though it sounded begrudging.
“I should have left you alone,” Harry argued.
“Very good.” Williamson stuck his hand out and Harry shook it. “This place looks better than before, by the way. Good, friendly magical energy on the scan apart from the Malfoy wand. Seems like you’ve been good for the place.”
, you were right, and
killed for being magical, and when you have to memorize your entire family tree, they don’t feel very far back.” He swallowed, and Harry looked for traces of the Malfoy he knew on an unfamiliar face.
“Thanks so much,” Draco cooed, his voice flinty with false gratitude. “I’m so glad you’re here to fuck with my house and talk to the Aurors for me.”
where he kept them,” Draco mumbled, his voice sluggish, though he perked up a bit when they started laying them out. Runok Ko, wizard’s chess, Snitch Snatcher… Draco touched the boxes with a reverence that spoke to their place in his childhood. It was still hard to imagine the Malfoys as a loving family, but the way that Draco had a favorite color for the chessboard implied volumes.
“Hide,” Harry decided, pulling his wand from the back of his beat-up jeans. “Go, it’s either for me or it’s nothing good.”
Through it all, Draco was silent, obedient. He seemed to have faded under the realisation of his fear, and he didn’t say a word as Harry signed his life away, checking Draco back out from the ministry like a particularly dangerous library book.
Harry followed Ron out to the hallway, where Ron had become fascinated by a landscape painting of Hippogriffs cavorting with racehorses. “Well?”
He didn’t mean it. He regretted it immediately. But fighting Draco Malfoy was an instinct that was far older than his truer, newer desire to agree. Moments ago he’d rocked down to give Draco everything, and now his deepest impulse told him to claw something back.
So the next day, when he saw Ron and Hermione off, it was a shock to see the day’s headlines. The Apparition point was a newsstand on the corner of Canon Row and Bridge Street, charmed to mask the sight of anyone slipping inside from those passing back and forth to Westminster Station. Hermione let herself in, and then Ron, and they peered out at Harry from a frame of glamour magazines and tabloids.
“Oh, he’s dead,” the man said, sounding certain. “Foolish to think everyone will leave an easy-to-find body behind, isn’t it? Probably got fed to You-Know-Who’s snake or something.”
“I suppose,” Draco admitted, and Harry’s heart sang
“Of course you are.” Draco flapped his hand. “You know you are. You’re going to work with that blond idiot, and you’ll fuck off back to your Weasels, and I’ll just be the ghost that haunts your second home. It’s all very Pureblood of you, honestly. And me, if I die soon and do it properly.”
“Come off it,” Harry whispered back. “The Aurors that came over this morning would have detected something.”
Draco smiled at him. Lately his lips were always fresh-chewed, his eyes always packed with exhaustion, but this dream Draco was as fresh and perfect as cool milk. He was beautiful, and Harry said so - or meant to, and then somehow Draco knew. He smiled with teeth whiter than his face, eyes squinting into grey tangles of eyelash. “Fucking Potter,” he sighed, still smiling.
. “Your pal Umbridge made me do this one. And I got at least one concussion every year — Madame Pomfrey said she’s not even sure if she Healed them all, the rate I kept getting knocked out.” There were more, little marks of Dudley’s bullying and the years of Quidditch and even more years of fighting, fighting, fighting. But most had smoothed back into the umber of his skin over the years, magicked away or healed with time. Compared to the weight of his invisible scars, Harry barely even noticed them.
“Well spotted, maybe your giant friend managed to teach you
Hermione suppressed a grateful yawn, nodding into the back of her hand. “Let’s shall.”
He banged through the sitting room, the kitchens, the downstairs bathroom. No one answered him, and he as he started up the stairs, he was filled with a horrible sense of deja vu. It had been a couple months now since one day had brought so much stomach-clenching panic.
Neville thought a moment, scratching his chin. His baby fat had all melted away by now, and the beginnings of a beard gathered at his throat. “I don’t love it for you, obviously,” he said reluctantly. “I hate to go against you, bud, but it’s
“What’s going on between you two?” she hiss-whispered, catching his arm with a hand that boasted bloodred nails the color of her robes. Her skin was so pale as to make the vibrancy startling, and Harry wondered for the hundredth time if keeping the Slytherins underground was one of Hogwarts’ best ideas. “Draco wouldn’t say in front of everyone, but it’s not nothing.”
“Good to see you,” he managed. Hermione owed him.
Apart from the books, there wasn’t much sign of a personality in Draco’s room. Harry lingered at a chest of drawers, touching each thing atop it: a vial of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion, a bowl of bizarre candy that was mostly blood-flavoured lollipops and peppermint toads, and a potted plant with a little floating cloud hovering above it, raining slightly.
He ripped the shrubs down entirely, hacking away each curlicued serif with no little satisfaction. Fuck that M, fuck everything it had stood for. Instead he dug up the dirt with a spade and his hands, ripping seed bags open and dumping them into the ground. He felt a little manic and a whole lot pleased, although the temptation to take his clothes off again was strong. Surely Hermione would worry about him now, hair all in a tumble, soil on his sweater, surrounded by strips of bushes and cut by their thorns.
“I just don’t understand how someone could try to kill themselves,” Hermione confessed, as she and Harry tidied up that evening. They’d cleaned the bathroom and patched the wall that Ron had taken his pain out on. Apparently the books weren’t a part of the drama Harry had missed - as the only one of them who had made up her mind to positively go back to Hogwarts for another year, Hermione was merely beginning her two-month slow-burning crisis of which books to pack.
This time Harry listened, and for the first time he realized that the plan involved him. It was simple enough, though: he would renounce full ownership of the Manor legally, with Draco signing to accept partial ownership. However, as soon as his Legalwizard filed the paperwork, the Ministry would be alerted. Draco was officially still missing, presumed dead, and a living signature would trigger an investigation that was sure to lead to his arrest. The Ministry hadn’t yet tried him for his crimes, and they were bound to, with all the chaotic publicity that a re-emerged Death Eater was sure to attract. Ron and Pansy’s job was to bring Draco in themselves, something Draco was clearly edgy about as he and Hermione discussed it, and the timing truly was everything.
Which opened up his property to next-of-kin.
“I forgot.” Harry remembered the vision, Voldemort forcing Draco’s shaking hand. “Sorry about that.”
It was a long shot, Harry knew. But he’d had a spark of inspiration that he wasn’t about to ignore. He wanted to give Draco his freedom back, give him a gift he’d never been given, wanted to test their new relationship away from its containment to see if it stuck. So he said “what about the Muggle world?” and waited for the response.
After a quick pint, he walked the pair down to Gringotts as they finished regaling him with stories of the parties he’d missed. Apparently Alicia Spinnet was pregnant, and Seamus had started seeing a Muggle, and Ginny had been accepted into a writing apprenticeship in Brooklyn. The last one threw him. It seemed like something he should have heard from Ginny, should have known she was considering, but it
“They do,” Harry confirmed, though a little dryly. “Books, too, even.”
Making a post-sex sandwich with Draco Malfoy may have been the weirdest experience of Harry’s life, and in his short existence, he’d had more than a few weird experiences.
“I’ve seen enough.”
Ron sighed and kicked back. “I caught him out by Grimmauld, leaving the cinema. I tried to call Pansy, but she was here with Savage and Williamson. It’s been fighting ever since.”
Draco shrugged and shifted, exposing the mess behind him.
Harry was a little nervous about looking into the pantry, assuming the Malfoys would have half a rack of Muggle waiting for their guests to feast on. He was surprised to see it open to a perfectly-stocked series of shelves, though: veg, meat, dairy, wine, even a chocolate torte, all sorted onto appropriate shelves and cushioned with individual temperature spells. It must be restocking magically. Lucky for him.
Torture and dying and then Harry singing in the shower. Dark secrets and Harry jerking off at night and screaming peacocks and Harry telling Pansy
“Hmm.” The shopkeeper looked thoughtful, but shrugged reluctantly as he met Harry at the cash register. “Not much in any of the papers, to be honest, past the bodies being discovered and that short series about the boy going missing.”
They didn’t get out of the tub for hours, and when they did, Harry’s fingertips were wrinkled and Draco’s throat was bruised.
It was a light, quick brush of lips, but Harry was left smiling when Draco drew away, and Draco had started to look less anxious.
“Yeah?” Draco rubbed his hands together, looking shy, and reached for the bag of snacks and magazines at their feet. “I’d like that. This was a good belated birthday idea.”
Over the weekend he had been distracted, too angry with Draco to regret the decision to punish him. Worried about h him since he’d given up the Aurors, Ron had kept Harry busy with a steady stream of snack foods and Quidditch drills and sending owls for the party. Ginny had agreed at once to the idea, and she and Dean arrived at Grimmauld early with a box full of red and gold streamers.
She nodded, locking solemn eyes on him that he could never see without remembering the chill of the Chamber and the pumping of poison through his veins. And then they left, too, and only Ron and Hermione remained.
“We’re all going through a lot.” Draco set his broom aside to dry. “I, for example, have new insight into your orphan status.”
, it’s the most at home I’ve ever felt. I want to fly in the morning and drink at night and argue about what to eat for dinner. I want your stupid tantrums and your magic fish and I want to fight with you and watch you watch movies and I would
“No wonder Voldemort liked it here,” he said out loud. They’d shared a soul and a mind once — hell, Tom Riddle had even stolen away his girlfriend for a year. And if they could have so many big things in common, maybe liking the Manor could be one more little one.
It took four hours, twelve signatures, and four more arguments ranging from hallway spats to furious facedowns, three and four at a time. Veritaserum was pulled out, put away, administered — to Draco, Pansy, Harry. Malfoy’s family lawyer was looked for, found in Azkaban, and summarily dismissed. Legalwizard Shafiq was called, and Ron and Pansy and Hermione were sent home. Threats were made and matched. Williamson accused Harry of writing pardons with his dick, Savage and Robards raised their eyebrows, and Harry blew up a desk.
They got on the lift alone, and Harry turned to Hermione as it burped and spun sideways to the proper floor. “I don’t know what to do. What can I do?”
“Of course there are.” Draco lifted the bottle to his pointy nose and inhaled deeply, taking an equally deep swig before handing it over. He shuddered, watching Harry take his own swallow — it was like wood smoke and honey, and it burned a stripe down his throat. He nodded, and Harry took another gulp before holding it back out. “God, it’s good to be out in the open. I was starting to believe I really was dead.”
He tried to school his thoughts into some semblance of order. As usual, Draco had him confused about how he felt and what he thought and what they were really fighting about. He was sorry, he was angry, he was upset, and he didn’t know who to aim it at. “I’m not saying I wasn’t. But we can’t hide forever. Eventually you have to make some kind of life, and I have to go back to mine.”
He told her about Mrs. Weasley’s new attempt at summer knittings, the light sweater wrapped in cooling charms. Hermione dug out Hagrid’s rock cakes for Hannah to try as well, laughing at the look on her face. “Dip it in your tea,” she advised, letting hers sink to the bottom of her mug to soak.
Harry dragged some of the blankets to the floor, dropping the nest’s stack of pillows in place beside the not-a-closet-door. He Summoned a glass of water, boosted the heat, and settled in.
“You’re lucky you didn’t have a family,” Draco groused, his casual cruelty making Harry laugh for once.
,” Hermione sighed. “I miss
She shook her head. “Even more of a reason not to go looking for him. You got his house, isn’t that good enough? Like, I’ll take a house, if people are handing them out.”
Then she turned her head on Draco’s shoulder, caught him staring, and sneered.
Instead he watched the peacocks and scooted a little closer to Draco. Draco leaned in, pressing his chest to the side of Harry’s shoulder. Harry held his breath until they were wedged solidly together, until he could smell Draco’s Quidditch sweat, until his heart settled back to beating.
“Mm,” Harry agreed, a little embarrassed now by it. “Mm-hmm.”
“Mm.” Draco squinted. “The mum thing is still weird.”
“Dean left them here!” she defended herself, shoving him over on the windowseat where he’d been watching out for food, “he thinks they’re artsy or some shit. Anyway, open the window.”
They tussled until Draco’s hair hung loose over his face and Harry’s pyjama pants were tented. Draco slid his hands past the drawstring, grinning, and they passed a delicious hour atop Draco’s desk, until the room smelled like sweat and spilled leather polish.
“You’ll squash them,” Draco hissed, and reached out to the ground where Harry had been about to kneel. There was nothing there, just a mass of leaves and vines, and then one stalk of green detached itself and climbed onto his pale fingers.
“Did you eat?” he asked after casting his cleaning spell, feeling totally off-kilter. His whole body was warm and sated and his mind was buzzing with a thousand thoughts. Surely Draco would think this was a mistake, but already Harry was wondering how and when and if he could kiss him again.
Harry went to the Weasley’s every morning after that, where he and Hermione would sit with Ron in the kitchen and whisper to each other. Ron was trying to keep his spirits up, but every day that went by, it seemed more and more wrong to have the Burrow feel so gloomy and empty. George was returning from St. Mungo’s soon, and Molly’s nervous energy seemed everpresent.
“Yeah, what are you even doing here? I thought you’d be at the manor.”
“With good reason, if you’re planning to leave at the first opportunity.” Draco sat down again, quite suddenly, as though he didn’t mean to. He dropped onto the edge of the armchair and reached for his own hair, shocking Harry slightly when he tangled it into some small percentage of what Harry’s must look like. On Draco, it was obscene. “Harry, I’m terrified, okay?”
“Harry Potter!” Two Aurors stood in the arched doorframe. They wore matching scarlet robes, but couldn’t have looked more different: he recognized Williamson, an ancient man with a riot of dreadlocks that were barely contained by his ponytail. The other was sandy blonde and tan, looking like an off-brand Australian Malfoy. He’d been the one to shout Harry’s name, and he followed it up with a wave of genial overfamiliarity, stepping over the door frame and clapping Harry on the back in the same gesture. It wasn’t an attack, but it didn’t help Harry relax any. “Good to see you, mate, good to see you.”
He was exhausted. Nothing like Draco looked — Draco looked how Harry ought to have expected, what with being dead. Harry looked him over, noting the bruises under his eyes, the strange sluggishness of his movement. It was like he was sick more than dead, really. Maybe a sickness had killed him.
“Malfoy?”
“What do you mean?” Ron asked trying for innocent, just as Hermione’s face hovered into view, robes in place but her hair even bushier than usual.
“Oh, um…” Harry tried bravely to think of anything he’d seen on the news lately, but he’d spent the summer playing Quidditch with Draco. “Not much.”
Neither of them had bothered to redress completely, and so it was in Draco’s tee shirt and silk boxer-briefs and Harry’s raggedy boxers that they assembled a sandwich that ran the length of an entire baguette. Harry stuffed one end with leftover scrambled eggs and burnt bacon ends, and Draco lined the other half perfectly with French tapenade, arugula, and sliced ham from a packet labeled Jamón Ibérico.
“Thanks,” he told her, and set the cider he’d been holding down on the mantle. “I’m really glad it dropped into my lap.” And if that wasn’t the understatement of his lifetime.
“He wasn’t charged with anything
“Are you sure? Muggles won’t know you.” But Harry was already pulling his wand out. He was half-convinced that Draco would back out still, and he didn’t want to give him an excuse to start spiraling. “Want to look like me?”
Harry didn’t know why he was surprised.
Ron waved his hand at the teapot, which floated over to pour her another cuppa. “On-campus? You don’t mean she went with Plan C?”
“No,” Harry tried, but it was too late: Draco had kicked his foot against the manor and pushed off, folding himself down into a stripe of speed.
“That was a different movie. He was a teen wolf in the other one, in this one he’s just got a friend with a time machine. It’s the car though, not a necklace.”
, as though it were a better vehicle for Harry’s power than his own wand. It must have been working in harmony with the house.
“Harry, this is fucking stupid,” Ron said, even as he helped.
“I’m training to be an Auror, what emergency calls for a tellyphone instead of Auror reflexes?”
“He protected you too, you know,” Harry pointed out, in a surprising surge of protectiveness for their former professor.
It was an awkward surge, a bump of noses that sent an arc of excruciating pain through Harry’s face. But Draco’s mouth was cool and stretched in a scowl that changed, subtly, into something softer.
Harry grinned. “Over here.”
Harry went straight to the kitchen for water and a slice of leftover pizza to gnaw on. Draco followed, though he acted like it was a coincidence that they had both wound up in the same room. He dug an oily-looking dessert liqueur out of the freezer and tipped it back.
until the tip of Draco’s cock slipped critically into him.
“War breeds orphans,” Hermione said darkly, when he mentioned it. Ron looked at her in alarm, but tipped back his beer without a word. They’d waited ten days after the final battle to truly believe it was over, twenty before they felt brave enough to go into the Leaky. Of course well-wishers had overwhelmed them there, so now they sat in a Muggle bar, three weeks of peace behind them and a whole lot of unknowns ahead.
Draco shook his head, blond strands moving and then sticking to his cheek where a shine belied his sweat. “I hate potions.”
“Standard, I assure you,” Legalwizard Shafiq said, nodding at him. Young, small, and solidly-built, she was incredibly professional: not only had she allowed Harry to introduce himself without fawning all over him, but she had yet to blink an eye about the strangeness of the circumstances. “Common in all familial claims, distant or not.”
It was still early afternoon, so they ate more than they drank, and Harry’s stomach was pleasantly full by the time they spilled back out onto the street.
“What then?” he dared ask, swallowing a sigh when Draco’s eyes went bright and beady. “We could do a slide into the dungeons, like a swimming pool thing.”
“You said you didn’t want to leave before,” Draco challenged. “You practically promised. But you clearly can’t wait to pack up.”
,” Harry murmured, his heart sore, and he ran his palm across Draco’s jaw, thumb catching. The kiss was slow and sweet, Draco’s lashes brushing against Harry’s  cheek until Harry drew back to see his eyes flutter open, his expression uncertain but rapidly becoming sure.
“That’s rotten luck, mate,” Ron said, coming back into view. “I guess I could pop round, then, as you’re staying.”
“We should do little feeding stations,” Harry mused, peering over the side of the rug.
Harry ripped through the house like a silver bullet. He kept seeing Molly’s face, Ron’s wet hair, Malfoy’s blue hands in the water.
It was daylight now, for one thing, and while he hadn’t quite still been drunk the night before, he was straightforwardly sober now. Draco looked nervous again, the way he had on the streets of London, and Harry reached out to clasp his wrist on instinct, before those nerves made him say something mean. They both glanced down, seeing the loose grip, the stark difference in their coloring. It wasn’t the touch that was shocking, really, it was just… being
“Aurors came by this morning? Did they say something to make you change your mind?”
They’d touched down in the small clearing that Harry favored, around the back of the manor by the conservatory and a Victorian stone bench. The pond he’d moved the koi from looked inviting in the warmth of the day, an oval of cool water surrounded by long, sweet grass.
been his own. He wanted to tell them about the aching fear he’d been feeling lately, whenever he thought about signing up to center the rest of his adult life around combat and curses. But he didn’t know how to say it.
for the thing that had always, ineffably, bound him to Draco Malfoy.
“Has — what?” Harry had to wipe his mouth with the back of his hand. He’d almost spat his beer out, and his friends looked on him with bright amusement.
“I almost was Slytherin,” Harry volunteered, after they’d sat in peace for a moment, taking in the mess. “The Hat wasn’t sure.”
Harry rather thought the world was safer than Draco was implying, but the panic that had kicked into both of them with a knock on the door stopped him. “I’ll find out about your account,” Harry promised. “I can ask the Ministry, and I’ll make sure you have access to it if you’re worried.”
“Houses can’t be evil,” Harry spat, feeling his anger escaping, the monster in his chest unwinding from sleep. “And I’m
The war had been over a month before anyone realized Draco Malfoy was missing.
want you to be alive. But I also want you to
“Do you hate having me here?” It took all of his courage to say it. How could the answer be no, and yet he didn’t want it to be a yes. Draco just snorted and rolled over. The blankets shifted, a triangle of space appearing that was just wide enough for him to peer through. In the warmth of the firelight, his eyes were almost amber.
“It’s definitely weird,” Hermione assured him, but she seemed to relax a little. “But you own it now, so maybe it’s a good way to start its next chapter. Besides, when we had your birthday here at Grimmauld, I had a half-dozen people texting me about finding the place.”
“You can’t be serious.”
“Not really.” Draco scratched his wrist. Harry had turned his hair into a mess, and it sat at all angles, looser and longer than Harry had ever seen it. “I feel better than I did before you came. Eating better. Now I know the world hasn’t exploded out there. But this is as far as I can go, isn’t it? It’s all reliant on you now. You feed me, you bring me pain potions—”
