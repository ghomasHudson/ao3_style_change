"I hope you'll realize we need to keep what happened between ourselves, of course." Draco interrupts. "Can't have people finding out now, can we?" He winks at Potter, and then immediately berates himself.
So at around nine that evening they walk up to the observatory of the tower, both of them dressed simply; Harry is wearing Muggle clothing and Draco has on robes. After
Draco stops, follows his gaze. “Mmm, and have her take away points because of me interrupting her? Is my position as most hated person here not fresh enough in people’s minds, you want me to remind them?”
Harry meets his eyes for a second before his gaze drops to Draco's throat, his eyes trailing up to his lips, and knows he can't risk starting something in a dare he won't want to finish. There’s still too much that’s new that he has to think through before beginning- or continuing- whatever is going on with him and Malfoy.
“A snake.” Harry repeats, half-listening, running his thumb over the mark, taking in the snake coiled through the skull to hang down from it.
“I’m sorry.” Harry says after Draco trails off. “I’m sorry that I’m asking, I know I said I wouldn’t try and force you to come out to your parents or to anybody you didn’t want to. But it’s not just about that. It’s not just about you or me. And us hiding what we are- Jesus, Draco, we’ve never even given this a
Draco snaps out of whatever thoughts have taken him over and turns to her, a look of clear detachment on his face. “I wasn’t aware that I had.”
His own hands move up to Draco’s chest, and one of them gasps, and then the other manages to slip their tongue into their mouth, and before Harry knows what has happened he’s half-straddling Draco’s lap.
He pulls away when he needs to breathe, feeling warm and alive, eyes searching the wizard in front of him desperately. There are words that want to fall from his mouth but his tongue won’t move, his mind can’t work to put the letters in their right order and he can only stare. Stare and touch, holding on with a grip that is both nervous and certain, tight like a vice with no intention of ever letting go.
“Do you think you two will grow up and live happily ever after together?” Now Blaise’s voice is cruel. “You think you’ll get married and have some kids and that’s it?”
to everybody else. My mother still gets hate mail every day and I still get curses aimed at me in the hallways and our mail gets screened and that’s just how it is. That’s how it’s always going to be. So yes, I have gotten into the habit of putting up Shield charms any time I leave my dorm, Potter, because otherwise I will end up in the hospital wing and this year, with the grades I need, I can’t afford to miss even a day of schoolwork, alright?”
All of Harry’s worries about going back to Draco because it might be seen as- as manipulative, or unhealthy, are unfounded. What they’ve been doing since Hogwarts is unhealthy, Harry can see that now. But each of them want to be together. They’ll fight, because everyone does, but they will make up. They won’t lie to each other any more. It will all be worth it because the things Draco gives Harry more than make up for the times he had and would hurt his feelings.
Finally his eyes fall on a picture of Cedric Diggory and something in Draco twists a bit. He feels Harry come up to stand beside him and he obviously follows Draco’s gaze.
Hogwarts. His first Christmas as a wizard was spent here and this time there’s no Nicholas Flamel to look up or mysteries to solve.
This time Harry catches the faint hint of disappointment in her features as she nods at him. Then she forces a smile, which is small but understanding and true.
The rest of the week there are more examinations but not for Harry or Draco. Hermione and Millie have Arithmancy and that’s all Harry knows of. Tomorrow is the last day of term with the Farewell Feast and then everyone will be going home.
Pansy, for instance comes and sits with him in the Common Room the same day as the Potions incident.
Draco looks almost panicked and Harry glances down and sees his own chest heaving. He wonders how long they’d been kneeling there, in the middle of their friends, snogging each other. Longer than the others surely. It had felt like minutes, which is definitely more than anybody else, even the couples in the room.
“I would like to offer you these positions, respectively.” She has put her glasses back on and now stares at them both over the tops of them. It’s eerily similar to something Dumbledore used to do and Harry’s eyes flicker up to the portraits behind the Headmistress, all of whom are watching them both carefully.
“I’m being whisked off to Paris.” Pansy says. “So I don’t really have anything to complain about except for the fact my parents will be harping on to me about finding a husband.”
There’s no reason this should feel as exciting as it does, Harry knows, but Jesus, he’s hardening in his underwear as Draco stands there just outside of the stall in front of him, mostly naked and freshly awake. There’s a faint pink blush starting at the other boy’s cheeks but that makes Harry’s mouth go dry.
Harry sighs, runs a hand through his hair and Draco’s own fingers twitch again, this time wanting to flatten it.
He remembers them falling asleep side by side, just watching one another silently. He’d still had his glasses on at the time so where…?
“Yeah, well.” Draco shifts and changes the subject. “You look nice, Hermione. I hope Ronald has been fawning over you accordingly.”
It’s not all perfect. Though both of them are happier than ever now, and Harry is sure of that, there is always a weight to Draco. An insecurity that Harry is desperate to make disappear forever. Even if Draco never says anything about it, Harry knows him well enough now that Draco doesn’t have to. He can see it for himself.
His heart sinks. Probably for the best. Maybe now it will be another two and a half years before they see one another.
Harry grins at the mental picture. Lily has the amazing habit of being able to sleep anywhere, something neither he nor Draco shared.
“Well there were a few.” Ginny admits. “One was whether you and Harry were together in Eighth Year. Only Neville, Pansy and I said no because you were both so adamant, we thought there was no way you two couldn’t have told us-anyway.” Luna, Millie, Theo and Blaise exchange grins. “Another was on when exactly you got together- which reminds me, when was it?”
When she meets his eyes, she looks suddenly upset. “You never told me what you were working to do that whole year. You only said you were lonely and under pressure and that nobody would understand.”
Harry’s face shutters. “Not great. I keep dreaming- well. It’s always things I’ve lived through before. People dying, memories of my parents, of the others. But it’s okay.”
flavour, it isn’t quite like every-flavoured beans) and Teddy a stuffed dragon that breathes short bursts of fire (that couldn’t burn). By the time they decide to stop for lunch at the
He should feel sympathetic, he knows. Obviously Harry is going to say no and Romilda’s dreams will be crushed.
“Yeah. Yes, absolutely.” Harry says and then cringes as Draco quirks an eyebrow. “No, really I am. I don’t know why that came out so forced.”
Having Teddy has done her good though, Harry has to say. Not only is he growing up in a place where he has the total care and attention of one person, but it has pushed Andromeda to open up again and develop new relationships since the passing of her husband and daughter.
Harry feels the stomach fall out of him and tries not to feel too disappointed. “Oh, erm… thank you. I’m sure I’ll-”
“Did I forget to mention the other part of your Christmas present?” He asks innocently while feeling anything but.
Draco looks at the fire, ignoring her stare. "Most of the mail we received this summer wasn't complimentary," he says eventually. "We burned most letters without opening them."
He swallows, looking into his tea. “I know you don’t like Draco. Or the others, but I know Draco’s the worst. And I can’t blame you. Before I thought I hated him too. I did, I think, honestly, maybe more than anyone. But even when we were on opposite sides of the war, even when he did things I couldn’t understand, when he watched his family hurt us… I don’t think I would ever have done the same, but I can understand why he did. It’s not okay, what happened, but he knows that. And he regrets it. You should see him sometimes. He’s so full of pain and guilt and regret, and he thinks we can’t see it but we do…”
“Yeah.” She looks back out the window and he moves forward to stand beside her again, taking in her face. She’s contemplative, and he watches as she moves to sit on the wide window ledge that is more than big enough for the two of them to have a conversation.
He is definitely overthinking it, Harry realizes, and knows he’s right when his eyes lift up to see Draco smiling at him.
The two of them could go back to how it had been a few weeks ago; letting Ron mediate everything between them, never daring to be alone together. Avoiding one another like they’ve been doing for years.
“Good morning.” Harry says and he tries to keep some of his excitement at bay because- why is he even excited? Apart from the fact that it’s Christmas and-
He also remembers what Harry had told him months ago, about him needing somebody to bring him out of his own head. When Draco thinks back on all of their conversations, about the war, about their history, Voldemort, Dumbledore, even a few tentative mentions of their parents, he realizes Harry probably opens up to him more regularly about hard subjects than he had with Ginny.
"Ah." Draco hums in understanding and drops the tie between them on the bedcovers, turning his head to look at Harry. His eyes are sad and heavy. "We were both rather awful that night, weren't we?"
“Damn, I thought I was right about that one. I was sure he was planning to kiss you senseless again.”
He still hears them talking about Harry sometimes, even though they do make an effort to stop when they notice him listening; if they aren’t feeling particularly awful, that is. There’ve been countless nights of them all trying to find out what had happened that have ended with him storming away and slamming a door behind him to keep them out. Anytime they got drunk, anytime they reminisced about Hogwarts, anytime something new had happened in Harry’s life that they thought he might be interested in hearing about (despite the fact that the
He’d purposely told Ron to come an hour later than the rest, just because he’d wanted some liquid courage before seeing Harry. But then he’d had one shot and felt like he’d been about to be sick, so instead Draco has spent the whole time sulking and trying to distract himself by chatting to the others or dancing.
“Hey there you are!” The dark-haired wizard says happily. “I’ve been looking for you, you practically ran out of that Potions exam.”
Harry notes the process Malfoy goes through to ground himself. The way his shoulders roll backwards, how he blinks twice quickly and then once again a few seconds later. One more appraisal of Harry and his outfit and then there’s a hint of something soft at the corners of Draco’s mouth.
“Yeah.” Harry blows out a long breath and looks up at the canopied ceiling. “She was pretty much my only friend when I was back with the Dursley’s.”
Harry snaps his mouth shut but can’t help but feel a bit satisfied at the look on Draco’s face. They go up to the dorms in silence and then as soon as the door is closed behind them and they see nobody else is in the room Draco is turning around and pushing Harry back against the door, mouth moving hungrily against Harry’s and making his heart race.
Harry’s eyes trail over the books without much interest, only paying them enough attention to notice they are there at all before his eyes move to the large Slytherin green bed, the dark desk and chair in the corner, the large fireplace and the door leading to the
“Draco.” Harry’s tone becomes one of surprise and then wary hopefulness. “What- what are you doing here?”
“That’s okay.” Harry hurriedly reassures, moving a bit closer to stand awkwardly in front of Draco’s desk. “How are you doing?”
Her mouth works and he knows it’s probably painful for her to resist saying whatever she’s thinking. Instead she just nods towards the bottle. “It’s your go.”
“Listen,” Ginny says suddenly, voice soft. “We know that whatever happened back then between you two was bad. And we won’t pry.”
Draco frowns. “Harry, what the hell are you talking about? If anyone should be mad or freaked out it should be
“Fuck.” Draco exhales and something deep in Harry clenches at the word dripping from Draco’s tongue. “Do you know how long I’ve been imaging what your dorm looks like? What your bed must look like?”
To twitch and fill, hardening until Draco has to shift or else he'll go mental. So he pulls away. Somehow without him realizing they have moved closer to his bed, so that Harry is partially leaning back against one of the corner posts of the fourposter, and he finds Harry’s proximity to it very distracting.
“I don’t know,” Draco says with forced lightness, mind racing to try and figure out what Harry could have been about to say. “I thought this was a pretty interesting- umph.”
He stumbles out of bed, going to the bathroom and brushing his teeth before grabbing his bathrobe and heading downstairs.
Worry that this friendship they’ve all struck up with the Gryffindors is going to disappear in the blink of an eye. He knows it’s not like that, not with any of them, but sometimes Draco feels the weight of seven years of hatred, animosity and rivalry. When he compares all of that to this year, a year that seems plucked straight from his wildest and most unrealistic dreams, he finds it hard to believe this will last.
Blaise looks between them both before stepping back. The movement seems strangely decisive. “Right then. Careful Draco, you don’t want McGonagall catching you.”
The bitterness Harry feels is forcefully pushed aside. “That’s really nice, Draco.” He hesitates. “Look, you know I’ll never love your dad, but I am sorry you won’t get that this year. Honestly.”
to the train station and he has no intention of letting her know. He’s sure she’s had one up for just as long.
He looks into Draco’s eyes and sees the man already looking at him, eyes bright and happy. There’s a wide grin on Draco’s face and Harry knows he’s not the only one feeling the thrill thrum through his veins.
He swallows, hearing the familiar reprimand in Harry's voice instead of hers. "I don't know what to do," he says finally, barely whispering. "It hurts."
Draco stops, and swallows. "Poor you, one House out of four doesn't love you. Not even a full House either, because the younger years trail after you like lost puppies, don’t think I've not noticed that."
Draco slips an arm around him immediately, pulling them even tighter together and moving in short, sharp thrusts within Harry. Every twitch nudges Harrys prostate and soon the sounds coming out of his mouth are completely incoherent and the arm against the wall falls so his fingers link with Draco’s.
It’s only a week, Harry reminds himself, but he meets Draco’s eyes and sees the conflict there as well. They’ll miss each other.
“Finally, if you’d wanted a shag you should have found a better spot…” Ron’s voice trails off when he sees who’s in the closet and both of their eyes widen in disbelief when they see it’s Draco and Harry.
“No.” Draco agrees, wrongfooted. “I- nice speaking to you.” His eyes drift over to Snape. “Goodbye, sir.”
“At graduation?” Harry presses. “Once we both have permanent jobs? Steady income? I hope it’s not when the press stops being interested in either of us, because we both bloody well know that will never happen.”
“I would.” Draco whispers hotly. “You know I would. You could have me on my knees in seconds any time you wanted, no matter who was there.”
Hands come up to rest on hips. “I did in fact, and no there wasn’t one. If this person had been watching our mail the entire year it is entirely plausible it is a forgery done by hand.”
Draco flinches but it doesn’t stop him. “You do though. I haven’t changed, not really. If I had I wouldn’t be here instead of somewhere else moving on with my life.”
“That’s because she’s bloody terrifying.” Draco says after swallowing a bite of potato. “Got any other examples or can we eat now?”
“Okay, okay.” Harry holds up his hands in surrender. “If I felt a bit more awake I could probably pay attention, but right now your words are wasted.”
Harry has been told he’s forgiving, and he thinks he probably is, but there is too much history here for him to suddenly be comfortable with Draco’s parents. He can be civil and even kind to Narcissa, possibly Lucius too, but he doesn’t think he will ever forgive them. Certainly he will never forget what they’ve both done.
"We fought about the Holyhead Harpies last week," Harry tells her weakly, because he does know what she's talking about, and she smiles.
“Uh huh.” She sounds disbelieving, but not exactly unhappy or disagreeing, and all the while Harry internally panics, his eyes shooting to Draco.
“Sorry, I seem to be missing the part where you went bloody mental,” Ron says to the two of them, ignoring the students filing around them. “Can one of you refresh my memory? Was it before or after you killed Voldemort?”
“I have chosen you.” Draco says hushed. “And I do want to tell our friends, yes, and my parents eventually, but the rest of the world? It has nothing to do with them.”
Harry stands uncertainly with everyone else but then Luna is striding over to Ginny and Pansy has gone to Ron, so slowly Harry walks over to Blaise, wiping the hand not holding the gift nervously on his robes.
Draco shrugs. “To be fair this is the first time anyone’s really seen us together outside of going to and from classes. It gives a different impression.”
She lets him widen the space between them. “If you and Harry can’t make up then I’m letting you know it won’t affect the rest of us. We’re all still going to be friends.”
“I’m fine.” He lets Harry go and looks back at her to raise an eyebrow. “Should we talk about this?”
So he pulls away and twists himself to reach between the bed and the wall, hand digging under the edge of the mattress before removing a bottle.
Narcissa takes them in swiftly, eyes going from Draco to Harry and then to the bed, making Harry freeze in fear, but she doesn’t linger on it and her face doesn’t change. He lets out a breath of relief.
“He shouldn’t tell the world because it’s what I want. It should be because he wants it. And what if it does blow up in our faces? What if we do tell a few more people but someone slips up, or the two of us get caught like we did with you? Just because Draco’s willing to do it, that doesn’t mean it’s smart. Or what’s best for him.”
Slowly he walks towards Draco. The air is a bit cool and Harry waves a hand, mindlessly turning the tap on the shower to hot behind him as he closes the distance between their bodies to just a few inches.
A small part of him does get ready for something like that. But the larger part lets last night replay in his head again, the kissing, the drinking, the laughter. All of it shared between the four Houses. By the end of the night it hadn’t been Slytherins, Gryffindors, Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, but all of them together. Just Hogwarts students.
Hermione had told him he’s searching for stability, for something that hasn’t changed to get some comfort from it.
“Alright.” Harry breathes, and Draco’s smile widens before he slowly bends forward to kiss him again with his heart racing.
“You can’t stop me.” Draco wrenches his wrist away and turns around to glare at Harry. “This shouldn’t have happened.”
Blaise’s brown eyes turn soft with understanding. Sympathy fills in every crack of his expression. “Oh, Draco. Don’t tell me you love him.”
Harry wouldn’t have thought so but Draco’s expression… he wouldn’t have been so nervous for just anything. He made Harry mad all the time and usually only laughed it off and teased him for being sensitive. This had been different.
He’s up and out of his chair in an instant and Draco cranes his neck to follow him as he goes to stand in front of a pedestal. On top of it stands an adolescent phoenix.
"Look," Harry turns back to the two of them. "I'm not his friend. We just sit together in a couple of classes and manage not to throttle each other, alright? Don't worry about it."
.” Harry comes too, powerfully and with a deep groan, with Draco’s name falling letter by letter off of his lips as he pulls him as close to his body as possible, filling him up.
He looks over sharply in time to see Hermione jostle her way through a few strangers, all of whom hastily jump back to give them space. Ron trails her with a friendly smile, as does his parents, and Draco feels his stomach swoop suddenly.
When he comes to again it’s to the sound of somebody downstairs in his kitchen and he tenses. But then he hears Hermione’s voice, quiet, but definitely hers, as she sings along with the radio. It causes him to sit up so quickly it makes him groan and squeeze his eyes shut again.
Draco had been expecting it, what with the invitation coming so last minute, but he can’t deny that he’s a bit disappointed.
He quickens his strokes, adding a twist of his hand at the end of each one, and Draco is shifting his hips and clutching Harry’s shoulder, fingers digging in. His breathing is wrecked, his face and neck splotched red with an uneven flush and Harry thinks that he’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
Horror flashes across Blaise’s face. “Oh Merlin and Morgana, you two were finished, weren’t you? I didn’t… interrupt you.”
“I-” Draco grimaces, looking embarrassed. He runs a hand through his hair, mussing it up further. Harry’s hands twitch. “I’ve been trying to apologize. To everybody. And I haven’t apologized to you yet.”
“She fully expects me to tell you who I have since apparently I tell you everything these days, and I absolutely refuse to comply.”
“We’ll certainly have more than you two!” Blaise cries and then Draco and Harry reach the top of the stairs and round the hallway to make their way to the leaking bathroom.
Draco can’t help but laugh at the on-the-spot look Harry wears as he freezes at Ginny’s words. Ron swivels his head around to glare at Potter.
“Hermione, please.” His tone is slightly begging but he doesn’t care. “We’ve been over this. Hundreds of times. I can’t stand him, he can’t stand me, and he’s made that very clear. It’s better for everyone if we just keep ourselves separate. It might not be ideal, but it’s working, and certainly better than the alternative.”
Harry meets Luna's eyes after glancing at Ron and Hermione uncomfortably. Hermione gives him a helpless look back.
"Yes," Harry nods repeatedly. "Brilliant. I mean that's- great, good." He stops and takes a breath, and Draco ignores the way Potter's eyes have lit up. "I'll see you there then."
“Oh we will!” Blaise shouts after him and Draco flips him two fingers behind him before shutting the door soundly.
He shrugs in response, a small knot forming in his stomach. “I suppose to her he’ll always be baby Fred. You know. Considering.”
Looking at Hermione, Draco thinks perhaps he’s been a little harsh with her. He’d seen from the outside when Ron and Harry hadn’t been speaking in Fourth Year. Everyone had known about Hermione and Ron’s spats in Sixth, even Draco, who was completely uninterested at the time because he’d had his own problems to deal with. And Harry has told him about Ron leaving him and Hermione when they’d been on the run during Seventh Year and how sad Hermione had been.
Draco does manage a smile then, feeling himself gain strength and confidence from the other wizard. There’s no way Harry is as unconcerned as he’s making it seem, but Draco appreciates him putting on a brave face for his sake.
When he listens in closer he hears Harry saying, “-and they’ve been my best friends since we were all eleven, can you believe that-”
The party is in the Main Hall right beside the Ministry and the decorations are even more elaborate than last year. A huge towering Christmas Tree stands in the middle of the room and ribbon, tinsel and fairy lights are strung all across the ceiling. When Harry looks up he sees snowflakes falling throughout the  strands of decoration but it all disappears before hitting anyone’s heads or shoulders. There are tables of sugar cookies, gingerbread, shortbread, tablet fudge, chocolates, puddings and other treats. The drinks range from alcoholic to hot chocolate to Irn Bru to some kind of peppermint punch. Those tables take up an entire wall.
Grey eyes flicker up to meet his. "Do you-" He bites his bottom lip again and Harry's eyes immediately move to watch the movement. "Do you think he'd forgive me? If I... apologized." He clears his throat as his face flames. "Or something?" He waves a hand, as if expecting the gesture to embody his meaning.
And the rest of their group, Pansy and Hermione, Ron and Ginny, Theo and Millie and Luna and Neville, they learn to avoid the subject of Draco Malfoy around Harry. No matter how many times they ask him he avoids the question of what happened. As days go by he snaps at them less and less for bringing him up, because every day that passes he hears less and less about Draco and his new career as some Potion Master's star prodigy. He doesn't
Obviously not, he answers himself a moment later. Neither of them had intended this to be the way things were forever. In fact, looking back, Draco wonders if both of them hadn’t expected this thing to blow up in their faces months ago.
“Of course.” He agrees and goes to do as asked, answering all of Arthur’s questions on autopilot and listening to the others come inside from wherever they’d been, voices loud and laughter echoing.
Ginny is already being scouted by Quidditch teams and all that is left for her is choosing which offer she wants to accept. Harry can’t help feeling jealous, if only because he knows it’s the perfect thing for Ginny, at least for the time being.
She smiles in excitement. “Okay, I promise. Hope to die and everything.” She burst out into fresh giggles.
“No you can’t.” Draco says with a tone that brooks no argument. “I can take you. It isn’t an issue.”
"Strangely connected?" Ginny suggests, and Harry falls silent at the tone in her voice. The strange expression leaves her eyes and she gives his hand a pat. "Of course not dear." She reassures him in a way that reminds Harry strongly of her mother.
“And now you want to invite him to the Halloween party? Are you insane?” Ron hisses. “Do you value Hermione that little or are you just acting crazy because the war’s over and Voldemort’s gone, because I honestly don’t know anymore.”
released pictures and headlines on his sexuality and Harry's moving up in the ranks, despite his occasional recklessness. Before he knows it, he's unofficially Robards second in command, and the list of Death Eater's and Voldemort sympathizers is almost completely checked off and locked away in Azkaban.
"Well fairs fair, Potty, you want my Potions notes then I get help in Muggle Studies. Or is the Chosen One too good to help us lowly Slytherins? I bet you haven't done any work since the war, have you? Always those people offering to do it for you."
“No, it’s all- everything’s okay now. My parents are pretty pleased, actually, as weird as that is.” He feels his face screw up. “And there’s loads of ways for two wizards to have kids now. It was just… Voldemort and me being afraid. You know.”
Draco doesn’t say anything about his own first serious crush. He thinks he’s had enough embarrassment for a while, and Harry certainly didn’t need to hear that to stoke his ego.
“Really? I think about it all the time. What it would have been like if I’d accepted her offer to teach Potions. Or about whether I should now.”
Harry had been too stunned to do anything but nod and stammer. “I- yeah.” He’d cleared his throat. “Alright.”
“Oh there you all are!” Arthur Weasley’s voice carries to them and Draco whips his head up in time to see where Arthur has spotted Harry appear with Ginny, Luna, Neville and Pansy and Theo. The last two make Arthur flounder a bit. “Erm, we were just saying you’ll all have to get on the train soon.”
And all Harry had done after was stand there watching him go. Long enough to see the blonde head glance back once, quickly, and then turn away from Harry again before disappearing out of sight.
“I blame my own foolishness then, for waiting so long.” She shakes her head at her own thoughts. “Well, if either of you ever change your minds, please don’t hesitate to let me know.”
“I saw his face just before we left,” Pansy had said to Draco as he was finishing off his bottle of firewhiskey the night before. “If you two would just explain what the hell it was that
“God,” Harry’s voice is farther away and Draco opens his eyes again to see him kneeling on the bed between Draco’s splayed legs. His hand is coated in lube and jerking himself quickly, making Draco’s stomach tighten. “I’ll remember you looking like this forever.”
“Eager are we?” Harry teases and Draco feels an absurd rush of affection go through him at the silly teasing.
But tonight, Harry’s trying to ignore all of that. He moves quickly, ducking his head the entire way, careful not to run into anyone and cause a scene. The people here are more concerned with themselves than one random bloke and for that Harry’s grateful. Finally, after minutes of struggle he makes it to the bar and waits to wave down a bartender. The one nearest him has a spiky blue mohawk and Harry wonders if it’s magic or Muggle product that she uses to make it stay so straight for hours in a packed night club.
There are always ways to have children of course. Even Muggles manage it without magic. But they’re not tradition, and that’s what’s kept the Malfoy family alive for so long.
A minute passes before Scorpius looks up, blinking and looking around. Draco, Lily and James’ voices all carry distantly down to them and Harry watches as his middle child nods, sliding a bookmark in place. “Alright. Can I pick?”
Now he looks up at those black eyes and sees Severus already watching him. Like Dumbledore, he seems to be able to read Harry’s thoughts on his face.
“That simply isn’t true, my love.” She answers kindly. “Otherwise you’d be alone, like your father and I would be without each other and you. Draco,” her voice grows sterner when he opens his mouth. “I know what I’m talking about. So when I say I want you to use whatever benefit being Harry Potter’s friend gives you, I mean it. Not because I want you to use it selfishly, but because I know you’ll do good. Whatever leniency you get from being connected to him, whatever benefits, take them and use them in whatever way you think is best. Because you know what it’s worth better than anybody. You know the value forgiveness and kindness can have in someone’s life.”
“Two firewhiskeys please.” Harry says and then tilts his head towards Draco. “And whatever he’s getting too.”
Draco then acts very dignified and locks himself in his room for the rest of the day, getting his meals from the House Elves and trying to think everything through without causing himself to have a strop
He remembers what she’d looked like at Bill and Fleur’s wedding and the similarities make him smile.
“Harry!” Andromeda beams as she opened the door to him, grey hair escaping its short braid down her back.
“Then why?” Harry feels like screaming he’s so tired of repeating himself. He’s the one who wanted this conversation and now he’s tired of them having it over and over again. “What else is there?”
“You definitely can,” his mouth drags against Harry’s. “Potter, from now on you can ask for anything you damn well want.”
A poster of the Bulgarian Quidditch team takes up part of one wall and Draco flushes when Harry glances back in amusement, one eyebrow raised.
His heart is suddenly beating so fast and loud that Harry doesn’t know how it isn’t waking the other wizard up. His body is lethargic, slow to wake and Harry blinks blearily at Draco.
He hopes that the two of them will be able to make it through the school year without saying a word, but part of him knows that's impossible. Not after everything that's happened. Not knowing them.
“Yeah.” Harry says quietly. Draco remembers that night. The way Harry had been chasing the Death Eaters. Remembers Snape telling them all to go ahead while he stayed back to deal with Harry.
The rest of the afternoon seems to pass quickly, and before Harry knows it it’s getting near dinner and time for him to leave. Andromeda gathers Teddy and their things and bids them all a warm goodbye, promising to come back with him and visit soon, to which Narcissa happily agrees.
“Thank you.” He repeats in a strange and choked voice as he reaches out and takes a biscuit from the offered plate, feeling stupid.
“Nice day for it too,” Ron says. “Wasn’t sure what a fall wedding would be like, but I have to say it’s warmer than I pictured.”
“I don’t know.” Harry says eventually. “But even if mine is a bit… on the nose, it doesn’t mean everyone else’s is. What about people whose name means something like tree? Or- or crooked nose?”
“Nothing.” Harry looks away casually, ignoring his racing thoughts and reaching out to get some roast beef. “I just forgot how much of a suck up you were, is all.”
“Have fun you two.” Draco says slyly, making both Hannah and Parvati blush deeper as the two boys make their way out of the Room.
Potter rolls his eyes. "I know," he says back, a little more heated than before. "I was going to ask whether you wanted to study together later."
He notices Draco shoot him a look but it’s Luna who says it. “So that’s why you were using Draco’s wand.”
“Yeah but it’s Christmas. The day to be with loved ones and all that.” Donna winks again before handing Harry a handful of Floo powder and then turning to the fire herself. “I’ll tell her you’re stopping by later. Happy Christmas guys!”
It doesn’t matter that Potter’s smile is fake as he signs whatever they ask him to. The fact that Draco knows how much Harry hates all of it doesn’t change the jealousy and the regret mixing to form a dangerous concoction in his stomach.
Draco goes completely crimson. Harry feels his own blush warm his skin. “You’re fine,” he says at the same moment Draco snaps, “oh for Merlin’s sake, Blaise, just turn around, would you?”
He thinks over the past couple of months, back to their library sessions and bickering in classes. The way Malfoy rolls his eyes and sneers anytime he sees Harry surrounded by groups of girls who “are just wondering now that he’s single whether he wanted another girlfriend?”
“I don’t know.” He looks up at her floating above him again helplessly. “He didn’t want to talk, he just wanted… that.”
Happily no one else is in the Owlery when he gets there. That horrible Auror who is in charge of his mail is strangely absent for once, and Draco takes full advantage of the fact. Maybe he can get to the letter first and avoid an extra person needlessly knowing his personal business.
Whatever it is they are doing, he just hopes it doesn’t blow up in their faces. Because Harry had been right, enough was enough. It’s time for them to grow up and Draco is just as tired of the fighting and awkward run ins and worried looks.
He knows what Voldemort thought of the matter. And he’s scared to finally learn whether this is another topic his parents agree with him on.
From there things happen quickly. Charlie comes to the tent not even five minutes later, mentioning that he fixed the sign directing guests that the wind had blown over. Then Blaise’s mum Lana arrives along with her eighth husband who Draco frankly can’t remember the name of.
It’s indecent that look. Those grey eyes are dark, darker than Harry has ever seen them, and Draco is flushed and glistening from the water. Harry doesn’t need the blonde to have the use of his mouth to know that Draco is
“That was another reason I stayed. Christmas at the Manor this year won’t be the same, and both Mother and I know it. I understand that it’s horrible for me to want, and wrong,” the blonde says, “but I wish Father was home. At least for Christmas. I-” Draco swallows something down. “It won’t be nearly as enjoyable without him.”
“What, really?” Blaise says before looking over at Neville who nods. “Well done mate, I’m honestly shocked.”
The entire year it has felt like they’ve been building towards something- a tipping point or some kind of crossroads- and Harry hasn’t realized until right before they make it that a choice is coming.
Eventually Draco speaks, trying to bring Harry out of his thoughts. “’The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’” he reads off the marker. “What does that mean?”
Just as Harry is wracking his brains and opening his mouth to say something, anything, to break the heavy silence, Narcissa does it for him.
It turns out Draco is wrong and Harry does catch the Snitch the next two games, but by the end of the third nobody is really keeping track of the score anymore. It has devolved more into the younger kids stealing the ball from one another and doing fancy maneuvers in the sky while Draco and Harry have their own miniature Seeker competitions, much like they would have done if they were alone.
They share a look and then Harry looks out of the open doors, eyes taking in the part of Hogwarts grounds he can see. Draco just watches him, waiting for whatever he’ll say next.
“You want nothing to do with him.” She repeats now flatly. “Yet you’re yelling at each other outside of Blaise and Ginny’s reception, Theo said you couldn’t keep your eyes off of him the entire stag night, and don’t think I didn’t see you watching him all day yesterday either. Both of you, I swear to Circe, you’re as bad as each other. You’re obviously desperate to see one another and
Draco had said he would finally tell his parents the truth and he would suffer the consequences but, Harry realized now feeling stupid, he hadn’t told him what had happened. Maybe he hadn’t said anything to them yet? Maybe this is a test from Narcissa, trying to figure out what Harry and Draco are to one another now?
“Yes?” Draco tries weakly and Harry elbows him. Blaise’s eyes fall back to land on him before they widen.
And with that Blaise slams the door behind him and Draco finally lets his head hang, holding it in his hands.
“Not that much.” Ron shakes his head. “I know his mum saved you in that forest- after letting you die first, by the way- but it doesn’t mean you owe him anything, Harry. It doesn’t mean they’re suddenly good people. You testified at his trial, he’s here, he’s free, I don’t know why-”
That makes the other boy straighten and look at Draco intensely. Draco stares back, almost in challenge, and it reminds him of many other confrontations he’s had with Harry in the past.
Harry had expected the idea to feel weird to him over the past couple of days. Draco had obviously been waiting for more of a reaction than Harry’s surprised “huh” before Harry had then began riling him up.
It’s different and it’s not. Draco knows the shape and movements of Harry’s lips easily by now, will probably know it inherently for the rest of his life. Sometimes they’re chapped and weather-bitten, other days they’re the softest things Draco’s ever had pressed against is skin. More than that they’re comfortable, they’re searching, and they send sparks through Draco’s veins.
“Finally, students, I just wish to say this. I want each of you to remember how you feel here today and the warmth that is in this room.” The Headmistress surveys them all over her spectacles with that special piercing gaze she gives. “There is a school unity that I never thought possible back in my day and it is one I am proud to be a part of. I hope that you all feel the same and realize just how important what you are all doing here is. We have always said that at Hogwarts we are privileged to help shape the young witches and wizards who will shape the future of the Wizarding World, and I would just like to tell you all that I have never been prouder than I am looking at you all today.”
Harry glares at him, even though his reasons for sitting with Malfoy in Potions had been exactly the same. "Don't think you'll just be copying my work, Malfoy."
(And maybe, for a second, he wants to get away from everybody else too. To not have to sit with Neville and remember their friends who died in these very hallways, these rooms. He wants to get away from poisonous looks from the Slytherins, and as far away from Slughorn’s view as possible because he doesn’t feel like the star pupil. Not this year. And Malfoy, for all his faults, for all of their history, has never treated Harry like a star.)
“Stop.” Draco grumbles, squeezing his eyes closed and then groaning in pain because even that makes his head pound. “Hangover potion?”
Draco remembers hearing Harry say things like this when he had fought Voldemort the final time. Draco’s parents had taken him from the castle as soon as the shock of Voldemort’s death had worn off but he remembers standing in the Great Hall of Hogwarts before they’d left, surrounded by dead bodies and grief-stricken students, and parents and Aurors while they huddled there to the side and took in just what their actions had caused.
Draco pauses from where he'd been setting out robes to dress in. "He told me I'm ready to become a Master."
Draco’s proud expression is gone in a second, replaced with a glare. “In your dreams. I have not been staring after you all this time.”
He laughs bitterly and Harry can't speak past the surprise in his throat, only able to listen as Draco goes on.
“Because Kazi’s friends with Ginny and Luna and I speak to her sometimes. It’s obvious she’s had a crush on Roger since what? Their Third Year?”
Sure the two of them are committed now, but what happens in a week? A month? Once they’ve graduated?
"You didn't want breakfast?" Harry asks, and Draco cringes at the concern that's evident in his tone.
“Oh,” Harry slumps in his chair and tries to regain his forced casual demeanor even though he’s now wondering whether Draco really went home with that random guy. Surely not if he’d brought the others home, right? “No, nothing happened. Jut wasn’t tired when I got back.”
They share a smile. And though things still aren’t perfect, Draco feels like they’re back on track. At least for now.
“Well!” Pansy claps her hands together. “I know it’s a Sunday but this calls for a celebration. Drinks?”
Harry grins and shakes his head at the two of them. “You can’t leave me here alone. It’s barely…” He looks up at the giant clock on one of the walls and frowns. “Okay, I suppose it’s half past eleven, but that’s nothing. I remember in Eighth Year we used to stay out until at least one, and that was with a curfew…”
“If you stop,” Harry cards a hand through Draco’s hair, mussing it up and noting his breathing grow more labored. “I’ll just finish myself.”
liked his gift and Draco is proud. He is also happy that the secret is now out. Organizing the entire thing behind Harry’s back had been a nightmare, and finding the time to put the album together when nobody was around had been difficult, despite the Saturday the others had been away in Hogsmeade.
Draco being able to work from home has been a blessing, especially after Lily came along, and Harry knows they have it easier than most. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t miss his family being together like crazy.
“Exactly what I thought. Who cares about defeating Voldemort or freeing magical creatures like House-Elves when I’m out here fighting the good fight. And you,” he looks at Draco and frowns. “Well I suppose bridging the gap between Slytherins and other Houses is pretty decent of you but that’s all nothing, nothing I tell you, compared to the joy and peace I bring to the kitchens of our great country’s homes. So you can all just sit there and shut it, understood?”
“I bet,” Blaise says, and the tone of voice and starry look in his eyes makes Draco clear his throat.
The following silence is heavy with tension and Harry is pinned by Draco’s desperate gaze. Maybe that’s what makes him crack. “Okay. But before you say what you need to, I need to speak first. There’s some things I have to say.”
Harry hesitates. “If it was you, and all you had left of the woman you loved was her kid with another man, would you protect him?”
Pansy glances at Harry quickly before looking back to Draco, her voice low. “I know we were all just joking around this morning, but I mean it Draco. You’ll be alone together. Properly alone. Don’t let yourself do anything you’ll regret.”
There’s music playing but from no obvious source that Harry can spot. Harry blinks again and cocks his head, hearing the faint strains of a Celestina Warbeck Christmas hit slowly fade to be replaced by a rendition of Paul McCartney’s “Wonderful Christmastime”.
“Can I?” Draco whispers, looking back down to Harry. Their eyes meet with a grounding intensity that Harry hasn’t ever felt before. “Will it hurt if I touch it?”
Harry’s eyes drift behind his glasses to resettle on the picture of Cedric. “She’d been crying beforehand.”
Draco shows up to the pub far too early and only debates turning on his heel to leave for a second when he sees that Potter is the only other one there.
One hides away, becoming a Potions Master, breaking records and throwing himself into his work. The other does the opposite and takes pains to splash across the front page of every wizard newspaper as often as possible. When he’s not solving a deadly case, he’s seen going home with somebody after a night out.
“I couldn’t be with him anyway,” Draco’s voice had barely been a whisper and he had still been staring into the flames. He watched as sparks popped from the logs to fly through the air only to wink out against the fire grate.
But they are dancing along the top of the dam now with them both holding the controls of the floodgates, and it is the knowledge that soon they will open them and be overtaken that makes this kiss so different.
And he’s been enjoying the last few days of peace he’s gotten. There hadn’t been a curse aimed at him in a while now.
“Well I’m always second aren’t I? Hermione’s best in all our classes in our year, I’m second best. You’re the best Quidditch player in our year and Slytherin is always runner up. Ron’s your best mate, Ginny was your girlfriend, you’re the most famous in the class… no matter what I tried to do someone always got there first. Annoying you… well. That was one area I excelled.”
He leaves before lunch and his mother welcomes him gladly with open arms and a proud smile at his N.E.W.T.S. results.
“You can bring them here.” Ron’s shifting from foot to foot and glancing at the hourglass clock on the wall anxiously. His scarlet Auror robes are skimming the ground with each move and it’s making Draco nervous. “There’s free rein with this one, whatever you want or need you have authorization to get it.”
“Oh man, he could do impressions or something.” The man hesitates. “He said your name was Draco? Like Draco Malfoy?”
"Hello Draco, lovely to see you again, how's classes going for you so far and why in Circe’s name are you sitting with Potter in Potions?"
Draco grins, picturing Arthur and Molly Weasley with Blaise on their couch asking for Ginny's hand. "Oh, I can picture it."
Harry blinks and Draco begins to protest, but soon they’re sitting on the sofa with the others and anything they could have said is drowned out by the debate already happening. Pansy and Ernie are staring one another down.
He’d fallen asleep with a smile on his face and woken up early enough to go down to breakfast, sit with Ginny and be reminded of the stupid party happening tomorrow night.
“Suck it up, Harry,” Parvati and Hannah are cuddling on the loveseat together. Hannah’s grin is wide and Harry feels the betrayal keenly. “That’s the rules.”
He’s told Hermione and Ron about it and invited them both to join him, but he’s not surprised that they don’t hesitate before saying no.
“They won’t.” Harry replies confidently, starting to walk. “But if they do then we’ll say they were lying. Why would you go there? Doesn’t make any sense. Besides if you take my cloak you’ll be able to get down to the dungeons no problem. If you don’t take it you have eight floors to go down without being caught.”
Holy Helena, he had been jealous at that. Furiously jealous, and still barely able to admit it. He’d taken Pansy and had barely said two words to her that whole night. Instead he’d been watching as Potter had sat with Parvati, Ron and Padma. Even though the lot of them had looked as miserable as Draco had felt he’d been viciously angry about the entire situation.
“Yeah, you were.” Harry hesitates. “You’re the reason Voldemort lost, you know. He never even considered you might have overpowered Dumbledore.”
“I love you too.” He says, because it’s the truth and Draco should know it. “Always have, since Hogwarts.”
It had shocked him on his first few visits here because of who Andromeda’s sisters were but Harry feels similarly here as he does at the Burrow. There is something about Andromeda that reminds him strongly of Molly, and though the two witches have only gotten together a couple of times in the past few years, whenever they are together the comparison is even more striking.
“Everybody back up right now!” One of the Aurors- Daniels, maybe, Draco forgot their names almost as soon as they said them- steps up with his wand raised to make some room. Draco’s chest feels tight. “Levi, get that camera and get these people out of here. Mr. Malfoy, come along.”
“I would watch your tone, Narcissa.” McGonagall says distractedly but she looks unhappy as well after a few seconds of silent pondering. “There were a few
Either way. Nothing had ever come of it and now Goyle is gone too. His letters are rare and only to Draco. They might have come more often if Draco didn’t remind him of everything too much. And it hurts but he can understand at least. It isn’t Draco, really, that keeps Goyle away. Just the memories.
Draco rolls his eyes, starting to walk again and pushing down the mix of emotion inside of him. He can sort it all out later. “And the reason I didn’t invite you to the party,” he says, not looking Potter’s way. “It’s not because I don’t consider you… that. It’s because I already knew you were going.”
“How connected all of us have been, how similar we all are without having noticed before. Like our entire lives have been parallel to one another. I’m distantly related to Draco and was locked in his dungeon but we grew up entirely separate, never saying a word to each other. Now here we are.” She shoots him a smile and Harry sees Draco stare blankly back at her. “And you and Draco, Harry, you’re so alike. Or Ron and Ginny being Purebloods but never going to Slytherin. It’s just strange, to think that if one thing had been different here or there, everything else would be different now too.”
But there’s still a week until then, and one more Friday night before leaving next Saturday. Harry doesn’t have to worry about it quite yet and as they all start speaking in groups of twos or threes he lets himself be drawn into conversation as well.
Aunt Bella had been throwing spells around to damage the castle, even setting fire to Hagrid’s hut, and still Harry had come running after them all to confront them; to fight.
“He’s my friend.” Harry repeats, resolve settling in him as a weight lifts from his shoulders at the words. “I’m not saying he’s not done stupid things, ‘cause he has. I know that.”
It’s a nice feeling and it makes fondness fill him. Harry is oblivious and probably really does think everyone fancies Draco just because he does.
Harry looks down, toe scuffing the ground as he shifts. He sees Draco’s fingers twitch in annoyance and smiles a bit. It’s funny, how concerned Draco is with posture and appearances. Part of his Pureblood upbringing, Harry supposes.
It doesn’t take long for the angle to become uncomfortable and with a quick gathering of his courage Harry moves forward to place one of his legs on either side of Draco’s waist and straddle his lap. They both falter at the new sensations of that angle and then Harry is attacking Draco’s lips with more force than before and Draco is wrapping his arms around Harry to haul him closer, as close as they could possibly get with all of their clothes still on. Draco ends up lying down with Harry straddling him and they spend minutes snogging each other senseless.
They’re adults for Circe’s sake. The two of them can be professional. Impartial even. Casual acquaintances. Maybe the next wedding they both get invited to won’t leave Draco drinking as soon as he gets home to block out the memories.
"Come on, Ron, you can sit with me. I grew up with Muggles too and I’ve already taken it back in Third Year. You'll pass the course easy as breathing."
“You’re both nutters.” Harry decides and snatches another drink from a passing waiter. “Jesus, what kind of people do I surround myself with?”
She gets up too. “No need. If you insist on being the biggest idiot I’ve ever seen then I see no reason for me to stay.” Seven strides take her to the door before she turns around. “I’m worried about you. We all are. Whatever happened with you and Potter, both of you aren’t over it. That’s why we keep asking, you absolute arsehole. Both of you are hurting, Draco, and nobody knows why. And we’re worried. You can’t go on like this.”
Harry actually smiles a bit before nodding in agreement. “You’re right, must have lost it for a bit there. I don’t think there’s a force on Earth that could get you to leave me alone.”
After the quickest glance around the room known to man where he saw nothing was damaged in the violent entrance of his friend, Draco's eyes had fallen to the paper.
And Draco had been expecting annoyance or real anger from Harry at that but all Harry does is look at him so fondly that it makes Draco ache all over.
"I- sorry." He speaks to the stranger, ignoring Draco now. Looking at him has proven to be dangerous. "I'm just passing by and-"
“Oh don’t look like that, I’m not about to hex you both.” McGonagall still sounds amused but also slightly exasperated as she turns. “Come, let’s talk in my office.”
Know what seeing Draco after all this time will be like. Know what it will do to him. Know how to act around him.
Harry nods, ignoring Ron’s ashamed look. “Wasn’t one of our better days either. We were attacked by Nagini and my wand was broken. Wouldn’t recommend it.”
“Yeah but I never actually read anything except the Quidditch bit.” Which is always reliably short and uninformative, more likely to talk about the players’ personal lives than the games. Once there wasn’t a sports section at all and Harry had tried flipping through it but as soon he’d seen the article title of “Thestrals and How They Know Divination” he’d given up.
"Oh, because you've made him so happy since then?" He looks up at Ginny's sharp words. "Don't give me that look, Malfoy, you have no idea what it's been like watching him since Hogwarts. You locked yourself away so you didn't have to see. Nobody had any idea what was going on when he was suddenly volunteering for dangerous missions, ignoring training, doing anything he could to save everybody but himself in the field. And at nights anybody who wanted him he'd take home, do you know that?"
Draco swallowed, feeling the weight of that old secret return as she watched him. “What happened?” He had asked softly.
Harry glances over briefly and grips his hand tightly back. Draco flexes his fingers a bit- Harry’s grip is strong, even through the mittens both of them wear.
"I'm in love with him," Draco says, squeezing his eyes shut to stop the insistent tears, but that only makes the memory of Harry's stricken face clearer, making him gasp. "I'm still in love with him Blaise, and we've- the two of us- he asked me to tell him the truth and I lied, I told him I didn't love him anymore but I do, and I can't stop, and it
“You were the face of the resistance,” Draco says quietly. “If they weren’t following your example then whose?”
He hasn’t told Harry about the offer yet. They’d both been focused on exams and their futures, and Harry has been growing particularly despondent about having to leave Hogwarts. Plus Draco had wanted to deal with his parents first. Draco’s been too scared to tell Harry about France because he knows it might be the final straw. If he and Harry had broken up over it then all of Draco’s bravery and motivation for telling his parents about himself would have vanished.
Draco had hurried to the table, sure she knew exactly what they’d been doing, but Harry hadn’t been worried. He’s sure Madame Pince has seen worse than the two of them snogging, and besides, she isn’t likely to tell anybody was she?
“If it helps,” Draco breaks in hesitantly, resting his hands on his robe covered legs. “Everyone I’ve spoken to is saying the same thing.”
A man steps up beside Draco, the man he’d been dancing with, and when he glances over his stomach sinks because he’s cute. Really attractive with dark curly hair, brown skin and brown eyes. Good build and he’s rocking a red t-shirt and jeans that Draco wouldn’t usually find appealing.
More than half of the remaining group groan again. Harry spots Ernie McMillan, who is dressed as a leprechaun, whisper to Hannah Abbot, who appears to be a Beauxbatons girl, and both of them grimace.
“Hermione picked the damn thing.” He mutters and she just grins in response. When Harry turns to inspect her costume he only laughs harder.
“Oh, you didn’t tell her first, Ginny.” George says while unwrapping a chocolate frog. He offers one to Harry who grins and accepts. “That were me.”
Then another. And another. In all Draco counts 10 Howlers fall, along with plenty of regular letters, all littering the Gryffindor table.
He’s the Auror department’s poster boy. He doesn’t like it but that doesn’t stop it from being true.
“And what about me?” He asks quietly. “Do you think my parents would enjoy hearing about our relationship from a news rag instead of from me directly?”
“Ah.” Draco shifts, though Harry sees him fall a little more at ease at the words. Obviously this is more familiar territory for him. “Thank you.”
Blaise nods, face set. “I know what you’re saying. And you’re right. The last thing I want is a repeat of Fifth. But Draco,” Blaise shakes his head with a helpless smile. “I’ve been thinking this for so long now and it hasn’t gone away. If anything it’s only gotten worse. I know how I feel. I’m sure.”
“It makes me think I probably should have too. Over the years.” Harry looks unhappy as they pass the younger year students to make their way to Draco’s dorm. “Does she really think we used her for information all this time?”
Draco gets there early because he’s anxious but he’s startled to find Harry waiting already. He must have come right away.
Harry opens his mouth but nothing seems to be able to leave it, so he snaps his jaw shut and nods shakily, taking a hesitant step backwards.
“No, be careful!” Draco says but it’s too late, Teddy’s already picking the items up to inspect them closer while the rest of them lean in to get a better look.
He reaches out to slip one finger under the elastic, making Harry shiver as it traces down one hipbone to the crease where his leg meets his pelvis.
"Yes, but the thing is Draco, Theo actually wrote to us this summer?” Pansy says impatiently. “So we know how he's doing. Unlike you, who, as I assume, just ignored all of our letters."
So why does he look so… tense? Even Harry was more relaxed than him. To begin with at least. It’s Draco and his nerves that are putting Harry on edge.
She gives him a slightly shaky smile before excusing herself to go upstairs, leaving Harry and Draco alone to walk out.
“Pansy!” Theo turns from his conversation with Harry immediately to shuffle around the table to her. “Come on, let’s go home.”
Because he knows exactly what she meant. Things with Ginny are good, but they’re just that. They aren't great. He isn't constantly touching her or even really worrying about their relationship at all, because it’s easy. Effortless.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” He sees Ginny move to go rejoin the rest of the family. “How are you, Mrs. Weasley?”
He flips Draco two fingers but steps out from the bench anyway. “Won’t be a mo’.” He tells the others and then he and Draco are making their way back up to the Gryffindor Common Room.
“Of course I do.” He murmurs, eyes looking deeply into Draco’s. “Draco. I’ve never- I…” He trails off before shaking his head and forcing back a smile. “Aren’t there better things we could be doing than talking?”
“They’re okay.” He replies quietly. “Mum misses Dad. I haven’t seen him since he was sentenced to Azkaban, but apparently they’re able to send letters for Christmas. As a reward for good behaviour.”
“Ah, but that’s what wars do, ain’t it? Horrible things, I know, but they do have a way o’ bringin’ people together after. But you’ll both know better than I do at this rate. Oh,” he stands back up, “That’s the tea done, just a mo’.”
Potter stops, staring up at him. Finally he answers. “I just thought we were friends.” He says slowly. “Despite everything; all the crap you pulled, everything we did to each other, all the stupid stuff I said before this year… I thought we were friends now.”
Then Harry looks away and Draco realizes that while Draco has been taking in the town Harry has been staring into the plot of land beside them. A small gate shuts it off from the rest of the street and behind that gate is a ruined house.
“Hey there big man,” Harry says and can’t help the flare of warmth that goes through him when Teddy’s pink-haired head shoots up and he immediately starts babbling in excitement.
“Apparently Ron keeps trying to talk about future plans.” Ginny rolls her eyes. “Hermione’s freaking out a bit.”
Minutes go by before either of them opens their eyes. Draco barely manages to lift his head from Harry’s shoulder and meet his gaze.
“Harry, please.” Draco begs him, not bothering to feel embarrassed. “Let’s just keep it between us, at least for now. We can bring it up again later. But right now… I can’t think about that. I’m sorry.”
They don't look like they believe him, but Harry doesn't care. They stop pestering him and he goes back to his steak pie and Potions book, trying, for the fourth time, to read a paragraph about asphodel root and how it affects potion consistency.
“Dragon.” Draco replies, sounding as if he is ready to be teased further. “That’s what the constellation is supposed to be too, although it’s always looked more like a snake to me.”
“They grew out of it, I think.” Harry frowns. “Maybe not Sirius. But Mum didn’t like it and Dad liked her so… he stopped.”
It might not have been a breakthrough on the case but Harry still considers it a breakthrough nonetheless.
which also has his face on the cover, three other letters, one from Slughorn, the other from Andromeda, and finally he looks at the letter on the bottom.
Draco looks up at her from his Transfiguration book slowly. "Oh, are we speaking again? Decided being associated with me won't damage your reputation too much?"
“Have you been hit in the head with a bludger in the five minutes I was talking to her? I’m with you, you prat, of course I’m not just going to-”
“That you won’t tell anybody outside this room unless we say you can.” Harry is pinned by Draco’s sudden attention. “Harry, you officiate it.”
Harry’s lips thin and go white as he presses them together before answering. “Because I’m a Halfblood. Like he was.”
Harry doesn’t rise to the teasing. Their attitudes have switched just like that and now he’s incredibly serious.
“I don’t- let me get this straight.” Draco advances quickly, catching up to Potter and catching his arm to spin him around so they face each other. “You don’t want me to come anymore?”
But there’s a difference between knowing that and taking the steps to make it happen. A difference between knowing Harry makes him happy and being willing to possibly lose his family to keep being with the other wizard.
“Lately he’s been carrying you when you’re drunk and giving you lovesick stares.” Draco said, perhaps a bit nastily. “We’ve all noticed.”
Ron studies him for a couple seconds more but then his eyes drift over Harry’s shoulder to meet someone else’s and he waves with a big grin. Harry doesn’t turn around.
some of the sexiest things I’ve ever seen.” Pansy is talking animatedly with expressive hand gestures.
There’s a few cries, a few more yells of people trying to ask Draco questions about Harry, but he ducks his head and moves along. There’s a buzzing in his ears and Daniels’ hand is tight on his upper arm until they make it through the small crowd and get some space again.
Draco glances at Potter for confirmation but there’s no need to wait for an answer. The way Potter looks away and his lips press tightly closed is all the answer Draco needs.
. And though Harry knows Draco lashes out when he feels cornered that knowledge isn’t enough to dull his own response to Draco’s words.
Though then again, he supposes she’s made it clear she doesn’t care what anyone in the wizarding world thinks of her.
“Well?” The blonde looks down, fiddling with the sleeves that reach the bottom of his hands. Perfect fit really. “Your verdict?”
Draco’s eyes shine. “McGonagall Owled me this morning, said that Donnagan has had enough and she would be grateful if I could accept the position. Said it would make her final year a bit smoother.” He waits but Harry doesn’t say anything, can’t say anything. His mind is going too fast, trains of thought shooting off in every direction and getting derailed as he remembers not to hope for too much. “She’d like to hear by the end of the weekend.”
“Yeah,” Potter says after a few seconds, leaning back and Draco does the same, not realizing they’ve been bending towards each other. Potter laughs uneasily, looking away. “Exactly. It’s magical.”
Harry processes that before nodding. “The thing is for me, us being together hasn’t been an option for so long. And now you come here and say all of these things, everything I’ve been dying for you to say since Eighth Year, making all that I’ve wanted possible again. But you’ve been sending mixed messages for just as long. Can you- do you see why that might be hard for me?”
Besides. It’s nice to not have to see his friends moping or crying over each other anymore. Whenever the two of them fight these days it’s easy enough for him to bluntly remind them that they love each other and will make up eventually, so they should stop wasting time and just talk it out.
“No more horrible than anyone else in that matter.” Harry says. “Luna told me people hid her stuff before the last day of school one year. Took her forever to find it all again.”
“Which means it’s either Luna or a Slytherin.” Draco deduces. “Come on Harry, we’re supposed to be keeping these a secret.”
She gives him a wave and then wanders off towards the stairs. Harry shakes his head, unable to stop a grin from forming as she leaves.
“Potter.” The headmistress greets as he stumbles a couple of steps before straightening. She seems to be holding back a smile, what with the way her lips are twitching, and Harry sees amusement dancing in her eyes. “And the rest of you.”
A quick glimpse of his Dark Mark is revealed before he hurriedly shakes down his sleeve to hide it. With a final nod at Kingsley, Draco is led away to a back room.
Draco doesn't make any outward sign of hearing the words apart from a tightening of his fingers on the crystal glass he's holding. With his back turned to Blaise it means the other wizard doesn’t notice. "How unfortunate for us both. I suppose you have a magical solution?"
Draco swallows nervously. He feels horrible saying this. First it was him who demanded they stay private and now he’s going to change the status quo and ask Harry to reveal that the two of them are together and-
“Harry.” Draco repeats, voice heavy with want and a bit of fear and Harry’s eyes fly open as he makes his decision.
Harry rubs the back of his neck, cursing himself. Why couldn't he control his mouth? He hadn't liked hearing Draco sounding like that- so wistful and full of regret. He'd wanted to get that look off his face.
He swallows. “We were children, letting the adults around us persuade us one way or another, or even decide things for us. But this past year made everyone grow up. Draco’s actions and decisions now are his own. Nobody else’s. And I think they speak for themselves.”
“I’m glad things have changed.” Lynne says, mostly to Draco but still looking around at all of them. “I’m glad my parents don’t say or think that stuff anymore.”
“Well I was just thinking.” Ron leans forward. “It took Charlie a long time to tell us all even though most witches and wizards are fine with it. And I remembered something Hermione said a while back about how acceptance was still a big issue with a lot of Muggles.”
He hums, finally, turning back to his notes. "Makes a change for you, does it?" He asks, but he's quieter now, and the bite is gone.
Draco stares at him mutely, partly from shock, partly from mortification and partly from the dread of having his fears confirmed.
Harry cringes, expecting them to round on him once more at the mention of Malfoy. Last night each of them had tried to talk to him. Hermione had done so gently. Ron had been far less considerate.
Draco’s eyes take in every part of Harry’s face. He can feel them trailing over him and he smiles a bit nervously; he’s only reassured when the other boy grins softly again and looks down at the steps in front of them.
Sure Harry has been a part of what Muggles call ‘locker room talk’,  but based on snippets of conversation he’s overheard between Luna and Ginny or Hermione, Millie and Pansy, it is a vastly different talk than whatever women had.
But he is already getting up and moving forward to meet Draco in the middle of the circle, forgetting that so far it was only the spinner who had moved to get to their target. He isn’t worried about seeming eager or- or whatever it might look like he is. He walks to the middle of the circle, dropping to kneel in front of Draco who is staring at him with wide eyes.
“And if you don’t want me back anymore… I understand. And I’ll stay away. But this time I’m being honest and telling you that I will always want to be with you.
“I’m sure you will.” She says, not sounding the least bit concerned as she turns away to talk to Millie.
“Yes.” He bolts up and accepts the offer gratefully, hurriedly putting down his half-full teacup on the coffee table. “That would be… good.”
Then he moves forward, and this time there’s nobody there to make them self-conscious so he smiles when Harry falls into the kiss. He cups Draco’s face, feeling the smooth expanse of shaved cheeks, running his hand up through the short blonde strands, giving a small tug to angle his head a certain way and making Draco let out a gasp.
Well, that’s not strictly true he supposes. It is impossible not to notice how empty the castle is now. And the meals are markedly different with barely anybody there.
With careful searching his hand eventually grasps them and he puts them back on. For a few moments he just takes in Draco, breathing softly, chest rising gently, and an overwhelming surge of fondness fills him.
The paintings of Draco’s ancestors are quiet as he walks, for which he is thankful. Most of them give him appraising looks, many of them knowing, and Harry wonders which picture from the entrance had visited them all to gossip of today’s recent developments.
The blonde’s expression breaks out into a smile. “But yes. I was hoping we were done with coordinating our schedules as well.”
“And here I thought Gryffindors were prudes,” Theodore Nott says, making Millicent Bulstrode nod beside him.
“I am trying to change. Draco has already done so in ways only Lucius and I can truly see as his parents. And for our actions, and those of my late sister, against you and your friends and family, I am sorry. Truly.”
But if anyone can give him the stability he so obviously wants then Draco supposes it could be Ginny. She’s had a good example in her own parents after all.
He and Harry stare at each other in stunned silence for a moment, hurt coursing through Harry fiercely, a hurt he knows Draco sees because Harry notes the moment it registers on Draco’s angry and betrayed face before the blonde whirls around and begins to stride away.
Harry even let himself join the dancing; and what’s more surprising is that he enjoyed it. It wasn’t like the Yule Ball, where there was pressure to find one person and dance with them all night with everyone staring at him. In the Room with everyone else he went from person to person, shouting in their ears to talk and dancing a bit before being swept away to find someone else.
“I went to the loo,” Harry says carefully. The interest on the other man’s face fades and Draco huffs, lying back down before Harry says, “and then I had a bit of a chat with your mum.”
Lydia and the other First Year, Nadia, from Hufflepuff are the youngest of the lot. Harry immediately picks Lydia, making Draco shoot him a swift glare. This quickly turns into a smile as Nadia swings confidently onto her broom and hovers in the air beside the blonde when Draco picks her next. Harry takes in the remaining students before deciding to just pick at random. This isn’t for House Points or anything serious, just fun, and he knows what it’s like to be the last person picked for things.
“I owe most of my success to the late Professor Severus Snape, to Professor Slughorn and Thelonius Karlton. These three men taught me almost everything I know about potion making and never failed to encourage me and my enthusiasm for the subject. I have to thank my friends, who often put up with long-lasting rants on ingredients and properties they’d never heard of and had no interest in. Believe me, I know how tiring it could be and I’m grateful. Especially Pansy and Blaise who suffered more of these than most.” A few chuckles sound throughout the room. “And last but not least I have to thank my mother and father. Despite their own life choices, they never hesitated to encourage mine and never once doubted I would make the right ones myself and end up here today. That kind of support doesn’t have a price but I will be eternally grateful for it.” He swallows, throat suddenly thick, and smiles, holding the award up for everyone to see. “So thank you all and I promise this is not the last you will hear from me. More progress in this area is right at our fingertips and I for one am excited to meet it. Thank you.”
“This morning when you were coming to see me I could have still been sleeping.” Harry teases Draco quietly as the Fat Lady opens. “Could have been starkers and everything.”
Before his voice fades away people are on their feet clapping. His friends are screaming the place down and his mum is crying while Pansy hugs her.
Their little group head back in and as Draco is drawn into conversation with all of them he realizes exactly what’s happening. It’s no longer just him and Harry who are friends, but each of them are slowly becoming comfortable with each other. Already he looks around and sees Pansy in discussion with Hermione and Ron, and Blaise and Ginny are half glaring at one another as they debate some matter or other.
“I think about you,” Harry’s head falls back to the wall behind him, thoughts almost incoherent. “Your hand and- God, your mouth. Hot and wet, around me and sucking like you’d rather be doing that than anything else-”
Draco looks over when he feels someone fall into place beside him and then doesn’t know why he bothered. Of course it’s Harry, and when Harry looks back at him Draco knows he understands.
Harry presses his lips together firmly and nods, trying to stop the fresh wave of laughter while Draco goes extremely serious and agrees, saluting Ron from across the table. “Yes, Mr. Weasely, sir.”
“Friends invite friends to parties they go to.” Potter says. “I invited you. You- if you knew about it you obviously didn’t want to invite me.”
Harry almost regrets asking Draco to join the case because it is proving to be very hard for him to think of anything else.
"Talking about me behind my back now?" Draco says conversationally and moves to go back to his desk, pulling forward a piece of parchment with his most recent potion's adjustments written on it. "Not very good friends, are you?"
For a moment Snape’s expression seems to waver, softness and something like apology in his eyes. “I did what I had to, Draco. You understand that, don’t you?”
Harry considers his options. He could summon a House Elf, but that would undoubtedly wake up Draco. Or he can wait until the other wizard wakes up.
Draco nods, looking down. He’s blinking quickly and Harry’s heart wrenches itself against his rib cage but he looks away too and doesn’t say anything. “I understand. That’s- that’s smart. I didn’t expect anything, not after all this time, I just… wanted you to know. Everything.”
He catches sight of Myrtle in the corner of the roof, sitting up on a beam and crying. It’s a favourite spot of hers, he knows.
Then there are Blaise and Millie. Even Theo, who seems to be the definition of the strong-but-silent type, has made it clear to Harry that they are friends now. It might be a friendship of silence broken by the occasional teasing and Quidditch talk, but Harry was perfectly happy with that.
He does not look at Potter and Ginevra talking. He doesn’t watch as they laugh, the red head leaning against Potter’s side, their arms brushing against each other.
Hermione and Ron are off on a date on the castle grounds. Or something like that. Harry’s sure he’ll get the rest of the details later, but truthfully, he’s fine with the limited knowledge he has.
“But… the letters.” He replies dumbly. “From Eighth Year, when I wrote you both each of you replied and said I would be thrown out if Harry and I were together.”
“No, I’m glad you did.” A look crosses Harry’s face, making him seem somewhere between constipated and embarrassed.
“Stupid? You act like I wasn’t just down there with you to watch as you encouraged Blaise on in this ridiculous idea.”
The water plasters his hair to his head and pours down the back of his neck in thin streams as he heads to the nearest Ministry approved
She watches him a bit longer before smiling. “Well maybe I’ll get the others after breakfast and we can come out and join you. Would that be alright?”
But none had come. It seems that Harry and Ginny had been right when they’d broken up- the feelings they had for each other have faded back into familial territory rather than romantic. The monster of jealousy Harry had used to have is long gone.
Then at Easter Harry had shown up. Draco had been closer than ever to just wanting it all to stop, and then there Harry had been. Potter had come and disrupted the everything. Seeing him there, in the Manor, bruised, face swollen, bound but with eyes glittering, Draco had also found a bit of hope too.
They obviously hadn’t been as good at keeping their relationship a secret back in school as they’d thought. And their friends might not have known exactly when they’d gotten together but they obviously knew that Draco and Harry would be back together before either of them had realized it themselves.
He remembers Zabini being the one to finally convince him that everything was over. That Draco hadn't- that Harry had been made a fool of.
Draco’s stomach clenches slightly but he nods anyway and follows Harry through. He can’t help but remember his offer from this morning in the shower.
Harry feels a bit like he’s been punched, the words surprise him so painfully. “Right. Yeah, ‘course not.”
He feels Harry’s breath against his neck. It’s so close that the warmth is slightly damp and Draco uses all of his strength to hold back a shudder.
It takes a little bit, and it’s more awkward than Draco would like, but soon Harry stops pushing in and Draco feels full, so full he’s amazed he can even hold all of it. Once the shock wears off though there’s something else, a pleasant ache.
“Because I’m tired.” He answers finally and Draco blinks at the honesty in his voice. Harry looks up and pins Draco with his gaze. “I don’t want to be angry at you anymore and I don’t want the others to always be worried about saying your name around me. I thought maybe having you on the case, working together a bit… maybe it would help. A professional setting will force us to keep things civil, maybe eventually we’ll just… fall back into it. Things might settle back into how they used to be when we were friends.”
Draco pushes away the thought that his face is meant to go on that pillow, thank you very much, but now it’s trapping his cock against his stomach and likely being smeared with precome. “You sound much too satisfied with yourself.”
But right now it’s Blaise who needs his support, not Pansy. And as much as Draco loves her, she has nobody to blame but herself. Which she already realizes.
She cocks her head to look up at him questioningly, arms crossed over her red lace dress. “What are you talking about?”
Where the Slytherin had always liked quick, Harry has always loved slow. He loves the foreplay and the build up, the tension that rises inside of him, climbing higher and higher until the slightest touch can send him over the edge to his orgasm with Harry helpless to resist.
He, like Ron, has completely missed the boat with planning his Christmas shopping, but to be honest he isn’t surprised. Harry knows he’s never the most organized and this is his typical holiday routine.
“Then tell them!” Harry yells. “For God’s sake Draco, I can’t keep having this same conversation.” His chest is heaving and Draco flinches at the volume of his voice. “You keep talking in circles. Deciding one thing and then backtracking. If you want to tell your parents then bloody well do it! And I know you do, I know that’s the big issue here, that it always has been. If the thought of what your parents might say wasn’t enough to stop you from entering into this- this whatever it is with me, then obviously you can’t care that much!”
Luckily it’s quick. Draco turns in his seat to meet Blaise who is sitting beside him and the two barely touch before they are pulling away, Draco rolling his eyes and letting out an unimpressed breath and Blaise leaning back slowly, adjusting his fake glasses that look just like Harry’s.
She groans. “Don’t remind me. But I found a new magical creature rights charity for him to support the other day so I feel like I’ve done something productive this last week. And don’t get me started on his last meeting with the Prime Minister.”
“Oh, brilliant plan, Ronald, let’s just keep our friends a secret, shall we? I’m sure that will make them feel very appreciated.”
Then there had been that one instance when Draco had been handing Harry tea during one of their now shared breaks. Their fingers had more than brushed, they’d practically been holding one another’s hands around the cup. And Draco had been close, so close that their toes had almost touched. The feeling of Draco’s smooth skin had made Harry want to reach out and hold his hand, to grip it tightly and keep it in his grasp for as long as he could.
“But it’s a cycle,” Hermione had explained once to Harry when he’d carefully broached the subject. “Maybe if Slytherin hadn’t been so ostracized in the first place then Voldemort would have made friends in other Houses who could have ended up just as evil and joined his cause. Or changed his ideas. The only reason it always comes down to Slytherins vs. everyone else is because we grow up letting it happen.”
She nods. “And I want the same for you. But it was always going to be weird, wasn’t it? Whichever one of us started seeing someone else first. I didn’t know if it would be you or me, but obviously there’s going to be some strangeness, no matter how okay we are with being apart.”
for this world. For magic or Hogwarts or any of it. This life has been horrible for Potter, of that there’s no doubt, and Draco couldn’t blame him for hating it and everything to do with magic. He’s always assumed Potter had been ripped from his perfect Muggle family with his perfect relatives to battle evil. He’s always wondered whether Potter would have rather stayed a Muggle.
“At least you’re self-aware,” Harry is still smiling and shakes his head. “Merlin, this probably in no way helps but fine. I’m keeping one thing until Christmas Day, but I was thinking of something else. It’s not really a gift or anything like that though.”
It wasn’t a love declaration or anything of the sort, but if Draco had done something similar in Eighth Year… well it was possible they’d still be together now.
Draco looks away, shrugging. “Mother said that it couldn’t be true, that I’d be messing up her future plans and ruining the Malfoy name for good. Father was much more detailed and said I would be kicked out of the will, disinherited, cut off and once you’d grown tired of being with me I’d be left to myself to navigate the wizarding world that hated me and my family. That I would inevitably end up disappointed, heartbroken and alone. So.”
Malfoy is actually funny, once he stops being a prat. And he’s sad, and proud, and irritatingly blonde with sharp cheekbones.
There is a round of agreements and a rush to the table piled with gifts before they all sit down again. This time Harry is between Ginny and Luna and he tries not to be disappointed when Draco finally sits down across from him on one of the chairs.
“How could that possibly help?” Draco says patronizingly. “This is complex magic and I don’t think going back to- to Third Year level potions theory will be of any use.”
It doesn’t seem at all like him, but neither did trying to arrange a date for Harry, and stranger things have happened. Draco is secretly dating Harry Potter after all.
Harry tenses a bit without meaning to. Did it have to be a snake, he asks himself? Harry’s sick of the things. He seems to be permanently linked to them somehow, first with
“Where are you off to? Fancy a game of chess?” Ron asks him, eyeing the books in his arms from his seat in front of the fire in the Gryffindor Common Room.
She releases his hand. “Brilliant, Harry, that’s wonderful. Bring Ron and Hermione. Oh, and Ginny will be there! Ask whoever you want to come.”
“Draco,” Narcissa’s voice is softer than before. Harry is extremely grateful she doesn’t open the door. “Andromeda and Teddy have arrived. I’m having them brought to the living room.”
He hears his name from Thelonius’ lips and the walk up to the stage is shakier than he would have liked but he makes it safely without embarrassing himself.
Keller takes him in with clear loathing in his gaze. “There better not be anything to write a report about in here.” He grins with yellow teeth. “Wouldn’t want you to end up sharing a cell with your dear old dad.”
Later he will blame the smile, but Harry knows himself better than that as he moves to hug Draco tightly, his arms clutching as his back tightly.
“And it doesn’t take as long to work. Pretty much instant.” Pansy grins. “But Harry was telling me you two were just about to go on a walk.”
"- who was I to refuse, really? It did make being nice to you so much easier." Draco's mouth is poison, his tongue is a dagger and each word is drawing blood from both of them. He doesn't know what he's saying, where it's coming from, or how to stop. He should stop, he knows, he's said enough, Harry will walk away from him any second now in disgust.
“So she asked me out, so what?” Harry asks. “The others must have told you I didn’t want to date her in Sixth and I still don’t now. Especially now.”
"In case I don't catch you both before you're off, it was a wonderful wedding," he tells them both seriously. "I'm very happy for you."
“And soon our social circles overlapped. Everywhere I went, there you were. Sometimes it felt like you were doing it on purpose, following me around, never letting me think of anything except you, but in the moments you weren’t there I began to wish you were. We fought, as only we can, but we made up too. You make me feel safe, you make me happy and you make me feel loved; but most of all you understand me in a way nobody else does. I am yours, just like you are mine, and from this day on nothing will ever be able to change that.”
Potter’s face pinches and his voice hardens a bit. “No, Hagrid did that. And don’t call them my Muggles.” His mouth twists. “Please.”
Harry appreciates Ron's concern, he really does, but it's Hermione's eyes he meets. Blinking he realizes his own are full of tears and his throat's closing up, making him feel, awfully, as if he's about to cry.
“Blaise.” His tone is sharp now, all patience lost. He won’t have anyone make a big deal of such a simple thing. Harry’s so drunk there’s no chance of anything happening and Draco isn’t completely sober either. He’s tired and feels wrung out and he’s already wondering just how much of tonight he’s going to regret tomorrow. “Either you want us to get along or you don’t, but it can’t happen if you baby us.”
“Er… well I’ve narrowed down the list of possible ingredient combinations quite a bit. I’m trying to replicate a few and see what the effects are but so far none have seemed to match.”
“My goodness,” Andromeda speaks finally. Harry eyes the Peruvian Vipertooth that is crawling close to his shoes. “I haven’t seen these in an age.”
It makes his gut clench and his pleasure spike dangerously. His breath hitches and his grip tightens and Draco’s eyes are deep and full of satisfaction.
It tastes sweet, like sugar cookies, and the candy feels like it’s made of sugar crystals on Harry’s tongue with the way it dissolved almost instantly. He’s careful to lean away from Draco as he carefully picks the paper out of his mouth to read the name written on it.
“I know what you and the kids have said. And I heard you, dear, I did,” Molly turns the mug in her hands, seeming almost anxious. “And I know what Percy’s said, and remember what Arthur told me, but I would just like to hear it from you, if you don’t mind.” She blows out a breath. “I’m afraid Ginny got mad at me when I spoke with her- though to be fair I wasn’t acting as calmly as I should have, perhaps- and I haven’t had a decent chance to talk with Ron since he’s come back from visiting Hermione’s parents.”
“Passed out in the middle of a hug. Took me ages to get her down onto the bed without waking her up again.”
“I didn’t think you would want me to!” Harry protests immediately, looking at Ginny in a mixture of betrayal and astonishment. “Back when we spoke you still didn’t seem entirely sure-”
"Wha- Malfoy and I aren't passionate about anything together!" Harry exclaims very passionately, looking around for someone else to deny it. "Besides he's a right git. You can't blame me."
His hopes sink further but he forces a smile on his face. Make friends. Right, he thinks bitterly, because your old ones have all deserted you.
“You sound like Dudley,” Harry says but he chuckles and the tone is still fond so Draco doesn’t take offense.
“From Slughorn?” Harry asks in a valiant attempt to change the subject, pointing at a picture of what must undoubtedly have been a Slug Club from years ago. His mother is pictured sitting amongst a group of other pimply faced students with Professor Slughorn standing at the back of them.
The blonde’s mouth had thinned. “One must take certain precautions when they’re an ex-Death-Eater in Hogwarts.”
“Are you wanting anything, mate?” The mohawked bartender smiles at him to gentle her shout over the music.
The cool air is refreshing and does more to wake and sober the three of them up than the water they’d drunk inside. He links arms with both Ron and Neville and
Harry meets his eyes and sees that whatever panic had been there is gone, replaced by a smoldering heat that he really hopes he isn’t imagining.
When he manages to roll over without throwing up he finds Pansy sitting up against his headboard on the other side of his bed, fully dressed and reading some worn romance novel.
“I won’t hurt it anymore.” He says quietly, eyes closing for only a second before he brings himself back up to face level. “I promise.”
“What are you waiting for?” Draco murmurs to him, eyes hungry, and then he kisses Harry again right before Harry firmly places a hand on Draco’s arse, feeling it, even squeezing it, and causing both of them to let out quiet noises of mingled shock and excitement.
Harry takes the cup he’s offered, eyeing Draco in return before frowning. “Better than you. What the hell are you supposed to be? The sun?”
"Of course, Mother." He looks ahead as well, spotting Pansy's trunk just as it disappears into the train.
Harry laughs at the muttered curses coming from his best friend. “I guess it just took me by surprise. I never realized how serious of a problem the cookbook was until Ron brought it to all of our attention and I’m sorry, Ron but I never understood how passionate you were about the cause.”
Ron comes out of the kitchen with three cups of tea hovering beside him. After seeing Harry hidden in Hermione's embrace he directs them over to the table before moving closer, unsure what to do.
Harry sees the arm Neville has around Luna’s shoulders tighten a fraction, and he looks out the side of the carriage and smiles to himself. That is one thing the war didn't make him regret.
To this day Draco isn’t sure where he had fallen in the divide. He had been busy trying to exceed in every class and get in Umbridge’s good books. He’d been with Crabbe and Goyle and watching Harry and his friends trying to see if it was true and the Saviour had really cracked and gone mad.
"Because they weren't speaking to me either!" Draco refutes though it sounds weak now. "How was I supposed to know-"
Ron breathes out slowly as if silently asking somebody for strength. “Why does everybody keep forgetting we shared dorms in school? Honestly, you and Harry weren’t doing a good job at hiding it.”
And then he’s gone leaving Harry to stare after him for a long time before finally dropping his face into his hands.
Harry shakes his head a bit, swallows. His lips are shiny and plump and Draco licks his own. “Not very. I don’t think we were cut out to be friends.”
He bites his tongue, wondering if that sounds like bragging to her. Wondering if she will be insulted, as if he is making a point of how well the Weasley’s are when she’s usually alone in her house and her husband is locked in Azkaban.
"No," Blaise agrees. "But see, Draco, if you actually work at it and don't run away like a coward- well."
He sneers at Harry. “Not scared being seen with me will ruin your image even more? Or is this where you tell me to fuck off and never speak to you again?”
The Eighth Years have less curses aimed at them in the halls, are doing well in school, and have been gaining them all House Points. For Merlin’s sake, they’re friends with Harry Potter and his entourage now. Even the First Years are smart enough to know to go to them for protection if they need it. And if their year can do so well after the war then of course the younger years can too.
She starts to laugh but at his tortured expression stops immediately. “Don’t worry, Draco. Severus loved you, you know that. You were something of a son to him, I think.”
He must look as baffled as he feels because she actually laughs. “I’m sorry, I’m being awfully mysterious aren’t I?”
“Please.” She’d looked away, down at her hands which were fidgeting nervously. Draco shifted so he was sitting cross-legged on the couch to face her. “After the way I rejected him in Fifth Year he’s moved on, I’m sure.”
Draco rememberss back to his Eighth Year Muggle Studies and feels a small flutter in his stomach. “Quite.”
Eventually the movie finishes and James throws a pillow at Lily to wake her up, causing a screaming match that Scorpius quickly escapes from. Draco takes James and Harry tucks in Lily, keeping her distracted until her oldest brother comes in and mumbles an apology, looking down at the floor. Then James slips out just as fast as he’d appeared, Draco shooting Harry a knowing look as they switch places. Harry catches Draco kissing Lily goodnight before he’s out of her room to go and sit with James.
“Gryffindorish?” Harry asks him, pushing down his excitement at Draco agreeing to skip the class with him. “That’s definitely not a word.”
Turns out the dementors of Azkaban and the Ministry of Magic officials don't think sending kids to school is a good enough reason for a day out of prison. Draco is lucky they’ve allowed his mother out of the Manor, since she is now under a life sentence of house arrest.
“I know what you’re going to say.” Harry breaks the silence eventually, having grown uncomfortable with Blaise’s silence and casual air.
“Yes, you git.” Theo says before looking him over closely. He sighs and glances at Blaise. “No hickeys to speak of.”
But after… when Harry had gazed at him with that look in his eyes Draco was brought right back to Hogwarts. Brought right back to his parents words and why he’d ended it all that time ago.
if I didn’t care what they think? If I didn’t think there was some chance this would kill any love they have for me?”
“Oi! I’ll have you know plenty of people are desperate for my company, no matter my alcoholic state!”
He’s been doing a lot of that lately. Just letting everyone else dictate what he was supposed to do now, where he was meant to go. He feels purposeless in a way that is unfamiliar to him. It’s like without Voldemort Harry doesn’t know what he’s meant to do anymore.
Teddy has a few friends his age arriving later but for now it’s just close friends and family- which basically means Harry, Ron and Hermione and Draco. And thought Harry is nervous to see Draco again after everything that’s happened between them, he tries not to dwell on it.
“Potter.” Draco shakes his head at the unpredictability of him. “I know. I was- some Slytherins and I were already going. I already knew about the party.”
More silence until Ginny speaks up. “McGonagall made you leave. And besides, even if you had stayed we couldn’t really expect you to fight your own families, no wonder what you thought of the whole thing yourselves. I could never try to seriously hex my Mum or Dad, or any of my siblings.”
“Of course it matters! You’re hurting yourself by keeping this- you and him, the real extent of your feelings- a secret if you care about him that much!”
Draco huffs softly. “You bastard.” Then his eyes widen as a thought strikes him. “So in Third Year, when you threw the snow at me in Hogsmeade…”
“You are so arrogant!” Draco shouts right back at him as soon as he recovers. “Not everything is about you, Potter, why can you never get that through your thick head!”
He wonders if his mouth goes dry from want or nervousness and then decides it doesn’t matter as he takes in Harry’s cock. It rests slightly against his stomach and Draco licks his lips again before looking up to meet Harry’s eyes.
Harry raises an eyebrow and Draco narrows his eyes at him. “Come on, Harry, time’s a ticking and all that.”
“Yes Happy Christmas, dear.” Molly says distractedly as she turns to her other son. “Percy you take those shoes off right now.”
Ron looks up and meets his eyes. Harry watches along with everybody else as slowly, just barely, Ron nods at Draco and Draco nods back.
He reaches out for Harry to take his hand, his anger from moments ago gone, because this is something he’s been meaning to bring up with Harry for a while now. “But you can talk to me. Or any of the others. About your nightmares, about the war, about not being sure… You can tell us these things Harry.”
Teddy, who is his godson. Teddy, who is living with his grandmother, Andromeda, but is otherwise alone. Harry made a vow, the first day he went to spend with him, that he wouldn't let Teddy grow up like he had. Teddy wouldn't have anyone like the Dursleys to replace his parents, and he wouldn't have an absent godfather.
“Especially when those friends are former Death Eaters.” Molly comes bustling in with a tray in her hands, Arthur and Percy following, both of them laden with food as well. “So? What’s that about?”
He does a few loops around the stands, eyes alert for any sign of golden movement. His attention is snagged by Nelson making the first goal and then Nadia hustling the Quaffle back to score almost immediately after on Cory to even them up. Most of the game is spent with the players dropping the ball and having to dive down to pick it up from the ground, or catching it midfall, but the players are laughing and calling out good-naturedly to one another, so Harry only smiles to himself and watches it all. Draco’s laugh carries over to him once or twice, and he even hears the oldest Slytherin calling out encouragement to his team here and there.
Would this ever stop? He wonders. Was today just a particularly bad day for memories because it was Harry’s first time back in this place, around Narcissa, the absence of Lucius Malfoy hanging over them all? Or will he and Draco always stumble along these chasms of distance, these moments their opinions had disagreed so widely that it puts them on opposite sides once more?
The Malfoy's defense has stated Draco pleads non-guilty to the charge of murdering Dumbledore. Harry sits forward, not wanting to miss a word.
He sighs, not wanting to explain Slytherin House politics to her. It’s just their way, for the older students to look out for the younger ones. It always has been, and even this year the younger kids look at Millie, Pansy, Theo, Blaise and him and they see how they’re doing alright and take hope from it.
? No!” Ron sounds so frustrated Harry can only stare up in shock as he leaps from the chair, apparently giving up some sort of mission. “No, Harry I don’t have anything to tell you. But if I
In all there are two First Years, one from Second, two from Fourth Year, two from Fifth, one from Sixth and one from Seventh.
Draco shoots her an affronted look and Millie answers with a grin. “Don’t worry Draco, I have total faith in you. It’s Potter’s fashion sense I worry about.”
“All that stuff you said about Slytherins and us since the war.” Draco never looks up to meet Harry’s eyes. Harry can’t look away from his face, even though his touch is extremely distracting. “When did you start thinking like that?”
Girls make a habit of leaning over so their breasts are right in Harry’s face, and the men don’t hold back from trailing their hands across his shoulders and arms, and Draco hurts himself more and more by not looking away.
"You weren't exactly subtle mate," Ron speaks around the biscuit he's chewing. "Just never would have thought you were still pining over him, even now."
He escapes to the kitchen and Hermione's eyes are filling with tears as her hands fall to open before her.
He forces himself to stand up to his full height and stare forward defiantly, not meeting anybody's eyes or listening to their whispers. He knows what they're saying. They've been saying it all summer after all.
Harry had burned that letter right away and ranted to Ron and Hermione about it for a week. Both of them are very familiar with the name of Nigel Harrington, and to never, ever answer letters from him.
When his eyes find Draco he sees the blonde watching it intently before feeling Harry’s eyes on him and turning to grin in challenge. With an answering look Harry mounts and kicks up, feeling the wind whistle in his hair as he and Draco move to hover in front of each other in the pitch, their teams spread behind them.
None from his childhood stand out. Not even coming to Hogwarts or his first classes or the excitement of getting his letter or joining the Quidditch team. All of it is tainted by the knowledge of what he would do to try and help destroy Hogwarts later.
to trust other Houses.” Draco interjects. “But it’s long overdue for everyone to make a little bit of effort.”
What had Draco thought? That reminding him of Dobby would make Harry hate him? Did he think he would have ended what was going on between them because of it?
"I know, I know," Draco mutters, thinking back to that day in Madame Malkin's Robe shop, abrupt longing shooting through him. "We were idiots."
He keeps flipping through quickly, wanting to see who else is in there and not even glancing up when Draco sinks to sit down beside him.
Bill rolls his eyes and Fleur smirks. “It’s been in the papers for months now. Harry here-” he nods at him, “hiya by the way- and Malfoy were all over the
“I- you don’t know that! I’m horrible at giving presents, just ask Ron and Hermione. It could be either of them. Or Ginny.”
Draco moves to stretch across the bed, grabbing the bottle of lube from his bedside drawer. There’s still a bit of an ache from last night and his body hums with the knowledge that it will subside in just a few moments.
“Maybe it’s true.” Harry’s smile doesn’t fade and he turns over again to look at Draco, trousers back up to his hips but not zipped up or buttoned. Draco’s robes have also been haphazardly pushed down in place.
“You didn’t have to do that.” Draco’s chest is heaving. “You could have just told Blaise to stop being a nosy bastard and left it at that, none of them would have suspected a thing.”
A while later they’re both naked and tangled with one another, satisfied and ready to sleep. But Harry is so happy he can’t help but kiss Draco one last time, lips pressing together softly.
“Great.” Draco seems to be trying to stay fairly upbeat but Harry can see the constant reminder of his sentence is starting to irritate him. He doesn’t know what he could say to help so instead he just tries to pretend he’s not here, knowing Draco would rather that than be further embarrassed.
assigned to their correspondence and to be honest they were more often stationed at the Ministry than Hogwarts.”
He barely hears his mother as his mind races. If these were truly the only letters tampered with they had been done in an effort to… what? Hurt Draco by causing him pain and suffering? To protect Harry, perhaps, from the Death Eater everyone had believed him to be?
“Oh no,” Draco actually takes a step back as if Harry is about to just chuck Teddy into his arms. “No, you take your time with him.”
When Draco curls his fingers again Harry bites the forearm holding him up lightly to muffle his whimper.
“Ginny,” Blaise’s voice is shaking slightly Draco notes with surprise. It’s not often he sees his friend unsure. As he keeps speaking though he grows more confident. “You are the most inspiring person I’ve ever met. Every day you challenge me in the best way and make me grateful that I’m the person you’ve chosen to spend your life with. You make me want to be better, in any way I can. Nobody’s ever made me feel that before, but for you I want to, not only for myself, but because you only deserve the best. And I vow, in front of friends and family, that I will spend the rest of our lives making sure that’s what you get.” Blaise cracks a smile. “You being the sexiest woman I’ve ever known is just a bonus.”
“I see.” Blaise sounds like he’s musing out loud. “So you’re thinking what if Draco loses his family, his name and his fortune because of you and then later, if things don’t work out, he also loses any chance of regaining the acceptance of the general public.”
Draco goes down to breakfast a couple of days later to find his mum already sitting there and drinking tea. When she sees him she doesn’t try to hide her smile as she nods to the small pile of envelopes sitting at his chair like usual.
“Yes.” She seems relieved that he’s reached the correct conclusion without her having to say it. “I don’t want to ruin anything for you all, Harry, but I just- I can’t wrap my head around it. You might not think it’s my business, but I’ve made no secret of the fact that you’re a part of this family, at least to the rest of us. And those children…” She purses her lips. “Maybe the others are different, I can’t say I know much about most Slytherin families, but Malfoy? After all he’s done to you? To Hermione, Ron and Ginny? I know what his father’s like-”
There’s a bit of judgement in his tone and Harry tenses a bit. “Probably not for the reasons you’re thinking. And no, that’s not it. Not… exactly.”
The two of them slip onto the Gryffindor bench and Harry keeps watching Draco even as the other wizard begins piling his plate up with food.
“I-” Harry snaps his mouth shut, flushing, and Draco’s grin widens. “You looked awful that whole year, it was obvious.”
He wants to say it isn’t that easy. That she doesn’t know what she’s talking about and can’t understand. What Harry is asking of him is a lot. Too much. Definitely too soon. He can’t just bare his heart and soul for Harry and trust that the other wizard won’t make a mistake or break it. Draco’s not a trusting person, and while he trusts Harry a hell of a lot more than he does other people, it’s still too daunting for him to be honest with everyone about who he is and trust that Harry will be there to pick up the pieces. Not when he knows how most of the world already feels about him.
Draco hears the intake of breath of Blaise beside him, and when he glances over his friend is staring at Ginny like she’s the only thing that exists.
He’s surprised at the bit of anger he feels looking at her now. He’s worked so hard to move past it and keep things civil with his parents. He’s never brought up the letters or being gay or Harry again and neither have they. At first it had been difficult, but he’d also been in France for six months. By the time he’d come back home Draco had resigned himself to everything.
Oh Merlin. What is Draco thinking? If Harry hadn’t wanted to have sex with Ginny after four months of dating why would he want to with Draco after only half that time doing… whatever it is they’re doing?
Soon an hour has passed and then two. Teddy is happily flipping through his new books with Andromeda, Ron and Hermione, leaving Harry to go and stand by the cake table with Draco.
“If I can’t look like this, you definitely shouldn’t be allowed to look like that.” Draco says softly in a hush before stroking Harry’s cheek. “That’s the kind of expression that would make anyone fall in love with you, you know.”
“Ah, yer all busy with studyin’ I expect.” He looks around and when his gaze lands on Pansy, Theo, Millie and Blaise they straighten up noticeably, which makes Draco have to hold back a smile. Hagrid doesn’t bother and his grin stays firmly in place when his perusal stops at Draco. “Alright, Draco?”
The blonde looks back up at him, completely bewildered. He’s blinking and something in Harry sinks, it squeezes tightly in his chest and he bites his lip at the sudden bolt of absolute
“You should.” Draco walks lightly beside him, radiating glee. “Luna puts in the most amazing things. She’ll slip in passing references to all of you here and there.”
“You’re a student.” Harry had said furiously. “McGonagall or somebody should be protecting you from that kind of thing-”
“Good morning darling.” She turns a page and then puts the book down on her lap, finger holding her place. “Or afternoon, really. Good thing it’s a Saturday because you look like shite.”
“Oh Harry.” Ginny says fondly. The wind blows her hair and she tucks it back behind her ears in a harried fashion.
Harry’s look becomes understanding and he looks back over at the statue. “Yeah,” he agrees. “They sound pretty incredible.” A small frown steals over his face.
“I’ve never gone to Hogsmeade with you.” Draco continues his trend of inane statements and then seriously debates banging his head against the library table.
“If guests are supposed to arrive at two they should be getting here any minute.” He notes. “Molly is there anything I can help with before you get too busy?”
She swallows and Ron seems to be visibly radiating anger. “I think it’s great, you trying to be Malfoy’s friend.” She says finally. “I do. But I don’t know that we can do it too, Harry.”
It also doesn’t hurt that Draco gives the most fantastic hand jobs that Harry has ever received. It’s not a slight to Ginny, nor meant to be, and Harry chalks it up to the fact that Draco has experience, what with being able to practice on himself for years.
“Are you supposed to be Umbridge?” He asks through his tears of laughter as he doubles over and Ron crosses his arms.
Harry shrugs. "Won't be much of a change really, will it Gin?" He asks her and she shakes her head. "I mean, we were friends before our relationship and during it, so I don't see why after has to be any difference."
Showing up outside of the Manor’s gates is less than ideal, given that it’s raining steadier here than it had been outside of Ron and Hermione’s, but Harry pushes on nonetheless.
But he pushes all of that out of his mind as he turns to corner Draco in the small space. It’s big enough for three, maybe four people, but Harry crowds Draco against the wall, placing his hands on the wall on either side of the blonde’s face and leaning forwards to bring them chest to chest.
himself home and proceeds to drink an entire remainder of a bottle of Ogden's whiskey throughout the course of the night.
Something about the interested way Draco listens to Hagrid makes him think it’s the latter, and the newfound knowledge makes Harry soften.
Usually he hates Halloween, just because of his parents, but today it’s actually been… nice. He hasn’t thought about them since this morning, and even then, it was more a passing remembrance than the usual pain-filled thoughts. Tonight, there was no Troll in the dungeons, no fear of Voldemort or anger at everything that’s been taken from him. Today Harry enjoyed himself and made new memories of Halloween; and he’s pretty sure that no matter what happens he’ll treasure them.
“They’re celebrities to everyone. Even to me.” He says quietly. “But I’ve known people who became just as famous, people who are remembered just as fondly. And I know it can’t be the whole truth.”
Pansy will walk through his house, picking up stray clothing with her wand and muttering, "And we're friends with this slob?" under her breath. She'll say nothing else, but the looks she gives him are questioning and worried deep down, and he wonders if she sees Draco in a similar way. If he's doing any better or worse than Harry is.
He finally looks up to see Draco’s pinched expression. The Slytherin looks a cross between miserable and scared. Harry swallows.
Harry doesn’t protest so Draco moves Harry’s hands away and waves a hand to clean the spunk from his clothing before moving to unbutton the things Harry calls blue jeans (which Draco does not at all find attractive, thank you) and push them down. Harry shifts a bit restlessly to help and Draco bites his bottom lip in hesitation for a moment before moving his hands to Harry’s boxer briefs and pushing them away as well.
Harry shakes his head. First he has to make it through this party. Get through Halloween, get through the feast, through the party, don’t do anything stupid… he can do that.
Millicent lets out a breath, suddenly appearing bored of the conversation. “I’m off to speak to Luna, actually. Ta for now.”
“-the snitch.” Harry finishes, grinning and trying to ignore the way gold suits Malfoy really well. “I like that.”
“Thank you, Luna.” Draco says in an attempt to gain control of the conversation. “Honestly, you lot are ridiculous. Are you so desperate for your own love lives that you invent ones for us? Don’t you think you’d know if we were screwing? We all practically live in one another’s pockets.”
He frowns. “But in the war I never commanded anybody. I just ran around with Ron and Hermione fighting until I went to Voldemort.”
“Draco.” She is so soft, eyes earnest. “You came home for Christmas in Fourth Year complaining endlessly about two things: Harry Potter going to the Yule Ball with one of the Patil twins and Viktor Krum not having enough time for you when you approached him for an autograph. Believe me, whatever your father and I had tried to convince ourselves before then we didn’t bother afterwards.”
“Oh that.” The blonde wizard reaches out to hold Harry’s hand while watching him carefully. “I’ve had a job offer.”
“I don’t know exactly what you think of my husband and I, and truly I don’t think I want to. Back in the summer I would have guessed you hated us, but your actions at Draco’s trial and in coming here make your true feelings less clear.” Her eyes shoot from Harry to Draco and back again. “I know the history between the two of you is complicated and I know that it is unlikely your relationship with either Lucius or I will be truly easy, but I would like to make you understand something.”
Draco turns one fruit slice over in his fingers, ignoring how sticky they become. “I told you I’m perfectly safe. My superior is one of the most respected Aurors there.”
Blaise nods and they spend a little while longer sitting out at the lakeside until heading back in. This time Harry’s shoulders feel a little lighter than they had before.
“It seems like all of Great Britain knows that.” Draco mutters, surly, making Harry kick him under the table.
She holds up a hand, staring into the fire and ready for the piece of parchment to come back. The fire spits it out and she snatches it from the air, reading quickly and a grim look settles on her face before she hands the note to Draco and hurriedly writes another, sending it away in the same style.
