The cat is an excellent breed with a good character, only he doesn’t like the name Theophanu gave him, it would be your task to give him a more appropriate name. Marv will be waiting for an answer as to when I can introduce the cat to you.
I always assumed my hair looked like my father’s, which would be true about its colour, but the structure is not straight like his.  It’s curly like my mother’s. It may sound like a matter of little importance to you, but it makes an immense difference. I can wear my hair in a style I’ve always liked but never dared even consider, assuming I would look like my father.
“Please. Too many clothes!” He let Harry unbutton his shirt, then pulled up Harry’s t-shirt. Harry slipped out of it, then they stumbled into Harry’s room.
“Say hello to your new cat.” She held up a travel basket. Inside, a black cat was rolled up; he was rather small and seemed to be fast asleep.
“You might be away from home for a while, do you need anything important, like potions you take regularly, or something like that?” Weasley inquired.
“Or worse, he might hex or curse me. I know how often people on the street do that, or they spit at me. I can live with the correspondence ending, but I can’t live with seeing hate in his face.”
Many other things had changed in the meantime. After the house bonding, Harry had moved into Grimmauld Place permanently, as well as Andromeda and Teddy, who had a whole floor of their own, while Cupid had found a life partner in Grimmauld Place’s only resident gnome. Draco was in the process of giving up his old flat, after having lived there only on paper for a long time now.
With a resolute wand movement, they charmed themself into their second costume. It was a velvet dress in a blue so dark it was almost black, with lace sleeves embroidered all over with constellations. Some people in the audience gasped. They managed this, despite the distress of their father being here.
“I don’t think my name is Obliviate. The female called me Cupid. I have no idea.” The gnome offered between noisily chewing on a piece of raw cauliflower.
The hand moved into the pyjama bottoms. Draco felt skin on skin, yet he could still see his own hand lying motionlessly on the blanket in the wand light.
He expected the sensation of hair in his hands or of holding on to something in order not to topple over, but his right hand felt as if it ghosted lower and grabbed his cock. The man’s loud thoughts weren’t words he spoke to someone else. He was wanking. Draco felt his blood rushing into his groin. The silver-eyed seeker was the man’s wank phantasy. And Draco couldn’t resist his own wank phantasy, being fucked against the Quidditch shower wall and feeling his partner’s callused hands on his nipples.
“Sorry, no significant other in sight.” Draco said bleakly. He turned to Nippy. “Good afternoon, nice to meet one of the elves who took care of Paw.”
“Don’t give up. I don’t need divination to see that things are not staying like this indefinitely. And maybe you will find an opportunity to move out temporarily.” Conrad smiled at him.
Draco had never thought that there would be so much pain behind Potter’s silent stare into a middle distance. Although that day, in 1999, he had also talked about the people he had lost.
Maybe you could visit us in Grasse? You haven’t been to France in a long time. And there is someone I want to introduce to you. I accept that you don’t want to live in France, but I would like to hear your opinion about Constantine, the man who started courting me. He is very different from your father, he is patient, a humorous storyteller and a good listener. Originally, he is from Wales, but he has lived in France since his teenage years.
“No, he thought pureblood men don’t hug and from when I was seven years old, my mother also only hugged me secretly. He was very abusive, to me and to Mother. I’m glad he will never be part of my life again.” It was the first time Draco had said this to someone face to face who wasn’t his therapist. He had written it to Luna and Prongs, but then he had not seen their reactions in the same second.
“I won’t Obliviate someone if there’s another, less harmful way. And I think an Unbreakable Vow can serve the purpose very well, here.” She rubbed one of her braids between her fingers.
“It’s – it’s comfortable! How can dressrobes be comfortable?” Potter mumbled to himself as he peered into the mirror.
“Outside this task force, nobody will know that it’s not you who’s going to work again on Monday. Could you give us some hair for that? If you're too vain, leg or chest hair will do.” When Draco had cut off a strand of his hair, Weasley opened the door. “Junior Aurors Shahin and O’Dell, come in, please.”
“Merlin, yessss!” They moved closer to each other, and Harry felt that Draco was just as hard as he was. He wanted to feel that wonderful body with less layers of clothes.
She sighed. “Yes, that would be great, but you know what Father did to the heiress rings and that I can’t take it off unless Daphne agrees to marry him, because I don’t have any unmarried cousins on the Greengrass side.”
How often he had insulted Potter to hide that he fancied him. But he didn’t have the right to be rude to Prongs. Prongs, the only person who fascinated Draco as much as Potter. He had never seen him or heard his voice, but in his fantasy, Prongs had black hair, green eyes and was a bit smaller but stronger than him, just like Potter. Draco guessed he would never get Potter out of his fantasies, even though he could very well imagine himself fancying Prongs with his witty comments on politics and Quidditch and his patience with his seven students.
“That’s what one calls a friend.” Potter’s voice sounded like a deadpanning voice, but his smile was like the sun coming through between the clouds.
“Camera off!” Karamo yelled over his shoulder, while Antoni put a comforting hand on Draco’s shoulder.
Tan asked him for a tour of his wardrobe. The grey-haired man took shirt after shirt out, and again and again his smile turned to a frown upon noticing how threadbare some places of the shirts were. “What do you wear when you have special occasions?” he finally asked. “All your wardrobe looks like it’s ready for retirement. But you are still young. The only new-looking things I see here are labcoats and scrubs.”
“Thank you, I thought so.” He said while closing the door of his rooms behind him and inviting the other man to set off. “Hey! Not everybody can dress up as a sexy vampire and call it a day! Us mortals have lower aspirations.” The sound of their shoes on the stone echoed in the empty hallway, following their steps like a second entity.
Harry’s chuckle ringed in his ears. “You do have your mind in the gutter all the time!” He accused; amusement evident in his voice. “I will not admit anything without the presence of my lawyer.” “Afraid I will tease you to death, love?” Asked Harry, kissing him behind the ear. He snickered softly. “I thought I was the tease of the two of us.” He leaned against Harry’s chest, while his fiancé put his chin on his shoulder, cheek to cheek. “Believe me, I know. I learned from the best, after all.” The man breathed softly. He could hear the smile in Harry’s voice, but could not find anything to say, his eyes lost in the landscape.
Harry’s were bathed in sun’s rays for most of the day, the wood was lighter in colour, giving the place a more homely vibe. Red curtains framed the wide windows with a beautiful view of the Dark Lake, and you could find personal belongings on every surface. It was a little bit messy, for Draco’s taste, but he loved it for that exact reason.
Once he was in the master bedroom, he made his way to the bathroom. It was one of his favourite rooms in the house. With a walnut wooden floor, elegant carpets, green floral wallpaper, deep green furniture, with golden details, and some plants in the corners, it was easy on the eye and helped to relax.
Draco picked up the gold band with his long fingers. “This, is for you.” He declared, taking his hand and slipping the ring into his finger, which magically adapted in a perfect fit. “So, this is yours…” Harry stated, picking up the platinum ring and put it on Draco. They intertwined their hands so the rings would be side by side. “Who would have thought you had such a great taste. I’m starting to rub off on you.” Teased Draco, his eyes twinkling with glee. “You really like them?” His tone showed how relieved he was more than he would have liked to. Draco brought his hand to his mouth and kissed the ring. “They’re perfect. The best gift I ever received. Now I feel bad for what I had in store for you.” He looked down, not meeting his eyes, his cheeks deepening in colour. God, he loved a flustered Draco.
Just like that, he slid up the long slick shaft and back down with exasperating slowness. They put aside the bickering and the only sounds filling the room were the heavy breaths and little moan escaping from their lips. Harry let him pick the pace and just accompanying his movements with small thrusts of his hips. They were in perfect sync and the world disappeared for the time being. Harry’s face was buried in his chest, leaving sloppy kisses on his burning skin. Where had his glasses gone? Another display of wandless magic. Had Harry even noticed, or did he just do it without realizing? And why did he find all that so irresistible?
As he stood there, in the middle of the room, with the red roses bouquet in hands and ring box heavy in his pocked, he could taste his own heart. He had never been so tense in his whole life. Maybe when he went into the forest to be killed by Voldemort, but it still was a close second place. What if Draco would have said no? What if it was too early? He knew that Draco wanted to get married in a foresee future, but maybe he was not ready. What if he did not like the rings? He had not shown anyone the couple of jewels. He had saw them by chance while walking around Muggle London and his heart had told him they were made for them. They were the rings. And as the Gryffindor he was, he had just followed his gut. He knew he should have asked Pansy for her opinion, but he wanted to do it by himself. How could he be a good husband if he was not even able to buy the right rings for him and Draco? That was what he had thought and at that very moment he started to regret his decision.
“Stop with the teasing. Inside me. Now.” A low chuckle echoed in the room. “Teasing?” Enquired Harry, “I’m preparing you.” He saw the mirth in his lover eyes and playful smile. “Every second your cock isn’t inside me it’s teasing.” Green eyes darkened. “The words that come out of that sinful mouth of yours…” He groaned with scorching desire.
After the initial stretch, he got to enjoy the slow descent. Hot, thick and hard flesh, skin so smooth it felt divine against his sensible entrance. The sensation of Harry’s freshly shaved dick sliding deep inside him was, as always, glorious. The contrast between the silky skin and the roughness of his hardness was maddening. He bit down his lip, as he finally seated in Harry’s lap, feeling the tingling of his pubes under his perineum.
A big smile broke on his lips. “I love you, too, sap. But remember, you own me a dance.” He joked, winking at the man.
At the thought of their fight in the morning, the knot in his throat become heavier and new tears threatened to fall.
Draco moved, and settled between his legs, strong hands on his thighs. Harry thought the pleasurable torture was finally over and his cock twitched excited. He was growing more impatient by every second. Patience had never been a strength of his.
When they were both out of breath, they broke apart, panting, still embracing each other. “I love you too, Draco… I’ll give you everything, as long as you do the same.” He nodded enthusiastically. “I’m yours, I’m all yours.” Harry hummed pleased.
“You’re so thigh, Draco…“ He breathed out, overwhelmed by the sensation of finally being inside his lover. “You’re the one with the huge prick!” Whined Draco, with glassy eyes. “Do you want me to stop?” He asked a little bit concerned. He should have prepared Draco a little longer. “Don’t you dare!” He did as he was asked, pushing another inch in and provoking the hottest whimper of pleasure by his lover. Draco arched impossibly his back, his hands grabbed the sheets underneath him and his eyes went white, all signals of pleasure.  Happy to carry on, he sank another couple of inches and that caused his jaw to fall low from the physical gratification. Draco’s walls wrapped around him tightly, a burning warmth that was melting every ability to think.
What he had not expected, was Potter to forgive him for all he had done to him, become his friend and, eventually, asking him out. And before he noticed, half a year had passed since they started dating. They still bickered a lot, although it missed the bite of their school days. They just liked to tease each other.
Out of the blue, his towel vanished in thin air. He arched an unimpressed brow to Potter, who had a shit-eating grin plastered on his stupidly handsome face. “What? It isn’t fair I’m the only showing off his goods, is it?” He gave a slow uninhibited stroke at his cock and Draco almost screamed for how hot the action was.
He also made himself more conformable, sitting right next to Potter, their arms touching. “I just need a cup of tea with honey, and I’ll be all right.” His voice came out a little strained, but it was to be expected. “Here,” Potter, showing off once again his power, summoned a glass of water, that he handed to him. “It’s not tea, but it will help.” He drunk in big gulps, not really minding his poise. The cool fluid hydrated the dry walls of his throat and gave him some relief. “Thanks, I needed that.” “Don’t mention it.” A nice silence fell on them.
Was Harry on the other side of the door? As the thought formed inside his head, hope bloomed in his chest. With a few quick steps, he was at the door. But as he opened it, disappointment washed over him like a waterfall.
He wondered once again where he could have gone. Was Harry visiting his parents grave? Did he go to Weasley and Granger’s? But most importantly, was he feeling lonely? Did he need him? Did he need someone to hold him and remind him he was not alone? Maybe his heart was being selfish and arrogant, but it craved to be that special someone for Harry. Draco loved him. There was no point in denying it. He spent most of his time thinking about him, yearning his touch, his smiles and his eyes on him. The blond was aware he sounded crazy, but that was the truth. He was mad about the man.
“Thanks.” “I should thank you, Malfoy, after all, you’re the one about to suck me off… although it may be too early for thanks, let's see if that pretty mouth of yours is worth it.” Potter sure knew what buttons to push to rile him up. Taking the hard cock in his hand, he gave a good squeeze, getting out of him a sound between a hiss and a moan. “I’m going to give you the best suck of your life, Potter.” He drawled in a low and dangerous voice, his other hand wandering along his thigh, feeling the coarse expanse of hair under his palm while jerking him off, with slow and long strokes. He pressed a feather-like kiss over his Adonis belt, before giving it a bite and tasting the man’s skin, a little bit salty from the sweat, but delicious. He kissed a trail following the muscle, until reaching the side base of his cock, nose nested in his, surprisingly trimmed, pubes. Potter smelled like a man, musky and sultry, and Draco started to believe that he could be into any kink if it was related to Potter.
“What about now?” Harry took out his wand and, with a quick flick, three luminous spheres flew over their heads, dancing harmoniously among themselves, releasing small sparks that looked like stardust. Gold, sparkling dust falling from above. It was beautiful. Suddenly, slow sweet music started to play. It was kind of a jazzy sound, a lovely melody played by a piano and a sax.
Draco walked down the stairs of Grimmauld Place, completely redecorated the moment Harry had asked him to come and live with him. As he approached the kitchen, he could hear music and Harry’s voice singing over the wireless. It was something muggle, since Draco had never heard the song before, he could tell the singer was a man and it was something retro, if Harry’s efforts to teach him something about muggle culture had not been in vain.
“Harry, I’m about to come,” He panted out, eyes closed, back arched to achieve a better angle. “Good, I’m close too. So close, just a few more thrusts and I’m coming too.” Without a word, just following the need of their bodies, their rhythm became slightly faster, and that was enough to make him come all over Harry’s hand and body with a loud cry of pleasure. He rode his orgasm till the last drop, tightening around Harry so firmly that he came right after him, with deep thrusts, filling him with hot come.
Draco started to kiss his biceps, whispering words on his skin. “Your arms are so strong, I love them when they pin me onto the mattress or against the wall, but they can also be gentle and caring… Just like you…” His heart fluttered at the affectionate words of his boyfriend. They were not the words that Draco usually chose to arouse him. They were still flood with desire, but also romantic and sentimental. Harry should have not been surprised. It was a special day, after all.
He came to a stop at the entrance of the Clock Tower courtyard. Breathless and with no more strength in his legs, trembling with fatigue. The snow was covering the ground and he could feel the frostbites on his cheeks and down his neck.
“I can think of one or two things.” He winked cheekily. Draco gave him the most unimpressed look he could muster. “I should have known that all that talk about your dick being huge would have gone to your head.” Harry lifted a mischievous brow, his smile transforming into a smug grin. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, love. It’s not my fault if you have your mind in the gutter all the time. But now I’m curious, do you often think about my huge cock?” “Now you’re just taking the piss.” He said, instead of admitting that he indeed thought about his cock for an unhealthy amount of time. Confessing such information would have been inappropriate on so many levels. Besides, it was not his only thought, Harry as a whole was often on his mind, it just happened that some parts were more than others. It was not his fault if he had a high libido with a man like Harry by his side. He was gay and weak for Harry, sue him.
“Potter, what are you talking about? I had a night shift and I slept for the past six hours. I’m pretty sure I’m a mess. My hair probably is all messed up, I have bags under my eyes and my breath probably stink too because I did not brush my teeth before looking for y-“ He was interrupted by chapped lips, kissing him with an addicting sweetness. His eyes automatically closed, and his body went limp, melting in Harry’s tender embrace.
“I wish we could do this every single morning. Such a pity, we have to limit at our days off.” He thought out loud, voice dreamy from the afterglow and a goofy smile on his lips. Draco nuzzled into his chest. “Well, but that way mornings like this wouldn’t be as special, right?” They intertwined their legs and he started to stroke Draco’s back with leisurely movements. “I guess, you’re right, love. I still wish we could have a few more opportunities to do so.” Draco snorted. “Of course, you do. You horny bastard.” “You’re the one who started this morning… After two rounds last night. In my book you are the insatiable, always randy, one.” He bit back with a tender smile, because he loved to bicker about stupid stuff with Draco. It was their thing and he would never get bored of it.
When they broke apart, they leaned forehead against forehead, eyes closed, and bodies pressed together. It was perfect. He could have stood there for ever. Holding Draco tenderly and forgetting about everything else.
“Thank you.” They stood a few steps away from each other, intense silence falling on them, for interminable seconds. Harry sighed deeply. “Draco, listen, I…” But Draco did not let him finish, resolution prompted him to interrupt him and speak with voice trembling with emotion.
He did not know what he did to deserve him, but Merlin help, every day he gave him another reason to fall even harder for the boy.
When they felt satisfied, they stopped kissing and simply rearranged themselves in a real hug, with Harry’s arms around his torso and Draco’s around Harry’s neck.
An amused smile stressed his lips. It had surely been a long way coming for Kreacher to become so amenable. He still remembered how Harry cried about the gruffness of the old house-elf, who had refused to leave the house when given the opportunity but also refused to follow Harry’s directives.  Apparently, none of the Golden Trio knew that the bond between a house-elf and the house itself could be so powerful that the condition of the second could affect the other's behaviour and health. Grimmauld had been uninhabited for so long that Kreacher started to age as well and his mood mirrored the state of the house. Therefore, when Harry started to renovate the house, eliminating every single ounce of dark magic, which took a whole month and three Unspeakable, and infusing new glory to the house, Kreacher changed. Nothing too dramatic, but his posture became straighter, his voice a little less hoarse, his magic stronger and his attitude more positive. Not that now he was a ray of sunshine, but he was clearly satisfied with the house renovations and content to take care of it.
Listening to the words of the song, Draco could not help a little snort, as the song seemed to call him out on ogling his boyfriend. The noise was loud enough to catch Harry’s attention, making him turn slightly to watch Draco, a warm smile painting his lips and mischief twinkling in his eyes. To Draco surprise, he did not stop to sing along, on the contrary, after flipping the last pancake on a plate, his whole attention was directed to Draco, green eyes fixed on him and started to sing with more intent.
“What about a ride in the countryside and a picnic?” “With my motorbike?” Asked surprised Harry, brows high on his forehead and eyes shining with excitement. “But you hate flying with it.” Harry was right, he was fucking terrified of the vehicle, but Harry deserved a treat too, so his fears had to leave for the day and go on a holiday. “Yes, I do. But you love it and it’s been a while since you had a chance to ride it, isn’t it?” Harry answer came in the form of a big passionate kiss that left Draco breathless. “I love you. I love you so much, Draco Malfoy.” He breathed on his lips; foreheads pressed together. His brain liquefied at the sound of Harry’s voice, dripping with intoxicating affection. “After our engagement party, I sure hope so.” He said without thinking, his mouth quicker than his poor brain. “You’re supposed to say it back, you berk.” Huffed Harry and he felt immediately bad for being so awkward in those type of situations. “I know, sorry. I love you too.” The kiss that followed was sweeter than honey and hotter than the sun.
“Good morning.” He said contently and Harry cackled softly in his hair. “Good morning to you, love.”
The situation began to change the moment he started seeing a mind healer. Slowly healing from all the trauma of his past and war, his appetite came back and soon, Harry felt ready to speak up about a subject he had always felt uncomfortable about and wanted to change: his body. He did not feel comfortable in his skin, attractive or perceivable as an object of desire. But he did not want to spend his time commiserating himself. He wanted to get better. Working with a nutritionist and a personal trainer, he managed to reach his intention. Finally, two years after the end of the war, Harry felt alive, happy with the man he had become and starting to feel confident in his body. That was when he decided to train and become an Auror. This choice was the one that reconnected their lives, as Draco and he met again when he was hit with a nasty course that sent him to St. Mungo’s Hospital. Draco had been the healer that saved his life. Once again.
“Your vampire costume is impressive, Malfoy! You even got the fangs and the corset going on.” He gestured with his big hands at Draco, who looked at himself by reflex. “Thank you, Longbottom. I appreciate the compliment. I must admit, you look rather dashing yourself.” He tried to convey some emotion with the compliment since the man had been kind enough to come all the way down to the dungeons.
His patience was repaid when he stepped into the showers section. Auror Hussain stepped out of the shower, dripping wet, cock in full display swinging between his legs as he took his towel and started to dry himself, not noticing his look of appreciation. He thanked every god above, as that image would have come in handy once he was home, alone in his bed. He could feel his cock filling under his towel, but not enough to become a problem.
With agility derived from his Auror training, he flipped them over, making Draco shriek in surprise. He was going to tease him about that sound later. With Draco under him, pressing him into the mattress with his whole body, he kissed him fiercely, asking for no permission and opening his mouth with his tongue. Draco’s moan vibrated through their joined mouths and sent a jolt of pleasure down Harry’s spine and straight to his dripping, aching cock.
The last bouquet, wrapped in white paper and a red ribbon, consisted exactly of thirty-six Marcel Pagnol red roses, of a beautiful velvety red currant red and with the intoxicating scent of raspberry. Even Harry, who knew absolutely nothing about flowers, was impressed by the beauty of those flowers. He only hoped that they were enough to leave Draco speechless.
“Good thing there’s your huge prick always ready to satisfy me then, I don’t need all of you.” The teasing was evident in the man voice, but he still decided to pinch a buttcheck for good measure, getting a squeal back. “Oh, I see. I’m only a big cock for you, spoiled prat, and nothing else. I guess there's no reason for me to indulge you in cuddling, then? After all, I am just a walking penis.” He moved to brake off the hug, but the grip around his waist became almost mortal. “Don’t you dare. We only have a few more minutes before I have to get up and get ready for work.” Draco whined, and he knew there was an adorable pout over his lips. Pink and soft lips he wanted to kiss.
“Sorry.” “For what? For ruining me for every other man or for having deprived me of this asshole destroyer for years? You need to be more specific, love.” Harry’s laugh was cut off as Draco sank another couple of inches. “You’re impossible.” Muttered the man, whose dick throbbed inside him, telling how much the man enjoyed their little banter. “You love it.”
After what could have been a few minutes, he felt Harry shift under him and a second hand coming to stroke his hair. “Draco? Are you awake?” He straightened up, lids still heavy with sleep, but feeling less grumpy than before. One of the many Harry’s superpowers. “More or less…” His voice hoarse. “Was I comfortable enough for you?” Asked the man with a smile, while moving a lock of hair from his face. Even half-asleep, Draco recognized the besotted expression painted on his face. It was small but open, the corners of his lips slightly curved, a little crooked to the right, muscles relaxed and dreamy eyes shining like emeralds under the sunlight. His already weak knees became useless; his stomach flutter and his heart skip a beat.
His train of thought was rudely interrupted by the sight of Potter, drying in long past the shoulder hair.
Physical touch was something really important in their relationship. On one hand, there was Harry, who had been touch starved since a kid, on the other, there was him, a child raised by pureblood standard. Which meant, that he had no model of reference for that side of a relationship. He could count them on his fingers the times he saw his parents in love attitudes. Needless to say, the first attempts between Harry and him had been rather clumsy and awkward. At some point, Draco had grown tired of the situation and had Harry sat down for a talk. So, he had discovered that Harry ached contact, but did not know how to ask for it, and he explained his upbringing and how it fucked up his notion of romantic interactions. That conversation was what they had needed to relax around each other. They had started slow, holding hands while walking around Muggle London, their feet touching under the table and innocent cheek kisses. Now, they were so comfortable with each other that they did not care if they were in public or not. They would steal quick kisses on the lips if they felt the need, hands would find their place on thighs under tables, Harry arm would often be around his waist, a little demonstration of possessiveness that drove Draco crazy. When at home, Draco had no problem to find a place in Harry’s lap, demanding cuddles, and Harry was always more than happy to deliver.
“Malfoy, I’m coming!” Cried out the man, balls deep in his mouth, as he emptied till the last drop of cum down his throat. It was too much, too intense, and Draco’s orgasm burst, setting his whole body on fire. He came between Potter’s feet, surfing the weave of pleasure till the very end, the movement of his hand fast and desperate. Balls completely dry, heart fulfilled to the brim.
“The Ministry really is lucky to have such a selfless and generous soul.” “Your words, not mine. Mine would have been that anyone will be lucky to
“Almost nine inches of heaven, so thick and heavy, it never fails to make me drool like kid in front of candies…” Draco gave a good lick from base to head and Harry could feel the precum running down his skin. “I love to suck you off, even after all this time it still is a little bit of a challenge. And do I love a big challenge,” He started to rub him with long and slow frustrating strokes. Good enough to make him move his hips automatically, but not enough to satisfy his hunger of pleasure.
“Why are you smiling like that?” His words no more than a whisper, since he felt like he could not breathe properly under that gaze. Harry’s smile became wider, his impossibly green eyes searching his face, for Draco did not know what. “Nothing, You’re just… So adorable right now…” He felt heat rushing to his cheeks. How could he say something like that without batting an eye? It was not healthy for his little gay heart, which was racing in his chest, waking him up altogether.
“I can feel it.” “It doesn’t make any sense! That’s the most useless and reckless thing you could do right now…”  Draco knew he was right, but he could not help the storm of emotions inside him that made him completely irrational. “Well, after all, I’m in love with the king of recklessness, aren’t I?”
“Potter, are you there?” “Yes, yes, I would love to!” His answer sounded unsure, but he did not press further. Instead, he licked away a drop of precum from Potter’s red tip, licking afterwards his lips. He watched as Potter’s eyes darkened with want, shadowing a little of whatever was going through his mind.  “Well, you better stand up for me then.”
They stood like that, hugging each other closely, for long minutes. Just enjoying the closeness of the other. Harry’s embrace was so tender and warm. Draco had missed it so much. Even if it had only passed a short time since the last time. Shit, Longbottom was right. They were two lovesick puppies. He could not help but smile goofily against Harry’s skin.
One by one, he summoned huge bouquets of Jardin de Bagatelle roses in glass vases, and arranged them on every surface available, which were not many. When he was done, he had covered the chairs, the desk and almost every inch of floor, with the exception of a passage large enough to walk from the door to the desk. The roses were Draco’s favourite flowers and he had gone all the way to France, to Meilland Richardie, one of the world's most famous rose growers and creator of the Jardin de Bagatelle. Although the company worked mainly in the Muggle world, it also had a service for the Wizarding World, which was a blessing for Harry, who would not have been able to transport the flowers all the way to London without the use of magic. The roses evoked the famous French rose garden, with a creamy white colour shaded by roses on the contour, it exhaled a sweet and pronounced perfume and soon the whole room smelled of fresh cut flowers. He had stored the bouquets in one of the many unused rooms of Grimmauld Place, under a special charm that kept them perfect and fragrant.
“There are one thousand ninety-five roses. One for each day of the last three years we have spent together. One thousand and fifty-nine white roses, your favourite. Thirty-six red roses, one for each month. A drop of passion in a sea of purity. Like my love for you.” A light blush coloured Draco’s pale cheek and he could see his stormy eyes getting glassy. They shined like stars in a cloudy sky. “This morning you opened your heart to me and now it’s my turn, so you better listen carefully and endure all the sappiness without the sexy part, all right? It’s part of your surprise.” He said with a teasing smile, proud of himself for his steady voice. Draco nodded and pecked him on his lips. “I’m all ears.”
He was dead tired. His partner and he just had their annual physical evaluation and they had made them sweat till the last drop of water in their bodies. He was in desperate need of a cool bottle of water and a long shower. They had been the last pair of the day, so he expected the locker room to be empty. He was in no mood for loud chattering and people in general. Matthew, his partner and a short funny man, had gone directly home, so he was all alone and he had no one rush his shower.
Pansy would have been so disappointed.  They had promised each other several times that they would never allow a man or woman to make them miserable. Life was too short to cry over that shit. But there he was. Feeling empty, heart heavy in his chest and cold. It was so cold without Harry wrapping himself around him. Harry was always warm. His touch, his kisses, his words too. Nobody had ever held him so tenderly, so kindly. Draco had not had a lot of relationship before Harry. Some one-night stands, an almost-boyfriend but not quite. Harry had been his first in many instances. He just hoped, with all his being, he would not be his first breakup.
“Your shoulders are wide and solid. I love the way they fill your clothes, especially your Auror uniform… Those shoulder were strong enough to carry the weight of the whole world, even before becoming so muscular.” Draco trailed up his body, nibling at his shoulders, sending little shivers of pleasure down his spine. His cock was getting harder and harder and his willpower was wavering. It was too early to surrender, besides, he liked where it was going.
His heavy steps and his panting echoed in the empty hallways. He was not sure how long he had been running. Probably only minutes, but they felt like hours. He did not care. His whole being was burning with yearning. He wanted to see those impossibly green eyes. Feel those full lips on his. His heart was bursting, he needed to tell him he was sorry, that he loved him. That was the moment for him to be brave and daring. At least one time in his whole life.
Harry scissored his fingers inside him, stretching him for the biggest part of him if Draco excluded his heart. He could feel his cock oozing precum and wondered if Harry’s was in a similar state. Lost in thought, he jolted against Harry’s body when he pressed down the bundle of nerves inside him. “God, the sounds you make… The hottest thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life.”
“Draco…” Came a breathless voice that he could have recognized among a thousand. He spun around and before him there he was. With his long hair tied in a messy bun, golden glasses framing his eyes and dressed in all leather, Harry was a sight to behold. He was wearing a long black dragonhide coat, with jagged and ruined edges. An elaborate verdant leather waistcoat hugged his wide chest, with four belts on the front and the silver buckles shined softly under the light of the torches on the walls. Underneath all that, a simple black turtleneck, which Draco envied so much at that exact moment, now shivering with cold.
“I see… maybe I should be more direct, shouldn’t I?” He felt Potter’s breath on his neck, and he turned around, finding himself face to face with the man, who was sporting a smug smile. Smugness never looked hotter or more dangerous. His heart was beating so hard and loud, it was all he could hear. “What you’re doing, Potter?” “As I said, being direct…” Replied Potter, positioning his hands at the sides of Draco’s head, trapping him against the lockers. Green eyes piercing through his soul. He was going to die. At least the last thing before his eyes would have been Potter’s naked torso, wet with sweat. There were worse ways to perish.
He would slowly wake up, his senses focusing, Harry’s hard and warm body under him, their legs intertwined. The only sound he would hear Harry’s soft snores, something he should not have found so adorable, yet he did. He would rearrange himself against his boyfriend, head buried in his neck, front pressed on his side, his free arm around the wide torso, hugging him tenderly. He would fall asleep again and when he would wake up the second time, Harry would have his arm around Draco’s waist and his face snuggled in his hair. Harry would mumble a “good morning”, his voice still thick from sleep.
“Not to ruin the moment, but do you think you can do something about your cum dripping out my ass? I swear, not only you’re hung like a Hippogriff, you cum like one too.” He burst out laughing, because how could you not? His boyfriend was hilarious without even knowing. “Why are you laughing?” Asked confused Draco, brows frowned together. “You’re ridiculous! I love you so much!” He was able to say in his laughter. He left a kiss on his forehead, which made Draco slightly blush. It was endearing how he could say such dirty words without batting an eye and then get flustered by an innocent kiss. He waved his hand, casting a scouring charm over them.
It was rather uncommon for them to be so mild. Usually, they were quick to deepen the kiss and lose control, requesting for more. More passion, more naked skin to touch and more pleasure. Between them was often fire and torching desire. So intense to be almost consuming. But then there were moments like that, where little touches were all they needed. They were rare, but those tender occasions held a special place in his heart. They were filled with nothing more than pure, simple and indulgent love. Better than the most expensive Champagne. Draco could get drunk on them every single day of his life.
As he settled into the water, a little moan of pleasure escaped his mouth. He could finally rest. Salazar knew, how much he hated night shifts at St Mungo’s. They messed up his sleep schedule and deprived him of sleeping with Harry, which was one of his favourite activities. He was not talking about sex, which was indeed in the top three, but simply sleep and doze off with him. Harry was such a cuddle bear, no matter what, he would wake up in a warm and tight embrace, and while sometimes he pretended to be annoyed by it, it made him feel safe and cared for.
The water stopped, signalising that Harry was done with the shower. His lover stepped out, wrapping himself in his white bathrobe, drying his body, as drops fell on the carpet under his feet. “Where do you want me?” Harry asked eyes as green as ever without the constriction of his glasses, which he handed to him so he could see again. “The chair in the middle.” He pointed with a nod and Harry flashed a wicked smile. He was not the only one who looked forward to the intimate experience, apparently.
“Oh God,” Whispered Harry between a kiss, “You’re so tight.” “Lose me up, then.” He panted out, short-breathed by the never-ending kisses. The momentary lack of oxygen made him light-headed and his whole body soft and pliant. Harry’s body was hot under his and he felt his heart pumping warm-lust blood in every vein, temperature rising at every touch and kiss.
As Draco swallowed half of his length, showing a little bit of mercy, warm wetness surrounding him, Harry mouth fell open in a mix of relief and satisfaction. He still made sure not a sound would come out. He still had a chance of winning. Even if very little. He felt feverish, as Draco mouth was simply divine, even if he was sucking him leisurely, not fast or deep enough to make him come. Harry never had a lover who loved to give blowjobs as much as Draco, who had a real talent for sucking cock, not just passion. He had technique and grace, not exactly a word Harry would have thought to describe fellatio, but Draco always proved to be superior to the common human being.
Harry was awakened by feather-light kisses on the corner of his eye, and his mouth morphed automatically in a tender smile. He could feel the weight of his boyfriend laying on top of his left side. Naked skin against naked skin. The kisses shifted to his jaw, then to his neck, where he lingered a little more, nibling delicately right above one of his weak spots. “Harry…” Whispered onto his skin, his name almost sounded like a prayer from Draco’s lips. He tried to not react, curious to see how far his boyfriend would have gone to wake him up.
“I don’t mean we’re perfect, we still bicker a lot and fight over stupid stuff, but we work… We work strangely well together…” “We do. We really do.” He hummed in agreement. There had been many times when things got ugly. They had the world against them and sometimes they happened to be mashed by the pressure over their shoulders. They had fights, often fruits of their own insecurities and fears, but they had always come back to each other. They had to fight almost every day to be together, but Merlin, it was worth it every second. He never felt more alive than when he was with Draco. He still felt butterflies in his stomach when he smiled brightly, eyes crinkling and dimples showing. Harry did not necessarily believe in soulmates, but Draco made him believe he was his and only one.
“Yes! Right there!” And right on clue, Harry did not hold back anymore. He started to fuck his lover with as much vigor he could master. And it was perfect. Draco moved to meet his thrusts, so he could hit even more deep. The room filled with the sound of flesh banging against flesh, the heavy breath of them and the sounds escaping from their lips, a mix of grunts and moans. A dirty melody of sex.
Eating candies while keeping an eye on the surroundings all alone, was not as bad as he had predicted. He entertained himself checking out the various costumes of his students and preventing certain public displays of affection from becoming mere exhibitionism. Were they that horny at that age? Who was he trying to fool? He was still as randy as them. It was all Potter’s fault. The always present bee inside his bonnet. Draco sighted at his failed attempt to distract himself, munching over a candy apple with too much force.
Held against his chest with strong protective arms, soaking in the bathtub, Draco did not feel the need to hear those three words, because sometimes actions were louder than words. But he did feel the need to say them to Harry, to let him know how much he appreciated him. How much he loved him.
The hot water was a cure-all for his sore muscles, he could not wait to go home, wear one of his most comfortable pyjamas and drink a good glass of wine. Wrapped in a towel, he made his way to his locker, the noise of his slippers echoing at every step.
“I’m a mandrake! Obviously!”  Exclaimed rather proudly the professor and it did not fail to steal a faint smile from Draco’s lips. “Merlin, Longbottom, you’re obsessed with those plants! Sometimes I think you wish to be one.” “Ah ah, Malfoy, very funny.” Fake laughed the other, with a light-hearted smile on his face.
In the past, he would have felt extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed, laying there, still and completely naked knowing that someone was checking out his body. For much of his life, Harry had been too thin and skinny. The Dursleys fed him what he needed, not a bite more or a single gluttony for pleasure. Only at Hogwarts he began to eat portions better suited to a growing boy, but they were unable to erase the eleven years of malnutrition suffered. Then the war took place, where the last thing on his mind was gorging himself on food. Even after the conflict, the trauma of all the losses he suffered was too much for him to concentrate on his physical well-being.
It was so intimate the concept of shaving someone in his most private parts. More than kissing, more than sex. It was thrilling and erotic. Or at least that what Draco tried to make of it. Harry usually acted like a kid who did not get the memo. Smearing shaving cream on Draco’s face or telling some stupid crass joke, that always managed to steal a laugh from him. Once, he even smacked his face with his stupid cock, something so out of character for Harry, that leaved Draco gobsmacked, and his expression must have been hilarious because the man almost fell from the chair out of laughter.
“Hello, Potter.” He said in a bored tone, with as much nonchalance as he could master, even if his heart picked up the pace in his chest. “Hi there, Malfoy.” Answered with a tired smile the man. His bronze skin was glistering with sweat, and his hair was in a half-up ponytail. It was clear he was just done with his evaluation. Draco wished he could have done his evaluation. Just the two of them. No clothes were required.
“So, you’re telling me I could have stayed in the Great Hall and you would have come to me?” Harry nodded. “Yes, of course. I would follow you everywhere, Malfoy.” Then he leaned in, catching once again Draco’s lips in a languid kiss, their mouths and tongues moving with expertise. A slow and sensual dance imprinted in their bones. As natural as breathing.
Longbottom was standing with a fist lifted in the air, eyebrows high on his forehead, mouth slightly open in surprise.
Longbottom gave him a comforting smile, proving he knew what had happened between the two of them, at a certain extent at least, but had the grace to change topic.
He lowered the foreskin, uncovering the big bloody head. Their eyes met and the usual kind green eyes were now dark with lust, so intense that he could feel his stare on his skin. He worked his length with slow movements, from base to head, twisting his grip at last and watching as Harry’s breath became heavier. His solid chest falling up and down. His touch was not enough to make him fall apart, his pace too slow to satisfy his lover, but it was enough to work him up. To make him wish for more. He wanted it to be slow and sensual. He wished for them both to taste every single bite of that moment.
With heart racing and sweaty palms, he opened their walk-in closet, where on his side rack, concealed under his invisibility cloak, was a garments bag, containing an accurately chosen suit by Pansy herself. She was one of the few who know about his intention to propose to Draco. He remembered like it was yesterday, when he requested her to meet him without mention anything to the blond man.
He was not sure how long they rode, maybe an hour, probably more. He knew that Harry easily lost track of time once he was on that motorbike. He had told him many times it made him feel free as when he rode a broom, and he felt closer to Sirius, sharing what he hoped were the same feelings and adventures.
It was a little game of them. The first one who would wake up, would have tried his best to make the other hot and bothered until admitting defeat. If they were not in the mood, a word was more than enough to make the other stop. They were always already awake when the game started to get serious, which made it even more fun.
Draco was still taller than him, if only by one inch, with elegant and sensual legs that never seemed to end. All lithe muscles, wrapped in ivory skin, with a few moles scattered here and there that he liked to discover and kiss. His favorite was the one over Draco’s pelvis. Perfect to tease him before taking his long and pink cock in his mouth. Maybe it was impartial of him, but Harry thought that Draco’s cock was the most elegant and pretty dick he had ever seen. It was a good seven inches long, thinner than his and with blond soft curls framing it. But, at the moment, he had a beautiful sight of his broad shoulders and narrow waist. His eyes quickly fell on Draco’s ass, round and firm, bouncing slightly at every step. He licked his lips unconsciously, the appetite to eat him out slowly growing inside him. Draco often joked that Harry liked to eat his ass almost as much as treacle tart, but, in all honesty, if asked which he preferred, Harry would not have been able to answer. Why choose when you can have both?
“Malfoy, nice to see you! I heard your team managed to capture that slimy potion dealer, congratulations!” He proclaimed friendly, running a hand in his hair as a big and sunny smile spread on his face.
As if Harry could hear his thoughts, his hand climbed his arm and palmed his cheek, so their eyes would meet again. And there was the reason why Draco’s fears were always proven to be completely bullshit.
Draco could feel his heart trying to jump out of his chest. Blood rushing in his veins. “I must go. I need to talk to him. I need to find him!” Longbottom tried to stop him before he could sprint away. “Hold on! He could be everywhere! You can’t just run around the castle and hoping to bump into him. Merlin! You don’t even know if he is in the castle!” “He is in the castle. I know that much.” He said with a confidence he did not know where it came from. “How?!” Longbottom almost shouted in panic.
Stopping on the doorframe of the room, the sight in front of him managed to swell his heart two sizes bigger and stir a little spark of lust deep in his stomach. Harry was at the stove, cooking what Draco guessed were his famous vanilla pancakes, in nothing but an apron, his red boxers with a pattern of golden snitch and white sport socks. He had a beautiful view of wide, muscled shoulders, stunning light dark skin, strong legs and a perfect tight ass. Being an Auror really did wonders to his boyfriend, who seemed to be, not only in better shape than their school days, but also in a better place psychologically, since he was no longer thin and scrawny and started to actually feel good in his own skin. So good, in fact, that he rarely wore any clothes around the house when they were alone, which it was both a blessing and a torture.
A knock on the door took him by surprise, making him jump on his feet and almost squeal. Almost. He still had a little bit of dignity left after all. “I’m coming.” He said with his heart in his throat.
“Thank you, Harry.” He whispered with his eyes closed, sounding content and satisfied. “For what, love?” “For always taking care of me.” He answered and when Harry spoke, he could hear the tender smile on his lips. “I love taking care of you, just the way you take care of me.” “I love you, of course, I’m going to take care of you. You and your stupid prick.” Harry laughed and it did not go unnoticed to Draco the way his cock twitched against his back. “My stupid prick and I love you too.” “You better do, or next time I’m going to shave you all clean. Every single one of your body hairs.” “No, you wouldn’t. You love my hairy ass just as much I love yours.” Replied with a calm voice his lover, pressing a kiss on his head. “You’re right, I wouldn’t. But you know I love bickering about meaningless stuff. It gets me going.” He admitted shamelessly. “It gets me hot too, love.” “I can feel that.” He wiggled between Harry’s legs, stroking his cock with his lower back. “Stop the teasing, you little shit.” Warned Harry. “Or what, big boy?” Challenged Draco.
Praised Harry with a deep voice, that did things for Draco. It made his heart flutter and his core burn with lust and love.
Since he could not drink away the pain, being in a room full of teenagers under his care, he chose to eat his weight in sweets. The second-best thing after sex. Dignity be damned.
A little gasp escaped from him, as the fingertip popped through the ring of muscle. Harry took his time before sink all the way to his knuckles and he clenched around his finger, hungry and desperate for more.
He felt himself blush and furrow his brows in a little scowl, because while before it was just flirting, now the admission seemed much more than just appreciation for a male body. It made him feel vulnerable and defensive. “Yes, I do… what about it? As I said, I’m certainly not the first to tell you…” “Well, you see, when people fawn over you for the silliest of things, it’s difficult to say if they mean it, or just want a piece me, a night with me so they can run off to the bloody Daily Prophet and have their five minutes of fame…” He took a pause, looking unsure, “That’s… that’s not what you’re doing… right?” Draco scoffed affronted. “I don’t give a fuck about the Daily Prophet! What I want, is for you to throw away that fucking towel and let me suck your cock!” His irritation seemed to entertain Potter, who flashed him a smug grin.
Reluctantly, he broke the kiss, biting for good measure Potter’s bottom lip. “Do you think you’re ready to fuck my mouth?” “Everything you want.” Three words that almost felt like a physical touch. Potter stood up, cock still hard as steel throbbing in front of his face, shiny with saliva and precum. “If it gets too much, tap my leg three times.” Instructed Potter, to with he simply nodded. He felt a cushioning charm settling under his knees. Another of Potter amazing thoughtful wandless spells.
After a quick trip to the bathroom, he wore a new pair of underwear and Harry’s shirt, which was left unceremoniously on the floor the night before, both of them to impatient to be naked in bed to care about their clothes. Draco loved to wear the other’s clothes, they would be bigger on his lean frame and soaked in Harry’s scent, a mix of his aftershave, pine and smoke. He smelled like home, a thought that became more and more frequent in the last few days, that never failed to bring out a smile on his lips and a slight redness on his cheeks. It was infuriating the way Harry managed to make him feel like a lovesick teen girl even when he was not present.
In just half a year, his ex-nemesis had become his all and everything. But did Harry feel the same? Longbottom’s last words kept to buzzing in his head and before he knew what he was doing, he began to look for a plant in the crowd. It was not difficult to find him, being one of the tallest men in the room, leaves excluded. He was looking over the dancefloor from the right side of the stage, where the band was now playing loud and energetic music.
The man obeyed, standing up abruptly and almost gouging his eyes out with his stupid huge cock. “Watch out! You almost made me blind!” And maybe it was a little dramatic, but the threat of that thing was not to be underestimated. “Sorry, sorry! Did I hurt you?” He kneeled, taking his face in his calloused hands, that managed to be kind and held him with a tenderness that made his poor heart grew too big for his chest. “Don’t’ fret, Potter. A cock isn’t enough to kill me. Even if yours could have defeated Voldemort on its own.” His attempt at a joke did not seem to be appreciated by the man, whose expression remained covered with concern.
“I see your point. So, what I’m supposed to do right now, is waiting tomorrow for him to come back?” He asked with a lighter heart. He did not know how much he needed to talk to someone about the whole situation. Longbottom shrugged his shoulder. “For us, it was like that. But I suspect your circumstances are pretty special.” The sly smile on his lips perplexed Draco. But he did not manage to ask what he meant with those cryptic words, as they arrived in the hallway leading to the Great Hall.
Then he got dressed, starting with the skin-tight black velvet pants, following with the white shirt, featuring a deep neckline decorated with volant, giving a generous view of his chest. He put on the mid-thigh high leather boots, before putting on the highlight of the whole look: a beautiful simple velvet corset with satin details, which emphasized his slender waist, making his shoulders appear broader. With the help of magic, he tightened the corset until he started to have a slight difficulty to breath. Beauty is pain, as Pansy would tell him about wearing ridiculous high stiletto heels. He picked up the heavy dark velvet cape and walked in front of the full-length mirror on the wall, throwing it back and wearing it sideways, over the right shoulder and under the left armpit. He charmed the knot to last all night, so he would not have to worry about it unravelling.
Harry liked to rim Draco until he would come almost untouched, rutting desperately on the sheets, or finger him while sucking him off. He would release the most delicious sounds. Draco’s breathy moans were so hot that when he would come, Harry would be so hard that his cock would hurt.
He had been so close to seeing Potter’s bits, so fucking close. The universe was messing with him. Salazar knew when another occasion like that would arise. Was he asking for too much? Just a quick look to satiate his curiosity. And a lick to satiate something else would have been great too. He looked back once again but this time his eyes met Potter’s. He snapped his head back, heart racing. Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit!
“Thank you. Thank you, so much. It’s the most beautiful surprise I ever received.” He whispered softly; voice thick with emotions. “I’m happy you like it. I was afraid it wouldn’t be enough.” He admitted shyly. Draco laughed, throwing his head back. Harry opened his eyes and saw the amusement on his face. “You have literally transformed my office a field of roses, Harry. It's incredible. You’re incredible, Harry Potter. I don’t know what I did to deserve you… I’m so thankful to have you. I love you." He melted at the sound of his voice, at the love dripping out of every word.
So, there he was, at the end of another day, unbuttoning his shirt in front of his locker, hoping to have another peek of Auror Hussain fat cock or Auror Dixon hard ass. Once he was fully naked and had his towel wrapped around him, he made his way to the showers. He walked nonchalantly, his pace slow and intentional, his eyes trained to locate a piece of naked skin even if he looked straight ahead. He managed to grasp small peeks of flesh there and there, but nothing was worthy of a second look.
He took a couple of slow and deep breaths, trying desperately to calm down and not let his anxiety ruin the moment. He needed to follow his heart and trust himself. He knew that Draco loved him and even if he was not ready to get married, all he had to do, was wait and ask him again in a couple of years. They would still be together, live in the same house and wake up in each other’s arms. Everything would have been all right.
“You’re insatiable.” Cried Harry, voice thick with lust. “Sue me.” He bit back, a teasing smile ghosting his lips. “You’re going to be the death of me, Malfoy. How many times I have to make you come until you’re satisfied? My dick will fall off.” “Now, we don’t want that, don’t we? Besides, I’m still too sore from yesterday, even my ass needs a little of rest if I want to be able to walk at all today.” Draco moaned softly as Harry sucked on his weak spot, right above the collarbone. “What do you have in mind?” “Put the pancakes under statis charm and then met me in the shower.” Harry smile was a mix of malice and tenderness that was simply fatal. “I love you.” Draco’s heart skipped a beat, the traditor, as if it was the first time, he had heard those words. But in his defense, Harry had a way to make him feel so special and loved, that it was simply a natural reaction. Nobody could be strong enough to remain impassible when those eyes looked at you the way they were looking at him. After all, he was just mortal.
So why was he all alone in their bed? Where was his good morning kiss? He sounded spoiled even in his own head, but it was his boyfriend fault for turning him into a sap.
.” His voice dropped low at the last few words, hoping he was being suggestive without looking too eager. It was a dangerous game because at every single interaction the two of them had, his hopes would lift a little bit higher. And the higher he was, the much it would have hurt when he fell. But who could have blamed him when Potter seemed to play along with him?
Longbottom stopped in his steps and put his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “Listen. It happened to all of us to make the same mistake. Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Dean, Seamus and myself. The only one who didn’t is Luna, who has the terrifying and marvellous ability to understand people with one look.”
He turned to the empty side of the mattress and rolled until he was face deep into Harry’s pillow. He took a deep breath, Harry’s scent hitting every fiber of his body, and huffed in annoyance. Time to wake up, find his boyfriend and demand some love.
Out of the shower and dried up, they made their way back to the bedroom, where Draco dressed up in his healer robes and Harry pretended to be busy doing the bed. Subtle. Really, like a dragon in the middle of London. He needed to calm his nerves.
“I love you.” He whispered helpless, too gone to understand what was leaking from his mouth. “I love you too… Even more if you resume the speed of a few moments ago.” Harry laughed amused. Bet on his needy bottom of a boyfriend to ruin the moment. “As you wish.” He speeded up once again, breathing heavily on Draco’s neck and kept the pace until the man under him started to mutter meaningless words. His clue that Draco was near to come. The perk of having a vocal partner during sex.
Harry had always been the brave one between the two of them. The one who spoke on his behalf at his trials, saving him from Azkaban. The one who started their first conversation after the war, returning his old wand on Harry’s first day at Hogwarts as a teacher. It was Harry who asked him out first. The one who leaned in to join their mouths in their first breath-taking kiss. The first to admit that he liked him. The first to ask to spend the night together. Only to sleep next to each other, so they could wake up in the same bed. Harry was the one who started their touches because Draco was too insecure. Too scared of being brave and reach for happiness.
Potter’s eyes were incredibly intense behind his golden frames, almost quivering with trepidation. He saw burning desire and want. So much want, he thought he was going to get eaten whole. But Potter was not the only one desperate for a bite, and since he was still alive, it was enough to think Potter did not actually dislike the attention. In for a penny…
Those eyes were shining with so much raw love that it made him breathless and dizzy. The emotions pouring thought them were so honest and vulnerable, that Draco knew that Harry felt the same. His love was so strong that his insecurities were washed away by a waterfall of Harry’s feelings.
And just like that, he left a speechless Gryffindor behind. He made his way through the crowd until he reached the entrance and then he started to run. He had no idea where he was going, he just knew he had to find Harry. With hair and cape flowing behind him, cold air hitting him in the face, he breathed a little prayer to Hogwarts. “Please… Lead me to him…”
With his blood flowing into his southern regions, his desire won over rationality. “What the hell?!” Screamed Draco, as he was being lifted bridal style. “We’re going home and you’re going to keep your word, Mr. Malfoy-Potter.” Draco eyes darkened with mirth and a drop of tenderness. “Mr. Malfoy-Potter… I do like the sound of it.” He mused happily, as he wrapped his arms around his neck. “Yeah? I can’t wait to hear you moan it into my ears.” Draco sighted, faking misery. “I’m going to marry a sex addict.” “You love it.” He said before kissing him deeply, tongues meeting hungrily. “Take me home, Mr. Malfoy-Potter. So, I can show you how much I love it.” Harry did just that and after, he could confidently say that Draco proved how much he like it, loud enough to be heard by the whole neighborhood. And since there were indeed stockings and a garter belt, he made sure to let Draco know how much he liked his gift too. Many and many times. Maybe too many, because they ended with not enough force to go out on the dinner Draco had also planned for them. So, they just stayed in, cooking a simple plate of pasta and drinking red wine, while wearing nothing more than comfy joggers and their engagement rings. They ate with their feet intertwined under the table, smitten smiles printed on their faces, soft music playing in the background and the roses all over their house. Yes, he could totally get used to a lifetime of that. Maybe with a kid or two running around too. But there was time for that. In the meantime, the just two of them was enough. No, one thousand and ninety-five times more than enough.
“Thanks, even if I don’t understand what’s so funny.” He shook his head. He knew he was sporting a besotted expression, but he could not help it. “Don’t mind me. I guess I’m just excited for today.” “Speaking of which, I’m afraid I should get up, if I want to make it to work. Not everybody can be Head Auror and decide when to take days off, can’t we?” Draco huffed unhappy. It was evident he was not thrilled to spend their special day at work and Harry almost felt sorry for his boyfriend. Almost, because it was all part of his surprise. Just the thought made his heart race.
“Listen Malfoy, it’s not my place to say it, but it’s obvious he loves you.” Draco froze in place and could taste his own heart on his tongue for a second. “What are talking about? How can you be so sure? Did he tell you?!”  He asked frenetically, on the verge of a meltdown. Longbottom gave him again that sly smile and he wanted to punch him right in the face. “No, he did not tell me anything, but there’s no need. He looks at you like you hung the sun, the moon and the whole night sky. He smiles like a fool when he’s with you and he never stop to talk about you when you’re not there.” He felt dizzy, his knees weak and the butterfly in his stomach going crazy. The corset might not have been a clever idea as he struggled to breath. He must have looked like a complete idiot, gaping like a fish out of water.
Draco did not know why he was wearing a costume, let alone what he was dressed as. All he cared about was that Harry was in front of him, looking extremely charming and dangerous in his attire.
As weeks went by, the quality of Draco’s technique had become inversely proportional to the level of his frustration. This meant, he started to bluntly stare at Potter, who caught him a few times, resulting in a confused frown between his brows. Draco always waved him off, trying to hide the blush he was sure dusted his face.
He lifted his eyes, meeting Harry’s gaze, so intense and lustful that his veins shivered with desire. Draco was fully hard by now. He could feel his cock pop up between the silk fabric of his nightgown, which was almost completely open, falling from one of his shoulders. He was conscious of how he must have looked and was proud of himself to be able to make Harry hot and bothered. One would have thought it was caused by the whole setting and situation, but Draco had seen that same look in those emerald eyes enough time to know it had mostly to do with him. He was the one to spark the desire in the heart of the so well-loved Golden Boy. One of his biggest achievement in life.
As he stepped out of the Floo, he drew a sigh of relief. He was finally home. “Kreacher?” At his calling, the old elf appeared with a loud pop in the living room. “Welcome home master. What can Kreacher do for Master?” Grumbled with his typical raucous tone the elf. “Did Harry leave for work already?” “Yes, Master did. He left said Master will not return before after lunch.” Answered the elf. It was barely seven in the morning, so the Aurors must have a big breakthrough in the case they were dealing with. He was too tired to recall any details, he just remembered that Harry had told him about illicit trafficking in potions or something, nothing more. “Can I take care of Master’s robes?” Asked Kreacher with his arm stretched out. He took off his healer robes and handed them to him. “Thank you, Kreacher. I’m going to take a bath and then sleep until lunchtime. Wake me up then.” “As Master wish.” After a quick bow, he disappeared with a snap of fingers.
The charm only helped a bit and, as he looked around, he noticed for the first time in a while, how impersonal and dark his chambers were. Not that it was his fault, he tried his best to furnish the place with new furniture, changing the carpets, curtains and paintings. At first, he had been rather proud of the results, but now, after spending most of his time in Harry’s rooms, the difference was painfully evident.
He opened one of the drawers of his vanity and took out the palette of eyeshadows and the brushes. He had never done makeup before, so he waved his wand and enchanted the brushes to do all the work. He closed his eyes and felt the pressure on his eyelids and under his eyes. When the charm ceased to work, he took a look at the outcome. The dark red smoky eye made his gaze even more intense and haunted. Perfect. He untied the towel on his head, his long hair falling on his back and his face. With another tired movement of his wand, he dried and combined his hair in a high ponytail, tied with a black velvet ribbon, and soft side-swept bangs, covering his forehead.
Once he was done, he advanced to the next step. As he applied the pre-shave oil, he stroked Harry’s cock with intent, trying to make him hard. “That feels good…” Said softly the man, head falling back and eyes shuttering close. “Yeah? Can you get hard me for me, love?” Harry chuckled low and dangerous, “Oh, love, I’m always hard for you. By now you should know that.” The timbre of his voice was enough to stir arousal inside his groin, warm and tender. The want of his boyfriend never failed to melt him down. He was helpless when it came to Harry. Just working him to complete hardness, feeling his weight in his hands, was enough to make his own cock twitch with interest, blood slowly flooding between his legs.
Was it… Was it possible that he had never seen Potter’s dick? How did he manage to miss something like that?! He reviewed every Auror cock that he had filed away in his brain, which he was not ashamed to admit was a lot, but they never belonged to Potter. For crying out loud, he had even seen Weasley’s freckled cock! And yes, the curtains matched the drapes, but that was not the point!
He closed his mouth around the head and Potter moaned in relief. He swallowed what he could, not much as it had been a while since the last time he had blown a prick that big. By a rough estimation, he guessed Potter was eight and a half inches long, and thick. So fucking thick he had to stretch his mouth as wide as he could. A first-rate piece of meat, the finest in the whole Auror Department for sure.
He put on the dark green silk socks and then proceeded to put on the three-piece suit. Made of light wool, it was dark forest green and Pansy picked it for him because, and he quoted: “It’s the perfect shade for your light dark skin-tone and it brings out your eyes. Draco won’t be able to stop drooling when he sees you.” Every piece of the suit was a work of impeccable tailoring: the trousers were pleaded and wrapped round his ass in a way he almost found indecent but was sure would have been appreciated by Draco. The three-button vest had lapels and hugged tightly his waist, so his shoulder looked even broader than usual. The two buttons jacket fitted perfectly, not too tight to result uncomfortable, but enough to showcase his frame.
They both went limp, tired by their performance and dazed by their orgasms. They were sweaty and sticky, but Draco did not care. He nuzzled Harry’s neck and kissed him there, as a hand came to stroke his back with soothing touches. Even if they took their sweet time, they still were panting, so they stood in silence for a couple of minutes, catching their breaths and cuddling.
Draco’s locker was on the other side of the room, almost in front of Potter’s. He opened it and did everything as slowly as possible, buying some time. Looking over his shoulder, he almost choked on his tongue and his eyes were so wide they were about to fall from his skull. Potter was naked, his hairy ass in full display, so muscled and tight he could have flipped a coin on it. Now that he had a full view of his legs, Draco’s wish to die smashed by those tights was more vivid than ever.
Draco checked once again the time, smokies numbers materializing in thin air. It was almost time to head out. He closed all the curtains and put some other firewood into the fireplace. He went out of his bedroom and into his office, where the fire had died down. As he looked over at his desk, he saw a small paper bag on the edge and remembered his previous purchase. It was a product of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, part of the new Halloween collection. They were called “Sweet Fangs” and they, essentially, were mints that made you grew a pair of vampire fangs for a couple of hours. They were contained in a metal box, printed on the top a vampire's mouth and the product’s name in dripping letters. He ate one and, after a minute or two, he felt his canines growing, transforming themselves in fangs. It was not painful; he just felt a tingling feeling in his mouth. With his tongue, he caressed the difference, noting with surprise and relief that they were not particularly sharp, but rather blunted. There was no danger of accidentally injuring himself. Thank Merlin.
He backed up enough to breathe normally again and then dived back in, obtaining another sinful groan from Potter. Draco kept doing that, not caring about the saliva running down his chin or the tears wetting his cheeks. He was face fucking himself on the huge shaft and he had to admire Potter’s auto control, but at the same time, he cursed it. He wanted him to lose control, to pleasure fills his head until his body would pursue his orgasm with no hesitation. Apparently, the Golden Boy needed a little incentive.
The smile that Potter was sporting morphed into a grin and his eyes twinkled with amusement. He would have dropped his pants if he had them on.
The hot water was an elixir for his sore muscles and the salts bath helped to melt the tension in his shoulders and back. He immersed himself till his chin touched the foam, which tickled his skin. The only things that moment missed, were a glass of wine and his fiancé. He lifted his left hand out of the water and blew the bubbles that covered his ring. The rubies looked like drops of blood in the snow, or like drops of passion in a sea of purity if he wanted to use Harry’s word. The corners of his mouth curved into a smile, the event of the day when Harry proposed to him still fresh into his mind even after a couple of months. It had been the first time he had cried tears of happiness.
Draco tried his hardest to hold back the tears, but a traitorous one escaped, nevertheless. “It’d be my pleasure.” He answered lifting his head and giving him a kind smile. Harry kissed him kindly and slowly. “Thank you. It means a lot.” He kissed him soft and tender, and the simple gest opened the gates of his eyes. Silent tears fell down his cheeks, surely smearing his makeup. Not that Draco cared. He was once again in Harry’s arms. He loved him back and wanted to meet his parents. Draco was overwhelmed with emotions.
Harry whispered the last words on his lips, before kissing him gently, the grip of his arm becoming tighter, pressing their bodies together, making a little pleased sound escape from Draco. They kissed languidly for what felt like hours but were probably few minutes. Once again, Draco took notice of how easy was for him to utterly lose himself when he was with Harry and by the way he was being kissed, the feeling was mutual.
“It’s also the second biggest part of you.” He almost snorted. Bet on his boyfriend to make a dirty joke about his big ass heart.  Merlin, he really loved him.
But while he had never been happier in his life, not the same could have been saying about the public. Which did not come as a surprise, after all, an ex-Death Eater was going to marry the Saviour of the Wizarding World, as they liked to call the two of them. It did not matter how many lives he saved daily from curses and other spells; people still painted him as the evil Slytherin who had bamboozled their beloved saviour. After teen years since the war, it surely lacked originality. They could at least try to change it up a little bit, but he was not sure if they owned the brain cells for such a task. Idiots.
Draco opened the door and his mouth fell open. “Merlin’s beard…” He gasped with wide eyes, shock evident on his face, as he brought a hand to his chest. “Surprise.” Harry smiled, but he knew it was tense and not as big and carefree as his usual. He could hear the hammering of his heart in his brain, which was very distracting.
“What did you mean early?!” His question made Longbottom jump on his feet. “Merlin tits, Malfoy! Don’t sneak behind my back like that ever again! I almost had a heart attack.” He rolled his eyes. “Focus! What did you mean when you said my circumstances are special?” And for good measure, he shook the man by his shoulder.
Harry walked to him, sliding an arm around his waist and a hand on his arm. Draco automatically put his free arm around his neck and so they started to swing together, Harry still singing along, his voice deep and incredibly soft, making Draco’s chest swell with warmth.
They kissed for what Draco guessed were long minutes. None of them tried to get some kind of friction or contact over their hardness. They just kissed. Long and deep. Like the word had stopped just for them, so they could enjoy every little movement of their mouths and tongues. Harry still tasted of the hot chocolate he had drunk earlier. It was sweet and decadent. His lips were a little bit chapped, but he loved the rough sensation on his skin. It helped to make everything feel more real, not only a dream in Draco’s mind.
While Draco did not say those three words out loud daily, he would still say it when it really mattered. When Harry needed comfort after a long and tiring day at work, where he did not manage to protect someone. When he missed his parents, even after all those years. When Harry cooked for him and took care of the house. Every single time they made slow and tender sex. He would proclaim those words as the most important law in the world. And in their world, they were.
Still in only a pair of black boxers, he began to dress himself, starting with the elegant white and dark green striped button-down shirt. He had been hesitant at first, when Pansy had showed him the piece of clothing, feeling it was a little bit out of his comfort zone. But she had assured him that it would have been the perfect choice for the look she had in mind and all he had to do was trust her. And so, he did.
The fire crackled in the fireplace, heating his private rooms, but not nearly enough to what he got used to. He cast a weak heating charm with his wand, always with him, even when he was sleeping. A habit he had acquired in the delightful time when the Manor had become the base of Death Eaters and the Dark Lord. Only a fool would have walked those corridors full of dark corners and hiding places unarmed.
Having Harry in his hands was always arousing. Draco loved the way he could get out of Harry little moans or deep guttural sounds. The way his lips would be slightly parted away and how he would throw back his head lost in the feeling. If giving Harry pleasure could have been a job, Draco would have happily committed to it.
If they had asked Draco which one, he preferred between shaving Harry and bickering with him, he would probably have chosen the second. He would ended up being fucked in both, but the bickering was just a little more fun. His favourite ritual.
He took off his clothes, putting them in the laundry hamper, wand in hand. As he approached the tub, he noted that Kreacher had been so quick that the white clawfoot tub was already filled with hot water and foam. From the scent, he could tell that the elf had used Harry’s favourite bath salts, cinnamon and orange blossoms. He was more of a vanilla or lavender type of guy, but he knew how much Harry loved when he smelled like autumn. He would nuzzle into his neck at any given time, so he could smell him and leave little kisses over his skin. It never failed to make his heartache with adoration.
He knotted the ochre silk tie, paired with the pocket handkerchief, and ended his look with the brown oxford shoes that matched his leather belt. He stood up from the leather puff, positioned in the center of the walk-in closet, that separated his side from Draco’s, and looked at himself in the full-length mirror on the wall.
With strength coming from his hard Auror training, Harry stood up, holding Draco with strong hands under his thighs, still half-hard and balls deep inside him. He made his way to the shower, where he took care of him this time. Cleaning him from every single drop of come he had all over and inside him. Another little ritual of them, after he took care of Harry, they would reverse roles, letting Harry care for him instead. It never failed to melt his heart, the way Harry was so gentle and sweet, plastering little kisses on his face and shoulder as he washed him. The way he would prepare the bath just how he liked it, scorching hot water, lavender bath salts and a lot of bubbles.
The steam of the hot water fogged the mirror and the green tiles of the walls. Harry sounded cheerful, humming in the shower, as he took out from the cabinet under the sink all they needed. Their first time came to his mind. Between arousing and excitement, he had almost come untouched and Harry had been not far from it once he was done. And while the initial thrill was now just a reminiscence of discovering something new, he was still feeling enthusiastic.
“Malfoy…” Potter’s inquisitory voice filled the almost empty room, breaking the silence and making Draco break out in a cold sweat. “Yes?” He answered back without turning to face the man. Like the true coward he was. “I’ve been meant to tell you, you’re not as subtle as you think you are.” That’s it. He was done. Potter was going to kill him, get rid of his body and make sure nobody remembered his existence. A little bit dramatic and excessive in Draco’s opinion. All he wanted to do was see his dick. Not surely a crime that deserved death, right?
He felt Harry’s short beard stroking his sensible skin, the man sucked and nibbled on his pulse point and it was almost too much. His hands tightened their holds in Harry’s hair, whose reaction was a deep and hot whimper.
“Can I ask you something?” Asked Draco after a while. “It’s the less I can do after that mind-blowing orgasm.” He answered easily, a relaxed smile stretching his lips. “Why do you take such care at hiding that monster of a cock?” Potter seemed surprised by his question, a light blush spreading across his cheeks. “I just wanted to avoid unsolicited attention. While I respect our colleagues, I’m still Harry Potter, and people seem to love talking about me. I’m afraid if the words go around that I’m… big-“ “More like huge.” Interrupted Draco, making the other smile shyly. “All right, huge, I will lose the little of privacy I have. I know it sounds egocentric and self-centred, I’m sorry.” Without really thinking about it, Draco took Potter’s hand and held it with reassurance. “Maybe a little bit, but I wouldn’t say it’s totally out of reality… I guess I’m sorry I tried to violate your privacy.” It was a little lame as an apology, but it was the best he could do on the spot. Nonetheless, it earned him another of Potter’s sweet smiles, that quickly turned wicked. “Well, let’s just say if I knew you were gagging for my cock, I would have dropped my towel way sooner.” “Next time I’ll be less subtle about it. So we can get straight to the action.” He winked at the man, whose soft cackles made his body tremble.
“That was for this morning…” Then he leaned in and kissed him with passion and desire, letting him know that his performance had not left him indifferent for several reasons. Harry groaned against his lips, his impressive erection already pressing thought the thin cotton of his boxer and the apron.
Potter’s cock slipped out of his lips, and he could not help but cough a little, his throat burning and sticky from the perfect abuse. “Are you ok? Was I too rough?” Breathed Potter, sitting on the floor, leaning against the bench, one leg bent to support his arm. Not sure he had enough breath to speak just yet, Draco took a moment to appreciate the state of the man in front of him: body glistening with sweat, his face glowing in the afterglow of his orgasm, cock softening between his legs. but still thick, tip filth with cum. Simply divine.
Draco cast a Tempus charm. He had forty-five minutes to get ready before the beginning of the ball. Even if Harry had disappeared, he had still made a commitment and he would have carried it out. Gathering the little inner strength left, he turned on the wireless, the silence of the room weighing on him like a stone.
“And which one am I?” Asked the man arching an amused hairbow. Draco flashed his best grin. “Take a guess, Saint Potter.” Potter made a sour face. “I don’t like that nickname.” “Why not?” Potter shrugged, running again a hand in his hair. It was one of the sexiest things Draco had ever seen. “It depicts me like I’ve got no flaws, which is dehumanizing. Just like anybody else, I’m not perfect. I just try to do what I think is right. Nothing more.” As usual, Potter managed to blow him away. “From your modesty, you wouldn’t think so.” He whispered. The other opened his mouth to say something but was interrupted by Weasley’s voice coming from the lockers room. “Harry, are you coming?! Hermione is waiting for us!” “Coming!”
Harry took several seconds to catch his breath and so did Draco, since all he could hear were their tired and heavy breaths. When he felt he had enough strength to move, he shifted so his body was not pressing down on his lover’s. He must have done a really good job to not receive a single complain from the blond, who usually told him to get off him because he was too heavy. Or maybe it was because it was their special day, but he had a feeling it was cause of both.
“Did you really need to make me cry and ruin my makeup?” Harry dried a tear with his thump. “Sorry, love. I did not mean to. Not when you look so gorgeous. You’re the most beautiful vampire I had ever seen.” Draco rolled his eyes, but he was smiling. “Seen a lot of vampires, haven’t you?” He asked teasingly. “Of course, I have. I’m dressed as a vampire hunter, after all.” Draco frowned confused. “That’s what you are? And where the hell did you found the costume?”
“Potter, sit on the bench and shut up, will you?” The man cackled, even if Draco did not understand what was funny, but did as he was told. As he kneeled, he used Potter’s strong legs as support, made of solid muscles that still burned from the physical strain of the evaluation. While he expected his knees to touch the cold and hard floor, he was surprised to find a soft towel, the same that covered Potter’s body just a few moments before, to make it more comfortable. No words, no wand. Only power and kindness, Potter’s second nature.
Maybe he followed his rules better than he thought, which he should have been happy about, but really was not. Trying to find a rational answer to the big, (or small, who knew?) mystery hiding beneath Potter’s towel, he concluded that there had simply never been a suitable opportunity. It had always been busy in the locker room since they were trainers and while his little hobby did start at the time, he had also been busy restoring his family name. That explanation pleased his mind. He had just to be more observant and catch the man while he was changing. Yes, it was perverted. Did he care? Not really. Again, he had never been a saint after all. Besides, a little bit of curiosity never killed anybody, right?
“What are you talking about, Potter?” Sounding bored and more confident than he felt was a small victory. He just had to deny everything. He was good at making other people believe his own reality.
“I… I didn’t notice…” His shuttering was interrupted by Longbottom’s soft chuckles. “Of course, you didn’t! Your dump ass was busy doing the same thing. Lovesick puppies, the both of you.”
“And also modest! You’re really the whole package, aren’t you, Malfoy?” “Modesty is for saints and losers. I’m am neither of those, unlike you.” His eyes followed a drop of water running down Potter’s body and he had to physically stop himself from licking it away. Never in his life would he have thought he would be jealous of a drop of water. He chastised himself for his weakness, returning to meet Potter's gaze.
Draco savoured every second, every spark of pleasure provided by Harry’s cock rubbing against his bundle of nerves. Their speed gave him the chance to enjoy the burning feeling of his orgasm building in his groin, slowly increasing to the point of no return.
He found Harry in the back of Grimmauld Place, already on the bike, looking particularly appetising, in his simple blue-washed jeans, leather boots, a thick green turtleneck, that he had bought him two Christmas ago. It was almost the same colour as his eyes. Almost, because Draco believed that Harry’s eyes colour was impossible to reproduce. It was too vibrant, to alive, to simply recreate on an object. Sirius’s old leather jacket was still going strong and looked perfect on Harry’s wide and toned shoulders.
After a while, it was Harry time to ruin the moment. “Draco, do you mind if we get up off the floor? It's starting to get uncomfortable.” He asked bashfully, with a goofy smile plastered on his face, too conscious of what a mood breaker it was. “Yes, yes, sorry.” He said, helping him to stand once again. He did not sound sorry even a bit, but he could not blame him as he himself was struggling to believe it was really happening. He was going to marry Draco. They would have been husbands.
“But you do slimy dealers?” He teased. “What can I say, I love charity work. Besides, if I was to catch only hot men, I will be unemployed.” Potter softly laughed at his words and it made his heart swell with pride and joy.
Walking out of the bathroom, a cloud of steam following his steps, wrapped in a soft emerald bathrobe and a towel around his head, Draco was still feeling on the verge of tears. He sat at his vanity and looked in the mirror, his skin was flushed red from the long hot bath he had just took, and his eyes were tired and glassy from the tears that had joined the water in the tub. He looked dreadful and felt as much.
As he started to keep an eye, sometimes both, on Potter, he started to think that the fact he had never seen Potter’s cock might not be a fortuity. It took him four meetings in the locker room to see some patterns, or habits, from the man. While, technically, it was bad etiquette to spend unnecessary time without clothes on, Potter had always a piece of fabric on. He would get down to his underwear and then wrap a towel around him, and only after removing the last piece of clothing. When he emerged from the shower, he had already the towel around himself and then he would wear the clean pair of underwear before removing the towel. Potter seemed to deeply care about his privacy, which made Draco’s job much harder, if not impossible.
Draco kissed him tenderly, just an innocent peck on the lips and then whispered in his ear. His voice needy and thick with desire. “Please, Harry, fuck me.” And just like that, Harry’s last string of control snapped.
He did not expect to find another person at the lockers, less of all, a shirtless Potter. Draco pondered his choices: backing off and watch from around the corner, like a creep, the man getting naked, or making his presence known. But before he could choose, Potter seemed to sense Draco’s presence and turned to look at him.
Blood boiled in his veins and his heart drummed frenetically, echoing in his ears and almost covering Potter’s voice. His orgasm started to build deep down his stomach, a hot spark ready to explode. At some point, Potter’s moves became frantic and a little broken.
He went back to his bed and retrieved the pair of black velvet opera gloves that he wore over his shirt. There was no denying that he looked good. It was polished and sexy, his legs seemed endless thanks to the boots, his waist was snatched, his pale neck and collarbones tempting. The only colour in the whole outfit was the deep emerald green of the silk lining of the cape, providing an elegant combination with the black.
“Maybe,” The man chuckled, pressing a soft peck on his lips. “But it’s because I feel we didn’t have enough time for each other in the past weeks.” At Harry words, he felt his heart grow lighter. “I was afraid I was the only one feeling that way.” He admitted softly while stroking the nape of Harry’s neck. Eyes locked together. “No, definitely, not. I missed you. Even if we live in the same house and sleep in the same bed, it seemed we did not have the time to enjoy each other company.” Harry mirrored his movement, eyes going tender with love. “I missed you too. Why don’t we do something this afternoon? Just the two of us.” “Are you asking me out, Malfoy?” Asked teasingly Harry, to which he could not help but smile. “Yes, I am, you dork. Are you free?” “For a date with my future husband? Always.” The world “husband” made Draco’s heart flutter. Merlin, he really could not wait to marry the man.
As they broke off, Draco met Harry’s emerald eyes, so vibrant with adoration that he felt breathless and dizzy. “I’m sorry.” Said out of the blue Harry. “For what?” He asked a little bit confused, but still lost in green fields. “I ruined a perfect opportunity to have a beautiful night together…” Draco shook his head. He cupped the man face with a hand, stroking his bearded cheek. “Don’t feel sorry. Never feel sorry about your feelings, especially grief. Even without our fight, it wouldn’t be right going to the ball… it’s not what you needed, or need…” “But what about you?” Harry covered Draco’s hand with his bigger one. Warm and kind. The question melted Draco’s core. He loved him so much. “I just wanted to dance with you… be with you. Nothing more.” His lover nuzzled his palm, pressing a kiss, and his heart skipped a beat. “Thank you… thank you for loving me, I love you so much.”
Draco tried not to let his anxiety show—he continued to shower Harry with his affection as usual, whether it was buying every ridiculous trinket that made Draco think of him, or Harry's favorite treats, or offering Harry one of his signature massages after a long day. If Harry noticed any change in his demeanor, he didn't say anything.
level of disagreement between them if they were to keep their relationship a secret. It wasn't that difficult, anyway—the banter came naturally to them, and Harry was actually starting to find it enjoyable. Not that he let anyone know that, of course.

he groaned, staring at the blood that covered both of him. After several Scouring charms, Draco managed to stand, though he was heavily supported by Harry.
she said carefully, “so I don’t necessarily expect that you care deeply for my son. However, he isn’t one to trust easily—if he opens up to you, don’t take it lightly.”
“Oh, come here,” Harry gave him a watery smile and set the ring down to pull him into a hug, stroking Draco’s hair when he started to cry. Harry hoped at least
Draco frowned at him for a moment, as if finally remembering how different their childhoods were. He tentatively placed his hand on Harry’s knee. "I guess we'll just have to make up for it together," he said finally, taking a sip of his tea, before placing it on a saucer that wouldn’t look out of place with someone’s
"That I'm in love with you," Harry answered, more confidently this time. His fingers tightened around Draco's wrist, pulling him closer.
"Well—yeah" Harry scratched the back of his neck., before turning to Draco. "Hey," he lowered his voice, "
After marveling about it to all of the party guests, she had turned to Draco— “Did you know he was this talented?”
on magic. So if anyone’s finding that their magic is weaker than normal, or that spells aren’t working very well for you… then you may have it.”
Draco nodded, resting his head on Harry's shoulder. "At least it'll be easier from now on," he mumbled into Harry's cloak.
crying. Nowadays, nightmares were always followed by tears, and all it did was remind Harry of the nights spent in the cupboard, muffling his tears so as to not wake his relatives.
Harry pulled away from Draco for a moment, a dazed expression across his face. He gave Draco a questioning look—which Draco answered with a small smile—and nodded at the Ravenclaw. “Yeah,” he said simply, before reconnecting their lips.
It wasn't long before Harry noticed that something was off. It was if Draco had lost his footing, like something was throwing him off. His movements were more rigid and he started and stopped abruptly instead of weaving through the players. It didn't look like his broom was tampered with, thankfully. Harry studied the field. His eyes followed the quaffle as Ravenclaw scored their next goal, bringing the score to a tie. That was it—why was the quaffle staying so close to Draco? Usually the seeker stayed far away from most of the gameplay to allow them to keep an eye out for the snitch, but this time, the Ravenclaw chasers seemed to be following him—trying to surround him so that he wouldn't be able to spot the snitch.
but laugh. Here he was, thinking that Draco was about to break up with him—but he couldn’t have been more wrong.
Draco's footsteps fell silently as he approached and knelt at his side, tucking his feet under him. "Potter—" his voice cracked, and he let loose a breathy laugh. "I'm talking to a corpse." He sighed. "
The loud chirping of the birds is what pulled Draco from his blissful sleep the next morning. Grumbling under his breath, he wrapped his arms tighter around himself and shifted his head, pressing his face into his pillow in an attempt to muffle the sounds.
Draco shook his head. "Yeah, but you look exhausted." He pulled Harry close and pressed a kiss to his temple. "Go shower and get dressed for bed."
Draco relaxed as the conversation shifted, until he realized that they’d have to continue this discussion later, in their room,
Draco squirmed in Harry’s embrace, but once it was clear that he was already fast asleep, Draco gave up.
"Don't worry, you'll do great," Harry gave Draco a quick hug when they'd reached the Quidditch changing rooms. "Hey, are you coming to the common room after dinner? I finished
that means they saw how much Malfoy would follow Harry around.” He smirked at Draco, who slowly turned red.
Only one more update after this!! I hope you liked this one :D (ps: i've also been posting this on my instagram, @etymolo.drarry!)
Blessedly, his silencing charms had yet to fail thus far. Sometimes, during particularly bad nightmares, Harry’s magic would disrupt the charm and cause it to fail. He learned this the hard way, when Ron woke him in the middle of the night after hearing his screams.
“Carrots? I’ll wait for hours if I get all the carrots I can eat.”  The gnome hopped up and down flapping his wings.
“But – the ‘Potter stinks’ badges? And the remarks about my ugly hair?” Potter looked so vulnerable; Draco had never seen him this vulnerable before.
“I will,” Draco said firmly. He remembered dreaming of becoming an Unspeakable as a kid. And he knew how important it was. A ring of magic from Harry’s wand wrapped itself around his wrist.
Maybe Mr. Malfoy had inadvertently just given her the solution to the problem of her parents’ constant nagging, although, she was sure the old codger was also just seeing her as a possible bride. Ewww.
Draco had caught a glimpse of Harry’s room when Harry had sought out a set of pyjamas for him. It had Muggle pictures of motorcycles with women in bikinis on the walls, and the four-poster was wide enough to be suitable for a couple. Beside the bed, there was a picture of two men, with a frame of elaborately painted green carnations. It seemed that the women on the posters probably were just a distraction for the room’s original owner’s family, while in reality, he was in a relationship with the other man on the picture.
The hard stuff was always the most expensive, chocolatiest snack Greg and Pansy sold at the café they owned. Draco could never have afforded it, as Parks and Greg was one of the most expensive and fashionable cafés in Muggle London. Nobody except for Greg’s wife Keiko, a Muggle clarinet player, knew that the bakery was wizarding behind the scenes.
Draco had always thought he had taken advantage of Potter. He had felt so ashamed that at the trial he barely had the courage to nod at Potter, but Potter had also only nodded at him. To Draco’s relief, Potter still spoke in his defense. And it had made the difference. The accusation had pleaded for Azkaban. House arrest for a year followed by a long probation period was clearly better, even if the probation was as long as Draco’s.
The voice in his head still sang the same song. Draco wondered if Can’t Get You Out of My Head was caught in the man’s mind. The song was definitely catchy.
Draco didn’t know who had started seeking friction, before he knew it, they were rutting against each other, groaning into each other’s mouths, then finally, they both came almost at the same time.
The curse had been cast by Bellatrix, cunning bitch. It was a withering curse. If Draco turned his back on Voldemort, Lucius would slowly and painfully wither away. The day Draco had not identified Potter, a time bomb in Lucius’ body had started ticking. It had started with his toenails crumbling over their whole length and his pancreas malfunctioning, and by now meant the whole of his magic, along with a vast potions regimen, was necessary to ensure his body wouldn’t just disintegrate suddenly. It could only have been stopped by Draco doing his part to facilitate the Dark Lord’s victory. But the Dark Lord was dead, and so was Bellatrix.
“Something with stars if his human name is a constellation,” another girl interjected. “Maybe Astrios.”
Draco felt Harry wanking and fingering himself harder and harder now. He himself gasped and writhed, and his breath was probably in sync with Harry’s.
Harry’s arm was close to Draco’s face, and Draco took in Harry’s heady, intoxicating scent. He had never felt so happy. He leaned slightly forward and kissed Harry’s arm where he could reach him. Harry woke up slowly and whispered into Draco’s ear: “Good morning, beautiful.”
“Yes, we’re in Grimmauld Place. I inherited it from my godfather Sirius.” The sadness in Potter’s face made Draco wish he could wrap the man in his arms.
“So, what could be your name? Luna said you never accepted any of the names the Quibbler employees would give you. You seem quite posh with your blond hair and your attitude. I think I’ll call you Meowfoy. Because you remind me of a very posh, very attractive-looking classmate from my school days. I hope you’re not such a git as he always was.”
“Harry, I discussed it with Hermione. She also thinks it’s worth trying, and that the risk isn’t that big.” Pansy added. “She wanted to be here, too.”
Salazar’s saggy balls! He should have been at Pansy’s an hour ago! “Sorry, Pans, I was kind of preoccupied with some... weird things that happened yesterday.”
“Cousin Draco!” Draco turned to the direction the voice came from. It was a double portrait of Professor Lupin and Sirius Black.
“He sometimes tries to play the big bad prat, but in reality, he’s changed for the better, he’s left his prejudices behind, and now he is almost as fascinated by Muggle things as Arthur, but more competent at using them. Just the delusions about rubber ducks seem to be a universal thing. He actually told me my decorative rubber duck in the bathroom was not functioning and that it was supposed to be a sex toy.” Harry remembered with a chuckle of Draco’s bout of shock about the open display of a rubber duck on the downstairs bathroom shelf and the annoyance at it not even vibrating. They had talked about it only yesterday, but Draco had told him that it had exasperated him since the first playdate.
A moving picture showed Meowfoy lying on a sunny spot on the ground with a black cat. The golden sunlight cast intricate patterns across them as they were licking each other’s fur.
Dempy pressed the bowl with the Floo powder into his hand and gently nudged him towards the direction. Finally, he flooed over to Grimmauld Place.
“He may insult you to your face, but when he talks to me,” Andromeda said in a pensive tone, “he talks about you only with words of praise. If you ask me he likes you alright, whether platonically or…”
Whitley and Dawlish. They were high-ranked Aurors, very pompous, and they both tended to leave their table especially dirty whenever they ate in the part of the cafeteria where Draco cleaned.
How are you, darling? I haven’t heard from you for a while now? And I worry about you, it’s not good to be all alone.
“I just called the grapes I couldn’t reach sour because you rejected me in first year.” Draco felt his hand begin to tremble. “Looking back, you could not have befriended me, not with the things I said about Hagrid and Weasley.”
Please, make sure to be available for our team during that time. An arrangement for working times will be made directly with your employer.
When people’s attention was on the waiters with the Prosecco bottles, he approached Draco and Harry. “You have a window of three minutes to Apparate home before their attention will be back on you,” he whispered, then winked. “The wards allow you to Disapparate from the stage. Have a good weekend in bed.”
“Mad Eye Moody showed me the nose in the DMLE evidence room when I was in Auror training. He splinched it off close to the beginning of the first war, and there was evidence that he was drunk as a skunk.” Sirius gestured vividly.
“I promise that if they insult you in my house, I will tell them to leave and come back only when they have learned to respect my flatmate. And anyway, how long ago was the last time you’ve had contact with anybody from the Weasley family?”
Then past a few shops to a side street that used to be nameless, run down and with only derelict stores and ruins above them before the war. Now a cheerful sign declared it Theatric Alley. Lucius suppressed a sneer about the frivolity, as they passed by a children’s theatre,
“That gallus bastard did what?” That voice and that Scottish brogue was doubtlessly Headmistress McGonagall, but she normally didn’t shout like that or use such pedestrian language.
After setting it up, Karamo put a box with the word Lego on it on the table. “These are Legos, a Muggle toy. You can build things with them.” He demonstrated stacking a few Legos on top of each other. “I thought, I’ll show you something with Legos and the scale. Please, put some Legos on one scale to symbolize your guilt from the war.”
Second birthdays were no unusual thing in their friend group. Luna celebrated the day the war was over, Neville the day he got his own wand (in contrast to his father’s wand his grandmother had made him start off with), Harry the day he had stood up to everyone and quit Auror training.
Antoni carried two cakes and Earl Grey tea to the sofa table one after the other. “We got two cakes from our two heroes’ families: A treacle tart from the Weasleys, and a tarte Tatin from Narcissa.”
“Even if it had taken my magic permanently, I’d regret nothing. In these last two months, since our cats have started demanding playdates, we have become friends, I think. At least I have come  to enjoy having meals with him and watching tv together.” Draco felt surprised to hear such words from Potter, because  he had actually also enjoyed being at Grimmauld Place with Potter, and not only because it wasn’t the Manor. But it couldn’t be that it meant the same to Potter as it meant to him; Potter was the hero who could have anyone he wanted. Why would he choose a man who had the Dark Mark and was in general a curmudgeon if he could have someone like Corey Newton from Pudd U or Neville Longbottom, who was a hero too, and openly pansexual, or maybe Terry Boot, who had become a famous actor? They were on the list of sexiest wizards alive. Although for Draco that list held only one name: Harry James Potter.
“Would you rather eat something mild or something spicier?” Harry asked softly. “I’ve eaten here before. I could give you advice about it.”
“Potter,” Draco said, “this cheap wool you want to buy will only make you feel and look as if you had the hippogriff pox. And it would look better on a fucking scarecrow than on you. The colour is like that of support stockings. I presume you have the Potter vault and the Black vault. And you earn money every time you refurnish someone’s house. Why again do you think you can’t afford to buy dressrobes that look good and are comfortable?”
When Draco had calmed down a bit, Karamo continued speaking: “Let’s look at the present again. What have you been working on recently?”
While the act itself had been good, it had scared him off pulling Muggles and convinced him that he was doomed to never have a significant other. A cat would at least be someone with a pulse and a less subservient attitude than Kreacher’s to live in his house. If he was lucky, the cat might even enjoy cuddling.
I just couldnt resist giving the second chapter a LOTR title, sorry, but I guess that's an occupational hazard of writing about cursed signet rings.
“Yes,” Lucius said, hiding his shock about Draco making a spectacle of himself. A Pureblood having a show. That was a disgrace. All the Malfoy ancestors would be turning over in their graves at the mere mention of such a thing.
Draco had casually inferred two months ago that they would like to get engaged to Harry. They had also mentioned wanting the proposal to be done publicly if and when Harry was ready for it. Harry had been ready for the engagement back then, but had wanted to find the perfect ring. To do everything perfectly. There had never been a question over whether he wanted to be married to Draco. Not once since he had first seen them again. Harry had been drawn to them. Their spellbinding stage presence in drag; their love and understanding of Muggle culture; and the sexy, intelligent and amazingly soft person they had proven themself to be.
“Your mother and Luna love you the way a mother and a close friend love someone. And Luna wants you to go on the date with Prongs because she thinks he might love you in a different way. I’ve brought you something to look at.” Karamo lifted a tool case onto the garden table. He got up, opened it and brought out a balance scale.
“And then, suddenly he was brought into my home as a captive, and I was asked if I recognized him. I knew him, even though his face was distorted, I could never have not recognized him. His magic and his scent are unmistakable. But I told my aunt I can’t be sure it’s him. He grabbed my wand, and my hand let go of it after only a mock fight. And later, he saved my life. Of course, he was far out of my league, and after the war we saw each other twice. Once at the trial, and once when he gave me my wand back. I have no idea what my pen friend looks like, but he is the only one for whom I have a similar feeling when I get his letters. But - how can I? I have this.” He pointed at his Dark Mark.
Draco stood outside the Manor’s chapel and braced himself for another seven years of having to be untrue to himself. But the compulsion of the ring was keeping him in place. He tried his best to wear his Malfoy Mask, repeating in his mind
when he asked his questions—he wasn’t looking to Harry for answers. He wasn’t necessarily indignant, like the others—no, he was
"You made a mistake, Tom," Harry stood behind Voldemort, and a murmur went through the crowd as both sides realized who was speaking.
“Good evening, Mr. Potter,” the figure used their wand to illuminate the room, and Harry had to squint at the bright light.
thought you were going to break up with me,” he confessed after a moment, hearing his sobs come back full-force.
"Ron and Hermione always deflect those questions for me," Harry smiled ruefully, "they know I have nightmares and don't like talking about them."
Harry said. “Besides, why would I have spent the last two weeks sneaking into your bedroom at night if I didn’t care?”
“Its…it’s not that,” Harry admitted, and both Sirius and Remus pulled away to look at him. “I’m seeing someone,” he swallowed hard. “And I don’t know if you’ll accept them.”
Draco grumbled under his breath, but he froze when he felt Harry remove the pillow from between them and toss it above their heads.
"Nothing, go back to sleep," Harry whispered, carefully sliding the window open to untie the note from the owl's leg.
once Draco had left the room. He felt a weight pull on his mind as he slowly changed into his pajamas, unable to shake the guilt that was worsening by the minute. He'd
“The good news is,” Madam Pomfrey added cheerfully, “is that it seems like your original Vervé Elixir wasn’t very potent to begin with. Thus, the connection between your cores should only last three days or so. Of course, the favorable outcome would be if you hadn’t brewed your potion correctly at all, but we can’t change the past.”
” His face took on a pained expression. “But… listen. I know you’re good at hiding your emotions and all… but that only works when you’re

to cheer him up, but none of it was working because Harry didn't have the guts to express what was really bothering him in the first place.
He wasn't even insulting me, but anger was starting to crawl its way up my chest. I focused on my breathing, counting backwards to try and calm down.
we can do whatever the hell we want!” After all, that’s what he’d told Ginny when she’d confided in him about her feelings for Luna—and he’d be a hypocrite if he didn’t take his own advice.
She nodded. “Exactly. The excess of snail slime created a very potent version of the potion, actually. The Connectivity Draught is normally used when a wizard has, for whatever reason, lost their connection to their magical core. As a result, your altered potion has intertwined your magical core with Mr. Malfoy’s. Because the magical core is strongly associated with thought, I believe your cores connected because you were either looking at or thinking about Mr. Malfoy just before the explosion.”
That being said, Harry still had his fair share of bad days. There were days when everything made him angry, when the smallest inconvenience sent waves of frustration through him that he struggled to suppress. There were days when he couldn't find the energy to get himself out of bed, when he was plagued with nightmares during the night and flashbacks during the day. There were days when he simply couldn't understand
"I don't think Draco is to blame, to be honest," Harry commented. "In hindsight, I wasn't that obvious about it."
“Your memory might not be powerful enough,” Harry stepped back to study Draco’s form. “Or—hang on, don’t forget to move your wand in circles as you cast.”
“Well,” Madam Pomfrey cast a few diagnostic charms on Harry. “You’re all good to go; Professor McGonagall will be here soon to bring you to your temporary living arrangements.
"I was wondering, if you and Remus were together during school," Harry said to Sirius, "how did my mum and dad react?"
, one that featured two male Quidditch players on the cover (whom Draco recognized to be from Pride of Portree
"Oh look, another present!" Ron said loudly, grabbing another gift at random and spinning in a circle to locate its recipient. Harry smiled with gratitude at the obvious attempt to draw attention from him.
"Hey!" Harry protested as Draco grabbed him by the wrist and hauled him down the corridor, "where are we going?"
Potter, do you think I’d bother asking if I wanted you to say no? What kind of people-pleaser do you think I am?”
Heart pounding, he slowly climbed into the bed, careful to not to touch the pillow that separated their two bodies. He laid the blanket over the two of them and rolled onto his side, tucking a corner of the blanket under his chin. He took a deep breath, willing his heart to
His fingers trailed up his thighs, a feather touch, ending so close to his dick but careful to not touch him. A tease of what was about to come.
Potter turned back to him. “See you around, Malfoy.” “Good evening, Potter.” He watched as Potter walked away, sinking in the view of his broad shoulders, before getting in the same cubicle from where the man had walked out. He closed the door behind him and took off his towel to hand it over the door.
A last sweep under his balls and he was done. With a wet warm towel, he took great care to clean him from the cream left, managing Harry’s cock like the most precious treasure in the world. Checking his work, he felt his mouth watering at his already impressive boyfriend’s cock, looking even bigger with his pubes trimmed and, shaft and balls perfectly hairless.
Draco was the one to break the kiss, panting hard. “Fuck me, Potter… Now.” He demanded with stern voice, even though he did not sound particularly intimidating, more adorably needy than anything else. Knowing full well that he only used his last name when he was angry with him or when he was desperate to have his cock up his arse, Harry was happy to fulfil his desire. Which, conveniently, coincided with his. What a lucky man.
Longbottom laughed softly, shaking his head. “You’re a terrible liar, Malfoy. But thank you anyway.” “Sorry. What are you dress up as exactly?” He asked feigning ignorance. Longbottom’s hair was green and big leaves came up of his head. He was wearing sand-coloured sweater and brown trousers. Around his waist, a big pot made of Merlin knew what, because at the eye it looked real. To complete the look, he wore a pair of green gloves with leaves on them. It was painfully evident what he has dressed up as.
“Kissing?” The gears continued to turn in his head. “Neville,” he said slowly. “Are you talking about me and

since you’re dealing with all of this right now. Merlin, I should’ve just kept my mouth shut, huh? This isn’t fair to you—”The words caught in his throat when Harry leaned over, swiftly planting a kiss on his cheek.
Draco hesitated before his smile returned to his face. “Well, at least it matches your awful fashion sense,” he said cheerfully, grabbing Harry’s hand and placing it in his lap.
From across the room, Draco shrugged and turned a page in his book. “Being stuck in your room is much easier if you’ve made your bed.” Sure enough, Draco was lying
“Voldemort,” Harry, Granger, and Weasley answered in unison. Draco flinched at the name, but a small warmth bloomed in his chest when Harry noticed and squeezed his hand.
“Yeah, that’s fine,” Harry answered, glancing at the menu that hung over the till. “Do you know what you want?”
Draco’s face twisted into something unreadable, and he started to shift away from Harry on the couch. “We can stay friends, right?” He asked desperately, “I don’t want to ruin our friendship and I’m sorry if I’m creeping you out or making you uncomfortable,
At first, Draco was just happy that his boyfriend had finally found a hobby—but then Harry showed up one night with his own pottery wheel, and it quickly became Draco’s favorite, too.
“At least take me to dinner first, will you?” He chided, leaning forward until his lips were hovering a mere inch from Draco’s.
“What are those?” Harry pointed to the textbook, where Draco had circled a dozen words with his quill.
He squinted at the narrow handwriting, barely legible under the dim moonlight, and by the time he finished reading, the owl was nowhere to be seen.
Harry swallowed, glancing at Malfoy to see how he was taking this. Malfoy merely looked resigned to their situation as he rested his head on his hand.
I want to be your boyfriend.” He kissed the corner of his mouth and added, “And I’m laughing because I’m surprised you asked for clarification—that sort of thing is usually implied.”
Harry threw his arms around Draco as soon as he'd left the changing rooms, and Harry’s subsequent kiss on the cheek sent Draco stumbling. "You should've
Potter, who had previously been ignoring the argument, looked up at the sound of his name. “We were brewing the Vervé Elixir
“Draco?” Harry called, walking down the hallway and frowning when Draco wasn’t in his usual spot in the library.
He sighed. "I'm not going to tell anyone," he said, exasperated. "Do you want me to swear it? Because I'll swear it—"
I had magic,” he pointed out. “I just knew that weird things happened to me, and they always got me in trouble. So even if I
Draco studied his face for a moment before removing his arm from around Harry. “I’m sorry you’re going through this right now,” he said softly, looking down at his hands.
Except—not exactly. It seemed Draco had had the same idea as Harry; when Harry turned his head to kiss Draco, Draco had done the same, and their lips collided rather roughly.
It seemed to take Harry a moment to process what was in front of him. “You—you want me to marry you?”
Her hands crept beneath his shirt, feeling for a heartbeat. For a moment, there was nothing, and then— a slow, weak rhythm within his chest.
“Well, he wasn’t dead, first of all—” Harry began, then he frowned. “—well, he wasn’t exactly alive, either…It was just a part of him that was the Heir of Slytherin.”
He immediately cursed his drunken tendency to say gay shit—specifically, his drunken tendency to say gay shit about
Harry's heart ached, and he couldn't take it anymore. He sat up, the cloak sliding onto the floor. Draco's shoulders shook as he tried to muffle his tears.
Draco was about to respond, but he stopped himself as he caught a glimpse of Harry’s right hand, which was still curled into a fist. “Are you—are you
When he returned (with the same blanket and pillow as before) Harry was curled up on the mattress, his arms wrapped tightly around himself. Though his robes concealed most of his body, Draco could’ve
Draco pursed his lips. “Right,” he said, “right, that makes sense.” He stared at the book in his hands. “Maybe I could—no, that wouldn’t work.” He turned the book around to show Harry the cover. “Um, it’s kind of stupid, but I was going to ask if you’d like me to read to you. Except—well, this book is in French.”
case, I think I might take a short walk,” Harry teased, “nip down to the kitchen, say hello to your mum—”
"Harry, I—" A voice croaked, and Harry recognized it immediately, his blood going cold. Draco Malfoy.
“So that’s why—” Harry blurted out as another thought wandered to the forefront of his mind. “So that’s why you were so weird about me showering!” He said triumphantly.
"No kidding," Harry agreed, "hey, come here." Draco lifted his head so that Harry could capture his lips with his own. "Mhm, much better. Anyways, I was thinking—maybe I could tell Remus and Sirius?"
If the Dark Lord was a viper, Harry was a garter snake—his Parseltongue flowed smoothly off his tongue, surrounding Draco’s mind in a way that sent a jolt down his spine.
he laughed, “I figured you couldn’t argue with me if I was asleep,” he shrugged easily, “oh please, did you really think I fell asleep
Potter, if anyone is going to mess up the potion, it'll be you," he retorted loudly, ignoring the way Hermione watched the interaction surreptitiously.
"Me, too," Draco agreed. He'd stumbled backwards when their lips connected, leaving him flat against the smooth stone wall.
“I—” Harry stammered, trying to find the right words. “You know how… you know how Voldemort couldn’t love?”
Harry's concentration faltered as he tried to get Draco to lay back on the floor. As soon as the spell was broken, the healed flesh began to split open.
Maybe it was just the extra stress from work, but this time it was particularly bad—Harry's self-deprecating thoughts were stronger this time, and he was struggling to hide them.
Draco headed straight for the first bed and swung the drapes shut without a word, effectively cutting himself off room the rest of the room. Harry sighed and sat in front of the fire instead, rifling through his bag. He didn’t have any spare parchment in his bag to write to his friends, and his trunk hadn’t appeared yet. He dug out a crumpled scroll and smoothed it over his knee. Hermione wouldn’t be too happy if he wrote on an old charms essay…
Harry shut the door behind him, quickly turning on the shower to muffle the sob that escaped him. He
Then the walls were closing in around him, squeezing the air out of his lungs—he gasped, acid spilling into his blood as he struggled to inhale, suffocating in the darkness.
"Shit," Harry muttered under his breath, his face flushed. He kept his eyes glued to the door to avoid looking at Draco.
Draco did as he was told, gingerly opening the carton and cutting a piece of fish off with his knife. “It’s…not bad, actually,” he said after a few bites, “I think it might be growing on me.”
Potter backed away, raising his hands in defense. Granger was wandless. Despite being wandless, Granger still managed to leave Potter cowering.
got nervous—at least, not around Harry. “What I mean is… romantic feelings are hard for you, yeah?” He waited for Harry to nod. “I don’t want to burden you with anything, I just—”
Harry felt a rush of warmth flow through him, giving him goosebumps and causing his heart to beat faster—in a
Harry carefully filled the dropper, forcing himself to concentrate. The book had emphasized the need to be precise—too much snail slime would drastically change the properties of the potion.
Harry sighed into Draco's shirt, reveling in the rare sensation of being held. As comforting as it was, he still felt guilty—Draco was doing
Avoiding the squeaky floorboards, he slowly made his way down to the kitchen. He was just about to put his shoes on when a figure appeared at the top of the stairs.
a new one, but that didn’t mean Harry shouldn’t give it back. It’s not like Harry had any use for it.
Draco took a shaky breath, unaware that Harry was conscious. "There's something I never had the chance to tell you. Well, I
Harry was about to say something else when he tilted his head to the side. “You smell good,” he told Draco, “are you wearing cologne?”
All thoughts in Draco’s mind ceased to exist—all that existed was Harry’s lips on his, the hand clutching his robes, and the arm that now snaked around his waist.
Draco nodded, frowning as he headed for his room. It was odd for his mother to forget about a gift, especially around the holidays.
like to know?” Harry answered smugly, laughing when Draco grumbled to himself and shoved him in the shoulder.
After a long, comfortable silence (during which Harry nearly fell asleep) Draco mumbled something into his shirt.
Hermione took a deep breath, muttering under her breath. “We resolved to keep quiet about this. Let Harry and Malfoy figure it out on their own.”
Harry repeated the healing spell with the Elder Wand while simultaneously casting a blood replenishing charm.
“Merlin,” Harry shook his head, grinning. “You must have thought I was bloody adorable in third year, then—”
Harry settled onto Draco’s bed as he launched into a description of the gifts he’d received for Christmas.
“Around the corner, under the sink.” Draco answered, watching him disappear into the kitchen with their trash.
Draco’s mouth went dry as Harry’s hands rested on his hips to pull him close. “Shut up and kiss me, Potter.”
Draco’s voice raised into a squeak, and he shook his head quickly. “Whatever, we need to concentrate on our mission. Let’s get going.”
Harry lifted his head carefully, his face inches from Draco's, and gently cupped his face with his palm before kissing him again,
Draco followed close behind. “I don’t need food, I need answers." He needed to know why Potter was paying attention to him like that—and he needed a better reason than
By the time Draco had finished his nighttime routine and emerged from his bedroom, Harry was already at the couch—Draco had a feeling that he’d simply cast a full-body
The spell slowly spread across his arm, fusing the skin back together, but it wasn't fast enough. Draco's head lolled to the side as he grew dizzy. "
he leaned forward, finger raised in the air. “They were saying the Heir of Slytherin was at Hogwarts! People were being petrified! Why wouldn’t I be talking about it?” He turned to look at Potter. “Who even was the Heir of Slytherin, anyway?”
ruined their date night—how was he going to make it up to Draco? Not only that, but Harry was being so stubborn and nasty to him, when all he was doing was trying to help.
Harry laughed. “Because that’s how you eat fish and chips,” he grinned at Draco’s bewildered expression. “C’mon, sit down and eat.”
“You’ve slept in—” confusion flashed across Draco’s face before he shook his head. “Don’t be stupid, Potter,
Malfoy, shut up!” Harry snapped, looking around for his glasses. There, on the nightstand—no, that was a quill. “Where the hell are my glasses?” He grumbled.
“It’s a shame you didn’t get to finish your potion, Harry,” Hermione told him during dinner. “The mechanism behind it is
“Hey, I have another question,” Harry said after a moment, running his fingers through Draco’s hair so that he would look up.
They jumped apart when the Muggle alarm clock in Harry’s bag went off, ringing throughout the whole cabin until Harry managed to find it and turn it off. It was seven o’clock—the latest they could sleep in without getting behind on their mission.
He did feel bad, after all. “Once, my father wouldn’t stop fussing with my hair before a dinner party, so I kept changing my hair color to make him mad,” he offered.
“When I was eleven," he began cautiously, “my uncle dragged all of us to a tiny hut in the middle of nowhere in an attempt to avoid my Hogwarts letter. It was dusty
Harry didn't see the panicked expression that flickered across Draco's face, but he did hear the hint of worry in his voice as he asked, "what do you mean?"
“Can you bring him Sirius’ jeans, his maroon linen blazer, and the light blue paisley silk shirt? And the adaptable cologne?”
“I’m happy,I can finally be myself, and work with cats and kneazles. And I’m looking forward to getting married.” Mick looked for a second as if they wondered whether they had said too much.
“You will feel better in a few minutes, and nothing speaks against you returning in for the finale if you stay sitting here until I give you the okay.
“Mr. Draco Malfoy should be going to Mr. Harry Potter. Dempy has everything under control here.” Dempy beckoned Draco to the Floo with a stern face.
“You can’t do that, Uncle Harry, the other cat loves their human, too. You know, Mikey Dawlish from my nursery school group said he didn’t like me because my hair is blue and he doesn’t like blue, and I asked him what his favourite colour was, and he said green. I made my hair green for a whoooole storytime for him, and then for a few shorter times when he asked me to, and now we are friends. He even got to like blue. Maybe if you talk to them, they will be your friend, too. And now, in second form, Mikey is sitting next to me too.” Teddy explained with excitement.
Harry sat down, cast the shaving charms, and then said calmly, “The only thing my uncle taught me was when to run away from him and when to pretend I didn’t exist. It was Sirius who started teaching me, when it was actually still a bit early, and then Arthur Weasley continued when I really had enough facial hair to need to shave.”
If he was honest, the House of Black was just minimally better than the Malfoys. And the few good people, like Sirius, Andromeda and Regulus were just proof of what a coward Draco was. After all, they were the proof it was possible to be better than he had been.
“Harry, huh? I think you should send Kreacher for some of Sirius’ clothes. Regulus’ clothes scream conservative Pureblood. But Sirius’ clothes… You know, the man was hoooooooot. It’s sad that he hadn’t had a chance to bond with the house. But Harry only rarely comes here. It’s not good for the house not to be bonded to somebody.” The mirror was very talkative.
Draco’s heart was beating as if it were dancing in his chest. Abbott’s questions  if he was going to love Harry for better for worse, in health and in sickness, forever and ever, felt like the questions were if water was wet and the sun hot.
“We have to help Harry work through his feelings. Malfoy has always played a special role for Harry,” Ron said in a patient yet slightly exasperated voice.
“But I don’t have a date for it.” Harry knew that it would be far better to have one, but all his friends were paired off; even Lee who had grieved Fred just as much as George had and hadn’t dated after his boyfriend’s death was now seeing a former Hufflepuff interior designer. But he still was counted as one of the Weasleys’ in-laws.
“And you are lucky to see Nargles and Wrackspurts. Not everyone has such good eyes. How is Ginny, by the way?” Mick remembered having a crush on Ginny in sixth year. That was long ago, before Astoria had won their heart.
“Maybe I could take one Lego for tutoring my friend Greg and some younger Slytherin students during my school days?” Draco’s voice sounded shaky again.
Draco thought of Severus. He had been strict as his name; now that no house rivalry blocked Draco’s view anymore, he had to admit to himself that Severus had never been fair to the Gryffindors and resented Potter just for looking like his father. Severus had been a bad teacher, except for his very favourite students, of which there were only two, Adrian Pucey and Draco himself. But he had taught Draco, his godson, about life outside the circles of the elites. After his release from house arrest, remembering Severus’ narrations went a long way to limit the damage from Draco’s parents’ lack of practical education.
Before Harry had figured out how to explain it to his godson, Meowfoy gave another heartbreaking yowl and stared at the door as if he could hypnotize it to open by itself.
When we have arranged for a celebrant for our wedding, I’ll make sure Mr. Potter gets an invitation, too. Do you think he would agree to come to my wedding, maybe even to sit at the head table with us?
He looked up and nearly forgot to breathe. There, in front of him, just before the way forked between the way to the toilet and the staff only area, his great-great-grandfather Achilles looked down at him from a portrait. And Achilles wasn’t alone. His arm was draped around a redheaded man, whose resemblance with Arthur Weasley was undeniable.
Lucius had waited patiently at the entrance of Diagon Alley. It was humiliating to not just go in, but with the state of health, using even the little magic it took to just open the access to Diagon Alley could kill him. That was the reason they had released him from Azkaban in the first place. He was practically a Squib.
Narcissa sat in her place in the first row on the groom’s side. She looked back and watched the people filing in, those who knew little about Draco full of happy excitement, the select few who knew that Draco and Astoria weren’t willingly getting married to each other with the sombre air of parting with someone who was just sentenced to house arrest or a year in Azkaban.
“Sparkling silver eyes, beautiful hands and the finest arse ever don’t qualify as insults.” Potter chuckled.
I’m summoning all my courage and writing it here: My name is Draco Malfoy. I know you have heard lots about me. And nothing good.
Weasley asked Greg to go home, assuring him that nobody would suspect Draco, even going so far as to say that he would personally make sure Draco was safe and would be treated with respect. He quickly turned to Draco, asked him to squeeze a piece of parchment half the size of a ten-pound note into the palm of his non-dominant hand, made a wand movement, and asked Draco to give the piece of parchment to Greg.
“You’re a human being with flaws and strengths, and they all think they can stuff you into a bottle and turn you into their personal genie,” Draco replied.
Draco stumbled over the incantation as Harry quickly moved Draco’s wand in tiny circles.  The spell worked despite the stuttering, and this time, the Patronus had a bit more shape. It took a bit longer than usual, but the Patronus became corporeal after a few seconds. “Are you
“Um,” Draco laughed awkwardly, his voice sounding foreign to his own ears. “Thank you,” his voice cracked loudly.
“Oh, you know how she is,” Hermione wrinkled her nose at Ron. “She’s always looking for some reason to keep you. And honestly, I don’t blame her, considering that you always manage to turn up to the hospital wing unconscious.”
He only managed a few steps before he felt a searing pain in chest, his hearing fading to a mere ringing as he crumpled to the floor.
Harry happily accepted this response and pulled Draco to the sofa to sit and chat with their friends. Draco reluctantly let him—personally, he’d much rather go to their room and snog.
“Anyways,” Harry scooped up Draco’s free hand and linked their fingers together. “You know what Remus and Sirius gave me?” He paused for emphasis. “An album with all of the notes my mum and dad passed to each other during Hogwarts,” he said softly, “I spent all afternoon looking through it.”
were never angry for no reason, and whatever this new emotion was— I could hardly describe it, much less put a name to it.
ones, of course) Aurors Potter and Malfoy were given the rest of the weekend off—Robards hadn’t even given them paperwork to do before their next mission.
“Of course I don’t mind, Potter, how selfish do you think I am?” Draco looked Harry up and down appreciatively, admiring the way the pale clay stood out against his dark skin. “Besides, it doesn’t seem like you’re going to give up this hobby of yours anytime soon.”
"Well, I was thinking that your family tree must be easy for you," he drawled, "after all, you're the only one on it."
Ron's, Hermione's and Ginny's acted as a trigger as the rest of the survivors began screaming and yelling at the Death Eaters.
Harry was lying on his back, wrapped in a cloak that seemed much too large to be his own. The fabric covered his eyes, it's musty scent filling his nostrils and smelling suspiciously of Hagrid. He
“There’s a chippy just down the street,” Harry suggested, “we could grab something there and then figure out some place to eat.”
Draco placed his hand on Harry’s knee, and the urgency in his voice made Harry open his eyes. “You are
Gryffindor courage," his voice sounded bitter. "In sixth year, you found me in Myrtle's bathroom. I was crying, sobbing really, in a rather unattractive manner. We attempted to duel, you nearly killed me, the details aren't important." He looked at the floor, fidgeting with his cloak. "I—I was crying because—because I'd just realized that I'm in love with you.
The Vervé Elixir is a potion that temporarily strengthens your magic by enhancing your magical core-"verve" means "vigor, vitality, energy," and I added the accent bc I thought it sounded cool LMAO
He regretted his choice immediately when she smirked wickedly, tapping her finger against her chin as she thought of a question. She cast her eyes around the group as if looking for inspiration, and Harry stiffened when she made eye contact with Draco Malfoy and gave him a sly grin.
Draco tilted his head. "Would that be alright?” He asked carefully, and Harry realized with a start that he wasn’t going to mention the kiss at all—at least, not until Harry did, all in an effort to not make him uncomfortable.
He listened closely for the sound of Ron's breathing and waited a whole five minutes before deciding it was safe.
One Christmas, Harry gifted Narcissa a beautifully crafted vase and, after she commented that she’d love to get more like it, he sheepishly admitted that he’d made it himself.
The room looked just like the eighth year dormitories, aside from the extra furniture. In the corner was a small fireplace with a few chairs, right next to a table for eating.
Once they were left with only their absolute favorites (still a few dozen pieces) they ended up sticking the rest in storage, as they had no idea what to do with them—until Draco came home with what he considered to be a brilliant idea.
they don’t teach apparition until you’re sixteen,” Draco replied. “Your magic isn’t developed or strong enough to handle it. And you did it when you were
Instead of arguing, Potter merely rolled his eyes and went to his trunk. “That’s great, Malfoy,” he pulled out fresh clothes and a bottle of muggle shower gel. “But I need to shower.” He stood up and went towards the bathroom.
Once out of the shower, he got dressed and ran a flannel under some cold water, pressing it to his eyes. When he looked in the mirror, he schooled his face into a neutral expression. No, you couldn’t tell he’d been crying at all.
The cabin reminded Harry much of the hut that his uncle had dragged him to on his eleventh birthday, in an attempt to escape the deluge of Hogwarts letters sent to Harry. This situation was much more favorable, however—the cabin was considerably less dusty and damp, even if it
“I don’t think I can,” Harry answered in a small voice, “I don’t think I’ll be able to concentrate on anything other than
“Malfoy’s intent was clearly to incite a reaction from Harry, that’s always his intent. To time his insult just when he was adding the snail slime—”
He hurried to the couch, tossing his book aside as Harry opened his arms to let Draco slip under the afghan.
Hagrid shuffled to the edge of the courtyard as Voldemort silenced the crowd, bringing Harry into the castle to keep him out of sight.
” Harry smiled, “I asked them. Turns out, my parents were the reason they started dating in the first place. They were
Their lips were clumsy and their teeth clashed against one another, but Harry hardly noticed as all coherent thought flew out the window. Draco made a small, satisfied noise in the back of his throat, and Harry's knees turned to jelly.
Perhaps that was why very few people knew of Harry’s hobby; aside from Draco, only Ron and Hermione knew (and that was because it was impossible to hide the dozens of pieces covering every surface of Harry’s flat.) It was simply too intimate to share, especially when there were so few things kept from the public eye.
It was on one of these bad days that Harry dragged himself home from work, fully intending to get changed and snap himself out of the bad mood before Draco could see him like this. They'd had this date night planned for months, and Harry wasn't about to ruin it because he wasn't able to suck it up and push through the day.
Harry ran his hands though his hair, feeling like he’d been caught doing something wrong. “I—I mean, I guess I just didn’t hear it come in—”
he was able to tangle his fingers through Harry’s hair as he read—and he smiled self-satisfactorily when he saw the goosebumps that arose on Harry’s arms.
“So our friends can murder us tomorrow?” Harry shook his head, “No thank you. Personally, I’m not sure I can survive another Killing Curse.”
“What I mean is—” he swallowed, and Harry tilted his head, trying to decipher his sudden nervousness. Draco
Harry frowned, unsure whether he should be happy that he’d managed to brew most of the potion correctly, or embarrassed that it hadn’t been very strong. “So much for an uneventful school year,” he grumbled.
"I used to do this all the time when I was younger," Draco chuckled, "I'd get the house-elves to arrange little trays of food for me late at night and hold imaginary tea parties—you never did anything like that?
riled up—the way his veins stood out from the effort, the steadiness of his fingers as he pinched the clay with
“We can’t use magic, Potter,” Draco said sharply, watching Harry kneel in front of the hearth. “I won’t have you compromising this mission because you’re a little
a head of house?” Harry asked out loud, eyeing Professor Snape as the announcement patronus finished its message and vanished.
No one, not even Draco, pointed out the blatant rule breaking, as everyone shuffled to their respective sides.
Draco managed to break away from the Ravenclaws and started pacing the pitch, flying back and forth between the Ravenclaw goalpost and wherever the Ravenclaw seeker happened to be. It paid off, because within seconds, he'd spotted the snitch. Harry felt a burst of pride as Draco dove for it; his Spiral Dive was absolutely
Harry! I’m happy for you.” His expression faltered for a minute, as if something was bothering him, but it was gone so quickly that Harry thought he’d imagined it.
He pulled away after a moment, and once again, the only sound was my uncontrolled breathing—only this time, it was for a different reason.
"That's alright," Draco gave him a sly grin, carefully folding the arms of the glasses and placing them on Harry's bedside table. "After all, we wouldn’t want them to get smudged again, would we?"
, and Draco certainly didn't want that conversation to be initiated by a magazine that his mother had given him.
“If it makes you feel any better, Potter,” Pansy smirked. “Draco here was just as bad, if not worse.”
he should share, if he should share anything at all. Regardless, shutting Draco out would be an absolute
in his bed. He put up with it, of course, because closing the curtains meant he could use silencing charms. He had to admit, though, that he was relieved when Ron found about the charms and made him promise to stop—without them, there was no reason for him to shut the curtains at night.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought you’d say,” Harry shook his head in amusement, crossing his arms and leaning back against the wall. “What a charmer you are.”
Harry blinked, his eyes bleary with sleep as he attempted to get a look at his surroundings. He was clearly in the hospital wing—the white bed he was in being a dead giveaway—but he couldn’t discern any other details, as his glasses were missing. Mercifully, he noticed, his skin was healed—he’d be in a
When it finally came out of Draco’s grasp, it was pulled off his body completely, leaving him exposed to the draft that breezed through the cabin. Draco exhaled slowly, trying to maintain his composure as he pulled the blanket back over him. Harry pulled it back almost immediately.
“I don’t have the patience to deal with this anymore!” Pansy snapped. “You guys are just a bunch of Gryffindors!”
They both laid perfectly still for a long moment, both hyper aware of the exceedingly small space between them. And then—to Draco’s horror—Harry rolled over to face him, draping an arm across Draco’s torso and burying his face in the back of his neck.
“Sorry,” Harry said shortly, grabbing his schoolwork with a huff and dumping it on his bed. “And thanks, I guess.”
Once they were all tested and wearing the strange magical masks, McGonagall cleared her throat. “Attention, please.” She waited for everyone to stop talking. “Given how communicable this illness appears to be, all students will be quarantined from this point onwards. Uninfected students will move to the east wing rooms in pairs, and under
Suddenly aware of how close he stood to Draco, Harry subtly shuffled back a step. "Don't deny it, though, you're
"I thought you'd be jumping at the chance to get away from the ferret," Ron snorted. "Which, why haven't you mentioned that in any of your letters?" He leaned forward in his chair, lowering his voice. "What's it like, being in close proximity to him and all of his
but it was mostly junk; coat hangers, tissues, that sort of stuff.” He was looking into his hands, so he missed the way Draco’s face twisted with anger as he spoke.
Harry grasped the window sill and hauled himself up, pulling himself into the room. Losing his balance, he tumbled onto the floor, landing on his back. Slightly out of breath, he righted himself and brushed off his clothes. "See? I knew what I was doing."
The only downside to his new hobby, Harry had complained one evening as he swept pieces of ceramic off the floor—Draco had tried to shove
they'll accept me, but it isn't the same as telling someone who's been through the same thing," he paused. “How did you come out to Pansy?”
Okay, so maybe the sound wasn’t actually ‘horrific.’ For a split second, Draco braced himself for memories of the Dark Lord to wash over him—after all, he’d heard a lot of Parseltongue during the Dark Lord’s residence at the Manor. But Harry’s Parseltongue was completely different—it was much softer, nothing like the painful screeching that grated on his ears when the Dark Lord spoke it.
He looked down to finally pick up the box, holding it up to the light to inspect the ring and it’s engravings. “Is this—is this my
By now, Harry was scribbling a response to Ron and Hermione. “That’s alright. I’ll just send this real quick, and you can send something when she comes back.” Before Draco even answered, Harry added to the note that he was letting him borrow Hedwig, and to not expect a response until the morning.
“I’ve looked at you every single day. And on bad days, looking at you, even though I thought I could only fancy you from far, was what made it worth getting up.” Harry whispered in his ear. Then he sucked at Draco’s earlobe. His hand began to stroke Draco’s cock through the fabric.
“I object!” That was McGonagall. “I have reasons to believe that both bride and groom want to marry someone else. And that they are free to do so.”
“You see me as a friend? Despite all the things I did?” Draco’s face felt terribly hot, yet it was a glorious feeling.
The hand moved away again, gliding first across the pillow, then ghosting over bare nipples. Draco didn’t need to know that Harry slept topless.
“Seven years is madness!” Harry almost yelled. “Even from Azkaban those Pureblood supremacists still harm their own children and the ones who love them!”
“Draco, what if there were a way you needn’t marry her? You wouldn’t need the love potion at all.” Pansy put a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“I’m not. You’re beautiful when you come. So beautiful, I had to touch myself, too. I just vanished the mess wordlessly.” Harry grinned, then cuddled up to him and kissed him. Draco tasted himself on Harry’s tongue.
“Uncle Harry, which one is your cat? I love cats but Mum says we can only have one when Abbie is bigger.” Mary and her friend Lucy jumped with excitement.
The phrase “fresh pickled toad” evoked a cringe in Draco, as he remembered writing bad poetry in second year, only saved from embarrassment as everyone had assumed it to be the work of the Weaslette.
Six months later, Harry was on his way through Selfridges, when he noticed a small girl who looked about 5 years old, crying. Her dark coiled hair was pulled back in braids.
“Harry, dear, I’m glad to have you here. And with a plus one.” Molly pulled Harry and a completely overwhelmed Draco into a bear hug. “Mr. Malf…”

The camera cut to the bedroom, where Draco just buttoned up his flowy white shirt. He was wearing a pair of jeans that hugged his arse just perfectly and Chelsea boots. Then, he sat down at his new dresser with a mischievous grin and applied eyeliner.
“Well, each of us spends enough time with their mindhealers to be able to channel that when need arises.” Hermione gave Ron a soft look. “Did Malfoy tell you when and how he died?”
Narcissa had the vague feeling that the headmistress had been told what Lucius had done to Draco. But could that be? Would she forget her manners for a moment from hearing that someone did something atrocious to Draco Malfoy? Yes, she had allowed him to come back for eighth year, but did she care that much about the fate of a boy who had let Death Eaters into Hogwarts?
“Professor. While it’s true that this isn’t a marriage we want, Draco must marry a Greengrass. And I can only not marry him if he marries someone else.” Astoria replied, while Draco’s glamour fell and tears ran down his face.
Malfoy washed the shampoo out, and massaged a hair mask into the lengths of Harry’s hair. “Your hair needs more moisture, you have such a gorgeous hair structure, but nobody ever taught you how to take good care of it.”
“He didn’t live to teach you the charms to bond the house to your magic? It would adapt to your needs and wishes if you could cast them.” Draco hoped that Aunt Bella would suffer in the afterlife for all eternity.
“Sirius, sorry, but what sexual favours Remus promised you is too much information.” Harry interrupted him.
Ron looked to and fro between Harry and Malfoy. He may normally pretend to be oblivious of people’s love stories, because they were none of his business. But this was Harry, and if someone hurt Harry he and Hermione were the ones to pick up the pieces and help him survive. And for some reason, Harry clung to the idea of helping Malfoy.
Mick glared at both of them. “Behave yourselves, both of you. You don’t want to distress your cats, do you?”
Mick chuckled. “Their cats might demand that they face the hippogriff and talk to each other. After all, throughout Hogwarts they have picked fights with each other and then stared at each other’s arses. Anyone less stubborn than those two would have stopped fighting and started snogging before seventh year. If their cats force them to be in contact, that will be a well-deserved intervention.”
“Can you tell us something about the neighbors here? We wouldn’t want to live next door from noisy children or weirdos with tattoos,” Mr. Walters said, and Harry felt the desire to hex him into next week, but poor next week.
“Yes. Bloody hell! I never would have thought that he has to transform as a portrait, too. The only comforting thing is that it doesn’t hurt him anymore. Although we are capable of feeling things.” Sirius replied with a wink, before taking a deep breath with glittering eyes. Harry suppressed an exasperated groan at the memory of the activities he had caught Sirius and Remus in the middle of before he had provided them a bedroom picture in a closed box.
Draco walked into the middle of the room, and the children made enough space for him that he could have transformed into an elephant. He concentrated and transformed into his unicorn form.
Harry obviously laid on his side now, and stroked his cock firmly, while fingering his arse with his other hand.
“Look at them, too stick up their arse to even dance a waltz, no, they do a Minuet that was out of fashion before Binns was born. And that idiot calls you broken! You deserve a boyfriend who only has eyes for you, someone who knows you are the best thing that ever happened to him, you deserve someone who reminds you every day that you deserve the best. I wish I could be that boyfriend.” Draco pressed his hand against his mouth.
“It’s not an option. Harry’s friends might pop in any time, and I have no idea if they warn us first.” Draco blushed.
“No, I only learned about the cursed rings recently from Narcissa, but the matter is personal for me.” Harry ruffled his hair. “I was resigned to the fact that Draco plans to marry you, until she told me the truth. I love him, and Narcissa might have found a loophole. I just don’t know if Draco fancies me.”
“How is your mother?” Harry asked while assembling the ingredients for his berries and chocolate pancakes he usually made for special occasions. He remembered that Malfoy always used to have a sweet tooth.
“She is being asking him to move in with a friend, but she can’t be offering him a room in her apartment, she is having only one room. And she is wanting to have overnight guests who are being actually interested in mating with her.” Dempy said shyly.
“You’ve spent enough years having to be the hero. I love you when you’re strong and fierce, but I also love you if you want to be the little spoon.” Draco and Harry sort of melted into each other’s embrace.
Draco summoned all his courage to ask. “Would-would you explain to me as much of it as you are allowed to tell civilians, Granger?”
Both Draco and Harry were wearing glamours. She could only tell because she knew what to look for. Harry kept touching Draco’s arm reassuringly.
“Can you give me a little advice on the house bonding later? Also, for now, what clothes would you recommend for me to wear to impress Harry?” Draco asked.
“Your MacDougal diamonds!” Granger exclaimed. “I’ve never seen such synchronicity in two MacDougal diamonds, unless…” She shut her mouth as if she had said too much, then started again. “I can’t tell you what it might mean now, but I promise I’ll tell you what I know after my theory has been tested. Telling you now might influence the results.”
And she is terrified of travelling by air kraft, who wouldn’t be? Flying where one can’t breathe properly and just protected by a metal box that is powered by fire?
Yes, Draco had always had effeminate tendencies, not taking his ballet lessons reluctantly to have a good balance for dueling, but enjoying them and crying when his two years that belonged to a proper Pureblood education were over.
Draco read the letter again. He had taken a vacation for the next week. But this time, there was more to organize. Where could he leave Pawter? Pansy’s crup had whined a lot the last time they had visited him. He had been afraid of Pawter. And Blaise was in Canada for a modeling job. Greg had enough to do with his bakery, he wouldn’t have time to care for a cat. And Theo? You wouldn’t let Theo care for a cactus, let alone a cat that had a very Gryffindor-esque personality.
“No, actually, he was an abusive bigot.” It took Draco all his courage to word this knowing very well that many people would hear it, but it felt fucking liberating.
But they invited him to their celebrations, and Mipsy and Acorn’s wedding had been the best celebration of the last three years.
“As-Astoria Greengrass.” That was why Mick had seemed so worried. They thought that he might have a problem with being rejected by both Greengrass sisters. In reality, it had been a relief. It had felt incestuous to be expected to be married to one of his third cousins. Lucius Malfoy’s standard of not condoning inbreeding was marrying his son to a third cousin instead of a first or second.
“Okay, so, you tell me that Draco doesn’t love Astoria but fancies me instead. I can’t deny that I’ve been pining for him for quite some time now, but he was the one who decided that he didn’t want to date me, but marry Astoria. And I’d rather have him in my life as a friend than to lose even that. He made his choice and I have to accept it.” Harry ruffled his hair. “Whether he loves her or not, the result is the same. He doesn’t want to date me.”
Hermione knelt on the other one and took Draco’s hand. “Harry, your wand. You know the ritual from when we had to cooperate on the Wessex case.”
I promise, and I would be ready anytime to take Veritaserum and prove, that every word I said about my thoughts and feelings in my letters to you were the truth. Yet, I couldn’t blame you if you were to think I just want to get into people’s good graces again. That’s literally what I hear every time I do something that helps people.
And wanking obviously was not enough to get it out of his system. How the fuck did the Scarhead get under his skin even when he no longer had one.
After Hermione had instructed Draco about the rules he had to obey in order to get well soon and Flooed out, Dempy made them a calming lavender chamomile tea and coaxed Draco to eat the dinner that Harry had left under a stasis charm when Draco hadn’t showed up. Meanwhile it was morning, but Hermione had said that the spices of the Dhal would be very helpful to make him sweat out some of the toxins from the residue. Potter sat beside him and watched him with an odd smile, while drinking his awfully sweetened coffee and eating a croissant with marmalade.
But Harry knew that Sirius would not let him off the hook about it, if Meowfoy didn’t calm down by himself, Sirius would surely insist.
He scolded himself in his thoughts for his paranoia. He might cast an Animagum Revelio later, but definitely not in Luna’s presence. That would be rude. He did, however, look into her eyes, and was greatly relieved that there was no sign of her being under the Imperius. Damn, Harry, if Muggles see Mother Theresa or Elvis Presley on a cornflake, and it’s by coincidence, then a resemblance between a cat and Malfoy can be a coincidence, too.
