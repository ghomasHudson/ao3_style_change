Harry picked up his broom and went out onto the pitch.
Please come say hi on
“Yes, I mean,” said Draco. “Him. His - his snake.”
“Like that, do you Malfoy?” Harry asked him breathlessly. “Are you going to come from this?”
“Right you are, Hermione,” said Ron, taking a sip of his drink and looking carefully at Harry. “What did you talk about when you stayed behind? Anything we can hear about?”
Not ten hours before, Harry had taken, by owl delivery, the bespoke potion that he had ordered from Blaise for Draco. It was the modified Polyjuice potion. It would have given Draco… well, so much of what was in front of him, the round curves and the breasts with the large nipples.
The other players were done changing into their scrimmage gear. Harry was interested to note that Malfoy changed in a shower stall, by himself, so that nobody else could see him.
“No thanks,” Harry said. “I think I’ll just walk to an apparition point and go back home to Scotland. We have an early practice tomorrow.” That was a lie, but Harry was intent on spending at least an hour here in Shoreditch before he went home, and he didn’t want Ron and Seamus knowing about it.
“Well, you won’t do it, will you,” said Ron, firmly, as if he could hear Harry’s brewing sense of self-disgust. “I’ll help you write the reports. We’ll make sure you look like you’re cooperating, and we’ll also make sure we don’t write anything incriminating that Malfoy doesn’t deserve.”
She was tall, and had long, brown hair, but it was shaved on one side and thrown over her shoulder on the other. She was wearing black boots and a flowing olive green robe that stopped mid thigh.
“Mr. Potter.”
He never thought Hermione was one for theatrics, but sitting in the front row at the head of a thousand wizards and witches, watching Ron take her hand, he was awed, as ever, at her instincts. She’d talked Ron into wearing the sword of Gryffindor, and he looked ferocious with it strapped to his side, knocking on his glinting black boots, the tall length of him splendid in the afternoon sun of the Great Hall.
Draco meets his probation officer.
Harry knew he’d made a right mess of Malfoy, and that he was still covered in it. And so he watched him, for the first time, and for the first time, Harry noticed that he flew beautifully. He was graceful. He could dodge, and flip, and skate past the beaters; he was powerful and fast and aggressive.
Ron lifted Hermione’s veil, and kissed her.
“Mr. Potter,” Draco said, his lip curling.
I'm also looking for a beta. This work was unbeta'd, which I think was important as it gave me some space to write, but the next fic will for sure have a beta.
Harry tugged at his hair. “Yes, sir.”
He was ignoring Malfoy because he wanted to humiliate him, a little.
Ron and Neville were nearly pink with glee by the time Harry caught up with them for after work pints. When he pulled a stool up to the end of their table, they were in the middle of regaling Hermione with the blow-by-blow of the morning meeting.
Ron and Cho left pleased as punch, clutching a file full of dossiers on actual dark wizards selling potions that promised their purchaser a very good time indeed. And since Harry’s new assignment was so very trivial that he didn’t even need a partner to carry out his duties, Neville had the good fortune of joining them as a Herbology consultant.
“About what? Everything that needed to be said was said, Draco. End of story.”
Draco was standing rigidly on his front step. Harry noticed that he was wearing the same set of robes he’d had on the other times they’d seen each other, at the ministry, but now he had a chance to… take them in. Properly. And they were… they were…
“Tell me what you want, Malfoy.”
“Sir,” Harry said. “Why does this file say ‘Draco Black’?”
Draco frowned. “Is that a question required by the form?”
Pucey asked, disbelievingly. “You wear… right, what’s Potter doing with your pink knickers in his locker?”
---------------------------
Harry looked down at Draco, who had edged closer to his chest and was fiddling with the knotted cravat. His forearms rested on him gently. Harry cupped his elbows and moved him just a bit closer.
Draco nodded. Harry wrote.
“Does anyone reside there with you?”
Harry smiled at them as they left. As soon as their backs were through the door, Harry turned around and made eye contact with the three girls who had been watching him while they thought he wasn’t paying attention. A man had been watching him too, which Harry found newly interesting. He considered for a moment going home with him instead. He was tall and had a nice body, but Harry realized that the likelihood of him wearing the kind of attire he was hoping to see tonight was slim to none.
Malfoy looked at him, clearly trying to master the shade his face was turning, and failing. “Potter.” His voice was steady though, and clear.
“I could help you there,” Katherine said, brightly. She looked back at the group she’d come from. “If you’d like, my friend Lauren could join us? She’s got your Quidditch picture hung up at her desk at work.”
Harry broke eye contact with Robards and stared at his reflection in the polished mahogany of the table.
There is a great deal of sex in this chapter.
“Hi,” she said. “Katherine.”
“Go to the bedroom and lie down.” Harry said. The note of command was still in his voice, but it was softer now.
“I hate him,” Harry said, with feeling.
Narcissa Malfoy answered his owl immediately, and within an hour they were sat in a muggle coffee shop. She looked completely out of place and was fairly gawking at the green mermaid on the logo painted in the window; Harry made an order at the counter and sat down in front of her.
to hurt himself, and that had cost them the game, and probably the playoffs, they were so far behind in the points.
Harry rested his head on the wooden lockers, just above Malfoy’s shoulder, breathing hard. Malfoy wouldn’t look at him; he seemed lost in his own world, taking shuddering breaths and keeping his head pointed at the shower. Harry grabbed his chin, pointing his face towards his own, and Malfoy opened his eyes.
Draco gave him an inscrutable look. “My services are contracted by Muggles. Quite frequently. You wouldn’t believe the amount of pounds Muggles are prepared to spend on wedding stationary. And it’s - well, it’s obviously a bigger market than wizarding weddings.”
Harry felt the beginnings of a headache coming on. He knew it was going to be like this, but in all the chaos of the week, he hadn’t quite prepared himself for how frustrating this was going to be. “Where in Wiltshire?”
Underneath the tunic, Draco wore a white shirt, not frilly so much as it was billowing, like a pirate might have worn, only with fewer embellishments. Simpler. It was gathered in a bunch at his wrists, and the fabric beyond the bunches fell down to the first knuckles of his hands, each of which sported a single golden ring on the middle fingers.
He’d been stupid, and not paying attention, and hurt himself. Worse: Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that he had gone onto the pitch
Harry was starving. “Look, there’s a kebab stand just outside the ministry. Can I buy you one? By way of… of apology?”
“Completely,” Harry said. “In fact, he only just -”
Shaking his head, Harry sat down. “Is that the chair that least offends your pureblood sensibilities?”
“Er, right,” said Harry, unprepared for the sudden fond look she was giving him. “Well. The reason I’ve called you here.” He bent over and reached into his bag. He extracted a book and set it heavily down in front of Narcissa.
“You… I wasn’t… you have -” Harry couldn’t quite settle on which astonishing thing he had just learned to comment upon. “You work for muggles?”
“And then -” Neville was nearly helpless with laughter, bent over the table and struggling to get enough air in to finish his sentence, “he called it a ‘total bloody disaster of an assignment’, right to his face. And Kingsley was standing in the back of the room, Hermione, it was beautiful.”
He was just sitting down in the kitchen to a bit of toast when his floo roared to life, and a delicately folded scroll popped out of the fireplace.
Naturally, he’d forgotten that the next day was meetings, booked solid, with the Creature department and the Wizengamot, processing the werewolves they’d brought in from Bavaria. And so again, Harry returned to his cubicle in the early evening, to find Draco sitting opposite his desk, looking quite hungry indeed.
“You know the year, Potter.”
----------------------------
Ron would tell him to do nothing. For now. To keep the information to himself until he needed it later, an ace up his sleeve, in case Malfoy ever fucked with him or stood in his way, as he undoubtedly would. Sometime. But Ron was gifted at strategy in a way that Harry lacked the self control to ever act upon.
“I - I thought all manors have lands,” Harry said. “Isn’t that the income you live off? Renting the land to farmers?”
Draco picked up his bag, evidently deciding to change somewhere more private, and walked out.
And he was beautiful. The jet black of the Magpie’s uniform set off his pale skin superbly, so that his skin and his bright blond hair seemed to glow. The topknot on his head (which Harry realized was fairly large - Malfoy must have grown out his hair a considerable length) had come loose around his temples, framing his angular face with wisps of hair that blew about in the strong wind.
He went with Ron and Seamus, as was his custom on Saturday nights, and waited while they got a bit tipsy at the bar. Harry had suggested they go out to a trendy outdoor muggle bar in Shoreditch built on top of shipping containers. Their usual haunt in Knockturn Alley wouldn’t do for Harry’s purposes. The few times he had picked up girls at that club, pictures of them together had wound up in
Malfoy said nothing whatsoever.
I am absolutely thrilled to have finished this in a way that pleases me. I've been terrified to complete it, and I hope if you've read it as I've been posting that it's not disappointing, too little or too much. This was my first fic to be published. The others were aborted - I did the digital version of ripping them up and throwing them away in someone else's trash can, as William S Burroughs said of his early writing. I have so many more planned - the next will be a bit of fluff on the topic of calligraphy and wedding planning, and I've got a few outlines of novels, so please, if you liked my work, subscribe to me as an author, and there will be more shortly.
There had been a
. Not him. He scorched it black with a curse.
Mr. Potter,
Harry took several steps towards him, pulling off his rugby shirt as he moved. Once it was over his head, he caught Draco staring at his well-muscled stomach.
When she returned, Harry continued. “We’re going to get to know each other quite well, I think,” he said. “You’re going to spend a lot of time with me. That’s because Draco and I are going to be spending a lot of time with each other. I like him, and I’d like to see him. In his home. And I’m not going to be entering through the back door, or the floo. I’ll be ringing the bell, showing up with flowers.”
“Excuse me?” Draco had the nerve to look injured. “We had a fight at my mother’s tea, you stormed out and went… on a rampage, apparently, while I was left holding the bag, wondering if I’d ever hear from you again.”
“I…..” Malfoy stopped, and now his whole face was red, and he’d pulled his knees up to his chest. “I want you to humiliate me again. Like you did on Monday. But in a different way. Ways. All sorts of ways.” He was breathing fast now, and he wasn’t looking at Harry. He was talking to his knees, like Harry wasn’t there. “I want you to touch me, but not the normal way. I want you to tell me what to do. To treat me like…. Like you’re better than me. To embarrass me.”
“Harry, why are only some of the doors on your calendar working?” Rose asks, as she clambers up the steps, dragging a long tail of tinsel behind her.
The calendar remains unimpressed.
“Some of us like to be diligent about our work,” he sniffs, taking a swallow. It produces a delighted peal of laughter from Potter that Draco wishes he could make happen again and again.
Sato gives him a sympathetic look from behind her desk on the other side of the room.
“Wait!” Harry pants, grabbing at his arm. “Let me explain….”
Harry walks along the path, ducking carefully under some stray vines.
Draco leans against the window frame, his back against the stone and his legs crossed at the ankles. Finding the room for the ritual seems to have restored his equilibrium and he doesn’t seem as upset as he had been. “How will we know if it’s Solstice?” he asks Hermione. “I have no fucking idea how many actual days have passed since we got here.”
Luna and Ginny arrive a short time later. Ginny’s nod to the festive season is a green Holyhead training jersey with some red berries pinned around the neck. Luna, on the other hand, looks like a Christmas centerpiece. The holly earrings she’d fashioned while helping Harry pick flowers, crown a silver dress that shimmers like tinsel, strung with tiny ornaments and jangling with little bells.
, at least, should be able to connect with. He loves his grandmother, of course, but he’s old enough now to have people blunder into telling him stories about his parents and the war. He’s grown up loved and surrounded by people who care about him deeply. But he’s also grown up knowing that he’s different from other children. And not just because he’s a wizard. He’s a Metamorphmagus. His father was a
The worst part is that, oaths of secrecy or not, Harry knows for a fact that Malfoy’s found a way to host the most stuck-up version of a Muggle dinner possible.
Harry is pointed to the Blue Room by a succession of elves who seem to rush in every direction, carrying teetering stacks of silverware and glasses and trailing table runners and floral decorations in their wake.
“Draco, I thought the world would open up after Voldemort. And instead it’s just gotten smaller and smaller. But
“Well, that’s a lot better than on the way up,” Ron says. Hermione gently draws the door to the Room of Requirement closed behind them, and it vanishes back into the stone.
“Lead the way.”
“How can you be so fucking
Harry thinks back to Parkinson breaking the news to them both. The way Draco had immediately asked,
Inside, they find a clutch of envelopes and advertising flyers. Harry takes them out and Ron relocks the door.
She and Neville crouch low and run across the kitchen toward the pantry, the others holding fruit at the ready in case a knife looks like it doesn’t have enough to do.
There’s some mumbling around the table.
“I’m sorry, Potter, it’s my fault.” Harry positively flinches at the use of his last name, but Draco needs the distance, however he can manage it. “I said I could do casual and it turns out I can’t.” No need to tell him that Draco knew from the outset what a giant fucking mistake it was going to be and did it anyway.
Harry’s brain races to catch up. “But … you weren’t there…”
petals were edible?”
Malfoy has a strange expression on his face but it clears quickly. He shuffles some parchment around on his desk and clears his throat. “Yes, but not today. I’m extremely busy, Auror Potter, and your Christmas woes don’t appear to be life-threatening. I’ll meet you at Grimmauld Place first thing tomorrow.”
“You have to
different now. And he finds he wants this with an intensity that catches him by surprise.
Harry beams, dragging him inside by the wrist, like a child excited by Christmas. He shows off every room. The soft, worn-looking leather sofa and matching armchairs. The high skylights over a king-sized bed made up with expensive-looking linen. Everything about it is perfect, and perfectly Harry. From the masculine lines of the black and white bathroom tiles to the rack of brooms lined up in the tidy garden shed.
“What gives you the right to judge?” Hermione says coolly.
“No, seriously Malfoy, what are you doing? It might be okay in your pure-blood circles to carry on this sort of pantomime,” Harry says, finding the edges of his anger again and drawing them in close. “But I don’t understand why you are doing this to Luna. She doesn’t deserve it.”
Talking to Malfoy turns out to be harder than Harry imagined. On his return from Hogwarts, he found Malfoy and Sato’s office empty, and the departmental assistant told him that the whole team were in Manchester dealing with an incident involving the Knight Bus.
Her mouth curls in just the faintest imitation of a smile and Harry feels as though a trap has snapped shut somewhere and he missed it.
“You’re welcome, Harry. They’re just flowers.” She laughs gently. “What are you doing this afternoon?”
Hermione is the one to bring proceedings to a close, taking Hugo up to the stage with her, cradled in her arms.
Instead, Malfoy drew the olive from his martini slowly into his mouth from the pick and eyed Harry up and down in an appraising way.
“Merlin, what is this? You need to put on another jacket.”
“I can hardly believe it,” McGonagall says, staring up at the castle in awe.
With a sinking sensation, he realises that his memories may have worked beautifully for the repair, but they certainly haven’t left him or dulled how he feels.
to evolve, Potter, or it dies.”
“It’s not that,” Cassie says. “I just still can’t see what would draw them here.” She wanders over to the chairs beside Lucius’ desk, poking at one of the cushions with her wand. “Will they take the threat seriously? Will they think to try the room, even if they do?”
“Come on, Hermione,” Neville intercedes, his voice sounding as incredulous as Harry feels. “At the very least Ron needs to use the Portkey. He should be in St Mungo’s, even if we decide to carry on.”
“An employee of the Auror department?” Robards asked, thunderously, his fists still planted stoutly in front of him. “Someone who is required, required, Potter, to follow orders? To do what is asked of him, according to the oath he took when he accepted this position? Pull your head out of your arse for a minute, and listen to why you’ve been assigned to watch him.”
“Er, Malfoy, you’re going to have to be more specific.” Harry had no idea where Malfoy was going with this.
“Thanks, Ron,” Harry said, glumly. “That’s very helpful.”
“I do - I didn’t know you were an artist,” Harry said.
They didn’t have much more to say to each other. Harry didn’t know if there was anything else he could say, but Malfoy stayed next to him, and he stretched his legs out so their feet were touching.
(See the end of the chapter for
Seamus huffed. “If you won’t at least try to understand, then don’t wa- AHHHHHHHHHHHH! TWO BLOODY INCHES SHY.”
“Harry,” he said, taking her hand. He wanted to smile at her, but he thought she’d like it more if he didn’t.
------------------------------
At this, Neville could not help himself, and openly guffawed. Somewhere behind them, Harry could hear Ron bang his head against the wall. He’d hear it from him later, at the pub. Ron was always trying to tell Harry how to play politics in the department. Not that Harry ever listened.
ed his way out of every problem in life (barring more recent problems, naturally), who was too good to have more than one pint with the team, who showed up to team meetings in bloody Oxford shirts with wool pants.
Harry goes to Malfoy Manor.
As he really considered this, Harry was stung by guilt. He wanted to go to Malfoy this minute and tell him that Harry would keep his secret, that he had nothing to be afraid of, and that Harry would leave him well enough alone, if that’s what he wanted.
Gone were his musings from the morning about
Narcissa had the presence of mind not to chuck her oversized straw at Harry’s head, but Harry could tell she dearly wanted to. Harry took another drink from his espresso. It was a double. He felt wired already. “You’re going to support us, or not, doesn’t matter. I’m going to make him happy if I have to drag him kicking and screaming all the way there.”
“No bother,” said Draco, though his tone implied that he was very much bothered.
He grabbed Lauren and arranged their limbs until Harry was fucking her from behind. Her cunt was wet, and he was so desperately hard it felt like he was melting ice cream with a hot poker as he pushed into her. Katherine lay beneath them, and Lauren licked her clit messily.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry took the card in his hand. It was milk white and made of stiff cardstock. Whorls and scrolls of ink danced across it as soon as he touched it, resolving gradually into words. It read, “Black Calligraphy” and it had a telephone number underneath, and stranger still, an actual email address.
Harry had set up a blanket and a warming charm on the edge of the field, by the goal posts, and was just about to doze off from the influence of the beers, when someone spoke from behind him.
Chapter 1
“Maybe Robards has a thing about Death Eaters,” said Ron grimly. “There’s so many that escaped punishment, he could want to make an example of them.”
Honesty was always the best policy in these situations. “I’ve chucked the person I’m dating, and I want a quick shag to forget about it.”
At that age, Harry had point blank refused to allow himself to be used that way, and here he was seven something years later, facing the same treatment and taking it.
Narcissa looked doubtful. “I’m still not entirely sure whether I trust this - what did you call it? Scienriffic… advances?”
Harry sat at the bar, but only ordered drinks for Seamus and Dean. He gave his best impression of looking entirely bored while his friends went out and chatted up girls for him. After about fifteen minutes, they brought one over.
This is the last chapter from Harry's POV. I'm super excited to switch to Draco's POV.
Harry felt faint as all the blood rushed out of his head. He tightened his grip on Malfoy’s hair. He thought back to earlier this week, when he had imagined Malfoy begging. “Do you really think you deserve to suck my cock?”
“You know.”
Harry spent the next day in a hung-over haze. He was aware that his first duty in his assignment was to make contact with Malfoy - Draco, rather, since he was no longer Malfoy, apparently-  and arrange to meet him, so the first thing he did when he finally staggered out of bed was bite the bullet and send an owl off to the Manor.
Draco shook his head. “No, thank you. I have food at home,” and with a switch of his long black robes, he walked past Harry out of the office.
Robards sighed and leaned forward, his closed fists planted on the table. “You’re the only one suited to this, Potter.”
Brilliant, Monday, three o’clock, Ministry of Magic Auror Department. Show the office secretary this letter. Thanks,  HP
, and so Harry had stopped pulling in Wizarding establishments altogether.
. Her voice in his head was the unwelcome tone of reason, now as ever.
He grabbed the file in front of him and made to leave, but he noticed something strange about the name scrawled on top. Malfoy had been crossed out, and in its place was -
“Ah, that will be your frappuccino,” said Harry. Narcissa looked quietly horrified. “Don’t worry, it’s not been poisoned. Pick mine up too, while you’re there.” Harry made a shooing motion with his hands, and Narcissa walked to the counter, looking entirely mystified.
Robards paused to take a breath, and Harry seized his opportunity. “House arrest duty is junior auror training detail, Robards, I’ve earned the right to -”
The very last thing he’s expecting is to be confronted with Draco Malfoy’s naked back. He’s just standing there, damp from the shower with a towel slung low on his hips, and far,
“And no one has
“If it
“Quite,” Draco says, as if he’s unconvinced, but it’s clear that he’s joking. Harry spreads a thick slab of butter on his toast, relieved to have his appetite back.
Quidditch that he cares about. Although he does care about it an awful lot.
“Rubbish,” Harry snaps back. “The Kestrels haven’t been hexing us at all, why would we start now? Just because it’s permitted doesn’t mean—”
"And you think someone's out to get you by making Christmas fail spectacularly in your presence?" Malfoy manages to ask this with only the smallest hint of disbelief in his tone.
Draco wants to explain exactly why that’s a problem, but his mind blanks around the words
“Here you go, Harry,” Molly says, passing him a carton with “Stockings” stencilled neatly on the side. “And here’s a shepherds pie right out of the oven. And if you can wait a while, I have mince ones coming too.”
Hannah says nothing as she concentrates on her spells for another few long minutes before she rocks back on her heels and exhales heavily.
“No, wait! What about the rest! The snowman, and the house lights, and the….” Harry trails off before the word “mistletoe” can escape his lips.
“We should do
. Trust Malfoy to fuck everything up by considering Pansy bloody Parkinson, of all people, a confidante.
“Of course not,” he sighs. “We were just shagging, Pans. We’re not going to be owl pals.” He wishes it didn’t sound so bitter when he says it, like he’s some jilted teen.
A glance at the clock on the wall shows it’s mid-afternoon. Draco can’t believe he slept that long, he’s clearly not well.
“When she was offered the opportunity to take on this role, she didn’t want to come back. Unlike me, she’s never had any interest in returning to England or reestablishing herself here. But she could see that if I could make a go of it, then there’d be no arguing with my moving home. Successful coach of an ancient club at the top of a revitalised League? No one would be paying any attention to my Mark then.”
Harry feels helpless.
It hits him suddenly enough that he sits bolt upright like a cartoon character, the book sliding off his chest. He knows exactly how to solve this problem. In fact, he probably knows how to solve two problems at once.
Harry thinks, with a sinking feeling.
“But why—”
“How’s your friend in St Mungo’s?” Neville asks, slicing off another thick slab of ham and adding it to his plate. Harry loves the Christmas food at Hogwarts. He considers asking Seymour if he can help out all week. It would definitely beat the sausage roll Kreacher served this morning that Harry’s pretty sure had raisins in it. At least he
Harry points at the boxes in disbelief. “What, you want to pretend I can’t see them! They’re sitting right there on your shelf with the sodding
“For Merlin’s sake, get on with it,” Draco said testily, taking his eyes off the ceiling and fixing them on the floor.
And that insight into his psyche, that he might like to dominate Malfoy, sexually. That was disturbing. That was something Voldemort wanted. Lucius. Bellatrix. Dudley. That will to power. That wasn’t a part of Harry.
Hermione would tell him to ignore it. In fairness, Harry knew that this was the rational course of action.
“I like it,” she said. “It’s exhausting. But I like working with people. Lots to do. What about you?”
Narcissa ran her fingers gingerly over the cover. There was a man in a muggle picture with a newborn in his arms. Her lips parted, and the breath she took was heavy and breathless all at once.
“No. Yes. I mean, it doesn’t matter if we have sex. It’s not important. Well, it is. But not as important as the other stuff.”
“Or maybe he’s heard something, but he’s not telling Harry,” said Neville. “It wouldn’t be the first time an Auror wasn’t told everything about the case they were working on. He could be keeping Harry in the dark for a reason.”
The sun cut a clear shaft through the window slats onto Harry’s face, and he blinked as he came back into consciousness. Last night had been. Well.
Instead of looking for the snitch, Harry spent most of the scrimmage coming to the realization that what he thought was a quick hump before the game might have been more than he bargained for. It was only after their reserve seeker made a beeline for the post behind Harry that he got his wits back and managed to (just barely) grab the snitch by doing a neat backflip and catching it with his left hand.
“NARCISSA,” yelled the barista, placing a frozen brown beverage on the counter.
“Or you could hook us up with some tickets to a Quidditch match,” Ron suggested. “Don’t the Magpies have free skyboxes available every week for friends of the team?”
Harry felt two opposing feelings at once - relief that Draco had dropped the “mister” off the front of his name, and irritation that he could be such an incurable snob. “Yes. It is. Let’s get started, if you wouldn’t mind.” He waved the clipboard at him, which said “PROBATIONARY INTERVIEW” in large letters at the top of the form, and gestured towards the room just off the foyer.
Oliver Wood was standing next to Pucey, and he flashed Harry a smile, reached out and knocked him on the shoulder in a friendly sort of way.
------------------------
, Harry thought.
Both of them grinned wide and donned their coats. Hermione rolled her eyes.
“Dawlish,” said Draco. “Did he not hand over my file?”
“I think you’ll like them,” Harry told her, confidently.
While she was speaking, Harry hastily chugged the rest of his beer and downed the shot Neville had put in front of him. He set ten galleons on the table to cover their tab. “I’m going,” he said. “Dean, Seamus, are you coming?”
Draco hummed testily. “I’m sure you’ve been very busy.” His hands were folded patiently in his lap. Harry spared second to notice the excellent black wool robes he wore. For all their darkness, they fell around him as if they weighed not an ounce. A white shirt peaked above their austere buttons, and met the sturdy column of Draco’s neck in a ruffle.
Malfoy turned his face away to look back at the showers. “Yes,” he said in a low tone, his voice catching with an involuntary groan. Harry rubbed his cock even harder up against him, slower now, more deliberate.
He rifled through his messy locker, looking for his gloves. They were hiding under some track pants he’d forgotten were stashed in there, and he was so distracted trying to get them on, it was a solid three minutes before he realized he’d been trying to shove the left glove onto his right hand.
“I’m not saying Draco and I will - we’ve been together for such a short period of time, and we’re young, and he’s - well, you know how he is.”
“No - I…”
“Yes, Ron, but those are for investors or politicians or celebrities. You know. Important people.”
“Shouldn’t be too hard,” said Ron. “He’s probably plotting to smuggle dark artifacts into the country. Or maybe he’s a vampire. Ooh, Harry, I bet that’s what it is, mate. He’s pale enough.”
Neville grinned. “And I’ll help you write the reports if he does deserve it,” he told Harry cheerfully. “It’s odds on he will.”
Robards smirked. “Right. Forgot to tell you. He’s changed his name.”
Naturally, nothing of the sort happened, and Harry had spent the match more and more frantic with his own completely unexpected grief. Nothing could have prepared him for how much this stupid arrangement meant to him, how much he had wagered his feelings on it continuing, or at least not blowing up in his face the way it had.
“Harry.” He pulled out a second chair and put his feet up. “I’ve already ordered for you. Do you like frappuccinos?”
It was there. He was wearing them. Again. Harry pulled off Malfoy’s neck, nearly panting with want, and Malfoy gasped. Harry’s right hand grabbed the shorts and shoved them down. He and Malfoy, together, stared downward.
“That thing is a cravat, and it’s the only neck wear that goes with this style of robes.”
Draco was crying. Two fat tears were streaking through the mess on his face, which bore an expression that was placid and far away.
Please. Harry could hardly manage to process how delicious that sounded. He filed it away for later examination. “Are you going to take the whole thing?”
“I’m not an artist,” said Draco, emphatically. “I illustrate stationary and address wedding invitations. Calligraphy, and doodling. I’m hardly Michelangelo.”
Draco turned his gaze out the window, his arms still crossed. Harry knew, from the look on his face, that the window pane was grimy. Actually, Harry had thought to himself that he ought to have the casings and trim replaced, as they were quite old and cracked in a few places, and let the cold in.
“What’s this?”
“I can’t believe you had the nerve to lecture
“The fifth of June.”
“Come back with me to my flat.”
about loyalty, and then go off and fuck two perfect strangers.”
Ron rolled his eyes and turned his attention back to the football. “Can’t we watch something else? They hardly ever score in this game.”
One minute, Harry was trying to think what to say next, and the next, he’d pushed Malfoy up against the lockers. For a split second, Malfoy stiffened like he was sure he was going to be attacked, but then Harry put his mouth on the crook between Malfoy’s neck and
But what reason would Malfoy have to believe him? All through school, they’d antagonized each other, and made each other’s lives hell. Harry had testified against Malfoy’s father. What if Harry went to apologize, and Malfoy thought he was pressuring him, or bothering him, or threatening him just by bringing up the possibility of outing him?
Draco’s breath caught. His hands went still.
But underneath that was a voice whispering that he wasn’t ignoring Malfoy because it was the noble course of action.
Harry slammed his empty pint onto the table. “Yes, and that’s exactly why we’re all trying to get him demoted, and me appointed,” he said. “The Auror office is full of corruption, and those practices give people a place to hide their intentions. We’re a team. We have enough of a job fighting dark wizards and evil people without keeping secrets and -”
“Are you sure he agrees that is the case?”
Harry couldn’t stand the feeling that crawled across his skin, just thinking about Draco with another man. He shoved it down. He shoved it down, he thanked the girls for an excellent evening, he took them to the shop and bought them both coffees, and then he walked down the road to the practice facility, where he lost his late morning and early afternoon to the rowing machine.
Harry shook his head in frustration. “You - yes, you do, the manor has house elves, and those have to be registered on your forms,” he said.
Draco sighed. “At an ancestral property belonging to my family.”
Harry scoffed. “What was I supposed to do, take a vow of chastity?”
That was enough for Harry. His overstimulated dick followed with cum of its own, and Harry put his hand around it, pumping the mess onto the front of Malfoy’s white knickers, which were dirtied and torn a bit from the rough treatment.
Robards leaned forward again, his knuckles cracking on the table under the not inconsiderable weight of his frame. “Auror Potter. Draco Malfoy will report to you for probation for a period of one year. You will surveil his house, his movements, and his communications. You will inform me of any suspicious activity, and you will build a case to put him in Azkaban, where he belongs. Is that clear?”
Harry felt a moment of actual sympathy for Draco. “Mine didn’t make it through the war either. My owl, that is,” Harry said. “Hedwig.”
Narcissa seemed to consider this. She took a tentative sip up her frappuccino, screwed up her face a minute, reconsidered, and took another sip.
“Don’t look so horrified, Potter. If a muggle takes the card, the letters don’t dance on it. It’s only enchanted for wizards.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake. No, Pucey, I didn’t fuck them in the team showers.”
Draco came quickly, grunting and sighing like a small animal. When he had finished, Harry cleaned him up with a tissue on the bedside. When they played like this, Harry never came, even though he felt like he wanted to hump himself furiously into Draco’s leg until he spilled into his trousers, or whatever else he was wearing.
Thank you for your owl. Yes, I would also like to meet with you as soon as possible. My solicitor informs me that the meeting must occur within seven days of being released from house arrest, which I believe is this coming Saturday. I am, therefore, at your disposal any day of this week, at any time.
“I assume you know what it means to draw?” Draco asked him, sharply.
Could he ask such a thing of Malfoy? Was Malfoy even gay? And if so, was he interested in Harry? And if he was interested in Harry, was it fair for Harry, with their inequalities of status, and the life debt Malfoy owed him, to ask Malfoy to…
Malfoy complied immediately,  methodically undoing every button on his robes, starting from the neck and working his way downward. By the time he got down to his groin, Harry could see that the black lace had made a reappearance, and he watched as Malfoy slowly revealed himself to him, inch by inch. Malfoy shuddered as he shrugged off the robes, folded them neatly on the circular table in the entryway, and walked over to the couch, his erect penis straining at the fabric, his testicles falling out the sides of it.
At this, Draco appeared incensed. “You know bloody well we’ve no domestic servants, Potter.”
Malfoy finally turned his head and looked at him, and quirked a smile. “Because you saw me. In. You know.”
Harry walked him backwards towards the bed. “Do you need me to help you with that?”
But Hermione deserved to wear it. She was the greatest warrior of them all. Harry watched her as she stood on the altar. She said her vows crisp and perfect. This slight woman had carried them all through the war. Harry and Ron had gotten their hands messy, but the heavy lifting, the strategy, the weight of everything had fallen on her rather tiny shoulders, and she had borne it with the grace of a dancer.
“Still. Draco is gay, and he’s your son, and he’s perfectly capable of having children even if he doesn’t marry a woman, if that’s what he wants.” Harry let the smile drop off his face. “And you will support him and love him just as he is, regardless. No more trying to force him to marry someone he doesn’t love.”
Malfoy buried his head back into his knees. “Yes.”
Draco stared hard at him for a moment. Now that the fervor of their coupling had passed, Harry was sure Draco would curse him, or hit him, or both, for what he was asking. But Draco tucked his chin down into the barest of nods.
“It’s still - it’s unfair Robards - oh, don’t give me that -” Harry had caught Robard’s rather dramatic eye roll. “I’m not being entitled. I caught Greyback wandless, for fuck’s sake, I’m better than the other aurors and you know it, stop treating me like -”
been in Knockturn Alley. That photographer had the good fortune of selling a photo to the newspaper of Harry with two very pretty young mediwitches leaving the nightclub, looking at once both wolfish and apathetic.
The Monday morning team meeting had gone on for two hours already, and most of the team members were fidgeting in their chairs or engaging in the practiced art of yawning with one’s mouth closed. Clarence Nelson, the team owner, had droned on interminably about the team’s finances, marketing opportunities, and future sponsorship obligations, none of which Harry cared a whit about. He turned up whenever the team administrative assistant told him to turn up, and smiled for the cameras that pointed his direction, and let the press secretary release statements for him about this or that charitable endeavor.
Ron stared at him dumbly. “Mate,
To make matters worse, one of the chasers had a shoulder injury, and Draco was starting. Harry would be forced to try and ignore him the whole game, which was a near impossibility. Draco’s hair was tied differently, half of it up in a topknot, the rest flowing loose down his back, rounding past his sharp cheekbones and cupping his shoulders, right where Harry would like to grab him and give him a good shake.
. People could always read Harry’s body language somehow, and Malfoy must be on alert for any sign of Harry acting strangely, after how terrified he had been in the locker room. He knew he should stop looking, should put his feet back together and will his dick to relax, but between the sheer boredom of the meeting and the way the faint blush was now reaching the tops of Draco’s ears, Harry was driven to distraction.
“Secret boyfriend.” Seamus said, smirking.
---------------------------------
Pulling at the bar had made things worse, not better. For one thing, he hardly knew Emily, and though she had been wearing panties, Harry had fucked many (well… several) women wearing panties before. That wasn’t what was really at the root of all this, then, was it?
Seamus shook his head, and Harry chuckled. They spent the rest of the evening companionably, Ron and Seamus tucking into the chips with gleeful abandon and getting more and more tired from their pints. Harry asked after Hermione, and Ron told him there was nothing much to say except that she was chronically exhausted. She was looking after her parents, who were recovering from the not inconsiderable spell damage she’d left them with in her attempts to protect them from Voldemort, and attending law school part time while she clerked for the Wizengamot.  After four rounds, it was late evening and they were ready to take off.
He and Emily had talked for all of thirty minutes before it became abundantly clear that they were both after the same thing, and they left the bar to kiss and fool around a bit in the alleyway. She led him back to her flat, and within five minutes Harry was face to face with just what he was looking for.
Harry stared from the card up to Draco, then back down at the card, then back up to Draco. Then he looked down at the card again, and a funny noise happened in the back of his throat, sort of like the noise a blender would make, but only if it was broken.
The reality was, he did find it interesting. And his first plan of action, finding a girl to roll around with, didn’t solve anything for him. He was going to have to find something else to do.
Harry woke up in his own bed the next morning, alone. He’d spent a few hours at Emily’s and then shown himself the door.
Harry shook his head and tried to read the elaborate writing.
Harry sighed. At least he’d get his locker sorted now; it had been a mess for some time. He was just about done stripping off the last of his pads. He scooped them into a pile and turned around.
This… thing. Whatever it was. With Malfoy. It had to stop. Rather, Harry had to stop. All the thoughts he’d had before, when his cock wasn’t doing the thinking for him, about how it was wrong to approach Malfoy, came rushing back.
wearing the panties. Malfoy, who treated all his friends like shit, who’d broken his nose, who
“Then it’s none of your concern,” Draco said flatly.
Harry felt himself smiling unexpectedly. “Alright, then.” He picked up a biro from the table in front of him. “I have some questions for you, and I’m sorry if you already answered them for the Auror in charge of your house arrest -”
Every pair of eyes in the locker room turned, at once, to see Draco Malfoy clutching his knickers. “Those are mine,” Draco said simply, his voice steady. Harry was astonished to see that he wasn’t shaking, not even a little. This was not at all the romantic, Quidditch match declaration Harry had been hoping for an hour ago.
Malfoy’s eyes flew to Harry’s, and he looked for a moment as if he couldn’t speak, couldn’t get the words out, couldn’t possibly tell Harry all the things he wanted. “I want to suck your cock, sir,” he finally managed.
, Malfoy, and fuck your cowardly family. Come talk to me if you grow enough of a spine to stand beside me out there,” Harry gestured to the stands, and turned on his heel and walked out.
He shoved his own shorts down as well, so he could feel the lace on his foreskin as he rutted erratically against Malfoy’s hard prick. Malfoy was making low noises that sounded like he was enjoying what Harry was doing, but his eyes were looking away, and he was still blushing like he was terribly embarrassed.
“That’s right.” Harry started a slow wank with one hand, pressing Draco’s hips into the mattress with the other. “It’s good to feel sexual, isn’t it?”
------------------------
“Wiltshire.”
Thanks for reading. Your comments have meant the world to me - I've been too shy to respond to them, but I've resolved to respond to the comments on the last chapter, every one of them.
“I’d heard that,” Draco said. He didn’t say he was sorry, or that he knew how Harry must feel. Harry felt unexpectedly grateful to him. He looked back down at the form, which had turned a bit blurry. Harry blinked twice, and it became clear again.
“Shit,” he said, standing up; realizing he was barefoot, he pulled on a pair of trainers and made his way to the door.
--------------------------
Draco bit out a cry. Harry rubbed his free hand up and down Draco's thigh. “I’m sorry it took me so long to notice. Your cock needs to be wanked so much, doesn’t it?”
Harry conceded the point with a shrug. He and Malfoy lapsed into silence again. Minutes passed. The others on the field were singing songs and throwing conjured wood onto the fire. Harry had no idea where this conversation was going next, if it was going anywhere at all, and so he said nothing. But Malfoy was doing that thing with his mouth again, opening it and then shutting it, like he wanted to say something and thought better of it.
“Potter’s been fucking you in the showers? While you’ve been wearing -”
Draco nodded carefully. “It is.”
Narcissa stared at him for a full beat. “I haven’t the faintest idea what that could be.”
Once they arrived back at his flat in Scotland, the next three hours passed in a blur. There were four tits,
Harry nodded at him. “Draco,” he said, the given name unfamiliar in his mouth. He realized he was standing in the doorway, and shifted backward, awkwardly. “Come in. Just through here - the sitting room.”
Harry glanced around, making sure they weren’t within hearing distance of one of Robard’s cronies. They liked to frequent the Leaky after work. “It’s not classified. Not officially. Robards wants me to dig up dirt on Malfoy.”
Warnings: There are discussions of anorexia, suicide, self-harm, and a bit of gore.
Harry never knew what to say to that. “Okay,” he said. “Can I buy you a drink?”
“I’m a mediwitch,” she said. “Third year.”
“I hate to say it, Harry, but I’m not surprised,” Ron said, taking a swig of his butterbeer.
“I can’t make another appointment until Friday,” Harry said. “Hearings.”
“Yes. I saw you get into the shower yesterday.” He paused for a beat. Malfoy’s eyes were the deepest shade of grey. “I saw what you had on.”
Draco had an email address.
Harry didn’t have Draco’s file with him - it was still at his desk at the ministry - so he put some parchment on a spare clipboard and tried to remember what was on the form of questions he was meant to ask at their initial meeting. He had done parole interviews before during his first year out of training, and it wasn’t difficult, but it was an awful lot of work transcribing it all afresh, with the result that he didn’t have time to shower or change into his Auror robes before he heard the doorbell go in the front hall.
Harry and Draco had come in from practice last week. They’d fucked in the showers.
Someone cast
He turned back to Draco. He was still sitting on the couch, watching Harry, and one tear dropped off his chin.
This chapter begins with Draco's backstory, many years before the first chapter. I hate when fanfic writers overly linger on past events, so don't worry - I'll get you caught up quick. A huge amount of this chapter will be filling you in on all the things Harry didn't understand from the first three chapters. I hope you enjoy all the easter eggs I've left in this chapter!
“Robards, Malfoy isn’t a dark wizard. If he was a dark wizard, I wouldn’t have spoken for him. He’s a total pillock,” Harry said, “but I highly doubt he’ll commit crimes once he’s been released from the Manor.”
Malfoy’s breathing was hitched and rapid now. “Please, sir. Please let me suck it.” He was nearly frantic, but he didn’t move to touch Harry. “Give me permission. I’ll be so good. Please.”
“What about income? I assume your properties - “
Malfoy cleared his throat. “Did you.” It wasn’t a question.
Draco made a conciliatory motion with his chin and walked through to the sitting room, at which point Harry could see he barely repressed a shudder of revulsion at the dusty sofas. He spent a solid minute - actually spent sixty full seconds - taking in each option for sitting, finally selecting a rigid wooden chair Harry had shoved into a corner. He plucked it up by an arm and hauled it to the center of the room, across from the chaise lounge.
Enticements: There's a tiny bit of sex in this.
exactly he found Malfoy’s clothing so fascinating, and all he could think about was what he was going to do when they were all dismissed. His options.
“Ron, we’ve talked about this. We don’t bring up war stories in mixed company.” She nodded in Seamus and Dean’s direction, who were both looking decidedly pale and as if they were trying and failing to avoid looking at her forearm. “It puts people off their night out,” she said, as if she were reminding him to put out the crumpets for tea time. She turned to Harry. “Can you tell me what happened, Harry? Only, it seemed -”
It was written in the most beautiful script he had ever seen. The black ink was stark against the flawless paper, and every letter curled precisely into the next, the ends of words caressing the empty space beside them with sweeping curlicues. But Harry had sent his letter not fifteen minutes before, which meant Malfoy had produced this script in less than a quarter of an hour.
“That’s what you’re paid to find out, Potter.”
“Something tells me Ron won’t care whether this thing is a few inches loose,” Harry replied, tugging at the fabric.
, he thought to himself, even though they weren’t black. They were hot pink, a small disappointment quickly overcome once Harry realized they had the same thong shape he’d seen on Malfoy the night before.
“Precisely,” said Ron. “And he’s looking a bit down in the mouth about it. We’re his mates, and we’re going to cheer him up.”
Like blood from a fucking stone. “So - Malfoy Manor?”
He’s not there on Tuesday, either, and Harry starts to worry a little. He’s never asked Fleamont where his other frames might be. His grandfather’s only ever talked about this frame being in the vault, and then a “ruin.” Still, Harry figures some oil paint can’t have gotten itself into too much trouble.
He’s standing slightly behind Hermione, as if she’s assured him she’s going to fight this battle solo. Or maybe that’s just his default posture: coward.
The back of Draco’s neck is hot. He can smell the sulphur of the Fiendfyre. He can feel a sharp pain across his chest, where the

“And Neville?” Hermione says, rushing over to the couch as if she can pick up his arm and solve the mystery.
“Not if you don’t mean it,” he frowns, sinking back into an armchair, picking at the label on his water bottle.
In the email folder they find lots of ordinary correspondence pointing to a rich Muggle life Harry is frustrated to no longer remember. Promotions from a gym he apparently belongs to. Newsletters from the Muggle charity he supports. Endless little emails back and forth with Draco’s university email address: making plans for dinners, asking him to pick up shopping, suggesting weekends away.
“Is this some kind of practical joke? Did you two have some sort of Slytherin class reunion and cook this up?” They probably had a great laugh, predicting Harry’s reaction—first to Parkinson’s arrival, and now this.
He supposes he could just go up to the bullpen and ask around until he finds which of his useless colleagues were involved, but he wants the file first. He needs the upper hand.
Hermione looks around at the others in turn, even reaching out to squeeze Draco’s arm briefly. “Honestly, Professor. I had a lot of help.”
Draco slips back up the stairs quickly and lets himself out the front door, Apparating away before he can be seen.
“Should we go again, to make sure?” Malfoy asks.
“Hello,” she says with a smile.
“Let’s go back and get Ron,” Luna suggests, ever the diplomat. “We can see what he’d like to do, and if we decide to leave, we need him here anyway to come with us.”
Eventually his breathing evens out, and Harry falls asleep listening to him.
“Oops, it’s upstairs, hang on.” Teddy goes to get it as Draco rummages around in the bag some more, making sure his pencil case and P.E. gear are there. He looks up to find Potter staring at him again, with an appraising smile.
Harry laughs, looking down at himself. “I was here for dinner last night.”
Parkinson remains silent, but she glances back and forth between Harry and Draco, as if trying to size them up while planning her next move.
“Don’t make me blast this in, ferret,” he hears from the other side, and his heart sinks as drags himself from the bed and crosses the room to open it.
But time had passed, and it had apparently been extremely good to Draco Malfoy, who looked fitter than he had any right to. Looking back now, Harry’s not sure what possessed him to proposition Malfoy. Harry supposes he just wanted to see a look of shock on that flawless face.
She sighs. “We’re actually investigating an anonymous tip-off this morning, but it’s probably nothing.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco snorts. “We’re playing one of these teams in two weeks, and we need all the information we can get. Pans offered to get us into one of the boxes, but I thought if you saw Allsop you’d probably hex him blind, so I’ve just bought us seats in the stands.”
“We’re all in one piece,” Draco says softly, which is only sort of reassuring. “Let’s get out of here.”
Harry bites his lip before an ‘

“Terribly old-fashioned,” Luna says with a smile. “I never had any trouble visiting my girlfriends.”

She fetches her cloak, and gives Harry a quick hug as she leaves.
“Awful?” Harry tries to think back two months to before he left and it’s hard. He feels like he’s lived an entire lifetime in the intervening weeks.
Draco barks out a laugh, but it sounds thick. Choked up.
a member of a European royal family. She’d actually been a minor duchess from Luxembourg, and was only a quarter Veela on her mother’s side, but Pansy’s exaggerations continue to assure him the very best guests with the very deepest pockets.
“Better,” Draco acknowledges, drawing the hat off his head and tossing it onto his desk. He looks at Harry expectantly.
For a second, Harry’s misled into thinking that the roof above him has entirely collapsed, which doesn’t make any sense because he remembers the Hall after the battle. He remembers it full of people. He doesn’t remember it like this.
She gives him a wry grin. “You sounded sixteen years old again all of a sudden.”
Harry knows Hermione will contact him once she has more information. He
“Don’t start anything you can’t finish,” Draco warns as he turns in Harry’s arms.
Malfoy seems to be avoiding Harry completely after their row, which suits him just fine. If they didn’t both want to attend matches, Harry could probably pretend he didn’t exist at all.
“Potter, every single person we work with tolerates me only because I am
Once again, when they open the door, the room inside is dark. This time they’re even more cautious as they venture in, but the torches illuminate nothing until the door snicks closed.
“We definitely do,” Neville insists.
, but obviously the latter wins out.
“What the fuck are you doing here?”
He’d thought it would insult Malfoy — goad him into a fight, maybe. Provide an excuse to spar the way they had when they were young.
“I’m sorry?” he asks, trying not to let curiosity get the better of him. Make it seem like he just hadn’t heard properly.
He’d kept a few bits and pieces of furniture. Some things, like the long kitchen table, for sentimental reasons. Others, simply because the thought of having to make decisions about replacing everything was more than he could bear. The Aurors had swept the place for Dark Magic and spirited off a number of suspicious-looking books and Black family heirlooms. Harry banished the rest up to the attic to sort on a rainy day. And it wasn’t as if London didn’t have plenty of those, but he always seemed to have a backlog of paperwork to catch up on, or a lead he needed to chase down. The house just hadn’t been a priority. Yet.
“On the seventh floor?” Harry asks with a frown. “Wouldn’t it have been down in the foundations somewhere? A cornerstone or something?”
“That’s not true—” Hermione ventures.
He runs his shower extra hot to warm up a little, and wraps his fingers around a mug of coffee as he gathers his paperwork and searches for a thicker winter scarf. In the sitting room, the advent calendar seems particularly bright against the dim walls and towering spruce. Harry realises he didn’t open the door marked for yesterday and he finds it sticks a little in its frame. He gives it a particularly strong tug and it finally pops free. The picture inside is of a couple ice-skating on a little pond surrounded by trees. Harry supposes it’s meant to be festive, but honestly it looks a little sinister. The trees sort of lean in toward the skaters and the forest seems dark and threatening, unlike the previous scenes. Although when Harry glances back at doors one and two, both of the sketches are not quite as cheery as he remembers, either. The wreath seems to have spider webs on it, and a couple of the Christmas cards appear to have fallen over on the tiny, little mantle. He’s sure they didn’t look like that a couple of days ago, but it’s true that he opened them late in the day. Maybe his one shining bright spot of a festive decoration isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be after all. Harry sighs and resolves to go to  ‘Wheezes on his lunch break and buy some new, cheerier things. George had been bragging at lunch on the weekend about now stocking candy canes as big as his arm.
It’ll be worth it.
“You alright, Harry?” she asks. “We’re done for the year. All that’s left is for you to drink too much firewhisky and moon at me about how
Harry is shocked. Nigel only swears when he’s really at the end of his rope.
,” sighs Luna happily. And Harry’s forced to admit that she’s right.
And now…
about Ron while he’s away either.” Harry opens his mouth to crack a dirty joke in response but stops himself. There’s something delicate about this relaxed afternoon with his old friends that he doesn’t want to spoil.
“What an excruciating nightmare,” she complains, reaching for the gin Ron is already passing her. “I don’t know why people think that an end of year function reduces us all to children wanting to play party games and wear silly hats.”
weakening as he moves away from them.
“Where’s…?” Ron trails off around a mouthful of pilfered Yorkshire pudding.
Before Potter can respond, the child in question is looping swift circles around the pair of them, cackling like a mad thing.
“Tugging me out of harm’s way once doesn’t exactly prove otherwise,” he scoffs instead.
“That’s great, Banny, thank you,” Harry sighs in relief, and gets up to follow the creature through the corridors and past the kitchens. Eventually the carpet gives way to stone underfoot and then they’re at a back set of doors, a mudroom, and what looks like a large set of storage pantries. Baskets of onions and potatoes sit stacked alongside Wellington boots and racks of coats. Banny opens a back door and goes outside. Harry keeps pace.
It goes on for so long that Harry’s finally about to say something when the goblin nudges his glasses up his nose, shuffles the papers into a neat pile, and clasps his hands together as he looks at Harry. “Thank you, Mister Potter. That will be all.”
“Tell me you’ve fixed it. Here, just the two of us. Be honest with me.”
The thing is, he
“Look, it’s one thing to learn a bit of poetry at school,” Hermione quickly regathers her composure. “But the diary has nuance. It’s more difficult to understand.”
“Tempting,” Draco smiles, “but no. She had another proposal to discuss with me. One that I think might be of interest to you.”
“Well that’s an odd little kink. Perhaps you could find an actual barrister to shag.”
At the same time, Harry had been grinding through the long hours of Auror training in a kind of perfunctory way. He enjoyed duelling practice, and what little time they got in the field as supervised trainees. But the rest of it was dull beyond belief. Endless regulations they were supposed to memorise. History lessons and procedural tutorials. Tediously poring over decades-old cold cases that would never be solved. Harry wasn’t sure what he’d imagined the DMLE would be like, but the idea he’d had in his head was considerably more exciting than the reality turned out to be.
Draco turns back to fiddle with the socks in his drawer and waits until he hears the woosh of the Floo before letting out a shaky breath.
A look of understanding crosses Potter’s face. “I’m sorry for your loss.”
“Sit, sit,” he insists, waving at a pair of mismatched chairs on the other side of his desk. “Gasnard, you don’t need to stick around for this.”
“What is the spell, Draco?” Luna asks.
They walk back in silence down the corridor. In the distance he can still hear Luna.
She taps her wand to his signature and it lights up briefly before the parchment rolls itself tightly and she tucks it back in her bag.
“I guess I’ll be at the hospital,” he finishes, leaving before he has to think about it any more.
Potter’s owl arrives late that evening, after Teddy’s gone to bed in his room in Draco’s flat.
, Harry thinks, lost in memory for a moment.
“Focus, Harry,” Draco murmurs, kissing Harry’s neck in a way that causes him to immediately forget the rest of the question.
Harry lifts the frame out and props it against the coffee table. He opens a door at random and is a little disappointed to find nothing inside, before laughing at himself. Even if it were magically stocked, he’s not sure he’d want to eat whatever chocolate a hundred-year-old calendar produced. Still, it’s beautiful to look at: ornately carved around the edges with little glass windows for candles.  He casts bluebell flames into them and it gives the whole thing a lovely festive glow.
Harry thinks about the empty portraits, the awful rigidity of the frozen stairs. He glares at Malfoy as if this is somehow his fault. Some part of it must be, surely. Malfoy just arches one pale eyebrow back at him like an unspoken question. Harry feels his face get hot.
? Will someone take me to the vault now?”
Weasley sighs.
“You’re suspended, of course. Robards doesn’t want you back until the new year.”

cologne, so it can’t be that he smells him coming, can it? He gives a surreptitious sniff in the direction of his armpit but learns nothing.
“Some of it is straightforward. Things I find in my flat that I don’t recognise and don’t have an explanation for. The photo slip. This.” He plucks at the t-shirt he’s wearing. Malfoy leans forward and rests his elbows on his knees, head dropping and his hair falling forward like a curtain. It suits him, soft and without all the potions he used to smear in it as a child. Harry finds himself fighting an irrational urge to reach out and tuck it behind his ear.
Draco is sitting in a rocking chair at the far end of the room, staring out at the garden. He doesn’t acknowledge Harry’s arrival, but Harry sees his shoulders tense a little as his presence registers.
He flushes, shaking his head.
When they leave, the house feels deflated, as if the lively energy of the last few weeks has come to an abrupt end. All the late-night meetings, the endless plans mapped out on parchment and scrapped. The practiced spells. It’s all done now. Nothing left but the stale heat of a summer evening where the air doesn’t move freely enough. Harry’s shirt sticks to his back uncomfortably.

But even with his mugshot no longer blinking at Harry from the crowded wall at Auror Headquarters, Malfoy hadn’t returned to Britain.

“We’re just trying to find out what happened. Surely you want that as much as we do,” Cassie says diplomatically, handing back the wand. Parkinson rolls her eyes, as if the Auror is completely beneath her.
“I fell asleep. I woke up a few hours later when Malfoy… Draco, arrived in my room.”
He picks his way around some stacks of paper and books to get to his desk. He figures he can probably find some way to get Malfoy to tell him how Belle is doing if he can just… Well, that pile was probably always going to fall over, at some point. Now it gives him a reason to sort it out.
“The principles remain the same. I have to get him to understand that he’s in a dream. But instead of
Neville went back to Hogwarts after the War and never left, working on the repairs to the castle and then apprenticing to Professor Sprout. Anytime Harry sees him now he has dirt wedged deep under his fingernails and a beatific smile on his face. He once told Harry in a dark moment, too far in his cups, that he felt like he’d achieved everything he needed to in his life and had the right to do nothing more than hang out with plants if he wanted to. He said it in a way that suggested Harry might feel the same, but it left a rancid taste in Harry’s mouth.
There’s something in Harry that wants to yank him back, shove him into a wall even. Demand answers about where he’s been and what he’s been doing and why he thinks he has any
“Muggles cover diaries in fur?” Ron asks, puzzled.
It’s nice, really. To just sit and read. Harry hardly ever sits still for anything. Some of the old-fashioned words are a little confusing, but he asks Belle’s forgiveness and says that when she wakes up they can look up what they mean together. Before he knows it, the soft chime sounds announcing four p.m. Harry closes the book, and shuts Belle’s door quietly on the way out.
to help.” He seems to run out of steam then, hanging his head a little as he mumbles. “I do want to help...with the charity. If you’ll let me.”
The kiss becomes more heated, and Harry slides his hands under Draco’s shirt, seeking out his waistband. Draco extricates himself gently, holding Harry back by his biceps. His cheeks are pink and he’s smiling and Harry’s pretty sure no one has ever looked so devastatingly attractive. He tries to lean in again, but Draco continues to hold him at arm’s length with a laugh.
Draco’s an absolute roiling mess of emotion watching the pair of them. Teddy’s asked every conceivable question about the train and the platform and his first day at school over the last few months, but he still clutches the handle of the trolley nervously as he nods at what Harry’s telling him, and Draco desperately wants to comfort him.
Sometimes when he’s at the school he Floos down to have lunch with Hermione, who is now back at work at the Wizengamot. And other trips he has coffee with Luna and listens to her travel tales. He catches one of Ginny’s home games at the stadium near Manchester, but he skips the opening of Dean’s art exhibition. Teddy takes to using Sirius’s mirror to talk to him, though Harry figures that’s probably at Andromeda’s insistence.
Luna casts flamboyantly, all of her personality writ large in her wand movements. Nothing at all like the precise, constrained motions of the Healers Harry’s used to seeing. The diagnostic traces spread across Malfoy’s skin and dance back to her wand.  She turns and does the same to Harry.
“Could be anyone’s,” Hannah cautions. “Kids have been sneaking up here for years.”
“Well, I was right,” she snaps back. “I was speaking from
Draco scoffs at him, flicking his wand at the broom. The charm ends and the weights crash to the floor with a noisy clatter.
Malfoy freezes, his pale features somehow even paler.
“Present.”
is, we’re only going to win games when we’re good at the
“I should go,” Potter says finally. “Ron is back, and I’m braving dinner at their place.”
Hermione leaves off her lectures after Harry throws a particularly epic tantrum at the Burrow on Christmas Eve, which has everyone walking on eggshells around him. He feels a bit shamefaced about it and stumbles out an apology to Molly the next day. It’s not that he doesn’t know he’s out of line, it’s more that he’s spent his entire life being told what to do and he doesn’t need any more of it. So Grimmauld Place stays dank and quiet, and his friends visit less and less. They have studies to concentrate on, and jobs to go to, and Harry doesn’t have much of either.
He reaches out to help Ron straighten a clutch of the canes, but Ron slaps his hand away. “Careful, what are you doing? You don’t have gloves on.”
When Draco was little, she’d let him have a spare one to play with, and he would try so hard to write as neatly as she did, practising carefully with his quill on a scrap of parchment first so as not to mess it up.
. It’s sort of complicated.”
“Why don’t you start at the beginning, Luna?” Ginny asks. “We haven’t had a chance to hear the whole story from you yet. How you two got together; how Malfoy proposed.”
“I don’t understand, Harry,” his painted grandfather goes on, with a gentle, diplomatic tone. “Have you fallen on hard times in some way? Is the fortune lost?”
Harry’s mouth falls open in shock, but before he can work out how to wrap his mind around Hermione’s words, they’re interrupted again by a much more insistent cry from upstairs that doesn’t die down. Hermione looks at the clock. “I need to feed him, I’m sorry.”
Harry clenches his fist and releases it repeatedly as he tries to think of what to say in response, but he pauses a beat too long and suddenly the team is back on the ground again, chatting animatedly around them about the last pattern flown. Harry chooses to throw himself into that discussion instead.
and his bloody cardigans, I reckon I wouldn’t have been far behind.” He laughs. “Even Mum keeps asking about when you’re going to bring him to family lunch.”
“Carols,” he says glumly.
“She sent a polite owl. It was a bit non-committal, but it wasn’t a ‘no’. I hope she’ll agree,” Hermione replies. “She’s not a warm woman,” she adds, diplomatically. “But I don’t think she wants any more suffering, as much as she loved Lucius. Maybe even because she loved him.”
to get him to calm down.
Ron and Hermione don’t often talk about the Saviour’s abrupt departure from their shores, but over the years Draco has pieced a little of it together.
“Well, I’m done,” he says, closing his computer. “Come on, slug. We’ll meet Beely at my flat and give her the guestlist and then I’ll shout you dinner at that Iranian place you like. I was supposed to go with Pansy but she’s been sick with the flu all week.”
Still. The timing is bloody suspicious.
“Wiimote!” cries Teddy, eyeing the box. “Draco, this is so cool.”
Harry shrugs. “Uneventful.” He doesn’t think Hermione needs to hear about his run-in with Malfoy. It’s not as if he has new information for her about Luna or her motives. “Ron won. Didn’t think much of it, really. I’ve had enough of running through woods casting spells to last a lifetime.”
She shrugs as she holds out the hairbrush for him to take.
“This is fantastic,” Harry enthuses, clapping his icy hands together to warm them up. “What’s next?”
suddenly hellbent on throwing yourself headfirst into danger when you’ve never had the slightest inclination to before now?”
“My godfather is a giant dog, and my dad is a stag. But I think it would be cool to be able to fly.”
Malfoy doesn’t break his—ridiculously long—stride, and Harry is forced into an awkward trot to keep up.
“You don’t need to digest the details in full today, you can take these away with you. The changes are all aimed at making games shorter, higher scoring, and much more exciting to watch. Limited game times, the introduction of permitted magic on brooms, and the ability for players to cast in flight are the key differences.”
They climb the wooden stairs to the Gryffindor stands and Draco takes a seat beside Potter, who doesn’t seem fazed even though Draco’s clearly in Slytherin robes. Weasley is on his other side, but doesn’t pay Draco any attention. It’s not unusual for other people in dreams to be almost like movie extras without lines, making the scene more realistic to the dreamer but not fully realised. Draco’s grateful, in this case. It’s one less complication to deal with.
“The thing is…” Balham says, for the third time, wiping at his brow with the back of his hand. Harry feels a twinge of guilt, like he should leap in and finish the man’s sentence for him. Maybe put them both out of their misery.
“I mean, it was almost a gentle repellent, right?” Hermione continues, oblivious to the conversation around her. “Like just tipping us back into the lake each time. It didn’t seem to be actually fighting us. That’s got to be a good sign.”
“That’s funny,” Hermione snorts, clearly delighted by something he’s said.
Harry chuckles, pressing a soft kiss to Draco’s forehead, one palm coasting gently down his spine. Draco suddenly wants to see it all. Every board Harry has sanded. Every nail that went in crooked. All the things he’s repaired, and painted, and brought back to life with the hands that are now holding Draco. He sits up, tugging Harry up with him.
“Mind clueing the rest of us in, Malfoy?” Harry snaps, annoyed. He tugs the scratchy scarf off his face and tosses it onto an armchair.
When he gets to St Mungo’s he realises he’s forgotten his copy of
Harry manages to catch Hermione’s eye and gesture toward the lake’s edge. She joins him for a stroll.
They all go back to Andromeda’s house for pizza, and an enthusiastic retelling of every aspect of the play as if they haven’t all just sat through it. Harry bounces Hugo on his knee and recounts his mad encounter with the post that morning to Hermione.
“I’m so angry at her,” Harry confesses into the half-dark, deciding to change the subject.
Maxwell seems tired and discouraged, but Draco just waves him up to join him. “You can, come on.”
Harry’s brain feels like it’s short-circuiting, but this seems too important.  “I don’t want to…”
It’s not that he doesn’t

godfather, Sirius Black, and mine used to belong to my father. This way, when I go home to America soon, you’ll still be able to talk to me.”
Draco pauses for a second, taking a slow breath in as if he’s trying to summon patience, or calm.
Bellatrix lifts her own wand. “Shall we begin, Mudblood?”
The rings are what got him into this mess. Maybe the rings can get him out.
interests.” Harry goes so far as to brave a wink along with his smirk.
Harry laughs, walking back with him to the truck to fetch another beam. And then another one. Jack tells him about the plans for the tiny family chapel. How they’re trying to restore it to its simple, original state, rather than anything too fussy. Shows Harry his sketches, explaining his plans for the timber.
is a word that would ever suffice. He glances at Malfoy, who levels an impassive stare at him in return.
Harry asks the three of them what they think he should do. Or rather, he spends probably a little too long articulating how annoying Draco is, and then tells them about Leila, and then insists the whole thing is a waste of time.
“We’ve got to tell Dawlish, mate,” Ron says with a sigh. “If someone is out there passing themselves off as you; faking your ID? Well, that’s a real problem.”
Prompt Eighteen:
blah blah. Couldn’t even hold down his first job.”
Harry frowns at him.
“It’s a curse,” Harry muttered to himself. Malfoy might be good at his job, but he’d missed something. Harry was sure of it.
Draco has an overwhelming urge to take his hand, but he manages to quell it.
If Ron is fazed by the non sequitur he doesn’t let on. “Not a definitive one yet. We’re expecting it with the Medi-Auror report. Their rough field tests indicated before midnight.”
Malfoy takes the lead as the group walks across the carefully manicured grounds toward a stand of tall trees that spread away to the western boundary, although Harry realises he actually has no idea how far the Malfoy land extends, physically or magically. Luna walks beside him, chatting happily to Neville.
. You’re such a fucking inspiration, Draco, and I’m not going to let you be brought low by that poisonous insect of a woman.”
, doing something daring.”
“As you can see, attendance, merchandise sales, listening and viewing figures have all been trending down for the last decade and show no signs of recovery.”
“Are you sure? That doesn’t sound like—”
“No! My dad’s going to help me practise, once I’ve had flying lessons at Hogwarts.”
“No,” he manages to say with certainty. “Voldemort’s not coming back.”
“Why did you write to everyone except me?”
“Oh, right. I suppose all that happened after the wedding,” she says after a beat, as if it’s taken her a moment to piece the timeline together. “Draco helped Ron and me with a patrician bonding ceremony. It’s an ancient kind of marriage bond.”
Draco stumbles to a halt.
Hermione ignores this, and continues, “DNA recovery and sequencing is quite complicated. Is this officer from the Metropolitan Police actually able to do it here, in the field?”
Malfoy rubs at his eyes. He says nothing for a long minute. For once, Harry’s curiosity overpowers his irritation at Draco and he waits.
Hermione is surprised about the house. Ron is more surprised that Harry has cooked.
“No,” Bulstrode replies curtly.
She reaches for a giant ledger with shaking hands, running one tremulous finger down a long list of names and numbers. “Nothing here, dear. I’ll let you know as soon as it’s back from Records.”
The change in lighting this time isn’t so severe. Warm lanterns hang around the walls, and a roaring fire burns in a wide grate. The room is very plain, the stone floor is bare, and the only furniture is a dark walnut table and four chairs.
Outside in the corridor he can hear the team arriving for practice—the noisy clang of locker doors being thrown back and the sound of a weight machine next door in the gym being pressed into service. He struggles a little getting back to his feet, pushing himself out of the comfy armchair. Luna eyes him with suspicion and hands him a small bottle of salve before he even asks.
There’s a horrible violent shuddering around them. Bits of rubble and paper, book bindings, and splintered wood all lift off the floor and are swept up into the ghosts’ wake like a gathering tornado.
Harry’s surprised by the strength of his own reaction. He twists his hands awkwardly in his lap.
Draco shrugs, “Not everyone learns the same way.” He proceeds to ignore Harry then, moving away across the pitch to uncharm the grass and stow the training obstacles beside the boundary.
Each day he goes to Diagon Alley, head held high ignoring the stares and mutters, and he checks his Owl Box for messages.
Harry seems healthier, he can’t help but notice. His skin browns up in the sun and his ribs gradually appear less prominent. Not completely better though. One Friday he’s nowhere to be seen, although his cap and t-shirt are lying on a sawhorse by the kitchen door. “Where’s your little friend?” Draco asks Jack, trying not to sound too interested.
“Wait, what?” Ron sputters, catching her hand.
“I’m surprised the goblins signed off on hiring him,” Hermione muses. “It’s been incredibly difficult for anyone with the Mark to get work legally. McGonagall wanted to take pity on Gregory Goyle’s father and let him do a bit of groundskeeping at Hogwarts. The Trustees weren’t having a bar of it.”
Years ago, Ron suggested a group strategy using Quidditch metaphors about zone defence that had Hermione rolling her eyes but made a certain amount of sense to Draco. So now they pool their resources, getting Teddy and Rose to spend their breaks together and bringing in a rotating cast of friends and extended family to keep them entertained. This Easter is no exception.
“I know, dreadfully old-fashioned,” Draco replies with a chuckle. “At the centre of the ritual are the rings. The magic imbued in the rings through the ceremony, and successive ceremonies down through the generations, are at the heart of pureblood ancestral magic.”
