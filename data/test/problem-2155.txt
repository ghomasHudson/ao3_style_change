And Harry knew it was true: of course he couldn’t deny there were still times that he really missed Ginny - her presence, the things they used to share - but Harry had to admit that all in all their divorce had been good for them both, making them expand their horizons, ultimately giving Harry the courage to stop working as an Auror and then take on this new job that he thought would fit him like a glove.
“Really?” There was something Harry hadn’t expected at all. ”But-, but he was awful to you in school.”
At first Draco had been looking forward to this part, still hoping that something would miraculously appear when they’d have dismantled everything, but the longer they’d been working on the statuettes, the likelier it seemed that whatever their wards had been protecting had long gone.
It felt safe for some reason, even if it was Malfoy of all people that he’d shared the experience with, and Harry noticed that this time he’d felt much less insecure than the first, knowing that Malfoy hadn’t been put off by Harry’s inexperience. Well, at least he’d still wanted to repeat.
The Firewhisky had relaxed him alright, but it had done nothing much to ease Draco’s mind. He’d still found his thoughts wandering off to all things Harry-related, quite without his permission: they just wouldn’t leave him alone.
quite ridiculous, but he also was an Auror, Draco reminded himself, which meant Smith could still land him in trouble.
The boy saw Harry’s Glamour drop and then there was just surprise. “But, you’re Harry Potter,” he all but yelled.
Then she called out to a young nurse further on in the corridor. “Catherine, take them to room two. And Disillusion it.”
Again, just like at the cottage, Draco set to work methodically, carefully discarding layer after layer of intricately interwoven wards. And Harry was just as mesmerised as he had been a few days ago, realising that although Draco had never said so, he was probably much more than just average at this.
Well, as long as they kept on casting, Harry taking them full-on from his position by the door and Draco from his position in the air: initially shooting spells at mostly unsuspecting guards.
“They don’t like to be touched,” Draco said, sounding mostly disapproving, but with a hint of amusement that Harry held onto for some reason. Then Draco just proceeded to sit on the floor, his back against a wall and his knees drawn in. His movements weren’t half as graceful as they would normally be and when Harry saw the whiskey bottle in a nearby corner, he understood.
Draco evaded looking at Harry, though, quite purposely not meeting Harry’s gaze. “I’m going to take a shower,” he said.
People around him seemed in turmoil, talking to him, but he had trouble hearing them. It seemed like he wasn’t really there, like he was dreaming, stuck in his head, not really able to register anything around him.
So he went to the Ministry canteen, picking up two fresh baguettes - an egg and bacon one for himself and something salmon-y for Malfoy -  before making his way to Malfoy’s office.
Harry smiled at him. “No, you two have fun,” Harry just said. Zabini could probably really dance, if his easy and confident way of moving was anything to go by, and so could Ginny. It would be nice for her to actually have a go with someone who wouldn’t ruin her shoes, her toes and her dress in the process.
And that was when Draco noticed it: the dark and cold spreading like a disease, the hair on his arms standing on end. Draco turned to where it seemed to originate from, drawing his wand immediately, dread clawing at his heart now.
Well, at least Potter hadn’t been alone this whole evening. Draco had seen how he’d been constantly talking to people, mostly to Weasley and Granger and occasionally Ginny. And to anyone else who happened to come his way, of course.
“So you’d like to go to a gay club?” Hermione summarised later that evening. “I think that’s a wonderful idea,” Harry was quite a few drinks in and for some reason he’d spilled the idea he’d been playing around with for a while now, not knowing whether he should actually follow up on it. “You should definitely try going,” Hermione answered his doubts.
At first it had just consisted of highly skilled Aurors, but after the first casualties came in, caused by dark objects and wards that were trickier to dismantle than you’d expect, Curse-Beakers had been thrown into the mix.
“No, I’m perfectly able to deal with those.” Malfoy’s voice now sounded almost offended all of a sudden, as if he wanted to make sure Harry knew he didn’t actually
Being in Harry’s house again wasn’t as awkward as Draco had thought it would be: in a way it was still as he remembered it, but Harry had done it up: making it lighter, more homey somehow.
Somewhere at the back of his mind Harry had apparently feared someone had found them, but now he saw they weren't in any kind of danger. It was just Draco, obviously having a bad dream: his brow creased and his eyes shut tight.
This time it was Draco’s last class on Friday that Potter walked into. Granted, there were just five minutes left and Draco was already wrapping up when Potter suddenly appeared, but there he was. Draco forced himself to finish what he was saying without hesitation.
But that moment passed and Harry said, tone somewhere between annoyed and humorous: “Would you mind if I cooked for the both of us? You know, in my kitchen, which actually does have all the necessary appliances, like a hob and an oven.”
“So how does that Muggle phone thing of yours actually work?” he decided to ask, while plonking down on the armrest of Malfoy’s seat.
The prospect had made Harry quite happy. He knew he would be good at teaching, knew how he’d liked it back at Hogwarts and he was really glad to have a chance at doing it again after having been an Auror for so many years.
Draco shook his head. Of course he’d had mood swings, quite a lot really, but he couldn’t exactly call them exceptional.
The sun was out today and although its light was rather cold and wintery, it still managed to give Malfoy’s face a softness that was all too appealing. He really
“Yes, of course,” Draco forced himself to answer flatly, even though he seemed unable to look away from Harry. And Harry from him, which made Draco bold somehow. So he stepped closer, leaning in enough to speak into Harry’s ear. “I’ll miss you though.” Draco knew his voice sounded every bit as sensuous and sultry as he’d wanted it to.
Draco gave Harry a strange look. “It didn’t scar, you know. Snape got there in time for it not to leave a mark.” Draco’s voice was quiet and Harry just now realised what he was actually talking about, why he thought Harry had been staring at him.
“Yes, well, that’s what being gay generally means, especially in combination with the maypole bit really.” It was the sort of condescending reply that probably would have pissed Harry off, even a short while ago. But now Harry just laughed.
Harry felt utterly relieved when he heard the crack of Apparition. First he saw nothing, though, but then Francois appeared, approaching the fence.
It would spare them the awkward conversation about breakfast, the one that Draco wasn’t prepared to have, really. Harry would not want him to stay – Draco’d undoubtedly overstayed his welcome quite enough already - but Harry would offer him breakfast anyway, because he was a Gryffindor and altogether nice and Draco would stay, because he couldn’t actually do anything else when it came to Harry.
Okay, that actually was a fair point. But then again: perhaps Potter had just lost track of time. “Yes, well, anyway,” Draco started, “I’m off now, so I erm-.” He finished not actually finishing and pointing at the door.
So Draco turned his back to Harry, still sitting down on the bed, mumbling: “In case you hadn’t noticed: I’m always rather pale.”
“Coming?” Harry asked. He was decidedly not watching anyone besides Draco either, Draco realised while Harry went straight for a table in the far corner that would at least give them a semblance of privacy. Draco followed.
“Yes, completely ridiculous.” Suddenly all playfulness had left Malfoy’s voice: he sounded cold and reserved.
It hadn’t been a problem at first: they had owled each other regularly and even though Draco had known this couldn’t be real, he had still allowed himself to dream. Just a bit.
Then Malfoy poured himself a good measure of whiskey from a bottle he had notably taken outside with him. “D’you want some?”
Draco saw and instinctively knew his shield wasn’t going to protect them against that, at least not for long.
Harry felt the feeling of repulsion that came with those wards wash over him. Then, realising it wasn’t actually
Come Monday Harry didn’t even wait for lunch break before he went over to Draco’s office in Curse-Breaking. It was the first thing he did when he got to the Ministry that morning.
“I heard Draco discharged himself yesterday,” Zabini started as soon as Harry’d let him in. Zabini smiled at this as if he hadn’t expected Draco to do anything else. “And I take it he’s alright, otherwise I would have heard, but I thought I might check anyway. It’s not like we have to keep anything a secret from
Harry had been patiently waiting, while Draco had been working, but now he seemed to get a bit restless. Draco honestly couldn’t blame him.
“Oh, and Harry … ,” Luna’s voice. She was disturbingly close, but somehow Draco couldn’t quite get himself to open his eyes. “I think you should take Draco.”
Harry grinned. “You’re only partially Veela, though, and your traits are, well, rather subtle.” Harry’s voice had undoubtedly gone the slightest bit teasing, but his smile faltered a little, as if he wasn’t entirely sure how Draco would take it.
Draco proceeded to undress, folding his clothes and leaving them on a chair in his bedroom after which he went into his new bathroom again, the underfloor heating comfortably warm under his feet. He walked straight into the shower cubicle, starting the spray of its enormous rain shower, so that soon water was running hot and soothing over his body, making his muscles relax instantly.
And that’s why he caught Malfoy looking at him intently later that evening, pointing Harry out to the slender girl on his right and saying something in what looked like a conspiratorial way, their heads close.
“Yeah.” Harry didn’t say anything else. He’d decided he wasn’t going to waste his breath on Terry if he didn’t have to.
“So, you’re back?” Harry just asked the first thing his mind supplied. It wasn’t his most impressive line, but it worked, because Malfoy now watched him, slightly bemused and at the same time with a disdainful expression on his face that for a short moment looked an awful lot like hurt.
That had been a mistake, though. Why hadn’t he done the sodding charm work at home! Because there he was: Harry Potter, very much awake and sort of staring at him. Draco almost felt compelled to tell Harry he was sorry for still being there, because he was, but for some reason the apology didn’t quite make it out of his mouth, though.
Harry still didn’t really know what to think about this whole thing, though. He actually hadn’t spared so much as a thought for what the aftermath of the war would have been like for Malfoy. Mostly he had just assumed Malfoy would have gone on being the prick he usually was, living the good life in Malfoy Manor and then moving to the Continent, because the weather was nicer or something.
Harry could have taken Draco’s words in many sorts of ways, but although his drawl was in place, his words didn’t seem have a real sting to them.
It was only when Harry turned to get dressed too, that he realised he hadn’t woken up at all throughout the four or five hours of sleep he’d had.
“Oh, Mr Potter,” her accent was adorably French and her face seemed to have lit up when she’d heard his name. It left him slightly confused. He didn’t think his name was that famous over on the Continent. “You’re here for Mr Malfoy, yes?” Her face lit up even more when she said Malfoy’s name.
Then he got his Firewhiskey and headed for the exit. It couldn’t possibly be too early to leave anymore.
And that apparently was when Draco stopped thinking. It must have been, because the next thing he saw was the circle of fire.
Penelope hadn’t been right. On Tuesday Draco was still infuriatingly absent from his office, from the Ministry, from
Draco just nodded, which his head and stomach didn’t at all approve of, and Neville and Luna got to the dancefloor, Luna doing her weird, intricate dance and Neville happily joining in. They looked good together, fitting.
“Yes, well, I don’t usually take anyone there. Blaise has obviously been, but no one else, really.” Malfoy’s voice sounded unguarded and quiet, just barely breaking the silence of night around them. “I-. I feel at ease there, safe, if that makes sense.”
“I won’t be here very much longer, though, so unless you would like to grace me with a dance?” Here Malfoy actually gazed at Harry directly, inexplicably going a very faint shade of pink.
When they came, they were just as spine-chilling as when they’d been at Hogwarts, but Draco felt a strength coming from his core that he had never felt before. It bubbled to the surface without him even trying, feeling somewhat like the first time he’d used magic but completely different at the same time.
Harry looked back at Draco, who watched him with such concern it almost hurt. “I’m fine,” Harry’s voice sounded warm and reassuring: he needed to make Draco know everything was fine. “I don’t think it was actually meant to hurt me. Perhaps it was there by accident, you know, left over from some deal or other.”
Draco’d been effectively avoiding Harry’s room for the rest of the day, knowing Harry’d leave before Draco’s shift would end. Apart from slight dizzy spells Harry had been absolutely fine (Draco had made sure Hannah Abbott had also corroborated that), so there had been no need to prolong Draco’s torture any further.
“I’m sorry,” Draco mumbled, turning away, trying to manage a semblance of dignity that actually proved very difficult to maintain.
“Do you still need me to take your mind off things? Because I should probably remind you that Ron is safely home now.” Draco said, because he couldn’t quite help himself. His tone was light, bordering on arrogant even, but he could also hear his own uncertainty.
“But,” Harry knew Hermione had a Muggle phone to keep into contact with her parents, “wouldn’t we need a number?”
So Malfoy flicked his wand in an elegant succession of movements, muttering a spell under his breath.
“I think it’s really nice you took Draco in.” Luna said, as if Malfoy was a stray puppy of some sort. Well, Harry knew for a fact that he was nothing of the kind at all. And what was she calling him
Harry didn’t know how much time had passed, but he’d been in that hallway long enough to go stiff with it, when suddenly and without any warning the door behind him gave way, causing him to sway backwards with it.
“Well, that’s not too late. You should come by The Leaky,” Harry smiled easily and Draco was ready to tell him ‘no’, to give him a reason, any reason, why he couldn’t make it, but then Harry added: “I would like you to be there.” And it sounded soft and so sincere that Draco just couldn’t get himself to decline.
“He’s good, isn’t he?” Zabini said. Harry started, at the same time registering that the owner of the club had apparently found them, probably having been alerted to two Aurors visiting his club. Zabini smiled.
Potter eventually just nodded. “There’s a bathroom just across the hallway.” He inhaled a sharp breath, like he wanted to say something else, but then decided not to. Good. Because Draco really didn’t want to hear anything about his current state and how perhaps he shouldn’t get up yet.
Draco shrugged and from the almost embarrassed look he shot Zabini, Harry gathered this probably wasn’t the first time he’d pulled a stunt like that, throwing himself into a situation he wasn’t technically supposed to get into.
on the same page, wanting the same mindless release. They must be, because why else would Potter be here again, actively talking him up.
“So what do you think?” Draco asked Harry after they’d successfully diffused a rather heated argument between Ginny and Seamus later that evening, “Could we leave them to it?” He’d leant into Harry again, his mouth close to Harry’s ear and he could almost feel Harry's reaction to his low purr without looking.
Penelope smiled at him and Draco realised he probably looked sort of eager to go downstairs, to see what they’d found. “You go down to the cellars, I’ll finish clearing this portrait and come down too,” she promptly said.
“Hold a shield, only lower when I cast,” Harry whispered. Draco nodded. Shields were his forte after all, had been since eighth year.
Draco and Harry worked in a system that was almost too simple: Draco held his shield only lowering when Harry cast. It was easy, because for some reason Draco knew exactly when Harry was going to cast, feeling the precise moment he had to lower his shield even without watching Harry.
So, he seemed to officially fall into Harry’s friend category now? The same one that Ron and Hermione fell into? Draco really wanted to belong there, but at the same time he felt massively disappointed.
Harry was able to hold back some sort of snort just in time. “I am, kind of. Just not coming from you.”
Of course class had started a bit tentatively, when some trainees had shily asked him about the war and whether the stories about him were true. Harry had expected it, so he had answered all of their questions honestly and then he’d started actually training his students.
Harry watched Malfoy some more and Malfoy just gazed back at him. Then he smiled a little, amused: “What else is there to tell?”
Well, Harry was just surprised. Malfoy had been to parties and events on a regular basis over the last three weeks, and yes, he usually drank the odd glass of wine, sometimes two, but Harry had never seen him drunk. Not like this, not even close.
“Wasn’t planning on that, really. I tried that yesterday when I came here unfortunately, and it didn’t quite agree with me.” Draco’s voice was as indifferent as always and it took Potter just a slight bit of time to actually understand what he was saying.
Luna smiled her aethereal smile. “Yes, you had Harry really worried. We had to force him out eventually to be able to treat you, to let you rest. He’s been waiting in the waiting room ever since.” For some reason that seemed to settle Draco’s frayed nerves a little. Luna paused just a beat, watching Draco. “Shall I ask him to come in?”
Then Draco had asked Jones whether he could take Kendrick for a walk around the grounds. A look that Harry didn’t quite get, passed between Francois and Jones at that. Then Jones just gave the two of them a sly smile and nodded.
Blaise just smiled. “Not ready to bet on that really. Anyway, let’s eat. I haven’t brought all of this food over just to ignore it.”
So Draco was going to do his job: to make absolutely sure that Harry was okay, which was why he settled in the chair next to Harry’s bed – even though it really
It almost felt like sparks going off, but Draco ignored that, as he ignored the sodding pain in his back that flared up again, then quickly receded.
“I, I thought I’d … . I didn’t know you lived here now.” He blurted out, his voice definitely starting to falter. It was the truth. He had been visiting here once before, when he was still very small, and he knew the house belonged to the Black family. So, when he’d been cursed, he had come here to find help, figuring there would probably still be a house elf in this house after his Great-Aunt Walburga had died, a house elf who could have been inclined to help him.
“You’ve got a Crushing Cabinet in here,” Harry blurted, his curiosity apparently winning out on what he was actually here for.
At that Draco’s eyes snapped open. “Potter, I-, you-.” he was panting heavily, seemingly having trouble focussing.
For a moment Harry thought he overstepped their invisible line again, but Draco didn’t deny it, instead just mumbling: “Well, for some reason you seem to be the only thing keeping me awake since that bloody curse.”
The next morning was much like the morning before: Harry woke up to an otherwise empty bed and room, but this time he had actually slept very well throughout the latter part of the night.
It was the next Saturday morning and not even nine o’clock yet, when Draco woke up, his alarm softly chiming by his side. Normally he wouldn’t have bothered, not on a Saturday, and certainly not after the night they’d just had, which had mostly been spent decidedly not sleeping. But today was a special day. Today he wanted to be up before Harry.
“Draco, you’re here.” A beautiful, teenage girl, with golden skin and lush black hair smiled at Malfoy. “Mum said you weren’t in, but you didn’t forget.”
“He was hit by a modified Stunner, nothing too bad, we think, but when a Healer wanted to examine him, he refused to be seen by them. He asked for you by name. Didn’t want anyone else doing anything.”
“Yes, actually. But I’m not telling you all of it.” Harry smiled, almost despite himself. “He did seem really surprised you’d taken me to that Muggle club of yours, though.” Harry’s tone was light, but even in his current, still slightly sleep-addled state he remembered it was important somehow.
Harry vaguely felt like he was being tricked, but he answered anyway: “No, of course not.” It came out much too forceful. Damn Slytherins. Harry ploughed on regardless, though. “But I could imagine you would want to dance with your
“No, he wouldn’t,” Luna sounded very sure, her words accompanied by her ethereal smile as if she just knew. “Just talk to him.”
Draco realised he and Potter would never be like that. Of course they couldn’t be. How much of an idiot was he, anyway? Whatever Draco and Potter had shared, it hadn’t actually been anything yet. Just sex, possibly friendship and some dinners. Nothing more. How could he ever have thought … ?
Draco just shrugged. “That’s just the way it works.” He tried to make it sound matter-of-factly, sort of succeeding this time.
For a brief moment Malfoy looked like he was going to say something taunting, but then he visibly bit it back, averting his gaze at the same time. “Thursday is my mother’s birthday. I wanted to get her a book I know she’d like.” His voice was rather quiet all of a sudden, as if saying it took some effort, as if he hadn’t wanted to say this out loud.
Nott knew what Draco was holding the minute Draco had unshrunk it, too, an almost hungry look passing over Nott’s face, before it set into disinterest again.
And although the work on the house was dull, Penelope was really easy to work with, sharing her knowledge on every object they worked on and subsequently cleared.
“Good morning,” Malfoy said it casually over his shoulder when Harry had made it into the kitchen. Malfoy was at the stove, frying, wearing the same pair of pyjamas he’d had on yesterday, his feet just as bare too. It made him look exposed in a way Harry didn’t quite know how to deal with, a way that he hadn’t had time to register yesterday morning when he’d been in too much of a hurry.
“Thanks.” Draco’s voice still sounded gravelly, like it always did when he’d just woken. He downed the potion and Harry could see that it was working, making the creases of pain in his face disappear.
Which was why he was now standing outside of Harry’s house at Grimmauld Place, having walked all the way there, which in his current state had definitely been an accomplishment he was rather proud of.
Draco had just apparated in from work, late, because a four-year-old had been hurt rather badly trying to ride a broom and he had wanted to finish treating her before leaving. It had taken him about one and a half hours.
“Of course I am,” Draco breathed in Potter’s ear, the seduction lacing his voice something he had perfected over the years. “I’m here almost every Saturday night. What’s your excuse?”
Ah, there she was. He found Ginny somewhere to his right, talking to a witch Harry vaguely remembered. She probably worked in Magical Games and Sport, or perhaps it was the Department of magical Accidents and Catastrophes, or it could also be-.
It meant that Draco was forced to sit at the other end of the table, in between the unidentified blond man, who eyed him rather suspiciously, and Hermione, who in turn was sitting beside Neville. Neville immediately nodded at him, sending him a rather encouraging smile that Draco definitely hadn’t expected.
Zabini just smiled knowingly, before answering. “We’re not that sort of partners. Let’s just say we have an understanding.”
He made a stop at the reception desk to make sure an extra bed would be placed in Weasley’s room, then he made to leave.
Francois addressed the guards first. “It’s him,” his tone commanding, almost daring them to question his authority. They quite obviously didn’t take the dare and consequently opened the gate mumbling a spell, letting Harry in.
he had said instead, asking: “Why didn’t you just ask me, you know, whether you could visit your mother?”
In the thick smoke that followed Draco’s spell, Harry could hear Draco cast again, the gentle tingle of Draco’s magic, then the eerie feeling of being levitated a bit, just enough for Draco to be able to move him, to Nott’s office to be exact.
“I’m off tomorrow,” Harry’s answer was quite shocking in its simplicity, its ease. “I can be here, let them in.”
Draco’d been working at St Mungo’s for a week now, and he felt like he had been on call more than he’d been off. Well, at least today was a Friday and he was actually off for the whole weekend, so he would be able to sleep longer (anything around six or seven hours a night would be nice for a change) and perhaps even start making his flat look a bit more like a real home.
“Yes, when I’d served my sentence I-, well, Claude was very nice to me.” Harry felt something inside him twist in an uncomfortable knot for some reason, but he found he did actually understand how Malfoy would have ended up here, outside the wizarding world, mixing drinks, because after Azkaban, well, he wouldn’t have been particularly welcome anywhere wizarding. But he wouldn’t have had any Muggle diplomas, either.
changed,” Harry said. It held all the warmth he felt. And he meant it. The old Draco would never had thought he deserved anything bad, let alone punishment.
“Wait, are you actually off already?” Potter asked, before Draco could have turned. “I mean: you don’t have any more, you know, curses to break before your weekend starts?”
“It really is a nice space,” Harry said when he’d seen most of the flat, opening the last door, the one leading to Draco’s bedroom, which didn’t actually have-. “There’s just a mattress?” Harry’s voice held blatant surprise.
“Yes, I suppose it is.” Draco couldn’t quite keep his own opinion on his Patronus from lacing his words.
Harry looked around in absolute horror. The atrium of the Ministry, normally the proud testament to what the wizarding world was capable of, had been almost completely destroyed: the attack swift and entirely unexpected.
Harry smiled at him. “Well, at least it’s Friday, so after work we’ll have the whole weekend to ourselves.”
Draco nodded. Blaise and Ginny Weasley had surprisingly been an item since a few weeks after Christmas break, taking the interhouse unity that McGonagall was preaching to a whole new level.
feel a lot better and more importantly he just hadn’t been able to think of another way of changing the subject.
Harry decided he wouldn’t let that scare him off, though, not this time. “I talked to Luna,” he simply replied.
“Don’t.” Harry touched Malfoy’s arm when he said it. It was just a light touch, barely there, but Malfoy sat back down and Harry realised Malfoy was shivering. By reflex he held his blanket up, scooting to the side to let Malfoy join him. There was no need for him to be cold.
When he asked for Corentin Didier she just looked at the two of them for a moment, as if debating something, then saying: “Corentin isn’t here, but I’ll Floo him.”
Dinner had passed quickly that way and before Draco had known it, they’d had dessert, which had happened to be the best tiramisu that Draco’d ever had. It had left him completely content and it was with quite some regret that he realised that this was actually the end to a most enjoyable evening.
Draco didn’t mention that Harry shouldn’t, somehow afraid Harry might turn back immediately if he did.
And still Potter hadn’t mentioned anything about the Saturdays in the club, not even alluding to them, not once, which meant Draco had leapt to the conclusion that Potter’s way of coping with this actually was exactly the same as his own: his day-life and his night-life two completely separate worlds.
Draco didn’t really know what to think of that. Whether it was a good thing that his pure-blood heritage actually still seemed to hold value to some. He doubted very much that it was.
“I’ve already had lunch in my office in Curse-Breaking, but there’s a small pile of correction work I’d like to finish before class, which is why I’m early today,” Draco added, offering an explanation.
And now when Malfoy slid one hand down, finding Harry’s, Harry let it happen. And he even liked it when Malfoy intertwined their fingers like they sometimes did at night.
“It really is very beautiful,” Harry remarked, looking up at the stars surrounding them. He heard the reverence to his own voice.
And Harry found it drove him up the wall. It was even more infuriating than Malfoy’s arrogance, which was damn well saying something.
actually wondered he would have got his answer when they made it back to the large office space again.
Draco had gotten home from work around half past seven already, which for him was decidedly early, but he had put off going to The Leaky for at least another hour: eating and then choosing what to wear once, twice, eventually settling on his third choice: a pair of close fitting, stone washed jeans and a crisp white shirt – the top two buttons undone again and the sleeves up to his elbows – which, knowing Harry and his friends, would probably still qualify as being undisputedly overdressed.
Malfoy hesitated just a moment, then got himself a plate of food and sat down, effortlessly graceful as always. Harry started to suspect he actually liked watching Malfoy move like that.
Malfoy looked up at her. “Yes, I wanted to let you know, but I didn’t have my phone on me. My apologies.” He actually
So, Potter got up, watching Draco with eyes that were entirely too green and instead of making it out the door, he did the opposite, moving around Draco’s desk silently, stepping close without any apparent reason. He didn’t say anything, but he just kept looking at Draco, holding his gaze captive as surely as if he’d cast a spell.
He’d cross that bridge when he’d get there. Everything would probably have settled a bit by then, anyway. Perhaps he actually
And he realised he would miss it. Even though his and Astoria’s marriage had never been based on romantic love, it had worked, she had been able to ground him, make him see he could still redefine himself, that whatever his past had been, he could still do the right thing now.
“That actually sounds like a really good idea,” Dean said, apparently having gotten in just after Ginny, together with Seamus and Neville.
Well, not literally bloody, of course, not since the war. And not quite a disaster as such. It would have been a disaster if Harry … .
Potter shot him a glance, but quite astoundingly it wasn’t a disapproving one: it was curious more than anything, perhaps even slightly encouraging.
When Harry had stumbled out of the Floo in his house and gone to his kitchen, he was welcomed by a fresh, lemony smell. The kitchen looked clean, the floor shining and all dishes - including the stuff that had been used for breakfast - neatly tucked away in their appropriate cupboards.
“Yes, Potter, I’m taking those down.” He sounded every bit as Malfoy-ish as he used to, but there was something else there too, sounding suspiciously like amusement. “But as I suppose you haven’t come here to fill me in on that particular tad of information, there must be another reason for your visit?”
The man was lean and athletic, wearing a beige suit that showed it all off perfectly, including his soft dark hair and piercing blue eyes. When he spoke English he had a thick French accent.
When breakfast had arrived around a quarter past eight the next day, there was still no sign of Draco and Harry didn’t quite know what to do about it. He didn’t want to invade Draco’s privacy by walking into his bedroom like last time. That hadn’t been particularly well received.
“Couldn’t you have-?” Malfoy started, but didn’t finish, his voice still angry and rough. And Harry suddenly realised he looked a bit lost for some reason.
Blaise grinned and Draco smiled back, now moving to claim his usual chair, the one opposite to where Blaise was sitting, the chair next to Harry. Harry had actually been looking at Draco ever since he'd come in and Draco loved that look: fondness and hunger all rolled into one.
When Malfoy started to move again, his back to Harry, Harry’s arms were securely on his hips. And Harry let himself feel it: the pounding, incessant beat of the music, the rhythm that Malfoy moved to as if he was made for it and Harry started to move with him, his hands high enough now that he could feel the shift of Malfoy’s obliques under his skin.
Harry was on the bed, looking pale. He was propped up against the headboard, leaning into it, and all sorts of alarms immediately went off inside of Draco’s head. Harry wouldn’t sit like that if he had a choice.
Harry smiled. “No, you shouldn’t. You should just sit down and, you know, wait and fall asleep.” He felt his own broad grin.
So Harry got up and plonked unceremoniously down on the bed next to Draco, holding on to his courage while he still had it. “I don’t regret it,” Harry stated with all the certainty he felt. “Kissing you,” he added, just to be sure.
Draco recognised Ron Weasley straight away, of course. He was brought in by his brother and his arm was completely limp, signs of massive burns all over it.
Zabini was mixing a drink, suspended, while balancing a glass in his hand trying to fill it with beer.
Ah, there was the Malfoy Harry remembered. The Malfoy that would do anything to be in the limelight, the Malfoy that wanted to be seen and admired.
Draco was nervous when he felt the tug on his wards and he got to his front door in a moment, but forced himself not to open it too quickly.
“Oh yes, but I think there were probably more of them. Clothes do tend to hide these kinds of things, you know.”
“Charlie Weasley.” He stuck out his hand and Draco took it. “I was really impressed with your work on Alexandru.” Oh,
Harry’s professional brain kicked in then and there, so he started asking questions. How long would he be away for, what would be his clearance, what would he officially be able to do (could he make arrests), and so on and so forth.
Just for something to do Harry fished his phial of Dittany out of his pocket. He had taken it when he’d left his house that morning, because-, well, because he’d suspected it might be needed. And it obviously
As Draco had expected, Harry was still asleep. Normally Harry was an early riser, but after a night like the one they’d just had, he usually slept in. So, Draco softly put the parcel on his bedside table and held the tray suspended next to where Harry was sleeping.
“She was fine.” Harry was looking at Draco again and there was warmth and humour and a whole lot of other things Draco didn’t really have a name for. “We talked about you, actually.”
“Hey, you’re awake.” Draco knew it was Luna speaking softly, even before he had focussed enough to actually see her.
Draco only watched him for a beat longer, his eyebrows still raised, almost as if daring Harry to say he couldn’t use his own bathroom whenever he wanted to.
Draco shook his head. “Me neither.” He paused. “I did see him talk to someone outside the grounds yesterday though, after the alarm had gone off. I thought it must be someone from the Ministry, but it probably was someone who wanted to get his hands on this,” Draco stated, indicating the Time-Turner with his head. He paused for a moment, collecting his thoughts. “Which could very well mean we’re bound to have company again.”
“So, aren’t you going to invite me in? You know, give me the grand tour?” Okay, now Harry was taking the piss and it actually, really hurt.
Now Malfoy clenched his jaw just a bit, then swallowed, his brow slightly furrowed and his eyes too bright all of a sudden. “My mother told me that he used to have this box as a child.” Malfoy paused for a beat, then added: “I’d never seen it before, but she had. She told me she really liked it. I can see why.” His voice was so quiet, thick with emotion and Harry felt like he was intruding upon a very private moment.
The next morning, when Harry was ready to Apparate into his meeting with the Covert Ops agent he was supposed to work with on this potions smugglers case, he still didn’t exactly know what to think of his meeting with Draco Malfoy the night prior. It had left him on uneven footing. He had always thought he knew Malfoy, but for some reason now he wasn’t entirely sure anymore.
And Draco could feel the familiar pull, his body so close to Harry’s that it was almost impossible not to give in. They were still watching each other and Draco leant in, just a bit, without even thinking about it. It was as if their bodies had a mind of their own.
“Not important,” Draco briefly closed his eyes. “They bought what I told them. In the end. You are going to see John again tomorrow evening. Bring your cloak.”
Healer. She didn’t seem to think anything of it, however, perching on his bed and smiling her unsettlingly radiant smile at him.
Draco almost snorted: “We both know how he would take it. And no, I don’t care. At all. I stopped caring about his opinion a long time ago. Probably around the time he invited that-, that
Well, it had been rather more than fine. Which probably was exactly why he shouldn’t have Potter do it again.
Of course Harry had known these kinds of intricate wards – because whatever Zabini had said they seemed rather complex: Harry had recognised a few basic wards, but they seemed to be used in a different way altogether - had layers that needed to be taken apart, but he hadn’t been prepared for how beautiful that looked. With an almost lazy flick of his wand and a muttered spell Zabini had revealed the complicated layers the wards were noticeably comprised of.
There was only one place this could possibly end, of course: the bedroom much more comfortable than anywhere else.
Astoria smiled at him warmly. “Me too,” she said, “I really don’t regret our arrangement. We were good together. It’s just-, I wanted-“
“Hey, Draco.” The girl behind the bar smiled at Malfoy, genuinely and open, and Harry realised she knew and actually liked him. “Your usual?” Malfoy nodded. “And your friend here?” she asked next, shifting her gaze to watch Harry.
Harry smiled at him reassuringly, warm. “No, when you regained consciousness just after I brought you in and they told you what was going on, you kept repeating they couldn’t inform anyone in your family. Not yet. So I-. Well, eventually they decided not to.”
Harry did, putting the baguettes down on Malfoy’s desk at the same time. Malfoy cocked his head, arching his eyebrows in surprise.
“I’ll make us a sandwich: it’s late and I really don’t feel like making anything else, if that’s okay,” Draco said when Harry had actually voiced he was hungry.
Harry made it out of bed as carefully as he possibly could, realising he was off today. He’d been working shifts all weekend and yesterday, but in exchange he wouldn’t have to work today.
And it should have been clear to Harry straight away, it really should have been, but somehow it took Harry time to figure it out: these were the clothes Malfoy
“But that’s, that’s miles. And you’re hurt!” Of all the stupid things the stupid fucker could have done. Fuck.
Robards had made him take leave for a week, so now Harry was in his house, trying to get the main rooms to look more like the welcoming spaces he’d always imagined, but had never found the time to change them into.
“Yeah, it was,” Harry agreed easily. Then he suddenly turned to Draco a little. They’d just walked into the alleyway that they were supposed to appparate from. “Would you like to-, you know, come to mine for a bit?”
“Malfoy, we’re going to have to take you into custody. Tomorrow we can have a Healer look for any traces of this so-called memory spell,” Terry continued relentlessly.
“The library would probably be honoured since I don’t presume it’s been used all that much recently.” Draco tried an arrogant, but still slightly teasing tone.
“No, no one wanting to do my bidding or falling under my spell.” Draco wanted to get that one out of the way as soon as possible. As helpful as Veela Allure could have been two years ago in a house full of Voldemort and his minions - or now, as people shunned him in the streets for said acquaintance - Draco was quite sure he didn’t have it: no one had been exceptionally helpful or especially prone to do what he wanted them to.
“Ah, no need for all that,” a familiar voice said and Harry realised who it belonged to within the second.
Then Harry saw another man position himself behind Malfoy, snaking his arms around Malfoy’s waist slowly as he danced, his body mimicking perfectly what Malfoy was doing and it just didn’t sit right. It was annoying in a way that Harry couldn’t quite explain.
That was when Harry noticed their wards go off, signalling someone at the door. It probably meant that breakfast had arrived, beautifully in time.
“Yes,” Harry answered blandly, probably trying to do the grown-up thing here, even if he was dealing with Draco. “The Auror Department has two French Aurors over this week and one of the things they want to know more about is our training programme, so that’s why they’re visiting today.”
“Well, yes, obviously.” Malfoy paused a beat, then added: “Why? Shouldn’t I be?” There was a challenge to his voice, but also something else, something underneath that he wasn’t saying.
In the meantime Harry had gotten the kettle boiling without even looking at it and Draco used it to make them tea.
that shouldn’t have worked on two people at once, but still did. The look of utter surprise on the assailants’ faces when their wands flew easily into Harry’s hands, was quite satisfactory.
Damn it! The man shot him a spell Harry didn’t recognise, but that couldn’t bode well and Harry cast his protective shield just in time, lowering it straight away to cast an
Then Nott just started laughing, amused and mocking. “Oh, Draco, really? You think Potter really wants to kiss you? What do you think that powder he breathed in just now was for?”
Draco closed his eyes again. Perhaps if he just gave in to sleep, he would wake up tomorrow and all of this would have gone. It was most definitely worth a shot.
Malfoy paused a moment before answering. “I think I might, but I would need to have a good look at it first.” He sighed almost inaudibly. “But since I don’t actually have the time to do that at the moment, it will have to wait. You could either leave it here and come back for it at, well, let’s say the beginning of next week. Or-“ here Malfoy watched Harry almost just as intently as he had the box, gauging Harry’s reaction, “you could take it to another Curse-Breaker. I think you know where to find them.” The tone of his voice somehow seemed to be stuck between amusement and just plain tiredness.
Harry didn’t know exactly how long he’d been standing there before he noticed he’d apparently been staring. He pulled himself out of it.
Zabini shrugged: “Well, we just tend to take each other to events like these. It’s not much unlike you and Ginny, only we sometimes go home together afterwards.”
and his entourage into our house.” Here Draco stopped for a moment, adding more softly, “Possibly even before.”
The rest of their Saturday had been spent looking for the perfect bed and wardrobe, which they had found, together with a rather beautiful chest of drawers that would be absolutely perfect with the rest of it.
Harry knew that this room had to be important, before he’d even been inside, so he peeked in with extreme caution, opening the door by only a fraction. He obviously hadn’t been careful enough, though, because as soon as the door had opened he heard a poof and was hit with something that looked like pinkish powder. He couldn’t help but breath it in and at first he thought it was actually meant to choke him.
“Well, the blue’s gone.” Harry was still watching him, his gaze soft and intent, the ghost of his touch lingering on Draco’s cheek. “At least it’s off your
Draco let go completely, letting the wave crash over him as it had threatened to do a few times this week already. He just couldn’t keep fencing it off all the time.
“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Harry gritted out, sounding positively angry, but seemingly in control again. He sat back down, averting his gaze from Smith and reluctantly ignoring him completely.
He didn’t hear anything on the other side of the door and although that could also be due to a Silencing Charm, Harry didn’t take it as a good sign.
It was a feeling that Harry knew. A feeling that definitely didn’t come with people he was just friends with, though.
Harry, purposely walking towards the man, was really still too far off to be casting properly, but it worked all the same and the man was bound and gagged. Heavily.
anymore.” Zabini smiled a slightly mischievous smile and Harry didn’t quite know how to take it. He hadn’t exactly asked to be kept out of that particular loop.
It seemed an unbearable thought all of a sudden and the desperation Harry felt at that apparently made up for his lack of courage. “Do you remember?” Harry blurted out, entirely out of context, “You know, after we went to that club a few days ago?” Draco looked puzzled, but the pink on his cheeks intensified while he was seemingly holding his  breath and suddenly Harry found his bravery, pulling his courage from hiding as if it were a rabbit from a hat: “That we-, that we kissed? Do you remember that we, erm, kissed?”
Malfoy hesitated just a beat before answering: “No, I first had a room somewhere else.” He averted his gaze and Harry realised that, however curious this answer made him, Malfoy was not going to tell him more.
Draco was on his back, sprawled out over the sofa as if he’d collapsed there and hadn’t woken up since. He was still wearing the clothes Harry’d lent him yesterday and he was quite pale.
There was that slightly confused frown on Malfoy’s face again and Harry felt sure he would say ‘no’, only this time Malfoy didn’t, answering: “Well, I suppose I could do with some
“Okay.” Draco noticed the resignation in his own voice. He was so bloody tired he couldn’t really get himself to care anymore. Besides it was too late to try and hold on to his dignity anyway.
“I’d like you to come with me for the night,” and when Harry saw the uncertainty still written on Draco’s face: “I’d like you to come over whenever you want. I’d like to see you as much as you’d allow. I’d like you to be part of my life. A real, solid part. I’d like us to be-.”
“It’s not your fault, you know.” Draco’s voice was soft, sincere. “You did what you were supposed to and I-, well, I
“I could make an educated guess.” Draco was still watching him, his eyes playfully lingering on Harry’s.
At first Harry didn’t see Draco himself, though, until he walked into the living room and found the sofa.
“Charlie already said you were very good,” Weasley, however, mumbled. It took Draco by surprise: he had known the Weasley family were tight knit, but he hadn’t expected one member’s opinion to be able to transform him from an Ex Death Eater into someone at least slightly palatable.
“Hey, Harry. I brought you some hangover potion. I thought you might need it and Ron told me you were out.”
Even then there was something terribly wrong, though, his skin so light it almost hurt Harry’s eyes. Harry made it there even faster, realising, with a shock of surprise, it wasn’t Zabini whom he was watching at all.
Goodall had been sentenced to 20 years, but Boot had only got five. Harry had thought it was nowhere near enough when he’d heard it. “They almost killed you,” Harry just simply said as if that explained it all.
Draco swallowed again, his pain almost a tangible thing somehow. “So I searched for it, but I couldn’t-, I couldn’t find it. I even tried to find someone to make her a new one, but apparently they are rather time-consuming to make. And my mother, well, she -, she didn’t-.” Draco cut himself short, shaking his head a bit helplessly, not actually able to say it.
While having dinner later that night they’d talked effortlessly, apparently completely at ease with each other. And somewhere throughout the evening – Draco was nursing a tumbler of  Firewhisky, just the one - Draco registered he felt happy, really happy.
But he had, his hand somehow possessively on Harry’s lower back now, urging him closer still. And Draco found there was absolutely no stopping the kiss that followed: it was hard and deep, somewhere between a kiss and a fight.
Still, Blaise came up to them now – a salad on his plate - and sat down at their table. For a moment there, Draco dreaded it - images of Blaise openly talking about Draco’s Saturday evenings, or worse, him grilling
Then he took a shower, dressed himself and went to the kitchen, surprised that he found himself hoping that Malfoy had cooked him breakfast again, because, even though he wasn’t actually late today and could easily have gotten his tea and toast routine in, it would be so much easier to just sit and eat something nice.
Next Draco sat up on his sofa, still smiling stupidly, putting his bathrobe on again. Harry moved from the window, sitting down right beside him.
And Harry found it was extremely difficult to look away from Malfoy again, especially now he was slightly blushing and all. Malfoy had finished changing into a pair of jeans that looked expensive and a shirt of which the sleeves had been rolled up to his elbows, everything fitting him to perfection.
Harry’s brain felt fuzzy and didn’t seem able to catch up, so Malfoy explained: “I mean to your Auror partner. I know he doesn’t like me much, but, well, I can’t really blame him.” Harry watched Malfoy in surprise, close enough to see the clouds in his grey eyes. “And as much as I appreciate what you’re doing, I-, it’s most definitely not worth losing a partner over.”
There was a slight question to his words and Harry felt the strong urge to nod. Not doing anything with this information seemed like wasting a good opportunity. They were here for recon mostly and that was exactly what they would be doing.
Harry turned around to look at him and the smile he flashed him was warm and reassuring, his answer quick: “No,” adding more softly, “at least not if you don’t want me to.”
Draco watched him, the smile he gave Harry warm, but also still slightly distrustful, as if he didn’t quite believe Harry could actually mean this.
“Yes, of course it is.” Draco didn’t mind, quite the opposite, really. It would conveniently end this rather uncomfortable conversation.
Harry didn’t think he was given a fair choice, the low in Malfoy’s voice reverberating through his every fibre and because Harry’s vocal chords had obviously decided to give up too, there only was one way for it. Harry pulled Malfoy in for a kiss, hard and needy, a kiss he’d apparently been waiting for all evening.
lost, where he might have been a tad disgruntled, clearing the board of its remaining pieces in one swipe and probably with slightly more force than the situation had warranted).
“So heading back to Malfoy?” Terry had been giving little pinpricks on the subject all day, so Harry should probably have seen it coming.
And Harry pushed himself out of bed, too. He’d have to get ready for Sunday lunch at the Burrow anyway.
Draco hadn’t actually expected Potter to follow through on this, not with him of all people, which was why Potter’s words left Draco completely astounded. So he just nodded, not trusting his voice to produce the sort of sentence that would meet up to his standards right now. Had Potter actually meant … .
“And I don’t know what exactly they took yet, but I do know you should talk to that piece of Malfoy sc-.” The owner of the shop must have picked up on something in Harry’s face, because he stopped, adjusting to: “To that Malfoy boy. One of the burglars walked into him, just before turning the corner, and he looked him straight in the eye before running off again, the Malfoy brat didn’t even lift a finger.” Here the man looked pointedly at Harry and Terry, adding, apparently wanting to be sure they knew exactly where to find Malfoy: “He works in that club a little further down the street.”
Draco knew he’d missed Harry the year before to a certain extent, when they hadn’t seen each other at all, but that had been
When Harry checked the time, he found to his dismay that he was going to be late for his afternoon class.
So that’s how Harry and Draco ended up in a Muggle hotel. It wasn’t completely high end but still posh enough for Harry to feel slightly uncomfortable. He thought that Draco might like it, though, and, well, the money was hardly a problem. Even if the Ministry never paid him back, Harry had more of it than he could ever spend in a lifetime.
“Ah, there you go.” The bartender said next, his head indicating where Malfoy had just reappeared, probably just back from the gents.
“So I hear you’re going to work at St Mungo’s,” Charlie stated next. He was even closer now and Draco should probably feel crowded, but he didn’t, not exactly.
“You didn’t think Harry could really love you, now did you?” Nott asked without actually expecting an answer. “That powder is my own invention. It’s rather funny actually: it will make you, well,
“Is there actually something you’re asking me? Because ‘so’ is not really a question, now is it?” Draco knew he was being wilfully difficult, but he needed to be sure. Needed to know that the question he thought was there, was actually the one that Harry was asking.
Draco didn’t really know whether he’d manage to keep standing long enough to actually take a shower, but he
A way of interacting that Malfoy now seemed to have decided had been a particularly bad idea: it was almost like they were back in school again.
Last Friday Malfoy had declined Harry’s invitation, because he’d already had lunch, but that most probably wouldn’t be the case now. Too early. So perhaps Malfoy would be more inclined to join Harry today.
Luna nodded. “Males tend to grow into their Veela heritage later than females, much like normal puberty, really. So, whereas females usually make the transition before they’re 17 or sometimes 18, in males it can take up to their twentieth birthday. You’re almost twenty, aren’t you?”
Inside it was dark and damp, condensed water clinging to the walls. Harry chanced a small Lumos, barely visible on the tip of his wand, but enough to at least know where they were going, where the way lead.
Inside even the reception desk looked posh, marble and all, and Harry couldn’t shake the impression that the lady receiving him, didn’t quite think he looked like he belonged there.
And Malfoy knew, nodding, albeit slowly, tentatively. “You’d have to come, I take it,” he stated and they both knew it was true, but they also both knew Harry was not going to back out of this one.
a rather large one: it has a wingspan of at least 15 inches,” Draco mumbled, feeling the need to defend himself and his dragonfly.
Harry could still feel the remorse, the pain of his guilt, coursing through him, even though he knew it had all been a dream.
“They’re asking for you back in room three,” a young mediwitch he hadn’t seen before, said a bit sheepishly. She probably also realised he wasn’t even supposed to be here anymore. “Someone has been brewing an unknown potion in his living room and it exploded. His whole family was there.”
When he came into what he knew was the club that Blaise Zabini had started around three or four years ago, it, however, was exactly as he had expected it to be: loud and hot. Furthermore it proved exceedingly difficult to find anyone in there, the strobes making it hard to actually see.
The man looked at Harry as if he thought Harry had gone round a particularly nasty bend. “I honestly don’t have a clue. You don’t really expect me to keep track of all my neighbours, do you?”
There really was no reason not to, because since they’d shared that first night together, being apart didn’t cause them any discomfort anymore.
Malfoy in the meantime went into his room again to sit on the end of the bed, the girl hopping on next to him. The door was still open, because otherwise their legs wouldn’t fit. Malfoy smiled. “Well, let’s have a look at your French books. What did you cover this week?”
Harry was still watching Draco, being drawn in by his eyes, so close now that he could make out the specks of darker grey and blue hidden in the silver. Draco’s eyes were beautiful and for now Harry felt like they were all he needed, like he could drown in them and never have to come to the surface again.
She just nodded. “Of course, sir.” Then she started walking to the lifts and Harry followed, dutifully taking his own luggage.
“Okay, it’s not very good, no,” Harry said and when he looked up at Malfoy, Malfoy’s face was doing a whole array of expressions in fast succession that Harry didn’t even try to understand. Eventually his face evened out.
By some kind of miracle Draco and Harry had only gotten into work a few minutes late, both going into their own departments before joining each other for lunch in the Ministry canteen. This time they’d been joined there by both Ron and Hermione and just like last time it had been rather good, everybody talking easily, seemingly not particularly bothered by Draco being there.
Then ducked, because Nott had apparently turned his attention towards him, while around them the fighting had started once more: wizards and witches firing spells everywhere.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at him for a brief moment, while he managed to look wary, puzzled and slightly pained all at the same time. There was a beat of silence. Then he proceeded to take out his phone.
When Harry woke the next day, it was to the feel of Draco’s body warm against his. It was something that even after all those months still managed to make him unequivocally happy.
Harry was glad he could already see the nasty looking bush they wanted to have a closer look at this evening.
So they both ended up in Draco’s kitchen, making a few sandwiches together. It was an easier task than Draco would have thought: Harry spreading mustard and cream cheese on some slices of bread and Draco topping them with lettuce and ham or smoked salmon.
Then they jumped out, each from a different side, starting their game of cast and run again. There seemed to be wizards and witches everywhere, but most of them didn’t appear to be real guards which more often than not made them fairly easy to disarm.
“Do you also come here to, you know, pull people?” Harry felt an odd need to ask. He couldn’t help but think that, if Malfoy actually
“Ah, yes, so you still live in the old Black house,” Malfoy said, obviously completely in control once again, his words seemingly no more than an observation. Harry was only surprised at his knowledge for a very brief moment, before realising Narcissa Malfoy’s maiden name was Black. Of course Malfoy would know the house at Grimmauld Place had been owned by the Black family.
“Hey.” Harry smiled and Draco smiled right back, the softness of night still lingering. Harry decided to just give into it, brushing a stray strand of blonde out of Draco’s face. Harry didn’t think he’d imagined the short gasp that followed.
“I was on my way out.” Draco just said instead, his voice much too gravelly with sleep to his own liking.
But Blaise had just kept coming over. After their shared eighth year at Hogwarts, Draco had more or less expected him to stay away, too. Blaise had wanted to become an Unspeakable and Draco had been quite aware that being friends with the likes of him wasn’t going to help. It hadn’t deterred Blaise though and although Draco would never tell Blaise, he was eternally grateful for that, for their friendship.
Draco was still at the bar - the far end of it, slightly in the shadows - leaning against it more out of necessity than out of choice by now, when he started at the sound of a large bowl of now undefinable food hitting the floor. Then laughter, energetic and joyous.
Lisa really looked concerned and it was exactly how Harry felt. They just watched each other like that for a moment, apparently coming to the same conclusion.
Harry had already fallen asleep - after eating a burger, that wasn’t on the menu, but that he’d asked for anyway – when he noticed the wards of the suite that he’d set up earlier, because he figured that was part of his job as a bodyguard, flare up.
This didn’t really ease Harry’s confusion, so Malfoy added: “They’re just the usual things, you know. It’s why I moved to the Continent in the first place.”
mind,” Harry said, his eyes filled with humour and something Draco should definitely not consider right now.
“Hey,” Potter said, looking up, when Draco walked into his office. His door had been wide open - Draco hadn’t even had to knock - and Potter was smiling that slightly tentative thing again. Draco found it kept unsettling him, because every time he saw it, he thought it would be the last.
And Harry got up, apparently having registered somewhere at the back of his mind that the fourth wizard had gone out the side somewhere.
“And you know it’s better that way just as well as I do,” Draco answered. He didn’t tell Blaise the rest, the way people didn’t want to be seen with him, the way they would sometimes be friendly and only then realise who he was, what he stood for. Which inevitably meant they would start shunning him.
Harry had expected Hermione to agree to that easily, but instead she was silent for a short while before answering: “Well, I don’t know. He
It was some time after Luna had left and Harry had dutifully returned to his casefiles, that he was suddenly completely alert: someone, or something, had been trying to pass his Wards.
Malfoy gave him an all too familiar smirk, but somehow it also held the same playfulness from before. “Of course not. Although I think I might get the easy way out of that one: Blaise’ll probably have left by now, having run off with someone for the night.” There was a short silence. Then he added, softly: “We usually come here together, but we hardly ever leave together.” Harry couldn’t really make out what Malfoy thought of that.
Harry smiled at him again, and it was all soft and sweet. “Okay,” then the humour was back, ”I bet that whole Veela wing thing takes a lot of energy.”
“Kendrick,” Zabini had this way of whispering annoyingly loudly sometimes. Harry looked around. Zabini was holding up a book of some kind. “Their log.” Zabini said and opened it: “They’ve logged all their experimental recipes.”
“No,” Harry’s voice was genuinely shocked now. “No, I think you’d be brilliant at it. It’s just, well, you’re going to be out of the country a lot. Bill used to be everywhere but here when he worked for Gringotts at first.” Harry stopped, just for a beat, adding hastily: “It must be hard on your mother.”
Before, it had felt rather important that Harry went there, to Draco’s flat, but when he’d actually had the address, he hadn’t been so sure anymore. Being a Gryffindor, Harry’d still gone eventually, though, and now he was here, having miraculously Apparated directly into Draco’s flat of which the Wards must obviously be malfunctioning, because they had let him in without a hitch.
Then Mathew Dean suddenly stepped into view, startling Draco out of his thoughts. Mathew was combing the garden, securing it and Draco involuntarily took a step back into the porch, not feeling ready to be seen yet, somehow.
Malfoy’s jaw clenched a bit. He was not quite meeting Harry’s gaze. “That’s okay too. I-. Well, we don’t actually get along, now do we?” There was a slight sadness to his tone and Harry looked at him, for the first time since all of this had begun he really looked.
It was when Draco thought of something, panic starting to rise. “Do you know whether my mother has been informed? You know, of my, well, situation?”
He thought he saw Potter relax just a bit, which made sense. He was probably exceedingly glad Draco had declined.
Harry was on the floor, unmoving, seemingly hit by a spell, but still keeping the Time-Turner close, which of course was exactly what the stupid git would do: keeping this thing safe, even if he wasn’t able to protect himself.
“So what did you and Luna conclude? You know, about me? About us?” Draco’s voice mostly sounded in control again, but he could also hear the uncertainty underneath.
“But you don’t like me in that way?” Harry now pressed, knowing that this might be the only moment he’d be able to get any answers, the only time Draco might be inclined to answer his questions.
Draco visibly tensed, turning away from Harry and dressing at top speed. “No. No, I’m not.” His voice sounded thick, probably with sleep and for some reason Harry felt like asking him to come back to bed.
So the time had come for him to leave and Harry felt relieved. He might not know what he was getting himself into exactly, but there had been very few incidences in the past where he actually had. Besides he was going to see Draco, albeit in his Glamour: he was going to know whether the prat was okay.
“I haven’t made tea yet. I take coffee and, well, you always were rather particular about your tea.”
Once home Draco changed out of his robes and into a pair of trousers that were tailored to fit to perfection - even though they were remarkably comfortable to wear - combining them with a fitted, white shirt that he left open at the collar.
