He closes his eyes. Arms wide open, he can feel the pull in his stomach when he jumps. A gust of cold wind flings snow into his face. He can feel everything slowing around him, the swish-swoosh of air, the flutter of his clothes, his misty hair wavering. He can feel himself falling, everything around him freezing into place slowly like a puzzle solving itself. Draco lets himself fall freely with a knowing smile on his face.
It took a lot of convincing and assurances from Harry to make Draco finally apply for his apprenticeship.
“How exactly do you plan on doing that? With your natural power of aversion?”
Harry feels something akin to a familial bond in the room, something he’s felt for so few people before, when they all cheer and call him Sterling. It’s sort of the perfect moment for him and for everyone else, too. A perfect coming out story.
Harry doesn’t
“Lovely,” Malfoy says at Harry’s side. “Love the idea of going to die in a forest where we’ve already almost died.”
The less awesome part is getting naked. Harry’s never really been naked in front of anyone before, not even Ron, and his body’s so damaged now that he grows nervous, but Draco has no reservations. He strips casually and his back is so thin and boney that Harry nearly gasps. He could count every rib and vertebra beneath his skin if he had the mind to.
Hermione tracks Harry down.
on the room to silence the music or McGonagall would have surely been back already, so Harry lifts his arms and, already breathless, dances with Draco in the circle of his arms as they sing lyrics into the already loud room.
Always you.
Harry doesn’t mind taking an icy shower as long as Draco is as comfortable as can be.
“Good night,” Harry whispers after turning off the lights. “Sweet dreams and all.”
“I kinda like it. Makes you look mysterious.”
“Where are we going?” Ron asks, looking miserable. “I’m not done with my sandwich.”
“I’m sure this is only the beginning for both of us,” is all Harry can bring himself to say, wrapping an arm around Draco's waist and burying his face in his neck. “It’s going to be a long weekend.”
All he wants is to make sure Draco’s safe, that he’s out of harm’s way, that he’s at Harry’s side. Somehow, he’ll have to figure out how to make sure everyone gets the message that Draco’s not like that anymore, that he’s working on himself and succeeding.
Draco will be the saviour this time. He'll finally do some good to start evening out the evil he's done in his short existence. In just 19 years, he's done so much bad, but making up for it begins here. Begins with saving the saviour's life.
“What the
They’re both in no shape to run, so they’re easily winded by the time they reach their room, which isn’t truly that far away from the common room. Harry leans against the door frame after shutting the door and pants, absolutely exhausted. He really can’t wait to fucking sleep.
"But, uh, anyway I took your rejection so personally that it infiltrated my thoughts. My actions. My words. Even my dreams were full of you, though at that point I wanted to turn you into a chipmunk.”
His body is exhausted, but he knows Draco’s done this for him, so he has to wake him up. There’s no way around it.
McGonagall’s eyes linger on him and then move on. He smiles tragically at the look on her face.
When Harry escapes this hellish forest, he plans on writing a long letter to Newt Scammander advising him to look into the lives of plangentine trees and see if they are really trees or actual beings.
It’s not mine.”
“Agreed.” Harry missed him, too, is what that means. “Wanna try something?”
“What’re you doing?” Harry asks, wondering if Draco plans to toss himself down.
“I want a biscuit,” Draco announces suddenly. “A biscuit and some tea.”
“You’re so lucky you didn’t die on me!” He says into his ear, tears in his eyes. “You’d have fucking
“I’m in love with you, too, you idiot.” And steps forward to kiss him.
Looks like he’s taken his anguish and built himself a better body with it where Harry let his tear him apart.
“Are you marrying Hermione?” He asks bluntly, voice dry. “Maybe you should have mentioned that.”
No one would miss him for long and that’s just a fact. A sad, sobering, realistic fact.
Harry isn’t sure it’s helping either of them, really, but he feels calmer in Draco’s presence, like he’s the Astronomy Tower, only just barely stopped from crumbling to pieces by a couple of enchantments that Draco somehow always remembers to cast.
“I don’t care about my reputation, alright? It’ll never matter to me...not like you do.”
Harry pauses, listens as the song builds and falls. Then sighs.
“Maybe,” Draco says agreeably. “Toss me one?”
Harry scowls at him, pushes off the wall with all the ferocity he can muster. All of his usual fatigue is gone, because no one is mean to Malfoy
Harry doesn’t know what haunts Draco, not exactly, but he imagines there’s at least one familiar character in both of their nightmares. And his name isn’t Severus Snape.
Something innocent and happy.
And then Harry shows Draco Malfoy how to pack a bowl in a castle at half two in the bloody morning. And then he shows him how to smoke it from the balcony of an expensive room in the bitter cold with only the tip of his wand to light it.
“What?” Harry rests his hand on Draco’s bedpost to steady himself.
Harry’s anxiety lessens more, but still he doesn’t sleep. Draco dozes off after a while, wrapped up in his sleeping bag, and tosses frequently, obviously not entirely calmed by the hotsy.
“I missed you, too, Potter,” is what he says. “God, you look good in that suit.”
When Harry sees the way the light reflects in Draco’s eyes, he finally identifies the creature, small now in stature, but once so big it filled the room.
The 7th years are abuzz with excitement, because they aren’t the ones being trapped in the forest. But, again, Harry’s not worried. He’s fine. Is just glad he brought his coat to breakfast.
It’s become such a routine that neither of them even notice that they used to sleep alone.
Harry’s still sick to his stomach that Draco could take the fruit while the tree wailed so incredibly, but he has to eat, so he does. He eats a strip of beef that’s way too salty for him and then a pack of water biscuits that he spreads with cheese. He saves Draco half of his meager meal and drinks an entire container of water.
“Will you stay with me?”
, then,” Harry says with as much amusement as he can muster. “Also I sing in the shower.”
“I love to sit up here in the Summer,” he says softly, panting a little. “When it’s warm and dark and it smells like rain.”
Harry Potter... Thinking about him was difficult for Draco, because thinking about him brought all the memories and decisions, choices and the dreams, the nightmares that haunted him. Potter was the symbol of everything he had stood against.
And after three months of building their relationship, a small walk outside the castle made him panic and run away with god knows what and then stop in his tracks to stand, still contemplating what to do. He was in love with Harry. He could feel something heavy in his heart lift when he said that aloud.
"Your glimmering faith will lead you to your happy ending. I heard you: your persistence for once is not behind but ahead."
Draco fidgeted, standing behind his desk. He could feel a gentle magic, like a mother's caresses touching his mental barrier. Draco grabbed hold of his desk corner tightly that his knuckles turned white. He tried to keep the barrier up, but the smooth touch penetrated it without any force. Draco panicked and he could feel himself shifting forward. He heard a slow whisper in his mind, stopping all his panicking thoughts. Draco was glued to his place, his heart beating fast, eyes wide in fear as he tried to push the voice out of his head. He gathered every ounce of his courage, to look straight at the black-hooded figure standing behind the closed door. It didn't have a face just a black hallow mist in its place, blue shimmering light instead of eyes. Its hands were covered with long sleeves and above them was silver armour with different rune patterns sculpted onto it. The robe was long enough to cover or hide its feet.
"I miss it, my home, my parents, my father. when I am
But their odd meetings let Harry know more about Draco likes and preferences. Draco likes sweets but does indulge himself to have more than one as he couldn’t control his sugar intake. His favourite colour was actually red and that he does not like green at all more to Harry’s amusement.
"Who are you?" Draco managed without stammering through clattering teeth due to the coldness that seeped inside his body. He heard whispers but he couldn't understand even single word. His head started throbbing, right now he wanted all this jolting pain to stop.
He was about to turn when he felt the prickling in his neck again. Draco stood rooted to his spot, coffee in one hand, his wand held tightly in the other, ready to cast a Shielding Charm. He discreetly wiped the cold sweat that had formed on his forehead and maintained his unaffected posture. Slowly he moved back towards his desk, ignoring the figure that stood at the door. He placed his mug on the table and watched it out the corner of his eye. When it moved he barely stopped himself from flinching away.
People kept approaching him as if they knew him, asking him random and even personal questions, following him and his opinions blindly. They never even asked him if he was interested in talking with him, and they just assume that it was okay to bother him, regardless of the time and place.
He shared how the Minister of Magic has been forcing him to get more involved in ministry affairs by attending official functions, being a guest of honor for the events he knows nothing about, or asking for his opinion, and sometimes his support, on political matters, and even pressuring him to join the auror force.
Harry’s attention, his affection: once he felt them he knew he craved them not for the first time. He realised he was always in love with his idiot, with his Harry.
Bang!
Meanwhile, the front door closes behind them, like a blanket enveloping them in their own world.
Draco heard the faint voice again.
The moment he opened his eyes, instinctively his eyes landed on that person. Wrapped in a red shawl that covered most of his lower face, messy long black hair covering his forehead, black robe swirling around him, rubbing his hands for body heat and smiling happily at something his friend said, stood Harry Potter, his boyfriend. Who as if feeling him looking, turned to greet him, a soft private smile only for him spreading across his face. Those green eyes deepened and they stared at him, making blood rush to his cheeks and neck.
"Potter." It is a rarity for him that he cannot think of a single thing to say.
Draco closed his house front door as hard and fast as he could and stood there, taking heavy breaths as he swallowed. His stiff shoulders relaxed gradually as he strode to the nearest Apparition Point, away from his disappointed parents. He inhaled the moist air and concentrated on his destination. Draco could still hear his father's shouts echo behind him.
"...e"
Its spring starting here. I am currently sitting under at peach blossom tree. The light pink colour of its flowers lightens the whole place, Harry, The sweet honey scent of its blossoms reminds me of you, it makes me want to just relax under it and lay here the whole day. I miss you Harry. Just two more months. I know you are counting days and I am looking forward to meeting you soon.
With all convection they could muster, Harry and Draco decided to see what they can do now. They both do not want to end their relationship here, they were exactly the same, had the same life values, and felt their life long partner in each other. So they decided to give it a go. They might not meet each other for two years, and being in a long distance relationship was a truest tester of time. They might feel the distance and be incomplete without each other, but their end goal will be for them to be together.
**** end ****
Draco glared at him, flushing embarrassed, realising he said that aloud.
Their days went by just like that, sometimes they talked about the war, but they never go deep into it and just tip toed around with each topic. They would graze through the conversation, and would simply change the subject, if the other showed even a slight reluctance or uneasiness. Maybe they were both feeling it- How they are starting to come alive after surviving a war with scars beyond imagination. They understood each other’s small movements, the small twitch of their eyebrows or the tapping of their fingers, upward curl of their lips or blank look on their face. They both knew when there was need to stay quiet, and leave things be, as they both get lost in thoughts they have reserved only to themselves. Things left unsaid by one of them can be filled by the other, and when one becomes too consumed by his thoughts, the other one simply snaps his fingers in front of them to bring them back to their silently observation of the world passing around them. They did not push each other to reveal what they were thinking; instead they kept silent and listened to their unspoken words with understanding.
Harry smiled so widely that his cheeks hurt. He stroked the head of the owl, he whispered, "I miss him, too. so much."
When Harry woke up, he felt refreshed, his heart ached thinking about parting from Draco, but he knows this was something that has to be done. With His heart full of love, Harry knows he can withstand their separation as he was not alone in this. Draco was with him, had said, whispered each time in his ears, his love his love, his feelings. Draco bared himself open for Harry to see and Harry did the same. Harry aimed to treasure every second of their remaining time before Draco leaves for France.
"I am sorry."
Then, in a blink of an eye, he was swept away. Harry stared at the empty space that once occupied his Draco, eyes filled with tears and lips parted. He silently said the words he longed to say with his heart,
They sat in silence, neither of them, talking some time until Draco softly said: "You know, I saw you shining, when you defeated the Dark Lord. Everyone wanted to follow your light and your steps; they wanted to be strong just like you and share the glory."
in Greek. People were affected in a weird sort of way by the encounters with the shadow. They either got suddenly cured from a chronic illness that had had no treatment. Or they died with a peaceful smile frozen on their face.
Harry smiled at Draco and explained: "Sirius always said that he would renovate Grimmauld place; that he didn’t like the dark walls or a house full of dark artefacts. He wanted a home to live in, and not a horror house."
He hears someone clearing their throat and he has to try very hard to look away from this handsome man in front of him. Only then does he realise that they are standing in a very large crowd that has just kept on growing. Blaise is staring at him with his boring cool mask but his eyes betray him, glinting at him teasingly. Pansy is smirking at him and Draco can feel the heat creeping its way from his cheek to his neck. He can feel himself flushing all over and tries to hide himself as subtly as possible without giving anything away to the crowd, while he is failing miserably, much to the amusement of his boyfriend who is chuckling at his antics, to escape the group that is approaching them. Just when this couldn't get any better he hears headmistress Minerva McGonagall’s voice from the crowd. Draco wants nothing but for the ground to open and swallow him whole.
The times they spent together slowly changed their relationship from enemies to friends which later nurtured into something beyond what they both saw coming.
...love you."
He takes a moment to just gaze at the sky, his thoughts floating around a Draco. Eventually he shakes his head, snapping out of his thoughts, figuring he should probably head inside. As he enters, molly passes by him patting his shoulder in a motherly fashion. he grabs a drink from a floating tray (courtesy of one of the elves) and clinks his glass with Ron’s as he meets him sitting on the couch. Just as Harry was about to settle beside him, he hears a knock at the door. Harry puts down his wine glass and walks towards the door and sees who it is, he stands frozen, gripping the handle as tight as possible; his eyes blurring, his heart beating fast against his ribcage. Before him, he sees the only person he has been thinking and wanting the whole time.
Draco's grey eye shone and he smiled, his face full of light, his pale skin glowing under the golden orb rising from the horizon. Draco’s entire self looked relaxed under the warm radiance of the sun.
They stand there, breathing each other. A soft laugh echoes through the walls, and with their hands intertwined, Harry leads Draco inside the house.
"Mate! come on, I am starving," Weasley shouted and walked ahead of them waving his hand to follow.
Draco picked up a red file that was lying on his desk, with a picture of a blurry black shadow. For the past several days, the dark shadow had made various appearances in wizarding society, always without leaving a trace. Only some rune-written word was left behind. 'Pistos' it read which Draco deciphered as
"Long time, Malfoy." Potter grabs a few papers from the ground and hands them to Draco.
A loud tapping on the window disrupted the silence in his bedroom, startling Harry. He dropped the pen he was holding and immediately stood up from his desk to check the source of the noise and recognized the white owl tapping on his window. He opened the window for the owl, and she gently flew inside his room, perching herself on his shoulder. He removed the letter tied to her leg and gave her some treats to eat from his side table. She nibbled his ear affectionately while he sat down at the corner of his bed, tracing the letter with his thumb fondly.
This was a regular occurrence in Harry’s life, and he was just tired being at the centre, and felt exhausted just making appearance itself. Harry just wanted for the attention to stop and to have enough space to find himself. He felt like a part of him was lost in the war and he thinks he will never be able to get it back.
* * *
with love,
One of the thing Harry learned from his past was that communication is very important in any relationship.
It is on one such day when Harry, after getting his usual coffee, stops walking midway to his regular table, he sees Malfoy, seated where he usually sat. Harry had not met Malfoy, since the Malfoy’s trial after the war. He has testified for Draco Malfoy and his mother about Draco not identifying him in the Malfoy Manor and Narcissa had saved his life in the forbidden forest. Harry’s words and memories helped the two Malfoys, and they were let off with payment of fine and community service as reparation for their actions during the war. Harry and Draco both nodded at each other after the trial ended and Harry left the courtroom without a backward glance.
Draco tried talking to him but he did not seem to hear him. All Harry can think about was Draco leaving him. Harry started panicking, and he could hardly look at Draco. His lips go dry and he clears his throat. They have just now realized their feelings. He wants more time to spend with him. He wants to keep telling Draco about his feelings, to go on more many dates with him, to hold Draco in his arms, and talk about anything and everything.
The next day, Harry woke up to the sound of constant knocking at his front door. He attempted to ignore the loud banging early in the morning, but eventually gave up. He sighed and reluctantly got out of the bed to answer the loud knocks on his door, and saw Draco standing in front of him. Still sleepy, he let Draco pull him inside his home and groaned. He grumpily mumbled out the direction of his bedroom as Draco asked and let himself be steered by a cheerful Draco around his home. He let Draco rifle through his closet and wore whatever article of clothes Draco threw at him.
The air around them shifted. Theo stopped bouncing his foot and glanced at him and Blaise shifted around his bed making space enough for all three of them to lay in. Without a word Theo walked in and lay on the other side with Draco in the middle. Blaise pulled up the blanket and tucked all of them in. They lay together in silence.
Harry stood beside him, letting the meaning of Draco’s words sink in as he watched the sun spread its light throughout the sky and brightened the world. As the orange Light fell on his face, Harry’s eyes became wet; something in him snapped at the breath-taking view in front of him. The light that touched him warmed his cold heart, growing a seed of new hope, of a new day and Harry smiled genuinely for the first time.
Harry turned to look at him, Draco looked back with so much understanding, no pity. just sympathy.
"What happened?"
A piece of parchment started fluttering by the wind, Dear Draco, was written with messy hand writing in green ink. No other words followed, as the writer prepared for bed. The silence of the whole room disrupted by the sound of the breeze sending the parchment swirling fluttering down to the floor.
Their relationship was even more complicated because of his jumbled thoughts and tangle of emotions, not to mention that they had the burden of the past and the baggage they carry from war. They were still healing, he can’t burden Draco too much with his feelings now, and ask about their future together, when he knew that Draco had to leave and pursue his dream without any regrets or second guesses.
Draco stilled, just as he had come up with what he was about to utter. His heart racing, he paled and hurried inside, vaguely aware that he had said nothing as an excuse.
Harry is celebrating Christmas with his loved ones. It has been three weeks since Draco wrote to Harry and dropped the bomb that he has also been offered the position as Potion Professor at Hogwarts. Since then, Draco has not sent another letter to Harry; but Harry still waits patiently for Draco’s owl.
They know that their new start has begun: Draco has come back; they have their future together waiting for them. Harry grips Draco’s hand tightly, and smiles at him, looking forward to their future full of love, hope, dreams.
The soft golden lights scattered around the garden, illuminated Draco’s face, his blonde hair sparkled, as Draco opened his eyes, his grey eyes softened, and he gave Harry a blinding smile. Harry’s heart pounded widely, he felt butterflies in his stomach, and a cold shiver ran through his body. Something in him that was dim and withering was ignited back to life, taking his breathe away.
Frozen by his side, Harry heard Draco's soft voice.
Not even a week after their eighth year started, Harry became his friend. After several casual talks, group studies and leisure flying hours together, slowly their friendship bloomed into something else. They could feel the changes, the attraction, need and closeness all pointed towards something different, in simple want for something, to be more than just friends. Draco could feel it; he knew Harry could too and Harry with all his Gryffindor courage had confessed that he liked him and wanted to try this, whatever this was between them. After coming back for eighth year wanting a silent and peaceful year away from the world outside, this was the last thing Draco had expected. Harry Potter had asked him out and he said yes.
Weasley pecked Granger on the cheek, and she was blushing red smiles back at him. Behind them Draco saw a black-hooded figure. Its heated gaze sent shivers through him, he blinked to see the blurry figure more clearly but it vanished.
"STOP," he shouted. At the back of his mind he knew that no one could see this figure here, inside his room. Not even his partner came busting in.
As they both walk side by side, Draco looks ahead, to a new beginning.
"I am tired, Draco. They lurk around me like a constant shadow, always there, always waiting to get any piece of me they can get their hands on."
He closed his eyes, reminiscing his days together with Draco. His thoughts brought a warm smile to his face.
Harry and Draco were sitting at their usual table, sipping their hot coffee, Harry reading the Daily Prophet, when Draco hummed and shared to him that he would like to watch sunrise on the hill in muggle London he once visited as a kid. Harry simply shrugged as a reply, but he caught a glimpse of an unusual grin on Draco’s face. They parted ways soon after.
Draco stood—he couldn't stop himself even If he wanted to—and ran outside, skittered towards the Gryffindor portrait and stopped. For a brief second he stood there watching the portrait snore.
“—Sir Bumblebee,” Draco corrected, pinching the bridge of his nose, “—And we need to leave now. It’s your first day and we still need to get you all sorted. We missed the welcome party when we visited Mémère in France.” Not that it was expressly their fault. They were scheduled to be in London during the original orientation, but missed the second owl sent to inform them that the date had been moved up. It was all rather unprofessional, not to mention outdated. Draco had been very clear when leaving his email address in the administrative office, that it was his preferred method of contact. Second to his cellular phone, which had both remained annoyingly silent of notifications.
“My goddaughter,“ Potter confirmed with a fond chuckle. He rubbed the nape of his neck and stepped further away from the bustle of the classroom, where twenty or so kids were spread in groups among the desks, cubbies, and learning stations. Indecision seemed to waver across his brow. There was no doubt, Potter was trying to find the most delicate approach to his questions.
With their decision getting firmer each second, they determine to make their relationship work. They have a long list of unsaid conversation and promises and goals ahead but one thing was sure that they can find comfort into, their love for each other. Harry sighs as Draco wrapped his arms around him, he leans his head on his chest letting Draco's whispers wrap him like a blanket.
Harry congratulated him, wrapping his arms around his neck and bringing their lips together, Draco enthusiastically kissing him back. Then it drawn on him that Draco will be leaving for France and would have to spend two years to complete his apprenticeship.
Wiping tears from his face, he settled in his chair.
Draco stares at him, shocked and with a sense of déjà-vu. Those green eyes watch him, and his whole face lights up. Draco is too stunned to even reply.
Harry says nothing. He has nothing to say. Nothing left to give.
“It’s not a permanent fix, but yes. I can take it until I get better. Until the nightmares lessen.”
“Oh, my God,” he says. “Oh, my God.”
“What if I’m tired of being mysterious?”
Something slams into Draco’s quivering form and knocks the wind out of his chest. The song is so loud, even though Draco is sure Potter cast a
Draco’s name is first.
“I was looking for you, you twat! Where were you?”
is beginning to wear off and his fingers are cold.
“A pepper-up potion?” Ron’s asking. “Perhaps that’ll do the trick?”
Adults, Harry thinks. So oblivious to what’s right in front of their faces.
Harry can still feel claws on his skin and teeth in his flesh, turned into a chew toy for a man who is more wolf than human, more animal than person. He can still taste his own blood on his tongue as he gagged on it, as the creature tore him apart, tendon by tendon.
Crookshanks made a reappearance after Harry’s most recent
“Fucking hell, Harry.” Draco shakes his head. “You’re unbelievable. Truly.”
Draco says nothing. Harry hugs his cloak to his chest, jaw shaking. He’s not going to cry. He isn’t even sure why he feels tears gathering in his eyes. Why the sob starts to build in his chest.
“Good,” Harry grins, feeling better already. “Let’s go eat dinner before Ron thinks you’ve murdered me.”
Old Harry, Pre-War Harry, might have done just that here. But this Harry? This broken, battered thing with as many wounds as a dart board Harry? He doesn’t give a fuck about Albus’ memory.
“I...I could try, I guess.”
He’s sitting in the dining hall with Draco, Luna, and Pansy at the end of the eighth year table. There’s a plate of uneaten food in front of him that he’s trying to find the stomach to eat, but he just. Can’t. Also there’s a newspaper in Susan Bones’ hands in the seat diagonal to him that’s he’s trying to avoid reading, but he can’t escape the large bold headline.
Harry senses the meeting is over, so when everyone’s looking away at McGonagall’s tense face, he slips on his invisibility cloak and disappears, unable to bear one more second of this hell.
be cool to see a manticore. Of course, he wouldn’t want to be fucking eaten by one, but. Semantics.
How one person could be so elegant and effortless, Harry doesn’t know. She amazes him every time.
When Draco cries out again, Harry says his name a little louder. Harsher. Starts to worry.
“I know. It used to feel so...so happy. Now all I can think about is how forlorn it is.”
“No one can hurt you now, okay? I’ve got you.”
“I have, Patches. It’s lovely to see you again.”
“No, but I assumed.”
Harry kisses down over his pajamas, down over the seams until he’s level with Draco’s dick. He takes a moment to look up at Draco, to make sure he’s okay, and he’s watching Harry back. He nods his head and Harry forges on.
Harry must nod or say yes or something, because he finds himself inside, seated on the ground with a bottle of water in his hand. Strange.
After dessert, Harry helps Draco clean up the dishes and wash them magically, which feels somehow wasteful. There’s a dishwasher for a reason and it’s not like the Malfoys can’t afford to use it, you know?
After a while, she seems to calm down, to be deeply in thought. And then she shushes everyone with the spell
All he feels is nothing. Emptiness. Hollow. Vast, endless exhaustion. Entropy.
“Fine. How about I make you my best man and we call it even?”
“Be my boyfriend, Potter,” he whispers. “I’ll make it worth your while.”
“No, no. It’s okay.” Harry clenches his jaw and his fists, crumbling the letter up into a ball. “I guess old habits die hard, right?”
Harry sighs gently, fatigued even by standing beside Draco’s bed, and nods.
“What?” Draco asks, smiling softly, gently.
(p.s i finished editing this just now, so if u find any flaws, let me know! i don't have a beta, so any mistakes are my own)
pining for the cupboard under the fucking stairs?
“How do you know?”
Harry rolls his eyes, but sings it nonetheless, “Don’t eat a / Poinsettia / If you do / you better / be ready / to get a tummy ache.”
which Harry allows to hit him. He feels it on his skin like bugs and then Draco’s wand flies off towards him. He picks it up and stares at it in his thin, pale hand.
“What the hell are
He just wants some peace and fucking quiet.
“G’night, Draco.”
“Let’s talk, yeah?”
“Fucking hell,” Harry says in exhaustion when the door finally shuts between him and the others. “Why did I come back?”
Harry’s face must show the pain, must be absolutely wrecked, because Draco’s mouth softens. He tries to take it back, make his words gentler, but it doesn’t work. Harry starts to get angry again.
“Now eat your eggs,” he says firmly.
Harry can see the dark circles under his eyes, the hollows of his cheeks. Can almost feel the exhaustion seeping off of him.
Harry’s relieved to be in a place with no bad memories, though, with nothing causing anxiety to flare up in his chest, and he can see relief on the faces of some of the others, as well.
“I just—I can’t.”
She steps toward Harry, a woman as beautiful as the passage of time itself, and hugs him to her, warm and inviting and somehow loving. Her embrace feels a lot like Mrs. Weasley’s, though she smells like sharp daisies and sparkling cider. She whispers into his ear as they hug for a long moment.
Harry wakes to the blinding sunlight in his eyes. His curtains are drawn back and the sun shines bright as ever, even for late winter. It’s beautiful.
It’s the same suit Narcissa gave him for Christmas, but with a black button-up instead. It fits him almost the same, if not a bit looser, and he still feels good in it.
“Where were you?” Harry asks quietly.
“Where are we going?” Harry asks, feeling more tired than he has ever felt.
“Thank you.”
McGonagall calls a meeting early in the morning on the final day of classes.
Draco’s hand touches Harry’s so so so gently and Harry lifts him to his feet. He’s still bleeding from a cut on his forehead and his nose, but Harry takes care of that with the most powerful
all that time ago. It is small, not quite as small as the miniature dragons from the Triwizard Tournament, but still formidable.
His lungs are burning and his eyes ache and his chest is on fire. He drops Draco’s letter to the ground, crumpled into a tight ball, to wipe at his eyes, embarrassed that he’d cared so much for someone he used to despise so thoroughly. He should’ve trusted his instincts, should’ve listened to his gut feeling the day he met Malfoy. Untrustable. Cowardly. Disgusting.
on the woods, that he can’t think, can't see, can't breathe. All he can hear are the lyrics, twisted so darkly in the Dark Lord’s mouth as he sang, as Nagini curled languidly around his torso and shoulders and down his arm.
“Your final grades will be announced tomorrow morning. For now, return to your dormitory and get cleaned up. Food will be brought up to your room, so you’re fully ready for your congratulatory party tomorrow afternoon. Good job, boys, and good night.”
Draco leads Harry through the winding hallways of his newest home to the kitchen where they gorge on decorated gingerbread men and hot tea. They laugh when the Malfoy’s newest house guest enters to check on the ruckus, thinking they’re being burgled, but it’s just them. Patches, who gets paid for tidying, just looks at them, amusement in his eyes and a smile on his face, as he Disapparates right there with a
an apple.
Harry had wanted the process of what may well be his failure at producing a patronus to be a secret. He didn’t want Draco to see him try and fail at yet another thing.
“The ministry have sent out some guidelines, as well. You will be permitted to take your wand, a bezoar, a few basic potions ingredients that will be given to you on your testing day, a change of clothes, and two pre-brewed potions of your choice—that’s four total—in a bag. Feel free to charm it lighter or bigger on the inside as you see fit, but the contents will be examined before testing. Also, the ministry have introduced new magical wildlife into the Forest, so please be prepared for foreign creatures and venoms! If you think you won’t encounter it, think again! Magical creatures of all types will be placed and removed weekly to maintain the safety of the other students and the diversity of the testing.
“I understand.”
Dead.
Harry sits up, too, and Draco slips his white t-shirt over his head, giving his still damp hair a ruffle with his fingers after with a laugh.
“Today we’re here to finish something you all started almost a decade ago. Something you put so much time and effort into that you didn’t even let a war stop you from completing it. It’s quite incredible to witness your final moments and I want to say how proud I am of all of you for making it this far. I know this is going to be very difficult, that you may struggle with it, but just know you’ve all done harder things. I have faith that you will all come through this with passing marks.”
He felt his throat hurt when mentioning his late godfather, but he did not say anything about it. He talked very little about Sirius. Draco just nodded and looked ahead.
Draco strode fast into his room and paced around in worry. He had come into an revelation. It shook him up and tilted his world and he didn't know what to do or to think about it. He had felt weird and tingly all over from the moment he felt himself accept the realisation that dawned on him.
. As if guessing his thoughts Harry holds his hand, gripping tightly. Draco presses back, feeling foolish, young and wonderfully weightless with it all.
Draco smacked him and sat down beside Blaise.
Ignoring the unusual feeling, Draco entered his office. He nodded to his colleagues and went into his room. His partner came and placed the usual morning coffee on his desk, then left to grab some files that were needed.
Harry felt his face heat up, and his palms started sweating. Harry looked back at the progress of his relationship with Draco, how they were able to understand and empathize with each other’s past and present, how drawn he was to him even after all their disagreements, how he always heard constant buzzing, faint humming whenever he was near him, how the time he spent with Draco felt like passing seconds, invisible like air. He looked straight into those grey eyes that shined, and the whole world blurred, the only thing clear was this person in front of Harry. At the moment, the connection he made with Draco; like strings tugged him in his heart. He knew, he has fallen in love.
Draco couldn't stop the tears that escaped. He leaned forward and pecked his lips softly. "Harry, I think…no...I am in love with you. I have always been in love with you."
It was not like they have not talked about their careers; it’s just that Draco living in another country seemed too sudden. Harry’s mind goes blank with the realization and he cannot even be fully happy to hold Draco’s hand or say something to him.
"H..."
"I...
Draco closed his eyes and let his thoughts and memories flow freely.
* * *
Draco walks briskly reading his files as usual. He contemplates hexing his partner into oblivion for his tackiness when someone slams into him. A strong rose smell assaults his nose and he bends down to collect his scattered papers. Then he hears him.
"Fascinating, isn’t it? The rising sun inspires me. It shows that while there will always be darkness that may loom in the night, morning brightness will shine its way through each time."
"You disappoint me more and more, my son."
Harry falls into him, weightless, and holds him to himself, breathing him in. he slowly tilts his head and kisses him, slowly, openly, and breaking contact only when it became difficult to breathe.
“It is,” Harry agrees.
Draco flies into action, tearing through the house in a run so fast he might as well be flying. He comes to a complete stop in front of his mother, panting and frantic, and cries out.
“You slept through it. Poppy checked you over and said you just needed to rest...so we let you rest.”
“What the
“Okay.”
He feels so suddenly out of place, out of this world, that it exhausts him. The song carries on and he feels more forlorn, even homesick. But for which home?
“What’s up?” Harry asks softly, gently.
“You will be assigned a partner from a different House, assuming we have enough students to do so, who will be your partner all year. You will share a dorm and you will study together. Your partner will be your only assistance in the forest with you, so make friends if you aren’t already.”
“I don’t know. I was fine until we crossed that border...and then I started to feel really uneasy. Sickly, almost.”
Draco’s up in the sky, not quite flying as much as he is floating in one spot mid-air. Looking down at the ground with a solemn look in his eyes and a cigarette in his hand. Harry can see the smoke when he takes a breath.
“I was gonna try and cast a patronus, dipshit.”
“What a nice thing to wake up to,” he says groggily, eyes still shut.
“They were saying you were lying with the enemy.”
Draco says nothing as the lullaby finally ends, still in his own world.
“Night,” Draco says, but he doesn’t turn away or close his eyes.
are its prey.
for the loss of her children.”
He can still hear the Pplangentine’s cries, even from this distance, and knows he will not sleep much tonight.
Harry nods and he starts to cry again.
He knows he should pull away so they can continue talking, but he wants to feel lost in whatever this feeling is that’s building in his chest. Wants so badly to melt away from his anxiety and the stress of it all. So he does. He gives in to something he’s been fighting for almost a decade and it’s better than he could’ve ever imagined.
“Draco,” Harry whispers, not touching him as to not startle him even more. “It’s just a dream. Wake up.”
“Something like that. I just...I got overwhelmed.”
It’s almost a relief.
pompous pureblood energy. Use the M word. It sorta fucked me up, you know, in every imaginable way.
“Sometimes I sit and I draw or write or read. I do a lot of reading, actually, and most of it I do here. In the summer, we have these flowers called
Haven’t they seen at all what’s going on or have they been too absorbed with their stupid, petulant school-things to notice that the only person who has ever loved Draco for who he is and who he was is dead?
No one except for Harry fucking Potter.
His mum, his dad, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Fred, Hermione. He can smell burnt flesh, can feel the heat and finality of the killing curse that he endured twice, Bellatrix's knife in the skin of his forearm, of claws digging into the skin of his face, of his ear being sliced from his head, and drowns under the weight of it all. It’s just too much. Too much death, too much pain, too much malignancy.
Harry spends the later portion of the evening in Draco Malfoy’s kitchen with him and his mum, rolling out dough and popping trays in the oven. It’s a nice, distracting task and it brings Harry some contentment. Some peace of mind.
“Draco!” He screams, pleading even though he can no longer see him. “Fucking run!”
Instead of fly larvae, though, mist flows out. Indistinct and almost nonexistent. He tries again. Nothing.
When he does, he does so wandlessly. Harry doesn’t know if he didn’t bring one with him or if he got a new one, but he has yet to see it.
“No? Why?”
“I thought it was regular animals only,” Draco says, confused. “How the fuck did you manage that?”
“Oh, yes,” Harry says pleasantly. “Ron sent him a letter and managed to convince him to return.”
“Well, you’re always welcome here.”
a patronus anymore, so he’s pretty sure he’ll just die. Draco’s never even done one before and so he’s probably in the same boat, so they’re fucked. Oh, well.
Life is pure fucking chaos right now and Harry isn’t sure how to fix it. At least he fixed the Draco problem, for the most part.
Harry and Draco share a look and then look toward their friends. They’re all smiling and giving them thumbs up and don’t seem to be embarrassed that they almost got defeated by a boggart dressed in black robes singing a weird lullaby. So they turn and head upstairs, only stopping to grab a change of clothes from their room before heading down to the prefect’s bath to bathe.
It’s the eeriest thing Harry’s ever heard. It’s certainly not English, so he can’t understand the words, but he gets the feeling. The intention. Something is watching them.
“Biscuits sound so good right now. Let’s go.”
“Sounds awesome.”
Harry embraces him, squeezing him so tightly it hurts his weak and aching muscles. Draco doesn’t hold him back for a long moment, arms tight to his sides, but he doesn’t push Harry away either.
Headmistress McGonagall is no different than Professor McGonagall. She’s still tall and smart and one of Harry’s few remaining friends. She leads the Sorting Ceremony with grace and efficiency that Harry’s come to realize she just naturally possesses.
Well, it’s decided. Harry packs up his pajamas and his weed before he sneaks out into Hogsmeade to Apparate into the Malfoy’s living room. It doesn’t even occur to him to Floo, because he can’t seem to do that anymore. He’d rather walk his arse all the way to Hogsmeade than smell the dust and the soot one more time, feel the warmth and see the green light, even if he could get to Malfoy manor quickly.
He groans and, without thinking, lifts his other leg over Draco’s thighs to straddle him. He’s never done this before, not with Ginny or anyone else, but it feels right and Draco doesn’t stop, continues kissing him as his hands hold Harry around his hips.
“We have to return the rest of the fruit, Draco.”
Harry and his fellow eighth years rise, solemn and together, and take the long walk out to the edge of the grounds where McGonagall waits with her fellow staff members.
He wants Draco as close as physically possible. God.
out of us!”
He feels like a little boy again, like the first time Dudley threw his dead parents in his face. Like he’s lost everything all over again all for the gain of a stupid, spoilt little boy.
He sighs feebly, slouching down against the ground.
The Ministry have finally done it. They’ve finally gotten Harry Potter the way they’ve wanted him all along:
Draco leans in close, mouth so close to Harry’s, and pauses. Waits for something and then gets it when Harry leans up to close the space, to fit their mouths together. Then Draco steps away and saunters out of the kitchen, grinning wickedly as he goes, leaving Harry breathless and wanting for more.
“Potter?” He whispers and it’s the most heart-breaking feeling not knowing if he’s hoping for something impossible or inevitable. “Is that you?”
over his lifeless body. He barely eats or drinks. Just lives on smoke and frigid air and on the snowflakes that fall and gather on the crown of his head.
There’s a fence, of sorts, posted around the entirety of the Forbidden Forest. It’s made entirely of a kind of warding magic that glows and sparks red hot in the air. To lock them and the dark creatures in, to keep fellow students out.
He spends his time studying with Draco, Luna, and Pansy, because they’re the only people who don’t seem to give a shit if Harry’s a person right now.
He closes his eyes. Arms wide open, he can feel the pull in his stomach when he jumps. A gust of cold wind flings snow into his face. He can feel everything slowing around him, the swish-swoosh of air, the flutter of his clothes, his misty hair wavering. He can feel himself falling, everything around him freezing into place slowly like a puzzle solving itself. Draco lets himself fall freely with a knowing smile on his face.
at the manor, I
yours always,
Potter gazes at him and smiles faintly.
Harry sat beside Draco in the café, way too early for his liking. They were both drinking their usual orders, except that Harry kept sighing between his sips. Harry gave a particularly heavily sigh and Draco snapped at him to get on with it and tell him what is bothering him. Harry sighed again, then took a deep breath, he resignedly looked down at his feet, the words spilling out of his mouth on their own accord.
Harry and Draco were strolling leisurely in a nearby park, when Draco tugged at his hands and smirked at him happily. Harry turned at him expectantly to him, and Draco told him that his application for Potion apprenticeship in France has been accepted.
"Your house is beautiful Harry. It’s looks totally different from when I visited as a child."
The match starts. Draco laughs when Harry shouts about them all losing – Draco can’t even comprehend the other’s words – before they are all lost in flying in the air. They play for the rest of the afternoon, scoring, shouting, trampling and raising bets.
After what felt like years staring at each other, Harry and Draco giggled like children, and then looked away. Harry let the silence convey everything he was feeling, and could not stop the splitting smile on his face when Draco rested his head on his shoulder. Harry knew they both have fallen deeply for each other. Without words, without any deliberate action made, their heart pounding and thrumming together showed how they felt for each other. Sitting together, Draco’s head on his shoulder, the world around them shrunk, leaving only this moment be theirs and only theirs.
The figure kept staring at him. After what felt like years, the whispers stopped, instead images after images flashed through Draco's mind.
"Draco said he is in love," Blaise said smoothly, in a bored voice that failed to conceal his amusement.
His head held high, shoulders straight and his face a complete blank mask of indifference, Draco walked down the familiar road towards his office. The sun was hiding behind a heavy grey cloud, darker clouds had spread across the sky. He was wearing a formal white shirt with black robes. His silver tinted earing shone in the glass of the elevator as he entered the Ministry of Magic. His pale skin looked more pale, emanating his mood. He closed his eyes, but he could feel someone staring at him. The hair in his neck perked up, a feeling he was very familiar with since the war. But as he opened his eyes he was alone and the elevator door opened with a
Draco had an entirely different personality hidden underneath his usual cold Malfoy demeanour. The more they got close to each other, the more Harry was able to peel Draco’s outer layers one by one. Draco was beautiful, with all his flaws; he hid his soft, tender side with his cold facade, in fear of pain and distrust from the world, of the burden of who he was, who he was expected to be.
how are you love, I am sorry for not writing last week. It’s been hectic here. The faster I finish, the quicker I will be able come to you. This is the only thought that kept me going through this whole ordeal love.
After Harry was fully dressed, Draco happily dragged him outside to the chilly, dark morning. Grey light of dawn fell on their faces, as they walked together. Harry let Draco led the way while he sleepily rubbed his eyes and continuously muttered under his breathe about Draco’s sudden obsession with muggle London and watching a stupid sunrise on a stupid hill, and Draco just being an idiot.
They were slowly but steadily becoming friends.
When Harry first realised he had fallen in love with Draco, He just wanted to confess to him even if his feelings were not reciprocated. But it turned out that they love each other, and things between them just happened on their own; their silent confessions and long night conversations, their simple dinners at home and leisure walks in the park made him firmly believe they did not have some fleeting relationship. Their love is real and they were both fully into this relationship.
* * *
His mouth opened, forming the words his mind supplied.
Draco couldn't sleep, so without disturbing his friends he wandered off to the common room. He sat near the hearth in the comfortable armchair and watched the flame flicker.
"STOP THIS!"
Theo entered their room from the washroom, patting his shoulder for him to move and pulled his curtain aside and sat down looking at him frowning.
So Draco couldn't explain the ache that spread through him because he never got to see him. While hearing the news about him kept him updated about Potter's recent activities, still he couldn't explain the mixed feelings he had regarding the Chosen One. There were so many, so very complicated thoughts, so many questions, what-ifs and don'ts that followed him everywhere he went. He couldn't get answers for them, now could he? So if not seeing Harry Potter or not having met him bothered him, Draco did what he normally did: supress the feeling as much as he could, feign ignorance the best he could.
“What happened?” Ron asked, sounding more bored than suspicious.
Draco lifted his head and kissed Harry’s cheek sweetly, his shy smile something he saved for when they were hidden away from prying eyes.
look. “No, Darling. I can’t. Do you remember what happened last time?”
Harry blinks and the coffee shop is no longer in view. They’re back in Draco’s lab, sitting on the floor saturated with spilled potions, wearing wet uniform robes and trousers. It’s even soaking into his pants and the thought of some bizarre experimental potion coming into contact with his dick has Harry jumping up onto his feet.
“Weasley, congrats on closing the Hardwick case. Potter, thank you for disappointing Level Nine as always. Let’s get you down to the decontamination unit as quickly as possible, shall we?”
Draco and Harry get dumped into a brown leather chair and ottoman set in an empty hotel room. It’s significantly less exciting, but when Harry pays attention to the magical energy around them, he can tell there’s a difference here. Much like the pitch before. It’s rather disorienting but helps to clue him in to the fact that this is another universe. Both dissimilar and the same. Almost like the Muggle comic books that he buys for Teddy. That’s fucking it.
Why? You think I’m interested in protecting ‘Ole Saint Potter?
“But he’s lonely,” Scorpius sighed, weakly pushing aside a handful of legos, clearly having given up on finding his toy on his own.
Before Harry could gather his wits enough to protest any further, Malfoy manhandled him into leaning against his body, tucked in close with his erection thankfully camouflaged by his billowing Unspeakable robes. It only took a few short steps for Harry to realise just how dependent he was on Malfoy for support, his gait as shaky as a victim of the Jelly Legs Jinx.
I’m on suppression potions, Potter. It’s how I make it through the day since the alcohol wasn’t helping.
A small mercy, considering the invisible wanking had kicked up a notch, and Harry felt shiny all over with sweat. “But how — did you — oh shit!” That was definitely a mouth on his cock. A very wet, warm, suckling mouth.
Potter slowly straightened up. He seemed to study Draco with the same scrupulousness that had been paid to him. Taking in every detail that stayed the same — whippet-thin, poise and good posture, that single inch taller — and denoting every change. His silvery blond undercut with the top left long enough to look enticingly tousled. A few metal hoops and studs distributed across his ears and a ring in his right nostril. Henley sleeves pushed up to reveal a faded scar on his left arm, barely noticeable among the tattooed narcissus flowers, bright against pale skin. Potter’s eyes had fallen to his left hand that was missing a ring. It was now lovingly draped on his son’s shoulder to gently nudge him forward.
Harry kindly refrained from pointing out that Draco and his friends were largely benefitting from the arrangement. He could sense how delicate this newfound truce was after speaking up for Draco and Narcissa, and he had no intention of disturbing it yet.
Instead, he sits in his desk chair, in a puddle of shame and his own rapidly cooling jizz.
“Play with your potions later, this is for a case,” Harry argues, throwing the file down beside what looks like a fucked up Time-Turner. There’s sand and a spinning mechanism, but the shape is wonky. Fed up, Harry goes to put a stopper on the vial that is already filled but Draco rushes to stop him, accidentally dropping the second vial with the foam in his hurry. It shatters on the floor with a hiss.
Draco snorts and rolls his eyes, then gently sets the vial in a holder without stoppering it. He leans over to stir the cauldron counterclockwise five times before turning back to his workspace. “Leave the file by the door, and I’ll look at it after lunch. Your case can wait until then.”
Please forgive me for growing weary of Ronan Buckthorne weeping over his monthly furry problem.
“I’m looking,” Scorpius mumbled around a bite of toast he was still chewing. The lukewarm, buttery remainder was clutched firmly in one chubby hand, making a mess of melted oil running down his skin and confetti levels of crumbs that splashed onto the carpet around his feet — that their house-elf Nipsy would have to clean up later, Draco was dreading that lecture — while his empty hand pawed through a deep sea of legos, single and partially put together pieces all chaotically mixed in one giant trunk.
It was bold, but a Malfoy never backed down from what they wanted… Unless a better option became available.
“So, did you help everyone like this?”
Draco —
Draco glanced down at the parchment, then back up at Harry, his brow arched incredulously. “But you have a map.”
At first, Harry can’t even figure out where they’ve landed this time because it’s so loud. If he wasn’t worried about seeing a Healer at the end of this experience, he is now.
Too late. The stoppered vial of potion smokes, then explodes before either of them can throw up a proper Shield Charm. The blast propels Harry back into Draco, who slips on the puddle on the floor. As Draco’s going down he tries to cling to Harry for support, but Harry trips over a crate of previously filled vials on the floor and falls on top of Draco. In a continuation of mimicking dominos  — They knock into the cauldron, its content spilling onto their clothes, but before it seeps in and burns them both, they disappear. The Time-Turner had begun spinning in Draco’s hand after being splashed with one of the potions.
Did they teach you how to curse like that in Tokyo, Malfoy? I thought you were meant to be studying potions.
“No. Can’t do it.” Harry could be firm in the face of Draco’s flirting and slippery fingers; he could ignore how his robes were unbuttoned at a leisurely pace.
You have no idea how wrong you are.
Father and son stepped out of the primary school’s fireplace with ease. Perhaps too much ease, judging by how badly they spooked a passing woman. Obviously a Muggle mother, since athleisure wear had yet to take off in Wizarding London. It was a true shame.
“Harry.”
“Malfoy, you fucker!” Harry shouted, weakly reaching for his robes and Spelling his door shut before any prying eyes could see inside.
Harry does not stop watching Malfoy masturbate.
Is that your official diagnosis, Healer Potter? My late Veela inheritance is due to my winning personality? How strange, and here I was blaming my rotten father for lying about his beloved blood purity.
Due to his international travels, parenthood and odd hours worked while holed up in his potions lab, he hasn’t seen or made awkward small talk with Potter at Ministry events in over seven years. Time has certainly been kind to him. A full beard, longer curls — currently tied back, amber complexion glowing with a recent tan. Shoulders broad and pushed back with confidence that was earned and not faked. While Potter had put on a little necessary weight as a Junior Auror at nineteen, it seems he’s packed on another three stone in solid muscle mass since then and carried it into his retirement. About one month prior if Draco’s memory of the Prophet’s hysteria was accurate, some international trial or other. The point was - Potter was massively fit now, in a way Draco preferred his men.
Harry studiously ignored the horde of doxies flying in his stomach as he listened to the vowels roll off of Draco’s tongue like liquid velvet.
“But you have room on your shelf beside Piglet and Eeyore,” Draco said, hoping to compromise. He cringed once he saw that Scorpius was wearing socks that didn’t match.
“You can’t ignore me for shits and giggles. And the smuggler could up his game and move to higher targets. We need to find out how he’s dosing the suppliers he’s stealing from.”
Actually, it felt more like when Wood paid him back. Better even. The ghost of touch trailing his inner thighs, hot breath panting against him. Harry swore he could feel a tongue swirling around the tip and—
MV Theo yawns and shuts his heavy potions book, tossing it onto his trunk — where it promptly slides off onto the floor. He wishes Harry and Draco a goodnight as he closes his own curtains and the grandfather clock by the door chimes to announce it’s midnight.
...To seduce whomever you desire.
Clearly, Harry isn’t not going to stop watching Malfoy masturbate any time soon.
Draco gasps and takes a step back, his face pink when he trips over Harry’s boot. It throws him off balance, causing him and Harry both to fall backwards against the glass door that opens into the street behind them. The Time-Turner slips out of his hand and breaks open on the pavement beside them.
“Ron was busy paying attention to Gabrielle,” Harry grumbled.
Malfoy paused abruptly in front of an empty portrait, then tapped his wand on the frame’s edge so a hidden door would open. “Here. You won’t make it down to the labs, and I’m assuming you don’t want to cause a scene.”
Draco’s toes curled in his boots. “Chocolate is nice.” Potter still hadn’t let go of his wrist.
Draco insisted it was Harry for picking up the cursed object without testing it in the first place, while Harry swore it never would’ve happened if they had been working instead of Draco
Then Malfoy was rolling his balls in one hand, a steady rhythm established with his other. Then it stopped, and Harry felt his centre of gravity shift and spin, a whispered spell he couldn’t distinguish and wet heat in a rarely visited space. He blinked, licked his dry lips. He realised he was straddling Malfoy’s lap in just his open shirt and boots.
— — —
Then he watches Malfoy jerk off on camera while using his new gift and gets thanked for it personally, during the show. He tries to enjoy the high of endorphins, honestly.
. Because offline, in the real world, they’re still Potter and Malfoy to each other. Nothing more than a routine check-in every six months, so Malfoy can have his wand scanned for dark magic use while serving out his probation.
MV Draco groans while MV Harry pants, “How long until the Curse-Breakers show up to set us free?”
Draco raised a snooty brow at Harry, leaving him to believe that no one else was buying his unvoiced insistence. Perhaps, he was panicking a little. “Calm down, Potter. It doesn’t take us forwards or backwards in time. My new Time-Turner takes us to an entirely different universe. We
Harry had teased him a few days ago, made a crude joke about Draco’s Slytherin scarf that he couldn’t even remember at the moment, but it had led to this. To Harry naked on his crisp white sheets, green eyes masked by a green tie and waiting for Draco to follow up on his promise. That he could make this scarf Harry’s favourite thing in the world.
After Flitwick and McGonagall were alerted to the problem, Draco expected a quick fix. The ability to retire to his dormitory for another night of sleeping to the dulcet tones of Longbottom snoring as loud as the Hogwarts Express, a metre away.
Unconcerned, Draco brushed a spot of stray lint from his robes. “Potter, if your listening comprehension was up to scratch, you’d realise that I had said nothing inflammatory about your friend. I was merely impressed by her accomplishment.” The corners of his mouth tightened into an exasperated smile. “As fun as this chat was, I’m late for Potions. Good day, Potter.”
MV Harry is also naked, sweaty and rock hard, moaning while he finger fucks himself.
The real Harry spasms and knocks his elbow into Draco’s ribs. “We need to leave, right now. No Silencing Charms are strong enough for this.”
It was extra annoying today since Harry could be skiving off for a cuppa before his next clinic case instead of entertaining this shite. “Draco?”
— — —
Harry glanced down at his map that wasn’t really a map at all. There was a vague shape to represent the Beauxbatons castle and grounds, and then a list of names and classroom numbers. With everything spelt out in French.
“Alright. I’ll see you later, Harry.” Draco bit his lip to keep his smile politely contained then walked away with the tatters of his dignity. He couldn’t help looking back as he turned the corner. His breath caught in his throat when Harry was still standing there. Eyes on him.
“Well,” Draco hedged, after a significant pause. “I suppose I’ll see you when I collect Scorpius. Ta.” With a polite nod, he turned to go until a calloused hand grabbed his forearm to stop him. Fingertips pressing into petals.
Draco allowed Harry a moment to come down from his climax before dragging the wool across his sensitive skin and offering the soiled fabric to his parted lips, still panting.
The order was clear and Harry was obedient, his tongue lapping wide, lazy swathes across the fabric until it was clean. Once finished, Draco crawled up to kiss Harry’s mouth with the scarf between them before nuzzling into his throat.
But maybe Draco could start watching Harry.
“And you’re certain that this potion will heal my sores from the Dragon Pixies?” Mrs Mulberry asked, her voice croaky like toads in the summertime.
Harry breathes a sigh of relief when it looks like this will finally be a safe universe, as MV Harry stands and trails after Ron. Until he stops and closes the door behind him before he casts a strong locking charm, followed by a running jump where he lands on MV Draco’s bed. Wearing a particularly proud smile on his face.
He’s old. Super old. Dumbledore’s age at the very least. MV Harry is sitting in a sun lounge chair with a Kneazle in his lap and a beer pint hovering in the air beside him. Equally old MV Draco is sitting on the grass by his side, tending to a nearby rose bush with his wand. He’s pruning it with softly spoken spells while wearing a straw sun hat. They’re holding hands, and it’s so pure that Harry feels his entire stomach roll over much like the pet in the other Harry’s lap. They look cute and happy, and Harry wants to cry a little bit.
I am not a scared little boy anymore.
Harry swallows, trying to not watch MV Draco’s arse bounce, but he’s only human. It’s a surprisingly plush arse.
Then MV Draco hovers down and lands on the balcony, his set of giant, white wings flapping beautifully. He’s nude and almost completely erect, his entire body radiating sensuality as he walks across the marble floor and farther into the room. A wolf’s howl is heard close by.
You think they won’t take you seriously.
“But we leave Mum and Gianna.”
I had to leave my programme.
“You’re implying I’ll get the chance to leave, Potter,” Draco said, recovering well enough to arch a pointed brow.
“Bulstrode doesn’t even move, though,” Ron said, between bites. “She just does that eye thing. ‘S creepy.”
“Here we are. After you,” Draco said, with a large, heavily ringed hand placed unnecessarily on the small of Harry’s back to guide him through an open doorway. Then his ears felt like they were on fire when soft lips grazed the skin as Draco whispered, “We can sit at that table in the back.”
Draco unwound the scarf and laid it horizontally over Harry’s chest, then rested his palms over wool-covered pectorals and rubbed in circular, outwards motions. He revelled in the shivers that followed, in feeling tiny nipples harden under his touch, the rise and fall as his lungs expanded.
No, I am not a drunk.
Is this how you normally ‘guide and council’ people, Potter? I understand why you couldn’t make the cut for Healer training.
Draco. “Hey Mal—”
Multiverse Draco and Harry start to fight over this too, but only half-arsed about it while they both strip and lay down, probably too tired to keep up steam. The lights are turned off with nothing but the moonlight pouring in through the window. The room is quiet for a minute.
Draco smirks, looking too proud of himself as he licks the dildo tip clean. The only thing ruining the Pensieve perfect moment for Harry is the quiet sounds of the tip jar pinging, repeatedly. No matter how tired he is, he could never be outdone by the other anonymous men watching. Draco needed to pay attention to
MV Draco is sitting in a squishy oversized chair, alone, typing rapidly on the macbook in his lap. He’s dressed in Muggle clothes and nearly indistinguishable from all the other college students who are supporting the coffee shop. There’s even a metal ring circling around his lower lip at the corner of his mouth. His tongue keeps flicking out to touch it.
So he felt valiantly justified about the fit he threw when Potter disregarded their assigned slab of ruined wall to pick up shiny knick-knacks lying about, like a scruffy little niffler. Including the stray cursed hairpin that blew up and sent them flying into a set of abandoned staff quarters across the hall. Which they were promptly locked inside of - magically, of course.
To cover up his embarrassment, Harry blurts out the first thing that comes to mind and points. “I didn’t know you had a beauty mark there.” On his left arsecheek. MV Draco’s bare arsecheek is an arm’s length away from him. Simply… there. On display.
I think you look a bit peaky. It seems your allure isn’t working.
. I’m in the middle of an experiment, and you’re going to ruin my timing and measurements.” Draco snaps.
A long, deep sigh did nothing but press on Harry’s patience. “I’ve been very poorly as of late,”  Draco said, his tone wavering like a wireless voice actor.  “It’s affecting my beauty sleep now. It’s the pain, you see. I swear, it feels like a herd of Hippogriffs are stomping on my bad knee, digging their claws into my muscles and ripping my tendons from my flesh—”
“—go,” Harry said, tone flat and smile chased away. Again.
“Yes, I figured this part was coming. Your temperature’s rising? Shivers down your spine and goosebumps on your skin? And then there’s the matter of — well. The obvious.”
So for the record, are you or aren’t you a drunk?
“Please, Papa?” Scorpius whined, clutching onto Draco’s plum henley with his — thankfully clean — hands. His scrunching would still leave wrinkles that would need to be pressed out magically, and they didn’t have time.
(laughs, unamused)
Harry takes it back. Draco can always have the last word.
A whole minute goes by before MV Harry creeps over to Draco’s bed in just his pants and pulls Draco’s elegant nightshirt off. They kiss while slow hands explore the surface of each other’s body. MV Harry whispers to Draco, “Don’t forget your Silencing Charms this time,” teasing his apparent boyfriend.
And Draco had ground his teeth and bore it when he was assigned to partner up with Harry bloody Potter after Flitwick’s Diagnostic Charm discerned that they had the most complimentary magical cores for the spells involving stonework that necessitated two casters working in tandem.
Draco attempted all of those same spells, including a few Harry admitted he’d never even heard of — not trying to show off, mind you — yet there was still no budging the massive oak door.
They land outside again, this time on Hogwarts grounds by the Black Lake, at the edge of the pier.
There was no discernible overlap that he could see. Harry drew in a deep calming breath then turned his map upside down. Still indecipherable. Which led him to feel justified in kicking the stone wall in front of him until his toes were sore inside his trainers.
“Potter, you look a bit lost. I don’t think they sell the type of wand polish you’re looking for here,” Malfoy chuckles in a low tone.
“Sir Bumblebee.”
“They’re not legos,” Scorpius tried to argue as he set the last of his buttered toast down, on the rim of the trunk. Unevenly, of course, so it fell inside the lego trunk immediately with a sticky plop that had Draco looking up at the ceiling to avoid the newest problem. Nipsy was going to be horrified.
MV Harry and Draco are screaming at each other and gesturing wildly with only one arm each because they’re both handcuffed together by the other wrist. Magically handcuffed if the glowing and mildly alarming, purple sparks are anything to go by.
Sounds dreadfully Muggle.
Living life as a werewolf is no easy task, Malfoy.
You’re scared, Malfoy.
Draco had accepted the outcome of the trials.
Draco had accepted snogging and rushed orgasms in alcoves or under Quidditch stands.
He tries to not feel empty when other people's tips steadily pour in and Draco lounges on his side, curled up with the stuffed Horntail Dragon while he fingers his puffy arsehole in a lazy fashion. Lube is shiny on his flushed skin, obscenely visible with one leg hiked up for the camera.
Malfoy snorts, a terribly unposh thing to do, then turns to presumably give Harry a piece of his mind. Instead, Harry receives a look of shock, which quickly morphs into suspicion, calculation, amazement. Which then slides into that sultry smile that has been burned into Harry’s mind with how often he’s seen it on camera.
Harry is so entranced by how beautiful MV Merman Draco is, that he keeps leaning in closer to get a better look and tumbles into the water as consequence. (His) Draco dives after him and manages to grab onto his torso as they break the surface and the Time-Turner spins.
“Yes, it is. Don’t forget to buy batteries, Potter. Trying to magically power vibrators will only cause them to short out early. A tragically disappointing experience to learn first hand,” Malfoy says, squeezing the monster dildo for emphasis.
“Modified how? We can’t be seen, it could change the fabric of time!” Harry was not panicking. They didn’t have time to panic. They had to fix this.
Harry can feel the nasty grime of sweat building up in his armpits, his hairline, and the back of his knees. Of all the different ways he’s imagined reconnecting with Malfoy off the clock, this is not one that he planned for. Nor, is he prepared for this level of confidence. The collected slope of narrow shoulders, bright eyes peering down at him from above, an eyebrow arched in a teasing manner.
Snorting, Draco rolled his eyes so dramatically that he seemed in danger of pulling a muscle. “Obviously. Everything here is in French unless it’s in Spanish. That’s why they went over the Language Conversion Charm during breakfast this morning. Or were you and Weasley not paying attention?”
Harry had the nerve to say it reminded him of Granger. Unbelievable.
(His) Draco makes a noise beside him that sounds suspiciously like a sniffle before he silently reaches for his hand. Harry squeezes it tightly as they spin in time again, without a single word exchanged. This glimpse is too pure for any snide remarks or fighting.
MV Harry is sitting on a group of rocks by the water’s edge, leaning over and fully focused on the iridescent merman in the water. It’s Draco and he’s singing a passionate tune in Mermish, rounding out his song by raising his hands and presenting MV Harry with a delicate necklace made of braided seaweed.
It’s the last thing Harry noticed before it all goes black.
MV Harry breaks the silence with a worn out, “Fuck it.” He sits up and straddles MV Draco with seemingly practised effort, then leans down to kiss him, while MV Draco moves up to meet him. Apparently, Draco tries to get the last word in every universe, this one included. “What happened to ‘never happening again’, Potter?”
Yet, it still can’t overpower the nauseating stench of being a miserable prick.
Harry frowns and types out another hefty donation before he can even realise he’s been goaded into it. It is simply fortunate that Gringotts had upgraded to offer a debit card option for Muggle money transfers. He needs the easy access with as much money he spends on Draco nowadays.
“I can’t. It’s so much.” And it was. Harry’s head hit the cabinet behind him with a thunk as he slumped down. This couldn’t possibly be happening, except it was, and now Malfoy was being
Draco might as well save them both the trouble. “I filed the necessary forms to revert to Black along with my mother after my father died. We decided it was best to let the Malfoy name rest with him. When I married Astoria a few months later, our ceremony was in France and largely kept out of the papers.” Nerves caused him to fiddle with his watch before continuing, his voice lowered. “Scorpius doesn’t know. What went on with the war, not the details. I haven’t tried to hide my family’s sins, he knows we stay in mostly Muggle areas and shopping here in London since our family isn’t particularly well-liked. But he’s only five. There’s only so much I can explain right now until he’s older.” The breath Draco exhaled felt exhausting. “I’m not— I can’t ask you to shield him, or anything. I’d just like for Scorpius to have the opportunity for kids to get to know
Fuck you right up your arse, you cock sucking cunt.
“—Sir Bumblebee can stay outside your lego trunk where it’s easy to find him.”
(His) Draco avoids Harry’s gaze. He tucks his arm around him, mumbling under his breath as he spins the Time-Turner. “You need a special powder and an unofficial spell, technically.”
Absolutely not. Is this how you attempt to console all of your new patients? No wonder clinical treatment is so necessary for them.
Or perhaps not.
“No.” Malfoy was out of his mind if he thought Harry would toss one off here. With him and his pointy face and his gloves and his stupid eyes that weren’t even the same colour. If one looked closely enough, the left one was blue instead of grey. It was absurd and hypnotic, and Harry was not going to wank off while Malfoy coached him in his stupidly soothing Unspeakable voice.
People would talk. Would assume it meant more than it actually did. Would jump to the conclusion that they were involved, a couple,
Despite Draco’s quick flash of his most charming smile, the Muggle woman turned the corner in a hurry. Hopefully not to complain to the admin that she changed her mind and wanted to pull her child out of this school.
“Potter, it’s the only way to end the effects of the potion. Otherwise, your fever will climb to the point of needing hospitalisation,” he sighed. Malfoy pulled off his gloves, one at a time, then tucked them into his pocket. “I want you to focus on your breathing, alright? In through your nose, exhale through your mouth.” Without notice, he began to unbuckle Harry’s belt and carefully open his fly, mindful of how tented his trousers were. “There, you’re doing so well.”
The dark-haired seeker finally lifts up to rest on his arms, then leans in to snog Seeker Draco with his profile in full view. The Puddlemere Seeker is Harry. Shit.
“That curse settled into your wound for years without treatment,” Harry closed his eyes and began rolling his hips to meet Draco’s grasp. “Pain Potions won’t heal you. It’s only… it’s only, fuck, it’s temporary. A short fix. No real… solution.”
“And before you start feeling too special, you not the first person who’s been targeted,” Malfoy muttered. “I’ve been handing out elixirs all week for — similar discretions.” He then bypassed the lifts to Level Nine and turned down a deserted hallway that Harry didn’t even know existed before today.
“It’s Mr Potter in class, Rose,” Potter corrected, rather uselessly. Rose was already chatting Scorpius’s ear off about uncles and dragons. “Erm, sorry about that…”
“Sir Bumblebee!”
“Shhh,” Draco hushed, then followed it up with the scarf running over the rest of Harry’s scars, with the soft knitted wool instead of the itchy fringed edge.
“A Granger-Weasley, I presume?” Draco smiled, hoping to break the awkward moment.
MV Harry pulls his fingers free with a loud squelch and picks up what looks like Floo powder, only it’s a fluorescent shade of green instead of the normal grey. He quietly mumbles a spell in place of an address before tossing it into the flames. Almost immediately, the flames soar, then lower to the edge of the hearth’s floor. A long, flushed cock slides out of the fireplace, looking identical to the erection attached to all of the previous MV Dracos.
“Harry.”
Thankfully, MV Harry doesn’t let him win so easily. “Shut up, Malfoy. Let me suck your dick in peace.”
I suppose the stench of wet dog does grow old with the dismal weather here.
Draco had even accepted the fact that he was stuck with Longbottom as a roommate for the year, and that every single weekend would be spent under McGonagall’s sharp eyes while they worked to repair parts of the castle that had still been in disuse after a long summer of reconstruction.
(His) Draco sways beside Harry and whispers, “Oh.”
Harry splutters and turns red, yanking the Time-Turner out of (his) Draco’s hand so they can leave this universe before anything else incriminating happens.
“Some Muggles aren’t used to magic,” Draco said quietly. They continued to hold hands on their walk to the Year 1 classroom, the faded scent of disinfectant tickling his nose. “We can’t use it in front of them, remember? Like the park behind our building. There are no brooms allowed because it’s a Muggle park.”
MV Harry finally walks up, wearing the cafe’s uniform as he drops off a slice of carrot cake and a fresh latte. He says it’s ‘on the house’ in a shy voice and turns the cup so his number is visible where it’s written on the side in black marker. MV Draco smirks and tells Harry he looks cute in his apron. It makes Harry blush and scurry back behind the counter.
“You don’t have to say yes,” Potter muttered, rubbing his thumb over the paper-thin skin on the inside of Draco’s wrist. His hold felt like a brand, hot and claiming. A bit possessive considering they were alone in a corridor inside of a primary school, but he couldn’t deny the shiver of want that skidded down his spine.
Harry tries not to feel bitter when he realises this exact scene played out ten years ago during their real eighth year at Hogwarts. (Minus the kissing and secret relationship between star crossed lovers.)
Apparently, it’s rather difficult to carry on an argument when two people are busy snogging and rubbing off. In fact, the release of tension made Potter quite agreeable. His forest green eyes were far more attractive after Draco had taken those horrid glasses off and tossed them onto the bedside table.
