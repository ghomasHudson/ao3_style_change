Harry beamed, then bit his lips like he was trying not to smile but the smiling was winning out anyway.  “Anything you need,” he said, and he backed up a few paces, leaving room for Draco to pass him.  “I’ll see you around, Draco.”  He said Draco’s name like a promise.  Like an unbreakable vow.
“Talking,” Draco ground out, looking outright furious now.
Harry felt himself starting to get worked up again.  “That’s not true,” he bit back.  “Muggles aren’t less – ”
“I hope you’re in the mood for aged firewhiskey,” Blaise started, as he held open a door to one of the Mansion’s many lounges.
“Well,” the woman went on as if she had expected as much, “in olden times, when the first maps were being created, people hadn’t explored everywhere yet.  And so, in the places they hadn’t explored, they would draw sea serpents and lizard-monsters with the caption ‘Here be dragons’ to indicate the unknown.  You see?”
It was a dreary day out, the kind where the sky was as grey as the pavement, and the sun was nothing but a faint glow.  The air was still and bitter cold, and Draco shivered under his padded coat.  His lunch hour was almost up, and he was on his way back to the bookstore when there was a loud
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” Hermione gushed, looking positively horrified.  “I just thought you meant — ”
Draco gave Harry a withering look.  “His wand was taken.  As punishment.”
Rage swelled in Harry again, rage for the dark wizard who had done this to the boy behind him.  “Just hold on,” Harry shouted back, hoping Draco could hear him above the relentless wind.  “You’re going to be fine.”
“We’re already
“Well, judging by what you yelled at him — ”
— nodded happily and ambled over to the door, waving briefly at Dr. Finch before stepping into the drizzle.
“No,” Draco insisted grumpily, “I mean stupidity.  Even you don’t bother me when I’m really pissed about something.”
“You are a
Draco startled.  “Right now?”
“You always say that,” Draco replied, trying valiantly to soften his expression for her, “but you never do.”
Harry was dumbstruck.  Malfoy was a Death Eater.  All these years, Harry was right about him; he was a villain.  But Malfoy was here, now, on the doorstep of his muggle aunt’s house, warning him that Voldemort was coming.  And when Voldemort found out, he would kill him.
“Potter,” Snape sneered back immediately, as if he’d been waiting for this conversation.
Draco frowned at him, barely managing not to glare.  “I work here,” he said coolly.
Draco closed his eyes, head tilting up like he was trying to regain his composure, and the image was doing strange things to Harry’s stomach.  He wanted to reach out and touch Draco’s shoulders, his face.  He wanted to comfort him, say it was alright, say he never expected Draco to choose, though that wasn’t necessarily true.  He desperately wanted Draco to choose right now, to choose Harry over anything else, to never have to feel like a villain again.
“Get out,” Parkinson demanded, not unkindly.  She still hadn’t moved from her place on the couch.  “Blaise is expecting you anyway.”
“What an arse,” Potter commented, stepping further into the shop.
Harry paused.  “Come on, then,” he prompted.
Potter hesitated, looking torn.  “But I just…wanted to make things right,” he said sadly.
Except the whole point was to stop thinking about him.
Harry made sure he was still smiling.  “He has.”
you,” Pansy contradicted, looking enormously bored.  “My presence is a gift.”
When McGonagall finished speaking she looked at Harry closely, awaiting his response. Harry swallowed, conflicted. “Why…why didn’t I know about her?” he asked at last.
“She has a first name,” Hermione told him stubbornly, “and I’m going to use it.”
Harry scanned the gravestones, looking for one name in particular.  Every grave was granted its own body-sized portion of earth, though Harry knew most of these were out of respect rather than necessity; many of these people hadn’t had bodies left to bury.
“Draco,” Dr. Finch called after a moment, and his stomach dropped.  “Could you help this young man find what he’s looking for?”
“Er, yes, so, well, he and I – well, I mean,
“An obsession, really,” Hermione amended.
,” Harry tried, “wait!”
“Yes,” Draco said.
Draco struggled not to roll his eyes at the obvious statement.  “Then why are you bothering me at work again, Potter?” he growled instead.  “I thought I made myself clear.”
“You two have that whole hate-attraction thing going on,” Connor explained, catching Draco’s eye.
Draco turned his inquiring gaze on Dr. Finch, trying to communicate his annoyance.
Harry slid his hand into Draco’s and pulled them out onto the street again.  It wasn’t much brighter out in Knockturn Alley, but it was empty enough to give a sense of privacy.  When he glanced at Draco’s face, he found his companion was desperately trying to bite back a grin.
The other boy’s face cleared of confusion as he cheerfully made for the exit.
Draco stiffened all over like someone had cast
He wanted to kiss Draco Malfoy.
“She can seem kind of intimidating at first,” Lavender said as she delivered his tea, voice pitched low so the other two wouldn’t hear.  “But the Slytherins are all sweethearts underneath.  You just have to wear them down.”  She winked at him as if she’d just done him a huge favor, and Harry wondered if she had.  Perhaps all he needed to do with Draco was wear down his defenses.  Spend more time getting to know him.  It wasn’t all that bad of an idea.
Draco stared at him, suspicion playing across his features until he forced his expression into something more neutral, and glanced restlessly away at the other patrons again.  “Lots of things, Potter.  You’ve known me for years, don’t tell me you haven’t noticed.”
Harry was dying to say something, anything, just to make it less tense, but nothing came to mind.  He opened his mouth a few times, only to close it seconds later because he couldn’t think of a topic.  The weather was nice today.  Hermione had been nagging him about paperwork again, classic Hermione.  Ron managed to knock over his favorite Quidditch player in excitement while getting his autograph last week, can you imagine?  But Draco didn’t care about Harry’s friends, that much was clear.  The thought left him dejected.
“Nonsense,” she snapped, nostrils flaring, and for a moment she reminded him of Professor Mcgonagall.  “I don’t need to know all the details to know that who you are now is what matters.”
Harry’s stupidly green eyes seemed to get bigger as he stared up at Draco.  “Well – I suppose,” he stammered, because apparently coherency wasn’t one of Harry Potter’s strong suits.  “Because – well – it’s different – ”
“It had to be
“Perhaps,” Dumbledore cut in, “another Slytherin. One who is more willing to share her story.”
Draco scoffed, and rolled his eyes, but didn’t deny it.
Draco groaned in secondhand embarrassment.  “Yes.”
“Will talking get us to Diagon Alley faster?” Draco questioned without looking Harry’s way.
The lane wasn’t actually a mile long — in fact they’d hardly walked ten metres before they arrived at the front door.  The magnificent mansion had diminished to the size of a large house now that they were closer.
Potter blinked a few times behind his round glasses, looking even more like an idiot than usual.  “Malfoy,” he repeated stupidly, “Why are you here?”
“Wait!” a voice shouted from behind them, and they turned to see Gregory Goyle rushing their way.  Harry tensed, thinking of Draco’s comment on Goyle’s fighting proclivities, but Goyle stopped several metres away.  “I guess I forgive you,” he said, panting slightly as he shifted from foot to foot.  “And I guess I should be sorry too.”
“Please,” Harry tacked on for good measure.
Just then, a knock sounded at the door.
Harry’s smile drooped a bit.  “Yeah, sure,” he agreed.  “If that’s what you want.”
about you!”
Draco frowned at her as she wiped the counter.  “Not everything’s about Potter,” Draco said bitterly.
Draco smiled fondly at Greg’s unsubtle infatuation with the landlady, and headed back out to the front.  Just as he was about to rejoin Potter and Rosmerta, he heard his name mentioned, and out of habit he hung back out of sight to listen.
“He doesn’t seem to need much encouragement,” Pansy said, smirking.
“Here be dragons,” Draco replied, grinning.
Draco groaned and broke off his stare with the gorgeous Connor to glare at the horrible Potter.  “What now, you prat?” he growled, supremely embarrassed that Connor had to witness this scene.
.  You’re supposed to be prepared for things like this.”
.  That’s how you end magical supremacy.  Not with magic, with empathy.”
Draco raised one perfectly sculpted eyebrow, urging Harry to continue.
“No stalking,” Draco clarified, because it would be just like Potter to not understand simple instructions.
Draco bristled at the use of his first name, but there was something undeniably captivating about how those syllables sounded coming from Potter’s mouth.  It was intimate in a way that Potter and Draco weren’t supposed to be.
Greg looked about as concerned as he should be in the circumstances, and Draco watched Potter shrewdly as he decided how to word his apology.
He was just gathering titles on animism when the front door rang with a customer.
Once inside, the walls went from solid wood to crystal clear glass, and the sunlight poured in just as if they were standing outside.  Harry’s mouth was hanging open as he stared wide-eyed out across the rolling green fields, and the several horses grazing in the distance.  “This is magic,” Harry breathed, undoubtedly wondering how so many enchantments could be put on one estate.
Potter grinned sheepishly.  “You gave me a map,” he said.  “Remember?”
“He’s waiting,” she said, no longer paying them any mind, and instead turning to nuzzle her girlfriend’s neck.
Let me know if you want more :)
“Pansy?” Harry blurted.
Draco rolled his eyes, a terrible habit that was only exacerbated by his proximity to Potter.  “Because Greg was never an ambitious soul, and he always had an enormous crush on Rosmerta.  It’s a wonder he was in Slytherin, the great oaf is more of a Hufflepuff than anything.”
“There’s nothing to tell, Hermione,” Harry said.  “I’m just…thinking about work.”
Greg shrugged his beefy shoulders, apparently unable to back up his assumption, and turned back to his task.  “I’ll be out in a minute, I just have to finish sorting through this firewhiskey.  Some of these bottles are expired, and Ros says we can’t serve those.”
Harry purposefully took a bite out of his pie.  “Nothing,” he said while chewing.
Connor chuckled.  “A tosser?”
Ron and Hermione shared a look.  “Well, normally it is,” Hermione hedged, “but is that really why you’re doing this?”
This was the graveyard for Voldemort’s supporters who died during the Battle of Hogwarts.  No fancy statues or memorials for them.  The Ministry had set up anti-vandalism wards, but that was the only courtesy the wizarding world had extended.  It was chilling in this small, out-of-the-way place not connected to any town, mostly because it was so understated.  Harry might’ve felt more at ease if there were statues of gargoyles and a perpetual mist curling over elegant marble tombstones.  But it was oddly unremarkable.  Just a patch of dirt on the side of an unfrequented road.  It was just as well, Harry supposed; no one wanted to be seen visiting
“Alright,” Draco said, not leading them out from the alley.  His voice sounded strained, and Harry looked up at him to see he had an awkward smile plastered in place.  “Who next?”
“Oh right!” Harry exclaimed, digging around his jacket pocket for his wallet.  He pulled out £5 and gave it to Malfoy, who looked unwillingly amused.
mission.  “No,” Draco said, standing his ground.  “Not him too.”
“Can you apparate?” he checked, though he doubted even purebloods were taught so young.
“I never
“I’ll see myself out then, shall I?” Draco offered, standing.  He felt vastly relieved he wouldn’t have to choke down the rest of Pansy’s tea.
Screw Potter.  Draco was going on a date with an American muggle, and that was that.
Malfoy stopped walking abruptly.  Harry stopped a few paces further along and had to turn to face him.
The effect was instantaneous.  Draco’s eyes flashed in anger, then his entire face went blank.  He stood abruptly, nearly knocking his drink over, and swept out of the booth as gracefully and confidently as the late Professor Snape.  Without a word, he began to stride away towards the door.
That was when she dumped the entire platter of ales over Harry’s head.  Luckily the four glasses vanished before they could smash into him — sometimes Harry still did accidental magic, like a child would; it was rather embarrassing — but the liquid sailed unimpeded through the air and landed all over Harry’s face and clothes.  A cheer went up around them, from the drunkest of the muggles, and for the first time a smirk appeared on Bulstrode’s boxy face.  So maybe it
“Yes,” McGonagall said curtly. “A Slytherin, in fact.”
Harry — no, no, for Merlin’s sake,
“I just wanted to say,” Harry went on, steadier than before, “I’m very sorry for how I behaved at Hogwarts, how I treated you and the other Slytherins.  My friends and I never gave you a chance to prove yourselves, and we were right nasty sometimes.  But honestly,” Harry kept going, and Draco sensed a blunder in the making, “I think you lot were probably meaner to us than we were to you, but all the same, you know, it takes two, as they say.”  Harry nodded solemnly, like he was agreeing with himself.
Connor held out a sun-tanned hand, and Draco took it, relishing in how warm Connor’s skin was.  “Nice to meet you,” he said with a wink.  If he was surprised at Draco’s name, he didn’t show it.
Daphne laughed lightly, voice like a clear bell, and the movement caused her sleek blonde hair to ripple around her face.  Draco was starting to feel very irked by the way Harry was staring at her, even though he knew Daphne was using charms to enthrall him.
While most of the other portraits were either bored or asleep, Snape was watching Harry back inscrutably. Dumbledore’s portrait however was currently blank. He must be in his portrait at the ministry, or at Aberforth’s pub. Harry sorely wished he would return, if only to nod hello. Something churned in Harry’s belly, some need for wisdom that only Dumbledore could ever provide. What would he say about Draco? Would he approve?
“I suppose you’re going to obsess over Blaise now,” Draco said conversationally, wincing as he thought about how Blaise would react to such a breach of decorum.
Huffing in exasperation, Harry turned to the door and knocked.  They were in a fairly small town out in the French countryside, and he had to admit it was picturesque.  He wasn’t about to admit that out loud though, not after Draco just broke international travel law to get them here.
Draco spluttered for a moment.  “Wait, Dr. Finch, you’re gay?”
“I’m sorry for how I treated you in school,” Harry recited, trying valiantly to sound more original.  The words felt tired and rubbery in his mouth, like old gum.  He hoped Flint wouldn’t notice.  “I was never very nice to you or your friends, and that was wrong of me.  I hope this apology helps, in some way.”
It's been a while…. Sorry! I'm still aiming to give this the ending it deserves. Life gets in the way sometimes. Enjoy. :)
Harry raised his eyebrows.  “No?”
Hermione was laughing uncontrollably.  “Well, he
“Er, yes,” Harry replied, glancing at Flint, who was still laughing away.  “I’ve come to apologize — ”
“Are we in Hogsmeade?” Potter asked in surprise, but Draco didn’t bother stating the obvious, even for someone as clueless as the savior of the wizarding world.  “He lives in the Three Broomsticks?” Potter went on as Draco led him to the familiar inn.
“He has?” Harry asked, forgetting about the unfairness of these accusations for the moment.  “Is he alright?”  The Draco Malfoy from sixth year flashed before Harry’s eyes, with sallow skin and sunken cheeks, killing himself to complete an impossible task.  It made Harry’s insides churn to think he might ever look that way again.
“You’ve changed a lot since school,” was what Harry said in his defense.  “I want to know who you are
“Draco,” he tried again, as the Slytherin stood there fuming.  “I didn’t mean it.  I’m sorry.”
“Don’t worry, Greg,” Draco explained with an amused smirk, “Potter just wants to feel morally superior to everyone else and would actually prefer if you
With some unsteadiness, Harry made his way over to the chair in front of her desk and sat, taking a look around the room. It was much the same as it was when Dumbledore had been in charge, minus Fawkes and his perch. The pensieve still sat in a far corner and the previous Headmaster’s portraits lined the walls. Two notable additions were of course Dumbledore himself, and Severus Snape.
Ron shook his head, his face starting to turn the same color as his hair.  “Are you mad?” he shouted.  “He’s a spoiled brat, and as soon as daddy let him he became a Death Eater!”
rather pathetic,” Pansy allowed, daintily sipping from her teacup.  Tiny blue-painted birds flew across the ceramic as she set it down.  “But sweet, too.”
Dr. Finch’s eyes sparkled at the praise as she held her hand out.  Potter took her hand and shook it, though he looked mildly mortified by the comment about his wizard robes.  “Pleasure to meet you,” Dr. Finch said politely.
,” she told him, somewhat defensively.  “Just a little bummed out.”  She glanced at Hermione next to her, who gave her a sympathetic smile.
,” Parkinson interjected, and her face had returned to its usual bored state.  “He’s upset.”
Dr. Finch smiled back with what would have been a sympathetic expression if not for the mischievous glint in her eye.  “Harry,” she greeted, “I’m certainly glad to see you again.”
“I told you,” he snarked.
Harry was shaking his head even before Draco finished his question.  “Because I could see the real you back then too.  Only you were hiding better.”
Dr. Finch snorted, startling Draco from his thoughts.  “You’re worse than I was at your age,” she told him, looking amused.
“Puns are not permitted on the premises,” Parkinson admonished.  “And anyway, you should get going if you want to catch Blaise.  He normally leaves for the club about now.”
“Er,” Harry went on quickly, “well, there’s so much.  Like… Quidditch.”
Dr. Finch smiled gently as she returned her attention to her book.  “Take your time,” she insisted.
“Don’t waste your time being scared,” she told him suddenly, back to her usual self.
“Time to go,” Parkinson insisted, waving her hand toward the far wall, which held a small fireplace.  “You’re welcome to use the Floo.”
The-Boy-Who-Lived-To-Annoy-Draco-Malfoy shrugged slightly as he ran a hand through his already impossibly messy hair.  Draco wanted to swat his hand away, on behalf of all hairstylists.  “Well,” Potter started awkwardly, “I didn’t exactly apparate.”  He then held up a small antique key, rusted and attached to a thin cord.  Draco awaited elaboration, but Potter didn’t seem obliged to go on.
“Potter,” Malfoy insisted, the urgency palpable, “
want to take it further, another dark witch or wizard.  And one of them will be powerful enough to devastate the world again.  And then they will be taken down.  It goes on forever.  Fighting evil wizards won’t solve anything.  If you want to stop this war, you have to fight your battles in the minds of the children.  You have to show them what makes muggles special, the things they can do that wizardkind
Luckily, the owl was smarter than Potter — not surprising, really — and so as soon as Draco stepped outside, it lifted a taloned foot and scratched through the tie holding the scroll to its other leg, letting the severed ribbon and the paper fall inconspicuously to the ground, and flew away with a indignant hoot.  After waiting a moment for the spectators to turn away in disappointment, Draco leant down and swiftly retrieved the scroll.  As much as Draco wanted to feel irritated at Harry’s thoughtlessness, he couldn’t tamp down on the excitement swelling in his chest.  What was so important that Harry needed to write him?  Did he visit the shop and couldn’t wait around for Draco to return?  Was he finally breaking off his tenuous friendship with the Malfoy heir?  Draco couldn’t open the scroll fast enough, his fingers fumbling in his haste.
Harry suddenly imagined showing up in Zabini’s house alone, a wand in his face and no Draco beside him to mediate.  “You’re sure you wouldn’t like to lead?” Harry checked, hoping he didn’t look too panicked.
Harry smiled, because that was the biggest lie he’d ever heard.  “I’m listening.”
“Why would Potter be here for me?” Draco countered, bemused.  “I don’t work here, you do.”
you do, Harry?” Hermione asked curiously, all three of them turning on him.
being tousled more.  It was entirely unfair.
“Then you have to make sure he knows that.”
“Potter, as I said,” McGonagall replied tiredly, “you hold more influence than you seem to be aware of. If you start this trend, many will follow. I’m tired of dealing with the anti-Slytherin rhetoric just within these walls, let alone in the public arena.”
Vernon huffed in his unhappy way, and Harry heard the tell-tale signs of him struggling to get up from his couch seat.
Draco sighed, dropping his head onto the counter in defeat.  “He’s the worst person I’ve ever met,” he groaned, staring at the wood that was far too close to his eyes to see clearly.
With a helpless look at his friends, Harry gave Parkinson a clueless shrug.
“But what do you want to apologize to
“Absolutely not.”
“Then how – ” Harry began to splutter, feeling dread pool in his stomach.
Draco’s eyes fluttered open.
Draco cut him off with an exasperated sigh.  “I’m not saying they are,” he said tiredly.  “I’m just explaining how it works.  It’s not hate.  That’s why so many normal people can feel superior without wanting to hurt anyone.  I feel superior to cats, but that doesn’t mean I want to hurt them.”  He sighed again, looking very worn out.  “This war you think you’ve won, it will never be over.  The magical world will always hold disdain for the non-magical one.  Parents will continue to pass down their beliefs, however benign, however subtle, and every once in a while, those beliefs will culminate in someone who
Harry shook his head to clear his thoughts.  Malfoy wasn’t his problem anymore.  It was Voldemort he had to worry about now.  After the death of his godfather, Harry wasn’t willing to lose anyone else to the machinations of Tom Riddle.  He couldn’t wait out the summer like this again, just sitting for months while Voldemort was out there.  He needed to act.
“That hardly counts,” Draco muttered at last.  “You barely said a word.”
Harry felt uncomfortable with the whole arrangement.  These were people who had chosen the wrong side, yes, but if history had fallen out differently, these headstones would list
Flint glanced at Draco again, seeming distressed.
Scrunching up his nose in distaste, Draco answered, “He’s… rather uncouth.”
…unlike Draco’s icy grey ones…
Draco rolled his eyes, but didn’t meet Harry’s gaze again.  He was worried his face might give away something he didn’t want it to.  “A lapse of judgement on my part, but I suppose it’s unavoidable.”  He took another sip of his butterbeer to make sure his throat was going to continue working and not do that thing where it sounded all breathy and nervous.  “Who are we harassing today?”
Harry’s chest felt like it was filled with bricks, and he dragged his feet to compensate for the weight.  “You don’t only have to do things that will reward you,” Harry mumbled dejectedly.  “Sometimes you can just do things to be nice.”
Malfoy screwed up his eyes and took a deep breath.  When he opened them, there was a look of determination on his face.  “Potter, the Dark Lord is going to attack this house tonight.  He is going to kill you and anyone here.  There’s not much time.  You need to leave.”
Harry shrugged, rubbing his forehead with his hand to relieve some stress.  “I don’t know,” he admitted.  “He’d said in a few days.”
Harry shrugged, not keen on telling them the subject of his preoccupation.  Merlin, they’d just get on him for stalking Malfoy again, like this was even close to the same thing.
Taking his cue, Draco drew himself up to a dignified height and strode out the door.
“Well,” Ron said casually, as if they weren’t discussing his least favorite person in the world.  “You apologized then.  How did it go?”
ridiculous!  Dumbledore had done everything he could to protect muggles from people like Voldemort.  How could Malfoy say all that with a straight face?  “You’re one to talk,” Harry spat.  “You never did anything except what your father told you.”
Draco rolled his eyes.  Surely Potter must know about Shakespeare.  Even Draco was aware of him before coming to the muggle world.  He was one of many classical artists who had run ins with magical creatures and wizardkind.  He’d written whole plays dedicated to the magical sights he’d seen.  Either Potter really was that thick, or he hadn’t been paying any attention in Professor Binns' History of Magic classes.  “Shall we?” he said, gesturing to the door.
“If he was, you got the best of him,” Draco had said pointedly.
leading either of them on — but Connor swooped in to save him from replying.  “We’ll see you later, Dr. Finch,” he said genially, holding the door open.
He was still there, staring at Harry with a coalescence of frustration and sympathy on his face.  He hastily schooled his features when he saw Harry watching.  “I see,” he said blandly.  Neither made a move for a tense moment.  Draco’s fingers twitched, like he wanted to reach out to Harry.  Harry hoped he did.  “I didn’t finish my drink,” Draco said instead, with a cool look at Harry.
“Merlin, no!” Draco burst out, nearly choking on his drink.
“And this portkey is dead now,” Potter added sheepishly.
Glancing over, Draco registered that Potter was grinning and resisted the urge to grin back, instead opting for a bored and slightly disgruntled grimace.
“Potter,” Malfoy groaned, glaring at Harry, “there’s no time to gather your things – ”
Dr. Finch would’ve saved that woman too.  How could he stand here and pretend he was worthy of these heroes?  He wasn’t like them.  He was just a boy without a spine.  If he couldn’t stand up for what was right back then when it had mattered, how could he claim to have changed now the danger was passed?  If Dr. Finch knew him back then, would she be talking to him today?  He’d never wanted to reveal the wizarding world to her so badly as he did right then, when the words to explain his predicament failed him.
Connor gave him a bemused look.  “Who?”
Draco couldn’t be seen in public with him; Harry would embarrass them both.  It would just be awkward.  Harry would realize that Draco was the scum of the earth while he was some sort of Jesus figure, and he would never want to see Draco again.  Draco should write back, to tell him it wouldn’t work, they should stick to apologies and rejections, because that suited them much better than whatever this budding friendship had in store.
Connor rolled his eyes good-naturedly.  “You stood me up for another guy, right?  So, what’s his name?”
“Er,” Harry replied slowly.
“Oh there’s no need to apologize again, Harry,” she assured him, gracing him with another coquettish smile despite his abrupt disinterest.  “I already know you’re half-blood.  It’s my business to know.  But it really can’t be helped.  So many pure wizarding families have diluted their bloodlines with muggle filth, there’s hardly any purebloods left.  It’s a travesty.”  She shook her head sadly, seeming to misinterpret Harry’s unease for understanding, and rushed to acquit him.  “At least your father was pure.  Shame about the mudblood mother.  I’m sure you’re nothing like her though.”  Her eyes were full of compassion, as if she were doing Harry a grand favor by accepting him and his half-blood status.
She smirked knowingly at him.  “Leading those two boys on.”
Potter smiled big, and Draco scowled at him.  “Yes,” Potter confirmed.  “That would be lovely, thank you.”
“It was
“I don’t know what sort of pureblood game you’re playing at,” Harry spat out, clearly no longer impressed by Daphne or her enchanted home, “but Draco isn’t your plaything.  So stop harassing him, and — you know what? — apology retracted.  You’re as bad as I
It was the weirdest moment of Harry’s life — and he’d time-traveled.  Just watching his Gryffindor friends warming up to this abrasive and icy Slytherin was like finding out Santa Clause was real
“I’ve come to apologize,” he plowed on, hoping to appease her.  “I was a right git to you in school.”
“It’s good to see you, Lavender,” Draco said politely, absentmindedly taking a sip of his tea and frowning at the sweetness of it.
Harry stared at him a few seconds longer than necessary.  Even forced, his smile was charming.  “I think I’m done for today.”
Malfoy glanced at him, then away at the windows again.  “I can’t come with you, Harry,” he stated calmly.
“I guess it was all my fault,” Draco went on.  His fists clenched all on their own.  He could still feel the way his wounds had glued themselves to his shirt with the damp, sticky blood that seeped between his fingers, impossible to keep in.  “I’m responsible for almost bleeding out on the floor that day, I’m the one to blame for the scars on my chest.”
“My point,” Draco abruptly stated, conversationally, as if there had never been a break in their discussion, “was simply that there are plenty of witches and wizards today who aren’t dark and evil, who don’t wish death on anyone, and yet they still believe in magical superiority.  And when magic-kind lives or spends most of their time in places where muggles aren’t around, they lose touch.”
At least Crabbe had been there for Draco, had supported him through thick and thin, had beat up anyone who Draco didn’t like.  Harry wondered if Crabbe would beat him up for upsetting Draco these past few weeks, if he were still alive.  He probably would.
, Potter.”
long.
“My girlfriend is not a curse, Draco,” an admonishing voice said from the doorway.  Draco rolled his eyes as Lavender Brown sauntered in to take a seat practically on Pansy’s lap.
“Do,” Lavender told him as she slid deftly onto Pansy’s lap.
, and I just can’t seem to get it
Harry shifted on his feet awkwardly.  “Could you show me?”
“Ah,” said the old woman, “an excellent query.  You’re familiar with the phrase ‘Here be dragons’?”  She looked at him expectantly.
“I’m afraid not,” Draco said.  In all honesty, it was a common sign in the wizarding world for dragon-infested areas, but in a muggle context Draco was unsure.
“Shut
“But it
Draco nodded patiently.  He always had excess patience for Greg — and Vince, when he’d been around.  It was still hard to see Greg without Vince there too.  They’d been inseparable, like twins, and Draco knew Vincent’s death must’ve hit Greg harder than anyone, but Draco still avoided him when he could.  It was selfish, and unfair to Greg after how good a friend he’d proven to be all these years, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to face that loss yet.  Even three and a half years later, Vince’s dying scream as he fell into the fiendfyre still haunted him.  Looking at Greg just brought back those last terrifying moments in the Room of Requirement, sweat dripping down Draco’s neck, the realization that they were going to be burned alive settling into his bones.
“Which is why,” Potter went on obliviously, “I’m
Draco nodded quickly, not meeting his eyes.  “Harry is,” he went on, hoping to distract from his slip-up, “a very good person.”
genetics.”
“Well, who else!” Hermione cried, throwing up her arms.
Harry rubbed his eyes under his glasses, yawning.  It was a wonder his patronus was a stag and not some type of feline.  “Alright,” Harry agreed easily, and Draco was rather taken aback that he hadn’t put up a fight.
Draco froze, gaze fixed on a battered dart board across from them.  Harry had never been that direct before.  Neither of them had.  It was like a soft, soothing melody curling up in Draco’s ears.  It was dangerous.
“Thanks for this,” Connor said with his dimpled grin, placing the romance novel on the desk for Dr. Finch to ring up.  “And, maybe,” he went on, plucking one of the bookstore’s business cards and a pen off the desk and scribbling something on the back of it, “you could call me.”  He handed Draco the card, making sure their fingers brushed.  “I’m here a few weeks, it’d be nice to have a local guide.  If you’re up to it.”
“Scotland,” Draco answered shortly.  It was too much effort to be nice to Potter for long, and Draco found himself gradually slipping back into his usual disinterested demeanor.
, Potter,” Draco insisted with frustration.  “When you think you’re above something else, you don’t hate them.  You just think they’re worth less than you.  Their lives are worth less than yours.  It just makes sense.”
“Oh, don’t encourage him,” Malfoy — no,
“Probably because it’s true,” Ros answered unsympathetically.
When she took her book and turned, Draco could tell he’d been dismissed.  Heart heavy with unsaid words, Draco made his way silently to the door, trying to ignore the telltale sob which emanated from behind Dr. Finch’s desk.
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered into the quiet, still air.  He tried to think of any good memories he had of Crabbe, or at least not bad ones.  Nothing came to mind.  But that was alright; those good memories of Crabbe weren’t for him.  They belonged in the hearts of Crabbe’s family and friends.  It was enough to know that they existed.
“Parkinson,” Harry greeted politely, thinking it best not to use her first name without express permission.
“It wasn’t his fault,” Harry said, but it came out more defensive than he meant it.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Connor take a long sip of his beer.  He must be regretting this conversation.  Before Draco could change the subject however, he put his drink down and turned to face Draco more fully.  “Do you want to make out and forget about him for a bit?” Connor asked bluntly.
“Wait, if this is a muggle street,” Potter said loudly, rudely interrupting Draco’s thoughts, “what are you doing here?”
Before Potter could say a word, Draco shoved the map into his hands and stomped back into The Dragon’s Lair.
name — it had just slipped out in his anger — but at least Harry hadn’t seemed to notice.  Harry would’ve never let
There was a brief awkward silence where Harry desperately tried to think of something to say.
“Er,” Harry replied, wracking his brains for anything he’d done that might have led to this situation.
“I do it all the time, Potter, don’t look so panicked,” Draco muttered behind him, and Harry spun around in alarm.
“Yes,” Harry confirmed eagerly, hoping to make the situation less awkward.
“I hurt
Harry chewed his lip, lost in thoughts of an emaciated Draco dying in bed with no one to care for him.  “He already agreed to meet with me,” he muttered distractedly.
“Are you going to keep staring at me?” Draco snapped, and Harry blinked, averting his eyes only to look right back at Draco’s face.  There wasn’t anything else interesting to look at in this dank place.  At least, that was the excuse Harry was going with.
, he disappears for a week and it drives you insane!  So yes, he’s the worst person I’ve ever met because at least the Death Eaters were predictable,
“Also, your house is tacky,” Harry added, as if this was an important point, and Draco couldn’t help but crack a grin.
weather.
a crime to – ” Draco cut himself off before he admitted too much.  It was a crime to torture people, it was a crime to assist a mass murderer.  “Harry was always so brave.  And I was always a coward.”
But what could he do?  He was barely sixteen, he had no access to the wizarding world’s news, and Dumbledore had made him promise to stay put with his horrible aunt and uncle.  If he couldn’t trust Dumbledore’s judgement, who
Snape was completely unreadable. And silent. Harry bit his tongue to stop from rambling any further. Finally, Snape opened his mouth. “Yes, I know you do, Potter, I’m not an idiot.”
“Finally,” Snape muttered snidely.
With a sigh, Harry sat up and slumped off his mattress, opting for the chair by his window instead.  He’d sent Hedwig out with letters to Ron and Hermione the previous day, and she had yet to return.  His friends were both staying at the Burrow, a fact that Harry tried desperately hard not to be too jealous about.  Why did they get to be there together, but Harry was forced to hide out with the muggles who hated his guts?
“Well,” Draco said, voice like ice, “you failed.”
Blaise was leading them down a hall, the sounds of the party fading as they got farther away from the source.  The hall was filled with portraits of all the men Blaise’s mother had married and purportedly killed; there were eight so far.  Neither Draco nor Blaise were under the illusion that she was innocent, but in their book she was smart enough to not ever be caught and that was an admirable feat in itself.
“Well, do it quick,” Parkinson demanded, standing and smoothing out her blouse.  “I can’t stand it when he sulks.”  She turned to Hermione and Ron, apparently done with Harry.  “It was a pleasure to meet you on friendly terms.  I hope to see you both again.”  She leaned down and kissed Hermione on the cheek and then turned on her heel to stride out of the restaurant.
Draco gaped at him.
“It’s still illegal,” Harry groaned, rubbing his temples like that could expel the knowledge of Draco’s illicit activities from his brain.  “I work for the Ministry, I can’t know these things.”
“Millicent,” Harry tried again with a burst of confidence, “you deserve more than how us Gryffindors treated you, and — ”
He was a vision, an angel, glowing white-gold in front of Harry.  If he could just touch him.
This was a horrendous mistake.
Hermione sighed, looking at Ron for help.  “Mate,” Ron cut in as Harry frowned at them, “you kind of have a habit of bothering Malfoy.”
“No,” Harry denied angrily, predictable as always, “I’m doing it because — ”
“Not mutual,” Draco grunted, trying to sound unaffected, like what Harry said hadn’t been exactly what Draco wanted to hear.  Already he could feel his bitterness towards the other man dissolving like ice on sun-hot pavement.
“Shit,” Harry muttered and glanced up at the clock just as it turned to 12:01. Letting the memo fall onto his desk, Harry grabbed his travelling cloak in a rush and bolted toward the emergency auror’s floo fireplace. Professor McGonagall had taken to opening her office fireplace to the ministry’s floo network whenever she and Harry had a meeting, since he had rather consistently forgot and had to floo in last minute. Travelling by floo was still slightly disorienting to Harry and so when he stepped through into the Headmistress’s office, he nearly fell over if not for the wall he was able to lean against.
“I don’t want any funny business, you hear?” he warned, glowering as threateningly as he was able.
“Oh,” Harry said, perplexed. He tried to conjure up memories of some unnamed Slytherin girl but nothing really came to mind. “Er…what’s she got to do with this?”
“No,” Harry snorted like Draco had said something ridiculous.  “Of course not.”
Slytherins were, so I guess I wasn’t all wrong.”
Potter raised his eyebrows at Draco’s no-nonsense tone.  “Alright,” he agreed amiably.
“Malfoy!” Harry called after him, jogging to catch up again.
And Ronald Weasley had saved Greg, which Draco was endlessly grateful for, though he would never for the life of him admit that to the arrogant ginger.
Harry, for defending him at his trial, and Harry had said
“He’s not a friend,” Draco insisted, fishing out a £5 note from his wallet and placing it on her desk.
this.”  His voice cracked on the word ‘fix’ and it was taking every ounce of strength Draco had not to cave in to his desire to wrap this man up in his arms.  He hadn’t thought those green eyes could become any more compelling, but the water welling up in them made them positively spellbinding.  “I can’t do this without you,” he admitted quietly, slightly more composed.  “Please, Draco, don’t make me do it alone.”
“Oh,” Dr. Finch said, waving her other hand as she pushed a map toward them across her desk, “on the house, of course.  A friend of Draco’s is a friend of mine.”
It made him want to give up and snog Harry until his legs gave out.
“Whatever it is, you’re on your own,” Draco snapped.
At last, he held the paper open, eyes drinking in each word hungrily.  It read:
There was a beat where Potter looked expectantly at Draco, as if awaiting applause.
Fifteen minutes.  How could they escape in so little time?
“I think that’s quite enough for the day, Potter, wouldn’t you agree?”  Draco had placed his hands in his pockets, as if to keep them from Harry.  It was just as well, seeing as Harry felt a strong urge to snatch them up again, and Merlin knew what curse Draco would cast on him then.
an accomplishment.  You made the people you cared about happy.”  Harry rubbed tiredly at his eyes, feeling himself droop.  “I wish
Draco waited, schooling his expression.
Potter frowned in thought.  “That’s not true,” he muttered.  “We’ve talked before….”
Now that Harry had noticed Draco’s attractiveness — and
“Hello, Millicent,” he began, and the girl was definitely not pleased by the use of her first name.  The hand not holding a platter of drinks was in a fist against her waist.  Her pitch black hair that that was pulled up in a loose bun looked about as desperate to run away from her as Harry was in that instant.
Ros barked out a laugh and patted him on the back genially.  “I’m sure that’s not true,” she crooned indulgently.
, Potter not Harry — and said, “Well, you were pretty busy talking about yourself.”
Draco let go of Connor’s hand and swallowed dryly.  “What were you looking for?” he asked, remembering he had a job to do.  He glanced guiltily at Dr. Finch, but she was studiously ignoring them in favor or examining a text on Latin poetry, a small smirk on her face.
Potter wiped his expression clean as he faced Draco, stuffing his hands in his pockets.  “Alright, well,” he started hesitantly, “I know I said things all wrong last time.  So I’m sorry for that.”  Potter paused and bit his lip.
“You wouldn’t have to pay me,” he blurted, a little too desperately.
Only slightly panicked, Draco skittered back to Dr. Finch, and gestured that Connor was her problem now, but before he could turn tail and flee from this mess of a situation, Connor stopped him with a light touch on his elbow.  Swallowing, Draco faced him again.
“No.”  Draco crossed his arms, standing his ground.
“Of course you do, darling,” Pansy laughed out, then squealed as Lavender presumably took her by surprise.
him, you know,
is predictable.  But what Potter is is terrible, because he’s just stupid and heroic and always trying to
do you want to see Greg?”
“So does this mean you accept my apology?” he asked cockily.
“Potter, get up, you’re in my seat,” Draco grouched, stopping to his right.
“I won’t let you,” Draco replied instantly.
Harry shook his head as they walked toward the door.  “I don’t think it would look good to apologize with a drink in my hand.”
Without warning, Potter shouted, “Oh!” and Draco had to catch himself before he stumbled back into the shelves.  “We were eleven years old in Madam Malkin’s robe shop!  It was the first time we met.”
Connor grinned at him, eyes crinkling.  “You could make it up to me,” he suggested, shrugging playfully.  The first time Draco had met Connor, all this flirting had felt refreshing and fun.  Now there was something missing.  Probably Harry Potter.  Draco idly wondered if Harry would burst in this time too.
incident.  “That went well,” he sighed in frustration, and after a quick glance around to make sure he was alone, he apparated back to his flat.
“I…” Harry struggled. “I just don’t think it’s…it’s actually supporting unity.”
“Is that all you know about me?” he scoffed, but there was something more hiding behind his mocking tone.  Was it resentment, or hurt?
Merlin, these reports were not getting written. Harry glanced at the wall clock and breathed a sigh of relief. It was almost his lunch break. He idly wondered if Draco would be getting his lunch soon. …What did he eat? What was his favourite food?
Draco looked over at him, startled from his thoughts.  “Pardon?”
aplologized,” Harry insisted, butchering the word ‘apologize’, “on two separate occasions, but he won’t forgive me.”
he trust?
Draco swallowed heavily, feeling as if peanut butter was sticking to his mouth.  But he had to ask.  “If the man who killed Tatiana,” Draco began, “came to you today and said he was sorry, that he didn’t believe that way anymore…would that really change anything?  Would who he is now even matter?”
It was silent for a moment.  Then his aunt said, very calmly, “I knew this day would come.”
Ron blurted out a surprised “Blimey!” before he and Hermione exchanged a knowing look.
smarter than he is — because animals can sense danger and Potter bloody well can’t.  Most people, as you previously suggested, would run when they see me glaring daggers at them — but
Draco rolled his eyes and turned to give a pleading look to Dr. Finch, a look that said “Please make him leave.”
Nott looked like he was about to threaten Harry again, but the shopkeeper starting shouting at Nott to get back to work, and the hair-creature was gurgling at a higher volume now, seemingly upset by the disturbance.
Harry just snorted, and the sound sent shivers down Draco’s spine for some reason that Draco refused to think about.  “I thought you’d say that,” Harry replied, still as infuriatingly cheerful as usual.  “But you promised you’d help me apologize to the other Slytherins, so there’s no backing out now.”
“Alright then,” Potter said, perking up.  “Shall we go?”
I hope this longer chapter is worth it :)
“You’re smiling,” Greg clarified, crossing his meaty arms with a suspicious look.
Blaise’s lips curled up in a smirk as he met Draco’s eyes.  “Twice?”
boy here to see you,” Vernon growled out, emphasizing ‘strange’ in the way he did to avoid the word ‘magic’ or ‘wizard’.  The Dursleys seemed to think not acknowledging the wizarding world would make it go away, though Harry thought their lives would be less stressful if they just accepted it.
Dr. Finch was unfazed.  “How can I help you, Mr. Potter?”
“Right, well, Parkinson,” Harry tried again, “I just wanted to tell you that I’m sorry for my behavior in school.  I shouldn’t have dismissed you so easily just for being a Slytherin, and I should’ve respected you more as a witch.  You’re brilliant, and I never recognized that at Hogwarts.  You deserved more credit, and I know that was hard to get while I was, er, kind of taking all the attention.”
a rude Englishman,” he remarked jovially, and Draco had to grin back.
“I’m not taking you home, Potter, so you’d best spit it out,” Malfoy muttered, as if reading Harry’s mind.
“Oh, not this again – ”
“Apology accepted, I suppose,” Malfoy said graciously, and the money disappeared into his pocket.
and handed it over.
“That was different!  He was working for Voldemort!”
Draco wrinkled his nose at the choice of drink; it was far too ostentatious for the occasion.
“You should be. She was in your year.”
“Oh Harry,” Hermione said gently, a kind smile on her face.  “We love you.  That will never change.”
, Potter?” Draco reiterated in annoyance.  He wished Potter could’ve stayed away, and not cut short his encounter with that attractive American.  Connor.  It was such a lovely name, Connor.  He looked forward to saying it more.
Draco turned back to his strange, tipsy companion.  “It’s late,” Draco declared, crossing his arms just so he had something to do with his hands.  “I’m not taking you to anyone else tonight.”
a lot. I mean, I…well, I rather fancy him.”
Hermione pursed her lips and Ron gave a half-shrug, but neither of them spoke.
“Fine,” Harry sighed dramatically.  “I’ve been…seeing Malfoy — ”
The Zabini Mansion was similar to Malfoy Manor in its grandeur — though this Mansion was a much more recent development — except for the fact that the Zabinis rarely used their home for anything other than posh soirées.  Socialites from all over the U.K. and sometimes further were constantly at the Mansion; Draco couldn’t fathom how Blaise or his mother ever got any rest.  The Zabinis entertained guests as often as most people ate meals.  It was exhausting to even think about.
“Hold on,” Harry shouted over the wind, and Draco only nodded as he slipped onto the Nimbus behind Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist.  As they lifted into the air, Harry couldn’t tell if the thrill shooting up his spine was from the flight or from the feeling of Draco hugging him from behind.  He could feel the other boy’s chest pressed tightly against his own back, Draco’s face tucked into Harry’s shoulder, and it was doing strange things to Harry’s stomach.
, he could — if he just closed the space between them.  Maybe dragged his fingers over those sharp cheekbones.  Caressed his jaw.
to him, like I told you I was going to, and then I went to see him
“It might be weird to just show up and apologize,” Potter explained.
Draco
“Fine, you uncouth gorilla,” Draco snapped, stopping in his tracks and turning to face the other man.  “Sober up and apologize.”
Snape snorted. Dumbledore gave a soft smile. “Well, Harry, sometimes lending your voice to others is more significant than saying the words yourself.”
“Malfoy?” Potter said in surprise, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.  “You want me to introduce you to Greg?” he echoed slowly.  Of all the things Potter could have said, this was the last thing Draco had expected.
Glancing around, Harry popped open his mostly packed trunk and tossed in a couple textbooks he’d been leafing through, and his favorite quill and ink, before snapping it closed again and setting it beside his bunk.  He hardly unpacked while staying at number four, Privet Drive, and so there wasn’t much to prepare.  Presumably, Ron would come up and help him carry everything, since neither of them could use magic yet, so Harry left it all there and bounded down out of his room and down the stairs, eager to see his best mate again.
Hermione sat next to him, looking at Harry with concern.  “Harry,” she said in her most condescending voice, “this isn’t really healthy, is it?”
Draco hesitated.  A drink didn’t mean anything.  It could just be a friendly gesture.    And he did feel bad for forgetting his promise to Connor.  “Alright,” he found himself saying, trying not to think of any possible ramifications, like Potter somehow finding out and never wanting to speak to Draco again.  Besides, it wasn’t like he owed Harry anything.  Perhaps Connor was just the distraction Draco needed to get his mind off that insufferable wizard.
“But Hermione,” Ron argued, like he couldn’t stay quiet for the life of him, “there’s plenty of fit blokes for Harry to shag that aren’t ex-Death Eaters — ”
, though?” Ron blurted suddenly.  “Of all the blokes — ”
The other man looked rather taken aback by Draco’s harsh tone.  “Er,” he said, ducking his head a bit, “Where am I, exactly?”
Draco dropped his hands to stare at her.  “Pardon?”
Harry grinned at them. “Yes. Yes, I do.” And with that he rushed toward the fireplace and flood back to the ministry, feeling electrified.
“You’re sure he’s not here for you?” Greg checked, and Draco blinked out of his reverie.
“Merlin’s beard,” Draco breathed.
him often, and – well, I’m not entirely sure how
Harry thought. “Oh!” he said suddenly. “That’s perfect! Thank you, professor” – he turned to Snape – “professors. I appreciate all the advice. And I…I’ll tell him.”
The pleading look Potter gave him, which made his green eyes seem that much more prominent in his face, was not at all what swayed Draco to turn and lead him down the road.  It was simply because he’d made his point and didn’t fancy standing still in the cold any longer.  Nothing Harry Potter did could persuade Draco to do anything.  Not even batting those sinfully thick lashes.
Draco stared at him.
“Of course, he’s just in the storeroom,” Ros told him, shooing him away with a flick of her wrist while keeping her eyes locked on the Boy Who Lived.
Draco looked ethereal in the dim lighting at their booth, all white-gold skin and carefully styled hair in a striking emerald button-up.  The only thing marring him was the sneer he wore on his face, and even that seemed lovely somehow.
Predictably, the other man stopped.  “Er,” he answered worriedly, “I just…am happy to see you?”
“You did,” Potter agreed quickly.  “You did, Draco.”
“An interesting idea, Potter,” he said blandly, as if he was bored with this whole interaction.  “I’m glad you feel better about yourself.”
Draco nearly choked, but managed to appear unruffled.  “You want to…?”
“Reading,” he settled on, remembering the muggle bookstore that Draco spent so much of his time in.  “Learning about the muggle world.”
“Honestly, Ron,” Hermione admonished, giggling uncontrollably, “it’s not funny.”
“Is that supposed to mean something to me?” he sighed, crossing his arms.  It really was quite cold and he longed for the cozy warmth of the bookstore.
“And?” the Slytherin girl prompted, seeming to be fishing for a particular response.
The stars were hidden behind dark clouds, and between the whipping winds and the torrential downfall, Harry was hard-pressed to see anything even resembling a snow owl in the sky.  The storm just made him feel more pent up.  What he’d give to take his Firebolt out for a ride, even in
Bulstrode made no move to stop them or hurry them along, but her hooded eyes followed them to the door.  She was a large woman, only rivaled in size by the Beauxbatons headmistress Madame Maxime.  The dress and apron she wore were heavily stained, and the scowl on her face looked rather permanent.  Perhaps it wasn’t personal after all.  Feeling a twinge of pity, Harry yanked himself from Draco’s grip and jogged back over to Bulstrode, who still watched him like a hawk.
“Oh,” Harry hastened to say, “I just wanted to let you know that – well, I wanted to apologize to you.”
“Now Draco,” Daphne chided, though her voice was still honey-sweet, “don’t be a bully.”
Draco stared at Harry for a long moment.  That was not the sort of insightful comment he expected to come from Potter’s mouth.  He hadn’t even realized Harry had noticed Greg at all in school.  It wasn’t like they’d even spoken to each other before.  But there was something in Harry’s eyes now that was far too understanding of Draco’s insecurities, and Draco had to break eye contact with him and resume their walk to the pub.
When Draco was released, his mother insisted he get a position at the Ministry, but Draco knew that wasn’t going to happen.  For one, no sane person in the magical community would hire an ex-Death Eater.  But for another, Draco didn’t want to go back to how things were before, where the Malfoys were both feared and hated, and only a very few members of society thought them respectable.  He wanted to be invisible, as if he was wearing Potter’s famous cloak, and he wanted to do something quiet, peaceful.  It was pure luck he found The Dragon’s Lair on a rainy day about a month after his release.  He’d been wondering muggle streets, looking for something to catch his eye.  The name made him pause.  It was almost dusk, and he’d promised to have dinner with mother, but he couldn’t resist walking into the shop.  It was a dimly-lit bookstore, with dust on every surface, and a tiny old woman sitting behind her desk.
Blaise considered him for a moment, and it seemed like he was taking Harry seriously for the first time.  “Have you apologized to Draco?”
Flint turned his worried grey eyes on Draco, who stood behind Harry so he couldn’t see what he did, but Flint’s worry seemed to have diminished by the time he addressed Harry again.  “What do you want?” he asked gruffly, like he wasn’t used to being civil.
“Forgive me,” Draco said, shoving the note into his pocket and straightening up to a dignified height.  “I have to go meet that boy I was telling you about.”
The silence that followed was palpable.  Hermione finally came over and rested a hand on Harry’s shoulder, but he shrugged it off.  “Harry,” she tried, “It wasn’t your fault.”
magical and muggle relations!”
“How are you?” Draco asked, trying to avoid the real reason he hadn’t called — or even thought of — Connor, which was that the most famous wizard alive kept whisking him away on apology sprees and that Draco was pathetically in love with the tosser.
“Fine,” Draco grumbled, glaring at him again.  “Wait for me outside.  I have to tell Dr. Finch that I’m taking a
The stone didn’t respond, didn’t move, and Harry was almost disappointed that it didn’t rear up and punch him in the face.  There were no ghosts here.  Vincent Crabbe wasn’t buried here — hardly any bodies were actually buried here.  All there was were names.  Names couldn’t hurt him.  And they couldn’t comfort him.  And right then, there was only one name that mattered.
“I’m glad we got to spend
Malfoy glanced back at him, raising an eyebrow haughtily.  “Don’t get all sentimental on me
Harry crossed his arms on the threshold, unsure what was happening but not willing to go along without an explanation.  “I’m not going anywhere with you,
“It does no good to dwell on the past.”  Dr. Finch turned her attention back to the book she was examining on her desk, ignoring the pained expression colouring Draco’s pallid features.
“What’s wrong with
“It’s not about dark wizards, Potter!” Draco exploded, only lowering his voice to a hiss when he saw people looking.  “It’s about belief,” he went on vehemently.  “Do you really think only ‘evil’ people believed in magical superiority?  Do you really think it’s that black and white?  Where do these ideas stem from, do you think?”  Draco’s eyes were dark and dangerous, and he was leaning toward Harry now, which was severely impacting Harry’s ability to concentrate on the other boy’s words.  “They come from places like Hogwarts.  Or your precious Ministry of Magic.”
Ron snorted.  “What are you going on about, Harry?  He was a git, not you.”
The two girls smirked at each other, and Draco frowned.  “Figured what out?”
“Thanks,” Connor said, and then winking at Dr. Finch behind the counter: “It was good to meet you too, Doctor.”
“There was nothing I could do back then,” Dr. Finch said, expression softening out with a more muted melancholia.  “Too many things had to be kept secret.”
— chastised and pulled Harry away by his arm.  Glancing over his shoulder, Harry tried to give Goyle an apologetic smile but he was already making his way back to the pub.  As they walked, Harry noticed that Draco hadn’t let go of Harry’s arm, which he held in a loose grip, but Harry said nothing, not wanting to bring that to Draco’s attention.
Malfoy stiffened, stopping in his tracks and whirling on Harry.  The glare Malfoy gave him could kill.  “
Ros gave him an unimpressed look even though Draco hadn’t technically lied.  “No,” she agreed, “not everything.  But this is.”
“Yeah, Greg,” Draco confirmed apologetically.  “He’s being real stubborn about it.”
Draco frowned, crossing his arms.  “How do you know there’s a park?  Have you been stalking me?”  Maybe it hadn’t been stupid to lead Potter away from his home the other day after all.
“Why?” Ron growled right back.
Connor smirked.  “Well, it’s not the first time I’ve seen that.  Are you two dating then?”
that?” Harry said in bewilderment, desperately trying to keep his voice at a whisper.  “
Laughing, Draco asked, “You had
There was a pause where Rosmerta was undoubtedly deciding whether or not to impart some bit of wisdom.  “Harry,” she finally said, “it’s not about what was done, but about how much you regret having done it.”
Maybe Draco should just snog Connor and get it over with.  It was perfect; Connor wouldn’t be sticking around anyway.
was the one touching Harry’s arm and making his heart race.  Until Harry slid his hand up to meet Daphne’s and brought her hand to his lips for a flirtatious kiss.  Draco had to bite his lip hard not to intervene.  Daphne was shameless.  But then her eyes slid to Draco’s and she winked.  It was still all for Draco’s benefit then.  Wonderful.  At least Potter wasn’t at risk.
Hermione gave him an annoyed glance.
I'm so sorry for the delay; I'm doing my best!
She looked him over appraisingly, like she was trying to see if he was up to something.  It reminded him of Professor McGonagall.  Finally, the woman offered her hand with a warm smile.  Draco took it gratefully.  “You may call me Dr. Finch.”
Oblivious, Potter rambled on, “…I didn’t know what that spell would do, Malfoy, I would never have done that to you on purpose — ”
And Harry was in so much trouble.
“You haven’t anyone in mind, have you?” Draco demanded, turning to face him at last.  Potter was looking guiltily into his butterbeer.  “For Merlin’s sake, Potter, no wonder your apologies are so rubbish — you just make them up on the spot, don’t you?”
“And who is the target this time?”
“Greg,” Draco announced, and his friend jumped, straightening up to face him.  “I’m sorry to bother you at work.”
, Draco thought to himself warily,
“He probably won’t try again.”
“How long do we have?” Harry whispered.  No one was listening but it felt safer to keep their voices down.
“No, I’m serious,” Draco insisted, “you can’t go bothering him if he, say, doesn’t accept your dumb apology, alright?”
Snape’s brow raised again. “I do, in fact,” he replied blandly.
Draco let himself smile back.  There was nothing wrong with being charmed by a very forward customer.  “I relate to the rude British man who is really just looking out for his friends.”
“Er, right,” Harry began, trying to focus on the woman in front of him and not on Draco’s smirk he could see out of the corner of his eye.  “Pansy — can I call you – ”
“It’s not about the same thing so it doesn’t count,” Harry cut him off hastily.  “I’m just sorry that I didn’t get back to you sooner.  I wasn’t sure how much space you needed so I opted for longer.”
Potter was shaking his head before Draco finished his question.  “Malfoy,” he insisted, “I’m trying to tell you, that’s not what I meant.”
“And that was so private?” Draco muttered, studying the arm of the couch he was sitting against.  It was unclear if he meant for anyone to hear him.
Dr. Finch lifted her gaze from her Latin text and studied his face.  “Take the day off, dear,” she said.  “You needn’t be overhasty.”
“You’re coming,” Harry insisted stubbornly, “or I’m staying.”
Harry snorted.  “Draco,” he stressed, “even
“And to the first bit?” Draco questioned darkly, voice and eyes like steel.
He just really needed to see Draco Malfoy.
Downstairs, Harry could hear the television humming out the theme song to one of Dudley’s favorite shows.  The Dursleys had been as unpleasant as ever this summer, but they left Harry alone for the most part.  They’d never been particularly fond of his presence, but now they shied away from him, clearly fearful.  It almost made Harry smile.  And it almost made him sick.  However vile the Dursleys were, there was something disturbing about feeling unsafe in your own home.  It made Harry think of another vile person whom the Order claimed had become the base house for Voldemort.  And Draco Malfoy was stuck there because of his parents, not because of his own choices.
Pansy sniffed haughtily, tucking her legs under herself on the sofa.  “I think you mean stubbornness.  And if that’s a quality you dislike so much, I’m surprised you lasted a day in Slytherin.”
“What?” Draco exclaimed, turning to face him again and brushing off his hand.
“Yes,” Draco said curtly, and somehow saying that one word aloud brought a smile to his face.  “The one I’m madly in love with.”
Hermione smacked his arm.  “Ron!” she stressed, as if reminding him of a promise.
Potter grimaced.
“Do you need any help?” Draco asked suddenly, and the old woman raised her eyebrows in surprise.  “I mean, do you need an assistant, to help around the shop?”
“I suppose you’re right,” Harry allowed, but he felt rather reluctant to part ways just yet.  When did spending time with Draco become so crucial to his wellbeing?  It felt as if were he to leave now, something inside him would shatter.
Harry forced himself not to grin too widely at that in fear of Draco changing his mind, but a small smile wormed its way onto his face nonetheless.  Draco apparated them into a dim concrete stairwell, and Harry had to blink a few times to let his eyes adjust.  His companion had already started walking away up the steps, so Harry hurried after him.  Since Draco didn’t look back to see if Harry was indeed following, Harry felt no qualms staring at Draco’s back as they ascended.  Draco held himself as elegantly as a pureblood was supposed to, with an air of effortless perfection.  Something about it drew Harry in, like falling into a black hole.
Apprehensively, Draco strode to the front desk, expecting to see Potter’s infuriating smile.
Draco narrowed his eyes, but he didn’t look away, so Harry couldn’t be too disappointed.  “What makes you think that wasn’t the real me?” he asked darkly.  “The one who tortured people, and brought Death Eaters into Hogwarts?”
McGonagall tilted her head curiously. “Yes. Potter, this Unity event was created to celebrate all the houses; the Slytherins may not be known for fighting on the day of the Hogwarts Battle, but they should be celebrated for the battles they did fight.” She paused, as if waiting for Harry to interrupt, but he stayed silent, waiting for her to continue. “Ms. Runcorn had a childhood friend, a halfblood, that was sorted into Hufflepuff. They grew apart at school, as many in different houses do, but when Mr. Runcorn imprisoned her friend’s mother, Edwina felt directly responsible. It was one of the first arrests Runcorn made, since he already knew her muggleborn status. Edwina would visit her father at work and sneak looks at his list of suspected muggleborns, then report these lists to me. It was a risky business. She may have been locked up during the Battle, but she saved many lives.”
“That went well, I think,” Harry said, mainly to see the incredulous look that was forming on Draco’s face in response.
Draco didn’t deign to answer, taking a swig of his butterbeer instead.  He’d ordered it out of nostalgia, thinking it would lift his spirits, but now he just wished it was firewhiskey.  Remembering Blaise’s specially aged firewhiskey, Draco wondered if Ros still had that expired stuff, and if it would be worth the risk of poisoning to drink it.  He was starting to think anything would be better than one more second dwelling on the way Potter’s lips curled upward when he smiled, or determining the exact shade of green that his eyes were.  Emerald, perhaps.
“I was forced to take it,” Malfoy murmured, voice so quiet Harry could barely hear it.  “I didn’t want to.”
of us?”
Harry smiled ruefully.  “Well,” he amended, “I’ve only been looking for about an hour.  Luckily you’re at one of four places I thought to check.”
The Dragon’s Lair always cleared his head.  Draco strode out of the park with purpose, heading to his favorite bookstore.  Maybe Dr. Finch would allow him to curl up on the tiny couch in the corner with a book and some warm cocoa.  That was a plan he could get behind.
Draco groaned, leaning back in his seat and burying his face in his hands.  “Hex him?” he suggested.
“Well, think of someone, will you?” Draco grumped, glaring at the distant dartboard again while he waited for Potter to make a decision.  He briefly wondered if Harry even remembered all their names, but quickly shoved that idea aside.  That would really make Draco hate him, so he’d better wait for proof before overreacting and dumping the rest of his butterbeer over Harry’s head.  Though maybe Draco could get away with doing it just for fun, even if there wasn’t a reason.  The appeal of that thought had nothing to do with the picture it would make, Harry gasping and sopping wet.
Harry’s mouth fell open.
“I think I can find my way from here,” Harry choked out, and he turned and fled up the alley as fast as he could.
A vaguely familiar face appeared at Flint’s elbow, another Slytherin, and she was staring at Harry like she’d never seen him before.  “Potter?” she said, gaping.
“I’ll take this broom and shove it up your arse!” Nott bellowed, and Harry jumped back as Nott brandished his broom, trying to keep a straight face.
“Still discussing Harry, are we?” Lavender ventured, taking Pansy’s hand in her own and twining their fingers together.
Draco stared at Connor in surprise.  He was more observant than Draco had thought.  And he was headed back to America in a few days anyway; what could it hurt to confide in him a little?  “His name is, er, Harry.”
“I’ll be back in a few minutes,” Draco told Dr. Finch apologetically as he approached.  “I have to get rid of this maniac.”
“Oh,” Potter replied, matching his pace.  “Thanks for the heads up.”
“It seems to me,” Connor ventured at last, “that you’re feeling super guilty about something you didn’t really have control over.”
Draco stopped walking and faced Harry, dropping his arm.  Harry missed the warmth of his hand.  “What?” Draco said.
Draco gave him an incredulous look.  “I’ve been at the bookstore every day this week.”
“Sweet?” Draco repeated incredulously.  “Nothing about Potter’s unstable and self-centered behaviors is sweet, Pansy.”  He’d yet to take a drink of his tea, but kept swirling the spoon around in the liquid lazily with a twirl of his finger.  Pansy always prepared it with more sugar than Draco preferred, and he wasn’t keen on tasting it.
They ended up going to a pub a few blocks away that Draco had never been to before.  It was fairly clean, and not many people were there, but enough to have company.  Draco was glad for that; he was worried they would go somewhere close-quartered and intimate.  The only person he wanted to be close to and intimate with was Harry Potter — and that wasn’t about to happen any time soon.  Or ever.
“Thanks,” Harry said, but then there was just silence, as neither of them seemed to have anything to say.  “It’s rather dark here,” Harry tried, gesturing to the many closed shops and dim alleyways.
“So,” Potter said after a brief silence, “can I, er, have a word with you?”
“We can’t use magic,” Malfoy protested.  “We still have the Trace.”
“Malfoy,” Potter said breathlessly, getting in Draco’s face and forcing him to stop.  “I’m sorry, I don’t think it’s your fault.  I swear I don’t.”
Draco sighed.  Pansy hadn’t told him they were coming after all.  The cheat.  “Hello, Blaise,” Draco greeted, already affecting the air of haughtiness that a guest of the Zabinis ought to have.  “Apologies for the intrusion.  Mr. Potter here has something very important to tell you, but I’m sure he’d prefer less of an audience.”
He leaned down and conjured a small white tulip with his wand.  Hermione had told him once that muggles had created a language of flowers.  Different species and colors held different meanings.  Harry had never encountered this in his experiences in the muggle world, although his experiences had been rather limited at the Dursley’s.  She said the meanings were based on potion-making ingredients.  Likely, back when wizards and witches consorted with muggles, the rumor that these flowers carried specific meanings, in connection with their use in certain potions, became widespread belief, especially once the wizarding world began to withdraw into secrecy.  The white tulip, Hermione told him, was a key ingredient in Largioserum, a potion that could dissolve resentment in the drinker and urge them to make peace with their enemies.  It was used as an alternative to torture in medieval wartime, in order to convince prisoners to cooperate.  In the language of flowers, the white tulip represented forgiveness.
Harry met her gentle gaze.  “What’s that got to do with him feeling unwell?”
“There was quite a bit more groveling on Potter’s part,” Parkinson answered airily.
“What genre would you prefer?” Draco asked, turning to lead him to the fiction section of the store.
“Merlin?” Connor asked bemusedly.  “Is that a British thing?”
Why did he have to be in love with a madman?
“Er, yes, I suppose,” Harry admitted. “I just…could use some advice, I guess.”
Draco opened and closed his mouth a few times in astonishment — for one, he was
It seemed to be a positive reaction, so Harry stepped inside and gratefully accepted her offer.
Connor laughed loudly all of a sudden.  “Wait, is this the the guy that interrupted us that first time?  The one who thought I was insulting you?”
Malfoy was glowering at him, but there was something else in that look.  A terror that he couldn’t quite mask.  “Don’t be stupid, Potter,” he scoffed mirthlessly.  “If you don’t run I’ll be killed for nothing.  At least give me an honorable death, will you?”
“No,” Draco said, leaning in closer to those brown eyes.  “Let’s go to your hotel room.”
“He was a kid!” Harry yelled back, and he almost couldn’t believe he was defending Malfoy of all people.
“You already know Greg,” Draco pointed out.
“Great,” Draco went on.  “You owe me.”  The moment those words left Draco’s mouth he regretted them fiercely.  No one owed Draco anything, not after the war.  Especially not the savior of the wizarding world, who had saved him from fiendfyre, and a life in azkaban.  This man, whom Draco had tormented all growing up, owed him nothing.  If anything, Draco should be begging forgiveness at his feet.
should start getting used to calling him Draco,” Hermione countered, earning a tired sigh from Ron.  “At least he’s fit,” she added as an afterthought and Ron choked.
Lavender snorted in response and Pansy beamed at her, leaning over to give her a peck on her cheek, right on one of her scars.  The left side of Lavender’s face and neck were marred with three deep gashes, the longest of which went from the top of her scalp to the edge of her collar bone.  Long since healed, they stood out as shiny pink reminders of a time before, when the Dark Lord and his followers were terrorizing Hogwarts.  Lavender wasn’t ashamed of her scars; she showed them off like medals.  She’d shaved half her head to make them more visible and Draco had to admit that the undercut suited her.  Pansy was head over heels for her little werewolf war hero.  She had even mastered the wolfsbane potion, even though Pansy hated potion-making.
“I told you it was creepy,” Draco reminded him.
“Unbelievable,” Harry muttered, picking at his chips.
It was five days after Harry had parted ways with Draco at Zabini Mansion, and Harry was enjoying lunch with Ron and Hermione at the Leaky Cauldron — enjoying because he was distracted by thoughts of a certain blonde saying, “Alright” and “Yes” with the most dumbfounded expression Harry had ever seen on him — when Pansy Parkinson interrupted them out of nowhere by slamming her hands down on their table.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, hating the way that last name felt in his mouth, but knowing Draco would respond better to it right now.  “I only meant….  I didn’t know very much, about Dumbledore.  I… only wish he’d told me more about himself.  I felt like I knew him, but I know I didn’t.  I don’t like… finding out things about him that don’t line up with what I knew.  It’s just, a sore spot for me, I guess.  I didn’t mean to take it out on you.”  Harry swallowed, realizing he’d looked down at his feet during his confession, and quickly darted his eyes back up to make sure Draco hadn’t left.
one!”
“I trust you know your own way,” Draco farewelled, but he didn’t turn to go.
“If you keep scowling, I’m going to have to kick you out,” Madam Rosmerta said casually, ambling over to where Draco sat at the bar.  “You’re scaring my customers.”
advanced muggles are, and how they
“What?  Why?”  Potter gawked at him, looking just as uneducated and uncivilized as he really was.
Harry grinned at him.  “It sure is, Draco.”
Harry found what he was looking for at the end of the last row, hidden in the corner.  It was cleared of the weeds that were encroaching on most of the other headstones, and a small bouquet of yellow flowers rested before it.  Daffodils, if Harry recalled correctly.  They looked fresh, but Harry wasn’t sure if that was via spellwork or if they’d been put there recently.  The epitaph above them was short; there wasn’t even a date.  It read simply:
Draco was quiet for a moment, then countered, “Is it working?”
Hermione very visibly elbowed Ron, and he immediately sat up straighter and addressed Harry with an air of caution.  “Harry, mate, no matter what, we support you,” he started, glancing at Hermione who nodded encouragingly.  “And, er, it doesn’t matter to us who you…prefer.  We’ll always be here for you.”  His face screwed up into a somewhat pained smile.
?” he blurted, feeling completely betrayed.  “You’re on
“With… your drink?” Harry asked, hoping he hadn’t missed anything too important.
“Pardon me, ma’am,” Draco said, and the old woman looked up at him with a wan smile.  “Do you mind me asking why this bookstore is called The Dragon’s Lair?”
ed you.  How are you friends now?”
Harry paled, something suddenly clicking into place in his mind. “Runcorn. I…I impersonated him…to infiltrate the ministry.”
He hadn’t known how to find Draco from there, so he’d ended up wandering around the area until he passed by the park he and Draco had visited, and the church that stood next to it had reminded him of a place he’d only heard of.
“So I’m brilliant, huh?” Parkinson asked as she sat down opposite him, on the couch.
,” Harry said, “the most.”
“Oh, I did,” Dr. Finch assured him, blinking back into the present.  “Surprised her in Florida.  We lived together for two years.  The happiest years of my life.”  Dr. Finch’s face suddenly darkened, like the lights had all dimmed at once.  “But she was killed.”
“Thanks,” he told her, but she was already sinking into the couch, Parkinson settling in beside her.
“Potter was praising my abilities in charms,” Parkinson went on, a twinkle in her eye as she flashed a smile at Harry.  He returned it warily.
“Have you given up yet?” Draco asked now, crossing his arms as they stood outside Bulstrode’s workplace in a seedy part of East London.
“Harry here was just asking where he could find you,” Dr. Finch said, either not noticing that Draco was upset with her or not caring.  Knowing Dr. Finch, it was probably the latter.
“And – and it isn’t about
Harry seemed instantly taken with her, and immediately did as she asked, stepping inside.  Daphne’s eyes trailed after him for a moment too long, and Draco clenched his teeth as he too entered.  There was nothing to get worked up over, Daphne was just up to her usual tricks.
“Well, he’s not,” Harry felt the need to defend — Ron was his best mate after all.
It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes.  “Yes, though I believe it’s called magizoology in the wizarding world.”
Harry wasn’t entirely sure why he was so unnerved by this development, but he didn’t bother to think about it too hard.  He had more important things to worry about, such as Draco and his apparent decline in health.  Or happiness, perhaps.  Either way, Harry had to fix it.  “I have to get going,” Harry told his friends, standing hastily as he gathered his coat.  “Work,” he added in way of explanation, and his friends nodded understandingly as he went.
The other boy hesitated, like he was debating between shutting down or acquiescing.
He greeted Dr. Finch briefly as he entered the store, and went immediately to the back left corner to sort through books.  Dr. Finch had wanted to re-organize them to reflect subsections of content, so not only were all philosophy books together, but asian philosophy books were together, and books that dealt with philosophy of religion or spirituality went together, and so on.  Lastly, within these groups they had to be sorted alphabetically.  So far, Draco had organized about half the store.  He wasn’t in a hurry though, and neither was Dr. Finch.  He enjoyed the task of looking through the books, and wasn’t keen on running out of things to do in the bookstore.
Maybe he shouldn’t have teased Malfoy so much.  The smiling had gotten on Malfoy’s nerves and that must’ve gotten them off to a poor start.  Merlin, what an idiot he’d been.  No wonder Malfoy had been upset with him.  Next time, Harry would be somber, and take everything Malfoy said very seriously.  That way Malfoy wouldn’t feel like Harry was making fun of him.  He just had to wait until Malfoy cooled off.  That exchange had been eight days ago.  Was it too soon to confront him again?  He looked well, every time Harry spotted him striding down the street like he owned it, and chatting with Dr. Finch over tea.  Sometimes hot chocolate when it was a particularly miserable day out.
Harry was shouting before he knew what he was going to say.  “Because I nearly killed him!”
“As am I,” Draco replied.  It was true: talking with Connor had definitely cleared things up in his mind.  “Have a good flight.”
McGonagall scrutinised him for a moment as Harry held his breath. “Potter,” she said finally, “are you familiar with Edwina Runcorn?”
!”  The way Flint said it, Harry wasn’t sure if he was teasing him in a friendly way, or actually mocking him.  To be safe, Harry smiled tentatively.
“You don’t look like you mind,” Harry returned casually, tugging slightly on Draco’s hand.
“Well I
“How much?” Potter apparently felt the need to ask, despite having no money on him.
Harry cleared his throat awkwardly.  “Er, I want to apologize to you – ”
Draco snorted, unamused.  “Those are the places that isolate witches and wizards from the muggle community entirely.
Just to be an arse, Harry beamed at Draco as he grabbed a fistful of Floo powder from a pot above the fireplace and stepped in.  “Zabini Mansion,” he declared as he threw down the powder, and the last thing he saw of Parkinson’s flat was Draco’s answering glare.  Somehow, Harry had come to prefer that glare to any smile.
“I lied,” Potter admitted in an undertone, so that Dr. Finch couldn’t hear.  “I don’t need a book.”
, like stripes of fire licking through his veins.
Anything except the fact that he’d been apparating into muggle London for the last week trying to catch a glimpse of blonde hair through a bookshop window while hiding under his invisibility cloak.
“You’re up to something, Potter,” Draco muttered at last, looking far from pleased.  The irony of this statement wasn’t lost on Harry; it was what Harry had been saying about Malfoy all through school.
is how the belief of superiority emerges.  By distancing oneself from the other.”
“I’m afraid,” Blaise said, rising from his seat with the effortlessness and fluidity of mist, “I must get back to my guests.  You may stay as long as you wish.  Draco,” Blaise added, turning to him with a fond smile that Draco knew was rehearsed, “I trust you remember the way out.”
“Watch it!” Draco snapped, stepping back, but he froze when he saw who was blocking his way.
“Nothing, mate,” Ron sighed.  “I just think you should owl him is all.”
“Yeah,” Draco said, hating how weak he sounded.  “Yes,” he said again, trying to regain some level of dignity, “but not tonight.  And not tomorrow.  Give me a break.  I do have a job, you know.”
“Get the fuck out,” the other man growled, sparing a furious glance Harry’s way.
“Draco has apologized a multitude of times to me and explained his situation,” Rosmerta instantly dismissed.  “And he’s awfully polite, unlike most boys his age.”
Harry stared at them, perplexed.  “What are you on about?”
Draco spun around as soon as Harry touched him, effectively breaking their contact.  “Do not touch me, Harry Potter,” he hissed so menacingly that Harry stumbled a step back.  Draco’s nostrils were flared, and he was glaring so hard Harry thought flames might burst from his eyes.
Harry looked at Dumbledore’s frame again, wondering if there was a spell to summon the subject back to their portrait. A pointed cough startled him and he glanced around to find the source of the noise.
“Fine,” Draco said in annoyance, “I’ll get you a map.  Do you have any money on you?”
“We were all kids!” Ron retorted angrily, standing now.  Hermione also stood, trying to keep some distance between them, but she was biting her lip in worry, not knowing how to deescalate the situation.  “That doesn’t excuse what he called Hermione!  Or how he treated my family!  His dad nearly killed my sister!”
Potter shrugged like he couldn’t help himself.  “Stupid Potter,” he repeated pointedly.
to understand muggles, even if it was misguided,” Harry countered, frowning, “whereas most Slytherins just outright hated them.”
Draco’s tongue flicked out, just for a second, and wet his bottom lip.  His eyes were still closed.  Draco swallowed, and Harry’s eyes followed the motion all the way down his throat before jumping back up to his lips.  Without really thinking about it, Harry took a small step forward, so that Draco was only about a foot away.  Draco looked so vulnerable, leaned up against the brick wall of the alley, and Harry wanted nothing more than to keep him safe, to wrap him up in his arms, and to brush his hair from his face and to —
It would have been weird to have a laugh with his once-nemesis, so Draco just sniffed haughtily.  “It’s a nickname, not a saying.”
Harry Potter.  “You didn’t call me,” the man said in way of greeting, and Draco’s disappointment gave way to embarrassment.
As they continued gasping for breath, Harry felt a cold sense of dread wash over him; it didn’t take a genius to know these two were mocking Harry for all they were worth.  There was something especially humiliating about being the one who had attempted peace.  None of the other Slytherins had received him this poorly — Harry wasn’t prepared for it.  Anger, he could handle.  Caution, too.  But for them to have not changed at all….  Why did he feel so stupid all of a sudden?
Hermione sighed.  “And Charlie is wonderful, but he spends all his time with dragons.  I don’t think Harry’s particularly fond of those since fourth year.  Even the Gringrotts one made him jumpy.”
Harry balked.  “What?” he said, quite a bit louder than necessary.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter’s face crack into a smile again.
“It’s Harry fucking Potter,” Flint crowed, holding onto the doorframe for support, “he’s come to
There was a tug on Harry’s arm, and he let Draco pull him back a couple paces.  “We’re sorry to bother you at work, Mill,” Draco intervened smoothly, starting to lead Harry away.  “It was good seeing you.”
“So…” Potter ventured in clear bewilderment, “You just forgave him?  Just like that?  You’re not mad?”
“What did you discuss?” Draco wondered mildly, but the tension lacing his words belied his interest.
Pansy closed her eyes and leaned into Lavender’s touch.  Would Potter look like that if Draco stroked his hair, thick eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks, and a soft smile gracing his lips?
“Much like you then,” Draco said, perfectly aware that his flattery would gain him no favors.
“Are you leaving then?” he spat out, fury and terror warring across his features as he stepped back and out of the way.
Bulstrode’s eyes were so narrowed, Harry could hardly see them at all.  If she glared any harder, Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if they disappeared into her head.
“This apology campaign is going well for you, Potter,” Draco remarked as they strode back up the lane and out through the gate, aiming to sound bored.
“And you’ve barely touched your food,” Ron added, far more concerned with Harry’s appetite.  Ron’s fingers twitched toward his fork, and it took an obvious effort to hold himself back.
Draco whirled around to face him, and Harry must have missed something because Draco was seething.  “You don’t get to pass judgement on me just because I’m not perfect like you!” he hissed, menacingly quiet in echoey street.  “Not everyone gets to be the hero, Harry, we don’t all get to grow up with the world cheering us on!  Do you really think I had a choice?”  His voice broke a little on the last word, and it ached in Harry’s heart.  “You never had to choose, anyway,” Draco went on, suddenly worn out, slumping against the closest wall.  “You never had to choose between your family and doing the right thing.”
time together,” Connor said earnestly as he squeezed Draco’s arm.
Malfoy glared at him.  “I can’t come with you, idiot,” he hissed angrily.  “They’ll find us.”
Harry shook his head, becoming more concerned by the second.  “Is he ill?” he demanded, leaning towards Parkinson as if that would provide him the answer.  “Is he taking care of himself?  Is he eating?”
“Potter, we have to leave,” Malfoy was saying, his tone and posture screaming of fear.
“Please,” Harry implored, “Draco, I want to
Harry didn’t have time for her dramatic monologues today.  “Then you should know to run and not look back.”
“Oh, don’t tease him, Lav,” Pansy chided, looking up at her girlfriend.  Thank Merlin Pansy was there to save him.  Draco could kiss her for her mercy.  “He hasn’t figured it out yet,” she whispered loudly.
“But mum – ” Dudley began to whine, but Petunia cut him off uncharacteristically.
He shut the door of Pansy’s flat firmly behind him.  It was improper to disapparate from someone’s doorstep, so Draco made his way to the stairwell before apparating to an alleyway near The Dragon’s Lair.
Potter bit his lip, not that Draco really noticed.  “I’d really like your help,” he tried again.
dating, and what if they were
personal.
Inside, Dr. Finch sat behind her desk as usual, eyeglasses on as she surveyed an old Greek text.  Dr. Finch was a linguist, and she was fluent in eight different spoken languages, as well as several dead languages, including Greek.  She looked up as they came in.  “Draco,” she said warmly, “you’ve brought a friend.”
The air was chilling in Hogsmeade, having less shelter than the London streets they’d come from, and Harry longed to be indoors by a fireside, perhaps with a cup of hot tea and a temperamental blonde beside him.  “I would like to apologize to Pansy, if you would kindly escort me to her door,” Harry told Draco earnestly, watching as the other man’s brow furrowed even more, and his crossed arms tightened.
feels – but I – I think – I might, er, like him quite a lot actually.
Parkinson’s mouth twitched, like she was fighting off an expression.  “What a speech,” she commented dryly, and she stepped aside so he could enter.  “Tea, Potter?”
They both stood still for a moment longer before turning back to their table and sitting down again.  It was quiet as they settled in.  They both sipped uneasily at their drinks.
A silence stretched between them.  It felt like the walls of the Mansion were sucking up all sound.  Draco felt like a Zabini portrait, unable or unwilling to speak, he wasn’t sure which.  For the second time, Harry’s words brought him back to that day years ago when he’d been crying in a Hogwarts bathroom, mind filling with images of his mother being tortured and murdered by the Dark Lord, and then a face in the mirror, familiar and unfriendly, and before Draco knew it, he was on the ground, pain like he’d never felt slicing through him, blood mixing with the flooding water.  He hadn’t been able to speak then either.  Not even to scream.
It was a pleasantly surprising turn of events.  At most he had expected Goyle to shrug him off.  Harry started to smile in response, and Goyle rushed to add, “I’m not though,” as if this was a point of pride for him, and for a moment Goyle reminded Harry of Ron.
now.  As much as Draco might pretend that would be a relief, the thought of Harry leaving his life now was making him feel queasy.
Harry glanced back at Draco, who graced Harry with a roll of his eyes.  Well, he
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, “so?”
Now Draco knew he was being made fun of.  Sighing dramatically, Draco turned and stalked down the street, with Potter following on his heels.  He didn’t slow until they got to the park he had just been in, even though he kept wanting to check that Potter was still there and that he hadn’t gotten discouraged and stayed behind at the shops.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Worse than Professor Snape,” Draco drawled, leaning against the opposite bookshelf.
“For Merlin’s sake, Potter,” Draco grumbled, shoving away from the offending man.  “Never mind.  I don’t want to know.”  With that, he turned and strode away, back towards the shop.
“An old friend,” Draco told her wryly, kissing her cheek as he reached her.  “You won’t believe this one, Ros, stick around for the show.”
“I knew you wouldn’t understand,” Harry sighed, resting his chin in his hands.  “But he’s
?” he repeated dumbly.
There was an awkward moment where Hermione flushed, looking between them all, and stuttered, “I – well – ” but before she could finish, Pansy continued, “But I’m friends with Draco, so I guess that makes two of us,” and Ron snorted into his food.  Pansy half smiled, half sneered at him, looking as if she’d only just registered his presence, and Ron smiled back, looking more bewildered than ever.  Even Hermione had an approving sort of smirk on her face.
“Harry?” she asked, grinning unrestrainedly.  She jogged over and swept Harry up in a hug, which he returned.  “Why are you here?” she asked amiably.  “Draco isn’t around.”
“And Duddy-kins, you’re coming too,” Petunia added brusquely.
“Don’t mention it,” Harry replied weakly, and she finally broke her uncaring façade to give him a wry grin.
He could still feel where Harry had grabbed his hand.  And how he almost hadn’t let go.
That only seemed to infuriate him more.  His clenched fists were shaking.  “Stop with your insignificant apologies.  They mean nothing.”  Each word was infused with venom.
fault, Malfoy,” Potter affirmed, encouraged by Draco’s response.  “And I’m more sorry than I can say.”
The earnest question made Draco cold all over.  He never liked to dwell on his past, and that was one of his worst memories, partly because it had been his first real act of evil.  That stunt had nearly caused the death of a Gryffindor girl and the wrath of the Dark Lord.  Of course Potter would conveniently bring that up.
“You better not cause any trouble, Mr. Potter,” she told him coolly, and Draco started to wonder if she and Potter had a history of some sort.  “I don’t want anyone upsetting my patrons.”
Potter was grinning like he won the lottery, and Draco froze as he remembered exactly what Potter was referring to.  The timid boy he was bragging to while he was being fitted for his first set of Hogwarts robes.  He’d been thrilled because father had let him go alone for once, and he felt so mature and confident.  Harry Potter was the first boy his age he’d run into on that excursion before he’d met up with Blaise and Pansy, and he was so eager to impress him.  He hadn’t even known who he was until later.  Looking back, it was obvious that Draco had behaved like a spoiled brat, but at the time, he’d thought that was how to make friends.  And yet Harry Potter had rejected him.  It was a surprise to find that the sting of that rejection was just as painful now as it had been then.
Draco blinked owlishly at him; his eyes were mesmerizing.  “Quidditch,” he repeated flatly.
Lavender smirked and snagged Parkinson’s waist in her arms.  “This one’s my girlfriend,” she told him proudly, as Parkinson squirmed away.
Draco couldn’t listen to anymore of this, so he loudly stomped over to them.  Rosmerta was unflappable as usual but Harry started guiltily, and tried to pretend they had been discussing various weather patterns.  “Greg will be out in a moment,” Draco informed him curtly.
“Draco,” Blaise said, ambling over to them in a sleek black and green suit, looking pleasantly surprised by their abrupt arrival.  “What brings you here?”  He turned his idle gaze on Potter, who was currently trying to straighten his shirt like he suddenly realized he was underdressed.  “And with baggage?” Blaise added, nonplussed.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
“You don’t have to worry,” Harry assured them quickly.  “I’m fine.”
Out on the street, Potter stood waiting.  “Where should we go this time?” he asked, ignoring Draco’s glare.  “It’s a nice day out.  Fancy a stroll in the park?”
“Dray, what a treat!” she hollered, in case anyone missed his entrance.  “What brings you here today, darling?”
Draco couldn’t help the sharp intake of breath.
“What?” Harry asked stupidly, grin faltering but not vanishing entirely.
Dr. Finch didn’t respond immediately.  Her mouth was creased in a grim frown, her eyes shuttered of emotion.  When she finally did speak, it wasn’t in answer to his question.  “Go, Draco.  Live your life.  And love the people you’re allowed to love now.”
– have been sort of – not
“Well, it’ll take even less time if they just find both of us standing here,” Harry countered, making a show a plopping down on the bottom step of the stairs.
Potter blushed for sure this time.  “I, er, don’t have my wand with me.”
Harry felt like he could sing from the rooftops.  He’d spent hours talking with Draco last night – talking, not just yelling – and it had been wonderful.  Awkward and painfully misunderstood at times, but overall, wonderful.
After a moment of searching, Draco pulled out
“Well,” Draco answered in a strange voice — it was a mix between bitterness and amazement, if that was possible — “not every Voldemort supporter was defended by the savior of the wizarding world at their trial.”
Pansy shrugged delicately.  “Couldn’t hurt.”
“There is a
“But you said,” Draco began numbly, but Potter cut him off.
and he walked straight into someone.
Blaise set his glass down, and made a show of leaning forward in interest as he waited for Potter to get on with it.  Underneath all the courteous manners, Blaise really wasn’t a patient man.
“Go on, Draco,” Dr. Finch told him with a surreptitious wink, voice pitched low enough that Connor wouldn’t hear.  “I won’t tell the other one.”
This whole conversation was making Draco feel awkward and unbalanced.  And it didn’t help that images of Potter kept popping into his head, and that he kept worrying Potter might stop by while he was out.  Would he wait around for Draco, or would he give up and leave?  Did Draco even want to see him?
Draco raised his eyebrows at Harry like he was missing the most obvious fact in the world.  “Potter, Dumbledore
“Professor Dumbledore!” Harry exclaimed, wishing he could embrace the older man.
“Draco?” Dr. Finch called out moments later, a sing-song quality to her voice that meant it wasn’t just anyone at the door.  Draco’s heart leapt to his throat.  “I think this young man would like a word with you.”
Suddenly, Harry had a brilliant idea. They could go for lunch together! Surely he wouldn’t have other plans…and after last night’s success, he couldn’t reject him…. Right?
“Really, Hermione,” Harry said, leaning forward and placing his hand on hers.  She looked up and met his gaze, her warm brown eyes filled with concern.  “I’m okay.”
“Oh,” Harry said.  “Well, nothing, I’m just smiling.”
Harry frowned. “Well I already asked Draco and he was adamant…”
“So I apologized again,” Harry went on cautiously, “but he keeps getting pissed that I’m apologizing at all.”
Harry’s face fell, and Draco’s heart lurched seeing such a heartbroken expression on his face.  “Why not?” Harry asked plaintively, reminding Draco strongly of a wet kitten.  It was a testament to Draco’s strength of will that he didn’t reach over and pull the other man into a hug right then.
Despite the clench of dread in his chest, Harry shook his head ardently.  “That’s ridiculous,” he ground out.
Not that Draco ever wanted Potter to follow him.  Certainly not the last time they met and Draco had stormed off only to realize Potter hadn’t tried to chase after him and apologize again.  That was preposterous.  Draco had more self-respect than that.
“It’s good of you to drop by,” she continued merrily to Potter, ignoring Draco’s glare.  “He has so few friends.”
(See the end of the chapter for
,” she clarified, “obviously.”
tell her what he really thought about Potter, because maybe then he wouldn’t keep thinking about the prat.
“We’ll be on our way,” Draco ground out, turning on his heel without so much as a goodbye.  He didn’t even glance Potter’s way, not wanting to see how he’d reacted to Greg’s suggestion, but he heard the other’s footsteps follow him out into the cool air.  Draco was suddenly quite grateful for the chilly breeze, as the pub had been far too warm for his comfort.  Not to mention the sudden barrage of images assaulting his mind: Potter leading him up to one of the Three Broomstick’s rooms, Potter tugging on the front of his shirt to drag him close, Potter’s sinfully wet lips attacking his own….
Harry clenched his teeth, wondering how the night had turned out so poorly.  It
He didn’t look at Harry as he strode past him out of the room.  He didn’t look at the many silent portraits lining the hall as they fidgeted in their frames.  He didn’t return their melancholy stares.
Dr. Finch winked charmingly.  “Not that kind of doctor.”  She released his hand.  “And you are?”
“And you?” Harry asked, getting back on track.  “Why are you here?”
Greg gave Draco one of his big sloppy grins that reminded Draco of a Labrador Retriever, and launched himself over to crush Draco in one of his signature hugs.  They hadn’t ever hugged in their school days, but once the war had ended, Greg had gotten particularly fond of touch.  Draco wasn’t complaining; Greg’s hugs were the most comforting he’d ever experienced — not that he had much to compare to.  “It’s not a bother,” Greg said in his gruff voice.
it was because Harry was trying to be gracious.
Potter looked down at his shoes for a moment, and then, as if that gave him courage, he returned Draco’s stare and said, “If there’s anything I remember of Gregory from school, it’s that he was always at your side, for better or for worse.  You don’t stick by someone like that if you don’t feel like they want you there.  He knows you valued him.”
Hermione sighed and crossed her arms, giving Ron a significant look.  Taking that as his cue to take over the interrogation, Ron asked, “Mate, what’s really going on with you?  You’ve been acting weird for the last couple weeks.”
Greg visibly stiffened, panic setting into his face — although to be fair to Greg, every emotion he felt was visible in every line of his body.
Harry hated lying to his friends.  But they just wouldn’t understand what he was doing.  They’d taken it badly the first time he’d brought up apologizing to Malfoy, and he doubted they’d take it much better this time after learning how pathetic his attempts were becoming.
Aunt Petunia dropped the spatula she was holding and held her hand to her heart as it clattered to the floor.  “
“Unbelievable,” Ron said, but there was mirth in his voice.
“What?” a woman’s voice demanded grumpily from somewhere within the house.
Dr. Finch gave him a sly smile.  “You’ve never asked, dear, but yes, I am.”  She waggled her eyebrows at him suggestively.
Parkinson simply waited for him to continue, and Harry panicked once more.  What else had he seen Parkinson excel at?  “You’re a loyal friend,” he blurted, thinking this must be applicable to any Hogwarts students during the time they were at school.  A war does that to you, makes you stick by your friends more than anything.
Draco dropped his hand.  “Really, Pansy?” he asked, voice edging on whiny.
“He isn’t rude,” Potter said stupidly, and Draco turned to see him frowning at Connor.
“With Draco?” Parkinson asked incredulously.  “Of course not.  Lavender?” she called, and Harry startled as Lavender Brown strolled into the room.
Harry grinned at him, just to see a sneer in response.  “How about Parkinson’s?”
It had been five days since Potter’s botched attempt at an apology, and Draco’s bad mood still hadn’t gone away.  Not that he’d been counting.  The sky was unobscured by clouds for once, and the sun hung lazily in the middle of it, warming the air.  Children were playing tag around the legs of their mothers, and the mothers were chatting amongst themselves contentedly and bribing their kids with ice cream.  Dog-walkers came in hoards.
Draco nodded curtly in response, and strode past the other man without a second glance.  He knew Harry was following at a distance, since they were both leaving the Mansion, but Draco was grateful for the space.  It wasn’t until he’d reached the front door and apparated onto his own doorstep that he realized his hands were clenched into fists, his fingernails digging crescent-shaped dents into his palms.
“I’m not going to stalk Goyle!” Potter cried, as if the concept were ludicrous.
Malfoy was shaking his head before Harry could finish.  “He has people in the Ministry.”
Greg made a constipated face.  “Are you sure?”
Harry stepped towards him, hands half raised like he was going in for a hug.  He dropped his arms when Draco snapped back into the present, flinching violently.  He kept his feet planted though, this time.  He wouldn’t run away.
Potter met his eyes and hastily said, “No, no, there’s more.”
“I’m good,” Connor replied casually, his American accent out of place in the quaint English bookshop.  “I’d be better with a guide.”
“Not very well,” Potter said helplessly.
Glancing awkwardly at his two lunch companions, Harry asked her meekly, “What do you mean?”
“Then
Daphne pouted her lips at him.  “But Draco,” she protested, somehow dignified and petulant at the same time, “my sister has been waiting for you to stop by.  She’s quite taken with you.”
“I’m alright,” Draco replied, attempting to smooth out his expression.  From the concerned look on Connor’s face, it wasn’t working.  “I just….”
“Just hear what I have to say,” Harry replied, trying to sound as reassuring as possible.
“Do you mind if I fetch Greg from wherever he’s working?” Draco cut in, hoping to warn his friend before the inevitable Potter onslaught.
“How wonderful,” Draco bit out, tempted to slam his book about shamans down on Dr. Finch’s desk.  As it was, he just set it down gently.  Even as furious as he felt, Draco was loathe to harm a book.  Dr. Finch shot him a look over her reading glasses as if he had.
“Draco,” Pansy called, stalling Lavender with a hand on her shoulder.  “Just so you know, I wouldn’t mind if you changed how you felt about Potter.  He’s not that bad.”
“Why didn’t you follow her?” Draco asked hesitantly, not wanting to disrupt her fond memories.
The man smiling at him when Draco reached the counter was definitively
Draco gave Harry a stern look.  “You are rather prone to stalking,” he intoned, but Potter just rolled his eyes.
“Are you okay?  You look freaked out,” came a voice from behind him, and Draco jumped, cursing himself that he’d forgotten Connor’s existence for a second time that day.
Those couldn’t be the last words Draco Malfoy ever said to him.  They kept ringing in Harry’s ears, a chorus of “you failed” repeating over and over.  What had he done wrong?  Harry had been careful to make it more personal this time, more obviously about Malfoy and not about him.  And maybe he’d screwed that up a bit, with bringing up things Malfoy didn’t want to think about, but then he’d apologized again and even made Malfoy laugh.  For a while, it was almost like talking with a friend.  Until Malfoy flat-out refused to accept Harry’s apology.  Harry had to try again.
Draco’s breath stopped.  Harry was asking him out for drinks.  No, he couldn’t be.  Draco reread the sentence again.  And again.  And —
“How…?” Harry muttered in bewilderment, looking back at the gate about a mile away.
Harry couldn’t let Malfoy die for him.  It wasn’t right.  They were enemies, they were supposed to fight each other not die for each other.  It was ridiculous, nonsensical.
It took Harry a few moments to process her threat, and by then Harry was spluttering worse than before.  “I’m not – there’s no reason – he’s not even – why do you – no!”
Harry stared at her, mouth hanging open.  “Oh Hermione, you’re brilliant!” he cried, leaping up from his seat and leaning across the table to give her a sort of half-hug.
Rosmerta gave him a stern look, completely ignoring his famous companion, which made Draco even more fond of her.  “You’re not going to cause a scene in my pub, are you, Draco?”
“Yes,” the blonde growled, and Potter seemed to finally realize how offensive he was being, because he quickly amended, “Well, that’s…good.  Great, I mean.  Great for you.”
Lavender opened her mouth to respond, but Pansy elbowed her lightly in the side.  “Nothing, dear,” she told him with a twinkle in her eye.  “Now what’s your plan if Potter comes back to plague you with apologies?”
.  People don’t go around pestering old schoolmates they hated after years of silence — but
true.”
He grabbed the Nimbus 2000, marveling at the smooth feel of it in his hand, and jogged out into the rain, Draco following behind.  He stopped once they reached the street and mounted the broom, hoping the storm would mask them from his muggle neighbors, and waited until Draco stopped beside him.
“It’s
Harry forced himself not to keep talking, even as the dragging silence strained his patience.  He kept meeting Malfoy’s dark gaze then glancing away, as if he might find an answer written there but was too embarrassed to look for long.  A thousand ideas bubbled to the front of his mind about what to say, but Harry clamped his mouth shut, determined to let Malfoy have the next word.  The blonde before him could be a statue but for the light breeze shifting the pale strands of his hair.  Harry was biting his tongue, dying to ask what the other boy was thinking, when Malfoy suddenly raised an eyebrow, and just like that he was a living person again, chest rising and falling with each breath, posture shifting as he put his weight on one leg then the other.
“What is it?” Harry yelled, starting to rise grudgingly from his seat.  He could hear his uncle’s furious huff from here.
Harry choked.  Ron had the grace to lean over and pat his back until Harry could regain his breath, but Hermione sat back with a stern expression as Harry spluttered for a response.  “What?  Why would you – who said anything about – I never even — ”
Draco rolled his eyes, but didn’t seem too bothered by the jab.  “Did you ever take Muggle Studies, Potter?”
Hermione set down her drink.  “I thought you were planning on apologizing to
“You’re mad,” the blonde replied, and Harry didn’t miss the way his eyes followed one of the droplets of ale down Harry’s chin before waving his wand to dry Harry off.
“Do you have your broom?” Malfoy asked, cutting him off.
“You can’t be!” Harry blurted, then winced at how idiotic that sounded.  “I, er, I mean, why?  There’s so much to talk about.”
Lavender laughed like her girlfriend had told a hilarious joke.  “You’d better be off, Harry,” she said merrily.  “Pans doesn’t take well to guests who outstay their welcome.”
Eyes wide in horror, Draco turned his gaze from the bemused Rosmerta to Harry Potter, who was wearing a dark grey coat that was too warm for the pub, as if he’d just come in from outside.  Harry’s face didn’t betray any emotion, but his tone was lighthearted as he continued, “There are loads of animals smarter than me.  I bet those Blast-Ended Skrewts could get higher results on their O.W.L.s than I did.”
, and – why would you even go there — ”
Harry shot him a abashed smile to indicate his extreme remorse.  Draco was amazed at the indecency of it all.
“Was that a strong possibility?” Potter demanded, looking scandalized.
Trying to shake himself from his thoughts, Draco sighed theatrically.  “Believe me, he is.  But also he’s just a complete idiot.”
Harry blanched.  “
myself from the wizarding community — and expect me to welcome you with open arms after your neat little apology that, in your own words, had nothing to do with
The day had been stifling, even with how gloomy and cloudy it was outside.  No breeze had found its way through Privet Drive, no matter how much Harry’d wished for one.  But with nightfall came a torrent of rainwater and stormy weather, and even the miserable wailing of the wind couldn’t shake Harry’s relief at the heat’s respite.  He laid on his back on his small bed, trying to make time go faster by reciting spells in his head.
The internal battle raging inside Ron finally came to an end.  His hand was around his fork before he even said, “See, he’s fine” to Hermione, and shoveling another bite of pie into his mouth.
“Bye, Blaise Zabini,” Harry mumbled, still sitting, and Blaise smiled indulgently at him before slipping silently from the room.
“Harry,” Dumbledore greeted gently, “it’s good to see you.”
“Me?” Harry said in confusion. What could he do against the press?  They never listened to him.
“Potter,” the boy said, soaked to the bone from the storm, his silvery blonde hair plastered to his forehead unevenly.
to do,” Connor revised, “is take you back to my hotel room for the night.  But I assume you don’t want to do more than make out, so I’m good with that too.”
“Hi,” said a man who was most definitely not Potter.  “I’m Connor.”
to see him,” Harry spluttered with urgency, “to
Potter held up his hands in mock defense.  “I promise.”
Feeling emblazoned by those words, Harry continued, “Actually, not for that.  I wanted to apologize for how I treated you at school.”
Immediately, Harry felt his muscles tense and his blood boil.  “Yes, I do,” he growled, and both his friends flinched at the steel in his voice.
“Alright,” Draco repeated, neither of them moving.
“Not a friend,” Draco grumbled, but introduced them anyway.  “Potter, this is Dr. Finch, the owner of this wonderful bookstore and the smartest person I’ve ever met.  Dr. Finch, this is Harry Potter, a massive git who likes to wear baggy dresses.”
McGonagall nodded and Filch turned to lead the way. As she started toward the door, McGonagall paused to say, “Can I rely on you to do the right thing, Potter?”

“Boy!” Uncle Vernon hollered from downstairs, and Harry groaned.
If he just —
,” Potter said vehemently, as if he cared.  “That is
“Are you giving up already, Potter?” Draco challenged.  “We’ve only just begun.”
Draco rolled his eyes.  “No — well, yes — well….”  He hesitated, glancing over at the earnest expression on Connor’s face.  It wasn’t like Connor could tell anyone.  With a sigh, Draco went on, “I was in a type of… gang, a few years ago.  Got in with the wrong sort.  I was… terrible, I did terrible things.  But Harry, he saved me, from them, from myself.  He… got the leader arrested, and most of the others too.  They’re locked away for good, and I’m free to live my life.”  The words tasted bitter in his mouth.  “But, I never made up for what I did, I never sought forgiveness, I never tried to redeem myself.  I never apologized to the people I hurt.  Not even him.”  Draco shook his head, feeling stupid for saying this all out loud.  “And now he’s made it his mission to apologize to me and all my friends, when he wasn’t even the one who….”  Draco trailed off, because he couldn’t very well explain how he’d held a wand to Dumbledore’s throat and nearly spoke those unforgivable words.   “So even if he did feel something for me,” Draco continued, defeated, “how could I have someone so good when I’m this sullied?”
.  It was
Draco followed him out though it was tempting to just lock the door after him.  He did throw a withering look back at Dr. Finch, who was unperturbed by his ire.
A soft chuckle drew him back to the present. Albus Dumbledore was looking at him, his blue eyes twinkling. “Harsh but effective as always, Severus,” he said lightly.
Harry met Draco’s slightly startled gaze, feeling rather pleased with his response.  After a quiet moment, Draco prompted lazily, “Yes, go on.”
