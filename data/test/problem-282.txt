It was surreal. It was overwhelming. This was Sirius, her godfather. But as a teenager. No older than fifteen. And Lupin. And Wormtail. And… her
"What's wrong with you two?" He asked with a frown. Hermione could only shake her head, while Haley hid her grin behind her hand.
"Give up?" He repeated her words, staring at her, as if she was a mildly irritating bug. "Don't you think I've tried anything I could to reverse it?" He shook his head. "Inside this whole library I found nothing. Nothing in the manor either. It's a spell some dark magician made up when he was at school, of course not bothering to come up with a countercurse!"
He traced the line of her dark brows with one of his fingers. But he was still no closer to the root of her secret.
Sending out a huge bowl of cinnamon and pumpkin ice cream to all of you! I'm sorry for dumping all this angst on you... but hey, it can't get that much worse, right? I know y'all are probably super curious about Draco's perspective here and cursing me for not giving you a glimpse into his mind... I kind of thought it might be cool to leave you in the dark along with Haley. Lalala, sorry for being sadistc like that... Keep safe everyone! And tell me what you think!
fairies that are glowing in all imaginable colours. Floating in between are fireflies and somewhere close by I hear crickets chirping. It's beautiful. And oddly romantic. But I would never admit that out loud.
"How does it feel… not being the chosen one for once, Potter?" Draco Malfoy asked cruelly, looking straight into Haley's eyes. It was clear he was talking about the fact that she hadn't been chosen as a prefect.
He hooted softly, pressing his head against Draco's hand. He wanted treats. But Draco didn't have any here.
"And how do I do that?" He's not even rolling his eyes but the tone of his voice makes me think he's doing it mentally.
Slowly, while observing the girl's sleeping face, she leaned over the bedside table and pulled open the drawer. It was right there! Her gobstone! Well, technically it was Malfoy's gobstone but for the moment it was hers.
"So..." Haley began, disrupting the silence that had spread around them, after she had sat down across from Ginny. The tension that surrounded them was almost tangible.
Malfoy's body is translucent now. "I don't want to wake up. Stay," he pleads, reaching out his hand toward me. Then I notice it. Something flickering around his wrist. A watch. But that watch looks suspiciously like… a door? Of course! I was only as big as his thumb when I came here. So, maybe that's why the door is so small?
There was a soft crease between the boy's light eyebrows that told her he was still contemplating the meaning behind the words. It looked kind of cute. Haley felt something warm pool in her stomach that most likely had nothing to do with the autumn sun. The hand she was holding seemed a bit warmer now. But Malfoy's other hand was probably still cold. Why hadn't he warmed his hands in his coat pockets? That would have been sensible.
Hastily, Haley got up. For a moment longer she could hold them in. The feelings. There was no way, she was going to let Snape see her cry. Before the door had completely closed behind her, she swore, she heard him say, "Bloody teenagers." She didn't linger to check.
"It's just I've never heard of – you know… there's nothing about it in the library. How… how does it even work?"
"But… why?" Ron finally blurted incredulously. "I mean – I never understood what you saw in him in the first place… but… still…" He turned to Hermione. "Doesn't it seem pretty sudden?"
Malfoy stopped but there was an ugly grin on his face. "You can have your peace offering back," he drawled, glancing at the cupcake in his hand. "This is what I think of it."
Haley sighed. How was she going to explain this? "So… my mum invited me to come home on the weekend…"
In the right hand corner there was a small sitting area, secluded from the rest of the room by shelves filled with literature on potions.
"I made you peppermint tea." Simon said, cautiously pushing a cup of steaming tea over toward her. In her favourite cup that was shaped like an owl. The peppermint leaves looked as if they had been plucked only minutes before. He knew that was her favourite.
"What about purring? Is that befitting of a Malfoy?" She mocked him. He rolled his eyes. But he had already forgiven her. It seemed like a natural thing. Absently he thought that he would probably forgive her
"You painted such a vivid picture. But that's hardly what's important here." Hermione lifted an eyebrow. "Was I right? Is this about Malfoy? Does he secretly like you? How did you find out? Did he tell you? Did he confess it to you?"
Haley angrily shoved him off. "I can't believe you did this! After everything I did to help you and you – you–"
With these thoughts in mind I make my way toward the front of the room as well and lean back against the teacher's desk. That's practically a front row seat.
" he insisted impatiently. The way he tugged at her hand, Haley thought he was trying to tear her arm off or something. At least it wasn't her injured hand.
"I –" he started to say, another excuse already forming on his tongue. But he was stopped by a tiny hand on top of his.
All of a sudden he was surrounded by pleasant comfortable warmth and a foreign smell. Well, not that foreign. He had smelled the fragrance before… Unconsciously, he took a deep breath. He smelled the soap the house elves used to clean the laundry with. But also… something else. Something flowery and also… something that reminded him of owl treats. It shouldn't have smelled as good as it did. It was her. Haley. It was her fragrance. He pulled the cloth tighter around his shoulders absently. Then he noticed that he was being watched. His fingers froze where they were holding onto the fabric. Looking up, he realised it was just Potter. Well, not
"Thanks!" I wave at her one last time, before turning around and following the corridor to the dream door of Draco Malfoy.
"My dream door…" I repeat. I have no idea why I keep repeating mum's words like I'm too stupid to think of my own.
"It's okay," she said softly, reassuringly, "See. Nothing happened." She slowly reached for his hand, enveloping his fingers in pleasant warmth. It calmed him down somewhat. He really liked holding her hand. Her hands were always so warm.
"Thanks, love," she smiles back at me, reaching for my face and pinching my cheek. I don't even feel it. "I know why you're my favourite daughter."
"No! Not Snape! Draco bloody Malfoy!" She was being too loud. But the good thing about it was that the volume scared away the lingering Gryffindors. "Why would he say something like that? Doesn't he know it hurts? Doesn't he care?" Her voice sounded terribly close to breaking. But what did it matter? "I thought he'd
Draco took his time, reaching for the second cup of tea in the middle of the table and taking a few small sips. When he finally lowered the cup to the table again, he cleared his throat importantly. "I could. My
"Um..." Haley was confused, to say the least. What did Luna have to do with all of this? Why had she covered for her? Did she know about her and Malfoy?
"Come on, there's something we've got to do. Did you forget?" He asked Hermione impatiently. The boy was already up, sausage in hand dripping onto his robes.
I remember her like this. When I was a child we used to do this all the time. I think there's not a single wall in our house that we missed. Dad would always shake his head at the sight. Ask mum why she didn't use a spell. Mum would only raise an eyebrow and ask in return why he never used a spell to polish his quidditch trophies. He'd shrug then and leave us to our painting. Sometimes he'd join us. But only on the days where no quidditch match was being broadcast.
It was a bad safe. She was sure she looked far from cute in that moment. Sleepless and tired, yes. But sure as hell not
"Head massages," he finished lamely. He couldn't do it. Not while Potter was staring at him like that.
"You know, what she replied?" Haley didn't even wait for him to answer. "She said that people with cold hands are the kindest, because their hearts are warm."
"Will you put these back," Hermione asked tiredly, nodding toward the books that were still left on the table.
"Uh..." Damn, I'm really bad with words today. Almost as bad as my idiot brother. That's when I get the most amazing idea. "You probably know my sister," I say, rubbing the back of my neck, and attempting to make my voice sound deeper.
her. Something had to be holding him back… Perhaps he was afraid that she didn't reciprocate his feelings. Maybe he was waiting for a sign that she did. If so… he would have to prepare himself to wait for another while.
When I open my eyes again I notice him gazing out of the window. He hasn't even noticed my transformation! Instead he's watching the stupid clouds drift by.
It was like waking up from a trance. Haley turned back to the others but remained standing there for a moment, blinking at the window absently. She had the uncomfortable feeling that everyone's eyes were on her.
"But you care about him, don't you? He'll always be there for you. No matter what. And if your parents never have time for you, there's at least one person who does." There's so much longing in his voice, I want to look at him but I can't turn around because my had is caged in his hands. And also, I'm not supposed to open my eyes. Obviously.
"Dobby – what happened? Is Haley alright?" She asked, still out of breath from hurrying up the stairs. Dobby turned around too quickly. The many pairs of socks made him slip and fall to the ground. Reflexively, Hermione offered her hand to help him up. But as soon as she touched him, he disappeared, swiftly taking her along with him.
"Oh no!" Haley burst out, as soon as she got her breath back. "It's all crinkled." Pouting, she stared down at the ruined letter paper. Sometimes, she really acted more like a muggle than a witch.
"Did you do it because you liked him? Because you had feelings for him? Or was it just attraction? Or because he's a famous Quidditch player?"
"That's not… I'm sure there's a lot…" She wrecked her brain for something useful to say. "I mean, I don't even know what's your favourite – er… quidditch team."
? She hastily pushed up her sleeves only to discover that the colour went all the way up her arms. "
"Oh, th-that's a pity," Ron commented, his face turning even redder. "Guess it's just the two of us then."
The words seemed to confuse him. He kept looking back and forth between her face and the hand on his shoulder in a surprised way.
week of detention with Umbridge? Don't you see that's just what she wants? She wants you to lose your temper. Make you look like an angry, little child that nobody will take seriously. Can't you see? And you're playing right into her game! Is it really this hard to lay low for once? How can a person be this stupid? Seriously!"
For a moment we just look at each other, as we process the irony of our situations that seem different at first glance. But maybe they're not so different after all. Maybe we have more in common than we thought.
"Stop it," Haley whispered to the darkness, "It doesn't matter. He's the son of a Death Eater. He's your enemy. It doesn't matter."
"Yeah, well." She replied distractedly. His sneer reminded her of somebody else. But he hadn't really sneered at her like this for a long time now. Well, except for yesterday when she had accidentally turned him into a cat. The memory made her grin. But at the time she hadn't felt like laughing at all. He had made a cute cat but she had had no idea how to turn him back into a human again. Luckily, Malfoy had only eaten a little bit of George's candy, so that his transformation hadn't lasted more than a few minutes. Was she imagining this or was that him down the hall, snickering with one eyebrow raised in a mocking way? Had he heard their conversation? Haley groaned in annoyance. She turned around, continuing to walk in the direction of their class room.
"Ugh," he groaned, burying his face in the pillow. "What happened – Where… ?" He stopped, seemingly taking in his surroundings. "What – Is this – is this your bed?" Oh. So, he had noticed her. His voice sounded sleepy and rough. (And scandalised somehow.) It was a tad endearing. And a tad worrisome.
. She was all around him, filling his mind and making every thought that had nothing to do with the girl disappear. It was like everything he made her feel – impatience, worry, anger, fear,
Hello everyone! SO, now the angst begins... but it won't stay for long. What did you think? I'd love to hear any thoughts about the chapter :) How did you like Hedwig? I had so much fun writing her in the beginning of the chapter. You probably already guessed but Hedwig turned herself into the dragon from "The Neverending Story". I saw that movie as a child and it was awesome. But to be honest the book is so much better. Go read it :)
It filled her chest with shards of glass. "I wasn't honest with you before," she admitted. "But – what I'm feeling now – I don't know what to call it exactly but I know–" She paused, her voice catching and raised her other hand to gently brush away his tears with her knuckles. "Seeing you like this… it makes my
Draco suddenly gripped her arms, making her look up into his wide anger-filled eyes. "It wasn't father who killed Diggory!" He spat.
"Oh. I was keeping you from eating. Sorry," she said, realising that she had trapped his arms under hers. The way he was clutching the muffin it seemed as if he was trying to squash it. He was just staring in front of him, looking into space.
Haley's face grew hot. She cleared her throat again, glancing at her feet. She couldn't even deny it.
"Thank you, Haley. This really means a lot to me. I've been thinking about this so much, you know? I mean, clearly I was expecting Dumbledore to make
"If it bothers you this much," she replied, shrugging her shoulders. "But who are we talking about anyway? And how do you even know he has a crush on you?"
"I know," she whispered, taking his hands into hers. "It's important… yes. But… you're important, too." She hesitated. "To me… you're even more important."
"Stop! Stop it!" The boy yells unexpectedly and lifts his head. His face is a contorted mask of pain.
He was right. Then, right as they walked past a massive tapestry, showing a red three-headed dragon on a black background, Neville suddenly stopped.
But Malfoy didn't answer. In fact, with the way his eyes were closed and the calm rhythm of his breathing it almost seemed as if the boy was sleeping.
redeemable in him? Maybe she never had. Maybe he'd only made it up in his head and she hated him after all. Had never stopped.
Haley got up as well, a sudden anger filling her, stirred by the fact that he was treating her like a child. "I said it's not a joke. I'm serious!"
Shit. The last time, she'd missed Defence, Remus hadn't been amused at all. What if he told her mum? "Yeah, of course, let's go!" Hastily, she placed all the books back in the shelf and hurried out of the library.
"Don't look at me like that!" Haley vented, panic starting to creep into her bones. He was always making her lose control. Just by looking at her. Just by showing her that almost-smile. She had been trying so hard to block out her feelings. Any feelings. And he was about to ruin it.
As soon as the girl reached him, she gripped his arms tightly, her eyes fixing on his with burning intensity.
With a sudden bout of determination Draco seized the cup and gulped down the liquid in one go. For a few tense seconds nothing happened.
The words made her halt after all. For a moment, it seemed like she was going to turn around and come back to him. Tell him, it was all a lie and kiss him until he forgot all of their problems.
He glances from her to the heap of shiny stones in all colours of the rainbow. His hand hovers above the stones for a moment, indecisively.
Haley shook her head. She had long since stopped hating the boy. Had it really been hate in the first place? Whatever it had been it was different now.
"And Pomfrey? What are we going to tell her? That you found me? And kindly carried me all the way to the hospital wing?"
Right, they were still standing in the hall. Sirius shot George a calculating look, before re-entering the drawing room. There was nothing for Haley to do but follow. Once the door was closed behind her, Sirius pointed his wand at it and mumbled something under his breath that she couldn't understand.
She shook her head slowly, biting her lips and choosing to ignore the jab. "I thought… since our date last night got cut short… we ought to… use this wonderful day to… continue it."
"I am a fully qualified Ministry official, Malfoy, do you really think I cannot manage two wandless teenagers alone?" The witch interrupted him. "In any case, it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see. You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these escape."
Training passed like a blur. Haley wasn't really focusing on anything more than the joy of flying again. She always felt especially inspired when she was on her broom. Angelina wasn't exactly pleased. But the emergence of heavy rain clouds stopped her from being too mad. Normally, their captain would have made them continue training anyway but instead she told her team to regroup in the changing rooms for a speech on how they couldn't slack off just because they won against Hufflepuff and that she didn't want to see the Slytherins win the Cup especially because this was her last year. Her passionate speech would have made James Potter proud. Haley suppressed a grin.
Then Potter turned around again, snapping Draco out of his daze. She was walking away again. But Draco
The lines remained clear and blue against the white parchment. The boy smirked. He even got away with calling the fool an animal. That should be enough, right? He couldn't be expected to write anything more in the middle of the night. So, he folded up the parchment and tied it around the owl's leg again. For a second he considered placing an exploding hex on the letter but before he could even think of the incantation, the bird had flown off into the darkness. Even better. That meant he could finally go back to sleep now. A certain Gryffindor was waiting for him in his dreams.
"I really don't get what's so funny about this," he muttered darkly. "Must be because I'm not one of your precious
He felt so utterly humiliated, he wanted to turn around and let his claws slide all across her skin. Wait… had he just heard a chuckle? How dare she treat him like this? Had she planned this all along?
It felt like an arrow hitting her chest. It felt like a wall coming down around her heart, leaving it raw and vulnerable. It felt like a song being played on her heart strings.
Malfoy shook his head again but there was definitely a hint of pink, dusting his pale cheeks. That told her everything she needed to know. Haley suddenly jumped forward and reached for his pockets. To her dismay, Malfoy stopped her by grabbing her wrists. She glared at him.
"Nothing," Malfoy whispered, coming up next to her, "We're in Hogsmeade now. Five days ago to be precise."
"Yes. I found it in this little shop near our town. They also had moon sheep wool but that doesn't keep as warm as the yeti wool does."
"I used to be a student here, too, you know," mum reminds me. Well, of course I know that. It's not like I'm stupid or anything.
"Well, you could kiss him. If he kisses you in return he probably likes you and if he hexes you… he probably doesn't."
We walk down toward the lake, where a big red blanket appears out of nowhere. Before I can wonder where it has come from, there's a tablet with pastries in the middle of it and next to it a teapot with two teacups.
"I suppose," she replied, sitting up straighter. She still remembered the joyful expression on Cedric's face, right before they touched the portkey. She had to do it for him. People deserved to know the truth about his death. Haley nodded once to encourage herself. Hermione squeezed her arm.
"Okay, everything's ready now. You can come down." Called Lily's voice from the lab downstairs. Then her fiery red locks came into view, piled up messily on top of her head.
Haley bit her lips. "Not yet," she answered. "I think we both need some more time." She had been really hurt by the words of their friend. She wasn't going to apologize first.
It was really sweet the way he was trying to pretend this didn't matter to him when it was obvious how much thought he had put into it.
." He slowly interlaced his fingers with hers. She liked the way it felt. Like he didn't want to let go.
"Or your pointy little ears?" She giggled, her face lighting up with mirth. She was so beautiful. It was really unfair that she had to be this attractive when he wanted to feel cross with her. It looked like she wasn't going to shut up. Unless he made her. Which he gladly did. In the sweetest way possible.
"Well… maybe not the first half. I think… it could have been a real memory. It all seemed so familiar. And I do remember giving my gobstones set to some boy when I was younger. I just never… connected that boy with Malfoy."
"Anyway," Michael continued, "everything's kind of messed up, now right? After Cedric… and everything. Nothing will ever be the same..." There was silence for a moment.
"No. I didn't spy on you. The only people I visited were mum, Simon and Malfoy." Then she remembered something. "Oh right, and Hedwig."
They went back to the castle for lunch and as they reached the Entrance Hall, Haley spotted Malfoy, leaning against the banisters of the staircase. He almost seemed like he was waiting for something. There was a thoughtful, almost pensieve air about him. When they passed him an annoying smirk appeared on his face.
I gasp audibly. I try to stifle it but it seems neither of the two boys have noticed me. It's Malfoy. Malfoy is the one that's being put down by Neville… I can't believe this!
. Earlier it had probably been a mere slip because she had been under stress. But now? He was sure she had used his first name deliberately. And she had
With a sour expression on his face Ron looked around the compartment. Nobody would meet his eyes. He crossed his arms in front of his chest. Haley bit her lips, trying to keep from giggling. Her friend was simply too funny when he was annoyed.
I can tell he's just teasing but that doesn't stop me from teasing back. "You dye it first," I challenge, lifting an eyebrow.
"Why are you giving me your old quidditch gloves?" Haley asked Simon, while they were waiting in front of the barrier that lead to platform 9 ¾. Their parents were somewhere on the platform, busily talking to some of their old friends from school.
So much for putting on a cool and indifferent mask. He had tried that for a few seconds. But in the end he had lost the battle against the ambush of his feelings.
I make my way over to the two boys and take a seat in the armchair that's next to the couch. I'm too nervous to sit opposite him. This way he won't catch me that easily.
Because it wasn't really the past, that the sight of her made him think of. It was the future. If she ever had a daughter… would she look like this? Would she have Haley's eyes and his hair?
"She's right about that," the Fat Lady commented, her portrait swinging open in exactly that moment.
Since everyone was busy eating in the Great Hall, Gryffindor tower was completely deserted. At least no one was staring at her that way. Inside her dorm, she found herself alone as well. She threw herself onto her bed in frustration.
"I mean," He seemed to change his approach. "If you really have to go," he took her hand determinedly. "I'm coming with you."
Mum sets her cup down. "I told you that the handle is electrified? The key interrupts the electricity and in order to obtain the key you need to fetch the right one from the cauldron first."
Haley shook her head, trying not to grin. "What did you do to my boyfriend?" She muttered, frowning in mock-confusion.
"Where are you going?" Her voice is unusually low. Lower than the voice of a girl her age is supposed to sound. At the same time it sounds chirpy like a young bird. Suddenly I grow suspicious. Who is that girl? I turn to face her, squinting my eyes at her.
She added that last line only because she knew she wasn't going to send the letter anyway. But this one time… she wanted to be honest to herself at least. Then she crumpled up the paper and went back to bed. For the rest of the night, she didn't have any more dreams. Instead, there was a barely there feeling of hope that carried her through the night.
"I do not mean to rush you," Snape said calmly, gaze fixed on the lone rose petal. "But whatever your decision will be, you should make up your mind before the weekend." That gave him three more days. Three more days to make a decision that was likely going to influence the rest of his life.
"I mean – It's not supposed to be like that. He's supposed to forgive me and forget this ever happened. Especially, after everything he's done to me in the past! I'm supposed to forget all those horrible pranks he pulled and he can't do the same? How is that fair? Stupid Slytherins think they can get through with everything!" My fist hits the floor, expressing my anger.
It seemed like Malfoy was surprised over her sudden change in attitude. Then he considered her question and seemed to hesitate for a moment.
A smug little smirk appeared on the Slytherin's face and he leaned back slightly. His gaze was focused on his right hand that had started to play around with the sleeve of her robes.
"Fine, you can stay. I was going to leave anyway," he said, closing the book that had been lying on the table in front of him untouched for a while.
One glance at the sloppy writing told her it was from her dad. It had not even been a week and he already missed her. With a smile Haley broke the seal and opened the letter.
He grimaced, pulling up a shoulder. "With assistance." He turned to lie on his back. Facing the ceiling instead of her. "Obviously, I can still chop stuff and throw ingredients into a cauldron." He almost growled. "Lighting the fire though… casting necessary spells… I can't do that," he whispered, his hand balling to a fist. "Pansy always does it. Although she thinks I'm just too lazy," he admitted somberly.
"I don't have a little problem, Potter," Malfoy hissed in annoyance but still placed the pillow strategically on his lap.
Mum ruffles my hair fondly. "To get his magic back, silly. That's why you sent me the letter, isn't it?"
The girl winked at the Slytherin who was looking back and forth between her and the portrait. Then she stepped through the portrait door, which promptly closed behind her.
"No one," I mutter, picking up the guitar swiftly. Getting the solo right this time around is much easier than the last time. Still, my fingers slip once or twice on the strings. Does Myron mind? I look at the poster but the singer does not seem impressed at all. Damn. I give it another try and this time my fingers don't slip… notably.
Malfoy opens his mouth to argue but he can't seem to find the right words. Something washes through the whole room like an invisible wave. A feeling? No. Different feelings. Humiliation, sadness, anger, frustration. Shame. Helplessness. Fear. I feel them as sharply as if they were my own. They strike a note somewhere deep inside of me. This is how I feel every time Malfoy finds a new way to torment me. I chance a look at him. He looks devastated.
"It's time to wake up now," she says. I can't explain how it happened exactly but I'm standing on the window sill of my dorm again. Next to me stands the girl from before. Hedwig. She smiles at me in an encouraging way. I stumble backwards and not a second later find myself on the hard ground in the middle of the dream corridor. I'm alone now. And more confused than ever.
"Very funny," Draco muttered with a scowl. This was unsettling. How just a couple of words were enough to make him doubt this. He really didn't want their date to be over. Or anything else between them for that matter. How could Potter joke about that?
I walk through the door and find myself inside a café. My brother sits at one of the tables and eats scones. With lots of butter. I run over to him and attack him with a bone-crushing hug.
"Why are you here, again?" She asked forcing herself to stay calm. And quiet. She didn't want to disturb Draco.
In response, he ran his free hand through his temporary brown locks, seemingly looking for an adequate answer. "I don't know. Maybe I'm as much of a fool as you." For the first time, he grinned. It seemed almost shy.
"I wasn't… she was the one who… I…" And just like that he'd turned from an angry bull to a sheepish boy. "She shouldn't have eavesdropped, then." He grumbled, fixing the kid with an irritated glare. The girl glared right back. She had found refuge inside a small kitchen cupboard. A sack of potatoes was carelessly lying on the ground next to it.
“Ru’s pants!” Draco huffed. “I didn’t spend twelve hours in a flying metal tube just to go home on the first episode! I am determined to survive this lip sync.”
Draco said nothing, not sure how to explain away an owl in his hotel room. It hadn’t been there when he came in a few minutes before. It had worn a ribbon marked as a portkey on its other leg. The bird had apparently been portkeyed directly into his room and would likely portkey back now that its delivery had been made.
” Helena added. “I liked that she did some traditional Indian dance on the runway. It doesn’t completely make up for bad acting, but she’s got some fierce looks.”
“That’s the stick she gotta take out of her ass so she can lip sync for her life!” Acacia cackled. Draco responded with an eye roll and a rude gesture.
“Carmelita,” she responded coolly. “Obviously, she’s been cast on the show to be a villain rather than show any sort of improvement or character arc. She’d do better to go home and learn her manners. And constellations,” she added.
“I just thought you looked like a 1940s secretary,” Martha Stewart added. “It didn’t seem to go with what you were saying. It’s just unfortunate, since you look so beautiful tonight.”
"Come here," she says, when she notices me. She puts the book aside and waves me over. The sight of her in her paint coveralls that are covered in specks of colour is so achingly familiar, I might cry.
She didn't remember the walk back to her tower. When she entered the common room it was fairly empty at least. Most students had probably gone to bed already.
A warm feeling surfaced within her at the sight of Luna's happy face. She had done the right thing after all.
This time Haley wasn't surprised by the kiss. Just as she had closed her eyes she felt a sharp pain in her lower lip. He'd bitten her! That jerk! It was probably because she had laughed at him.
When she looked back at the tree trunk again, someone was standing beside it. It was Malfoy. And he was glaring daggers at them. This was unusual. What happened to being indifferent?
"I know," I mumble into the fluffy fur of her neck. It's warm and soft here. Too comfortable to be real.
George chuckled. "You never tried the toffee, did you? When you don't have an invisibility cloak you need to find other ways to sneak around."
"Fine." He sat on the windowsill next to her with an impatient sigh. "So? What's wrong with her? What happened? Did you save her godfather?"
"Didn't you say we should be nice to her?" Ron asked, slightly frowning at her. She… vaguely remembered saying something like that.
In exactly that moment, Malfoy reached for something that had been hidden in the shadows next to him and placed it between them. It was a huge basket full of sandwiches and pumpkin juice.
Haley shook her head in annoyance as she climbed up the stairs tiredly. She didn't understand how they could be so relaxed with everything that was happening. She wanted to forget about her worries, too. She wanted to lie in her bed for once, without having to brace herself for another nightmare. As she was lying there, staring at the black ceiling above, she tried desperately not to think about a blond boy, who she'd see again tomorrow. A boy who might or might not like her. Who she might find a tiny bit likable herself.
She couldn't do it. She couldn't even imagine what Hermione would do if she found out she was sneaking around in other people's dreams.
He got up, glancing away from her. “We should go back. You probably don’t want to miss another class.”
As suddenly as the swarm of fairies had appeared, they now zoomed away again through the hole behind the portrait.
"Who's there?" He asks. The room seems to be empty beside the two of us. I quickly hide behind the nearest bedpost but too late. He already spotted me.
The rich taste of the soy sauce accented with countless spices left an explosion of flavours and pure delight on her tongue. She closed her eyes, seeing herself in London with Simon. The both of them trying noodle soup for the first time. Her trying to forget her broken heart. She was in the kitchens with the house elves, abandoned by her closest friends. She was in the kitchens with Malfoy, slurping her noodles while he pestered her about one thing or another. Or maybe just… keeping her company. When no one else would.
so. I don't care for false promises and empty words." He glared at her warily. Maybe it hadn't been the most clever way of putting it.
… Right. This was the perfect chance. What had she said again? She should hold his hand? Just as Malfoy was removing his hand from her face, Haley caught it in mid-air and almost slammed it against the table. Her sudden movement caused him to jerk backwards in surprise.
"Right," I agree with another nod. Then I consider his words. "Wait, Squibs can't ride broomsticks?"
"Huh?" Draco replied, like the dignified person he was. In his defense, his mind had been preoccupied with… other… important… matters. Reluctantly he turned toward the voice that had so impolitely disturbed him.
"Well, what choice do I have?" He blurted, his voice too loud, "We're not on the same – Father would – I can't – It's too dangerous. You wouldn't understand." He ended quietly.
The question is so random that I find myself just nodding. Of course I know how to make a fishtail braid!
Suddenly he looked up, something urgent in his gaze, "Do you know why the good ones always win?" He asked, sounding like he was actually curious what she thought about this. Haley furrowed her brows.
"Sirius Black," she added, "I'm sure you've heard of him." Malfoy sat up but didn't say anything. He sat down opposite her, leaning his back against the tree and pulling up one of his legs.
Hermione smiled at her warmly and pulled out the chair next to her. Hesitantly, she walked over and let herself sink onto the chair between Hermione and Luna. Her gaze kept wandering to the older witch opposite her, who was taking her in like she was the most promising meal on the menu.
Tiny orange velvet paws came into her view then. Haley sighed again. It was just a cat. Light-footedly, it jumped onto the window sill and rubbed its head against the dark stone wall. Maybe the cat had caused the telescope to fall down in the first place. She got up and watched the animal thoughtfully. There was something caught between its teeth. A mouse? No. It was… a toffee? The cat dropped the toffee and meowed at her in a way that seemed almost disappointed. Then it hopped down again and vanished into the darkness. Haley picked up the candy and held it in front of her eyes. It wasn't a brand she had seen before. She shrugged, putting it back on the window sill again. It was just candy.
I don't want to see that. But I want to know if everything happens exactly in the same way it did this afternoon.
"Of course you can have it back," Malfoy said almost sweetly. That was odd. She hadn't thought he would give in so easily.
"And you must be Draco, then?" Lily asked, turning to the nervous boy. "It's a pleasure to meet you." There was nothing but warmth in her voice. It seemed to settle Draco's nerves somewhat.
"What the-?" Haley jumped to her feet and got as far away from the insects as possible, almost stumbling into the couch, which Draco seemed to find incredibly amusing. Calmly, he sat at the table and chuckled.
"Fine, I won't." She amended. "But I honestly don't see what you're waiting for. You've been dancing around each other for years now."
How strange that he could still smell it, though. Musty, mouldy. That foul smell of mothballs and dead flowers.
I turn left and walk down the corridor past my brother's door and a handful others. Then I finally reach it. Draco Malfoy's dream door.
"What's that?" She asked, gesturing toward the single word that was engraved into the fairy's back, almost too small to be seen. She couldn't decipher it.
"This is stupid. Just tell me." Honestly, I just want to know his stupid secret. Malfoy drops his gaze to his fingers.
she wanted to protest but he was already wrapping her up in that Slytherin green scarf that was so much softer than it looked. And comfortably warm. And the way it
, Haley thought, as she arrived in front of the doors that lead to the Great Hall. After entering the hall, she made a beeline for the Gryffindor table.
"What is the meaning of this?" Snape entered the room in a swish of dark robes. The door closed behind him with a soft click. Draco wasn't sure whether to be happy or anxious about finally seeing him.
"I just… I wanted to end this night on a lighter note…" he said after what felt like several minutes.
So, as always leave me your thoughts and I hope you have as much fun reading as I'm having writing this :)
George Weasley reached for something above the girl's headless body and suddenly her friend's face reappeared. Haley's heart started beating again.
The song ends as I take the boy's hand and will myself to be tiny enough to fit through the door that's disguised as a watch. The hand that I've been holding just a second earlier is dissolving to nothing now. My seeker reflexes make me reach for the door handle, just as it begins to tumble down as well. Even the door is fading now. I tear it open mid-fall and hurl myself through it with the last bit of strength that's left in me. Although I heavily land in a heap on the floor of the dream corridor, I'm immensely relieved. Who knows for how long I would have been stuck in the nothingness of Malfoy's not-dream this time?
"Now, I'll do yours," he announces, biting his lips excitedly. It's endearing. Especially seeing as he looks more like an elf than a rock star with his new hair style.
There's a tiny part of me wanting to check. Get a teensy glimpse into his subconscious and find out if he really does hate me. But that's foolish of course. It's exactly that kind of thinking that got me into this mess in the first place.
Bandy. Bandy had cooked this. For her? She hadn't even asked him to. And why would he send it up to her table in the Great Hall? Malfoy was behind this. He was the only one who knew – but he wasn't even in the hall! Which made sense. If he was involved in this, he was probably down in the kitchens.
"And in your case, I –" He bit his lips nervously. "I don't plan to replace you. Ever." He averted his eyes sheepishly. Somehow that had sounded less cheesy in his head.
Before taking the potion, Haley caught Draco's eyes. He looked just as anxious as she felt. The image of him fainting in exactly the same spot only a few hours earlier was still vivid in her memory. Was he going to collapse again?
But before she turned away completely, she whispered something into Draco's ear. "Don't be afraid. I believe in you. Just believe… that magic works." She half-sang that last part like the line from Draco's favourite Weird Sisters song.
He looked up from his book and fixed her with a contemplative stare. "I'm not sure yet," he returned carefully. "Just tell me, once you've found him."
It was clear that she was addressing the boy, but he didn't show in any way that he'd heard her. His eyes, though hadn't moved from the same spot in at least a minute, which told her that he was only pretending to read.
"Because…" she started to say and then stopped because she couldn't think of a single reason that would make his doubts disappear right away. So instead she grinned and said, "Because I really like kissing you." With that she pulled him down to her and pecked his lips sweetly.
Quidditch was not Haley's favourite pass time, if she was honest. It was mostly her brother and her dad who were the quidditch fanatics in her family. But there had been a free spot as Seeker in her first year, and everyone always said what a fantastic Seeker James Potter had been and that surely she would have inherited his talent… So, just like everyone expected she had tried out, coincidentally caught the snitch and had been accepted without further questions. Since then, no one had dared kicking her off the team, not even on her worse days.
"Stop being like this," she murmured, "Stop being nice to me. Don't act like you care when you're going to treat me like the dirt underneath your shoes just a second later! Stop confusing me! Stop toying around with me like this!" Her voice had gradually started to get louder. All of a sudden she felt so angry. It was like all the build up frustration and confusion from the last weeks was finally coming to a peak.
"We should go." She whispered breathlessly. "I don't wanna miss Transfigurations." He kept dropping little kisses all over her face. Fleeting, like the touch of butterfly wings.
"No fightin' in my lessons!" Hagrid thundered, interrupting him. He stepped between the two boys, forcing Malfoy to let go of Neville. "Didn't ye say ye found a glumbumble?"
Mum openly laughs at me. "You wanted to look intimidating and fierce," she replies with an amused grin.
Haley grabbed another napkin from the table behind her and hastily wiped the remaining blood off Draco's fingers. "It's okay. Don't worry – What-Whatever you heard – just forget it," she said hastily. "It's not important – you – you don't have to worry about it. It's okay."
"Just confirming," she answered innocently. The boy took hold of her hand that was just hovering there in front of his face. His eyebrows were pulled together. Like he wasn't quite sure what to make of her. Then he snorted, shaking his head. "You're ridiculous," he mumbled softly. His words were far from flattering but his voice sounded so affectionate and sweet that he might as well have told her she was adorable or something along those lines. She didn't think she could ever get used to this side of him. How was she supposed to react to that?
"Fine. Show me what that magic umbrella can do," she muttered, ignoring the triumphant grin on the boy's face.
"Why can't you just..." The Slytherin muttered, raising his left hand slowly until it hovered in front of Haley's face. The way he was
Haley chuckled. "Well, it's not like we can actually walk down the path to Hogsmeade together. Everyone would see us."
Luna opened the black cover that looked so old it was surprising it wasn't falling apart by just touching it.
"You're not embarrassed, are you?" He calls after me but I'm already at the door, pulling at the handle violently. I'm gone before Malfoy gets the chance to utter even one more word.
"I'm sorry. Really." He said earnestly. "I'm just so… happy, you know?" He looked more than happy. Radiant was a good description. Ecstatic. That and endlessly relieved. It was a tiny bit contagious.
"Why don't you try writing him a letter?" Hermione suggested. "I mean, obviously you won't be able to send it because the Ministry's reading our letters but… you know it might be easier to express all your thoughts by writing them down. You can give him the letter, when we're back at Hogwarts."
"And so the snake fell in love with the lion. What a brave lion. What a thoughtless and stupid snake."
"Well, mum was going to take them away, once she found out about the electric shocks… What was I supposed to do?" He retorted defiantly.
"I'm good," I say with a shake of my head. I'm not sure the nausea from earlier isn't going to make a return. Besides, I'm contend just resting my head on my brother's shoulder and watching him eat happily. It's almost enough to make me forget the scene I witnessed only minutes before.
"Right! I was stupid for trying to help you!" She shot back. "I was stupid to think you'd actually want your magic back!" For a second her own outburst surprised her. A few months ago she would never have talked back like that.
"Yes, of course, I mean it," Haley replied. It didn't sound like the girl had many friends. She felt bad for the Ravenclaw.
"I," Haley took a deep breath, trying to focus. "I'm always in this strange place… some kind of desert, I think. And Sirius is there, too. He – he's captured inside a huge hour glass and he can't get out. Then he calls out to me, asks me to help him. But when I ask him how…" She trailed off, reluctant to continue.
As always thank you so much for reading and leaving kudos! I love reading you're lovely comments :) Thank you!
Haley couldn't do more than blink stupidly as the boy in front of her took her left hand in his and started to play with her fingers. The unexpected touch made a shiver run up her arm, making her wonder whether it was caused by the touch itself or the coldness of the boy's fingers.
"Or perhaps, he told the truth," Hermione stressed for the hundredth time after two weeks of Malfoy ignoring her. "With the OWLs being so close, I'm sure he realised that he could spend his time in a much more sensible way. Like studying."
Wow, what a chapter! Uh... I don't even know what to say this time... Hope y'all survived this angst fest! Ahem... leave me your thoughts?
He stares at me for a moment as if considering me. "You seem familiar," he says then, narrowing his eyes like he's trying to remember something. "You remind me of someone. A girl, I think."
"Neville." Haley pressed, kneeling down beside him. "You can tell me," she urged him, willing the boy to at least look at her.
So, she hadn't planned it beforehand. But still… she'd pretended nothing was wrong and even given him that stupid
Quickly, she opened the book to said page and found… nothing. The page was completely empty of any scribblings. Only in the right bottom corner, almost too small to see, were five tiny words.
. Or was there perhaps a chance that one person in particular hadn't seen her embarrass herself? She didn't check. She was much more occupied with the task of fixing her potion.
, can't I stay here? I don't wanna go back to Hogwarts," Haley Potter groaned over dinner like a five-year-old. It certainly was an unusual sight. For one, the auburn-haired girl wasn't known for behaving like a toddler and for another she loved Hogwarts! She loved learning about magic and spending every day with her friends but… something was definitely bothering her.
"It's fine," I interrupt him. "You don't have to try to make something up. I know I'm not that special. Aside from being pretty. And being a
Haley closed her eyes. This was getting more and more complicated. "You can't." She said opening her eyes.
The Slytherin inspected the cupcake from all sides. "What else are you offering?" He drawled lazily. She had to suppress a yawn at the sight of him. Wait? What? Offering? She furrowed her brows.
"I thought so." Gently, Haley placed her hand on the girl's shoulder. "You don't want to regret not following your heart, do you?"
"I'll try again," she said, dabbing at her eyes. Her voice sounded much steadier than she felt. "Just give me a moment to–"
"Or you could also wait for the effect to wear off by itself. Who knows how long that's going to take, though." Challenging her always worked. She shot him a glare but still took the cup and a hesitant sip. She put it down with a grimace.
Dumbledore who gave it to me but… it really is an heirloom. It's… It belonged to my dad," she said quietly, all amusement gone.
"I know why you're really angry at Neville." She took another step forward, cornering him against the wall. Suddenly she was in control. It felt exhilarating.
Haley took a deep breath. She needed to stay calm if Malfoy was about to go all dramatic on her. This wasn't the time for a fight.
What? Haley abruptly turned her head to him. "Promise? I never promised anything like that," she protested.
"I see." He replied, nodding slowly. He knew not to question her by now. "Did you go shopping together?" He asked, trying to picture the Gryffindor and the Ravenclaw inside a wool shop. It was a rather strange image.
He wasn't listening to her. "Ron, please! I – There are no spells involved, okay? He's done nothing to me – I just–" She bit her lips. Her next words would be explosive for sure. "I like him, okay? I
She looked up at her friend, carefully avoiding to glance toward the Slytherin table. Why would anything bother her? Apart from the fact that bloody Malfoy apparently had a crush on her? Or that the only manner in which he seemed to know how to deal with his feelings was to make her life a living hell. Or that she kept visiting him in his dreams to find out what he was hiding. Or that he had actually gone and
"Haley." The boy seemed relieved to see her. Had he been looking for her? "Why do you keep disappearing?" He asked, coming over to Draco's bed. "We've been looking for you all evening!" We? Was he talking about Ron and Hermione? It felt good somehow to have people worry about you. Had anyone besides her been worried about Draco?
While she was following him she wondered whether Ginny was back yet. Was she still in that class room? Had it even been her in the first place? Haley wasn't hundred per cent sure but if it had been Ron's sister, was she supposed to tell Ron about it?
With one swift movement the box was open but Draco found the girl's face much more interesting. Did she like it?
"Well, you're certainly behaving like one." Hermione shot back. "Are you going to keep skipping classes today as well?"
"Hm?" He asked, his tongue swiping over his lips briefly, as if he was tracing the taste of her lips.
"Do come in." Professor Snape's distant voice greeted him, when he knocked on the door to his office. The door magically opened and Draco had no choice but to step into the office. It was uncomfortable. Not knowing what to expect. How to act. He schooled his face into a neutral mask.
"What did you remember, sir?" Simon asked, picking up the napkin and wiping butter globs off his fingers. Haley grimaced. She would never get used to that.
"Come on, we should go," she said, voice still tinged with laughter. Draco didn't want to go. If they left now it meant their time together was almost over. The walk back to Hogwarts was all that was left.
She shouldn't have said that. Because after those words, the boy to Haley's right jumped to his feet with a murderous expression on his face and lunged toward the cabinet.
. Her eyes fell on the leather band around her wrist. She tore it off and threw it against the curtains around her bed in frustration. Why was her heart beating like this? Was it because of the kiss? Or because of the way he had looked at her? Or was it his words? No. She shook her head in disgust. The mere thoughts repelled her. It had to be because of the surprise. And she had woken up so suddenly. That had to be it.
"Are you coming?" After no more than two steps, she half-turned around to check why he wasn't following, when she was suddenly lifted off her feet once more.
Malfoy turned to look at her again. There was a daisy in his hand. "But now you also understand it… right?" He asked.
"Show me." He didn't say it unkindly but the house elf already glanced over to a cooking spoon as if he was planning to hit himself with it.
Then finally her eyes landed on the door, where none other than Michael Corner was standing, looking as surprised as she felt. Haley was already prepared for her heart to either stop or start pounding madly. It did neither. All her heart did was stutter slightly, before marching on as if nothing extraordinary had happened. As if it suddenly was okay. And shockingly Haley found that it
Wait, didn't I hear a voice just now? I stop to listen closely. Yes, that was definitely a voice. Two voices if I'm correct. An indigo blue balloon the size of a carriage floats past me, making me shiver again. Does the cold emanate from these balloons? What would happen if I touched one of them? There is a figure somewhere in front of me. Is it Malfoy? I take a few steps toward the figure – it's a boy – but before I can reach him he jumps on one of the balloons, standing on top of it.
"Let me…show you," he said with renewed confidence, "Give me… I don't know – three months to show you how serious I am about this. How much I…
What made him stop wasn't that they were all Ravenclaws or that they were fourth years. No. The fact that was even more interesting was that Potter had hid her face behind a gigantic book, as soon as she had seen the Ravenclaws enter. His target had to be among them! Now he only had to find out, who of them he'd have to curse. He grinned to himself. Cursing people was the best.
"Wow." Ron stared at the card as if it had personally offended him. "Malfoy's done a great job turning you into a Slytherin."
"I-it's not?" For a moment I'm flooded with a strong feeling of relief and a tiny hint of disappointment. I chalk it up to hurt pride. "You mean he's not… into me?"
Haley shrugged, sitting down at the table with her book clutched to her chest. "It's a brilliant book."
When the Ravenclaw reached out and touched Potter's face with his dirty halfblood hands, Draco almost lost his patience, already reaching for his wand with a spell ready on his lips. But something stopped him. Or better yet,
“Er…” Haley studied her feet. She hadn’t anticipated the question. “Hermione and I… we’re not really talking at the moment,” she admitted, clearing her throat. “I’m sure… you’ve noticed.” He’d witnessed their fight. And surely he had noticed that Haley wasn’t sitting with her once-best friends during meals any more. She started walking down the corridor toward the Great Hall, Neville falling into step beside her.
"There's really no reason to be that happy about it." He said grumpily but pulled her closer nevertheless.
The obvious way he was trying not to laugh gave her the rest. She had to make a hilarious sight. She snorted, before chuckling softly herself. The absurdity of the situation! If Uncle Vernon could see her now.
Malfoy seemed to be thrown off by the sudden question. A number of emotions that went by too fast for Haley to decipher flashed over his face.
Just to be sure, he held one ear to the door and listened. Nothing. With a smirk Draco opened the now unlocked door and walked into the bath room.
And there is another monster chapter. I don't know if you can tell but I tried to include as little angst as possible. The poor children need a break before... the next blow hits. Possibly. Who thinks it's time for Draco to meet Lily? Leave me your thoughts and stay positive!
. Much less refer to the boy by using his first name. But now that she had admitted her feelings to herself it seemed as easy as talking about magic.
Instead of answering Malfoy grins at me, pulling me down the street until we reach one of my favourite spots in Diagon Alley: Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour.
"Let go!" She pulled once more, this time so forcefully that she fell onto her back, pulling the Slytherin right along with her.
"There is someone! There really is someone. I can't wait to find out who the unlucky chap is. Probably Longbottom or some other loser, right?"
He eyed her cloak once more. Almost making a show of it. She knew it was petty but somehow she couldn't just offer her cloak to him. She wanted him to ask. She wondered how long it would take until he asked.
I chuckle hysterically. "That's ridiculous, I'm sure we can agree on something else…" I babble. But the boy shakes his head and crosses his arms in front of his chest. "Those are my conditions."
"Bye, Haley! Bye Luna! We'll make sure to get you lots of sweets and stuff from Zonko's!" Ron called back good-naturedly. It didn't take long for them to disappear out of sight.
Looking back over her shoulder, Haley beckoned Draco over to join them. He kind of looked as if he wanted to grab the drinks and do who knew what with them. Maybe empty them over her head.
But what had Haley done? What had she done to deserve being tortured by a group of adults? She was no muggle. And even if she was… would that justify what she had to go through?
Haley shrugged. "The usual. There's not all that much you can do in Hogsmeade." Except for having a picnic with your former enemy. Or falling asleep beside your former enemy. Or kissing your former enemy. She felt heat rush to her cheeks at the thought. Hopefully it was too dark for Hermione to notice.
The girl snorts. "You haven't figured that out? How disappointing," she retorts, cocking her head to the side in a way that reminds me of a bird. She pouts, fiddling about with her white dress, which I now realise is completely made out of feathers.
Draco didn't linger on these worries. He couldn't afford to linger, because if he lingered, would he ever be able to stop? So, no less than a second after Potter attacked him, he spat venomously,
One day Neville had told her, he didn't feel ready to be in a committed relationship just then. He'd said that he cherished their friendship too much to ruin it over a romantic relationship. And if they still wanted to they would have enough time to try again later.
Why hadn't she just let that stupid paper burn? It had only been a cartoon kitten. What if Malfoy took that as some sort of sign? What if he kept pestering her? What if he stopped?
"Yes. Very clever." Her shirt is still sparkling which kind of irritates me. There are so many colours! I slowly turn to the door we've just stepped through.
"Exactly!" Haley exclaimed, her heart starting to beat violently. "What happened to his body? Since when does the Killing Curse make bodies vanish?"
"I thought you'd read the interview." The girl replied calmly. In the deserted corridor her voice sounded unnaturally loud.
It almost seemed like a dream. But then, kissing him in her dreams had been vastly different. For one, it had been extremely short because of her reluctance to kiss him. And besides that it had been a much less sensual experience. Because she had been dreaming, everything had lacked this sharp sense of reality. She hadn't felt the smoothness of his hair or the softness of his lips. She also hadn't perceived the way he smelled. It was something woodsy, like resin, which was probably because they had been in the woods earlier. But there was something else as well. Something flowery like lavender and something minty. She could even hear him breathing close to her.
"I…" He shook his head, in an attempt to make sense of the things she had said before. "You mean… you've made them yourself?"
The way he was smiling at her didn't help. In fact, it made the guilt feel even heavier in her stomach. When he'd mentioned his parents earlier, she had almost had a heart attack. If there had ever been a chance that Draco's family could approve of her, she had ruined it an hour ago. As soon as they found out about the article, they would deeply despise her. If they didn't do that already.
"Who's there?" He repeated impatiently. But something had captured Haley's attention that she found more interesting than giving him an answer. She had been too focused on trying to be quiet before but now she noticed that something was different. Had Malfoy's hair always been this long? Well, she couldn't have known because there had always been tons of gel keeping it hidden. But now… it was framing his pale face, softening his features and coming to rest somewhere between his chin and his ears. It looked really soft and with a blush she realised that she found the Slytherin surprisingly cute like this.
The Gryffindor stared at him as if he'd just asked him to marry him. Which was probably as unlikely as the thing he had actually said. Well, he couldn't say the words had come across his lips easily. The things he did for Haley Potter.
"So basically I just need a personal object and I need to get past whatever is guarding the dream door in order to visit someone in their dreams?"
He didn't want her to know. He didn't want anyone to find out about this. But then… if mother was right, it would be in the papers soon enough anyway. Silently, he handed over the letter.
"Right!" Ron looked at his watch again and shouldered his broom. "I'll save you some sandwiches. Or Hermione will. If she's not still cross with you because of this morning." He patted her arm affectionately. Then he seemed to remember something. "I'm sure, she'll forgive you if you apologise."
Malfoy takes out his wand and points it at Neville. That one gesture causes Neville to start chuckling amusedly. It sounds uncharacteristically cruel. He doesn't look the slightest bit intimidated or frightened. I don't see his wand anywhere.
When they reached the Entrance Hall and glanced at the big wall clock they realised there were still at least two hours until supper.
"Right." He got up and made his way to the door. Before opening it, he stopped. "The witch in the story… what was her name?"
"It's not… really – something… I would do, is it? Can't have people mistake me for a Gryffindor! Or even worse, one of those sickeningly well-meaning
"I want to… I want to apologize." His voice was quiet, unsure. Almost a whisper. She'd heard those words before… Or was she just imagining things?
The girl nodded. "The witch also said, they work best if there's someone you really want to protect." She picked up a biscuit that was shaped like a heart. How cheesy. "You could also use them as a good luck charm. And don't you think it's cute that the two of you have matching charms?"
Number one: Malfoy was a git. Nothing new there. Number two: He was an arrogant, annoying, little ferret. Number three: He used every chance he got to humiliate her and – and… that wasn't right. Last year… at the Yule Ball… he had been acting surprisingly nice toward her. To be fair, Malfoy had also spent a big part of that night annoying the hell out of her… but… he'd also been… really
But that wasn't possible, was it? Haley remembered the note then. The first one. Where he'd asked her to meet up in the kitchens. Haley had waited but Malfoy had never shown up!
"Ravenclaw?" I test the word on my tongue, liking the sound of it. Maybe he's right. Draco smiles at me and nods, brushing away a strand of hair from my face with his other hand. His fingers trace along my cheek with a gentleness that startles me.
There's a knowing look on mum's face. "He sent you a package, didn't he? That's why there were so many cinnamon rolls missing." She chuckles. "I'll tell him you liked it."
Bright spots appeared in front of Haley's eyes. She tried to blink them away but that only increased the dizziness.
"I'm sorry I don't have anything more positive to tell you." Luna squeezed her arm. And that wasn't right. She wasn't going to accept this. Whatever this was. Not like this.
"Potter, you're crushing my fingers! Are you mad?" He exclaimed and tore his hand and eyes away from her. He didn't look flustered or seem affected by her at all.
"Sirius Black… was killed?" He repeated, taken aback. "But how? You said it was a trap. Why was he there then?"
As soon as we get to the door mum opens it. It leads us right to the dream corridor! As we step into the hall I glance at all the doors longingly. Mum is already at my door, waiting for me.
Potter stared at him incredulously. Nevertheless, she seemed strangely determined. "Great," she said with a sarcastic undertone, "You want to talk about the weather, then?"
, then?" She asked, smirking suggestively. This was easy. Teasing around close to the surface. Playfully dipping in the tips of her toes… There was no need to dive into the deep waters. Not yet. Not
She inspected her fingernails in an unimpressed way. If she was going to keep herself from grinning, she couldn't look at him. His irritation was far too amusing.
Ginny sent him a look that could have killed. "Mum agrees with me. That's why she keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. She's a damn sight nicer than Phlegm. And she's intelligent. And at least she's a laugh."
"Enough with the flattery." I say, trying to will down the heat that's attempting to flow into my cheeks. I almost forgot how weirdly honest Draco tends to be in his dreams.
"Merlin, Potter, you're infuriating." There was an intense look in his eyes that seemed a little wild but he was smiling despite his words. The smile was reaching his eyes and Haley felt something flutter inside her stomach at the sight. She liked seeing him smile like this. Liked it a lot. And she liked kissing him. Maybe that was enough? His thumb stroked over her cheek gently before he leaned in to kiss her again. Softly… but with an underlying passion that made her think he had been wanting to kiss her all day. Haley closed her eyes and stopped to think. As two arms made their way around her waist and pulled her closer, her own arms came up to rest on the boy's shoulders almost on their own accord.
from outside the door made Sirius stop his tirade. Alarmed, they both turned toward the door. Sirius opened it but there was nothing to see. Nothing except a flash of pink that looked suspiciously like an extendable ear, which was vanishing beneath the stairs. Haley leaned over the railings and with a sinking feeling she recognized freckled skin, red-hair and a cheeky grin on a boy's face. One of the twins. In the darkness she couldn't make out who of the two it was.
"Hi Luna," she said leaning down so she could whisper in Luna's ear. The girl turned her head, seeming not surprised at all to suddenly find the Gryffindor at her table.
"Hm," George pondered, tapping his finger against his chin. "Would it be better if he finds out from you or through someone else? I think you know the answer to that." He replied. "Your real question is… how is he going to take it?"
"Oh." The broom closet wasn't a broom closet after all. It turned out to be a supply closet… for potions ingredients. Oh great. Hopefully Snape had all the ingredients he needed inside his office…
"You would do that?" He asks, his eyes shining. I nod. "Thanks Myron!" He smiles and the smile on his face is almost blinding.
His hand was wandering from her sleeve to the back of her hand, his fingers ghosting over her skin lightly. But he seemed hesitant to actually touch her.
"Look," she sighed. "there's no time. I'll explain later, okay?" She turned around, hoping he'd leave it at this. Of course, he didn't.
"Even if she found someone else who she wants to spend time with… that doesn't mean Haley abandoned you." Her blue eyes bored into his uncomfortably. "I'm sure, she still considers you as her friend and would like you to do the same."
Right. Haley summoned the last bits of courage she possessed and quietly sat down next to him, leaving a safe distance between them. She didn't know what she'd expected. Another explosion maybe? Like on the weekend in the tree house? But there was only silence instead. He didn't acknowledge her at all. Was he even awake?
There was nothing but seriousness in his eyes. "Yes. It's true." He answered quietly. "He's still alive."
Haley frowned. "Why would you change it because of me?" She asked. As a matter of fact, she did like his hair much better without the gel. (It made his features look softer and more... friendly somehow.) But she wasn't about to admit that out loud.
She was really trying to help him. Draco found that he appreciated that, although he wasn't sure he liked her ideas. Well, they were a hundred times better than anything Crabbe or Goyle would have come up with. He sighed, letting his forehead sink against his palm.
"Why'd you sleep up here? Is your own bed that uncomfortable?" The boy asked, lazily leaning against the wall. Gazing at his face made the revelations of the previous night return at full force. Did he really lose his magic? Had it been Neville who'd done it? She couldn't ask him. What if it was true?
He tried to hide but the witch had already noticed him. "Oh perfect. Mr Malfoy. Help me get this lying weasel to my office. He seems to think he's especially clever." She smiled sweetly, nodding toward the boy who was edged into a corner.
He walked ahead, carrying the basket in his right hand. Which was annoying because she was walking to his right… Didn't he want to… hold her hand? Was he being shy? Was he trying to annoy her on purpose?
"Yes. The stupid charm didn't work any way." He was still irked about that. Granger had used the same spell on those coins. Why couldn't he make it work?
Wow, this chapter was long. Well, now you know more about Neville's side of the story. I'm sure you've still got lots of questions but don't fret... I'll try to answer all of them in the next four chapters. (Because there will be probs 4 more chapters)
Mum will know. She will tell me what to do and help me find the right words. She'll know. She always does. She'll tell me what to do and then… then everything will be over. She'll probably tell me not to come here again… She'll tell me I can't go and visit Draco any more. Just like Hermione. But… I have to see him again. Just one last visit. To say goodbye. That should be okay… right?
Haley tried not to panic. "I'd better go!", she said hastily, pulling her head out of the flames. The feeling of disorientation left her slightly dizzy but after a few seconds she was able to make sense of her surroundings. Right. She was still in Umbridge's office. Hastily, she lunged for her Invisibility Cloak, throwing it halfway over herself when the door opened and a familiar person came into view. "Haley? What are you doing here?" Draco asked.
Without actively making the decision, Haley picked up a quill, dipped it into her inkwell and wrote two words.
for you?" The owl-turned-luckdragon asks with a grin. I have to admit that was kind of funny. This is serious, though. I have to keep that in mind. I bite my lips and nod in confirmation.
What was taking him this long? Usually, Draco was the one who always arrived at the willow first. But now it was her who was waiting for him stupidly. She sighed, leaning against the old willow. Had something happened? Maybe he had been held up somehow… Wait. Weren't those steps, she heard? Before she could turn around and check, she felt soft fingers covering her eyes.
"Help me! He's coming for me – he'll come – he'll come and take my soul…" Sirius called from inside the hour glass.
"Here, take mine. I sharpened them just now," Neville told her, before offering his pair of scissors to her.
"You knew about this?" Lupin asked Sirius. Her godfather only grunted. "Wow." To her surprise, Lupin chuckled amusedly. "Who would have thought… how long has this been going on?"
"No, no, no, that can't be. That can't-" Haley's throat began to tighten up. She looked up in search of one face in particular. Malfoy was packing up his things. The git had surely handed in his potion already. There was a disgustingly amused grin on his face that made Haley growl in anger. He wasn't even looking at her, which made it all the more evident. It had been him. All of it. She knew it. But she couldn't prove it.
Haley shook her head. "No," she interrupted him. "It's not a trick. He never asked for any information-"
"About what?" Potter inquired, her voice no more than a whisper. Draco closed his eyes again. He couldn't keep looking at her intense
Well, well, well. Was this kid actually a fangirl of her dad? And how was it her business when she happened to be late for practice every now and then?
Haley nodded. The school year was almost over after all. Of course, he'd find the idea strange. "She… well… the thing is… er…"
Hello hello! I know, this is terribly short but my original draft was so freakishly long that I had to cut it off somewhere. To make up for the short chapter I will post the next one within the next few days, so stay tuned for that :) And i can tell you that some things you guys have beeen waiting for are going to happen in the next chappy ;)
Draco rolled his eyes. "Don't be stupid, Sprout is helping Pomfrey in the Infirmary this evening." He opened the door and ushered her inside.
But who? It couldn't have been Draco… So… Madame Pomfrey maybe? Had she also relocated her to the bed?
Potter was biting her lips, watching him with a curious expression on her face. "But you looked so cute." She chuckled. Draco's heart skipped a beat. "For a moment."
. Not after everything that had happened before. And there was also something else. She was forgetting something. Or someone? But she couldn't remember what it was. She blamed it on her tiredness.
I clench my teeth, suppressing the urge to lash out at her. Even if her comments are annoying she is not the person I'm really angry at.
Hedwig scoffs. "I don't know. You tell me." I want to protest but the girl keeps talking. "All right then. If you say so. Good luck on your mission." She winks, sending me a mysterious smile, before turning around and leaving me to stare after her with my mouth gaping open.
Haley made a step toward her, looking straight into her eyes. "I remember our deal. But if I remember correctly, it's not broken yet. Not as long as Gryffindor doesn't lose." Her eyes narrowed. "And we will not lose."
would have been enough. Was it really that hard? He hadn't even asked her to confess her love or anything. He'd simply wanted her to tell him that he was somehow worth it. For her. For
Over Christmas, when she had opened her heart to him, it had been evident that she cared about that boy. So, it was better for her to get over this nonsense before her feelings got any deeper. What did she even see in that bastard? It was a mystery to him. Just as it had been with Lily and Snivelus. How could she have been friends with someone who was so busy with worshipping dark magic that he couldn't even be bothered to wash his hair? But Lily had seen the light in the end. And so would her daughter.
Back inside the wards, Harry packs up their tent with efficiency, all the while hanging onto Malfoy’s shoulder. They wards are down and they’re out of there in under twenty seconds. When they pop back into existence in the Forest of Dean, after an exhausting and painful chain of Apparitions, it’s the same spot he and Ron and Hermione had landed in that first time during the War.
Draco sits down on the sofa again and tucks his feet up beneath him, curling up against the cushions, and it’s warm and comfortable. The hoodie really is as cosy as it looks, and Draco can see why Potter practically lives in them when the weather allows for it. The fleecy lining is soft, and best of all, it smells like Potter. And Draco does feel vaguely guilty for it, because it’s weird, isn’t it, that he keeps tucking his nose to his shoulder and inhaling.
He only catches snatches of Zelda’s side of the conversation echoing up out of the Floo, and Draco’s French may be bad but he knows enough of it to catch a lot of
“You’re such an arsehole,” Harry said, and by now he was laughing, half in disbelief, half at Malfoy’s sheer fucking nerve. “I can’t believe you stole this. If I were any sort of Auror, I’d arrest you for it right now.”
Potter shrugs. “I was pretty drained from Apparating. Spells barely worked at all, didn’t have enough extra magic in ‘em to fuck with anything. Didn’t leave enough of a trail for anyone to track.”
In truth, his reasons for joining the Department of Magical Law Enforcement in the first place had been somewhat selfish. At the time he’d been desperate to balance the scales, as it were, and do something to make up for his actions during the war, and what better way than by joining the DMLE to finish dismantling the very organization he’d been part of? And it certainly didn’t hurt that members of the DMLE were respected more than ever before.
He goes through the rest of the questions, and her answers are all exceedingly satisfactory. But given her exemplary Potions scores, he expected nothing less. He goes over what he’d expect from her, and in the middle of him rattling off the shop’s hours, she looks like she wants to say something.
“Fuck off,” Harry calls back automatically. “If you’d just get rid of that old thing.” One of the corners curls up and Harry’s always catching his toe on it.
“I despise you,” Harry says. “I’ve always despised you. I should kill you just ‘cause of that, even if you’re not really a terrorist.”
All too soon, Harry found himself standing outside the shop, a narrow stone building with a high, peaked roof. The wooden sign reading Ashby’s Imports & Antiques in fading black script creaked quietly on its hinges where it hung above the heavy iron-banded oak door. The shop’s single display window held a pleasing display of what Harry assumed were antiques, but just looked like junk to him: a battered brass cauldron etched with runes, a collection of stirring rods fanned out before it, a cluster of empty glass bottles, a stack of leatherbound books, two crystal candy dishes, several candlesticks of varying height, and a broad silver tray holding a full china tea service painted with tiny periwinkles. The sign propped in the corner of the display window still read Closed, but the door opened only seconds after Harry knocked on it.
Draco closed his eyes, pressing in closer to Harper. He normally wasn’t much for post-sex cuddling, but fuck it. Everything about this situation wasn’t what he normally did. And Harper was warm and solid against him. And though he only meant to rest up for that promised round two, he slipped off to sleep between one breath and the next.
“I didn’t have a scarf and Potter was kind enough to lend me one,” Draco grits out. “Stop trying to read more into it than that.”
A Stunner comes lancing out of the darkness, and Draco barely gets up a Shield Charm in time. The Stunner deflects with a
“God, okay. Just give me a couple minutes,” Draco says. He lets his head fall back against the pillow.
Down in the kitchen, Draco discovers that Potter has stuck the pair of Quidditch tickets to the front of the refrigerator with a ridiculous hedgehog magnet. He’s obviously Transfigured it, and the thing’s got big staring eyes and a rather terrifying grin on its little hedgehoggy face. When he opens the refrigerator to get out the eggs, the notices that Potter’s put the tickets under a Glamour to change the writing on them. Apparently, he and Draco have plans to attend the 114th Annual Broomstick Enthusiasts Tradeshow.
Harry shrugs and tries to look casual, instead of hopelessly and helplessly smitten. “I don’t know, there are some advantages to being out here.”
Frowning, Ron exchanged a look with Hermione, then glanced quickly over his shoulder to make sure that Malfoy wasn’t back from the toilets yet even though he’d been gone less than twenty seconds. “You don’t sound nearly as excited about it as I thought you would.”
Harry hesitated, then turned on his heel and started back down the path. "Lock's giving us a bit of trouble," he said when he reached where Malfoy was waiting with the two Junior Aurors. "Mind giving us a hand with it?"
A protective charm keeps them dry while he showers, and then he slathers them with more Healing Salve and bandages them up again before he dresses for the day.
“I’d like to see you come up with something if it’s so easy, then,” Harry said, half-hoping that she actually would.
It was a sunny Saturday afternoon, and Harry had decided to try his luck at macarons. He’d heard they were tricky to make, but he’d been baking for over a year now, and lately he hadn’t even had any mishaps.
“What?” she asked, looking up at him. Her expression cleared once she caught sight of the look on his face. “Oh, you mean about how you were looking at Harry like you wanted to climb into his lap?”
“You’re right,” he tells her, drawing in an unsteady breath. He feels inexplicably bereft now that her mind is gone from his, and isn’t that strange? Then again, he’s never used Legilimency with anyone he’s actually liked before now. “That’s definitely a very old spell.”
“Mr Malfoy,” Celene corrected. “Call him by his surname alone at your own risk. And yes, that’d be Elisa. She’s mostly here at the weekends. She’s Muggleborn, and attending uni. Desmond and I switch off who’s here with her, to give the other one of us a bit of a break.”
“Hello, Parkinson,” Harry said, fingers tightening around his pint so that his fingerprints showed starkly white through the glass.
For now, Draco’s only half-hard, but getting bigger with every second that Harry toys with him, and a little shiver of pride zips up his spine.
that makes the floorboards vibrate, then kicks off his trainers, grabs the bag, and heads for the living room. Draco takes off his own shoes and puts them under the little table they’d stuck a vase on because they had no idea what else to do with it. He puts Potter’s trainers under there too, neatly lined up beside his own, then follows Potter into the living room.
Pansy forces a smile and changes the subject, talking on at length about her career. She writes a fashion column that’s published in the Friday edition of the
Draco makes his way through the shop to the back room and up the staircase to his flat, and the instant he closes the door at the top of the stairs behind him, he feels the tension he didn’t realise he’d been carrying in his shoulders drain away. Down there is work; up here is home.
He grunts and turns away from Malfoy, suddenly exhausted. “We should sleep. Need to be rested in case we have to move quick.”
A light tap on the doorway of their cubicle startled Draco from his thoughts. “You lads hungry?” Park asked, leaning halfway inside, one hand braced on the cubicle’s outer wall. A lock of hair had escaped her bun (she was growing out her fringe) and she pushed it out of her eyes.
“That was brilliant!” he says as he dismounts, pulling off the helmet. His ears pop as the charm Potter had put on it so they could talk to each other releases, and he can’t stop smiling because that was bloody fantastic, a thousand times more exhilarating than flying a broomstick, and the thrill hasn’t faded yet.
Draco couldn’t help his scowl at that. Park always kept a portion for herself and then brought most of it into the DMLE to get rid of it—
Harry groans. Malfoy has a thing for marking up Harry’s shoulders, particularly the backs of them. Covered up by his shirt, and not easily seen in a mirror, Malfoy once explained the appeal of it being for his eyes only. It’s weirdly possessive of Malfoy, given that they agreed that exclusivity wouldn’t be part of this friends-with-benefits thing.
But if Hermione would be there too, well. That’d make two people who’d help him out if he got into trouble, and Harry felt a little better for it.
of training. After seeing it once. While you were considerably distracted.” He swallows and takes Draco’s hand in his, lacing their fingers together. “That’s kind of really fucking hot.”
“I was feeling unwell,” Draco says, carefully scooping knotgrass onto his brass scales. “But I’m better now.”
Downstairs, Draco stepped out into the quiet evening, locked the door after himself, and started down Diagon. It was pleasant out tonight, a little warm for Draco’s tastes, but clear and cloudless with just a slight breeze. He passed a handful of other people before he reached the entrance to Knockturn.
“I need…” he says, soft and broken and desperate. His other hand twitches toward Draco in a small motion cut short. His fingers curl into a fist. “Can I?”
“You know,” he says, when the last one fades away. “There’s a belief that whatever you’re doing at midnight on New Year’s is what you’ll be doing for the rest of the year.”
He’s begun to relax a little, half-convinced that whatever curse had affected him has simply run its course. That still leaves the worrisome question of who might have cast it and why, but what can he do about that? He can’t go to the Aurors, he’ll have to tell them that someone died, and they’ll take one look at the Mark on his arm and lock him away. At the very least, there’ll be a record of his disappearance on a full moon, and even though testing will show that he’s not a werewolf, he still wants no part of that whole mess. The debate over what rights a werewolf should be allowed to have is still raging, and Draco plans to keep entirely out of it.
“I—” Draco grits out. His back itches, sharp and painful, and the urge to scratch at it is overwhelming. He hunches forward, and something in his back pops. He can’t, he can’t—He twists one arm up over his shoulder and claws at his skin, feels it tear open, something bristly poking up through the wound.
Try as he might, Draco couldn’t find a single thing to document what on earth Harper might have been up to during that time. No records of employment, no Portkey applications, not so much as a signed lease agreement. During that stretch of time, Peter Harper had disappeared so thoroughly that it was as if he didn’t even exist.
After that daring escape from the Dursleys’ back in Harry’s second year, Ron had pestered Fred and George into teaching him and Harry how to pick locks. It’s a skill that’s come in handy several times over the years. Most witches and wizards will take the time to ward against magical means of breaking in, from an
He leaves them to it, and goes back to where he’s left the Adder’s forks soaking in vinegar. He lights the flame beneath the cauldron and gets out the jar of crocodile hearts, fishes out two of them, and begins to slice them into neat slivers.
“Ginny, don’t provoke your brother,” Molly says distractedly, closing the oven door again and turning to the sink.
The last couple of months had been particularly difficult. Harry had been putting in hours with MLEP’s night shift, and when he went back to days, Draco was assigned nights on the Spell Damage floor. For weeks on end, the most time they spent together was one of them coming home very early in the morning and collapsing into bed to enjoy an hour or so of cuddling before the other had to get up to leave for work.
Well. He and Draco were going to break up in a little over a month. He’d let her enjoy it for now, and afterward maybe he’d get her to pick out someone new for him because honestly? Spending time with Draco was pretty great. Harry thought he might like to date someone like that for real.
Potter’s expression edges toward amused again. “We’ll just have to be very careful to avoid any and all rogue sprigs of springtime mistletoe.”
The robin flies off, and Draco finishes up in the kitchen, then gathers his things and gets his shoes on, and Potter scoops his keys from the bowl by the door and they leave the house.
Harry’s hand stilled, and Draco made a small sound of frustration and pushed his cock into Harry’s fist.
To his utter mortification, a loud round of applause and wolf-whistling broke out from behind him, and over it all, Seamus bellowed, “GET IT, HARRY!”
“I saw it parked outside,” she says, and damn her, she sounds even more smug. “Also, that’s his scarf you’re wearing. It’s cute, really, how you’re borrowing his things.”
Hermione snorted, and Harry whacked his rolling pin against the dough a few more times before he said, “That’s not funny.”
“It really is,” Draco insists. “For several reasons. One, if we’re meant to be a couple, we ought to be seen together in public at least a few times. Two, there are several things we need to discuss. And three… I really do owe you for everything you’re doing for me. Dinner is the least I can do.”
Draco’s friends had taken over three tables in the back corner of the pub. Millicent and Anthony sat at one with Blaise and… was that Susan Bones? Harry’d had no idea they were dating, either. Theo and Goyle sat at the second with Luna, and Harry relaxed a little more to see her here tonight. That meant Ginny would probably be along in a bit. Pansy sat at the third table all by herself.
He takes note of a scattering of items that don’t quite fit: a blue windbreaker tossed over the back of a chair, several backpacks, a pair of hiking boots sat near the side of one of the beds, a bright yellow umbrella propped in a corner.
The fastest way to get ahold of someone is by Patronus. He’s seen Potter send his stag galloping off a time or two with a message for Weasley.
Malfoy’s coat smells like tobacco, and it makes Harry’s brain go a little fuzzy. He used to mistake this feeling as a craving for a cigarette—he’d sort of picked up smoking as part of his short-lived rebellious phase just after leaving Hogwarts, but hadn’t actually enjoyed it enough to stick with it for long—before he eventually worked out that this was more of a craving for Malfoy himself.
Their assigned case that day was straightforward: an enchanted book had ended up in a Muggle bookshop, and Harry and Malfoy were to go to the shop, retrieve the book, and transport it safely back to the Ministry. Normally in a situation like this where an enchanted item ended up in the hands of a Muggle, a trained Obliviator would be deployed as well. But by sheer luck, this particular item had ended up in the hands of a Muggle whose cousin happened to be a Muggleborn witch, and he’d known to contact the Ministry straight away.
Malfoy crosses to the kitchenette and begins pawing through everything. Even from this distance, Harry can see he’s unimpressed with the offerings, but then again, when has Malfoy ever been impressed with anything that wasn’t his father?
Harry picked his head up and nudged at Malfoy so he could see his face. “You want to go again already?”
“That’s a bonus,” Harry says. He debates for a moment whether he can get away with giving said arse a pat, but decides against it. This case looks like it’s going to take longer than Harry thought it would, so he’s got to pace himself. “But mostly, if I’m going to be trapped in a cursed mansion, there’s no other wand I’d rather have at my back.”
Pansy’s gaze slides sideways. “Pots may have mentioned it the other day,” she admits. “The details of where and with whom you’d be working have been finalised for a week or so. We were talking about it on our last night out.”
“No,” Draco says. His heart is thudding against his ribs as he rounds the bed to the nightstand on his side of it, opens the top drawer, and takes out the book he’d stashed there two days ago. He opens it to the page he’d marked, and takes a deep breath. He’d planned out all sorts of things to say, but all that comes out of his mouth as he thrusts the book at Potter is, “What about this one?”
“But,” Draco looks down at it. “I thought we agreed that we weren’t going to keep anything obviously wizarding in the house.”
The door closes behind her. Draco lets the smile slip off his face, and lays his head down on his worktable.
“Entirely by accident,” Harry said, more than a little distracted by the sight of Draco Malfoy, pink-cheeked and shaking with mirth. “I’m sure if I tried to do it on purpose, I’d never be able to do it again.”
She took it and spooned sugar into her own mug, then slid it back to him. “Are you taking requests?”
“No, but thanks,” Harry said. “I really don’t think I’ll need it.” He paused, sighed. “Honestly, I think this is a waste of time to search again. But it’s another box to tick off the list.”
“I’m taking my lunch,” Zelda announces an hour later, slipping through the door and shutting it firmly behind her.
“And by the time they get through my wards, we’ll be long gone.” He looks from Potter to Draco. “And you’ll both be dead. It’s rather a shame. Personally, I do like both of you. But I can’t have you giving me away. You especially, Draco Malfoy,” Clarke sighs. “I had so dearly hoped you’d chosen to follow in your father’s footsteps. You’ve quite a mind. I could have used you.”
But that was the job sometimes, so Harry watched and waited, a Shield Charm on the tip of his tongue. He didn't know whether it would help, but without knowing the exact curse to counter, it'd be the best he could do if he was quick enough to fire it off.
Now it’s growing late and the pub is steadily emptying, and Draco’s edging more towards maudlin than he’d like. The easy chatter and gentle teasing and bright laughter of his companions had started out warm and enjoyable, but as suddenly as flipping a switch when Draco reached a certain level of drunkenness, the good cheer of everyone began to grate on him. Each laugh at an inside joke, every reference to an event he wasn’t here for, each time anyone carried on with a conversation he didn’t have the frame of reference to participate in, all of it only served to remind Draco of what an outsider he is. He’s made progress with Potter and Weasley, and Pansy’s always been his friend, but the rest…
The camera flashes, and Draco puts his head up and smiles again, and the camera flashes a second time, and then a third.
“Oh, no. I mean, I can,” she says, still a bit off-balance. Clearly she wasn’t expecting him to hire her outright, which is fair enough since Draco wasn’t expecting to do it, either. She sucks in a breath and sticks out her hand. “I’ll be here. Thank you very much, Mr Malfoy.”
The pub was warm and a bit stuffy, and they’d only just sat down when Harry fidgeted around, pulling his arms out of the sleeves of his hoodie, then dragging the thing over his head, and Draco gritted his teeth against the temptation to tell Harry to put it right back on.
“Here, take Victoire.” Bill pushes her into Weasley’s hands before he goes into the kitchen, and Weasley passes her to Ginny, who passes her to Potter, who breaks into an exaggeratedly-happy grin, and laughs delightedly when the baby copies his expression.
Sighing, she hands over the jar. Draco takes it, and if his fingers tremble as he measures out a spoonful, she’s kind enough to refrain from commenting. He stirs it in and watches as his potion lightens from a deep beige to a delicate eggshell white. Perfect.
Draco nods. That’s how they’d done it back in New York. He’d instruct the trainees on the uses of his devices, then pass them along to the Stealth instructor where the students would put the devices to use in training simulations.
“For the last time,” he sighs. “I don’t feel that way about him. And he certainly doesn’t feel that way about me.”
“Well, see, I was thinking,” Potter says. “We came up with all of our contingency plans, right? And so it makes sense to keep them somewhere accessible, in case we need them. And where’s better to hide them than in plain sight? In fact, I’m going to charm all of these,” He sweeps a hand at the towering stacks of curse books, “to look Muggle and stick them right in the library upstairs. But these,” He taps the two Muggle books, “Are going to stay right down here on the coffee table.”
!” the man shouted. The twisted remains of the register slammed into the ceiling, sending a shower of Sickles, Galleons, and Knuts raining down in a clatter. Draco curled up, covering his head as they pelted down over him. An instant later, the register smashed down into the counter in a spray of broken glass and glittering baubles. It’d missed Draco by only a couple of feet.
Wind howls behind him, lashing rain against the window like a flung handful of gravel, and another flash of lightning turns Malfoy pale as a ghost. The crash of thunder reverberates through Harry’s chest, momentarily drowning out his pounding heart.
Draco tells her, and she motions to a row of uncomfortable-looking chairs in the corner, along with a small table and a stack of battered magazines, and invites him to wait there. Draco goes over and settles on the chair closest to the desk while the reception witch disappears off into the labyrinth of  cubicles. The seat is every bit as uncomfortable as it looks, the seat cushion lumpy, and if Draco’s posture were worse, he bets that the wooden slats comprising the back of the chair would dig painfully into his spine. He allows himself to slouch, curious, and oh yes, he was right. It’s quite horrible. He straightens up again and looks around idly as he waits.
“Oh,” Harry said, frowning. Because he’d half-expected to be kicked out as soon as Malfoy had had his fill of him. But this sounded an awful lot like Malfoy had just invited him to spend the night. And he didn’t know what to make of that.
“But it wouldn’t surprise me,” Ron said. “Lucius regularly threw gold around to get his way. Wouldn’t surprise me at all to find Draco Malfoy following right along in dear old Dad’s footsteps.”
Draco sets the lacewing flies down. Even if he starts right this minute, he won’t have enough time to brew Polyjuice Potion. The lacewing flies need to stew for a full twenty-one days before he can begin, and he doesn’t keep any on hand. Polyjuice Potion is on the Ministry’s list of Restricted Potions, so he only fills the occasional order for it. And resents having to do so, based on the amount of paperwork that’s required for the sale.
Potter’s arranged for the three of them to attend a Quidditch match today. None of the national teams have a game until January, but two of the local teams are playing this afternoon. According to Potter, Teddy’s about as Quidditch-obsessed as they come. He’s more than happy to watch anyone play.
He wakes up early the following morning feeling tired, but in far less pain. His skin has almost fully healed, and the slight bruising that’s left is easily covered by a light Glamour. He rushes through breakfast, and leaves a note for Zelda on the front counter that he’s stepped out for a bit. Then he takes the Floo to St Mungo’s where Draco’s seen to by a Mediwitch who gives him a small dose of Skele-Gro to help the bone heal, then sets his pinky and splints it to his ring finger with a strong Sticking Charm. She gives him strict instructions to not remove the spell for a full 48 hours, and a second dose of Skele-Gro he’s supposed to take in twelve hours.
“Obviously I didn’t if I just said I was surprised,” Katie tells him lightly, then smiles and says to Potter, “I’m Katie.”
He’s just drying his hands when the door opens and he starts, thinks for one wild moment that this is another nightmare when he looks up to see Potter standing in the doorway, blood spreading across the tiles, cold water, Myrtle screaming—
Draco nods and cups his hands around the mug of tea, letting the warmth seep into his fingers and palms. “All right. Well, let’s start off with the one that’s most likely to occur. What happens if I die?”
The afternoon passes slowly. Potter watches a football match on the telly, and Draco dozes beside him. Potter wakes him up for dinner, and then it’s time for bed.
“Ready to be done,” Harry said, groaning. He was back on the yellow-green pages, and he pushed them away. “I’m fine with calling it here.” He slid his fingers up behind his glasses and rubbed wearily. “Fuck, my eyes.”
“Not badly,” Harry said, leaning away from Draco to spit more blue-tinged saliva onto the floor. He grimaced, coughed, and spat again. “Ugh. No, the cauldron missed me, thank Merlin. Minor burns, it feels like. I think I swallowed some of it. Got it up my nose and in my eyes, too.”
“Just… a friend,” Harper sighed, slouching over the counter. “He’s worried about me and I was tired and hungover and… shit, I think I owe him a really big apology, because in his place I probably would’ve reacted the exact same way he did.”
. But that small part of him is drowned out by the shrieking terror, and Draco screams and screams and screams.
Draco gave him a long look that Harry couldn’t describe as anything other than a leer. “Are you saying you’re not?”
Draco was now an expert at answering all manners of phone. The ringing sound resumed, and Draco picked up the phone—properly this time.
Draco sat heavily back into his seat. Never had he felt so far away from home as he did in this moment. Here he was, on the other side of the planet, far from anyone who could understand or even care. He needed Harry. Harry wouldn’t fully understand the depths of this loss, but he would at least be sympathetic. Merlin, how he missed Harry.
In the Untucked Lounge, Draco quietly kept to herself while the other safe queens discussed who was likely going to be in the bottom. Now that she was safe, Draco’s mind reeled back to the pending court case before the Wizengamot and Kali’s attempt to get her to use magic to help her with her costume.
“In this challenge, we are each portraying famous women from the 1990s, and I’m assigned the part of Cher
“Hello there, Sweetheart,” Harry greeted, pecking him on the cheek while Draco scribbled down a note about the functionality of lip liner. “You’re really into this, aren’t you?”
Draco cautiously approached him and Paris hugged him gently. “Honey, I love you, but this is an intervention. I’m afraid you have an eating disorder.” Draco gave him a confused look.
Potter then had the audacity to laugh. “What, didn’t you read about it in the papers? We got a divorce.”
She lifted it to her lips, careful not to get any of Ivana’s lipstick on her own, and inhaled a tiny amount. The hot smoke seared her throat and instantly took her back to the Room of Requirement. She closed her eyes and couldn’t help but see Fiendfyre all around her and heard Crabbe’s cries of anguish as he was swallowed by the flames.
Harry quickly grabbed the quill and stood up. “Malfoy,” he nodded back. “Nice snitches you have on your socks.” Malfoy frowned.
She held a large bottle of aloe in one hand and pantomimed rubbing some of it onto her shoulder, wincing as she did so.
Another confession: I was watching Drag Race UK’s Snatch Game episode thinking, “Nobody play Mary Berry. Nobody play Mary Berry…”
“Girl, you’ll be fine,” Venus said, re-shaping a wide-brimmed red fedora that must have flattened slightly in his suitcase.
“Condragulations, ladies,” RuPaul said after Carmelita’s teary goodbye. “And remember, if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else? Can I get an amen up in here?”
Paprikah raised an eyebrow. “You might be surprised,” she said, and turned the new mic on before zipping Draco back into her dress.
Of the four looks, Acacia had the most elaborate, modeling a completely beaded turquoise gown and scintillating rhinestone crown. Goldie had created a more anime-oriented take on the statue, painting her face with comically large eyes and wearing a costume sculpted out of papier-maché. Intoxia’s and Steve’s outfits looked less impressive by comparison. Steve’s in particular looked like a roughly hewn poncho.
The lip sync song for this week is “Pump up the Jam” by Technotronic. This episode’s special guest judge, Ya Kid K, is the lead singer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EcjWd-O4jI
There was a lot that Draco still didn’t know about what Potter and his friends did during the war. He had only a vague knowledge that the Dark Lord had protected a series of artefacts. Were those actually
“Even though she already knew that much, since I’d given her a huge thank-you bouquet of flowers after you first found it.”
Draco stopped halfway across the set and shook her head. She had to remind herself that she wasn’t in the Room of Requirement, and they weren’t all about to die. This was a muggle studio, albeit one with surprise bursts of fire for some frightening reason.
“All right, we’ll try to keep this short. But first, I think the question on everyone’s mind is, where have you been? Everyone’s been looking for you!”
This was not destined to last long, unfortunately. A production assistant came a few minutes later to take the spider off set.
I hope folks weren’t too disappointed in the Rusical! It was definitely a challenge for me to write, and after a lot of writing everything BUT the Rusical number, I ended up putting a lot of movie quotes in a blender and trying to shape the resulting mush into something resembling a narrative. This chapter kept getting to be so “extra” about so many other things, so the number itself took a bit of a hit creative-wise. But I’m already working on Snatch Game, so hopefully that will turn out a little more cohesive than this one. If anyone is interested, here are the parts picked out for the ‘80s team, which I didn’t really cover:
Potter smiled at her before turning back to Draco. Draco would have apparated away on the spot if it weren’t for the shop’s pesky anti-apparition ward. Shoplifters and embarrassed wizards be damned.
After the war, Aunt Aura had gained her own ghostly companion in the form of Charity Burbage. Draco had been shocked to see the former Muggle Studies professor come back to haunt Malfoy Manor, but she herself kept a strange sense of humor about the whole thing. Many times Draco caught the two ghosts hovering over a tea set, gossiping and laughing together, then quieting immediately after noticing him.
, one of my favourite books when I was a kid. It’s about how Aethelwynne is brought to life and becomes a wartime spy. This specific look is from Chapter 13, after Aethelwynne gets knocked off her shelf by a cat. She breaks her face and arm and has a disjointed walk, which is truly horrifying, but she lives through it and survives the war.”
Back in the werkroom, Draco pondered how he should assign the lineup of queens in the stand-up show. He hadn’t been fully kidding when he asked about Shangela. He remembered how she had had a strategic approach to a similar challenge on her season, combined with a cunning analysis of her competitors’ strengths and weaknesses as performers. If any queen on
The magician held up a matchbook and stared intently at it. He waved his other hand, and suddenly the matchbook burst into flames.
“I don’t want to go home!” Intoxia cried. “I’ve just got to turn. This. Out.” He snapped his fingers.
“Now, in addition to performing professional illusions, you’ll need to come up with a name for your magic act, write captivating dialogue, and create a magical look — using makeup provided by Salmon Buffet.”
Lady Cakes looked at Draco over the notebook and raised her eyebrows. Draco made a noncommittal gesture. It seemed like a perfectly valid question. For all she knew, muggles had some way to see noises in different colors. Maybe it was a privilege to see white noise.
muggle vehicles moving around them, and they were all careening faster than Draco had ever traveled on a broom, sometimes swerving around each other.
“My girl Acacia is giving this lip sync everything she’s got — she’s doing death drops, cartwheels, armography, you name it,” Paris said. “But I don’t know if she gets that that isn’t what this song is about.”
“Right, that means something else to you Brits, huh?” Lady Cakes laughed. “For what it’s worth, your Stonehenge look was stunning.” She nodded towards the corner where Draco had stashed her henge.
“Oh my God, who are you and what have you done with Draco?” Venus laughed. “This queen is acting goofy as hell! I have never seen her laugh so much. It’s like she’s never seen a magic trick before in her life.”
Draco felt proud of this runway look and reveal. So far in the competition, she had been struggling to keep up with the others. But for the first time, she felt like she was really
Granger-Weasley ended her conversation with Anthony Goldstein and walked over to join them. “What is it, Harry? Oh, hello, Malfoy. How are you?” She gave him a mellow, polite smile and sipped her freezing niffler.
Kali answered with the world’s crunchiest cockney accent. “Thank you, RuPaul, I think I must be in the Great Place, because it’s great to be here!”
“I’ve been pretty lucky," Ivana replied. “My dad and sisters know I do drag, and they’ve been okay with it. They’d still rather I did something more lucrative with my life, but they don’t, like, throw Bibles at me every time I see them. I’m taking that as a win.”
“So…” Paris continued as she glued down her eyebrows, “What’s the family situation like for the rest of you?”
“Now,” RuPaul continued, “You will each have thirty minutes to make over your partner’s face. We’ve blacked out the mirrors to keep it a surprise,” he explained. “The queen who paints the best face wins. We’ll start with the queen on the left painting the queen on the right, and then switch. On your mark, get set,
Draco picked up a tiny, postage-stamp-sized Union Jack that he had cut out of the Australian flag. “I kept the relevant part.”
I was an athlete?!” Ron Weasley broke the tension by crying out dramatically from across the table they were sitting at. “I inspire your bloody badges
“Look, it’s not as though I’ve needed to know the exact numbers before! When I need money, I just go in and fill a bag.”
“I’m shook,” Kali admitted. “I’m not proud of the way I behaved in that last challenge. I know I’m gonna have to do better this next time around.”
When it was her turn, Draco grabbed a saucepan and placed it on the stove before Acacia turned to the camera.
”Dear Americans,” Venus began, speaking slowly and carefully. “My name is Venus Flygirl and I am running for President of the United States. I represent the drag community of Los Angeles, and if elected, I will make our country better by—”
“You will have thirty minutes to get into quick drag and decorate your nails. When it’s your turn, you will be given a piece of fruit to model for the camera. And...GO!”
Later that morning, the queens reentered the werkroom, ready for the next challenge. Draco had chosen to wear a blousy black poet’s shirt tucked into black skinny jeans and black riding boots. Intoxia said he was serving “The Dread Pirate Roberts” on the ride to the studio, though Draco hadn’t understood the reference. He walked over to his station and taped up Teddy’s picture.
At that moment, Harry reentered the dressing room with a bottle of champagne and a tray with four flutes levitating behind him. “The bartender said you could just have the whole bottle, so
Draco shuffled her feet. “Don’t—” she whined, “Bugger me in the arse! Whoa-whoa-whoa!” She spun around and shook her booty. “Unless you got, whoa-whoa-whoa…” She turned to look over her shoulder with her most flirtatious smile. “Twenty quid!”
Draco rolled his eyes. He had involuntarily seen her reenactment several times already and it wasn’t pretty. Crabbe, however, grinned and nodded. “See you, Draco — and Draco’s son,” he said, and followed the other two down the hallway in the direction of the staircase.
With that, she stamped something on a wizarding page of his passport, picked up a second stamp and stamped something else on a muggle page, then handed it back to him.
Several groans filled the air as the queens gathered together and rehearsed their choreography again.
“My legendary children, a Drag Race superstar needs to develop a pretty thick skin. So, in the grand tradition of
“That’s right, Acacia! Anyone can make this at home! First, you’ll need to bring twelve centilitres of water to a boil.” She poured a pre-measured amount of water into the saucepan, then picked up a cutting board. The studio didn’t have the ingredients needed to make a real hangover potion, but she could pretend.
“Your mother has given her permission for you to use her maiden name as your surname,” Simmons explained. “From now on, you may identify yourself to others as Draco Black.”
Malfoy’s face turned a shade of pink that Harry hadn’t seen since their Hogwarts days. His nostrils flared slightly.
“Oh, would you look at that?” RuPaul asked. “Our time’s up. And that means that our winner is...who cares?! This is RuPaul, reminding you to stop, drop, and roll. Thanks for watching! Say goodbye, stars!”
One by one, Mesmer Jones taught each queen a “magic trick.” Draco stifled a giggle when the magician showed Paris how to make flowers appear out of a plastic wand. He pursed his lips together and hugged himself, struggling against more giggles as Lady Cakes learned how to make a coin appear and disappear. When Goldie worked on magically hiding a salami, the giggles could no longer be contained. Draco covered his mouth, his shoulders shaking, his face turning bright pink. The other queens shot him quizzical looks.
” while the queens jumped back and forth, letting out high-pitched squeals and swooning dramatically when they were hit. No one appeared to be seriously hurt because the balls were so soft, so it became a contest to see which losing queen could get the most laughs for her failure.
One by one, each queen received judgment for their performances in the debate as well as their pinup looks. Goldie and Lorena were both harshly criticized for not being better prepared during the challenge, but praised for their runway looks. Venus fared slightly better, dinged only for running out of time in her opening statement. Lady Cakes was criticized for wearing a corset over a plain swimsuit, but the judges otherwise loved her performance. Paris and Kali both received only praise.
“Hi Draco,” Herb Kong, Heather Villareal’s replacement auror watchdog greeted. He was dressed as a production assistant. He winked and gestured toward another man and a woman standing next to him. “This is Basil and Paprikah. I’ve brought them in as backup today.”
“Two queens stand before me,” RuPaul said. “Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life! Now, good luck, and don’t fuck it up!”
on the dining table. He’d never had the courage to explain to his son why they should never eat at that table, and it always unnerved him to see his son use it for that purpose.
He grabbed Harry’s wrists and bent him over the edge of his desk, the sound muffled by the little water fountain in the corner. In one swift, adept move, he yanked down Harry’s trousers and pressed against him from behind.
“I was definitely getting a Sharon Needles vibe the way you were talking about potions and cauldrons,” Special Guest Judge Snoop Dogg added. “It would have helped if you dressed the part and made a total witch of yourself, though.”
Millicent cried as Harry started to leave, “Oi, Potter, let’s have another of your cheese puffs before you give them all away to the masses!”
chair. And you’re one to talk. Are you still making and selling potions ingredients for a living? How does your dear old dad feel about you being a farmer?”
Draco considered Steve appraisingly. In some ways, the queen was like a much prettier, effeminate version of Crabbe or Goyle. Neither of them had ever been terribly intelligent, and they were aware of it. One of the reasons why they had put up with so much from Draco over the years was because he had helped them work around their limitations and find other ways to succeed at what they wanted.
He had always been a Malfoy. He had been a Malfoy when the name commanded respect in the wizarding community. He had been a Malfoy after the war, when the name inspired hatred among those same people who had previously respected it. Even after being disowned, he had felt entitled to use the name. How could he identify as anyone else?
Harry acknowledged Draco’s apprehension with a nod and automatically slid into Heroic Saviour Mode. He picked up Draco’s phone and held it out to Draco. “Give me your finger so I can unlock it.”
Draco mouthed these first words with a soft, wistful expression on her face as she straightened her back.
Knees still a little shaky, he stepped down and to the right, following her direction. Traveling by portkey halfway across the planet had been rough, but a minute of discomfort still beat the twelve-hour horror he was sure he would have experienced if he had used the muggle plane ticket offered by the World of Wonder company. The price of a round-trip portkey ticket — and the added fee to alter the muggle records to make it appear that he
Intoxia raised an eyebrow. “Girl. How are you gonna find a way to make Beyoncé funny? Everyone who’s done Beyoncé on this show has fucked it up!”
Besides, he didn’t have the attention span for grudges when he was still preoccupied with his hearing before the Wizengamot.
,” she declared, circling around him with an eye toward appraisal. “Really, now! You should have died when you were sixteen. You were so pretty then.”
a natural blond...for now. Your hairline looks like it’s grown an inch higher since we started filming.”
“Cindy Sanchez, Paris Davenport, and Acacia Davenport, you will advertise RuPowder, my new brand of finishing powder fit for a queen.” The trio contemplated the jar of powder on the tray.
“I hear things,” Professor Burbage answered cryptically. She grinned. “You don’t remember that it happened right outside my office, do you?”
“Hello, Draco,” Narcissa called. “I just want you to know that in spite of everything that has happened, you are still my son, you will
accounts and I should bring in my phone, but I’m not sure I understand what that means.” He flashed her a sheepish grin.
Goyle looked at Draco. “I think I’ll head down, too. Will you two be alright in this room?” he looked around. “I don’t know how safe it is.” With that, he placed the rubber-chicken-turned-candle onto the table.
“Welcome, candidates! Tonight, your answers will be timed. The yellow light—” the camera focused on three colored lights off to one side of the stage— “is a ten-second warning. The red light means your time is up. If you go over, the Secret Service is here to escort you from the building.” The camera showed two Pit Crew members wearing briefs and black sunglasses.
“And I can’t tell you how many sacrifices I made,” he continued, voice wavering slightly before he caught himself. “In the end, I was just a little too...
Goyle squeezed. The chicken let out the most pathetic scream he had ever heard. It would have been funny if it weren’t so bloody ridiculous. Weasley actually guffawed, hooligan that he was.
“Now, ladies,” RuPaul continued after the judging ended. “Tonight, I’m going to have to send somebody home. Who should it be, and why?”
“I thought you brought a funny angle to the debate, but you tripped up when you were asked about the middle class,” Ross Matthews commented.
Still a bit shaky but immensely relieved, Draco joined the other queens in dancing on the runway to one of RuPaul’s latest singles (now available on iTunes).
“This isn’t just about a simple drag performance.” Granger had put the red dress back on the rack and placed her hand on her hip. “This is about female representation. This is about
The magician held up a matchbook and stared intently at it. He waved his other hand, and suddenly the matchbook burst into flames.
“I was really confused,” Snoop Dogg said. “When she showed up in that outfit I was expecting some type of period performance, but then she was serving this kind of ‘fantasy witch meets drunk culture’ vibe with her hangover potion and made-up ingredients. And then she got a little slutty about it towards the end.”
“Yeah, they don’t lie when they say it’s more addictive than crack,” Ivana blew out a puff of smoke and smiled sardonically.
“Welcome back, Ladies! I’ve made some decisions,” RuPaul began. “Venus Flygirl, Draco, and Lady Cakes McMansion: the three of you flew to new heights in this competition, but one of you really took the cake.” The three queens looked at each other.
The time finally came for the queens to get into drag and line up for their runway presentations. Draco took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and stepped onto the stage.
Draco hadn’t realized just how much time the safe queens had to kill in the lounge during judging. Venus, Intoxia, and Acacia stepped out for a smoke break while Draco took notes from Lady Cakes. It had been a bit embarrassing, but her curiosity won out.
The sound of a whip cracked deafeningly through the room. Harry looked up to see Malfoy, shirtless, dressed only in tight black leather pants and gleaming black patent boots. Harry would have gaped, were it not for the ball gag in his mouth. He struggled uselessly against the handcuffs on his wrists.
“Well,” she began. “This is my take on a Doric chiton, which is what women in ancient Greece would have worn instead of a toga. But I’ve made it a bit more couture with the halter strap and the, erm…”
“Now the gloves are off, I see,” Goyle scowled, pointing the candle at Crabbe. “You’re just lashing out because you’re disappointed the spell didn’t work.”
Draco coughed and sputtered inelegantly. She handed the cigarette back to Ivana. “Thanks,” she managed to rasp out.
“Kali Sister,” RuPaul continued, “Tonight, you exceeded all our expectations and slaughtered the audience. Condragulations, you are the winner of this week’s challenge.”
It wasn’t until he reached his old Charms classroom when Draco realized that not only had he fled a loo by saying he needed to use one — he paused at this epiphany to gently beat his head against the stone wall of the corridor — but he had also ruined an opportunity to ask Potter for his assistance in the ritual that would help Crabbe move on. He banged his head a little harder at that thought.
Dave chuckled. “You probably call it something other than a seatbelt over there, right? Kind of like how a trunk is a boot, and an eraser is a condom,” he mused. Draco had absolutely no idea what he was talking about. “What
!” Draco was baffled. “They can’t just fix your wrists now? How in Ru’s name are you supposed to compete in the next challenge?”
Carmelita giggled. “Do you think she’s trying to set that bear on fire with her mind?” They weren’t speaking loudly, but it was loud enough for Draco to look up and glance in their direction. Carmelita and Lorena quickly looked back down at Lorena’s sewing.
“She done closed the library!” RuPaul cried as Draco handed back the sunglasses and skipped playfully back to his place in the lineup.
RuPaul cackled. “Ooh, look out, I think we got a shady bitch up in here!” A few queens chuckled nervously.
Draco shrugged and looked at the other two. “Maybe he has more confidence in his ability to make Lorena disappear at the end of the challenge.”
Draco raised her hands to her face and appeared to claw at her eyes. She swiped them down her face, dragging her fingertips through her eye makeup until they smeared down her cheeks.
Draco put the finishing touches on her costume in the green room behind the Bent Unicorn’s stage area, fixing a ruffled pink hat to her short brown wig. She had begun doing more of her prep work onsite rather than back at Number 12 Grimmauld Place, much to Teddy’s dismay. She had other practical considerations for avoiding being seen in this particular costume prior to taking the stage to introduce the episode.
“Probably due to the hundreds of drawings of naked women. In any case, muggles have been studying it for a long time, but they still don’t know it’s about magic.”
Two queens stand before me,” RuPaul said. “Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life. Good luck, and don’t fuck it up!”
“Steve Donovan, Intoxia Madison, you’re both safe. You may join the other girls.” They both thanked RuPaul and went to the back.
take one for the team. I will take it for the gays marching in Pride Parades. For our gays across the country who quietly work together to make the world a better place. And yes, even for the closet cases in Washington. For
“Bored with the afterlife,” the spectre clarified. “I talked it over with Greg again, and he said that you’d been thinking about death a lot since your wife died and all—”
“Each queen gets a special gift box from a Secret Santa. It’s like Christmas!” RuPaul exclaimed excitedly. “Your task for the first main challenge is to create a one-of-a-kind, haute couture runway look using the gifts from your Secret Santa. You may use your own wigs, shoes, and jewelry,” he added.
Draco spun in place for a few more moments before falling to her knees in front of the judges, holding up the henge at eye level so her face beamed at them from a stone archway.
“As of today? Almost three months.” She had kept herself in full-time training ever since she began preparing for her audition, then doubled her efforts after she learned of her acceptance on the show.
Draco calmly removed the envelope from the owl and scritched its head. The owl hooted and took off in the direction from whence it came. Draco ignored Steve’s and Ivana’s looks of shock as she opened the envelope and read its contents. It bore the seal of the Ministry of Magic.
“Here you go, Draco,” the manager said at the end of the night as he handed her a small bag of galleons as a booking fee. “I dare say this turned out great for business! Same time next week, yeah?” Draco agreed, not having anything else on his calendar until the
anything,” Draco retorted distastefully. “Think of it like lighting a candle and then blowing it out right away.”
Kali shook his head. “I can entertain a crowd for maybe a minute at a time between sets at a drag show, but this is a whole ‘nother thing. I’ve never just talked and talked on stage like that before. How about you?”
Cindy had been one of half a dozen Leos on the runway. Too many Leos in a showboating competition was destined to cause irritation and bitterness for everyone involved.
cakes.” Lady Cakes gestured to her naturally bountiful bosom and buttocks. Draco looked at her and dropped her jaw, sliding a puzzle piece into a mental jigsaw puzzle.
Thanks again for reading and staying with this fic despite the sporadic updates! Whatever your situation, I hope you are well and staying healthy and sane. I appreciate all your comments and kudos!
“Aww, Carmelita,” Venus Flygirl sighed as she saw the other queen’s farewell message in lipstick on the mirror, which simply read “
The queens marched backstage and joined the others. Draco grabbed a cocktail and propped herself onto a stool, careful not to muss her slag flag.
“All right, ladies,” RuPaul addressed the workroom at large. “Remember — these are tough times, and the future of this great nation depends on you.”
Draco dropped his jaw in shock and turned to Crabbe for defense, but Crabbe didn’t look sympathetic as much as confused.
“You’ve never had a sprain before, have you? It’s not like you can just take a pill and you’re cured. You gotta just not use those joints and wait it out until they heal.”
“Anthony says that most of the eighth-year Ravenclaws will be there, and Ron says the Gryffindors will be, too. I haven’t haunted any of the Hufflepuffs, but I bet they’re going as well.”
“Creativity wasn’t a formal part of my education,” Draco admitted. “But I found ways to express myself by writing songs and designing fashion accessories. I was particularly proud of my badges.”
Draco grabbed his quill and notepad and began frantically jotting down notes. A production assistant came in and called them all away to Craft Services for dinner; Draco stayed behind, a growing pile of notepapers cluttering the area around him on the table. By the time everyone else returned, he had their entire magic skit storyboarded.
got a large sack,” he flirted. The man gave a suggestive smirk. RuPaul leaned forward and pulled a large ball out of the bag.
“I wouldn’t. He’s working on speed this round. He won’t be ready to interact with a camera crew until at least next week.” Draco steered them back out of the room.
!” He affected a serious expression and pointed his wand in the air as if he were about to take someone out. “What do you think? Close enough resemblance?”
Malfoy always did have the most elegant fingers, which were now sliding along the sheet of parchment as he read and analyzed the numbers it contained. Harry couldn’t help silently appreciating them.
Maybe he should have seen this coming. Lucius was not the type to sit back and let Draco take revenge for his disownment by making the Malfoy name famous as a drag queen. Eldritch Clearwater was the Malfoy family lawyer, the same one who had managed to keep Lucius out of Azkaban after the war. He was
Draco turned back to the — still unfairly handsome — Chosen One. “I haven’t made up my mind,” he said.
Malfoy smirked. “That’s the financial advantage of hiring a Certified Accountant of the Wizarding World, Junior Class,” he explained. “When I reach Woodletter’s level of seniority, I could charge you that amount for merely stepping into my office.”
Millicent beamed. She went up to the vanity and pulled out her wand. Over the course of a minute, she transfigured the shape of her face, turned her eyes green, and added a faint five o’clock shadow.
“I’m not saying you don’t deserve to be here,” Lorena told Steve as she waved her hand with a bored look on her face, gaslighting over what she had said just a few seconds previously.
“Aww, that’s so cool! I’ve always wanted to go to England! Oh wait, you call it the UK now, don’t you?”
“Good morning!” Goldie, Kali, and Venus sang as they skipped into the workroom, the others following. Draco wore his cropped midnight blue T-shirt revealing his name and constellation, along with grey trousers, silver suspenders, and a blue straw boater hat.
“I suppose you were too much of a hero for her?” Draco had tried for snide, but as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wanted to bang his head against the wall.
“Too bad it couldn’t help you make a better outfit for this challenge!” Intoxia shot back. Several queens laughed.
“Ha! He hated the rest of us, but he was always fascinated with you. Barely had time for anyone else in Slytherin.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Harry answered. “All that time, you had been growing on me. If it weren’t your feet, it would have been something else to push us together.”
“That was sweet, what your mom said.” Lady Cakes McMansion took collapsed on the sofa with a heavy sigh. “Girl, I thought you were gonna jump out of your skin when you saw that video.”
The edge of Steve’s lip quirked up slightly at that. She still looked defeated, so Draco wracked her brain for something else to say. Her eyes landed on Ursa Minor, perched on her shelf, still wearing a miniature safari outfit and pith helmet.
Carmelita and Intoxia also took hits for their performances. Carmelita especially fared poorly because she was considered too effeminate for her character. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the judges loved Lady Cakes’ performance, but weren’t wowed by the look of her giant green caftan and lumpy, black leather fingerless gloves. Kali Sister’s only crime seemed to be that she wasn’t as memorable as the others.
“Welcome, Ladies!” RuPaul addressed the queens after everyone had completed their runway presentation. “When I call your name, please step forward. Goldie Hanako, Steve Donovan, Paris Davenport.”
Harry smiled and shrugged. “Sure, why not? I bet you’d look absolutely hot as a drag queen. And I know you don’t mind wearing heels and a skirt,” he added, winking. They had already had some fun with this kink after Draco had discovered a few trunks of women’s clothes and accessories in the attic.
It had been so long since Draco had been surrounded by magic that he was starting to feel a little off kilter. The idea of a magic challenge made him feel practically manic.
“Now, you’ll be performing in two teams before a live audience,” RuPaul continued. “Venus, since you won the mini challenge, you get to choose your sisters.” Venus smiled deviously. “So, Venus, who is your first choice?”
," Draco-as-Mary-Berry explained, "So now that I have more time on my hands, I can indulge in a little tipple now and then. Especially now. But I only have one glass," Mary Berry insisted, and took a sip. “Mmm, scrummy!"
Draco looked up, confused, until she saw a blonde, slender queen appear from around a door at the back of the set.
“I won the challenge!” Ivana smiled at the camera. “All these bitches underestimated me because I’m the oldest, but who’s laughing now? Age before beauty,
“They send their regards, by the way,” the ghost continued, oblivious to Draco’s distress. “Did you know Fred died? Shame
“I designed these badges when I was in school,” he explained. He pointed to each one in turn. “This one says ‘Support Cedric Diggory,’ that was my first one.”
“For this week’s mini challenge, I want to see you give us your best face — on someone else! Pair up with the person next to you,” he said, and the queens drifted into pairs. Draco found himself paired with Goldie.
now? People have been wanting to follow you on Instagram, Twitter, et cetera – and clubs are wanting to book you for gigs! They need a way to contact you.”
“Speak for yourself, kiddo!” Aunt Aura called from the other end of the room. She and Professor Burbage were in the middle of some game that involved scaring doxies back and forth across the room. Draco had long since given up on understanding the points system.
The queens were quiet as they tried to think of a sorority name. Or, at least, Paris and Goldie were trying to think of a sorority name while Draco pretended to think, since he had no idea what a sorority was.
“I love not paying for things! I haven’t paid for toilet paper in six years. I’ve got two rolls in my bra right now that I got from your bathroom backstage.” She giggled.
“Say, Draco, Potter told me I could find you here. Have you seen this rag?” When Blaise looked at the sight before him, his jaw dropped in surprise.
Draco received a lesson on how to hold a microphone and how far away to hold it from his mouth. He jumped when he heard his own voice amplified across the room.
Afterward, the audience left the set and the queens reentered the stage for judging. Kali, Goldie, and Venus all received praise for their routines.
Draco stepped out of the floo and into the dimly lit wizarding reception room of Best of Both Worlds. This was the relatively new shop that Dean Thomas had opened with his muggle sister next to the Leaky Cauldron. The business primarily catered to muggleborns and their families, offering email-to-owl mailing services, wizarding/muggle currency exchange and credit services, and electronic devices that had been modified to resist shorting out around magic. After Harry had told Draco about buying his laptop there, Draco had found their services indispensable in preparing his audition video for
“For you? Always.” Draco smiled as Harry leaned over, kissing the blonde gently so as not to smudge anything. “Care for some champagne before you go?”
We've finally made it to Snatch Game! This took me longer to write than expected. I'm sure there are parts of it that could be better, but this is the version that's getting published. Enjoy!
Back on the runway, the Venusian team faced final judgment while their Parisian sisters stood in the back.
Draco smirked at Lady Cakes, who smirked back in challenge. “Lady Cakes, you may talk about how you wear your cakes on your chest, but
Potter continued to hold the little sausage on a toothpick in front of Draco, raising his eyebrow in challenge.
“What are you doing here, anyway? I would have thought you’d be in the Great Hall chumming it up with your fan club.”
in your hotel room?” Intoxia asked, pointing at the Nimbus 2001 propped in the corner by the window.
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul chimed, stepping into the workroom dressed in a blue leather motorcycle jacket with silver stars and matching cap and pants, and a red-and-white striped T-shirt.
As the song picked up for the next two lines, she quick-stepped a few paces to the right and back again. She spun in place to face the judges for the next part.
“Let’s move on,” Granger-Weasley continued, unrattled. She pulled out her wand and transfigured the lipstick into a table.
Harry reached his arm around Draco’s shoulder and gave her a hug. Pansy grabbed her hand and gave it a squeeze.
“Hello, Divining Divas! I knew you were going to call,” Draco answered like a smug Trelawney. “I suppose you’d like to know what the future has in store for you?”
Whatever sense of euphoria Draco felt when dancing on the runway evaporated during the face-to-face session with the judges. Ivana, Goldie, Venus, Kali, Steve, and Intoxia had already been declared “safe” and sent back to the Untucked lounge.
“That’s brilliant,” Draco absently replied as she worked on transfiguring her lips to a luscious, pink pout. “Keep practicing.”
“So that’s all you need to know about boarding school,” she continued. “But at the end of the school year, I would go home for the summer. I was an only child, and had a bedroom all to myself. The silence was deafening,” Draco explained.
Draco raised an eyebrow at her. He hadn’t been aware that he was being followed, but the news didn’t come as a surprise. “I’m sure I hate to be so disappointing.”
. Cindy trotted around the stage and emoted every facial expression possible, while Acacia devoted herself to incessant shablamming and shaking her lion’s tail.
“What makes you think being around me will be fun?” Okay, maybe that wasn’t the best tactic. He didn’t need to make himself out to be any more pathetic than he already was, thank you.
Draco went about preparing his tea and toast and had quite gotten caught up in these thoughts when the ghostly visage of Vincent Crabbe appeared mere inches in front of his face.
“For today’s mini challenge, you will each take turns reading each other. Ladies, the library is open...
“I have no idea what’s going on,” Steve said. “Draco is freaking out, Acacia is freaking out, and me, Paris, and Goldie are looking at each other because none of us know what to do.”
country dance,” Draco explained. But then she stopped hopping and leaned forward, twerking for all she was worth. Her wig flew off and landed in an undignified heap.
The conversation died down while a few of Harry’s grandchildren passed around slices of a large cake in the shape of a snitch.
He looked back to see a family of four step onto the landing pad, each grab onto some type of metal pole, and disappear.
, real animal or no. He was grateful that none of this would make its way back to the wizarding world. How would the
The audience roared with laughter and applauded. Pansy, the Greengrass sisters, and Millicent were all red in the face and looked like they were about to die.
She looked unimpressed with his displeasure as she reexamined his luggage. “Better,” she sniffed. She Conjured long strips of some type of sticker with muggle flight information and fastened one onto the handle of each suitcase.
“I used to play quidditch in school, too,” she informed him. “Chaser for Wampus House. You know, we actually have a wampus cat here on the island. It comes out at night. Sometimes we see it roaming around the park in the early hours.”
The other queens each served looks that fell somewhere on a spectrum of sexy-scary-insane-ugly. On behalf of real witches everywhere, Draco felt slightly embarrassed by the parade of imitators. Though he had to grant that of the queens, only she and Kali had any idea what a “real” witch should look like.
Goldie gave the notes a thoughtful look. “You know, I kinda like it. Especially since you didn’t change my lines all that much,” he laughed.
“That had to be the drunkest Mary Berry I’ve ever seen,” Ross said. “It was more like Mary Berry by way of Amy Winehouse.”
“Not yet,” Draco answered. “Would you mind sending in Shangela next? I’d like to pick her brain.” Steve and Lorena snapped their heads in his direction and looked nervous.
“Hey Lorena,” Carmelita sidled up next to the other queen and peered at the hem she was pinning before looking around the room. “Who do you think’s gonna get sent home first?”
Heather turned her face to look at him again. She considered him for a moment before answering, “You know, I’m inclined to believe you.”
After taking a few minutes to recover himself, Draco sighed and trudged back to the werkroom. The journey back felt ten times longer than it had when he first left. He fell into his makeup chair with a sigh and picked up a brush. He started applying eyeshadow with a shaky hand, getting it outside the intended area.
The man checked something on the back of his sign, then studied Draco’s face. “Heyyy, I guess you must be Draco!” he smiled, and reached for Draco’s suitcases.
“That’s not including the Black estate,” Malfoy continued, holding up another form. “Looks like the farm has been doing well. One hundred acres of winter wheat, sixty of rapeseed, plus the apple orchard. You might tell Old Pendleton to rotate in a legume next summer to replenish the soil quality, but in general, it’s a thriving property.”
Draco paced back and forth in front of the space where the door to the Room of Hidden Things should appear, desperately trying to imagine the way it looked before Crabbe caught it on fire. He very much hoped that it wouldn’t still be on fire after all this time, but nothing felt certain. After a moment, the door materialized.
“Still, you’re lucky that it was something within the realm of possibility for no-mags,” she added. “They may think you have unusually talented gymnastic abilities, but they don’t think what you did was impossible.” She gave him a broad smile. “Let’s just consider this a warning and hope you can continue to stay in the competition without any more magic! It would be a shame to have to destroy evidence of one of your stunning performances and obliviate everyone, wouldn’t it?”
“Morning,” Draco answered politely, forced to a stop. He recognized her as one of the crew assistants on the show.
Draco wondered what sort of lawyer Harry had found to defend him. Could they stand up against Clearwater? Who would the Wizengamot feel more sympathetic towards? The Malfoy name in general wasn’t as popular as it once was before the war. Draco had made out with the lesser sentence, but still, it had been quite a feat of legal wrangling to talk the Wizengamot down from the lifetime sentence in Azkaban that they had initially planned for Lucius.
“You know I’ll help, too,” Goyle said, “Though I’m hoping you won’t need too much magic from me. I’m a bit rusty these days.”
“Draco, you know I love you, baby,” Lady Cakes began, “But you’re so clueless, I think you must have been born a hundred years ago and you time-traveled to the 21st century just for drag and Grindr. Not necessarily in that order.” The queens all laughed. Even Draco chuckled, hoping it wasn’t obvious that he had no idea what was meant by a grinder.
“Paris Davenport, you told America why you should be president, and gave us much more than politics as usual. And, your ballot box is well stuffed.” Paris proudly smoothed a gloved hand over her satin-covered derrière. “Condragulations, you are the winner of this challenge.”
“Oh, you’ll find out soon enough.” Kong winked. “Really, it’s just a formality. I’m sure you won’t give us any reason to suspect you of doing real magic in front of the no-mags.” With that, he, too, walked away, leaving Draco confused and slightly worried.
“Security!” RuPaul called to someone behind the camera. “Anyway, I’m afraid that’s not a match. Let’s move on to Carrie Fisher. Carrie, the big bad wolf is a drag queen. Instead of huffing and puffing, she
“Anyway, I felt pretty shitty for putting you on the spot like that. I should have known better than to ask you to use your magic in front of the cameras.”
Draco sighed. “Goodbye, Queenie Q,” she said as she began cleaning, wiping until the words became a blurry pink smear and deciding it was good enough. “That’s one queen down, twelve more to go!”
“I still remember the first time I brought Harry back to my bedroom at the Manor,” Draco told his grandchildren, a little smile sneaking onto his face. “Of course, he had to complain about it. ‘
“The Black family always did make the best cider,” Malfoy commented, a wistful look overtaking his features. “I bet you didn’t know their family motto referred to the brewing process, eh?
Once all the queens were changed, they were led one by one to a stage with a large, heavy-looking metal door.
“I asked you to bring your L-539, 4187-DFW, and 4817-WFD forms. These are L-593, 4187-WFD, and 4817-DFW forms.” He tossed them back across the desk at Harry as if they had personally offended him somehow.
So...what did you think? Who was your favorite celebrity in this chapter? Which queen would you have chosen to win the challenge, based on how they performed in Snatch Game? As always, I value all your comments and kudos. Thanks again for sticking with this fic!
Draco pouted. “But I bet the audience would like to see me perform some magic, wouldn’t you?” She addressed the audience, which cheered enthusiastically.
“Not bad, I guess. This one’s better, though. What do you think?” Harry held up another pic for Draco to assess. “At least you’re getting some free porn out of it,” he laughed. “I guess I can’t blame other guys for thinking you’re hot. But they can’t have you,” he purred.
I’m alive! It’s been...a long time since my last update. What’s my best excuse? The 2020 dumpster fire? My creative muse getting quarantined on a desert island without internet? The fact that this fic got stuck on a word count with 666 in it for over a year? Hmm, it must have been the word count!!!
Draco sat down tenderly on the edge of the stage and gazed at the letter again before embracing it once more. A tear fell down one cheek.
“Condragulations, Draco! You have won a two-thousand-dollar gift certificate for custom jewelry by Viva Regina.” Draco clapped and jumped up and down caught up in the excitement.
“A kitchen sponge! Because she’s so dirty!” RuPaul agreed. “Now let’s go to our stars and hear what they had to say. Amelia, how did you answer?”
Draco walked in and looked around. Aside from a few scorch marks on a far window, there was nothing to see at all.
“Wait a minute!” RuPaul interrupted. “Why, this tea table is set for two! We need another queen to join the party!”
The stage had been set up with seven podiums. Each queen took her place and nervously made last-minute adjustments before the debate began.
But he had always tried to earn his father’s approval anyway. His left arm twitched at times when he thought about the sacrifices he had made for his father. He didn’t have to look at look at the mark on his arm to be reminded of it.
“I don’t think your government knows about this to ban it,” Draco reflected, “but discretion is a good idea.”
And, since he was already depressed enough about his chances of fixing that damned cabinet, it only made sense that he would fall in love with such a depressed, depressing spirit.
“Team Paris, you are safe. You may leave the stage.” The safe queens walked away, leaving Team Venus looking nervously toward the judges.
Draco sat back down and added a kitten brooch to her suit jacket. “I know a lot of people in this audience won’t understand much of what happens in this week’s episode unless they have had a surprising amount of exposure to American muggle culture. I thought I would take the opportunity tonight to play someone they might actually recognize instead. Think I can make her funny?” She smirked at him through the mirror.
Oddly enough, Draco had forgotten that he was supposed to be getting paid for appearing on the show. He did his best to hide his surprise quickly and signed the slip of paper Mariah handed him before pocketing the money.
The peplum jacket was fastened with a single button at the waist, flaring out at the hips to give a more feminine shape. From neck to waist she showed a deep vee of pale skin, foregoing a blouse underneath. Once again, she went without padding to show off her slender silhouette. The collar stood high on her neck and flared out around the base of her head. A chestnut wig — that went better than her usual white blonde with the beige, brown, and pumpkin tones in the arabesque pattern of the red carpet — was styled into short starlet curls that swept over to the right side of her head and framed her ear. An oversized pillbox hat in the same carpet material sat cocked to the left side of her head, decorated with an even larger elaborate carpet bow and a pheasant feather jutting upwards to the ceiling. Large gold and diamond earrings, choker, and cocktail rings added sparkle. Her feet stamped down the runway in pointy-toed crimson velvet stilettos.
“I have it made by Mr. Chocolate himself, Jacques Torres!” She held up a small hand puppet of a man in a white chef’s jacket. RuPaul laughed. She turned to her puppet. “Jacques, why don’t you go bake a cake for us right now?” The puppet’s head nodded, and then she stuck it back under the desk.
Several more people appeared to be in shock. Draco hoped they would appreciate that she wasn’t doing
“You really were, you know!” Harry interjected. “I always loved watching you when I got the chance--”
“Ta,” she said, setting her drink down. “Excuse me, I think I need to get my mic adjusted.” She went over to where Herb Kong, Paprikah, and Basil were standing.
He handed Draco a glittering green-gold cocktail with a stir that had a tiny silver mitten on the tip. “Just remember, don’t take Pansy too seriously.”
“My fellow Americans, our country is one marred by division and discord,” she spoke quickly to make sure she didn’t run out of time. “I am Paris Davenport, and if elected, I will bring teamwork back to the White House. My campaign slogan is, ‘Paris Will Take One For The Team.’ But that’s not just a slogan. It’s a promise.” She nodded seriously at the moderators.
Draco Malfoy was no stranger to ghosts. Long before he had ever set foot in Hogwarts and sat next to the Bloody Baron at his first welcoming feast, he was already well familiar with his great-great-great-great-great-something Aunt Aura floating around the manor.
Draco collapsed in her dressing room chair and removed her Umbridge hat and wig with a sigh. Emceeing the party in that costume had been exhausting. She was startled by a knock at the door.
Later on, the queens sat in the workroom, tapping pencils to notepads as they tried to think up campaign ideas.
“CUT!” Michelle cried. The three looked at her. Lorena paused with the drumstick still in her mouth. “Take it down a notch, or we won’t get the episode past the censors,” she warned.
“Kali Sister, your performance as Jameela Jamil took us to a Bad Place. Lorena Gucci, your Ariana Grande made us want to say, ‘Thank U, Next.’” RuPaul paused for dramatic effect while the two queens stood nervously. “Lorena Gucci, I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
“Now is your chance to join the cutthroat world of culinary television. You will work in two teams of five,” RuPaul continued. “When your team is on the set, you will take turns in front of the camera to demonstrate a recipe for a home audience. Your cooking shows will be directed by our special guest judge: renowned chef, television personality, and bestselling author, Martha Stewart.”
Draco smirked at the camera. “Oh, and have I mentioned that I’m fluent in French? Cette synchronisation labiale, n'est pas une problème.”
The tension in the room hit a breaking point when Kali said, “Holy crap, I feel like I got good critiques tonight!” She ran a hand along her shoulder-length auburn wig, pleased with herself.
“I’m writing you a to-do list,” said Wilford Woodletter, the accountant Neville had recommended. Woodletter had served the Longbottom family for four decades and was highly acclaimed. He kept his face in a professionally neutral expression that Harry suspected was masking the sort of face that Snape used to make at him in every Potions class.
“But pulling out your wand and broom is really pushing it,” Herb continued. “You may not have revealed anything meaningful to no-mags, but I can’t imagine everyone in the wizarding world is going to appreciate that distinction. If I were you, I’d get ready to do some damage control back home once this episode airs.”
“You were jumping up and down and shouting like a little kid, and I was here for it,” special guest judge Becky G told Draco. “It was pure joy.”
Goyle was sitting in an armchair, reading a very large, thick book. He jumped an inch above his seat at the interruption, the book lifting into the air. He managed to catch it with only minimal fumbling, then turned his attention to the fire.
She reached forward with her hand, as if to pull herself along an invisible rope closer to the judges.
Draco Malfoy was in a state of ongoing metamorphosis in his life. Former Death Eater Draco Malfoy was still reviled back in England. Former Death Eater Draco Malfoy had been unable to get a job in the wizarding world after his sentence of house arrest ended following the war. Soon after a chance encounter with Harry Potter, the two started dating and fell in love, and Draco graduated from Unemployed Former Death Eater Draco Malfoy to Unemployed Live-In Boyfriend Draco Malfoy.
“You’ve been quiet,” Lady Cakes said to her as the others kept discussing the queens’ rankings in the challenge. “Are you pissed because you weren’t in the top three this week?”
“But maybe you and I could help each other out,” Kali continued. He pushed away from the wall and moved forward to stand just a few inches away from Draco.
“One at a time,” RuPaul continued, “You will pick up the phone to help a mystery caller with a really special problem that only a psychic could solve. I’m counting on you to use your powers of improvisation to tell us the future! Oh, and make sure the future is funny — because the one who makes our mystery caller laugh the most wins!
“No shit, I saw an owl in our hotel the other night, too!” Kali added, and laughed. “I was just heading to the ice machine when I saw it swooping down the hall towards the front desk.”
Draco pulled a hand away from her face and looked down at the wet streak of mascara on her finger. She stood up suddenly with newfound determination. “I’ve got to fix my makeup.”
“What do you mean? We’re all men passing ourselves off as women — some of us more successfully than others, of course,” Draco replied. “Oh, but there are some queens who identify as transgender women,” she added.
He internally thought he was right about ghosts having no sense of the passage of time, but kept that to himself lest they pass through him again as Burbage and Aunt Aura had the last time he brought it up. Still, how abominably rude — let alone vastly misguided — for them to think he
“Ooh, this is gonna be a close one,” Venus said. “Lorena is doing some serious body work with her dance moves, but Intoxia is nailing every single word of the lip sync and spinning herself all over the stage.”
Dave pointed to the belt hanging next to Draco’s chair. “Grab that, stick the metal part into that slot,” he explained, pointing to a small box on the other side of the chair.
“You have won a set of custom eyewear by Madame LeSpecs, along with a $2,000 gift card for Nails by Floyd.” RuPaul informed her. Ivana clapped in delight.
“Doesn’t seem too sad about being a ghost now,” Potter commented, shoving another sausage in his mouth. Draco wished he would stop eating those because it was uncouth and bloody unnerving.
Meanwhile, in the Untucked Lounge, Lorena was less than pleased about the judges’ critiques. She fidgeted with the strap of a cherry-patterned halter top, giving the others a surly look as they discussed whom they thought were in the top and bottom.
After the judges concluded their interviews, the queens went backstage for Untucked. They each grabbed a signature cocktail from the makeshift bar and sat down. Lady Cakes sighed, kicking her heels off and leaning back into the sofa.
Polite applause came from four queens who were clustered around a pink worktable. Draco walked up to them.
“Draco,” RuPaul addressed. “You are one fierce queen, but this week, your cooking was only...half baked. I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.” Draco nodded stiffly. She had expected as much.
“But she got better!” Draco turned to the audience. “And isn’t it a nice arse, ladies and gentlemen? Paris, show them your arse!” Paris turned around and twerked while the audience erupted in cheers and applause.
Finally, there was his relationship with his fellow queens. This had been another intense journey over the past several weeks. Sure, they ribbed and sniped at each other. But even that reminded him of life in Slytherin House. It almost felt like they were becoming a family to him. Again, he caught himself wondering what would happen after he left the show. Would he still connect to them once he returned to the wizarding world?
“Of course not,” he replied. He minded quite a bit, actually, but knew better than to tell her that.
“Next month,” Draco answered. “I’m preparing some numbers that haven’t been performed at the viewing parties yet. Teddy will have his lip sync debut as the opening act.”
“She almost threw me out of the shop then and there,” Draco added, “Told me she didn’t run a ‘happy endings massage parlor,’ in her words. I had to do some fast talking to convince her.”
“Draco,” Michelle said once the judges shifted attention to her, “Tonight on the runway, you look great. That cooking skit, though.” She shook her head slowly. “It was all over the map. It didn’t make any sense to me.”
Draco considered him for a moment. Lately, he had been trying this new concept of being nicer to people. In the second week of Drag Race, the other queens in Team Venus had wanted Draco to be sent home. But then, being nice to Lady Cakes by healing his wrists had paid off. Not only had he helped Draco win the Week 3 challenge, but he was helping him understand American muggle culture. For that matter, Steve Donovan had seemed to warm up to Draco after Draco had helped her during Untucked. Maybe niceness could change other queens’ opinions of her.
“Do you need more performers?” Millicent asked. “If you’re arranging a longer drag show, it seems like you might be able to use some backup, right?”
Kali, meanwhile, had clearly struggled with the corn she had chosen. She had to walk carefully down the runway because the husks were loosely glued to her skirt and spray-painted black. The result was a very stiff knee-length skirt and a top that appeared to be irritating her skin as the husks rubbed her shoulders and turned them black. A black cornucopia wobbled precariously on her head.
“So I guess I have the look down,” Draco commented. She stood up and smoothed out her pink tweed suit. She hadn’t added extra padding for this look, but maybe it didn’t matter. “I’m still working on the voice, though. What do you think of this: tee hee!” she let out a dainty little giggle.
“Well, that was different,” Bruce Vilanch told the camera. “I think we’ve found the last remaining queen in the entire world who had no idea how microphones work. Draco is lucky she won extra time for her workshop, because otherwise we wouldn’t have gotten around to working on her actual stand-up routine. It will be interesting to see how she makes it through the real thing in front of a live audience.”
Harry closed his eyes and tried to push back the smoke that threatened to come out of his ears. He could remain calm. “I’m sorry,” he said after a moment. “How did he die?”
finale in a few months. “Though next time, maybe you could perform something with a little magic in it, now that you’re not in front of muggles?”
Potter snorted. “If that’s your criteria for love, it’s a wonder the entire Hogwarts student body hasn’t fallen in love with you.”
Mariah grinned back. “Yes, social media accounts! We received quite the urgent message earlier. It seems World Of Wonder has been trying to call you ever since the first episode aired, but your phone has been turned off.”
“Which way is she going?” Michelle asked after Draco performed a pirouette at the edge of the stage.
“Condragulations, my crazy eight!” RuPaul told the remaining queens. “And remember — if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love someone else?! Can I get an amen up in here?!”
Harry blinked. He looked around the room, blurry as it was without his glasses. Why was it blurry? Where were his glasses? How did it get so dark?
Draco took a deep break and paused in the middle of applying eyeshadow to the left eye. “I was disowned,” he replied crisply.
“Like Paris’ tuck!” Goldie interjected, and waved jazz hands at Paris’ crotch as Paris posed appropriately.
“Harry, as much as I want to support your baking, I won’t be able to fit into my corset for much longer if you keep bringing me food before a show,” Draco whined.
Harry turned and gave him a quizzical look. Draco furrowed his eyebrows in response. “They really don’t have drag queens in the wizarding world, do they?” Harry asked, more to himself than to Draco.
“Well, I can, and with Potter, he’s an all-around nice bloke, but whenever he looked at me and Vince, it’s like the author narrating his thoughts turned into a judgmental bitch.”
Lady Cakes stared at Draco for a moment, then scoffed. “Okay, first, how in the hell did you fit those down your top? They’re bigger than your tits.” Draco shrugged. Lady Cakes shook her head. “Second,
Draco rolled her eyes. “As much as I appreciate the need for drama in these Untucked sessions, your delivery leaves something to be desired,” she drawled.
“I refused to marry the witch my father picked out for me,” Draco told the camera. “So I was kicked out, his only son and heir, because he’d rather the name die with him than see me carry it on being myself.”
“Welcome back, ladies. I’ve made some decisions,” RuPaul told them. “Lady Cakes McMansion...you are safe. You may join the other girls.” Lady Cakes bowed her head and went to the back.
