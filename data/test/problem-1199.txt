“Hey. Let’s not lie here, most of us in this room are probably curious - sexuality wise - so we all understand. Right? Even if you’re straight, you don’t say anything rude about it or I’ll beat you to a pulp.” Pansy smiled brightly, contrasting highly to her previous threatening words.
Draco’s eyes widened, his heart stuttering harshly in his chest once more. He’d only just been made aware of this newly foun- okay. Today was the day that he realised he’d had a crush on his rival for a long time, it was baffling how he didn’t realise sooner. Blinded by what he thought was hatred but was in fact undiscovered feelings, and the strange sexual tension that’s always been there between the two of them.
“C-Crabbe did it, I didn’t want to b-be the one to make it j-just in case I-I- I don’t know!”
Harry knew that this was all in his head, how this was just a fantasy conjured up by a lust potion about the boy he’d been thinking about for years now. He had already come to terms with the fact that nothing was ever gonna happen and as much as he hated it, he knew that being real with himself was the best way to go - false hope was something he did not fuck with.
Draco nodded his head in understanding, already feeling scrutinised from the observation he was undergoing from Potter’s tenebrous eyes.
He decided to distract himself and nudged Goyle, who was seemingly very entranced in the Gryffindor’s conversation.
“Anyway, something tells me that you weren’t so sad that it turned into a lust potion.”
“Unless its You-Know-Who, can it wait? We need to study for the test next week.” Hermione had a frustrated expression on her face, attempting to plead with her friend.
Harry’s words were threatening and malicious sounding, his voice so gravelly that it shook Draco to his core, rumbled throughout his very bones. His cock twitched again and he whimpered as quietly as he could, Harry heard it though. He could tell by the way he could feel his smirk against his skin, then the heat was gone and he was back in his normal position.
He’d expected giggling at the sight, ripping pants isn’t exactly something that isn’t funny. So he was rather surprised when he heard her gasp, not in a negative way either. He remembered what she had said and what had happened, word for word.
‘Good genes’ was what he sarcastically thought in his head. He then, hesitantly, moved his hand to rest on his thigh.
Draco’s cheeks darkened at his unconscious submission, he hadn’t even thought twice about it. Merlin, he was so gone for this man. The praise made a smile appear on his lips, one which he didn’t even realise was there until Potter smirked knowingly down at him - his cheeks gained more colour after that.
Draco felt himself starting to sweat under the harshness of Harry’s eyes, he could practically see the thoughts fleeing through his head. He had an idea that they were about things that would make him blush more than he already was, if such thing were possible.
“How long?” Was all Harry could ask, during his zone out he had lost all awareness of time.
With this hands shaking, he brought his eyes up to meet Potter’s. And holy fucking shit, he now knew what he was so hesitant to look into his eyes. Draco’s cheeks burned with shame from how his prick was aching with a need to release, throbbing as their gazes locked. The pure dominance seeping from his pores doing nothing more but adding to the frustrating pleasure.
Ginny chuckled as she referred to Fred and George, the slight shock of Harry’s words now ebbing away.
“What’s not yours to touch?”
Oh boy did he thrive off of hearing Draco beg, his shaky voice barely audible from the whimpers spilling from his mouth during every pause between his words. He got off on making the bitchy Malfoy become putty in his hands, his for the taking. Making him beg just to be touched.
He ended up picking out some black, ripped jeans. Draco had to admit, they were his tattiest and possibly- no, definitely- sluttiest pair. They were ripped at the knees, as those types of jeans usually were and a few scattered across the leg.
Potter had already slipped down the back of his throat, causing more tears to glaze over his smitten eyes; none of which had fallen yet.
“Harry. Are you fucking listening?”
Harry smirked, mockingly and teasingly - knowing that it made the other crazy in the best way possible.
Draco knew that he wouldn’t dare though, he may think it but he knew for a fact that he would never go through with it. For the reason that he didn’t want to disobey Harry, he wanted to show him that he could be good for him. Be his good boy.
“No shit, way for stating the obvious. You’ve really only just noticed? I’ve been standing here for ages. Also, I’ve been rock fucking hard for about an hour now.”
He had a good idea of what was about to happen, the thought had his whole frame vibrating.
“Ouch Hermione! What the f-“
Even though the memory was kinda strange, both Ron and Hermione chuckled.
Hermione couldn’t hold back her giggle at the way the twins’ eyes shimmered in mischievous curiosity.
“You’ll be fine mate, just a couple mor-“ Ron was interrupted instantly, he could practically feel the sexual tension and frustration oozing out of his friend.
“The thing you aren’t allowed to be bitchy about, sexualities.” Blaise spoke in a joke tone but his words were very serious, he knew it wouldn’t be a problem as Hogwarts had an exceptionally varied amount of sexualities - he still wanted it said aloud though.
The waves of arousal that rocketed through his body, to his hard cock and back again, was the only source of pleasure he was receiving. Apparently that didn’t matter much, considering how insanely good he was feeling already.
(See the end of the chapter for
He eventually ended up picking one of his many black button ups, it was up against his black turtleneck but he remembered how hot he gets in it so the shirt won. Draco very much enjoyed his black clothing, he felt as if he didn’t suit many colours so practically all his clothes had the same pigment.
Harry went to elbow her as a way of saying ‘you will do no such thing’ before the potion upped its game in meddling with his thoughts.
He then felt somebody touch his chin and move it up, he recognised them as Pansy’s hands. Why had she done that? Oh. He hadn’t even realised that his mouth was agape, that was slightly embarrassing.
“Just turn around and look in the mirror.” He found his eyes rolling at her demand but not saying anything as he followed it, turning around and then craning his neck to look. And oh-
Draco would’ve whimpered out loud if he still wasn’t clinging to the remaining crumbs of his dignity, he gulped again.
Harry then moved his left hand from his curvy hips to cup the boy’s erection, almost tight enough to be painful. Malfoy keened as his knees buckled after hearing the appreciative sound that came from his former enemy, he felt his grip get stronger.
“Isn’t this a very personal conversation for everybody to hear?” An uncomfortable look on his face, feeling bad. When Pansy stood up, he honestly thought he was gonna get decked. That was until she waltzed over and sat on his table.
Harry’s voice was rougher and deeper than it had been all day, it could’ve even been confused with growling.
With one last lick, Harry moved his mouth away; momentarily content with the art he had made on the other’s neck. He had left many possessive marks but in no way was Draco’s skin covered, there was still plenty of room left for Harry to add more - he’d do that later though.
His friends could only gape up at him, mouths wide open. They had no idea if Harry had even realised what he had just said, out loud. To be honest though, the twins had asked for it and they were fucking enjoying the answer they got.
Draco’s throat felt tight as Potter pulled away, engaging in eye contact straight away and trembling under the authoritative gaze. The pernicious grin his lips had been stretched into made the boner in his pants painful, the reason that even though the expression made it look as if he wanted to hurt him - he knew that Harry only wanted to hurt him in ways that caused pleasure. Which made the maliciousness of it all that more arousing.
According to Hermione, Ron and Ginny, they thought that it was very possible. Of course, Harry did everything he could not to believe them. Again, not wanting to fill his body up with that wonderful feeling of hope that was just gonna be false in the end.
“You do realise how many people in this school want to kiss Harry Potter and you got the chance to do so.”
Draco and Harry’s friends were all watching with wide eyes and baited breath, fully entranced in what was playing out right in front of them. Their eyes switching between Malfoy and Potter.
He let his lips slip into a malicious grin, looking at his friends one last time before opening his mouth to speak.
His friends’ eyes widened, so did the Slytherin’s. Especially Draco’s, the clear show of power that Potter had was just succeeding in making him smitten. He knew that Potter was extremely powerful, if not the most powerful.
“Basically, Harry was complaining that he was horny and after me telling him to deal with it he started complaining more just to spite me. He’s a bitch.” She giggled as she made eye contact with said bitch, the small smirk he was wearing making her laugh more.
“I didn’t even know I was gay.” That made her serious up for a moment.
Draco squinted his eyes as he tried to make himself look to opposite of what Potter was saying he was, he was only proving the other’s point though. And deep inside, the blonde knew it. Maybe he was purposely doing it just to get a kick out of Potter, it was a dangerous game he was playing but oh so thrilling.
All he’d ever wanted to do was mark Draco’s pretty, porcelain skin up. And now he could, he would not waste this chance. He let his tongue glide over the quickly forming bruise, sucking on his neck before biting down once more.
“Come on, Harry. One of those things is most definitely worse than the other.” She rolled her eyes at his dramatics, a fond smile on her lips.
“Because, seeing you embarrassed.” He grabbed Draco’s hand, placing it against the large of his cock through his jeans. “Does so much to me.”
“Jeez, alright! We’re ready.” They muttered at the same time, both placing their attention - once again - back on Hermione.
But Pansy had come up with an idea, she asked the blonde if he wanted to add some more cuts to them. Draco, albeit reluctantly, said yes. He didn’t know how muggle style worked, these had been his first proper pair of muggle clothing. His fashionable best friend had taken him and as much as Draco called a menace sometimes, she did know what looked good on him.
“With Harry, as we suspected, just got super horny. It was honestly kinda surprising how quick it came on.”
“Hm. I dunno really.” The blonde wanted to slap the back of his head again as he rolled his eyes, he managed to catch Pansy’s attention; she was slightly below Draco in potions so he knew that she could help.
“I think I’ve been slipped a lust potion.” Even Harry knew that his words sounded way too nonchalant then what they probably should’ve.
Draco was using every particle of power that he still had left to keep the noises in that he knew would only cause more embarrassment.
“My guess is that after what I’m going to do to you, you’re gonna be loud. And as hot and as much as I’d enjoy having everyone hear you screaming my name, I don’t want your dignity to be in complete shambles - to the rest of my house particularly - so I’ll give you something.”
…relief that someone else could see his pain, acknowledged that it was real. He’d never expected that, here of all places, and he didn’t know what to do with it.
“He used the sticking charm, and I couldn’t move. I remember trying to scream but he…he closed his hand over my nose as well so I couldn’t breathe.” Draco felt his body begin to shake. “His other hand was still…on me. I could feel myself starting to react and I…I didn’t know what to do. I froze. And when I froze, he just kept saying things to me, about how good I was, how special, how this was something for us. Somewhere in there he…he removed my pants. He kept the one hand over my mouth and then…he…he put his…mouth…on me. He…sucked me off…and then when I was done, he…he climbed up me and stuck…stuck his tongue in my mouth. He started…touching himself…and kissing me…and rubbing himself on me…until…until he came all over me.”
“I wondered how you could be a healer so young,” Draco blurted, realizing how against his pureblood upbringing it was to comment on a witch’s age.
With that declaration, Draco felt a fresh wave of exhaustion crash over him. He thought about talking to Harry. Things had been different between them over the past month—they’d been close, tender with one another, if he was being honest, but he knew that so much of that was the stress of the situation. He feared that things would be different when Harry woke, when he realized he didn’t need Draco any longer to stay safe. Draco tried to push these thoughts from his mind. He tried not to let himself hope too much, but he tried not to crush himself either. “That’s a relief,” he said at last, meaning those words with every fiber of his being.
He downed the sour liquid in one gulp, trying to hide how disgusting he found it. She smiled at him once more, took the phial, and left the room. His last thought as he fell asleep, hand reaching to thread with Harry’s motionless fingers, was that he hadn’t even asked her name. His savior, this nameless healer who had saved both of their lives. He faded into blackness with more peace than he’d felt in a long while.
“Of course, Draco,” she smiled back at him. “I’ll see you when you wake.”
“But I didn’t know what to do. I was too afraid of being disowned to tell him what I feared would happen. My father didn’t often use…physicality…as a punishment—I mean it certainly felt like one, but that wasn’t usually how he framed it—and when he did it was…brutal. That year, when I got home for the holiday, he let me have dinner with he and mother in the dining room, but he wouldn’t look at or speak to me. I don’t know if mother knew what was happening or what was going to happen. I’m…hopeful…that she didn’t, but if she did, she certainly…didn’t stop it. When dinner was over, he told me to meet him in his wing and…I knew something different and bad was going to happen.” His shaking was exceptionally noticeable at this point, but he pushed himself forward, gasping between words for breath to keep going.
“Our rivalry is stupid.” Harry spoke first, his eyes meeting Draco’s grey ones. He’d always found them beautiful, he tried to shake the thoughts and focus. Preparing himself to get majorly rejected.
“You sure?”
“He’s so much sassier when he’s horny, I love it.” Ginny spoke, the grin easily heard through her tone - this caused Hermione to giggle.
“Oh please, I can see right through you. You act like such a bitch, protecting yourself with that bratty attitude of yours. When really, you’d follow any demand I’d give you in an instant, wouldn’t you.”
“W-What?” He knew acting innocent wouldn’t save him at this point, only get him into deeper trouble - he didn’t know if he minded that though.
“2 hours! 1 hour left!” He blurted out, trying to calm himself down. Draco had already decided that he was going to shower, he was planning on it before but now he knew he was meeting Potter - he definitely wanted a shower.
Harry rubbed his eyes before shoving a hand through his hair, doing everything he could to just not look at his enemy. Well, former enemy? He had no fucking idea. It was difficult though, Malfoy was rather good looking.
Draco’s thoughts came to a halt as he readjusted his grip on Harry’s thick thighs, absentmindedly pulling himself closer.
As soon as they landed on him, they were gone again. Half of him was dissatisfied whilst the other was rather glad, if he wasn’t allowed to cum yet then he most definitely didn’t need those lustful eyes dragging over every inch of him. Merlins beard, he was already so submissive for Potter - he both hated and loved it.
Harry let a deep chuckle slip from his lips, almost as thick as honey, his eyes growing a shade darker - if that was even possible.
Even with the lust potion, Harry had seemed to still have amazing control and here he was not being able to think because of how horny he was. The temptation he was feeling was unruly, he could just get rid of the hard on in his boxers and then be able to focus again.
After the breath of relief that they had all collectively let out, they allowed themselves to chuckle at Harry’s words. Hermione sniggered and Neville spoke,
“He also smells treacle tart and the wood smell from a broomstick handle.” Harry’s cheeks darkened once more, he did smell like that. Hermione chuckled softly, pushing his unruly hair from his eyes.
Draco had frantically tried to complete his work, he struggled to remember what had actually happened during the class thanks to the hard heat between his legs. It was incredibly distracting and hard to focus.
Just as Harry was about to begin walking over to them, the thoughts in his head upped their game tremendously - a searing pain burned through his head. He gripped it from the pain, groaning as his knees buckled slightly.
Draco felt his pulse point pumping harshly in his neck, his body feeling high after the rush of heat that he got from Potter.
He realised that when he was looking at his friends, his eyes were completely normal. As if he imagined the lust he had seen in them. He would’ve thought he was going crazy if his eyes hadn’t have gone straight back to their darkened state as soon as his blown out eyes caught his.
The only exception was Potter. It wasn’t something that was forced, Draco had a choice. He was never given the opportunity to even have a choice before, when his fa-Lucius, was around.
“After a while, Ron admitted that he liked both guys and girls but finished his announcement by telling me that he loved me. If you remember, that’s actually how we got together.” Hermione giggled softly at how her boyfriend’s cheeks had turned a fiery red.
Potter was just teasing him now, purposely wanting him to feel the way he did. He was growing to, no matter how much he despised himself for it, crave it.
Draco whimpered, feeling how hard he was just because of him. He eyes also widened at just how big Potter was, he knew he was big from looking before but he felt even larger against his hand.
“God, Ginny. You sound like our mother.” Fred grinned at his twin from the way their sister pulled an offended face.
Draco barely remembered to grab his books as he snatched them from off the table clumsily and slid out of his seat, instinctually covering the hard on in his trousers. It must’ve looked so incredibly obvious but he had no other option at this point, he waved at his friends as he began walking - successfully escaping their questions…for now.
Blood was not only rushing to his lower half but every other inch of his body, he knew he must look ridiculous. His cheeks a dark crimson red, richer than blood as the tips of his ears were an identical colour. He felt sweat starting to collect at the back of his neck and the entirety of his body felt like someone had just poured gas all over him and lit a match.
The reaction from Draco had him squeezing the flesh, the whimpers fleeing from the other’s mouth making his cock throb in his jeans.
“Hermione, you may go now. You can tell the class what you smell after you get back.” The girl nodded, jumping out of her seat and jogging to the door. As soon as it was shut she began frantically looking, knowing all of his hiding spaces it definitely wouldn’t be hard.
“Shush! Quiet!” At first, the class just thought Snape was being how he normally was - strict. Then they saw his face, he was eavesdropping. Encouraging the class to do the same, that hadn’t changed.
“Harry, please!” He whispered as loudly as he felt he could safely get away with, struggling to keep himself moving forward with the other boy’s weight so fully surrounding him. “Please keep moving. We have to go! If we get caught now, we’re dead, and I mean that as literally as you can take it! They will kill us, please!”
He looked down to the countertop and found a pair of muggle sweatpants and a soft black long-sleeved shirt—his new wardrobe apparently—set out and folded for him. She really had thought of everything, and he felt comforted by her care and detail. Getting dressed was a bit more complicated, and it again, took a lot out of him. When he stepped out of the bathroom over an hour later, he was right and truly knackered. He gratefully took Lily’s offered support to make his way back to the space he shared with Harry.
She chuckled softly. “Yes, you will. No need to be dramatic.” Draco mustered enough energy to look offended at her use of the word. “Your body is
“Do you feel like you could tell me what happened?” She asked, her voice quiet, as if hoping not to spook him.
He sucked in another deep breath; his head bowed. “The night that I tried to kill Dumbledore…the night he…died. Was the first night…the…the first night…the Dark Lord…used me…like that.” He felt the tears increasing, white hot against his face; he’d never said this part out loud. Harry had known, because Harry had seen it, had felt it with him. He couldn’t have imagined how hard it would be to get those words out. “He was…angry…at me, but…celebrating. I’d never seen him so…volatile. I hadn’t felt pain like that since…the first time…with my father. But it became…normal…a regular occurrence. And when other death eaters…did things he liked…or won his favor…he let them use me…like a reward.” He paused then, a hard sob shaking his body. “When they brought…Harry…to the dungeon…they started, I think…I think they had meant…to kill him right away…but they started…using him, the way they did me, making us…do things…to one another, and it was like…they couldn’t stop themselves. But toward the end, they just got…rougher, more…violent. I knew it was only a matter of time before…before they killed us anyways; even if it wasn’t on purpose.”
Draco noticed that the man hung back, his wand still drawn, his eyes weary. “I was just trying to get up,” he mumbled quietly, rubbing at his sore calves, his body and his ego feeling tender. “I heard you in the hallway and I just—I wanted to—I figured if you were going to talk about me you should at least do it in front of me.” It felt stupid when he said it aloud. These people had saved his life unnecessarily; he supposed they had the right to talk about him.
Draco felt a balloon expand in his chest. “You’re going to wake him up?” He asked, doing his best not to sound too hopeful.
“He ripped me open. He didn’t…prep me…didn’t…use any…lube. He…fucked me…dry. I don’t know how long it lasted. I know I passed out once or twice but that he revived me when I did---he said I…needed to…
“And if you’re wrong,” he asked then, his voice lowering to a volume that was extremely difficult for Draco to make out.
Lily came back into the room then, startling him out of his intense thoughts. “Ready?” She asked, looking at him expectantly.
He had to keep going. He would make it to the end of the tunnel, apparate them as far away as he felt he could safely get, and then he’d figure out what to do next. He’d figure out what to do about getting them to Grimmauld Place. Wherever that was; he’d make it happen. They were so close, and he knew it was likely Wipsy would die for giving them this opportunity. He wouldn’t let her sacrifice be in vain. He wouldn’t let Harry Potter die. This was bigger than him, and he had to keep that in focus.
. The healer turned to Draco, slumped against the head of his bed. “I’m sorry about that,” she said then, her eyes gentler and sincere. “Remus means well—he’s one of the few people Harry has left, and he’s very protective of him—but he can be intense.”
And as soon as it started, it was over. Potter was back to jolting his prostate with every thrust of his unrelenting fingers.
This was a common occurrence for the friends, after Harry’s scar acted up they’d all place either their cool hands or wet rags against his forehead to soothe the pain. Most of the time just to cool him down, sometimes though they got shocked. The tingling sensation of magic thrumming through their bodies, it was sometimes even painful. This only made the friends feel more sympathy. Harry’s scar acted up a lot, recently it had calmed down a little but that didn’t take the edge off; more like made them more wary. After nightmares, flashbacks, visions and many other things is when his friends would have to step in and help. Ron shook the thoughts from his head to focus on Harry, he was what’s important.
He needed to realise that he couldn’t cum, he needed to stop allowing himself to get aroused so easily - he could not help it around Potter though. He let out an inaudible breath of relief when he realised those dangerous eyes were now off of him and back on his friends.
“Yes,” she nodded. “He’s been stable for 48 hours, so he should be stable enough.”
Draco tried his best not to let the guilt of creating extra work for her eat at him as he watched her leave the room. When she was gone from sight, he turned to study Harry, taking his hand again. For the first time since he’d been awake, he felt Harry’s fingers curl around his. Fire licked the inside of his belly and he knew he was in big trouble. As he’d come to see his safety as a real and tangible thing, he saw more and more clearly the way that things with Harry would end. He knew the other boy wouldn’t be holding his hand if he were awake and oriented, certainly not if he knew they were going to be just fine. Draco was coming to terms with the fact that what they’d had in the dungeons, real and visceral as it had been, was something temporary. He knew he should be preparing for that reality. He unwound their fingers, admonishing himself for his frivolous displays of affection. He might not be able to help himself with Lily, but he could do a better job of keeping his wits about him with Harry—Potter, he reminded himself.
. It’ll take time until you feel 100% like yourself again.”
“You don’t have to share anything you don’t want to,” she said in what he assumed was supposed to be a reassuring tone. “And again, you certainly don’t have to talk about it now. Like I said before, you need to rest. You don’t need to add the emotional distress.”
“You’re giving me far too much credit.” He said softly, the heat he’d tried to muster gone from his voice. The tears broke over and he wiped his sleeve against his face quickly.
She nodded sadly. “You both came very close I’m afraid. But you’re both out of the woods now, and we need to focus on helping you heal.”
“Remus I am done arguing about this! I’ve given my word and until Harry wakes or you gather enough people for a vote to force me to act otherwise, it’s final.”
As if sensing that he was losing touch with the conversation, the healer redirected him. “I’ll be removing Harry’s stasis charm tomorrow. It’ll take about a day or so for him to come out of it, but after that he should be lucid.”
“That’s all I can ask of you,” she said kindly.
“Am I ever going to stop sleeping this much?” He asked, incredulous at the time that had passed since he’d spoken to her last.
She smiled encouragingly, untangling herself and standing up, removing the chair with a flick of her hand. “Let me put a few things in order, set up the space in a way that will be good for you, and I’ll be back, okay? It’s going to wear you out, but if it’ll help you feel more at ease, I’m happy to accommodate.”
“I appreciate that,” he said honestly, “but I don’t know that I’ll ever feel
Draco barked out a laugh—the werewolf, of course! “Well then he has even less reason to trust me than most. I was not kind to him, and my father fought hard to have him removed from Hogwarts. I certainly don’t blame him; he could’ve been much less kind and I wouldn’t have reason to fault him.” He paused then, thinking about how to phrase what else he needed her to know. “I appreciate your trying to protect me just now, but certainly protecting Harry is far more important than that, so if I do need to talk to him now, it’s okay; I can do it.”
He knew that to do this he’d have to put himself back there, but he also knew that he’d done it once before. He found that her brilliant blue eyes were almost as easy to trust as Harry’s startlingly green ones. He took a deep breath. He still struggled with knowing where to start. “The day before I was set to go to Hogwarts for the first time, my father invited me into a room of the manor I’d never seen before. He and my mother each had their own wings of the manor—as did I—so it wasn’t completely unheard of to be taken to a place I’d never been before. The room was plush and dark, with two big cushioned armchairs. He told me so many things I wanted to hear. He gave me a drink of firewhiskey and told me that I was going to become a man of the house.” He laughed coldly, thinking back on how good that felt at the time, and how little he wanted it now. He felt almost completely detached from the words he was saying, keeping himself away from the emotions of the memory. “He told me that he wanted me to have a special memory of the two of us. He told me that he wanted me to feel like the man I was becoming.”
“Easy, Mr. Malfoy,” a quiet female voice soothed from across the room. Draco’s head whipped in the direction of the sound, wrenching another low moan of agony from deep in his gut. “Please, you’re going to hurt yourself. You’re safe here; lay back down and rest.”
“I’ll do my best; please, just let me see him.”
With a final smile she turned and walked toward the door. Draco felt dumbfounded. He felt off-balance, and his head swam with conflicting thoughts. He was exhausted. The conversation with her and the other man felt ages ago, not simply a few moments or an hour. He shook his head, trying to shake some sense back into himself. He’d been too open with her—a side effect of all of the sleeping draughts and healing potions he’d taken, he was sure—and he’d be sure to keep a tighter hold on his emotions going forward. But here, in the warmth of his small, hospital-type bed that was now directly next to a still stasis-addled Harry’s, he allowed himself to feel the smallest bubble of hope. It seemed that this healer, despite a host of good reasons not to,
Draco nodded, the exhaustion sinking further into his bones. “I’ll go back to sleep,” he agreed. “But first, can I ask you—I don’t even know your name.”
The next words tore from Draco’s mouth before he could stop them. “This just doesn’t make any sense to me.”
“What doesn’t make sense to you,” she asked, her eyes bright and curious.
“That is
Her willingness boosted the last of the courage he needed. “I haven’t had a lot of opportunities to talk about this, so I can’t guarantee I’ll have words for all of it, but I’ll try my best to.”
“So, this wasn’t your first choice?” He asked, unsure why he felt so curious about her, why he found himself blurting questions with little regard for decorum.
She shrugged, the corners of her mouth pulling up in a small smile. “I’m a very emotional person, Draco—sometimes too much for my own good. But I lead with my heart and it works for me. I feel so sad for the pain you’ve endured, and so humbled and grateful that you shared with me.” She wiped gently at her eyes with a small cloth like the one she’d given him.
“You lot really are so
“You’re both my patients, and I’m here to care for both of you. One of you is not more important than the other.” She said simply, as if there were nothing else to discuss.
“Where are we? Can I see him?” He knew he wouldn’t feel calmed until he could see Harry for himself, until he could touch his skin and feel his pulse beneath his fingers.
Draco knew this wasn’t even a difficult question, that of the things he’d have to explain or relive, the age at which he started experiencing this was hardly something to spook at, but he couldn’t help it. The question brought up those first memories, that first time—at least the first time he remembered. He cleared his throat, speaking haltingly. “I… don’t know exactly.” He said honestly. “The first time I remember, I was… eleven. But I tried so hard to block those memories out—I don’t know if I was just successful before then or if that was the first time.”
Lily’s smile drooped, her eyes darkening. She gave a heavy sigh, conjuring a plush black chair with another casual wave of her hand. Draco was beginning to wonder if this woman ever bothered with a wand or if she just liked showing off. She pulled the chair closer to his bed and sat herself down, folding herself cross-legged onto the soft surface of the chair, absently fiddling with the hem of her mustard-colored sweater. “You were not well, Draco. You had a couple of internal injuries, multiple broken bones, multiple bones that had been broken and improperly healed, multiple torn ligaments, damage to your vocal cords, and a handful of infected or poorly healing wounds. You also had a variety of magical damages. I’ll go on if you need but cataloging your injuries in detail will likely be more traumatizing than helpful.”
“It might not be your expectation, but I imagine it’s others.” He took a breath, feeling unsure but bolstered at the same time. “I think…I think I’d like to try to talk to you first—before all of that—I imagine you’ll be gentler than they will. And maybe you can put in a good word for me.” He laughed halfheartedly, knowing he wouldn’t get that lucky.
The shower did wonders for Draco’s mood. He felt happier than he had in a long time, and he relished his time underneath the hot spray, the scents of balsam, cedar, and evergreen that swirled around him. He scrubbed until his skin was pink and tingling, knowing he’d gone a little overboard but unable to help himself. This was his first opportunity to wash everything that had happened in the dungeon off his body, though he wasn’t sure he’d ever feel fully clean again. Lily had called in a couple of times to check that he was okay, assuring him that she wanted him to take as long as he needed. That warm tingling feeling shot through him, acknowledging again how good it felt to be cared for in this way. When he finally turned the water off, he heaved himself up off the bench, pulling back the steamed glass door and looking around. He hadn’t thought of a towel at the beginning, but his mistake was apparent as he clutched the door, dripping wet. He shouldn’t have worried. A second of closer inspection found him a soft grey towel, fluffy and somehow warm, folded neatly on the shelf to his immediate right. He wrapped himself tight and stepped out, sitting himself down a moment later on the toilet seat, out of breath but satisfied. When he’d finally regained some of his energy, he heaved himself up again, making his way for the first time to the mirror over the sink. He hadn’t seen a mirror in even longer, and his curiosity overwhelmed him. Once again, he was shocked at how thin he’d become. His face was gaunt, sunken in a way he’d never seen before, and his eyes were ringed with dark circles. His hair was longer than it’d been in years, shaggy and a bit uneven, and his face was scruffy with stubble. He supposed he could ask Lily to perform a shaving charm—he didn’t imagine they’d let him have a wand to do it himself.
With a deep, shaky breath in that definitely didn’t reach his lungs, he tore his gaze off of Potter’s divine and mouth-watering cock and made his way up his body. His heart pounding abnormally in his chest, his head dizzy from all that he was feeling.
They all shared a look of shock, this was not the intended purpose. The look of ‘oh shit’ was present on all of their faces.
“What? I must not tell lies.”
“Fucking cunt! This fucking potion.” He still had an unnerving smirk playing on his lips as his gaze shifted over to Draco and his friends.
The last word the came out of the Gryffindor’s mouth sounded seething, it made the blonde shiver. Harry stepped closer, his presence purposefully looming over Draco’s own.
Draco was already shaking and felt a warm tingle spread all throughout his body at being under such deep observation from those, oh so alluring, almost obsidian eyes.
The 5 sat back down, until Snape motioned for them to all sit at the front. Hermione made her way over to Harry and Ron whilst Draco and Pansy sat at the table beside them.
“Because if you don’t then that punishment you’re getting will feel like a dream compared to what I’ll put you through. Also, you can kiss the thought of you cumming goodbye. You think I don’t have a cock ring to physically stop you.”
“By the way, he doesn’t have a small dick but nice try. Nevermind, you know anyway.” Neville had attempted to whisper, but as usual it didn’t quite work out as he heard his voice come out louder than he meant. The last part of his sentence was said a little quieter so he didn’t know if anyone had heard him.
“Oh, he wants it faster, harder? You’re gonna get just that, pretty.”
A deep chuckle made its way from his own lips at how much he affected the Slytherin, he basked in it. Harry then allowed his dark gaze to meet Draco’s, an unspoken demand that had not been fulfilled allowed his eyes to grow even darker.
Draco snatched his cloak from where it was hung and draped it around his body, he knew it wasn’t cold out but he didn’t want anyone other than Harry seeing his clothing. He thought that the other would want that too from how damn protective he acted already, Draco fucking loved it.
“Dear merlin, look at him.” Pansy’s eyes were wide as she spoke, seeing Potter look - not vulnerable - but so on edge. She couldn’t find the words to describe it, so transfixed on how sweat was now pouring off the other.
“I want to hear your words.”
“See, what I think you wanted, Draco. Was exactly this. For me to grab you like this, take what’s mine.”
Hermione could see the cogs turning in Fred and George’s head as she sighed softly, clearing her voice to make sure she caught their attention.
“P-Please don’t m-make me.”
Their gazes collided and Draco already felt himself losing the battle, he’d been in the Gryffindor’s presence for not even 2 minutes and he already felt himself starting to crumble.
Draco’s mind was swarmed full of need, pleasure and an undeniable craving for Potter, he then absorbed the words that had caused goosebumps to rise all across his body.
“Kinda like lucid dreaming, in a way.” Ron added as Hermione nodded, catching gazes with the twins again.
The entrancing musky smell of Harry intoxicating his senses as his eyes fluttered shut, he could feel the heat from the other colliding with his own.
He practically bolted out of the Great Hall, walking as fast as he could without it being considered running. His race to the Slytherin dorms had never been so urgent before, his only goal was to get there without being stopped
He honestly didn’t mind that much, he probably should have. Except for the fact that he trusted these people with his life, he would die for each of them. Some sexual desires wasn’t gonna do anything.
His left hand was then being moved by Potter’s, placed on his cock. Shivers broke out all through Draco’s body, he could barely fit his hand around him. He got over the initial shock and began moving his hand, timidly stroking up and down.
After the laces were tied, he walked over to the levitating mirror in the corner of his room. He looked up and down his body, trying to decide if he looked good enough. It didn’t really matter what he thought anyway, he was just curious at how Potter was gonna receive him. The reminder of him had the dirty thoughts racing back to try and swarm inside his yet, he didn’t want them - not yet!
“Harry, nobody laughed or made fun. They were just, shocked. It’s not everyday that rivals accidentally admit their love for each other.” Harry couldn’t help but match his friends chuckle.
Draco sputtered on his words, deciding to completely give up in order to not disintegrate the last microscopic particles of his dignity. If he was being totally honest with himself, he knew that they’d already been destroyed.
Their gazes met instantly, Draco’s cheeks a fiery red as if he had just used a pick up line on him - not like his cock wasn’t nestled down his throat.
It fortunately was, Potter flicked his eyebrows and nodded - smiling as Draco smiled back. This whole situation was definitely not how he’d imagined telling the other of his feelings but it was better than anything he could’ve ever hoped for.
Harry spoke in a gravelly voice, letting his gaze wander freely to the table in front of him. Draco and his friends all gulped at now being the centre of Potter’s attention, the blonde felt his hands shake at the tone of Harry’s voice alone.
“That gorgeous blush of embarrassment on your cheeks yet you get off on me talking to you like this, don’t you.” His words were not a question, they were a statement. And by the whine that fell so graciously out of Draco’s spit slicked lips, he knew he was right.
Potter then covered Draco’s body with his own to block out everyone else’s view as leaned further down to graze his teeth over the pale flesh of his neck. An almost inaudible whine left the open of the blonde’s mouth, it made Harry growl, once more, against the sensitive skin.
“I’m sorry as well, I was a dick too.” Malfoy smiled, as Harry moved his hand to the side of his face. The touch so gentle.
“Fucksake, he’s there again. Harry!” Hermione slapped her friends shoulder, groaning in annoyance when he remained unfazed.
“Are we not invited?” Draco’s stomach was filled with very aggressive butterflies, he didn’t know whether to thank or be mad with Pansy for leaving them alone.
“Too hot. Anyway, like you all said. You’d still be able to see it anyway, considering how big my cock is.”
“So good.” Harry practically cooed at him, the tantalising tone making his entire body tremble.
Draco had tried to put on his most bored and uninterested tone when really, his heart was stammering so hard inside his chest that he thought it would fly out. He also knew that his attempt at making himself sound unaffected and confident was for nothing, the way he had stuttered and how his voice had shook was oh so telling.
Nobody had spoken, Harry was honestly just shocked at how he’d managed to make Snape speechless. No longer looking angry, but smug. A slight grin starting to appear on his face. The look on Ron’s face, however, was a lot different. One of pure shock.
“Hey, Harry.”
He opened his eyes ever so reluctantly, raising his gaze as they landed straight on Potter’s groin. Fucking hell. The breath was literally stolen from Draco’s lungs as if he had been punched straight in the stomach, his hands now gripping his own thighs for dear life - attempting to cover up the obvious bulge.
“No, it’s just that you’re my best friend.” Ron scratched his head as he looked awkwardly over his shoulder, trying to rid himself of the attention.
Instantly, the kiss was one of passion and heat. At one point their teeth had clashed together slightly from how Harry had grinned evilly as he continued kissing him.
Draco couldn’t breathe, the boxers did nothing to hide Potter’s size. He was utterly puzzled at how that was supposed to fit inside his mouth, he always did enjoy a challenge though.
He brought a shaky hand up to scratch at his neck, trying to pretend as if he was invisible. But of course, nothing could ever go that smoothly. Just as he put the pressure on his throat, he had gasped. A rousing ache filling his senses, it took him a moment to remember why he was feeling small spikes of pain - that just added to the heat between his legs.
He exhaled another shaky breath when he heard the other laughing lowly, the very fact that he was so amused at having caught Draco looking was starting to make him lose it. His whole body felt clammy as he could feel Potter’s eyes burning holes through his skin with how intense his gaze was.
“S-So, we going in?” And there it was, he cursed himself in his head. Already stuttering and all he asked was an innocent question, he wasn’t gonna last through the night.
Draco inhaled deeply as a way of trying to calm his body before he exploded, it didn’t help when the almost overbearing but certainly intoxicating scent of roses filled his senses as Potter once again, leaned close to his ear.
“-go back in the story.”
“Bet you didn’t think Ron would be the one telling you how good of a kisser Harry was, did you.” Ginny chuckled, enjoying how the tips of Ron’s ears were now red too.
“Me. You may think that your little lust potion is what snapped in me earlier, that’s partly true. But what you don’t know is that I’ve been wanting to do this to you for years, the potion only pushed me to do it. And now I have you.”
The blonde’s eyebrows twitched, wordlessly questioning ‘how’. Harry clicked his fingers and he watched as the enchanted visuals faded away, the ceiling just like the rest of the dorms.
“Draco.” Oh fuck, Potter sounded… He couldn’t make it out, that scared him all the more worse. His tone was so collected yet lined with malicious intent and it was driving the blonde crazy, his hands had started to cramp by how tightly he had them balled in his lap.
“My words for Malfoy and Potter, take a hint.” He then motioned towards the door, excusing them.
Potter growled out his words, enunciating them by squeezing the flesh between his fingers almost cruelly - Draco’s knees buckled on instinct.
He forced to himself to stop thinking about the past and to focus on the present, Potter’s words. Even though it was slightly obvious, he could’ve just wanted him so that he could fuck him - which was highly unlikely anyway - but it was just nice clarification.
“You won’t be keeping those noises from me anymore, sweetheart. Now, do are you were told and look at me. Before I make you.”
His hands shook from where they sat in his lap, unable to stop his nerves from showing. Gradually, he forced his eyes up the other’s body until they reached his face.
“Open wide.”
Two rips now showed directly under the curve of Draco’s arsecheeks, both the underneath of the pudgy flesh showing as his upper thigh was also completely exposed. His cheeks in no way were on show, but the curve of them below certainly was, again, along with the upper of his thigh.
Shoving them a little past his thighs, he kept his gaze on Draco - almost laughing from how shaky he was. Now all that was between his cock and the blonde’s mouth was a piece of thin, black fabric.
He took one last step and ever so slowly dragged his eyes from the floor and looked up Draco’s body, repeating how the other had looked at him in their third year. Except this time, the roles were reserved. They were both also incredibly turned on and Harry was forcefully taking his assertive place. Draco felt his head spin from the look.
“Granger, Potter, Weasley-“
God, how he craved to bite down on his skin. Cover that pretty neck of his in hickies to show that he belonged to Harry. To choke him afterwards and push down on the, most likely, aching bruises just because he could. And the other boy would fucking sob from the euphoric sense of pain mixing ever so beautifully with the pleasure.
“You are for my eyes only now. And you know that, don’t you. That’s why you wore your cloak, because my and only my eyes are going to be seeing your gorgeous skin from now on. So good for me already; you aren’t off the hook though, baby.”
“Maybe I forgot, maybe all I remember is that you said to meet you here.” He had done everything in his power to make his voice sound stable but even to him, he could tell he was breaking at the seams.
He noticed that his eyes had slipped from Harry’s own, even his subconscious couldn’t handle staring back into those tempting eyes. After realising, they shot back up. He really wish he hadn’t.
This was incredibly cliche but Draco couldn’t wipe the smile off his face as Harry stepped even closer, his hand snaking up to the back of his blonde hair.
Hermione was staring up at the ceiling, seemingly lost in thought before she coughed quietly and looked back at the rest of them; zoning back into the amusing conversation.
Despite the situation, Harry felt his heart pound warmly and happily inside his chest. Fred and George, no matter how big of a nuisance they both were, loved him like a brother.
Draco Malfoy was going to have Harry Potter’s ludicrously large cock, in his mouth. To his own ears it sounded absurd, he would’ve never thought he’d be in this position.
Harry frowned at the mention of Lucius, whilst Draco dumbed it down, Harry knew how awful a father he was and blamed him for a lot of what went down between him and Draco.
Draco blinked twice immediately, wanting to show the other just how much he wanted it. That elicited a chilling yet rousing chuckle to come from Potter as he tightened the grip he had of his hair, licking his lips as he spoke.
“Oh no, that night…” Ginny let her grin show on her lips, running a hand through her auburn hair.
Potter’s tone was oozing with husk, so low that Draco could feel the vibrations through his quaking body. Harry’s hands had moved from that pretty face, down to his hips; gripping them possessively.
He had also imagined choking him, not in a fighting way - definitely not. Hearing the choked out whimpers and whines flee from his pretty mouth as Harry controlled his airway.
“Usually, I’d ask for you all to take a sip. But in this case, I think I’m just curious as to what will happen without them.”
“Fucking hell.” Draco couldn’t help but think out loud, not even caring what his friends thought as he realised why Harry’s harsh smirk had grown wider.
Harry then, much to his dismay, planted his gaze onto Draco’s friends. Whom all looked absolutely terrified, they should be. He let his lips twitch up into a malicious looking grin, he loved being in control.
“I’m not even going to bother asking questions, let’s just go with it.” Hermione mumbled, shaking her head slightly as she spoke - not being able to help it as she chuckled a little in disbelief. She was also glad that her friend had finally made a move, nobody could hear what he had said towards the end but from Malfoy’s reaction she guessed that Harry had done exactly that.
The blonde couldn’t do anything under that expression as he gave in, asking no verbal questions. He had only just put his hand on his arm when oh, they were apparating.
After finding some black socks and putting them on, he sat on his bed and debated whether or not to wear underwear with the jeans. He didn’t wear them often and the times he had, he had gone commando and had once borrowed some of Pansy’s underwear.
He wasn’t that lucky though, knowing that he was going to meet Potter and do things that he knew was gonna end in being made to cum had his cock still interested. The blonde sighed before rushing to the shower, he’d just have to ignore it. He’d done well so far, he wasn’t going to disobey now.
Harry would absolutely not be turning down the offering of fucking Malfoy’s throat in a way he’s fantasised about for years but he also wanted to make sure the other was comfortable with it. He felt the blonde swallow around him, nodding once again.
Draco had turned his body his door when he had begun listening to their voices, so he couldn’t see Harry’s face. He felt his presence behind him though, even without looking Potter filled him with nerves - good nerves.
“Please refrain from talking outside the door though, you know how thin these walls are.” Harry visibly cringed.
“It actually used to be a cupboard, me and Ron were fucking about one day and I used ‘engorgio’ - it was no longer a small cupboard. I told Mcgonagall and she said it could be used as a panic room and since I was the only one to get severe panic attacks, and from what the others had said, it was mine.”
Draco’s gaze then refocused on Harry, his heart stuttering in his chest at how his grin had grown wider.
Harry moved his fingers to trace the rips, wordlessly telling him what he wanted from him. All before letting his touch return to where it was previously, the curve of Draco’s arse.
There was still comfortable noises coming from the Gryffindor dorms, however, there was a deafening silence between Draco and Harry and none of them knew which were going to break it first.
The blonde hated how he was affected by the other, he could feel his cock beginning to stir and he couldn’t find the determination to stop it. Hell, he hadn’t even been touched by Harry yet. His words and his eyes had got him so worked up, it was shameful. He was forced from his thoughts by the voice that made his body tingle.
Draco’s eyes trailed down immediately, gulping as he watched Harry move his hand up and down his hard cock. The raven haired man sniggered at how entranced the blonde had become, just from such a simple touch.
Two of them were then both looking up to the ceiling as Harry spoke.
He popped open the button, his jeans opening without any effort from the strain the were under from his hard on. The grin on his lips getting wider at how Malfoy’s mouth was practically watering, he loved how eager the other looked.
“Obviously, but I want to make you say it.”
He was surprised that spit had managed to escape his mouth, from the lack of room inside. His lips suction cupped around the other’s cock so tightly that he couldn’t believe how it had leaked out and everything had gotten so covered.
He must’ve gotten lost in thought, realising that the entire time he’d been staring directly at Potter’s dick. His heart skipped a beat, knowing for a fact that he was definitely being observed.
“How much of the lust ingredient did you, accidentally, put in?” Pansy asked almost inaudibly as she caught on to the conversation topic instantaneously.
“Go on then, don’t wanna be late.” She must’ve fucking heard, he did not wanna take time thinking about it though.
Harry’s head perked up, searching around the room to make sure nobody - specifically a teacher that would, to his luck, be right behind him - had heard. He couldn’t hold back the cringe that showed on his face when he saw some of the Slytherin table staring, he could only hope that they were just giving him the usual dead eye.
“I need your help.”
Harry could only stare darkly at the other, seeing how his lips were swollen obscenely and he still had both spit and precum staining that pretty mouth of his. Draco’s lungs refused to work from the gaze, his heart stuttered in his chest.
His gaze flickered back up to his face, taking great pleasure in seeing his cheeks glow a dark, crimson red at what he was doing to his lower half. He chuckled lowly and menacingly at how embarrassed the other looked.
He had cringed throughout his whole sentence, purely from how much he had stuttered. It did make him feel better when he remembered that Potter had called it adorable, it slipped his mind that he’d just babbled out his original plan.
“It’s time for your punishment. Wanna know why?”
In an instant, he had pulled his thighs far apart. Draco Malfoy, exposed for his eyes only.
Draco let his eyes drop down, the best he could, to try to see how much of Potter’s cock he had taken. His eyes widened in disbelief as he realised that he’d already taken a little over half of him in, he swallowed; only to be reminded of the size of the dick he had in his mouth.
30 minutes, he’d taken 30 minutes. Longer than usual but in no way the longest one he’s ever taken, he always manages to get lost in his thoughts when he showers. This time, however, they were filthy and tickled his body in delicious increments of pleasure.
“Don’t even say that to me. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to sit here and do nothing, when all I wanna do is go and fuck the ever-loving crap out of him.”
With one last smile and a nod to both of them, he began his walk back to his seat - preparing to testify. He had chosen to go first, a way of making sure that neither Draco or his mother had too. He wanted them to watch him so they could maybe feel a little better, he knew that there was logic in there somewhere but he was to focused on how he should say his words during the trial to get stuck on it.
“Anyway.” Hermione pointed her gaze towards the twins, not being able to help the small smile playing on her shiny lips.
“You know how he usually has nightmares? Well when he finally got to sleep, all of his dreams were sex dreams. He admitted that to us in the morning.” Ron snorted, even though it was extremely peculiar - it was still a good night.
Fuck that, actually. He got off on the thought of teasing the other until he was in tears, filled up to the brim with sexual frustration. All until Harry couldn’t hold himself back anymore and give the boy so much pleasure that he’d probably pass out, that sounded good too.
“What night-“ Fred started,
“That was interesting.” Professor Snape finally let the grin show on his face, momentarily shocking the students that their teacher was almost smiling - in a way. Hermione was squirming in her seat, wanting to go check on her friend.
“Trust me, Neville, it can. And at this point I’d rather have a heart attack, fuck, I’d even rather fight Voldy again. Nevermind, that’s probably gonna happen soon anyway.”
His worries faded away as he heard Narcissa laugh softly, a grateful glint in her warming and welcoming eyes.
“You can’t deny how amazingly-“ Fred started.
“As much as I’d love to cum in that talented mouth of yours, or on that pretty face, I’ve got a better idea.”
“Draco.” He was nudged by Goyle next to him, cursing himself at how he jumped.
Draco started to calm down, his head becoming less and less dizzy as the urge to faint passed. He knew where he was and felt secure, safe and on the ground. His thoughts had slowed down tremendously, now at a normal pace. He still allowed himself to copy how Harry was breathing though, to make sure it wasn’t going to happen again.
“You are, just after you’ve talked.” She shared a glance with the other two, waving as she tugged them both along.
The authority that Potter’s voice held had the blonde’s heart racing, turning his body to the left so that he wouldn’t have to strain his neck. With a deep breath in, his eyes slowly made their way to meet Harry’s; his lungs refused to work when he did.
“Anyway, back to the story?” Hermione yawned as she caught everyone’s attention, purposely ignoring the glare that Harry sent her.
“I-I-“ Draco couldn’t even fucking speak, he shook his head in bafflement and to show his friends that he was just as mind-fucked by it.
“How long do you think the potion will last?” Draco asked in a whisper, definitely not wanting to be heard.
“You love being called a slut, don’t you. My pretty little whore.”
The Slytherin’s all raised their eyebrows at hearing the girl they once thought to be so prim and proper, a goody two shoes, using such vulgar language. Just goes to show that you should never judge a book by its cover.
He choked slightly, tears welling up in his eyes a little. Harry muttered words of encouragement, stroking his sweaty forehead gently as Draco took in a deep breath - the best he could - through his nose as he finally calmed himself. He would just have to deal with it if he wanted Potter down his throat.
They had all expected Potter to get angry when he found out it was them, even more pissed when he was told Draco was the one who came up with it. None of them, not even in their wildest dreams, would’ve thought that was Harry he was going to react.
“Experience? What the bloody hell does that mean?” Goyle couldn’t hide his confusion. He was swiftly pulled out of his thoughts by Draco slapping the back of his head, he hissed in pain, the blonde was definitely way too interested in the golden trio’s conversation.
“You’re such a desperate little slut, aren’t you.”
Draco felt Harry tighten his grip on his hair, the other taking control by moving his hips.
“Now, kitten.” Draco was going to fucking die from the pet names, he cleared his throat as he inhaled a shaky breath.
Draco nodded frantically in response, the warm feeling of Harry’s hand helping to keep him out of his head.
“Hey Nev.” Hermione spoke softly as they all smiled at him, Neville smiled back but it was clear had had a motive for being there.
Draco’s eyes had snapped open to find Harry’s, whimpering a little when he did from how overwhelmed he was feeling.
“Well, they’d have had the same effect either way.”
“I suggest you look at me.”
Harry groaned contently at how the cool temperature of the twins’ hands contrasted to the scolding heat that his forehead was emitting as he leaned into the touch, both Fred and George were surprised at how hot he really was.
“Guys! You asked for this fucking story so stop getting sidetracked and listen!” Ginny snapped, smacking the two of them on the top of the head. Not hard enough to really hurt but hard enough to get the message across.
“Still such a brat, aren’t you, Malfoy.”
“Basically, one of the effects of the lust potion is a very clear, vivid imagination. The potion makes you horny, which gives you horny thoughts. Those thoughts are then played out in your mind, as if you’re experiencing them for real. The potion cannot create visuals that you’ve not already had, so horny thoughts about the person already have to be there.”
Potter had grabbed the other’s shirt and began pulling him up from his knees, bringing him back on his feet. Draco’s knees buckled slightly from how long he’d been knelt on them, he recognised the dull ache and probable pain that he was going to feel the next day - he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
“Right, you’re going to copy my breathing. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out.”
“But. If you do want this, then oh baby. You’re gonna go through such a gorgeous mixture of pain and pleasure and you’re gonna be screaming my name as I make you cum. First, I need your consent.
thank you so much reading! i hope that you enjoyed it and the upcoming chapter will be posted soon :)
this is a wild *smutty* ride and if that's not your thing i apologise, enjoy lol
Harry crowded him up against the door, easily towering over him as an eerie chuckle left his smirking mouth.
“Be quiet then so we can hear, bafoon.” He whisper yelled his words.
“Meet me, later. Then maybe after a good punishment, you’ll start behaving, brat.”
Harry was trying to conceal how horny he felt but knew that his control was inches from slipping away from him, what was worse was that he was starting to care less and less.
Once again, he looked up at the clock to check the time - he didn’t have to rush but oh did it feel like he did.
“Blimey.” Both Fred and George whispered, being the first ones to come to their senses. The two were shameless in the way the way that they stared, along with the thoughts that came to mind.
For a few moments after, Harry had no idea he had even spoke. If it wasn’t for the look of pure shock on all of his friend’s faces, he wouldn’t have had a clue! Lust potions were fucking dangerous. Fred and George were the first to speak.
“-sucking you off under the table.” George finished.
“I’m not supposed to say this but I would like to thank you for what you said today. I’m legally not allowed to endorse shoving a fist down somebody’s throat, however, you made those with “not socially normal” sexualities feel comfortable. That’s admirable. I wish that growing up we would have had someone like you around.”
Then they moved to his cheeks and his nose, his gaze soon differed. Which was soon to make Draco sputter on his breath.
Harry leaned his forehead against Draco’s, the both of them smiling.
Draco felt like he was under terrible scrutiny but the hot bubbling flames that were filling Draco’s senses with arousal screamed that he wasn’t opposed to it.
“These jeans, no underwear. Such a fucking tease.”
“Needed a moment? That’s fine, we all do.” Harry was suspicious of Snape’s words, Ron’s smile made him realise that maybe he was just being nice today.
“He’s where?” Fred’s tone was incredibly curious, George - although not having said anything - had the exact same expression.
Even he had to admit that they looked like he bought them like that, they definitely didn’t look like Draco had just fucking ripped them. Pansy had not even asked him but told him that he wasn’t getting rid of them, he “reluctantly” agreed. Deep inside he had admitted to himself that he really liked them and was thrilled that Pansy liked them too, now he just needed somewhere to wear them too.
The thought made him remember the erection straining painfully in his jeans, he hoped that the look in his eyes showed the other how much he craved him. Usually, he’d do anything he could to hide the want he had for the other. But at this moment, he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
“Thanks Neville, for telling us.” Ginny smiled graciously at him, who reciprocated the action.
Then Harry found his lips stretched into an almost cruel smirk as his eyes drifted lower, he saw the slight tenting in the other’s tight school trousers. So now he knew that he was definitely affecting him, he made sure to quickly look down to his legs as to finish his observation.
The shaking boy on the bed couldn’t help but think that now his school cloak would probably smell of Harry, it disturbed him how giddy it got him.
The rest of the class had already said what they had smelled, there were now many more blushing faces now. Some realising that maybe Draco and Harry weren’t the only ones to figure out their crushes.
He had no fucking idea why Potter was staring at him like that, was it to tease him? He had doubts from the seriousness of their shared look, the smirk present on his teasing lips.
Everything inside of him was screaming to avoid thinking about the tempting words that came from the other, all he had to do was ignore them - it was more difficult than he expected.
Now here they were. After that disaster, Pansy had persuaded them to try forget about it and rather go to the Great Hall to study. They had all, albeit reluctantly, agreed.
“You like it smooth or rough?”
The focus he had on his thoughts slipping away as he watched the expression on the other’s face, it was ever so teasing as Harry continued to grin; turning his head to stare at Draco. Instead of looking away like he did before, he kept his eyes trained on the blonde - now with that gaze on him, he struggled to control the lust clouding all of his senses. The words that left Potter’s mouth next had him shivering from how much he craved the other.
He quickly got distracted by the thought of the hard heat that was so close to him, he made the mistake of letting his eyes flick back down to Potter’s cock that was prominent against his jeans. Draco couldn’t tell, but Harry had followed his gaze sharply. Once again, an enchanting yet unnerving smirk was on his lips.
Harry was silent, trying his best to ignore the sweat now pouring off him. His entire body heating up, stuck in a metal furnace of raging flames.
He knew that Potter had some kind of idea about the potion as he’d overheard his friends’ conversation earlier, he really didn’t want to admit - after he told him that he hadn’t made it - his reason for it.
Draco took a wild guess that he was stuff he had to do, the realisation had him squeezing his thighs together in an attempt to will away the venereous thoughts filling his brain, spiking waves of pleasure glided through his body and to his groin.
It was as if they were pulling him in, making him crave the thought of being caught like the prey he was and snatched up for Harry’s taking; luring him with those tempting eyes.
“Fucksake! It’s getting stronger.”
“You okay?”
He had absolutely no idea how much of that they had heard, or if they had heard his mortifying noises. Potter seemed to love them. Part of his hair was now wet from sweat, stuck to his forehead as he begged his brain to stop sending him such thoughts.
His friends, although still feeling bad from the whole situation and the permanent scar it had left, snorted.
“So, what are you gonna do?” Neville’s voice was curious, looking at the other as his eyes grew wide at the darkened gaze Harry shot back. His eyes widened even more as, once again, Harry chuckled deeply. It sent a chill down Draco’s spine, he and his friends almost in a trance with the way he was acting.
It was surprising how the rest of the hall hadn’t payed much attention, way too busy with their own shit to care about what Harry Potter was doing to Draco Malfoy. All of his friends and Potter’s friends, however, were completely silent. Engaged in what in the ever loving fuck was gonna happen next, the thought scared him. He felt his cock throb harder than that and jesus fuck, where had this apparent fear kink come from. He scolded himself in his mind, getting distracted momentarily.
Crabbe didn’t realise it at the time but instead of adding one drop of an ingredient, he added four. Four drops.
After turning his body to leave his seat, he turned back around to face the Slytherin table. That same cruel smirk still slapped onto his features, he looked dangerous. And Draco hated the way it made his prick twitch in his pants, close to becoming a full boner as blood rushed to the appendage.
He could see, even through the jeans, that his eyes hadn’t been deceiving or playing tricks on him before. He hadn’t seen a cock like that except for the couple muggle gay porn videos that Blaise had shown him, even then he knew that Potter had them all beat. He could see the girth, for a moment imagining the stretch it’d put his lips under. It’d probably feel like too much, overwhelming, Draco craved to see for himself. How far his cock would stretch his lips, it was incredible.
He felt himself grow sweatier, his cheeks flushed rose as the colour dusted his skin. It wasn’t a blush from emotion though, he wasn’t that embarrassed. The effects of the potion simply caused his whole body to heat up, which caused his stupid rosy cheeks - he cursed himself in his head. He could battle Voldemort and win yet couldn’t ward off a simple lust potion.
Draco looked up at him helplessly, both him and Harry knew that his voice would be ruined.
He looked down as soon as the boot of his shoe came in front of their table, not from not having the balls to look them in the eye but just to fuck with them.
He was then ripped out of his thoughts as Potter pulled both his boxers and jeans back up, efficiently tucking himself back into the clothing. The Slytherin was confused by the strange urgency at first, he soon realised what was going on.
Draco was obviously there, he had to be. He had also testified against his father, before he had been wracked full of nerves that had electrocuted every cell in his body. Fear had slipped its way up his legs, to his chest - steadily making its way up his body. He had already began to panic, it had soon reached his neck as it constricted tightly like a snake so that he couldn’t breathe.
Draco wanted to slam his head against the wall. Before today he had never had a problem with stuttering but since his encounter with Potter earlier, it seemed it was all he could do around him.
Harry’s cock was once again pushed inside his mouth, he immediately suctioned his cheeks around him; now slightly more used to the girth and size yet still very not used to it. He rubbed his tongue against whatever he could, moaning when Harry returned his hand to the back of his head whilst the other stayed tangled in his sweaty hair.
“That isn’t how you were acting when you were making out though, was it?” Ginny teased, a sharp grin appearing on her features.
Draco’s cheeks burned slightly, letting him know that his blush had returned. Somewhere in between getting on the bed and the known reciprocation of feelings, his blush had gone away. But of course within a couple of seconds, it had returned - Harry had a way of doing that.
Harry pulled back a little, the tip of his cock now directly at the back of his throat. Draco moaned whorishly as he attempted to nod his head, which only succeeded in Potter’s cock slipping further down his throat.
He watched as Draco’s eyes widened, blown out from pure lust. The boy was practically vibrating from eagerness, Harry thrived off it.
“It’s common knowledge at this point so don’t even look at me like that.” He raised his eyebrows at them all as they muttered their defeat, he couldn’t help but cackle.
Harry had to admit that the power made him drunk, higher than any drug could ever get him. He’d choose Draco over everything.
What kept him grounded, however, was the hot breath on his neck - and when had Potter moved.
The assertiveness in Potter’s voice made Draco whine quietly, he really did not wanna answer the question.
He could also make out a thrilling feeling, from the pure adrenaline that they could get caught any time - all they had to do was use ‘alohomora’ on the door.
“A-And if I don’t?” His voice was ridiculously shaky, showing how fucking wrecked he felt.
Harry unzipped his jeans, Draco’s hungry eyes glued to his lower half. He was gonna have so much fun with him, he luckily had patience - unlike the boy on his knees for him.
“Parkinson.” Snape looked up to her, there wasn’t malice in his tone though. Just a slight warning, she could see that there was no anger in his eyes.
“I can make it slightly opaque.” Harry’s words were a little like suggestion and a little like a statement at what he was about to do, he clicked his fingers again and the enchantment was ever so slightly visible from where it covered the ceiling. “That good?”
His eye contact with the door was now disturbed after hearing a broken whimper sound from just about in front of him, his curious eyes landed on something so delicious that it made his hands twitch at his sides in trepidation - already wanting to spoil how innocent he looked.
Lucky for him, it did. He stepped out the shower with a white, fluffy towel wrapped around his waist. A breath of relief slipping from his lips now that his boner had fully gone down, although, he knew it would not take much to get it back up again.
His mother had really helped as well, after Lucius was sent to Azkaban - he really saw a change in her. She looked free and happy, glad that she and her son could just be together without any fear. He had visited her along with Pansy once wearing those jeans, he was a little scared at first how his mother would react to his skin literally hanging out.
He was stuck between not being able to breathe at all and then hyperventilating, his fingers pressing harshly into the suit that the other was wearing. Harry had then moved his right hand off of his shoulder, moving it down slowly to grip his left hand. Draco had squeezed Potter’s hands tightly, through the haziness of his brain, he felt himself being pulled back down to earth from the contact. Narcissa had a hand placed on his back as Harry’s hand gently massaged his shoulder and rubbed his thumb over the back of his hand, Draco was so grateful for it.
But this was different, this was almost pitch black staring right into his soul. Potter was gazing at him hungrily, Draco felt as if he were prey in that moment - and Potter was the predator. Potter looked like he was fucking hunting his prey, Draco. And he fucking revelled in it. He also questioned what part of his brain had come up with such metaphors, surely he was losing it.
“On your knees.”
Draco whimpered loudly, his knees buckling once again. So hard, this time, that he lost balance. He fell to his knees, his breathing incredibly uneven as he made the brave decision to look up - being met by a smirk so sadistic and teasing that it had his body tingling as an arousing warmth spread throughout him.
His friends were shocked too, not expecting to hear such words come from golden boy’s lips. Draco knew for a fact though that his friends, although shocked, felt nothing more than intrigue and eagerness to know more whilst he was getting turned on.
He wanted it down his throat, wanted Potter to fuck his face and throat so hard that he wouldn’t be able to speak for weeks. Draco’s face flushed even harder - if that were at all possible - at his own thoughts, embarrassed but way too turned on.
He finally felt his breathing and heartbeat start to decrease, he let his eyes slip shut so he could fully focus on the task and on the words that we being spoken to him. Harry was still holding Draco’s other hand, squeezing it every so often to remind him that he wasn’t alone - he would then squeeze back.
“N-Not a lot.” Potter was slowly getting closer and closer, covering the blonde’s body like a sheet. It was turning Draco’s brain into mush, how was he going to get through this night.
Harry brought his hands down to Draco’s thighs, his grip tight as he rapidly moved up to grab the globes of the Slytherin’s cheeks and hold them in a bruising grip.
Harry’s eyes were set in stone on Draco, he had never seen such a darkened look come from those eyes before. It made his body tingle from the sheer intensity of the stare, he was sure that Potter’s once green eyes were now black.
Before Harry could even take a step, he paused - a strong smell crawling up under his nose. He recognised it instantly, Malfoy’s cologne. No matter what, it seemed he couldn’t get rid of the blonde haired git.
“I rarely ever use this room, the dorms are actually just outside. I prefer to sleep out there as I always have, this room is a giant mistake.”
At first it hadn’t worked all that well, then Draco had began to mimic what he was feeling through his hand that was pressed against Harry’s chest.
He gave them a shit-eating grin as he let his left hand move from his inner thigh and over to his throbbing cock that was now bulging out from his jeans, he played it off as an attempt to show that he couldn’t hide it in any way.
“Well boys, late for the third time this week. 10 points from Gryffindor.” That’s when they had eyes on them, the Gryffindor’s groaning and scowling at the two whilst the Slytherin’s chuckled at their misfortune.
Draco knew that he couldn’t speak, his voice far too weak and shaky - unstable, even. But the way the Gryffindor raised a dark eyebrow, challenging him, made him have the urge to speak.
“I think we both know that doesn’t change anything though. Because you wanna know what isn’t controllable?”
He was brought back to the moment when Harry grasped his cock, stroking himself in a way that look tortuously slowly.
The words were growled in his ear and fuck if Draco was going to disobey them, his body shivered instinctively.
Pansy grinned after finally piecing it all together, she was sure that she could feel her brain throbbing from using the minimal braincells it took to figure it out. She was tired, okay!
Harry felt the sweat starting to gather under his collar as he shrugged his cloak off and placed it underneath him, still boiling even though he was only in his shirt. Then he felt the tingling again, mostly at his thighs. He couldn’t help but let his body squirm from where he sat, his own mind working against him.
This caused some students to chuckle, including Snape.
He had his shoes on in no time, said shoes were another muggle brand called Doc Martens. They were a gift from his mother and he absolutely loved them, whenever he wasn’t wearing school shoes, he was in them. As with mostly all of his clothes, they were black. However, they were encased in black sparkles that shone so prettily - that’s what Draco thought anyway.
“It’s not at all a problem. I suffer from panic attacks too and have slowly learnt how to help others with them, I’m glad that I could help. And thank you for your kind words.” Harry didn’t really know what to say, he just felt a strange happiness at the moment. Warmth bubbling when both Narcissa and Draco smiled back, he couldn’t quite handle it.
Harry decided to help him out and pointed towards the dust of what was left of the glass, swiping his middle and index finger in an upwards motion.
“Okay, enough about the mans cock; you’ll give him an ego problem.” George spoke up out of nowhere, his addition to the conversation making them all share a laugh.
They had immediately rushed back to the Slytherin dorms to tell Draco, where they had quickly formed an idea. This was obviously something private for their enemy, something that made him vulnerable. They needed anything to gain power over him.
“I just wanna say sorry for it, what I did and said. To your friends too, they didn’t deserve it.” He looked down to the floor, a guilty expression once again on his face. Harry decided he hated the look.
Harry groaned, a whole lot fucking louder than he intended to. His head whipped up from where it was resting on the cool wood table, his ears already starting to turn an angry red. Again, not from embarrassment as much, more from the pure heat emitting from his body.
“It didn’t only come on quick, it lasted 24 fucking hours.”
After swallowing, he let himself choke on it a little as he breathed heavily through his nose - he finally adjusted to it as Potter slowed his thrusts down and pulled back a little. Draco soon made small noises of complaint which just made Harry chuckle, already increasing his pace.
He quickly added the second finger, scissoring them inside the blonde boy and causing such pretty moans to stumble from his open mouth.
“That’s great ‘Mione, wanna say it any louder.” Harry hissed out, no actual malice lacing his words. Somewhere deep inside, he found it funny. The natural embarrassment always won over though.
“Now, Draco, please answer. What do you smell?”
He dropped his towel to the floor, extremely glad that the Slytherin dorms were a nice temperature from using a strong heating charm, it was definitely needed down in the dungeons.
“Now, how about we go and get that piece of shit of a husband and father, thrown into Azkaban; right where he belongs.” Harry kind of regretted the words as soon as they came out, he didn’t know their feelings about it and didn’t to make them feel worse.
He’d seen them drowned in blood, when Potter was really mad, furious. How his eyes changed from a slightly murky, sometimes emerald green to a deep, rustic colour that reminded him of the blood pumping through his very veins. It had shaken him to his core, and he had liked it.
He cowered under the look he received from the other, his unruly raven hair tickling his forehead as he brushed it out of the way to put all of his attention onto to Draco. The blonde almost choked on his spit at the the sharp scrutiny that he was once again under, he knew that he wanted it though.
Despite his natural tendencies to rebel, he had a new sensation inside him that he hadn’t felt before - he had a realisation that only Potter could bring it out of him. One to give himself completely to the other’s power, allow himself to give in and do nothing other than obey. The thought made his cock throb, only adding to the excitement that coursed through his body.
“What even was the ingredient?” Blaise piped up, now interested in the conversation as both Fred and George had gone off topic and brought the story telling to a halt.
Draco was frozen to the spot, more turned on than he had been all night. His body didn’t know how to process all that he was feeling, how was he going to deal with having the man touch him if just seeing his cock had him in a motionless trance.
“So, pray tell, do explain.”
Harry sat back, for the first time he took his eyes off of the only thing he wanted to see and strained his neck to look around him. Draco’s friends all had wide eyes, those of shock that their friend hadn’t been beaten into the ground. It made his grin wider, they probably had no idea that Harry was planning to break the other apart in the best way possible.
“This is Harry speaking, your mother is standing right next to you. I’m holding you and you’re holding me, I’m keeping you grounded.” Harry explained, his voice still soft but loud enough so Draco could focus on it.
Ron smacked Harry’s arm after noticing how damn zoned out he looked, the other didn’t even flinch. Only sent a wink Draco’s way before reluctantly turning back to his friends, trying to hide his grin to avoid any questions.
Draco quickly zoned out on their conversation as it gradually died down, then remembering why exactly he was there. He shuffled back around on his knees, pausing when he had returned to the place he was in before. He was nervous to meet Potter’s eyes again, his groin tingling in excitement.
Potter whispered the words throatily into Draco’s ear, he revelled in the little noises fleeing from the other.
“-we would.” George couldn’t help but smirk as well.
The Slytherin groaned at the forceful pull as he shoved his head down just a little further. He jerked his hand at the base of Potter’s cock, pleasuring that which could not fit in his mouth - not yet anyway.
He then realised what he had said and how he was acting by the twins’ entertained expressions, he groaned loudly.
He was really glad that his friends were too wrapped up in talking about Potter to realise how much he was being affected by him. And how he was being looked at.
They sat like that for 5 more minutes before the court announced that Lucius was being brought out for his trial very soon. Draco had taken a deep breath like Harry had instructed him to do and squeezed his hand, he felt the anxiety ebb away slightly. He still felt the nerves rushing through his veins but nowhere near as bad and unmanageable as before.
“My-My c-cock, it’s y-yours.”
“Shit.” That was all that Ron could say as he noticed how blown out his friends' eyes were, his own widening in result. There was silence for a moment, nobody really knowing what in the hell they should say, Hermione was the first to come to her senses; as usual.
As they sat at the Slytherin table, their eyes wandered to the Gryffindor’s. Both Hermione and Ron sat together, away from the others. Preferring to be in their own little bubble, rather than mingled with a crowd.
The blonde pulled his hand off the wall, his grip on the books tightening ever so slightly. He turned around expeditiously, feeling his heart hammer violently as he recognised Snape. Honestly, he should’ve known from the drawl in his words. How did Snape appear behind him so soundlessly, it was as if he appeared out of nowhere.
Draco finally meets up with Harry at the Gryffindor dorms and gets more than he ever expected.
With the same devastatingly tempting and almost sinister grin, Harry leaned down to Draco’s ear. The heat of his body made Draco wanted to sob and beg the other to do something, he had to remembered that they were in the Great Hall.
Neville shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly, a couple years ago his friends would’ve been perplexed at his language. Now they had grown up together and were such close friends, they were used to it. A strangely wholesome thought, drastically different to the words he had just spoke.
A love potion, one that was to reveal exactly who Potter had feelings for. Obviously, they couldn’t conjure one up in a couple hours. They had to wait at least 3 days, to both gather the ingredients needed and to do so without getting caught.
“No mate, we wouldn’t be here if he was.”
“At the fact that this cunting potion might last another 24 hours, I can’t do that again!” He rolled his eyes straight to the back of his head, Harry majored in dramatics.
Draco’s jaw then went slack as a high pitched moan drawled its way out, Potter had just found his prostate. And was not giving up on his task to massage the bundle of nerves until Draco was practically convulsing on the desk, his lower back and arse cheeks sticking to the surface from the sweat collecting on his pale skin.
He rubbed his fingers over the rim of his hole in a feather light touch, basking in the way Draco’s whole frame trembled. Almost pushing back on his fingers, Harry didn’t allow them to slip in though. He got off on the thought of teasing the other until he was near tears.
“Oh fucking god, what if they heard every single word! You just had to bring up the shit to do with sex and Draco!” Harry panicked, the other tried her best not to laugh.
Potter was staring at him expectedly, almost daring him with his eyes. Draco knew exactly what that look meant; he was challenging him to speak. He hadn’t spoken a word since he’d asked what would happen if he rebelled, Harry had made him eat up his words.
“M-My friends heard G-Granger and Weasley talking about y-your crush, they told me and I-I thought we should slip y-you a love potion - so we could have i-information on you.”
Was he, Draco Malfoy, really getting so lucky that Harry Potter had just admitted his own feelings for him. Was-Was he the crush his friends were talking about all along??
He was beautiful. His skin was pale, his face gaunt; Draco could see a long gash mending itself along the side of his face and down his neck. Still, he was one of the most beautiful things Draco had ever seen. The steady rise and fall of his chest brought Draco more joy than he remembered feeling in a long time. “He’s really going to be okay?” Draco asked in a whisper, too afraid of giving his hope volume.
Draco came to in a quiet room painted the lightest blue. There was sunlight streaming through a big double-paned window that warmed his face in a way he hadn’t felt in hundreds of days. His body ached, and the pain that had developed in his neck from lugging Harry for miles underground burned fresh as it had that night.
“It’s about one in the afternoon.”
He knew this time was coming, knew that he needed to talk about it for a number of reasons, but that didn’t stop the pit of dread from opening up deep in his gut. “Of course,” he whispered, clearing his throat to try to regain his illusion of steadiness. “I’ll tell you whatever you need to know.”
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy, Harry Potter is here; he’s safe. You likely saved his life.” Her eyes were liquid ocean and Draco searched them hungrily. He hoped it was true, but he was so afraid. After everything, it was so hard to believe they could be safe.
. He thought, realizing he didn’t know where they were, or who he was with, or where Harry had gone. He sat bolt upright; a low, guttural sound of pain wrenched from his lips before he had the good sense to stifle it. He looked around frantically, hearing a faint whirring noise coming from somewhere he couldn’t locate, his vision tinged with a fuzzy light.
Draco gave a small nod. “I appreciate your putting trust in me,” he said to her then, eyes still focused on the floor. “Though I understand why you don’t,” he said then, tilting his head in the direction of the man. “And if you have questions for me, I am willing to answer them.”
The healer’s eyes went wide. “You heard us?” She asked quietly, looking behind her at the man still holding his wand, though now slack in his fingers.
but he didn’t want to have to do this again. He wanted her to
“It is,” she agreed. “So hopefully that will give you some peace of mind to rest some more today, yes? You should get back to sleep.”
Her eyes widened. “Of course,” she exclaimed. “How rude of me! I’m Lily Clearwater. I would’ve been in your year at Hogwarts, I believe—Ravenclaw—but our parents took me out of school following the escape of Sirius Black.”
“How long have we been here?” Draco asked then, entertaining for the first time the idea that they didn’t just arrive.
She nodded, her eyes kind. “It’s really normal for memories of traumatic things to be fuzzy or temporally disorganized.” She paused again, matching the halting nature of his responses. “So, from what you remember, the first time was when you were eleven—does that mean you were at Hogwarts when it happened?”
Draco paused for a moment, still watching the rise and fall of Harry’s chest, before uttering the question he most wanted to ask. “Why did you save me? Why would you put so much into healing me? You know what I am.” He said the last part softly, glancing down at his left arm that was covered now by a soft maroon long-sleeved shirt. He knew that wasn’t what he’d arrived here in. He knew that in her caring for him that she had cleaned him up, redressed him, had seen all of him. He also knew that she knew his name. Even without having witnessed the mark on his arm, he knew that she knew what he was. She’d known the whole time she’d been caring for him and speaking to him, and yet she’d treated him with nothing but kindness. He didn’t understand.
The words themselves, he imagined, could have felt hollow, or insincere, but he’d learned by then that things never seemed to sound this way coming from her. She was everything he’d hated so much about others in the past—vulnerable and open, warm, genuine, and enthusiastically authentic—all things he’d been taught not to be, to consider weak. But he found that on her, in these moments, he liked this about her. It was a comfort he’d never been given before. Even sharing with Harry in their quiet nights alone in the dungeons, Harry had never known what to say. He’d held him, let him cry—and those moments were special to him in another way, so novel and private—but hearing those words was soothing in a new way. He nodded slowly, taking her hand. “I am very tired,” he said then, closing his eyes and letting the tears fall freely. “But I think there’s another part you need to know.”
To his surprise, the healer laughed. “You don’t have any reason to trust us either, I suppose, Draco. I can see how my actions would seem insincere to you. It’ll take time for you to believe me, and that’s okay.”
to talk about it. I think I just have to.”
, are the reason.
She put a hand on his arm then, gently, clearly trying not to startle him but insisting on interrupting. She spoke quietly, her voice soothing and warm. “Draco, I appreciate so much that you told me. It took a lot of courage; you have been so brave. And I want you to rest now. You’re stronger than you were when you arrived, but reliving trauma is an exhausting thing.”
, wanted her to understand just what he and Harry had endured. What he saw looking back shocked him. Her eyes were brimming with tears, her cheeks damp as if she’d been crying for a while, perhaps even the whole time he’d been speaking. He searched her eyes hungrily, trying to understand. “You’re crying,” he said. It wasn’t a question, but he knew it’d come out as one, that his confusion was evident. His earlier resolution to hold his emotions in check was laughing at him from wherever it had run away to.
The woman waved a hand casually and the wall disappeared. Draco took note at such a casual display of wandless, nonverbal magic. With another wave of her hand, he felt the bed he was in spin slowly to face where the wall had been. He craned his neck slowly, begging his eyes to focus on the prone form lying motionless in a bed at the edge of the room. Seeming to notice his struggle, the woman walked forward, using her magic as if on an invisible string to pull his bed closer to the bed at the other end of the room. She stopped him a foot away from the other bed, and for the first time the face framed by messy black hair became clear to him. He saw the thin scar across the young man’s forehead. It was the first time he’d seen the other boy sleep without his face contorted in nightmares.
He brought his eyes up to meet her bright blue ones for the first time. He felt so…
“It’s like I told you before, Draco,” she said, locking her eyes onto his, smiling warmly, “You’re not like the others. Regardless of how you treated me or behaved, I would’ve done my part to assure that you didn’t die—that’s the oath I took and it’s one that I take very seriously. But beyond that, I have some idea of what you’ve gone through, as well as what you did to keep Harry alive, and that tells me enough about you to want to share pieces of myself with you.”
“Like I said, I can’t guarantee anything, but I’ll try my best.”
When Draco woke, his feelings of peace had all but vanished. He felt the energy in the air had shifted—tense magic pulsed around him and the voices he heard from the hallway were far from cordial. He could tell they were trying to argue quietly, their voices gruff in the tightness of whispers, but they certainly weren’t succeeding. He briefly wondered if they’d tried to cast a silencing spell before deciding that he was far more curious about what they were actually saying. He did his best to focus his still-fuzzy brain on what he could make out of the tense conversation.
the reason you’re in that position. People
Her eyes were sad and unsure, but she nodded solemnly. “You’re too weak to be up and about, but if you can agree to stay here and stay calm, I can dissolve the wall between the two rooms so you can see him.” Draco started to nod but stopped abruptly at the pain that shot through his spine. He hissed sharply. “Please be as still as you can. There’s a lot of healing magic working on your body, but it’ll take time.”
“That’s okay,” she said gently, reaching out to take his hand. The gesture disarmed Draco in a way he wasn’t expecting. “I’m here to help with that. It’ll all take time. The physical things are already healing, and we’ll help you get your strength back. As for the emotional things, I’ll support you the best I can, and we can try to find you a specialist in mind-healing at some point if that’s something you’d like.”
“As soon as Malfoy answers my question.” Hermione had a relieved expression on her face, glancing over at Draco - as she muttered a ‘hurry up’.
He would’ve done it voiceless but being on the lust potion he didn’t want to risk anything, he could practice all that once it had worn off.
The rough grunts that left Potter’s mouth had Draco throbbing in the tight restraints of his jeans, whimpering when he felt precum trickle down his throat; leaving the taste of salt in its wake. He didn’t even know what sounds he was making anymore, they were muffled by the harsh thrust of Potter’s hips and cock in his throat.
Merlin, Draco couldn’t stop his body from shaking; more turned on than he had ever been in his entire life.
Draco gasped as he was pulled from the memory, so vivid that if felt like he was there. He felt warmth engulf his body, a sense of calm washing over him like the soft crash of ocean waves. Most of the time, he buried that memory down - forgetting that it even existed. The reason being that he hated thinking about his father, it always made his heart twitch when he had the guts to remember it; to be met with the memory of how Harry had helped him. It made him stop burying it over time, just so he could block out Lucius and focus on that certain raven haired man.
His grin turned into a smirk and with the same hand that he had just practically groped himself with - his left hand - he flashed the back of it towards his friends so they could read the silvery scar that the stupid, intolerable pink cunt had left. Everybody in Hogwarts would definitely agree with that description.
Well, Harry had an idea. He could speak easily, he wasn’t the one struggling with it. He knew that the pretty blonde in front of him, however, was clearly doing everything he could to avoid it. He knew that Draco felt embarrassed anytime he stuttered on his words but it just made Harry adore him even more, like he said; he found it adorable.
“4 minutes.” Ginny replied as she glanced at her watch to make sure she was correct, she was. Ginny could’ve used tempus but honestly she just could not be arsed, being way more invested in what Harry was going through and how she could help if needed.
Harry was starting to get lost in his thoughts again, an effect of lust potions. That’s the thing that ticked him off the most but also enjoyed. He could not escape the sexual desire in his head and thoughts, it made focusing on anything extremely fucking difficult - a con.
So proud, that he hadn’t even realised how messy everything was. Spit was already covering his now sticky hand, some dripping down to Potter’s balls and even to his thighs. Most of it had dripped onto his jeans, cold against his bare skin because of the rips.
Before Draco found another way to embarrass himself, his attention focused on conversation that he could hear outside the door.
It sounded like a fucking growl. Draco’s cock twitched in his jeans as he instantly felt a heat coming up behind him.
“Hey! I wasn’t getting off with the thought of Ron, I-“ Harry couldn’t even finish his sentence.
Draco couldn’t take his eyes away, he knew if he wanted to keep the boner in his pants from becoming obvious that he should steer clear of Potter’s wanting and lust filled eyes but it was a near impossible task.
Then he was gone, well, kind of. As soon as Harry’s body was turned, Draco had let his eyes drop straight down to the ground to avoid the looks on his friends’ faces.
Pulses of excited nerves rushed through Draco’s body, the tension thick like smoke as it overwhelmed him in a way he enjoyed. Aggressive butterflies fluttered inside his stomach, he stayed silent with bated breath.
Fucking hell.
Draco leaned away from the door, that he was using for his only support, and with one last look up at his former enemy; he began walking. The bed was only a couple steps away but with every tiny movement in his legs, Draco’s knees refused to stop buckling.
“Mr Malfoy.”
Hermione was doing her best to not let her smirk show, she subtly covered her mouth with her hand as if pretending to itch her nose.
The first thing he had done once he arrived at his room was yank his school trousers off, he hadn’t bothered putting anything else on yet. That added to the temptation, only a thin layer of fabric between his hand and his almost leaking cock.
“Four drops, I think.” Draco and Pansy didn’t respond right away. Instead, deciding to look at each other and somehow hope that their brainwaves would connect and figure out the answer.
The front of Draco’s jeans were embarrassingly damp, Harry only grinned as he gave one last squeeze before letting go - much to Malfoy’s dismay.
The whole room was so silent that if a pin were to drop, it would make everybody jump. Harry felt the heat rush to his face, he was positive that the rest of the class could see it too. His throat had gone dry, unable to get any words of defence out.
Draco gulped, nodding his head hesitantly. Just from the tone of Harry’s voice, he could tell that something was off.
Potter had leaned into to his neck, nosing at the skin for a moment. His tongue met Draco’s pulse as he let his teeth graze over, the way the other shivered beneath him had his own cock twitching.
“Doesn’t surprise me, especially with this perky little arse of yours - how fucking tight they are too. And you just kept them, specifically wearing them tonight. I do wonder, Draco, if you did this on purpose.”
hey! so if you - the reader - don't want this as part of the actual plot then that's cool, it's not integral to the story and i just wanted to play around with the idea. i am honestly just glad you're reading lol.
“I think you already know.”
Harry finally gave in and ran his hands down Draco’s chest, then to his sides. He revelled in the shiver he got from him as he ghosted his fingers down the blonde’s inner thighs, the way they trembled under his touch made Harry produce a low groan - which almost sounded like a growl.
“I’m not done with you just yet, we’ll talk about this again but not today. Now I’d like to go to Pansy for a minute.” For a moment she thought she might’ve been in trouble but after seeing Snape’s eyes, she knew she was fine.
Harry Potter was hung like a fucking horse.
Pansy looked at the three, once again smiling towards them. It was a different feeling. Instead of dread that another argument was brewing, it now felt much more calm and relaxed.
Draco was filled with excited nerves that rushed through him so quick that it made him dizzy for a few seconds, what the fuck was Potter going to ask.
“Can’t be throwing insults when you’re choking on my cock, now can you, darling.”
His cock so close to his face, on purpose. Harry was sitting like that just to mock the blonde, showing that he was above him and that he was in control. Draco never thought that he’d get off on something like this, but now he had figured it out, it was ever so clear in his mind.
hey, i really hope you enjoy this chapter!
“You haven’t even got a cock in your mouth yet and you’re already speechless!”
Before, he would’ve never allowed himself to admit it. But after the absolute shitstorm his day had been, he let himself admit it. He didn’t want to say how riled up Potter’s power really got him, he’d save that for another day of self confession.
“Remember what I said.” The tone was unsettling and intimidating. Draco gulped at how pissed Potter would be if he had gone against him, he sputtered on the words that hurriedly made their way out of his mouth.
“Why does the room smell like it’s drenched in Malfoy’s cologne? And hair gel. Damn, that vanilla’s ruining my nose.”
Harry’s tone was commanding and dark, there wasn’t a bone in the blonde’s body that wanted to disobey the other.
He was taunting him, he could barely focus on it though - just from the way that Potter said his name. It seemed he got distracted over anything when in the other’s presence, his brain had stopped functioning a while back.
Draco would be incredibly stupid to pass this up, he may have been enemies with the man just this morning but he had realised that his obsession might have been something more than hatred - most likely a crush. He really didn’t want to admit to it but from everything that has happened today, he did not have it in him to care anymore.
“What is that?” Draco asked, his whisper harsh and sharp in the quiet darkness.
“Then I’ll admit it, and I’ll apologize. I’ll own the judgments I make and any consequences that come from them. But this boy won’t suffer needlessly because of us.”
She didn’t seem fully sold on his ruse, but she nodded. “Alright, well, if you need anything, please don’t hesitate to call out. I’ll be right outside the door just in case.”
. She supported him as he transitioned upright, waiting for him to steady and shouldering his weight as she led him out the door and across the hall into a big, well-lit bathroom. The black tile was surprisingly warm under his feet. Outside, the sun shone brightly; he felt it warm his face, felt himself smile. Grimmauld Place was different than he would’ve expected a headquarters for the other side of the war to be. Over the course of the time he’d been there, he’d felt a thrum of dark magic from somewhere within the house. He kept expecting to see it, pleasantly surprised to see the lightness and airiness of the spaces he was in instead. He’d missed light so much, windows and the warmth of the sunlight. “I think you’ll find everything you need in there,” Lily said quietly, pointing with her free hand to the shower. “There’s a bench in there—please don’t be absurd and try to stand the whole time; you will fall, you’ll get hurt, and it’ll create more work for all of us.” She unwound herself from him, confirming that he could in fact stand on his own. “How steady do you feel? Can you get undressed on your own?”
Every word from Narcissa’s mouth was genuine, it had pulled harshly on Harry’s heart strings. Ever since he first met Draco’s mother, he had seen her golden heart through the supposedly “evil” exterior. All she wanted to do was care for her son, protect him - just like his mother had. He found himself smiling widely at her, happy that he had helped her.
Draco let out a pathetic whimper as his lips closed around him, looking up and locking eyes with Potter whose own eyes were fully blown out - an enticing black void replacing the usual colours.
“There will be questions soon, though.” Blaise’s words made him cringe, he knew it was coming eventually. - he just didn’t want to admit it.
i hope you enjoy! :) (i currently can't write anything better since i have a damn migraine but i hope whoever's reading this is having a good day!)
He cringed at how badly he had stuttered, how he had just proven to Harry how much of a mess he could make him.
He could not figure out why Potter’s gaze had been so intently on him, between Hermione slapping him and the other “waking up” - he had chosen to look down to try rid himself of those impure thoughts that had swarmed inside his head. The tingling in his groin from his rising boner definitely wasn’t helping either.
Draco’s thoughts, however, were starting to take him on a ride and he hated how he wasn’t repulsed by them.
“Let me look at you.”
“You never mentioned that, Ronald.” Fred began,
They all grabbed their bags and walked towards the door, sharing small glances with each other. Hermione had Harry’s hand within hers tightly, feeling good after the talk.
