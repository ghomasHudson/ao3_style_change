"What could you possibly want? Money? You've got that. Sex? You'll be getting that, too, shortly enough."
"No," Harry answered automatically, not knowing that it was true until he'd said it. "I used to. But there's a lot of other stuff going on that's more important."
Harry snorted a quiet laugh and watched as the Headmaster rose slowly, wincing at a pain that Harry could only guess at, and made his way around the desk to stand before him.
Sighing, she rubbed her forehead with her thumb and index finger and returned her attention to assessing the day's lesson. She had noticed quite a bit of pink energy coming from the Longbottom and Brown booth... She smiled. Those two would prove to be quite the match; not so much in power, but in true compatibility.
Harry drew his arm back, letting the chicken leg bone fly in an arc across the dusky pink sky. It landed with a soft sploosh on the surface of the lake, and a long tentacle reached out to snatch it. Swallowing against a sudden tightness in his throat, Harry buried his face in his hands and sighed. Hermione scooted closer, wrapping her arms around him, and sat with him until he stopped shaking.
"Give me back my cloak, Malfoy." Harry said tightly. The sight of such a cherished object in Malfoy's hands sent an uncomfortable skitter though his stomach.
McGonagall regarded him pitifully from behind her desk, but inclined her head and sighed. "I shall ask him. I'll send for you in the morning, once I've received a response."
It had seemed surreal when the news had come at the end of last year that Voldemort had disappeared once more. Harry felt a sense of foreboding at the lack of news that followed. He thought Voldemort was gathering power, forces, legions of loyal soldiers in order to come back and strike when least expected. After months of waiting, Harry was on edge. He woke up every morning wondering if that day would be the day.
Draco Malfoy was staring right back at him, probably also waiting an answer. Harry shook his head. The Slytherin's eyes widened and his mouth fell open. He looked as if the world had just started spinning in the wrong direction.
Draco's mouth snapped closed as he backed away, and Harry saw his hand inching for his own wand. Harry advanced on him, feeling vengeful and hateful toward the other boy. Draco was his weakness, one that Dumbledore had exploited, and Harry wanted gone. Right now.
Harry sighed and took the vial, letting the drops splatter onto his tongue. Reaching out, he set it back on the table and at Mason's nod, watched as Malfoy copied him.
"You silly nit," she scoffed. "There are far worse people than Neville you could have been partnered with. He's a good fellow, and you should feel lucky to have him. I honestly don't see what the problem is."
Draco sighed shakily against Harry's mouth as Harry kissed him fiercely, forcing his head back against the wall with a dull thud. His hand flew up and down the blond's cock, and Draco's breath started to hitch as his hips began to buck. Harry thrust his tongue into Draco's mouth just as he felt the pulses under his hand that signaled the beginnings of orgasm.
When she left, Harry cracked the book open and peeked inside. The contents were fairly straightforward, and he began to understand just how important Mason's talk with him had been as he read through it. Malfoy certainly would have loved to put a submissive Harry into a humiliating position. He might've enjoyed it so much that he ended up hurting him.
More names were read, and with each passing couple Harry became more agitated. He was working his third nail down to a stub when he heard the names Gregory Goyle and Pansy Parkinson called out. Swiveling around in his seat, Harry grinned nastily at Malfoy, who appeared as though he'd just been struck in the face.
"Yes, it would indeed. However, one of the considerations that the Goblet of Fire uses to select potential partners is their desire to fill these roles, or none at all. You and your partner are as perfectly matched for your tastes as possible with your given choice of classmates."
He turned to Ron for support. Ron, however, was blushing furiously and avoiding his gaze. He couldn't have looked more guilty, and Harry knew at once that there had been no mistake.
"As I'm sure you're well aware," Mason went on. "Your own participation in this class will differ somewhat from the other students. I've prepared for you a small handbook with all the information you'll need to know. It is requiredreading, do you understand? I will not have you hurting one another because you're too proud to learn how to do things properly."
"Give it back, Malfoy." Harry took a threatening step forward, and drew up short when Draco pointed his wand at his chin.
Harry sighed. He couldn't be cross with Neville. His voice held nothing but genuine concern for his friend.
Harry and Draco eyed one another skeptically in the muted light of the booth. Neither boy moved, most definitely stalling despite Mason's order. Their anger from earlier seemed a distant memory, having been replaced by a dizzying anxiety.
"Today I'll be going over the first chapter in the text. I want you all to pay attention and ask questions freely. There is no need for notes, however while I speak I want you to hold hands with your partner."
Palm slickened, Draco moved his hand faster over the shaft, occasionally making sure to slip his thumb over the head. Harry panted, hips moving ever so slightly in time with Draco's pulls. Feeling the tingle begin at the base of his spine, he let go of Draco's wrist and threw both arms above his head, gripping the end of the sofa. Draco instinctively sped up, gripping just that tiny bit tighter that would send Harry over the edge.
"We're meeting in the Headmaster's office," McGonagall said in a low voice once the curtain was closed.
Harry looked away, his jaw clenching as he glared at Fawkes, sleeping peacefully on his perch. When he looked back at Dumbledore with the question that he had to ask on his tongue, his voice wavered.
Draco chuckled huskily and waved his wand vaguely in the direction of the mess. Once clean, he turned onto his side and propped his head up. Harry glanced his way and ran his eyes slowly down the other boy. Draco might not have known it, but he'd struck an alluring pose with one leg tucked up and bent at the knee, modestly covering himself but making his arse curve in a very enticing fashion...
Goyle and Parkinson chortled, issuing a smug goodnight to Malfoy before leaving the room. Lavender shouted something very rude at Malfoy before the door slammed shut again. Harry didn't move, straining his ears to hear anything more in the hushed room outside. After several seconds had passed, he expelled a relieved breath.
Draco remained quiet and under any other circumstances, Harry might have let it get by. If the two of them hadn't ingested a truth-telling potion. The stray thought that perhaps Draco wasn't saying anything because he couldn't without revealing more than he'd like squirmed into Harry's mind and wouldn't leave. "You do, don't you?"
VelvetBlood, RomanceeeeDrarry, ki_rivers, and Clizts are all the authors of this fic, and can be found on Wattpad.
Shuffling back into the entrance, Harry let the portrait fall most of the way closed and crouched behind it, listening.
That thought was enough to jolt Harry into action, and he immediately stuck his hand in the air. The woman smiled at him.
"Yeah, for Monday's lesson as well," he told him. "Why don't you ever read the syllabus Professor Mason gave you?"
"It's time, boys," Mason told them, glancing at the clock as she held back the curtain to their booth. "You don't have long, as I have an engagement this evening. In you go."
"Galleons always land Ministry side up. So when you're calling a coin toss, always choose 'Goblin'. That way, when they flip it over, it'll be Goblin side up. The pricks at the Ministry weighted down that side when they made the cast, so that if someone ever lost their coin, when they found it the first thing they'd see is the Ministry emblem. Dad told us it's supposed to inspire good faith, or something. Really, it just makes blokes like us more lucky in our bets."
After a moment Malfoy's stiff, tense shoulders relaxed against him. Harry held his breath as Malfoy settled his head into the crook of his neck and shoulder. His arms were still wrapped around the other boy, and it made him feel strange. But he refused to move them, it would be too much like giving in.
Hermione made her way up the steps to the seventh year girls room with an armload of books and a head full of troubling thoughts. Harry had been absent at dinner, along with Lavender and Parvati. Had it not been for the fact that Neville had been there, distant and closed-mouthed as he may have been, she might have thought that their Sex Magic class had run over. When the boys asked Neville how the class had went, he ignored them and drew into himself miserably.
He didn't need to be looking at Malfoy to know that a grin was spreading on his smug face, nor to feel the hand sliding slowly along his waist. Fingers dipped below his beltline and Harry gasped and closed his eyes. The bed shifted, and Harry heard the sigh of sheets as Draco moved closer. His jeans were unbuttoned and pushed down his hips along with his pants. Cool air rushed over his twitching and steadily growing length, and Harry swallowed as he waited for Draco's next move.
Tucking it discreetly into his bag, Harry turned to Ron and Hermione and joined in the discussion about NEWT exams.
Closing the book, Harry picked up his things and made his way down to dinner with a new perspective on things.
"You're sure?" Ron asked quietly, crinkling the remaining parchments in his hands worriedly. Something which Hermione would later yell at him for.
After several more minutes of shouted curses and inventive, painful ways of attempting to force the gargoyle aside, Harry slid, sweaty and exhausted, into a slouch at its feet. Taking off his glasses to wipe at the sweat stinging his eyes, he stared blurrily at the semicircular trail of dust and broken cobwebs before him. He knew that someone had been inside the Headmaster's office. Heknew it!
"Mr. Potter? Mr. Malfoy? Could you come to the front, please?" she asked, and smiled at their identical scowls as they made their way to stand before her. "There's no need for those frowns quite yet, boys. I knew you'd refuse to take part in today's lesson, and I've arranged something special for you. Follow me."
"You cannot let that happen," Mason said seriously. "From what I've been told, he has never had any reason to practice any form of restraint in his entire life. He does not have the self-control necessary to be gentle or considerate with a lover. If you let him, he will walk all over you and end up seriously injuring you in the process.
Draco brought Harry’s fingers to his mouth, pressing kisses to his knuckles, his fingertips, his palm. Harry let him, fascinated. “Monday morning I start by having breakfast with my mum, showering, then writing. She usually cooks lunch and we eat together. Then we go for a walk and I go to my workshop.” He went through the entire week. Therapy on Tuesday mornings, which was why Harry never saw him on Tuesdays: it was so exhausting he couldn’t handle any socialising afterwards. Workshop on Wednesday mornings, set days and times for lunch with his mother, with Harry, supper, reading, and so on. “I’ve gotten better at deviating from my routine and being more spontaneous.”
The course as a whole had lost a lot of its shine. Using the new knowledge at the Archive was fun, but it was more fun being around people. People other than his colleagues, nice as they were.
“Do you mean…what do you mean? Like a date?” Malfoy was definitely flustered, cheeks pink and eyes wild.
George came over, having loitered nearby waiting on Lee. “Did I hear the word ‘babysit’?” He grinned at both of them. “Are you going to be our
The game seemed to happen in a haze—Lee was commentating, but Harry didn’t register a single word he said. He rotated his players out (Love was very happy to be let back onto a broom) and gave them praise and watched Emma do a perfect Finbourgh Flick, and then Anthony performed a Wronski Feint (and nearly gave Harry a heart attack; that was one of the more dangerous moves—even if only from a height of seven feet—that he and Ginny had decided
Their friends could make whatever assumptions about his and Ginny’s conspicuous absence that they wanted.
“Of course.” She glanced between them, but did as Harry asked and punched in everything on the machine.
ago and since then…I don’t know, more and more people I know did and then I realised…” he shrugged. “It was like…this feeling of peace? Of belonging?”
Harry should’ve gone back to the front desk, but he’d wanted to steal a look at the books Malfoy had brought so he skipped into the break room. He’d put them there, out of harm’s way, and had just opened the science fiction novel again to look at the bookplate Malfoy had made, when Mildred came back.
-lanyard, even though the colours didn’t match his outfit, but he was also wearing a badge that said
She put down her glass. “I don’t know,” she said, frowning. “He’s been elusive of late. Impossible to get hold of. For all I know he’s finally effed off to the Continent.” She shrugged, but it didn’t look half as casual as she probably meant for it to be. “Why?”
Harry nodded, wanting so badly to agree, for it to be just that simple. Then her words caught up with him. “How’d you know it’s Malfoy? I didn’t tell anyone that.”
Draco nodded, but he didn’t release the cup and his shoulders remained stiff. On the one hand Harry wanted to give Draco the opportunity to leave, but on the other the evening had barely started, and he’d taken Draco here for a reason.
Not that Harry was lying in wait for Malfoy (he wasn’t), but he’d got started on that wizarding classic Malfoy had lent him, and now had a burning need to talk about it.
Harry let out a puff of nervous breath. He watched Malfoy until he vanished from sight, then set off in the other direction. All kinds of weird emotions were flooding his system—Malfoy had bought him a book!
“Thank you,” Blaise said, slamming his hand on the table. “I would prefer not to relive that terrible, awkward, horrible time. Let’s focus on how much more suave and handsome I have become since.” He flashed Gilliam a smile.
Draco appeared in the doorway to the kitchen with floury hands. “Hi,” he said, unsure. “I, ah, took the liberty to make scones. Raspberry and white chocolate,” he added.
How had that possibly changed him? Was it all that time to just…think? His prison time had been bookended by his community service; he’d been assisting in the Janus Thickey ward for about six months before he went to prison, and he came right back to it afterwards.
He split the kids into teams according to the roster, so on the first team he had: Charlie (Keeper), Alice (Seeker), Joseph (Beater), Love (Beater), Denise (Chaser) and Dorcas (Chaser). On the other team he had: Rachel (Keeper), Anthony (Beater), Jamie (Seeker), Nathan (Beater), Emma (Chaser) and Avery (Chaser). Splitting Charlie and Avery seemed like a clever move, since they already knew each other, and Harry didn’t want all three of his daycare kids on the same team to start with, as they might work a little too well together and cause confidence crises with the others. He also knew that Emma and Love were best friends as they’d come to the try-outs together, their mothers Quidditch players in their own right, so they, too, had been split up.
“Looks like your Keeper did an excellent job,” Harry said to Charlie on his way out, gently bumping their fists together.
“Oh,” said Malfoy, following him into the study. It was relatively small, but there was a desk, a chair, and several empty shelves. There were two windows, facing north and east respectively, and a small painting of a cherry tree. “It’s suitable.”
They hadn’t bought any new things together for this flat, not really. Harry had bought the bookcase all on his own, had seen it in the window of a Muggle shop near the Quidditch Daycare.
Harry’s pockets weren’t as well-charmed, or as roomy, but he had space in his book bag for the third bag. “Okay, uhm. This way.”
“No, no, I just…” Draco gazed into his mint peas, frowning. “I just didn’t believe it. You have this group of teenagers fight this war, and they win, but before they win two of them are dead, two have become injured to such a degree they’ll be permanently disabled, all of them are carrying a lot of trauma—physical injuries aside, they’re essentially child soldiers in a war they never asked for, they have PTSD, they have survivor’s guilt, they have—a lot of issues. And I’m supposed to believe they just got married and had kids and everything was happily ever after? Just like
“I want you to consider that repeatedly having sex when you didn’t want to was a traumatic experience, and you have been re-traumatising yourself every time you engaged in that kind of activity,” she said. “You’re conflating sex with a task to overcome instead of a bonding experience—you talk about it in the same terms you’ve used to talk about your childhood trauma and war experiences.”
Oliver released the balls, waited a split second, and then threw up the Quaffle and blew his whistle.
While dabbing the salve onto Hugh’s face—a magic salve, with quick healing properties—he started talking, keeping half an eye on the trio that was outside. “What happened here, kiddos? Why were you fighting?”
Harry looked at the roster he’d copied out and fished a pencil out of his pocket. It was a messy list, copied out in the order he’d selected the kids instead of alphabetised. He’d have to fix that later. “Let’s get right to it, then. Denise Norbury?”
Harry made sure everyone had control of their brooms, gave the Beaters their bats, and then released a set of training balls, also sponsored by Nimbus. These balls weren’t easier to catch or beat or pass than regular Quidditch balls, but they were charmed to stay within the same low physical range as the brooms themselves, so nobody would be soaring into the sky after a Golden Snitch—it could only go as high as seven feet. In addition to this precaution, Bludgers were charmed to avoid hitting heads in order to prevent severe head injuries.
“Yasmin is also single,” Padma added. “Do you know Zoë? I think she’s also single, though we used to date.”
Harry thought for a long time, long enough that Draco seemed to have decided he wasn’t going to get an answer. “Partially,” Harry said eventually. “I mean, it wasn’t always like this, it’s not always been uncomfortable or, or, felt like some kind of…obstacle, and it didn’t always feel so monumentally shitty afterwards—I mean, it didn’t feel
apologising for?” Harry was uncertain of everything, but also oddly exhilarated because Draco was here and he’d brought
Avery and Hugh both looked down. Charlie and Alice weren’t saying anything either, though Alice was glaring at Avery, and Betty looked like she was gearing up for a spectacular round of shouting.
“Good news!” Angelina said, taking a seat and pulling George down with her. “I am no longer breastfeeding! This means wine for me.
“No.” Draco exhaled. “I’m not ready for that. I was just…I don’t know what I was thinking, really. Just wondering.”
It was pouring down and freezing cold. Harry’d put his best weather protection charms on the kids and himself, but the rain won out. Halfway through the game, everyone had been miserable, Harry most of all. The Snitch got lost in the weather, the Seekers on both teams unable to locate it, or concentrate through the bone-chilling rain to focus enough to try, so the game was called after two hours.
“One’d think that with how much Quidditch you do in your daily life you wouldn’t need these,” Malfoy said with a smile. He still did a sniff test and studied the label. “Oakmoss and rosewood. Mmh. I’ll try one of these.”
Gladys, seemingly aware that Harry had reached the end of his tether where therapy was concerned, rounded off. She gave him a brief rundown of what kind of phrases for good communication he could use that Harry nodded through, and a pamphlet about healthy communication habits that Harry pocketed without so much as looking at it.
Suddenly, Harry was on the verge of tears. “I don’t want to talk about it,” he said, thickly. “Can I call in sick for the rest of the day?”
It was the right thing to do, wasn’t it? He didn’t have to accept her apologies, but he could acknowledge that she’d made them, that she was trying. Even if what he wanted most was to make petty, cruel remarks—
“It’s beautiful,” Ginny agreed, vibrating with glee. For a moment Harry forgot they were broken up and that they’d been awful together—they’d always been great like this, when it was about anything else but their relationship.
Percy had lost his voice entirely, alternating between cheering on his sister’s team and his boyfriend’s team, but that didn’t stop him from yelling—soundlessly—when the game ended, and the Holyhead Harpies won. Harry grinned, thumping him on the back, and hollered at Ginny as she flew past on a celebratory loop, hair wild and cheeks flushed from exertion.
“Yeah,” Harry said, automatically. He didn’t feel like a good captain. He just felt like a confused person.
Harry drew his wand over the ledger and compiled a request form: coroner reports, all-inclusive, the British Isles, 19th century. The form filled itself out and Harry went over it to check that the parameters he’d set were right. “Uh, Malfoy, that’s over three thousand documents…are you sure you don’t want to narrow it down further?”
The table was still covered in the papers Gladys had sent Harry, and the letter from Peony was there too, forgotten. Harry brushed them aside and sat while Draco opened the containers of food he’d brought and dished it out.
“All clear. Come with me.” Harry pushed himself off the door jamb he’d been leaning against and gestured for Malfoy to follow.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, woodenly, trying to organise his thoughts. “I never meant to make you feel…that way. I…” He couldn’t think, couldn’t split his attention between his brain, which was screaming about Draco, and Ginny, sitting across from him. He couldn’t—she had to leave. “I love you,” he said. “I want you to know that. I always loved you, I still love you, and I’m sorry. Can you please leave?”
There was no answer to that. Harry abruptly did not want to have this conversation. He wanted to go home. Talk to Ginny, try to convince her not to leave, that they could…work through it. They could. They had to.
She came out eventually, trunk floating after her. Harry did the decent thing and stood up to see her out.
Yeah, that much was probably true. Hadn’t Ginny said that when they’d broke up? Something about him not being what she needed. Well,
“I was actually thinking about your cooking,” Harry said, grasping for the safest straw. “And how much I’d like to do that again. I like watching you cook. And eating the results.”
He’d almost told Malfoy about this all. There was nobody he knew who was wholly in his corner, the way a parent would be, or an older sibling, or even a cousin. Malfoy arguably wasn’t in his corner at all, but he was kind of nobody, which was better than…than Ron.
“You don’t think I wanted the same thing? I wanted—something of my own, a family, to feel safe, to love—I was picturing how much fun we’d have with our kids, you know? I wanted to—” Harry was breathing hard. “I just wanted you to love me.”
“You mean legally?” Harry frowned. “They aren’t married, if that’s what you’re asking. I don’t think the law has considered triads…but it’s not…
“You want to make friends with me?” There was no stopping the smile on Harry’s face, or the delight filling every fibre of his being.
Draco sat opposite him with his own bowl of food. “The way I experienced it,” he started, picking his words carefully, “I was upset at the implication that you’d gone through with a sexual activity you didn’t want without telling me about it. And because I was upset, I was rather more…sharp-tongued than I would’ve ordinarily been. I hurt you, and you wanted to hurt me back, and that’s…where we ended up. And for that I’m sorry.”
“That’s an odd day for a date,” Malfoy commented. “It works for me. Should I bring something? Muggle cash? I don’t have any, so I’ll have to make an appointment at Gringotts first.”
“I wanted it for you,” Harry then said. He didn’t know how else to explain. “I wanted you to feel good. I liked that, it was great. I liked making you come. I liked seeing that side of you.”
Harry was thrilled, and pleased, and giddy, and could’ve stayed like this for the rest of the evening. Just watching Draco’s face, feeling his shoulders, letting his fingers drift over Draco’s arm. Half-listening to the argument Dean and Seamus were having about sheep—they appeared to be discussing breeds now.
The food arrived, and they spent the remainder of their lunch hour talking about due dates and check-ups and possible names, and eventually also the Quidditch Little League. Nobody brought Ginny up again, for which Harry was grateful.
Before Harry could answer that, Hermione came in. “I’m sorry!” she said, plopping down in her chair. “What a mess. Hello, Harry. What’s this about Malfoy?”
“Anywhere—so long as you’ll be there,” Harry said. He was still riding a wave of exhilaration, but it was starting to come down. Now all he had was nervous jitters. “I’m starving. Food?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry eventually said. He didn’t look her in the eye. “I’m just not in a good place right now.”
“He’s got an art show in Brixton,” Seamus added, proud and delighted. “It’s very good. I got an exclusive first showing, you know.”
Harry took the cue and let him be, returning to the front desk and the stack of mail. There was an odd ringing in his head, like adrenaline barrelling into old walls. Malfoy had just tried to joke with him. And Harry had tried to joke back, and Malfoy had
“Is that…a bad thing?” Harry asked, suddenly uncertain. The realisation that he’d have to be introduced to Draco’s mum eventually, as his boyfriend, was…mildly terrifying. He hadn’t seen Narcissa since the battle—not even at the trials, though he’d spotted her in passing.
“It’s a mainly Muggle craft,” Draco explained. “I picked it up when I was restoring our old properties. It’s about transforming wood—not magically, by
In the romance novels he’d read with Draco there was always a big moment after the break up, the Black Moment that Draco loved so much (well, in the novels anyway), so it stood to reason that if this was their break up scene, then Harry should do something big—only, there was no airport to chase after Draco in, and there was nowhere he could publicly declare his love for him either (and more to the point, he wasn’t sure Draco would enjoy a public spectacle). But he could get him a gift, maybe, and prepare a speech, and go knock on his door?
“Yes,” Draco agreed. “I think that’s what it comes down to, really: either you believe she was capable of killing her best friend, and thus also betrayed her country and successfully lied about both, or you believe that she couldn’t save her best friend, and that she was framed for the whole thing by her former lover and as such, is innocent.”
“I don’t have a job,” Draco said, rolling onto his back now, staring up at the ceiling. “I…well, I used to…My dad died.”
.” He exhaled. “Only my parents knew about me. And now, apparently, all of magical Britain, including my old friends.”
“Hey,” he said, sliding his arms around Draco from behind and resting his chin on his shoulder. He took the opportunity to kiss Draco’s neck. “I love you.”
Alice and the other Seeker were tailing each other and occasionally jostling—though they hadn’t done anything to merit penalties—and time was running out. The Snitch was nowhere to be seen.
Harry had been busy enough lately that he hadn’t had much time to read, and it was at least partially because he was spending a lot more time with Draco than he’d done before. Draco loved curling up with Harry on the sofa, reading a book, but Harry often had homework to do and would be reading textbooks or writing essays as Draco zipped through book after book.
“You know what,” Harry said, finishing up Hugh’s face with band aids. “I understand that the big kids are really annoying at the moment, but I think we should all be friends, right? So no more fighting about bats, or brooms, or gloves, or helmets, or anything.”
“Hey,” Harry said, suddenly fighting a lump in his throat at the sight of him. He turned to hug Hermione to buy himself a few seconds to get rid of it.
“Of course you do.” Draco rose from the table, picking up their empty plates. He bent down quickly to give Harry a kiss on the cheek. “It’s what I love about you,” he murmured, and then he was gone, already by the sink, before Harry properly processed what he’d said.
Harry sorted out the mail—there was an inquiry in there about the introduction of oranges to Britain, which Harry looked up and found to be the early 17th century, date unknown—and helped the few other patrons who came in.
“I asked first.” Malfoy’s eyes looked wild, his shoulders were stiff—the pencil had stopped, clutched in his left hand. He looked like a cornered animal.
Harry wished he could just close the door on her, but that would probably end this tentative friendship they’d cobbled together. “I know,” he said, after a pause and then decided to tell her a half-truth after all. “I just don't think talking to you, of all people, is fantastic idea. Not about this.”
And then maybe make another appointment with Gladys because even if—even if he was asexual, it didn’t seem right to be thinking like this. Maybe she could help.
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, I guess. I just…I liked that part. Where it was about sharing ideas, thoughts, memories. Mind melds.”
Not only had Harry been unable to focus in his lecture Wednesday evening, he was distracted Thursday morning at the daycare as well, and when he saw Draco at the Archive after lunch he nearly walked into the doorjamb.
Harry was brought up short. “Join me?” He’d be lying if he said it didn’t sound appealing. A hot soak with a choice bath bomb and Draco in there with him? The mere idea of it spoke to all of Harry’s senses. “Yeah, okay, if you want to.”
“What?” Harry looked up. Ginny was giving him one of those steady uncompromising looks of hers, the kind that she usually exhibited in the air, or when it came to taking the trash out. She hated taking the trash out. Harry usually did it for her.
“Then she would’ve been lying about her best friend’s death,” Harry said, after two bites of curry-soaked bread. “Which means that she killed him.”
“Is that—I’m getting conflicting information, folks,” Lee said, “did someone catch the Snitch? I’m not seeing a Snitch in play—”
“In a bit.” Draco kissed him. “I need to—” He kissed Harry again. “I want to take you home, put you in my bed, and kiss every inch of you. I want to suck you off. Will you let me?”
“Right! Yes. Well, I hired local Muggles to do renovations and repairs and the like. Carpenters, masons, thatchers, and so on. I helped where I could and learned a lot about the manual process—ask me one day what I know about woodwork—and took Muggle Studies classes at the College in the evenings, so I wouldn’t make a complete cock of myself. I did in the beginning, you know. They must’ve thought I was some kind of eccentric.”
“If you’re going to be like that I’m leaving,” Harry said, getting up. He only went to the bar, however, and ordered himself a pint of the house IPA.
Somebody had—again—left a not inconsiderable amount of documents spread across two desks, instead of returning them to either the service desk or the return trolley. Harry inspected the documents carefully and compared them with his ex libris list; none were missing. One document flagged, however, and Harry found a dark stain on the lower right corner.
“I enjoyed it.” Malfoy smiled. “We covered other things also. Like the difference between a car bomb and a bath bomb—a car bomb is a device that explodes a car, but a bath bomb does not…explode a bath.”
“What about the book?” Harry kept stroking his fingers over Draco’s skin. His shoulder had a tiny birthmark on it.
Harry did not see, but he paid for the bombs (and was nearly short on Muggle cash, which he did not tell Draco—these things were
Harry opened his eyes to look at Draco, who was looking right at him. His eyes were clear and concerned and slightly blue—the colour of his hat reflected in his irises.
“Well, yeah,” Harry said. “That’d be ideal.” Then a thought struck him. “Do you—is that why I’m asexual?”
She came out of the shower, towel-wrapped and vibrant, just after the food arrived. “Hello, handsome,” she said, and kissed his cheek. The scent of her shampoo, floral and sweet, wafted over him. “When did you get home?”
“Yes. I think I am.” Draco was looking at Harry’s mouth, his chest, his shoulders—then he looked in Harry’s eyes. “Is that okay?”
Harry packed the first aid kit up again. “That’s a plan. Now. Before we do anything else. Is there anything you two should be saying to each other?” He looked at the kids expectantly. They were good kids and usually needed only a little prompting to apologise to each other, but Harry knew that was the most difficult part of any conflict.
Harry let the kids play for half an hour, taking notes, and then stopped the game to get them doing drills. Most of them could sit on a broom and handle a second task, like a bat or a passing a Quaffle, but several were still toppling off their brooms or moving very slowly.
“Yes! They were new things when we had the course, they’re these like, telephones, that Muggles can take with them outside the house. They keep them in their pockets. They work with invisible technology waves, which…well, if it weren’t for the fact I know it isn’t magic, I’d say it’s magic. And they can use the telephones to send messages as text too, which is very cool. Anyway,” Malfoy continued, “we learned things like the difference between a butt dial and a booty call.”
holding hands? Was that something they could do? And from that moment on, everything they said or did would have…a different colour to it, a romantic intent laced through everything, and maybe Harry was going to throw up.
HELP RAISE KIDS TO SEE THE GOOD IN EACH OTHER AND THEMSELVES AND BECOME KIND PEOPLE, he wrote at the bottom of the page.
“You can have as many kisses as you fancy,” Draco said, putting a finger on Harry’s lips to stop him when he leaned in, “if you win this game.”
“That’s very generous of you, Betty,” Harry told her. He had two cards in the making, mostly for show—he had to lead by example—but didn’t know who he’d give them to. Last year he’d made one for Ginny, but this year he didn’t think she’d appreciate one. “What do you think?”
It was unfair, because Harry’s throat had tied itself into a knot, and his eyes were burning. “I know,” he said. It was unfair, because he wanted things too, and here Ginny was making it out like he was the only one who couldn’t, didn’t, wouldn’t—
Malfoy had stopped just a few steps from the store. A customer exited and brought with them the scents from inside. Harry grabbed the door before it closed, and gestured for Malfoy to go in.
Harry closed his eyes, focused his breathing, and thought about the next steps. The ex libris list. The trolley. The levitating platform that wasn’t an elevator. The hallway. The reading hall. The painting with the meadow. Malfoy sitting below the painting, waiting.
Ginny did ask how the date had gone at practice, but Harry had just shook his head. “Not now,” he’d said, and buckled down for practice: the first Little League game was rapidly approaching and the kids were so excited they were easily distracted.
Harry had the feeling that Malfoy was being shy. Under normal circumstances that would be an intriguing idea, something to be investigated and be curious about, but as it were, Harry didn’t have any space in his head for it. He just wanted to go home. “Oh,” he said.
“I didn’t mean it like that.” Draco rubbed his face. “I haven’t put you on some fucking pedestal if that’s what you think. I was just saying you and I are different people. You’re the hero in this story. I’m…a side character. A low-rank villain, one of those who disappears out of the story before it ends, and you never find out what happened to them. I’ve made my peace with it.”
There was a strange look in Malfoy’s eyes, and his face was oddly stiff. Harry abruptly realised he was trying to hold back laughter.
It was a short list, and Harry thought it looked very simple and easy. As if everything could be boiled down to six points—as if it wasn’t more complicated than that—but the part of him that was terrified down to his core proved it
“Oh,” Draco said, mesmerised. “It’s very much like bath potions? But there’s not a trace of magic in this.” He dipped his fingers into the water, swirling some of the pink with the blue. “None at all.”
wanted to kiss him. But they were standing in the middle of the sidewalk, and also Harry had to go to his Record-keeping Theory and Practice lecture, and it didn’t seem like the time or the place.
“There’s food, it’s a date,” he pointed out. “Let’s go.” He started pulling Draco towards the exit. “I’m dying to see the place. Do you have any idea how long I’ve been waiting? Six bloody weeks!”
She was at her most beautiful like this, Harry thought, watching her as she somersaulted on the broom, then zoomed towards the ground. Her teammates followed. She was at her most beautiful like this: full of life and excitement and determination.
“All right, uhm…” He turned around. The parents were sitting in the stands, chatting and watching the proceedings. He waved. “Could I have a volunteer? There are brooms in the cupboard!”
“Yes.” Malfoy was quiet for a while. “I think so. I mean, it’s definitely about dying. But maybe it’s about other things, too.”
Draco had said he was done researching, but Harry hadn’t quite believed it—or had hoped it wasn’t true, or that it wouldn’t happen so soon. The Archive had other patrons of the authorly type, and they’d been coming here for
He’d go to Flourish and Blotts tomorrow, Harry decided. He’d pick out a book all by himself and read it and keep it in the bookcase.
, but Harry didn't want to say anything out loud lest he speak it into existence. “I called in sick at work,” he tried, dancing around the truth.
Draco was staring at him openly, a peculiar look in his eyes Harry hadn’t seen before. It looked a little like desperation. “Maybe,” he said. “Yes, I mean. It’s better. Have you always been able to do wandless magic?”
No, there had been instances other than that, later. A few words at a party or other, those Pansy had put on after the trials (and after she got out of prison), the ones that started out as blind drinking and dancing to forget, that turned into drinking to talk, that turned into canapés and Muggle movies and friends. Malfoy had been there, but now Harry didn’t know if he’d spoken to him at length, if at all, or if all their interactions had been filtered through alcohol and semi-annoyed tolerance. Pansy had stopped throwing those get-togethers a long time ago.
“Yes, I was just…” He gestured at the bookcase, tamping down on the low dread in the pit of his belly. “I wanted to put something in it.”
“I thought I was doing okay. I was fixing up our properties and all that, and it was kind of a job. And I was getting my degree. I didn’t have to have a traditional job at the time, and I still don’t. Mum and I have enough capital that we can live comfortably. But I was doing all that work and I enjoyed it, and when I was working on our last property…my dad died. And everything fell apart for me then. My mental health just…” He gestured, imitating a broom falling from midair and crashing; his fist skidded along the cover. “So I was...indisposed. Couldn’t get out of bed. Dress myself, or eat, or shower. I barely felt any emotion, it was all just...grey. For months, I don’t know—I
“We broke up a couple of months ago,” Harry explained, looking after Ginny as well. “I guess she’s still getting used to me being with someone else. Let’s go.”
Harry’s chest was heaving and he knew he was on the verge of either hyperventilating or sobbing. Possibly both. He badly needed to clean up, but he’d been hoping Draco would join him in the shower after, or even the bath. He was low on bath bombs, but he had a rain one left, and one of those vanilla scented ones that Draco liked so much—but he was alone and Draco was probably in Wiltshire, which might as well have been a world away.
He suddenly realised that Ginny had cut her hair. Not drastically; it was still long, but now it followed the line of her jaw instead of extending past her shoulders. It was easier than usual. She looked good.
“Looking for you.” Harry searched Draco’s face for signs of…well, anything. But Draco just looked like himself, if a bit frowny.
Which were moist, because at some point Harry had started crying and hadn’t even noticed. Draco was saying a lot of things but none of them were registering with Harry, it was all just a mess of sounds, only it was Draco’s voice, posh vowels and all. Warm and gentle. “You said you needed space,” Harry said, and it came out hoarse and wet. “I thought—”
“So, standing invitation to join us at the pub on Friday, as usual,” Harry said, gesturing at the pub. “But I actually wanted to ask—on Sunday I have my first Little League game. Do you want to come? I’ll reserve you a seat with the team if you’d like? I mean, it’s for parents and other family members of the team, but as captain I get seats too.”
Harry was floating. Even if Malfoy hadn’t come to the pub with him, Harry felt lighter than he had in a long time and that, at least in part, was because of Malfoy.
“Not yet. Probably this weekend,” Harry said. “Maybe tonight, if I skip the pub. Or you could come with me to the pub—it’s a standing invitation.”
“Alice,” Harry said, then stopped. What on earth could he say to a frightened child who hadn’t meant to set anything on fire to begin with? “What happened?”
It was crazy how fast Harry had got used to his presence here, how fast he’d moulded his work day around Draco—if this was it, then they wouldn’t have a tea break together this afternoon at three. Or the rest of the week. Or any time after that. They’d have to establish a new kind of rhythm—
The truth was, it didn’t sound all that terrible. The kids would love the idea of a chocolate trophy, and they were enrolled in a Quidditch-themed daycare, after all. Of course everybody and their second aunt thrice removed would get wind of it faster than Harry could get a broom off the ground, but… Harry finished his pint. It could be something to look forward to. He didn’t have a lot of that in his life at the moment, or so it felt like.
“I’m starving.” Harry grinned. “Give me a moment and I’ll be right there.” He ducked into the back room before Malfoy could respond and shed his cloak (a quick spell and it was dry, if not entirely mud free) and shoved the papers into his designated hat shelf.
“This cousin,” Draco said, slowly, still looking directly into Harry’s eyes, “what did they do to you?”
Harry realised they were both still standing in the open doorway when a gust of wind nudged at the door, making it creak. “Go on, then,” he said.
Harry’s stomach dropped as an overwhelming sense of vertigo and deja-vu descended on him. “Okay,” he heard himself say, as if from a distance, and then Draco was gone.
Ginny stared at him. “You know, that may actually have been the first honest thing you've said to me in a long time,” she said. “Talk to me? I'm a big girl—whatever it is, I'm sure I can handle it.”
“So…” Harry started, when he’d finished half a mug of tea. Lacking a table, he’d set the tea pot and their lemon tarts to levitate in the air, but made sure they stayed within the confines of Malfoy’s umbrella. “About you and Muggles.”
“Yes,” Harry said. “When I was little, my hair was so messy—” Five pairs of eyes flicked to his hair. “I know, it’s still messy. But I lived with my aunt and uncle and they didn’t like that it was messy. So every day I had to comb my hair, but it never worked because my hair has a magic all of its own and it likes to be messy, you see. So one day my aunt decided to cut all my hair off because then it wouldn’t be messy anymore.”
Well. There were dust bunnies where the bed had been and a lingering smell of sex in the air, so Harry vanished the dust bunnies also and opened a window.
The teams were fairly evenly matched, but Harry noticed that his team had more players on the roster. They wouldn’t tire as easily, and everyone would get a turn—if by the time two hours had passed and the Snitch hadn’t been caught, the game would end and the team with the most points would win.
“About two or three per week,” Harry replied. “Depends. Sometimes less, sometimes more. This week none so far because I haven’t had the time.”
“Okay. Yes. When? Is it a date? Are you taking me to a Muggle store for a date?” Malfoy looked entirely too pleased about this. “Should I wear Muggle clothes?”
They went back in, Draco a little red-eyed but a whole lot calmer, and Harry managed to relax just enough to continue to enjoy the evening.
Harry dropped his face into his hands, trying to will his emotions to calm, to keep his breathing even, to not feel like he wanted to walk out the door and never come back. From the bedroom came the sounds of drawers and wardrobe doors opening and closing, clinks of bottles from the bathroom: the sounds of Ginny packing herself up and out and away from his life.
“Yes, of course.” Harry glanced at the pamphlet again, mind still reeling, but his feet started carrying him towards her. He wasn’t ready. He wasn’t ready at all.
“No, not at all, he was a model citizen and all that. I barely noticed he was there.” That wasn’t a lie, technically; Malfoy had been very quiet and made no fuss. If Harry hadn’t known he was there, he might not have noticed him at all.
All three of them said this while yelling on top of each other, so Harry needed a second to parse what was going on. “Let me see it.” He held out his palm.
Harry threw himself into work. When he wasn’t teaching five-year-olds basic flying and Quaffle handling (they were not ready for Bludgers yet), or at the Archive alternating between fetching patrons documents and cataloguing the odd little collection, he was working tirelessly on putting together a Little League team.
The pamphlet from the therapy clinic had something in it about how to help ease the person with anxiety, but the only thing Harry could remember was the bullet point about removing them from the situation that was causing them anxiety in the first place.
“I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve you,” Harry added. It was ridiculous, but it felt a lot like the heat from the curry had gone straight to his heart and now it was bursting with affection and love for Draco.
“But what if I want to? I didn’t always…dislike it. And it’s important in a relationship.” Draco’s thumb was still on Harry’s lip and he didn’t want it to go away. He didn’t want Draco to stop touching him, even as their food grew cold, and it was getting increasingly more awkward to sit-stand like this.
“Do you use this one often?” Malfoy asked, holding the bath bomb up to the light as if it would reveal its secrets to him that way.
“I want to,” Malfoy said. “I didn’t expect—but I want to. What did you have in mind, for this date?”
“This is a charity series, not the First Division,” Oliver interjected. “Our main objective is fundraising. Disqualifying teams for arbitrary reasons such as non-compliance with the standard Quidditch Regulations is in direct conflict with that goal.”
“It’s fine,” Harry said, even though that wasn’t the issue at all. He took a bite out of the scone so he wouldn’t have to talk.
“I—no—listen, they’re five years old. Let them grow up.” Harry ran a hand through his hair. “They’re just having fun.”
“That was scary,” Alice whispered, just as Harry was wiping her nose. Hugh, who was standing next to her, nodded wide-eyed. “Did I do that?”
“If you want it to be,” Harry said, tamping down on his mad, wild heart and the messy hope growing around it.
“So you’re freaking out,” Dean said. “Cheers.” He clinked his glass with Harry’s. Seamus elbowed Dean and whispered something in his ear. “So, this random Irish bloke I know wants to know who you’re dating.”
Another thing that was true was this: something had to change. He knew this, but—as Ginny had observed—he was waffling about that too.
“Thank you.” He didn’t detect any lie in her face, even if she looked more reserved as usual. “Do—” he started, but was interrupted by Emma, who was holding up her broom and uniform. “Thank you, Emma. You did a good job today. I saw you whack a Bludger all the way across the field!”
“Ron was too obviously hung up on Hermione to pay attention to me, and you seemed…Parvati couldn’t figure out if it was Cho or Cedric or both of them you were hung up on, or if you just hated the entire extravaganza to begin with,” Padma explained.
want to have sex in general, but I do kind of want it anyway, but in a detached kind of way, like, I want to make him happy, and I know it can be nice, and I want it to be nice, but when I just think about it I…
“Yes.” Malfoy looked at Harry. “And medication. It’s a combination of both. So I’m thinking I should write about living, too. The book was a therapy assignment to begin with, so…” he shrugged. “It seems fitting.”
? Harry had said yes, but he didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t want to talk about the Dursleys at all. He didn’t want to recount his meeting with Peony, or talk about his feelings, or bring up any more awful stories from his childhood. He was
“I only knew about Pansy,” Draco said, voice raw. “I thought we were the only ones in the entire world. And I thought we had to hide it.”
“You don’t look okay,” Draco said. A thin line had formed between his eyebrows. “I can wait, you know. If you don’t want to, it’s okay.”
He understood, on the logical, reasonable plan, what Draco was saying. Of course he didn’t have to. He knew that. But there was a different, illogical, reactionary part of him that didn’t understand at all, that was shooting up FAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKE signals in his brain.
“Oh.” There was an odd quality to Malfoy’s voice now, and Harry tried not to notice. “Have you…forgive me for asking, but have you read books before?”
“Come on,” Harry muttered, palms sweaty. Next to him Ginny was shouting something at Rachel, who was currently playing as a Chaser. On his other side Love was screaming and swinging her bat, spitting with frenzy.
The kids scrambled to get themselves a broom—all brand new and shiny, still in the original factory stands. Nimbus had been ready to give Harry a hundred brooms for free, if only he was willing to give them a testimony. Twelve would do it, Harry had told them.
“No,” Harry replied, truthfully. “But I have made things break and rattle and get really scary,” he said, opting to not tell them about blowing up Marge. “Big emotions are like that.”
They’d have to Apparate back to London and then probably take the tube the rest of the way, as Harry didn’t know where exactly this café was that they’d be meeting in. Not to mention, they didn’t want to accidentally drop into a crowd of Muggles…Harry would prefer to avoid getting the Ministry involved.
“Maybe?” Harry shrugged. He could do without the graphic parts of the falling in love plot as well. It was at least partially why he’d enjoyed reading about the detective and the magician; in addition to the ‘saving magic’ plot there had been a lot going on with their relationship development, but they hadn’t been shagging from chapter two.
Ten minutes before closing time, Malfoy returned the trolley, and the tendril in Harry’s belly nearly knocked the breath out of him.
He was absolutely in love. Hope grew strong and wild in and around his heart in Malfoy-shaped patterns.
If Harry had to be entirely honest with himself, the chance to spend more time outdoors was half the reason he’d formed a Little League team. Two afternoons per week outside with the kids and the enchanted balls, and soon enough they’d get games to play on the weekends, too.
The rest of the week continued in the same manner. Draco had remarked on Harry’s jittery hands and scatter-brained-ness when he’d come to pick up Harry from training, but Harry had brushed it off,
“So it was a setback?” Harry was having some difficulties comprehending what Draco was telling him; the words all made sense, but the issues he was describing—Harry just didn’t understand how or why Draco would have had problems
“That’s a lovely bookplate,” Harry said, hoping against hope that his voice didn’t sound as unsteady as he felt.
“Mmh, whatever you say,” Harry said around a mouthful of food. It tasted delicious. He tried to be mindful of all his senses, putting the weather into the pie, the comfort of Malfoy next to him, and found that…well, maybe some of it was bullshit, but there was definitely something to be said for it.
Ginny’s face crumpled. She turned away, holding herself stiffly—too stiffly, and Harry wanted nothing more than to turn seven seconds back in time and stop himself from ever saying those words.
“Are you staying until closing hours?” Harry asked, dubious. He had noticed that Malfoy never visited the café in the West wing, but he’d assumed…what? That Malfoy was a vampire?
Pansy gave Blaise a playful smack over the back of his head, which Blaise ignored. The conversation took a different turn after that, and when Neville and Hannah turned up, smoothed out completely.
Harry regarded Malfoy, and the pink spots on his cheeks, and the careful way he held himself. “I liked that too.” Neither of them had said it out loud, that the book only had queer relationships in it, people who loved the uncommon and rare, aliens who loved in foreign ways, strange and wholesome and real. “Do you…have more books like that?”
And then, before Harry could react—he was certain Malfoy had never said as many words to him before as just now—Malfoy’s face drew together into a more blank mask, and he fidgeted with his notebook instead of looking at Harry.
“That’s not what I mean. Look, this wasn’t a clean break.” She gestured between them. “Not for me. I’ll meet him later, okay?”
Well, neither had he and Draco, Harry mused. And since Draco hadn’t brought up sex again, Harry hadn’t either, and it seemed…okay. As if the inevitability had gone out of it somewhat. Harry had noticed Draco looking at him, and he’d joined him in the bath once more since the weekend, but he hadn’t suggested anything, and Harry had been very careful not to bring up the topic either.
Malfoy stared at him. There was something panicky in his eyes. “What if my mind isn’t that organised?”
“I know. I think my grandmother captured him? I’m not sure. There are still elves in the manor, but Dobby was the only captured one.” Malfoy finally plucked his plate out of the air and started in on his lemon tart. “I know you don’t think well of my family, and I can’t blame you. Captured elves aren’t supposed to be treated like…like that.”
Draco’s cheeks were colouring rapidly, following this passionate explanation. Harry turned the book over, considering it. He’d have preferred if the couple in the book had just continued onwards and onwards with their relationship without this ‘Black Moment’, that they had just been happy without all that trouble. That wasn’t wrong, was it? “Couldn’t they have been happy anyway?” he asked.
“Maybe you don’t mind, but you’re bored dumb.” Ron kicked his chair again. “So let me try again. Congrats on the victory yesterday, well done, hilarious catch, your team is fantastic.”
They finished eating with barely a minute to spare before Harry’s lunch break was over and he had to get back to work and the collection he was helping Albert with.
That last part wasn’t entirely true—Harry wouldn’t be here if hadn’t been for Ron and Hermione, and Ginny, and all his other friends, and even Dumbledore and Snape, who’d led him towards Death. And he wouldn’t be here, in this café, talking to his cousin, if not for Draco.
Absolutely nothing could go wrong, right? Harry’s tiredness had evaporated, and he was wired now, fuelled by the excitement and energy rolling off the kids.
Draco laughed. “That sounds like something my therapist might say. Actually, I think she did say it once.
“Oh, for goodness’ sake, Potter, it wasn’t a one time chance encounter in the wild, nor did I go seeking them out like hummingbirds in an aviary!” Malfoy said, all fretful. “I worked with Muggles on restoring several Malfoy properties.”
It didn’t take long to get Malfoy’s documents. They did their thing, floating out of the boxes of their own accord as Harry waited, but Harry had to pause. Take a breath. Two breaths. Three.
“What is it about?” The cover was different from the ones Harry had seen so far; no spaceships or robots or metallic lettering. This one looked a bit like a fairytale illustration—there were silhouettes of two men on the cover, but surrounding them in an elaborate pattern were several figures in the shape of plants and animals. The whole thing was made to look like it was discoloured and worn.
Well, no actual blood had been spilled, but Alice had knocked Avery off his broom and Betty had turned into a bloodthirsty pink blur on her broom, shrieking every time she got tagged, and at one point—Harry had shut that behaviour down instantly—launched herself off her broom and tackled Charlie the second he tagged her. Blur was maybe an exaggeration as these brooms were child safe and couldn’t go as fast as adult racing brooms, but it was close.
cramped, not really, the ceiling was high enough that Harry couldn’t reach it if he stood on tip-toes and tried, and he assumed the hayloft had an even higher ceiling. But it looked—it needed a massive overhaul. Proper floors, for starters, but also…
“We’ve a staff meeting on Monday before you come in and we need to rearrange some things,” she said, showing him a neatly filled out form. “Your murder boy friend sent this in last night. It’s a request for two things, a private research room and a designated research assistant, and it says here,” she indicated a rubric near the bottom, “that he wants you.”
to see good.” He collected the bowls and stacked them neatly. “I’ve thought about it a lot. All the choices I’ve made. All the choices you made. And I—I’ve come to the conclusion that I’d very likely make those same choices again.”
“You get used to it.” He led Malfoy directly to the bath bomb section, where tables and baskets were piled high with bath bombs in all kinds of shapes and colours. “These are bath bombs,” he said. “You put them in your bath and they fizz and melt, turning your bathwater into…well, what you want to turn it into. There’s different ones for different things.”
“Sorry.” Harry blinked, looking away. The back of his neck was hot with embarrassment. “Sorry. I just didn’t expect…why?”
Enclosed was a sheaf of papers that all looked like Muggle photocopies and print-outs which, upon closer inspection, turned out to be articles. They were all about sex in some way or other, ranging from trauma and dysfunction to sexuality and different types of verbal communication and body language.
“Precisely. Of course, he was a caricature, and the people this satire was aimed at failed to realise it at the time because he was so out there. But the essence of it was, I think, that if you share what you have you will gain in the end, and if you treat others badly, you will lose.” Malfoy smiled wryly. “At the time, the concept of
“The slave part is correct, to a degree,” Malfoy said. “House-elves belong to the house, not to the family, though that got skewed over time as families became synonymous with the house, as in the physical location of their home, and became Houses, capital H,” he explained. “Like the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. When a house—as in the physical place—loses its house-elves, the house is considered dead. Magic folks can still live there, of course, and many live in homes that don’t have house-elves, never had house-elves to begin with, and aren’t any the worse off for it. But a house that once was inhabited by elves, and no longer is? That’s bad luck. Those houses are ‘dead’, so to speak.”
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged. He repeated the performance with the tray, setting it to levitate beside the tub. He poured the tea. “I left my wand in my cloak, by the door. So this was easier.”
That was an interesting development. It was also the first sign of blatant emotion Harry could remember seeing on Malfoy’s face since…well, since he’d first stepped into the archive.
Malfoy didn’t say anything, only glanced to the side. He was doing something odd with his lips that Harry had never seen him do before—belatedly he realised that Malfoy was chewing on his bottom lip. It was a strange look on him.
An hour passed in this way, and then a half hour discussing what their team name should be, and then Harry let them play with the brooms as he went over uniform specs with the parents.
“No, thank you.” Malfoy had out a single black notebook and a pencil on the desk—no ink, which was also not allowed in the reading hall.
When the reports had all slotted themselves into the trolley’s shelves (now slightly bulging), a fresh ex libris list popped out of the trolley and into Harry’s waiting hand.
Harry didn’t go to the pub, though he did chat with Ron and Percy briefly after the game. Percy was impressed by Harry’s decision to go back to school and Ron thought it was brilliant. Once homework was over with, Harry spent the rest of the weekend reading about robots, only surfacing for food and a peek at the Little League reportage, which Ginny brought with her when she came to pick up her things.
Malfoy froze, two short paces from the service desk. Then he seemed to realise what Harry was talking about, because his shoulders loosened and he offered Harry a smile. “I imagine that was a deliberate choice on the author’s part,” he said. “Are you not enjoying the book, then?”
“It’s not the same thing, I agree,” Peony eventually said. “But my parents were emotionally negligent towards me. It was just in a different way. They’d throw money and stuff at me to keep me happy—quiet, essentially. So long as I was quiet, they could pretend everything was normal. So long as I remained their perfect little son, everything was fine. I learned pretty early on that I could never rely on them to…
An hour and a half into the game and several rotations later—Alice and Rachel had rotated back in—the Butterfly Bumpkins were in the lead with a hundred points to sixty, and Harry’s entire being was on fire with adrenaline, almost as if he were in the air himself. Anthony had chased the Snitch once, but lost it, and when the other Seeker had gone after it he’d distracted her by zipping in front of her and doing a barrel roll. A freaking
want to be when you were five?” Harry cut him off. “A pain in the arse? You’re doing a good job of it. Leave the kids alone. They signed up to have fun and because they like chocolate. Let them have it.”
“That’s not the only reason why I didn’t like the ending,” Draco continued, after a pause. “Even if—even if their trauma had been addressed and dealt with, that epilogue was still an epilogue that had no place for me, or people like me.”
Malfoy’s mouth turned the wry smile into a bitter one. “Well, exactly. Charitable giving was and is still a thing, but…when the charitable giving has a hidden agenda—
She kissed him back. “Thank you, handsome.” Some of Ginny’s teammates walked out behind her, and she took a moment to engage in some mutual positive reinforcement, which included a chorused yell of the team motto and complicated high-fives. Ginny’s captain paused for long enough to give Ginny a hug and a whispered something or other which had Ginny’s cheeks flushed with pride.
It’d been a while since he’d seen her without Ron, Harry realised. That was a sobering thought. It wasn’t that he didn’t like his friends, but since they’d decided to let nature run its course on the matter of children, there was no end to how affectionate they were with each other, and Harry found he had difficulties sitting through it. He and Ginny weren’t like that. He and Ginny weren’t like anybody, actually, not like Padma and Pansy, who weren’t shy about their love, or George, Lee and Angelina, who didn’t care that the rest of the world knew how much they all three loved one another, or Percy and Oliver—there was a couple Harry hadn’t seen coming—or Dean and Seamus, or Neville and Hannah…the only people Harry knew who weren’t all up in their partner’s space were Parvati (single), Blaise (single), and himself and Ginny.
“Yeah thanks,” Harry snapped, furious now, and using that fury to suppress the tears. “I fucking loved you, but that wasn’t enough! It was like—you just wanted more and more from me, but you never fucking wanted to give me anything in return!”
“Your hands are cold,” Draco eventually managed to get out in between kisses. His cheeks were dark pink, but his eyes were sparkling and there was a pleased edge to his voice.
“Yeah,” Draco said. “I always thought—hoped—I’d have at least one. Come in, it’s structurally sound. I made sure of it.”
“I had this silly notion of turning it into a workshop-cum-family home,” Draco explained as they walked up the small trodden path towards the large barn doors, “because Mum is just up the hill in the dower house, and I wanted my children to have their grandmother nearby. Of course, that was when I thought I had to marry some pureblood girl and carry on the family line—when that was the only ending I could envision for myself.” He pushed the latch up and pulled one side of the doors open, and they walked in.
do barrel rolls. Lee and Faulkner were just as surprised as Harry, Lee faltering in his commentary and Faulkner stopping short in the air and then turning to look towards Harry, gesturing helplessly as if saying
“All right,” she said, eventually. She stood up. “I’ll…just grab some of my stuff and come back for the rest later.”
Malfoy definitely looked pained. “Merlin’s balls, Potter. I’m.” He closed his eyes, then took a few moments to take slow deep breaths. “I’m sorry,” he said, when he opened his eyes again, calmer. “Uncertainty is one of the things that gets my anxiety going. I generally prefer to be given a time, day, and location, and advance notice. I’m working on it,” he added. “Should we…reconvene later?”
,” she said, her tone so scornful that Harry nearly grounded her on the spot. “See? Mum charmed them to protect my fingers.”
“I don’t need you talk to me into it,” Harry said, deciding to just do it. Take the leap. “I’m going to do it.”
“People.” Harry summoned the hot sauce packets levitating just inside the boundaries of the umbrella, and emptied two of them onto his plate. “War. And…” Well, there was the way the robots in the book had formed relationships, that had struck a deep, raw chord with him. “I thought it was interesting that…for the robots sex wasn’t a physical act, it was about fusing minds. Like, sharing information—allowing complete and unfettered access to everything inside their heads.”
“That’s my favourite part,” Draco said, face even more drawn. “It’s what makes the ending so emotionally satisfying,” he went on. “The Black Moment in romance is the part that peels back the last remaining layers of protection from both characters, so we see them at their worst, and then—because it’s a romance and they always have a happy ending—they choose to overcome that, in the end. And it’s hard, and tough, and requires sacrifice, but they do it anyway and they become better people for it and live happily ever after.”
The scones were almost done, so while they waited, Harry prepared a pot of tea and arranged a tray with butter and jam (he had no cream), and milk and sugar for the tea. Draco watched the oven anxiously all the while, until he declared the scones ready.
On Monday, Harry went directly to the Archive from the daycare, partially because he hoped he would run into Malfoy while still off the clock, partially because he had some tax paperwork to fill out, and partially because his standing lunch arrangement with Ron and Hermione had been cancelled: they had an appointment at St Mungo’s for a scan.
The kids nodded and trotted outside quietly. Avery went for a swing seat, but Charlie and Alice took the Quaffle over to the seesaw and started throwing it to each other.
“How could I resist?” Millicent said. “I had to see Big Gay Pub Night for myself. Draco, long time no see. Hello, Potter. And you two are?”
Harry tried to protest, but Malfoy ignored it, striding to the front of the store. Harry followed him and watched helplessly as Malfoy paid for both the book and a small pile of other books that the shopkeeper materialised onto the counter.
“I don’t know what to tell you, Draco. I don’t know how to explain this all. I just know that—all of us in there, we made our
At the other table, Draco was looking at Harry over the top of the book, a concerned expression on his face. The book was upside down—the realisation that Draco was keeping tabs should’ve freaked him out, but all Harry felt was relief and a peculiar ache in his chest. He shook his head minutely, trying to convey that he was fine (he wasn’t, he so very wasn’t, but he couldn’t move, he couldn’t speak, and definitely could not handle any kind of…care, from Draco, right now) and Draco frowned, but went back to pretending to read the book.
It wasn’t raining very hard in that moment, it was more like the weather couldn’t decide between being a mist or a drizzle. Either way, it was wet, and when Harry took a breath to see what smelling the weather was all about, he picked up wet earth, damp brick, and the moist bark of the willow trees in the garden. He also picked up the scent of their food, flaky buttery pastry, slow-cooked meat and gravy and roasted vegetables. It smelled different out here than it’d done inside.
Saving the questions for later and changing the subject, Harry asked, “Do you want to come to the pub tomorrow?”
He’d taken the job at the Archive just to have something to do, and while it’d been okay and paid the bills, it was just that: okay.
It was just the two of them now, had been just the two of them for four short weeks, and all the ways in which they didn’t quite fit had become glaringly obvious. Harry had stubbornly ignored it.
Charlie bit his lip, but Harry could see the resolve in his face despite it. A moment later he nodded, and then he was sitting on the broom. Whatever had been wrong earlier seemed to have evaporated.
She flashed him a grin and went back to sit with Love’s and Denise’s mums, and Harry turned his full attention on the kids.
Winning today was the penultimate step towards the much-coveted chocolate trophy (and the announcement of how much money the Little League teams had raised for their respective charities, which, in a way, Harry was more interested in, though he also remained loyal to his kids’ chocolate-y priorities). He’d postponed both this week’s session with Gladys, so he would have the energy to coach his team at practice, and his second meeting with Peony. He’d see both of them later when he was less preoccupied with the Little League.
She went over those options as well, and it turned out that audiobooks were frequently triple the price of regular books, so also not a financially viable option for the time being. Harry made a note of it, however, for Draco’s birthday. (If Draco was still in Harry’s life by then, that was.)
Pansy and Padma had snuck off at some point, and Harry found himself entrenched in a discussion about child rearing and legal issues surrounding fatherhood when the parents aren’t married, and something about a dog, and he just had enough. He spotted an empty seat next to Dean and Seamus, who were whispering something to each other, and didn’t excuse himself before going over to sit there instead.
Harry looked up, at the plain wooden boards, grey with age, that made the ceiling above their heads. Some light filtered in between the boards, which meant there must be a window or two up there somewhere. There was a narrow rickety ladder going up through a hole in the ceiling, and Harry really wanted to climb it to see what it looked like up there.
“Go on, then,” Draco said, nodding towards the kids. Harry detected no change in his face, except for a pleased draw of his mouth. “Prove it.”
wait for an owl. Ginny had wanted him to fight for their relationship and Harry hadn’t; he hadn’t tried to talk to Ginny, he hadn’t responded to her owl, he hadn’t done
If he was quietly counting down the hours and minutes until he could take a break and talk to Malfoy about Muggle Studies and novels, then that was nobody’s business but his. Quarter past three o’clock he finished a small collection of letters and seized the opportunity; he legged it to Malfoy’s study before Mildred could give him more things to do.
“Not really.” The paper bag with the new bath bombs sat in Harry’s pocket. He could almost smell the violets if he concentrated.
Betty scraped her knee falling off her broom and Harry put his thoughts aside for a moment to convince her to let him patch her up. He kept a closer eye on the kids after that and had almost shaken his brain out of the unending cycle of despair and anger and vile feeling of injustice and jealousy by the time he met Hermione for lunch.
Relief washed over Harry and he let out a breath. “I don’t know if that’s really necessary, but…thanks.”
“You’ve made your point.” Ginny struggled for a second, then continued. “I’m sorry, too. About everything.”
It’d be a lie to say Harry had thought that far ahead, because he hadn’t. And the truth was, he was only barely making ends meet since Ginny had moved out and he’d had to handle rent and utilities by himself. His only income was from the part-time archive job as the daycare expenses were covered by the investment profits Bill had helped him with.
“Oh, trust me, I know you’re not.” Draco’s thumb moved. “But you don’t pretend to be either. Look, I didn’t mean to dredge all this stuff about the War up. I just wanted to say, I thought you’d sympathise with the protagonist and I was pleased I was right. Pretty damn smug about it, actually.”
Harry frowned. Draco didn’t say anything, just patiently waited for Harry’s thoughts to get in order. It wasn’t raining today, and the weather was almost balmy, so Draco didn’t conjure up his umbrella. He did expertly arrange their levitating plates in a semi-circle around them; today’s lunch was an array of small dishes with different types of curry, and bread to scoop them up with.
“Are you mad, Mr Harry?” Betty asked. She and Hugh were sitting side by side, not looking at each other, but also avoiding looking at Harry.
“Grisly accidents, violent murders, and questionable forensic practices,” Draco replied. “I think I have collected enough material for my book.”
“What?” Draco’s fork clattered onto the table. “Oh no, Harry, love, I was never going to break up with you—shit, shit, shit—” He scrambled out of his chair and in a flash he was in front of Harry, his hands on Harry’s face, his thumbs swiping over Harry’s cheeks.
Harry drew in a deep breath and made more toast. He’d talk to him—see if they couldn’t patch themselves up, but to do that he needed a plan. While eating, he made a list.
This was starting to get unnerving. “You know, you can come in any time. The other staff can also help you.”
“I’ll come,” Draco said, slowly. “For moral support, correct? You’re not bringing me because you harbour some secret hope that I’ll hex your cousin six ways to Sunday?”
“I—fucking hell, Draco, I needed to see you!” Harry rubbed his eyes. “I needed to apologise, and talk, and try to fix things, and—I needed to see you.”
meant different things to different people, and if Harry left it late enough he’d be too soused to get up to anything with Ginny, which saved him the embarrassment of plain turning her down. He just…wasn’t in the mood.
“Harry, you have been living with a pattern of not having your boundaries or personhood respected your entire life, starting with the abuse you endured from your relatives, and continuing in your relationship to your ex. The fact that you’re used to it doesn’t make it right, but it will make it difficult for you to recognise what a healthy relationship can look like,” Gladys explained, patient and gentle as ever. “Your partner accepting that you didn’t want to have sex and then not pursuing it further is a
Malfoy’s brow furrowed and he took several sips of his tea. He hadn’t touched his tart yet. “What do you know about house-elves?” he finally asked.
“Lovely to meet you, Harry.” She gave him a warm smile, and then went over some practicalities, which Harry barely paid attention to, something about client confidentiality and how he was here on his terms, or something like that. “What do you want to talk about?”
So did Harry’s. Non-verbal magic wasn’t uncommon for children, but it usually took on more…accidental forms. Curtains catching fire when a child was angry, for example, or a bad haircut growing out after a night of fear and wishful thinking. “Well done,” he said to Alice, and made a note to talk to her parents later.
Harry had to agree with that. “It makes sense. But if I’m opening the team up like that, couldn’t I choose to only take the less well-off kids?”
When Wednesday came around, Harry thought he had a handle on both his feelings and the Little League—they’d named the team Butterfly Bumpkins, and stuck with it even after Harry explained what bumpkin really meant, and did they mean pumpkin? but they wanted to keep the alliteration and so it was. He’d also sent in his enrolment form to the College. He wasn’t certain he’d be able to get into the course, as he’d never completed his N.E.W.T.s, but he had a year of Auror training and three years of job experience from an archive, so maybe that could count in his favour.
sorry for what I said. I don’t want to hurt you like that ever again,” he said. “Uhm, I—you asked me what my damage was. If you care to know, it’s, uh, I don’t know how to say no. I mean, I know, but I don’t
“Shit, Draco—are you crying?” Harry cupped Draco’s face instinctively, the way he did with his daycare kids, to wipe at the tears with his thumbs. He paused when he realised what he was doing. “I’m sorry—”
They were right outside the White Hart, Draco having stopped them before heading in. Harry had gone over it several times already, Draco having explained it was his anxiety talking and not any kind of dislike or fear aimed at the people—so even if Harry was getting tired of repeating himself, he did it anyway.
Harry managed to suppress the sobs in his chest for long enough to get out of bed, slowly and unsteadily as if the entire world was rocking under his feet, and went to take a shower.
“Let’s sit outside.” Malfoy grabbed his cloak. It was raining; the hummingbirds in the painting were nowhere to be seen as the rain formed a grey wall of misery around the tree. That was one thing, another thing was the actual real-life rain pouring down outside both of the windows in the study. “I conjure an excellent umbrella, Potter, no need to look so worried.”
Harry slammed the door so hard it rattled in the frame. The flat was empty, the living room was empty, the kitchen was empty, and Ginny’s note sat on the table.
“Looks like everything’s there,” Harry said when the last document squeezed itself into the trolley and the ex libris list had gone all black.
“It’s fine,” Harry said. “I go like this all the time.” His own cloak was a different cut from Malfoy’s, a more practical design and made from a sturdy fabric able to withstand a lot of weather. And also, black. “No one is going to look at us oddly.”
The reporter, unperturbed, continued: “Your team registration papers list Miss Weasley as assistant coach, yet we have confirmation that she hasn’t attended a single Butterfly Bumpkins practice so far. Will she be joining you eventually, or will your team go to their first game without an assistant coach?”
“How’re you feeling?” Harry asked him, afterwards. Draco’s face was buried in Harry’s side, perilously close to his armpit. “What are you doing down there?”
Draco had slept over after Big Gay Pub Night and was lying face down on Harry’s side of the bed, a cloud of blond hair covering most of his face—Harry briefly wondered if he was actually able to breathe, smushed into the pillow like that. It’d been late when they’d left the pub; Percy and Oliver had eventually shown up, and then, because Oliver had told all
And then all the words came, all the confusion and conflicted feelings: his entire history with Ginny and how it hadn’t always been bad, how he’d actually enjoyed being with her at first, how he’d wanted it, and then how he’d stopped wanting it, and how it’d become this—obstacle, and how it felt like it was an obstacle again, what Draco had said, what he’d fought with Ginny about every time, the ways he’d found to manage their relationship, how he used to just get it over with, the rotten feelings afterwards, his feelings for Draco—everything, just everything came out until Harry wasn’t sure anymore what he’d said or not said.
Malfoy regarded him cautiously. “I’ve been dead for two hundred years. I’m trying to solve my own murder, so that I may finally pass to the other side.” He paused. “Pass into the light? That sounds better, doesn’t it.”
to look things up. Draco had only been coming here for a little over two months. Somehow, Harry had believed that this comfortable rhythm he had established with Draco would continue forever.
Frustration roiled in Harry’s chest. He’d said no! Plenty of times! And then they’d fought about it! “I did,” he snapped. “Or do you not remember all those fucking fights?”
—though the term is modern—was about throwing money at problems until they went away, throwing money at the poor until they went away, or throwing money at people in order to
“Oh,” said Harry. And then his brain caught up with him. “Oh.” Something bubbled in his gut—nerves, probably, but also something far more excited and happy. Draco had said
“Close enough. We’ve set a moving date—two weeks from now, so we’ve moved the schedule up a little.” Dean grinned, then his expression softened as he glanced at Seamus. “It’ll be fantastic to get out of the city. I love it here—grew up here and all—but there’s something to be said for the lush Irish hills, you know? There’s a kind of peace and magic there you don’t find in the city.”
Once upon a time, Malfoy would have (and had) made derisive comments about his Muggle upbringing. If he’d said those words then, it’d have been with a sneer, and it’d have been a mockery—intended to be cruel.
She took the mug silently, the look on her face unreadable. Harry put milk in his and pretended not to notice the gross amount of honey that Ginny added to hers.
“I’m not saying she did, Harry. That’s for you to decide. But I think we can agree that you did not have a healthy relationship.”
, and now a lot of people are seeing me, and it’s like I’ve hit solid ground. Does that make sense?” His voice broke. “It doesn’t make sense, it’s—”
“That’s not true,” Harry said, taking a step away. He was acutely aware of how loud Ginny was, and that there were people outside and some still in the changing rooms, and this really wasn’t the place to have this fight, or any fight at all. “It’s not
so everyone could live, and part of me stayed dead—or so I thought anyway—and you know what, I don’t care if I haven’t deserved this, or if you haven’t deserved it, I want it, and I want you, and that’s just how it is. That’s how it’s going to be. Okay? I’m allowing myself to want something and to let myself have it and to fight for it. And what I want is you.”
Harry went to fetch him the documents he wanted. When he came back, Malfoy was studying the painting of the cherry tree. It was naked—like the meadow painting, it reflected the current weather and season, as did all the paintings in the archive—but there was a bird sitting on a branch. The sun hit it just so that its feathers shimmered in the light, reflecting back a multitude of colours.
Harry had thought about it. And he’d thought about it some more, and eventually he got tired of thinking about it, so by Wednesday he’d decided to
“I’m at my other job on Tuesdays,” Harry elaborated. “I’ll be in on Wednesday again, after lunch. Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons, and all day on Friday,” he added. “That’s…my schedule.”
“That wasn’t the point. Choosing a new name was…it was this whole thing with a new beginning, figuring out who I was and, like, healing myself from…everything. I couldn’t do that with a name that I knew could potentially hurt anyone, you know? So I picked a name that no relative I know of has ever had, and one that was symbolic for healing, because I wanted that to be who I was,” she explained. She sounded like she’d given this speech before. “I’ve had enough of hurting people.”
It was altogether too much. Harry got up. He left the change in a donation box near the exit and headed for the tube. If he was lucky, Draco would already be at home waiting for him. Harry wanted nothing more than to kiss him, then sit down in the kitchen to watch him cook, kiss him again, and skip class tonight. Record-keeping Theory and Practice could wait.
There was clearly—to Harry, anyway—enough of the blue paper to go around between the three of them, but having the kids figure that out for themselves and also solve the problem was usually the best way to go about it. If he went in like some kind of tyrant and either took it away or doled out a solution the kids often felt it was unfair and would be upset about it for a long time.
At this the kids gasped, some in delight at the story, others in fear of what was going to happen next in the story. Harry gave them a conspiratorial smile. “Can you guess what happened next?”
Harry tried not to feel guilty. He hadn’t seen Teddy in a long time either. In fact, he was spending a lot of time with kids that he had no relation to. “Sorry,” he said. “I’ve been…well, busy.” He grimaced.
. I don’t need to, I mean, I would like to…” he trailed off, then cleared his throat and started over: “I work with wood, but I can’t say it’s very profitable at the moment. I have plans to turn my workshop into a small business and will be starting to look for possible clients by autumn.”
bad the other night, but it was still,” Harry made a wiggly gesture with his hand, “on the verge. All that—I think that came later, after a lot of…not saying no. I don’t know. It’s very confusing. I’d like to get back to a point where it was…not necessarily something I want, but something I don’t mind, and can enjoy? If that makes sense? And I don’t know how to get there. I just think—when I think about how it was in the beginning, it was just this thing I didn’t have a lot of strong feelings about, you know? It was nice enough, fun, even. I think that’s what I want. For it to be like that again, so that I stop worrying about it.” He drew in a deep breath. “But I found out there’s a
Draco was waiting near the edge of the field, a small distance away from the kids’ waiting families, when the team returned. Harry’s heart skipped several beats when he saw him. “Ginny, can you take over for a second?”
“It doesn’t mean anything—can we drop it? I don’t want to fight,” Harry said, trying to ignore the creeping sensation of impending doom. He could do comfortable silence, not this, not the look on Draco’s face, or the questions, or his own complicated feelings.
“You already know some of my ugly parts, Malfoy. Do you really think anyone would be interested in…seeing
By a stroke of luck, providence, or a series of random and unrelated events, Harry barely saw Draco until closing. He hadn’t even had time for a break, between helping a college student with research into flying carpet trade, assisting an elderly lady signing up for the Family Tree programme, handling a surprise delivery of South English Council’s documents going back fifty years (Harry counted himself lucky it hadn’t been five hundred years, and dumped the boxes in an empty workroom for someone else to sort out), and covering the front desk when Albert had to bow out sick, Harry just hadn’t had time to sneak away for a slice of tart and a cup of tea with Malfoy.
Before the security guard could do anything, the reporter seemed to shut up of his own accord—though Harry noticed that George’s wand was aimed at the guy. George winked, and the wand vanished up his sleeve.
Harry wavered. “I don’t know. I don’t know. I just—I have this feeling, like if I don’t then everything’s going to fall apart, so—”
“I don’t expect you to accept my apology,” Peony went on when Harry didn’t respond. “And you have no obligation to. I just wanted you to know that. And that I’m sorry.”
“Oh. Thanks.” Harry pocketed his change. “It’s, for, uh, LARPing,” he added, remembering the excuse Draco had used, all those weeks ago, on their first date.
“To the bookstore?” Yes, Harry wanted to say. I want to go with you anywhere. “Why? I mean, yes, sure.”
“I’m not sure I deserve any credit for that,” Harry told him. “I didn’t really know what any of it meant. I’m not sure I do now.”
Harry blinked. What? The question was so unexpected he didn’t know how to react. “Why wouldn’t I know where I am?”
Once, he’d wanted kids of his own. He’d wanted to marry Ginny, move into a nice little family house, and have a small crop of kids. Now…he just wanted Draco back. Nothing else mattered.
“Dude, I don’t even know,” Harry said, sliding into the booth. “I feel like I’m running head first towards…dragons, probably.” He took a large sip of the ale.
It’d been a while since Ginny had gone home to the Burrow after a fight, and Harry had honestly thought…thought what? That they were past that kind of difficulties? If anything, the difficulties they’d been having had only become more pronounced now they didn’t have other people to hide behind.
A chorus of well wishes rose up, including from the surrounding tables, and Pansy and Padma shared a passionate kiss for everyone’s benefit, Pansy dipping Padma and then twirling her about. She then sat down, nonchalantly as you please, next to Draco.
Soon after that their table filled up and they commandeered a second one; Neville and Hannah turned up, as did Blaise with a date Harry didn’t recognise but whose name was Heather, Dean and Seamus came on their heels, and Theo, who rarely turned up for pub night, had come by with a date also (her name Harry didn’t catch). Janie turned up too, with her husband, and then a co-worker of Hermione’s with her husband, so it was the liveliest Friday night Harry had had in a while.
“Yes, go on, be pleased with yourself,” Harry told him, smiling back. “How is your research today? Those twelfth century coroner scrolls yield anything interesting?”
He kept talking all through dinner, only pausing occasionally to appreciate how fantastic the food was; mouth-melting and intensely flavoured and so, so good. Draco’s cheeks acquired these lovely pink spots of delight every time Harry praised his cooking, which only made him want to do it more.
go to therapy. Funny, that. Only, I go to sort out all the fucking trauma and bullshit from my life—my therapist suggested I confront you about it, which is why I called in the first damn place.”
“Same reason I still slice my bread by hand: habit.” Harry fell in step with Malfoy, peering over his shoulder to see what was on the menu today. Steak and kidney pie, it looked like. “You want to sit outside?”
“Oh, I don’t know. It varies. Pansy and Padma might come, they usually do, uhm, Ron and Hermione maybe, oh and Neville and Hannah are coming; Neville’s got a book coming out and he said he’d bring copies tomorrow—”
Harry showed up to Little League training mildly hungover and trying not to let it show. He wasn’t late (he checked), but when he arrived, it was to find twelve kids and a number of parents making snowmen on the middle of the Chudley Cannons pitch.
Whatever it was he had with Draco, Harry didn’t want it to fall apart. So he was here now, for better or for worse.
, it didn’t matter. This entire thing with Ginny had proved one thing to Harry: he couldn’t do relationships right. He couldn’t do love right. Everywhere he looked love seemed to involve a physicality that Harry couldn’t relate to and didn’t want. It was a bit like getting drunk, really, the getting drunk part was nice, but the hangover was awful. Only, Harry would rather have a nasty hangover than the inevitable downward emotional swing that always came after sex these days; an ugly mixture of rotten mood and the feeling that he couldn’t be in his own skin, sprinkled with sadness and irritability. It wasn’t worth it.
The ringing faded eventually, replaced with a small tendril of something else, whispering against his diaphragm whenever Harry thought about that smile, so small, so brief, but so infinitely significant.
The café did indeed have lemon meringue tarts. Harry got them each a slice and a pot of tea, and Malfoy conjured an invisible umbrella large enough for both of them.
! He jogged to keep up with the kids, to try to corral them into more sportsmanlike behaviour; they could cheer all they wanted, but they were going to have to be nice to the other team first and thank them for a good game.
When Harry returned home, hours later, belly full of tea and sticky buns and heart full of wonderful conversation, he was exhausted. Homework would have to wait. He ran a hot bath and dropped in the pink and purple sleep bomb. No homework, no science fiction, just this sea of calm and comfort.
“Okay. Do you want to try again?” Harry silently reset the broom as he moved it to lie on the ground between them.
is a very real thing that many who suffer from don’t know they have, or have been misdiagnosed. As it’s understudied, we don’t know what is the exact cause/s, but we do know that it’s either a physiological reaction (chemical crash following a chemical high (orgasm)) or a psychological reaction (emotional crash following an emotional high), or
Malfoy focused his gaze on Harry. He looked neither surprised nor upset, or even overwhelmed. In fact, he’d barely shown any kind of emotion on his face since Harry had first seen him that day. “I’m sure.”
“Right on. Come with me.” Harry checked that the contents of the trolley matched the ex libris list, then pushed it out of the hall. Malfoy pocketed his pencil and notebook, picked up his cloak—which he’d draped over the back of his chair—and followed Harry out.
“No, not like that.” Harry gave her a smile. “I should warn you, I think the press is on to the two of you.”
“It could be,” Harry said. “I’d like it to be. Those always have a happy ending, right? I’d like a happy ending.”
“Same as usual?” he asked, fumbling with the ex libris list. Malfoy was very close to finishing the stack, one more visit to the archive and he’d be done, Harry reckoned.
Ginny assented, and they spent the next twenty minutes showing the kids how to perform the Hawkshead Attacking Formation and explaining whose job it was to do which part as they rotated in and out. Denise, Dorcas and Avery had turned out to be a fantastic Chaser trio, rivalled only by the Denise, Dorcas, and Emma trio. Rachel was a stronger Keeper than Chaser, so she’d relieve Charlie of his Keeper position when he rotated out, and Chaser if needed, and then there were Nathan, Love, Anthony, Joseph and Jamie, who were all strong Beaters. Anthony doubled as Seeker, so Harry put him down for that for the rota, as none of the others wanted to, or were any good at it. Jamie would also double as Chaser, and Emma as Beater.
Practice went perfect, and Harry went home slightly snowy and soggy at the bottoms, but happy and excited.
“I do have a question,” Draco said. “Because I want to understand. You don’t have to answer. Your issues with sex…do they have anything to do with your being asexual?”
He wanted Ginny to love him. He wanted to…to get to love her back freely, without expectations, without constantly having to navigate around a black hole of nothing.
“Thank you,” Harry said, watching as the kids attempted to repeat the exercise after them. Lots of Quaffles were dropped, but they were doing their best.
“I don’t think…none of us came out of the War unscathed,” Ginny continued, “and I think all of us were impacted by our sentences in some way or other…maybe it was a slow change, I don’t know. But when you came back from prison, that’s when I noticed you weren’t the same person anymore.”
It was almost a relief. Harry hadn’t spoken to the press in five years. Maybe he’d eventually come round to not actively disliking it.
Yeah, Harry could attest to that. He’d liked it for the effect it had had on both him and Ginny, easing away their rough edges and feeding the senses. Harry had loved sex with Ginny then, either in the bath or after, when it wasn’t hurried or full of expectations or…any number of other things that Harry would inevitably think were wrong. He usually felt good afterwards as well…but it was just a bath bomb, a Muggle invention full of baking soda and natural oils, it was silly to think it actually
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, that’s…the glitter doesn’t rinse off very well most of the time. Maybe with magic, but I don’t want to strip all the effects of the bath bomb off, so the glitter stays.” He ran a hand through his hair. There was no glitter in it today, but it was silky soft from the cloud bomb he’d used the evening before. “Come with me to the store? I think you’ll love it.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry grumbled. “He’s done with the research. What does it matter that he knows my schedule?”
“Oh.” Harry couldn't quite figure out if the odd spinning feeling in his chest was disappointment or fear, or both. If Narcissa wasn't going to let him see Draco, then—
The happy warm feeling from dinner had subsided, though looking at Draco now, Harry thought it might come back. “I’m okay.”
Harry’s second meeting with Gladys had veered off course in a matter of minutes; Harry had gone in thinking he wanted to talk about Draco, who had indeed come pick him up when his shift ended, and had wound up talking about anger. Or lack thereof.
“I don’t do that sort of thing,” Harry said automatically. “I just fetch things and put them in order.” He eyed the form. Malfoy had requested him specifically?
“The detective is gay,” Malfoy said, his voice low and vibrating. “I was just hoping that in the sequel he and the magician…” he gestured. When he looked at the book there was a special kind of hunger in his eyes. “You know.”
“I know that’s hard to believe, but it’s the truth. Listen, I was just on my way out. Can I call you back later?”
Harry shook his head. “That was a long time coming. I’m…” He discovered that his glass was empty. When had he finished his pint? “Malfoy lent me this book, and it was amazing,” he said. “It had all these…
“Oh.” Malfoy was frowning. “I suppose I should’ve thought of that. What did you think of it, at any rate?”
“Yeah.” Harry sighed, running a hand through his damp and wild hair. “I have one month’s notice, don’t I? This is it. I’ll owl you my formal resignation later if you need it.”
Interestingly, all the research I could find on PCD, consent, performance, etc. never brought up asexuality - and in fact, rarely brought up the sexuality of the participants in the studies other than to note that they had all been heterosexual - which obviously leads me to think: what if there’s some overlap between asexual people (who might not know they’re asexual in the first place) and people with PCD or similar complex issues relating to sex? After all, it is the experience of many asexual people that there’s a pressure to engage in sexual acts, to perform, to behave a certain way.
The Butterfly Bumpkins were playing the Candy Cranes that day, but Harry could meet before or after. After was probably best.
That wouldn’t be so bad, Harry thought. He’d take a smaller rush any day if it meant he didn’t have to feel shitty afterwards.
“Mr Harry, are you going to finish your Valentines?” This was Betty. She blew on the ink in her cards to make it dry faster. “I can help you if you’d like.”
He’d wanted Peony to feel unsettled. He’d wanted to remind her that he was a wizard, a powerful person capable of…anything. He’d wanted the satisfaction of telling her straight up what kind of horrible person she had been and (maybe?) still was. He’d wanted…Harry glanced over at Draco, who’d consumed all of the cake he’d ordered and still hadn’t realised the book was upside down. He was staring so intently at it that Harry had no doubt he was straining his ears to listen.
Harry glanced back at the stands, hoping he would get a glimpse of Draco, and was surprised to see a swarm of something maroon—the brightest of the Butterfly Bumpkins team colours. Abruptly, he remembered the badge Draco had given him and tapped it with two fingers; a number of maroon butterflies erupted from it, wings dark and glittery at the edges, and fluttered upwards to join the swarm over the pitch.
“I want to say honest,” Malfoy said, after a moment’s pause and a bite of pie. “I’d like the truth. But I’ve heard the rumours, and if the rumours are half true it must’ve been…a traumatic experience, for you.”
That had Draco laughing, which Harry took as a yes and reeled him in. “Okay,” Draco said, smiling and kissing Harry back. “What’s next?”
Peony looked away. “I don’t speak to my parents anymore,” she said. “Well, Mum, sometimes. But they don’t—you know how obsessed they were with keeping everything normal? How nothing ever was allowed to deviate from—from this arbitrary and toxic standard of normal that didn’t exist anywhere except in their narrow world-view?”
something, not just lie there all paralysed and unable to deal with anything at all. If he’d been face to face with a dragon he would’ve done something, he wouldn’t be like this. But this wasn’t a dragon, this wasn’t life or death, this was a complicated tangle of emotions rattling around inside him, making it hard for him to think clearly—the only thing he could think about was how much he missed Draco, how much he needed him there, and how scared he was that he would never come back.
Malfoy was worrying at his lip, his cheeks pink. “I know it’s weird,” he said. “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t judge me.”
Harry didn’t know what to say to that. He didn’t recall his time in prison being particularly awful; the incarceration rates after the War had been so high that there wasn’t enough space in Azkaban for everyone, even with the staggered sentences, so he’d been sent to a facility in Norway. And even so, the European Delegate had banished Dementors from Azkaban. Hermione had served in Azkaban and had said of her time there that it’d been a bit cold, but otherwise uneventful. Harry could’ve said the same thing. Prison had been mostly boring. There’d been a library there, and they’d had a few books in English, so Harry had read those, and…that was it. Two months of boredom in a Norwegian prison.
“Thank you, Pansy,” Harry said. “I’d think the public had got enough of my dumb mug at Ginny’s games. Excellent photos, every time.”
“No hexing,” Harry confirmed. “You don’t have to, like, talk, or anything. You don’t even have to sit with us if you don’t want to, I just—I’d really appreciate it if you were nearby.”
Harry thought Malfoy had maybe got a new haircut. It looked slightly different from before. It made his face look softer. Or maybe it was just the light. Or the fact Malfoy was looking at Harry like he wanted to say a lot of things but didn’t know which thing to say. “Did you want to research some murders or something?” Harry eventually said. “Didn’t you just get started on the 18th century Ireland collection last week?”
“Probably,” Harry said, dropping himself into the other chair, and grabbing the other take-out container. “Where’s Hermione?”
It wasn’t like the first time either, when Harry had broken up with Ginny during the War to protect her. It’d been temporary—they loved each other, they were going to see each other again, when the War was over, when everything was over. They were going to be together again.
The broom raised itself up until it met Charlie’s hand. His fingers closed around the shaft automatically.
The knot in Harry’s chest tightened and then dissolved into pure, hot hatred. He hated this conversation, he hated the War, he hated the Dursleys, he hated every single facet of his life that had brought him here, to this garden, to this very moment, and made him have this conversation. But most of all he hated all the damage the fucking War had wrought on not just him, but on the country, and on everyone around him.
But it was hypocritical, Harry thought, to hold himself in better regard. He’d gotten a combined prison and community service sentence too. He’d used Unforgivables. He’d caused injury and death to a lot of innocent bystanders when he’d broken into Gringotts with Ron and Hermione, and he had to live with that knowledge for the rest of his life. Hell, he’d probably broken more laws than Malfoy had, but Harry had gotten two months in prison, and Malfoy had gotten a year.
“I haven’t had the chance to read them yet,” Harry said. “I just started the robots one. I was going to read it tonight.”
“Fine! Fine! You can have sheep and a furnace and whatever, but don’t come complaining to me when the shed turns out too small for all your hundred and fifty-seven art projects and you can’t find your oil paints under ninety pounds of unspun wool.”
Harry was quiet, staring at Ginny and her unyielding gaze. She was right. And unlike him, she usually didn’t have any scruples about letting the truth out.
Harry pulled a pair of pyjama bottoms and a t-shirt out of the wardrobe, realised he’d also vanished his sheets, duvet and pillows, so dug in again for a blanket. He’d sleep on the sofa tonight.
Ginny was still flushed when she came out, and Harry greeted her with a deep kiss. “You were amazing,” he said.
Harry shared a look with Draco, who just looked completely bewildered. “Why is this an issue?” Draco whispered. “Does Gilliam not—oh, he didn’t go to Hogwarts, did he?”
They found the café easily enough in the end. There weren’t a lot of people inside, and Harry couldn’t see if his cousin was there—there was nothing to do but just go in and find out.
“I don’t—” Draco shook his head. “I’ll never be done with that. That’s not a process that ever really ends...I just happened to run out of properties to give away.”
don’t, Harry’s brain helpfully reminded him. You’re the one having a minor meltdown in a bath & body shop over possibly having sex with Draco.
Butterfly Bumpkins were playing Dragonriders, which was—if Harry recalled correctly—the team captained by a cookbook author. Her profession was clearly not a mark against the team’s skills, who were all excellent fliers and players for their age, but to Harry’s delighted surprise his own team was
Something weird was happening in Harry’s stomach, and it wasn’t just because the food in front of him smelled and looked delicious. The last thing he’d expected was an apology from Draco. “I don’t understand.”
Draco was giving Harry this intense look, like he was trying to reach inside—briefly Harry wondered if he knew Legilimency, but then dropped the idea. “You have a game tomorrow.”
The painting of the meadow showed a sun low in the sky and a bunny peeking out of the grass. A tree in the distance swayed gently in the wind.
“No.” Harry gestured for him to go ahead, then followed with the trolley. He tapped the door, marking the room as returned so that the cleaning staff would know to come by. “It’s all sorted.”
“Oh yeah, I guess.” Harry shrugged. “It’s not that I don’t like it there, but what’s the point when I could be doing all this instead? Old documents aren’t that interesting. But kids are—kids are
“I don’t know,” Harry managed to tell him. “I don’t know where to start or what to do or what I like.”
“Ew, that’s just gross.” Harry shuddered. “He wasn’t capable of love, or remorse, or anything that could’ve redeemed him. His story could never have been a romance.”
Harry lowered his fork. He hadn’t been serious; the words had just slipped out—but Draco’s matter of fact tone reminded him of the last time they’d talked about deserving things. “You’re not a side character, you know,” he said. “What you said the other day. You’re not a side character.”
“It’s just a therapy assignment. My therapist is pretty happy with my progress, so I don’t have to—it was just an excuse to go out, you know. A reason to go out, more like. Because my PTSD—we aren’t actually sure how the PTSD, anxiety, and depression mesh, if they’re three different things or if it’s all of it PTSD,  but one of the big things is that I get these intrusive thoughts, that affect, well, everything, and…I end up withdrawing from everything. Social isolation, it’s called. And I went to the Archive as a part of the treatment, to…try to get over that? The assignment was to go somewhere I’ve never been to socialise with someone I don’t know.”
“I’m not making fun of you.” Harry wanted to touch him, but Malfoy was all closed off. “What was the other answer going to be? The sane-sounding one?”
. The only thing in it that he could claim for himself was the bookcase. It held more books now than it’d done when he first put it together; the books he currently had on loan from Draco, but also the few books he’d purchased for himself or that Draco had given him.
Everyone groaned, except for Gilliam, who hadn’t gone to Hogwarts and thus was looking very confused.
“Certificates? Er, those are kind of personal. They’re not on public file,” Harry said. He wished he could say yes, if only to keep Draco at the Archive for longer. He’d got used to seeing him practically every day, and if he didn’t need the Archive’s resources anymore, then…Harry felt like he’d slip away.
The customer, who Harry now realised was Draco Malfoy, said: “I’m interested in coroner reports or death certificates or other documents that would describe an individual’s cause of death. Do you keep that sort of thing here?”
It wasn’t until Harry materialised just inside the front door and saw Ginny’s shoes that he remembered that he’d promised to make dinner. “Ginny?”
The rest of the week passed by in a flurry and a blur. Between parents and registration forms and team uniforms and Ginny and temperamental brooms and Malfoy wanting ever more macabre documents to read, Harry was all but breathless.
Was it too much? Not enough? Harry frowned, Hilde hooted, and before he lost his nerve he folded it up and tied it to her leg. “Make sure he gets it,” he told her. “It’s okay if there’s no reply, don’t hassle him for one. Just make sure he reads this one, okay?”
Harry was almost too wired to be in his skin by the time he made it to the pub. He was early, too, unable to sit still—he’d tried to finish reading the young adult dystopian book Malfoy had lent him, but had been unable to focus. The only people already at the pub were Dean and Seamus. Harry fetched himself a pint of pale ale from the bar first, then wound his way over to the table.
“Yes, it’s not that strange. Lots of people go to therapy.” Her tone was defensive, and Harry had to fight the urge not to laugh.
Come Friday morning, Harry was waiting for Malfoy to turn up. He’d been late the previous week, so Harry didn’t expect him early, but Malfoy was there within a minute of Harry turning the key in the front door to unlock it.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make things awkward. I just.” Harry tried for a nonchalant shrug and absolutely, completely, utterly failed at passing it off. His left shoulder probably looked like it’d had a sudden spasm. “You don’t have to say yes.”
There was a kind of urgency behind Draco’s every move that Harry hadn’t expected—or, well, he sort of had, but he was surprised anyway. Their clothes were off and folded neatly (another of Draco’s neuroses) in no time, and then it was like Draco was trying to drown himself and come up for air at the same time.
“Oh.” Harry looked at Malfoy, really looked at him, and tried to compare what he was seeing with what Malfoy had looked like when he’d first come into the Archive almost five weeks ago. He didn’t look chronically underslept anymore, or like breathing was a chore, or vaguely ill. He looked like what a normal person was supposed to look like.
He still didn’t know where Draco lived, which was…odd. He knew he didn’t live in the Manor, which had been closed up for years.
“Comforting, Harry.” Ron stabbed a dumpling with a chopstick and popped it into his mouth. “So, tell me about Malfoy.”
Greetings and introductions went around the table. “You remember Draco?” Harry asked. “Draco, this is Angelina, Lee and George, we were on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Well, not Lee, but close enough.”
“Whenever? First person to get there snags tables and I guess by eight or nine most people will have shown up that are going to show up…”
That last question elicited a few giggles as the kids ascertained that they definitely still had their heads. Nobody seemed to have hurt themselves, but Harry would check them again later and let their parents know when they came to pick them up—he’d learned the hard way that sometimes kids weren’t aware of their own injuries and wouldn’t be for hours. Slowly, the crying ceased, and everyone’s faces got cleaned up.
About him, probably, and Ginny, and the League, and how well their kids were doing. He could feel their eyes on him as a prickling at the back of his neck, as he narrowly avoided being hit by a stray Bludger.
Coffee, he determined, after a quick sniff test. Never mind that that beverage and other liquids weren’t allowed in the reading hall; people would find ways to sneak them in past the magical barriers anyway.
Harry turned the book over in his hands. The same spaceship was on the cover again, but the background and colour scheme were different. The blurb on the back promised plot this time, something about a mystery and an accident, and a cover-up. “Yeah, okay.” Draco hadn’t mentioned the book, but that didn’t mean he didn’t know about it, or didn’t have it pre-ordered at Flourish and Blotts. Harry decided to risk it. “I’ll take it.”
“I don’t know.” Gladys had said he had to communicate, so that meant he had to talk. But talking—telling Draco the truth—didn’t seem like it’d do any good. “I don’t know, Draco. It was fine. I guess. I didn’t hate it. It was nice.”
—who all relied on him to be some kind of adult and lead them on the path to chocolate-y victory…Harry felt out of his depth. He could deal with five kids, he was used to that, but
as if Draco hadn’t even realised how contradictory his own words were. “Listen Draco, if you think you’re anywhere close to being the same as fucking
“Yes, come,” Harry agreed. He hadn’t spoken to Oliver in a while. He seemed to be doing well on the not drowning himself in the shower after a lost game front, if the display on the lawn was anything to go by, but Harry wanted to talk to him about the Little League.
“It’s a Quidditch-themed daycare,” Harry said. “Anyway, I brought you back your books.” He put the small stack of books on Malfoy’s desk. “I skipped the poetry collection.”
Afterwards, the kids and their parents were quick to pack up and go, nobody wanting to linger. Harry gave Draco his spare key and told him meet him at the flat, and then went to join the other captain in talking to reporters. By the time that all was over with and Harry had taken all the equipment back to the Chudley Cannons’ home stadium (he’d let Ginny leave early, on account that she’d handled the gear last time) and had made it home, he was in a terrible mood. The kind of mood that wasn’t grumpy or angry so much as tired and depressed and disappointed and upset all at once.
What did Harry want? They’d been here, what, half an hour? Less? More? And Harry felt more confused and more angry and more upset about everything than he had before he’d walked in. It all felt like a mistake—like he could’ve gone through life never speaking to his cousin again and been perfectly fine.
Draco snorted. “Enough of this.” He fished a handkerchief—a real, actual, handkerchief—from a pocket and dabbed at his face.
She tapped her chin with a finger. “I’ll be honest with you, sexuality, sexual health, sexual dysfunction—it isn’t my area of expertise. I’d like to do some research and then pick up this thread later. Will it be all right if I owl you some reading material before we meet again?”
“Why would you think I don’t mean it?” Harry pulled at Draco’s legs, making him yelp as he slid closer to Harry. Draco hadn’t spilled a single drop of tea, but put the cup down anyway, and tried to right himself.
He dipped a spring roll into the peanut-soy sauce that’d come with their order. He took good care to dunk it so he could get as much peanut crunch as possible. “Malfoy came to the Archive,” he said, inspecting the spring roll. He took a bite.
“Okay. If you have questions later, I’ll be at the service desk out front. If nobody is there, you can ring the bell and either I or one of my colleagues will come.” Harry didn’t receive a reply to this—aside from a perfunctory nod—so he left Malfoy to his documents and went back to the service desk.
“That’s for me to know.” He stood up. “Let’s get back to work. I want to look at those medieval coroner rolls from Oxford you mentioned last week.”
“Trust that the other person would still like you after seeing all your ugly parts,” Malfoy agreed. “And the reverse, accepting and loving the other person even after seeing all
“You were a terrible captain at Hogwarts,” she said, but her eyes were twinkling. “But you’re not on the team this time. I hear you’re great with the kids on your little hobby team.”
“I couldn’t possibly be prouder of this team,” Harry said to Ginny as they went to meet the other captain and assistant coach. He couldn’t stop grinning. “Thank you, for helping me.”
“Ow!” Alice said, already getting to her feet by the time Harry reached her. “That hurt.” She scowled and glared at the DragonTAMERS Beaters, both of whom were looking very guilty.
“Well,” Ginny said eventually, slowly, seemingly talking around a throat issue of her own. “I won’t pretend it doesn’t hurt that you’re more broken up about this than you were when
“The sequel to that one came out just last week, so if he doesn’t have it you could get him that one?” Lisa suggested. She plucked the book out of the shelf and handed it to him. “I haven’t read it myself, but I’ve heard it’s great.”
The week had gone by in a flash. Draco had declined the invitation to come along to Little League practice, but he’d walked Harry to the Direction Alley exit where he usually Apparated from. They hadn’t made plans to see each other outside of the Archive, yet; Harry had his evenings full most days and Draco hadn’t suggested alternatives. They had been sneaking kisses during every break they took together, though, so Harry wasn’t too dejected about it.
“Too damn right,” Blaise said and offered Harry a high five. Dean made an assenting noise and Harry high-fived Blaise back.
One by one, Harry and Ginny saw the kids off with their families and collected all the equipment and confirmed with Oliver and Faulkner that everything was all right when they came by.
novel,” he whispered, as if imparting some great, wondrous secret, “about Muggles in space. It’s very exciting.”
But Harry had had some time to read this week, picking a book at random from the now permanent (and growing—Harry was convinced Draco was secretly adding to it) pile of books he had on loan from Draco. It was a romance novel, written by a witch and set in magical Britain, so not another one of those odd Muggle romances written by a non-Muggle. Draco had reread it recently, so when Harry turned the last page he was ready, watching Harry over the rim of his cup, curious and excited.
The kids looked at one another, now clearly worried that Harry was going to take it away from them altogether.
“Pass. My nose hasn’t been the same again since, I’ll have you know.” Harry cleared the bench of water with a flick of his wand and they sat, snug under Malfoy’s invisible umbrella, their food hovering just within reach.
There is no evidence that PCD is directly related to past sexual assault or trauma. PCD can occur even if the individual did not orgasm, and there is no connection between PCD and the intimacy of the sexual encounter or the relationship; individuals can suffer from PCD after sex with someone they are in a strong committed relationship with as well as after casual encounters with strangers.
It was still pouring down outside, the sky dark grey and gloomy. There was a small window in the bathroom that let all this gloom in, but now the bathroom also held the scent of fresh scones. Harry set the tray down on the small chest of drawers tucked in between the washing machine and the bathtub.
“Do I?” Harry dipped the bread into the curry, and then took a bite. Delicious. “You don’t think I’ve become cynical after everything?”
Malfoy’s cheeks were pink. “I thought you weren’t in,” he said. He wasn’t looking at Harry; he was patting down the front of his robes, as if to put them back in order, but they were pristine as far as Harry could see. Suddenly he frowned. “You have mud on your cloak.”
Ginny stared at him. “Do you mean that charity thing Oliver is putting together with Faulkner and Pomeroy?”
“I didn’t teach her to do that!” Harry despaired, having been too baffled by the display to do any captaining at all. “Merlin’s bleeding tits, what the fuck—”
It was odd, feeling hungry. He hadn’t felt hungry like this in years. Not since the Horcrux hunt, or the summers at Privet Drive…Harry’s stomach turned and gurgled, and the hunger abated bit by bit.
“Edwarde Edgcomb is a tosser,” Harry said the moment Malfoy walked in, at five to two. “Also, the distribution of Es in his name is uneven and it bothers me.”
He didn’t see Malfoy again until closing; Harry had few errands in the reading hall that day and when he did, he noted that Malfoy kept his head down and went through the reports methodically, occasionally writing something in his notebook.
His flat was within walking distance, but Harry Apparated—hoping that Draco would be there, or that maybe he'd walked and Harry would make it there first. He’d go after Draco wherever he went if he had to, but—
Harry was vaguely aware that Dean and Seamus were exchanging glances and nudging each other and also whispering something, but he didn’t care. Ginny had asked if he was gay. He’d said no.
Harry's grin spread. Neville and Lavender's booth was illuminated by a pulsating gold-tinged rose globe. He didn't know what that meant, but the sight of it warmed and soothed him, and so he could guess at the activities going on inside.
"Mr. Malfoy, I believe I told you to move," Professor Mason interrupted, glancing at Neville's empty seat next to Harry.
He paused, looking grave as he formed his next words. His eyes met Harry's and the younger man felt something inside of him recoil at the grim solemnness in the once twinkling gaze.
"I am not gay!" he shouted, drawing the attention of the entire common room. "Furthermore, I still haven't completely forgiven you and your brothers for getting me into this mess! So just shut it, will you?"
Malfoy jerked his hand out of Harry's grip. "If you mean mucking around in the dirt like a Weasley, then of course not!"
Harry came with a small moan, and felt Draco's hand slip down to the base of his cock, still pumping minutely but careful not to get anything unseemly on himself. When the last throb died away, Draco removed his hand, wiping it on Harry's pant leg to remove any traces that might've gotten on his skin.
"Of course I do," Draco told him firmly. "And I don't care that you know, either. As far as I'm concerned, you can go running to McGonagall and tattle on me if you like. I've toyed with the idea of leaving school early, anyway. In fact, why don't you go right now? If they kick me out, it'll save me from having to snog you anymore."
"I'm only following directions, Potter," Draco smirked, using Harry's own words from the hand-holding lesson.
Tuesday night found him writing an essay for Advanced Herbology on how the restorative properties of Mandrake Root and the detoxifying properties of bezoars could be combined and used as a highly effective cure for hangovers. He'd likely receive a few curt lines from Sprout about it. He and his semi-mentor didn't quite see eye to eye on the use of the plants that they both loved. She was always pursing her lips disapprovingly at his ideas for the use of powerful herbal remedies for common ailments. He could see the message scrawled in the footnotes now... "Honestly, Neville, Mandrake and bezoars? Would you waste such highly difficult to procure ingredients on the effects of stupidity and personal vice?"
When Malfoy's movements became distracting, Harry sighed and turned to one side so that he could get his arms around the other boy's torso. Malfoy startled violently as Harry pulled him around so that his back was pressed against his chest. Harry leaned down so that his mouth was right next to his ear and whispered.
A silence fell and grew between them, heavy and unsettling. Harry kicked at the carpet with the toe of his shoe, suddenly unsure of why he'd wanted to see Dumbledore so badly in the first place. A year and a half of distance, as well as the betrayal of Fifth Year lay between them, and the longer the pause stretched the greater that gulf seemed. Harry wasn't entirely sure it could be breached after all this time, but the quiet was worse, and so he would try.
Malfoy turned to give her a look of utter revulsion, but she merely leveled him with a dead stare and tapped two fingers against her arm impatiently. Grunting something rude, he angled his blond head to the side and grudgingly placed it against Harry's shoulder.
Shutting away the thought of what they were doing, Harry began to rub his thumb in small circles over the underside of Draco's wrist. He noted the barely perceptible way Malfoy's eyelids fluttered, and wrapped his fingers completely around the fragile bones he found there.
"What...?" Draco asked cautiously, craning his neck to try and catch a glimpse of what was holding Harry's interest.
He shouldn't have been surprised that he wound up at the Room of Requirement. After all, his options were limited as to where he could go. But the sight of familiar purple tented booths only seemed to fuel his anger. He paced up and down between the rows of desks, swearing under his breath and cursing meddling minds and wagging tongues. He'd just managed to work himself up into a frothing rage when a sound behind him and to his right drew his attention. Whirling around, he found himself facing-
"Shut it, Potter," Draco snapped. "This is new for me, all right? But judging from your performance last night, I'd say you were a regular pouf."
Harry gaped at the closed curtain for several moments after she had left until the pull of the Veritaserum began to take effect. Gritting his teeth he glanced up through his bangs to see Malfoy staring at him intently.
"For today and next Monday's lessons, you are free to do anything you please. You may continue on as you have been doing, try something a bit more advanced, or simply talk to one another. However, I ask that your skirts, trousers and underthings remain undisturbed. You are free to begin."
There were several amused glances exchanged between the students. Harry stubbornly tucked his hands under his thighs and absolutely refused to look at Malfoy.
"That's what Professor Mason said," Neville's voice replied. "I don't know much about how this branch of magic works, but I'd wager a guess to say that lightning requires quite a bit of... well, anyway. It seems odd, doesn't it? On the first day of class, I could've sworn that Harry was as nervous as I was. And then when he got paired with Malfoy, he nearly shot through the roof! Now they're making lightning bolts together?"
It was impossible to sleep that night, with his brain running through a list of ideas for how to bring Malfoy over to the right side that was more conductive to wanking than sleep. The next night Ron's snores and Harry's impatience reached a crescendo, and Harry, hollow-eyed and grumpy, snatched up his Invisibility Cloak with more force than was necessary and went for a walk.
Draco sniggered into his hand and in the process attracted the rather unpleasant attention of a wrathful Professor Mason.
Lavender shrugged and gave him a smug smile. "It's like having a secret identity. I like being mysterious."
Malfoy's eyes were squeezed tightly shut, and he didn't see Harry's left hand slipping between his splayed legs where they knelt on the sofa. Doing just as the magazine had suggested, Harry cupped Draco's balls first. The other boy gasped sharply, and his eyes peeked open in curiosity. Smiling, Harry pushed two of his fingers behind Draco's scrotum, and gently stroked the flat skin there in a hooking motion. Draco hissed through his teeth and his eyes squeezed shut again, his features taking on a pained expression. Soon he was jerking his hips erratically into Harry's hand, and came crying a vague, heavily vowelled word.
Harry's eyebrows shot up. He hadn't really thought about that. He had read ahead in the syllabus, yes, but only to the part about manual stimulation. He didn't really have a problem giving Malfoy a handjob; it was like masturbating, only in reverse. But putting his mouth on another bloke's equipment...
"There's no point in you taking a Muggle Studies course when you've lived amongst them for seventeen years, Mr. Potter," she said. "The spot in your schedule needed to be filled, and I had an uneven number of students. When your application came in the mail, the Headmistress and I were both immensely relieved to have both problems dealt with before the semester began."
The entire room went silent and Harry swallowed hard in the face of all of the awed expressions before him. He glanced at Draco out of the corner of his eye and saw him flush angrily. He would have laughed, had it not been for the fact that Mason's comment reflected upon him as much as it did Draco.
"Face cream isn't makeup," she corrected him offhandedly. "But that isn't the point. The point is that itworks. I'm willing to pay more money for it because it does wonders for my skin. This potion of yours... It may cost more, but if it works, the public will be willing to pay for it."
Only then did Harry give in to the demand in his knees, and sat. Dumbledore turned back round to face him and Harry forced himself to look, to see the damage done to the man in front of him, and to feel grateful for it.
Shaking off Parvati's hand, Lavender turned and fled the room. Parvati gave Neville a sympathetic frown before following her friend. Neville closed his eyes and dropped his head down onto his parchment. He felt Harry's light pat on his back and wondered just which one of them had it worse off; the one stuck with another boy that he hated, or the one stuck with the girl that he secretly loved, who hated him.
"Horribly," he answered, secretly grateful that the Veritaserum had worn off. The thought that he was lying followed close behind, and Harry growled angrily into the pillow.
He laughed and without thinking, she leaned in and kissed him. He raised one hand to cup the back of her head and kissed back softly. When they pulled apart at last, they were both still smiling.
Hermione and Ron tried to nod encouragingly but did not end up being very convincing, and Harry began to feel increasingly anxious.
It wasn't like last time; no awkward mashing of lips. Malfoy hesitated momentarily, then he was kissing Harry back, drawing him closer and opening his mouth to draw in Harry's tongue.
Harry and Draco dropped their half-eaten sandwiches reluctantly. Apparently the silently agreed upon ruse to eat as many sandwiches as their stomachs could handle hadn't worked. They'd gotten as far as five before she caught on to them. Moving more slowly than was strictly necessary, they made their way into the tent and turned to face Mason.
"Do you?" Harry asked.  Draco sighed, and turned away to look at his hands. Moments passed, as he seemed to be weighing his words. Harry had noticed that Draco made a habit of that. As if he mentally ran through lists of ways to phrase what he wanted to say, searching for the one that would reflect the best upon him.
"Well," he said. "I put in a request for Muggle Studies. It's required for Aurors, and I figured I could use an easy course this year so I could concentrate on my NEWTs."
"You didn't- It wasn't- It was him! Butyou made me want it!" Harry was screaming at him incoherantly now. He knew somewhere that it wasn't Malfoy's fault. He was just a pawn, like him. But at the moment, he was too angry to think of that.
He waited, his heart hammering against his ribs, as he listened to the goings on just outside the door to the booth. The voices rose, obviously in heated argument, and Malfoy laughed disdainfully. He heard him taking points away from every house but Slytherin, and then Lavender and Padma's angry protests. Neville remained silent, but Harry knew he would be glaring.
Harry resisted the urge to cross the space between them and knock that infuriating grin off of Malfoy's face.
"I'm not gay," he told the thin air for the sixth time. "Maybe Ron's gay. He was so interested in knowing what kissing Malfoy was like..."
He hadn't truly realized what he'd said until he heard Malfoy's quiet "okay", and felt a warm pressure settle onto his lap. Jerking his arm away from his face so quickly that he almost hit the other boy, he stared incredulously up at Malfoy.
Lavender huddled behind Neville and blushed to the roots of her hair, attempting to make herself appear very small. Pansy glared venomously at her, and Harry could have sworn that she looked jealous. Goyle appeared to be staring at Neville as though seeing him in a brand new light.
"I don't think I did hate you until the end of fifth year," Draco said softly, looking straight at Harry. "I was embarrassed when you rejected my friendship our first year. It stung, and I wanted to hurt you back. But I don't think I genuinely hated you, because if you'd changed your mind and asked to be my friend, I would have forgiven everything."
When the last of the sawdust settled, Harry found himself alone in the silence. It was then that he remembered where he was, and why it was a bad idea to wish people would disappear.
"Assurance," said Draco. "If I agree to stop fighting this, if I admit that I like it, I want your word that you won't try to continue it past this term."
Harry contemplated telling Draco about the magazine for all of two seconds before deciding against it. He wanted to maintain the upper hand as much as possible.
Pushing the door open with her foot, Hermione heard muffled sobs coming from Lavender and Parvati's side of the room. Sure enough, both girls were huddled there on Lavender's bed, Parvati rubbing Lavender's back soothingly. It was a familiar scene; Lavender was the delicate type and cried often. Hermione usually ignored it, but in light of the odd behavior of all of the Gryffindors involved in Sex Magic, she decided that feigning interest might buy her some answers.
Mason left quietly, leaving the two of them in uncomfortable silence. Harry took a breath and turned to say something, but stopped as he caught sight of something peeking above Malfoy's collar. A large, deep red mark showed starkly against the pale skin. Harry swallowed, remembering how soft Malfoy's skin was and how it gave under his teeth, how the other boy's sweat tasted.
His breath passed over Draco's ear and he felt the blond tense. Harry grinned, remembering the sensitivity of his partner's ears, and deliberately blew a soft stream of air over the lobe. Draco gasped.
Harry moaned, his eyes falling shut again as he arched into Draco's touch. He hadn't known until then that a smirk could be delivered telepathically, but he was learning much in this class.
Left to his resentful thoughts, Harry didn't notice the figure rounding the doorway of the trophy room until it was too late. He collided with something hard and pointy and it squawked.
"Too far, gentlemen," she told them. "I understand that it can be hard for the both of you, with this being the first time that you're experiencing these feelings, but I need you to practice some control. You're already far ahead of most of the class."
Draco was startled when a wall suddenly materialized between himself and Potter. For several moments after Potter had isolated himself, Draco stood at the wall, shouting demands and threats to take away House points for its immediate removal. Frustrated and a little insulted, he'd given up, flinging himself into a chair dejectedly and wondering why Potter had put the damn thing up in the first place.
McGonagall sighed. "Do you remember in your Fourth Year when we asked underaged students not to give their names to older students to put into the Goblet for Hogwarts Champion?" she asked him. "It would have been pointless. The Goblet makes its decisions based on the magical signature that is specific to each witch or wizard. Having an older person put their name in wouldn't have made a difference, because it was still their name. Similarly, for purposes of this class the Goblet was specifically attuned to perceive an applicant's willingness to participate in the course. The Weasleys might have transferred your name onto a piece of paper that you did not sign, but the hand that wrote the signature was your own, Harry. Now I know that you resent being uninformed of your enrollment, and that you dislike your partner. But unfortunately, you do have to go through with this."
Parvati Patil's perfectly executed carrying whisper, entirely unique to teenage girls, flew over the Gryffindor table the next morning like a very annoying bird.
Closing his eyes, Harry clenched his traitorous jaw closed and tried not to think about what he'd just revealed. When no scathing retort came from the other side of the room, though, he quickly snatched up the opportunity to return the humiliating favor in kind.
There had been no impromptu snogging this time. Mason had said that they could do whatever they wanted, and Draco had made it clear that he did not want a repeat of their last lesson together.
Harry had noticed that. Upon first walking into class, the row of small booths with heavy purple curtains along the far wall had caught his eye. He found his gaze drawn back to them and apprehension seized him at the implications of what the more private accomodations could mean.
Ron cast Harry a pained glance and Harry grinned in response, shaking his head. It was their seventh year at Hogwarts and some things would never change.
As quietly as possible, Harry slipped his cloth-covered hand over the doorknob and turned it ever so slowly. As the door cracked open, flashing lights of blue, pink and gold washed over the thin fabric of Harry's cloak. He stared in astonishment as he stepped inside, face tilted up to watch the swirling, glittering vortexes of magical energy dancing above dark peaks of purple velvet.
"Not with Neville? Oh, really, Lavender, please! I know that you have to do things with him in that class, but you don't have to... to make sure he likes it!"
"Take away more points, then." Harry told him with a shrug, pocketing Draco's wand. "So, why are you really in here?"
Harry was grunting softly with every other pull now, his heart beating erratically with the thought that they could be discovered at any moment. Crabbe and Goyle's fight was getting heated, and Crabbe brushed heavily against the bed curtains from Goyle's hard shove. Harry made a sharp sound and pushed his hips up, thrusting into Draco's hand.
Malfoy settled more snugly against him, seeming to have forgotten just who he was laying on in the midst of Mason's lecture. Harry glanced at his face and found him staring attentively at the Professor. He appeared blissfully unaware of the discomfort that his bum, tucked into the juncture of Harry's thighs, was causing the other boy. Harry grit his teeth and turned his attention back to the lecture.
"Harry? Harry doesn't have a romantic bone in his body, and his waltzing abilities wouldn't make a lame mule jealous. Let's be honest here, the only reason you wanted Harry as a partner is because he's famous. And Zabini because he's rich. God, you really are as shallow as everyone thinks."
Which meant that as much as Harry wanted to know what Draco was doing on the other side, Draco must not want Harry to know even more.
"Hey, Neville," Seamus grinned. "Bit of luck scoring Lavender in Sex Magic, eh? I woulda taken it, but I don't turn seventeen for another three months, and my mum wouldn't sign for me."
He shook his head. "It's a hangover remedy, Lavender. It's not like there aren't hundreds of others out there."
Harry sighed, reaching down to adjust his own discomfort as he sat back onto the uncomfortably warm and moist sofa cushions. The room smelled like sweat, saliva and the musky scent of two aroused teenage boys. At his wit's end, Harry screwed his eyes shut and willed a wall into existence between himself and Draco. He heard the other boy's startled shout cut short, and knew that the Room of Requirement had obeyed his wishes. He opened his eyes to see an indistinct white wall dividing the booth neatly in two.
"Good. Here you are," she handed each of them a small, plain leather-bound book. "You are dismissed, Mr. Malfoy. I want to have an additional word with Mr. Potter."
Harry snatched Malfoy's hand back, tugging it closer with a painful grip. "It shows," he told him, scraping his nails lightly over the Slytherin's knuckles.
"I just want my cloak," Harry began, trying to reason with him. "You can keep my wand, and report me to whomever you like, but just give me back my cloak."
Neville sounded worried, and Harry turned his face toward him. "Sorry," he said. "It was just... Nevermind. How did it go with Lavender?"
Harry cracked his eyes open and looked around before nodding and mumbling an affirmation. Draco's palm squeezed him tighter, pulling him slowly and seemingly purposefully. Harry got the vague impression that Draco had a plan, but he didn't care as long as that plan involved keeping his hand moving.
Harry gratefully shoved Malfoy away and jumped to his feet. The Slytherin gave him a vaguely confused and insulted look before schooling his expression into one of haughty distaste and rising to his feet. Harry briefly considered the thought that maybe Malfoy hadn't wanted to get as far away from him as possible the moment they were allowed, and it sent an odd sensation fluttering through his stomach.
Draco scoffed. "And how do you think that'll work? What with my working for the wizard that wants to kill you, and all."
Hermione shrugged, toying with a blade of grass. Harry could tell that she wasn't here only because he skipped a meal, and waited until she'd found the proper words.
Snuggling deeply into the cushions, Harry pressed his face into the fabric and inhaled deeply. He let it out on a muffled moan, and didn't know if Malfoy's scent lingered there naturally, or if the room put it there because he willed it there.
Leaning up, Harry caught Draco's lips in a kiss; one that was enthusiastically returned. Acting impulsively, Harry let his hand glide down from Draco's shoulder, over his chest and stomach, until his fingertips brushed the rough edge of his trouser's waistline. Draco stopped kissing him, pulling away with a look that was muddled with desire and uncertainty.
Feeling queasy, Harry took his seat next to Ron and stared down at his empty plate until he felt a warm hand settle on his shoulder. He looked up to see Hermione leaning over the table with an arm outstretched towards him and a sad, understanding smile on her lips. He smiled back briefly and turned to Ron, only to find the entire Gryffindor table staring at him expectantly. Apparently news had gotten around. Looking away quickly, Harry picked at a piece of toast until he found his eyes drawn to the one person he most definitely did not want to have to face.
Just then the door opened to admit one more person. Harry eagerly accepted the distraction and waited for the room to change, hoping that someone might prove to have worse expectations for the class than he did, but the room stayed the same. A witch in long, loose blue robes walked to the front of the room and turned to face the class. Harry's first impression of her was that she was rather ordinary looking. She had long, slightly wavy brown hair that was pulled back from her face and tucked behind her ears. Her eyes were blue and she wore no spectacles, and she had a light amount of freckles across the bridge of her nose and cheeks. Not the sort of face that you would picture when thinking of a person skilled in the arts of... er...
He opened his mouth to say something, but somehow 'good job' just didn't seem appropriate. A thank you, maybe? Somehow he didn't think Malfoy would appreciate that.
Harry and Draco looked at one another, both of their expressions defiant. Neither wanted to be the one to assign themselves the 'girl' role in this exercise.
Through all of his many dreadful classes- Snape's humiliating Potions practicals, Umbridge's godawful DADA lessons, Trelawney's rubbish- Harry had never been more sorely tempted to walk out of a class than he was right then.
Harry was strongly reminded of the staring contests that he and Dudley would sometimes engage in when they were children and irrationally, he found himself just as unwilling to be the one to look away first.
Harry stared at the darkened patch of material before letting his hand slip away, and Draco's robes fell back into place to obscure it.
"It's called small talk, Malfoy," Harry responded. "I figured that since we'll be spending quite a bit of time together-"
Harry let out a relieved breath and heard Malfoy do the same. The feel of his skin underneath Harry's fingertips made him distinctly uncomfortable, and he desperately wanted to pull his hand away.
Sensing his train of thought, the Headmaster quickly added, "I think you know, Harry, that if correspondence had been possible, you would have received news."
The Headmaster made a ghastly picture, ruined as he was, and Harry hesitantly took his hand, allowing himself to be helped to his feet.
"It's okay," Harry said quickly. "Ron, it's okay, really. Just another good prank by Fred and George, that's all. I'll go to McGonagall tomorrow and have her switch the class for Muggle Studies. No harm done."
"I've had the house elves deliver some sandwiches. You'll be completing the day's lesson after you've finished eating," she said, beckoning them out into the empty classroom. The rest of the students had left for dinner in the Great Hall.
Anger bubbling over, Harry threw the scroll back at Ron, feeling a bit of satisfaction when it bounced off of his forehead. Pushing himself out of the chair, he stood before his friend with clenched fists.
Harry glanced around the room, noting that most everyone had been paired off already and were either blushing shyly at their partner with pleased half smiles on their faces, or they looking distinctly unhappy. Then he heard his own name called.
Harry chuckled and shook his head. Malfoy was such a terrible liar. "And started with ours? I'm not convinced."
"Mr. Potter, I'm afraid you'll be going to bed hungry tonight. If I even see you poke your head into the Great Hall, you'll have detention. Understood?"
He was about to turn his attention back to his own dreadful Potions work when he heard the painting swing open and two tittering female voices approaching. Lavender and Parvati were in good spirits, it seemed. He grinned slightly, happy that he wasn't making Lavender miserable anymore.
"Call," he ordered, taking the coin between his index finger and thumb and flicking it into the air.
"Suppose that I am willing to admit that I enjoy our... sessions together," he relented grudgingly, turning to stare at Harry once again. "I'd want something in return."
The coin smacked heavily into Malfoy's palm and he whipped it onto his outstretched forearm with more show than was strictly necessary. When he lifted his palm, there was the engraved image of Gringotts with a crescent moon of numbers above it, indicating the Goblin who had cast the coin. Draco made a quietly outraged noise before snatching the coin back into the pocket of his robes. Giving Harry a cross look, he stood.
Harry looked up from his preoccupation with Malfoy's neck and drew a deep breath. The cloak was held limply in his hands, nearly forgotten, as Draco looked back at him. Both boys fell into silence, and whatever squabble they'd been having was no longer important. Harry felt as though smoke were filling his lungs, hot and choking. Draco swallowed, his eyes doing the thing where they flicked from one side of Harry's face to the other, as though he was weighing his options. Harry felt the insane urge to kiss him, and took a step forward...
Neville looked dejected. He hadn't meant to upset Harry, but he'd been rather curious. The other boys were a little too quick to dismiss the Goblet's decision as a fluke, but Neville open to a more insightful interpretation.
Harry wasn't surprised. He'd never pictured Lucius and Narcissa as very cuddly. But somehow that revelation seemed monumental. He knew the question hadn't been completely answered yet, though.
"I was only trying to stop you squirming!" Harry exclaimed, thrilled that it was true. "It wasn't my fault that you started pressing back against me! I couldn't help but get distracted."
The door handle clacked loudly in the silence, and Minerva McGonagall entered, sparing a brief smile for Harry before making her way over to Rosemary's desk.
They were nearly equal in height and weight, but Harry had the advantage of having wrestled with Dudley for over half of his life, and managed to restrain the other boy. After several minutes, Malfoy finally gave up his struggles and they paused, panting and sweaty, Harry's forehead resting against Malfoy's.
"What is that supposed to mean? I object! I am sitting here in front of you, telling you that I don't want this!"
Harry leaned forward suddenly, and Malfoy yelped and flinched back. Harry drew back as well and they stared at one another for a few seconds before a wide-eyed Malfoy swallowed and scooted closer. Harry took a deep breath and moved in again, stopping when their lips were close, but not quite touching. He felt Malfoy's breath feather across his lips and looked up into half-closed gray eyes before they drifted down to settle on his mouth. Taking that as a cue, he leaned in.
He let himself be pushed onto his back, and felt Malfoy's hand at his zip. The other boy fumbled for a minute, cursed against Harry's mouth, and pulled away to look at his shaking hands as they finally managed to work the zipper down.
"I don't know, Minerva," replied Mason. "At first I felt the same as you, but in the last few weeks I've seen something between them that makes me believe that... Oh, I don't know. It was wrong to force Potter, you're right in that, at least. But it may turn out well in the end."
Harry immediately shut his mouth with an audible snap. The Veritaserum, however, deemed it necessary to answer both honestly and fully, and he found himself drawing a deep breath to finish.
"Time is up. You all did wonderfully. I'll see you on Friday, and have a nice supper." Professor Mason called from behind the two boys.
Mason sighed. "Because, Mr. Potter, you are going to have to be the one to take control of this situation."
He was pleased to see the shock register in her eyes, and when he turned to head back to his essay there was a smug spring to his step.
There, hovering in the air, were the words, "Sit with your assigned partner." Harry heaved a sigh and made his way back to Malfoy's table and sat down, doggedly refusing to look at the other boy. Not long after, Professor Mason entered.
Draco drew a sharp breath and his hand spasmed slightly. Harry noticed, but decided to ignore it. Draco hesitantly ran the backs of his perfectly manicured nails over the underside of Harry's fingers. When traced Harry's palm, Harry jumped at the tingle that spread up his arm. It didn't quite tickle, but it didn't feel bad either.
Draco shrugged. "I can't bring myself to. If I know ahead of time, I start to think about it, and..." He gave an exaggerated shudder. "I dread these classes enough already."
Finding his glasses, Harry slipped them on in time to see Malfoy's look of surprised irritation. 'Caught him out, didn't I?' Harry thought smugly.
"I'm afraid I have bad news, Mr. Potter," she told him tonelessly. "Professor Dumbledore has reaffirmed my feelings regarding the matter, specifically pertaining to the Goblet of Fire. While there may have been foul play involved in your enrollment, your signature was your own. The Goblet made its assessment based on the qualities it found within your character. Had it found reluctance to participate in the class, we would not be here. There can be no mistake. I'm sorry."
"So, er," Harry spoke suddenly, lifting a hand to gesture vaguely, and noticed when Malfoy jumped. "Do you want to sit down?"
She was moving quickly when he caught up with her at the base of the stairs leading up to the girls' rooms. Catching a loose bit of her robes, he tugged her to a sudden stop. She whirled around with panicked look on her face. Neville thought she looked like a caged animal, her eyes flickering, looking for potential saviors to rescue her from him. He felt another surge of anger rise in his chest. Enough was enough.
If possible, Harry reddened even further. Hermione looked at him rather askance, seeming unable to decide between concern or amusement. Harry laughed suddenly and she shook her head, not understanding.
Frustrated, Professor Mason sighed and snapped, "Mr. Malfoy, place your head on Mr. Potter's shoulder."
Both boys moved forward a few paces and sat down in the nearest available open space, on separate pillows. Harry looked over to where Neville and Lavender were sitting to see his friend attempting to coax Lavender to lay her head on a pillow he'd placed his lap. When the girl stubbornly refused, he leaned in close and murmured something in her ear. She stiffened, but relented, curling up on her side with her head resting comfortably in Neville's lap. The boy looked over at Harry and smiled before placing his hand on Lavender's shoulder and rubbing in small circles.
"No! It's really quite brilliant, Neville." Lavender assured him. "How is it that you're so terrible at Potions? You understand the ingredients and their properties so well!"
"But I didn't want this!" she protested shrilly, her eyes going glassy with tears. "I wanted to be partnered with someone who was charming and good-looking! Who would give me flowers and sweets... Someone romantic! Who could waltz with me and sweep me off my feet. Someone like... Harry, or, I don't know, maybe even Blaise Zabini-"
Harry cried out in surprise as the stone against his back moved suddenly and he fell backward. Stunned, he jerked his head up and peered at nothing. The air seemed to be swirling. He squinted at it, only succeeding in making himself dizzy. Fumbling for his glasses, Harry shoved them haphazardly onto his nose in time to see the shimmering effect of an Invisibility Cloak being removed. Tattered robes around a wizened form appeared, before a wrinkled face surrounded by wild, frizzy gray hair.
Harry sighed impatiently, not in the mood to deal with Malfoy's evasiveness. "Malfoy, just tell me what it is we're supposed to do."
Harry felt Malfoy's mouth open under his and dived in. Draco made a tiny whimpering noise in his throat and pulled Harry firmly down on top of him. Harry let his trembling arms give out and settled eagerly onto the warm body beneath him, one leg between Malfoy's and the other knee dug into the cushions of the couch. Malfoy arched into him and he groaned, deepening the kiss and thrusting his tongue rhythmically into the warmth of the Slytherin's mouth. Malfoy's hands clenched over his ribcage and his left leg rose to straddle one side of Harry's hips...
Dumbledore's head shook, but with no neck it looked a bit strange. "It is not his tactical qualities that are of use to us, ladies, but his influence. You've seen the way the other Slytherins in his year defer to him. Where he goes, they will follow. If we can convince him to stay, the others will be no mean task. We cannot afford an entire generation of Death Eaters to swell Voldemort's ranks!"
Not only was Harry a virgin, he'd only ever kissed one girl. And that single kiss with Cho had been embarrassing, not to mention highly unenjoyable. After that singularly horrible experience he hadn't been very inclined to go searching for a girlfriend. Harry hadn't even really given sex that much thought. With schoolwork, Quidditch and trying to avoid the seemingly endless attempts on his life, he'd been extraordinarily busy these past six years.
"Give those over!" Ron demanded, plopping down into the chair across from him. "I'm so buggered for this test. Do you know how long it's been since I've studied Charms?"
"I realized that it wasn't your fault," Draco answered through gritted teeth. "My father made a poor decision and got himself caught."
"No!" Ron denied hotly. "No, that was all their idea! They told me they were going to help you meet girls. I had no idea that this was what they meant! The two of them only owled me about the Sex Magic part before I left for school this morning, and by then it was too late to do anything about it!"
Harry raised an eyebrow. "I was going to say 'hoping to escape'. You must've needed to sit down for a few moments, after witnessing those two molesting each other."
"'Fifty Ways To Please Your Wizard'?" Parvati read the article's title aloud. "Lavender, I hope you're only reading that for theoretical educational value."
"I'm only following directions, Malfoy," Harry told him, although he was also deliberately trying to unnerve the other boy.
Planting soft, open-mouthed kisses over the firm skin of Malfoy's throat, he worked his way down to his collar and back up. When he reached the highly sensitive earlobe, he drew it into his mouth and ran his tongue over. Draco gasped loudly and shifted beneath him, his body jerking with each lap of Harry's tongue. Too pleased with the reaction he was getting out of his partner to stop, Harry added a gentle nip. Draco fairly writhed underneath him, his chest heaving with shaky, stuttering breaths.
In the next instant the tables exploded into tiny splinters that sent Harry ducking to the floor and covering his face with his hands. When the rain of wood chips slowed, a few bouncing off of his hunched back, he stood slowly and tried to peer through the dust.
Harry's expression went dark and he noted Draco's look of surprise when he turned around to face him.
Harry had half a second to contemplate that before the idea went straight to his groin. He pictured Malfoy writhing beneath him, biting his lip in a struggle to keep silent as his housemates moved around just outside the curtains...
"I'm not scared," he said bitterly. "Of Voldemort, his army of Death Eaters and Dark Creatures, the war. None of it really frightens me. But this... this thing with Malfoy. It terrifies me."
"Gathering forces, allies," said Dumbledore. "His army is nearly complete, all of his old comrades found and amassed."
Tonight, however, the cobwebs were absent and a thick trail of dust extended out past the feet of the statue in a half-crescent. Harry drew up short, his sneakers scuffing loudly on the stone floor. He knew that no one could change the password but the Headmaster himself. So unless Dumbledore had returned, it would still be...
A flash of scarlet seen out of the corner of his eye was his only warning before the rolls of parchment were snatched out of his hands.
He cut himself off. Despite the fact that he currently had Lavender Brown- the most popular girl in Gryffindor, if not in the whole of Hogwarts- backed up against a stone wall and completely in awe of him, his heart was in his throat and his stomach was near full of butterflies. His bravado had its limits, and the urge to run back to his homework was strong. Still, he stuck it out, looking down on Lavender's beautiful upturned face longingly.
Harry smiled derisively and shook his head as he snaked a hand around Draco's shoulders to pull him closer. "Malfoy?"
Harry choked on his half-chewed mouthful, and couldn't tell whether his face was more red from lack of oxygen or embarassment. "Wha-? That's totally- You... how did you know?"
"You want to know what I think?" Harry asked, deliberately invading Malfoy's personal space and enjoying watching the other boy sweat. "I think you came in here because you wanted to. Because you couldn't help not to."
Harry clapped his hand into Malfoy's outstretched palm and gave it a hearty shake. The Slytherin used his grip to tug Harry closer and kiss him. Harry blinked, moaned, and closed his eyes. A cooperating Malfoy was definitely a much better Malfoy.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Will you just calm down?" he asked irritably, attempting to get a better hold on the squirming boy.
"Are we doing the same thing next class?" Draco asked him, and if there was a hopeful note in his voice, Harry told himself he imagined it.
So Professor Mason had told her assembled students when class had begun twenty minutes ago, and yet somehow Harry and Draco had wound up on the sofa, both of them shirtless and out of breath from a heated bout of snogging. Malfoy half-sat, half-lay on the sofa, one arm braced on the cushioned end, the other draped over Harry's shoulder as he clutched at the back of his neck. Harry knelt over Malfoy's torso, his hands digging into the other boy's scalp as he clenched his fingers in his hair.
When the gargoyle still did not move, Harry shook himself out of his dazed immobility. Approaching the statue at a near run, he slammed his shoulder into its side. "Goddamnit, Cockroach Cluster!"
A familiar Irish lilt carried across the courtyard and the two boys by the lake turned their heads to see Seamus, Dean and Ron coming down the slope.
He sighed, laying down his quill and rubbing the ache out of his hand, and glanced around the room sleepily. His gaze lighted on Lavender and he watched her chew the corner of her mouth as she concentrated on her Charms textbook. He smiled. It was nice to see her at ease for the first time since school had started. When she glanced up he gave a small wave. She frowned, her eyes going distant as she froze. Then, with a sudden burst of movement, she snapped her book shut, rose from her chair, and turned to flee.
Harry suppressed a grin. Malfoy was doing his best not to let his nervousness show, but with every step closer that Harry took his expression grew more apprehensive.
Unnerved and deeply shaken by the openness that they'd just shared, Harry sank lower in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest. After a few moments, Draco shifted in his seat, the creak of springs loud in the silence.
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his sweaty hair before looking down at his own neglected member, pressing insistently against the cotton of his bottoms. With a shrug and a mutter about ungrateful prats, Harry walked over to the sofa he'd left not long ago and set about dealing with the problem himself.
"Oh yes, you had to pick up a new subject to fill your Divination spot, didn't you?" Hermione dropped the massive book into her lap and sniffed disdainfully. "Good on you for finally walking out of that ridiculous class. Honestly, if that woman is a prophet, then I'm a Krinkle-Horned Snorkak."
"You see, my friends thought it would be funny to play a practical joke on me and forged my signiature onto the register for your class. I actually signed up for Muggle Studies-"
"I regret nothing more than keeping so many secrets from you when you were younger, Harry," he began, his voice weary and heavy with guilt. "I've given my reasons, but I admit, they did not seem so valid when spoken as they felt to me at the time. I am sorry."
The only problem that remained was how, though Harry thought he had an idea. And so, he decided, tomorrow would mark the beginning of his seduction of Draco Malfoy.
