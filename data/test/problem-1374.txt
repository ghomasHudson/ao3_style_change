Draco thumbed his thin wrist. “It is,” he whispered.
“It’s not love,” Harry said quickly, very quickly. The corner of Hermione’s lip pulled up in a smile.
Draco flushed even darker. “I . . . Alright. I’d like you to carry me, Harry.”
“I can try to talk to him about opening back up to you,” said Harry. “I’d be happy to do it. I’m sure I can convince him. I’ve been told I’m very persuasive.”
“It was hardly one mistake,” Draco scoffed, purposefully missing Potter’s point.
“What makes you so sure he’ll marry Weasley?”
“Hi. Sorry I’m a few minutes late. How are you?”
Draco wanted to sink into the sheets and never resurface. He was so, so fucked.
“Hey,” he said, rubbing Draco’s hand softly. “Remember, we’re only doing this if you’re ready.”
Narcissa sighed heavily, sitting back down. She looked down to the ground.
“Hello?” Harry asked, curious. He took a tentative step forward, feeling the wooden boards creak under his feet.
“So,” he said, wringing his hands together. “I wanted to talk to you about yesterday.”
Pansy exclaimed harshly, tone razor sharp. “You’re
“But you got the last ones-”
“You don’t know what he was like,” said Draco, unsure why he was so willing to defend Harry when Harry had taken his heart, crushed it into smithereens, and then danced all over the pieces.
“What an interesting name. I’ve never met anyone named Draco before. Well, I’m Cindy, and I’m your tech for today. It’s nice to meet you.”
“No, thank you, I’m sure it will pass soon,” said Draco, unsure why Harry was being so nice to him after how he’d treated him the other day. Harry had surely fucked Weasley again by now, and they would get together soon. Right?
“Mhm.”
Draco’s cheeks flushed a deep crimson, and he bowed his head.
“Because it’s the best sex I’ve ever had,” Harry admitted, words escaping him in a flush. He felt his cheeks begin to redden in shame. It would be easier to cope if Draco were still the same sniveling, bullying bastard he was all those years ago at Hogwarts. But the blonde-haired Slytherin had changed. And Harry didn’t know what to do with that change.
Potter ate it up like candy. He smiled back, bright and jubilant, and Draco was suddenly overwhelmed by the urge to break down and tell him everything.
“Maybe you should.”
. I’ve been in therapy for eight years and I still have a long way to go. I didn’t make nearly as much progress in a year as you have. You should look at yourself. You’ve accomplished so much this year. You should be really, really proud of yourself, because Merlin knows I am.”
“Draco, if I wanted to remind you of the stipulations, we’d be in an entirely different position.”
Everybody hated Draco, wanting nothing to do with him. Everybody wanted everything to do with Harry, without realizing that the Harry they wanted didn’t exist.
Draco melted a little at the praise, and he watched as Potter slowly but surely unbuttoned him until his dress shirt had flown open to reveal his battered, scarred torso.
“That’s because you did lose him,” responded Draco, holding onto Harry’s strong arms. “You lost your son, and it’s okay to grieve.”
“You’re so sexy like this,” Potter murmured, leaning down to plant a kiss on Draco’s lips. “So unbelievably sexy.”
Then he reminded himself that
Draco sighed with contentment and held onto Harry for dear life as Harry continued mercilessly fingering his reddened hole, and he choked on a sob as Harry hit a sweet spot deep inside him that had him convulsing and twisting his fists in the sheets.
“Harry . . .”
Draco stared back open-mouthed at her. He couldn’t argue, and she knew it.
Narcissa smiled softly. “You don’t know what that means, Harry.”
When Draco was discharged, he expected Mother to “pick him up,” since he couldn’t very well tell this hospital he was going to Apparate home, now could he? But instead of Mother, his best friend Pansy stood before him in all her Slytherin glory.
“Well, it’s not like money’s tight,” Ron said with a good-natured chuckle. Hermione elbowed him in the ribs.
I didn’t mean for that to come out. I’m the worst friend ever.”
. Which I know we both have experience with.”
Parkinson had the nerve to look amused. But then her expression quickly turned serious again. “Potter, I think something’s wrong with Draco.”
“My- My what?”
, almost as though he were something special, something worth looking at. “Here we are. Long way since our school days, huh?”
Harry could do not to pin him down and fuck him this very second.
you bring Malfoy into this lovely equation?”
“Hey, hey, what do you mean?” Harry’s gentle tone shattered Draco into pieces. “It was never about using you. I told you in that letter I lied to you because I was afraid.”
“Harry,” he said, “clean me up?”
Harry gulped.
“Come inside me,” Draco coaxed, gasping as Harry hit his prostate again. “Oh, Harry . . . Feels so good . . .”
Draco’s heart felt as though it were stepping outside into the sun after a thousand years locked away in the rain. The bare branches of his soul were teeming with new, budding, green life.
“Why are you rooting for us, anyway?” Draco asked. “You should be the angel on my shoulder, telling me to stay away.”
He had meant for it to come out harsh, but it only sounded scared and small.
“Good night, Draco,” Potter said, walking closer to him and pressing a soft kiss atop his forehead. It was so achingly intimate that Draco nearly trembled.
“Considering I have a mastery in Potions, I would say I enjoy this line of work, yes.”
Another tingle. Draco glanced down at his wrist to read the small writing.
, it drives me absolutely crazy! What do you want, Harry? You know what? Until you figure that out, I don’t want anything more to do with you.”
He wrapped an arm around Draco and dipped him into a kiss.
“Was that all it was to you? Just a kiss?” Potter asked him, and the intensity of the question nearly sent Draco’s heart into overdrive.
When the house elf answered and offered to take his jacket, Harry accepted politely and was ushered inside.
Harry nodded, never more sure of anything in his life. “Absolutely.”
Harry let out a long breath. Lying would be useless. “Yes. Yes, I do.”
Was Harry toxic? He had stayed with Draco all through the night while he was asleep. That had to mean something. Right? His feeble mind grasped for answers that felt just out of reach.
for later. And his anger at Voldemort for so thoroughly hurting the man he loved.
. Draco gulped involuntarily, because he’d
“And yet you’re continuing to message them,” said Ron.
“Okay?” Potter asked, moving the digit around inside him, feeling his inner walls, pistoning his finger at a certain angle to prod at his prostate. Draco’s eyes rolled into the back of his head at the toe-curling sensation.
“Hello, honey. What’s your name?”
Ginny groaned. “Why does this have to be so
He was in trouble.
“I know, it’s all my fault,” Draco said, agreeing with him. “I should’ve never let him in my home, I was wrong to-”
Theo nodded. “Not much to want, in my opinion. He’s a bit full of it.”
sorry.”
The twat.
“Y-You were?”
But then Harry’s words from last week echoed through his brain.
“Christ, Draco, that’s not what I fucking
“You don’t have to do anything,” Harry said, so gently it hurt. “All you have to do is be yourself and forgive yourself.”
me,” Draco spat.
“Hey, hey, deep breaths,” Potter crooned, stroking Draco’s hair and tucking it behind his ears. The hair, of course, did not stay.
He glanced at his wrist. The name glanced back.
“So what the
Harry moaned unabashedly as he felt his balls tighten up, and then he was coming, fast and hard, into Draco’s abused pucker. His second orgasm of the night was just as earth-shatteringly brilliant as his first.
“I-I . . . How are things with . . . Erm . . .” He had trouble recalling her name, but calling her the Weaslette was hardly appropriate, now, was it? “The red-head girl?”
it’s important that you do.”
“What is your history with substance use?”
Draco gasped quietly. That was such a
Draco folded the letter back up with a soft smile on his face, knowing no response was needed.
“It was different, with him,” said Draco.
“That snake,” Draco hissed. “She had no right.”
“There’s plenty of car shops around here that are hiring. Do you like fixing cars, or do you prefer selling?”
One drizzling, chilly afternoon near the start of November, Harry walked in just when Draco was closing up.
“No, you may not.”
Harry squeezed him tighter. “I’m learning so much about you already.”
Draco sighed, sinking further into his chair, feeling completely and utterly stripped bare. “Yes. Yes, I do.”
“How did things progress from there?”
Draco nodded wordlessly again. The tech left him.
“I’m sorry,” breathed Harry. “What?”
Draco couldn’t help but chuckle. They made pleasant small talk the rest of the way there, Potter asking Draco about the types of customers he got and Draco asking Potter about, well, anything that didn’t violate St. Mungo’s patient-confidentiality agreement.
So Draco leaned forward, tangled his hands in Potter’s surprisingly soft hair, and pressed his forehead against Potter’s, breathing heavily. Hearing Potter use his given name was about the most erotic thing he’d ever experienced.
Potter traced daintily over his scars, feeling the bumps and ridges of each one, how they stuck up slightly from his skin. His feather-light touch sent Draco soaring for the stars it felt so good.
“You heard me. Why not? She can give you everything you need, and here you are wasting time with me instead.”
“Hey, I didn’t mean that
“Draco’s forgiven me. He may not trust me yet, but he’s forgiven me. And I should tell you, we did, erm . . . share a kiss a couple of weeks ago.”
When Potter’s laughter died down, he examined himself, thumbing the material of his sweatpants. “I don’t need to do wandless for these, I can just slip them right off,” he said in his stunningly casual way. So he stood up and discarded his pants.
“You were certainly a sight to behold.” His green eyes twinkled with something Draco couldn’t discern.
“Harry, I’m closing. Is there something I can help you with?” Draco asked as nicely as he could. He’d dealt with some pretty difficult customers today, and all he wanted to do was go home and soak in the bath with his fancy scrubs.
Draco suppressed the urge to roll his eyes at Harry’s uncanny inability to ever grasp anything, ever.
“That being said, you lost your chance to be with my son when you broke his heart,” said Narcissa, turning around and gesturing for Harry to follow her. Harry followed her into the sitting room.
But he couldn’t contact Parkinson because he didn’t have her floo, nor could he tell her the reason why Draco needed company, because he’d sworn to Draco he wouldn’t breathe a word.
“Why do you care, Harry?”
“Please, forgive me for speaking out of place, but call me Narcissa. ‘Mrs. Malfoy’ feels far too formal, does it not?”
Draco shrugged. “It’s nothing compared to
“I’m his best friend. I know what makes him tick, what makes him happy, what drives him up a wall. I know it all. And when something’s not right, I can tell.”
his touch.
But it wasn’t Parkinson- it was Ginny.
“They all look good,” Draco told him honestly, and Potter
Draco smiled softly. He really, really loved her.
But he was
Draco raked his hands through his hair. “I’m going to get better, Pans. For you and Mother.”
“I can’t believe you’re in my head,” said Draco. “It feels . . . Weird. Really weird. But I like it. I like it a lot.”
When Harry broached the topic to him, Draco was stirring a pot of soup in his kitchen.
But suddenly Harry pulled away, startling Draco, making him realize that he’d done it again- he’d gone and gotten himself sucked into Harry without working out what they needed to work out.
Narcissa smiled at him. “Please call me Narcissa again. I’d like to be on a first-name basis with the man my son has-” She stopped herself from speaking, clearing her throat.
Harry sat with Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall for dinner, picking at his food.
“You’ve told me a lot of personal things tonight,” Draco said, deciding to be brave. He felt Potter’s hand slowly trail upwards, until his fingers stopped at the ridge of Draco’s wrist, where his thumb began rubbing soothing circles. Circles that both grounded Draco and sent him splattering all over the pub. “Can I ask why?”
Draco looked at him, then, drinking him in. His green eyes looked concerned, concerned with
“Draco,” Harry whispered, rocking them side to side. “Please don’t cry.”
“I didn’t exactly want to announce it to the world!” said Draco. “It’s bad enough I have a soulmate who will never want me. I don’t need to be humiliated by my friends’ pity as well.”
Harry must have sensed his discomfort, for he paused. “Draco?”
His right arm was smooth, unmarked territory. It would forever remain that way. His left arm was tainted, tarnished, ruined. It could bear the mark of as many scars as Draco pleased.
Narcissa’s eyes twinkled. Harry’s chest constricted.
“Y-You love me? But I thought-”
Ice-cold horror drenched him head to toe.
“I knew you weren’t happy,” Pansy said glumly. “You’ve been miserable for years, and I’ve been watching you slowly die-”
He couldn’t leave Draco alone right now.
“Now it’s time to wash your hair,” said Harry, grabbing the rose-scented shampoo and lathering a generous dollop on his hands. Draco turned back around and lay across Harry’s chest again, releasing a deep breath.
“Because maybe there’s a chance he likes you back,” said Greg.
“Draco, no, you are beautiful, so beautiful,” Harry exclaimed, taking a step closer and grasping his dainty hands. “And easy? Well . . . You’re basically calling me easy, too, you know?”
What had Draco done wrong? He wanted to ask Potter about it, but decided they weren’t on steady enough terrain for that kind of conversation. Would they ever be?
“Considering the Ministry kisses the very ground he walks on, the fact that he’s back here is a joke,” said Blaise.
“I know,” said Harry. “We’ve talked about this. It’s okay.”
“I’m listening.” Harry’s kind voice pierced Draco’s heart like a dagger.
Draco swallowed again. “Well, be that as it may, I wanted to talk to him first. Get to know him a little before I let him into my bed. But he, erm, well, he . . .” Talking was getting difficult. Draco’s shoulders were shaking with the effort not to cry.
Harry carefully closed the door behind him, and he barely had time to cover his mouth before a sob tore through him. He slid down the wall until he was sitting down on the dirty floor outside Draco’s flat. He had hurt the man he loved because it was easier for Draco to think he didn’t love him than for him to believe that the wizarding world hadn’t moved on from the war. If Draco knew Ginny wanted him to stay far away from their baby, he’d be crushed. All Draco’s suspicions would be confirmed, and he’d never come out of hiding. This way, Draco could move on and make a name for himself in the wizarding world again someday, if he wanted to. Harry sincerely hoped he would. Harry sat in the blistering cold outside Draco’s flat and bawled his eyes out until they were dry and aching.
Draco’s chest fluttered with nerves. But he nodded, anyway, because it was Potter and he wanted to listen to anything this man had to say.
“Brilliant,” he said.
listen to
“Of course,” said Harry. “Though it isn’t about being fair. Not to me. To me, it’s just about opening the doors of intimacy with your partner and exploring each other emotionally.”
But he and Potter weren’t friends. They never had been. So why was he-
“Well, if you’re so bothered by my presence,
“Honey, if you can’t calm down, I’m going to have to sedate you.” The nurse’s tone was gentle but firm, savory-sweet like a chocolate-dipped pretzel.
“But we can’t afford-”
Ron amended, like that made it better. Harry wasn’t sure why he suddenly had so overbearing an urge to defend Draco, but he didn’t like it. Not one bit.
“I want this,” Draco said, willing the words to sound as steady as they felt in his head. “I want you.”
“Try again,” Draco murmured on the third day that Harry mentioned it, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and planting a kiss to the back of his neck.
“Mhm. More, please.”
Blood, blood, blood, so much blood. Leaking out of her like a firehose, soaking her pants, soaking
“Teaching wasn’t for me,” said Draco. “I don’t have the patience for it. But here, I get to brew, and my assistant Nellie helps me sell. My business is still really small, but I’m starting to get a little bit of a name for myself. Word of mouth, so to speak.”
Narcissa leaned forward in her chair. “What did you do?”
Draco swallowed back more tears. He couldn’t tell this story if he was going to be a crybaby, now, could he?
Annie shook her head. “I am here to help you get better. A part of getting better is answering questions honestly.” She wrote something down in her notes, then continued.
Harry fucked Draco from behind, setting a brutal pace that had Draco moaning and howling shamelessly. Harry’s hand snaked around Draco’s throat, applying light pressure, and Draco keened. He made a mess of himself completely untouched, soiling the sheets, and flopping forward to lie in his own spunk, completely spent.
Draco remembered Harry speaking up for him at his trials. Giving his wand back. He remembered
“I get it.” Draco’s harsh tone cut through Harry like a blade. “I’m damaged goods. You don’t want to break me. You’re afraid to have sex with me after seeing what you saw.”
Mother’s eyes widened, and she gasped audibly. “He didn’t tell you . . .”
“So do I.”
“It is a crime against humanity that pureblood society doesn’t include hamburgers,” said Draco.
**Trigger warning for graphic descriptions of violence and an inkling of suicidal thoughts in this chapter
“That doesn’t matter,” said Draco. “I can’t want you, Harry, not after-”
Quick update because I'm on break
Draco felt his resolve begin to crumble like a warm, melty cookie. He allowed himself, just for a moment, to fall into the easy rhythm of Harry.
“Would you like to come into the sitting room for tea?” she asked.
Potter paused for a moment, then said, “Quicker and easier than falling asleep.”
Harry was right. The place was deserted.
“It seemed like a good idea in the moment,” Harry said sheepishly.
Harry talked him down, telling him that the Weasleys were kind and caring and understanding people, who accepted anybody who made Harry happy as long as they weren’t a serial killer or something equally sinister, which Draco certainly was not, Harry made sure to tell him. Because although it had almost been a year since the incident, Harry never wanted to let Draco forget again that he was not a killer.
Potter leaned in closer to him, reaching for him, and a hand found its way onto Draco’s face. Draco gasped softly.
Draco shook his head, but allowed Harry to continue cleaning. Once he was all fresh and soapy, he ducked his head under the water and allowed the rest of the soap to come off him.
And you passed out?”
Draco decided that the next time Potter came in, he’d ask him what the Draughts were for. He knew it wasn’t fair, he knew it was unprofessional, that it could cost him Potter’s business. But he had to try. Worry bubbled in his chest every time Potter walked through that door, and it was beginning to become a detriment to Draco’s health.
That explanation didn’t seem to settle Potter, though. “You shouldn’t have to downplay it like that. This is all so fucked up. You shouldn’t have to continue getting hurt after you were fairly tried and freed.”
“H-Hi,” said Draco, somewhat nervously.
“It’s alright,” said Narcissa tightly. “It’s to be expected.”
Harry decided to set aside his anger at Draco calling him the
“Well, don’t be, okay? I’m fine.”
When Harry would come, he’d mindlessly chatter with Draco about whatever was going on in his life. He’d talk about how his job was going, but not too explicitly in honor of St. Mungo’s patient-confidentiality agreement, he’d talk about Weasley and Granger’s baby, and he’d talk about Quidditch. Comfortable, safe, small topics. Nothing big, nothing major. Nothing important.
“That was . . . Mindblowing,” Draco said.
Draco, for one, couldn’t take the bubbling tension any longer. He scooted closer to Potter on the couch, until their knees were touching, and reached for his hands.
Harry had bottomed out with one single push.
“Who am I to deny such a polite request?” Harry asked, pressing one more kiss on Draco’s tummy before swallowing down his hard length. He didn’t often do this for Draco, but when he did, Draco absolutely
“I’m overreacting,” said Draco, sounding as though he were choosing his words very carefully. “She said one thing that hit a little too close to home, and it made me upset. That’s all.”
Draco stifled an ugly, bitter noise fighting to rise out of him. “Of course I am.”
“I-” But he was interrupted by the arrival of their drinks. “Thank you,” he told the bartender.
“Well, unfortunately for us, he doesn’t see it that way,” said Harry, feeling a fiery wave of possession roll through him at the prospect of Draco forming his own conclusions about his self-worth. Harry wanted to be the one to tell Draco how to feel about his worth. Harry wanted to be the one to hold him close at night and kiss his temple and whisper in his ear how loved he was, how incredibly loved. And how incredibly important.
“You did,” said Harry, quick to assure her, because he had a feeling if he didn’t his head was going to get hexed off. He had to remind himself that he was here for Draco, that he was doing this for Draco and their future. Not for sex, but for their relationship.
“Fuck,” he whimpered.
Draco’s head swam with dizziness, mind going all fuzzy as he lifted himself off Potter’s cock, gaping hole clenching around nothing, before Potter was all but tackling him to the sofa and easing his legs apart, sinking back inside him.
Draco walked inside, and after shedding his coat he immediately began unbuttoning his shirt.
“Hey, what’s wrong?” Harry asked him imploringly, and he sounded so gentle that Draco wanted to cry.
“No, I don’t want to hurt you,
He leaned down over Draco and pressed his lips against his again. Instantly, Harry knew all about the way Draco liked to be kissed. Sweet, but domineering. Tongue, but not too much. So Harry kissed him exactly the way he knew he loved, and eased his legs apart again, hoisting a thigh on his shoulder.
“She’ll never hurt you again,” said Harry. “And neither will I.”
“Then what’s going on?”
“I know you were only trying to make light of the situation, too, in your own sinister way,” Potter teased, though his eyes followed the trail of Draco’s hand.
“I said you’re right.”
Draco knew the subject was still sore as a fresh, open wound. He wanted to talk about it with Harry more, knock down more of those barriers. But he decided he would respect Harry’s wishes, and wait to do that another day.
Debbie sighed. “Once we transfer you to the psychiatric unit, you’ll be taken for a meal. Maybe you’ll be hungry then.”
“Thank you,” said Potter, raising his glass to cheers with Draco. Surprised, Draco allowed their glasses to clink together before both men took a sip.
“Ron, Harry, could you give Draco and I a minute alone?” Hermione asked.
“You ready?” Potter asked, pulling his fingers out of Draco’s hole which was dripping with lube. “You ready for my cock?”
“I had some personal things going on,” was what he settled on.
“What?”
“Yeah,” he responded.
“That’s . . . That’s wonderful, Potter,” Draco said, finding his smile to be genuine.
Draco’s cheeks flushed a deep crimson. “I read it in a Muggle book.”
“If anyone can do it, it’s you,” said Draco, realizing he’d never gotten the chance to tell Hermione that in person. There were a lot of things Draco had never gotten the chance to do, that he was allowing himself to do now.
As for lunch? Draco found it entirely too cumbersome to fix himself something to eat when he only had a thirty minute break, so he just spent the time reading a book in the back of the shop. As a result, he was ravenously hungry right now.
you.”
Harry popped his mouth off Draco’s cock, taking in his heaving form with pride. Only Harry got to see him like this. Got to reduce him to this.
“I’m not in
He noticed how Draco had backed away from him, giving him a sufficient amount of space, far more than he needed, frankly.
Emotions welled up in Draco’s chest so suddenly, so abruptly, that he stood up, clutching the jumper close. “Excuse me,” he said quietly, bolting away from the scene, missing Harry’s concerned glance.
“We were talking about you.”
“Until . . .
But Potter didn’t look subdued- Not in the slightest.
“Brilliant,” beamed Ron. “Do we know him?”
“Of course,” said Harry. “Anything for a friend.”
Draco looked. The burger came with swiss cheese, grilled onions, mushrooms, and garlic aioli. It looked mouth-wateringly delicious.
Annie looked at him funny again. “You’ve never gotten blood work done before? We stick a needle in your arm and collect a sample of your blood to examine to make sure your thyroid, iron, and other organs are in good order.”
“What for?”
Harry looked just a little hurt.
Harry’s concerned voice cut into him like a knife. Gasping and hiccuping, he turned around to see his boyfriend standing in the frame of the door looking worried.
After Draco’s doctor had briefed him on the long-term effects of liver and kidney damage, from having taken so many pills, he reasoned there was a suitable potion to make all that go away, something he would look into later. For the time being, he nodded along to the doctor’s Muggle medication and treatment recommendations.
Potter snorted as he removed the kettle from the brewer and poured the steaming hot liquid into the mugs. He took the milk out of his fridge and poured a modest amount into his cup. Then he reached for the sugar jar, plopping two sugar cubes into Draco’s cup. Passing Draco’s cup to him, he said, “Shall we?”
The room was uncomfortably silent for a moment while Harry summoned his courage to speak.
Harry approached him until their toes were nearly touching, and reached for one of Draco’s hands. Harry covered the pale limb with both of his own calloused hands, rubbing softly. The action was so gentle Draco could have fainted right there.
“Do you have someone over?” Harry asked, not making to move inside.
“More important than being there for the mother of your child?”
Harry couldn’t look her in the eye and lie to her. Not about this.
He incinerated it before even reading it.
“When are you going to tell your family?” he asked her gently.
him. He took pity on Draco, only wanting to help him because it was the right thing to do- Just like he’d only saved Draco from the Fiendfyre because it was the right thing to do.
Now it was time to play the waiting game, if Draco was expecting a response. Which he wasn’t, he told himself. He wasn’t.
“You okay?” he asked, taking one hand and rubbing circles on Draco’s stomach.
And fuck, there were so many pills, why had Draco taken
“Not accuse,” Harry corrected. “And don’t shoot the messenger- I’m only here because she made it seem like the world would end if I didn’t.”
“Yeah.”
Harry noticed Draco’s tension as soon as he walked in the door. It was ebbing off of him, and Harry racked his brain for suitable ways to calm his boyfriend down. He’d hoped the candles and the cleaning would be enough, but now he wasn’t sure.
. You think you can threaten to take my baby away from me by telling me I can’t be with the man I love? I’m not going to waste time telling you how much Draco has changed when you clearly will only ever view him as a monstrous, evil psychopath, but he is a part of my life and I do not see that changing anytime soon, so he will also be apart of our child’s life, no if’s, and’s, or but’s. Am I understood?”
“Whatever it is, I can assure you we can work through it together,” she said, though her tone held a hint of worry. She masked her emotions well, Harry noticed.
“I’d rather not do it anywhere right now, Draco, not with you all worked up,” Harry answered as unwanted concern began firing, firing, firing in his brain. All for Draco. He hated himself.
And Harry broke down completely as his sobs overtook him. Draco shushed him softly and murmured sweet nothings in his ear as he held the man he loved in his arms, something he thought he would never get to do again.
Draco wondered why Potter needed Peace Draughts. Were they for his girlfriend? Were they for somebody else Draco didn’t know? Were they for Potter himself?
“Are you his partner?” the receptionist asked him.
. Draco was going to pass out.
Pansy’s face fell several stories.
And after reading the comments on the last chapter, I have a few things to say. I'm trying my absolute best to keep Harry and Draco's relationship raw, and real, and flawed. Earlier in the fic we saw a couple instances where that line toed into abuse, but they're working on their issues and grappling with their feelings for each other while discovering what it means for them to be emotionally vulnerable. That is not an excuse towards abusive behavior, nor do I condone the type of relationship that Harry and Draco have at this stage in the fic. Thanks, that is all, and please enjoy the chapter!
When he arrived at Grimmauld, Potter answered the door with a saccharine smile and a fuzzy, maroon jumper with a large H knitted on the front.
Draco scoffed. “You’re talking to me like I don’t know that. I stayed with him in spite of that. It was easy, having no labels. But then we got in a fight, about something personal I do not wish to share today, and I blocked his . . . cell phone number. So he went and slept with his ex-girlfriend.”
“I am ready,” Draco said with a sigh. “Just nervous, is all.”
He had no choice. He had to act now.
Potter laughed, boisterous and beautiful again. The windchimes were back in full swing, and this time, Draco could hear them as if they were right next to him.
“No, seriously. Why?” Draco knew it was the alcohol talking, not him, and that if he were sober he wouldn’t be asking these questions- hell, he might not have told Potter this story at all. Which he was beginning to sincerely regret doing.
“Oh, I do,” lied Draco. “I want you to walk right out that door and never come back.”
“F-Fine.” Draco tried hard to focus on the subject at hand, but it was hard when Pansy had stormed out and now they were firecalling each other as though nothing had happened.
“I-I’m sorry, Potter, I didn’t know.”
“So polite. That’s much better. Touch yourself.”
Harry smiled. “I trust you, too.”
Nonetheless, he found himself turning around and heading back upstairs.
Eventually it was time for Draco to rinse his hair off, so he rotated in the tub and tilted back to get all the shampoo off. Harry couldn’t help himself. He reached for Draco, planting his hands on either side of his hips, rubbing the skin softly, coaxing him back up into a sitting position as he scooted in closer until their noses were almost touching.
“What are you waiting for?” he asked, mouth full of food. “Try it.”
Draco froze for a moment, surprised, but when Harry’s hands tenderly stroked his face and twisted in his overgrown blonde hair, he moaned quietly and opened his mouth to deepen the kiss.
Pansy’s smile faded. “What’s wrong?”
“Yeah,” said Draco, knowing that this could be it between him and Harry. He drew in a deep breath, willing himself to calm down. “C-Could you . . . Erm, I mean, there’s something I want to talk to you about.”
“You are dead to me,” he told her, nonchalant as could be, Malfoy mask falling perfectly into place. “Now get the fuck out of my floo.”
“I wanna break all our rules, every day, for the rest of our lives.”
“What about yesterday?” Harry asked, sounding strained.
Draco looked utterly miserable as he rolled back the sleeve of his left arm, revealing his tarnished, battered skin. Harry gasped softly, taking the wrist in his hand. The lines were fresh, raw, and red, blood still oozing.
“Well, I hope you don’t expect me just to swoon over and fall to your feet from a few nice words,” Draco said.
“Has what?” prompted Harry gently.
“If you don’t mind me asking,” said Draco, “why share something so personal? Are you sure your two best friends would feel comfortable with me knowing this?”
Narcissa only shook her head at him. “Take care, Harry.”
“Are you hurt?” Harry asked him, green eyes boring into grey. “Did somebody curse you?”
“What if I told you I’d guard your favorite color with my life? Not secretly- I mean, I’d want other people to know your favorite color. Certain important people. But if anyone ever made fun of your favorite color, or tried to threaten it, they’d have me to answer to.”
Draco shrugged. “What can you do?” he asked rhetorically.
As Potter leaned in again, Draco reached up and grabbed those god forsaken spectacles and tossed them aside. They landed somewhere on the floor. Potter kissed him without inhibition then, groaning into his mouth and thrusting his hips to meet Draco’s. Draco felt Potter’s hardness digging into his thigh, and he exhaled shakily. This was really about to happen, wasn’t it?
I just wanted to say thank you to all the wonderful feedback I got on the first chapter! I was so excited to hear about what you all thought. Here it is, the second installment!
“Pansy and I were talking about you,” he blurted out.
“Draco,” Harry said, and he sounded heartbroken. “You’ve been doing so well. Please tell me you aren’t going back to that frame of mind.”
. This was . . .
Draco looked back up at him, eyes wide.
A tapping on the window in the kitchen.
“Please, Harry, please can I come?”
“I’m not gonna just let you leave all upset like this.”
Ginny’s words did not register. That might have had to do with the ringing in Harry’s ears, but nonetheless, Ginny’s words did not register.
me all the time-”
The idea of Draco bathing, stretching out those long, creamy, lean limbs and cleansing himself was
Harry ran a hand through his thick, black hair. “I said what if it isn’t?”
“Oh, fuck, Draco-”
“Where are you going with this?” Draco asked, feeling his nerves grow by the nanosecond.
“We’ll do whatever you want,” Potter said, as the circles continued. “Take this as far or as slow as you want.”
“No right telling your mother that you were struggling to leave your flat? You were afraid to so much as walk to the store for two years.”
“I hope you don’t expect me to swoon over and kiss you now,” Draco said, voice
“Speaking of that, what are you going to do now?”
Draco insisted, and Harry glanced at his torso. After all these times they’d had sex, and he still wasn’t used to seeing the marks that he bore.
Potter laughed then, boisterous and loud. It jingled pleasantly in Draco’s eardrums like a melody.
“Really.”
“I can make sure of it.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry said, forlorn. “Ginny doesn’t want him around the baby, anyway.”
“I’ll be here when you wake up.”
let her go through this alone. Not a chance.
Draco paled considerably. “You wouldn’t.”
“Of course you will,” said Ginny. “I knew you would be. You’ll make a wonderful father.”
Draco sobbed out an incoherent plea as he entered him, and his world diminished to just Harry. All around him, above him, beneath him,
Harry’s face appeared in the flickering flames, disheveled hair and all.
“It’s rude to leave people standing out in the cold, Harry,” snapped Draco, sharp enough to cut diamonds.
Potter sighed. He did not look amused. “Just the Draughts, please.”
“Okay.”
“There’s protection charms,” Draco said feebly, “there’s Muggle contraceptives, there’s-”
Harry had stupidly, stupidly admitted that he trusted Draco. Telling Draco he trusted him was as dangerous as walking a tightrope because at any second, Harry could plunge to his death.
, and it very nearly made him yank his hand away from Potter’s.
Harry pulled away, and in the dimmed lights of his flat, his imploring eyes looked especially green.
“I- He’s not breathing, he’s dead, he’s dead, I need to get him to a hospital right now-”
Harry’s face darkened, and tendrils of fear clawed through Draco like a spider.
“I dunno where she lives. And I don’t have her Floo.”
. But he had to be strong for Ginny. Because he would
This was exactly what he’d wanted, and now that it was happening, he didn’t know how to handle it. Did Harry mean what he said, or was he only trying to patch things up so that it would be easier to get into Draco’s pants next time?
Draco knew Harry deserved better. He was being selfish by dragging him down. He deserved to be with Weasley, to start a family. It sounded like that was what Harry wanted.
Mother held out her hand, and Draco took it in his larger ones, rubbing the pale skin softly.
Draco made eye contact with Pansy, before remembering he was supposed to answer Blaise. “Right.”
“What about other mental illnesses? Anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia?”
“Ginny’s pissed at you, mate,” said Ron, “for missing her sonogram.”
“Harry Potter,” began Narcissa, and all the pleasantry and kindness had vanished from her tone. “You lie to my son about how you feel, break his heart, and then leave him?”
“I can reach out to Andromeda. She knows some people.”
Well, maybe Pansy hadn’t directly implied that no one would ever want him, but he decided to throw that bit in there because it was true.
“Shhh, it’s okay,” she cooed, stroking his hair the way she knew he loved. “I’ve got you. It’s okay.”
Walking away from the bookshop knowing that was his last time ever seeing it was . . . achingly bittersweet. Deep down, he hated the job because he was separated from everyone he had ever known, but he still had a soft spot for books.
“Yeah, I think it’s best if you do.”
Draco lowered his eyes.
“You two haven’t spoken in years.”
The corner of Potter’s lip curled up in a smile. “I’m glad you feel that way.”
“Take Ginny out of the picture. Pretend I didn’t fuck her. Then what?” Harry pressed, drawing him closer still. Draco suppressed a whimper.
“I-I can’t help it,” Draco said, hiccupping. “It’s all so much, I don’t know what to do with all their-”
He would never be able to provide Harry peace, happiness, or stability, all things Harry deserved and needed in his life.
“Yes.” Parkinson looked utterly humiliated.
“He, erm . . . Well, we came back here. And I just . . . Well, I should’ve known what he wanted right away. It’s my fault for not seeing it. It was obvious, in hindsight.”
Something happened to Potter’s face when he spoke just then. Draco noticed his eyebrows furrow together as if he smelled something sour, and he looked straight ahead, avoiding eye contact with Draco.
Ginny’s face was murderous. She ended the floo call.
They sat on either side of the wooden table that wobbled when Draco put his elbows on top. Mother, however, folded her hands in her lap, as was proper.
Draco turned to look at him. “What?”
and sank to the ground, hugging his knees to his chest as he felt weeks of progress slowly melt away.
“Come here, sweetheart,” Harry coaxed, and pulled a trembling Draco into his arms. “I was so, so stupid. I could have lost you
“Harry, I just came to tell you, I plan on keeping it, but I don’t want to put any pressure on you. You can be as involved as you want.”
Then Potter was pulling away from him, leaving Draco feeling so empty, and all he wanted was those lips back on his, and he was supposed to take things slow, but he didn’t
Silence stretched between them. Finally, Annie cleared her throat. She had a curly red bob and hazel eyes that were full of understanding.
“You’re a good man, Harry. I trust that your intentions are honest. But he’s still my son, and I’m still his mother. And if you ever hurt him, you have me to answer to.”
“Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!” Harry exclaimed as Narcissa was about to apparate.
“I should be relieved,” said Harry wetly. “I was nowhere near ready to be a father.”
Hermione stirred her soup, avoiding eye contact with both of them.
“Draco . . .” Harry sounded so sad, and Draco hated being the cause of that sadness. He wanted to be the reason Harry smiled, every day.
“Draco . . . Honey, just breathe, yeah? Nice and slow.”
“Hey,” Draco protested, but it was hardly a lie.
“Really graphic ones.”
“What?” Draco asked. “I’m sorry,
“He was obsessed with you all during sixth year, stalking you and everything,” said Pansy, and Merlin but she wasn’t helping!
“What?”
“What?” Ron’s mouth plopped open. “Harry, you told her and not me?”
With shaking hands, Harry fished out his mobile he kept on him for emergencies and dialed 911.
“So-”
Draco couldn’t see a Muggle therapist- not if he truly wanted to get better. But how could he explain that to Annie?
, and he needed to know who saved him.
“Yes.” She smiled softly, eyes twinkling. “You love him. That much is clear. He’s been begging and begging and begging for me to give you another chance, but I wanted to see for myself that you’d changed.”
Of course Potter knew what kind of brewer Draco was in school. Of course Potter knew these intricate, intimate details about him while Draco didn’t have a leg to stand on.
Draco was going to tell him that next time he’d let him buy four Draughts as long as he kept his mouth closed, but they were interrupted by a bartender asking if they were ready to order food.
“Do you love him?”
“Oh, so now it’s a crime that I want my best friend to
“No, I just need to get a proper idea of where your mind is at right now.”
“Yes, yes, Harry, just take them off,
“And then what?” he whispered.
Harry sat up in alarm. “What is it?”
“So that’s when the pieces started to fall together. I-I wasn’t safe in my own home. So I began kicking and struggling, but the man stunned me and next thing I knew, he was pushing me down on my bed and . . . And . . .”
“Because I can’t give him a family, that automatically means he’ll want her more?”
. I’ve been here for three days.”
“I’m sorry, what?” he squeaked.
Harry wanted to sink his head into his chicken and never come out.
“What? Why?” Hermione asked.
“I inferred,” Harry responded. “But it helps to know I know for sure.”
“You’re just so
“Well, you failed in that endeavor,” he said, all saccharine and sugary. He rolled the sleeves back on his arm again, and lifted it in front of the fire to show her.
“How many unborn children are you expecting me to lose?”
But most of all, Draco was bored. He was so, so bored, and when the tech said he had a visitor, he practically shot out of his bed. He didn’t care who it was- even if it was Harry, he’d be glad to see him.
But Draco answered, sniffling with puffy eyes. “H-Harry?”
Draco shifted his legs, and felt a lump beside him. Stiffening in shock, he sat up as fast as a rocket and glanced down.
Narcissa’s tea cup slipped out of her hand and landed on the rug with a soft patter, spilling its hot piping contents all over the patterned fabric.
Draco’s head snapped up, and he furiously wiped at his face, shoving his tongue into the roof of his mouth to prevent from crying more. “What do you mean, ‘what’s really going on?’”
“I’m sorry,” Draco blurted out, not wanting to be dramatic but unable to watch the worry lines in Pansy’s forehead crease any longer.
“You mean a telly?” Potter asked with a playful smirk. “You’d get along swimmingly with Arthur Weasley.”
“You’re the father,” Ginny continued softly. “You’re the only one I’ve slept with since Julian.”
“Draco.” Her tone had softened, and it made him shake. He didn’t think she’d ever spoken so gently with him. “You can’t . . . It has to be for
what he was doing, it was too late. Draco had already sunk his claws into him, and he had no choice but to hide it from Ron.
Potter’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline, and Draco was only a little hurt Potter found the prospect of him asking after his two best friends that surprising.
Well. He’d see about that.
Draco mewled as Harry’s dirty words filled his mind. He wrapped a trembling arm around his aching, leaking cock. Precum oozed out at the slit, and he began pumping himself hurriedly, knowing it wouldn’t be long now.
“At least I won’t get potential heart failure from the way I take mine.”
“I know you do, sweetheart,” said Harry, pulling his fingers out and positioning Draco the way he wanted him.
Harry chuckled fondly. “What if I carry you?”
“They have history.”
He looked at Draco.
“How can you- How is this- You work
“Harry-”
Pansy laughed.
“Say it again,” he whispered.
to relax, he wanted to know who had broken into his flat and saved him.
“Harry, it’s
“How was I supposed to know something was wrong? I’m a wizard, not a telepath.”
It was past five o’clock; Draco was sure to be home by now. Harry knew exactly where to apparate.
Footsteps pounded on the squeaky clean tiles, and there were more people in the room, more hands on Draco’s struggling figure as he wheezed out another breath.
“No, see you don’t cut into it,” said Potter. “Watch me.”
Harry.
One drizzling evening in May, because every evening in May was drizzling right now, Potter invited him over.
Harry kissed all across his chest, lips dancing down his ribs, until he reached the waistline of his trousers. He hooked his finger into the material, questioning.
“Well, it was good seeing you again.”
First thing was first, he had to spell the door unlocked to show Harry that he was ready for him to leave. So Draco did.
Guilt wrapped itself around Draco’s chest and squeezed like a cobra. He’d been the one to enforce the rule. He could have been nice and let Potter get away with it. Who would Potter tell? But he’d been a stickler because he’d wanted
“I love you more than anyone in the world. And she’s forgiven you. They all have.”
Harry did a double take. “I’m sorry, what?”
Potter’s concerned voice brought him back to earth, and Draco found that he was shaking profusely, with tears welling up in his eyes.
“We won’t do it today, though. Once we transfer you to the psychiatric unit, they’ll do it at some point while you stay there.”
“If that’s what it takes, that’s what it takes,” Harry responded with a shrug.
“What about Goyle?” Hermione asked. “I know they were close.”
Harry looked deep into his eyes. “It does. But not with me.”
fine,” Draco insisted, forgetting his manners and plopping down on the sofa without asking her if she wanted anything. “I was completely fine before Harry came along and ruined everything.”
As if on cue, the bell above the door jingled and in walked an old woman. Draco had half a mind to ask her if she was lost.
“What’s your relationship like with your parents?”
“Right there?” he asked huskily.
caused Harry to deteriorate like this?
Draco snapped back to reality like a rubber band. “Huh?”
“Do you honestly think forcing ourselves together
Potter’s face did something that made Draco nervous- he almost looked worried. “That’s . . . That’s really not fucking okay. I don’t have personal experience, but I’ve heard those hurt. A lot.”
, he silently urged the green flames.
Over the past few weeks, they’d gotten to know little things about each other. Things that didn’t seem important, but were.
“Then stop acting like one.”
Draco’s very blood froze.
because of him. God forbid he inflict harm upon another one of my family members-”
His hair was a mess, he hadn’t showered, and he was wearing plaid pyjama pants with an oversized tee shirt that hung off his small frame.
“Why would you say that?” he asked, circles stopping.
“I can’t believe Malfoy tried to kill himself,” said Hermione dejectedly. “He has so much to live for . . . If he would just give himself a chance, he would see that there’s still a place for him here.”
“Please don’t cry, Malfoy,” Potter said, thumb brushing away a tear mark on Draco’s face. “Please don’t cry.”
Potter smiled at him- soft and shy. “It was the least I could do. Your mother saved us all.”
“I only meant that no matter what you tell me, it takes
“F-Feels so
Standing in front of him, tall and smiling, was Harry Potter.
Draco flushed. “Any time.”
Potter said, sounding confounded, and that released the floodgates for Draco. Tears flooded down his face, and Draco slapped a hand over his mouth to muffle his sobs. Potter scooted closer and pulled him into his arms, a touch Draco gladly welcomed.
Or as comfortable as one could get after a bomb like this was dropped.
“Ron and Hermione are busy with the baby, Luna’s abroad, Neville’s at Hogwarts so I don’t see him much, and the Weasleys all have their own stuff going on. I dunno, I just thought . . . I thought maybe you’d be someone who could listen.”
he soothed, knowing Draco was experiencing everything he was feeling in this moment. “It’s okay, it’s okay.”
Draco’s cheeks flushed a generous coat of crimson.
Draco felt anger for Harry in that moment, searing hot anger. For telling his mother about their relationship before Draco had the chance to.
Harry stared at him, blinking. He didn’t move. He didn’t reach for Draco. He didn’t even smile.
“Keep talking like that,” Harry told him huskily, fingers quickening their pace inside him. Draco inhaled sharply as Harry prodded his prostate.
“I can’t, Harry. You know that.”
. That tone was going to unravel Draco piece by piece until there was nothing left of him.
“Gonna take such good care of you tonight, baby,” Harry murmured, pressing a kiss against Draco’s temple. “Gonna make you feel so good. So, so good.”
“I’m sorry, Malfoy,” said Potter, and the worst part was he truly sounded it. “I’m really sorry.”
Harry didn’t think that was true, since he didn’t have anybody to take pointers from. His closest thing to a father was Sirius, who had died when he was only fifteen.
An idea suddenly occurred to Draco. An idea so random, so crazy, so . . .
And oh, how Draco wanted to
“Do you understand?” Potter continued, scooting closer to him until their knees brushed. “This is not your fault.”
Which is why several minutes later when Draco’s wrist tingled, with an incoming message, he nearly doubled over in shock.
told him to get comfortable, though, hadn’t he? “And I take it neat.”
Draco’s shields
“Mhm,” was all Draco seemed to be capable of saying. “Harry, I- Ohhh.”
“S-Stop,” he cried weakly, voice sounding scratchy and foreign to his own ears.
“Glad to see you’re awake again,” she said in that same saccharine tone that made Draco want to vomit.
Potter nodded.
try to act like you know me just because we’ve slept together,” Draco continued. “I’m perfectly happy here, thank you very much, and for once in my life I have some peace and quiet. Surely, being the celebrity you are, you can appreciate that, right?”
Harry looked skeptical.
Draco buried his head in his hands.
“Let’s say I wanted to be a Potions master. They’ll take one look at my application and incinerate it.”
“It wasn’t so bad,” Draco lied passively.
A drop of blood dripped from Draco’s left arm, landing on the cream carpet with a silent splatter.
“Incidentally,” continued Potter, “about a year after we broke up, I figured out I was into blokes as well as girls.”
Draco continued to stir and overthink until the clock chimed eight, and he couldn’t take it anymore.
“You want to know what she told me?” Harry asked him, stepping closer to him. Draco did not back away, but he did stiffen. “She’s worried about you. And she didn’t directly say this, but I think she’s concerned you’re going to do something to hurt yourself.”
Draco’s blood turned to ice.
“Potter?” he said.
Harry responded with a moan of his own as his lips danced with Draco’s in tandem. Draco couldn’t get enough. He had buried his feelings for Harry so deep, repressed them so thoroughly, that he had entirely forgotten that they were there. And there they were, alive and feral, clawing at the gates, begging to be released.
“Er, Draco?”
Once they were comfortably seated on the couch, Harry wrung his hands together while he waited for Narcissa to continue speaking.
“Harry! Are the rumors true? Is it true that you’re romantically involved with former Death Eater Draco Malfoy?”
“Don’t have his information, either,” said Harry. He absently wondered who of Draco’s Slytherin friends he still kept in contact with, if it was just Parkinson and he’d pushed all the others out or if he still kept a cozy, tight-knit circle.
“Make yourself comfortable in the sitting room,” he said, walking into the kitchen. “And I’ll make the drinks. Would you fancy a whiskey?”
Harry’s eyes slowly moved back up to Draco, who stared at him in horror.
“I dunno, maybe they were jealous,” Harry said scathingly. “Maybe my aunt wished she had magic instead of my mum. They definitely resented having to raise me.”
“See? There’s that smile I love so much,” said Mother quietly.
“Bellatrix Lestrange.”
“So pretty for me, all laid out like this,” said Harry between breaths. “All mine.”
Potter shook his head. “I’ve thought you were fit ever since I first walked into your shop. I saw you standing there, looking all elegant and posh and . . .
Potter moaned, eyes darkening even more. “Of course you can do that.”
“I-Is everything okay?” Draco asked quietly.
Hermione, on the other hand, was far more understanding. When Harry had come clean to her, she had merely nodded and told him in gentle tones that she wasn’t all that surprised.
Draco gulped. This was dangerous territory, very dangerous. He needed to regain proper footing, and fast.
Except he was also wilting, because Harry was not his lover, nor his sun. He was his poison.
Draco had been wrung dry. He’d cried all his tears into Pansy, thoroughly soaking her shoulder. He didn’t even think he had the energy to cry he was so tired.
“I’ll never be able to escape the things I did,” said Draco.
“Would you like anything? Tea?” Potter asked, and he looked so kissable that Draco wanted to pounce on him, hold on tight and never let him go.
Was Draco just a body? He decided not to dwell on it, not when Harry was so close to delivering on his promise.
He thought of the Death Eaters and the Dark Lord probing his mind, goading him for information that he tucked deep, deep away in the very back corners of his head. He shuddered.
“Alright,” Harry said, “that’s it. Lock up. I’m taking you to get something to eat. I know a great Muggle burger joint a few blocks down. We’ll walk.”
“I c-can’t believe I let this happen again-”
“That’s just it,” said Draco. “I’m not sure I’m okay with giving him that information.”
“What’s your point?”
“You’re so beautiful,” Harry told him. “I dunno if I’ve ever properly told you that before.”
, Draco. Not everything is about sex, alright?”
“I’m not going to hurt him,” Harry said. “He doesn’t have feelings for me any more than I do for him.”
“It doesn’t seem like you are,” Harry said softly, and apparently that was the wrong thing to say, for Draco fixed him with an indiscernible expression and sauntered closer to him.
“There’s a lot you don’t know about me, Potter.”
“Are you okay? You sound funny.”
, that he and Potter weren’t dating, that he was just going to Grimmauld,  but he still wanted to look like he’d put in some effort.
“He’s not at St. Mungo’s.”
. “Fucking.”
Potter’s eyes twinkled again, and Draco squirmed. Had he just made a huge mistake?
and they were looking at him so
Thing is, Draco
“Then what are you-”
Harry sighed. He wasn’t actually
“Because-”
. It had been so
“It was the same,” Draco responded. “But I love what I do, so it was a good same.”
Harry sighed. “That’s not what I meant, Draco. What we have is amazing- I wouldn’t trade it for anything. It was just a question. I won’t bring it up again.”
“Only to see how evil I was,” said Draco dejectedly.
“You don’t know what he’ll do unless you ask him,” she said.
“Harry, this is so much, I dunno if I can take it,” said Draco, on the verge of sobbing.
“Harry, what did she say?”
Draco’s hand stiffened in Harry’s. His jaw went completely slack, pink lips parting slightly. “W-What?”
Debbie departed, and Draco was left to his own devices. He’d really screwed up this time, hadn’t he?
“Are you taking it?”
“So you admit something’s wrong,” Harry tried, wanting to see if Draco would cave.
Ginny scoffed. “Him? Apologize?”
“I’m sorry.
“I have told you
“So, let me get this straight. He firecalls you, then sees you with Ginny, automatically jumps to the worst case scenario, and blocks you from contacting him again. Sounds about right.”
“You thought you’d assure me that I’m the only fuck toy at your disposal? Wow, I’m so relieved,” Draco snarled.
Harry looked deep into her eyes that were so similar to Draco’s. “Yes.”
“He seems happier. Lighter. Freer. And I think you may have a big part in it.”
Potter was no longer the scrawny, knobby boy he’d been in school. The Potter standing before him today was clearly a
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “So you care why? We’re not here to talk about why I’m
tell me to calm down,” Draco ordered thunderously, stopping in his tracks to speak before resuming his pacing.
Narcissa’s face softened even more. “Harry . . .”
He glanced through the peephole, and sure enough it was Pansy.
“He knows I wanted a relationship at one point. He doesn’t know I’m in love with him.”
“I don’t doubt it for a second,” Harry grinned. “Yeah, I’ll go out with you.”
. He needed to know where Potter stood. Did he like him? Did he hate him? Was this all some elaborate prank to humiliate him?
“This is where we have a problem,” said Draco. “How am I supposed to know something like that won’t happen again?”
“Are you
“I wasn’t aware I needed to let you inside my head for sex to be passionate and intimate, Harry,” Draco said somewhat crossly.
Draco looked at him, crestfallen by the quick change in mood. “Okay,” he whispered.
“But why would they want to talk to you about theirs?” asked Hermione.
Annie’s friendly, kind tone and warm smile took Draco by complete surprise. He had been expecting cold and clinical, had been expected to be treated like a specimen as opposed to a regular human being. But the woman standing before him showed no signs of frostiness, which unnerved Draco.
“Of course it doesn’t,” said Hermione. “I know he’s helped you. But not before you helped yourself. You picked yourself up from the very bottom and got yourself better before you went back to Harry. For that I am incredibly proud of you.”
, are you sure you’re okay with this?”
Draco found his embarrassment to be utterly adorable, though he would never,
“There, just . . . Just breathe, yeah?” Harry’s soothing voice was like balm on his open wounds.
“What is that?” Harry asked.
“Alright. I’ll see you,” he said. Then he apparated.
Pansy and Blaise exchanged a grin.
Draco did that thing again where he looked like he didn’t believe him.
“Oh, fuck, Harry-”
Guilt flooded Harry’s stomach, twisting it into knots. He already had. So, so much.
“So you come crawling back as soon as there is no child.”
Draco could have fainted right there on the spot from dizziness.
“It’s alright,” Potter said gently, turning toward Draco and offering him his hand. Draco, humiliated, took it and stood up himself. “I’ve an early morning at the hospital, anyways. I should be off.”
“Hermione and Ron are four months pregnant, actually,” Potter said, and Draco was frankly shocked he was revealing something so personal. He expected some small talk, something along the lines of “the usual” or “good, they’ve been just fine,” but not this. Never this.
he exclaimed.
“It’s just . . .” Harry realized that if he never tried, he would never know the truth. “I’m sort of in love with you, that’s all.”
“I-I don’t know, I mean, wouldn’t we be seen? I can already read the headlines: Saviour of the wizarding world and questionable company, the Death Eater: a most unlikely match.”
“Nothing, I just . . .” Potter took a deep breath. “I had a really good time tonight.”
“I’m acting so
That one hurt. But Harry barreled through, because some things were more important.
“I want it now,” said Draco, sounding debauched. “All of it.”
“Is there something I can help you with, Harry?” Draco asked, and his tone was far gentler than Harry was used to hearing. It unnerved him, and warning bells went off in his head.
He swung it open to let his guest open, and instantly he noticed something was off.
“I-I dunno,” Draco said, fiddling with the sheets as his nerves grew. “I don’t . . . Really go anywhere except work and the store. But it’s fine. I was really fine, until . . .” He cut himself off when his eyes began to water dangerously, and he swallowed thickly.
“But you do.” Harry moved closer to him, lips latching onto the sensitive expanse of his neck and moving towards his jugular, leaving a trail of hot, wet kisses in his wake. Draco sighed as his neck tingled from the treatment.
“Did he try to start things back up again?”
Draco’s blood went cold. He stiffened, and Annie must have noticed, for she said, “It’s important you answer honestly. It’s only a detriment to yourself if you don’t.”
“I know you are, sweetie, I know. And it’s okay. But if you stay locked away here forever, you’ll be miserable. I know you want to come back. I can see it in your eyes. You belong with us. You belong at
Soon enough he got to Draco’s door and knocked. He waited for a while. No answer. He knocked again.
and asking if I was
“So full of it,” he said. “I don’t even know why he decided to come back. He could have any job he wants.”
“I . . . Forgot my umbrella.” A slight flush rose to his cheeks at the words, because it meant that he and Potter had to share.
“Mhm,” Draco nodded, sighing audibly as Harry brought the loofah around his crotch and washed all his nether-bits. Harry was still in denial that he got to call this gorgeous man his own.
“I don’t drink,” Draco answered.
“Narcissa, what I’m about to tell you . . . It’s a pretty big deal, to say the least.”
“I know I’m not good enough for you. That’s why you slept with her, isn’t it.” Draco was goading him, saying these things for attention. He knew he was riling him up, and he knew it would work. He knew him.
“Do I have to answer that?”
“Nothing,” Draco said lightly.
the burger, with his
“It’s okay,” Potter told him kindly, taking a sip of his slightly cooled-off tea.
“Yes.”
Draco sniffled, shaking his head. “I’ll make more of an effort,” he said. “I’ll visit you more often, I’ll write to you regularly.”
“I didn’t mean it,” Harry said again, this time looking at him so directly Draco wished he’d look away.
“Potter?” Draco tried again, eager to get to the bottom of this.
“You have it,” Harry answered, as though on autopilot. “You have all the time in the world, Draco. I’m not going anywhere.”
proud?” Potter asked again.
It sounded absolutely dreadful. Draco had thoroughly isolated himself from the entire wizarding community, but that was a drop of water compared to how he was going to feel now. Nobody knew he was here; Harry didn’t count. Harry was probably at home thinking about how weak and pathetic Draco was.
“Harry Potter,” she said coldly.
“Y-Yeah. I’m fine.” Draco straightened his posture, then cleared his throat. “Anyway, I was saying that you can’t blame yourself for that. It’s preposterous.”
“Mhm.” Potter was fixing him with one of those looks again, those looks that Draco couldn’t discern, that cast a warm spell inside him.
“Harry, we can’t-”
There was no way Potter had just- Potter hadn’t just- Had Potter just
like they were a couple was enough to make his eyes water. Nonetheless, he did as he was instructed, inhaling a deep breath and feeling his body slowly relax.
“Don’t remind me,” said Draco.
, and the nurse’s voice was growing harsher as he refused to listen and calm down. Every breath he gulped down felt like a stab in his chest, a reminder that he was
“Right,” said Harry, “I know. But you seemed pretty upset when you saw her in the firecall, so I thought I’d-”
Potter’s hands traveled from his hair down his face, all the way down past his neck and shoulders, and to his ribs where they began lightly smoothing his clothed sides up and down, up and down. Draco shuddered into his touch.
“I don’t blame her,” said Ron.
was . . .
“You still want to bathe, sweetheart?” he asked.
Harry’s brows furrowed in concern.
“The truth. That I don’t have one yet.”
Draco began to feel queasy. “W-What does that mean?”
for this. I don’t know why I feel the way I do about him. But I just do, alright? Now, I’d appreciate it if you were actually fucking supportive instead of making this all about you.”
“Draco, you know I love and support you no matter which gender you choose to date.”
about me!” Draco exploded, raw and bleeding like his arm. “You don’t know what it feels like to live with the things I’ve done. People may have died for you, but you’re a hero-”
“Harry, r-right there-”
“Somehow, this doesn’t feel like that.”
“Shhh, just . . . Just let me hold you, yeah?”
Harry leaned in again, except this time he took extra care to place his hands on either side of Draco’s rather lovely face and kiss him with such tender fervor that he felt a tremor coming from his lover’s body.
, and all I wanted to do was get my hands all over you.”
, he reminded himself.
Ginny nodded. “I haven’t told them yet,” she said meekly.
Harry wanted to date him?
Harry automatically answered, “Yes.”
know whether Draco would have the courage to apologize. There was still so much they didn’t know about each other, and while it was obvious in some regards that Draco had changed, there were still many layers of his person to peel back that Harry hadn’t a clue whether he’d be ready to step up.
As promised, Potter firecalled him, about a week later. They talked on the phone for a while, and they fell into an easy routine where every Friday evening, Potter would firecall Draco and they would talk for a good thirty to forty-five minutes. He still came into the Apothecary every two weeks, and he still refused to allow Draco to bend the rules for him.
Harry was still in denial. Draco
Harry’s eyes fluttered shut as images of Draco lying on his back, moaning and writhing and panting, blinked in his mind one by one like Muggle flipbook animation.
“Harry, I’m pregnant.”
“This morning.”
“Mother, I . . .” Draco couldn’t get those three little words out. They gummed up in the back of his throat. So he reached for a slightly safer topic. “How did your conversation with Harry go?”
“You . . . What are you doing here?”
“That doesn’t make any sense,” said Draco. “How can you say something is your fault when you know it isn’t?”
“I shouldn’t have to.” Draco willed his expression to stay neutral.
“Draco, we need to
“This
Pansy made a choked noise in the back of her throat, face draining of color.
Draco rubbed his belly, feeling sated and full in a way he hadn’t in a while. His friend had a point- he really did need to take better care of himself.
want to tell him. So much, even though he was terrified out of his mind. Not another soul knew about this, not even Pansy or Mother. Right now, up in his head, all it could ever be was a memory. But he was afraid that by telling, that would make it real. Tangible.
“No strings is all I can do, Draco. You know that.”
He wasn’t
Draco’s heart tightened up.
“Why?” Draco asked. “You could sell it, make a boatload, and find someplace nice that you truly love.”
“Malfoy?”
Sighing audibly, Harry reached for Draco’s hands. Draco allowed him to take them.
Draco didn’t have a clue what any of those were. “I . . . I’ve never done a marijuana or a cocaine.”
“You’ve gone mental, Harry.”
Horror immediately engulfed him like an ocean wave, powerful and all-consuming.
Draco’s flush spread down his neck, all the way to his chest. He attempted to cover his face, but Harry pried his hand away. “I like it, too,” he told Draco. “I like seeing all your reactions while I fuck you. It gets me so hot. You get me so hot, Draco.”
“What’s wrong?” he asked, reaching for him, but Draco flinched back. He couldn’t touch him. Things happened when he touched him, unstoppable things, and Draco knew he would shatter the instant Harry laid his hands on him.
“Fuck the rules right now,” Harry said softly. “Some things are more important. What did she say to you that made you this upset?”
“You were
He ordered takeout to appease Pansy, saving the boxes and storing the leftovers in his fridge in plastic tupperware, lying to himself that he’d eat it later. He only bought the bare necessities at the store. He fell into a monotonous cycle of work, sleep, and Pansy’s visits, which were growing less and less frequent by the week.
Draco blushed something fierce. “No!” he exclaimed. “What makes you say that?”
“I’ll be right with you,” Draco told him formally, returning his attention to his current task.
Laughter bubbled inside him, threatening to escape. He let a little chuckle out. “You don’t have to be polite about my home, Potter.”
“Draco, I’m so sorry,” Potter said, and it sounded like he was on the verge of crying.
Harry looked at Hermione for support. She wore a grim facial expression like a fashion statement. Sighing, he turned his attention back to Ron.
Draco let his eyes fall closed.
“I understand that,” said Harry. “But I should tell you he has forgiven me.”
