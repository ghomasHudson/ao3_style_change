A chance encounter at a karaoke bar – yes, he'd been drunk, one had to be to engage in karaoke at all – with the lead guitarist of Black Camelot, recently sans a singer, had led to a meeting with the other blokes in the band, a little 'jamming,' and before Draco knew it, he had a day job. Or a night job, rather. It was rare that any member of Black Camelot saw more than an occasional glimpse of daylight.
“Perhaps Black lost his virginity there - perhaps he liked the name. A fan of Shakespeare, maybe, how should I know? But it is there that he asked for a headstone, and it is there that Harry had it placed in his memory.”
Draco was silent for several moments – he would remember that moment for the rest of his life. Harry's voice had been so cool, so dismissive. "You took forever.”
He'd pull on some boxers – it was a challenge to find clean ones, and he was often reduced to turning already-worn ones inside out – and sit back down on the edge of his bed, lighting a cigarette and staring and smoking for the next five to ten minutes. Some people pulled out a prayer mat and faced Mecca, some folded their bodies into origami in the name of enlightenment, and some chanted while incense burned. Harry Potter sat on his unmade bed in tatty boxers and smoked Marlboros. It worked for him.
in the world, so let's embrace the International Date Line like reasonable people, shall we? But he hadn't been able to do it, in the end – apparently, he still had some sense of propriety buried somewhere deep inside the wrecked shell of his body.
Harry looked at Darcy for a long moment, again searching the eyes, which were as untroubled as before. "You'll be a beautiful memory, though."
You just like to be? Well, whatever; won't win you any friends around here." Harry set the luggage down with a thump and rubbed his hands on his trousers. "Do you need anything else right now, Mr. Malfoy, Draco?"
"Come on Mum…have you seen Malfoy's arse? Either one of 'em? They're pretty damn sweet." This comment came from Charlie, who was taking this time to spangle his newest costume with bronze sequins, to match his eyes. Molly sighed.
"Not really. I lived without it for eleven years, used it for nine, and then put it away again. It's fine, really."
He reached into the bag and came up with three pieces of popcorn, which he let lie in his palm. "The person who let the Graphon out was eating popcorn at the time. They had a box of it after their performance, as is their habit, and they were still eating it when they went to "Keep Perce company." Then they waited for the performance, and when they realized it wasn't Draco out there, they became angry and let the Graphon loose. The Graphon knew its target because part of Draco's torn costume from the sticking event was tossed into his cage."
On the other end Draco was choking, trying to not let his sobs be heard. "I never stopped wanting you, ever, and if you think I did, then maybe…"
Hermione was annoyingly logical for this time of night. Harry had been brooding for several hours now, and was also stone cold sober. The latter seemed to add insult to injury.
Harry took a breath. "They don't call it Super Glue for nothing; they literally could not move. Thus, when stuck, the culprit figured they would be an easy target for the falling light; they'd experimented with falling objects and knew that the light would fall too quickly to be stopped. Had they thought the issue through better, they would have also glued the mat to the floor, but it's our great luck that they didn't think of that option. When I examined the mat later, I found some hard, white particles mixed in with the glue and recognized it immediately as Sweet Cecilia's sticky bun frosting. Whoever did this had recently had one of these buns, and had not washed their hands yet. I was able to scrape a small amount of the mixture off the mat, which I have here." He dangled a small piece of what appeared to be dried rubber in which white particles could clearly be seen in the light.
Draco stared morosely into his drink, his cigarette burning down between his fingers, until Blaise sighed and reached over, taking it from his hand and taking a last drag off it himself before stubbing it out in the ashtray that already had far too many butts in it. "Draco, look, stalking Potter isn't going to help matters."
He woke somewhere between noon and three, depending on how drunk he'd been the night before, and how long he'd stayed up before passing out. It varied, though two AM was a pretty good bet. Not bad for someone who started in with the scotch at noon on the dot each day. He'd tried drinking before noon just once, his rationalization being that it was already noon
In another part of the arena, the Weasleys were powdering their hands and preparing to fly through the air with the greatest of ease. Charlie had prudently covered his "altered" outfit until it was too late for his mother to do anything about it, and as the spotlights swept around the ring, there were cheers and whistles as Charlie smiled and bowed with a flourish, exposing a bit more skin than anyone expected. Ginny had just finished her pre-dinner taco, and wiped her hands on Ron before slapping Charlie's ass. "Niiice."
The Weasleys, being the closest to the actual flames were able to open the release panels and access the emergency ropes to slide out of the tent, the better to pull people out the front and back exits. On the floor, Harry and the twins worked to corral the people into some sort of line to usher them out, but the fire was spreading fast and they had to settle for just shoving people out. Percy and Hagrid had their hands full with the panicked animals, and soon despite all efforts, it was complete pandemonium. In the melee, Harry looked for Draco, but didn't see him; he fervently hoped he'd made it out okay.
The show didn't start till eleven PM, but the venue was already crowded as all hell, and Harry had to take a deep breath and count to ten – four times – before he could steel himself to plunge into the crowd and elbow his way to the front. He found himself wedged in amongst several nubile young things, mostly female, but with a few males scattered throughout, many wearing more eyeliner than the already shrieking girls. At twenty-six, Harry was in no way old, but he still felt ancient in his present company. But he didn't leave. He was determined to see Milo in the flesh.
Harry flailed rather ineffectually – Filch usually got to at least four, the bloody prat, but he still managed to hit the inner circle of the target and break through the paper to the other side where he landed with a thump and an audible "Fuck!"
Ah, the Muggle world. Seriously, how could he have ever looked down on it the way he had? It was fucking brilliant to be a wizard amongst non-wizards, he had to admit, and though he rarely used magic anymore, it was nice to know that he always had the upper hand in most situations. A virtually unnoticeable flick of a concealed wand, a nonverbal spell, and he had total control.
"So do you." Blaise wrapped his arm around Draco's shoulders and walked him back out to the living room; he kissed his cheek briefly. "Good luck."
"You're booked for a 6 week stay, in Room 483; the room is equipped with an honor bar, whirlpool, king bed, river view and a complimentary selection of condoms and lubricants for your sexual pleasure. If you wish to find your own "entertainment," please feel free to do so, but if you are shy or sexually inadequate, the hotel does keep a selection of girls and boys on hand for your convenience."
"It was my pleasure." Draco paused. "Uh, maybe we could have dinner or just drinks if you prefer, sometime this weekend?"
They had talked much of the night - and cried, both of them - and screamed at each other, and when Harry had yelled that he wished he could shove the offending computer system up Draco's arse, Draco had responded by sending the entire system to the floor with a crash and promptly casting Incendio on it. Harry had watched it burn, caught between triumph and disbelief, which was only compounded when Draco tossed his mobile on the flaming pile of metal and plastic and then yelled "Happy now?"
"Got that already," Harry nodded. "I don't know if my winkie could handle six weeks of that kind of abuse though. Plan B?"
"No, it wasn't." He felt suddenly weary. "Whatever else you think was meant to be, it wasn't us." He looked over at Dumbledore. "That's all I have, sir."
The music came on again, making conversation nearly impossible, much to Draco's annoyance. Harry stretched his legs. "Would you like to?” He nodded at the dance floor and gave Draco a smile.
Draco rolled his eyes expressively. "Most people do. God only knows why; he's a snotty bastard, but some people find that charming. There's just no accounting for taste."
Harry stepped into their flat, tossing his keys on the highly polished telephone table; they didn't have a regular phone, but Draco had liked the table. Harry emptied his pockets like he always did and went into the kitchen to get a drink  - he was a total creature of habit these days.
"Bad business, 'Arry." Hagrid's tone was worried. "Looks t'me like it was mebbe started here, an' spread to the Big Top."
Harry's stomach grumbled, an almost threatening sound. Draco laughed. "You better get on with your breakfast then."
The next day was another performance day and that morning, the tent was bustling; the Fossors were checking the larger dimensions against their choreography, the non-dangerous animals were busy sniffing their way around the perimeter, and high above, the younger Weasleys were testing the new ropes and wires. Far above, on the new catwalk, Ron and Ginny were apparently conducting some sort of scientific experiment by dropping various objects from the walk to the ground. Harry looked at them and shook his head. Whatever made one happy. He dodged a cabbage and winced as it splattered, but Bobo was overjoyed and had himself a fine feast. He watched Draco enter the new tent and look around; he hadn't spoken to the other boy since the fire and his cheeks still burned as he remembered Draco shaking him off. He decided to wait for Draco to come to him, if he was going to.
"Minor malfunction," George Weasley called from his spot to the left of Dumbledore. "Nothing to worry about," he added, looking up to where Fred was already climbing the ladder to the uppermost platform to check the other lights.
"Well, Pansy and I came up with a couple of looks that would be amazing on you, so if you want to pick one?”
"Do they always gripe like that? " Draco's voice was a loud whisper and several of the clowns glared at him. He stared them down, until they tossed their rainbow wigs and looked away.
The alcohol had definitely worn off and all Draco really wanted to do at the moment, truth be told, was go home, crawl into their bed and pull out the sweatshirt of Harry's that he'd taken to sleeping with, rest his face on it, and cry until he couldn't any more. Malfoys didn't cry, he'd always been told that. His esteemed father might never have shed a tear over anything, but he'd never loved anyone either. Not like his son
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath, regretting it almost immediately as he coughed. Fuck it – if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. He lit a cigarette and ran a hand through his hair, taking a sip of his drink, until a very distinct tingle caused his head to snap up. A tremor along his spine, a sudden feeling of "Right there.”
The thunderous applause when they finally alighted into the main ring was grating on Draco's ears. Honestly, these people obviously had never seen REAL entertainment, but by God, they would tonight - after the stinky boy was shot out of a cannon apparently. This ought to be good, he thought, and glancing over at his father, Draco saw a smirk tugging on the corners of his lips.
Warm fingers wrapped around Harry's cock and squeezed as his earlobe was bitten and Harry moaned involuntarily until the sound was cut off by a soft kiss before Darcy dropped to his knees, purple silk sliding off his body and puddling on the painted floor. A few quick tugs and Harry's trousers and boxers joined the chemise.
"Honestly, Gin," Harry said rather softly, his voice carrying, nonetheless. "That was careless. Other women in this group might wear high heels, but not on a regular basis. And not when committing arson on a damp night; you could have gotten stuck in the mud, fallen and broken your ankle. Not smart."
“Most likely - either there or getting drunk. Knowing Potter, I expect he’d consider paying his respects to his beloved godfather while arseholed a travesty so it stands to reason he went there first. And I do hate it when you call me “Sev.” Its undignified.”
"Don't you miss it?" Draco was curious about Harry's metamorphosis into something completely unlike what he used to be.
Everyone seemed frozen but Harry, whose lightning reflexes kicked in instinctively as he dove for the edge of the mat and yanked it free, pulling Draco and Lucius out of the way a split second before the heavy light hit, spraying them with glass and filament. Dumbledore reacted a second later, sending the bouncing shards flying harmlessly off into a vacant corner of the tent as Lucius was able to use the leg not touching the mat to kick the metal away.
He sent her back a large box of her favorite long-lasting sugar quills from Honeydukes for her trouble.
"So not money, no. But why not comfort? A home? The smallest wizard tent could house a family of eight in a pinch."
“Well spotted. But as you can see, this particular balcony is occupied.” He gestured around with a glass of something that glinted green moonlight from the shadows.
Harry had smiled at her then, but there was a churning anxiety running through him at the realisation he wasn’t sure he really wanted her home more often. He liked having the house to himself.
The ‘how’ of the spellwork still escaped him, but it was quite cool, and he would’ve readily complimented Draco’s work, only—
Harry could not have denied him—and there was something deliriously indecent about the perfect heat tightening around his cock as he pressed in.
Malfoy let that hang between them in a beat of long incredulous silence before he replied, as always, the bearer of biting sarcasm. "That's a lovely sentiment—"
As he prepares to spend the last few days of August at Malfoy Manor, Harry receives an unexpected visitor, and Draco somehow manages to keep their minds off shagging long enough to get some actual work done.
He didn’t actually have answers to the questions his conscience was posing, but he was developing a growing fear of finding them out.
One of Draco’s hands found his, tangling their fingers tight together. It started a light wavering feeling in his chest that made Harry unusually nervous.
It could not really be who Harry thought he saw; he couldn’t imagine Malfoy ever turning up on a day like today—
“Ah, yes. I’ll just waltz right into the Department of Mysteries, where I don’t work, and proceed to go wherever I please.”
“You’ll need to put some clothes on—I can’t have you distressing all the portraits on our way to the kitchen.”
“You were nearly too late,” Draco purred at him throatily, but did as he asked, and caught Harry in a darkly smouldering gaze he couldn't break.
Harry seemed to find his balance as the couple made their way back through the corridors, far emptier and quieter now than they had been when he passed through them last.
Hadn’t he already said that? As they entered the lift, the flush of intoxication staining Malfoy’s cheeks became harder to miss, and Harry wondered if he looked just as flustered.
"Okay," said Harry, pushing up his glasses on his nose. "This is what we've learned." He handed the paper he'd been scribbling on all day to Draco, and watched as he read.
"His name, yeah." The young girl propped her door open wider and inspected her purple toenails. "He's pretty enough to be a girl, though – prettier than me, dammit. But when you hike up that chemise, the dick kind of gives it all away."
Harry nodded. She tilted her head. "You two would be darling together; do feel free to come back when you acknowledge your feelings for each other."
At the podium, Dumbledore looked over the grumbling crowd and sighed – every year it seemed like there were more personnel issues, more pay issues and more issues in general on the Tour. From a business standpoint, acquiring the rights to the Marvelous Malfoys made perfect sense; they were a proven draw, accomplished professionals and certain money-makers. And if they were uppity snots, well, those were the breaks and the show must go on.
Darcy tilted his head. "I believe I am, Just Harry. I have all I need, more than. I have a roof over my head, I pick and choose my playmates, and someday, if I choose, I'll turn out this light and walk away with the best of the lot. And I will have my memories too."
," he continued. "I was reading my trusty investigative guide, and this all is too coincidental. We need to find who's doing this, and why."
The animal froze and landed with a thump just a foot or two the side of Draco, its mouth gaping open, showing rows of razor-sharp teeth, its horns ripping a large tear in the cloth of the tent.
A meeting was called when the new tent was finished, and again, Dumbledore asked his questions…and again got nowhere. He knew when to cut his losses, but he was deeply troubled. The fire could have been an accident, but he knew it was not. Someone, one of his family, had deliberately burnt the Malfoy's tent and whether planned or not, had nearly killed not only other family members and animals, but innocent members of the public; that someone he knew and loved could do such a thing was hard to accept.
"…there isn't anything left. Right. I'll get my stuff together and move out tomorrow." Harry made his voice flat, cold, pushing it all down.
, Pansy love; it's always about him. No one else has thoughts, feelings, emotions, likes, dislikes – it’s all him."
"Harry, Jesus, what the hell are you talking about?" Groggy though he was, a sick feeling was starting to churn in his stomach; Harry never used that tone of voice on him; sometimes, when they spoke about the past and the parts they'd played, it would show up, but only when speaking of the Enemy.  He never talked to
"Use more of that rouge stuff and quit the complainin,'" muttered Filch, stalking away. Harry had to admit that Filch had a point…quite the accomplishment, for him.
The fifth of whiskey went faster than it should have that night, thank God for room service. And cable porn - all complimentary, of course.
"It's way too long, Malfoy, and it’s driving me mental." Harry sighed. He rather hated it, it was in his face and in his eyes, but it did get him stroked and petted and he did enjoy that – he had to just hope that Draco was off this hair kick soon.
"Mmmhmm. I was at my desk, looking over the park and he was walking along the path, looking deep in thought."
Universal remote in one hand, Scotch and cigarette in the other, a bag of cheese crackers by his side, and Harry was set for the day.
Harry didn't hear from Draco again that night, or the next day. He went to work and did his job mechanically, swatting all inquiries about his health and mental well-being away; he knew his co-workers meant well, but he hadn't talked about the situation so far and had no intention of doing so now. On Friday night he stayed in, for one of the first times since Draco had been away. He bought groceries to restock the nearly-bare cupboards and cooked all the things he liked that Draco didn't. He ate his dinner in front of the telly but turned it off soon after and listened to the silence of a home where only one person lived.
Oh, here it came. Harry wasn't sure what was actually in his personnel file, but assumed it couldn't be anything good. Since joining the Aurors, he hadn't exactly been a role model – the Hero-Savior-Saint thing had gotten pretty old, pretty fast, and Harry had sometimes abused his power a bit, as it were. Nothing Voldemortian, no, but he'd been an asshole. Many times, in fact, and that was part of the reason that he and Ginny were, as she put it, "on a break."
He stood back in the shadows, Hagrid grumbling beside him. "It ain't right, Albus. You know them bears are surly for sure and getting' worse every day. T'day one of 'em took a dump right on poor 'Arry's foot and…"
"Now for the little incident of just half an hour ago," said Harry, who was finding that he was rather enjoying being the center of attention, and not just because some part of him was afire. "The Graphon is kept under lock and key, as he should be, being the most dangerous animal, we own. Hagrid is compulsive about safety, and he would not let the creature out for any reason unless he was in the ring with it, and the taming spell had been cast. The only other person who has a key to its cage is Percy, but he too would never let the Graphon out without Hagrid's supervision. Neither of them was in the area of the cage when the animal attacked Draco. But someone was…someone who left a little evidence near the cage."
"I think a decaffeinated Adams can handle them. Truly Harry, go – go someplace exotic, someplace remote, some place where trouble doesn't come knocking every ten minutes. Someplace you can relax."
Harry snorted. "I should be so lucky. The way my life goes, he'll fall for…I don't know, Percy or someone."
"She hugged me." Percy's voice was surprisingly loud in the silence. "She asked if she could borrow my sweatshirt, and then she hugged me. She must have hooked the key then." He looked at his sister. "Should have known – she never hugs me if she can help it."
Darcy was in a white lace chemise this time, his hair loose, makeup minimal, except for the black liner. "I wondered if you'd come back for it," he said, leaning against his door. "You seemed so intent on capturing something with it, some essence … a memory, maybe. Because of course, that's all I'll be to you."
"Yeah, gorgeous eyes, dark hair, cut short and kind of spiky with color in it so it looked really deep purplish red in some lights - whoever his stylist was knew their stuff. And he had – has – these great hands too, not soft and sissy; they’re hard, they had calluses on them, like he does real work. He was choice."
"No," said Draco hastily, and she sighed, looking between them. "Too bad, too bad; Harry has had such a crush on you for so long."
The groundskeeping shed was nearby, and he was able to retrieve a small gardening trowel, which he used to carefully dig around the footprint, lifting it out and balancing it on his palm. "Nox," he whispered, and carried it back to his room, laying it on a piece of parchment and sliding it under his bed. He washed his hands and face and slid into bed, his mind whirling.
"Millions, not thousands," Draco corrected him, flicking ash onto the pavement. "We have fans across the globe, not just Britain. And as to how I got here?" He shrugged and took a last drag before grinding the butt out under his heel. "Not so differently from you, Potter – the Ministry wanted to punish all of us purebloods, so they attempted to shove us down into little pigeonholes, doing jobs that wouldn't challenge a house-elf. I wasn't having any of that, so I decided to check out Muggle society."
Hagrid mumbled something about breasts being the least of his worries, but Albus ignored him. He saw Filch filling the powder chamber of the cannon and devoutly hoped that Harry was getting over his rash because really, no one hit a bulls-eye like Harry.
Sitting up, a puddle of ivory silk settled around his waist and Harry shrugged. “It’s never worked that way, there’s usually got to be a snake about and I don’t know too many snakes. I’ve not had a reason to try since…everything happened. I had no idea.”
Malfoy scoffed softly. “My invitation here was a formality. In fact, I’m not sure they really expected me to come, or noticed that I have.”
More importantly, he was excited to get into the practical aspects of their solutions—and finding the right place to start with was a very big step in that direction.
Before they did anything else, Draco insisted they brush their teeth again, and they headed back into the tent they’d slept in to get on with it.
There was a note of strong protectiveness in Cassie’s voice then that Harry completely understood. “Many of our regulars have taken up on a small bit of cover near the edge of the riverbank, but we value the privacy of our people here. I’m not sure I’m comfortable telling you where exactly—What are you planning to do about them? They’ve been through a lot, and many of them don’t have terribly good experiences with authority.”
Even though he’d promised not to bother him, Harry fought off a sudden heedless desire to Floo over and surprise Draco for a quick shag—but he was quite tired what with all they’d been up to over weekend, and the flying as well.
"That is not true! I care, I cared! You didn't! You didn't say, “Hey, Harry, you fucking bore me senseless in bed, so I'm gonna call out for sex.”  You let me find out the good old-fashioned manner of everyone who's ever wanted to be caught!"
Tequila? He and Harry had had that only once, at George Weasley's wedding, and Harry had, at Seamus' urging, swallowed the worm and been absolutely loony and delusional for the next three days. It had been alternately hysterical and worrisome as Harry claimed the toast was quoting Shakespeare to him, and that his soap on a rope was really Draco's dead father speaking from the grave.
Draco and his father did deign to eat with the rest of the family that night, as rumor had spread that Molly was cooking. They ate at the table with Dumbledore, Harry, Molly and Arthur, and various and sundry others, and when Lucius exclaimed over Molly's special chocolate lava cake, she giggled and blushed like a schoolgirl. Harry, of course, could barely keep his eyes off Draco, but was aware all evening of the death glare he was getting from Ginny. Honestly, the girl would just not give it up.
Harry nipped at the base of Draco's throat, leaving marks and not caring; he licked at the last one, then raised his head to bite Draco's chin before stepping back, stooping swiftly and pulling down Draco's trousers and pants, stopping to squeeze his balls and give a quick swipe of his tongue up his cock, swirling around the tip and sucking, pulling off with an audible pop and smirk as he stood back up, shoved his own trousers down and slid his arm under Draco's arse, effectively lifting him up and holding him against the wall. Harry reached backward and fumbled for the soap dispenser, filling his hand with liquid and rubbing it hastily between his fingers before sliding his hand under Draco and inserting one, then two slippery fingers into him, scissoring him, stretching him.
Harry looked down. "Ah, no. I just like to take photos, is all." He looked back up and met Darcy's gaze. "Would you allow me to take some photos of you – just for my own personal collection?"
Draco wrinkled his nose at the smell emanating from the other boy; it wasn't rose cologne that was for sure. "What do you do there? Clean up bear shit?"
"Oh, it's okay - sometimes I do clean up shit, but hey, someone has to. Mostly I get shot out of a cannon." Harry nodded, then picked up the six bags with some awkwardness, and started walking towards the camp. Draco rolled his eyes and Lucius scowled at him as they followed him.
Hermione sounded rather chipper, thought Harry, which seemed unfair. She also looked rested and competent, while he no doubt looked like a crazed insomniac with maybe a wee drinking problem. He surreptitiously slid the bottle of rum behind his pillow.
He looked up at Ginny. "And you, Ginevra, will have to face the consequences of your actions -  in the morning. You will spend the night, under house watch, with Minerva in her quarters."
"You want boobs, go for one of those cows down the street, like the ones you were talking to when I came back out. They're just overrated gobs of flesh. I can offer you so much more, Just Harry." Darcy smiled seductively, then stood up, pushing down the strap of his chemise.
Goddamn it - how the hell had he forgotten this? And this year made ten years - ten years since Sirius Black had been forced through the Veil by a curse thrown by his cousin, the aforementioned psycho Bellatrix. Ten years since the man Harry had come to know and love as his godfather was taken from him, by Him. At least by default.
"Apparating with this amount of luggage, even with wizards as skilled as I, is practically begging for a splinching," said a pompous-sounding voice below, followed by a sigh. "Now do stop complaining and grab my luggage, there's a good son."
Draco sighed. "I guess," he said slowly. "You survive being shot out of a cannon by a moron four times a week after all. What the hell is up with his inability to count?"
After the war, after the furor had died down and things started to be rebuilt, he had hunted down the Dursleys.
Harry held the door open for him and they went into the pub, securing a corner booth. The interior was busy but not noisy, and the lights were low, the globes hanging over the tables dimmed for intimacy. They sat across from each other and ordered the house ale, sipping almost in tandem before setting them down and smiling at each other. "Thanks for meeting me here," said Draco quietly. "It's nice to not have to scream to be heard."
"Great." Draco sighed, but didn't dispute the theory; he was used to people finding his disposition unpleasant, and cared not the slightest bit. "So, what does the famous Mr. O'Sullivan say about investigating?"
Harry stared back at him, and for the first time in over a month, there was a spark and snap in those eyes. "Ever think that something,
Air cheek kissing followed and Draco winced inwardly. Snotty as hell though he might be (in Harry's words anyway) he hated places like this. He was aware that he was being sized up, and then a surprisingly strong hand gripped his. "Hullo, Draco! Pansy says we need to transform you." He looked him over. "Although I'm not entirely sure why - she was a bit vague on that point."
“Well, I wasn’t there of course, but let’s see…you discussed Quidditch all morning in the “office” with Weasley, went to a booze-soaked lunch on an expense account with some eager sponsor, then spent the afternoon touring the Specialty Broom Shop under the pretense of finding the best new series for the team next year, then had tea with Wood, listened to him blather on about his fabulous new contract with Puddlemere United, then came home utterly exhausted.”
They were a light, pale gray, and there was no darkness there; despite his life and circumstances, they weren't angry or full of pain. They were calm, accepting.
Draco glared at her, and Blaise hid a smirk in his whiskey. Draco shot him a dirty look, before saying authoritatively. "My Harry would never do that; he'd be fucking terrified."
Draco yanked his arm away. "For all they know, it is. And just what the hell are you doing here or anywhere? You've dropped off the face of the earth, from what I hear - couldn't hack Auror training, Weaslette dumped your ass 'cause you went from hero to zero, and you fall into a hole and never are seen again. Yet here you are." He looked Harry over. "And frankly, you've looked a whole hell of a lot better."
Harry looked up briefly, then went back to his mail. "No, we don't. I understand, Draco. We've been together a couple of years, it's gotten routine, I get it. You want variety, and so you've been looking elsewhere. It’s fine."
"So I hear." Draco folded his arms. "Father is entertaining one Charlie Weasley at this moment, and he happened to mention that you have a slight fascination with me."
"Chose to lie." Harry paused, fighting down the tears. "You lied to me instead. You let me think you understood, that you could empathize, that you knew how I felt!"
The cat stared at Harry, and Harry stared back. Darcy laughed. "You won't win a staring contest with him, Just Harry. Onyx is a past master at staring people down. He fancies himself quite a protector, too, so if you prefer your face unscathed, be nice to me."
"Aaron, I'm sure it is." Harry sighed. "I'm sure he's wrecked over it, but to show you that, well, it would give you power, wrong as that sounds. If he lets you see what you've done, that gives you power. You've made him feel terrible; he's cried, he's ranted and probably thrown things, but I know, for myself? For the first month, I was feeling like "I'll be fucked if I let Draco know what he's done to me, how he's made me feel like shit, worse than shit. I mean, you know what I even did one night?"
Deep into his thoughts, he barely registered the ministrations of the stylist or the resulting conversation. He heard voices, that was all, swirling and eddying around him. He felt gentle pulls and tugs, and heard the snip of scissors, but even the feel of something wet and smelly being applied to his hair didn't rouse him. What did, finally, was a story Paul was telling Pansy about going out a few nights ago.
She stood up, though it was clear that no one had any intention of letting her go anywhere. "I did it for you, Harry! For us! Everything was fine until HE came along!"
When the last quivering falsetto had echoed through the venue, the steel beams in the walls thrumming, Harry crushed his plastic cup and sat up.
"Probably because all the times you told him how much you loved him before, you were fucking professional sluts on the side." Blaise had decided it was time for tough love, not to mention that a feisty, even nasty Draco was preferable to the mopey, self-flagellating Draco of late.
"You could say that." Harry turned slightly and gave him a long, appraising look. "I haven't seen you here before."
"You'd be surprised. And maybe I won't have to. If my suspicions are correct, the person who is responsible will try something, thinking I'm you and expose themselves. Not literally," he added, shuddering. "But that way, you'll be out of serious danger."
"Good, we have something in common then; I also don't mean anything to you." Harry wrenched his shoulder away and went over to the closet, grabbing his jacket, ripping it off the hanger with a sharp twist.
He tried to walk backward so he could talk to Draco more, but he found that he fell a lot that way, so had to walk facing forward. He still kept up a steady stream of chatter the whole way back and only stopped when he deposited the Malfoys at Dumbledore's office and then struggled his way to the guest tent with the luggage.
She furrowed a brow. "Of course, and so should you, considering you testified at a bunch of them. Why?"
A new face was always welcome in the district, it seemed, and Harry was fascinated by the variety of the girls offering themselves for sale. Some of them obviously specialized, as evidenced by their displays of props, and Harry saw a few items that looked downright dangerous, but he supposed the most successful whores were multi talented, as it were. The Morningstar and leather vambraces in one window disturbed him a bit, though he did like the thigh-high studded boots. He tried, albeit briefly, to imagine Ginny in them, and startled both himself and the girl's prospective clientele with the slightly hysterical peal of laughter that escaped him.
Harry scowled. "You know, just cause you're gorgeous doesn't mean you have to be a complete and utter ass."
"I am, yes," Draco started, then found himself wondering how to explain exactly what he was. Somehow, he was sure that "I'm a fucking asshole," while accurate, was not exactly the answer Harry was looking for. "I'd been living with someone for about a year, and we'd been together for a year before we moved into our flat."
"Well, what did Potter do to look so different?" Pansy raised an eyebrow, and then took out her mobile, punching a number in from memory. "Hello, Paul? Pansy! I know, darlingest, it's been what, a week?"
"I don't think I've ever seen you voluntarily read anything that wasn't a school book or Quidditch-related, no. What's it about?"
"Like the thing to do at the time, sure. I understand Draco, told you I did. You wanted more and wanted it right then. And fuck, you can ring up for this - brilliant marketing, genius, really." Harry smiled and went to pull his hair out of the collar out of habit, looking momentarily confused. "Oh, right, don't need to do that anymore. Phantom hair syndrome, it seems.”
Last night, in that one, brief moment, he had known the secret Draco carried, just as Draco had known his. And if that moment hadn't been enough, he'd found Draco; found him as though he had known all along where the other man would be. Harry no longer used magic, but he could still sense it, still follow it, and knew that magic was comprised of many things, most of them unexplainable.
“I ought to leave you here,” Draco drawled, gently pulling himself off Harry’s cock with a quietly hitched breath.
He and Ginny spent the majority of the time between Christmas and New Years at the Burrow, and his only saving grace was the sheer chaos of a house full of Weasleys. A guilty conscience just served to make the holidays even more stressful than usual. Anxiety over his questionable choices and the added burden of more frequent field sessions with Savage had combined to make the next few weeks fly by in a blur of exhaustion and stress.
Draco didn’t say Harry could come for another half-hour, gasping for it as he throbbed in the tight pull of Harry’s strokes, arching into his climax.
“Yes well. I’ve never had any siblings, but I imagine she must’ve missed her sister. They talked a lot about when they were younger, and very little about their husbands or politics. Father always called Andromeda the Traitress—and still does actually—so you can only imagine how mystified I was to be having tea with her.”
Harry could feel how hard he came in the agonising clench all around his cock. He wished he could see Draco’s face caught up in it, but excruciating tightness and the indecent sound of Draco’s quivering moans were too much together, and Harry’s cock spurted inside him hot, hard, and profusely. For what felt like a dangerously long time his cock twitched with raw pleasure in Draco’s arse and Draco rode him, stuttered and lingering as they both gasped for breath, drawing out an immeasurable pleasure high.
Harry found himself at four in the morning in his kitchen mixing cinnamon into a mug of hot chocolate.
As they picked up a smoother rhythm, Harry braced him, gripping at pale hips with rough fingers, helping to pull Draco more firmly down onto swelling hardness. Harry may have started moaning first, but soon they were both caught up in a heated kiss, half-muffled dual moans echoing off the library’s high-ceiling.
Draco fell asleep even before him, and the constancy of his slowed breathing was incredibly relaxing. When Harry finally did doze off, his dreams were peaceful ones.
“That is good news,” Harry agreed, sucking lightly at the spot he’d just been biting, feeling the quiet moan Draco tried to stifle.
“I’ll be fine!” he answered reflexively, and immediately wished for a hole to crawl into, to hide from how badly he was bungling this. He thought he heard Ginny sigh, but it might well have been the wind—even if he knew it probably wasn’t, he wanted to believe it.
Malfoy unquestioningly swallowed all of him, with a low hum that had him twitching on his tongue as he spent himself fully. His knees had gone full wobbly now, and Malfoy's mouth pulled off his cock almost reluctantly.
“—I’m taking every precaution. He’s helping me with some spellwork, the research and a few other things.”
Even as he sunk in he tried to work his jeans further down before he picked up thrusting properly hard and—as Draco requested—quick.
Malfoy scowled out at the grounds while Harry waited for an answer, and once again found himself admiring the extraordinary reflectivity of platinum hair.
Harry broke off with a quiet hitch, hit with a rush of intense prickling warmth. The sensation was not entirely unpleasant, but it began building up a steady tension through his nerves—a searing itch in need of scratching.
As they made their way back out into the atrium, Harry nodded to the door across the iron walkway curiously.
“Fine. Whatever,” he drawled. “Not as if you didn’t return the favor this morning with a proper fucking.”
Ron thanked Harry for going flying with him, and Harry thanked him in return for inviting him along. Then Ron said goodnight to his dad and swirled off into the Floo back to his and Hermione’s flat, clutching several covered plates of food.
Draco caught him by the hem of his jeans, dragging him closer with a smoothness that set Harry’s nerves to jumping.
“He’s done nothing but help,” Harry said immediately, realising then how true it was. “I have no reason not to trust him with this.”
The request caused a strange flutter in Harry’s stomach that the alcohol in his system did nothing to help. He was nervous, he supposed, of the notion that going anywhere with Malfoy in this state could lead to anything but trouble.
The ballroom’s floor was white marble, inlaid with an intricate mosaic of mother-of-pearl stars. It was all distressingly familiar for a room Harry was sure he’d never been in before.
The last couple days of Harry’s week were quite dull and uneventful—excepting the single Field Training mission he’d gone on that wasn’t about chasing off Dementors.
“You might have a bit of trouble finding us at first, but theoretically so long as you know what you’re looking for the enchantments should allow you to see through the illusions. This will be a bit of a test actually, if it all works as intended even for…non-magical people, then I’ll have done my job properly.”
Harry’s timing probably could have been better, but—what with Draco slouched back like he was on the settee, his shirt pulled tighter over his abs and his legs leisurely parted… he was very distracting even when he wasn’t trying to be.
“That’s fair,” Harry agreed. “I could speak with her, plan something in a couple weeks? It’s going to be busy here for a bit—”
Harry should’ve been down in the library already, Flooing home, or already there. But he was still standing in Draco’s bedroom doorway.
Sneaking back into the Time Room together, they hadn’t made it two steps into the room before Harry noticed a light lit in one of the offices. His heart might’ve stopped briefly, and he felt Malfoy’s grip tighten at his elbow, but he merely tried to remain calm and move along the far wall, as far from the offices as he could get them, until they passed far enough that they could make straight for the room of many doors.
“It would take more time, but obviously we’re having to develop highly specialised spells either way. I’ll already be adapting most of them from their original purposes—in this case, the theory is out there to study. To master it will take time…but I don’t think ‘impossible’ or even ‘hopeless’ are the right words.”
“Eyes open, Potter.” His words ghosted over ever more sensitive skin, so close and not close enough. “I know you like to watch.”
Draco’s books were on the sitting room table again, piled up beside his Muggle tablet full of Harry’s scribbled notes—and a few of Draco’s now too. Harry had taken to keeping all of it in his trunk in the attic, with everything else related to Draco and their plans, but he’d brought them down for today.
He sucked at Draco’s tip for a long time, tonguing at it too, and only let up when Draco started trying to push deeper.
As it turned out, he needn’t have bothered with clothes at all. Draco hadn’t. He was lying naked on the library settee, flat on his front, his hair looking still a bit damp at the ends. He was reading a book.
Harry’s panting grew heavy and tight with the effort of his control, the heat built between them flushing him all over, but he didn’t stop.
Malfoy froze in the midst of tucking away his wand to stare at Harry, a flash of real uncertainty on normally guarded features.
Harry had his doubts about ‘grey’ magic. That said, he couldn’t very well rule out their best option on account of a bad reputation. He frowned thoughtfully. “Go on.”
Something compressed tight and strange in Harry’s chest, uncertainty in his quick inhale—and he thrust up once, hard, drawing out Draco’s sharp moan and effectively distracting them both.
Smirking, Draco mirrored the sip, and Harry had a hard time looking away from him. He was a bit grateful for the interruption when a pair of posh salads arrived.
, its façade all grey stone and high arched windows. There was a short queue following a purple carpet runner out the front door, and a few small clusters of people waited beneath the awning as well.
There was also the fact that after all his bluster over not being caught dead lurking in Muggle backstreets, he’d been willing to get on his knees in one of those backstreets, for Harry. The thought was a little more than Harry could process right then, without being entirely overwhelmed by the desire to bugger lunch and take him to whichever bed they could get to the quickest.
Before Harry could formulate a single word in reply, Draco lifted his hips, and took Harry’s cock into himself all over again.
Draco had a lot of opinions, and Harry took them into consideration, but he had a few opinions of his own. They certainly didn’t agree on everything, not by a long shot—but they managed to reach some sort of compromise most of the time.
you’d spouted off that we’ve been fucking in front of Blaise, called me a whore, and presumed to tell me who I’m allowed to fuck when you’ve got no room to talk, and no fucking right.”
“Well, you know it was sort of right, in the end… house unity.” Harry gestured between them with an amused half-grin.
Draco bucked back on his finger as he came hard all over Harry’s sheets. Rather than pull out, Harry whispered a light lubrication charm and slid his index finger in to press with the middle into the same perfect place.
Given it was a birthday present and all, Harry thought the least he could do was make it last a bit.
His cock sprung up all too quickly when pale thighs spanned over it, the eager tip of Draco’s nudging at firming stiffness. They teased each other that way, brushing and bumping lips and cocks, a challenge in the sultry anticipation as neither of them committed to any real pressure.
Harry fucked him at the same hard, slow rhythm, until Draco moaned Harry’s name warningly, and gasped his next “
When their lips pulled apart Harry was breathless, his lips throbbed sorely what with all their hard kissing earlier, his eyes gone darkly hazy with lust.
Draco was riding him backward, the long line of his back arched and sheened with sweat in the late May warmth. Harry couldn’t touch him at all, or anything else, he could only arch up with sweltering need as Draco’s hips worked an irresistibly iniquitous sort of magic on his cock.
A number of others waved and nodded at him, and Harry waved and nodded back. He was seeing a few more smiles than tears this year, and he supposed that was a good thing.
Harry knew perfectly well, as an Auror if nothing else, he should’ve put a stop to this immediately.
, enough Harry felt emboldened to rock himself right in between Malfoy’s spreading legs. Now when he spoke, his lips left a damp impression against the base of Malfoy’s throat, tugging his shirt open just a little—
“Not bad,” Draco drawled, leant back against his desk watching Harry go through the movements one more time. “You might actually be able to cast soon—with a bit more practice.”
Finding a comfortable chaise on which to rest in one of Draco’s tents, he convalesced another hour before Draco was finished with the inspections, and they went back to casting Extension Charms.
Huffing, Harry signed the end of his letter to Luna, rolled it up, and charmed it tied before handing it off to Gordon. Coaxing him to his arm, he exited the tent, carrying the owl to the flung open doors of the ballroom.
Harry was still licking his lips and trying to refocus his vision when Draco Disapparated in front of him. It was a little dizzying, and he’d let out a powerfully exasperated huff just before he followed, joining him once again at the gates to Malfoy Manor.
For the space of a heartbeat, Draco met Harry’s eye, and gave up on what had started out a warning tone, huffing a short sigh of surrender instead.
Draco caught at the ladder’s iron rail for balance, hooking one leg over Harry’s hip to give him wider access to thrust into. He moaned into Harry’s mouth, who groaned back, driving his cock in deeper.
“Don’t have to do much, do I?” Malfoy’s taunting drawl was punctuated by the rougher pulling open of a couple more trouser-buttons, making the eager outline of Harry’s interest all the more obvious, once there was room to grow.
A massive stone hearth was inset into the wall at one end and when Draco flicked his wand, it flared to life. There were a few old-ish looking chairs around several long wooden prep tables and Harry sat down in one, but Draco decided to sit on the table instead.
Harry watched him swirl off through the fire with his own small frown. All sorts of emotions were roiling in him—worry and nerves, guilt and desire, a healthy dash of denial, and a true exhilaration that they were closer than ever to tangible progress.
“Er, by the way,” Harry cut him off before he could get any further ahead of them. “After the meeting tomorrow, would you maybe want to get something to eat in London?”
She accepted a small treat from him, but didn’t wait around for his reply, swooping back out of the bedroom and off into the morning sky.
“I think so, yes. This is our chance to sort out what’s not working and fix it before we go any farther—and we’ll need to get our interiors as close to similar as we can.”
Harry tried to help, but his hands kept wandering, and he was caught up in the bruising heat of Draco’s lips on his.
“My father got up to all sorts of naughtiness in school before he married my mother, in order to carry on the family name.”
When they first arrived, he had surveyed the high-ceilinged ballroom in which the reception was being held with mild interest. He had eyed the hors d’oeuvre table with a great deal more interest, but on closer inspection most of the expensive-looking food on display did not appear to be very appetising.
They watched the crowds disperse, many people already making for Hogsmeade—all of them trying to beat the rush, and creating the rush in the process. Ginny looked as if she might say something to him, patting Harry’s shoulder gently, but then they were interrupted.
It was getting quite late, already quarter-past eleven, and Harry realised it would be a lot of work getting all the lamps and draperies installed where they were meant to be. When he pointed this out, Draco admitted he’d already been considering it, and decided they would shrink it all down with the tents in the morning, and do the installations onsite tomorrow, as they would need to do final inspections on all the illusions anyway.
Fumbling with his fly one-handed, Harry pushed him brusquely forward against the mirror, until his cock pressed tight to the glass.
“Well it’s obviously not enough,” Harry pointed out with a frown. “Where are they coming from? How—”
When he woke Saturday morning, after only an hour more, it was only five. Harry still felt very tired, but he gave up trying to force it. He picked up Draco’s book on spell modifications, and settled in to re-read chapter twenty-seven for the dozenth time.
His words were lost in a low moan as Harry attempted for the first time to take Draco’s cock deeper down his throat.
The quiet noises that fell from Draco’s lips then were more pained, but he kept up his unrelenting friction, until Harry’s cock twitched and spilled between them one more time. He was too wrapped up in coming to notice Draco watching him with a half-lidded sort of possessiveness.
It wasn’t until Draco waved him to the center of the carpet, and began walking him through the more complex wand-movements that the first spell would require, that all Harry’s nerves and uncertainty transmuted into something much more simmering.
“Do you honestly believe either of us would be here right now if you hadn’t lied for us when you did?”
“Right, sorry,” he said sheepishly as he gently eased his cock out of the man beneath him. He whispered a cleaning spell for them and heard Draco’s quiet sigh as he sat back to pull his jeans up. “Thanks, for making the time.”
As out of place as he felt standing there amidst the opulent splendour of the dining room, conversely Draco seemed completely at ease and entirely in his element, even despite its being a Muggle establishment. He got them a small table by one of the big windows, where Harry could look out on the cars, umbrellas, people and pavement all growing steadily saturated, while the rain splattered the window’s glass panes with a multitude of droplets, each refracting the traffic lights from the street.
He was grateful that Draco didn’t press in with his tongue the way Harry always did, but when he kissed again, with the lightest brush of a hot wet tongue, it felt so viciously brilliant that Harry nearly asked him to keep going—but then Draco was standing upright to flick the firm slick tip of his cock between Harry’s cheeks, his moans ever more resonant in the reflective room.
In that moment he was almost painfully cognisant of exactly what the right and moral choice would have been. And yet—
"Potter,” he paused, speaking slowly, somewhat as though he were speaking to a small child. “There is a natural order to things. Some people are poor, some are exceedingly rich, that is just the way the biscuit breaks."
“It’s a matter of principle. Your hair is defiant,” Draco drawled casually, but his ears were looking a little flushed.
It called to him in his somewhat soused state, and Harry answered, stepping out toward the stone railing with a deep, calming sigh.
Harry watched him take a short sip of his drink, stubbornly staring out at the ever-chattering mass of Ministry members in their formal attire, some of the most powerful witches and wizards in Britain together in one room. In many respects, the antithesis of the world occupying their current conversation.
Harry suppressed an eyeroll and started looking over the menu, though he wasn’t really reading it past registering it wasn’t written in English. Yet another question was bubbling up that he couldn’t keep from voicing.
It took just over an hour to implement, splitting the lamps into small batches between them. Thankfully the glow charms required very little magic and took almost no time to cast, which helped in speeding the process along somewhat.
Excepting of course for that bit of time last week… which had been nice enough Harry was actually considering the irrational impulse to ask for a repeat.
Curiously, Harry pulled off Draco’s cock long enough to whisper a wandless lubrication spell, and press his fingers into Draco with slow exploration.
“Later,” Draco insisted with low promise. “Save your energy, you’ll need all of it for the casting.”
The Dementors always managed to surface his mother’s dying screams. Harry had taught himself to hold them off some, if he could concentrate enough to put up a few Occlumency walls then he could work around it just fine, though he could always hear her, and it was always just a little bit heart-breaking.
Harry sucked a nipped kiss to the curve of his neck, and went on nipping steadily harder, until he’d coaxed out Draco’s quiet moan.
He was still achingly hard, but too busy watching Draco panting through the afterburn of a powerful orgasm to do anything about it—
“…We didn’t quite make the attic,” Draco pointed out in amusement, a flush still high on his cheeks.
Harry groaned. He wasn’t sure his stamina would hold out but he would certainly give it his best effort. This had been all he could think about for an hour or more—maybe even all month, if he was being entirely honest with himself—and he was actually going to get what he wanted for his birthday. His cock was certainly excited by the prospect.
Harry leant a bit sideways, only enough to dig into his robes on the chair, searching for his wand one-handed. He cast a quick cleaning charm on them, enough to take care of the worst of the mess, although—
Harry drew in a deep breath, steeling himself for the harsh reality of it all. It was a secret now, and one he would have to keep for everyone’s sake, but also for his own. The consequences—
,” Draco expelled, riding him faster, working off a residual pleasure-shock before his hips worked down on Harry’s cock, pressing and holding him deeper again. Harry could feel the tremors of pleasure inside when Draco found the right spot.
In that time Harry considered that perhaps their awkwardness had something to do with the fact they never really kissed when they weren’t shagging, or about to shag.
It honestly hadn’t occurred to him that Malfoy might actually keep his word and attempt to assist him with his intoxicated (and probably unwise) notions of making the world a better place. Malfoy taking to heart
“I made soup earlier,” he drawled casually, waving to a small cauldron over the fire which was now slowly heating up. “If that’s alright.”
A furrow of familiar irritation overtook Ron’s ginger brow. “She’s just fine. Busy. Are we flying or not?”
He found himself morbidly pondering what the ball might have been like the year Umbridge had been in charge of its planning. Perhaps the champagne fountain had run with the blood of all the children she had made to write lines, wrung from so many pages of wasted parchment—
Ron and Hermione had taken he and Ginny out to celebrate, and just happened to have told most of their family and friends where they would be going. It had been loud and chaotic, but Harry hadn’t minded it too much—though he never really enjoyed being the center of attention.
When the woman he assumed to be Cassie looked up, she appeared to completely lose the path of her question. She had curly blond hair and big eyes, and she was staring at him with a sort of shock that Harry was well familiar with—though it hadn’t happened in the middle of Muggle London since he was a small boy.
Clambering onto the cushioned lounge with a distinct lack of his already lacking grace, Harry waved his partial tumbler of firewhisky in Malfoy’s direction, and promptly drained it all in one swallow.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a look—Ron’s a bit pained. Harry recalled hearing his stomach grumbling throughout a few of the quieter moments. He’d nearly laughed aloud at it once, which would have been quite awkward given the circumstances.
“The water enchantments and a lot of the protective charms will need refreshing regularly as well, so we’ll have to sort it out either way.”
Thank you all so much for reading, and for the kudos and commenting! I'm excited for where things are going. I've got a good 40k more written and I'm almost certain it'll go even longer than that, so there is more to come!
“Are you walking down to The Hog’s Head with us, Harry? The D.A. really would like to see you,” Hermione pressed as she and Ron joined them.
—” Harry didn’t get to his ‘and’ before said cock shot hot come and he was hurrying to catch it all in his mouth.
Still panting, he nudged his nose against Draco’s cheek, and Draco turned to kiss him…even if it was quick and a bit sideways. Harry huffed a dazed sort of laugh, at least he hadn’t brushed his teeth for no reason.
Malfoy snickered at him, and Harry ignored the curious twinge of something it stirred in him, forcing it down to focus on the warnings his better judgement was screaming at him to make. He might’ve been a git but Harry didn’t want to see him get hurt.
“Anyway, all the more reason. Isn’t that enough? We’re hardly responsible for saving them from their own problems as well, surely.”
After checking it over thoroughly, Malfoy decided to try a second time. The results, if there were any, were quite negligible.
There were other classes he completely dreaded, like Poisons and Antidotes, because he was abysmal at them. He had reached a point mid-June where he very nearly owled Draco for advice on one of his papers, but Harry sorted it out on his own in the end.
When they peeked into the tent to check on his success or failure, it became clear that perhaps the charm was not as tricky for him to pick up as they had originally thought.
Harry shoved him back hard onto the bed and Draco caught at the front of his now-open shirt and dragged him down just as roughly.
Harry was pretty sure Draco could ask him to do anything in that tone and he would do whatever it was, however Draco wanted him to do it.
The morning they were to meet with Cassie, Draco wore the same sort of well-tailored suit as before, different than the last, as this one was shades of grey instead of black, with a waistcoat and a proper tie this time.
As soon as the base of his cock was flush to Draco’s arse he stopped, coiling his fingers tight around the base of Draco’s to squeeze a slow up stroke as he whispered a quiet lubrication charm. He braced himself to attach his mouth to the long curve of a pale throat, marking with his teeth wherever his lips landed. He was in a much better position now for slowly fucking Draco into his ridiculously comfy mattress, and he did exactly that.
Nimble fingers drifted from the small of Harry’s back, pressing his bottoms down over his arse to grip demandingly and pull Harry closer between his parting legs.
“Right—at least I think that’s where they are. Her last owl didn’t say where exactly, only that they’ve got them sleeping in some old dorm with bunkbeds, and they’ve had to get up at four every morning and run about with rocks or something.”
"That does sound rather nice – if you're sure you can handle things around here without me." He watched his boss' face turn a lovely shade of eggplant - really, a fascinating color -  then got up and shook his hand warmly. "I'll send you a postcard from wherever I wind up, yes?"
Harry shrugged, glad Draco seemed to be accepting his plan. "He can count; he just shoots off too fast."
The first tendril of fire licked gently at the base of the main tent, and then traveled upward at an ever-increasing speed, till it reached the anchor ropes and became a single stream of flame, racing to the peak and exploding.
What was worse in a way, was that Harry and he still shared the king-sized bed they'd bought their first week of living together - after they broke the double and queen-sized ones they'd conjured. Whether it was the construction or the fact that the sex had somehow slowed down, this bed stayed firm. Harry would come in and slide into his side of the bed – still naked, as he had always slept – and turn on his side away from Draco. Draco would pretend to be asleep, most of the time, but he would open his eyes and let them travel over Harry, from the top of his head, down to his smooth, bare neck - a sight Draco hadn't seen in months, granted and would refuse to admit that he'd missed. His eyes would travel to the curve of his shoulders, down the ridge of spine bisecting his muscled back, over the ink spanning both shoulder blades. Sometimes Harry would throw his leg outside the sheets and Draco, up on one elbow, would trace with his eyes the curve of calf and the line of his thigh.
Anyone else might have been momentarily taken aback, but Draco knew full well he was gorgeous, and used it to his advantage whenever possible. "I don't have to, no."
"Yes. It's sort of the stock in trade of geniuses, I guess." Harry scratched his neck. Christ, there was still frosting here and there, and he's washed as thoroughly as he possibly could. That stuff really was spackletastic.
"All valid points." Draco took a sip of his vodka before racking up the billiard balls to give himself something to do. "Are you looking forward to, or dreading, this talk with Draco?" It felt very odd to say his own name, like it had nothing to do with him.
"Great! Could you book me a nice room and arrange for a portkey?" He dug in his pocket and found a wrinkled, but unused, check. He wrote out a sum for payment, and handed it over to the woman, watching the customary "Good Lord, you're Harry Potter!" expression cross her face. To her credit, she didn't make a big deal out of it.
Harry had leaned against the table, shoving a hand through his hair, which had grown out a bit over the past weeks; Draco had been oddly pleased to see that when they were together, Harry was much more casual, much more like the Harry he'd fallen in love with years and years ago. While Club!Harry was hot, no mistake, he was also removed and unavailable. This Harry was warm and present and funny and kind - and sexy as hell.
He was hanging around the tent flap trying to look casual – and failing utterly – when the Marvelous Malfoys emerged, Lucius looking calm and Draco resentful. Harry immediately latched on to Draco, which did nothing for the other boy's mood. "Have you eaten? Do you need to? Do you want me to show you around? “
Safe in the cab, he finally shivered a bit, and remembered that Milo – Draco - had his jacket, but didn't care. It seemed a small price to pay for escape.
He looked at his nails, admiring the pearly white polish, then back at Harry. "Kinky shit is extra, and I am never – and I do repeat, never – the sub. I'll talk dirty for free, again, if I like you. You seem like a nice enough bloke, and rather cute, so I'm inclined to be kind. I tell you when we're done, and when I say go, you go, all nice and well-behaved. Understand?"
Everyone was now staring openmouthed at Ginny, sweet little Ginny Weasley; she squirmed inside her gray sweatshirt with "The Winged Weasleys" on it.
She shrugged. "This seems to work better, for some odd reason. Wonderful stuff. I had another tube, but I cannot seem to locate it. Pity. I shall have to make a trip to town one day to get more. I do love Muggle towns. Have either one of you ever eaten at Burger King? Their double Whoppers are simply to die for."
Before he could get drunk and maudlin, Blaise pulled him up and took him into his dressing room, to the far rack. "All right now, we need to get you looking like club material. Hmmm." Blaise surveyed him. "I'm thinking leather, but not too much leather; leather and classical at the same time. Nothing too over the top." He rummaged through the rack and pulled out a pair of supple cordovan suede pants and a gray silk shirt.
He actually found himself biting his lip as he thought about it. Pansy interjected with "Yes, but Draco, he grew it for you. HE couldn't stand it, but you loved it, so he put up with it. When you wronged him, it’s not surprising that it was one of the first things to go. I'm sure he was relieved to have it gone, plus, I bet he looks hot."
Eventually, Draco had to get up and stretch, going over to the couch and nudging Harry's legs aside, sliding in under them. "Hi."
Draco looked down at the book. "Surly O'Sullivan's Guide to Nailing the Perp?" he read, and snickered. "Sounds like porn."
"What a dump," Draco said succinctly, and Harry bristled a bit, then sighed. "I'm sure it's not what you're used to, Draco, but you are a wizard and I'm sure you will find a way to make this suit you."
"No one likes you. That makes everyone a suspect, except me. And Dumbledore, and probably Hagrid, and Molly and Arthur, cause they're sweet. But everyone else pretty much thinks you're a snot."
Harry looked down at the kernels. "These look like any normal kernels, don't they? But on two of the kernels, there is a smear of pink lip gloss. Diamond Dragon, I believe it's called, isn't it Ginny?"
She settled for kissing them both, telling Draco once again that he looked amazing, and giving Blaise the look that clearly said "You will tell me everything!" before flouncing away and Disapparating.
"Ginevra Weasley!" scolded Molly who was never far from her erm, adventurous daughter. "The last thing you should be doing is fantasizing about some young man's posterior. It's very unseemly."
Draco paid the entrance fee and moved into the packed club. This was the third one he'd tried tonight, and his patience was wearing thin. He'd been hit on, had drinks spilled on him, and come perilously close to being burned more than once by the odd careless cigarette. He now remembered why he only enjoyed these places now if he had Harry with him - being pawed got tiresome fast.
"I think so. I think you can be. I think you are." He didn't add that he needed him to be happy – he could never, would never, explain.
"I didn’t want to be caught!" That was not what he meant to say, at all. He tried to fix it. "I wanted to talk to you about it, all of it, but you wouldn't even give me the time of day! You went out, changed everything about you to spite me, and now won't even talk to me about it!”
Then another beer and another dance, and another and another until he decided that leaving the dance floor at all was stupid and just let himself move to the beat.
He tried to scramble away, but his seat was located in the middle of a row, and the bleachers were packed. He lurched backward into an old witch's lap, causing her to first coo in delight, then scream when she saw what was coming.
He cried again, more tears flowing than he ever thought he had in him. He hadn't cried like this when Lucius died, or even when Snape had died; he just didn't think he had it in him. Obviously, he was wrong.
Lucius spoke through tight lips. "Draco, do hush up. This is the hand we are currently dealt, so for the love of Merlin, do man up and stop this accursed whingeing!"
"Maybe you could pencil me in for 11," replied Harry, stretching. "You know, in your super-planner. And I'll be up in a bit; I want to check email one last time."
lines. After an involuntary grunt, a large lump of mottled cat would land squarely on his bladder, making him groan. He would pet the cat, a stray who had taken a shine to him one day as Harry made his way home from the liquor store, and who, like him, was content to live on scotch and Cheez-Its – this being the best of all possible food-like combinations in Harry's expert opinion.
Harry watched him from underneath his fringe, which devoid of gel tonight, brushed nearly against his eyebrows. He didn't say anything, just rubbed his thumb over a worn spot on the wood table between them.
Some members of the circus privately wondered if Harry had been shot out of a metal tube at high velocities one too many times, but since he was a good lad, sweet and always willing to help anyone out, these opinions were kept largely quiet.
He paused. "That one threw me off, cause the Fossors hate the lights, and the Malfoys as well, but they never go up there; they have no reason to. So it wasn't them."
"The sacrifices one makes for love, Malfoy. You do look incredible though; the darker color suits you, makes your eyes 'pop' more."
But now, In the half-light, the rows of stones looked like sleeping soldiers, moments away from awakening, crouched forms ready for battle. He shivered.
"Some things, there's just no help for," Harry agreed, a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.
"He still has the scar, the Sectumsempra scar. I saw it when his teddy slid off, and the light flickered over his chest; it's unmistakable."
He turned and made his way back to the eating tent, making the cook very happy by having not just seconds, but thirds of everything.
Harry wasn't sure what he was supposed to know – Hermione hadn't briefed him on that subject lately. As the Deputy Minister of Magic, she saw fit to shoot him priority information about his job, reputation and personal life a couple of times a week, knowing full well that he didn't pay attention to any of it. Lately, she'd been slacking off, but then again, it was an election year, so Harry let it go.
Darcy kept his eyes mostly down as he licked and sucked Harry's cock, reaching around with his free hand to dig his nails into Harry's ass, keeping him still as he worked.
Draco snorted, and then laughed aloud. "I would say so. You have a rather nice arse, so I would hope nothing too untoward would happen to it."
Normally, Harry would have saved showering until after his nightly volley through the air, but Draco's comments about bear shit stung, and about a half hour before the evening's performance, he snuck into the family tent to wash up and was greeted by a naked Charlie Weasley, who was, he said, "performing a little personal maintenance." To Harry, it just looked painful – if someone had spread hot wax on his nether regions and then yanked it off, his screams would have been heard in Third World countries. Charlie, however, was nonplussed. "Beauty isn't easy, Harry," he said, calmly ripping a strip off a place that made Harry go pale. "But the rewards are great."
"Did," Harry replied. "Whores don't kiss on the lips I'm told, so you actually got more than your money's worth with that one." He smiled slightly and moved past Draco, his beer held loosely in his fingers. "Do I have mail?"
"Now?" He was hungry and damn sure Ginny wasn't going to share her bun. "Can't we talk later, like after breakfast, after tea or maybe never?" He was personally hoping for never, but his dreams were crushed when she shook her head. "No, now; our future is in jeopardy, Harry and we need to make some decisions. Come on."
"That's what he – Draco - did too. He went to a…" Harry trailed off, realizing he needed another drink and waved at the bartender, who brought them fresh ales. "He went to a website where you can pick guys. Like, based on not only what they look like, but how big their cocks are and how long they need before they're ready to go again." He drained half his ale.
Well, all right, just Dudley. He'd been oddly touched by his cousin's last-minute concern for him the night of his birthday, and had gone back to tell him so. Strangely enough, after a few moments of awkwardness, they'd gotten on, and Dudley had introduced him to marijuana, weed, grass, whatever you wanted to call it. His cousin had confided that weed was the only reason he'd been able to tolerate Vernon and Petunia once he'd turned fourteen; Harry could sympathize.
"S'ok," said Harry, stretching. "As long as you got off, I'm sure you're fine. Always are." He spelled the mess off the sheets with a lazy hand gesture and extinguished the small lamp Draco had lit, then turned over. "Night, Malfoy."
Draco's hand slammed down into the table in front of him, cracking the mug - coffee ran in rivulets everywhere. "I Have Said I Was Sorry a million fucking times now! What the hell else do you want from me? Check the computer, check my mobile! I know it was wrong, and I stopped, but you keep punishing me!"
"Who are the prime suspects?" Draco was being unwillingly drawn into Potter's oddness; at least he wasn't boring. And maybe he was a genius of some sort. Highly doubtful, but possible.
"Pans, I'm taking Draco home to my flat. He needs a little time and if he's going out tonight he has no clothes for clubbing that Potter might not recognize. I, on the other hand, have an enormous closet full of slutty outfits so leave this part to me."
unfortunate – the last, the very last thing he needed in his glamorous life was an alcoholic, washed-up wizard with a bad attitude. But that drunk was Harry; possibly the one and only person Draco ever thought he
Harry shrugged and helped Hagrid feed the crew of animals, some of whom were happy to see them, some who pretended indifference to their presence, and some who actively tried to maul them. Hagrid claimed they just wanted petting. "See there, 'Arry…just needs some love, don't ya, ya little rascal?"
For the rest of the show, Harry felt rooted in place, his stomach flipping and twisting like an aerialist's antics. And like them, he had no net, nothing to catch him when he fell.
Harry looked at her in disbelief. "Fuck, no, I'm not happy! You tried to kill Draco! Not just once, but three separate times!"
Harry nodded and took a sip of his drink. Draco continued. "He thought things were fine between us, and so did I, actually, but I…" He bit his lip. "I did something phenomenally stupid and he found out and left me."
She was fair-skinned and emphasized the point with heavy black eyeliner, but the lips, the lips Harry couldn't stop staring at, were natural. They were heavily glossed, but the color was the unmistakably peachy-pink of real skin.
act tonight, but whatever. He watched with barely contained amusement as his father and Harry appeared, dying a little at his father's face when he discovered the switch. He'd never known Lucius could turn that shade of red – it was actually rather becoming.
"That's because you smell like skrewt shit most of the time," she hissed, the first words she'd said through all this. She turned her eyes to Harry. "Fine. I did it, I did all of it. Happy, Mr. Detective?"
He was grateful to sit down again and the hands rubbing his head felt good; he closed his eyes and tried to relax. Panicking was not going to help. Killing Paul was not going to help, and only an idiot killed his stylist before he was done anyway. Said stylist was now rubbing some sort of sticky substance between his fingers and applying it to various pieces of hair before stepping back and nodding. "This works."
He gave Harry a small smile. "When you go back to whatever world you live in the rest of the time, that is."
Harry didn't answer for a moment, just went to the bar and mixed them each their favorite drink, handing Draco his before sitting down on the couch and nodding to the seat beside him. "Now we figure out how you can learn not be afraid of us and I make you understand what it’s like to feel how I felt."
"Harry, honestly – you told her no, she asked you to move on so she could hook someone else for the night – pardon the expression – and now you're all upset? Maybe you should spend your vacation on a couch, with a good therapist about three feet away."
"He won't accept any of my apologies, Pans - I've fucking tried and tried. He just nods in that infuriating way and then makes some little, pointed comment that just, it hurts. He knows how to hurt me. He's never been cruel before. Okay, nasty sometimes, like when we're fighting and he's pissed off at me, but never cruel." He looked up. "He's acting like - like I never knew him at all."
He knew, somewhere in the mist of rage covering his thoughts, that Draco wasn’t about to abandon all their work now, and that he probably shouldn’t have called him a whore.
“It very well might…” He frowned at it a moment longer before patting Harry’s cheek lightly. “Come with me, Potter. The spells can wait.”
He was igniting a completely new sensation—a push of magic through his wand, and in his trousers. Harry’s cock stiffened uncomfortably hard, and several silvery sparks surged from the tip of his wand.
“We’ll need some to shield the entire lot and those will be conditional, that’s what we’re practising now. The others are specific to each individual tent, interior and exterior, and they’re to be more universal. The overarching ones are the most vital to have done first, they’ll weave in with the other protections, and they’re the most complex. We’ll need to cast them subtly, but once they’re in place we’ll have a lot less to worry about in terms of privacy and security. Don’t bother with the bottom set of illusions for now, we’ll deal with them tomorrow.”
Primarily on the potential consequences of his being gone for so long. He had also been disloyal to Ginny again, and would almost certainly be forced to lie outright this time, and not just to her either.
As promised, he made them a proper breakfast down in the manor’s kitchen—and twice Harry succeeded in getting a bit of cherry jam on the very nice shirt he was borrowing. Each time, Draco charmed it clean in a tone of bored annoyance before he’d even noticed what happened.
As he Apparated into the village, the taste of cinnamon lingered still at the tip of Harry’s tongue.
“I’ll be more thankful to get out flying properly, not sorting whatever latest explosion’s embedded itself in the ceiling.”
“Fine, alright. Fucking first, then we’ll have a light breakfast and get on with casting for a few hours. Fair?”
Malfoy took his time selecting another drink from the depleting tray on the table before them, while Harry waited rather impatiently for an answer.
Harry stared at him overwhelmed for several quiet beats. “You know I really couldn’t do any of this without you.”
Draco surprised Harry by standing to offer his hand, which Cassie took, looking terribly flattered. She wished them both well as they headed back out the way they’d come.
That one night was behind them now, and Harry didn’t see why their meetings and letters couldn’t stay strictly professional.
He would then inevitably feel guilty for not feeling as guilty as he should, all of which then led to a lot of frustration, and a headache.
On one of the bottle’s sides was a silver label, and ‘pain potion’ written in Malfoy’s careful script. As much as he ached then Harry didn’t hesitate to down it, and the resulting relief was worth the risk. It was still a bit painful to walk, but traversing the distance to clear Hogwarts’ Apparation barriers was an excruciating experience for an entirely different reason—it was giving him too much time to think.
“Right. Curtains first, then we’ll revisit the protective enchantments, and a few other vital matters. Then I’ll offer my very enthusiastic gratitude.”
Harry watched a shift of shock and recognition cross Malfoy’s expression before he pulled his usual superior mask.
“On the contrary. It’s intriguing—although I’m not entirely sure you understand what you’re asking for when you look at me that way.”
“He was taking advantage of my wardrobe, and my shower, for a date that was not with me. I haven’t fucked Blaise for over a year, you
Draco hummed low and open-mouthed against his lips when Harry pressed his tongue in to taste and explore, lost in how much he had missed the taste of him since last Saturday. He’d gone over a month that summer without seeing him, and yet suddenly a week felt too long.
She watched him a moment longer, reaching across the table to brush a few messy strands back where they obscured his glasses, exposing his scar in the process. “Will you come to bed soon?”
And Harry couldn’t take it anymore—he closed his lips around the head of Draco’s cock, rubbing the tip of his wand as rapidly as he could in Draco’s tight hold, over just the right spot.
It took Harry several beats leaning against the lift’s wall as it hurtled unpredictably before everything stopped spinning, and only then did it fully occur to him where Malfoy had just taken them.
Once he’d swallowed most everything properly, Draco slithered up to kiss him for a long while and it was absolutely wonderful—until Harry abruptly yawned into the kiss.
That evening Harry ate alone in his kitchen, scrawling out a short note to the heads of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, requesting several days off, and making a point not to examine too closely how he was explicitly endeavoring to do the opposite of enforce the law. If he kept his mind on the part where they were doing the right thing, then he could mostly avoid panicking at the thought of what the consequences might be if they were caught.
Harry has a bit of explaining to do, and adjusts to some new information about himself, his goals, and Draco Malfoy.
Through the mirror, striking silver narrowed under the wispy cover of pale lashes, locking with the hungry spark of Harry’s green before drifting downward. They both watched Harry’s hand slipping into the open front of Draco’s trousers, exposing a shock of light curls as he rubbed over Draco’s cock through his pants, pushing down at the front of them to expose more of him to the mirror.
“Sorry,” he apologised. “Busy day, busy week. I ought to be heading back now, I’m just on my break—but I’ll talk to you soon.”
As always, he wanted him quite badly, but as always they grew so preoccupied snogging he lost time in the sultry squirm of Draco’s arse in his lap, working a skillfully taunting friction on his cock. Harry only wanted to pull him closer, it was Draco who finally broke the heated wet tangle of their mouths.
“Hang on, there’s more,” Harry promised. He used the marker to draw a simple HP over the little dome, and it drew itself on its partner in tandem. When he erased the P on the other light, it erased on both.
“If he wanted to hurt me, he could have done it ages ago.” He ignored their looks of faint horror and went on. “As I said, none of it was even his idea—it was all mine. I know what I’m doing.”
"Oh for Christ sakes, Draco - you own the bloody company! You could go to the office in a gorilla suit and no one would dare even flinch. But this is perfect - you look nothing like you, really, but still, so hot. When Harry spies you he will be so hard for you that he will just …”
That Sunday, there was a message on the machine from Draco when Harry got home from having dinner with Aaron. "Hey, I'm going to be home Monday night around 6 PM. I hope you'll be home because we need to talk about a lot of things. And also because I've really missed you, Harry. I hope that maybe you've missed me a little bit too."
He'd make his way to his couch, push off the accumulated debris of the night before, and pour a Scotch – he kept his bar needs on his coffee table, handily enough – and flip on the telly.
He went to his closet and stared at the clothes there, and without thinking, he pulled out a white tank top and suede trousers that clung to everything. He didn't bother with underwear and paused only long enough to dunk his head in the sink, towel off and rub some gel through his hair, spiking it up wildly – it seemed to work for him.
Harry did, even holding a match for him. "Consider that the extent of my grand gestures for the night." He drew back and leaned against the wall a few feet from Draco, ill-concealed confusion on his face.
Harry didn't let him do anything; he pushed back, he wrapped around him, he moaned out loud and clenched him with his heat and strong muscles and kissed him as though it was the last moment on earth and all he wanted before the abyss opened and took them all, was Draco.
"To get you back to looking like you, dunderhead - you aren't going back to Harry looking like someone else, are you?"
Shrieks of "Aguamenti" went unheeded, as only one wizard in the tent had the ability to cast spells within those canvas walls, and he was being nearly trampled underfoot by the crowd as they frantically pushed to escape what was rapidly turning into an inferno.
This, right now, was the perfect time to say simply, "I don't," then get up and walk out the door. It was the opening of a lifetime. Draco knew what had happened to Potter now, he was sufficiently disgusted by his surroundings, and this was the best possible time to pull his superiority blanket around him like a cloak and stalk out of Harry Potter's life. One couldn't ask for more.
They walked down the street towards their flat, Harry's hand curled securely around Draco's; that simple touch was enough to make his eyes burn and he blinked several times on the relatively short walk home.
"Great." He was still trying to steady his breathing. Panic, anger and an average of a pack and a half of cigarettes a day was not helping him catch his breath.
He chose jeans –which he rarely wore and therefore would arouse no suspicion – and a simple pullover which clung to him just enough to show off his body, but not enough to be overtly sexy. He made sure he had Muggle money and slid into his new suede jacket, new so Harry wouldn't recognize it. Taking one last look at himself, he reflected that he'd always relied on his looks to get him what he wanted and when that failed, he'd throw money at the problem till it either went away or got solved. Now suddenly it wasn't enough - nothing he'd ever done was enough.
"Yes, it should be ready, let me look." He wiped a thick strand with a tissue. "All right, come back here and we'll get you set up."
"He wasn't toading at the time; he didn't lick the toad till we drove away, and then he let it go back into the wild. He has abandonment issues, so that was a big step for him."
Ginny was glaring at both of them now. "You are both sick, sick boys. Look what you've done to Harry, Charlie! You've turned him into a pervert too!"
Kingsley cleared his throat. "And I see that you haven't taken a vacation in four years. In fact, you barely have more than two days strung together, and you're way overdue. I think a break would be good for you."
Harry shrugged. "If you say so; I have no idea where my wand even is. I think it's under some laundry or maybe last year's newspapers but I couldn't swear to it. It – magic – isn't something I need anymore."
Around him, their road crew, girls from the audience, and other hangers-on were flooding the room, and Draco mechanically accepted congratulations, pats on whatever part of his body people could reach, and many kisses on the cheek. He thanked them all in a monotone, but no one seemed to notice.
Draco nodded, his stomach tightening as he sat down beside Harry. He looked at Harry as he sipped his scotch, watching his throat move as he swallowed. "Harry?"
"Because I just would, all right? I told you I was in the same predicament and I am and I know how stupid *I* am and I can gather from what you're saying that your Draco and I are just a little too fucking similar for words." He was breathing heavily now, his breath coming in short, staccato bursts. He reached for his ale and drained half of it.
Draco swallowed. "Yeah, you need one here, don't you?" Thank God, he sounded normal. Or as normal as he could.
At all; his body felt frozen in place, and frissons of tension were starting to explode along his spine.
Harry gave him a smile. "Course I am, I live here. Later." He kissed Draco's cheek lightly and left the way he'd come, his keys jingling in his hand.
Potter had come to see him. Never mind that he thought Draco was Milo – names were nothing. They were a place-holder, that was all. He had obviously spent time staring at Milo's face, memorizing it, dreaming of it. He had seen the familiar look on Potter's face moments before he recognized him – it was the look of wanting someone. Potter had wanted him, and when Draco had seen the eyes that haunted him still, whether asleep or awake, his own desire for Potter had been unmistakable, too. That's why Potter had been out there, Draco knew. The exit wasn't well known; it wasn't the stage door they'd normally leave by, and unless Potter spent time at Underworld often, he wouldn't even know about that alley. Somehow, some way, Potter had known to go there, known how to find him.
The lights dimmed once again, and haunting music filled the air as in the center ring, now magically draped with silver and glass accents, became home to father and son. Not for nothing were they termed marvelous; alliteration and it's rolling off the tongue aside, their fluid and somehow impossible movements captivated the crowd as they twisted and turned, folding and unfolding their limbs, bending and flipping – all with such natural grace that one forgot that what they did didn't seem humanly possible.
So it was with some trepidation, some raised eyebrows and some outright annoyance that the news that a new act had been acquired was received. That trepidation turned to vociferous outcries when the act turned out to be the Marvelous Malfoys – a father/son contortionist act that was popular in Europe proper.
"Whatever." Draco sounded bored and irate, and was. He hated that they had had to join up with a decidedly low-rent (by the looks) enterprise and even more, that he and his father would share billing with those bloody Weasleys who were really no more than a bunch of over-bred monkeys. He trudged along behind Harry, hoping that the wind was wafting upwards 'cause damn that boy smelled ripe.
"I'm not," admitted Draco, and fuck, this was weird. "We've had a pretty huge falling out and I don't know if things can be fixed. I want them to be, more than anything," he swallowed, "but if he doesn't feel the same, then I don’t know what I’ll do.”
Left me. The words sounded a thousand times more terrible spoken aloud, and it was true. In many ways, Harry had left him, even if he was technically still present in the flat.
For the first time in many months, Harry had not only showered, but shaved and attempted to make his hair do something other than stand on end. He was wearing clean clothes, even, and God help him, cologne.
"I don't think it’s time to date anyone. I mean, Draco should be home in a couple of days and we'll need to talk, and then figure things out and you have your own issues, yeah?”
He'd bought their four CDs and listened to them endlessly. He'd read everything he could find on the internet, including something called "RPS," which seemed to be slash-type stories featuring the band members, written by fans. He was no judge of fiction, but while a few were pretty good, most of the stories were, to put it kindly, terrible. However, one or two were downright hot, and those he had saved to his hard drive for wanking purposes.
Before Draco could spit out a snappy rejoinder, Pansy broke in. "Well, love, our Draco is a choice piece, I know, but you see, his boyfriend has essentially left him and just…" she waved her hand, "…started going out without him. So, Draco wants to find him. But the boyfriend - let's call him Harry…"
"What about Draco? I never went to his trial, or Goyle's or any of that crew. Are they in Azkaban too?"
Darcy smirked. "That's what all the gentlemen say – then I see myself on the internet. But feel free to snap away – I have no secrets."
They'd barely made it to the bedroom when Harry was out; and tired as he was, Draco lay and watched him, watched him breathe, watched his eyelashes flutter as he dreamed, watched as his sweat-damp hair dried into little curls on his neck and he sighed and turned over in his sleep.
"All of them?" Sam Adams looked aghast. "You have files on your desk from eight months ago, plus a whole write up on a fictional flying flounder yet to file! Why me?"
It had been a long time since they'd stopped in London, and Draco was surprised to find that he had missed it, a little. Stepping off the plane at Heathrow, the familiar weight of the air pressed down on his chest, and he swallowed hard.
"Wizards are supposed to have long hair, and yours looks perfect now that it's past your shoulders, finally. You could tie it back."
"Sure he's not. Harry isn't interested at all." Charlie nodded knowingly and glanced down at Harry's jumpsuit; Ginny's gaze followed and she nearly choked, tearing her hand out of his pocket and spilling her popcorn everywhere and driving the nearby leopard-spotted monkeys wild. Fortunately, the performance ended before the monkeys could create total chaos. Ginny glared at Harry. "How could you like him?" She hissed.
Harry was picking frosting out of his eyebrows. "I figured that out, thanks. Where was your sage advice five minutes ago?"
Draco nudged Harry over onto his back and lay next to him, his head resting on Harry's chest, his fingertips stroking the dark hair there.
The rest of the evening had passed in a blur and even stretching his memory to its limit, he was hard pressed to remember much else than those eyes locking onto his at every opportunity.
"Not that much, surely," said Harry, zipping up. "All the men you fancied had much shorter hair than mine was." He moved out to the hall. "Night." And he was gone - again.
They left the bar, ignoring the amused glances of several patrons as they exited; the bar had filled up while they were occupied, and apparently, they hadn't exactly been quiet.
He took a few steps towards the bleachers, where Ginny sat in the third row, looking petrified, although sadly, not literally. "The Super Glue was a smart move; even with the frosting, I might have been led astray. But then I remembered where you took me to talk at me about our supposed relationship ... next to Sybill's tent, where you had apparently been spending a lot of time, asking her to read tea leaves, use her crystal ball, contact spirits and whatever the hell else you two did to see if we would be together. Remember the smell I mentioned and you denied smelling? And oddly enough, when you smacked me in the face with that sticky bun and I spent most of the day scraping the frosting out of my eyebrows? It made it very easy to identify the chunks of matter in the Super Glue."
The hell of it is, is that Harry wasn't sure they weren't. "Perhaps near the end." He considered a moment, biting his lip as he watched Darcy stretch, inspect her nails and then look over him. The gaze was more calculating than sexy, but she – he – was all business.
"Harry?" The voice came from the living room, and a moment later, Draco appeared in the doorway, nearly sagging with relief. "Thank God - I've been so fucking worried about you!"
"Oh God, I'm so sorry, I had no idea.” Paul was flushing, and looked regretful for ever opening his mouth
He'd sounded so broken and his eyes had been shiny and hot, brimming with the same heavy tears that threatened his own right now.
The sharp crack of apparition echoed throughout the flat, and Harry, upstairs in the loo, shivered when he heard it.
Harry nodded. "They are." He bit his lip and then touched his face gently. "You're happy in this life, aren't you?"
"Yes." Darcy turned his head to brush a soft kiss over Harry's palm before moving his hand away. "A lovely memory for a lovely man."
Harry shook his head to rid himself of such random thoughts and booted up the laptop, lighting another cigarette and pouring his fourth scotch and water – sans water – of the day.
Ginny sat him down on a rock near the fortune-teller's tent; Trelawney could be heard loudly snoring through her deviated septum and frankly, Harry questioned Ginny's choice of venue for deciding their future, but then figured it made a weird kind of sense.
There were other Weasleys; the classic middle child, Percy who suffered greatly (and ironically) from acrophobia, and therefore stayed on the ground, assisting the Animal Master, Rubeus Hagrid with the care and feeding of his extraordinary menagerie. The last Weasley was not, biologically, a Weasley at all, but a young man named Harry Potter. Harry had been orphaned at age three when his parents, James and Lily, had gotten a little too familiar with their tigers and had become, respectively, a meal and a snack for said tigers. It had been deemed an Unfortunate Incident by the Ministry of Magic, and little Harry had been immediately adopted by the Weasleys, for whom one more mouth to feed seemed little problem.
"That would be excellent – could we just meet at a pub?" He had given this man his actual name, which was unusual enough. He wasn't ready to have anyone know where he lived.
They began to walk again, as the time for dinner drew near. "Uhm," said Harry after a moment or so. "About what she said…I do like you." The blush was back. "I'm sorry it embarrassed you and I'm sure you just think I'm some geeky freak, but," he shrugged. "I do."
"Don't be so jumpy; good God, this stuff is like plaster. I'm not even sure a scouring charm could get this off." He drew back his finger and in a surprise move, licked the tip of his finger, producing a reaction in Harry that was nothing short of explosive. He just hoped his pants weren't showing it.
"No, Draco, where do you start? I can't go with you; it would be a dead giveaway. And I like how I look, thanks, and plan on changing nothing. You need to go alone."
Having shuffled his untidy pile into a larger, more untidy pile, Kingsley looked over it at Harry. "Do you know why you're here, Harry?"
"Ah, well, what can you expect from a woman? Overemotional to the extreme, prone to throwing things, jealous, hormonally unbalanced…"
"It is that way! Why the hell didn't you talk to me as you, Draco Malfoy? Why did you hide behind someone else?"
Draco sighed and took another long drag, letting the smoke settle in his lungs. "I shudder to think exactly what you two have in mind."
Both unruly black eyebrows headed north towards Harry's hairline. "Check in on me? Aww, Malfoy, I didn't know you cared."
“Don’t say that if you don’t mean it, Draco - making changes out of guilt alone is never a good idea.”
"We didn't have sex, he just, uhm, pleasured me orally. And damn, he was good, too. Amazing, in fact; you should see his face when he does this little thing with his tongue that makes me want to …”
"Uh, no." Harry scratched his neck. "I had a bit of a disagreement with Ginny and she got rather upset with me."
She stretched, long legs appearing even longer as the black chemise she was wearing hiked up, almost to the point of showing the goods – almost. Harry swallowed again as her smile widened, noting his reaction. "Well, darling, if you're interested, I have the time in the world as they say. Show me your list and I'm sure I can make you a happy, happy boy tonight."
Harry tugged Draco into the loo without any further words, and shut and locked the door behind them before turning, tossing his glasses onto the sink and with one fluid move pinned Draco to the damp and slightly sticky cement wall. And before Draco could speak, Harry's mouth crashed down onto his, covering it and kissing him hungrily. He forced his tongue between Draco's lips and plundered his mouth, seeking and finding all the hidden spots, sliding his hot tongue along the roof of Draco's mouth.
What the hell? Draco found himself looking at the spot where Harry had been a moment before, then got up and looked around helplessly, until something caught his eye.
The rest of the Weasleys trailed after their parents, and Harry knew he'd be sleeping with the animals tonight.
"In both of his lives, I rejected him. In our first year, I wouldn't take his hand and that made him, at least partly, what he was. What he felt he had to become. And now, again, I walked away from him. What will it do to him now?"
Still, it wasn't enough to make his brain stop ticking over the last memories he had of what was, truly, 'the one that got away.' It wasn't enough to make him stop thinking about Harry Potter.
On Saturday, Draco found himself feeling decidedly antsy. He couldn't concentrate on anything except seeing Harry, having drinks or dinner or whatever with him, in a place where you didn't have to scream to be heard and where they could, finally, talk - about the situation, about them, even though Draco wasn't supposed to be Draco.
Pansy sighed, "How did this become about you, Draco? It seems that this is about the changes Harry has made, how HE reacted to what you did, so why am I hearing "Me, me, me?"
Harry managed to stand, his head spinning in a most unpleasant manner. He had long since moved past hangovers – or so he thought – but this feeling promised a real winner of one.
Pansy laughed out loud. "Your Harry, Draco, killed Voldemort with the Elder Wand: decimated his remaining followers in the year after that, sparing your family and mine, neither of whom deserved to be spared, and in his most stunning display of bravery and guts yet, he's been your lover for two years and actually lived with your pain in the arse self for a year. Your Harry isn't afraid of anything, and a wild gay club or fetish bar isn't about to change that."
As the rising sun burned its sparkling image into his corneas, he found himself repeating the same mantra to himself that he had since the day he arrived in Paris.
Blaise trailed along behind them, too amused to stay abreast. Besides, he wanted to be clear of the explosion when Malfoy finally got what Pansy was getting at.
Dumbledore offered the use of his tent, and Lucius accepted, for once not having a snarky comeback ready. The two Malfoys were gently shepherded off and the rest of the group wandered off in twos and threes, leaving only Harry and Hagrid still there at the scene.
At first, it had been an act - 'cool', uncaring Harry, up for random encounters of all times; he'd had to force himself. But one night it had become more. One night he had been dancing and looked around to see desire on more than one face; desire for him. Realized that men waited to ask him to dance, or buy him drinks; realized he was wanted. It was a heady feeling and lost and alone as he felt, he'd embraced it. But no
He sighed and Arthur looked at him sympathetically. "Never mind his language Molly; Harry, if you would?"
She looked up as Harry walked up to the window, and gave him a lazy smile, then leaned to open a small window which served for communication. "Goede Avond," she purred.
He was beautiful, Harry had to admit; pale blond, dark eyed, with thin lips and a narrow face. Given his basic features, he shouldn't have been so pretty – but he was. Maybe it was the makeup that made the difference between rather plain, even slightly pinched features, and flat-out gorgeous. His name, Harry discovered, was Milo. Huh. He didn't look much like a Milo, but Harry supposed that if all names were made to fit people perfectly, his would have to be changed to Disheveled Drunk – maybe he should look into it. Let people know what they were getting, as it were. The singer had no last name listed and didn't need one; like Beyoncé or Zayn, Milo seemed an entity unto himself.
Draco turned the photo face down on the bedside table - he’d been staring at it for hours and it had finally become too much for him to take. Watching himself smile as the ring was placed on his finger, then glancing up at the person who was holding his hand tight as his other hand tilted Draco’s face up for the sealing kiss…then watching Harry’s grin light the picture up as he turned his face towards the crowd of friends and loved ones in respond to the “It’s about damn time!” shouted by one Ron Weasley, who was already three sheets to the wind, thanks to an early arrival and the well-stocked open bar. Harry had laughed at that and held up Draco’s hand with the gleaming gold band on it in triumph.
When he was finished with Hagrid, he retired to his "room" in the Weasley family tent; magic was a lovely thing, he thought, and not for the first time. The outside looked like an army surplus pup tent, while inside housed six bedrooms, two baths and a gourmet kitchen for Molly. Harry had his own room; being an orphan and frankly " a bit of an odd boy, really, Merlin bless him," had gotten him that, although Ron complained bitterly of being stuck with Percy, and Ginny, of course, got her own room. Harry was grateful for the privacy, even more so as they grew older, as it gave him a quiet place to wank, and not incidentally, a place to hide his issues of "Magic Monthly," which often featured a certain blond duo; a duo which Harry was anxious to make acquaintance with.
“Spare me the discourse on my lack of empathy; I’ve been kicking myself for the last hour as it is. Which one is it?”
At half five, a thump off to his left made him look up, only to see two blond heads emerge from a cloud of dust. "Honestly, Father, a port key? Out in a field? What's the matter with Apparating for God's sakes?"
Draco looked and looked, and sometimes he'd be sure he saw him and nearly break his neck getting down to the floor, but it was never Harry. Close, perhaps - maybe it was the wave of the hair, or the highlights or the flash of skin, but in the end, the bloke was never who he sought.
"Hmmm? Oh. Yes. Love the chocolate – energy, you know." Harry hastily shoved the last of the brownie in his mouth – it was small but packed a powerful punch. Mmmm.
It was a simple life, and perhaps not what he'd once envisioned for himself, but it was what he had.
Harry had spent the day thinking about Draco; he had pulled out photo albums and looked at them; saved notes; invitations addressed to them both, everything that reminded him of their life together. He'd replayed their fights in his head, and then the make-up sex later. He wondered what he was doing going out with someone else, even in the most casual circumstances, but he told himself that he wasn't looking for anything from Aaron; they were both in fucked up situations and were just a couple of blokes crying into their beers, right?
"He's…he's cool, just this side of cold. He's dismissive. He acts like we're roommates, not even friends, let alone lovers. He turns over and goes to sleep in bed, doesn't even say goodnight unless I say it first. He's going out ALL the time, comes home smelling like smoke and spilled booze. He dresses like a slut, which aesthetically is pleasing, but it's not for my enjoyment, dammit. And worst of all, he cut his hair off, almost all of it; it had finally gotten to look perfect and he went and did that."
Harry had a laptop – he'd bought it in a rare moment of thinking he should really get his shit together and get a life, and a computer. Computers had something on them called the internet, and people with lives were on the internet – of this he was certain. When he had relayed that thought to Hermione, whom he'd called to come set up this electronic miracle, she'd snorted. He hadn't asked why, and a year and a half later, he still knew nothing of the internet, other than that video poker was often a really bad idea. And there was porn –  lots of porn. By the grace of God and a credit card, any kink you had could be viewed, paused, rewound, and viewed again. And again, and again, till it was imprinted on your corneas for life.
Draco had a ribald reply to that, but thought better of it. "Yes, plus extraordinary flexibility is a Malfoy family trait, plus lots of practice, of course. Glad you enjoyed it."
"Draco, love, this is good. This is information. You know where he goes now, you know he doesn't hook up - you can plan. Paul, is he ready to rinse?"
"We'll speak when you get home." It was all he could offer, and as he ended the call and closed the phone, he wondered what in hell was going to happen to them.
Maybe you bored him senseless, but his stupid Gryffindoric loyalty kept him with you until you fucked up and he could flee. Maybe he likes this life, loves it, even.
"No, it wasn't, Harry," he whispered, huddled in a miserable ball against the door of the stall. "I never wanted to break the heart I treasured so much."
It was Draco, and he was standing right in front of him. "Thank you," he said softly, and before Harry could answer, he was being kissed, warmly and firmly, and arms were around him, hands sinking into his hair. He responded fully, kissing Draco back…and it was just like he'd always dreamed it would be.
But the stars of the show, make no mistake, were the Winged Weasleys, so named because of their aerial feats. Without use of any kind of net, they soared, dipped, flipped and flew through the air as though part bird.
During this performance, Ginny and Charlie had noiselessly slipped down to watch on the same level and now flanked Harry. "Whoa," whispered Charlie. "Now that? That is talent. I wonder what he can do in…"
"Just had a couple of questions for you," replied Harry, his voice even and low with great effort. "Did you pick a new one every time? Or did you find a favorite? Or a couple of them? Did you measure their cocks first to make sure that numbers didn't lie or did you just take their word for it?"
settled down: that I was more than fine staying in and watching the telly with him, that I didn't care that he was a slob, that he left his dishes in the sink and never rinsed them, that he actually used bar soap on his ha…" He stopped quickly. Too many details. "I got scared that I didn't want anything else."
The girl looked as shocked as he felt, and for a moment, Harry fancied he saw a brief shadow, a fleeting expression of disappointment – maybe anger – cross that pretty face, but when he blinked and refocused, all that was there was a bored curl of the lip.
Draco scrambled out of bed and gripped his shoulder, holding onto it tightly. "Harry, I - it's nothing, just an amusing pastime, a diversion. They don't MEAN anything to me."
As the Fossors came on for their final skit, the rest of the Weasleys appeared. Ginny dragged Harry away and Charlie reluctantly took his eyes off Lucius - but not before waggling his fingers at the other man and smiling in a most suggestive way. Harry was very glad that he was not sharing a room with Charlie tonight, as he was a moaner and seemed to have a lot of stamina for certain pastimes.
Draco turned and moved blindly to the hall and the door, not even stopping for a jacket even though it was late November and snow was threatening the air. He pushed open the door and left the flat, stumbling blindly down the street.
Draco stood there for a moment. "Yes, on the desk." Then he shook himself and went after the other man. "Harry, let's - we need to talk about this."
In the month since he'd first heard that first song, "Galaxy of Dreams," he had become – for lack of better word – a fan boy. Or a fan man, rather.
Skin City was aptly named, as many of its patrons preferred to be half clothed at best, and often wound up completely nude. This was partially due to the ridiculously high temperature the club was kept at, and partially due to the excellent DJ who got even the most jaded soul out onto the dance floor, working up a sweat. It was nearly impossible to talk there, or to hear anything but the thumping beat, or to feel anything except the music.
Blaise, meanwhile, was advising Draco to go and check them out, drag Potter home and then make him see reason with his cock, and if all else failed, toys. Big toys. Big, lifelike toys.
Before Draco could react, Harry moved forward and grabbed Draco's arm, turning it roughly palm upwards. "Bet all your fans think this is just a really cool tattoo."
Harry's heart was pounding, and he couldn't tear his eyes away from the man standing just mere feet from him, his eyes sweeping the crowd.
He managed to nod and exited the club first, waiting in a shadowy alley to make sure Harry came out alone too and made no side trips to say, the loo or a back room, but Harry came out, pulling up his collar against the cold breeze and Apparating as soon as he got to a suitable point. Draco then went home, crawled into bed with Harry's sweatshirt and dreamed of waking wrapped around Harry.
After he'd finished his morning ablutions such as they were, he would wander out to his tiny kitchen which adjoined his tiny living room, and root around in the icebox, eating whatever he found that didn't seem liable to bite him back. Often, his breakfast consisted of sweet pickles and a slice or six of processed cheese. It was enough for the first scotch to grab onto and kept him from vomiting, and that's all Harry really asked from anything animal, vegetable, or mineral these days.
"Aren't we all?" chimed in another voice, this from a very young whore, one who looked barely older than thirteen, and probably wasn't. "Too bad all the pretty ones are working girls."
"Thank you. Now, the purpose of this little gathering is to get to the bottom of what's been going on, before we're all out of a job, a home, and attending a funeral."
Owned and operated by Albus Dumbledore, a renowned wizard in his own right, the circus was a draw to all, big and small, old and young; as the saying went, there was a little something for everyone.
Before Harry could answer, however, Charlie broke in. "How could he not? Malfoy is choice. Those lips, those eyes that arse, that flowing hair…" He trailed off and sighed happily. Harry looked at him askance. "Are we looking at the same Malfoy?"
Harry snorted a bit. "He's probably not sure how to talk to you about it, and frankly, it probably hurts him too much to even broach the subject."
Draco was still stroking Harry, hand firm and warm, and whatever else might be going on in Harry’s mind, his body was responding to the touches. Draco knew how to touch him, and soon, Harry was making the little moans and sighs that drove Draco wild, and had since their first heated encounter during 6th year.
When he could breathe, he began to walk shakily towards a spot he could Apparate from, but a slight movement in the windows that lined the street made him glance up.
"Yes, please," said Harry, relieved. "I'm afraid I might ask you for a stuffed Cornish Game Hen or the latest score for Manchester United if I tried to speak Dutch."
His pondering was short-lived, however, because a quick scan of the available telly channels led him to some decidedly adult fare and he was soon happily ensconced in bed, soothing the savage breast – and other body parts as well. He was on vacation, after all.
He rolled Harry over and straddled him, pinning his arms above his head. Harry looked up at him, but there was very little expression in those green eyes. Draco leaned down and pressed his lips against Harry's and he let him.
"The Graphon was a tricky one, though, Gin…I have the popcorn and I have the bit of Draco's costume, but the keys?"
"Why are you - I'm sorry, all right? It was a stupid thing to do, I don't even know WHY I did it, it just seemed…" Draco trailed off, not sure what to say, cause he knew his actions were inexcusable and that Harry had every right to be pissed. He just had never seen this side of him.
"Charles, I do not generally take the time to gawk at any male body parts that do not belong to either your father's or one of you children…speaking of which, Harry dear, how is that rash of yours coming along?"
"God yes; he's all I've ever fucking wanted in this life. We shouldn't even BE together, given the shit we've lived through, but I love him."
"Twenty-seven months," answered Kingsley dryly. "But I think a month, six weeks, might be good for a start."
"Oh." He didn't ask how he'd looked or if anyone had been with him - he was pretty sure not, but still didn't want to know.
She shook her head and pulled out some pamphlets, waving her wand – which, unaccountably had a troll doll taped to it – to flip through them. "Well, dear, if its wild oats that are the issue, we could send you to Amsterdam. They do have a legal red-light district there, and the "workers" are regulated by the government, so it's all on the up and up. If you have the money, they have the time, as they say."
"You have to! I'm losing all sensation in a place," and here, Lucius' voice dropped even further. "That I can ill-afford to!"
Head thrown back, neck arching, mouth open in what Draco knew was a long, drawn out moan of pleasure. Harry's hands would be in the other man's hair, his hips bucking shamelessly, and his eyes - Draco knew the eyes would be wild and dark.
Harry woke with sticky eyes and a throat that felt like he'd swallowed steel wool; he cleared his throat, a single harsh sound that quickly became a string of racking coughs.
"Of course, you didn't." Blaise shook his head. "No way of knowing. So, Harry goes to Goo Lagoon, huh?"
Which part of them was bird was the subject of much debate, as the younger Weasleys were rather colorful characters, and they enjoyed encouraging speculation amongst circus-goers.
Hermione smiled. "It's been my job for a long time, love. Now, please, enjoy the rest of your vacation, okay?"
"That's him. He makes a hell of a girl, though. Acts like one, too, which isn't saying anything good. He's shallow, selfish, greedy and manipulative. Yet he gets all the business he can handle, the bitch." The younger of the whores shrugged. "He makes the rest of us work harder, just to keep up."
The clubs were crowded, smoky, sticky with sweaty bodies, and in the end all the same, depressingly so. Draco got approached an average of 10 to 12 times an hour and told them all to sod off.
"Do? Nothing: I was just surprised, is all, you know? That it was him, and he didn't recognize me, or string me along if he did. I looked in his eyes, Hermione, and there was nothing there but light, you know? No darkness, no pain. Draco Malfoy, of all people, has no darkness. It just - it shocked me, is all."
Draco had turned to watch Harry, feeling like he was watching a stranger. "I didn't have any plans, really.”
“You think you are right now because you feel guilty, but it won’t last. Without consequences, nothing for you ever does. And in our life so far, there have never been any for all the times you were wrong.”
Wordlessly, he sat down on the damp earth beside Harry and leaned his head on the other’s shoulder, his hand snaking down into Harry’s lap and locking around his. Harry’s fingers tightened on his, and Draco slid his other hand up Harry’s back to his neck, twining in the wet hair.
Leaving the coffee lounge, he was very, very relaxed and thought he just might like to stay around here for a good long while. And since he was now in a frame of mind to, perhaps, engage in some interpersonal communication, he thought he might take a stroll back through the District and see if anyone caught his eye. Or if
The next day dawned clear and bright, and Harry bounced out of bed with a smile on his lips, a song in his heart and wood in his pants. The last one was quickly taken care of and he was washed, dressed and on his way. Today's performance featured him taking another tube trip and he wanted to personally check the gunpowder supply cause that rash was
Still, he wanted to look good, if for no other reason than to show that he wasn't completely lost without Draco, that even outside of a club or work, he could function just fine. He combed his closet for something that bridged the gap between slutty and stuffy, finally deciding on jeans as well, and a long-sleeved blue jersey. He pulled on his faithful leather jacket and left for the Guardian, just a short walk from their flat.
Draco stared at him. When he could find his voice, he rasped "You might have found it more enjoyable had you fucking participated, instead of lying there like a wet towel!"
"Potter," said Draco, shifting to his other foot. "Uhm, sorry about the other night; I was a bit upset, as you can imagine."
Draco didn't even have to think. If he was going to sit down anywhere in Potter's sty, he needed liquid courage. "Got any brandy?"
It was only Blaise's hand on his shoulder, his fingers digging into Draco's skin that kept him from jumping up and doing fuck knew what to the man waxing rhapsodic about Harry - HIS Harry. Pansy looked down at him. "What was his name?"
The portkey was good for 90 minutes, so Harry showered, shaved – it was a special occasion, after all – sent Ginny an owl saying he was on vacation and was positively ecstatic that she wasn't there, and dressed. He grabbed his suitcase, closed his hand around the portkey, and a short, turbulent time later, he was in Amsterdam – in the Prins Hendrikkade, to be exact, where his hotel was located.
"Sorry," Harry mumbled, embarrassed. Across from him, Ginny was smirking and he fought the urge to hex her. And Christ, it was sprinkling rain and she was still wearing those stupid sandals with the heels. He hoped she fell off them, flat on her fat little face.
"You really think so, sir? " Harry was hedging now, because he had no idea what Kingsley was getting at, and suspected the other man didn't either, and they were playing the same game. Harry had had enough sessions with the departmental psychwitch to know when he was walking into a trap. He didn't feel like playing today, though, so he nodded. "I guess you're right. So, am I to assume I'm being forcibly sent on vacation?"
A pale brow shot up, and she laughed disbelievingly. "What do you think? No, I'm a debutante, trying to piss Mummy and Daddy off by being a whore. That will show them, goddammit."
"You'd do me anyway, you slut." But Draco turned to the mirror and nearly passed out cold. His own shoulder-length pale blond hair was a memory - what he had now was far shorter and much darker blond with selective lighter streaks artfully placed here and there, twisted and waxed at strategic points. "Holy shit!”
"Will I?" Harry needed, wanted to be sure that somehow, he had not ruined Draco's life -that had never been his intention. Not ever.
Harry had been about to yell back, "Yes, yes I am," when Draco's face fell and he covered his eyes briefly, before removing his hands from his face. "Oh God, I really, really hope Maggie had backup files, cause otherwise, she's gonna kill me."
"I wasn't planning on being anything but nice." Harry set down his camera on a rickety vanity and let the cat sniff his fingers, then rub against them, then allow him to pet him. Darcy looked surprised.
His attraction to 'Milo' should have flagged, then died a sudden, explosive death when he realized that the man who'd figured prominently in his fantasies for six weeks now was the very same person he'd nearly killed sixth year, and who had returned the favor by saving his ass during a capture at Malfoy Manor. Why, then, was he standing here with Draco, still?
And when Milo was in front of him, and looked down into Harry's eyes, Harry felt a shock like a hex – or more likely a curse – shoot through him.
He rubbed his face with his free hand. "I've looked bloody EVERYWHERE for him; where the hell is he? Where does he GO?"
Pansy punched Blaise rather hard on the arm. "Shut up Blaise. Paul is my stylist and he's gonna make you beautiful." She took his hand and began to tug him towards the door.
Pansy obviously did not want to 'let it go,' but for once she listened to Blaise who made a mental note to write it on his calendar under the heading of "Armageddon - It's Coming."
He made it to the door and pulled it open; he'd forgotten to lock it again. Good thing there were no zombies roaming about, à la Shaun of the Dead, or he'd be toast. He leaned against the door frame. "What want?"
Ginny's wails of frustration and anger were drowned out by the laughter, and a moment later, she was Apparated away.
She – no, he, he had to remember that – sat down and crossed his legs, running a hand through his hair. "So, what do I call you?"
Harry kissed him back briefly, then let his lips still as Draco kissed him. After a moment, Draco pulled back, puzzled. "Hey, kiss me back?"
"No. I won't refuse you." He took a breath, then stepped closer, and Darcy opened the door, allowing him to step inside, and eyed the camera.
"Tell me about it," grumbled the Bearded Lady as she walked by. "More than four times a week too, by my reckoning."
He would set out enthusiastically enough; he was tired of staying put, tired of singing only in a studio, tired of Harry, who annoyed him to no end for almost all of the same reasons he had in school. He would board the tour bus, waving merrily, and a day out, or less, the loneliness would set in and he would become unbearable to everyone around him.
The first performance of the Magical Mystery Tour featuring the Marvelous Malfoys was deemed a rousing success, and the cash flow from that night – including merchandise sales – was impressive. Dumbledore left Minerva clacking away on her ancient calculator like a madwoman, a broad smile on her face and stacks of galleons surrounding her.
After a few more items of business, the meeting broke up, Harry making his escape quickly before Molly could expound on testicular rashes. He suspected that Filch had been fiddling with the gunpowder again and Harry was merely having a bad reaction to it, but one never knew. So he used the ointment and kept quiet.
Draco Malfoy, too, woke around noon, or later – usually much later – squinted against the light, debated getting out of bed, and started his day with an alcoholic drink of some sort and a Parliament, usually lit and dragged upon before he had even crawled out of bed.
Draco pulled back and Harry gave him a small smile and turned his head to look out the window as Draco slid two fingers into him, stretching him. He did arch a bit when those slick fingers pressed down on the rough bump of nerves, and when Draco's cock slid into him, but while he was being thrust into, he stayed inert. He changed position slightly once, and just before Draco climaxed, he turned his head back to meet Draco's cool gray eyes. "You gonna be done soon?"
"That's Draco. He gets whatever he wants, however he wants it; and too fucking bad if it's not what I want too. Nothing matters as long as he gets his." Harry was unconsciously clenching his fist and had to pause and relax his fingers, flexing them.
Off to their left, the Fossors were arguing with Filch, who, amongst his other duties that he performed badly, was also in charge of the lights. "Bloody electric monstrosities," grumbled Dando, the leader. "I don't see why candles, torches, lanterns are not enough."
“I’ve taken a room at the Leaky Cauldron, and I’m going to be staying there a while. Maybe if what you take so for granted isn’t there, you might begin to understand that sorry isn’t always enough.”
Harry was incapable of speaking, and Draco was amused beyond belief, but he managed to say. "Why not just use a sticking charm or a Reparo?"
Draco nodded and stood up, taking a deep breath. Pansy stood too and slid her arms around Draco's waist, hugging him briefly. "Good luck honey."
The rapping continued until, annoyed, Harry shouted, "Sod off!" If it was a friend, they would; if it was some hapless salesperson, they'd not stop rapping; and if it was anyone else? Well, it wouldn't be. No one else bothered with him.
“Severus knew the stone was here, and he figured you were here or off getting drunk but felt you probably weren’t the type to visit graveyards while hammered.”
The old Milo had loved the road; the new Milo tolerated it. The old Milo had bedded any and all of those who caught his fancy; the new one had eyes for one person and one person only.
"You're out of your mind – you do know that, right?" Harry had finished his drink and forced his eyes to meet Draco's. "For caring even a little bit."
The monthly "family council" where such news as new acts or changes to existing ones was, in truth, a business meeting – and more of a dictatorship than an actual democracy – but in the interest of peace, harmony and good will, it was touted as a family affair. The members of the group straggled into the main tent in pairs and alone, each one with an opinion that they were bound and determined to express to someone.
He'd developed a pattern; sleep till noon or better, go out and get a paper, some pastry, and sit in the patisserie for a long while, smoking and watching people go by. Invariably - and it never, ever failed - someone would remind him of Harry and his heart would leap wildly in his chest, but of course, it was not him. The letdown would be intense and Draco would leave the café and go back to his flat and cry. And then wank, and possibly cry more, depending on his mood and how much the person had reminded him of what he'd lost.
"It usually is, especially on Tuesdays for some reason. You'd think later in the week would be worse, but nope.”
“I’ll never grow up and I’ll live here in Neverland forever!” Honestly, the child was woefully undereducated in some of the most important subjects.
Potter hadn't known Milo was Draco – he understood that as soon as knowledge dawned on that still all-too-open face. And he was fairly sure Potter's shock was reflected on his own face, but being a showman, he had recovered and moved on. Now he was back in his dressing room, sitting on the couch and smoking his third of what promised to be many cigarettes this night, more to keep his hands occupied than anything else. He had tried to clutch a drink, but his hand had been shaking, and he had been forced to put it down before anyone noticed.
He was still a bit tired since sleeping had been difficult, he was unwashed, and of course, covered in sticky bun. So of course, the first person he met on his way was Draco Malfoy – who was, also of course, impeccably groomed and dressed neatly in jeans and a tight t-shirt. Harry tried hard not to drool, since drool plus frosting probably formed a bricklike substance.
The sharp intake of breath could have been either a precursor to coming, or a noise born of shock; in this case, it was both. Harry came with a guttural groan, and slumped against the wall, while Darcy expertly swallowed his seed, then pulled back, licking his lips.
Harry. Draco closed his eyes and fought the urge to turn and throw himself on the other man and pin him to the bar; he counted to five and then opened his eyes and made himself turn very casually towards the man beside him. No leather pants or mesh shirt this time, but faded, ripped jeans, so tight as to be nearly obscene and a black fitted t-shirt that clung to every ripple and muscle. Jesus, had he been working out?
Now Darcy raised a brow. "Is that a problem? The way I see it, I have a great body, talented mouth and a hole to stick your dick into, so really, what's the difference between me and a female?"
She made the arrangements swiftly – a sweet check tended to spur people on, Harry had found – and soon he was on his way with a guidebook, a receipt for a room and bath at a nice hotel, and the promise of a portkey at eight AM the next morning. At home, he set about packing, and realized he had nothing to wear that qualified as sexy. Not that he thought the sex workers cared, but maybe it would be nice to not horrify them; he was pretty sure his underwear would be considered a travesty in any country. Maybe he should just shop in Holland.
He moved the clod of dirt carefully to the other hand. "When it became apparent that the fire was started at the back of the Malfoy's tent, and then spread, I looked around at the ground surrounding the tent. Since it had recently rained, there was a fair amount of mud, which allowed for a footprint or two to be left. This is one of those footprints; when dried, the outline, tread and heelprint are easy to see."
He listened intently, and luck was with him; for a change, the deejay actually said the name of the band after the song.
He managed to jam himself into his seat and looked around at the half (or less) clothed bodies around him; he had a sinking feeling the show would swiftly turn into a titty fest, and though he had no objections to breasts in general, he wasn't sure he was down with being hit in the face by bouncing globes of flesh - fore or aft. He downed two more beers and was feeling a welcome little buzz when the opening act came on. They were okay, a Finnish band along the lines of Nightwish, although definite wannabes. But the lead singer was pretty and her corset squeezed her out at both ends, which amused Harry, so he drank another beer – he was making the vendor's night – and watched, waiting for the main event.
The next night, the show was sold out; not only was the show still getting rave reviews, but a certain segment of the population was in it for the potential morbidity of the situation - the general opinion seemed to be that something would happen, since the culprit had not yet been caught … the only question seemed to be what, exactly, it would be.
The leather trousers he could have handled, maybe, but not paired with the net shirt that showed patches of tanned skin throughout, or the studded belt and the boots, the entire outfit accentuated by the short, spiky haircut. It all looked amazing on Harry, but he NEVER dressed like this. EVER. Even if Draco had begged, he wouldn't have, not for him.
"Amazing, yes. Honey, it's late, and not all of us are on vacation. Get some sleep, and try again tomorrow, all right? Love you."
The spotlights shifted and changed colors, the better to shimmer off the tight (and in Charlie's case downright illegal) white satin costumes dotted with gold sequins the family wore. In the wings, Draco privately thought that his father was most likely drooling over the accent crystals, even though sequins were frightfully common.
He lay on the sofa where he had fallen right after he threw his mobile across the room where it hit the fireplace and shattered. He lay there, not even knowing he wept until the tears soaked the pillows when he turned his head; he let them dry into salty, tight tracks on his face. Only the risk of soiling himself and the sofa finally made him move to use the loo; as he passed the window he saw that the sun had set and the streetlights were casting long shadows on the pavement outside their flat.
"Gorgeous." Harry was checking his ass out in the full-length mirror, flexing the cheeks. "I have an amazing ass – maybe I should just walk around backwards in chaps or something."
Paul was nodding. "I can see both sides, myself. You ideally want to be open and honest, but occasionally, you must go another route. And this isn't exactly dishonest - you could change your look for any number of reasons."
"Not the look I'm going for anymore," said Harry, tossing his jacket on a chair. "Sorry to be brief, but I need to get ready." He moved past Draco without touching him and up the stairs. His stomach felt tight but he ignored it and began to get dressed.
He surveyed the crowd, then reached into the bag, pulling out what looked like – and was – a clump of dried mud. "The first incident was the intentional torching of the Malfoy living tent, which resulted in the mostly unintentional destruction of the main performance tent as well." Harry paused, letting the phrase "mostly unintentional" sink in. "Now, since magical means were used to create the fire, normally there would be very little, if any, evidence present unless one could somehow trace the wand's magical signature. This manner of identification is only truly viable if one can be at the scene within five minutes of the spell being cast, and of course, due to the pandemonium, no one was able to discern the initial site of the fire till later."
Hermione's expression changed, became thoughtful, and then she sighed and shook her head. "You'd left England for training in the US by the time this happened, and it probably slipped by you, afterwards, but Draco, along with Greg Goyle and a few others, were part of a Ministry experiment, I guess you'd call it."
Pansy watched him; he looked good, he looked calm, but she knew him well and knew that the tension lurked just under the surface. She was sure that if she reached out and touched him, his skin would literally thrum under her fingertips.
Draco almost didn't take the hand, not trusting himself to touch the other man, but he made himself do so. Harry's hand was warm and gave him the same electric flash/tingle it always had. He shook it briefly. "I'm Aaron," he said, having decided that sounded like a decent-enough Muggle name. "It's nice to meet you."
As the crowd dispersed, he watched Charlie lead a somber Lucius away and could only hope that a night of debauchery and scanty lingerie were in the offering, because his son's narrow escape from Death had apparently affected him more than Harry would have thought. Charlie, too, looked serious, but wouldn't for long; it wasn't in his nature.
As the rest of the performers seemed to freeze in horror – Harry included –  Hagrid tried frantically to head the beast off with a red cloak, matador-style as Percy hid behind a post. At what seemed to be the last possible moment, Dumbledore raised his wand. "Petrificus Totallus!"
"Just following the advice of the greatest drunken fictional Wizarding detective of all time; I'm keeping my new friend close, and my enemies look pretty damn stupefied to me."
The lights went out – except for a thin purple beam of light that shot down from the ceiling and slowly grew to bathe the stage in colors that shimmered and separated into drops, puddling around the feet of a lone figure.
He spotted Aaron walking down the street from the other direction and wondered briefly where the other man lived. They reached the door at nearly the same time and gave each other a warm smile.
“You’ve had so many of those, Draco - so, so many. I don’t know what it will take, but right now I need some time for me. I’ve lost myself in you now for years and I’m not even sure I know who I am when I’m not with you. I need to know.”
“Oh! I'm Harry. Harry Potter. I work at The Magical Mystery Tour, and I was out here waiting for you. I'm sure Dumbledore will want to see you, so I can take you there and then take your luggage to the guest tent."
"Harry," Ginny started, shoving half the bun in her mouth and chewing noisily, "You know that we were destined to be together. I told you that months, if not years ago. It's been decided! So what were you thinking, drooling over a, a…boy last night?"
Draco listened, rubbing his forehead. "I don't know. I really don't. Everything you've said is true and I have no good answer. I'm an asshole and I know it; I'm a pain, I'm a snob, I'm demanding and exacting and spoiled bloody rotten. But Harry knew all this and still loved me." He shook his head. Talking about it in the past tense was only gonna make him cry again and he'd wind up with tracks of eyeliner streaked down his face. He took a deep breath. "Where do we start?"
The number scrolled by in the call log,  but Harry wasn't even registering it any more. He shut the mobile off and flipped it shut, setting it down where it had been.
Darcy stopped, then slid the strap back up. "You're an odd boy, but fine, whatever you want. It's your wallet." He looked at Harry. "So, what do you want me to do?"
"I have been, I've been frantic, called everyone you know and we know and just, fuck. I've missed you." Draco came over and ran his hand over Harry's hair, threading his fingers through the long, thick locks before crushing his lips against Harry's.
Pansy helped him up; his legs felt weak, but something else was breaking through now as well - anger. Goddamn Potter, how fucking dare he go dancing with other guys, or let them buy him drinks or fuck knew what else?
Draco pulled Potter's jacket around him tighter and breathed in the scent of it again, and then again. Potter had worn this tonight, and many other nights before it, and bits and pieces of the magic Potter had discarded still clung to it; Draco could almost swear that he could see the particles lighting the dark like fireflies.
The only thing that would be enough, in the end, was he, himself, being able to open up and show Harry how much he truly did love him.
"Could be," Charlie replied cheerfully. "But it's not like you are 'reading' those magazines either."
"Don't know; he said no names were necessary. And he can dance! I mean, I can dance, but he's amazing."
Draco pushed his tongue against those lips, which opened for him, slack, while Draco slid his tongue around Harry's mouth; his breath was scotch and cigarettes, and tasted nothing like the Harry he knew.
"Or he might be touched at all the trouble you went to - look, honey, nothing else is working. He's left him notes, mobile messages, tried to talk face to face," she was addressing Paul now. "And nothing works. This way, at least, Draco could get close to him and see what's going on in his head and where he's at." She shrugged. "I hate seeing my boy sad."
“I’m sure – most people still are. They can’t believe you put up with me.” He paused. “Hell, I can’t believe you put up with me.”
"No, no, no, you moron! If Draco goes to one of those places, finds Potter, all he'll do is make it worse! Especially if he
Adams sighed, the same sigh as Kingsley had emitted, and for that matter, the same sigh he got from Hermione, Ginny and even Ron. It was the "Harry, please get a CAT-scan" sigh, and he was tired of it. Maybe a vacation really would do him good.
"Just - just try to go in with an open mind, and heart, if you can, and listen to him. You're an excellent listener. I suspect that you might be surprised by what he has to say."
Sometimes he substituted a pill or tab of something for his customary shot of alcohol – didn't every musician? Oh, but he was not a musician, no. He was a Rock Star, and nobody had better forget it. Musicians could play instruments, compose and read notes on a staff, craft melody and pretty words; Draco's sole job was to alternately scream or croon lyrics into a headset or standing microphone, while swaying and writhing on stage, locking smoldering eyes with some young thing, and signing autographs. That was his job, and he did it so damn well that his complete lack of congeniality was tolerated – even rewarded.
"Yeah, I do; I've never been much of a dancer, but I've found I like it, surprisingly. No one I know would believe it." Harry smiled and took a sip of his own drink, sighing and pushing a few stray strands of hair back. "Do you like to?"
"Who?" Draco looked up at him and for once, didn't argue the point. Harry shook his head. "You'll know if I'm right in a few minutes."
Harry smiled a bit at that. "Sounds like Dra…" he stopped, then pushed past the surge of feeling the name crossing his lips brought him. "Draco. He likes to just lay there on the bed or the floor or couch and watch the lights play over different shapes and textures."
"Oh well then, throw the bastard out by all means, since he had the temerity to cut his hair! Damn him all to hell." Blaise tried hard not to laugh and Pansy smirked. Draco scowled.
After a long day of investigation, which included, variously, hiding behind the animal cages to eavesdrop on Hagrid and Percy – and purely by accident, Harry swore – getting sprayed with newt repellent, which made even Draco's hair wilt; stalking the clowns and finding out far, far too much about what Dando did with the Bearded Lady after hours; and helping the Pincushion make himself a human shish-kabob, they finally paused near Trelawney's tent to sit down.
The lights, as always, dimmed and condensed until a single ray of white light fell on Draco and Lucius as they began to twist and sway to their signature music. The audience was spellbound as they moved sinuously, nearly slithering around and over each other, until they were entwined in a human knot that had people gasping at the sheer flexibility of the human body. Holding this particular pose was tricky, and it frankly hurt, even when one was that limber, and as Draco flexed into his gravity-defying backbend, the audience applauded. Draco smiled and started to twist to stand upright – but couldn't move.
Harry looked at his watch – it was time to go. Deciding that he didn't trust the tube, tonight of all nights, he splurged on a cab and made his way to Underworld.
Draco had no idea what that was, but figured it was some Muggle thing, because this WAS a Muggle club after all. "Does it, to you? Tastes like cordials or something to me."
"Gray? That will stand out like a motherfucker." Draco felt his native sarcasm returning, and it was rather cheering, given the circumstances.
"I'm sure you could - can, I mean." He rubbed the back of his neck and felt the need to make casual conversation – Merlin knew why, because he was absolute rubbish at it.
He stared at the picture of Draco Malfoy; Draco the Dragon with his perfectly straight, perfectly groomed blond hair, with those grey eyes that always looked disdainful, with those lips that looked made for kissing and biting and licking and all manner of other good things. A moment later, his blankets sprang up with alacrity and Harry glanced down. Hello there!
But when Harry came home, Draco might be in the shower. Or worse yet, on the computer; Harry hated that he couldn't bring himself to believe that Draco had stopped with the ring-up boys, and whenever he saw him sitting there with his planner and his mobile beside him, hurt and distrust would well up in him and he would go and change and leave the flat, desperate to make his mind just stop.
