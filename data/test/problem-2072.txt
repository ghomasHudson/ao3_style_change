“It’ll be all right,” he whispers next to her ear. “We can handle ourselves; we handle ourselves all the time alone on patrol.” He pulls back to look her in the eye. “And if we don’t come back in a reasonable amount of time, feel free to come get us.”
“Well . . . now what,
His own hand clenches into a fist. He breathes in and out five times, then renews his focus on the manacles.
Harry stands out on the balcony overlooking the local park, glass of champagne dangling from his electrically charged fingertips. He came out for some fresh air, the party below getting too stuffy for him. Handling crowds of people for long periods of time has never been his strong suit. Though, seeing all the happy heroes—Ron dancing with Hermione, Luna and Ginny snogging in a corner, and Cho giggling with Lavender, Parvati, and Padma—reminds Harry of how far they've come since worrying over the threat posed by the Villain Agency.
“Fuck
Harry blinks and suffers from an immediate lightheadedness. He doesn’t think that he sways. But he must have, for Dracon steadies him.
Their best at security.
Nurse Moody glances over Harry with his good eye and grunts. “And just who is he here to see?”
“Convenient, isn’t it? Having an obvious physical marker of guilt. Most evil doesn’t even show on a person until they are in the act of committing it, and, after, it submerges itself again.”
“Okay, come on.” As Harry grabs Ron’s arm and pulls him in the direction of the Palace, he reflects on how grateful he is for those two electrical blasts helping him finish warming up and taking the dull sting of the electricity thrumming through him away. Now the currents have taken hold and are flowing freely through him.
Hermione shoots a glare towards Ron. “I’ve been thinking—if the Villain Agency keeps up its tactic of picking off the older heroes, would they really need to steal our identities in the end? Think about it. If all the people who are left to defend London and the rest of Britain are the younger heroes, defeating us should be much easier for them. Compared to the older heroes, we’re much less experienced when it comes to using our powers, and there would be less of us out there to stand against the might of the entire Villain Agency—new and old villains.”
Lord, he’s so tired he can’t think straight. By the sound of Ron’s laboured breathing next to him, Harry’s willing to bet he’s just as exhausted. They can’t deal with two more Supervillains. But running away would leave them too vulnerable.
“Er, yeah, kind of.”
“. . . You’d make me really
The top edge of Vice-Net’s silver, identification mask is just beginning to come into view from where’s he’s crouched down when the unmistakable
, as I was saying, breaking into a federal building and causing harm and damage there is much more serious a crime than anything I know you’ve done in the past.”
“Well, do you want to go?”
. No.”
You could’ve done
Harry pulls away.
“Right. So—” Draco holds out the crook of his arm to Potter. “Side-Along with me?”
“But, you found out?”
The pillow hits Harry in the face and knocks his glasses to the floor. “Hey!”
Harry blinks, stunned. After he recovers, he runs out after Paper Dracon, determined to “return” the gift right now.
Harry’s electrical flow seems to short circuit a second before it comes back full force as he rises to his feet. “Just what are you insinuating, Cho?!”
“Or worse,” Ron says, “that heroes have already been targeted.”
“What the . . . ?” Dracon mutters.
Four things happen once this connection is established. The first is the sense that the mechanical arm is taking advantage of the energy Harry has offered it by the weird tugging sensation shooting down his own arm, as though the piece of tech is sucking at his electricity. The second is the way its two attached fingers flex as though grabbing at the air while it twitches at the wrist and elbow, the wiring lighting up like Harry’s scars. Third are the shouts happening around Harry at the very edges of his senses. But it’s really the fourth thing that holds fast Harry’s attention.
“You can have some time to think it over the next few days. I won’t rush you on it.” Draco re-brandishes the paperwork he brought with him (consent forms, advice pamphlets, and so on) and makes a show of placing it on the floor before retreating through the attic trapdoor.
“Harry, please tell me you didn’t try to force him to go get medical help with you.”
Ron keeps his position leaning against the wall.
Potter breathes in deep and shakes against Draco. His free hand fists the front of Draco’s robes. “I don’t—I don’t want to.”
With a put-upon sigh, Draco takes out his wand and transfigures a nearby broken cobblestone into a pair of shades. “Here, Potter. If you don’t want to be recognised being out and about with me so badly, you might want to try these. Bumble and stumble about like that in Diagon Alley, and folks are sure to know it’s you.”
Dracon’s hands are going wild now in furious motion.
“I’m fine walking to my own house!” Her finger jabs at his chest. “It’s only next door. I’m not that old yet.”
“That’s an older villain, isn’t he?” Ron asks. “Sounds more likely that Paper Dracon was the accomplice in the situation.”
And Draco can feel a wetness against his neck, though he’s certain it’s not blood. He lifts his free hand and lays it gently against Potter’s shuddering back. “I know. And now you do too.”
“Oh, Harry!”
Clenching his teeth, he braces himself and then rises above the pew as well. With perhaps more force than necessary, he rips the electricity from one of the flat-screens hanging on the upper walls and strikes
“Pass.”
With caution, Draco says, “Potter?”
Small embers dot one of Fire’s sleeves as he beckons to his comrades. “C’mon! More heroes are on the way!”
“Did you really almost head out and search for me?”
The two of them stay there like that, facing one another on opposite sides of the same crate until Harry’s legs start to ache. Finally, Paper Dracon turns away and sits down, legs dangling over the side of the container at the knees.
Glancing around him, Harry spots smaller stacks of crates. He nods to himself as he walks over to the smallest one, climbs up, and leaps to the next highest. Once Harry makes it to a stack that’s even with Dracon, he jumps over the stacks until he lands on the crate where the villain stands.
“Think I fig-ured it out,” Draco says. Knowing he needs to be careful with his words here, he stuffs his free hand in his robe pocket, grasps his wand, and quickly whispers a sloppy Sobering Charm. It does the trick to take the edge off his haze. He blinks at Potter with clearer eyes. “Who—or rather, the
“I send you a paper swan to give you a lift, and you go and destroy it?” Paper Dracon calls from above. “Fine. Find your own way up, then.”
“Uh . . . . Should we get it for him?” GarGoyle asks.
In the loo, they lock themselves in after checking that it’s empty. Then they strip off their outer clothes, consisting of jackets, jeans, and hoodies, revealing their Supersuits underneath—Ron’s orange and black spandex, and Harry’s red and gold.
He can’t handle hearing that much controlled despair in Potter’s voice. “Maybe—maybe he is. Remember when we suggested Polyjuice? That might be viable... Do you want to stay for the round of questioning from the Aurors so you know? Maybe there’ll be something recognisable.”
She doesn’t take his hand, so Harry lets it swing back down by his side. Together they walk out into the corridor where Harry hands her the note.
................................................
All of the older heroes have had to deal with their identities being stolen. For Harry to put his on the line for this mission? Not ideal, but a risk he’s willing to take to rescue the missing heroes and Dracon.
Just as suddenly as the panicked feeling came, it flees him. Harry gasps for breath. He has a vague sense of the other people around him doing the same.
He rolls back on his heels, a choked noise coming from his throat. Swiftly, Dracon stands back up and walks back to his previous perch.
Harry decides to try a different tactic. “Come on, I know it doesn’t have to be this way. You may have been raised into it, but you weren’t born evil. No one is.”
When Mrs. Figg answers the door, she has curlers in her greying hair. “You’re back.”
He’s out of the alleyway and handing back the handbag to the woman when he hears Dracon loudly swearing. The woman eyes Harry’s smirk and asks what that’s about. He tells her “nothing to worry about” and encourages her to enjoy the rest of her evening.
Their voices drop to a point that not even Harry can hear. Still, after a few more minutes of them whispering, Harry decides to clear his throat.
Harry melted inside and could only wonder what soft expression was showing on his face just then. “That’s okay too. Let’s make it a game to remember, yeah?”
Dracon must have noticed the way Harry whipped around—which means he took off the coat covering his head.
“Anyone can be a hero, if they work for it.” Harry crosses his arms before himself. “You wanted to know what you could do that wouldn’t waste your combat skills.”
Draco shields a grimace. With Potter’s sickly complexion, he couldn’t pick up any usual hints of Potter’s discomfort. Who really knows besides Potter how long he’s stuck it out, being reminded of his own horrible experience?
“Thank you.” She crouched down at the spot and caressed the grass like it was Draco’s hair. “I know you enough to know you’re here because his death doesn’t sit right with you, that, despite your differences, his murder is haunting your conscience. That you too would stop at nothing to see justice done.”
Still, it’s not quite enough to tamp down his guilt at the yelp Dracon makes.
Harry coughs into his fist. “Yeah?”
Hermione and Ron face off against
“It’s a little scary, losing what I’ve come to know and appreciate. And to trade it in for something so dark and unknown and, perhaps, terrible is frightening.” Harry shivered. “But that’s what’s so good about having you here with me. I won’t be alone and you won’t be alone. So whatever uncertain fate awaits us from beyond the Veil, we can face it together, yeah?”
Alastor Moody grunts. “Power all the way down, lad.”
“And that’s when you collapsed?”
He allows himself a few more seconds to collect his thoughts and composure before sliding the key into the lock and stepping through the door.
Potter meets him on Christmas Eve at the place designated on his missive. Just like before, he’s bundled from head to toe.
With the tips of his gloved fingers from both hands, Harry delicately lifts the mask from the ground. When the mask doesn’t shatter in his hands, he shifts it entirely to his left hand to hold. He then proceeds to stride up to Dracon, earlier tiredness nearly forgotten in his limbs.
“Not before your first shock!”
Dracon gives a nervous smile and says, “Hi. I’m Draco Malfoy, and it’s a pleasure to know you.” Then he stands up again and takes a step towards Harry. “Now, I’m going to give you a parting gift, hero. You can accept it if you want it or turn it away if you don’t. And if you like it enough, when you next see me, you can give it in return.”
The hope in Cho’s voice makes Harry want to say
Yeah, he knows how breathtaking the whole sight is the first time around. After all, he first managed the full effect in front of a full-body mirror a week before his fourteenth birthday. Yet, Harry can only imagine the effect of seeing it in muted darkness.
“Mr. Park,” Draco says, “Do you plan to have some of that Kimchi with your daughter on Wednesday?”
When she attempts to ask him a flurry of follow-up questions, Harry flips the note over so that it reads:
He feels a tug on the back of his uniform.
“Yes!”
Harry and Ron turn to see
But it’s not—how can it be when Potter’s hands feel so
Potter seems to still at that, and Draco can feel that familiar, piercing green gaze on him even if he can’t really see it. It’s powerful enough that gooseflesh rises up his arms and shivers run down his back, and Draco’s very nearly sent back in time to stone walls and floating candles and Potter’s wand at his throat.
“Oh, you haven’t heard yet?”
“Why don’t you just use your Control over Bodies to rip the answer from my mind?” The ragged voice sounds like Paper Dracon’s drawl.
The giant paper snake slithers the rest of the way up the stairs and curls around Voldemort, blocking his path in any direction. Hovering over the Supervillain, at Dracon’s orchestration from down below, the snake opens its mouth to reveal sharp paper fangs. Although its hiss is silent, the snake’s threat still makes Harry shudder a little from where he sits.
Continuing his casual stroll, Harry exits the dining hall and enters into the main corridor.
“Yeah. The next wave of attacks came mostly from the machine while he tried to block. Must have also got him in the eye since he cried out and brought a hand up to the mask. Actually, the robot had to have been aiming for his head, considering that’s where most of the new tears appeared.”
“Bloody brilliant,” Ron said. “Guess that means we’re walking, then.”
“What? They didn’t mention to you that thing activates when someone uses their power? I thought you had a plan?”
he recognizes immediately.
“Oh,” Harry says, a flash of embarrassment coursing through him. “I only knew your name because you were conscious at the time I rescued you. The others? Not so much.”
Harry thanks Mrs. Weasley, retrieves the keys from the loo, and heads into the basement.
Harry opens his mouth to retort when Paper Dracon’s fingers reciprocate Harry’s death grip and yank Harry up. Their masks are barely a millimeter apart; for a few hazy seconds, Harry thinks Dracon is about to kiss him.
Choosing which articles of clothing to wear in his costume’s stead had proven to be a half hour feat. At first, Harry’d debated just wearing plain clothes but knew he’d never be allowed into the places he was going today if he appeared as a civilian. His accessibility even as a Superhero had its doubts. Plus, his image as a professional who took his job seriously would be put into question.
,” Nurse Tonks says.
“Like what?”
Harry squints at him, and says, “you’re not plotting something nefarious, are you?”
He starts to tug Harry in the direction of another crate pile when Harry digs in his heels. “What—?”
. Time to give our guest a break.”
“As I understand it,” she stalked closer, “you were the one who found his remains here?”
The comforting section of the conversation had been going well after that until Hermione asked whether Harry had reported that Malfoy was no longer missing but dead.
Just one more circuit around the last section of London, and he might make it home by ten to eat Mrs. Weasley’s delicious cooking. Sure, it’s a little early for him on a Friday when crime’s busiest, and he doesn’t have to worry about waking up the next day with assignments due for classes. But he wouldn’t mind having a soak in the tub for his sore thigh—after all, a guy working this hard has got to treat himself right sometime.
“For the most part, it was pretty dark in that room—but after the explosion, I caught a good look at one of them.”
Ron still has his hand trained on GarGoyle, even as the villain and Paper Dracon descend from the rooftop on a large paper swan.
Hands behind his back, Harry strolls casually back into the alley, whistling some show tune that pops into his head. When he stands a meter or two from Dracon, he stops as though startled. “Paper Dracon! You’re still here?!”
. Don’t be a stranger!” Tonks calls at his back.
“You’re
Potter looks over at Draco, alarmed.
He cuts off as Harry crouches down to his level and holds out the mask. It feels thinner in his hand than it does under his foot, and Harry notes a crack that threatens to take off the left horn.
“Sorry,” he mumbles as he slinks his way to the armchair opposite Draco.
“Well, I mean, I first was having doubts when I thought over Dracon’s injuries. Like how he got them, and why he was left in a ditch in an abandoned part of town. One of the theories I had was that he’d received them fighting with another villain since the attacker didn’t bring him in to the police.”
Draco knows. Otherwise, Potter’s eyes would be that sharp red warning of death.
“I can. That is the trade-mark of the Villain Agency, after all.”
Paper Dracon laughs in that wicked way that worms its way under Harry’s skin. “What? That’s all? Your big idea after torturing the rendezvous point out of Blaizing Fire is to just
“I’m sorry about his death too. And that you’ll both be trapped in a place that’s caused you so much pain.” At Harry’s startled look, she said, “Oh, please, Harry. You know I’m fully aware that you’re not going to leave him alone in there. Just, promise me you’ll sleep in your own bed at night and come back for the daytime?”
Harry blinks behind his mask. He had fully anticipated being told to piss off.
Ron rounded on Draco. “What did you do? Where are we? I swear, if this has all been some kind of trick to hurt Harry...!”
“Eh-heh-heh.” He uses his free hand to rub at the back of his head. “It’s just . . . . The first time I ever saw you was when I was roughly ten. I was riding a bus with my . . . aunt, uncle, and cousin. It had turned over after a villain dodged an attack from Ced, and the rock struck its side. I don’t remember who you were fighting, but I do recall clearly, you helping everyone climb out safely, even though your powerset would have been better off aiding Ced in the fight.” Harry closes his eyes as he pictures it. “There . . . . there was a gas leak, wasn’t there? That’s why you had to get everyone out? In case it caught fire and exploded.”
“Well, Mrs. Figg?” Harry asks, gripping her sleeve in case she falls over, “Would you have given your nephew the boat? If not to keep, maybe to use for a bit?”
“You know, right? Just listening to him...” Potter leans against one of the walls and sinks down to the floor. “My vampire—I never told you, maybe because I was ashamed, maybe because you wouldn’t believe me, I don’t know. My vampire was a woman too.”
again. “We only knew it had been the right one because the doors closed behind us, and metal grating fell down to cover the windows." She wraps her arms around herself. "It was so dark. Only multiple pairs of red lights greeted us. I tried using my powers to yank water in from outside or to bust down the doors, but it was as if we were insulated.” Her chest rises and falls with a shaky breath. “My ability was useless, and Ced had been relying on me since it’s a rarity to find earth at the docks.”
says as he places a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “We knew some heroes had responded to the situation. Seeing as it was a Supervillain attack, the emergency vehicles had thought it best to leave the fight to those that could match the enemy’s power. Instead, they hung back, and formed a wide perimeter around the outskirts of the Palace to intercept any of the people who managed to flee or were freed by the heroes who took action.”
Harry does not yield until they promise that after one round with him, they will clean up and head back home to their families—and “no more playing in the street.” He knows they won’t keep that last one for more than a day, but a day, just like a single round, is better than nothing.
Harry jolts upright on the couch, adrenaline spiking in his veins. He had forgotten about the odd lettering he had seen on the arm before passing out.
“Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what you said. How Justin’s not been able to really use his power since the incident and that the Villain Agency’s likely behind it.”
Shadows shift on Potter’s face as he winces, a small fang flashing in the candlelight, and Draco can feel his face reflecting the expression back. “Invited them into my flat. Turned my back to get the drinks. Was pinned to a wall. Stomach to wall; hands on my hands, fangs—” Potter’s hand presses to the left side of his neck as though stemming the flow from an open wound.
“Or desperate.” Blaizing Fire’s tone takes on that wicked lilt that Harry so associates with Paper Dracon that Harry just blinks beneath his mask’s tinted lenses, hand with the cards stalled.
Cho jabs her pointer finger in Harry’s direction. “That still doesn’t make sense. He barely had reason to trust you to help his wound, but then he lets you
; we should try to talk to the witnesses again. Unless . . . the police gave us what information they have on the arm already?”
“So they’ve been working on those things for that long,” Ron muses.
Ron just winces in sympathy.
Visibly wincing for Ron and Hermione, Harry shakes his head.
Curiously, his fingers catch on something pinned beneath the knot of his mask. Grabbing it between his pointer and thumb, he brings a scrap of paper in front of his face. He unfolds it and sees two words scorched into it in fancy handwriting:
Finding nothing in the first alleyway, Harry continues to follow the tape to the back of the building which also turns up empty of clues. Feeling much less certain about his method, Harry enters the alleyway on the opposite side of the building.
“Then how did you—”
Throughout this process, Paper Dracon has been directing from the bottom of the staircase. Even now, his hands still hover like a maestro. When all the color has faded from his giant serpent, Dracon waves his hands away from one another like the movement of arms in the Breaststroke.
’s powers!”
“They’re up there, aren’t they?” Mr. Hendricks lifts his blue eyes to the one-way glass. “The person who ‘identified’ me?”
A few weeks later, Draco feels he could fly without a broom.
. His eyes dart toward Alpha Bee behind his lenses. The old Superhero’s shoulders are hunched, and his hands are held behind his back. Harry shifts his eyes back toward Cho.
~~*~~
. “Only that I—”
injury—one that wasn’t from that night I found him. A broken leg—”
“Can’t be doing a good job of it if you think I’m—” He leaves a pregnant pause in the air “—
—spread misery, not joy.”
Alpha Bee hums in thought. “Go on.”
The sun is just setting over the horizon, bringing about that lovely time of day Harry enjoys most.
“Well, are you going to keep standing there, or are you coming up?”
“Let me guess,” Ron says. “From the hostages kicking his ass?”
His eyes dart over the piece of machinery, begging for answers. Pressing his gloved hand against the glass, an idea strikes him as he stares at the electrical current running in its lightning pattern along his gloved hand. Carefully, he slides that hand down until it presses against the table surface and not the glass. Then, Harry shoots little bursts of electricity through the crack where the glass meets the table.
me. Hence Weasley’s less than exuberant reaction to my showing up on their doorstep.”
Seeming to shake himself, Alpha Bee strides forward and clasps Harry by the shoulders. “My boy, I’m delighted you’re back with us. You certainly had everyone deeply concerned. I hope you’ve alleviated
Through a determined effort, Harry’s hands don’t falter. “I was only asking. You’re not obligated to answer.”
“Terrible. What did you hit me with?”
“What would a new villain have told us? We already have one, and we barely got anything out of him. Another one would have just been a complication. Or another reason for the Villain Agency to start picking off our hero—”
“And your department
“Well, I remember being tied up. I think Ernie, Hannah, and the other few people with us were tied up too.”
Honestly, what had he been thinking? He’d been working up the nerve to confront Potter since the start of term; how could Draco have expected anything to be different a day before Winter Hols start?
Perhaps in his foolish hurry, Harry had forgotten to throw some spells at the floor or was in denial that Malfoy was a ghost now and didn’t need a door. Either way, the result was the same: Malfoy whispering “Potter” from behind Harry, and Harry nearly vacating his body.
“Er, right.” Harry tugs at the thin piece of his mask that runs along the part of the back of his neck where his hair starts on his head and tries not to wonder what the hell he thinks he’s doing having such a casual conversation with an enemy. “I suppose a lot of it pertains to protecting people, helping them out where we can. And, I guess the joy we often get in return from the people we’ve saved goes a long way in bringing us back to help again and again.”
As much as Harry wants to bust down the door, he knows he stands no chance against two professional Supervillains. His goal is to figure out a way to get Dracon out alive, not get the both of them killed.
“I know!” Hermione’s voice sounds further away than it should. Suddenly, both the fog and smoke blow away with a harsh wind.
The villain straightens the best he can before Harry with his broken leg. “So, he was captured, then?”
looks like. Not that I’d know! I can’t—my reflection—”
had meant to turn me or just off me. I—there was a lot of blood everywhere. So, I came here.”
Mrs. Figg has supposedly moved her boat, and where to?”
“Plan ahead? How could I know he’d be unreasonable about getting his wounds seen to?  I had half a mind to drag him off to a clinic if I had to!”
“I dunno. It’s got a great ring to it,
to look up to and something to strive towards. And keeping track of all your adventures, it really made me want to become a hero—which is odd, considering I should probably have been inspired by my parents. But it’s hard to be inspired by people you don’t truly know and feel like you should. Too many complicated emotions there.”
Harry has a nice cut of his own on his right arm and can feel at least one broken rib from the car’s point of impact. “Bloody brilliant.”
Justin sucks his lips into his mouth while he thinks. “I believe . . . there were . . . two? Masked fellows in the room.”
Looking across the gap to where the villains remain oblivious, Harry takes in a deep breath, and brings his hand down. Like a sorcerer casting a spell, lightning races down from the sky and strikes the rooftop the villains occupy. Electrical bursts scatter across the entirety of the rooftop and dance down the sides of the building.
“I don’t think it’s wise to—”
Letting the electric whip disperse, Harry’s about to bolt for the door when he remembers he had just gotten that lock undone.  No way in hell he’d leave without accomplishing
Harry bites his lip. If that'd been the case, then Dracon could've easily collapsed again after fleeing from Harry. He could be dead right now.
The Supervillain collapses to his knees with the blow just as Paper Dracon gasps for breath.
flings an open pair of scissors at them as they enter. They find two Members of Parliament and a guard there.
Reflecting on the frustrations from the whole evening as he leaves the burning flats to the authorities, Harry feels irritation coursing in his veins alongside his electricity.
Dracon grumbles a bit, and the way his shoulders roll forward warn Harry he’s starting to clam up again.
The Snake looks as though its scales are peeling at first, before the entire creature comes apart in a flurry of paper. The parts that had been ruined by the water remain on the floor. But these new creatures surround Voldemort in a furious tornado.
—” Alastor Moody starts.
The dread curdling in his lower region disperses. “Oh. Good. Ah—er—I mean . . . then why—?”
would have to take up with the police.
“As you tend to do.”
He doesn’t even blink. “A warning.” After a moment of silence, he continues, “I doubt it was a threat considering the Villains stealing the identities was threat enough. But they haven’t done anything with them since. Though, it’s a little odd for them to give away the fact that they’re testing the waters right now.”
Right. He’s dressed as a Supervillain now. Not an unmasked civilian. Of course the captured Superheroes would be distressed to see him. As much as he’d like to reassure all the prisoners that they don’t have to fear him, he’s all too aware there may be listening devices planted along the walls—perhaps the other reason for Fire speaking so vaguely to him and having Harry continue to write his words down. Additionally, it’s too dark in here for them to see any note he’d write . . . .
“I-I better go after her. Let her know I didn’t mean anything by it.” Harry has to wait a minute before his hands stay steady enough to grasp the door handle.
She brings him into the sitting room, cats crawling on every piece of furniture. Mrs. Figg hefts one off a stuffed chair and waves her hands for Harry to sit.
“I'd been incautious—reckless in my behavior and ignorant to the consequences.” Despite her attempts to approach the subject from a subjective, analytical standpoint, emotion still creeps into her voice. “Riding high on a successful early career with my partner, I felt like nothing—no obstacle, no villain—could stop either of us. We were soaring high above all expectations. So, when—
“I honestly don’t know.”
“Why do you work in a job you hate?”
s, as well as planned the abductions of heroes and regular folks with powers, get life in prison.
“I don’t know what game you’re playing at but—”
The policeman stops when he spots Harry. “You.”
“Hmm, yeah, definitely doesn’t seem to be his kind of style.”
and a few other heroes had shepherded villains and suspects detained by the Order out of the burning building. Most of the detainees had been sent to law enforcement since headquarters had been thoroughly thrashed.
“And you’re saying they could figure out his limits just from his file?”
“Yeah, I was getting to that. I was just thinking of how to word it, since I’ve only really come to understand it recently myself.” Harry takes a long breath in through his nose and slowly releases it. “So, like
Harry grimaces a little as Alpha Bee passes along the corridor. What if his ‘best’ is inadequate?
He takes pressure off the hand under his foot, and it gets whisked from underneath him. Replacing his foot atop the mask, Harry watches as the villain cradles the hand close to his chest. Now that he’s this near, Harry can hear the ragged, stuttered breaths coming from the villain.
“Sorry, one more time.”
The Thatcher statue is shifting around to face Ron again, while Vice-Net prepares another barrage of attacks, and, to top it off,
“What?” Paper Dracon’s head jolts up.
“Go on. Bite me like you want to.”
It still hurts for Harry to move, for Harry to think. He wonders if Paper Dracon knows this and what the villain would do to him if he does. Even as the sensible part of Harry’s brain begins to panic, another part shoves a thought to the forefront. “Say, if you’re no good in the rain, why are you here?”
At the sudden sound of footsteps approaching the door, Harry only has time to back up enough to stand beside the trolley and remember himself.
Harry blinks and stares at the hand a moment, then turns his face away. “No way in hell.”
?” Harry prompts Dracon while he changes into the costume left in the bushes.
When they finally pull back from one another, Potter’s hand is still buried in Draco’s hair, and Draco’s hand has found a way inside Potter’s robes to rub his back. Both pant heavily in the space between.
“Yeah,
A part of Harry wants to stay and argue, but time is short. Plus, he’s already trusted Fire’s judgement more than once. He’ll have to trust the guy can take care of himself. Nodding once, Harry pockets the notepad and pen, and he heads out the door.
Harry walks around the room, gaze wandering from one bare wall to the next, looking for clues—anything at all. The drawers are barren, and the space beneath the bed is bare. His hands run over the musty sheets and feels the pillow—nothing. He stares minutely up at the ceiling and counts the cracks—four.
“Keep me updated.” He says it even though he knows they will. They have been for the last few days.
He impressively suppresses the urge to flip Ron the bird.
Mr. Park hesitates in the doorway when he’s ushered inside and keeps his eyes cast down as he shuffles over to Draco. When it seems apparent Mr. Park is having trouble finding the courage to lift his head and view the line-up, Draco pats his arm reassuringly.
His bird’s eye view gives him the advantage of being able to see most of the individuals out on the battlefield, as well as not having the people fighting backlit from the fire. He counts more heroes out fighting than when he could only rely on identifying their powers, but the villains still outnumber them a good three to one.
Harry freezes.
Falling back to the ground hurt, but Harry is getting used to ignoring the pain. “What’s happening down there?” he asks Paper Dracon’s back.
Harry looks up towards the second level, but he’s not at a great angle. The light’s too blinding where it streams in from the hole in the ceiling for him to see properly up towards the roof.
Several emotions cross her face, and Harry can’t pin one of them down.
At Voldemort’s summoning, Prancing Peacock shuffles over in the most demure and subservient stance Harry had ever seen him take, head held low.
Turning to look at the new arrival, Harry sees the stone statue of Margaret Thatcher charge into the room with her finger threateningly pointing at them just as Ron shouts his hero name. Too late, Harry feels Vice-Net’s latest attack graze his skin as a flurry of knives, this time, pins him effectively to the wall. Try as he might to tug himself free—even if it means all new tears in his costume—Harry’s as ineffective as a butterfly in an insect collection. Still, he shouts, “
Harry knows that’s what has to be done for this injury; he just never expected Dracon to want him to do it. “You sure?”
“Moony,
It gets a chuckle out of Potter—a light thing whispered out on a breath, but Draco still feels a fierce thrill at having made him laugh. “So, what, Malfoy? You saw my name on the paperwork and jumped at the opportunity to see me like this? See what’s become of
Uncontrolled strikes of lightning zap aimlessly out into the room, and everyone standing ducks for cover.
, and black spots dance before his eyes. From somewhere far away, Harry can hear someone groaning.
This is Draco’s first time getting a real good look at Potter since the incident. Despite all his experience with cases such as this, Draco can’t help the surprised lurch that tugs at his stomach. Realistically, Draco expected the gauntness in Potter’s face, the greyed tinge of his skin, and the fangs he’d seen flashes of before. But to fully see the markings of a vampire attack on someone he
When they were alive, Lily and James Potter had been top tier Superheroes despite jumping into it later than most people who typically start in their mid-teens—at least according to their scant files in the Hero Order. Lily and James had started their hero careers when they were almost in their twenties and after they became a couple. As a result, they were able to design their hero aliases as a crime-fighting pair.
Suddenly, the arsehole with the dragon mask’s in Harry’s line of sight—except the mask now rests slightly askew on his head, as if deliberating on the benefits of falling off. He’s gesturing in the direction from which they fell. “You see that? Do you
Rustling and hacking sounds reach Harry’s ears even as his fingers rest against the door handle.
~~*~~
“Oh, yeah. And that Paper Dracon bloke was there too.”
And, true to his word, Malfoy did. For three months, Draco Malfoy made it his afterlife’s mission to annoy, agitate, and harass Harry in the sanctity of his own home. Harry would be trimming the petunias he was growing on the terrace ledge and nearly drop the shears on the unsuspecting crowd below because a ghostly chill followed a ghostly hand along his back. Harry would be peacefully showering, and Malfoy’s head would pop out of the wall to ask if the water was warm enough, his mere presence causing the temperature to turn frigid. Harry would prepare a plate of food for himself, and Malfoy would run his open mouth through it, telling Harry his “cooking was shite” and leaving the meal mould-encrusted. After a while, Harry stopped throwing out the moulding food, and instead cast a good
Harry pauses. “Eh, kind of? Like, I found him unconscious in a ditch. He was pretty injured.”
died. Followed me ever since. Although”—Malfoy spun around in a circle, looking about the room—“seems as though one got lost on our way here. There were four before.”
It also feels good to know that his plan to keep the other heroes safe has mostly worked so far. Only one attack has occurred since the implementation of the schedule shift, but the ambushed hero had been able to fight the attackers off. That had been thanks to an additional idea set forth by Mad-Eye about the targeted heroes pairing up and sleeping over one another’s houses to limit the possibility of a successful attack.
But that works out fine, since Dracon’s not done talking. “Blaizing Fire may be stupid sometimes, but not even he would just stand there under a streetlight for anyone to see. Like some kind of amateur.”
For one heart-stopping second, Draco thinks Potter will refuse, and what will he do then? But then Potter’s hand moves until the tips of his gloved fingers latch onto the edges of Draco’s robe.
As he reaches the other side of the square, the hidden building fully materializes before his eyes. Draco gives himself credit for only hesitating two minutes before he gives the wood a resounding knock.
A hoarse bark of laughter rips itself from Dracon’s throat. “Really? What was your first clue? Was it all the bloo—”
“Two months, Harry,” Hermione said. “It had been only two months after the War that Malfoy came back into your life like this. That’s hardly enough time for someone dealing with the threat of being murdered for seven years to come to terms that they’re allowed to be at peace.”
He looks back to the forms in the distance and can make out Ron’s body lying atop his sister’s. Further away, Harry notes a black-clad figure that must be the villain they’d faced. Fire licks all around.
When his scolding failed to solicit a response from Harry, Malfoy glanced up with a smirk that only grew wider as he noted that Harry had pulled his wand from his pocket.
Sighing, Poppy Petal grabs the water for him. She helps him sit up in bed and presses the glass into his hands.
“She needed a vacation?” Ron says.
“Where did you check for it?”
Making a soft moan, Draco wraps his arms around Harry and deepens the kiss.
“Look, I know this is difficult for you, but the best thing for us to do right now is to head back to the base and see what aid we can get,” Hermione says. “We can’t afford to lose any more heroes right now.”
“Funnily enough doesn’t make us feel better, mate,” Ron called from the couch.
“Why else would he have given you that information if it hadn’t been some kind of trap, then?” Ron’s been silent for most of the exchange, but he looks directly at Harry now.
Harry doesn’t know how to fight these robots properly, and there’s no real way to ask Dracon without giving any listening Supervillains a clearer taste of his voice. And despite his stellar performance getting off his bindings, Harry doubts Paper Dracon is in a good enough condition to fight it, either.
Malfoy glared, but continued, “I can’t travel there for... obvious reasons, but I know enough about how one gambles on your regrets. You don’t win body parts; you win the removal of a regret, the losers at the table taking on regrets of the winner.” His hand moved absently over the hole where the peachick still rested, and it pecked at his fingers. “How else could Ravenclaw’s Grey Lady look so immaculate, having died such a violent death, whilst the Bloody Baron is covered in blood and chains like a stuck pig hanging in a slaughterhouse?”
A hollow chuckle comes from Dracon. “Why do you think the price for having one’s identity revealed is so high? What else could the useless pawn offer his enemies in exchange for mercy but information?”
With speed he's unaware he possessed, Harry slides off the crate and dives for the electricity box on the wall. As the first shots ring out and ping off the sides of the metallic cargo, he touches the box and pulls a string of electricity from it. Tangible lightning crackling in his hand, Harry whips it out at the villains coming from around the stacked boxes. He watches them stumble backwards, some falling down while others flee. Quick as a flash, he strikes one of the stacked crates, sending it toppling over the other side amid shouts of alarm.
. How can—”
Ron grasps both Hermione and Harry to hold them steady. “What the bloody hell was that?”
However, next day’s breakfast brings a school owl dropping an elongated box into Draco’s pudding with a scrawled note attached.
Now comes the tricky part. With great care, they work the loo window open and spring it from its hinges. Being the smaller one, Harry accepts Ron’s help lifting him through the window first. Outside, he uses his leverage to pull Ron through as well after he’s tossed their civilian clothes out to Harry. Then Harry takes the screwdriver stuffed in his jacket pocket, and he and Ron reconnect the window back into its place.
The first victim rooms in a flat above Eeylops Owl Emporium.
“Ahh. So, it had been the machine that had exploded?”
Cho straightens in her chair. “And just how do you know that?”
His lightning buzzes through him, coming alive against his skin. “Cho.”
While Ron wrestles with the swan, fighting off its wings now that its beak is out of commission, Harry attempts to gather the electricity he can feel circulating in and around his body—a newer ability he’s found he had, but it’s still experimental at best. Tiny sparks flicker at his fingertips and between his hair follicles when Ron finally flings the swan aside enough to toss his hand in the villain’s direction.
“He would've just told me to piss off.”
“What’s the Villain Agency planning with those stolen identities?”
As he speculates just how to climb the stack of three boxes, movement in his periphery draws his attention. A giant, flapping paper swan is flying towards him, and, swift as he can blink, Harry yanks the electricity from one of the few hanging lights and strikes it down.
Yet that frustration drops into his stomach and curdles there into fear as he sees
He releases his breath and takes the chair across from Blaizing Fire. He meets the white eye patches of the under-mask and thinks about what Paper Dracon looks like beneath his identical face-covering. That line of thinking makes his heart palpitate in his chest, and Harry wonders what the hell is wrong with him.
“I lo-
Pulling back, he sees her swallow; then she gives a tight nod and folds the note up.
The doors screech loudly on their wheeled hinges as Harry pushes them open and screech again when he shuts them behind him.
“Granger.” Draco looks to Weasley who gives a brief nod and flashes a close-lipped smile. “What, no overly-friendly greeting this time?”
“K-Kevin?” Mrs. Figg’s voice comes out wobbly.
“Oh,” Luna says. “I recognize that voice. You’re our captive.”
“Jus’ come see, Pot-ter.”
Her hands curl into fists. “You don’t get it, do you? They don’t
A memory pricks at Harry’s brain, but it doesn’t connect right. He looks up to see
Tracey stares into her misty eyes. “Yes.”
When Potter exhales against Draco’s throat, an involuntary shudder wracks through Draco. “I—"
“Excellent.” Alpha Bee ushers Hermione and Ron out the door. “Some other heroes will come in a little later to return you to your holding cell, Mr. Fire.”
“You asked me to.” He curses himself for the honest answer and thinks quickly on how best to undercut it. “I mean, come on. Who wouldn’t be curious to receive such a message from an enemy and it not be some sort of ransom note or threat?”
With the stress grating on him from both the Dracon situation and the overall case of stolen hero identities, Harry feels his mood going steadily downhill. After the seventh dead end, Harry decides he needs to separate himself from the other heroes before he snaps and does something else he’ll regret.
A lot to hedge his bets on, but the Agency seems to not be expecting the Hero Order to have located their main hideout. Worse comes to worse, he could always pretend to be an ordinary thief so as not to give away his fellow heroes. Although, what villains would do to someone committing a crime against
pretty good. Must be all the metal he’s got stuffed away. Attracted a good amount of that electricity you sent out.” Ron huffs a sudden laugh. “You also managed to blast off that pointing finger from the Iron Lady.”
“Ugh, but it’s like reading up on early, low-tech, Superhero costumes.”
But he stays. He stays as Potter’s still-gloved hands hover about Ms. Adams as he shows her a part of himself he’s hidden from Draco. He stays as Potter whispers words to her that Draco’s ears are ringing too loud to hear. And he stays as Potter quietly excuses himself, swaying a bit on his feet as he stands from his crouch and walks into another section of the flat. Distantly, Draco gathers that he went to the loo.
“What’s in the other pot?” Potter’s voice comes out surprisingly unmuffled.
As the electricity flows through the discarded arm giving it new life, engraving previously overlooked due to how worn down it became—either through long use or during the explosion—lights up in stark relief.
Draco tears his eyes away from the display only when he hears a choked noise beside him. He just catches sight of the edge of Potter’s cloak as it slips through the door. Glancing back at the interrogation room reveals the Aurors trying to placate Mr. Hendricks while he blinks around at them in confusion, the glazed look in his eyes growing dimmer.
“Hey, now, Potter. Not so fast. We’re in the middle of our play—”
Potter doesn’t seem to take the hint; that, or he really doesn’t know.
Ron lets out a long sigh. “All right, then. So, you know what you told us a few days ago, about what Finch-Fletchley said?”
Tracey takes one of the hands away from her face to wave it dismissively at Harry without looking at him. “They threatened me the day they took it. I saw them out the window as they carted it off, saying they’d ‘know’ if I ever talked. Tried to recruit me since. I-I knew Kevin—was a year below him in school. I-If they could get to him, then . . . .”
“Then we’ll have to get it ourselves, won’t we?” Ron noticeably shifts his head in Harry’s direction. “Won’t necessarily be confidential information if we get it straight from the source, eh, mate?”
“I dunno. Might not solve anything, but it would be good to try. I think.”
Suddenly, a whole flock swarms him, and it’s much less adorable.
“I’m not interested in playing strip poker with you.”
Then he heads back inside and, instead of wrangling someone to head back out into the corridor with him, holds out his hand for someone to choose to take. Regardless, fearful muttering breaks out amongst the group, speculating about why he went out into the corridor again only to come right back, as well as the odd shift in treatment. Some worry the change in behavior indicates a particularly horrendous experiment. Still, Harry waits, even as more precious time ticks away.
hurls a feather dart in her direction, and she barely dodges.
“She means
“Even though it likely is.” Her hands twist in her lap. “They’ve been really interrogating him. That villain
“They let you go, I trust?”
And Draco’s suddenly aware of the small space they’re in—the side alley’s so narrow—and while Potter is still too far away to touch Draco, he’s closer than he’s ever been since being bitten. Draco’s head starts swimming when he feels the intensity of Potter’s attention, all zeroed in on Draco, and their Hogwarts days seem just a fistful of robe away—except Draco hasn’t needed to say anything horrible this time around.
“Why, Ha-Izulu?” Ron doesn’t move his hand away from the Supervillain’s face. “They’re perfectly fine with using every hero’s identity against them for some twisted plot of theirs. The least we can get in return would be one Supervillain’s identity.”
He-he’s gotta get out of here. There has to be a way out of here. The walls are closing in. Small, so small. God, is that him panting?
“Yay, Harry!” Hermione flings herself into Harry’s arms and pecks him on the cheek.
finally pushed Harry over the edge into talking to Ron and Hermione about the situation. When Hermione tried laying into him about keeping the fact he was being haunted by his boyhood rival a secret, Harry came back with the fact that she and Ron had been honeymooning around the world since the end of the War, only recently returning so that Ron could pick up Auror Training with Harry. And Harry hated being a nuisance.
Feeling hot under the collar, Harry says, “Actually, I reset the bone. After Dracon let me re-break it.”
“I don’t know, the cornered person continued to sound more and more desperate. Finally, the trapped figure shoved his hands into his pockets and flung something at the outstretched arm. It made a weird clunky sound, and it must have dropped down to the machine’s side since it disappeared from view but didn’t make a sound like it hit the floor or anything.”
“Hmm,” Narcissa hummed, a small smirk on her face. When she finally stood and started her walk back toward the Manor, she stopped at the grove’s edge. “Mr. Potter?”
As Harry takes another cautious step towards them, his attention gets dragged to Paper Dracon when he cries out and collapses. Looking at the odd angle Dracon holds himself, Harry suddenly realizes what seemed off about him earlier. “Your leg . . . . It’s broken?”
Besides all the inaction, Potter’s hold is so light that Draco could pull away easily should he want to.
Potter sighs. “It was sort of made after you had—apologised to me.” He looks down into his lap. “If anything, you’d probably try to not be a complete pr—
“My heartbeat? Why wouldn’t you—” Understanding enters Potter’s eyes and floods his face full of hope. “Y-you do?”
Regardless, Harry felt more than ready to leave once their main goal had been accomplished. However, a new alarming dilemma became apparent as Ron and Harry prepared to Disapparate.
Harry swallows. “Yeah. I’m guessing the parts—or at least the metal—for the robots were in those crates they were trying to ship out under the radar. Acromium.”
“Well, yes.” She moves a hand to tug an errant curl caught by the wind back behind her ear. “But you both so rarely ever come with me when I get books.”
Even when he calms himself enough to uncurl, Harry’s fingers still shake. Before looking at the body again, he delicately stuffs his hands under his thighs.
“Are you all right,
Despite the parasol and his trussed-up state, Potter still does not walk beside Draco. He has to keep turning his head several times to check that Boy Wonder is still there. Each time, Draco spots him, not directly behind him, but several paces behind and to the side. He decides not to ask. If Potter wants to follow him in the oddest way possible, who is Draco to call deliberate attention to it in the middle of a public street?
This time, at Harry’s touch, Paper Dracon stills and doesn’t pull away.
Feeling some of the awkwardness fade away, Harry smiles brightly at her. “You sure did! My Control over Electricity at the time had been erratic at best, but you helping out in situations where you didn’t even use your Control over Water made me feel like anyone could become a Superhero. So long as you persistently work towards it and believe in helping people in need.” He sighs. He sighs. “To make one other person believe—like you did for me . . . I'd have made it, then. As the kind of hero I strive to be.”
Mad-Eye had been the only casualty in the battle, which in itself was some kind of miracle with how outnumbered the heroes had been. He had leapt in front of
Locating and gathering Draco’s remains took about half an hour. There wasn’t much left to find after months of decay, but the collecting process took time with the way the evidence was scattered about. Harry chose to believe it to be the work of squirrels or birds or raccoons rather than what the hairline fractures along Draco’s ghost form actually suggested. The absence of the original peachick left behind from Draco’s first jump from this place remained unsaid, but hung in the air like its own spectre.
He starts walking forward, his own gaze resolutely pinned to the wall.
so far.
“I’ll probably check on them tomorrow or in a week. Whenever I have time.”
Movement near Ron’s head suggests he nods as they enter a particularly shadowed region of the street. “Yeah, I suppose. So, do you plan to power up when we’re close?”
Draco sighs. “You don’t have to. It just is what it is.”
walk away.”
“Don’t pretend to know—”
Harry doesn’t like how deflated Dracon sounds, but he has a job to do as well. He sits cross-legged before the villain, hands propping him up as he leans backward and sends his electricity flowing through his system again. “Yeah, I suppose. But I doubt the Villain Agency stealing a bunch of files on England’s heroes was a mistake. That seemed quite deliberate to me.”
“Dunno,” Ron says. “But it’d be worth a shot, wouldn’t it? Rather than sit here arguing about what could have happened?”
Snidgets. You’re literally the only one
“And he gave me that, telling me it’s for you.”
The two of them watch as the Aurors clear out the line-up except for the gentleman second to last on the far-right end. A table and set of chairs is summoned from the ground below and suddenly the line-up room becomes transformed into an interrogation room. Magical manacles identical to the ones used in Wizengamot hearings latch onto the suspect and pin him to his chair.
He lowers his voice when he realises he’s started shouting and drops his hand when he notices it pointing accusingly at Potter. “Anything to
“—they go right through me, too, when I ‘catch’ them and—” Harry’s eyes widened. “Hang on, did I actually
“Oh, no, we can’t!” Hermione says. “Did you forget about that giant history report due Monday?”
“To you, I suppose it would be. How about—the cause is to serve the will of
Potter’s one shoulder does a weird spasm that’s probably supposed to be a shrug. “I thought I did. I mean, well...” His head falls into his hands. “I didn’t even know the person was a
“I don’t know. The fight basically sucked up most of our attention since me and the other hostages didn’t plan on dying.” Finch-Fletchley looks up at the ceiling. “Being tied up, though, makes it real difficult to dodge anything. At one point, the masked person had been right in front of us before dodging one of the machine’s attacks. We weren’t able to.”
Smoke billows from the gaping hole blown into the side of a dilapidated block of flats. Residents crowd outside as sirens blare in the distance, still several street corners down.
“A good return on your investment, I see,” she mutters.
By 5:30am, he falls asleep with the book and 'bookmark' lying on his chest.
“. . . face my displeasure,” a high, hissing voice says. “Why you insist on prolonging this, I find difficulty in understanding.”
“Yes, I know.” While Harry may be too out of sorts to know what’s going on, the crack in Dracon’s voice tells him it’s important. “I’ve fought you enough times to know. But like I said, that’s not what I aimed to imply.”
, Harry thinks back. Then he tosses the coat over top Dracon’s head.
“But you just said he was struggling around and was showing clear signs of distress!”
“Draco,” Hermione returned. “You should probably back up. Just because you’re a ghost doesn’t mean you’ll be safe from crossfire-magic. You have enough problems to worry about already, yes?”
Harry doesn’t miss the new, stiff way Blazing Fire holds himself or the subtle way he takes his hands from the desk top to curl into fists in his lap.
Harry turns around to come mask to mask with the pearly dragon skull. “I told you, we have to find Voldemort to end this. I don’t want anyone to die who doesn’t have to!”
. And in his panic, Draco sees in the back of his mind the look on Theo Nott’s face in Fifth Year,
While Mad-Eye hadn’t been serious with his declaration, it gives Harry an idea. He looks back to Alpha Bee hopefully, and the old hero scans Harry’s masked face with his eyes before assenting and handing Harry the key. Relieved, Harry roots in the drawer by the door and nabs the deck of cards he’d used the last time he spoke to Blaizing Fire.
Hermione says, “Which would hint that they’re kind of close?”
“It wouldn’t be a breach of confidentiality to get your testimony directly from you, however.” Harry nibbles his bottom lip. “That is, if you'd be willing to provide it.”
“Back in the alley by Knockturn. At the Weasleys. When we first met in your attic, even. Right?”
Another villain would make more sense. Likelier to fight and leave once Paper Dracon’d been defeated.
Harry’s foot stops. “Close for villains, then.”
Dracon turns his head away.
He turns to face Harry again, arms crossed. “Who says I haven’t?”
And—and that makes sense to Draco. Of course, Potter’s date would have been a woman; somewhere in the back of his mind, he must have known, for it to not shock him now, for him to not have asked about it up until now. His hands slide into his robe pockets, and he tries to pass off as neutral an expression as he can for Potter.
“See you around, hero?”
Mrs. Weasley stops in her tracks, but when she speaks, her awe and delight haven’t faded. “Is that really you?”
That plan worked until they reached the Manor gates at the end of the drive where Malfoy’s form rippled as he tried to cross into the street, like a dog getting shocked by an electric collar.
“I’m glad to have made such an impact on someone.” She pulls away and rests her head on her knees. “But, you must be disappointed now. Having fled from my hero duties after not being able to even protect my partner.”
bursts from the phone. “Shit. My high score!”
con-nect-ed t’the case.”
“Come to the bookstore with me.”
A sliding door opens and closes behind him. “What are you doing out here, hero?”
“Don’t touch me!” Dracon snarls.
“In your dreams.”
A darkened stone stairway greets Harry. As the door swings wide, dull lights affixed along the walls flicker on and lead the path downward.
“Don’t throw caution to the wind!”
“Yes, but we could still probably work around it at the Hero Order.”
“Still doesn’t explain why he’s able to move as fast as he does.  Even after nearly collapsing, he can make a quick getaway—”
“It was an act of intimidation because it means they know how to slip past Mad-Eye.”
As Harry heads over, he realizes Dracon is putting on the rest of his costume. When he almost reaches him, Harry hears a distinct
“That’s not really in my hands anymore. The Auror Department is taking care of it. I’m just in training.”
With a flick of his wand, Harry magicked the bedroom curtains aside and moonlight flooded into the room, piercing through Malfoy’s form like a kaleidoscope of monochrome. Malfoy’s ghostly pallor glowed brighter with the touch of light, throwing his features in stark relief. His robes were formal, but the long tears in the material hid that fact well. His hair lay on his head in mussed clumps, as though he’d rolled around in dirt or had a thousand sweaty hands run through the locks. Cuts marred his face and a shadow of a bruise lingered along his chin.
for that. While not intentionally done, people died because of decisions you made.”
That hushes Cho.
“I’m not privy to—”
“You—” Dracon glances around. “It . . . . This was a trap. For you.”
“O’ course I have. We weren’t about to wait—”
Draco raises his hand to knock, then pauses. “Aren’t you going to take those off? You might scare her off, dressed like that.”
While he would prefer not to think about it, Harry knows he has to entertain all possibilities.
Harry turns over several more times before giving up on sleeping. Reaching over to his nightstand, he nabs the current novel he’s reading and flicks on the lamp. His bookmark falls onto his chest as he opens to his saved page. He twirls the worn paper with
Her jaw shifts back and forth as her eyes bore into Draco’s.
“Oh, well—there were some patients that were brought in from an incident that happened about two miles from here. From the flat explosion? Anyway, I only really know the name of the guy who was conscious, but I’d like to see them all any—”
Harry shook his head and walked into Draco’s space, catching his other hand that was fluttering about in a nervous gesture. “I’ve run from death for a long time, outpacing it more than anyone really has a right to. Remember how I mentioned that before? Technically, Voldemort killed me with that second Killing Curse in the Forbidden Forest, only I traded the death of part of his soul for a return to life for mine. Death is but an old friend of mine who was quite kind the last time we met.”
Before they forget he’s even there, Harry waves his hands to get their attention. “Also, one more thing.”
They both dash toward the Palace to investigate as well as dodge another blow from Richard. Upon reaching the first smashed gargoyle, Harry and Ron wonder no longer.
“That’s not—” Malfoy stopped himself. “Ugh, I wish I could just go with you.”
“I doubt he would have been inclined to cooperate more if we captured his cohort,” Harry grumbles.
“Potter?” His voice sounded like it ran through water before reaching Harry.
“Potter—” His voice sounds
He gets up and is nearly within Alpha Bee’s outstretched arm before he turns back toward the table. “But what about—?”
Dracon’s hands bunch the fabric at Harry’s back, and it’s through his shaking that Harry realizes his ex-enemy is crying.
There’s a sharp intake of breath. “You . . . . You know?”
They may have turned off of Knockturn now, but it still wouldn’t do good to have any of that crowd overhearing the fact it’s Potter who’s with Draco, wearing fifty-odd layers for an undisclosed reason.
He lifts his hands in a placating gesture as she latches onto the front of his hero costume, evidently unphased by whatever shock she received for doing so. “S-sorry—”
have no choice but to use his powers, revealing himself to be the Superhero Izulu, he’d prefer for the villains to not recognize his real voice after the fact. So, in the event that he gets accosted by anyone, Harry has a Plan.
“Hardly,” Ron snarls.
“Great. Thanks for the help.”  Harry turns to leave.
“But you have your whole life ahead of you! Fuck, Potter, you survived the Dark Lord. Don’t tell me you won’t survive me.”
Abruptly, the bats drop the masked villain next to Harry and scatter as they flee out of the shed.
~~*~~
Coughing into his fist, Harry straightens and strides towards Dracon. “Why did you try to steal that woman’s purse?”
and the other on their escape route to the door, Harry guides Dracon along in shuffling steps. The robot doesn’t advance towards them—it wouldn’t need to, considering it stopped in the center of the cell—but it does rotate to follow their progress towards the exit and keep its palms trained on them.
If the investigators are just now getting around to sweeping the flats, Harry finds it unlikely that they would've checked outside first. While plenty of clues probably exist directly at the crime scene, other hints are as likely to be just outside of it, considering the culprit had to flee somewhere.
Harry hesitated a moment when Narcissa beckoned him over, but only for a moment. In the next, he was knelt beside Draco’s Mum as she whispered prayers and offered up her apologies to him under her breath. Caught up in the intimacy of it all, Harry may have said a few of his own.
and mimics her pose. “You probably wouldn’t be the great hero you are if you didn’t feel regret over the people you couldn't save.”
Harry raised his wand and waved it at the four new intruders, muttering the incantation under his breath. The effect was immediate: the four ghosts compacted into four floating balls of light which quickly expelled themselves through the kitchen wall, their discarded ghost body parts following close behind as though tugged along by strings.
ed in agreement.
Nibbling at his thumb, he considers his options. Then, with purpose in his step, he walks alongside the CAUTION tape until he’s in one of the side alleyways. Once there, he slows down, scanning the ground with his eyes.
“Sorry,” he says roughly, grabbing his mask from the table and heading out the door.
“Respectfully, Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry said from behind clenched teeth, “back-handed compliments aren’t compliments, and that kind of attitude is what started this whole mess in the first place. If you actually regret what happened with your son—not just his death, but even the involvement with a group like Voldemort’s, you’d work on ridding yourself of that thinking. Prove that your love for your son is greater than the hate that’s festered in you and your family for so long.”
The policeman with Harry darts him an accusatory glance, but Harry ignores it. His powers had detected the electrical currents present around the bodies of people still alive. With the smoke being as thick as it was and dead bodies producing no energy output, there was no way for Harry to have known more people were inside. Maybe if he’d only argued with the boat lady from earlier for five seconds instead of five minutes . . . .
Harry thinks. “That what happened to you? That night?”
Mr. Park and Ms. Adams easily greet Potter when they see him, and Potter makes small talk back. While the three of them wait in the corridor of the observation room as the line-up is prepped, Mr. Park and Ms. Adams introduce themselves to one another, and Potter twiddles his thumbs. He’s foregone his head-wrappings today, much to Draco’s pleasant surprise. Once or twice. he catches Potter’s eye, and, not quite knowing what else to do, nods slightly and gives a half-smile.
Draco’s up and almost out of the front door, cloak taken from the hall rack when Potter’s voice calls out to him.
His heart’s still pounding as Ron carefully reaches out a hand to touch the first of the knives.
probably helps too.
“Thank you.”
With a kind of reverence, he takes the bundle out of its hollow and unties the knot keeping the stack bound. Harry catches the papers that try to scatter about the floor. Taking them over to the dresser, he lays them down and sorts through the stack. A bunch of them are letters of orders given from the Agency; others are pictures of Kevin with other masked members; one looks like early schematics for the
Mouth suddenly dry, Harry wonders if he should be more careful when dealing with his first “proper” villain encounter.
Draco’s twitching hands had found their way into his hair where he clutched at the ethereal strands, his head bowed.
No response from the villain is forthcoming. That’s fine. Harry did not anticipate this being easy.
He stands up when snow starts to fall, grass stains on his trousers. Not quite ready to head back yet, he decides to wander around the graveyard. In the midst of weaving around the graves, a few catch his eye as familiar names of people in history books or the true identities of fallen Superheroes. However, it is a grave marked
“Will do.”
Finally, a
“Hmm, well, there is a time limit.” Harry brought his arms behind his back and started circling Draco. “So, best we get to that Seekers’ game.
“Oh, shut up, Harry.” Ron throws one of the pillows on his bed at him.
“Eh-heh. Yeah,” Harry croaks.
Once he grows calm enough that his skin and hair stop sparking, and the jagged lines on the body of his suit that follow the pattern of the scars that lay underneath cease glowing, Harry creeps out from behind the building. He sneaks across the empty street until the ditch where he’d seen the flash of white comes back into view. At this point, he’s approaching on his hands and knees, forcing away thoughts of what the police could accuse him of now if they ever catch him like this.
Poppy Petal remains silent until Harry has almost nodded off. “There was an attack earlier today. At
“No,” Hermione says. “But the heroes attacked have been seriously injured. They’re getting medical treatment up in their base.”
“So,” Harry says, “you were returning the favor?”
He arrives at the covered dock shed where the Agency’s villains appear to be stacking a large cruiser with sealed crates—most of them wearing indistinguishable black from head to toe. Harry creeps along the outer edge of the shed until he reaches the entryway and waits for an opening to sneak inside.
While a villain is more likely, completely dismissing other options would be remiss of Harry. A hero or unknown vigilante still could've been involved.
“If it's an ambush, we’re best off having the best kind of stealth possible. Me shining like a lighthouse will hardly provide that.”
Feeling more tired by the minute, Harry nods his head again.
The three of them follow Alpha Bee to the chamber adjacent to the interrogation room. This room has a one-way stretch of glass, and they can see into the interrogation room where the prisoner sits immobile at a table.
Of course, when he reaches the entrance to the interrogation room, it’s locked. He swivels around and marches to the observation room. When Harry enters, he’s nearly overwhelmed by the number of professional heroes crowding the space, most of whom he’s seen only in passing or on the news cycle.
“That still doesn’t answer my question. Why were you so compelled to assist that young hero escape from us? Fully knowing the consequences of such a betrayal.”
“Mr. Potter?” a soft, thin voice called. “What are you doing trespassing on Malfoy grounds?”
“Our understanding of vampires and vampire attacks—and what was considered the Old, Indisputable Knowledge on the subject—continues to evolve the longer our Department works on these cases. All it really took was looking at a different angle,” Draco says as Potter’s finger-tips touch the glass over his reflection’s chest. “Still you there, Potter. Still you.”
Sneaking into the Villain Agency’s main base goes without a hitch. Considering they had two pro heroes scope out the place for a few days, the success shouldn’t come as a surprise. But the Hero Order has gotten used to being out-maneuvered by the Villain Agency over the past few weeks.
“Oh, dear.” Hermione’s hands cover her face.
“I should be able to cast my own.”
Alpha Bee smiles wide and holds his arms out to them—out of all the people here to meet them, he looks the friendliest. “Ah, good work. Good work, you three!”
Harry doesn’t look Ron in the eyes. “He wants to meet me on Saturday.”
Hermione’s recently finished heating the food, and Ron’s leaning on the counter in a nightshirt and a pair of tan trousers.
Shaking himself a little, Justin plasters a smile on his face. “Oh, yeah. Thanks, again. For helping me out.”
,” Potter hisses.
“We’re well aware of your habits of choice. Get on with the—”
Relief flooding him, Harry gets out of the way of the medical professionals as they surround the victims.
Draco sighs. “It’s none of my business what caused the rift between you and your friends, just that being bitten made it worse. And, thing is, just as isolation may have helped in choosing targets, it was also meant to silence them. But—do you feel alone now, Potter?”
“To be honest, I don’t really blame him for jumping out of the way of those attacks. He’d already been taking loads of hits.”
, all powers have their limits.” Her head turns away from him, showing off the long sharpness of her mask’s beak. No doubt her mind strays to the many failed incidents where she’s tried and failed to heal his scar—before it could stretch down his whole body when powering up.
Harry’s joy is short-lived, however.
Regardless of what he finds out, he knows he has to speak to Justin.
“Nothing too new. Just that it can definitely attack other people and kill them. The witness couldn’t tell how, though. Apparently, its attacks came too fast to distinguish anything.”
..............................................
Picking himself off the floor, Harry walks up to Alpha Bee. “Do you really think me going back in there’s a good idea? I mean, I did let everyone down by not getting anything useful from Paper Dracon.”
Harry and Dracon are near enough to the spacious cell to watch it open and a crowd of beaten-down Superheroes come out.
“Look, if you don’t want to repeat your testimony, that’s fine. You’re under no obligation to do so. Just tell me to go away if you don’t want to, and I will.”
Harry blinks. “I didn’t know you had a power.”
“I—game?”
“—so, with my free time not being consumed with busy-body heroes, I decided to do some research.”
“That might be the case in other instances, but, for this one, the detectives have already shared evidence with us heroes.”
Vice-Net opens a lamp stand drawer, pulls out some notepad paper and a pen, and hands them over to Blaizing Fire.
Following Blaizing Fire’s directions, he strides to the end of the current hallway and turns down the adjacent one. Harry counts the doors until he reaches the third one. Collecting his courage, he gently twists the knob and pushes it open.
of Good Deeds.”
Unfortunately for Voldemort, Cho already took out the last of the monstrous machines with the power from her own two hands.
Draco shrugs. “Figured I’d keep it as a reminder not to make a right mess of it.”
“My brother can deaden or amplify other people’s powers,” Ginny says with her chin jutted out.
Ron asks, “D’you know what caused the hostage situation, or why it turned into murder?”
That opportunity comes when one of the ropes holding a crate aloft snaps. A bunch of the men rush to prevent it from falling from the crane suspending it in midair over the water.
“He says to come alone. It’s likely some kind of trap.”
He tumbled through the air and stopped a hair’s breadth from the ground which now glittered about him as though covered in morning frost. Upon righting himself, he came face to face with the garden in much the same state as the grass. As he walked into the trees and shrubbery, he discovered that despite the fantastical shine from afar, the vegetation had a thin look to it, like cobwebs were stretched over the real deal underneath and Harry could just reach out to brush them away.
The paper storm surrounding Voldemort subsides.
—until he reaches a long stone corridor at their bottom. The lights already shine in this underground lair and cast shadows along the walls.
Harry shrugs. He’s too tired to really think about it.
, but one only makes that mistake once in this business.
Draco’s guilty expression lasted as long as the silence did, broken by a soft rustling coming from the direction of the Manor.
“And what about the others with you?”
“And where were you planning to take him for treatment?”
,” he whispers.
Harry’s fabric relaxes around him again after the other Superhero releases his hold.
“What did it use?”
work as intended and even if it does, Astral Projection carries risks.” She stopped stirring and turned fully to face Harry. “I think it’s lovely, what you’re trying to do for Draco, but you need to ask yourself whether the worst case scenario is worth it all.”
Harry doubts another hero would've taken the trouble to have such a vicious fight with Dracon only to abandon him in a ditch somewhere. At the very least, he would’ve been abandoned at the police station.
By the time he strikes the bird and the paper catches fire, Paper Dracon’s long gone.
The door swings open, and Harry comes face to mask with the Supervillain who killed his parents and tried to kill him a decade and a half ago. It takes a few stunned seconds for Harry to take in the bald, gnarled, and splotched head of Voldemort who turns red eyes on him.
This time, rushing footsteps are heard on the other side of the door. “When?” Prancing Peacock demands. “When did this happen, Draco?” The sounds of rattling chains come from the direction of Peacock’s voice. “What did that bastard hero do to ruin my son?”
“And . . .” Dracon’s hand clenches against the alley wall. “And what do you want in return?”
Darting a glance at Alpha Bee, he notes the disappointment that’s re-entered his eyes.
“. . . Yes. In the end,
The voice comes right next to his ear. “You may strut around all of London like you’re somebody. But in the eyes of the law? Barely even a child playing dress-up.”
“I can’t power down!”
“Yeah, but you didn’t leave me here to fight elsewhere.” At least Harry doubts he did since the rain would limit Dracon’s ability for movement.
They figure out a second too late that the House of Lords Member had meant
“Uhm. That’s fine. You didn’t fry me or anything.” Justin walks to the front door and yanks his hand away from the handle when the metal gives him a sharp shock.
When Potter’s turned head indicates that he’s looking at Draco, Draco motions at him to come closer. After a few seconds pass where Potter doesn’t, Draco sighs and shifts over several steps, leaving Potter enough room for him to step into the view of the peephole. Potter does so, gloved hands clasped out in front of him.
“I was hoping to come in to see the... master of the house.”
“I’d still tell you to piss off.”
“I know. I know.” Alpha Bee pats at her back. “You want to prevent anyone else from losing their lives to the Villain Agency. But you can’t do so by acting recklessly.”
“My nephew did stay here while he attended school.” Her eyes haven’t lost their misty look. “I’m sure you could find something up in his room.”
“Naturally.”
He jots that down. Then he rolls his quill back and forth between his forefinger and thumb, almost hating himself for what he has to ask next. “What can you... tell me about, well, about the attack itself?”
He continues his crawl back toward Ginny, ignoring any more of the shouted words sent his way.
“Yes.” The beat is slow and too small to be normal for a human, but it’s there. A smile spreads across Draco’s face as he runs the back of his free hand down Potter’s cheek. “Probably for the best. You make a terrible vampire.”
picked it!”
Fighting off the urge to smile, Harry says, “Taking in the view. Why’re you out here? It’s your party, isn’t it?”
!” His voice comes out in a hysterical croak.
“I-I was wr—” He turns away and pretends to have a coughing fit. “You’d be a good fit, actually. In the Villain Agency. With powers like those.”
“Oh, yes! What did Justin have to say?” Hermione suddenly waves her hands before herself. “Wait, hold on. We should probably get the other heroes involved in the case—”
He brought three fingers up to his lips, contemplating, his eyes going shifty. “The Manor,” he finally replied.
“Brought this on yourself, mate. Nev and I finished ours Wednesday.”
Apparently, Paper Dracon is unconscious.
Harry is just glad that he had been prepared for Dracon to brush his cheek with his hand, otherwise, Harry would have accidentally sent a mightier shock through him when he embraced Harry. The smaller voltage of electricity coursing through him since being drained by the
The set of her shoulders declares she’s not pleased that Harry is not resting like he’s supposed to, but she’s dealt with him long enough to know he won’t when he’s this stressed about a situation. “Even after
“I’m not.” He holds his gaze steady on Potter’s closed-off one. “The vampire went after people it thought it could get away with biting, those that were isolated. Ms. Adams? Someone who’d go to work, then head off to a Muggle bar by herself. Mr. Park—a single father whose only child is off at school most of the year. And Mr. Dawson, a likely recluse. So the question, Potter, was why you were alone—enough for the vampire to think it could have a go at The Boy Who Lived without much repercussion.”
pulled it off. He snorts and gives Harry a sidelong look. “Don’t fret your pretty head about it. Now, piss off before I lose my bet.”
mask and nods.
“Oh. Uh.” Potter’s hand rubs the back of his neck. “You’re... welcome?”
“You’ve attacked me with paper shreds before.”
. He hopes they’re not somehow locked inside.
them those other times but they pretended not to be caught?”
“It’s been a long day, Potter. Pretty draining for the both of us, and I know you can eat regular food since you're not fully 'Turned,' as they say. So if you don’t want any, I’m still ordering mine, and you can watch me eat it.”
Draco’s forte has always been making people cry, not getting them to stop. So, it’s a relief when Potter finally moves from his perch against the armchair to crouch down before Ms. Adams.
Draco shrugs and stares into his empty shot glass.
Sparks sprinkle down from the ceiling as the two of them have to dodge another assault from
!” Dracon has lifted himself onto one knee and is waving his arms about again. All the paper cranes that collapsed along with their director come back to life. He summons them into a swarm above his head. When all the cranes settle into their places, they form a giant hammerkop.
“Oh . . .” Harry says. There had been a rumor floating around that the two had been partners on
“Yeah.”
“But we’ve injured almost all of them! Do you really think they all managed to get far in the state we left them in?”
“How?”
On the landing, he nearly jumps out of his skin as he spots Kreacher staring up at him, gnarled hands curled round the stair railing to the attic.
They’ve Apparated separately to Diagon, and it’s thankfully less crowded than normal due to the cold.
Harry winces but doesn’t interrupt.
“Of course, I don’t really expect you to have kept up with my activities since leaving Hogwarts...” His right hand subconsciously adjusts his left cuff. “I work for a Ministry sub-division that handles attacks from Magical Creatures.”
One of the MPs looks from Harry to Ron, and she whispers, “Are you here to help us?”
He anticipates the door shutting but lets it happen.
Logically, Harry knows if he were to look at Dracon right now, he wouldn’t see his expression. Yet for all his bravery, he doesn’t have the strength to turn his head. “Not . . . always.”
As Mr. Eeylops leads them through the shop, some of the patrons reach out to touch Draco on the shoulder with whispered “Hello”s and “Good to see you, Mr. Malfoy”s. With each one, Draco manages a curt nod but doesn’t stop for conversation. He can feel Potter’s curious gaze burning into his back, and, just like in Sixth Year, Draco can’t even enjoy it.
. I know you have a good heart, but you need to know when best to listen to its whims. And while your theory may be interesting, I don’t see how it connects with your actions over these encounters.”
“Come now, Potter. We both know this won’t be the first time you’ve held my wand.” The second the words leave his mouth, Draco knows he should correct them. Say,
He places his hands behind his head and walks a few streets before he sees several small figures. Barely holding off his grin, Harry powers down and sticks to the shadows of the buildings lining the road until he’s nearly upon the people. Then he brings his power back full force until he glows like a florescent light in the drizzling rain. “Now what have
Despite his roaming thoughts, Harry forces himself to fall back asleep.
“Yeah, pretty neat, all things considered. Didn’t get a look at his face, though. He had another mask on beneath that one. Can you believe that?”
“Hope not. Lavender had said she’d try to get her to come out. She needs all the emotional support she can get with her powers acting out of control.”
Hermione’s gripping Ron back. “I think that came from the direction of Westminster Palace.”
“Open the damn letter, already, and stop moping.”
Paper Dracon is on top of him, evidently having just tackled Harry to get him out of the way of a misfired shot from one of the other battles. However, he doesn’t seem to realize he has managed to bring Harry back to reality, for he leaps back up without asking after Harry’s well-being and shoves his hand into the pocket over his heart.
“No!” Her frame shakes with her conviction. “No, I-I’m not . . . .” She sinks back down into the couch, head in her hands.
“So, what, you’re out to make a good name for a creature this side of the Earth hasn’t really heard of?”
Ron snorts. “Parvati did do quite a number on it. D’you reckon she’s still holed up in her room?”
A smirk works its way onto Harry’s face—not that anyone around could see it with the two layers of masks covering him. The Hero Order may have been led around by the nose for several weeks, but, in this moment, they’re the ones playing the Villain Agency like a fine-tuned harp, note for note. With all the chaos and destruction the other heroes are causing, the Agency wouldn’t expect their prisoners to escape on their own.
