Draco felt his face get hot. He pulled on the collar of his robes. Suddenly the room felt smaller. “Can you elaborate?”
“I like it when you don’t sugarcoat things for me. It’s hot.”
“I just wanted, uh,” Neville looked over his shoulder and I followed his gaze to the tree line of the Forbidden Forest behind us. He quickly looked back at me and finished. “I wanted to check on the hedges and then I got distracted making sure they were all uniform.”
So, that brought Harry to Luna and Ginny’s flat at seven in the morning because Luna insisted working as the sun rose (supposedly to better avoid the Nargles). That is how he found himself seated across the small circular wooden table from Luna who had parchment and quill ready to take notes.
“Please, just leave her alone,” Potter begged. And he managed to look Draco in the eye as he did it. If Draco had been anyone else, maybe this heartwarming display of camaraderie would have some affect on him. But all it did was make Draco’s insides flood with satisfaction at knowing he was winning—that there was still something he could do right. He was the one that Potter answered to—the one who had the power.
Harry barely contained his scoff. It was bad enough that he had to listen to Malfoy go on and on about protocol and paperwork, but now that Robards had complimented him, his partner would be insufferable. Not that Harry suffered him much as it were, at least not when he could avoid it. Malfoy was all paperwork and no bite, so when Harry could handle a case alone, he did. If paperwork was all Malfoy cared about, then Harry was glad to let him fill out the reports after Harry caught the bad guy. In Harry’s experience, action is what saves lives… not paperwork.
Draco let out a groan and zoomed upward. When he passed Harry, he pulled a face. It seemed to say,
“That’s my charming son, as always. ”
Harry could tell Ron reached the description of the Succubus when he let out a low whistle. Harry had to admit, for a demon-witch, she had been hot. Tall, legs that went on forever, and long, raven hair. Not to mention her perfect hourglass shape and the slinky black dress she wore like a second skin. He’d been taken in immediately when he first spotted her at the bar. An impulse had grown in him to talk to her. It was like she’d sucked all the air out of the room and he needed to look her way in order to continue breathing. That’s when he’d realised what she was—who she was—and decided to follow her out of the club. She’d gotten away with Ada Holcomb because he hadn’t been strong enough to resist her magic, the lure of her promise that he wouldn’t have to feel… so much.
“No shit.”
” as he hit the ground.
“Very specific.” Harry took the bottle and took a sip. “Tell me more very specific things.”
It felt wrong. Seeing her there. She was painted in her gardens. Seated at the table where she spent so much of her free time. Her dress was ivory and flowing down to her ankles. The sleeves reached down past her wrists and steepled into a point stopping at her knuckles. The neckline was swooped and exposed her collarbone and a string of pearls that shone in the false light of the portrait-version of the garden. Her hair was wrapped in an elaborate bun of braids at the nape of her neck. A few strands left free to flutter in the wind. The greenery behind her oscillated between the green buds of spring and the vibrant blossoms of summer.
“Et tu, Brutus?”
“What’s so funny?” Draco asked, an unsure smile settling on his face. “I insist that you witness my tragic moment, Potter.”
,” Harry snapped.
He gave me a nasty scowl. “Why not, Potter?”
Malfoy bit his lower lip to keep from laughing. “Right and I was well loved in school.” He walked closer to me. His eyes catching my gaze. He was close enough to whisper in my ear. “What are you up to, Potter? Something bad?”
The man turned toward Harry and then took his advice. He didn’t even bother to grab his clothes before running out of the mausoleum.
“I’m not rash. Who’s rash? You’re rash,” Harry stood up fast, hugged Hermione and the made a mad dash for the door before Hermione could try to talk him out of it.
“Uh,” Draco said, scanning the group. Right off, he decided he would not switch with Potter. Wearing his clothes would be torture. The smell of Potter’s cologne would haunt his dreams for weeks if he was forced to smell it on his own skin all night.
“Come on, come on, where are you?” Harry mumbled to himself when night settled in around them. It was late and he was getting antsy. He couldn’t be wrong. If he was wrong, then that meant someone else would die tonight because of his mistake.
“You haven’t changed much have you?”
“No, we have not had the pleasure as of yet, though I am sure we can remedy that,” Lucius spoke for the both of them. He placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder and squeezed slightly. It was a command. This meant Draco was supposed to smile, so he did, but not before gulping down the rest of his wine.
“Maybe…” Harry’s voice a trembling whisper, “…we should try a third time, just to be really, extra sure?”
The song was nearing it’s end. It was the really slow, seductive part. Harry was conscious of every part of his body that was touching Charlie's. But he kept his eyes on Charlie's face and he was looking exclusively at Harry’s lips now. “I almost kissed you that day.”
Draco clenched his jaw. The potion made him overly aware of Potter’s next to him; static electricity crackled between their bodies. All the hair on his arms stood at attention, as if reaching out for Potter. Every second felt like it was stretched to an eternity, and he hated this potion and how it made him think of everything he wanted but could never have.
There was silence on Hermione’s end. I watched her face in the embers. She seemed to be frowning, but you could never really tell with a fire-call.
Mad at himself and mad at this situation, Harry could feel tears welling up in his eyes and thanks to the harsh January air, they felt frozen almost the instant they fell down his wind-burned cheeks, “No, but why would he?”
“We’ve been in there loads of times.” I yanked my arm free of her grip. “This black smoke looks too much like my visions. It’s hovering over the grave where the caretaker was killed. That scream is still ringing in in my ears. It can’t be a coincidence.”
spell to get from the dorm to the bathroom at night.
Malfoy smirked, and Harry felt pixies flutter in his stomach, then Malfoy said, “Mmm, yes,
Instead of responding, Harry moved forward, grabbed Pansy by the arm and dragged her down the nearest hallway and shoved her into the small supply closet. After he shut the door and cast a muffliato, Harry asked, “What in Merlin’s beard is your problem? That will be in the paper tomorrow whether it’s true or not.”
“Agreed,” Potter said, giving Pansy his best hero-smile. “Malfoy and I were just about to send him word about our theory anyway, so that works out well. It looks like she’s using Ley Line magic.”
“Malfoy, wait up,” Potter called from behind him.
Their last encounter was likely why Potter fought against his binds with extra barbarity today. Potter tried to stand, and because there was not much slack, came crashing down to his knees directly in front of Draco. He breathed heavily like a dragon just before it spits fire.
On the ground, Harry was met by Draco, grinning and holding the snitch between his index finger and thumb.
“‘M fine,” Potter mumbled. “Head hurts a bit.”
“Thank you,” I said.
Harry held his breath, sprawled out on the ground. There was no stirring from the couch, so he sighed out the breath he was holding and stood up. He took one more look at the couch, and then turned to head for the stairs to his dorm, but it was too late.
I turned the knob and instantly I was met with the smell of something brewing. It was a sickly sweet smell that made me think of cough syrup. The shop itself was an assortment of shelves in no discernible pattern all strewn with vials and containers that held all manner of petrified body parts. The lighting was dim, as the only visible source was a wooden chandelier hanging from the middle of the shops ceiling.
(See the end of the chapter for
In the corners of the room were large marble sculptures of nude men and women which had been moved from their normal places in the library. An obvious show of power for the Dark Lord’s guest. The Malfoy’s, after all, were the wealthiest of the Dark Lord’s followers, so they must dine like Greek gods in order to showcase this wealth otherwise what good was it all?
“That’s probable,” Hermione chimed in. “Though if anything the trace spell should have locked onto the most recently casted magic and therefore shown up as a protection charm.”
“Harry, stop it. Harry,” came Ron’s voice again. He grabbed my wrists and pinned them together.
I shrugged. “We’ve done more with less, haven’t we?”
“Sorry,” Draco choked out. His throat was still dry. He scrambled to start unbuttoning again. The buttons weren’t cooperating though. He was stuck on the same one for awhile, trying to slip it through the hole.
After that, Harry did calm down. The familiarity of the party helped, along with the drinks Charlie kept bringing over. The liquor warmed him up quickly and it helped him relax enough that he was actually having some fun, despite the fact that every time he saw Draco holding that blokes hand he wanted to die.
“Harry, you okay?” Neville asked and crossed the room so he was standing directly in front of Harry, who was still nervously shuffling the Exploding Snap cards.
Most nights, Harry won and it always made Draco throw a tantrum. The first night had been a fluke. He decided it had been that he was distracted by the newness of it all because on the second night, he caught the snitch so quickly that the game was over before half past midnight.
The more Potter stood there looking at him, speaking to him casually, the more anxious Draco got. The worst part was that after Potter slapped him on the back, he rested his hand there for a moment. The soft pressure of the touch made him think of the roughness with which Potter had swung him around in the privy earlier. So juxtaposed, but still having the same effect on Draco’s breathing.
Ron gave me a curious look. I gave them a big ‘the prophet is here to take pictures’ smile. Hermione smiled back. Ron laughed.
Hermione and Ron arrived a moment later. They did look visibly winded. Ron clutched his side and a gasped for air. “Shite. I need to get back into the training program. Being Junior Auror in Charge has made me soft.”
“I didn’t ‘almost get killed.’ I got sucker-punched and she got away. And you cling to your precious protocol with such desperation you can’t see that it makes you a weaker Auror, unwilling to do the hard work when needed.”
“You’ll have about three minutes to make your speech,” Hermione said, sitting down at the table with two cups. She slid one over to Neville. “The
like every other dignitary the Dark Lord has collected to his side?”
“Well, I thought it was Ginny, too. I mean, she’s loved me since we were kids. She’s beautiful, and strong. I’d be lucky to marry someone like her. But...it’s different than it was before. I’m different than I was before.”
“Say that I do.”
When he stood upright again, Potter was finishing buttoning up the robe. He concentrated on each button, furrowing his brow. “Merlin this is a torture device.”
“Reed, wait,” I shouted. She stopped in her tracks and turned back to look over her shoulder. I was taking a gamble, but I needed to solve this and I couldn’t do that with a memory wipe. I turned to face Robards. “Look, I know you have no reason to trust me on this, but if you bring the Unspeakables here, they will cover this up.”
“Wasn’t it? You’ve made it perfectly clear that I’m inferior to you in your treatment of me as your partner, even though I try harder with you than I have ever tried with anyone. It’s never enough for you, and I doubt it ever will be.” Draco was trembling now, every part of him too awake with sensation. He wanted to run, to hide away until the potion left his system so he could go back to ignoring his feelings for Potter in peace.
, Draco mused,
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “And if you’ve never heard of it then it must not exist, right?”
I didn’t want to talk to him. Not now. Not after I’d let my lust, or whatever it was, distract me. A man was dead because I’d been thinking about him. “I’m
Draco’s cheeks flushed pink. He licked his lips, and asked, “Harry, what exactly are you saying?”
Malfoy placed the tea cup on the ground in front of him. He stood up and brushed his hands on the front of her trousers. “Well, we should…” he trailed off and nodded his head in the direction we came from.
“Why won’t the trace spells work?” Read asked after her latest attempt at casting one failed.
Another quiet moment passed between them—Harry watching Draco watch him. Around them, the air felt thick and hot. He wanted to say something else, but Draco twitched and started to pull his hand away, so Harry scooped the snitch out of Draco’s palm and pocketed it.
I could feel the pulse of my magic under my skin again. Seems being sober meant feeling every bit of my magic under my skin like electricity. “You’re the twat.”
Midnight seekers games became a regular thing for Harry and Draco after that night. They met at least twice a week, sometimes more, to fly around in the crisp midnight air. Harry kept it secret from his mates, simply because it was nice to have something that was his and only his—something he didn’t have to share with the whole wizarding world.
“But that seemed fitting, considering our whole relationship,” Neville added.
“You know, I think they are really happy together,” Hermione added. “Ginny seems better, doesn’t she? More in control. Parkinson is a good match for her temperament.”
He turned to face the cityscape. With his back to Pansy and the noises of the event inside, he let his face fall into a scowl.
Malfoy nodded, took out his wand and said, “Let’s end this.” On that, Harry was in total agreement.
Weaved into all of the challenges, friendship bloomed like wildflowers in a field. It was evident in their speech. Still bickering, but with greater understanding. Certain things were off limits and they stayed that way. Harry never mentioned Draco’s parents or the dark mark, and Draco stopped calling Harry a martyr. He had refused, however, to refrain from calling Harry ‘the Saviour’ because he claimed it was too bloody funny to see Harry roll his eyes whenever he did.
Hunching over to catch my heaving breaths, I glanced up to see Hezian standing in front of a glass desk, the bulk of his arms folded over his broad chest. Hezian’s frame was almost as tall as Harry’s, the dirty blonde of his hair perfectly styled in a wavy mess while he wore charcoal trousers and a fitted white  rolled up long sleeved button up shirt to reveal the tone of his muscled arms and the strength of his long legs. The eerie set of his cerulean eyes gazed down at my hunched form in that same calm confidence yet mischievous air he carried.
by the time I’m through with this shite.” I cursed out my words angrily, hunching forward to catch my breath and close my eyes from the nauseating sensation tingling in my stomach and the thudding pricks inside of my head that gave it a dull throb of pain.
Granger thought the idea was brilliant after I told her about my irritation with Harry for leaving me with a bunch of people I barely knew, how he fucked Cho Chang of all people, and how he comes to her on a daily fucking basis to get his cock wet. I also told the Gryffindor girl how Cho had insulted me and practically seethed about how useless I was for Harry.
“H-Harry!” I yelled out into the surrounding area, voice ricocheting off of the grey walls of the empty lab when the Gryffindor decided to ground his hips forward in a filthy motion, my eyes glazing over in unmistakable frenzied delight, my mouth dropping open to release a keening moan.
I stared up at Harry, the pale set of my lashes fluttering softly as I tried to not give into the urge to push myself further into the couch in hopes of having the furniture swallow me whole in the face of my ashamed embarrassment as well as my own vulnerability.
“Alright. You can do it. I’ll be giving you your wand so you can keep yourself safe. And if
we can talk.”

But I wasn’t happy about having a demon make me do things just so it could end up eating and killing me in the process. And I wasn’t happy about Zereth being the thing to open up a whole new perspective of myself.
of his finger into me and made me yelp into his domineering mouth.
But I started to notice how I’d watch his every movement when growing up around the princess. At the age of seventeen, my gaze would track down the slim, petite, deliciously small curves of the pureblood boy whenever he was in my vicinity, couldn’t help but watch him move gracefully on those long stripper legs of his with all that creamy crystal kissed skin he carried with him and those “fuck me”, wide moonstone eyes. The relentless arguments and fights we’d get in made the usually calm and collected restrained focus I held, crack at the seams, slowly. As if Draco and his haughty, bratty,
I didn’t have any experience in being intimate with anyone.
pass up. People here will eat you alive, Little Dove.” Krum’s voice hinted at an exasperation of sorts, as if he was reciting something from his own self created guidebook.
“You get drunk off of one shot, Darling. Go take an edible and calm your arse down before getting tipsy.” Pansy yelled back at me in the bemused lull of her tone, snapping her brown gaze back towards my person as she raised her brows in a teasing manner with her smile growing even bigger.
I had turned so red that Sirius had started to cackle like a bumbling witch and made cooing sounds towards me just to make me turn even more crimson.
Walking quickly away from the two Gryffindors and towards the door, I kept repeating the enchanted spell I had in mind in the confines in my head, seething the words mentally as I let my rage and embarrassment and untouched arousal filter my emotions strong enough to let the tiniest slip of wandless magic push forth and out of me.
Everything was dead, a massacre that left a pungent smell of decaying human and creatures, the scent strong and sour as it permeated throughout the whole of the room in a disturbing consume.
But that didn’t do shit for me.
Still trying to put up a front, I let out an indignant puff of air, pursing the plush of my lips to give away a mocking pout up at the Assassin as I gave a petulant response in turn to Harry’s words. “Fine.”
Before I could even think of tackling the man and taking in his own energy for myself or even observe him any further, the man disappeared from my line of sight.
. Fucking the gorgeous blonde that I’ve imagined plundering my cock into countless times for the sole reason of Kitten’s reassurance in my self control over my magic to keep him alive and myself sane. His begging for me did it. And his full faith of me made my restraint for him
And I'm sure he knew.
I let said game console separate from the clutch of my right hand to dangle about in my left one, causing the device to swing in a soft motion back and forth as I moved it to and fro in a subconscious act. The purse of my lips shaped around a small sounding “tsk” that escaped my mouth as I tilted my head to the side to give Blaise a disapproving appraisal, the tendrils of the silver snow white kissed shade of my long hair brushing across the slender of my shoulders in a sweeping feather light caress at my subtle action.
That made me
Harry was off of the bike and placing the kickstand back into place to keep Thanos from tipping over in a blink of an eye, the warmth of the assassin gone from my cooling body and the scorching touch of his hard chest absent over my back.
I was left on my own here and I was going to have to deal with my newfound mentality of my love towards killing someone.

I was still
Ready to be eaten alive by this predator in front of me.
Pressing my lips together, I frowned down at the mark.
I did my best to settle my features back into my signature look of a prissy Malfoy so I didn’t have to show anymore of my emotions out in the open in front of Sirius.
feeling I could formulate and pinpoint throughout my loss of perspective while being the sole thing that made my thoughts run rampant in chaotic fixation. He was a puzzle that had no discerning shape or size that I wanted to glue together. He was a continuous interest of mine that I knew I would never bore of and that both adrenalized my person and enticed me to be extremely cautious of him. Because Kitten made me
I didn’t want to admit my concern for Weasley’s well being. Apparition apparatus was an older version of the regular teleportation technique, taking much more magic from the person wielding the spell. It also was a sort of teleportation spell that didn’t make someone feel the need to hurl like I did every time I was put through the quicker apparating spell. Instead of popping into the given destination, the spell shows the area you are supposed to walk into in the space that you are about to leave, like walking through a door to another room. It took a large amount of magic though and made people too loose limbed instead of nauseous, taking quite some time to actually get the spell up and going instead of the more widely known shorter way wizards used today for apparating.
Everywhere.

Why was a man who looked like he was about to topple over any second now, covered in ripped clothes that shown the marrow of his boney figure, giving out riddles in the middle of winter in one of the various walkways belonging to Diagon Alley?
But then this sort of power got out of hand at times, like how it hurt my friends and how it was so adamant on both fucking and destroying a certain pretty little blonde Slytherin that had magic that rivalled the damn thousands of fires a dying star emitted from its very being.
And when I did, I figured I needed a really good explanation about what’s going on, because being surrounded by a crowd of people decked out in black armored uniforms really made my whole life even more complicated.
” I hissed out my desire with a quivering voice, the need laced into my tone making the Assassin groan out in a volatile rich sound.
that!” I couldn’t take my eyes off of the the way Potter poked out his tongue again to give another heated lick at the reddened blade, crimson streaking over the expanse of his seeking tongue. My cock was incessant on pushing through my clothes as my mind reeled at the sight of the man casually tasting someone’s blood and making it look downright filthy.
, the creature doubling over sideways with the side of his blank head simmering with a burnt black flesh color, smoke tangling itself away from the singe.
Harry waited for my touch.
Well I couldn’t back out of doing what I was going to do here in a moment.
With the boiling of my arousal now dwindling away from the rush of my actions, I simply left the knife in the man’s rectum as I withdrew my hand from his gaping wounded arse spewing copious amounts of blood. I let my other hand drag itself through the slush of intestines for a couple more seconds, enjoying the way the guts sloshed around in a slippery slope around the smooth texture of my fingers and palm before drawing it out of the man’s body too.
Harry wore fitted ripped black jeans, the tears of the fabric showing off the smooth skin of his knees, the material stretching comfortably across the flex of his thigh muscles and the tense of his strong long legs, pairing the jeans off with equally black combat boots. The jeans hung off the sharp dips of his hips, displaying the dark patch of hair that trailed down to his groin hidden beneath the pants, peaking slightly above the waistline in tantalizing sex appeal.
I whimpered out loud under the assault of Harry’s full dark attention, my face falling into a pained pathetic grimace.
And then the assassin spoke, voice monotonous yet
has started.
Harry chuckled lowly, the sound brutal in the way it resonated in my bones while he watched me with those green prehnite colored eyes of his. His voice boomed out over the noise of joyous jeers from the men, silencing them in a split second while he watched me. “Everyone get out. Show’s over.”
I darted out my tongue to quickly swipe the tip of it against the plush of my bottom lip in a way to calm myself down. I noticed the man’s caribbean eyes drag down to my mouth at the action and I silently cursed at myself in embarrassment and anger at making the guy think that I was interested with the way he probably thought I purposefully licked my lips to get his attention.
Harry Potter was going to be the death of me.
My mother would have skinned this beautiful women alive for her attire if she was her child.
“You are to stay in the guest room. No wandering about. Alright.” There was no question in the tone of Harry’s voice, just a demand.
This man’s cock was too much.
Ah. So the man knows me.
When the balls of my feet clashed with a leveled ground, my knees buckled the slightest bit, the air rushing past my lungs as I swayed from side to side, the wave of dizziness filtering through my head.
to see Draco in elated happiness.
I was going to die.
And that was true. We will only ever want one another.
And I fucking
The skin of my flesh went into a scorching temperature, the wet of my body quaking from where I stood, shocked and breathless as a high pitch ringing in my ears created a buzzing sensation to shimmer its way around the space of my skull, down the tip of my spine and into the warming space of my groin.
Because of me.
I was
“And. I. Like.
Sirius let out a sigh then, long and drawn out with the crease in his brow soothing into a transfixed composure as he eyed me with the press of his lips together in a consternation display. He raised his pointer finger to direct it towards my figure in an accusation like gesture. “You’re lucky that I could sympathize with you on having to stay in a place where you don’t want to be, given my whole experience of being trapped in a forest for a good three or so months. I’ll help you. But be aware that Harry is going to be out in the club when you leave as well, so be extra bloody careful to not be caught. Also, don’t get yourself killed, I rather like you alive since you’re all I’ve got family wise and since I don’t want to be murdered by Harry if you do end up dead. Got it?”
I did my best to not pay much mind to the people surrounding us.
over Harry’s lap while the man sat profusely still and let out a rumble of possessive malice, the assassin held himself rigid as if he knew not to move or else he could snap at any moment from holding back whatever it was he was restraining.
I gagged slightly, a small cough escaping my constricting throat as tears immediately sprung up in the corners of my eyes from the odor the demon’s mouth gave way to.
I could only focus on the pleasure.
There was no hesitation behind my resolve with Hezian’s orders for me.
The place before me had high ceilings and low, floating lanterns, each side of the walls having two sets of separated hallways that I could see doors line up against in rows.
, I-I-

happens, I want you to apparate inside the building and call out for me. I’ll find you immediately. And maybe I can have you drain someone of their dark magic to appease your own if anything were to go wrong for us to use that to our advantage. But we need to focus on getting the mission done. Do you understand me?” Harry’s words came out in a dark murmur, too quiet to be heard from Hezian’s position but enough for me to pick up with how close we were to each other.
Draco was a kindred soul. He too, had corridors in his mind that surpassed the material place of reality and imagination.
his damn cum out of me!
The redhead had the nerve to shrug and turn around on his heel to give me the view of his broad back. “Could have fooled me. Come on, time to leave.”
Sweat formed on his forehead as I slowly jerked him off, his dark brows furrowed as he watched me with his now messy black hair falling into his eyes,  peering at me through the dark curtain of his locks. His gaze glowed like a damn demon in the darkness of the night.
The assassin must have shown both Ron and Hermione his place during my time with the demon, my absence forcing them to work together in finding me and relighting their friendships once again as I assumed Harry yearned and hoped for. Something good coming out of my captivity at the least.
“I suggest you all get back to your own business. No one talks of this. And those who use magic, do yourself a favor and perceive the magic I left on this
I wasn’t being attacked.
With a quick flourish, I turned around to rid myself of my old gloves to put on a set of new ones since my poor hands had been sweating from having been put under the latex of the gloves for a good eight hours now.
I would think the man would be jealous with the fact that I found him attractive in his new body but he wasn’t. Instead, he was taking immense pleasure in making me blush ten fold with his fresh look.
It was a
Harry had been patient with me as I read through ingredients and theories of combined potions for certain charms and spells, the Assassin having vacated himself in the far left corner of the room as he lazed about over his own self magically created soft couch while he chewed away at a chocolate bar with almonds, perfectly content with being unhelpful with this whole process.
I whined out in a needy fixation, my lips sliding over the assassin’s in a heated stroke as I let my teeth drag over Harry’s bottom lip to suckle it into my mouth like he was my drug addiction, biting on it in a kittenish nip that seemed to kick the Gryffindor in gear with the way he let out a deep groan mingled together with a feverish growl that shook the very foundations of my bones, causing my whole body to tremble beneath him.
I watched Caetia’s jaw flex with a minute click, tensing as he swallowed profusely around an anxious gulp that I caught sight of with the way his Adam's apple bobbed prominently. Instead of backing away from me, Caetia decided to release a small huff of frustration as the hazel set of his eyes ripped away from my narrowed ones, looking down at the foyer and back up to me in a quick motion before speaking with a grit in his voice. “You want to let out some steam? Perhaps you should come with me to dance. And before you deny it, I’m going to say that you’re bloody gorgeous and that outfit you have on is
My heart thudded furiously beneath my chest, a dark whisper of prickling energy buzzing like livewire beneath my flesh as a sort of sick joy bubbled within the low pit of my gut.
The man knew I was desperate for work and the pay was significantly good for my living expenses. My boss was the only one who could make me do things I didn’t want to because he had power over me in terms of handling the money I earned.
Blinking rapidly, through the blur of my panicked vision covered in the slime and excess meat of the Carbonou creature that spewed its dead waste all over me not a few seconds ago, I saw Harry’s figure a few feet away from my own.
Sirius started leading me up the steps along with Caetia, right behind Harry’s retreating figure as he reached the top landing of the stairs and literally
I was going to be
But it just gave away a silent brutality that was unnerving in its calmness.
My voice shook with my panicked, rasp ridden words. “
Harry had looked worn out and completely disgruntled, the usually stone cold mask he held about himself torn away as a crease in his forehead slightly shown to display the amount of frowning he’s done lately, clearly worried about my physical and mental state and trying not to show it despite him being quite obvious about his distress for my health.
Potter ignored me.
Harry gave me a blank expression, defined features set into a harsh lines that shown the extent of his gorgeous structure, low lighting a dimmed halo that seemed to fade away into the blackness of the wall as shadows surrounding seemed to have been tainted from touching the sinister prominence of Harry’s essence.
The assassin’s body was a picture of immaculate strength and nonchalant severity that brought about a sense of leisure dormancy. Something that made me feel a dark exhilaration.
Harry had been
Sirius, thank gods, didn’t comment on my demonstration of vulnerability just a few minutes ago and instead, gave a sharp nod before turning around and angling his head in my direction to signal my person to follow him. “Let’s tell Caetia what’s happening, let him get the clothes, and let you have some fun.”
People swarmed the space from each nook and cranny of the house, dancing above us to the bass of the music, sensual and sultry in its tones as they breathed in each other’s sweat and rubbed over one another’s skin, chest to chest and groin to groin, arse grinding back against the front roll of someone’s rolling hips.
creatures, most of the times against their own will because they would talk to them through mind meld and get them to lose their own sanity enough to martyr people for a creature or demon’s gain. The two children were made into becoming killers, powerful ones with the help of whatever dark magic the demon or creatures would give them and their own, and they didn't mind because of how they grew up without any love or affection. They were conduits for dark magic and given that elves loved to initiate themselves into the dark arts, the parents probably wanted to give their offspring a handful of that fucked magic.” Harry raised his brows then as he stared down at me with an unearthly intensity in the glow of his emerald, blood red eyes, causing my breaths to halt in my lungs as I tried sorting through what the assassin was telling me.
Deeming myself fit to go out into the public, I made sure to put on a pair of dark blue gloves to match my top and walked out of my apartment with a slam of my door, energy buzzing beneath my skin as I walked down the black colored metal balcony to climb down the stairs at the end of the hall. I wanted an apartment that wasn’t on ground level with the building, given the fact that I liked looking at the whole of the town from five stories high.
My cock filled with interest, perking up against the counter and causing my frame to tremble. “Wh-what are you doing?” My voice came out as a small squeak, breaths skittering as Harry angled his own hips flush against my arse, the warmth and press of his bulge settling in between the cleft of my arsecheeks and making me
Nope.
Harry must have conjured up lube wandlessly into me.
Blinking up at Harry from where I was perched upon his bike, I released a shaky breath, taking in the messy strands of the Gryffindor’s dark hair and the way the man looked like a slinking panther as he slipped his hands into the front pockets of his jeans with an intimidating cool indifference, the cords of his muscles shifting in the lazy movement he made, all composed and carnal in his dominating presence.
Deciding to just throw on a black short sleeved rock band T-Shirt with extremely short dark red sleep shorts, I deemed myself ready for bed. Surprisingly, I listened to the band etched out over the front of my shirt and everything fit me perfectly. I’m pretty sure the boxers that I got would fit me fine, though I didn’t wear them since I hated putting on underwear when going to bed.
Why am I feeling such … carnal warmth?
Sirius’ dark eyes swept over my body for a splitting minute before settling onto Harry’s with a narrow of his gaze, the crinkle at the corners of his eyes portraying that of constricted anxiety, weariness and a hint of fear as he spoke in a low whisper among the hell scramble of pained screams surrounding us now. “I’ll keep him safe. You do your job with Granger and Weasley.”
Draco’s response came out slightly more playful than he intended it to be when he said,“You may prefer the responses that way. I am sure you are much better company than I.”
The smack was so jarring over my thigh that tears had immediately sprung up in my stricken, dazed gaze, water gathering there as I sucked in a sharp breath when I heard Neville give a dark shush my way like I was his naughty fucking child, his words rumbling over my flesh like a searing touch, his voice a rumbling amused tone. “Don’t cry out so loudly, you don’t want people coming in here and seeing you look like this."
Whipping my head up, my eyes zeroed in on the scene that took place in front of me.
Why couldn't I hear it?
The Gryffindor was bloody
Climbing up the stairs, that same pungent smell of a Carbonou permeated through my senses, making the line of my back break out in shudders on anticipated horror when I jolted against Harry’s side as my ears were suddenly intruded upon with the sounds of gutted screams.
I watched Harry through my low lidded gaze, a sizzling heat playing beneath my skin that had my breath quickening and arousal lulling awake in my groin as the Gryffindor turned around from the sink he stood in front of to face me, the laze like movement slow and confident.
My arse was fine as it was, not too big and just the perfect amount of plumpness at the cheeks. I was slim, having come at an average height with proportionally long legs and pale, light flesh that was splattered in freckles everywhere across the creamy expanse of my skin that I didn’t mind or thought much about.
despite how much I denied it, I loved how fucking
The assassin easily lifted me up over his shoulder with his one hand, the action causing his fingers to slip into the torn fabric further and curve around my arse to settle close to the space between my cheeks, eliciting a shudder to run down my spine and a spasm like wiggle of my lower half to
A sense of unadulterated fear lunged into my stomach, rapacious and violent with a searing abhorrent fire that licked up the inner skin of my thighs and every nook and cranny of my jelly like limbs.
My heart was hammering hard, not from arousal this time, but from a anxious, confused cadence.
I straightened up on weak limbs, avoiding Harry’s gaze that I’m sure wasn’t even focused on me because the Gryffindor barely gives me any attention for a certain amount of time before completely disregarding me. I’m surprised he even interacted with me for more than five minutes.
. “If I touch you, my magic stirs with a deep rooted hunger and I don’t mind it, I get off on it. Like I said, I’ve given into the fact that I’m fucked up, and my magic likes that I’m screwed in the head so it can roam around more freely in its quest to feast upon others energy and magic since I don’t mind it. But with you … my magic tends to go too far with its sadistic delight and becomes enraged with a starvation. It always goes out of sorts and has the want to take all of what you are, and end up killing you. I don’t want that. Everytime I’m near you, I have to hold back my powers from tearing into you in a way that I prefer it didn’t. My magic goes crazy when I touch you because it could feel your pure energy more and makes it go into a savage rampage than when it doesn’t physically touch you through my body. I’ve struggled with it all these years and I’m cautious about being near you because of it. If I have sex with you,
you want to stop, Draco. What? You can’t handle a little bit of a punishment you’ve been itching for since we’ve collided with each other’s lives all over again? Tell me, what’s going on in that witty head of yours.” Harry was
And then I registered what Harry just said.
A shiver, hot and heavy, trickled its way down the length of my arched back, causing a riotous tremble to shudder throughout the entirety of my body and my thighs to clench around the hard of Harry’s hips.
And now, as I feel the energy of my magic coalesces around me in electrifying sparks, there is that same doubt nestling in the pit of my gut of what I knew was to come about my actions.
“I’m sorry I had to make you go through all of that,” I whispered brokenly, an uncomfortable lodge stuck in my throat as I recalled everything that happened for the past month in my own head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We both know you like it when I touch you.” Harry’s words came out in a lighter pitch than his normal deep gravel of a voice, his new body’s words etched in a mediating low drawl, careless and hinting at a tease.
.” I breathed my words out, rapturous and imploring in my gratitude towards Harry’s words and the way he let himself be vulnerable in his mental state around me, holding me and reassuring my safety, my body pressed languidly against Harry’s chest as I let the now soft breathes escaping my mouth flutter across the shirt the assassin had on.
Instead, I heard a significant squawk of agony and wrenched my eyes open to stare down at a writhing, fallen vampire sprawled out over the freezing floor with his body twitching in a series of shivers. The curve of his jaw was dangling from its hinges, swinging back and forth with each violent shake of his paralyzed shape, grunting and giving out choked screams that had the entirety of the town looking on with gaping mouths of horror and confused awe.
There were also suspension beams and a few St. Andrew’s Crosses.
I let the door shut behind my person, closing it softly behind me since it was much more quiet in this room with alternative rock playing in the speakers mounted against the walls with magic in every top corner.
I felt my skin turn crimson at the cool air that slipped its way up between the fine tremor of my exposed thighs and over what felt like lace panties covering my prick. Garter belts, shimmering in the midnight shadow of its black color curved diagonally down the slope of my arsecheeks to hook its silver clasp at the intricately lace designed onyx stockings, letting my pale skin peek through the spaces the sheer fabric introduced around my thighs and legs.
Harry touching me has made me gone fucking bonkers.
Of course Hezian would want me to make a potion that can knock out a good couple thousands of people.
The few of my housemates that were very much liked and forgiven, were Blaise and Pansy, including a few others.
The hard line of my cock pressed against the top of his powerful thigh and I shivered.
I was both enthralled and cautious.
The essence of the magic was familiar, but more foreboding and menacing.
I took in the way Harry’s forearms tightened with his lean muscles, veins protruding a little against the strain of his movement as those breathtaking eyes found mine again. “That’s a story for another time, it’s rather long and not something I like talking about, Kitten.” The voice that Harry conjured up was null and void, the way his mouth thinned out into a non expression of emotion causing my stomach to churn with anxiety and concern, seeing the man before me start to close up the walls he’s so intricately built back up around him.
And couldn’t help but start laughing out of the pure insanity that just came out of Harry’s mouth, a bubble of affection and astonished fearful audacity from everything that was
“I’m sorry, but I really can’t. I need to finish this damn project.” I murmured out my words now, my gaze shifting away from Blaise’s so I wouldn’t have to look at his attempt at giving me sad puppy eyes and letting my concentration rear towards the dangling of my Nintendo Switch in my hand.
“I-I was going to say, thank you f-for making me y-yours, Erus.” I breathed out my words in a tiny sob, words spluttering out of my lungs practically when Harry rocked his hips forward in a motion oh so similar to the many times he had fucked me, with my face down and arse up.
“How did you get the papers to Trisko? You were the last to see him before someone found him dead, if I’m correct with the information I’ve gathered.” The Auror looked at me with a narrow in his light brown eyes, obvious suspicion etched deep into the creases of skin beside his eyes. And that made me pissed off.
I rolled my eyes in response, a small smile playing at the corner of my lips as I swept the loose strands of my hair away from my face by tugging them back to rest behind my ears, the long silver locks free from the low ponytail I had put it into during school earlier today.
I simply blinked.
There were people surrounding a large round wooden table, cards displayed out on the tables or perched in their hands as they spoke lowly and calmly to each other. Cigarettes, blunts, and cigars either were hanging out the purse of the mens' lips, in their fingers, or resting in ashtrays.
Harry spoke then, his voice rumbling in the wicked tundra of his words, causing my eyes to snap back over to the relaxed and confident form of Harry’s powerful body, my own trembling at the sound of his voice. “Krum and the members of his club can smell you out. Krum made a potion for him and his customers to have the knowledge of who has been untouched and who has fucked in their span of lifetime. They dab it beneath their nose and can gain the ability to decipher which one is which, for personal preference in knowing who they want to go after, a virgin or a sexually experienced person.”
And my prick was throbbing at his orders.
I had let my hair down, the pale blonde strands streaming down to the middle of my spine now with how long it had gotten. I had Catia help me straighten my hair and makeup, creating a bit of black eyeliner with a smoky lid flecked in shimmering silver glitter to make the color of my moonstone eyes pop.
This man was infuriating and consistently brutal with every speech he made.
Harry eased his heated finger from out of my hole, a gushing squishing noise popping out of my pucker as I felt a trail of lube slip its way down between my bumcheeks, a filter of air caressing the enlarged aching rim of my hole, loose and gaping from the finger fucking it was put under a mere few seconds ago.
Flashes of images played like a livewire of electricity across my eyes when I stared down at the broken porcelain doll lying across the wet linoleum floor, of how I could easily drag the slim thing by the small of his ankles, turn him around and shove my cock into him, rough and without mercy as I turn him into a meat sock for my dick to fuck until Draco was left drooling and bleeding out. To desecrate and shed him of every thought until he shown me the innocence he carried within him.
The assassin released a languid groan, filthy and downright predatory as he went even faster and harder, fucking his cock into me like an untamed beast. His dick practically slaughtered my insides as his thrusts became so powerful that the wall behind me cracked from the force of his thrusts, my back aching from the pain of it slamming profusely against it, spine tingling and cut up.
“I would not expect you to have noticed,” Nikola said. He turned away from Potter and fixed his gaze again on Draco. Licking his bottom lip, he said, “He is nothing compared to someone like you whose beauty will not be ignored. You must always be the most pleasant looking thing in the room.”
“I’m serious. This whole festival is making me cranky. All the bonfire jumping and excessive revelry. Everyone is having more fun than me, and they’re all excited for their futures, and I’m just…existing.”
Stag night: there’s drinking (surprise, surprise), there’s karaoke (Dean and Seamus put on a show), and then there is a little something between Harry and Draco (more emotions...:D).
“Merlin,” Draco breathed out, “Potter, I—“
“I want you, Draco. All of you. Say yes, Draco. Just say yes. I’ve given you time to think about what our relationship will be like after school, but I can’t keep waiting like this. I’m ready  to tell everyone now.” Harry knew he sounded crazed, desperate, but now that he’d started, he couldn’t stop himself. “Move in with me. It’s not like it will change that much. We already sleep together most nights.”
The Succubus was attempting Thaumaturgy, a kind of magic that fell out of use in Europe around the turn of the century thanks to the focus on wand magic. Doing something on the small scale, and having it happen on the large scale. Using something to represent how the magic should be focused. It’s ultimately what a wand did, but with less ritual than something like what the Succubus was attempting.
not in the mood, Malfoy.”
Draco panted, trying to steady his breath. “Uh, so where are we on ‘how silly the fire myth is’? I know we said totally, but how sure are we
He was not going to switch with Thomas or Finagean. He had seen their idea of cleanliness after sharing a common room with them all year and dreaded the idea of wearing clothes that smelled like they had never been washed properly.
“Pshh, Ron’s a light—” Hermione started and hiccuped. She turned to Ron and smirked. “You’re the lightweight, darling.”
Ron and Hermione were such different people, sometimes I wondered how they made it work. Ron always saw the best in people. Hermione saw the flaws in them. She was unforgiving and sturdy as a mountain in her beliefs. Ron was accepting and flexible. It really shouldn’t work, but it did. I knew it went deeper than shared trauma because if that was all it took, Ginny and I would have found a way back to each other after the war.
St. Mungo’s was quiet. The Spell Damage Ward’s patients all seemed to be sleeping. When they arrived, a Healer swooped Potter away, telling Draco to wait there. It all felt like it happened in slow motion. Draco felt the potion waning, leaving him a bit drained and very sore. Pansy had said it might last seven hours, but it was more like three, but if she’d had that final day to tweak things, he was sure it would have been seven. He felt like he needed to sleep for about a week.
“I guess if you want to simplify everything.”
“Probably.”
Potter’s head snapped around to the mausoleum entrance. He swayed under the too quick movement and grabbed his head. “Robards?”
“There’s nothing here.” I stood upright and looked around the stream. The forest was quiet. There was a tinge of evil to the silence in the forest, menacing even, but under that there was something serene. That was magic. That was all of magic as far as I’d seen. The capability for both good and evil, light and dark. It felt fitting that ambient magic was gray since magic wasn’t one thing or the other, it was all in how we used it.
“Understood. May I go?”
“Occasionally, I do get information from you that benefits the Dark Lord, so it’s all in a days work. I don’t expect a muggle like you to understand the honor bestowed upon me and my family,” Draco spouted the company line at Granger, not that he believed it.
the Succubus had mentioned? It had to be, even though Harry couldn’t remember ever actually thinking about Malfoy while he was touching himself. Sure, there was that one time after Malfoy got assigned to him when they were dueling in the training rooms and Malfoy kicked his arse but good. He’d wanked in the showers after, thinking about their fight. But that didn’t mean...did it?
“Yes, Mr. Potter,” Draco said. His voice caught in his throat. He was unbearably cold now, but held himself tall. If Mr. Potter were going to reject him, he would make sure he kept his dignity at least. If Mr. Potter had simply wanted to dance with Draco and nothing more, he would accept that. He would manage.
“Is that your roundabout way of saying yes?”
“Oh, Malfoy!” Hermione looked newly shocked. “His potion.”
“I went there on three separate follow ups to illegal magical usage, Ron. Three.
Neville nodded and placed the clippers on the top of the hedge. There were dirt spots on his face and a layer of sweat glistening on his skin. His white button up shirt was untucked and had small patches of sweat at the chest and around the collar. I found his eyes mirrored my own. There were deep purple bags there. I hadn’t noticed them the other day at the memorial, but that kind of exhaustion doesn’t pop up after one night’s sleeplessness.
Dead birds. Harry mulled over what that could mean. Usually, animal deaths happened when someone was messing with Black Magic. It signalled a power imbalance, if he remembered Hermione’s lecture properly. Since the Succubus was the embodiment of Black Magic after compromising her human self for immortality, it could be that her magic mixed with the Ley Lines was creating the imbalance.
Weasley posed a similar problem to Thomas and Finagean. Draco wasn’t sure how clean the clothes were, even though begrudgingly he had to admit Weasley’s outfit was the least dreadful of the bunch as he wore a traditional dress robe much like the one Draco wore.
Ginny figures out Harry's secret: he loves Draco Malfoy. So, she confronts him and asks him what he is going to do about it. Harry has no idea.
I walked closer, stopping directly in front of him. He stood taller than me even without being a step up, so I had to crane my neck. “If they knew what I was really like, I doubt they would have a parade for me.” I’d meant it to sound defiant, but it sounded self-depreciating.
I nodded in response and he headed toward the house, leaving me on my own. My only advantage was that no one had noticed me yet. If I was going to sneak away from this party to check out Skeeter’s lead at the cemetery, I’d have to go now. I decided to head back toward the maze and the forest. It would be easy enough to hop the hedge and follow the tree-line to the cemetery. We were a three minutes walk from it.
Abruptly, Mr. Potter twirled Draco out and pulled him back in—the motion sent a thrill through Draco that could only be compared to jumping from a cliff. Upon contact, Mr. Potter smiled. “I am curious to hear such compliments.”
damage has been done,” Draco whispered as he leaned in close to Potter’s face. Then he licked his lips, savoring the moment, and added, “Well, not physically anyway.”
“Your suggestion about adjusting the amount of bitter root to snowdrop ratio is what got me into the last phase.” Malfoy extended his hand and Hermione took it. They shook once and then released.
Harry, careful to cast a Disillusionment Charm this time, snuck quietly around the side of the mausoleum nearest the dead birds. He peered inside and saw what looked like a squatter’s den. It was empty, so he went inside to get a better look.
“Because…” Draco considered saying ‘because I want this partnership to work out,’ but he decided on, “We are partners, and that’s what partners do.”
“You’re in pretty good shape for someone whose head is so far up their arse they run into a dangerous forest chasing down what is shaping up to be a murderer, apparently.”
“Have either of you been to Russia?” Nikola asked, but he was no longer looking at Lucius. Instead, he was watching Draco with a handsome grin on his face. The shift in attention was noticed by his father who straightened his back and did his best not to look perturbed by the slight. Lucius, while still attractive, had nothing in comparison to Draco’s sharp and striking features, many of which he inherited from his mother. His looks were the one thing keeping him alive, Draco thought bitterly. Well, his looks and his predilection for witty repartee and strategizing.
Hermione fire-called, her hair half done, to say I needed to look presentable since the papers would be there, so I tried to flatten out my hair a bit, but it was more stubborn than usual, so I gave up and hoped it was good enough.
“Please, Harry, be safe,” Ron asserted. He held out a hand and waited for me to take it. He squeezed hard once and then released.
Ron perked up. “Traces.”
He looked around and saw some discarded clothes in a corner; a few sparkling dresses that no doubt fit the Succubus much like the slinky black dress he’d met her in. A shiver ran up his spine at the memory. Kissing her had felt so good, and if he hadn’t been lucky...he would have let her kiss him until he was as dead as everyone in this cemetery.
Draco, hoping to lighten the mood a bit, plastered his best lopsided grin across his face and said, “You say the sweetest things, partner.”
Hermione grabbed my arm. She was still standing on the cemetery side of the wall. “Harry, we shouldn’t go in there. You know better than anyone that the forest is dangerous. And a black trace can’t mean anything good.”
Then Draco nodded slowly and a smile blossomed across his face.
Potter sighed. “Lots of reasons. Too many people saw me as ‘
Draco felt his stomach react. Whatever had lodged there earlier, released itself and was making its way north and settling in his chest. It felt like a dozen fairies fluttering against his rib cage.
Ned smiled his soft smile at Malfoy. “That and the whole walking in like you own the place. Aurors tend to do that. Plus, I’m a Squib. No magic myself, but I can spot a wizard a mile away just fine.” He ended with a wink that was both charming and innocent.
“Then they’re fools. I’ve seen you work. You’re the most precise person in our class. It’s like you have magic fingers.” Ryder laughed, his voice talking on a huskier tone.
Thinking about his old partner made his gut twist. He had died jumping in front of a curse meant for Harry. They’d tracked a few of Voldemort’s old followers, zealots really, who had started a cult of sorts, worshiping the dead wizard. It should have been an easy in-and-out operation. The intel had said they were unorganised and mostly Squibs, but when they’d arrived at the abandoned house the followers called home… they had been ambushed with a barrage of spells. Dean had told Harry they should fall back, but Harry had insisted they could take them, so they pursued. They nearly had them all bound when someone cast off an
live fourth year down?”
Befor the article Luna is working on gets published, Harry decides to visit Neville, whose new employee just happens to be dating Draco.
Malfoy’s eyes lit up with relief. “He speaks. Well done, now tell me what your hand is doing so close to my face.”
“It’s okay. I have the time.”
I ran to him and caught him before he hit the ground. His hands wrapped around my shoulders, gripping hard. A tremor ran down my spine when he touched the skin of my neck and I felt the urge to kiss him again. He yanked his foot out of the rotted tree and we both stumbled a bit from the force. I slipped my hands around his middle tighter, pulling him close. His eyes flicked up from the forest floor to my eyes. I let myself fall into them for a moment, forgetting where we were or why. The muscles of his back were taut and I felt them under my touch as he worked to move back from me. I released him even though my whole body screamed at me to hold him closer.
“Black, are you sure?”
Harry wanted to say something back, but before he could, their boss, Head Auror Robards, walked in and he looked about as happy as someone who had just gotten a root canal and came out to find a parking ticket on their car. He marched up to the large map of London hanging on the board at the front of the conference room and settled his gaze on the group. The map of London had red dots to indicate the locations of the recent murders in Harry’s case.
,” Malfoy whispered and bit down hard on his bottom lip. Harry watched as the man’s eyes darted from Harry’s lips back up to meet his gaze.
my job. You’d know that if you’d let me do more than file your paperwork and chase after you like a lost crup. You’re not the only one who cares about solving this case. Or any case, for that matter.”
engage, right?”
Harry Potter.’” Draco couldn’t stop the words from coming anymore than he could stop himself loving Potter. They flowed from him freely as if the potion broke a dam of emotion that had been the only thing keeping him sane.
Draco raised his brows, either in disgust or appreciation, placed his robes over the back of the bench, then sat down next to Harry. He leant forwards, rested his elbows on his thighs, and sighed. “What a sight, huh? Granger and her little squad of committee members have really outdone themselves. The whole damned hillside is on fire.”
Draco sneered at him, narrowing his eyes. “Maybe a week. Maybe longer. Who knows? It’s not like I was counting the days,
The sky, even lit as it was in starlight, felt endlessly dark. The expanse much like looking out at the ocean. It made Harry feel small, but Draco—he seemed to take up all the space in the night sky. Everywhere Harry looked he saw the flash of white-blonde hair and was instantly reminded of a hummingbird flitting around flowers in search of nectar. His speed had improved since their last time playing one another two years ago. For a moment, Harry felt stupid because clearly Draco had been practicing while Harry was as out of practice as they came.
“Just blink twice if you’re being coerced to say such pessimistic things. I promise I can help,” Draco teased, still leaning over Harry.
Draco turned to Pansy. She shrugged at him seemingly uninterested. Then Draco returned his gaze to Harry. “How about we meet later to talk?”
“I’m better off alone anyway,” Harry snapped.
“I swear to—are you serious?”
“And you don’t have to stay that long, especially if you’re tired, Harry. You should really try to sleep.”
He was embarrassed by his own unashamedly childish hopes that his feelings might, even in some small way, be reciprocated by Mr. Potter though his earlier rejections of Draco’s letters still hung in the air like so many unpleasant scents.
Leaning in so their foreheads touched, Harry paused in front of Draco’s lips—breathing in the scent of the apple Draco had been eating.
Harry choked on whatever it was he had intended to say to Hagrid. It was lost now anyway. His throat was dry again. He was transfixed. He stood motionless under the scrutiny of Malfoy’s stare.
“You won’t,” Potter said through gritted teeth. “I will never willingly help you.”
“Hah! Very funny. I can be full of hate and loathing, too. It is
Harry reached a hand out and covered Draco’s fist. Underneath his hand, he felt Draco open his fingers and the soft flutter of the snitch’s wings hit his skin. For a moment, Harry lingered there—the snitch trapped between their palms. The moment felt like an eternity—like there were thousands of years in between the seconds.
Malfoy turned to face Ron. His voice was matter of fact, clinical. “You wife is quite right. If you want Harry safe then you need to let us concentrate.”
Clearly Robards hadn’t been expecting an agreement. His mouth hung open and his brow arched up towards his hairline. “Then what happened?”
The man tilted his head back to rest on the stone wall, giving her better access to his neck. “God, you’re so hot.” He took one hand away from her arse and slid it up her hip, slowly dragging his fingers along the hem of her dress.
. Draco decided he was definitely going mad.
“The pOrion’s partners clause that says you have to do what I say,” Potter quipped. His mouth turned up into a smirk that was dangerously handsome. He stopped walking and turned to face Draco now.
In the back of Dean and Seamus’s yard, behind some more mystical creature statues that almost functioned like a wall, there was a miniature hedge maze. The hedges came up to my chest so you couldn’t get lost in there unless you were a small child. I spotted Neville at the back of the maze bending over the hedge with clippers in his hands. I needed to go through the maze to get to him and even though I knew I wouldn’t get lost, all I could think about was fourth year and that maze and Cedric. It took me a full minute to force one foot in front of the other.
Draco turned and saw the person who the voice belonged to was, in fact, not a student but Amelia Kharkov, a past headmaster of Durmstrang and a ghost. She had been young to be head of a school, possibly in her late forties, when she died nearly a hundred years ago. Her hair matched Draco’s in length, dropping to her shoulders. Though she wore hers tied back with braids, something he thought Luna would approve of. She had a long nose that ended in a dramatic point. On someone else it would seem out of place, but somehow on her, it fit. She wore robes with no embroidery, no embellishment. If one weren’t paying attention, she would simply blend into the background.
That’s when he came to his senses. He wasn’t sure if it was the woman’s cry or the rain pounding down, soaking him through, that brought him out of it. Maybe it was dumb luck. Whatever it was, he was thankful. What was he thinking? He was kissing a Succubus, a killer, letting her siphon his Life Energy. It wouldn’t permanently harm him, but it would feel like someone took a sizable chunk of his ability to use magic while his Life Energy healed.
—The issue is that he and I cannot work, Pansy. Would never. We are not compatible. He is too proud to condescend himself to my station and accept such an undesirable match as I. My family ties alone should be reason enough to avoid me, but add on the fact that he could not even bring himself to accept my invitation for dinner and ask yourself this question: How could we ever get passed those issues which I have laid before you?”
“The beast?” Malfoy asked.
Through his laughter at Harry’s awkward attempt at shaking the snow from himself, Malfoy managed to say, “Merlin, Potter, first your hearing is clearly off and now you cannot trust your own sight? Pity.”
“No clue.” Ron shrugged. “Mine went wonky, too. It was like it didn’t know where to focus.”
As soon as he had taken the potion, Draco knew he was in trouble. On a good day, he had no trouble pushing away his attraction to Potter, ignoring it until he could go home and indulge the fantasy. But today wasn’t a good day. He could hardly focus around Potter as it was, and if Potter kept touching him, Draco knew he would lose it. The second Potter’s hand made contact with his shoulder, the warmth in Draco’s gut surged and he grew erect. He hadn’t gotten hard that fast since third year.
“Merlin, I don’t know whether to be impressed or concerned,” a drawling voice came from behind Harry. He turned to see Draco Malfoy wearing a formal-looking royal blue suit, tailored to perfection, with the top-most buttons of his pale blue dress shirt undone. His robes were draped carefully over one arm. “Did you just finish off your whole cup in one sip?”
“Fine, yes,
Once under the cloak, Harry had found himself regretting, again, the bad luck of getting roped into this, for he found himself in closer quarters with Malfoy than he ever intended. Every bit of Harry that touched Malfoy felt like fire. His thigh on Malfoy’s. His elbow knocking into Malfoy’s. Even their shoulders touching in an uncomfortably intimate way. He was breathing in Malfoy’s breath and smelling the lingering soapy smell of someone who was freshly showered. It had been overwhelming and when Malfoy, in an attempt to communicate without words, turned to Harry and raised his brow to ask
The walkway was also cobblestone with small bright yellow flowers bordering it. We followed it to the wooden door and even on the threshold, I could hear the sounds of conversation that indicated a large group of people in a small space.
No letter of acceptance arrived. Draco waited many a fortnight. He would spend hours making excuses for Mr. Potter’s absence in reply. Possibly the man was caught up on business. Or possibly, he was engaged in hunting as it was mid-season and men like Mr. Potter enjoyed the hunt quite thoroughly. Maybe the letter had not reached Mr. Potter. Maybe it was lost and the lack of acceptance was not a slight, but a misunderstanding.
“No, I don’t want to talk. All we’ve done all year is talk about what life would be like when school was over. I want to know. I want to act.” Harry squeezed Draco’s hands in his, brought them to his lips and kissed Draco’s knuckles. He lowered his voice to a whisper. “I want you. Don’t you want me?”
“Swear.”
Finally Neville settled on Hermione and answered. “Cla—classes are good. We are doing mandrakes with the second years. I’m sure you remember that lesson fondly.” He laughed at his own joke and Hermione followed.
“So calm down and flirt with me, Harry Potter,” Charlie winked and continued, “and make that blonde git as jealous as he clearly has made you.”
“Merlin, it’s good to see you,” Seamus said slapping my shoulder. “It’s been ages. I don’t think you’ve come ‘round since the wedding. And before that it was months since we saw you. How’ve you been?”
awkward and at least we’d know?”
Still looking around the small kitchen for evidence of a fly, or something, Harry asked, “How do you tell someone you fancy them without looking like a complete oaf?”
I whispered, “I don’t know, but we need to do something before someone else dies.”
Harry blinked back the headache that throbbed just behind his eyes and tried to stand. He could only make it to all fours before the world spun on its axis, and he felt vomit rise to his throat. Shite. He was no good to his partner if he couldn’t stand up. Without looking to aim, he gathered his magic, all he had left, and shouted, “
“I suppose I could be convinced to beat you again, Potter,” Draco said, shoving the snitch into Harry’s hand. For a moment, Draco’s hand lingered. His fingers against Harry’s palm—then he was turning away and heading off the pitch.
“You’re a—you’re a bit close, Potter,” Malfoy whispered, there was still a snowball rolled up in his hand which was mid-throw. His voice sounded strained like he had just woken up from a particularly good dream. One he was struggling to rip himself from. For a moment, Harry pictured Malfoy, in silk pajamas because the prat totally would have silk pajamas, with pillow lines on his face.
I took another deep breath and felt more in control. “We’ll talk later.” I lied. It was shitty, but I couldn’t take the pity in Hermione’s eyes any longer. She smiled softly, either believing me or deciding not to push it more.
Lips still touching, Potter whispered, “So?”
“Even so, the effects can be rather distracting, Potter.” Pansy put her hands on her hips. She was ready to snap at him, Draco could see it in her eyes. “Like I said, it takes that existing attraction and brings it to the forefront. If you have accepted that attraction, you will be in better control of the effects, but if not...”
“Oh, Adeline Greyjoy? She's a wild one. Nuttier than Trelawney, but a better seer. Word is she used to be an Unspeakable, but no one can confirm or deny that one for obvious reasons.”
“To me that says he shouldn't care about what I’m doing.”
Before Malfoy could respond, the door burst open and Harry braced himself for the pursed lips and devastating look of disappointment in McGonagall's’ eyes, but instead found himself looking at Hagrid wearing a Santa cap.
Malfoy asked, “Did you garden before you arrived?” He tilted his head to the side and looked like he was trying to remember something but couldn’t quite place whatever it was he had tried to remember.
It was The Battle of Hogwarts Memorial Day, and the only remembering I wanted to do was remembering where I threw the file I was looking at last night before I passed out on my desk in an alcohol induced slumber. I’d been at work late, again, looking over my files on recent surges in underage magic usage looking for any explanations, any patterns, for the uptick in reports when Ron Weasley, auror, ass-kicker, and all around my best mate in the world (next to Hermione Granger, of course), had come in and suggested we drink away the blasted ‘memories’ and I had obliged like the daft idiot I was and vaguely remember us shouting ‘screw the memories, screw bloody paperwork’ after our fifth shot and tossing everything off of my desk in a flurry of papers after our seventh. It had seemed logical at the time, but standing in the office looking at the disarray, I wondered why I let him talk me into trashing my desk and not his.
Harry thought about it, about drowning out the odd feeling that was settling in around him and then thought about the hangover he would be sure to have in the morning. “Not right now, thanks.”
“Harry,” Draco said, his tone a warning. “I don’t respond well to ultimatums.”
“They went on like three dates, Potter.”
“That’s not true, Gin. Works been...I’ll get to it. I promise.”
The Potions lab at the Ministry was, similarly to Hogwarts, in the basement, though that’s where the similarities stopped. Where Hogwarts was all gothic—high ceilings, dim lighting, and old dusty books—the Ministry’s potions lab was clinical with white walls, hard metal counters, and more conventional equipment that didn’t look like it had been used in the Middle Ages.
Malfoy looked like a deer in headlights. He blinked furiously for a moment and then his brain seemed to catch up with him. “Was that you asking me out?”
I shook my head. “Lamont.”
“Okay, so the way it works is I will dare you to do something and you have to do it, otherwise you drink from this bottle until we say stop.” Potter held up a bottle of a familiar brown liquid that Draco hadn’t seen him grab. There was no label on it and it looked like it was missing nearly half its contents. Draco recognized it as the bottle Potter had when he was in the bathroom earlier and suddenly everything was making sense.
“Oh, yes. He is such a mercurial man. I imagine that article about you and Ginny did not sit well with him.”
Before Draco could answer, Luna appeared at his side. Her eyes alight with something bordering on mischievous. Her white-blonde hair, only outmatched in its ethereal nature by Draco’s, flowed around her like a curtain of spun silk. “Hi, Draco.”
every time someone picked it up. The sound went off nearly continuously. Draco watched as some Beauxbaton’s boy in a pale yellow dress robe picked up the bottle, let it
Then I told Robards and he laughed in my face. Every time I showed up to ask what caused the surge, the kid was freshly beaten, but he was too scared to say anything. Just nodded along when his father claimed he got hurt playing. The bastard had obviously abused him for years and knew he could get away with it because no one ever questions the word of a Ministry official. They think they are all above the law. How is that just?”
Draco straightened up from checking his trainers and shrugged his shoulders. Licking his bottom lip, he responded casually, “Yeah. Thought you would like it since it’s muggle fashion.”
“Mother,” Draco forced himself to say. Seeing her was still hard. It made him tense up thinking about the last time he had seen her alive. How she pleaded with Lucius to lie to the Dark Lord. But of course, Lucius refused her and all but sealed her fate.
From that far away, Harry could see every feature on Malfoy’s face. The small lines at the corner of his eyes. The gray of his iris’ surrounded by a ring of black with blue-ish flecks that made his eyes look billowy like smoke billowing from a fireplace. A small sprinkling of freckles across his cheeks and nose, which was pointy, but also elegant. Thin, pink lips that Harry found himself looking at for a beat too long.
“What a dirty mouth, Potty. Wonder what other dirty things it’s capable of?”
The only thing racing through Harry’s mind as they waited in line behind some sixth years Harry didn’t know, was the fact that Draco was still holding his hand. The need for it had expired the second Draco led Harry to the line, yet there it remained, wrapped around Harry’s hand, the faint pulse in Draco’s wrist pumping against Harry’s own.
Running out of ideas, Harry leaned his head forward to rest his forehead against Malfoy’s. Their noses brushed slightly and Harry let his eyes flutter closed. For a moment, he let himself savor Malfoy’s quiet breathing and the sweet smell of Malfoy’s breath.
“Earth to Potter?” Malfoy snapped. “Can we do this before the potion wears off? I’d rather not become lunch for a hungry Succubus.”
Ron lowered his voice and touched my forearm gently. “Harry, are you okay?”
Luna laughed lightly, tilting her head down to rest in the crook of Neville’s neck. “I would have asked you out before that could have happened.”
Knowing that their matches were private made them all the more exciting for Harry. At first, the simple rebellion of sneaking out for something as mundane as playing a seeker's game made Harry’s head swim. It was the most normal thing he had done at Hogwarts, since…well, since ever.
“She’s brilliant as always.”
“I resent that,” Dean added.
“Harry, did I wake you?”
Hermione laughed. “They are cheesy romance novels.”
“Maybe I would have, maybe not. You never gave me the chance, Potter. If we are going to work together, be partners, you have to be honest with me.”
I was glad for the darkness the storm provided. It made it easier to hide my discomfort. Just because I’ve seen my share of dead bodies didn’t mean I wasn’t affected by them.
Malfoy looked out at the cemetery. “You’re seeing the protection spells over the graves most likely. Many of these graves are historical and therefore have a lot of value. The Hogsmeade Historical Society had some experts come in during the First World War and add protection charms to the graves to keep looters away. It was a huge problem, so only approved family members are allowed to make changes to the graves. They renew the charms that start to fade out yearly. The ones that look more vibrant are the ones that were most recently renewed.”
But it was too late, Potter managed to drag Draco away from the drinks table, leaving the shattered glass on the deck where it fell. They crossed the party and a few people gawked at them. The Beauxbaton’s boy, who Draco suspected was the whooping charm culprit, very audibly said “
Hagrid held up the lantern in front of them and there was a small cone of light that spread out ahead of them, illuminating the forest’s entrance. Then with his free hand, Hagrid adjusted his Santa cap so it was pulled slightly over the tops of his ears.
“Draco, is that you?” It was his father. His tone was that of annoyance, though he was trying to conceal it, so it meant Draco hadn’t missed anything too significant in the morning debriefing. If he had, then surely he would have heard the crack of his father’s cane across his back before he heard his voice.
I took off toward it. I didn’t wait for Ron, Hermione, or Malfoy, but I heard them running behind me. Malfoy swearing about improper footwear for a chase.
Potter nodded toward his friends. The Girl Weasley was chugging yet another beer down in a race against Finnegan and Thomas. She won and belted out a large burp. “Have one of those, I mean?”
“Is it working?” Malfoy asked all the awkwardness from our conversation was gone and replaced by academic intrigue. I couldn’t even tell he had been annoyed a few minutes ago as we walked here.
“No, thanks,” I added. “If I drink anymore tea I’ll likely have to run out in the middle of my speech to use the loo.”
Draco took a beat, seeming to consider his response as though he wasn’t sure how much to share with Harry, then nodded. “Mother tried a marriage set-up. This time with some Russian witch who was as straight as me.”
, Harry thought,
“Yes. Let’s go.” Draco extended his hand farther, practically putting it in Harry’s face.
“No, listen, please. It should be against your better judgement to even care how I feel. That is what my speech was about. I was begging Pansy to understand why I would never make my feelings known to you. I did not wish to burden you with the task of rejecting me.”
“I’m going to kiss you.”
Potter’s face got serious all of a sudden. He seemed to agree with Draco, but did not want to admit it. “Don’t worry, I’ll protect you. That is my potions partners promise.” Potter raised his right hand and straightened his back, looking all official and said, “I swear it. No harm will come to the sole reason I am passing Potions this semester. Come on.”
I brought Hermione’s hand up between us and squeezed. “I’m sorry.” I wasn’t sure if I was apologizing for bringing it up, for never noticing her pain, for accusing her and Ron of moving on without me all the time. Maybe I was apologizing for it all. Merlin knows I had plenty to own up to.
Eyes wide, Malfoy gave him a long-suffering silent sigh, which Harry found oddly impressive, or at least he would have if there wasn’t a man potentially dying on the other side of the door while his partner did it.
? With all he had done and the terrible choices he made, could he start anew? Even though he had taken the mark, he
“And I’m supposed to share?” Draco laughed. He looked around at the other drinks tables. “There is likely plenty more whisky somewhere else, Potter.”
“You know,” Potter said, his voice breaking through Draco’s reverie, “You could have just come to check out the clubs without an invitation from me. Not everything needs to be filed out in triplicate and submitted to Head Auror Robards for approval. I wouldn’t have trusted that you’d call me, I would’ve just been there. Paperwork isn’t our job, catching bad guys is.”
“You swore you could get me in and out without Snape knowing. Can you?” Malfoy asked. He eyed Harry’s bag and it filled Harry with unease. His stomach had taken to somersaulting like a toddler in their first gymnastics class. The fluttering feeling he felt usually indicated to him that he was about to do something incredibly stupid.
“I know. I have seen you in my own,” she said as if this was a perfectly normal conversation, but she didn’t elaborate. “When did they start?”
My mouth was dry. I felt my magic agitated under my skin. This was usually about the time I would grab a drink to quiet the magic pulsing throughout my body. To numb the thoughts that always threatened to bring up things best buried.
“I am. You and Potter might be the only people who remember this man is dead and the odd circumstances surrounding it. I’m sure they will send Unspeakables to relieve the aurors at the party to wipe their memories, too. I need you to figure out why the Unspeakables are wiping cases from our minds and if it has anything to do with these so-called magical surges.”
The intensity of Potter’s eyes was like watching a thunderstorm roll in over the sea. First there was electricity, then raging waters, then pure, unadulterated tension as the air was heavy with expectation. Draco felt it building in him, all the years of tension between them, all of the fights, the push and pull like waves on the shore. As much unspoken between them as had been said, as much known as unknown—could never be known.
“Poor thing,” she purred as she moved closer, swaying her hips in a very distracting way. It did wonderful things to her legs, accentuating the taut lines of muscle there. “When was the last time you felt love?
“Are you going to share this time?”
Draco’s throat went dry. “Of course, Potter. It was nothing.”
“Ready,” Harry said and moved in closer to Malfoy. The firewhiskey was warm in his stomach now. It was egging Harry onward, telling him that all he had to do was get close to Malfoy and the git would give in.
This whole encounter was out of control now and Draco knew he wouldn’t get very far with Potter like this, so he tucked in and decided to enjoy being yelled at—revel in being the object of Potter’s rage. Even knowing how fucked in the head he was for being turned on by Potter’s loathing of him, Draco couldn’t stop himself. It felt exactly like what he deserved for being the coward they all saw him as—the coward he was.
Harry swallowed hard, trying to ignore the growing arousal in his pants, and peeked over the top of the bush in time to see a woman, tall with raven colored hair in a red dress that looked more like a teddy meant for the bedroom than something to wear in public, and a man hanging all over her. He seemed drunk, in both the literal sense and in the magical one.
“Harry, you really should have your insomnia looked at. It’s unhealthy and coupled with your drinking habits…”
. Even though it was that “betrayal” that saved them from Azkaban and from death.
“I do.”
“Well, he was waiting for you to ask him out. He said you two had been flirting for months and that you even got sort of close to asking and then didn’t.”
“Sorry, mate. You said Dare and now you have to do a dare,” Weasley answered and Draco thought he sounded a bit too happy about it.
Therefore, Draco decided, it was safer to keep his feelings close to his chest. Only Pansy, his dearest friend, knew about them. Draco had feigned indifference to Mr. Potter each time he was mentioned in casual conversations or when she inquired as to whether Mr. Potter had accepted his invitation. It was simply that Pansy was highly attuned to Draco and all his quirks. Such things occur when friendship spans a lifetime as theirs did.
“Your skin looks soft.” Harry couldn’t stop the words from coming out. They were on the tip of his tongue even before Malfoy finished asking his question.
Harry smiled and closed the distance between them. At first, he just pressed his lips against Draco’s, breathing him in and waiting for his heart to get itself under control. He slid his hand to rest on the back of Draco’s neck, then pushed harder into the kiss, and felt Draco push back, opening up to the kiss.
I turned the faucet on and let the cold water run. The soft flowing sound filled the room and helped calm me down. I leaned over the sink to splash my face. I closed my eyes tight and willed my magic to relax. The water was like ice, but it felt good, so I let the water run down my face, my neck. I splashed my face one more time and then opened my eyes.
He looked over at Hermione who also looked like she just saw a ghost for the first time. “You, uh, your face went sort of green then white. I thought you were going to pass out.”
“This is very typical of you, Harry Potter...” Draco’s eyes wandered down Harry’s body and then back up to his eyes. He sighed, and said, “I love you, too. Fuck me, but I do. I really fucking love you.”
“Er, no. I wasn’t sure if you—if we—what I mean is, are we…is this some—
Draco scowled up at Harry. “You are such a menace, Potter. Always so dramatic. I really could do without the theatrics, you know?” He smirked, and then threw himself on top of Harry, making them both fall back onto the blanket they’d spread over the cool stone floor.
Greyjoy coughed to remind us she was there. “Harry, I think you are a true seer like me. Those visions felt forced on you because of your age. You weren’t trained to deal with them, so they forced themselves to be seen. I am sure some of them were tricks if what you say is true about his soul attaching to yours, but I think considering the visions you are having now…”
“So he decided to date someone else because I was taking too long?”
“Brilliant deduction, Granger,” Draco spat out the words, angry that Granger was seeing through him. “You really are the brightest witch in our year. However, you missed one tiny detail.”
“Yes.”
“The issue?” Draco raised his voice unintentionally, but now that he was speaking louder he felt his anger toward the whole situation. Anger toward himself. Anger toward his station in life. Anger, even, toward Mr. Potter for rejecting him and then pretending to enjoy a conversation with him as if there was no ill feelings between them. This anger came forth in his speech, though he only half believed what he shouted.
“Yes, sir,” Draco said.
“Huh, what face?” Harry asked innocently and flashing his best innocent puppy-dog eyes at her.
Quickly, Draco scanned the room. Toilet. Sink. Judgemental bronze face on the mirror. Then he spotted a small wooden cabinet to the side of the sink that was the same dark wood the walls were made of—he would have missed it if he hadn’t been looking. It was locked, but a quick wandless
like he wanted to, Harry pulled the practice snitch out of his pocket. It had been humming against his thigh while they spoke, but now, exposed to the night air, it was thrumming with energy, itching to zip into the sky and flit along until one of them caught it.
Ron came into the kitchen holding an issue of the Daily Prophet. “Thought you’d want to see this. I saw it on my desk before I headed out.”
“No way am I giving you the potion.” He rolled his eyes. “And I did not leave you waiting. Ginny followed you down the hall before I could. I figured you would send her away but you didn’t. When you guys came out looking, well, I thought... I don’t know.”
“If that's all you want, yes, but I was thinking more along the lines of what you told me at St. Mungo's.”
The rain was turning all the dirt to mud around me and I slipped a bit as I tried to stand. I toppled to my hands and knees. The pain was still there in my gut like a reminder. It was dull, but persistent.
“The place looks wonderful,” Ron said.
There was a moment where Potter leaned in, grasping Draco’s robes in his fist, when Draco thought that maybe, just maybe, something would happen, but then the familiar sound of Robards’ voice reached them and Draco pulled back.
“You must be starving, the both of you.” She pulled away from Ron and noticed the wet spot on her dress where they touched. “Oh, you need a drying charm.” She cast the hot-air charm on both of us, smiled, and then headed off to the food tables which were now in the living room.
“No, I think it’s sort of sweet.”
He threaded his fingers in Nikola’s hair and tugged slightly, overwhelmed by the growing need inside him. Nikola responded by sliding his hands up Draco’s thighs and cupping his ass. They were warm and when Nikola gripped hard—hard enough that Draco was sure to have nail marks on his perfect skin—Draco let a moan rip through him, his head falling back against the wall.
Likely, blowing out one of the candles would disconnect the Ley Line, but if the breeze and damp air wasn’t doing it, the candles were  likely enchanted somehow, so getting them to blow out wouldn’t be as simple as blowing out the candles on a birthday cake. Plus, there could be any number of things that could go wrong. If the Ley Lines power was tied to the candles, and the bond was strengthened by the sacrifices of the victims, then blowing out the candles could mean messing with the Ley Lines intrinsic power, and Harry didn’t know how that would affect magic on the whole. And thanks to the Succubus stealing some of his Life Energy, he wasn’t sure he could cast something without it backfiring, or fizzling out completely.
I wanted to punch him, but instead I smiled.
“Wow,” Harry sighed in reply.
Malfoy raised his wand, clearly ready to cast another spell, but Harry nudged him with his elbow. The only spell that worked on her was fire and with the victim unconscious under her, it was too dangerous. She could use him as a shield, or Malfoy could miss and hit the victim all together. There was no good way to communicate to Malfoy to cast a
Malfoy laughed and it was intoxicating. I’d been with plenty of people but none of them could send a wave of lust through my body from a mere laugh. I hated that there was something different about him. About my attraction to him. I’d known it after that first time at the fundraiser, but I ignored it. Told myself it was boredom and alcohol. It was harder to ignore after the memorial.
“I’ve never heard of a privacy spell that involves hand holding.”
“Yes, in an adult. The caretaker for the cemetery at Hogsmeade. Jared Randall. It wasn’t reported on because the Unspeakables treated him. Didn’t even bring him to St. Mungo’s. Tried to obliviated him after.”
Harry conceited because he did sort of like that they had become friends, though he would be remiss if he ever admitted it to Hermione; she always has been a bit of a sore winner, “Merlin, you are terrible.”
They decided to wait for the Succubus to enter the mausoleum, trap it inside. Both Harry and Malfoy felt their potion’s shield flare up around the same time. Malfoy had come to the same conclusion as Harry and was about to send up a flare when he saw Harry’s.
Everyone laughed, if not genuinely, politely. Standing with Seamus was Malfoy, who looked even more tempting in the soft summer sunlight; Luna Lovegood, who smiled dreamily at me; and Charlie Weasley, who was back from Romania substituting for Hagrid as Care of Magical Creatures professor while he was off doing research. It had been a long time since I’d seen any of them.
“Thanks,” Harry said stiffly.
,” Potter whispered and smiled against Draco’s fingers. Warm breath escaped his mouth and it caressed Draco’s skin like the first ray of sunlight after a hard winter.
Hermione snorted from ahead of us. It was clear she could hear our conversation but had nothing to add to it except her contempt.
Flashes of the man lying dead filled my mind. He was screaming. Begging for his life. Then it shifted and I saw him hovering over me, black ooze pouring from his eyes and mouth. His hand outstretched, reaching down to me. He tried to say something but more ooze fell from his mouth like a waterfall.
Ron snapped his fingers. “Yes, exactly. Seems he tried and failed to collect magic in a battery. It backfired and blew him up. It was a nasty scene, Harry. Bits of him everywhere.”
“Merlin, Ron,” Harry said grimacing. “Anything helpful in the notes at least?”
“Mm, ‘fraid so,” Draco answered. Keep it to as little words as possible. They can’t get mad at what is said, if you don't say anything, Draco told himself.
“I have some information that I think you might want and I got your address
The chatter suddenly died down, and the group collectively turned to face Neville and Luna who stood, arm in arm, at the front of the greenhouse. They both held a glass of champagne in their hands.
“Then it’s lucky that it
There was motion to his right, but Harry couldn’t quite make it out. Then he saw a bright red light and the amorphous gray blob that was likely the Succubus fly off and slam into the wall behind her. The mausoleum shook with the force of Malfoy’s spell.
Hermione spun to face us. “You bet your arse.” There was a fierceness in her eyes that reminded me of second year when she convinced us that polyjuice potions were not too advanced for her. Although finding the proper hair had been. I smiled at the memory.
All he could think to say was, “You are too kind.”
Draco had to bite his lip to keep from smiling. “What are you saying? You want me to stay on as your partner?”
The sound of Draco’s ragged breathing, synchronized with the bass of the music, felt like a flaming arrow shot straight into his chest. It burned through him and made his breath catch in his throat.
Potter grunted as he tossed a file over onto Draco’s desk. “Map, map. Shite. Where is it?”
She shook her head. A smile played at the corner of her mouth. “I am a seer, remember?”
A long moment passed. The Succubus’ hand loosened even further, giving Harry a chance to breathe properly. She was distracted looking at Malfoy, so Harry slipped his hand in his pocket. It was the Lock Box. The cool metal felt like heaven in his hand. He just needed to wait for the right moment to toss it at her and end this.
Pansy embarasses Harry at work, but also gives him the courage to talk to Draco finally.
Draco was to see the Malfoy bloodline lived on and therefore was encouraged to keep his proclivity for fucking men a secret. Nothing would stand in the way of Lucius making a match for Draco that ensured their legacy. Of course, he was allowed to experiment and perform certain tasks if the Dark Lord willed it, but that was all.
“And if I refuse?”
“Are you okay?” I heard myself ask. I ignored the hum of my magic under my skin that happened whenever he was around.
Skeeter really was something else. Her eyes looked hungry and that worried me, but more than that, I needed to prove that the surges were a problem. If the Ministry wasn’t going to keep people safe, I would.
When she released him from the kiss, she said, “What did he want?’
Robards laughed. “Merlin you are something else. You’re on desk duty for beating up a Ministry official thanks your little magical surge theory. Isn’t that enough attention for you?”
“What do you…” I trailed off as understanding hit me. He wanted to come along and I couldn’t let him. He was too much of a distraction.
“Yes, about the Prophet article, or about your major crush on Dra--”
For the second time that day, Draco pictured his mother quietly encouraging Draco to forgive his father’s frigid manner since, in the end, he meant well. She was always their mediator. Her nature was compassionate and warm and that so starkly contrasted with his father, who was often as warm and welcoming as one of his many marble statues.
Kharkov threw her hands up and belatedly laughed, the water trickled out faster when her mouth opened wide. “Nonsense. I was just young enough to be boring myself, as you say, with being head of a school.”
“Harry, where have you been hiding?” she asked. “Ron’s going to be late. Some disaster at the lab. Apparently George tried to create...some weird thing, and it backfired horribly. Ron said George lost an eyebrow and Lee laughed for a full ten minutes before helping him grow it back. Ghastly. Anyway, how was work? Training going well?”
Maybe it was the clear head, but I almost felt glad to be there when Seamus called out to me. It felt he was happy to see me. I hadn’t felt like someone was happy to see me in ages. I grew up believing I was a nuisance. The Dursley’s saw to that. And it didn’t disappear as I got older. The setting changed, but there was usually someone who found me bothersome. Even now, Robards made it clear my prescience irritated him. He thought I got through the auror training just on name alone. Most of my coworkers were the same. I even felt like a burden to my friends since most moved on after the war. They were happy and getting married like Ron and Hermione or Dean and Seamus while I seemed stuck in the past. I feared that everyone was bothered by me, so I stoped accepting as many invitations and tended to spend time with strangers and that was only for one thing. I thought I was doing them all a favor by making it so they didn’t have to deal with me, but maybe I was wrong to do that.
“She challenged Hermione a bit in the teacher’s lounge.”
In one fluid movement, he pulled Draco’s trousers down to his ankles and slipped his mouth around Draco’s cock; swallowed all the way down to the hilt and felt Draco’s hands in his hair.
Harry snorted. “Are we looking for honest answers, or am I supposed to tell you that you’re perfect the way you are so as to not hurt your fragile ego?”
He stammered out a quick Protego at the blonde woman who was now mewling like a kitten, reaching for the raven-haired woman’s face. The effort to lift his wand, collect his magic, and focus it outward to protect the woman practically made him faint. Magic had never been this difficult for him. He felt the spell land though, so he breathed out a sigh of relief that at least the woman was shielded from getting hit by a stray spell.
“It matters, but not the most. You never used to hate working with someone this much.”
Lucius delivered the news as if it meant Draco won the Quidditch World Cup. As if it was some great honor to be the Dark Lord’s prostitute. His face revealed all Draco needed to know about his father, the cruelty in the smile, the challenge in the narrowing of the eyes—Lucius, despite his mother’s insistence, was not merely distant. He was cold. Empty. At least empty of anything resembling love for Draco. Not anymore. Maybe once, when Draco was younger. But in the last two years since the Dark Lord’s return, there had been nothing there.
“Well, it’s about the magical surges. Something I believe you have an interest in, if the papers are to be believed.”
“You had some kind of seizure,” Ron answered the question before I could form the words.
“What? You think I—oh, no, no, no,” Harry rushed the words out in one breath, putting his hands up as if to push the idea far, far away. His face flushed what he was sure to be a bright pink. Then it hit him that Neville thought he wanted to ask a bloke out which meant, Neville knew he liked men.
When that thought occurred to him, when he realized Draco was going to say no, Harry avoided Draco whenever possible and tried to think of a way to fix it, to solve it. He stayed out late practicing on the Quidditch pitch, he skipped meals, and ran off after class, all to delay the inevitable conversation. Draco was going to end things, he was going to leave Harry. And Harry couldn’t...wouldn’t let that happen. So he needed a plan first.
He felt Draco’s grip on his biceps. It was unsure at first, but then he tightened his grip and Harry felt grounded in the moment despite the crowds chant of kiss, kiss, kiss.
“You think there is something causing them. Something outside of the normal underage magic issues.”
I was feeling defensive now. “You’re talking like I’ve cheated on you. We hooked up twice and you barely act like you enjoy my company when I’m not on my knees.”
Quiet and empty as it was, the emergency ward had an almost other-realm feel to it as Potter stood in front of Draco, smiling at him openly like they were the best of friends.
The crowd cheered in a roar so loud, so booming, that Harry had only ever heard its like at the Quidditch World Cup. It seemed like everyone was in a good mood, except for him. It seemed that everyone was also in a relationship, except for him. Hell, it seemed like everyone was ready for their future—except for him.
?” he mouthed.
,” Potter slurred, placed the bottle on the sink’s ledge which wasn’t very wide. It slipped as the ship swayed and made a clattering sound as it settled in the basin of the sink. Hands now free, he grabbed hold of Draco’s shoulders. The contact burned through him.
“Your partner was smart enough to send word when you found the Succubus. We were all out at different night clubs when we got word, and rushed here. Looks like we were a bit late to the party, though. And interestingly, we ran into a naked man stammering about a wizard fight that led us back to the mausoleums.”
“I’ll take that as a yes.” Draco smirked at his partner. The switch in tactics worked, he’d have to remember that. It wasn’t perfect, but that was the most civil exchange they’d had since becoming partners. Progress is progress.
There was a pregnant silence and then a dark cloud moved in front of the sun, blanketing the party in darkness. I sensed Malfoy standing to my left, but he wasn’t saying anything. He wasn’t moving. I heard a sharp intake of breath that let me know he was okay. Then another scream ripped through the air; this time so loud it reverberated in my ears, and I looked toward the back of the yard. It was coming from the forest, or at least near the forest.
“Your unhappiness,” she snapped again, her tone heavy with the kind of quiet anger that boils to a point. “You did that yourself. You don’t get to say that now I’m happy, you can finally be happy. Like I was holding you back or something.”
“Still with you.”
This perversion of his was, Draco knew,
“Sure, you might, but I bet Harry is bored out his mind doing all the paperwork, eh?” Seamus asked, nudging Charlie who smirked.
When Draco felt the door behind him, he gasped. Potter laughed. He began to unbutton where Draco had left off. With each button, Draco felt himself grow more and more erect. Potter moved almost agonizingly slow until he reached Draco’s waist. He stopped unbuttoning and he slipped his hands into Draco’s half-open robes and slowly slid the robe off Draco’s shoulder’s. It pooled at Draco’s feet. He only wore his pants now.
Everything came into focus and I felt my heart return to it’s normal speed. I looked around and saw I was in my own sitting room and not the forest. It had felt so real.
“We’ll be your human subjects. We can test it in the field.” Potter’s sounded frantic again. Draco hadn’t bothered to wonder why Potter was so hellbent on finding the map before because he was more focused on how unorganised his partner was and how badly that reflected on Draco. But now, under the aggressive bright lights in the lab, Draco saw it; Potter was upset, and like any wizard with a savior complex, he clearly blamed himself for the most recent woman’s death. Silly that Draco hadn’t noticed it before. It was classic Potter.
The sun broke through the clouds just as they made it to the entrance of the cemetery. For a moment, Harry let the sun warm his face, eyes shut, then he took in the area around them.
That’s when he felt Draco’s hands; one barely touching his cheek, the other slipped around the back of his neck. Then their lips touched, soft at first and then Draco’s lips parted and Harry tasted him on his tongue.
“I have a source,” she said, her lip quirking into a half-smile. Yep, still a bastard.
“Possibly it’s because someone has their hand on my cock and looks like a god in that suit,” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear.
As Draco strolled leisurely through the gardens, taking in the beauty that had been his mother’s favorite hobby, he felt a pang of terror. His dream. It kept resurfacing at the most inconvenient of times. Most often, it would strike him like a dart from across the room whenever Voldemort spoke his name in that sickly sweet way he often saved for Draco, and only Draco.
“You okay?” Potter asked, closing the door behind them. He clicked the lock into place and Draco felt his heart leap into his throat. He had to be dreaming. There was no way this was actually happening. He would wake up tomorrow and this will have all been a dream.
I searched the party and spotted Neville with George in a corner. They were leaning in close, whispering to one another. Neville’s clothes were still covered in dirt. I guess he never got around to cleaning himself up with the scream and panic afterward. With the obliviate, I doubt he even remembered why his clothes were dirty.
Ginny’s expression soured. She stood up abruptly. “Are you fucking kidding me, Harry?”
“You do know,” Harry started, then lowered his voice, “the whole school is going to think we are dating now?”
“Thank you, we’re going to go check that out,” Malfoy said.
“We can side-a-long.”
Before I could decide if I wanted to tell Ron about the visions, I saw the aurors
He was met with more than one,
“Back late, Mr Potter,” Sir Hilliard noted when Harry sang the password.
Harry landed, planted his feet and tried to steady himself with an outstretched hand. His heart pounded even more fiercely, and when he was focused enough, he realised his hand was still neatly wrapped in Draco’s.
Hermione waved her off. “Hey, you didn’t walk away. That’s more than most people do.” Then she headed for one of the tables, leaving Harry and Ginny alone.
The mess of my hair created disheveled wisps of blonde strands all over my shoulders, having produced a pale drape over my eyes and covering half of my face as I let a small tilt of my lips form, curving upwards to display a capricious shy yet vixen like grin.
But why wasn’t Harry fighting the Carbonous like Granger and Weasley were doing?
I didn’t know if the girl gave me the right information, given she was drunk off her arse, but an adventure was calling out for me and I was sure I would find some weed at some point in the party while I’m here.
But I couldn't budge much of my limbs away from Harry’s body pressing over mine and his teeth clamping into me.
“Pick up the fork you dropped on the floor, Malfoy.” Harry spoke to me through my little freak out session, voice low and monotonous now.
, let me go?!” My voice came out breathy and high, breaking at the shifting tone levels as I panted against the wall in an effort to try and get away from the magic flicking heat across parts of flesh that I’ve never given any thought to that would be so
I want to help people.
I let out a whine, high and breathy, out of my mouth when the scent of Potter’s body blanketed me while the warmth of his bare fingers skimmed over the curve of my waist, skating in between the hem of my jeans and top as the blistering heat that Potter’s frame eluded blazed against my bowed back.
The reason why Harry acts the way he does, is because the Chosen One everyone thought they knew, was man that was cruel yet still had a heart that wanted to keep others safe. Harry was a contradiction. I didn’t mind his
It both thrilled and scared me.
Just as I was about to sneer up at the man from my ragdoll position across the marble floor, the intention to hiss and yell at Harry bubbling up in my ashamed chest, the Assassin simply apparated us.
I stared. Shellshocked.
Then the black haired man let out a soft sigh, shoulders falling into a relaxed state as he rolled them back to loosen the stiff muscles there, lips set into a fine line now as he waved the arm that wasn’t around his boyfriend in my general direction. “I shall, I shall. But Draco, darling, please do cover up that large purple and blue hickey on the side of your neck. It’s distracting.”
Imagining things that never happened.
A murder is a murder regardless.
I was getting sleepy.
Gorgeous and … sinister, truly so.
in Harry’s lap and across the floor.
The teleportation doorway started to open up into the length of an oval shape, towering above Weasley's already too tall frame and expanding a good few meters out from the sides, energy a blue sparking haze around the static edges of the circle.
“Where the
Glancing up my figure, I turned back around on my heel, watching with a sort of trepidation at way the wet curl of my long hair, wet and silver tinged, assorted into weird coils to create something similar to that of a rats nest. The scent of almond and the light fragrance of rain coveted the whole of my body and the steamed bathroom, filtering through the humid air after having taken a slow and leisure shower in the early morning of my waking.
The assassin was always one step ahead of me.
happen if I didn’t get my arse in gear. “How am I supposed to sit o-on the seat if you’re taking up the whole space, you big oaf?” My tone came out shuddering in a breathy pitch, destroying my plan to look unaffected by all of
The blonde’s keening turned into a siren’s wailing as I fucked him, fast, hard, and relentless as the skin across my bones started to hum in a heated pitch and my ears rang with a white noise that popped and crackled like fire eating away at the rope of a stick of dynamite ready to implode.
Whipping my bewildered gaze back up at Harry, I leaned back in shock, jerking on the spot at the sudden close proximity of the assassin’s body, closing in on me with a terrifyingly dark manner at the way his features seemed to morph into a sinister curl of the lip at his mouth, the energy of his body violent in the wake of his power seeming to slip out of his skin and spindling their way towards my own.
I didn’t find Harry fucking me within a literal inch of my life a mistake though.
Their house reminded me of Fall and that was my favorite season so I was quite happy in this place.
I was that pest.
As if on reflex, my hands twitched by my sides, the sensation of Draco’s naked plump bum jiggling beneath the cracking swat of my palm seeming to tingle back alive over the inner skin of my hand at the thought of the kind of punishment I gave the princess before we were ambushed by the Carbonou.
A rousing wash of heat zipped down my groin and imploded from the tip of my cock, the pleasure hot and fast as I was being made into Harry’s
In a fit of defiance as I approached the bike, I grumbled down at Harry with a purse to my lips evident on my features, annoyed at myself and the situation I found myself in at the moment as well as nervous from the chaos that happened just moments ago and what
But then Harry let me go, making my feet settle soundly onto the earthy floor, my eyes watching the Gryffindor reach his arms up above his head. The fabric of his shirt rode up the taut line of his fit stomach to reveal the bronzed flesh of his navel and abs as well as the low rise of his jeans that hung off of the cut lines of his hip bones, the cords of his muscles in both his stomach and arms tensing with a defined prominence as his shoulder blades protruded and reminded me of a slinking predator, powerful and all contained sin.
My hands jolted the slightest with the plan of raising them up on their own accord and having every intention of fisting the front material of Erus’ shirt to drag him bodily against the weak of my frame, but I only managed gasp out in surprise when the Gryffindor had moved too fast for me to react before I wanted to bring him to me.
and violent. “You stubborn, naive, little
Harry probably knew that I was slowly losing any semblance of mental control.
These were just thoughts though. I couldn’t grasp what my magic wanted. But it had an inkling interest, obsessive and possessive, over Draco. And it seemed my magic was lashing out at not having full control over the gorgeous Slytherin so it sought out ways to feel that same sensation it had when I fucked Draco by killing and doing everything morally wrong to take all the darkness and ball it up into a bundle of power that could only give it the smidgen of the same feeling as it felt when I was
And I was panting in excitement over it.
I was shameless in the way I spoke around a tremor of a voice, high and needy as I stared up at Harry from beneath my wet lashes that had tears spilling down my cheeks from the wonderful pain and pleasure, the prodding of the Gryffindor’s pick puncturing into my lower abdomen.
I gave a jerky nod in response, my words shaking as I spoke around a trembling pitch. “It’s the word ‘Puffle’”.
At the same time the traces of the man’s magic started to fade away with the last of its remnants mingling with mine, I shoved my hand further into his chest to feel around for the guy’s weakening beat of his heart, holding it in my palm to feel it’s last pulses pumping in my light grip while I shot the blade of my combative knife into the man’s arse, ramming it straight into his hole with a grin splitting my face as I prodded the guy’s prostate and went further through him.
You can’t
And with the way Harry played with his wand in his hands, the bastard knew what he was doing to me.
me and I, well, I want him.
And she was right.
Harry waved Hezian off as he turned towards me and snatched me up from around my waist, giving me a dirty grin that made my heart stutter and distracted me enough to not yell at him when I felt the familiar sensation of the apparating spell take hold of my body.
I waited for my mail with my ears straining to hear footsteps outside of my apartment for the mailman since I was too poor to have an Owl drop me off my mail.
I laughed even more when Harry started to snore on top of me.
!” I was being a little shit with my little outburst, body growing heated as I started to push against Harry in frustration.
The assassin’s hand was covered in blood, the brains of the blonde man's pouring out of his severed head and creating slick sounds as the insides trickled out and splurged onto the floor in a cascade of blood and human flesh at Harry's feet.
Ignoring me.
“Draco Malfoy, have you forgotten about the party today?” Blaise’s voice was pitched in a smooth drawl, all proper and uncanningly haughty in a luxurious low tint that he often thought made him out to be some sort of chilled out man but in reality actually had him sounding as if he always had something stuck in his esophagus from such force put into his pristine countenance.
No one has ever told me they found me attractive.
I couldn’t help the way my skin lit aflamed by the Assassin’s rough treatment, my throat bobbing along with my indefinite fearful anticipation, my breath hiccuping out of my parted mouth when I felt the unmistakable hardened cock of Harry’s press right up against my jean clad arsecheeks.
I didn’t like that.
So Harry regrets what he did. Harry probably didn’t want to remember such a thing because he obviously just wanted to punish me.
I tapped the tip of my bare foot against the shimmering marble beneath me, the purse of my lips formed into an indifferent pout as impatience and anxiety flooded the whole of my system, a small tick in the line of my jaw visible in my reflection staring back at me.
that were disembodied and containing such carnal cruelty, all came from the upturn of Harry’s lips, roughened and slick with smooth, Stygian pleasure, rolling off of his tongue like a second, unearthly language that was directed towards me.
in blood, the hard set of his jaw tense and spotted with specs of ruby red, flecking over the sharp curve of his cheekbones. The fabric of Harry’s jeans and long sleeve black shirt were darkened in certain areas, catering to the knowledge the blood had seeped through the material with the way it stuck to the lean and muscled frame of the Assassin’s threatening tall body.
I was always such a good boy to my parents and never did anything scandalous with my body or hobbies. So in a way, I was finally doing things that were both frightening and exciting. I was finally taking my own interests in my own hands and doing what I wanted with them.
I was going to go through with this. And I didn’t have much hesitation about it considering what I heard about the heinous faction. There was enough turmoil in the wizard world what with the war and all. There didn’t need to be another big event that made the people fear about stepping out of their own homes.
I gave Harry an exasperated amused raise of my brow, a tiny tilt of my lips forming into a calming smile that wordlessly spoke to the Gryffindor that I was alright with him letting Hermione in to see me.
I sat down beside Harry now, crossing my legs over one another to cover up my aroused state as I placed my hands precariously over my groin area in hopes of covering myself up in front of Weasley.
And the knowledge that my figure was more curvaceous than a man’s regular body build should be, made me more insecure than most.
I’m about to come! W-wh-what’s happening? Aha-ah-ngh!” The heavy familiar sensation of Harry’s dark magic slipped its way around my torso in a slinking touch, wrapping itself over me to abruptly tug me up in a nauseating fast pace where I found my back colliding with the burning, hot clothed covered abs of Harry’s, feeling the racing of his own heart against the sweat of my shuddering spine.
Harry looked ready to hunt me down.
“Harry Potter, Saviour of the Universe, fancy seeing you down here of all places,” a drawling voice called to me from the stairs leading down to the dungeons.
He was going to have to stand opposite Draco during the wedding ceremony. And he was also going to have to do it with Ginny there, staring. He’d been in worse situations, he told himself. How bad could this be compared to Voldemort? He just had to write a character letter for his ex-boyfriend, which would bring up all sorts of feelings he’d been ignoring since their break-up, and be the best man to Draco’s best man of honor. No biggie.
I remembered the bathroom at Dean and Seamus’s and seeing my mother in the mirror. Had she been trying to tell me something? And then the caretaker at the crime scene. He had definitely been trying to speak.
“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, obviously.” Malfoy’s stance relaxed as he answered. His free hand rested on his hip.
“You followed me?” I asked impressed. From what I remember, Malfoy was scared of these woods. Or he had been when we were in school.
“I promise.” Draco smiled at his friend and patted her hand on his arm. “Safety is my middle name, after all.” That made her laugh and she released him. With one last smile, he was bounding down the hall to catch the elevator wondering how in Tartarus he was going to keep his cool around Potter.
Draco’s eyes were still on him. Harry could feel them roaming his face in search of something, but Harry kept his eyes on the night sky. Under the scrutiny of his gaze, Harry considered saying never mind and calling it a night, but this feeling—this heaviness in his stomach—it was too much to ignore anymore. He was carrying it around with him constantly.
“You are insane.” Malfoy shook his head in disbelief. “Merlin’s tits, I’m the insane one. I just ran after you without thinking. I had no idea what we were chasing, but I ran after you. Merlin, fuck, but I was worried you would get hurt. Gods above and below, Pansy was right. I’m loosing my fucking mind.”
“That we what?” Draco asked, his voice unsure, when it was clear Harry wasn’t going to continue.
Though, he mused, the feeling never stopped him before, so why should it now? And with that newly braced resolve, he took a deep breath. “Merlin’s beard, Malfoy, yes. How many more times are you going to ask me?”
It seemed that Draco kept it secret as well since no Slytherins had poked fun at him for losing that first night. Harry let himself wonder why Draco kept it secret. Was it for the same reasons as Harry, or was it because of their history? Was it because things had always been so volatile between them?
Conversation over, Potter turned his attention back on the files. He flipped through them, presumably looking for his map. He tossed another file onto Draco’s desk and pulled a few more out of his bottom drawer and began flicking through them frantically. Draco rolled his eyes because if Potter would just get off his high horse and ask, he could have told Potter that the map he was searching for was in the top drawer of Draco’s desk where it belonged, and they could have avoided all of this mess.
My interest was piqued at the mention of Hogsmeade. That’s where the adult surges and grave vandalizations happened. Maybe I could slip away and look into it. “Hogsmeade, right. I forgot they moved there.”
Malfoy shook his head. “Pansy said she was dating a Quidditch player. Just not which one.”
and then turned to see Draco twisting the top off the bottle. He seemed to glow against the absolute darkness around them. That pulse of excitement surged through him when Draco lifted the bottle to his mouth, wrapped his lips around the top and took a long swig.
“Agreed,” Hermione said. “It’s why those Unspeakables just obliviated and entire party.”
Harry had his hand on the door, wand at the ready, when Malfoy’s touch made him turn around. “
, before the Succubus had thrown him into the stone wall without moving her attention off of Malfoy. Telekinesis hadn’t been in all the texts and studies about Succubi. That they were superhuman strong, yes, but this was a whole other thing. His head throbbed. He felt warm liquid running down his forehead. A red droplet fell on his glasses which were cracked so badly he couldn’t see properly.
“Ryder, would you mind if we discussed potions later? My date, Harry, well he needs something to drink, so we are going to go find some whisky. Pardon us?”
“What are you leaving out, Harry?” Ron asked.
“Ah, yes, but she got away, anyway.” Draco couldn’t help but push it. Potter made him stupid, always had, ever since first year. It only got worse when Draco realised his attraction for Potter, which served to make Draco an even bigger idiot around the man. Most of the time, he could ignore his feelings. He’d accepted long ago that they were ridiculous and would never be reciprocated, so he dealt with them much in the same way one would deal with allergies—understand that they would occasionally consume him, stop him up, and make his life hell, and then treat the symptoms and wait until they went away. It helped that Potter, while being one of the sexiest men Draco had ever seen, was also the most frustrating.
The only small blessing of the day was that his partner hadn’t taken the empty chair next to him as an invitation to whisper passive-aggressive comments at him during the meeting. However, that did leave it open for his best friend, Ron Weasley, who made his way into the room and straight for the empty chair at Harry’s side. He sat down with an ‘oof’ and nudged Harry with his elbow.
“So,” Potter said, turning to Draco, “I reckon it’s time to get you in on the game.”
It sounded ridiculous even to me, even though I had focused and made myself have a vision at the cemetery earlier today. I was a seer. I was a seer? How could that be right? “I don’t know. This all sounds crazy.”
I looked out at the crowd now and took a deep breath before casting a wandless Sonorus that elicited some oohs and ahhhs from the crowd. “Thank you everyone for coming out today. It is a sad day for many reasons. We lost loved ones here. We fought tirelessly and came out injured and a bit broken. However, this is also a happy day. It is the day we regained control. The day Voldemort was defeated.” There were gasps at Voldemort’s name, even now, years after his death. Fear was a hard thing to let go of. “I wanted to thank Hermione and the professors at Hogwarts for making sure this day, and the people who sacrificed themselves so we might all see safer times, were remembered properly. So without further adieu, Hermione Granger-Weasley.”
“Hmm, yeah,” Harry agreed. He chanced a look at Draco out of the corner of his eye and saw Draco staring into the fire. The light played along his angular jawline, setting some of his pale skin in shadow and highlighted the rest in the orange glow. Harry swallowed hard and tore his eyes away from Draco’s smooth, pale skin. Looking at the sky was much safer.
“And I was telling Harry that there are other whiskies in the sea.” Draco sipped the whisky and winked at Harry.
“Does anyone else know about this?” Ginny asked, face still somber, but she moved closer to Harry on the bench.
Draco, already feeling vulnerable, didn’t want to give Potter anymore reason to think him incapable, so he lied. “It felt the same as always, Potter. Maybe the potion is affecting you more.”
He fought his eyelids—begging them to stay closed. In the end, he opened his eyes and his gaze fell on Potter who was watching as Nikola’s head bobbed back and forth. It was jarring to find that Potter hadn’t attempted to shield himself from the scene in front of him. It wasn’t as if Draco forced him to watch so intently.
“I suppose one will have to await one of these compliments in the greatest anticipation.”
Draco looked away from Potter, though it took great effort. He could still see Potter out of the corner of his eye, and even though they were a foot apart, Draco practically felt the heat of Potter’s body on him.
Neville’s confusion mirrored Malfoy’s. “No, why?”
Harry tore his eyes away from the ceiling to look at his ex-girlfriend. She was in a sequined dress that left nothing to the imagination. Her freckled skin was smooth and pale and inviting. Harry smiled at her. “You look nice, Gin. Beautiful, really. Hot date?”
“It’s too cold and most of them cannot be found in the Forbidden Forest. This is pointless,” Malfoy whined.
I nodded. “Oh, yeah I remember that sort of. Didn’t she come back like really, really old.”
She laughed. “I am what I am, Mr. Potter. I accepted myself long ago. You’ll recall, I had quiet a lot of time for self-reflection.” Of course she was referring to her time trapped as a beetle in a jar.
I gave out a startled yelp at the contact of his furnace of a body pressed up against my cool one, lips dropping open to release a breathy whimper at the feel of the Gryffindor’s hard rock abs rubbing up against the flat of my stomach.
I blinked up at Kingsley, lips thinning out as I responded. “I got there around 4:30 in the evening and left around 4:44 since I couldn’t stay for too long. You can ask my manager, Andrew, at my work that he, too, can vouch that I wasn’t gone long and he was the one that sent me to go to Astringent to give a drafted manuscript to Albon Trisko, one of our customers. Jazine told me where I could find Trisko, I also ordered a tequila shot from her then left afterwards. The reason for my rush out of the nightclub was because I was on limited time with staying in the club as well as getting back to my office quickly.”
I snapped my eyes away as I took in the way Sirius’ boyfriend’s back hunched as a warning that he was about to vomit any second now and focused on my own hysteric breathing as that same alcoholic, unwanted taste bubbled up in the back of my throat with a clawing fixation, stomach dipping with sickness while my widened eyes couldn’t escape the sight before me.
Then Potter gave me no regard of his attention, turning his head around and carelessly going back to making the boy beneath him writhe about, Potter’s hands gripping over the boy's waist to bring his arse back to meet with each thrust Potter pushed forwards with such an easy tug of his wrists.
The mansion was harsh and lovely. A breathtaking embedding of the granite it held within itself accompanying the high ceilings with Gothic fixation eliciting a sort of ominous, enticing presence about itself. The clouds hanging high above my head, seeming to become a shadowed prominence of smoke emitting from charcoal, seemed to emphasize the foreboding yet alluring cadence the mansion and its area surrounding it carried within itself.
as I released a broken cry into the room in shock. I heard and
“Come here, Draco,” Zereth murmured from right beside me where I stood over woman I just killed, the sudden appearance of the demon popping up right next to mine and the sound of their thunderous words breaking me of my daze of thoughts with a jolt.
Walking over to the glass counter, Yevsky let out a huff of air as she handed me the white thumb band and flicked her right wrist in the direction towards the door, causing the entrance to open inwards as she murmured beneath her breath towards me. “Gavin was right. I’m jealous. Your arse shouldn’t be that fucking perky. Be careful in there. They’ll eat you alive, little bunny.”
“This is so good, Harry.” I moaned happily around the chewing of my food, swinging my feet back and forth from where I sat perched on top of the marble kitchen counter near the oven and stove where the Gryffindor stood flipping crispy bacon and sausages with a spatula in his hand over a frying pan.
I yelled out in a broken sob when Harry crooked his middle finger inside of me and swirled as well as flicked the warmed appendage against the convulsing flex of my inner walls, nudging the point of his finger against something that made my whole body implode in on itself with shocking roils of fire and delirious arousal.
I didn’t hesitate to keep myself together then.
I’m surprised I’ve been holding my shit together up until now.
I blinked at the man in complete surprise.
The women that stood behind the bartender counter gave me a purse of her glossy lips, tilting her hips to the side so she could place a hand on the jut of it and give me a narrowed eyed look. “I was informed of you coming for a few minutes. Albon Trisko is in one of the private rooms downstairs, room 399. You’ll find him there. Be quick or Mr. Zabini will get angry.”
Harry’s sharp cheekbones were obnoxiously enticing in the way shadows played out over his brilliant features, jawline tense and strong as his dark hair fell into his penetrating gaze that bore holes into my flesh, watching me like the damn predator that he was.
I opted to wear a dark gray trench coat for the cool weather I knew that awaited for me outside since the season was in the middle of winter.
with the way the red seemed to have spilled like the spreading of crystallized, blood stained diamonds over the jade of his eyes.
Words were spewing out of my mouth now. “Uh … I’m not interested. I’m sorry. I’m here to look around and-”
“Alright.” Harry responded to my plea, low and viciously pleased, the edges of his succulent lips curling up into a malicious irreverent grin, dirty and downright sensual.
“H-Harry? I s-swear I didn’t intend to get myself hurt tonight. I p-p-promise I won’t do it again!” My words were a constant stream of unnerved, flared questions and statements, the whole of my frame trembling from where I was roughly pressed flush between a wall and Harry’s tall, lean and muscled scorching body.
Harry simply stared straight ahead at Hezian, the glow of his eyes gleaming with devilish bemusement at the situation he put me in, the only sign giving away his dark satisfaction with how his face was set into a look of utter boredom.
Was Lucius the one that went off and got with an elven woman, had me, and knew that his choices had consequences, therefore deciding that he needed to be with a wizard and left his elven lover?
But then a voice filtered throughout the whole of the kitchen, the familiar low tone of Hezian’s annoyingly low haughty voice echoing around both mine and Harry’s now stalk still figures, seeming to bounce off against the walls surrounding us. “Harry, we want Draco here to give us that money now. Also, we have a few other things to talk about, but they should be spoken of face to face and in the safety in one of the many buildings our company owns. Come to the ninth ward. I expect to see you a second after I hang up.” And the man did exactly that.
” My shouted words were loud and cracking at the tones, shrill with pain and pleasure as the force of Harry’s slap made my bum jiggle and my virgin hole
Granger.
Snapping my eyes open, I gave out a squeak as I found my face at eye level with a black jean covered crotch.
.” Harry’s words were filled with salacious, filthy intent, low and mumbling in the slightly roughened hue of his breaths as he rocked into me in that same ungodly fast and hard penetration of his cock in my aching hole.
Fucking down right sexy this man was.
My bum bounced off of Harry’s groin only to come into contact again with the Assassin’s clothed prick when he tugged on my hair again, my body instinctively jolting back to follow the man’s pulling motion to keep my hair from ripping away from my scalp. My fingernails dug into the marbled ground as I let out a wail the same time Harry hit his hand again across my left cheek, the flesh jiggling as tears started to well up in the corners of my eyes.
I wanted to hyperventilate and have the panic attack I had to keep on lock down since everything that occurred recently.
-” My voice was beginning to crack and I stopped myself from yelling out anymore ramblings.
The fact that Zereth had declared that they were going to eat me only gave me more confidence in knowing that the demon was weakening because it needed to feed and I was pumped full of enough magic and energy for it to regain some good power to revitalize itself.
I was full on babbling now.
I assume if Kikue knew my name from Harry telling him somehow before or after all that murderous mess that happened, the host would know Caetia and the others who were apparated here by Harry.
I was fucking embarrassing myself.
And then I watched Draco cry on the bathroom floor when I’d
Staring at the envelope in my hand with a small pout to my lips, my brows furrowed as I remembered what Andrew ordered me to do.
Alrighty guys! This chapter had to be cut a little short because I had written a lot more than this before everything was deleted on my stupid old lap top. I decided to give you half of the update and thought that it was a good chapter in itself, although short. The next update most likely be an equal length, but with a little bit more. I thought it was a good idea to make this one the way it turned out to be. It was fun, it was dark and there's going to be a lot more fucked up things to come, this is just the start.
What a
I haven’t been outside in a while.
And I
Biting down on the wobbling of my bottom lip, I couldn’t stop the way I pushed once again at Harry’s shoulder, wanting to get away from this man as quick and far as possible. He was making me experience feelings that I have never felt before all at once, and I was going mad with it.
I wanted to do
Harry immediately situated himself into the open V of my thighs with his right, large one, making sure to keep his one finger pushing in and out of my hole with each collision of his appendage against my prostate constantly and giving no relent or break upon my quaking person.
And the damn man had that aggravating raise to his light brows that made me want to storm right the fuck up to him and slap that easy smugness right off his obnoxiously handsome face.
I made a small sound of contentment in the back of my throat, my mouth pursing to let out a breath at the sensation of Harry’s arm curling more tightly around my waist to press me further onto him, his free hand coming up to softly run his long fingers into the strands of my messy sticky hair from our earlier proclivities.
“A-ah! F-f-f-fu-uhk” I yelled with a shrill in my cracking voice when Harry let out a low hum that vibrated over my left ear and sent electricity down into my cock, his tone dropping an octave lower than usual as he let out a growl etched in threatening vulgarity when I felt the heat of  Harry’s hands creep up the sides of my ribs over my wet clothes, bunching up the fabric between his fingers and easily tearing the top away from body in a tick of a movement, a blurring motion that left me in a hazed state as my body jolted with such a rough pull of the material covering me, like I was a life size doll that the assassin was toying with.
I watched the way Kitten seemed to shake himself silly to dissipate my demand from his thoughts by jutting out the lush of his bottom lip and swiftly turning his head away from my eyes, the locks of his messy pale hair brushing across the cream colored, ruby stained flush of his cheeks at the quick dismissive motion.
Even the leg I had wrapped around Harry’s hips fell away, left to only dangle there as my body was only held up by Harry’s arms.
Scalding heat shot down my body as I  lifted my hips to drag the length of my cock slowly into my princess’ hot hole, feeling the tight, slippery, honey warmed arse squeeze enticingly around my vehement prick as I let my appendage shift Draco’s insides around to fit myself wholly into him, the disastrous need to turn this spoiled little beautiful bitch of mine inside and out like a crisp fucking packet that I can take amuse and ecstasy in was an overwhelming want that I  couldn't and didn't want to shake.
It gave me whiplash sometimes.
Is something wrong with me?
“Enough. You’re going to end up splitting the boy’s head open if you keep doing what you’re doing.” The low, vibrating husky voice of Harry’s words breathed over the plush skin of of my earlobe, the sound vibrating within the rapid rise and fall of my chest as my breaths stuttered out of my lungs while I whipped my head sideways to catch the assassin’s gaze with my own, our mouths a breadth apart.
“You know that I can take care of myself, especially with my own magic, and you even said a little chaos would do good for me,” I whispered softly to Harry, my lashes lowering over my gaze as I stared up at him with a pleading cadence evident in my large gaze.
For more.
so cruelly twisting a sharp prick into the sole of my gut and rendering me speechless as a boiling surmise of
It made me dizzy and sick to my stomach.
angry I’m sure. I am a
When I look at Draco, there was something so deeply twisted inside of him that I could barely stroke with my outstretched fingers, a burning solstice that folded into itself and created a vast abyss of its own destruction. His purity was left abandoned as well as the darkness that has been deemed alone from the beginning. I had a morbid yet enthralled feeling that once Draco touches the darkest parts of himself, the most lightest spaces of his psyche would collide and create someone that was a rare cruelty come into existence.
I stood shocked, my mouth set into a neutral line except for the widened set of my eyes as I took in the the colorful celebratory decorations, quiet shocked for once at the abrupt invasion in the Weasley home that I thought would just be a small gathering of just Harry, Ron, Hermione and their kids to congratulate both Harry and I in taking down Animadverto together a week ago.
Then the Gryffindor
shite! I just wanted to get some fresh air!” I hissed out my angered words to the empty air, the flush of my skin bitten cold from the freezing air touching every nook and cranny of my body.
It was already past ten and the party started at least thirty minutes ago.
I breathed out my shy whine into the quiet noise of the room, cheeks flushing as I realized the pure
Black walls surrounded us.
I sort of gawked at the way the square, steel door groaned in protest at being pushed from its place, the rustic appearance of its iron sounding out a series of squeaks and rattling as if the alloy was being moved for the first time after so many years.
I had to keep myself from flicking my tongue out and suctioning my mouth around the long length of Harry’s smooth fingers while the need to ground my hardened prick and wiggle my bum to feel more of Neville’s hot hand and muscled legs was high as I tried to calm the beating of my heart and my harsh breaths.
I didn’t give a fuck about what the cunt had to say.
And holy
I tried to keep my focus on Hezian and Chang in front of me, my gaze thrumming and creating a soft buzz of muted tones in my peripheral view as the two waited for me to hand over the money patiently.
But well, it doesn't matter.
The assassin hissed at my touch, grunting out like a damn caveman as he thrust his hips against my hand, bringing his one free hand up to undo the buttons on his trousers just enough to let the jut of his cock out of the confines of his pants and boxers. I looked down with fascination at the way Harry’s dick popped out of his clothes.
My frame was like a live wire, power surging through the bubbling heat of my veins as the inside of my gut tingled with a bombing of arousal and terror. Snatching the weak limp of my hands up, I subconsciously grappled at the floor as my thighs shook on the sides of Harry’s own, my poor throbbing prick swinging to and fro in the hot air as I writhed in delirious need.
idea. “No way. I’m just starting to get comfortable in my own body as well as showing skin for fucks sake. Becoming a stripper requires strength that I don’t have when dealing with grabbing onto a metal pole for your dear life. I’d be injured, plus, I’m not confident in seduction skills, thank you very much.” My words came out rushed and breathy, an uncomfortable ball of energy settling into the space of my gut with the thought of swinging my legs around without barely any clothes on as I ground myself against a non living object for others’ pleasure.
But the assassin was terrifying when he acted cold and hot constantly. And the situation only worsened when my body reacted to every little thing the man did.
It is floating, unforgiving, and atrocious in my agonized sanity, as I try to make it an acceptance in this beating organism beneath my rib cage. My want is rapacious, and raw, and devastating in its darkened state. Yet it has quaked in its shackles, blanketing my warmth to turn my skin inside and out as the flesh I’ve seemed to have taken solace in has become a charred layer of a sinister countenance, an outer manifestation that has represented the cruelty within my body.
The assassin was immovable.
And when my eyes swept over the tall frame of the Assassin’s, I let out a small whimper of realization to what I just did when I caught sight of Harry’s large bulge pressing against the confines of his jeans.
will happen to me. And I had to focus on the issue here.
I wanted to have sex with the man right here and now.
That’s when I felt the flush of my clothed covered chest press languidly against the side of Harry’s lean and long muscled side, my body being cradled like I was some sort of three year old child against the assassin with such an ease that I had turned beet red at the position I found myself in.
Fuck.
a demon. And surely it had a master to call upon to keep themselves alive and be of use without said master killing them.
Maybe he knew why.
“W-what was
They had a human body, but it was taller than any regular wizard or muggle, towering to a full height of at least 8 feet tall, their frame exuding sinister power as the cords of their huge muscles shifted and grew rigid when the creature slightly breathed, chest contracting and large pecs bulging as the veins in their arms and strong legs protruded severely.
What it was … yes – that's what  “it” was. “It” was collected into this sort of closed off chamber that I’ve shuddered and stitched together in deafening silence with these other mentally unstable and shame ridden impressions.
I took a sprint forward.
I was outright sobbing and moaning like I was Harry’s own personal whorehouse by now.
I need more hobbies.
All the while, I hoped the assassin would be staring at me, my bare back, and my perky ass so he could see what he would be missing out on for the time being since he didn't compliment me.
Draco woke up screaming and crying out his pleasure from my prick plundering him cruelly.
Krum didn’t even question why Harry and I needed no one knowing about us being here.
You can have me, you already do and have had me for years now. So
A tiny curl of my mouth grew more into a genuine smile, the space of my exerted cheeks a deep, flushed red from the exercise I just put my body through while my lungs expanded and deflated in quick successions beneath my chest.
“That’s up to you. I won’t be killing anyone to teach you a lesson if you don’t give me a reason to.” Harry’s voice came out in a dark response, tone growing huskier with each word he spoke and causing my breath to stall in my throat.
I hadn’t realized how stuffy it was in the house.
I simply stared back at Harry, begging him to let me go with the way my eyes practically grew larger, my bottom lip jutting out in a pout as I did my best to wear the Assassin down in his determination to prevent me from going.
in his sacrilege.
you for making me admit these things out loud. I hate that you make me weaker than I already am, I hate you!
The buzzing in my ears died down with the exhilaration of my kill descending into my chest to burrow itself there, my nerves feeling frayed and jostled about like some sack of potatoes as I was left weakened in the limbs from the amount of the new dark magic and energy I took in.
that idealization was. How could I be myself and not care about what other people thought when at the same time I was supposed to show a well behaved and proper apparel when in public? That never made sense. Doesn’t that show that I was supposed to care about what others thought about me when at the same time I wasn’t?
And Caetia was trying to calm me down enough to encourage my arse to get on the hell out of here and have some fun.
My eyes wouldn’t leave the prone deformed figure coated in blood and guts across the black marble.
Krum fell into step beside Harry, both of them ignoring my presence and assuming that I would follow, which sadly, I would. I had no idea where I was and this hallway was significantly creepy enough for me to not want to be left behind in the area by myself.
There was only one light that spilled through the room and that was the one bulb hovering by itself near my right, magically floating and meeting my head in height.
I was gobsmacked.
I hiccuped around a sob just as I heard Zereth’s deep baritone of a voice sound out from
I came and came and
I shivered.
It was seven in the fucking morning.
from the first time we met, even if both him and I didn’t know it.
Merry Christmas! My partner forced me to sit down and write this haha. This is a Christmas/apology present for all of you!
I felt all the air leave my mouth, oxygen drained from my body like an deflating balloon.
And of course, I snapped at Harry in the Malfoy manner I’ve learned to hone since I was a child, in reference to hide the raw emotions from spilling out of the fine tuned mask I’ve created and perfected for more than twenty years now. “You don’t
My stupid prick started rising up beneath Potter’s dark gaze and I wanted to smash a baseball bat into my skull from getting hot and bothered right now.
What’s outstanding is the fact that the food the Gryffindor made was like an orgasm in my damn mouth.
was loud and echoing in the hollows of my ears as my stomach roiled with a dipping sensation that went in either direction, as if all of my organs were being scrambled around while my head and eyes blurred for a vehement moment.
I didn’t look anywhere near him.
going to explain my weird fetish to my cousin for fucks sake.
The Gryffindor made a minute movement now.
A blush, heavy and thick like the running of slick and heated honey over silken sheets, overflowed across the expanse of my upper chest, over the sweat of my arched, svelte throat, and across the space of my cheeks.
My lungs felt like lead had erupted into its pumping vessels, hot and heavy in the scorch of my anxiety poking with fastidious and malicious intent against the inner cage of my chest, my mouth popping open to release ragged breaths and a whistling wheeze that made my vocal chords weak under the straining of my jagged gasps.
And then I realized that his gaze was wandering every which way all over the limbs of my body, with an internalized concentration that left me breathing raggedly through my nose as I followed the Gryffindor’s gaze on my flesh.
I was just about to exclaim in aggravation with my failed attempt at getting the potion right on my first try but before I could, Harry suddenly let out a discomfited harsh grunt, causing my attention to come back immediately towards the man as I took in the state of him.
I pulled the handle again.
I damn well starting
And I would get some answers of this Gryffindork.
I made the man jolt start back into a subtle state of conscience as I forced a potions spell made up of morphine through his body with my magic, his gaze bleary while he blinked profusely up at me as I stared down at him with a low chuckle leaving my lips.
