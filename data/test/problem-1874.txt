Everyone was back on Earth safely. Sirius carried Harry in his arms, Bruce leading him to the medical wing of the compound. They placed Harry on a bed after getting him out of his armor and into a gown.
is fine. He's off with Severus, Sirius and Teddy in our home in New York." Harry said, smiling at the thought of his family.
"I apologize. If we can get Merlin to our Jet, we can get him back to Draco in about an hour and we can see what he can do to help him. In the meantime, I'm sure Severus could stop the bleeding so he doesn't bleed out."
"We have blood to spare." Proxima Midnight lifted her sword which turned out to be a signal for some weird animal creature things to get off the ships and start running into the shield.
"Well, my parents were named James and Lilian Black." He was so tempted to say Potter, but he knew he couldn't. "They died when I was young so the title of Lord was passed to my uncle, Sirius. Then he died two years ago and I gained the title."
Harry waved his hand quickly and the gun in the spy's hand was in his, the bow and arrow was across the room and the other weapons the spies had on them were traded for small, little, toy guns.
Harry got up again and walked out into the middle of the battle field. He looked at Thanos who had teleported in a couple minutes ago. He summoned both of his wands. His magic was flowing through his veins like it did in the Battle of Hogwarts.
Scorpius nodded vehemently. Merlin smiled and got up, nodding at Leon, who was glad to stay with Scorpius. They were all in love with the little boy, especially Leon and Gwen. He had them wrapped around his little finger.
"You killed half the universe and you expect us not to come back?" Tony said, glancing at Harry, who cast a disillusionment charm on himself and got to work.
Harry rolled his eyes. "They're stored here. No one can take the bracelet off, no one can take the Hallows unless I willingly hand them over but they always come back to me in the end." He cast a silent spell and the Invisibility Cloak was in his hands. "This is the Invisibility Cloak, the one that belonged to my father." He put it over his hand and it disappeared. He cast another spell and the Cloak was gone, replaced by the Resurrection Stone. "This is the Resurrection Stone. It's purpose is just like the name, to resurrect someone. But, it's not the best thing. Whoever you use the stone on
"Wait. You said you've been on this Earth for a year, yet the Avengers didn't exist then. How could Loki know about us if we weren't a team yet?" Tony asked.
"We both did." Harry laughed, "It was funny actually. He proposed first, but I had been planning on proposing to him so we just exchanged rings and we got married a couple months after that."
He eventually turned the page to face her, sign at the bottom. "As Minister of Magic, you have the final say whether these two can be married without their presence."
That was odd. As far as he knew, according to legends, King Arthur only took his breakfast in his chamber.
Thanos was starting to take off the gauntlet when he fought off the curse and snapped the gauntlet back on.
Harry debated. He had been keeping the broken bracelet a secret from everyone for almost a year. "After he—After Thanos snapped, I noticed that the Hallows bracelet was cracked. I've been trying to find out why and if there's a way to fix it."
"Okay, okay, fine," Harry nodded, "Use the knock back spell, Dray. So we can have some time without them trying to kill us."
Then a day later, there was the rush of magic that was normally attached to a marriage bond. Now, Harry and Draco could feel what the other was feeling. It was like a tug on their magic whenever they wanted or needed to.
The five of them came up to the dance floor. Harry held onto Draco's hand tightly. Wanda and Natasha were the only other ones who knew what was happening. Everyone else was just waiting to see what would happen.
"He was too much like Loki, we couldn't risk it." Romanoff said to Barton, putting her gun back in its holster.
"And now Sirius and Draco are arguing about wine. Good going, Potter." Teddy groaned. "I just wanted some Firewhiskey."
"To check something out and pick up food. I'm assuming we're all very hungry." Draco lied. Well, partially lied. They would have to pick up food after or else it'd look suspicious.
According to George, it was the third of November of 2053. So that's what Harry carved in with runes in front of the Veil, along with the rest of the runes he put last time.
"Well, you know us. Always doing pulling off the unexpected surprises." Harry laughed, Steve joining in, "So yes?"
." He expected to see the dragon come out of his wand, but instead nothing did. Harry's face of shock explained everything Natasha needed to know.
Neville laughed then the floo chimed again. Both men looked up to see who it was. This time it was George. A couple seconds after George stepped through, Charlie stepped through.
There was a sound of wings and before he realized it, there was a dragon in front of him. Harry let his heart clench once again at the thought of Draco.
Harry hummed then looked at him, "Oh, it's one I made. It's used just like I showed you, to display memories without a pensive.
"You forget Life and Death are one with each other. One cannot exist without the other. To kill so many living creatures at once would bring a state of chaos in between the balance. You told me once that you feel all the deaths happening all at once. After he snapped, what did that feel like?"
The joy of having a baby around lasted only a year and a half. Everyone was so excited to have a baby around the place (besides Peter in Tony's mind).
Then someone asked about Thor's hammer. And a whole 'who can pick up the hammer' game started. Draco didn't even bother. He said, "As long as I'm marked by Voldemort, there's no way in hell I'm worthy."
"Okay, yes, we slept together. Happy?" Severus grumbled. "And if you must know, it was sixth year and we were only a bit tipsy."
"I don't think they've planned a date yet. I think there was some talk about a summer wedding, not entirely sure yet. None of us know how to plan a wedding. Tony and Pepper just went to a courthouse. Draco and I got married at a lake then made it official in a courthouse, so it's been a struggle."
"They're from the Chamber of Secrets. Salazar Slytherin's secret library." Harry said once he noticed what he was looking at.
Quill spoke quietly but he was crying, "No, you didn't… ! No, you didn't… !" He started to hit Thanos which caused Mantis to lose her hold on Thanos. "
Harry sighed. "The Killing Curse is exactly what it sounds like. It's one part of the three Unforgivables. It's the Killing Curse, the Torture Curse and the Mind Control Curse. When you use them in our world, you're supposed to get sent to Azkaban, the prison I was talking about. The Killing Curse can kill you with just two words. The Torture Curse causes you an immense amount of pain just by saying one word. The Mind Control Curse, is also what it sounds like. With one word, you can get anyone to do anything for you. The reason he's still alive is because he has a Horcrux."
Teddy let his shield drop as he was magically exhausted. He staggered as he was shot multiple times before the jet went away. Pietro, who had his back facing Clint (who still had his eyes closed and was still holding the boy tightly), turned around and saw Teddy with brown hair, brown eyes and the face of a 30 year old, and watched as he fell to the ground.
"Alright, let's get this over with before any of us get our souls sucked out of us." Harry said, already conjuring his Patronus with the Elder Wand. Normally he would do it wandlessly, but in an emergency, it was better to use the wand.
"I cast glamours on them. Most of them anyways. I cover up the patronus, the Draco constellation and the Marauders. I keep the Snitch and the Deathly Hallows out. No one knows what they mean, so it doesn't matter."
"The surge happened in Southwestern England. This is the biggest surge we've seen ever. That may not say much, but in 1970, we thought Harry, Draco and Teddy arriving was the biggest surge."� Steve said, briefing them on what they were about to do. "Do not attack until the travelers have been identified as hostile."
Banner gave him the knife. Harry cut a straight line down his forearm and let the blood drip into the cauldron. He had to cut his skin many times because he kept healing. He cleaned the knife then cut into Draco's arm, taking the smallest amount of blood and adding it into the mix. He stirred for a bit before using the Elder wand to pull on the magic surrounding the soul in the bracelet.
The first one was Draco's reaction to the nursery Tony had made him. Then it was the baby shower. Then when Harry and Draco asked Teddy, Sirius, Severus, Tony and Steve to be his godfathers. When Scorpius was born. His first birthday. One that really caught his eye was when they were deciding on the names.
"There's been magical activity in this house, Death Eater activity." Draco explained as they walked up to the house.
"My father had the cloak. He left it with Dumbledore who gave it to me my first year at Hogwarts. As for the wand, Draco unarmed Dumbledore, making him the Master of the Wand. Then after we were kidnapped to Malfoy Manor, I disarmed Draco to escape, making
"You forget your sacrifice, Master of Death. You would have died if it wasn't for your title." Loki said, still kneeling.
"Harry, what happened?" Sirius asked Harry once they managed to get away from everyone else and into the kitchen to talk.
Thanos raised his sword, commanding his army to attack. At the same time, Steve yelled for the Avengers to go. And so they did.
Loki walked out of Harry's room and leaned against the doorframe. "The Once and Future King. How lovely to finally meet you." He smirked.
"Draco and Sirius dusted... He's been quiet since the battle." Severus explained to those who were gone.
Apparently his scream was loud enough to bring the attention of the other Avengers who ran over to his location.
It took some time for Snape to get accustomed to the life in the new world. Plus when he found out he had to either find a job or stay home with Sirius all day, he took the previous option. No one seemed to want to hire someone with no known background, so when he and Harry went up to the Avengers Tower to ask Tony to make him a background, Tony offered him a job. At first, Snape refused, but then accepted after giving it more thought. He was basically a magical consultant and a provider of potions. It was simple enough and Tony, being a billionaire, paid him well. Either way, Tony still helped Snape create his background.
"Just one more thing. The High Priestesses built the Veil years ago. You cannot trick its magic. It is more powerful than this school."
Harry turned around and almost cried at the sight. His husband stood there in all his glory. His blonde hair, even lighter in the light of the sun. His eyes seemingly sparkling. A familiar smile placed on his lips.
"Well, yeah. But in this case, Draco was forced to make a Horcrux by Voldemort. He believed that if he failed, Draco would be the one to carry out his work, seeing as Lucius was his right hand man. And it helped the Draco was the one that we could trust the easiest since he went to school with us. A Horcrux is supposed to cause you to go insane because a part of your soul is missing, also cause whoever around it to be extra mad, mean, et cetera. Basically your feelings are dialed up to an eleven. But before Narcissa died, she and Draco worked on a spell that causes those side effects to go away. That's the reason I was able to bring him back. There's only been one person to ever survive the Killing Curse without anything to bring them back, and like I said earlier, it was me.
When the cuts healed, Harry took a deep breath and looked at Draco, "You bloody idiot. You should've told me you were under attack."
"You're leaving me? I don't care if you hurt someone, I don't want you to leave me. My parents already left me, now my godfather and my cousin are gonna leave me?" Teddy frowned, tears already forming in his eyes.
is somewhere in the building," She said, putting emphasis on Malfoy, as in saying she would never accept his and Harry's marriage.
"I found out I was the Master of Death. Which is how I can't die. I became this, the night of the Battle. To become the Master of Death, you had to collect all three Deathly Hallows, which are my worlds most powerful objects. Which I did. The Invisibility Cloak which I got from Dumbledore as it belonged to my father. The Elder Wand, which I got from disarming Draco who disarmed Dumbledore who had the wand. I became it's owner and master, you could say. And the Resurrection Stone that I got before I died. So I can't die. I can't age, which is why I'm stuck looking like a 17 year old.
Sirius looked at the dog that had formed from Severus' wand. The dog quickly faded away but everyone had already seen it.
Thor and a blue woman came out next. Rocket gasped slightly. "Nebula, where's Quill? Gamora? Mantis? Drax?"
"No. He was born in 1932. Supposedly died in 1981. Meaning he was 49. And we don't know the time he was alive in this world for. But suppose he came to this world the same year that you were recruited. So, from then to here would be 69 years. So he would be 118 by now. A wizard's average life expectancy is 138 years."
From what scans picked up, there were seven people detected, but there was another being that was emitting a very different kind of energy that they didn't know how to classify it. It seemed human, but it didn't at the same time.
Once the Avengers made their way back to New York, their minds finally processed two things. One, Bruce was somewhere off in space. He had somehow escaped in a QuinJet and left the Earth's atmosphere so now they didn't know where he was. And two, that Pietro was carrying Teddy's body.
When Tony called for an Avengers meeting with everyone, Draco didn't know what to expect. They were meeting in the Compound, of course. It was a giant meeting room, which was what they expected. There were 35 chairs at the table. Everyone who was dusted and those who survived were there. Nick Fury and Maria Hill were the other two people there. There was only one empty chair, which is where Harry would've sat if he wasn't in a coma.
He had his wand out in front of him, looking around for where Draco was. Weasley looked down and saw something, Draco didn't know what.
Harry snuck a look at Merlin, "In a way. Prophecies can really cause a lot of damage if not used correctly."
"Mission alert." Steve explained, pulling up the footage of where they needed to go. Southwestern Europe. Around the same place they picked the Arthurians up from. "What the hell is that?"
"Harry. Take a breath. Why're you bringing all of this up?" Draco asked, placing his hand in Harry's, trying to calm him down.
"Harper Torty… What kind of name is that?" Draco laughed (or tried to) a bit. It hurt how spot on that actually was. He probably would've gone crazy. Maybe kill himself a couple times just to feel something. He honestly had no clue how he and Harry had survived all those years on the run.
"He made me," Draco spoke up, "He made me make a Horcrux. That's why I never age. He told me that if he died, I'd be the one to carry out his plans since I was the son of his right-hand-man. I tried to tell my father to convince him not to. But it didn't work. The Dark Lord told me that he'd kill my mother if I didn't do it. So, of course I did it. After he was destroyed, my mother and I achieved a couple things. One was a spell that would transfer the fragment of the soul to a different item, and I did that since I didn't want the the Malfoy heir ring to be a Horcrux. Another was a way to keep the Horcrux, while keeping me sane. We did do it. And the last was to to cancel the change in mood for whoever held it. But, I can't keep it. I wanna destroy it."
Everyone was gathered in the common room. They were spread out around the place, some on the couches, some on the floor, on the armchairs of the couches, everywhere. Merlin and Harry stood in front of the giant flatscreen television.
Draco smiled and closed the door behind them, going to sit on Sirius' bed after. "Do you have any news on our Death Eater?"
Draco sighed, running a hand through his long hair, "Fine. Fine. Come with us. But no way in hell am I letting you make a Horcrux."
"Great! We need to catch you guys up on what happened while you were who knows where." Tony started. "Well, I'm assuming we all remember the fight against Thanos, so Steve you start since I got everyone here."
"That is not for me to decide, that is for the school board. But, for as I know, head of Gryffindor and herbology teacher, Neville Longbottom, will most likely be taking up the post."
"Alright, sorry! I just didn't know how to react!" He held his hands up in surrender. "Now you were saying? About the War?"
From what they could see, Draco was looking for books about the Old Religion or books about Merlin. When he found an old book supposedly written by Merlin, he stopped. He flipped through the pages. "
"I told you. You messed with something you didn't understand, and now look. Everyone is back. Your so called balanced universe is back to being unbalanced. But, the balance between life and death is restored. You can't mess with things you do not understand! You know where that gets you? Six feet under!" Harry laughed, “I think you forgot one thing, Titan."
"Lucius, dear. You've got it all wrong. I never tricked Draco. He chose to be with me. He chose to not continue Voldemort's cause! He chose everything! Because now, he's in charge of his own life, not you."
"I am the Minister of Magic, I can make you do whatever I want!" She yelled, more Aurors slowly coming into view.
Snape picked up the first book from the personal pile and opened it. There was a note on the first page, "Sev, I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did. It's a great book on the newer ways to use charms in battle. Lily."
Weirdly enough, they all became a family. The Avengers still didn't know the full extent of the Potters and Sirius' past, but they knew it was shitty.
On Merlin's first day in Camelot, he witnessed a man get murdered because there were signs of him being a sorcerer.
"Well, we have six months to get ready for this. I think in the meantime, we get some rest, reconvene at a later date and discuss what Morgana could be up to between now and then." Steve said.
The gala was actually a charity function of a foundation Stark supports. All the Avengers and the Potters (Sirius included) were dressed nicely and all slowly getting out of their limos. Steve came in a blue suit, white dress shirt and a red tie. Bruce in a plain black and white suit with also a red tie. Clint in a dark purple suit, black dress shirt and a white tie, Thor was in a red suit, white dress shirt and red tie that the Avengers had somehow managed to get him to wear. Tony was wearing a green suit, white dress shirt and black tie. Natasha was in a nice off the shoulder black cocktail dress with some red stilettos. Teddy was wearing a blue suit, white dress shirt and black tie. Draco and Harry wore the same black suit, white dress shirt but with an emerald tie and a blood red tie respectively. Sirius was in a red suit and tie with a black dress shirt.
Harry nodded (not that George could see that) and grabbed some floo powder before saying, "Hogwarts' Headmasters office."
Harry was silent for a bit before speaking up, "Give it to me. The piece of your soul. I love you so much and I don't want to be on this world alone. I can't die because I'm the Master of Death, so give it to me."
Draco looked apprehensive but ended up agreeing and rolled up his sleeve when he realized it could help Tony. "I hated it so I covered it with tattoos but you get the point." True, there were flowers covering the outside of it, but the Dark Mark was still prominent on his skin. Draco had tried covering the Mark, the black ink would still be there, no matter how many tattoos he covered his skin with, it would always come out on top.
"Great! Now that we have introductions over with, we need to talk." Steve said, as Natasha pulled up the street footage of Tony, Pietro, Teddy, Peter and the unknown male enter an alien spacecraft.
He handed over the journal to Loki (who swore he would respond right after Harry wrote in it) and stepped through.
"Okay, Merlin, first of all, take a breath. We'll tell them. Mordred won't be able to do anything to us, we'll put up wards around the place. He won't touch us."
"If you're talking about his werewolf genes, no I didn't. Harry told me that when Dad went to him to ask him to be my godfather, he also said he was worried about passing on his werewolf-ness to me because he didn't want me to be treated differently because of it."
"Prince... Right! The Half-Blood Prince!" Harry exclaimed. He pulled a mini trunk off a chain and set it on the ground before unshrinking it and stepping in.
"Don't you dare hurt Draco." He snarled. Behind his back he was slowly casting a spell that would release him.
A few hours later, the whole thing was finished. Harry pulled out a trunk and put the jars and everything in it.
"I'd figure out a way to have both of you. We already lost a child before and its not fun. I don't know how I'd react to losing you. I love you both so much."
It was in their room here in the compound. This had happened after the baby shower, so they already knew they were having a baby boy.
Harry nodded. "I love you so much, Draco. Even when everyone around us is dead, you'll always have me."
"I'll go next," Draco said, "Teddy. I never really liked your parents because my father wouldn't let me get to know your mother, but from what your Gran told me, she was an amazing woman. She would be so, so proud of everything you've done. Your father was my professor in 3rd year, but, again, my father told me he was bad because of what he and his friends did to my godfather. But, I know that that's the complete opposite of how he actually is. Your parents did great things and they are so proud of you. I just know it. I'm so proud of you too. Since watching you say your first words to now. I've always been so proud of you, and I love you. Harry, you're a git for making me love you. I hated you since the moment I met you because I grew up thinking you were a dark wizard, thinking that we were going to be best friends, then you go and make friends with Weasley and Granger and my chances were ruined. These last 45 years have been absolutely amazing, I have loved every minute with you and I know that we're gonna be okay. Even if we die, I know that I have lived a great life since I had you. Thank you for that."
Watching his son, Draco asked a question that had been on his mind the entirety of the meeting, 'What do you think we would've done if we stayed in the Wizarding World?'
Following his lead, Harry Potter joined in along with Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Teddy Lupin, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, and many others.
Sirius frowned, "Yeah. He was at Godric's the night your parents were murdered. I found him outside after. He was just smiling up at the destruction. He looked at me for a second before winking and apparating away. Definitely a Death Eater, maybe one of You-Know-Who's more loyal. He was in Azkaban for a bit. Had a cell a few doors down before he was taken to the MoM and never came back. Do you think he was pushed into the Veil? They did that, you know."
"Then wrecking havoc is the nicer version. Now stop talking and come help me with my wandless Patronus."
"Loki, hold Scorp, I need to get to my workshop."� Draco said, passing the four year old to the god then ran to his workshop.
"Why? He still needs someone to give him magic." Harry said looking up from his son at Severus who was concentrating on his work.
When he was done he looked at Arthur and smiled. "I don't believe we've been properly introduced. Draco Potter." He stuck his hand out.
"I was only 4 1/2 months pregnant, so the Aurors wouldn't have known that we were going to have a baby. They probably would've still killed us though." Draco took a deep breath and wiped his tears away. "We decided to tell you and Ted because October 31st is next week and she's all I've been thinking about recently."
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled a shrunken trunk from his pockets. He put it on the round and resized it. Then he opened it and looked at Tony.
"Well, I meant to land back in my timeline, instead, I landed here. But, where better to ask for help to where magic started? Or, not where it started, but when the most powerful magic user was alive. Merlin!"
"Teddy!" Harry yelled. Harry ran downstairs since he had apparated to an empty room in the house. The Avengers followed.
Minerva McGonagall had asked Harry to make a speech at the banquet the school was hosting in honor of the anniversary of the war. Of course, Harry had to accept. He even included Hermione in writing it since he had no clue what to write about. He knew it had to be some 'we survived and we should be grateful' kinda thing, but having Hermione helping was always a good thing.
Once the group picked up the pizzas and Draco changed Snape's robes to something more modern, they made their way back to the Tower.
"Well, the circlet looks good on you. Makes you look powerful. And the gold eyes? They just complete the look."
"If I don't get to Draco and Harry on time, tell them that it's okay. I'll finally get to meet my parents. And I can see Harry's parents. And Fred, Dobby, Dumbledore, my Gran, Aunt Cissy. I lived a good life. There's only one thing I regret and wish I could've done differently. I was an idiot for not telling you I loved you earlier."
He rolled the Invisibility Cloak into a thin line then shaped it into a triangle. Then he placed the Elder Wand directly in the middle, forming a line from the tip of the triangle to the bottom. Then he placed the Resurrection Stone in the middle. "
"Runes, of course. How else do you solve anything? Well. Take a piece of parchment. Write the following runes. Tīwaz. Radiō. Ansuz. Kaunan. Kaunan. Hagalaz. Algiz. Then the full name of the person. Include titles."
"As of today, October 31st, 2053, I can finally announce that Harry James Potter and Draco Lucius Malfoy are dead. They jumped through the Veil of Death in an attempt to escape the Aurors that had been following them since they had entered the Ministry of Magic in attempt to take it over. In this escape, they also dragged an innocent into it. Edward Remus Lupin, or as some may know him, Headmaster Teddy Lupin is dead." There were several gasps but she kept going, "Potter and Malfoy jumped through the Veil of Death with Lupin and now, we have lost him to what lays beyond the Veil."
Tony, Rhodey, Thor, Loki and Carol Danvers went down first to scour the area to see where they had to go. Once they found it, the ship landed and everyone got out.
Then he told them about when he got his first Hogwarts letter. He told them of the Hogwarts Express and meeting Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley for the first time. He told them about the troll, Quirrel, Snape and the Philosophers Stone. He told them what it was like returning to the Dursley's — because it'd never been his home — house.
This is what I based the circlet off of, if anyone was wondering: (right click to open in a new tab)
Civil War. Draco and Harry Fluff. Severus helping Bucky. An announcement. Dinner. Teddy and Peter interaction. Hope.
Pietro basically locked himself in his room at the compound, only going out for food every once in a while but no one ever saw him considering he ran in and out in a matter of seconds. It was hard on everyone.
He had been even more surprised with the fact that when he was about to sit down, Harry had pulled him into a hug. Everyone was silenced by the hug. Draco didn't know what to do except accept the hug.
Clint was on a ship, starting to leave with the people, when he heard a mother call for her son who wasn't on the ship. Clint ran out to grab the little boy. A bot who had taken hold of a jet started to fire around the archer. He turned so he would be the one getting shot, not the boy. Pietro ran over as fast as he could and stood in front of them, taking the shots.
"I don't care if it scars. Just please heal it before I bleed out and you have to preform a ritual to bring me back," Draco paused to cough, "Because unlike you, I can't just wake up back in my body two seconds after I die."
He probably couldn't go around saying his name was Harry Potter in the Medieval Times so he went with a different name, "Hadrian Black, Lord of the Ancient and Noble House of Black." He secretly cast a disillusionment charm on his hand and summoned a twig which he transfigured into the ring he has back at home.
"He brought everyone back. In doing so, he risked his life. He had been in a coma for... eight weeks before he woke up. But, no one is the same after using so much magic at once. He was already the Master of Death, he became something else when he used that power. He knew everything about everyone from our world. He probably knows about this conversation. But... since Harry was in a coma, Draco was the one who patched me up."
to get some water in there. He mixed a few drops of the venom, a couple pieces of the scales and a couple crushed yew leaves. He mixed it using a stirring rod. He kept mixing for two minutes then grabbed a glass bottle and put the potion in there.
Getting into Azkaban was easier then expected. Really, the Aurors needed to do a better job. Or maybe he just said that because he knew how they worked.
, that's our newspaper, was controlled by the Ministry, our government, and blah blah blah, the Ministry just wanted a reason for Draco to be sentenced to Azkaban, our prison, terrible, terrible place, zero out of five stars, would not recommend. I was sentenced with attempted murder, murder and assist in murder, none of which were completely true. Attempted murder because I shot a curse at someone with more power than I was supposed to. Murder because I murdered the Dark Lord who I was raised to kill, so I mean... And assist in murder because when I was 14, a boy at my school died during the Triwizard Tournament, and there were no witnesses so everyone thought I killed him or helped with killing him, which I didn't by the way. I watched him get murdered terribly by one of my father's ex-best friends. Long story short, we were in hiding until 2053 when we decided to take over the Ministry, found Teddy along the way, who is my godson and Draco's cousin, he begged us to come with. Accidentally got caught, had to battle my ex-best friend who was the Minister at the time and we fell through the Veil and here we are."
"A Mad Titan wiped out half of his universes population. That included... Draco, Teddy and Sirius. His husband, godson and godfather. He was left with his son, Scorpius, and Severus. I believe you know them."
"Will you two stop fighting for once? They're trying to enjoy a happy moment!" Teddy basically yelled, stepping between Sirius and Snape. "God, you're starting to sound like an old married couple."
Merlin laughed, "Me? Nothing. It was the Great Dragon that gave him another prophecy. He said it wasn't his first time dealing with a prophecy."
Arthur was, of course, at the head of the table. to his left was Leon then Elyan and Lancelot and Guinevere. To his right was Merlin then an empty seat, then Gwaine, Percival and Gaius.
Over the next months, the Potters, Sirius and the Avengers got to know each other better. Harry found out that he had a natural liking for Steve Rogers, Draco a liking for Bruce Banner, Teddy for Clint Barton and Sirius for Natasha Romanoff. But obviously, Thor and Tony Stark were also amazing.
"What about him?" Harry asked as his eyes narrowed. One thing was to ask about him and another was asking about his loved one.
"Okay. I may not be the best person for this since I only met him some years ago. But... He was sweet. He loved to bake, so he would always be making cookies for us in the compound. Draco told me that as a kid he loved the fairy tales they had back in his world. He was trusting and believed the best in everyone. He loved to read in his free time. Or he would go around tricking everyone using his magic. He had the most amazing smile and his eyes, no matter what color they were, they would always light up when he saw someone he loved. And his hair was always changing to represent his mood or just for fun. The kids at his school all called him Teddy because of how young and how adventurous he was, no matter how many times the other faculty told them to call him Principal Lupin. He would make the most boring things fun like just reading out loud for a meeting or whatever it was, he would always change his appearance to however he envisioned the person looking. He put others before himself. He was powerful but gentle. He made sure everyone was happy and healthy before worrying about himself. And when he died—" Pietro took a breath before continuing, "When he disappeared, he made sure that I was going to be okay. He told me that he would come back. He told me to make sure you were going to be alright, and I'm sorry I haven't been able to do that. He promised me we would get married when he came back. So I bought him a ring."
"I'm the last of the Black's. My last family member died a couple years ago." Harry lied easily. His eyes scanned over the small crowd. Seven people. From what Harry knew it was King Arthur, Sirs Percival, Lancelot, Gwaine, Leon and Elyan of the round table. The other one was a raven haired man with blue eyes, giant ears and high cheekbones. Merlin. Harry gasped on the inside as he looked at the most powerful wizard.
Draco laughed, "Sweetie, my birthday is in six months. We should be more focused on Sev's birthday. It's in five days, the ninth. I already have his present, but I'm assuming you don't."
Hermione stayed quiet. That had been a lot to take in. She knew Malfoy looked out for the ones he cared for (now including Harry) but she didn't know that he was forced into the Death Eaters.
When Draco arrived at their house, he went straight for his and Harry's room. It was tradition now. After so many years being together alone on the run, now they always go see each other when the other gets home. No matter what.
"Right, well, the Cailleach told me that she's after what he stole from her. She will come soon and she won't be alone. She has a beast and a loyal fighter. My soul guardian is the creature of the beast. She will make her appearance when the moon blocks the sun and the light are at their lowest. She got here the same day the warlock got here."
"Yes. He's probably the one behind the meetings. Argo Pyrites may be the one hosting the meetings but maybe he's not the one leading them." Draco started mumbling to himself.
As the robot was powering down, they all heard it's last words, "I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me."
"Make what ineffective?" Harry asked, watching as Draco reached into his pocket and got down on one knee, "Draco..."
"Here in New York. At SHIELD Headquarters. It's a secret location, so I cannot disclose the real address."
"You know what I just remembered? I promised I'd teach my husband how to play pool. I should get going. It was nice meeting you, Argo."
She had gone to Gringotts to pick something stuff up when the Goblins had informed her that there was a trunk addressed to Hermione and the Weasleys.
Merlin was back in the kitchen cooking, helping Draco and Severus with their potions, throwing pillows at Arthur, talking with Lancelot, making Gwaine (and now Tony and Sirius) drinks and hangover potions. The norm for Merlin.
Draco closed his eyes, taking a deep breath and cleared his mind. He called out from inside him and pulled on his magic. His magic was released into the air, Harry inhaling softly next to him. "Okay."
"Hi Scorpius." Pietro said. He let Scorpius in before he went back to punching the punching bag he had in his room.
"Great. Now, before you explain how you got here and everything, we need to pick up food and go back to the tower before Harry sends out a search party." Tony said, opening his phone to an app called FRIDAY and asked FRIDAY to order some pizza from the teams favorite pizza parlor, adding a large tip to get it done faster.
"No. I told Stark about a possible threat and he's looking for him too." He said putting the magazine on the side table. "But, based on what I knew about my cousin, I'm assuming there's something else you want to talk to me about. What's wrong Draco?"
"That I'll live forever? Watch everyone around me die? Never be able to move on from this life? Be stuck in the body of a 17 year old forever? Have a power hungry wand that wants to multiply the power I put on every spell?"
"What will happen to all the funds that were placed on the investigation to find Potter and Malfoy?"
Steve sighed, "Only Merlin, Gwaine and Arthur," He said, seeing the other Knights protectiveness over Merlin. "Nat, Rhodey and Wanda, get on the Jet. The rest can stay here."
"We can assume that it's the solar eclipse on June 10th, if Mordred wants to meet you on June 3rd, a week before the ecplise. We can assume he's going to try to tell you something about Morgana. Question is, who are you taking?" Severus questioned.
"So he knows Brucey but not me. They all know Bruce but not me." Stark pouted. "But still. What's the Killing Curse and if it's supposed to be a Killing Curse, how's he still alive?"
"Yes. I was almost a Slytherin, though. But because of Ron telling me that all Slytherins were bad, I didn't wanna go. The reason I was almost a Slytherin had to do with the Horcrux inside me. It was part of Tom Riddle, and he was a Slytherin, so the Sorting Hat wanted me to be the same house as him. But I kinda begged it not to. After all these years, I regret that decision. I could've been friends with Draco faster, I wouldn't've had to deal with Ronald and Hermione, but whatever."
When Merlin was in his late teens, he moved to Camelot to live with his mothers brother, Gaius. He had taken him in and treated him like a son.
Before Harry could stop himself from saying anything else, he was splashed with a glass of water. But his Polyjuice potion was wearing off. It was water from the Thief's Waterfall, the waterfall in Gringotts Bank that washed away any enchantments on whoever or whatever it hits.
"In our world, we use the Veil to kill people. Like you guys here have death row, that was our death row. You get sent to Azkaban, then you get either Kissed by a dementor which sucks the life out of you or you get thrown into the Veil of Death. No one was expected to survive the Veil, but they've obviously never been thrown into it." Draco explained. "But to answer you, Tony, I honestly don't know what they're talking about."
Snape smiled fakely and nodded. "I can try. After not really using Legilimency in a while, it might be slightly difficult, but I am still the best Legilimens in the Wizarding World. Now if Mr Stark would just stop working on your arm, we can get started."
Then came the Cailleach. George had given Harry some advice once he was filled in on what happened with her. He had told him to just tell his team because in the long run, they were the ones who were gonna help him with the Mordred slash Morgana issue.
"Harry?" He heard a small voice from next to him, causing him to look up and see Teddy looking at him with wide eyes filled with fear. "You hurt Mr Creevey."
"Don't worry, he's right outside with Gwaine. I just wanted to check up on you before they come in."
"Why're you here so early?" Draco asked while turning to look at Teddy who was staring between them.
"The circle is the Stone, standing for those of lost love. The line is the Wand, for power. And the triangle is the Cloak, the one who greeted Death like an old friend. It just so happens that it all connects back to me.
"So pay up." Leon said, sticking his hand out. Slowly, everyone put a small pouch of coins in Leon's hand.
They all nodded and went along their separate ways. Severus walked towards Draco and Harry holding a five year old Scorpius asleep in his arms.
On June 27th, they had the option to find out the gender, but instead gave the paper with the baby's gender to Wanda who wanted to plan a baby shower/gender reveal party for them.
"The man identifies as Doctor Stephen Strange. Sorcerer Supreme. He was in a car crash in 2017 which meant he couldn't operate anymore so he resorted to the Mystic Arts. He has a sanctuary in New York City. He guards something called the Time Stone."
Merlin, looked at where the Dorocha were coming from, the same Veil that had taken Lancelot. Outside the Veil stood the Cailleach.
"No, like... There's a spell. It pauses time. If you pause time, no one dies. You don't feel the deaths."
"Hi, 'Mione! Listen, I would love to stay and chat, but I have some work for the shop to do! Maybe dinner some other day?"
Stark whined. "I'm Tony Stark. Or Iron Man. That's Steve Rogers, Captain America. Then there's Clint Barton, Hawkeye and Natasha Romanoff, Black Widow. Then the giant blonde with the hammer is Thor. And the one sitting with the Doctor, is Doctor Bruce Banner, or the Hulk."
They went on for a couple minutes, Teddy still holding off the man who was still trying to get in. The other Avengers ready to fight if needed, while Banner and Harry worked to get Draco back.
"Tony, Pietro, Peter and Teddy are on an alien ship with some man named Stephen Strange who is supposedly the Sorcerer Supreme."
The two made their way towards the kitchen, smiling softly at the playful banter going on between the team.
As far as they were concerned, Draco Malfoy or Potter or whatever he wanted to be called now, Harry Potter, Teddy Lupin, Severus Snape and Sirius Black are dead.
Barton hated him already. Harry had insisted he knew how to take care of himself but Fury wouldn't budge, causing him to pull Barton out of training and introduced him to Harry.
"All those deaths you felt take a toll on the universe. Those beings that died are dead, bringing the ratio of dead to living off. Normally it would be around fifty-fifty. But killing half the beings that are alive brings those dead to seventy-five to twenty-five alive. That seems a bit off to me."
"I became Head Auror. And don't say James would be proud of you. I was sentenced to Azkaban with three murder charges. Two of which were idiotic."
Sirius looked around as Draco entered the walk-in closet. He found pictures of Harry and Draco, some of Harry, Draco and Teddy, and he also found what he thought was a recreation of their wedding.
Tony and Quill (whose name was also Peter, so now they had three Peters!) were arguing until Teddy finally spoke up.
When the UN signing finally happened, there was an explosion which killed the king of Wakanda, T'Chaka. His son T'Challa was there too and was going to go after the killed which turned out to be Bucky Barnes. Or, so they thought.
Sirius was in shock, he had his hand covering his mouth but his eyes said it all. Draco had tears running down his face, his hand still placed on his stomach.
"Yes, she was always good at healing gunshot wounds." Harry couldn't tell if that was sarcasm or not but he doubted this was a good time to ask.
Harry had a bit of explaining to do, but didn't want to ruin the surprise yet, so he said he was with Loki.
"I'll pass." She said. "I prefer not kissing men who probably haven't kissed someone since the forties."
"Well, no. I did most of it, but Draco helped me at first when I still wasn't confident in potions."
Merlin's spell had been one that started a fire towards who ever it had been intended for. Harry's was a spell that puts out the fire. The counter spell.
"Scared of what? My reaction? There isn't anything that would scare me into leaving you, I hope you know th—" Harry started but was interrupted by Draco.
"Well, yes. It hurts knowing that I'm going to outlive my son. Or my friends. Or my... I don't even know what to call him... my husband's godfather. But I've been doing to for a hundred or so years so far. But, anyway, thank you for your help. I should probably head back to the castle now."
He turned and saw who he thought was a mini Weasley. Well, not so mini anymore. Draco only knew his name from the Daily Prophet considering he was the Ministers son.
"Well, once we started our run, we went back to grab some stuff and I came across this book and decided to grab it. I hope you don't mind, we've been writing in some alternatives since magical items are really hard to come by here."
Harry popped back up with a dirty old copy of "Advanced Potion Making", the ones they use (or at least used to use) at Hogwarts. "This is yours." He said holding out to Snape after reshrinking his trunk and placing it back on the chain.
"The Death Eaters were Voldemort's minions. The Board is the Hogwarts Board, basically the only people above the Headmaster. Theodore Nott was one of Draco's classmates, both in year and House. His father was a Death Eater, though he never got the Mark himself. Moody is an ex-Auror. Barty Crouch Jr is a Death Eater and a previous Ministers son. He Polyjuiced himself into Moody and he's the reason I was in the Triwizard Tournament my fourth year. Neville Longbottom was one of my classmates, also in year and House. He was always scared of basically every class, especially Potions because of Snape, but Herbology was like the only thing he was confident in. McGonagall was Head of Gryffindor up until after the Battle when she became Headmistress. She was also Deputy Headmistress before the War. The she-weasel, as Draco loves calling her, is Ginerva Weasley, Ron's younger and only sister. She had a crush on me her whole childhood. We dated briefly after the War then I realized I was that the whole relationship was based on ifs. If we're gonna live. If we're gonna win the War. It was forced and we broke up about a year after the war. Which brings us to our next point. Her childhood crushes death. That was me. We faked our deaths to stop the Ministry from looking for us. But that didn't happen! We Polyjuiced some Death Eaters we found during our run from the Ministry and killed them. It may sound harsh, but they technically killed me first, so I mean..."
Harry just seemed to be frozen. He wasn't crying. He wasn't moving. Only blinking and breathing. Losing his godfather, husband and godson all in one day wasn't a healthy thing. But the fact that he didn't say anything said he was in shock.
When everyone was off the island and once it was blown up (thanks to Harry, Tony and Thor), the carrier made its way away from where the hole of where Sokovia was and resulted flying over Europe.
"Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers." A robotic voice said from one of the entrances to the floor they were currently on.
"So, the last time we encountered the Dorocha, we had to go to the Isle of the Blessed, where the Veil had opened. Lancelot gave himself up as the sacrifice, but he somehow survived. But, Harry, what's this Patronus you spoke of?"
"Well, I guess this isn't the first time someone faked their death." He shrugged, twirling his wand in his hands. "But I'm not here to talk about my death. I'm actually surprised you didn't hear. Your son, Draco died with me."
."� He muttered. "It's the Magic of the Old Religion. Unless one of you can perform Magic of the Old Religion, I can't properly help him until he gets here."
The reaction was great. They were all smiling and clapping, being careful of not getting too loud to wake Scorpius up.
Draco Malfoy was actually nice now that his father was in Azkaban. The thing was, now that his father was gone, he seems happier. He looks happier too, though the same he did during his seventh year (from all the products he uses, Harry assumed). He had been training as a Healer, taking after his mother, and had become Head Healer. He and Harry met up occasionally to discuss new procedures, like new healing spells Harry had to teach the others. After those meetings, they always went out to eat or just to talk. They had gotten rather close over the years.
Harry chuckled. "In our world, whoever possesses all three of the Deathly Hallows is the Master of Death. It's also a tale. A tale of three brothers. Three brothers came across a treacherous river which would kill whoever come near it. So the brothers made a bridge over the river. Death showed up, said to congratulate the brothers for their job well done by giving them each a wish.
Inside the Jet, Rhodey handed Natasha $20, Gwaine let out a chuckle before turning away and Steve awkwardly looked away.
"You have not been my best friend in so long, Potter. Where's Malfoy?" She growled, casting a spell that she thought Harry wouldn't see. It was a spell that alerted security.
They went on to explain everything. From the Ministry to arriving on the new world to Nick Fury finding him and joining the Avengers.
"Severus said you have knowledge of everything that's happened in our world since the beginning. I don't know if he meant the Magical World or the normal world." Merlin explained.
"Your godson got proposed to while he was dying and you think it's kind of sweet?" Neville all but screeched.
It looked that Thanos was getting scared. That brought a smile to Harry's face. Everyone would remember the wrath of Harry Potter.
The fight happened at an airport in Germany. Team Potter had shown up as well to stop the fighting but it didn't stop.
"Him and his friends, two of them who happen to be their fathers," Snape started, jerking his head at Teddy and Harry, "Bullied me in school."
After having heard (or read) so many names she recognized from Arthurian legend, Hermione made her way back to Hogwarts the next morning. Neville was in his office this time around, so she stopped to talk for a couple minutes before going back to Merlin's portrait.
"The Prophet is owned by the Ministry, and the Ministry wants everyone to believe what they want." Harry mumbled as he focused on making a potion that he got from the Half-Blood Princes book. Draco had sneaked into Borgin and Brukes to get to the Vanishing Cabinet and managed to get the book along with some other items like trunks, spell books, potions books and the sort. Harry also went but to grab some books from Slytherin's library in the Chamber of Secrets.
They now had a wing in the Compound (the Camelot Wing), each with their own rooms. Tony had purposefully placed the couples' rooms next to each other. Merlin and Arthur. Gwen and Lancelot. Gwaine and Percival (even if they haven't realized yet).
Harry and Steve found they had a lot in common. Both were war heroes who saved a bunch of people, but also lost people close to them. They both stood for mostly the same rights, equality, safety of everyone, health. Steve rather enjoyed the company of Harry after finding out about Bucky not being dead. They were both men out of time in a way.
." He cast the spell using the Elder Wand. Any other magic with any other wand wouldn't work, but it was the most powerful wand for a reason.
"Yeah. Here's an idea. Why don't you stay here with Leon and I'll go help your daddy? It can be a surprise for your papa."
Harry had pondered over that question a lot in the past years, especially when half his family had been dusted. He had hoped that after centuries of living, he would eventually get used to it, the loneliness. He couldn't get too close to people so as to stop people from wondering where he came from or how he looked seventeen when in reality he was an immortal being who had been around since 1980. He would probably just mess with people to get some feeling or emotional response out of it.
Draco had only died a couple times, each time brought back by Harry. No matter how many times they went through it, it was always stressful when one of them died.
Merlin nodded again, watching and Draco unwrapped his bandages to see how the scar was healing. Healing magic was really impressive. There was only a scar.
"Did I forget to mention that? Oh, yeah, I kinda got all the Hallows my seventh year and now I'm the Master of Death... It's how I can't die."
Gwaine seemingly perked up at the mention of alcohol. Tony noticed and laughed, coming over to pat his back, "I think we'll get along nicely." He turned to Draco, "Your finest, m'lady."
The Avengers tried a bit more. Clint went as a weird looking bird, Tony as a skeleton (he hired a professional makeup artist to do his makeup), Natasha as a detective, Steve as a vampire and Bruce as a magician. They couldn't even explain to Thor what the purpose of dressing up was so he was just wearing his usual Asgardian attire. Tony invited two of his friends, Rhodey and Pepper. Rhodey went as the Joker and Pepped was just wearing her normal business attire, a dress and stilettos.
The game went on for a while. Draco stood up half way through and made his way to the bar. Harry watched him go with sad eyes, not noticing that Natasha was watching him.
"Alright, so those are the books that could possibly have something about the Dark Mark, Voldemort and the Death Eaters."
"Yes, Harry! It's happening in six months. It could be a trap for all we know. He wants us, Arthur and five others, what if he just wants us there to kill us? What if he thinks we're going to bring five of our strongest and he'll kill us to get us out of the way? What if this is all part of Morgana's plan to take over the world or something?"
"No, I'm good thanks. Take care of them, will you? I know you have a thing for Severus, even if you don't want to admit it. Take care of him and Scorpius."
He snuck into the training room when he thought no one was paying attention. He changed into some sweats and a t-shirt. He didn't want to go all out and put on his armor, so sweats it was.
Once the Aurors left, Draco dropped to the floor, ripping his shirt off. Harry dropped onto his knees next to him, cleaning up the blood with Draco's abandoned shirt in an attempt to try to find the source of the bleeding.
"I have no clue what you're talking about. I'm here to train, if you want to chat, go somewhere else." Romanoff crossed her arms over her chest.
Harry pulled out the shrunken trunk from a chain and unshrank it. He stepped in and took a second before coming out with another trunk. He unshank that one and opened it. "Everything's in there. Minus some books that we've put in here. Hope you don't mind. But you were kinda dead, so..."
The ex-professor completely ignored that comment and went back to his interrogation, "What do you do for a living?"
"No. He was a military recruit with me. I didn't hear anything from him and all things considered, I assumed he died."
At this point, Harry found no point in hiding about his past. If he did, he would probably be confined to a cell for the rest of his life. But since these were the people he was most likely going to work with from now on, he thought it would just be easier to tell them.
"He's unconscious, like you were. But he's been like that for five weeks. You've only been out for a couple hours."
Two days later, a ship landed on the Avengers property. Everyone went outside to see who Steve, Natasha and Thor came back with. This time, Severus was holding Scorpius. Harry had changed out of his dragonhide into some of Draco's clothes but other than that he hadn't changed, he was paler though.
"2052. Granger was Minister. One of her and the Weasel's kids was an Auror. The she-weasel married a man but got divorced three months later, everyone claimed her to be 'devastated after the death of the childhood love'. Personally, I think she was just a gold digger." Draco snickered. "The Malfoy reputation was never fully restored after the War, though me and my mother tried. I'm pretty sure McGonagall is immortal. She was still around by the time we left. Just not as Headmistress. She retired, Teddy was Headmaster and now I don't know who is. Maybe Longbottom. He was Head of Gryffindor and Herbology professor. The Weasley twin left runs the joke shop. The one they both set up during our fifth year. He named his son after his twin. And my favorite part. Theodore Nott was Head of Slytherin! He taught Potions. No one liked him. The professors dealt with him but the students... he's just as bad as Moody slash Barty Crouch Jr."
No one spoke up. "Alright. So just Natasha, Thor and me. We'll meet you back at the Compound." Steve said and walked towards Harry who was leaning heavily on Severus. Years ago, Snape would've cursed Harry into oblivion for leaning on him, but now, it seemed like they both needed it.
"Hey, Harry. Let's get back to the Compound." Bruce said softly. He walked over to Harry and slowly led him towards the QuinJet.
"Oh if you insist. He reached to his waistband and pulled out his Holly wand. He put his hands back up in the air then dropped the wand.
"Dray," Harry started, "You're a bloody idiot. But you're my idiot. And I can't have you dying on me anytime soon. You're all I have left, and I cannot deal with losing you. So you can't die. No matter what."
"Harry was my school rival. I didn't realize until I was... fourteen when he almost died to a dragon. But I couldn't do anything about my feelings. We were on opposite sides of a war, him fighting for the good, me fighting for the bad. I made the right choice in the end, but it took a couple years for me to realize." Draco said, scratching a bit at his arm where the Dark Mark was.
