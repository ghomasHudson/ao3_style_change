“Harry! Where is this from? Did Umbridge do this while you were in detention? You have to tell one of the professors or even go tell Dumbledore!” Hermione was rushing was she was speaking because she was in complete shock and running off on autopilot of being a worried mother.
“Awesome!” That was the only thing Draco can think of to say in the most awkward way possible with a big smile on his face.
“Kind of… Yeah. I know it is silly, but I fear people might use me now that I am being good,” Draco says quietly for only Harry to hear.
Cedric’s soft smile just melted Harry’s heart as he began to blush before awkwardly saying, “cool, great, I’ll see you around.” When walking away he tripped on his rob, but at least he didn’t faceplant. Harry just laughs it off and quickly walked away to go find his friends.
Harry kept eye contact with Draco and waved. “I’ll see you in our next class together!” Harry yelled before bringing his attention to where Hermione was leading him, picking up the pace to make it to class on time.
Harry just stood there taking in all the information that he just heard. There was no way that Cedric was cheating and making out with someone else… is there? That is what Harry thought at least. “No… this can’t be right, Cedric would never… he is just too nice to do something like that to anyone,” Harry stated.
Draco was really worried when he barely saw Harry and anytime that he did, Harry looked so tired and was consistently holding his left hand. When Harry got to go back to his normal schedule again Hermione ran into Harry in the common room and noticed his left hand.
“There is also the Daily Prophet, I am sure there will be people wanting to question you. People like, Rita Skeeter.” Narcissa quickly added. This was something she was really worried about. She really didn’t want someone like Rita Skeeter to question Draco and then just twist his words and write what she wants anyways. Draco was slightly tense just of the thought of what the Daily Prophet has been saying about them. “Anyways, I got you something Draco. It’s nothing special,” Narcissa tells Draco as she holds out a gray beanie. “I thought you might have been worried about your hair making you stand out,” Narcissa finishes, and she walks over to Draco.
His mother on the other hand really didn’t want Draco to be a Death Eater. Since there was now, most definitely, going to be a second war. Narcissa didn’t want to risk losing her son. She was already a Death Eater, along with Lucius, and she didn’t want to drag her only son down this dangerous road. Another difference between her and Lucius was that she would be accepting if Draco actually wanted to be a Death Eater or not. She just wanted to make sure that this was something that Draco wanted because there was no going back once he joined.
“No idea, but it has great timing,” Draco chuckled as he heads to the stairs. “Meet back here after dinner? I already have plans to eat in The Great Hall, but I would like to come back here and hang out like we used to before you kind of disappeared. You in?” Draco quickly asked before heading down the stairs with Harry following behind him.
Draco shakes his head. He didn’t want to respond to it. Draco takes a deep breath and just does his best to ignore it.
Draco was lightly blushing but shook his head and smirked. He was going to happily take that as a challenge. “you’re on Potter!” Draco muttered to himself before heading off to his room and writing a letter to his mother about what had happened.
H- ‘I am doing pretty good. To be honest, it doesn’t feel like anything has changed. The only different thing is I don’t hang out with Cedric anymore, but we were also both busy, so we never really hung out too much. Everything feels normal like; we never dated.’
At least Harry didn’t make an empty promise that he would write to Cedric and talk with him over the summer. He just knew it wouldn’t be possible with him still staying with the Dursleys over the summer… again sadly. The days leading up to going to the Dursleys and being with the Dursleys only made Harry sad. Making him wish he could be with his godfather instead or even the Weasley. If it didn’t make him feel like he was being a bother just by asking he would have asked to spend the summer with the Weasley’s, but he just couldn’t do that to them. They already had a lot of mouths to feed and, again, he didn’t want to be a bother to them over the summer. At least not over the whole summer.
“Don't even fucking say it. I'm no longer in the mood for any of this rubbish," Cedric says in a harsh tone, quickly leaving the area.
“Draco Malfoy, I didn’t expect you of all people to be jealous enough to break me and Harry up. Apparently, being taken is hotter than being single. At least that is what the people I was hooking up with told me… That’s not the point! Stay away from Harry. I had him first, so he is mine, even if I just use him for the popularity.” Cedric glared at Draco.
Pansy just huffed after being told off by Goyle and stayed silently angry for the rest of the evening. Draco was not surprised by this at all and just ignoring her occasional
Draco was in the middle of chewing, so he covered his mouth with his free hand before finishing his bite of food he was chewing. Draco shook his head before speaking, “No, no it is okay. It actually feels good to have someone listen to me. I mean I have my mom who is luckily by my side on this. She was already a part of the Death Eaters from the first war so she doesn’t feel like she can switch sides without getting killed because she knows too much just from the last war. She knows his tricks and can think of that his plans would be just by how he works and all of that,” just as Draco finished his speaking the bell chimed. “Dang it is already time to leave?” Draco stood up and dusted off his robe. Draco held out a hand for Harry to help him up. “We better get going then, we don’t want to deal with Dolores’ wrath.”
“Well, aren’t you going to answer me?” Harry was getting impatient.
“I thought you were hesitant with whether or not Voldemort was back or not? What made you suddenly change your mind?” Harry asked, looking at Hemione with one brow lifted.
“Spells are just words, and they hold power. So, it is best not to say his name since he is all-powerful and everything. Plus, it just really makes me uncomfortable with… you know, about what I told you about earlier.” Draco talked about it, yet he didn’t want to bring it up again. He already talked about it once, so he didn’t want to say it twice in one day.
“Draco, wait!” Harry quickly followed after Draco. Calling his name out every now and then. Once they were in the hallway is when Harry was done chasing after Draco. This was his last chance to get Draco’s attention so he yelled, “I shouldn’t, but I need you!” Draco stopped dead in his track, heart racing as he turned and faced Harry.
This is where Harry ended up snapping. “Do you really expect me to believe that?! Do you think I am stupid or something? For the last week I was watching the things, you were doing. You were very touchy and always flirting with someone! This is the only time I walked in on you kissing someone else, but I am sure you did a lot of kissing over the last week that I didn’t see… I wish I could have just believed when Draco told me he saw you kissing some girl in the changing room, but I just had to see it for myself. I regret that decision, but I just had to see if it was true. I couldn’t talk to you about it because you could just easily lie about it and I just don’t want to get hurt any more than I already have.” Harry paused for a moment letting tears run down his cheeks. He wipes them away and lets out a sad broken chuckle. “You think you're super sly. Flirting with them but telling me you're mine. Building me up, but buttercup you lied. I've gotten tired of the games that you played. When you tell me, you loved me then you throw that all away. So, cry me a river… Oh and remember our date in the park? Yeah, I was playing super dumb while I was holding your hand like I didn’t know what was going on… I can’t believe that you of all people would go and do this to me. I guess it is most definitely true now that not all the Slytherin are evil it could be anyone in the 4 houses… I am so happy Draco told me what he saw because I can stop wasting my feeling on someone who doesn’t deserve it… Goodbye Cedric Diggory, please, don’t talk to me again. I don’t want to hear it.” Harry walked away quickly before Cedric could say another word.
Harry pulled Cedric to the side and asked him in a low voice so that only Cedric could hear, “Do you want to go to the Yule Ball with me…?”
“Well, it depends on what you mean by that because I have a feeling you don’t mean it exactly how you said it,” Harry states.
“Yeah, yeah I know,” Harry huffed before chuckling. “So, what do you want to do, we have time before our next class starts. I was thinking—” Harry was talking but Draco couldn’t focus on what he was saying. Instead, Draco was more focused on the people over by the bleachers. They seemed to be, possibly, laughing at Draco and Harry.
“I will not be telling Dumbledore!” Harry explains as he yanks his arm back to his chest and getting up from his seat on the couch in the common room. “Dumbledore is a very busy man. I don’t want to waste his time on such silly matters like this,” Harry looked away from Hermione. It was very obvious that he is still upset that after his trial that Dumbledore has been ignoring Harry completely.
That afternoon Draco spent his free period helping the group of Hufflepuffs relax and stay balanced while on their broom. They were just a group of very clumsy Hufflepuffs, so it took a while. By the end of the lesson, they were all laughing and thanking Draco for the help. Draco was feeling rather shy with people complimenting him and thanking him. It really did make Draco happy to be helping others.
Cedric was huffing trying to catch his break. He never realized that he was holding his breath during all the pain he was under. He stayed laying down on the ground, body uncontrollably twitching from not only fear but from the pain suddenly being gone. His body is reacting as he should still be feeling pain.
There was a voice nagging Draco, trying to tell him not to go and that it would be a waste of time. This voice sounded just like Lucius nagging at Draco trying to get him to become a Death Eater. ‘Draco you know that this is all just a waste of time. Why don’t you just send me a letter telling me that you want to become a Death Eater and we can have this whole school in the palm of our hands? Wouldn’t that be nice?’
A few more classes later and dinner is eaten it was time for Draco to head off to the Astronomy Tower. If Draco wasn’t sweating before he was most definitely sweating now. Draco was extremely nervous. On his walk to the Astronomy Tower, he was muttering to himself, trying to convince himself that everything was going to be okay. Trying to tell himself that it will not end in a duel. Draco was paranoid and made sure no one was following him.
“I thought… I thought…”  Blaise tried to say through tears.  “When Harry walked in alone, I thought he’d failed.  I thought…”
“I need to go.”  Harry’s shattered brain couldn’t think up any excuse.
“I really don’t understand how people manage with just two in a relationship.”  Blaise said, grabbing both his lovers by the hand and dragging them to the bedroom.
“Apparating to…” James yawned loudly and stretched, “…Hogsmeade later.  What are you doing here Dad?”
“No.  I don’t want to raise the baby.  I’m sixteen.  Why the hell would I want to raise a baby?” Scorpius was still shouting.
“Ahh… Fuck Potter.  You could have at least waited to flush.”
“I know someone was up there that morning.” Ron insisted through gritted teeth.  “Besides, look at the earlier messages.  It looks like he saved every one.  They are clearly arranging to meet in some of those.  Look ‘Usual place, 6pm’, ‘Our café 2pm’.  And have you seen some of the earlier ones.  If that’s not flirting, I’ll eat my hair.  It doesn’t take a genius to work that out.  They’re probably to the same person who sent the other message.  The ‘Usual Place’ is clearly a specific location that they met at regularly.  And then look at those messages that failed to send.  Harry wrote those, begging whoever they were going to, to come back.”
Harry wanted to protest, but he was too exhausted.  He kissed Draco in gratitude and headed to the bedroom, immediately collapsing on top of the sheets and falling straight to sleep.
Harry winced at the frank statement.  He really wansn’t used to confronting the truth of his history.  But Narcissa had lived with an abusive husband.  He thought she would understand.  “From what Draco’s told me about Lucius, my Uncle and him seem to share a few unpleasant personality traits.  Except it wasn’t my Aunt Petunia he used for a punching bag….”
“You can.  You can also tell me and Harry what’s bothering you.  Don’t try and hide it Draco Malfoy.  I know you too well.”  Blaise replied firmly.  Harry hadn’t noticed anything was wrong, but Blaise had obviously seen it instantly
“But… but… what if she…”  Teddy gulped, unable to finish.  He felt like a small child accidently changing his hair colour in front of his primary school teacher, instead of an of age wizard soon to enter his final year at school.
“Of course I will.”
“Sure, that sounds great” Lily replied, then looking down the hill she saw their troop of friends making their way up to them.  “Looks like our quiet alone time is over.  Maybe the house elves are psychic, or maybe they just know our friends too well, but it looks like our picnic for two is going to feeding a few more.”
The entire Weasley family were at the Burrow for Ron’s birthday.  Molly had outdone herself with food.  The cake, in particular, was delicious.  A spectacular creation of chocolate and coffee layers.  All the adults were sat in the living room, enjoying their food comas and post dinner coffees, whilst the kids were playing some overly loud game upstairs, when the knock of an owl came from the window.  Arthur waved his wand to let the bird in, and three owls, carrying a box between them, flew to where Ron and Hermione were sitting.
“I’m assuming Draco feels the same way?”
“Like they’d miss this.”
“Inside…”  The voice was very weak.  Draco was too cold to even shiver at this point.
“What do we do?” Malfoy asked.  It felt a little odd having the other boy deferring to him.  He was suddenly reminded of arriving in the graveyard with Cedric, and the eerie voice calling out to ‘kill the spare’.  He shivered involuntarily and closed his eyes.  This wasn’t the graveyard.  This was Surrey.  Voldemort wasn’t going to appear.  He was safe.  He had to be safe.  Life couldn’t be cruel enough to do that to him again.  It just couldn’t.  He pulled together every ounce of courage he had.  Malfoy was clearly even more scared than he was and falling into a flashback wasn’t going to help either of them.
“He’s still not made it back.”
“Yeah, I’ve got this extra transfiguration work to do.  Plus, I was hungry.” Lily replied, though feeling anything but as she nodded towards the plate of toast.
“What’s he supposed to do?” Potter sounded indignant, a hint of temper starting to show in his expression and tone.  “The Headmaster says I have to go there.  Look I don’t really want to talk about it.  It’s shit, but it is what it is.  I only have to be there a few weeks every year.”
Draco was worried that he was going to lose his new friends and even his crush. He hopes Harry will see what Cedric is doing and break it off before Harry gets hurt anymore. Draco had no idea how long it had been going on, but he wished it wasn’t for long that Cedric was being unfaithful to Harry. Draco would give anything to threaten Cedric and to tell him that Harry knows that he was cheating. Sadly, he couldn’t since Harry wanted to see for himself if Cedric was being faithful or not. He couldn’t bring it up to Cedric. He would just start acting like a good boyfriend while Harry was watching what Cedric was doing when they weren’t together.
“Don’t make me regret this Potter,” Draco blushed and looked away from Harry. Harry pulled Draco in close and hugged him.
“I don’t remember, what was it? I feel it had something to do with Umbridge,” Draco says and looks at Harry to see if he is correct. Harry nods before continuing with what he was saying earlier.
“So you assumed that I’d work out where you were based on that and manage to track you down?” Hermione asked calmly.
“I didn’t mean to.”
“Orphanage?”  Remus questioned.  He was curious about these odd little snippets.  Harry clearly knew more about the life of Voldemort before his rise to power than most other people in the world did.
She stared at the few short sentences, unable to really take in what they said.  Eventually she found her voice again.
“Harry,” Draco sighed.  “You’re a stubborn idiot.”
“Probation finished a week ago.”  Draco admitted.

“Yeah well, what can I do about it?  But it’s okay.  I can put up with a little pain.  Not like I’ve never had to put up with it before.  My relations have trained me well for that.”
“I know you don’t, love.  Can I please just, hold you?  I want to make you feel better.”
Scorpius didn’t think this was particularly helpful and looked over at Rose wanting to hear her answer.  She had an odd expression on her face, as if she’d worked something out.  Her reply, however, was just as useless as Al’s.
“None of us would ever tell the Prophet.”
Scorpius remained on the bed for several long seconds then got up to pick up the baby.  He brought her back to Lily and sat next to her, the baby in his arms as the two of them sat next to each other.  They both just stared down at the tiny little girl.
“You don’t look so good.  My house is just there.  Do you want to come in and sit down for a bit? Have a glass of water or something?”
“Would she come with us if we went to her?”
“Why are you telling us all of this?  You know Draco’s father is a Death Eater, and you have no reason to trust me.  You don’t even know me.”  Blaise was very confused by Potter’s candour.
“You poor sheltered thing.” Teddy joked, then looked up to see the waiter approaching.  “Ah, I think that’s our champagne.”
“Not much.  The limited information we’ve got has hinted that he’s very powerful.  There is nothing to confirm this, however.  From his school reports, even if he did manage Outstanding across the boards in his OWLs, there was nothing that showed more than slightly above average magical power.  What we can say is that he is very clever.  We believe that his success at killing Dumbledore was likely a significant contributing factor.  The problem is, Death Eater ranks, and the reasoning behind them, were not something we asked about in the trials.  We’ve tired talking to the ones we have in custody, but they all seem disinclined to help.  We’ve put a halt to all executions by Dementors until this is fully investigated.  We can’t have the procedure being used as another distraction.”  Kingsley had spent most of last night arguing over the issue until it had eventually been decided that until it was determined how it was done, the security risk was too great.
“Sirius.”  Harry called loudly when he thought he was close enough for the man to hear.  Sirius turned his head towards the sound and Harry shouted again.
“Did you see your friend?”
Lily shifted to sit up next to him and then kissed him firmly and sweetly on the lips.
“Tomorrow….”  Harry replied, trailing off.  Harry was fairly certain that nothing would make it better at this point, but he didn’t say it.  He couldn’t let Sirius know that he was fairly certain that whatever was really wrong was slowly killing him.  Each passing day just made everything worse and there was nothing anyone could do about it.  “I’ll be better tomorrow.”  Harry said instead.
“Not your fault.”  The voice was a whisper.  Harry didn’t respond.  Didn’t open his eyes.  There was a murmured conversation that he couldn’t comprehend, then Harry was being helped to his feet.  He was led to the bedroom where he was tucked up under the duvet.  The body pressed against him as he led down and sobbed was all the comfort he needed.  Fingers ran through his hair. Then the warmth got up and left him and he felt empty again.  It felt like eons, but Harry knew that logically no more than a minute had passed, when the warm presence was back with him.  Not curling up behind him now but kneeling in front of him next to the bed and pushing potion phial into his hand.  Harry downed it without any need for encouragement and felt the peace of the calming draft settle through him.
It had been eight years, but still Harry felt the pain of his old friends’ rejection of him.  Whenever it came to the surface it made Draco wanted to storm straight to the Weasleys and let them know what they were doing to Harry, but it wouldn’t help.  It would do nothing but stir up more trouble.  Draco Malfoy was not welcome at the Burrow.  Wasn’t really welcome in England.  There was something he could do though.  Something he couldn’t imagine himself doing when they’d first started the public appearances.
It was true.  The papers had mostly lost interest in Harry’s seemingly unseemly friendships with the Slytherins.  Particularly as all they ever seemed to do was sit and eat in restaurants or cafés, or take one of the children to the park, or go shopping.  It was all very boring and normal, which was how it was supposed look.  There were only so many times that they could publish the same thing over and over again and expect it to cause scandal.  The most controversial person he appeared with was Pansy, and even that was old news now.  Harry Potter didn’t care that she had tried to turn him over to the Dark Lord when they were teenagers, so why should anyone else.  Draco was a different matter, however.  He was still scared of the reaction that would come if he ever appeared with Harry, which was why he had put it off until now.  Blaise and Harry were clearly rubbing off on him if he’d decided that their first appearance together was going to be in England, immediately before the anniversary events.  That would make the front pages, of that he was sure.  Still the plan wasn’t to be seen, it was just to take a risk that they could be.  It was baby steps and it was a risk he could take for Harry.
“How are you feeling?”
“You’re lying.” Sirius snarled.  “Harry is a baby.  He’s safe with Dumbledore.”
“Are you okay?”  Harry asked, after hugging Draco for a full minute.
The next day came the news that ten convicted Death Eaters had all escaped Azkaban.  The Prophet was blaming Sirius, which infuriated Harry.  How could they not believe him Voldemort was back after this.  Draco and Blaise agreed with him about the Prophet’s idiocy.  Although Draco, along with many of the Slytherins, had a distinct advantage over most of the other houses in knowing that Voldemort was back definitively, due to their families’ connection to him.  The three of them worked even harder than they had before at occlumency.  Blaise had told Harry in private, that Draco had responded very badly to Snape invading his mind.  Although it hadn’t been quite as bad as it had been when he was in Voldemort’s mind before Christmas, Draco had been reduced to a similar state of pain and barely comprehensible sentences each time Snape had used the spell on Harry.  With that motivation it hadn’t actually taken Harry that long to start blocking Snape out of his mind when he cast the spell, much to the Professor’s surprise.  Harry was still plagued with dreams of wandering down the empty corridor though, which he had realised, a few days after the article, was the same corridor that he’d seen Arthur Weasley attacked in.  Harry thought that was a little odd.  He had a feeling that the longing to get through the door at the end wasn’t his, but he had no clue why he was dreaming about it.  He’d asked Draco, thinking that the only explanation could be the bond and that for some reason Draco wanted to get through the door, but Draco didn’t have a clue.  He had no desire to get though a mystery door.  When Harry described the corridor however, Draco recognised it and had told him it was the entrance to the Department of Mysteries.  He’d seen it when he’d been in the Ministry with his father several times.  The problem was that if it wasn’t Draco or Harry who wanted down the corridor, the only other person it could be was Voldemort.  Harry could now protect against outside forces from his minds relatively well, or at least he could mostly block Snape and completely block Blaise, the one time he tried.  He couldn’t block Draco, which they assumed was the bond, as Blaise had no difficulty blocking the blonde, and even Draco said his skill at legilimency was not fantastic.  Harry had tried Legilimency himself on the two of them too.  A similar thing occurred, where Harry couldn’t get into Blaise’s head, but Draco’s was an open book, despite Draco being much better at occlumency than Blaise.  The bond didn’t want to be blocked with standard occlumency it seemed.  Harry though that maybe whatever was causing him to see into Voldemort’s head might comply to the same principles, although why was beyond any of their comprehensions.
“Cissa thought he was going to turn out like Bella, didn’t she?”  Andi sighed. Understanding what she assumed her sister was thinking, was not the same as believing it was the right way to go about things.  Andi had actually lost a daughter.  She knew there was no pain quite like it.  Narcissa hadn’t.  Her son was still living.  If he was her son, even if he was a mad as Bella had become in the end, Andi was sure that she wouldn’t be able to stay away.
“Scorpius doesn’t want to give the baby up for adoption.”
“Fine.”
They stayed on the floor in the sitting room until the fire burned down, talking over the joys of each other’s lives that they’d missed out on.   They both knew at some point they needed to talk about the painful memories too, but for now they wanted to enjoy each other’s company.  Eventually Draco helped Harry up from the floor and supported him to the bedroom next to his.  They kissed once more before saying goodnight and Harry watched Draco go to his own room before undressing and settling into the silk sheets of the large bed.  He felt more at peace with himself than he had in a long time.
“It was bad.” Harry looked grim.  Blaise had opened his eyes and was looking at him.
“But….”
It felt weird walking through the streets of London.  They both had strong glamours on to ensure people wouldn’t recognise that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were walking through Covent Garden, less than a five-minute walk from the hustle and bustle of the centre of wizarding London in Diagon alley.  Luckily, they didn’t have to go there as the offices they were heading for were on the Strand.  Still it was strange to be so close to people who could potentially recognise them.
“Yes, I know it’s not an official apparition point, but the nearest one is Covent Garden.  I can’t see why the Ministry couldn’t set one up at Russell Square or Holborn.  Tube stations would be perfect places for apparition points.”
“The look on his face ‘Mione.  You didn’t see it.” Ron took a sip of his tea, then threw the mug down onto the floor, smashing the cup and sending the hot liquid everywhere.  “I need something fucking stronger than tea to drink.”
“Not all of them; a fair number though.”
“I don’t care whether it’s fair on that bitch.  If you’d slept with her when she was too drunk to consent, then I can’t imagine her family would be happily congratulating you on your relationship.  It’s their own fucking fault they can’t see that you don’t want her.  If you’d just told them straight away that it was a mistake then that would be different, but they’ve had two weeks of thinking everything is going great between you.  Maybe in a couple of months they’ll see the relationship is a disaster and you can break up with her.  For now though, you should carry on pretending.”
“Put your finger on this.”  Teddy indicated an intricate snake sculpture next to the door.  Teddy did the same as soon as Justin was done, allowing the house to recognise that he was inviting Justin in, and the door swung open.  He pulled Justin hurriedly inside, out of the awful weather.
“Holy shit, Harry.  What fuck happened?”  Ron looked wide eyed with panic.
“Not really.  You seemed to have a lot of issues tied up surrounding this, a lot of pain and self-doubt.  Saying something out loud and sharing it with someone else acknowledges it.  When no-one else knows you can cover it up and the world doesn’t have to see.  As soon as you speak it out loud its visible to others. Have you thought about talking to your friends?  Ginny even?”
“I know… it’s all very confusing with our two time-travellers here, but once you’ve had some rest, I’ll make sure they explain it all to you properly.  Your son will be completely safe with me and Harry… and Harry.”
“Okay, and when you do, you’ll explain.”
“I’m holding up about as well as could be expected.  I can’t believe how useless I was when I found him though.  I’m normally better than that.  I’m normally the one who can….”  Blaise stopped.  He couldn’t let his thoughts carry on down that line or he’d fall apart again.  “Was there any sign that Draco would do this when you saw him earlier?”
“Fine.  I love both of you too.  I’ll try and leave early if I can though.”
When the two of them got back down from the roof garden they found things had changed in the room.  They’d been gone a little while, enjoying each other’s company, and relishing the cover of the middle of the night.  Where prying eyes were less likely see them together.  Hermione had joined the anxious Weasley’s in the waiting room whilst they were gone, and Harry guessed Lee had made it, taking her place at the bedside.  He took Draco over to where Ron and Hermione were chatting.  Although it was a little awkward at first, with stilting conversation, Hermione and Draco quickly got caught up in their own discussion, which Harry could barely follow.  Ron just rolled his eyes at him and pulled out a pack of cards.  Harry looked around the room.  His partner chatting animatedly with one of his best friends.  His daughter asleep on her boyfriend’s shoulder.  George and Angelina both sat reading.  Arthur snoring softly with his feet propped in front of him.  Not everyone may be here but to him this was what family looked like.  Although it wasn’t straightforward or easy, Harry thought it was perfect.
There were only a few months left of school, but Draco and Harry spent as much time as they could doing any cute date idea.  When it came time for them to go home Draco actually invited Harry to come live with him. Draco was actually protective and didn’t want Harry to go back to the Dursleys. Harry was so happy with that idea he accidentally jumped into Draco’s arms when he wasn’t prepared, tackling him to the ground.
“Well, how can I prove it to you when the school only just started. You have to give me time to prove myself,” Draco quickly stated and paused for a moment. “Just give me a week. Okay? Just one week to prove that I have changed. I am sure I have a lot of you in my classes so you can watch over me if that is what you want.” Draco let out a soft sigh. He no longer wanted to talk. Draco was starting to get in a bad mood, but he was not angry. Draco was just upset, but he should have known that this was going to happen.
“It went well. Dad and I did a lot of traveling and got to watch a lot of the quidditch games in person. How was your summer? The muggles didn’t give you too much trouble now did they?” Cedric looks down at Harry while his arms were wrapped around the boy.
After a while, there was a moment where it was quiet. Draco and Harry laid down and were now looking up at the ceiling. There was something else that was on Harry’s mind, but he didn’t know if he should bring it up because he didn’t want to ruin Draco’s mood, but it was something Harry needed to know.
Harry started looking forward to his classes with Draco. Snape started getting really irritated and had to separate Draco and Harry many times in class because they would just not stop talking with each other and goofing around. Ron was starting to get jealous that he might be losing his best friend to someone who was a jerk to their friend group for years. That jealousy was quickly stopped once Ron was let in on Harry and Draco’s conversations. The three of them become decently close, at least they got a lot of new inside jokes between the three of them. And man did all the goofing around made Snape angrier by the day. Ron is still thinking Draco is up to something, but that was just a habit he would have to break once he learned to actually trust Draco.
Hermione was in complete shock with what Harry just said that she didn’t know what to do or ever say. Harry took the moment of silence as his time to quickly leave the room. Harry left the room and heading his way to the Astronomy Tower. He was hoping to run into Draco but not at the same time since he knows that Draco will quickly see the scar on his left hand and lose his mind over it like Hermione was. Bad luck for Harry though because he did run into Draco.
“Well, if he is really back or not, we should be able to defend ourselves and if he really is back, we got a lot of work to do so that we are prepared. Plus, you are a good friend, and I don’t think you would lie about something this serious,” Hermione looks into Harry’s eyes and smiles. “I think we need to start a secret club for the people that want to practice Defense Against the Dark Arts and those who believe that he is back so that we are prepared.”
Even though Cedric was worried about Harry, he was one of the last to hug and check on him. Cho was demanding his attention. He also decided to let Harry and his friends along with the French girl, Fleur Delacour, have their emotional moment. Since Harry did save her little sister.
On Harry’s way to Potions class. He saw Cedric flirting with a guy who was a Hufflepuff. He decided to wait around and listen to what they were saying. Harry was waiting for the question that would end up making him sad.
Draco snuck a bit closer to see who it was. He just knew this couldn’t be Ceric and Harry, but he had to make sure. There is where Draco saw that the person Cedric was making out with was Cho. Draco’s jaw dropped but he quickly closed it as he becomes angrier rather than shocked. Draco quickly pulled out his wand and turned on the shower Cho and Cedric were under, drenching the two. Draco quickly left the Changing room, making his way to find Harry to tell him what he saw. Draco was not going to let someone get away with cheating on his new friend.
“Thanks, Hermione, but who should we have as the teacher?” Harry asked. No one came to mind, but one person. “You can be the teacher if you want to,” Harry added.
However, things were not as great as they seemed. There was a period where Cedric said he was going to get some punch or to go chat with someone. Harry believed him and when he was with Ron, he never felt the need to look over to see where Cedric was. Cedric was flirting with other people and in some cases making out with someone… Harry had no idea what was going on just a few feet away from him. Even if Harry looked for Cedric, he would be hard to spot out since a lot of people were wearing a black tuxedo or a black robe. Plus, it is hard to see someone’s face when they are making out with someone. In Cedric’s defense, he did have a bit of alcohol in his system thanks to his older friends.
From that day forward they had become a couple. Ron was completely shocked, but Hermine called it. After they had been spending too much time together and how Harry would act when talking about Draco, she just knew Harry liked Draco. She was happy to see him so happy. She hadn’t seen Harry that happy in a long time. Of course, Ron threatened Draco if he ever hurt Harry he would have to pay. Draco was nervous but promised Ron he would do nothing to harm Harry.
This was the first time that his parents heard him mention being into men. His father was now not only angry about his son not becoming a Death Eater but also that his son was gay. It was a good thing that Draco had one support in his decisions and in who he was.
Harry never questioned Cedric about why Cho was there as his person to save and Cedric got away with it. When it took Harry a long time to come to the surface Cedric was about to just hop back in to go get him. He wasn’t a complete monster; he is still a Hufflepuff after all.
In Harry's eyes, the night was so magical. He was starting to understand and accept the fact that he was not straight. He wasn’t aware of any of the terms in the LGBTQ+ community, but he knew the term Gay and Lesbian. That was one thing he knew that he was not, gay since he liked girls. He only recently realized he liked boys. Well, that he liked Cedric. The more that he talked with Cedric though is when he learned the terms Bisexual and Pansexual. That was something he was going to have to learn which one he was. Harry spent a lot of the time either with Cedric, chatting, and dancing or with Ron and his date Padma Patil.

“Very well.  Can you let them know I want to speak to them then?”
“Course I still love you.”  Draco snuggled into Harry’s hug a little more.

“The alarm hasn’t gone off to say that anyone is trying to get into the rest of the Manor.”
“After today we don’t have to ever set foot back in England, if you don’t want to.”
“And what should I be doing right now?  Clearly you have an answer to that if you think that I’m doing everything wrong.  You think I don’t know my son is an amazing man?”
“Hmmm.”  Teddy pondered.  “I don’t know whether this counts as interesting but, did you know I failed my Modern History of Magic OWL?”
“My partner bakes them, yes.” Harry evaded the issue of gender.  “Gone a bit overboard since my accident with baking though.  The house is practically overrun.”
“Ahh, but you haven’t aged as gracefully as me.  Look at the grey hair and frown lines marring your once youthful good looks”.
“Typical coward that he his.” Pansy said scornfully.
“Right away, Missus Narcissa.” Tawly replied and popped back out.  Harry had told the elf to treat all of the adults currently sleeping here as if they were family.
“Harry!” The voice was familiar and came from the door behind him.  George had come to see Angelina for lunch and heard him scream at her.  George pushed passed him and went straight to Angelina, who looked like she was about to cry.
“Draco and I are from the future.”  Harry stated, stopping his dancing with baby Draco, and coming to a standstill in front of Sirius and Remus.  He said it as if this was something people heard every day.
“No.  Well I don’t think so.  They said they had about three hours with whatever they used.  And I’m fairly certain part of the rudeness might have been Minerva’s fault, even she admits as much.” It was true.  Minerva had spoken to her later about what had happened when she went to their table at the start of the evening.  They’d come in and ignored all proprietary and sat together, despite the seating plan.  The Minister had insisted Minerva went to talk to Harry about moving, even though she hadn’t been happy about it.  She hadn’t been happy about trying to get him to sit at the front table to begin with.  Hermione understood why.  Harry never did like the attention.  It was part of her confusion about the article and why Harry had turned up in the first place with the Slytherins in tow.  He had to have known it would cause a ruckus.  “Harry told her when he accepted the invitation that he didn’t want to be at the head table, but she caved at the Minister’s instance.  I’m not surprised Harry got stubborn when asked to move, although he probably could have gone about it a bit better.”
“I’m sure.”
“With the way Crouch is going after Death Eaters.  Yes.  He practically leapt for joy when I told him I’d testify against my husband.”
“You’re not the only one.  I feel so fucking guilty.  Rather than making sure our kids weren’t getting themselves into trouble I was drinking and making out with you.”
“Mate, you’re late.  Again.”
“Then they were probably left over from my supply of potions after my injury.  I didn’t take all of the purple ones as I didn’t like them.”
Harry fidgeted. Poking at the crumbs left on his plate.
“They didn’t manage to get past the wards.” Ron said, as he re-entered the kitchen, having floo called one of his Auror mates.  “Malfoy refused saying he needed his solicitor there before he let them near him or his property.  Harry showed up not long after they got there too.  They had no idea how he managed to show up so fast.”
“Seriously Draco.”
Lily came over to the sofa and sat at the opposite end to him, not touching him and looking unsure of herself.  She was pulling away from him and he couldn’t stand it.  Scorpius put down his book and reached for her hand.  She took it and he pulled her towards him. Having her wrapped in his arms made him feel better.  He wished he could just bury his feelings like this all the time.  He picked up his wand and cast a locking spell on the door.  He’d finally taken the time to learn them and he didn’t want to be disturbed right now.  It felt like an age since they’d been alone like this.  She moved so she was on top of him, her knees either side of his legs, which were stretched out in front of him on the sofa, as he leaned back against the arm rest.  He reached up to touch the strands of hair that were hanging around her face.  She leant back lifting her arms above her head and removed her jumper, then slowly and deliberately undid the buttons on her shirt.  Scorpius trailed his fingers over her bare skin, basking in her beauty.  Then she leant down and kissed him, her hand moving towards his trousers, deftly undoing the buttons.  This Lily was such a contrast to the shy girl he’d fallen for last summer.  He felt his breathing start to quicken.  He deepened the kiss and let him self fall entirely under the spell of the bliss her hand was inducing in him.
“You know it is” and Draco lightly swatted Harry’s head.  “Could we just stay here.  Hold ourselves up in this room.  We could have house elves bring us everything we need.”  Draco was basking in the warm afterglow.
“It’s really no problem, you don’t need to do anything.  It isn’t easy but Hattie makes it worthwhile.” Despite what she said, Harry still wished there was something he could do in return.  Then he remembered the conversation they’d had months ago about her desire to go into healing. With everything that had happened since then he’d completely forgotten about it.  He needed to go up to the school again soon to see Lily.  While he was there, he would talk to Madame Pomfrey and McGonagall and see if they had any ideas about how he could help the young woman.
“So how pissed are they?”  Draco asked when Harry entered the room.  Tom was asleep.  Harry curled up on the other side of Tom to where Draco was lying and gently stroked the dark hair.  He clasped Draco’s hand with his free one.
“You’re just insatiable.  Lets just lie here and talk until it’s time to call the elves for some food.”  He could text his friends later and say he got caught up at work.  They’d probably be cross with him but frankly, it didn’t seem to matter very much.  Being with Draco was what mattered.
It was obvious that Sirius had been drinking hard whilst they were out, and they found him snoring on the sofa.  Deciding to leave him be, Harry and Draco went to go and put the limited amount they were able to buy away and set things up for baby Harry.
“Someone checking up on you?”  His mother said this blandly.  As if it wasn’t a big deal that he was stuck on probation due to their family’s errors during the war.
Malfoy took a long deep breath with his eyes closed.   He looked so fragile and vulnerable to Harry.  It made him wish that he could wrap his arms around him and let him stay cocooned in the library.  ‘His little recluse’, Draco had referred to himself as.  It was true, but Harry didn’t want a Malfoy trapped in the trauma of the past.  The day’s he liked Malfoy best, were the ones where he was reminded of the boy he used to be.  Sharp quips and sarcasm.  Someone he could rile up, and who knew just how to push his own buttons in return. “Okay, think I’m ready.”  Malfoy finally said and started take deliberate steps towards the open door.  When he actually stepped into the corridor he froze, and Harry could feel the other man’s panic rising.  His breathing had become rapid and erratic and he looked like he was about to bolt.  Harry did the only thing he could think of.  He grabbed Malfoy’s hand and squeezed it gently.  It was obviously the right thing to do.  Malfoy started to calm down.
“Heya, mate.  How are things going?”
“It’s Harry’s writing on the note, and what reason do either of them have to hurt us.  It’s not like we went and blabbed their entire story at New Year when the press was all over us.”
“And you’re not just here to enjoy my excellent company? Tea?” George said waving his wand at the kettle, which instantly started to boil then pour the hot water over the tea bags that had floated out of the cupboard and into two mugs.
“I just wanted to show Scorpius, my uhh…”
“What you thinking about?”  Harry asked, kissing Draco’s forehead affectionately.
“Definitely.”
“Harry, what are you doing here?”
“They is not finished yet.  We cannot be showing you unfinished rooms Mister Potter. It would not be being right.”
“He’d need a special licence to make this.  It’s a pretty powerful pain killer.”
“Better dear.”
Blaise turned to the healer; he knew Harry had completely lost it but there wasn’t much he could do until he could be reassured that Draco was fine.  “I’m sorry.  Do you want to know anything else?  I think Harry might need another calming draught.  He’s not long recovered from his own rather serious injury and seeing Draco like this is hitting him pretty hard.”
“I was with her.  She found me in the classroom.  Your Dad found us 10, maybe 15 minutes after she got to me.” Scorpius couldn’t help but blush.
Harry Cleared his throat before speaking, “um, excuse me, do you know where Draco Malfoy is by chance?” The three looked over at Harry.
“I feel so stupid… Getting played like that… I should have just believed you when you told me about what you saw, but I just had to see it for myself…” Harry was not crying anymore but he was still being hard on himself.
Something in Draco had changed. He wasn’t mean to people as he used to be. He didn’t tease anyone that wasn’t one of his close friends. Over the summer Draco had stood up to his father. With Voldemort being back it was time for the topic about being a Death Eater. This was brought up to Draco by his father.
“You must be pretty nervous…” Her voice was soft. She was genuinely concerned with her son and how he must be feeling. She actually didn’t want Draco to back to Hogwarts to go out of fear of what might happen, but since Draco wants to go, she will let him.
They have all made it off the train and made their way to The Great Hall. Harry was looking for Cedric, but couldn’t see him anywhere. After a while, Harry started to get worried. It wasn’t till after they sat down and started eating that Harry felt a tap on his shoulder.
“No, I don’t mind. What is it that you would like to ask me?” Draco asked as he looked over at Harry. Harry kept his eyes on the ceiling.
Everything went by as usual. Once in the maze, Cedric wanted to get the cup, but he also really wanted to find Harry. It didn’t take long before the maze was messing with his head.
Harry looked at Draco’s hand for a moment before taking it, getting help to get up off the ground. “Yeah, that lady is so crazy I don’t want to mess with her. Any time she talks about something she has no clue about, like the fact that Vold-,” Harry paused as Draco was glaring at him. “You don’t want me to say it either? Why? The word holds no power they are just words.”
The room was quiet for a while before a few people clapped. That was something that Draco never thought was going to happen after his speech. McGonagall Thanked Draco for his kind words and started the hat sorting ceremony. To Draco, it felt like the air around him lightened up. It didn’t feel like it was hard to breathe anymore, he felt more relaxed than ever before. It really felt like he was starting all over again. It was like he was back in his 1
“Whatever~” Harry smiled with a light blush on his face. Harry’s heart was doing jumping jacks at this point, and he had a feeling he knew what this meant. There was a long pause of silence and Draco could tell that something was on Harry’s mind.
“Oh really? Go on then, tell me. I am curious.” Harry crossed his arms and stared at Draco.
“Because all you have been doing is stuffing your face and I would appreciate the help!” Hermione exclaimed as she pouted slightly at Ron to get him to agree to help.
“You know, about wanting to be good. Ever since I woke up near the end of the war, I just knew that you were going to change.” Harry turn and looked into Draco’s eyes. “I know that you helped wake me up Draco,” Harry said with a small smile on his face.
Harry was in the courtyard with Ron eating some sweets they got from Fred and George. Harry looked over Ron’s shoulder and saw Draco running around looking around like he was looking for something.
~,” Draco smiles lovingly before leaning in a giving Harry a soft kiss on the lips.
“Sorry about that. You remember when we had our first lunch up here in the tower?” Harry asked and all Draco does is nod. “Well, I did exactly what I was trying to avoid,” Harry paused for a moment to see if Draco can remember what he was talking about.
Harry of course told Cho that he was already going with someone. Before Cho asked “who” he quickly told her that it was meant to be a surprise. Cho was confused and sighed before accepting that she would have to find someone else and leaving, letting Harry get to class.
“Prat,” Harry whispered before chuckling lightly. Draco smiled and hugged Harry back.
Before the conversation could continue Mr. Slughorn walked into class, signaling that it was going to start and to everyone to take their seat. Harry huffed and leaned close to Draco and whispered, “meet me at the Astronomy Tower after dinner.” That was all Harry said before he walked off to his seat. For the rest of class, all Draco could think about was what was going to happen at the Astronomy Tower. Draco was getting very nervous. All he could hope for is that it does not turn out to be a duel.
was interested in him. Cedric thought for a while and then said, “Yeah, I’d like that.”
“Oh, don’t play pretend Draco, I knew it was you. I could sense it moments before I woke up. I heard your mom’s voice asking you if I was okay,” Harry quickly said as he moved a hand to Draco’s chin, moving it to force Draco to look at Harry again. “Don’t lie to me, I know what I heard and felt,” Harry paused for a moment. “I just want to know how? How exactly did you help to wake me up?”
“Just an encounter with Weasley. He was very mad at me. He doesn’t believe me and thinks this is all just a front I am putting on for you all to believe I’m good,” Draco sighed softly, not daring to look at Harry. “If you are just going to intimidate me as Weasley did, I’m not interested.” Draco coldly stated, just hoping Harry would walk away to his seat.
“Geeze thanks… it’s nothing, it is not like you would believe me if I told you always,” Draco didn’t mean for it to sound as cold as it did, but he couldn’t help it. Draco looked away and opened his book to the page needed for today’s lesson.
But there was that one week where Harry couldn’t see anyone because he was stuck in detention with Dolores Umbridge.
Without even thinking Draco blurted out, “I don’t think there is anything you can do about the people making fun of me because I am gay…shit…” Draco didn’t mean for that to happen, his emotions were just getting the best of him. He really didn’t want to tell Harry yet as Draco wasn’t sure how Harry would react. “I… I’m so sorry I didn’t mean… I should go,” Draco quickly said, and he turns and ran away from Harry going into the building. He was trying to go to his room and just lock himself away in there till things cooled down. He wasn’t sure Harry was mad or not, but he just needed to get away for a while in case Harry was mad.
“I know all of you were probably not expecting me to be here today and I completely get that. I just wanted to say… I am so very sorry for all the things that I have said and done to the people in this school. To be honest I was all talk and some of you already know that. I have already sent my apologies in the form of letters to the people I have affected the most, but I just want to say it again. I am sorry for making fun of people and calling some mudbloods, especially you Hermione. I am sorry to all of the Weasleys for making fun of them,” Draco paused before looking over at Harry Potter. “I am also extremely sorry to Potter. I know I didn’t send you a letter, I just didn’t know what to say. I was a thorn in your side just because of the people you hung out with and because I was honestly jealous of you. I hope that one day you all can forgive me. Believe it or not, I really want to change for the better, I just hope you all will let me… Thank you.” Draco stepped away from the podium and went back to his seat.
“Biscuits or cakes?”  Harry asked, noting the array of ingredients and bowls scattered around.
“Yes.  We’ve always managed at home before though.  With Harry and Draco’s mind-healer’s help.  We always manage him at home.”  Blaise’s voice broke slightly over the last sentence, but he couldn’t break down again now.  Not with both Harry and Draco in a state.
“Not…  Harry, you don’t stay at home with me.  Blaise stays with me.  The Ministry doesn’t give you the time off.  I was surprised when you were at the hospital so much.  Pleased, but surprised.  You can’t push it with your boss any more than that though.  When Blaise left, I assumed I’d be by myself for the day.  I have Tara coming at midday.”
Harry reached over and took Blaise’s hand.  It was the closest they could get to an embrace for the moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Could you have not waited till I was done to do that?”  Draco said from behind the shower curtain.
“Neither do I.”
“So do I.  The two of us would have made a dreadful couple, and you definitely wouldn’t have had more than one child.” Draco replied, looking round at the three children that Astoria wouldn’t have changed for the world.  “I believe I could have done my pure blood duty and managed to produce an heir, though.”  Draco said slyly.  “It would have taken a lot of alcohol and potions, but I could have managed it once, I think.  The whole completely and utterly gay thing, would have more than likely ruled out more than that however.”
“How do you know?”
He woke up under the duvet.  Draco must have tucked him in at some point.  There were warm arms around him.  Turning over, he found Draco.  He wasn’t asleep, but is lying there cuddling up to Harry and stoking his hair.  Harry gives his blonde lover a sleepy kiss.
“Not sick?  Then why is she in the hospital wing?  Why are my parents here?” Al said a puzzled and concerned expression crossing his features.  Scorpius saw it when Al finally clicked.  “Shit.  She’s pregnant, isn’t she?  That’s why she’d been avoiding you all these weeks.” Then another flash of awareness.  “Rosie worked it out!  After you came to speak to us, she was really quiet for the rest of our rounds and wouldn’t tell me why. Then she ran off saying she needed to speak to Lily.”
__________________
The estates agents he had used for Grimmauld place dealt with both muggle and wizarding houses.  The pictures in the window showed one set of pictures to muggles, whilst an entirely different set were visible to those with magical ability. One of the images not visible to muggles was not a picture but instructions to wizards to ask for Anthony Edgecome on entering.  Harry entered and following the instructions was shown straight through the back room.  Harry wasn’t exactly sure how this joint enterprise worked, and had never been shown to somebody by any of the variety of names that the sign seemed to choose at random for wizards to ask for.  All he knew was that those after magical property read the sign outside and asked for the current name, whilst muggles did not.
“Well, it’s a good job I’m not here to meet Lily. I was looking for you.”
“I think she’s asleep.” Draco whispered, as softly as he could manage, not wanting to wake Callie now she was finally settled.
“Harry.  Where were you?  We thought you’d been expelled.”  Hermione said, with worry evident in her tone.
“He won’t ever be forced to be branded by a monster.”
“Please Draco.” He said, reaching his hand out to stroke Draco’s cheek lightly with his thumb.  Draco didn’t respond for several minutes.  They just sat there.  Staring into each other’s eyes.
of December.  They think my testimony will be enough to convict him.”  Her voice was a little shaky, but her mouth was set in a determined thin line.
“Do you see your sister much?” Hermione asked, still staring at the photo.
“You could tell them you’re in a relationship.  They won’t care that it’s two men you’re seeing.  And I don’t think they’ll care so much about him being sick.  It’s not like he can help it and he’s getting all the right treatment.”
perfect saviour.  He belonged to them, and it was that he loathed as much as the hero worship.  He couldn’t say the work was even interesting.  Right now, he was sat flicking through bits of paperwork, and trying to take notes on some piece of legislation involving the illegal use of certain ingredients in potions.  He did not care one jot about it and was probably going to fail the test he was meant to have next week on the subject.  Not that it mattered.  No one cared about his marks.  All that mattered was that he was Harry Potter.  His mind kept on drifting to the meeting with Kingsley he had soon, about Draco’s progress, which wasn’t exactly helping his sour mood.  He decided to give up with the revising.  He headed down to the lobby and grabbed one of the appalling cups of muddy, over-brewed, and slightly burnt tasting coffee from the staff canteen.  He took a sip.  It really was awful.  The best thing that could be said about it was that it was hot.   Still he drank it as he made his way back to the lift, and up to Kingsley’s office.  He threw what was left in a bin, just before he knocked.
Teddy didn’t look up from his drawing, for which Harry was glad.  He knew if Teddy noticed the two of them going off to the other part of the play area, he’d want to come too.  Harry was fine in making a few muggles think he and Draco were under sixteen, but he wasn’t taking his not yet three-year-old godson into the play area designed for older children.
“Sorry, I’ve got to go back to work.  I met Marvin Kingston, the captain of the England quidditch team last night.  He promised me an interview and a chance to watch the team training today.  I should be back for dinner though.  I thought we could have poached salmon and new potatoes with fresh greens.”  ‘Nice of her to have decided what I’m cooking for dinner tonight’ Harry thought to himself, still feeling resentful about that his wife hadn’t deemed him important enough to inform that she would be out all night.
“Zabini?  What are you doing here?”
“Fine.  There’s an empty classroom not far away, we’ll go there and lock the door.”  Draco got up and started walking.  He looked back after taking a couple of steps and saw the Gryffindor boy stood as if frozen to the spot in shock.  “Are you coming?”  Draco said, starting to feel very annoyed now. Potter seemed to shake himself out of the shock and started towards him.  It didn’t take long for the two of them to reach the classroom, and Draco set a few locking charms on the door before taking a seat in one of the chairs.
“I’m Harry.  And you gave me this scar.  But I don’t hold it against you…”
Draco looked like he wanted to hug his aunt too.  He was shifting on his feet and looking the picture of an incredibly awkward pureblood.  Harry noticed and grabbed Draco’s hand, pulling him to join the embrace.
“Come on now.  I want better answers than that.” Tara chastised.
“Yes.  He’s sentenced to the same anyway.  I don’t know why he’s fighting it; he’s only delaying the inevitable.  Tell him we’re protecting Narcissa too.  He’d do anything for his family.”  To Harry’s relief, Blaise didn’t seem disgusted.  Just pragmatic. Harry sighed in relief.
“Oi, they don’t hold a candle to us.  If you’re not careful, you’ll end up with that bottle of wine you’re currently pouring yourself a glass from, being emptied over your head.”
“I know you would Pansy.  But we’re really trying it this time.”
“When did you decide that?” Narcissa inquired, now sounding put out.  “You never spoke to me or Andi about it.”
Despite her assurances earlier, Scorpius had known this was coming.  It still managed to throw him off a little though.
“That won’t be necessary.” Draco said, and took one of Harry’s hand’s in his. “It’s okay, love.  We can trust them.” He said quietly just to Harry.  Harry squeezed his hand and dropped the glamours.
“You’re seeing a therapist?  I thought you always resisted that.  Not that it’s a bad thing, I think it’s great that you’re talking to someone.”
“And you’re a git.”
Harry whispered this last statement longingly.  The remark was harder on Draco than he thought it had any right to be.  He’d pushed aside all thoughts of this man for over 20 years.  They had each made their decisions at the time.  He didn’t know what to do, yet he couldn’t let Harry Potter leave by himself in this state.  He also didn’t fancy contacting any of Potter’s friends to come and collect him. Merlin only knew what Potter might say.
“I am.”  Teddy responded.  “Justin, do you need a few more minutes?”
Harry ended up being 20 minutes late to meet Ron and Hermione at the pub.  Try as he might he could not get all of the damn paint out of his hair.  Eventually he just gave up and left it.  When he walked into the familiar London pub, he saw his friends over at their usual corner table.  He waved at them before heading to the bar to order a pint.  This pub was pretty lax on checking IDs, and even if they did check, a quick confundus usually took care of it.  It wasn’t like he was far off his 18
“Thank you for your condolences.”
“Harry.  I’m glad to see you looking better.”
“The Aurors were there to try and arrest me, weren’t they?” He knew the answer, but it felt as good a place to start as any.
“Well the world isn’t fair.  If the world was fair you would have grown up with a family that loved you, instead of having to forge one with the first people that accepted you.  I wouldn’t have had a father that tortured me and forced me to bed the knee to a mad man.  If the world was fair, I would be able to walk down Diagon Alley, without being afraid of someone hexing me.  I would be able to be seen holding your hand whilst we shopped in Hogsmeade.  The world isn’t fair.  You are going to marry the Weasley girl in six weeks and be part of the family, like you used to dream of.  The public is going to have their great Auror.  You can spend your days fighting against evil and catching all of the nasty dark wizards still roaming the country before they force their children to follow in their footsteps.  You will have a great life, Harry Potter.”
Neville lived on the Hogwarts grounds in a cottage attached to the greenhouses.  The cottage had been built during the repairs after the war.  Deciding not to apparate such a long distance and not fancying walking across the Hogwarts grounds, filled with his children’s school mates, he fire-called the cottage.  Harry couldn’t see Neville with just his head poking through the fire.  Getting no reply on calling out he decided to step through the fireplace, assuming that Neville was in one of the greenhouses.  Harry found Neville in greenhouse two.  This greenhouse was full of plants found in both the magical and muggle world and was by far the safest of the 4 greenhouses Hogwarts now had.  Butterflies and other insects darted around between the sweet-smelling plants and flowers.  This greenhouse had been a new addition after the war and was used in both muggle studies and herbology.
Ron thrust the paper into her hands.  When she saw the lead article, she promptly forgot all about breakfast.
“Oh.”  Harry had completely forgotten about the fact that the clothes he’d been wearing were soaked in Draco’s blood.  “It’s not mine.”
“We all hate this too, Harry.”  Narcissa soothed.
“Sure Dad.” Lily replied.  “Are you going to be gone long?”
Harry felt a lot better after he’d left George.  Some of the weight of guilt had lifted.  Again, Harry apparated rather than walking.  When he walked into the centre he was greeted with smiles by the other members of staff.  Even though it had only been two days since he’d been here, so much had happened it felt like longer.
“Okay, Harry.” She hesitantly used his name. “But I don’t know what I can do to help.  I only really know what it was like for me.”
“Of course I came.  You ask.  I come.  That’s how this little arrangement works right.” There was a bitterness in Draco’s tone as he said this.  “Besides, this is my last chance to have you.  It is the night before your wedding.  After tomorrow we can’t see each other.”
“Draco, it’s alright.  I’m here” Harry sat up and put his arms around Draco, holding him tight.  He tried he hardest to send all of the feelings of love and safety he could muster into the embrace.
“I’m sure, love.  I want to spend my weekend with you and Blaise.  I’ll cook a roast here for us and you can make me treacle tart.”
Harry walked out of the room, and hoped Teddy would manage to stay out of trouble for two minutes.  He reached Draco halfway down the corridor and immediately pulled him into a tight embrace.
“My Draco….” Harry whispered.
‘Do you want to speak to your father?’  Harry thought at the bond, but there was no answer.  Even now Draco had his shields so firmly in place that Harry’s message wouldn’t go through.  Harry wanted to shake his ridiculous partner.  Didn’t he realise that he was getting Draco out of here?  That opening the bond wasn’t going to open them to the pain of continued separation now.  He tried again.  ‘Please Draco, Love.  Listen to me.  I’m taking you away.  I know that what is going to happen is awful, but he’s doing it for you.  I can’t save him.  I am saving you.’  Again the thoughts rammed against the brick wall that was Draco’s shield against their connection.  Harry knew he had no choice but to speak out loud.
“They’re not okay.”  Harry shook his head.  “Neville is raised by his Grandmother.  They…  they lost their minds in the attack.  When I saw them, they didn’t even know who Neville was.  They’ve been on the long-term ward in St Mungo’s since… well I suppose today.”
“Draco…”
“I hope this does turn you into a kitten” Malfoy pouted. “Are we going to do this or not?”
Malfoy looked torn but eventually shrugged.  “I don’t think we have much choice at this point.  It’s the headmaster or the Dark Lord.  Neither is a good option, but at least I don’t think Dumbledore will hold me under the cruciatus, which I suppose is the better of two evils.  Also, I don’t think you’d agree to go to the Dark Lord.  He’d more than likely kill you and I don’t particularly want to be responsible for that little mess.”
Harry couldn’t really say the two of them played together.  Little Harry certainly seemed to be trying to do that, but little Draco was obviously very shy.  Mostly just sitting there and watching little Harry play with his toy dog and appearing to be listening intently to the baby talk.  After about an hour, little Draco started crying and calling for his mummy.
“I bet that’s putting it mildly.”
“Does he not talk to my sister then?”  She was both surprised and not.  Her sister had doted on her son, but she also knew that Narcissa had not dealt well with Bella’s dissent into madness.  She would have been devastated when her pride and joy had had the unfortunate luck to end up with the same illness.  And with his stint in Azkaban, Andi knew Narcissa would be fearing the worst.  She would be avoiding him to prevent the crushing the tiny spark of hope she would still be clinging to that said he just might be okay.  It wasn’t the most logical of reasonings, but Andi knew her sister.
Hermione took one of the other empty chairs.  They sat silently.  Harry was completely unsure as to what to say.  He had meant it when he said he wasn’t planning on contacting them again in his last letter.  It was only a month ago, but here he was sitting with Hermione at a Ministry event in Hogwarts.
“In you go, James you first”.  He watched his three children whirl away through the flames, then followed.  He stumbled slightly as he got to the other end.  He was glad the Leaky Cauldron was pretty much empty.  He could only see Hannah Abbott reading behind the bar.  She had bought the place with Neville several years earlier after Tom, the old barkeep, had retired.  After the breakup of her marriage 4 years ago, someone else had taken over briefly as manager, but 6 months later Daphne Greengrass moved in and the two of them had been living here and running it ever since.  Hannah looked up and nodded at him and the kids, and then went back to her book.  He hadn’t spoken to Hannah since she and Neville had split.  Neville had never shared the full story about the breakdown of his and Hannah’s relationship.  All Harry knew was that Neville hadn’t been too surprised when Hannah had told him she was leaving him for Daphne.  Maybe Neville would be better to talk to than Hermione about Ginny, he hadn’t spoken to him in a while, but he still considered him a good friend.  Maybe Neville’s experience with Hannah would give him insight into what was going on with his and Ginny’s relationship.
“Yes, sorry Pans.  I’m just missing Scorpius.  The Manor is rather large and lonely with just me rattling around in a hundred plus rooms, half of which have hardly been opened in over 20 years.”
“I am going to be renting it out.  But I’d like it to be to you.  I’m not letting you have it for free.  You’re an adult and I want to treat you like one, although I’m not going to charge a fortune.  I just think you should learn about the value of money and not just rely on me or your mum.” This had actually been Draco’s idea.  Harry would have just let James stay in the place, but Draco gently reminded him of what happened when children weren’t taught the value of things and always just got whatever they wanted.  It had been obvious to Harry that Draco had been describing his younger self and Harry didn’t want that for James.  Harry continued, “Not that we wouldn’t immediately step in to help you if you needed.  You could get a couple of housemates.  I’m sure Teddy would agree to live there.  He’s been stuck in a tiny box room in hospital accommodation and hates it. You might want to find someone else too.  It’s a pretty big place.  But if you can’t immediately, I’m not going to be unreasonable.”
“I’ve got clean clothes at the hospital.”
“It’s not like this place is much better anyway.  You know I haven’t left this room since they let me out of the Ministry cells.  It’s one of the few places in the house that the fuckers my father let roam ‘round like they owned the place, never went.  Books clearly held no interest for them.”
“It’s not that you didn’t mean anything to me.  It’s that they…that he meant more.”  Harry said this with a sigh, as if the confession was something he’d wanted to avoid.
“I’m sure she does.  What’s the best way to contact you?” Harry said.
Harry and Draco looked at each other.  They’d discussed this before, but it had been forgotten amongst everything else that had happened.  Harry sighed.  He knew Draco was concerned, and for good reason, still he spoke up in favour of Remus.
“Fine.  I’m feeling guilty as hell, and even though Draco is doing better again, I blame myself for him having to go through that.”
“Yes, but I’m not sure I’m ready.  I’m certainly not ready to talk about him to them.  I’m not ready to talk about him to you yet.  I’m barely ready to even think about him.  There’s more than just gender holding me back there”
“You just want to bum another cigarette.” Draco snorted back, immediately seeming more at ease with Harry next to him.
“Thank Merlin.  Why do you even let him try and cook? You and the elves are so much better.”
“So, Harry, you’ve finally decided to come and see me then.”
“You are pretty much covered in chocolate.”
“Very well.  Thank you, Mother.”  Draco replied, taking the plate of food off of her.  “I hope our little selves didn’t give you guys too much trouble overnight and that Tawly didn’t mind that we missed the dinner you’d arranged.”
“That sounds like her.  And seems very sensible.  We can rota you into our breakdowns if you need.  As long as at least one of us is holding it together at a time, we’re all good.  Right.”
Harry couldn’t believe it when he received the official documents from his Solicitors.  Ginny had signed the paperwork without a fight.  He was officially free again.  Both he and Draco had known it had been a risk getting in contact, but this made it worth every galleon and painstaking procedure he’d had to go through in order to ensure they wouldn’t be found.  He walked out onto the balcony of their home, to where Draco was sat reading the paper and eating fresh fruit for breakfast; the morning Tuscan sun shining down.  He walked behind him and put his arms around the blonde man before kissing him.  He then moved to sit in the chair next to Draco and served himself up a bowel of fruit with yoghurt.
“I’ve wanted to get you alone since I saw you climb out of the hot tub.” Scorpius murmured, kissing her neck.  “Do you know how incredible you looked?  And how glad I am that Al doesn’t know legilimency.  If he’d had been able to read my thoughts at that moment…”
“I’m doing all the work, just like you said.  You said nothing about not teasing you.”
Ron did as he was told whilst Hermione fumed.  She grabbed a bottle of white from the fridge and poured herself a large glass.  She didn’t care it was only four o’clock.  She needed a drink.  She couldn’t believe what an idiot her husband had been.  At least he hadn’t let slip where she and Harry had met.  That place was obviously special to Harry and she knew he would never forgive her if she’d given the Ministry any clue as to where it was.
Draco slashed across his palm and let the blood flow freely into the potion.
“That’s fine Draco.” Harry said, voice only shaking a little.  “I don’t really want to go there either.  But I think as many of us as possible should go look for the ring.  Dumbledore was definitely cursed by the thing and I don’t want that happening to any of us.”
Harry’s dress robes were uncomfortable.   There was no reason for them to be.  They were expensive and tailored to fit him perfectly, but somehow, they felt two sizes too small and made from cheapest, nastiest material he could imagine.  He knows it’s in his head, but it makes him feel antsy.  That he’s going to spend the whole evening on display is probably adding to his distress.  He’d apparated with Ron, Hermione, and Ginny to Hogsmeade station.  The vultures from press were all waiting there, ready to pounce.  Desperate to get a photo of the Golden Trio, and the perfect couple, as they wait to take the Thestral drawn carriages up to Hogwarts.  Harry doesn’t hear the conversation between the other three, as they travel through the village and up through the gates to the school that was once his home.  The days since he’d last seen Draco were taking their toll.  Then on top of all he was already dealing with, the news of the pub bombing, only a few days earlier, had shaken him.  Him and Malfoy had been in there only a few weeks ago and now, some sick bastard had managed to kill three people, and injured more than 50 others, in a place he’d once felt safe.  Draco was right about there being no where they could be accepted.  They weren’t even safe in the muggle world, it seemed.  The reports of the hate crime had helped him retain his conviction that he and Malfoy couldn’t be together.  Once he was removed from the situation, he had forgiven Draco, mostly, for his heartless words.  When he wasn’t feeling hurt by the other man, it was easier to understand why he had done it and agree with the logic.  Still, the decision he’d made after that last disastrous fight with Draco, was weighing ever more heavily on his mind.  He tried to tell himself that he was doing it to protect Draco, not that he simply couldn’t perceive any other option.  It was like Draco had said, if he couldn’t be happy, at least everyone else could.
“Do you think they’ll be able to help us?” Harry asked, despite his apprehension about the risk they were taking, Harry was excited about getting a modicum of independence back.
“Hi.”  Harry watched the scene with fondness, before eventually announcing his presence.
“That’s….. unexpected.” Robards replied eventually.  “You normally resist being asked to take it easy after an injury.”
“I know, Harry.  But if you don’t they’ll send another one.  Or worse.”
“Then I think I’m going to pay a visit to England.  Hermione will pull at this thread until she finds me, and I’m not going to let her do that by barging her way through Narcissa.”
Harry guess they had all be asking him about how he was and what had happened, but it had all been a cacophony of noise to him.
Harry got a disdainful glare in response.  Not that the arguments and teasing really went away even without Draco talking.
Draco hated when Pansy patronised him and scowled at her but then Harry laughed.
Hermione was shocked when the coin in her pocket buzzed.  She was at home by herself.  After Ginny had received the papers from the bank she’d shut down, not even able to cry.  Ron and Molly were trying to comfort her.  Hermione couldn’t believe that Harry had just shut Ginny out of his life like that.  There hadn’t even been a note.  Just the official documents.  Besides, she still didn’t have Ron’s conviction that Harry had run away completely voluntarily.  Hermione was sure that something must have happened.  She had accepted that he’d run out on Ginny.  That made sense, although why he hadn’t just been honest about the whole situation was still a mystery.  There was no denying he’d been having a long-term affair for almost the entire length of their relationship.  But to leave without a word and not even send a letter to let her and Ron know he was okay didn’t sit right with her.  He had been her best friend since school.  They had spent months alone together on the run after Ron left.  He knew what that had done to her.  The Harry she knew back then would never have abandoned his friends like this.  That was why she had set up the sensor in Grimmauld place.  If anyone entered the property she would know.  It also took magical signature readings, so she could confirm who was there.  Maybe whoever had manipulated Harry into leaving would be stupid enough to set foot in the place and she’d be able to catch them.
The next day in potions class any time that Snape would turn his back to explain something on the blackboard Harry and Draco would be passing notes back and forth to each other. Ron sent a note to Draco and Harry, and it was a doodle of Snape. With this doodle, Harry and Draco couldn’t help but laugh. They did try to contain it, but it was no use. They quickly stopped laughing when Snape turned and glared at the three of them.
Harry wipes tears from his eyes and quickly got up. He turned away from Cedric and started running to find the cup. He was going to get this cup for Cedric. Harry truly felt like Cedric deserved this cup, but with him, out of the race, Harry was going to have to win it for him.
“C-Cedric!? How… how could you- you of all people. How could you do this to me!?” Harry yelled and he clenched his fists.
Ron stepped in between Harry and Draco before speaking, “I think you should go; you have done enough. For the sake of our friendship, I hope you are not lying to us, but for Harry’s happiness I hope you are wrong, at least wrong about what you saw.”
Cedric was in shock from what just happened. No one had ever broken up with him, it was usually him breaking up with them. Then again it was going to happen eventually since Cedric couldn’t bring himself to break off the relationship since Harry looked the happiest, he has ever been. Cedric was waiting on Harry to lose feeling for Cedric, but getting caught with what he was doing came first.
When it was time for the Yule ball Harry only had one person in mind. That was Cedric Diggory. Cedric just had his ways of speaking and acting that enchanted Harry. It was because of Cedric that Harry was questioning his sexuality. On one hand, he knew that he liked girls since he was crushing on Cho, but on the other, he couldn’t get Cedric out of his mind. Harry needed answers so he went looking for Cedric.
“I only did what I could to please you and you really didn’t like them, so I forced myself to hate them even though they have done nothing wrong. I have hurt a lot of people at Hogwarts by calling them mudbloods and by just being rude in general to them when they have done nothing to hurt me. And to be honest, I don’t think they deserve all of this hate. There is a muggle-born witch in my year who is basically good at everything. She is not that different from the rest of us. I don’t want to hurt any more witches and wizards just because they are not purebloods.” Draco took a deep breath and looked at his mother and father, reading their expressions. “I don’t want to become a Death Eater just so you can get back on Voldemort’s good side and I don’t want to become a Death Eater just to disappoint you when my morals get the better of me. I’m sorry I just can’t be… I can’t keep acting like this jerk that is trying to make his father proud when his father is already a really hard man to please. I am hurting myself trying to be someone that I am not. I’m done acting how you want me to act. For now, I am going to be me. A decent gay wizard who is accepting of everyone! I am not doing things for you anymore; I am doing them for me.” Draco was so happy to get that off his chest as he has been thinking about it for a long time now.
Draco smiled happily. He was so happy to hear that from Harry. “I like you a lot to Harry Potter,” Draco said as he pulled Harry back into a long passionate kiss.
“It will be okay; I am sure of it. You are Harry Potter after all.” Draco placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder and gently squeezed it. Draco wasn’t sure how to comfort people, so he was hoping that this was helping Harry in some way.
“Yeah, sorry. Anyways, whenever she talks about ‘him’ not being back it just makes him so mad that I just want to yell at her and tell her that she is lying. It takes a lot to hold back my words,” Harry finished. “But yeah, you are right, we should hurry and head to our rooms and get some sleep. It has been a long day,” Harry smiles softly at Draco before walking past him and down the stairs heading back to his common room. Draco waited a little bit as he was lost in thought before following after Harry, but keeping his distance from him so he could think in peace on his way back to his own common room.
All Harry did was nod. Cedric was right, since Voldemort is back; this year was going to be crazy. Breaks are going to be needed if Harry was going to keep what is left of his sanity.
Ron and Hermione were talking have their own conversation trying to figure out what they should do this time since Voldemort was back. Hermione can already tell that she is going to get annoyed at Harry for focusing so much on Cedric when they have a huge problem to deal with.
A week into Quidditch practice Draco was heading to the changing room early because he wanted to test out a new trick he learned on his broom. However, as soon as he walked into the male changing room, it didn’t take long before he saw Cedric making out with someone in there. They were off in a corner in the shower area. One of the showers was on to mask the noise. Thankfully for Draco, they were dressed, just making out.
Draco initially asked for time to think about it. Once Draco had a clear mind of what he wanted to do he went up to his parents to tell them told them what he was thinking and feeling about the whole thing. Draco didn’t want to be a Death Eater and once his father heard that his son wouldn’t join him on his team in the war, he got angry.
Draco turned and looked into Harry’s eyes. What Draco would give just to kiss Harry right then and there. The truth is Draco has always had feelings for Harry but had to push his feeling away then he was trying to make his father happy. Draco didn’t even know if Harry was straight or not. He has always seen Harry try and get with a girl but then there was the whole Cedric thing. You would have to be blind not to see the tension that was between the two of them. Draco was sure that Harry was at least a little gay, but didn’t know if he was okay with it.
Draco felt a hand on his shoulder and when Draco didn’t look up immediately the hand on his shoulder lightly started shaking him. Draco sat up and rubbed his temple with both hands. “I wasn’t asleep, Mr. Slughorn I— “Draco stopped mid-sentence as it was not Mr. Slughorn. The person that had his hand on Draco’s Shoulder was Harry freaking Potter. Draco was shocked but quickly gained his composer. “Oh, Potter, hey… Um, do you need something?” By Draco’s voice, you could tell he was put off guard.
“I am not sure. I hope so, for their safety. We are organizing a meeting to get people on board,” Harry says as he looks down to his hands on the railing, looking at the fading scar on his hand.
Harry grabbed Draco by the collar of his shirt and pulled him into a kiss. Draco was caught off guard but quickly melted into the kiss. Draco and Harry were blushing like crazy and no longer cared who saw them. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist pulling him closer, deepening the kiss. Harry slowly pulled away and looked at Draco. Draco thought this was a dream and wished to never wake up from it. Draco slowly opened his eyes and looked into Harry’s eyes.
“Thank you for asking me to go with you. I was quite shocked by you asked me, but none the less am glad I said yes,” Cedric gently grabbed Harry’s hands, pulling him close. Cedric winked at Harry before chuckling softly. He stared deeply into Harry’s eyes. “You really do have such beautiful eyes.”
“Well, yeah. Is it that obvious?” As soon as Harry finished that sentence Draco nods his head.
“Why do I have to do it!” Ron whined softly.
?” Ron was the first to speak up. Ron already had his wand out and was gripping onto it rather tightly. Hermione gently put her hand on Ron’s shoulder to try and calm him down. Harry was calm but very quiet. Harry being so quiet actually made Draco rather nervous.
Recently people in the Slytherin house have been making fun of Draco and making hateful comments about Draco being gay. Draco wasn’t sure how they found out about it, but he can only assume they snooped through his things. Ever since people in his house started being homophobic, Draco has always been suspicious of others whispering to each other. He was worried they were all about him trying to turn Harry gay or something like that. Harry snapped his fingers in front of Draco’s face. “Sorry, I was… zoning out. What were you saying again?” Draco looked over at Harry.
“I don’t really know… I guess it could be explained by nonverbal magic… I really don’t know. I just remember being extremely shocked and sad that you were dead and just constantly repeating it in my head that you would make it out of it alive—that you would wake up and you eventually did.” Saying that all out loud for the first time made Draco feel like he was crazy. Draco shook his head. “But I couldn’t have been the reason you woke up. I was the bad guy after all…” Draco frowned and looked away once again. Draco truly regrated being a Death Eater. A tear rolled down Draco’s cheek and he quickly wiped it away. “I’m sorry… I should go” Draco quickly got up and when to walk away but tripped on the blanket they were sitting on and fell onto Harry. Draco quickly got up, sniffled, and ran out of the tower.
“Yeah, well, it still doesn’t mean you should be giving a flying fuck about it.”
cigarette when she stepped through the fireplace.  As soon as the cigarette was lit, he went straight to the decanter and poured them both two very large glasses of wine.
I know I said I wasn't going to be able to post again for a while, but this chapter was almost finished anyway and I couldn't help myself.  Now I really will, in all likliness, be disappearing for two weeks.  I have a ridiculous amount of reading to do, a presentation to write, and two essays to plan, all on top of two weeks of lectures.
“No.  I’m selfish.   I’m a bully.  I know what I want and will step over people to get it.  I put myself family first and foremost.  I will hurt people who hurt what’s mine.  I got my own father sentenced to life in Azkaban and celebrated.  Harry’s the only good person in this room.  Little Draco will be good person though.  That’s enough for me.  Now do you fancy trying to get out of bed, Tom.  I want to go and get some fresh air, and you’ve been cooped up in this room for far too long with nothing to do but dream about and dwell on your past mistakes as each memory of your past hit you.”
“Sirius!”  Harry exclaimed, hardly hearing what Sirius said, at the same time as Draco shouted “Mother” and threw himself at the woman.
It had never been this awkward between the two of them before, and Harry felt guilty, knowing the distance was his fault.
Harry was sat in Ron and Hermione’s living room.  Ginny was helping Hermione with the cooking in the kitchen, so it was just him and Ron.  He hadn’t managed to fall asleep till some time after 4am and then woken less than two hours later with the dawn.  He knew Ron was talking but he couldn’t concentrate for long enough to work out what he was saying.  He felt like he was underwater, with sounds struggling to travel to his ears.  Then his phone buzzed, pulling out of the fog in his head for a second.  He looked down at it and saw the text message from the unknown number.  He knew who it was from.  He stood up and walked towards the door.  Forgetting where he was and who was with. He just knew he had to go to him.
“Want one too?”
“Yes.  Do you mind if I cast some privacy charms?  Or you can.  But, well, it’s a very delicate situation.  I need you to swear that what I say here doesn’t leave this room.  Please be aware that this is not for my sake but for the person I’m here representing.”
‘Yes.  I know we’ve never bothered before, but we decided every additional layer of protection was worth it.  Also given it was just meant to be you here, me knowing the secret was enough.  You know how well that particular charm works between the two of us.’
“No, Malfoy.  Stay and have a drink.  We can go through to the sitting room.  Talk.  Umm… if our kids are friends… maybe we should… you know be able to be in the same room… hold a conversation without…I think you should stay.”  Harry was stumbling over his words slightly, a consequence of alcohol mixing with nerves.  He had barely even registered moving towards Malfoy but somehow, he was, his hand reaching out to the other man. He saw Malfoy look down at his outstretched hand and close his eyes for a second, as if considering his options.  When Malfoy opened them again the silver eyes met his own, freezing Harry on the spot, unsure of the next move.  When the next move came Malfoy was the one to make it.
“Hermione would love this.”  Harry said a little sadly.  He didn’t often think about the friends he’d left behind.  He missed them, just not enough to want to do anything about returning to a time when they were the same age and were friends.  It just wasn’t worth everything else that would come with it.
of July 1997.  Sixteen years without being able to use magic wasn’t exactly going to be convenient.  He looked up at Draco, who still looked a bit sheepish.  As if he knew what Harry was thinking.  Harry smiled reassuringly.  However fair or not fair it may be, it wasn’t like it was Draco’s fault he was at an advantage.  And it was an advantage that Harry should be grateful for right now.
“Come on you two.  Just shove in Fantasia.  If you’re both not asleep by the Chernaborg I’ll fast forward over it.”
“Love you too.”  Draco starts moving his kisses down to Harry’s neck.  He eases Harry out of his t-shirt.  He kisses each of Harry’s scars, some old, some from his most recent accident.  “You are absolutely gorgeous.  You know that?”
“Don’t bloody announce it to the whole world Hermione.  The last thing I bloody well need is the Prophet catching wind.  Just let me go.”
“That’s okay.  I’m surprised my little one here has taken to you so well.  He normally kicks and screams when almost any adult apart from me comes near him.”
He thinks about running but his feet don’t seem to want to obey.  He suspects that if he goes over the two men will destroy the photo he’s just taken, but it still isn’t enough to get him to move.
“I was kind of a shit to his family.  He probably deserved to get the one good hit in.  The worst of it wasn’t Ron though.  He behaved as I expected and let his temper do the talking.  It was Hermione, with her probing questions and inability to let things go.  She caught up with me after I walked out.  I may have gone off on her a bit, let out all the things I’ve been holding onto for the last fifteen years.  Then she had the audacity to ask me to tell her where we live.  I’d just told her that I’d spent half my life resenting the way they treated me, and had had to listen to her and her husband insult the man I married, and she thought that I’d tell her where our home is. She wanted me to talk the rest of the Weasleys too.  When I told her that I didn’t want to she looked like I’d broken her.  Like out of everything, that was what hurt the worst.  The part of me that still cares, hated that I’d done that to her.  They were my friends and they’re not going to forgive me.  I know I said that I didn’t want our lives to change, that I didn’t want them to be a part of it anymore, but I was scared to admit that a part of me still hoped that they might forgive me.  That maybe they’d give me a second chance.  But I could tell from moment I mentioned you, that even if I spent the rest of my life apologising to them, I’d still be the bastard that walked out on their family for a Death Eater.”
“They both need to talk to someone about this.”
“No.  She won’t reply straight away.  And she doesn’t answer half the time anyway, and the times she does are pretty much the times I figure it out myself in the interim.  Talk to me now before I end up back at the piano to quiet the itching.”
It took two more nights to get the illusions in place on top of the ward.  The days continued on as before.  Harry hung out with his Gryffindor friends, although spending more time in the library doing his homework than he’d ever done before, to Hermione’s delight and Ron’s annoyance.  He continued with DA meetings.  Nights were for Draco and Blaise.  They hadn’t managed to find much more on the Rivals’ Bond, although they were completely convinced by the snippets of additional information they had gathered, that that was what was going on between Draco and Harry.  Harry had a feeling the room knew more than it was letting on, but that it would only give them the information as they needed it, not before.  His understanding of the room and its, what he could only call, friendship with him, begun to extend to when he was in it with the DA as well.  It let him know when certain members needed extra help and sent warm feelings of satisfaction when he listened to it, though not as warm and happy as when he was in the room with Draco and Blaise.  It loved when the three of them were together.  When he was instructing the DA on patronuses, he felt its help in keeping the members from becoming too demanding when they wanted to see his patronus.  The bond had let him know in no uncertain manner, that he wasn’t to show anyone but Blaise or Draco the tiger.  The bond protected itself and the room protected them too.
“I feel terrible Hermione, but thanks for the reminder.” Harry knew he was being rude but didn’t care.   “What are you doing here at this time?”
“Blood of the unwilling enemy.  Willingly given.”
“I’ll see you there.”
“I know” Draco replied, pushing the pasta round the dish, trying to make it look like he’d eaten some.  “I’ll talk.  But it’s not been a great few days.   I nearly lost it completely the night before last.  Ended up at Pansy’s at two in the morning so she could talk me down.  Scorpius has gotten Potter’s daughter pregnant.  I don’t really know what to do about it.  I don’t think there really is anything I can do about it other than be there for him.  But that whole crappy situation meant Potter turning up at my house twice; once to scream at me, and once telling me he loved me and that everything is going to be all okay.  Pansy screamed at him too at some point in between his two appearances.  She was a bit pissed off at the state I was in when he left the first time.”
“They are actually.”
“Urr… I think it may have to be a picnic on the living room floor.  Have you looked out the window?”
“You don’t…”
“You trying to get me drunk, Harry?!” Ron exclaimed slapping Harry’s back and grinning as he accepted the bottle.
Eventually they’d fallen asleep, sticky and sated, in each other’s arms.  When the dawn light came through the window, they’d both woken.  Draco couldn’t believe how different he felt today compared to yesterday.  That he hadn’t even realised until Harry was stood in front of him that he’d been nothing more than a shell, going through the motions, for six months.
“I got the locket.  I’ve already dropped it off at the Manor.”
“Well that all sounds good.”
Draco can feel it.  Can feel that Harry is going to try and persuade him again, that they should be together.  That them running away together was a viable solution.  Draco wanted to believe it.  Wanted more than anything just to say yes.  To be selfish and give into his own desires.  He had to stay strong.  Harry had proven, time and time again, that he wasn’t capable.  Whatever he said about Draco being all that mattered, he knew it wasn’t real.  It couldn’t be.  He couldn’t let himself think that it was more than a physical reaction to their attraction.  Harry had repeatedly told him that he hated the pressure and expectations everyone put on him.  Draco couldn’t allow his own desires to put the same pressure on Harry.  He didn’t realise that by refusing to acknowledge or consider Harry’s words as a true reflection of his own mind, that he was doing just that.  He didn’t trust that Harry could actually be happy in a life with just him.  Despite the improvements in his self-esteem, he still couldn’t believe he was worth giving up the world for.  It was now only six weeks before the wedding, and the clock was more demanding than ever.  Harry was going to ask again, and he was going to have to hurt him once more.  If he didn’t, they would end up trapped in this limbo forever.  Causing more hurt to each other, and everyone else around them in the long run.
“Not at all.”
“Actually,” Draco interrupted. “If it’s okay with Harry, I’d like to deliver this in person.”
“Play something else for me.  The Beethoven one I like.”
“What’s that?  And why’s the git going to be teaching it to you?”  Ron huffed.
They’d had three weeks of being pestered by the print media after Harry’s bizarre public appearance.  The family had decided as a whole not to say anything, knowing that they would only increase the pressure on them if they did.  Eventually the journalists had given up.
“I have no idea, but I like seeing you like this.” Lily said smiling.
“We know it is and we don’t want to pressure you.  But the more time that passes the fewer options that will be open to you.  Neither me nor Harry want to push you into anything, but we also don’t want you to end up down a road with no way out either.”
year.  He taught them to us in the DA.”
“I do.  But you don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to.” Hermione replied earnestly, not really liking the tone Harry had taken when he’d spoken and wanting to go back to easier topics.  Instead she pressed on, knowing that there was a good chance she wasn’t going to get another opportunity.  “I am curious though about why you’re bothering letting the public in on your lives again.  You hate press exposure and you had to have known people wouldn’t exactly react well to the news that you and Draco were together.”
“Before you ask, Draco is perfectly safe with Tom.  One, Tom isn’t exactly in much of a state to do anything that would hurt him, and two Tom is not Lord Voldemort.  Or he is, but he’s Lord Voldemort before he turned into murdering psychopath.”
“Do you think you feel up to coming to the table, or do you want dinner in here?”  Blaise asked.
“Hey Al.  Hey Scorp. How are you guy’s doing?  Is OWL year really as hard as they say?”
“What happened?” Ron replied. “Because there is no way the Harry I know, would have broken two Death Eaters out of Azkaban.  Especially not Malfoy.”
“Only if you do all the work.” Draco whispered against Harry’s lips when the kiss finally stopped.
“Not to worry Teddy.  I’m just glad you don’t think your too old to give me hug when you need one.” Andromeda wrapped Teddy tighter in her arms. “Draco, Harry, how are you dealing with everything?”
Hermione tried to block the sound of Ron shouting out.  She went and picked up her daughter and took her inside away from her father’s ranting.  The four-year-old didn’t need to be exposed to this.
Pansy lit up and took a deep drag. Then seeing the way Potter’s hands twitched nervously under the table offered him one, which he gladly took.  She’d remembered him smoking back in eighth year and the disapproving looks his friends had given him whenever he’d snuck out for a fag.  She also remembered that Potter and Draco would often end up going outside together for a smoke.  How could she have been so stupid not to have seen it back then?  Reminiscing on her time back in Hogwarts she puffed at the cigarette, not talking.  Potter sat just as quietly and looked nervous as he took quick drags.  Neither of them spoke for several long minutes.  Once the waiter had bought their tea to the table and left, she stubbed out the finished cigarette in the ashtray and decided it was time to give Potter the piece of her mind that he’d been deserving of for years.
“Why do you sound so sensible right now?”
“Is this one of the reasons I shouldn’t leave you alone?”  The blond and the dark-haired boy had conspiratorial looks on their faces.  They were definitely up to something.
“I can’t believe today actually happened.”  Harry said, softly.
“Some of the stuff Harry and Dray told me over the years disagreed with the general consensus.”
“Is Aunty Daphne here?” Scorpius asked.
____________
“I’m fine.  Although if we’re actually going to go out, we should probably do so as soon as Blaise gets here.”
“Harry you’re getting off topic again.  Pansy back me up on this.”
She turned to face him again, angry at Ron’s apparent lack of comprehension, despite the fact that Harry had had to point it out to her.  She had to make him understand.  She tried to keep herself calm, but his talking so casually about this was making her irate.  Her next words came out in a furious half-whispered hiss, she didn’t want to shout and disturb the kids.
So this chapter and the next were originally combined but it got a bit long.  I still need to re-read through the next chapter before I post it but it should be up soon.
“The elf.  I…  how do you know he isn’t going to betray you?  What if his Master demands him to…?” Draco closed his eyes and focused on the feeling of the two other boys who were pressed against him, knowing if he didn’t, he’d end up triggering off another panic attack.  He’d had them before.  The first when he was only six.  His father had not been pleased that his son had done something undignified.  He’d managed to hide them from his father after that day.  Thinking about that though, was only likely to make him feel even worse.  He concentrated on what Harry was saying instead, pushing aside the memories that were trying to bubble up and escape.
Scorpius began kissing her again.  Slowly and tenderly at first, then with more passion.  His body was pressed into hers, one hand was on her breast, the other still on her hip.  He was moving, creating friction between the two of them.  She could feel how hard he was in his trousers.
“Ron… are you still awake?”
Neville walked in then with a tray of tea and a couple of hot cross buns.  He was only wearing a pair of boxers.  Pansy and Neville had gotten on very well at the barbeque it seemed.
“Yes Love.  You go help your aunty with the tea.”
“it… It was bad enough walking away from the music.   I can’t leave this too.”  Draco confirmed Harry’s thoughts.
“Wasn’t it corporeal before?”  Draco inquired.
“Hey, Teddy Bear.  What’s the matter?”
“Don’t care.  I’m not going back.  Not until I get to him.  If I turn back the pain will return.  I can’t… I just can’t deal with the pain again.  I’d rather die than feel like that again. Please Blaise.  Just help me.”  Something in either his words or the tone of his voice persuaded Blaise to continue helping him.
Ginny was waiting outside the door.
“I kind of forgot to get in contact with them.  They went to Grimmauld and freaked out that none of my stuff was there.  Hermione sent a Howler.”
“I’m Hermione Granger-Weasley.  I was wondering whether I could come in.”
“Harry!  It’s been too long.  You look far too thin.  And you’ve brought little Teddy with you.”  Molly enveloped him in a hug he couldn’t have avoided if he tried.  At least he was now healed enough that this no longer hurt.  Teddy was on his hip, and it was a little awkward trying to hug Molly back and not drop the toddler.  “Bill will be here soon, and Teddy can play with Victoire.”
“He rebounded from the depressive episode straight into a particularly awful manic one.  It’s fine now though.  Had to change his meds around, but they seem to be working again.”
“Draco, I wish I could make it better.  I could promise to never leave but that wouldn’t work.  It wouldn’t be healthy to never leave each other’s sides.  We can’t just use each other as coping strategies again.  We did that once and it ended in disaster.  I can promise to always come back though. I just don’t know how to make you believe me.  I’ve fucked that up so many times already.”
He was outside the hospital.  He was talking to a strange man and getting on a bus.  He had hot chocolate in front of him.  Then the chocolate was all over his lap.  The tugging sensation got stronger and stronger, but the pain started easing.  The pain easing was good.  He was off the bus and walking up a familiar lane towards the large gates beneath a castle.  The pain was almost gone.  He just had to go a little further.  Just a little further and he’d feel better.  Just a….
“Morning, Harry.”
“I don’t doubt it, Harry. Draco, you want to try and start sorting it today?  You’ll need to come back to the Manor to contact them.”  Draco’s Mother answered, still talking as if this were the easiest task in the world.  Maybe it was going to be easier than Draco thought.  Whatever methods his Father had used had kept the Manor and all of the Malfoy vaults out the Ministry’s hands at the end of the war.
“How noble Potter.  But I think we’re done for the day.  I’m tired.  One of the elves will show you out.”
“Mmmm.”  Draco replied, although Harry wasn’t sure whether he was really listening.  He tried anyway.
It's the night before his wedding and Harry Potter is miserable
“He used to make me the best hot chocolates.”  Draco said with fond nostalgia.  “And he always asked after mother once he started working at Hogwarts.  He was my favourite elf.  I was pretty upset when you tricked father into freeing him.  He was probably my best friend in this place….”  Draco paused and when Harry looked over at him, he looked decidedly guilty, although for what reason, Harry couldn’t guess.
“Yes. She wants to see Draco.  I guess we should have expected this.  What with the funeral this week.”
“Just coats?”
Justin didn’t know what to say.  He was intrigued by this confident young man, and it was completely separate from the intrigue that came from the connection to Harry Potter and his husband.  From the moment he had first seen Teddy Lupin in the park, Justin had wanted to get to know him.  He wasn’t sure exactly why, but there was something about the wizard who laughed with and teased the Saviour of the wizarding world and Death Eater like it was nothing.  It was bewitching.  Which was why he found himself saying yes and following the man to the bar.
Remus was just about to ask about why Riddle Manor was important when Draco stepped in and spoke first.
“Yes, Potter”
“I said.  I’m here about a property that has been transferred to your grandson, Edward Lupin.” Draco carefully looked down at the papers in he was holding as he said Teddy’s name, trying to give the impression he was reading it.
“Focus Harry.  Mother has a guest.”
“Draco darling, to what do I owe the pleasure?  I was sort of in the middle of something, but I know you wouldn’t disturb me if it wasn’t important.”
“Don’t worry about that now.  We have to find him.”
“So what if I am.”
“Harry Potter…  Is that really you?”  Flitwick eventually managed to say.  Of course it would be him who was addressed first.
“It doesn’t matter.  Harry and Draco will deal with whatever happens.  They’re perfectly safe at home.  No one is coming to break down their doors with pitchforks, and even if they were, they will not blame you. This isn’t your fault.  I think you should go to the Manor and head straight to Tuscany.  I think they’re the ones you need reassuring you now, not me.  You’re due there tomorrow anyway, and Harry’s birthday is in a few days.  You were looking forward to that, and you still should be.  I’ll join you before then.  I’m going to stay here but I’ll be there soon.  And if either of them says one harsh word to you, which they won’t, they’ll have me to deal with.  Cissa too.  Now do you have any idea who this woman was?”
“Come to see if you’d caved and gone to see Draco.  We sent Scorpius and Callie to make sure he stayed put too.”  James teased.
“As Harry said, I’m complicated too.  I have my own baby doppelganger as well.”  Draco drawled.  He’d manage to compose himself too, and now looked every inch the perfect pureblood heir he was raised to be.
“I think that’s a no.  If you wanted to be with her you should be more sure.  You sound more like you don’t want to let anyone down.  And besides there is the real reason you didn’t come home last night.  Meet someone interesting?”
“That term and the next were awful.  The stares I used to get when I started showing made me feel so ashamed.  Madame Pomfrey and Professor Haywood, my head of house, helped.  I studied harder than I’d ever done before, determined to pass my OWLs.  I had decided that I was going to give the baby up.  I’d even picked out a couple that I thought I could give her to.  Then before I was able to make the arrangements, two days after my exams finished, I went into labour.  Madame Pomfrey whisked me away to St Mungo’s and I had Hattie.  I knew even without the arrangements in place I could still give her that couple, but then I took one look at her and knew I couldn’t give her away.  It’s been hard but I’ve managed.  I’ve had to give up a lot but she’s worth it.  The only thing that makes me sad is that my parents still don’t want to meet her.  I don’t know whether I’ve helped or made this harder for you.”
Harry moved to put his arms around his partner.
“Is that why Kreacher never liked or properly obeyed Sirius then?  He was blasted off the family tree even though he was the head of the house.  The only male Black of the name living.”
“Okay, now you’ve started catching up.  How do you feel about Draco?”
“Don’t think I can manage tea, the milk is 15 years out of date, and I think the something may have gotten at the tea, but I can definitely do water.” The youth smiled and laughed as he said this.
“I know.  But if she wasn’t going to talk to me like an adult, I wasn’t going to behave like one.  This is me we are talking about.  I once told Snape he didn’t have to call me “Sir”.”
Harry didn’t know what to say to that.  He knew there was almost nothing he could say, other than that he was going to quit his job, that would reassure Draco.  His chest was wet with other man’s tears.  They stayed there silently until Blaise came back.
“He gave me a phone number too.”  True, the number clearly couldn’t be the one he used everyday if there was a five day limit on it’s usefulness, but it was a way to contact him, which was a hell of a lot more trust than Harry had shown in decades.
“I shouldn’t have been.  It’s not where the hat wanted me.  Growing up with the Dursley’s I had to do whatever I could to survive.  The thing is, when I got to the wizarding world, all anyone could tell me was that Slytherin was evil and bred evil wizards.  And that I was going to be just like my parents.  I was going to be a Gryffindor and brave and all that crap.  You didn’t help either.  You were so sure you were going to be in Slytherin.  And you insulted the first people who’d ever been nice to me and reminded me of my bullying cousin.  So I begged it not to put me there.  I would probably have been better off in Slytherin though.”
“It’s great you’ve got Tara coming.  But… I’m not going into work today.”
“Actually he’s a seriously bad cook.”  Harry said, smiling at the memory of the last time Draco insisted on making dinner a week ago and had ended up burning the pasta he was cooking.  They’d resorted to takeaway in the end.  “Like honestly, I don’t quite know how he can bake some of the things he does but fail to make even the simplest of savoury dishes.”
“No.  You never told me.” Al replied.
“Yes.  How did you know it was me?  We’ve never met.” Draco hadn’t been expecting this on the doorstep.  He’d hoped to get inside before he told her who he was.  No escaping it now though, he just needed to continue on.  It wasn’t the end of the world.
“I’ve no idea.  I’ve no fucking idea, Draco.”
“I… I mean I can stop… but…”
“It’s fine Draco.  You can’t change it.  None of it is your fault.”
“So Daddy decided to give up for tonight then?”  He asked the girl, who just chewed the blanked in response.
“I think I’ll go rescue Pansy and Blaise from Teddy.  I promised him a dance.”  Draco said as he got up.  He kissed Harry lightly before making his way back to the dance floor.
“It’s… complicated… But this is Harry…”  Sirius said, gesturing towards Harry.  Remus looked startled to see Harry and Draco stood there.  He hadn’t noticed them appear with Sirius.  His expression changed from startled to one that looked slightly fearful when he took in the sight of Harry properly.
“Andromeda, you should stay.” Blaise insists.  They’d invited her to stay for a reason, and Narcissa Malfoy turning up shouldn’t have to change that.
“Nom Cake.”
“How?”
“I’m bored mostly, with the kids gone, the intensive physio finished, and my no longer working, there isn’t much to do.”
“You need to finish it.”
It was after 5 o’clock when Harry made it back through the floo in the Leaky Cauldron and landed on his hearth rug.  Ron and Hermione should be back in in around half an hour and he thought about inviting them over for dinner to make up for his behaviour of the last couple of weeks.  Harry waited till around quarter to, to fire-call his best friends.  Ron and Hermione were sat in their living room as his head entered the flames in their fireplace.  They looked down at the fire as it lit and flashed green.
“You will do no such thing.” Draco admonished.
“You could not have prevented this.  You have no reason to feel guilty.  You and Blaise help make things better not worse.”
