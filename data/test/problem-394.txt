Chuckling, Draco undid his bonds.  The cords had dug in, as Harry had been too far gone to realize he was yanking on them.  Tutting, he used his wand to do a simple healing spell.  “You might need something stronger.  This may bruise.”
Draco just stayed turned away, but his shoulders seemed to slump a little.  “Fine.  It’s all over and done with, OK?  Let’s leave it all in the past and try to forget it.  No more trying to help me, Potter.  Just leave me alone.”
He could do it now.  Pull the shower curtain back and see Draco.  His hand shook a bit, as he reached out.
The idea of Draco sitting on a log with Lucius, both holding fishing poles, made Harry chuckle.  He turned his face away when Draco gave him a sharp look, not wanting to explain it, and spotted a nice flat rock.  Without thinking too much, he stepped forward and grabbed it out of the muddy border of the pond.
Draco scoffed.  “Did you pass your OWL for the History of Magic?  Wizards and witches have been doing vile things to each other forever.”
Gathering his Gryffindor courage, Harry leaned in to give him a light kiss.  And when Draco didn’t pull away, pushed his hand into his hair and kissed him properly.  The way he’d been wanting to for months.
Grabbing the wand, he pulled it out fast and pointed it at Draco, his stomach sinking like a stone, his hand trembling a bit.  “I’m so, so sorry.”
Sitting back on his heels, Harry looked up at Draco.  He was leaning forward against the bars of the cell, clothing rumpled, face flushed, and still breathing fast.  Knowing he had been the one to get Draco looking like that sent a burst of pride through Harry.  And also made him uncomfortably aware of how aroused he still was.
Harry caught her wand, and they rounded together against Lucius and Narcissa.  Dobby was right there, arguing against his former masters in a way that made Harry proud.  In the skirmish, Harry saw Draco off to the side, and was able to pin him down, wrestling their wands from his grasp.
Jeans and socks came off next, leaving them in just their underwear.  Harry couldn’t stop running his hands over Draco, loving his pale, smooth skin.  He had light body hair on his legs and other places.  Draco seemed to like Harry’s body, a bit shorter, but a sturdy, more muscular build.
He was lying on his back, pyjamas twisted around his body evidence that he had been restless in the night.  He had gotten used to sleeping in just his underwear, living alone for the past few months.
Harry hugged him tight, loving the feel of his arms around Draco’s slim body.  “We have been caught up in things beyond our control for half our lives.  I am not giving up another day to all that.  I’m just want to be an eighteen year old wizard, working a normal job, and dating a guy I like.”
Yawning and stretching, Harry got up.  The clothes Draco had set out were very nice.  So, they were going somewhere fancy.  Draco had certainly planned everything this weekend.  Harry was half excited, half dreading, whatever would happen next.
-Bike Rental:  They go to ‘On Your Bike’ for bike rentals, “nestled in unique arches under London Bridge”.
“Yes!  And I liked the river dinner thing.  It looked kind of touristy at first, but I liked the meal and dancing with you,” Harry said.
“Come on,” Harry cajoled.  “We are both stuck here and there’s not much to do.  Tell me, what did you do for fun?  With your friends?”
“Where are we?  Why did you bring me here?” Harry blurted out, the main questions on his mind all night.
Harry played out scenarios in his head, and nothing seemed feasible. Draco had the upper hand, and would get to his wand before Harry could. Plus, he had the house elves, however many, at his command as well.
He was so busy in his activity, it was a bit of a surprise when there was a bit splash in the pond right before he was about to throw another stone.  Glancing over at Draco, with muddy fingers and his cheeks slightly flushed with embarrassment, it wasn’t too hard to deduce who had thrown it.
They made idle chit chat throughout the meal, but underneath it all was that sense of anticipation.  Every time they got together it grew stronger and stronger.  Harry could feel Draco’s eyes on him as much as his were on Draco.
Harry picked up a quill with a sigh, and scratched out a reply, claiming he was quite tired due to extra shifts lately.  Maybe in a few days.  He reattached the scroll to the eagle owl’s leg, and sent it back to Draco.
The request was a bit shocking, but Harry obeyed.  It was so intimate, doing this in front of someone else.  Knowing Draco was watching as his hand wrapped around his own cock.  He couldn’t hold back, his hand moving over it.
Draco shifted off him, lying on the bed beside him, and Harry turned his face that direction.  He felt wonderfully relaxed.  “Thanks for the massage,” he said, and leaned in to give him a light kiss.
-A/N:  Thanks for giving this sequel to ‘Captivate’ a try.  It’s a WIP, with drafts done of most of the chapters.  I will post at least once a week.
His head was pounding hard enough he got over his instinctive mistrust of Draco and took the bottle.  “Do I drink the whole thing at once?” he asked, already bracing himself for a foul tasting brew.
The use of his name had Draco swinging around, his eyes furious.  Glaring at Harry so hard he stopped moving, stopped trying to apologize.  With a huff, Draco went into the castle, leaving Harry outside, dripping and starting to shiver.
Harry stopped breathing for a second, as Draco hugged him from behind, pressing in close.  This was really similar to the position they’d been in when Draco had tackled Harry, in that game of Tag.  His breath came out in a rush when Draco pushed his hips tight against his ass.  Harry could feel how hard Draco was, rubbing and grinding against him.
“Fuck, that sounds boring,” Draco’s voice broke through his rambling answer, and Harry’s eyes snapped to his in surprise.  There was a bit of a teasing glint in them that made Harry relax again.
They were pressed together, body against body, just the bars between them.  Harry shifted and pressed against Draco, just wanting more, wanting to be closer.
Harry smiled back, liking seeing this side of Draco.  He was a very intelligent man, and it was good seeing him maturing away from his spoiled, whiny teenage ways.  He was realizing what it took to be a successful wizard based on his own skills and hard work, not relying on his family connections.  It gave him a confidence that he hadn’t had before.  A very attractive trait.
It was a surprise when Draco’s arms came around him, pulling him close.  Harry hugged him back, tucking his face against his shoulder.  The tight, sad knot of feelings inside him slowly unravelled, replaced by the wonder of the moment.  Holding Draco Malfoy, on a bed, after they had had sex.  Well, kind of.
“Hot,” Draco said, stepping closer and giving Harry a light kiss.  A test.  When Harry didn’t move away, a tight hug came next, and a kiss by Harry’s ear.  “Just seeing you like that. I think about it when we aren’t together.”
The basket seemed to contain far too much food. Draco pulled out all sorts of tasty items, and handed Harry a plate. He seemed amused when Harry piled it high.
Harry sighed, looking upward.  “Look, I got dumped to live with my aunt and uncle and they weren’t to happy to have me there, OK?  Whenever I could, I spent time away from the house.”
With a sigh, Harry moved over to the sofa and sat down.  “I guess we can have some later.  Something on your mind, Malfoy?”
A half hour later, the helpful staff had them in helmets and sitting on bikes they had adjusted to the right seat height.  Harry felt a thrill, sitting on his, memories of doing it as a child coming back.  He’d never owned his own bike, but he’d occasionally been able to borrow one for a few quick minutes from a schoolmate or two, enough to get the rudimentary skills.
Sighing, Draco pulled Harry’s hands away. “I know.  And I know you are basically a good guy, never hurting people if you can prevent it.  I was mad at you for a while, hurt, but I know you had to do it.”
Ron was watching him from the other side of the table, sipping a beer.  His plate was empty.  “Is that Malfoy’s owl?”
-I have finished the drafts of the rest of the chapters.  There are eight chapters total, around 16K words.
Shaking his head, Harry looked at Draco, loving how messy his hair was from their earlier activities.  “No.  But we are young, relatively good looking men.  We could be having sex with tons of people, and it would be good.”
Draco rolled his eyes, and paced around the room.  “No!  Things are going great!  We are dating publicly, and no one seems to really care.  We are getting along great, having fun.  And suddenly it’s lame excuse after excuse from you.”
Harry prepped him too, covering him with lube and stroking him slowly, guiding him into place.  Holding each other’s gaze as Draco pushed inside, both groaning.  He took it slowly, only pushing deeper when Harry pulled at his hips.  Fully inside, Harry wrapped his legs around Draco, hugging him tight, taking deep breaths.
Harry could only sigh and moan in pleasure, the stiffness in his back fading under his touch.  How much of that tension was from his work, from sleeping on a different bed, and how much from this situation with Draco?  Feeling so unsure how things stood between them.
Harry just nodded eagerly, clasping Draco’s hand tightly and apparating them right to his bedroom.  He didn’t do it often in his house, but it was useful in times like this.
The bonds were looser this time, invisible strands that looped around Harry’s wrists and ankles, and attached to the four posts of the bed.  He was spread eagled on top of the covers, fully clothed, with Draco usually lying on top of him.
They had talked and laughed, going out for dinners and to see professional Quidditch matches, often holding hands.  Harry could feel they were getting closer.  It was exciting and terrifying.  He’d never had time to properly date anyone before.  Was he doing this right?
Harry had to swing past him twice before Draco swung up behind him on the broomstick, clutching Harry’s waist firmly.  Pure relief shot through Harry at the close contact and he headed right to the exit.  They all had to make it.
Draco passed him a soapy sponge, and faced the other way.  For all his bravado, Harry knew this was a first for him too.  Running the sponge over his back was a safe place to start.
Harry tied the message to the bird’s leg, feeling a thrill of excitement as it went back through the window.  He only had a few hours to make sure everything was ready.
Within a few minutes, they were both breathing heavy, clothing a mess from wandering hands, and grinding against each other shamelessly.
Why had he ever agreed to this trip?  Had he simply been desperate after a few days of no contact from Draco he hadn’t asked enough questions?  Draco had just seemed apologetic, wanting to work to make things better.  A quiet weekend away seemed like a good idea.  Plenty of time together to talk things out.  And then have plenty of make up sex.
Draco returned his smile easily, obviously pleased at his accomplishment.  But within a second, he pulled back the emotions, his face neutral again.  “Yes, well, thank you for the high level amusement, Potter.  I think it is time to head back inside.”
In the end, Draco wasn’t very good at making paper airplanes because he didn’t understand them.  Harry could tell he was frustrated, which was the last thing he wanted.  “Um, how about we make paper boats instead?  We can even try floating them on the pond afterwards.”
Opening his eyes, Harry tried to speak, but his jaw was frozen shut.   He was entirely at Draco’s mercy.
Draco let out a hard sigh.  “Yes.  I know it was stupid.  One-sided.  I had been lying to myself about my feelings for you for ages.  But I couldn’t in that moment.  Not anymore.”
Harry shrugged.  “It’s a tradition I don’t even know the origin of.  It’s supposed to be for luck, or when you want to toast something.”
Harry took a small sip.  It was a bit like Pepper Up, but with a bitter undertone.  It wasn’t too bad.  Within a couple minutes, the pounding faded and he felt a little better.
“Or...?” Harry asked, unimpressed with that option. It was only mid afternoon, and he didn’t relish the thought of being stuck back in the dark cell.
“Um, tying you up isn’t about trust,” Draco started, pausing as he looked for the right words.  “I just find it, um...”
Pulling off his glasses, Harry dipped them in the water to get the mud off, gave them a shake and put them back on.  Draco just stood up in the water, his wet clothes clinging to his body, raising his hands to sluice the water out of his hair, pushing it back off his face.
Harry accepted it, but immediately set it down on a nearby table, and grabbed Draco’s hand.  “I have a surprise for you.”
Even though Harry knew he was teasing, Harry had to push down the jealous thoughts that sprang up at the mental image of Draco with another man.  “Um, yeah,” he mumbled, a bit distracted.  “Maybe you should immobilize me.  Give me a taste of my own medicine.”
Draco got the completely non-subtle hint, and his hands went to Harry’s waistband.  He pulled slowly downwards, manoeuvring around Harry’s cock, until Harry could kick them off.  His eyes were blatantly staring.
“So, what are we going to do today after lunch?  Make mud pies?” Draco joked, picking up his sandwich and taking a large bite.
It was a bit nerve wracking, waiting for Draco to arrive.  Even though he’d been over a few times, Harry started straightening the books on a shelf, and tucked some of the uglier old decorations out of sight.
“Fine, fine.  So, it was just setting up this job that you did out of guilt, or pity, or some combination of the two,” Draco said, pinning Harry again with his gaze.  His anger had calmed down, but it was still there, ready to flare up at the slightest provocation.
Draco pushed him, hard, and Harry fell on to the sofa.  Immediately, Draco crawled over him, holding him down and kissing him intensely.  Harry could hardly catch his breath, but he didn’t really care.  This would be a good way to die.
They went back inside, Harry leading the way, and Draco behind him.  He waved the wand at the door and it opened for them, magically locked, obviously.
“So, you found the place OK?” Draco said, letting him go to head over to the kitchen.  He opened a bottle of wine with some magical instrument, and poured out a couple glasses of red.
Harry ate the spicy stew, liking the level of heat.  Draco’s face flushed a bit, but he seemed to like the zing.   Having kheer for dessert as good, the Indian-style rice pudding cooling the heat the lingered in their mouths.
He must have eventually fallen asleep, having no idea how long until Draco had blown out his candles and slept as well.  Likely turned on his side also, turned away.
Draco murmured the simple spell, and Harry felt that surge of power along his skin, seeming even more intense this time.  He gasped, closing his eyes tight, the sensation seeming to zing right through his body.
But then Hermione and Ron appeared, and it was chaos.  Wands went flying, Ron was hollering and chasing after the Slytherins, as Hermione and Harry searched for the diadem.  Just as they found it, Ron came running back, screaming in fear.  Fiendfyre chased after him almost like a sentient being, and they all ran for their lives.
Never one to back down from a challenge, Draco clenched his jaw, shifted his arms and legs into position and bravely pushed off and started pedalling.
Harry’s welcoming smile dimmed, and he quickly glanced around.  He looked as guilty as four year sitting beside an empty cookie jar.  Covered in cookie crumbs.  “Um, is Grimmald Place OK?”
It was a long night, with his thoughts keeping him up instead of the pain.  He was in some remote castle with strong defences, so he doubted the Order of the Phoenix members or Dobby would be able to either locate him or get him out.  He was wandless, defenceless and alone.
It was late afternoon by the time they got back to their room.  Harry went into the washroom, using the facilities and then splashing his face with water and drying it off.
But Harry didn’t complain as Draco slid the tray under his door, his hunger forgotten as his feelings about what happened earlier took over.
Draco bound his wrists and prodded Harry along, his lips pressed tight together.  Harry simply walked down the steps and into the cell, feeling a bit sad as Draco locked him in for the night without saying another word.
They took their time, Harry easing in really slowly.  Eventually, he stayed mostly still, with Draco rocking back against him.  He cupped his lubed hand around his cock, and soon Draco was moving faster and faster.
It took Draco a second, and then his breathe caught.  He looked down at Harry, his gaze even more heated, and did a slow rotation of his hips, pushing firmly against Harry.
It took a few long kisses to settle Harry back down.  “Fine.  But you’ll tell me when you first started caring about me on the day we get engaged?”
“They will be back soon and find you,” Harry said softly, unable to meet Draco’s accusing eyes again.  He wanted to say more, but what could he say?
Harry sat up, right beside Draco, and reached over to take his hand.  “That this is amazing, more than I dared to hope for, but, um, I’m actually not that experienced.  I’ve been concentrating on fighting a crazy dark wizard for the last few years.”
A thought hit Harry, and it accompanied a sinking feeling in his gut, making it feel even more true.  Was all this, everything Draco was doing, in response to their fight?  He was calling Harry by his first name, after all, like he’d complained about.
Harry nodded, not completely sure what he agreeing to.  He was 99% sure it involved Draco and sex of some type, so he was on board.
Harry couldn’t just sit here and wait to be taken to Voldemort.  He had to escape, somehow.  He had to find a way.  He had to do it himself.
Surprisingly, Draco seemed to agree as he followed Harry as he strolled over to the pond.  They searched for rocks and worked on their technique.  Harry gave Draco occasional tips but mostly left him to figure it out on his own.  Pretty soon, he was skipping them pretty well.  Damn git.
Harry sat up straighter at the question. “Um, yes.  I think I can manage.”  He wanted to sound strong enough to do this, but not seem like a threat.
Before he got distracted, Harry did the same for Draco, watching his expression as he touched his cock for the first time.  Nothing in the way.  Loved it when Draco moaned, his hips arching upwards.
The voice nearby had Harry instantly alert and looking around.  Draco was holding a mug, and curled up on a big easy chair, gazing down at Harry.  He looked pleased, sipping his drink.
Harry rolled on to his back, covering his face with his hands.  “I feel even worse now, for what I did at the castle.  I didn’t realize you had feelings like that...”
Harry splayed them out, and felt the slight tingle of Draco’s spell dance over his skin.  His breath caught, and he closed his eyes for a second.  When he opened them, Draco was waving his wand over himself, cleaning off his own hands and some mud splatters on his clothes with a tsk.
And removing the kinky side of things had them in bed together, fully dressed and not even kissing each other goodnight.  That said a lot about Draco.  Without the kinky element there, he had much less interest in sex with Harry.
“Watched Quidditch games with the family, played it ourselves with starter brooms, read books, nights out to see concerts or plays,” Draco supplied, not sounded too interested in the topic.  “What do muggle kids do?”
It had been fun, cycling along the path by the river, just being outside together.  He felt pleasantly tired from the exercise.
Harry’s hands traced along the top of Draco’s waistband, stopping at his belt buckle.  This was crazy.  This was too much.  But he just wanted more.  And Draco was not moving away.  His hand moved downwards, tracing along his fly, feeling the hardness beneath the fabric.  Tracing it.
“No, no,” Harry quickly said, searching for what to say next.  He had been avoiding Draco.  “I, um-“
“Draco, please, please,” Harry said softly, standing up from the bed and walking slowly towards him.  “Can we talk?”
Harry wasn’t, but used the excuse to move in closer, tucking his face against Draco’s neck.  He smelled so good, felt so good, entangled together.
“OK, OK, you got me. You can let go now,” Harry said, pulling at Draco’s arm across his chest. He only breathed easier when Draco rolled away, lying panting on his back. “Um, normally it would be my turn to try to catch you now, but I’m feeling a bit tired. Can we go inside instead?”
“Yes, and you have house elves doing all the housework with magic,” Harry said.  He had basically been the Dursley’s house elf, cooking and cleaning as his aunt had ordered, living in a tiny space instead of a proper bedroom, wearing cast off clothes.  “We didn’t have that.”
But then Draco pulled back the covers on his side.  “Well, we better get our showers done fast.  Mrs. Owens only serves breakfast for another hour or so, and I booked us on a walking tour afterwards.”  With that, he was out of bed, and closing the bathroom door behind him.
He was tackled a moment later, Draco getting him flat in his back and kissing him until he was almost passing out from lack of breath.  “I love you too, you idiot.” Draco said, pinning Harry down and grinning at him widely, before kissing him senseless again.
And that, more than anything, made Harry want to cry.  He had missed Draco so much, felt awful about what he had done, and Draco wanted nothing to do with him except get his stupid wand back.
It became a blur after that.  Panting, kissing, thrusting, groaning.  Both a bit out of control.  Harry came first, all over Draco’s chest.  But he managed to keep his hold on Draco, loving the way he gasped, his body tightening and shuddering, finding his release.
“Well, no need to get lunch,” Harry said, standing up from the table.  Between this foodie tour and the big breakfast at their lodging, Harry was stuffed.  Delicious food, but he needed to move around a bit.
A minute or two later, Draco was pushing him on to a sofa and climbing over him.  “Brunch can wait.  Stasis charm...”
Harry let out a frustrated huff.  “No, no, it’s too soon for anything like that.  I guess I’m not sure what he wants.  Maybe it’s just physical for him.”
Surprised at the order, Harry slowly rose.  It was best to go along with Draco as much as possible, saving his resistance for the things that really mattered.  He was the prisoner here, and didn’t have many choices under his control.
By the time Draco came down with his lunch tray, Harry’s hair was mostly dry.  “What, no picnic today?”  He tried to go for a friendly tone.
Harry got up, turning back to the castle with shoulders slumped.  It was large and boxy, made of dark blocks of heavy stone, built as a fortress.  Impenetrable.
Eventually he pulled back, breathing like he had run a mile.  Draco stared back at him, dazed, confused, lips a bit swollen.  And then he was gone, almost running out of the pond.
Harry poured on a burst of speed, turning the corner to run down the other side of the castle. It was childish, running around on a lawn, playing tag, but it felt so good. His heart was pounding, his feet moving fast on the ground, breathing hard. Feeling more alive than he had for days.
It became a bit of a silly, playful competition after that, rubbing and eating food off each other, shoving it in each other’s mouths.  A slow paced food fight.  By the end, the tray was empty, they were full, Draco’s hair was stained a pinkish-red from some strawberries, and Harry had cracker crumbs in some very uncomfortable places.  It was worse than sand at the beach.
Draco grinned, pulling him to the far edge of the boat, leaning against the railing.  “A sunset cruise along the Thames.  With a four course meal and live entertainment.”
Nodding, Harry was just glad Draco was talking to him.  “We have been laughing together, having fun.  I am just feeling more drawn to you lately.  Surely you notice how your magic affects me every time.”
Knowing Draco was watching made it all impossibly hotter.  Harry pulled his hand away, moving it towards his mouth.  But Draco grabbed it, pulling it to his own face.  Harry closed his eyes as he felt Draco’s tongue dragging over his palm.  Getting it good and wet.
“Yes, just one more bottle.  But I was wondering if you feel well enough to walk a little without falling over?”
Why did it bother Harry anyways?  He’d had an amazing orgasm, and Draco seemed to have enjoyed it too.   Next time, Harry would insist on focusing on Draco.  It would all even out over time, right?
It was a bit strange, feeling Draco smooth the shampoo over his hair and working it in.  His touch was tentative at first, but he soon realized he needed to be firmer, push his hands through the thick, wet hair to get down to Harry’s scalp.  Soon, Harry was practically moaning as Draco did small massaging circles with the pads of his fingers.
“More eggs?” The woman wearing a pastel floral dress held a cast iron skillet towards them with a warm smile.
Rolling on his back, Harry stared up at the clouds. It was relaxing, in a way, being in this quiet place, not having to move from place to place every few days.
Harry was howling as Draco floundered about in the shallow water, finding his feet and standing.  He was completely drenched, his fair hair plastered to his head, struggling to spit out any pond water he had taken in.  The only thing that shut Harry up was cold water hitting him on the face and chest.
This was it.  The moment Draco could finally stop their... rivalry, if that’s what you would call it.  A few words, and Draco could have payback for all the trouble Harry had gotten him into.  Being turned into a ferret by Mad Eye Moody, besting him at Quidditch.  The horrible spell in that bathroom fight that had almost killed him.
The closest thing Harry had to a father was Sirius Black, even though it was for far too short a time.  If he hadn’t been killed by Bellatrix, how would he have responded to Harry’s actions?  If Harry told him the full story, would he be OK with Harry’s sexuality?  OK with what he had done to escape?  The thought of Sirius looking at him with disappointed eyes was painful.
As soon as he let go, Harry’s slick hand was wrapped around his cock, unable to hold back anymore.  His hips snapped upwards, fucking his fist, his eyes clamped tight.  “Fuck, fuck, fuck...,” Harry moaned, the whole night just overwhelming.  He had to cum, cum hard, right now.
Harry felt it in his knees, and he grabbed for support, his hands ending up on Draco’s hips.  He tugged him closer, digging his hands in, sinking into the sensations.
“I’m liking the idea of that house more and more...” Draco said, giving Harry’s skin a playful nip as his hands moved over his bare chest.
Holding him tight against her body, Bellatrix presented Harry like a prize before her nephew.  “Well....?”
It felt much better to be taking action.  It was a long shot, but they had to escape.  Had to get Hermione away from that witch.  Ron was more dominant than Harry had ever seen him before, grabbing Wormtail’s wand before Harry could, and disarming Bellatrix.
“I’m OK,” Draco said simply, leaning in to give a light kiss on his cheek.   “Um, watching you, um... was enough.”
“What?” Draco asked, jarred out of reading his book.  It was a sunny day, and they were sitting on the bench, enjoying the gentle sunshine.
Shifting to be between Harry’s legs, Draco leaned in close.  Harry could feel his warm breath against the tip, and his mind provided a mental image.  Oh, he needed to see this as soon as possible.  Wanted to see Draco take him in.
“Just an ordinary childhood,” Draco said dismissively, and went back to his book.  The title mentioned Merlin, and Harry assumed it was historical fiction about that infamous wizard’s adventures.
Draco pushed Harry against the wall, kissing him deeply, nothing held back.  Harry groaned, his arms going around Draco and hugging him close.  Finally.  It felt so good.  So right.
Draco opened a light blue eye lazily, peering at Harry. “Yeah, but what then? You can’t leave without a wand. Only I can get past the house wards to open the door.”
Rolling his eyes, Harry looked over the tray.  A beautiful charcuterie.  Cheeses, crackers, olives, nuts, fruit, salami, pickles.  He picked up a juicy chunk of pineapple, and pushed into Draco’s waiting mouth, deliberately dripping it on his chin on the way.
Harry tried his best to look innocent, but knew his face was giving him away.  “OK, fine, I vouched for you with Olivia Redd.  But you would be great in that job.”
Harry shivered at Draco cleaning them up, snuggling close, breathing him in.  “This is the best part,” he sighed, relaxed and practically boneless.
Harry closed his eyes as the magic swept over his bare skin like a lovers hand, leaving tingling sensitivity behind.  He opened his eyes to watch Draco clean himself, his hair even smoothing into its normal style.
The shower was still going.  “Um, OK, Draco.  I guess I’ll just let myself out then.”  It felt a bit awkward, speaking loudly through the bathroom door.
“Exactly.  When you can’t do magic, you have to learn how to use what’s available to you.  Skipping rocks is something most kids try to get good at.  A totally useless skill,” Harry explained, ignoring the slightly snide tone from Draco as he searched for another rock.  He found a few, and sent them out along the water.  Most skipped at least once or twice.
Questions popped into his mind, but were quickly pushed away by Draco’s touch.  He groaned, his hips arching off the bed, too aroused to hold back.
This kiss was so good, Harry just wanted to wrap his arms tight around Draco, and continue for hours.  He couldn’t, so he tried to relax and just enjoy it.  Enjoy Draco.
The head snatcher stepped forward, objecting to those comments.  Claiming his credit for capturing Harry.
Draco was sitting with his head clutched in his hands, white blond hair messed up.  His chest was heaving, like he was breathing hard or...
“Are you just going to keep me down here?  Alone, in the dark?  It’s inhumane!  It’s against the Geneva Convention!” Harry grabbed the full lunch tray and set it on his bed.  He didn’t want Draco to have the chance to snatch it back.
“Harry,” Draco gasped, tilting his head back as he sucked a faint pink mark into the fair skin on his neck.
Harry could tell Draco was upset, barely holding it together.  They had to get through this.  Clear the air.  He sighed, looking away.  “How about after all this time, you still call me Potter?  How am I supposed to take that?”
“Be still, or I’ll use a curse,” Draco ordered, his forearm pressed across Harry’s lower stomach.  Keeping him pinned to the bed.
Harry wasn’t going to argue with that.  It felt good to have his hands free.  “Fuck.  So there is really no way to get out of here?”
Harry loved the weight of Draco on him, his slim body surprisingly solid.  He had filled out a little, sleek muscles covering bones that had seemed more angular in their school days.  Draco was mostly kneeling between Harry’s legs, shifting over him.  There was a brush of something firm against his thigh, and Harry wondered if Draco was as hard as he had been for hours, or so it felt like.  There were too many layers of clothes between them to be sure.
What could he do?  Explore the cell to see if there was any way to escape?  Loose bars or stone blocks?  He doubted it, but he needed to know.  Without his wand, he had few other options.
“Well, if I’m too much of a bother, you could just let me go,” Harry said, letting out a chuckle in spite of himself.  Draco looked funny when he was angry.
Draco broke off the kiss, panting, but not moving away.  Harry’s hands went under his jumper, touching the warm, bare skin near his waistband.  Draco let out a small moan that went right through Harry, and went back to kissing him, his tongue pushing into his mouth.
The words and the warm breath against his ear, plus Draco so close, had Harry very aware of how long it had been since they had been naked together.  How good it was.  “What else do you think about?”
Eventually, Draco propped himself up on one elbow, and released Harry with a wave of his wand.  He still looked quite pleased with himself, Harry was happy to see.
Harry gave a light chuckle.  “I was raised as a muggle.  I was just wondering what my childhood would have been like if my parents hadn’t…” he trailed off, stopping himself from mentioning the name Voldemort.
He had lost most of his appetite, just contemplating it, and only ate some toast this morning.  All night, strange, disturbing dreams had awoken him, his heart thumping and an overwhelming feeling of dread.  This felt so wrong, in his heart, his gut.  But in his head, his cool, rationale head, he knew it was the only way.
Draco froze underneath him, his eyes wide, his face going pale.  “You aren’t...,” he stammered, barely getting the words out, “you wouldn’t...”
Harry had a quick shower, styling his hair and shaving in record time.  He pulled on his underwear and hung up the towels.
Harry did his best, trying to stay still, relaxed, as Draco kissed up his inner thigh.  He widened his legs, giving him better access.
“Fuck,” Harry gasped, as he felt Draco bite into the tender skin below his ear.  It hurt, yes, but it also made his breathing quicken and he arched slightly off the bed.
“Save it.  Gryffindors have nothing on Slytherins when it comes to lying,” Draco snapped, and looped his arm through Harry’s. He dragged him to one of the large fireplaces, and floo’d them to his place.
The snatchers’ grips were strong as they were pushed up to the iron gate.  Harry tried to keep his face neutral as a witch stepped into view on the other side.
“Shut up,” Harry laughed.  “But you did that spell on me, cleaned me, cleaned my clothes, and then seemed a bit strange afterwards,” he said, watching Draco closely.  “It’s because it’s usually something people do for others after, um, sex, right?”
Draco was sitting on the edge of the bed, but he stood up as Harry came forward.  “I’ll just be a minute.  Get comfy,” he said softly, kissing Harry on the cheek and darting into the bathroom.
Harry watched as Draco squirmed a bit.  “I think you were just playing with me, didn’t really mean anything by it.  But you said something about how I was being kinky, that I liked tying you up.”
It made sense.  Lucius had the upper hand now.  Harry Potter in a very secure place, ready to bring to Voldemort at the best possible time.  He would use this to his advantage.
Lucius, who could appear at any moment and grab Harry. Apparate him to throw him down at Voldemort’s feet. Harry could just imagine the proud tilt of his head, delivering such a prize to his Dark Lord. It would put him back in his good graces, back into his top lieutenant role. Voldemort’s right hand man. Malfoy honour restored in a single act, just like he’d said at the Manor to Draco.
The candles on Draco’s side were still burning, the almost overwhelming scent of vanilla mixing with the smoke coming off Harry’s extinguished ones.  He closed his eyes tight, trying to steady his breathing, relax, and actually fall asleep.  He was tired, from this whole strange excursion.  But he was too tense to fall asleep, conscious of Draco lying still on the bed beside him.
But then Draco rolled them over, straddling Harry again.  His wand was out.  “Put your hands up by the headboard,” he ordered, his voice a bit rough.
Harry glanced back at the castle.  “Surely in that huge building there must be some things to help while away the time.”
Draco seemed to sense his friends shifting, reacting to the tension between Harry and Draco.  “Easy,” he crooned, keeping them from doing something stupid.
Draco gave him a small, satisfied smirk, peering up through his messy hair.  “It didn’t take much, did it?”
Draco still had a mixture of emotions showing on his face.  Anger, resistance, doubt.  But his eyes did flick downwards.  Was he remembering those kisses?  Did he think about them as often as Harry did?
“Decency?” Harry shot back, a bit of anger creeping in now.  “I could hardly live with myself if we left anyone to die in that fire.”
The words reminded him of how he’d left Draco at the castle, and it sent a pang of guilt through him.  If he did this, as foolish as it was, he wouldn’t have to feel as guilty anymore.  Some payback for Draco.
A simple message with no signature, but it hardly needed one.  Malfoys always used eagle owls for their messages.  The large brown bird glared down at Harry with its orange eyes, clearly waiting for Harry’s response.
Harry pushed the stupid questions whirling around his brain away, and just concentrated on the moment.  Being here with Draco.  It had been an amazing night.  A great meal, talking about some difficult things, being more intimate with each other.  He’d never felt so close to anyone before, and just wanted more.
After rinsing it out, Harry did the same for Draco.  His hair needed much less product, and a lighter touch.  By the time the suds were gone, Harry just needed more.  He pushed Draco against the shower wall, his kiss deep and hungry.   Wet hands moved all over slick bodies, exploring.
In that instant, Harry’s arm was yanked hard, away from Dobby’s touch, and he fell.  His head cracked hard against the stone floor, and the world went black.
Draco kept splashing him, bending his legs to scoop up big waves of water with his hands and sending them Harry’s way.  Not all the water reached him, but water was everywhere and Harry slipped where he was standing, landing on his ass in the mud at the edge of the pond.
Coming out of the bathroom, he chuckled.  Draco had obviously kicked off his shoes and taken off his jacket, and laid right down in the bed.  He was napping, his mouth slightly open, looking very relaxed.
Leaning in, their noses bumped and Harry turned his face a bit.  Their lips connected, and his hand went into Draco’s wet hair, holding him there as the kiss deepened.  Harry liked feeling his magic on his skin, but Draco’s lips were even more intense.  He just wanted more, more.
Draco was laughing hard now, until Harry retaliated with flinging handfuls of mud.  His aim was very good.  It kept escalating until they were both soaked, mud-smeared and breathless.
He felt numb, the look on Draco’s face constantly flashing through his mind.  Pure betrayal.  He could hardly sleep, curled up on the dry leaves, half expecting to be discovered at any moment.
“OK, OK, there’s just one,” Harry said before giving Draco a long kiss.  Pouring his feelings into it.
“Next you will be asking for a quidditch broom and Celestina Warbeck’s latest record.  You are an enemy of the Dark Lord!  Of my family!”
“Well, that dungeon cell is surprisingly clean, but I think anyone would want to get out of it after a day or two,” Harry replied with a bit of a humourless chuckle.
Draco moved to kiss down Harry’s neck, nuzzling into his ear, his breath warm against his skin.  He was breathing faster too, making small pleased noises that turned Harry on completely.  Draco must have noticed, at some level, as he went back to kissing Harry, rocking against him.
What had he done?  Harry hadn’t thought about those years for a long time.  He hadn’t known anything different until he went to Hogwarts.  How much had he missed out on in his childhood?
He held out a small bottle towards Harry.  “It’s a potion.  I think you might have a concussion from when I tackled you.  Your head hit the floor pretty hard.”
Draco was on his side, facing towards Harry, still sleeping.  His hair was messy, lying against his blue pillowcase in all directions.  Harry was sure his own hair was just as bad.  What struck him most was Draco’s face.  Relaxed in sleep, he looked younger, reminding Harry of how he was at school.  Before things had gotten so intense in their sixth year, and they could still act like school rivals to each other.
This wasn’t Malfoy Manor.  That cellar had not had dungeons like this.  It seemed like a more ancient building, built of rough hewn stone.  Maybe even a castle.
It was warm enough that his pale skin was getting a bit rosy, either from the warmth or a light sunburn.  It was a nice contrast against his light grey eyes and the silver white tone of his hair.  The sunlight caught the faint stubble along his jawline, the fair colour of it making it invisible most of the time.
The question stopped Harry before he could continue in his rant.  “Oh...um...”. He searched his memory.  Where had he heard the term before?  On deeper consideration, it was likely from overhearing it on a muggle TV news program at the Dursley’s.  It had something to do with treating enemies correctly, didn’t it?
Eventually, Draco sat back, his lips swollen and his eyes  half-lidded.  He released Harry’s bonds.  “I better get home,” he said softly, swinging his legs to sit on the edge of the bed and tugging at his clothes to straighten them.
It took a lot, but Harry shook his head, stepping away.  “Everything is getting mixed up together. I think we need to be able to be together without any of that stuff before we experiment more.”  He was still breathing fast, and tried to push down his baser urges.
-Foodie Tour:  They take a 3 hour tour of London Bridge area and the Borough Market, with its “flourishing food scene, mixed with real London life, historic culture and charming ambiance. The area is packed with exciting little back streets, pubs and market stalls, all adding to its appeal as a unique gastronomic destination.  The guides will entertain you with stories about the area,” including Sir Francis Drake's Golden Hind, the Shard, Southwark Cathedral, the world-famous London and Tower Bridges, and the Battleship HMS Belfast.
Draco still looked uncomfortable.  “Well, she could see I wasn’t myself so she invited me out for drinks with some of her friends.  Muggle friends.”
His skin was a bit flushed, his eyes burning with anger, and his hands were waving around.  It was the complete opposite to the cool, remote Draco Harry had mostly seen in recent years.
Draco seemed to agree, as he stood as walked with Harry back to the door.  He slipped inside, returning quickly with his wand, and binding Harry’s wrists before allowing him to cross the threshold.  They did the now familiar actions without meeting each other’s eyes, and when they went down the stairs, Draco kept his distance.
Harry felt a pang of pain, feeling sad for the childhood he never had.  It wasn’t his parents’ fault they had been murdered.  His childhood hadn’t been ideal, but maybe it had been for the best, in a strange way.  He hadn’t known anything about Voldemort, or his notoriety in the Wizarding World.  He probably would have been just as full of himself as Draco was, if he had grown up with everyone praising him for doing something he couldn’t even remember.
“And why do you want to tie me up most of the time?  You say it’s just a kink, but I wonder sometimes if you still don’t really trust me,” Harry continued, running his hands through his hair.  “If the stuff from the castle or from before is still there, fucking things up.  A dark shadow hanging over us.”
Harry nodded.  “Yes, this first.  Need you so bad,” he moaned, kissing down his neck.  “But the house elves?”
Draco had picked him up after work on Friday, barely letting him go home to change and grab the bag he has packed, before aparating them far away.  He had kept the details a surprise, and Harry felt excited anticipation to see what the weekend would hold.  Brave new territory for both of them.
“Um, yeah,” he said.  “It’s about tying me up... why do you always want to...,” Harry fumbled.  “Is it because you don’t trust me?  Think I’ll go too far?”
Draco must have sensed he was being watched, as he shifted a little, and his eyes slowly opened.  His sleepy gaze widened when he saw Harry lying so close, and met his gaze.
Draco scoffed, looking away, rubbing a hand near his eyes to wipe away some moisture.  “That wasn’t a hard choice.  It was a selfish one.  Putting myself before my family.”’
Goyle shifted beside him, not liking the lack of action.  “Come on, Draco.  Don’t be a prat. Do him.”
Being blindfolded was a new sensation, and it made Harry feel a bit vulnerable.  So many things had, being with Draco like this.  Physically vulnerable, but also emotionally.  Needing to trust Draco so much.  But Draco had not abused this trust.  That thought helped Harry sink back into the soft pile of pillows, getting back into the moment.
His response had Draco narrowing his eyes, a bit surprised.  “I seem to recall you enjoying yourself.  Or were all those orgasms faked somehow?”
Draco seemed to want it just as much, arching his neck when Harry hit a good spot, his pale skin turning a deep pink when Harry sucked and kissed at a certain place a bit too long.
With a quick wave and a mumbled spell, a rope wrapped snugly around his wrists, binding them.  Only then did Draco unlock the door with another spell.
A bit surprised at the request, Harry obeyed, and felt the magical binding secure his wrists again.  So Draco was OK with Harry being unbound outside, but not when moving through the castle?  Why?  What was he trying to keep Harry from doing?  What was he afraid of?
Harry let out a breath, and gave Draco’s hand a squeeze.  “I think we both deserve to have it be special.  Let’s take it slow.  Date.”
Grabbing the bottle of wine, Harry took a swig as he watched Draco walk naked out of the bedroom.  Was he ready for this?  He took another glug of the wine to help settle his nerves, and followed him.
Draco entered the bathroom as Harry was combing his wet hair, wand in hand.  He pulled the plug on the sink, letting the water drain out.  With a flick of the wand and a mumbled spell, he passed Harry his t-shirt, clean and dry.
He must have been showing his thoughts pretty clearly, as Draco seemed to take pity on him, hugging him close and kissing him deeply.  Harry squeezed him tight, loving the feeling of being in each other’s arms.  What had happened earlier was more about sex and exploration, but this was about liking and being increasingly comfortable with each other.  Both were exciting steps for Harry.
“Run off and skip some rocks?” Harry joked, liking that Draco was telling him some private stuff too.
“Past tense?” Draco asked, trying to say it jokingly, but his eyes were watching Harry closely.  He cared about the answer.
Harry scoffed.  “That would devolve pretty quickly, I think, into a mud fight,” he said, taking a bite a raw carrot.  “Um, how about making thing out of paper?  Like paper airplanes?”
His rational side brought up point after point, but none of them totally settled him down.  Something was off.
“The sex was good,” Harry said, unable to deny it.  Even now, he could feel a strong pull of attraction, seeing Draco like this, being in the flat where they’d had sex so many times.  He turned away, moving to the window.  Trying to slow his breathing and think more clearly.  If they were going to talk this out, he needed to bring up what was bothering him.
“You mean when you pretended you liked me to take advantage of me?  Left me tied up while you escaped?  Do you know how embarrassing it was to be found like that by the house elves?  How awful it was to admit what happened to my father?”  The anger was back, making his eyes almost glow.
“We go out for lunch with clients sometimes,” Draco explained.  “Drinks after work with other potion makers.  Friends of theirs.  You know, on all those nights when you work late.”
Harry could see how stiffly Draco was holding his shoulders and could only imagine how horrible it had been.  “I can’t say that I’m sorry I got away, Draco.  You know I would have been killed if I stayed.  If there had been a way I could have done it without hurting you, I would have.”
It was strangely intimate, getting ready for their date in the same room.  Harry turned away as he pulled on some black trousers and an indigo dress shirt.  Should he wear a tie?
A strand of his white blond hair fell forward, almost into his eyes, and the spring sunlight made it almost glow against his pale skin. His skin had a bit more colour in it from these past few days, from sitting outside together here, than he’d had back at the Manor.
Draco was sitting on the other end, legs crossed, twirling his wand.  Completely unconcerned.  “Satisfied?  I told you there was no way out.”  He pointed the wand at Harry’s wrists, and the binding disappeared.  “I don’t think you need that when you are outside.”
Were they going to have sex?  This whole day had been such a diversion from how they normally were, Harry had no idea.  Draco, sending him warm looks and calling him Harry, acting so couple-ish around Mrs. Owens and at the restaurant.  But any touches had been fleeting, a quick squeeze of Harry’s hand or a guiding arm along his back as they entered a room.  Nothing signalling Draco wanted more.  No lingering looks, no heat in his eyes.
“Lay it flat along the side of your thumb, and then press your other thumb along the other side,” Harry explained as he slowly demonstrated. He cupped his hands together, keeping lots of space between his palms, and raised them to his mouth. He blew steadily into the tiny space between his thumbs, wiggling his hands to make small adjustments, until suddenly a screechy whistle noise pierced the air.
-I’m considering writing a sequel, following as Draco & Harry date and fumble to figure things out.  Let me know if you’d be interested.  :)
Even though he was aroused, Harry didn’t push for more.  He was loving this, kissing along Draco’s neck, his face.  His lips.  Harry kissed him again and again.  All the ways he had been wanting to for weeks, but had held back.
Harry mentally flipped through the possibilities.  Draco was around Pansy Parkinson a lot, but Harry thought she was more interested in Draco that he was in her.  Blaise Zambini?  Was he gay?  Was Draco?
Draco seemed just as inexperienced, which made Harry feel a bit more comfortable.  But even Harry could see things weren’t going that smoothly.  Draco was a bit moody, cuddling with Harry at a game on a chilly day, and then seeming aloof when they went for a hot drink afterwards.  Seeming to want to be alone with Harry to make out, but pulling away like he had earlier.
The morning seemed to drag.  After eating, Harry tried to nap but did not feel that sleepy.  He explored the cell, feeling over the walls and the iron bars.  It was solid and surprisingly clean.  Had the house elves been down here before he arrived, cleaning it for Harry’s arrival?
“Should I leave you alone?  Not sure how long until someone finds you?  No idea what the time is?  Completely trapped?” Draco said, with a bit of a smirk.
Grinning, Draco showed him what was in his hand.  A big jar of lube.  He set it on the beside table and crawled towards Harry.
And then Draco rolled off, to the side, panting himself.  Seeming to need a minute or two to cool down just as much.
Harry kept thinking Draco would stop, roll off, and release Harry.  Call it a night.  But time after time, they cooled down, breathed normally, and Draco would kiss him again.  It was almost embarrassing how quickly Harry became a panting, sensitized mess, pressing upwards to rub against Draco, turning his face to kiss along Draco’s jaw.  Wanting to taste his skin, feel his light whiskers rasp against his lips.
Harry couldn’t help but smirk at his disgruntled expression, and giving him a kiss.  “Well, they got some stuff right, but a hell of a lot wrong.”
He awoke from a light nap to a strange sound.  The cell door unlocked and swung open, but Draco wasn’t there.
Harry swung his face around a little too fast, and grimaced in pain.  Eventually he opened his eyes to peer through the gloom.
Harry had fantasized about this so often, he just followed his natural urges, his instincts.  Experimenting with his tongue, his lips, his teeth.  Sucking, licking, kissing.   Listening to Draco, feeling a zing of arousal each time he moaned, doing whatever caused it again and again.
Harry was ready to agree to anything at that point.  He was nervous, but excited, scared of hurting Draco.  But he knew now from experience that it felt good if done right.
Nodding, Harry leaned in until their foreheads touched.  “Yup.  In fact, let’s make it our code.  Our euphemism.”
Just like with skipping rocks, Draco wasn’t satisfied until he was making equally annoying sounds himself. His eyes glinted in amusement when Harry cringed at a particularly loud screech.
Draco shrugged. “Or you come up with some way to amuse me. Maybe run into the wards again.” He chuckled, his eyes warming at the memory.
Draco smoothed his palm over Harry’s, spreading the lube, warming it.  “Yes, lots for me, lots for you.”
“With that type of wine?  Hardly.” Draco said, shutting off the tap and tugging Harry along. “Let’s find some clean shirts.”
Lifting his arms, Draco rested his hands on Harry’s shoulders.  “Yes,” he said, and shoved Harry back on to the bed.
Harry shuddered at the sensation, and turned his head to look at Draco.  “Oh,” he said, realization coming to him.  So many pieces clicking into place.
And then he felt something else.  Draco’s lips against his, and his hand going past the bars to dig into his hair.  It was hard and passionate right from the start, way more intense than any kisses he’d had before.
Harry had rarely seen him looking so frustrated, and it raised similar emotions in him.  A mess of unvoiced, unresolved stuff.  “Do you really have no idea?”
At the door, he pushed Draco against the wall and kissed him hard, deeply.  Loving the way he returned the kiss, hungry and eager.  Their breathing was fast, hearts pounding, by the time Harry pulled back.
It was a bit of a barb.  Harry had used the excuse of working nights to avoid seeing Draco too much, obviously.  “Well, I’m glad you have settled into the job.  Made some friends.”
Finally, one of Draco’s rocks skipped twice.  “Yes!” Harry exclaimed, feeling a bit proud of his student’s success.
Harry made a pleased hum, relaxing even more.  Draco must have noticed, as he kept doing it, his hand running through all his hair, until it was untangled and easier to card through.  He kept up the strokes, seeming to enjoy the feel of his hair.
Harry grabbed his hand and squeezed it.  “It’s incredible.  Looks delicious,” he said, but his eyes were going down to Draco’s lips again.
Harry gave him a small smile in return.  “Um, that was nice of you, but I think I’m OK.  I’d like to eat outside, if that’s alright.  Get some fresh air.”
“This house has something in common with another one of your family’s homes,” Harry said, pulling out his wand and uttering
He barely had a time to look around before Draco was taking him outside.  It was even brighter, a bit cold.  The sky was overcast with high pale clouds.  The grounds were well kept, with a rolling grass lawn and tall, trimmed hedges.  A few trees here and there, but no flowers.  A bit stark.
Anger and frustration bloomed inside Harry. Obviously Draco had been making his own plans, and predicted what Harry may try.
Shaking his head, Harry was again impressed by how far Draco had come.  From sneering at ‘mudbloods’ to working under one.  And seeming to really like and respect her.
Draco shrugged a shoulder.  “I should have kept my mouth shut.  Pretty much everyone was saying I’d been an asshole and no wonder you were ghosting me.”
“Next you’ll be telling me we have to shower together because your wand is getting repaired,” Harry said, pushing those silky strands back to see Draco better.
He was so focused, so lost in the moment, it was a bit shocking when Draco’s grip loosened, and he pulled away.  Harry looked up, confused.  Draco was still breathing hard, his eyes a bit wild, his face flushed.  “I’m close,” he said roughly.
Draco’s face paled and he looked away.  As much as he talked the big game, he did not take death lightly.  Harry had witnessed how he had delayed killing the wandless Dumbledor, and finally Snape was the one to do it.
The room was a lot darker, and a quick glance at the windows showed that Draco had pulled the thick curtains shut.  But that wasn’t all he had done.  There were a bunch of candles burning on each of the nightstands, giving off the scent of vanilla.  The covers on the bed were folded back invitingly.
Unrepentant, Draco leaned in for a kiss.  “It worked, didn’t it?  It got you into my bedroom, and naked on my bed.”
Harry chuckled.  “It’s not the first word that pops to mind when describing you.  But it applies more and more these days.”  He leaned in, forehead against forehead.  “I love you like this, being so open and honest.”
“Well, that’s hardly fair.  You were exonerated at the trial, just like your mother,” Harry said calmly.
Harry wanted to apologize, to somehow explain, but knew it was futile.  Better to wait until later, when they had both settled down a bit.  He went down to his cell, Draco trailing behind him, calling himself ten types of fool.  Any trust he had built was gone with that one stupid act.
Bellatrix and the others continued to bicker on, but Harry could only watch Draco.  His worst enemy from school had him in the palm of his hand, and could crush him at any moment.
It made Draco jump in surprise, and he dropped his blade of grass. Harry chuckled, then pressed his lips to his hand again to make the noise again. Moving his hands, he could vary the pitch a little, and played around as he watched Draco try to copy his example.
Attentive waitstaff soon served them smoked salmon appetizers, followed by soup.  A piano player was playing softly, helping with the romantic ambience.
Through slitted eyes, Harry held his breath and tried to calm his breathing.  Draco stood before him, looking over his face slowly with impassive grey eyes.  His skin seemed even paler than usual.  He was in the black suit he had worn on the Hogwarts train last year.
Hearing his name like that sent Harry over the edge, hips pounding up into Draco, filling him up completely.
After binding Harry’s wrists, Draco opened the door.  Harry moved slowly, like he had no energy, down the hallway, up the stairs, and then outside.
“You don’t like it as much as treacle tarts, do you?” Draco said, taking the last bite of the warm sticky toffee pudding.
The use of his last name was still jarring.  Even after all these dates, Draco still used it, surely knowing how it bothered Harry.  One of the many ways he toyed with him.
Luckily, they came across some Quidditch brooms and started flying out of the room.  Harry heard a scream, and saw Goyle falling from a high stack of furniture into the fire.  It was awful.
Leaving the diadem in its box, Harry stepped away to face them, heart pounding.  His eyes drank in the sight of Draco.  He was wearing his black suit, looking much the same as he had a month ago.  But his face was a bit thinner, his skin paler, and his eyes harder than Harry had ever seen them.
Sighing, Draco rolled off Harry to lie beside him.  He blinked up at the ceiling.  The room was dim, with just moonlight coming in through the window.
