He approached stealthily, he didn't want to scare anyone, and he didn't want to get any unpleasant surprises either. He wanted to tell Pansy and Blaise that their plan to scare him away had utterly failed, but on the contrary, he was almost petrified as the silhouette of the person rose from its place and was right in front of him.
"Hey," Harry said awkwardly. Maybe he didn't think too well ... -. Uhm, I saw you in Madame Malkin the other time and… you… did you seem familiar to me? ”Harry struck himself thirty-seven times mentally. Sincerely .. .—. I am Harry, Harry Potter. You are...?
And for a moment, he held his wand tightly, very tempted to do so.
You get obsessed.
Harry opened his eyes, feeling sting in them. He dared to kiss Draco's forehead, promising that he would never do it, that he would not allow it. Draco was someone very special, and he would learn to show him how much he wanted him; because he would protect him, everyone would have to respect him the same as him ... he would have to pull some strings in the Ministry, and maybe not everyone would like what he did, but he didn't care ...
(See the end of the chapter for notes .)
Even though she still hated him.
-Hades to Persephone. Homeric Hymns.
"A chaos, that happened," she replied, leaving her place next to him again to head back to the exit. I will let your friends pass, I think you will feel more comfortable for them to talk to you.
When Harry entered the office, a leprechaun in a red suit sitting at a desk that looked like it was made of gold was grinning at him (Harry wonders if leprechauns can smile otherwise) and pointing to some chairs on the other side of the desk.
-None. But I think you will better consider your answer when I ask you to lend me your notes. Now the smile on her face was mischievous, as if a little girl had stolen a candy fudge from Grandma's candy box before eating.
"I don't think I had an answer really… just, I think I left it to chance."
Chapter Text
Draco's eyes widened a bit in surprise and he thought for a few seconds how that Harry knew that it was all due to a headache, and also that he knew what his favorite midnight snack is.
He was like a friend — not wanting to sound too sentimental. Very different from his friendship with Pansy and Blaise - since their relationship was based on sarcasm and frolicking - or even the recent closeness with Hermione - which was purely intellectual.
"What kinds of behaviors?" Draco looked very interested in her answer.
And all that, he did not care.
That night, he cried like he never had.
Chapter 14 : Chapter XIII
Oh Merlin. Who to trust.
Harry Slytherin smiled and rose even higher. It was like giving a child a sweet.
He stretched his arms up to loosen the muscles in his back and took a deep breath; at least everything that happened yesterday had been relegated as a memory of an intense day. A moment created by his so fanciful mind.
A wave of energy emerged from Harry and spread throughout the site, smashing the windows, dislodging the doors, and fracturing all the porcelain in the sinks and toilets. His face felt numb, his brow furrowed and anger running through his veins in an inhuman way; he thought briefly, that perhaps he had exaggerated his reaction. It was a fact that he was upset ... because he felt in those words an unbreakable truth, something that he had a hard time admitting, the cowardice of not accepting from before that swirl of emotions that Draco Malfoy caused him; He took a deep breath before calming down, but still had a face that evidently betrayed how angry he was.
A few days passed since the arrival of that Harry; And if most of the students did not find it strange to see a version of Harry with Slytherin colors, walking and smiling arrogantly at everyone who looked at him, it was definitely the work of a powerful entity to see how that same Harry Potter always walked, everywhere, alongside Draco Malfoy.
Chapter 6 : Chapter V
Coffee kisses (and with milk for those with gastritis)
Their beds — albeit parallel — were separated by at least a meter, and the fact that he felt Harry's green eyes scrutinizing him meant that his gaze was absorbed in his every move.
"Everything okay, Mr. Potter?" McGonagall said without looking at him.
Ding-dong.
I will answer the comments of the previous chapter shortly <3 I already saw that the Harry they prefer is the Slytherin, and well, I love it too, I ended up obsessing with him. Thank you very much for your comments, kudos, and favorites!
The thud on the back of his neck snapped him out of his thoughts, and he looked at his aunt trying to remember why he was fond enough of her not to lock her and her stupid husband with their silly son in the cupboard. It took him too long to remember a reason not to make them all his slaves, but he still left a neutral mask over his face as his aunt yelled at him to hurry up and ignored the viciously amused look on his cousin's face. .
Fulfilling her most cherished fantasy felt fucking good.
This is slowly getting hot ... in every way.
He didn't want to push him any more than he already assumed he was, and he understood her reluctance to make contact with him. It would give him time — just a little — to clarify his ideas; although that did not say that he would retire. He would continue to move on Draco's map, stepping into its periphery at intervals, so that he would not conveniently forget what had happened between them.
-I have to go.
In those moments, he was convinced that life had something against him. He had lost his parents at the tender age of one year; Impossible to remember them on his own, there was always someone who told him about them and with all that, he continued to feel empty. Bear living eleven years and summers after that age with relatives who never gave a show of affection. Being teased his early years at Hogwarts by going against Potter nature and belonging to Salazar Slytherin's house.
Jealousies .
"Good," he said, although very quickly his face changed when he understood what the other said. "Third?" What time is it? Draco asked with terror in his voice and flung the tempus spell in front of him with his wand.
Chapter 18 : Epilogue
A lightning bolt scar on his forehead.
"You always say those things." Draco looked out of the window overlooking the black lake.
And the whistle blew.
He raised his eyes to the window in front of him and was immersed in the dark blue sky outside. Noticing the time, he decided it was all he could read for that day; he would have to get up early to train on the court a bit before school, as the next game against Ravenclaw was getting dangerously close.
Chapter Text
The director cast a spell to expand Draco's room a couple of meters, and from a small stone that he took from a corner, he formed a bed very similar to his own and being separated only by a small wooden stool between them.
And the only way to know is to have seen it. No one knew those little details about him that Harry from the other world knew so well; He did not know how to feel about it, something similar to affection arose below the annoyance he felt, even understanding and pity, because he vaguely remembered his reaction when the indiscreet Weasley asked him about the Draco of his world and as something very similar to the lust for blood flowed from her magic.
Or at least it was like that until he remembered where they were, and that Hermione saw him with a face that had not been directed at him since he was an idiot mocking Cedric's death.
AHHHHH, I THINK I'M SCREAMING!
Listen Harry… I'm very happy to see you like this, smiling. You more than anyone deserve happiness. And believe me when I tell you, that I will support you in everything you need. Go get him, and don't let him go until he gives you an answer.
He clenched his hands in an attempt to control his impulses; he felt hurt, confused, disappointed ... the sadness that inhabited his heart was a prelude, a warning that soon life would slowly drain from his body, much like the day he faced Voldemort and had to die to save his world.
As he walked down the hallway that led to his bedroom, he remembered that Pansy promised to leave him some sandwiches in exchange for his notes, so he returned to the common room and was surprised to see someone's shadow cast on the fireplace. Few Slytherins returned to Hogwarts. Most of them were new entrants, and so it was strange to see someone in the dungeons when it was dinner time, more specifically in the common room.
"It wasn't the fall," he said, rolling his eyes. I've known this for a long time, before going back to eighth grade. That's why I broke up with Ginny, but she was coward enough ...
Too bad .
Soon, Madam Hooch's whistle ending the match; the look of glory and complicity that was directed between the other Harry and Draco, both embraced and as on Draco's pale face a blush became evident.
"I suspected it," she whispered with a rueful face. I mean, sometimes he talks in his sleep, and I didn't know if I was hearing well or it was just my imagination.
Notes:
In front of him was his reflection. Like a mirror, a magic mirror that revealed a very different version of himself.
Again the lights came on and the heat filled the room again.
"It's a joke, right?" Ron asked in a shaky voice.
Although, deep down inside - and she didn't want to accept it at all - she had begun to enjoy the presence of Harry Slytherin. He pronounced himself proud to be friends with Draco, to appreciate him even with the mistakes that more than one already told him —because by that time, all of Hogwarts knew about the visit of that Harry from another world—; and Harry… he wasn't paying attention to anyone but Draco — and McGonagall. In addition, he always had gifts for him at all hours of the day, which included sweets, fruit - green apples in particular -, the odd book of potions that were very difficult to find ... and, above all, the nightly talks that managed to distract him a bit. Of the disastrous life I was living
He decided that it is better to do than to say ... or it was his animal part that spoke, because without asking prior permission, he took the member out of the obvious prison to which he was subjected and swallowed it in his mouth completely.
Well, generally speaking: Harry is frustrated, a lot. Reading some books that he guessed had quite a bit of information about the world he currently resides in hadn't helped him at all, just to go over some basics and history that (he swears) Professor Binns had told at some point, between his stories about his youth and the rebellion of the goblins. Harry hadn't asked much before , but now that he intended to use as much information as possible to his advantage, he began to have too many questions that he was sure would take time to get answers, and Harry really wasn't the patient type. Merlin knows.
Harry watched as Minerva McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose before looking at them again; his face was totally frowned, it was evident the disgust he felt at that moment. They were all in the most elegant office of the school, it was she who occupied the chair behind the desk of the Headmaster of Hogwarts and at their sides, were the restored portraits of all the previous directors of the school; Apparently, nothing was able to calm that great annoyance that I felt.
But he never imagined an answer like that; Draco was looking at him with a scowl on his lips, and there was something in his eyes that he had never thought to see ...
McGonagall saw his eyes for the first time and the pen that wrote beside her stopped.
The entire course of the day was relative. Between ignoring the pang of despair that blossomed every time Draco pulled away from him and the need to cast a spell on the Harry of that world — who was grinning like a perfect asshole — the hours passed so quickly.
Probably for this reason, the Malfoys were influenced by Harry's ideas, those in which he disapproved of everything related to Voldemort, since anyone could be the next on the list of the most evil wizard in history, even with an unbreakable loyalty that many abject ones had been mentioned.
"The Death Eaters were the ones who helped You-Know-Who, Harry, who were all Slytherins," Ron repeated slowly, as if Harry hadn't heard him the first time.
Draco thought it was a bad joke.
Draco nodded, quite in agreement with the unspoken proposal of a name for his roommate.
Hermione expressed to him with concern and curiosity, the - not so - recent obsession she felt towards Draco, and Ron reminded her that he looked just as rough as he was at sixteen. At that time, he had the pretext of being suspicious and following him because they were at war and the other had radical ideas, but now ...
He wasn't especially prone to pressure. Throughout their coexistence he learned that the Draco of this world, unlike the counterpart of his universe, worked very poorly under pressure; he became insecure, not very calculating and even gloomy; he had to have control in order to think clearly.
Let's see what happens from now on.
"Thank you ..." Hermione took the candy cautiously, but frowned at them when she paid real attention to everyone. They should get dressed now, I just got back from talking to the driver and he said we'll be there shortly.
He wasn't going to be Draco's best friend, first struck by lightning, really , but Harry would also try to save him and his mother. To his father, if the man shows that he really cares about his family at any time in life and not just when it is the last thing he has left. Thanks to Dumbledore, he actually began to think that not everyone deserves a second chance, but this , all this starting over in a new life and doing things right and knowingly, was a second, maybe a third chance to Harry and the whole damn wizarding world, and possibly he would be a hypocrite if he was able to ignore Draco and close the only window on him when all doors led to certain death.
. x. x. x.
"I don't know what you're up to, but I won't let you do it," he said calmly, sure. She wiped her face with one of the sleeves of her robe and kept looking straight at him.
Harry couldn't meet the inquiring gaze of his friends and leaned his head on the head of the bed. Little by little, the fuzzy memories of the other Harry's gaze came to his mind, with that Slytherin pride and the smile he had when he scored the 190 point for his house since, with this, it indicated that he scored 15 times by himself to Gryffindor.
It passed faster than he thought, and he did not realize it until he was in Harry's large arms, who lifted him easily - even when he was a couple of centimeters ahead of him -, brushing his nose with his, smelling the scent of coffee and cookies that were freshly eaten. He was captivated by the beautiful green color of her eyes, the amount of feelings that were reflected in the brightness where it was reflected.
"I'm in love with Draco Malfoy, and I don't know what to do."
"I'm not interested in anyone else, it's because I love you that I'm still here," she answered, looking into his eyes. I could give you a kingdom, you could go with me when we get the journal restored. You would no longer be an outcast, you would have the world and myself at your feet.
"Whose name?" They asked at once, and when they saw that Ron was pale, they looked at Harry.
He loosened his brightly colored tie a bit, trying to help him breathe better and control himself, but he couldn't, and he felt that if he didn't, he would explode at any moment.
Everything about the otherworldly Harry emanated something very opposite to him.
"In that case, I find no reason to listen to you and stop using the other Potter's lotion," Draco said, ignoring the twinge of disappointment that surged through him. It smells good, and I like it.
"Do you want to sit with us?" We were talking about Quidditch. ”Harry stepped to one side of the door and gave Malfoy an encouraging look when he looked at him doubtfully. Come on in.
-You're bad. Draco smiled. That's why I like you better.
Dying could be anything, but Harry never thought it would irritate and bore him so much.
If only they knew that what arose two years ago did nothing but grow inside them; like a little flower that, in the midst of adversity, begins to bloom.
"Didn't you say it already?" Draco just saw the Harry in front of him laugh in a very strange way. Almost manic.
"That's the most sensible thing you've said since I got here," said his counterpart, and walked over to him. I could give up everything I know to be with Draco one more time, what are you willing to do? She looked him up and down and smiled, smug as always. Nothing. Like you have for eight years.
"Well, we still don't know what really happened," Ron replied, rubbing his head. When Madam Hooch marked the end of the match the moment Draco caught the snitch, the other Harry and the rest of Slytherin flew towards Draco to start celebrating, and after that, you walked up to them and went with a very angry, very similar to when you had the locket. You had the other Harry by the lapels, there was an explosion of magic and you fell from your broom on the grass.
"So ... you really ...?"
We read each other in the next chapter. <3
"It only confirmed a few theories." Harry shrugged, but he was actually telling the truth. There were very few times that Harry had the key to his vault in his previous years, so he thought it was normal, until he found out that Hermione had hers. Galleons can be exchanged for pounds, right? British pounds?
(See the end of the chapter for notes .)
It didn't take him long to read it and believe what his brain was processing.
Slytherin Emperor .
And this time she wouldn't let him.
And, now that he knew of the existence of other dimensions, Draco constantly asked himself the question "What if ...?"
"Harry, what is it?"
It didn't really matter all the history he had learned, from the earliest records in Ancient Egypt to the beginnings of dark magic and the massive witch hunt of which the Muggles fell victim. For some reason he didn't really want to think too much, the writers of books on the history of the British wizarding world (even the ones he read so far) believed that the unintended adventures of a one-year-old baby with a dark wizard were much more. interesting to fill more than three chapters per book with falsehoods or half-truths and increasingly ridiculous theories, than to explain why dark magic did not work well with certain wizards and worked too well with others, or why even wizards and magicians Muggles did not go to war despite the clear enmity between them, or explain blood supremacy from an objective point of view and not completely despise or praise it, or ...
Harry Gryffindor could see how his other self walked alongside the headmistress of Hogwarts, so elegant, haughty, distinguished, with his ego inflated to the sky, very similar to ...
-Please. How many times have you been told you should repeat that? ”Ron crossed his arms and looked at the blonde with a raised eyebrow, but Harry ignored Malfoy's answer, thinking of another question.
And although deep down he was grateful, he could not feel a sincere tranquility, because he was not the one who managed to placate everyone. His presence only diminished the harassment towards Draco at times ... but he never managed to dare to do that.
And all those emotions led him to make the decision to tell Pansy everything that happened, so that she — in her infinite wisdom — could give him advice on where to look. He found himself in the need to relate every event of what had happened to him in recent months, and even go back much earlier, when he discovered that in fifth grade he began to feel a crush on San Potter.
Well, that sounded like a good compliment and it fueled his ego for a moment. He knew he was one of the most remarkable, but that McGonagall recognized his talent and put him on par with a brain-eating book like Hermione Granger — and of course, Gryffindor as it was the headmistress's favorite house — was very remarkable.
What weight would Harry's name have if he were linked to a former supporter of the Muggle genocide idea? They would think, of course, that he spoke on behalf of the Malfoy family for something more than just the truth; they could even claim compromised judgment if he were to openly reveal some privileged feeling towards the Malfoy heir.
Chapter 5 : Chapter IV
You are willing to cross to other worlds.
The Slytherin, of course, the Gryffindor had been on the run since that day, when everything got out of hand.
-No I can not.
"Ah, you are the Harry of this world."
Terrible and cruel jealousy.
—Believe me I won't… I don't have a damn diary, and it's really you who worries me, because you do have one and you left me…
He got up from the lawn where he regularly lay, showing for the first time a smile. He would have to try hard, find the ideal that awaited him out there; maybe in a world where the Harry over there died.
The post-orgasmic reactions were the strangest, because there, feeling all the heat of the moment, unleashing his most recondite fantasies, he knelt on his knees and quickly unbuttoned Harry's pants, delighting in the thickness and hardness of the penis that It was perfectly marked on the boxer shorts.
"Good night, Draco," Harry replied and watched him lie down. Through his voice he projected happiness. Rest well.
He saw the doubt on his face, the intrigue of a bet on his ego as a seeker of the Gryffindor house, a staunch enemy of Slytherin and a classic that all Hogwarts liked to see. It was a wonderful opportunity to prove to be the best again.
"You are quite a case." Hermione's laughter echoed down the hall.
Thanks for all the comments! I think we all love Harry Slytherin, in fact, I take the informative space to tell you to create a group on Facebook to love this character <3 That's how intense the love hit me.
Draco Malfoy was not with them.
For an instant, he stopped breathing.
Harry just walked through the makeshift corridors, looking among the people who had fought side by side with him in that impossible war; some if he knew them, others were new faces. It might sound cruel, but maybe all of that was necessary for the course of history to continue with a happy ending.
"You were an idiot with them, I couldn't just stare," he said, shrugging his shoulders and soon he felt his cheeks swell, probably from a spell cast by the other.
"Fuck you," she whispered in annoyance, and rose like him. I won't get into your stupid games.
Well, he wasn't the one who walked side by side with the Malfoy heir.
But like all good Gryffindors, bravery is about standing up to fear.
He was trapped between the mattress of his bed and Harry's burly body. Suddenly, he felt the heat build around him; his cheeks felt hot and he began to sweat.
"Potter sucks."
Harry felt conflicted; although he was already determined to be frank, there was something that, even when he denied it, marked him too much. He was the Boy Who Lived and hero of the wizarding world and Draco Malfoy was a former - as far as he knew - Death Eater. That was not heard well anywhere; social opinion, appearances ... everything that was not relevant before, became essential at the moment of being seen in public.
I wanted to touch it. I needed to hug him.
"What about a Harry Ravenclaw?" Draco asked, and by the face he had, he was intrigued.
"Right now, if it can be, actually." Harry shrugged at Petunia's gaze. You have denied me too much knowledge about the world that I will be a part of from now on, and I only have a month before classes start to catch up. And "he added when he saw that Petunia seemed to protest," it's less time you'll have me here.
Going through his Hogwarts list, he decided to start with the books. Entering Flourish and Blotts, he decides that in addition to the first-year books, he will take the opportunity to buy some about the history of the Wizarding World and some more about defense, enchantments and potions. Snape completely screwed up that matter for him, and it actually all started with three unanswered questions and everything was on the wane from then on. Maybe having the answers could actually make things a little easier this time.
"No," Harry replied, and handed him a chocolate frog he had kept, "but do you want a chocolate frog?"
He decided to take time to think about what he really wanted. It was more than obvious that he liked both Potter boys, and curiously, for completely different circumstances from each other; the Harry with whom he grew up, meant the constant in his life, he was the one who had seen him in almost all his facets - not to mention the obvious rubbing they made many weeks ago - and therefore, it could be said that he knew him. On the other hand, the Harry Slytherin, the one who came into his life as an intruder three months ago, gave him the stability he so badly needed, he was the carrier of a calming energy, being with him was almost as natural as breathing.
"Do you regret asking me not to put you in Slytherin?" The hat asked. He is everything you could be if you stayed in the house I originally intended for you.
Chapter 13 : Chapter XII
"Wait until you hear me out, I know you'll be interested…" he said and when he saw her paying attention, he continued, "so I bet I'll score more than 150 points on my own before you find the golden snitch." If I don't make it, I won't get involved with Draco anymore.
They did not know what time it was.
Wearily and hunger sated, Harry flopped down on the bed in his room in the Leaky Cauldron and took a deep breath with his eyes closed. Now, it only remained to wait until classes started, so Harry had a month from tomorrow to catch up on all his books and plan a few more moves. He couldn't actually leave his room, not if he knew that at some point someone from the school or someone Dumbledore's acquaintance would pass by, be it for personal things or to search for the Stone, Harry didn't want to risk it. Even though he knew none of them would know him, he really would rather stay in the room reading and preparing.
And with that, Draco watched them walk away towards the kitchen. Outside of the honeyed spectacle he witnessed, many questions ran through his mind that perhaps none of them would answer him, but he had every intention of finding out. Seeing that there was no one around, he approached the entrance of the infirmary and opened it very slowly, avoiding as much as possible any unnecessary noise; He entered and in the distance, he saw Harry's bed being illuminated by a small table candle, enough to indicate where he should walk.
As she served the food carefully (the food was not to blame for her discomfort towards her relatives), she briefly thought that she could stay at Tom's until the start of classes. It assumes that you have already served enough time in that house for the protection barriers, which by the way, something else to study.
Harry stopped abruptly where he was. That voice was like hearing himself echoing endlessly outside Hogsmeade, near the screaming house. But she swore he hadn't said those words.
What better way to honor the dead than to do the things they enjoyed in life?
Hermione and Draco saw Harry leave the library and until he heard the door close, he let out the air that was contained in his lungs. Relief came to his mind at intervals, thinking about what his life would be from now on; He would have the afternoons free, again the bedroom would be only for him, he would no longer wake up listening to the adventures of a Harry Potter ...
Notes:
"Sorry for worrying me," Draco said with a frown, feeling a bit attacked. I suppose a basic level of courtesy between team captains is enough to confuse you.
"I propose something to you," he said, stopping very close to his counterpart, the one from that world. We cannot compete because we both have different positions ...
But he still felt a hypocrite. It was a very silly pretext, and even someone as clueless as Ron Weasley might know it.
Thanks for reading, see you soon.
He wanted to last longer ... he wanted to prolong that moment for the rest of his life ... but being a person with little experience in sex, he couldn't contain the coming he had when Draco caressed his testicles, pressing his thumb between them.
Did the room temperature rise?
-I did it. I had to explain again what happened so that she could write it down on a scroll and keep it under lock and key, ”he replied, putting on his Slytherin uniform. By the way, you and Granger will have to help me research local and Muggle books I can get, all about dimensions. I will be able to give some names of course, but I didn't really check much of it ...
And the stone rolled in front of him.
"Draco, come out with me," Harry said after taking the last drink from his mug. Draco looked at him with a raised eyebrow, as if he didn't understand his words.
He walked to his bedroom and was surprised not to see anyone around; maybe if she turned around and headed for the dining room she could find them there. Quickly dismissed the idea and continued walking, that day, oddly enough, he did not have much desire to see anyone in particular.
"None, ma'am." I just want to advance my plans. I hate goodbyes and if I leave on Monday, rest assured that I will break more than three hearts when I leave.
Draco became the sun star of Harry's little universe, the one he depended on completely for an afternoon of adventure or to study tediously for the next potions test. His best friend stood out from the rest of his Slytherin companions who were small asteroids that made his life a little more bearable with jokes towards the Gryffindors and mockery of the Hufflepuffs.
-What happened? He asked still with a headache and drank the entire contents of the container before receiving a second order. It tasted disgusting.
He walked back to the dungeons; it was a blessing that everyone was busy with dinner, for he would not have the patience to deal with someone who wanted to ask him about the unfriendly face he carried. When he got to the room he shared with his partner, he collected the few belongings he considered valuable: a photograph he cut out of the school newspaper, just as Slytherin was crowned champion after defeating Gryffindor; He took out of his drawer the Snitch that Draco had given him that day and took in his hand the journal that he would take home.
-Yes Yes. Enough. —Draco enjoyed when Hermione got nervous and began to blush with the effusiveness of whoever was hugging her; it was the effect of the Harry Slytherin.
That is to say, elsewhere, there was another Harry Potter; He did not know if the same as him, dumber, balder, more intelligent ... but that was not what filled his face with life, nor did his eyes dance with joy.
-Count on that.
"Mudbloods are inferior to purebloods," Malfoy apologized, shrugging. Ron looked annoyed, but nothing more. It is just a term for them.
He always gave him his space, tried to make him lower his guard, so that he could intervene by making sure that the other took into account his existence, even when there were times when they were not together. The tactic he had planned since he arrived in that universe and saw how things were, was taking a nosedive after almost reaching the cusp.
"We promise to think of something, okay?"
And it appeared .
Harry Slytherin put his hat on the desk and looked at them all smiling. It seemed certain — and even petulant — that this was going to happen.
I was just thinking stupid things.
"Good, I'll help you." Draco, for the first time in the morning, fixed his gaze on Harry and saw the other almost jump with joy. The faster you go, the sooner I'll have the room to myself again.
"Where I come from, we have defeated Voldemort, and apparently the same thing happened here," he replied with a shrug. He didn't have much to do there, and neither did friends. So I decided to travel between dimensions in order to help in whatever way I could to ensure that He who should not be named does not triumph in all universes .
Notes:
-Why are you here? Harry asked, struggling to get up from his bed to approach him.
"So Death Eaters are part of this blood supremacy thought?" Both boys nodded silently, and Harry, despite already knowing this information, smirked. It was always going to be fun to hear about how stupid Death Eaters were, chasing blood supremacy and kneeling before a half-breed . Without saying anything more about that, he turned his attention to Malfoy. The term that you use, 'Mudblood', is incredibly disgusting. Are pureblood supremacists using it, too?
The fury inherent, but suppressed in his being, was released when he heard him speak. And, like when he encountered the Harry Slytherin days ago in the bathroom, formless magic exploded; he was sure that he tried to conjure a repel , but having his instincts unleashed, he collided with the barrier that the other Harry formed and that was what made him lose his balance and fall into the void.
We are reading. Blackberry kisses.
I want to thank all those people who read this story from the beginning, I thank from the bottom of my heart all the comments, kudos, favorites, bookmarks, etc., that they dedicated to my first long-fic of this otepé that I love, to all who believed in this premise that I had never read and was born by a fanart that I am in love with, and which soon, I will bring another fic, because I love my Harry Slytherin, it is very cool.
Questions you may never receive a satisfactory answer to # 23: why do wizards have to leave the wizarding world (I highlight 'leave the wizarding world') to the muggle world to ENTER the wizarding world AGAIN (I highlight 'enter the wizarding world again ') to catch the train to Hogwarts? Isn't it easier, I don't know, for each magical family to have some kind of transporter from their homes to the express? Or that the platform had hundreds of chimneys, like the Ministry?
Chapter Text
-Good afternoon.
He also couldn't be alone in Quidditch because the Harry Slytherin had set out to fill a vacancy as a hunter - and he had to admit they needed a good one - so he was accepted almost unanimously after a brief audition.
"Even if they recognize the Weasleys for not being assholes and not for being Death Eaters."
-The same.
"You're right," Harry replied to the accusation to the surprise of Draco, who was still glaring at him. I just ... I wasn't expecting you.
"Shut up," Draco said reaching out his hand, feeling that with that he was still marking the distance between them. He was nervous, his hands shook and his voice almost failed him. You can't be playing around, Potter.
After Draco had left him with the confession without answering on the day of the Quidditch game, anxiety and sadness filled his days, believing and firmly thinking that it was all over, that he had been late and that, without a doubt, his Slytherin counterpart had managed to separate him from the only thing that managed to anchor him to the present. So when he received the owl with Draco's message in days past, he felt a sense of elation that he couldn't explain.
And although at first he managed to eat some chicken and vegetables, believing that Draco did not come because he was with his friends, it was the moment when he saw Pansy Parkinson and Blaise entering through the doors of the great dining room that something in him woke up.
"You know, from the other day," he said mockingly, lifting his broom up.
(See the end of the chapter for notes .)
"It's for that very reason that supremacy exists, then," Malfoy spoke. If they marry between pure bloods and have offspring, the family will remain pure. If you break that chain, marrying a Muggle or Births with dirty blood , are avoiding the magical power of the family go your way, making weaken or, in the worst case, become extinct.
Thank you so much for all your beautiful words, which Harry do you prefer so far?
Despair, anxiety, sadness and even anger… they were among the feelings that came with rejection; the absence and the distance was the perfect recipe to be able to heal from that person who was no longer there.
Perhaps different from his, because his world was perfect, unrepeatable, unique.
Special .
Have you ever thought how disastrous love is sometimes?
-Already. It seems that neither you nor I are going to give in on this, right? Draco leaned back against his pillows and looked up at the ceiling. Why better not call you differently?
"I still am," Draco said, scowling now and looking quite annoyed.
In the three nights since she followed Draco to the infirmary after the Gryffindor game — and watched him sob outside the dungeons for longer than her heart liked — things had changed between them. Usually he and Draco used to talk about a lot of things they had in common because they belonged to the same Slytherin house even when it was not in the same universe, like Professor Snape or the nights of smuggling spree in the dungeons—, they ate mid-range snacks. night while laughing at things that happened throughout the day and even discussing training strategies for the Quidditch team.
-What is this? He asked holding the bag between them.
It was incredible and disconcerting to think that, for Harry, a month and a half ago he had seen tired faces and hunched shoulders, and now he was seeing them many years younger, full of life and with bright eyes. It didn't matter who he looked at, or how long it would take, one thing was for sure: Harry would live day after day trying to keep the smell of blood, dust and destruction from his senses, and when he saw his friends, families, teachers , first you will see them preparing for a war, accepting death after a long fight that they would not win, before realizing that no , they were not preparing for a war, but for a quiet school year, for a family dinner or to head to the common room to play explosive snap.
It was just Harry, him, and heat that radiated from his body in contact with each other.
Everyone won ... everyone but him.
He had been running away — again — from the Harry Gryffindor since the night of the Quidditch game; and also, he marked a distance with Harry from his house so as not to get more confused than he already was - although this was fiercely shot down the night they shared the most extensive talk he had ever had with the Slytherin version.
Nothing did if he was not there.
Going to Diagon Alley will be easy. He will ask Tom if he could open the passage for him and he will just be 'Harry' to everyone but the Bank ... and Ollivanders. Well, two people acknowledging it. Also, he had a month to go shopping, but he would rather go alone this time. He loves Hagrid, really, but the man is not responsible enough to take care of a child. The affection beats in his chest when he remembers the first time he was in the Wizarding World with the half-giant, and no, it is not something he would do again, even if he knows what to do and where to look now. Wait, Hagrid hadn't picked him up on his birthday to take him to the Alley? No, Dumbledore had sent it because the letter had not been answered. Great, now you also have to respond to a magic card without Hedwig. Did Diagon Alley have a mail center? Would the Wizarding World really get to that level of stupidity, not having a mail center?
"When I came down from the bleachers, you were unconscious," Hermione said, stroking Harry's wrist. You had a broken leg and two broken ribs. We ran to bring you to the infirmary to be restored, apparently you are already out of danger.
When his turn came, the goblin looked him from head to toe.
"There's no particular reason," he replied, looking down the hall, making sure no one peeked near where they were.
And also, he acknowledged, that for many years he longed to hear the Harry of his world say those words to him, to look at him with that contained desperation and anxiety.
"Do you regret it?" The voice of the sorting hat snapped him out of his thoughts.
He didn't hesitate and began to massage him, robbing Draco of more of a moan.
When he saw Draco, his mind was flooded with images of Draco bloodied in the bathroom in his seventh year, the look of despair and utter fear when he had to kill Dumbledore, the resigned look when he believed that Harry would let him die in the cursed fire. in the Room of Requirement. They weren't thoughts about a stupid supremacist kid, a rich kid who treated anyone but his 'select' group of friends badly, who despised anyone who wasn't a Slytherin. He only thought of a teenager whose world took a 180 degree turn, who relied on the wrong words of someone he admired and trusted.
It was true?
-What?
The heat increased between them, and Harry, who was too connected at that moment, decided to increase the caresses he gave Draco; He unbuttoned the other's pants in a hurry, and while his mouth was dedicated to kissing and licking Draco's sweat-beaded neck, his restless hands ran over the skin of the other's slim abdomen, quickly sliding their movements towards the penis — already something. hard — that he was trapped in the boxer briefs. He pulled the elastic just enough to be able to lower it and free the member; He turned his gaze downwards for a moment and let out a moan of pleasure as he corroborated that Draco carried perfection everywhere: a nice penis slightly darker than the rest of his body with a pink head stood up and submitted under his caresses.
And even with all the hubbub, laughter, teasing, and beer smuggled into the school, he couldn't help but feel concerned about who the Harry of his world was. He was shocked to see everything up close, the fall was huge, and although news reached him that he was fine, there was something about him that did not allow him to feel comfortable until he saw it.
It's a long explanation that needs too much proof that Harry doesn't even have.
"I always thought we all have something we're exceptionally good at." He smiled encouragingly at Ron when he looked at him doubtfully. I, for example, am very good at cooking — it wasn't a lie, actually, but what else was I going to tell him? What was exceptionally good at not dying? I have no siblings, but from what I learned about the wizarding world so far, I definitely have a very high bar too.
But just thinking that he might vanish made him stop on the spot.
It was torture, because they were physically identical to the naked eye; But if he paid a little more attention, the ambitious look in Harry Slytherin's green eyes was his biggest difference and hopefully, he saw him in Salazar's house cape.
Thaks everyone for reading! They are wonderful, for loving this fic baby as much as I did when I wrote it.
He had been in that world for a month and a half, and perhaps things did not turn out as he expected at first, but without a doubt he was a very lucky boy, because everything was slowly settling in his favor. Last week, the school principal scolded her counterpart for the tantrum she was honored to witness in the second-floor men's restroom; In addition to the detention as punishment, he made him repair the damage and with all the pain in his heart — it was obvious that he adored the Gryffindor house — he subtracted points from the other Harry's house.
Harry opened his eyes, barely recognizing the sly voice that answered him. He got up slowly, turning his face, hoping that this was not a lie, much less a sign that he was going crazy again; there, near his feet, was Draco sitting looking uncomfortable, even though he wanted to show one of his haughty looks.
With a weary sigh, an appointment for tomorrow after lunch, a thousand pounds in one magic satchel, and a thousand galleons in another, Harry left Gringotts and looked down the busy main street. His stomach clenched from hunger, but he was actually a bit thankful that his body was used to little or no food right now, because the less time he spent in public in the Wizarding World, the more time he could have privacy.
To his love.
"Weasley," Malfoy said. Certainly yours are easily recognized ...
Hello! I hope you continue to love our Harry Slytherin ... this character little by little enters Draco's life, and I think Harry Gryffindor doesn't like him too much, will he do something to stop him?
"My guardians are not exactly fond of ... the Potters." I don't really know much about inheritance, ”he apologized, though the goblin didn't seem impressed. Anyway, I really want to do my school shopping as soon as possible. Maybe we can save the reading of the will for another day?
Draco threw a snowball created from his wand at him and Harry met the attack with another. They declared a small war that soon ended with their clothes wet from the melted snow due to the heat.
Not to mention the kiss he gave him the first night he arrived, and with which he felt disarmed in a couple of seconds.
And all because of him.
-What are you talking about? You are Harry Potter!
"I lost my cologne and took some of the other Potter's." I didn't want to smell like you after a workout.
Anxiety.
"Why are you always involved when strange things happen?"
Not Harry, Harry was Draco's best friend and for his son, Lucius seemed to swallow everything he wanted to say.
Notes:
Just a little empathy for the person who had helped rid him and his parents of such a terrible place as Azkaban.
"Good evening… Harry," he said curtly, but gave him a smile so as not to make Harry feel bad, after all, he was the one with the problem. He was the one who had to figure out what to do with the current situation.
Hermione, as she supposed, passed by without even seeing his face.
And then he got lost in the crowd, although he knew exactly where to go: Gringotts. He should talk to some manager or whatever first, he really wanted the power of his key and to know exactly how much money he had. Reaching the large building, he simply continued on until he reached a small line of people in front of the main counter, and waited his turn without looking at anything but the back of the man in front of him. He knew better than to stare at one of the goblins.
In the beginning, the only person who understood him was the Draco with whom he grew up, that pretentious and conceited boy whom he won his heart; his eventual death brought him to the brink of insanity and later, when he thought he would not find someone else, the Draco arrived from whom he slowly came to appreciate him. It hurt to have to leave him, but maybe it was for the best.
Above all, he didn't want the Harry at home to see him like that.
Notes:
"Indeed, Mr. Potter," the goblin frowned. Why would you think otherwise?
But it wasn't long before all those ideas were completely gone when the Harry Slytherin took it upon himself to spoil him to death, to be there to distract him when he woke up at three in the morning to the nightmares that haunted him, or his Afternoons without hunger when he gave her a sandwich that was smuggled in the library, and even, in the silence of a room in the dungeons where the only sounds came from the turbulent water of the black lake crashing against the window.
"You see, you were very close to the snitch, but for some reason, you didn't see her, and Malfoy took advantage of that and started chasing her ..."
"I don't know, my head hurts a lot," he answered, rubbing his eyes. What happened? I remember playing Quidditch… and from there everything is blank.
The weeks passed, and he did not come to greet him. He didn't want to take a wrong step, but he wanted all the harassment directed at Draco to stop completely. For this reason, he decided to always be everywhere where the other was; In the large dining room he sat very close to Draco, in the classes they shared, he decided to be at the table behind him, in the hallways, he decided to walk at his own pace so that they would see him near him.
He even told him about that warlike world destroyed due to Harry Potter's fall to Voldemort; a universe from which he escaped as soon as he had the first opportunity and to which he never wanted to return.
He walked down the hall until he reached the common room, filled with such deep green and black… he felt drowning in them, as if being there was something so alien and exciting at the same time. He soon saw Draco standing right in the middle of the place, turning his back completely to where he was standing and slowly approached him.
It was better not to ask. And stop thinking about what that Harry was doing to him.
He was dedicated to observing him, to learn more about the Draco of this world, who, in essence, was very similar to the one in his universe, but there was something different, and he wanted to know everything.
Chapter Text
He felt very hypocritical.
-What's the trick? He asked, taking off his glasses, as if that made him look more cunning.
Ahhh, how I love all your comments :) They make me smile, and continue this beautiful story that arose thanks to a fanart that I saw between these two Harry's who are stealing our hearts.
He tried to calm down and began to move straight to the Quidditch court, because over the last few weeks, he knew that Draco had been calmer when he was practicing alone at unusual hours; perhaps loneliness gave him a certain peace. Not seeing him nearby, nor noticing that the common things for training were on the grass, he decided to walk to the next place.
He could perfectly see how Harry Gryffindor's face went from annoyance to disbelief, then serious. It was a very juicy offer, irrefutable of being the other and had given too many hints of his obvious intentions with Draco Malfoy of that world; He could almost see that the other was keeping the victory in his pocket, after all, who had been able to score so many points on his own in a school game?
He barely returned to his room and Draco was no longer in the room; he guessed that, like lately, she was avoiding him. He decided to shower and attend the first class of the day; he would have to skip breakfast and survive on the snacks Pansy gave him. It would be a very tiring day now that she thought about it, because between the classes she had to attend - in which, except for Draco and Hermione, most of them were bullshit - and the creation of the diary - of which it was almost complete - , his time was saturated.
"That's exactly what I mean!" Harry sighed wearily. I am Harry Potter! And what the hell does that mean then? I've lived my whole life with Muggles who didn't like magic, so I've lived my whole life not knowing that I had magic, or that there is a whole world of magic, where apparently I am famous for defeating an evil wizard with problems. of self-esteem by feeling threatened by a silly one-year-old baby. What exactly does the magical world expect of me? There are five or six year olds who are more knowledgeable about magic than I do! Did you know that there are books that tell the story of how I defeated Voldemort? ”Harry took a deep breath before continuing to speak, ignoring the look Ron was giving him. I didn't even know that my parents had died in a war, because my relatives told me that they died drunk in a car accident! And it turns out that they are bloody heroes, and that there were thousands and thousands of people who knew about it, except for me, their son! And what, the wizarding world expects me to come to Hogwarts and become the most capable and powerful wizard that ever lived? Well let me tell you, they are insane. All magicians who believe that, especially adults. I am a boy, I am just Harry, I am not the savior, nor the most powerful, nor anything else that stupid books have said about me. You understand what I'm saying, right?
And that took its toll on the rest of his body.
"Because I needed to find out a thing or two about me with him." You won't understand, and I don't have the need to explain it either, just… ”Draco took a deep breath and continued,“ I'm here with you, do you understand?
"I finally found you, Draco."
"Ah, Harry Potter, I figured I was going to see him soon." Ollivander tilted his head slightly to the side, his pale eyes shining brightly. You have your mother's eyes. I think it was yesterday that I saw her, with the stretchy willow wand, ten inches long. Perfect for enchantments. Your father, on the other hand - the old man had a blank look that, if Harry hadn't seen it before, he would surely have flinched - mahogany wand, flexible, ten inches. Little more powerful and fair for transformations. The wands chose the correct wizards, of course. ”Harry almost repeated his words along with the man, but he thought that would actually be a problem, and disrespectful, so he just made his eyes more surprised when he heard them. It is the wand that chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
"Knowing that you will stop treating me like a criminal." I want to live in peace for the rest of my time here.
"All I remember is my mother's death." Harry narrowed his eyes when Ron looked at him pityingly, he didn't mean for his statement to come out so gloomy, but he really had no other way of telling it, but as he didn't really want to. talking to it, he took advantage of it. Anyway, how many siblings do you have? They seem like a big family.
Harry believed, for a moment, that he did trip over running and was now passed out outside the school.
But he knew that Draco made his choice, and sadly, he had to accept it.
Strange.
You no longer feel the softness of her skin under your hands.
Harry opened his eyes and felt a deep headache; It was hard for him to ignore the aching stab a little before he could even straighten up. From experience, he knew that this was because he passed out after a heavy fall; He blinked many times before slightly regaining consciousness and location. She recognized the fluffy bed in the school's nursing room, the sunlight slowly dissipating through the window, giving way to the first navy blue blankets that covered the sky; from what he deduced that it was already night, most likely a few moments before dinner. He looked around and there was no other student or person there, he was alone.
And if the training he did in broom flying scoring quaffle after quaflle in the hoops only from five in the morning to 8 am without a break did not corroborate it, surely the frown and the rictus in his mouth would.
And Harry kissed him. The other's lips moved calmly over his and he didn't know how to respond; It was a light touch, almost soft and comfortable, transmitting in that tremulous caress an infinite affection that he never believed anyone could give him.
Draco smirked a little. It was funny to imagine that Harry Potter with Slytherin bearing — defending him vociferously from all the clandestine and inquisitive gazes — excited for a couple of smuggled goodies. The smile on his face, with the dimple forming in the right corner of his face, was something he had only seen in the distance, hidden between sneaky glances.
"Well, we Slytherins take our promises very seriously, but if you need to, we can take an unbreakable oath."
There was no going back.
She gathered up her things, carefully putting her scrolls and pens in the small briefcase that Blaise gave her, and threw in a tempo, indicating that it was close to nine at night; It was past dinner time, and she didn't want to look ridiculous by arriving when everyone had surely finished. He hoped Pansy had saved him a piece of cake.
"Honey, if I was you, I'd suggest a threesome," Pansy said, when midnight came and they were alone in the Slytherin common room eating fried foods and drinking some of Nott's smuggled brandy. But it is obvious that neither of them will accept it, because they both want you only for themselves. Draco, the next thing I will tell you will be very Hufflepuff of me, and may Merlin and Morgana forgive me: Until now, you have been divided, you must listen to what your heart tells you and feel what is going on in your mind.
-Thanks. —Maybe it was because he was feeling overwhelmed, but he wanted to be a little grateful with such a disinterested gesture and he got a reward that he never thought he had.
Soon silence came between them, and for brief moments they relaxed, though the stillness was somewhat uncomfortable.
Chapter Text
Harry Slytherin looked at all the mess made by his magic and didn't look scared; perhaps because, unlike him, he was already very much in touch with that part of him, familiar with the idea of feeling those emotions and sensations that he had repressed so much.
"Mr. Malfoy, hurry up." I need you to teach him all the house rules, I don't want him to take advantage of something and mention that it didn't exist in his world.
And again.
Almost immediately after meeting, Draco approached him that day of September 1 seven years ago making him an offer of friendship; and although at first Harry knew that he was conditioned by seeing the pampered face full of ambition, he did not care much if with it he managed to learn more about that world of magic that was denied him for eleven years.
Chapter Text
He stepped to the side quickly to avoid being hit by Ron as he looked at the big engine and the platform full of wizards, witches, and students of various ages and Houses. Compared to the first time he arrived, where everything was too much in a short time, things were quiet despite the crowd and noise, the day was sunny and everyone's excitement was almost palpable in the air. He smiled wistfully, although he snapped out of his stupor when Ron moved to his side and, followed by him, Molly looking at him with concern.
Slowly, Harry stopped kissing him gently and the other's teeth snapped shut from moment to moment, biting his lower lip. Draco tried to ignore the storm of sensation that threatened to wash over his mind; he wanted to find out if this was part of a sweet nightmare, a product of his tiredness and lack of food. Until a tingle on her lips brought him back to the present, only to focus his gaze on the emerald gaze that was staring at him.
-Wrench?
And so they did, they walked a little through the streets of Hogsmade in silence. It was difficult to break the ice after so many years arguing at the first opportunity, but not impossible once they started discussing Quidditch, how the Slytherin team had improved with Draco as their captain.
(See the end of the chapter for notes .)
Chapter Text
He opened the journal to start writing; the first few pages were full of parcel writing for trial-and-error tests at the time of creation and he came to a sheet torn in half, frowning, unable to remember when he did it. He shook his head and slowly, the feather he had hidden in his raincoat began to scribble; little by little the newspaper began to emanate a bright yellow light, almost as warm as a sunset on the beach ...
(See the end of the chapter for notes .)
He just hoped Ron and Hermione could answer his questions, and if the situation called for it, he would go directly to Percy. Although now that you think about it, it would be a lot quicker to go straight to Percy and ask him for books than to wait for Ron to stop complaining about studies and for Hermione to read the books herself before recommending them, and, Merlin, she loved her best friends. , but he definitely couldn't afford to waste time. The sooner everything about Voldemort is destroyed, the less chance he will have to return in the near future.
The magician who wrote it had mentioned the theory of the existence of worlds parallel to his own. He did not describe evidence, nor did he manage to say clearly where his central idea was headed, only mentioned that he had gone to the Muggle world one day and stopped his excursion at a Muggle University where many people - apparently quite intelligent - were meeting in a class. and in this they indicated that our universe was not the only one that existed, but that in parallel there were other realities that coexisted with ours, on a different but simultaneous plane.
He couldn't believe his good luck.
"I never would… not if your wish was really to come with me."
You decide.
White chocolate kisses.
Draco had a dream body, a body of crime. He melted when touched, being slightly deprived of his breath ... he tried to store a whole repertoire of what his partner liked, and he grew adrenaline in himself when he heard the moans and guttural sounds that denoted the ecstasy in which he was it enveloped her lover's body.
"Mr. Harry," McGonagall interrupted with a smile. Go away.
That sounded a lot like trouble .
Yes, things were going from bad to worse.
"Yes," Draco replied instantly and drank some of his butterbeer. More than you can imagine.
All the green and silver teams were walking towards the Quidditch pitch. There were few people who supported them - as always, the favorites were the Gryffindors - so they just walked to the center of the court and did a few warm-up exercises. There, all the members of the Gryffindor team were already, showing off their gallantry and waving towards the stands to those who supported them.
Harry, never stop looking for me. It was the last he heard from Draco as he fell right in front of him.
Notes:
He could almost tell that he liked her.
Harry expected any reaction from Draco; he could tolerate a stabbing hex, or an everte statum like he did in second grade… maybe he would even put up with a sarcastic, self-centered grin like the one he always had before sixth grade.
"... unbelievable," Fred finished, nodding.
Harry stopped smiling a little, barely showing a small shadow of the happiness he exuded earlier. Slowly, she dropped him back on the floor, and took a step away from him, marking a distance that automatically tormented Draco's calm.
If it was up to Harry, absolutely nothing would be the same this time. The prophecy? He's still not quite sure about it, but if he realizes that avoiding her only complicates things more, he will simply destroy all the horcruxes except one (not counting himself ...), he will revive the reptilian idiot himself and they will kill each other, as soon as possible. He won't wait three years for Voldy to get his gang together again, this time it won't give him an advantage.
"It was your questions, Mr. Potter." The goblin didn't seem to be mocking, but Harry still wanted to hide under the chair. Do you want the reading of the will right now? Or do you prefer to talk about your family vaults?
He could feel the intense gaze of the Fucking Boy Who Lived piercing the back of his neck as soon as he was a little distracted; He could not know what was going through his mind, but he felt, at times, that he preferred the revulsion with which many pairs of eyes saw him than the uncertainty of the unknown emotion with which Harry was looking at him. And it was thanks to the constant presence of the other in his life, so close to him as to be able to breathe the natural scent of Potter, that he felt the whispers around him diminish considerably.
Notes:
And the calm face in front of him, along with the slightly wicked laugh, reminded him that it was all worth it to be there, in that moment.
He walked over the scaffolding to Hogwarts, there was only one way to find out if this was the world he came from.
There was no day that Harry was without Draco. Little by little, with a lot of effort from both of them, they became the best of friends.
"I'm sorry, Harry." Your friendship is more than enough, ”said Ron, shyly taking one of the chocolate frogs after Harry insisted to both that there was for the three of them. I will not be friends with a Slytherin.
Despite the harsh words Draco was saying, he didn't pull away from him one bit. Harry felt empty, as if all the energy he had accumulated during the day was stolen from him in a heartbeat. And even as his mind traveled, he felt when Draco's lips began to kiss him and he returned the gesture without hesitation. It was a slow, calm contact, they enjoyed the soft tickling that their teeth produced in other people's flesh; very different from the kiss they had a couple of months ago behind a ruined pillar at Hogwarts.
Everyone cheered around him. It felt repulsive; he never wanted to be part of that damn prophecy, he only did it so that there would be a future with the one who now lay without a pulse in his arms.
-What are you talking about?
Suppose.
Harry wanted to record that moment. That caress had the flavor of farewell .
Although perhaps, he would have preferred not to.
"It was obvious actually." Ginny said as she stroked his uncombable hair. Ron told me about what happened at Malfoy Manor, and to be honest, you've had a weird obsession with him since sixth grade. It was only a matter of time before you knew what you really wanted. The calm with which she - who was supposed to be her love - told him that the unresolved sexual tension she had for another person was evident, surprised him.
-I miss you.
And even when they were fined for a lot of money and real estate seized by the Ministry, the Malfoy family did not fall into financial ruin; her parents wanted to start a new life in France, and as soon as they finished signing the necessary documents, they packed a few things that they considered essential and left - leaving one of the vaults in Gringotts at their disposal. But he, somehow, wanted to start one from scratch for himself , a new stage where the ideals of his family were not the cornerstone of his philosophy of life, and that, instead, all that would mark a new path to travel. .
"How long would it take to repair it or make a new one?"
Okay then: grab the letter before anyone else and don't be such an idiot as to open it in front of the Dursleys; go to Diagon Alley the next day and visit the bank, answer the letter, get his school supplies along with the trunk, the uniform ... Damn, he had to get himself some clothes, he was n't going to spend another five years with clothes twice as many. its size. He had to talk to the goblins about the change from galleon to pounds. If you remember correctly, a galleon was equal to seven pounds? Well, you have a lot of questions and you really hope you have all the answers. If you're lucky, your experience negotiating with Griphook will do the trick, although I wish you could speak to anyone but Griphook.
"Why do you smell like that?" He really wanted to not sound so gross, but if something characterized him as a Gryffindor, it was saying or doing things before thinking about them.
"Ha, again Weasley…" The sorting hat was silent for a brief moment, "didn't he put you in Gryffindor 8 years ago?"
Harry's tiredness and anger demanded that he leave that place, but his Gryffindor sense — in addition to the streak of self-destructive instincts — forced him to turn around to face the other. Sure, it was him, the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead was very obvious, and he had the same green eyes, but the other one in front of him, exuded all an energy so different from his; not because he was a member of the least loved Hogwarts household - the war and all the years past showed him that not all Gryffindors were noble and brave, and not all Slytherins were treacherous - but because of the tone in which he spoke , the posture when walking and that greedy smile that he showed proudly.
"And I'm not going to be friends with an idiot Gryffindor, thank you very much," Malfoy replied, taking on a more confident cauldron cake. He frowned, looking at Harry with growing distrust. What House do you think you will go to, Potter?
Chapter Text
Thank you all for continuing to read Dark Wishes! I am pleased to announce that we are in the final stretch, since we only have two more chapters and a small epilogue <3 And of course, I have in my heart all the favorites, kudos, reading lists and comments that have made this precious baby that I do with so much love.
I recognized it. She was smart and perhaps, she could entrust her last wish to him.
Did the universe turn upside down?
The sound of a doorknob turning alerted him and he ducked closer to the dark part of the pillar; only half of his face peeked out, seeing the great door open and from there, two people came out together.
They believed their lives were saved by a one-year-old baby, and afterward, they trusted a group of children with little or no training to win one of the most important wars in the Wizarding World . Yes, Harry definitely has some trouble with wizard stupidity.
Different dimensions?
"It is not your decision, Potter." Draco frowned, and he could see that, for the first time that day, he was upset. I am grateful that you have saved me on more than one occasion, but I am not indebted to you to sacrifice what I really want for you.
-That's impossible! Ron looked quite stunned. How could they want to offer you contracts so young?
"Slytherin started leading the party," Hermione continued explaining. The other Harry was too good, the thugs couldn't do anything to knock him down or even scare him. He scored 70 points on his own and they barely had less than 20 minutes.
Harry followed with the swaying of his hips, stopping at the point where he had noticed, he used to come with just a little pressure. He grabbed the base of Draco's penis, preventing him from freeing himself and only got groans in response. He pulled his member out of the alien body and with force, he turned to face Draco, who looked like a divinity fallen straight to hell, wrapped in a cloak of lust with his rosy cheeks and heavy breathing.
What next, a Draco Hufflepuff?
So, you think you made good progress.
And honestly, it wasn't very nice.
"That's the sweetest thing you've said today," Hermione said, intertwining her hand with Ron's.
"And what do you get in return?" She asked suspiciously and he just smiled. A little nudge was missing.
His hands were so clenched into a fist that his knuckles were slowly turning white, and the veins on his neck stood out. To say that he was upset was not enough, for he had never felt such a sensation that made his body shake with excessive force, releasing waves of formless magic that shook everything around him.
He stretched out on his bed, and tried to get comfortable on the bed for the sixth time without success; he felt oblivious to everything. Perhaps because he was already so used to the presence of Harry Slytherin, that now, even though he didn't know what time he would arrive, he wanted to see him.
"Draco ... tell me ."
No, for the rest of the day, it was just him and Draco.
"I don't know, I don't remember Cedric in that world."
"I have a deal that, if things go according to my plan, it will work out for both of us," Harry said, smiling briefly and avoiding balancing on his feet.
-Help me. His voice was soft, but the despair he felt was reflected on his face.
"You seem to have been thinking about it for too long," her aunt said, and Harry looked at her innocently. When do you want me to take you, then?
Coming out of his thoughts, he moved closer to Mrs. Weasley, and mustering up all the shyness that he actually lost a few years ago, he smiled at the woman when their eyes met.
Tom didn't seem very convinced, but as he nodded and smiled, Harry didn't care about the credibility of his story.
Chapter 9 : Chapter VIII
At least for the simple fact of being identical to the Harry Potter of his world - except for the glasses and the hairstyle.
"A pleasure, really, but if they do that again, I'll jump off the moving train," he commented, grimacing. Fred and George nodded, apparently pleased with his answer.
Draco fell silent at the accusations… the blatant accusations . He refused to answer anything that would incriminate him more, and from Hermione's sigh, he knew this was about to end.
"Hi, sorry, but ... could you tell me how ... to get through?" Harry looked up at Ron and smiled at him, glad to receive a half smile in return.
He did not know how to answer.
He was not the Harry of that world.
"And you, Draco," Harry said, turning his gaze to him as he set Hermione on the floor. Without you, none of this would have been possible.
He felt despair. And now, with a clear mind, he understood that it was irresponsible to do such a thing. He did not know the consequences of interfering in other timelines — let's say that such trifles did not interest him at the time of creating the diary — and perhaps it was a mistake to wish someone else who was not from the same universe.
It was a detonation inside him. Something that completely collapsed the invisible barriers that he refused to cross.
Or that was until Harry's soft voice stopped him abruptly.
Harry saw Draco take his pajamas and go to the bathroom, after a couple of minutes, he got out and walked to his bed without seeing him for a single moment and saw him take cover, completely covering his body, even his head. He smiled, skillfully acknowledging that habit, for the Draco of his world used to do it too; He went back to the cloak that had just hung in the closet and took out a bag of fries that he threw on the bed of the other who, scared, only stood up on himself and frowned when he saw what was on him.
-But why? What exactly is blood supremacy? ”Harry ignored the Muggle-borns insult for the moment.
"Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," Malfoy looked surprised when Harry said his name, but he composed himself easily and held out his hand formally. He avoided rolling his eyes, responding to the greeting. When his hands released and Malfoy looked at him expecting something , Harry shifted uncomfortably on his feet. He looked at Ron, who was scowling at him, and thought ' to hell '. It has to start somewhere, right?
Despair tasted bitter; worse than polyjuice or the screech of a baby mandrake being ripped from your home.
Harry felt himself being watched from top to bottom. McGonagall's gaze scanned him so carefully, and he could almost feel the magic registering that there was nothing behind his intentions. And he couldn't blame her, after seeing her for the first time months ago, little by little she had stopped suspecting him.
But from that day on ... it all came down to just an exchange of greetings.
"Are you ready, Draco?" She finished putting on her forearm protectors and asked with a grin from ear to ear in the locker room.
The loss of a love.
"Who gives you the right to tell me what to do?" The other Harry put the handkerchief away again and his gaze, this time, was cold and his face abruptly turned serious.
I could see some students already active inside the castle. Many of them from the lower grades, holding on their faces big smiles that were greatly contrasted by the dark circles that carried those of more advanced years, of those who were by their side fighting Voldemort just almost a year ago.
He retraced his steps. He had decided to leave on Monday after saying goodbye to the few people he had a friendly relationship with, but it wasn't worth waiting for Draco to say "Goodbye." He did not need to relive again the agony he felt when the Draco of his world passed away in his arms with a goodbye.
He walked until he was in front of the journal that Harry left on the table; He remembered how recently he told him about the mechanism that the diary used, basically, you had to write details about where you wanted to go, but data like Hogwarts or other worlds were not enough, Harry used to write Draco's personality traits, followed by some variant high school like him in a different house or on his family in general to differentiate one world from another. Sure, everything was linear, he couldn't skip one paragraph from another.
"How noble of you." McGonagall smiled politely, then undid that smile to stare at him. Now, I want the real reason, Mr. Potter, if you really are Harry Potter. Do not force me to use the Veritaserum .
He had spent the entire afternoon celebrating with his housemates the victory over Gryffindor — something that hadn't happened in a long time — and crowning who has been the best Slytherin hunter in recent years; the Harry from the other dimension turned out to be a gem, impressing more than one with today's performance, scoring point after point with mastery. Although they already knew he was very good - the workouts with him were devastating, he always pushed them to the limit of endurance - he proved that he was the best Potter on the Quidditch pitch.
He squeezed his chest, trying to keep his heartbeat from sounding so strong, at least so he could ignore how wonderful it was to feel Harry's rough caresses.
-Then why? If you were victorious there, if everything in your world was fine ...
"Too elusive," he replied with a chuckle. Sometimes you hold yourself back too much. From the little I have talked to Pansy, Hermione or Blaise, you were very different before the war started; you were too Slytherin ...
-About what?
When many Slytherin students decided not to return to finish their studies, McGonagall decided that each of them could have their own room, or share it with a person if they did not want to be alone. Blaise snored a lot, and he couldn't share a room with Pansy since he was a woman; so Draco decided to have his own space, some rooms where he could feel calm if he wanted to cry in the middle of the night —because he will have a hard face all day, but there were times when he couldn't take it anymore and ended up frustrated in his bed—, or simply wake up reading in the calm of solitude.
"That ..." Ron cleared his throat, not meeting his eyes. Yes, that's a pretty high bar. Did you say car accident? What is that supposed to be?
But you just can't live without seeing his living eyes one more time.
Notes:
"Harry, you gave us quite a scare." Hermione pulled away from him a bit and smiled with relief in her voice.
He was sure, it was a matter of little time before Draco decided to be with him.
"I was born smart," Draco replied with that Slytherin smile that distinguished him.
Draco ran as fast as his ripped clothes allowed; the objective was his room, but he had to stop at one of the men's restrooms near the dungeons. He locked himself in one of the cubicles and sat on the floor; He tried to control his rampant breathing, and how not to do it after how the Harry of his world caressed him completely, leaving small bites and scratches on his legs, where his mouth had wandered freely without feeling in the least self-conscious.
Unable to lie to him anymore, before starting his final year at Hogwarts, he decided to be frank and tell her his concerns one night in the darkness of his room in Grimmauld Place; he was totally honest about how beautiful it was to be with her, because as time passed, he felt a black mist slowly bubble up inside him, quietly whispering a name and surname that he could not get out of his mind.
He tore a piece off a sheet and wrote a phrase on it — not even knowing if that was going to work — then tucked it into his robe pocket. Afterward, he took a scroll in front of him and wrote:
Harry blinked a little, but understood.
What would he do if Draco wasn't?
Well, at least now they did have reasons to deduct points; not that always, the house of Gryffindor received extra points awarded for excuses and very unlikely reasons.
-Understood. Enjoy your ride, Harry, ”she said, slowly approaching him and placing one of her bony hands on his shoulder. And I am so sorry that you did not find here what you were looking for.
Draco turned his face slightly, bit his lip and looked him in the eye again.
"I don't know, I think there are still bones to break," he commented with a rather serious face that he immediately broke with a smile.
Harry felt that all this was going wonderfully; things were too different from this world and hers. And in all that talk, he saw an advantage and a similarity: here, it was evident that the other he did not get along with Draco - for the simple fact that in that world he stayed in Gryffindor, not to mention the blond's bewildered face when he saw him in the Slytherin common room, quite obviously not expecting it; and the other more significant ...
"Even if you don't want to tell me, I think it's important that you talk about it." Not with me, but with Pansy or Blaise ... Pansy is better, I like her, she is funny and she gives me sweets in class.
- Force me ...
"Nothing?" Ron seemed completely disappointed, and he swallowed his desire to tell her that the situation that for the rest of the wizarding world was a matter of celebration, for him was easily the worst thing that could have happened to him. Ron was eleven years old, he reminded himself, and he had to be grateful that Ron couldn't really see the importance in that matter. After all, no child eleven or younger should see the importance of adult issues.
With each step Harry took, he left a crack in his previous footprint. For some reason, the windows were vibrating and the loose gravel was constantly shaking, making an incessant jingle that only made Harry's headache worse.
"Ah, don't worry, these are props, I have good vision," said Harry Slytherin, putting the old-fashioned round glasses in his cape pocket. And I'd rather be called just Harry, and the other one to be Potter, to avoid confusion.
"Draco?" Harry's husky voice was heard in the distance, almost like a low whisper behind a haze of desire. "What are you…?"
Therefore, seeing Draco from afar kiss the other Harry was worse than a cruciatus ; he experienced, again, one of the bitter tastes of life.
"How ironic magical life," he commented, looking out the window at the landscape. Blood supremacists call Muggle-born or half-blood Mudbloods, and when they least want to realize it, it's a half-breed along with his Muggle-born mother who destroy one of the most powerful wizards of his time. two other boys, and while Ron smiled a little at him, Malfoy looked uncomfortable. Harry was happy about that, actually. If Malfoy was uncomfortable with the truth, it's because he knew there was something wrong with blood supremacy, and he will use that little doubt to his advantage. I guess blood supremacists are nothing more than a bunch of adults scared of losing to new blood. By the way "Harry stared at Malfoy," never use the term 'Mudblood' in front of me. I don't care if you think that Muggles or Muggle-borns, or half-blood for that matter, are inferior to you; I'm a half-breed, my mother was a Muggle-born, and I know decent Muggles. I don't want you to insult them so lowly by calling them 'Mudblood' or any derogatory term. Please.
"He died in battle."
"And what am I supposed to gain?" Petunia still wasn't looking at him, but Harry knew she was already interested.
"Yes, from the beginning the sorting hat placed me in that house," Harry replied, smiling. And Draco couldn't have been of better help in dissuading me from belonging there.
-Well, dear?
Harry Potter's callused hand was masturbating him, touching such an intimate part, causing him a pleasure that he could not compare with any other; She would squeeze the base of his penis with the necessary force, and then she would caress the cleft of the glans, cleaning the pre-seminal liquid that came out due to the intensity of the caresses. And all of that, combined with Harry's warm tongue running down his neck ...
You no longer have anything.
And he had it there. So close…
While Lucius chose to be a double agent in order to safeguard his family, he continued to look down on Muggle-borns.
Harry, on the other hand, kept pacing back and forth, looking over the journal. He opened it, wrote things about it without mentioning a word with a conjured pen, and when he saw that there was a flash of light, he closed it immediately.
Perfectly old-fashioned glasses on the septum of his nose that covered unruly green eyes.
He decided to make a stop at the candy store, buying some flavored sweets and ice cream for that hot season that was slowly beginning; spring had come too fast, the endings would soon begin and Harry had every intention of never parting with Draco again. Afterwards, they continued walking to the grounds of the house of screams, stopping to look at the old construction that was seen in the distance.
Notes:
He was really surprised to wake up all those days with an erection in the morning - and ended up masturbating in the shower to alleviate the emotional and sexual load he felt -; sometimes in the afternoons, he felt his body shudder as he remembered the rising heat in his abdomen, as if it reached a boiling point, which only triggered when Harry Potter was present
"Didn't you have to go to McGonagall first thing in the morning?" Draco wanted to avoid as much as possible contact with this Harry. Too many things moved inside her to reveal the weakness she felt when he was close to her.
The price of his victory was the life of the only person he had learned to love unconditionally.
"... you should bring things ..." George continued.
Will he have to kill Quirrell with an unsuspecting Avada, and thus kill that piece of Voldemort's soul? And if he does that, then will it stop Voldemort from trying to search for a body with Pettigrew's help?
But the Harry of that world had to open his big mouth. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what it was that had Draco so confused at the moment — even when something similar had already happened a few weeks ago.
He knew he had to focus if he wanted to know the answer soon.
"Get rid of me for a whole year for the next seven years, and after I finish school, it will be for life." Harry cleared his throat and checked the time on the television news in the living room. I will have to return, in these seven years, for at least two weeks, but I will leave as soon as the deadline is met, and they will not even know that I am here. They will not hear from me at any time, and they will be able to tell the neighbors, if anyone asks, that they couldn't take any more with my horrible behavior and they took me to a reformatory.
"I'll give you twenty seconds to get out before I find you and throw a stabbing curse on your disgusting face," he whispered slowly before showing his wand to whoever was bothering him.
And he hadn't realized he was crying until he saw the tears fall on the elegant tailored suit his best friend was wearing. The black, dusty, wet and torn fabric that went with the social wardrobe of a funeral.
The three were silent when they finished recounting what happened that day. Harry took his hair and pulled it; He kept berating himself for all his faults, and trying to remember what happened when he tried to fight the other Harry. He seldom resorted to a bare-knuckle confrontation, at least not since he no longer attended classes in the Muggle world, and even did his best to avoid meeting his cousin and his friends - he knew he would be tempted to do so if he did. use his wand.
"It is very noble of you to worry about a matter that does not correspond to you," replied the other, taking a small green silk handkerchief from his pants pocket and caressing it tenderly and then kissing it.
Or so he wanted to believe.
Clarification, your preferences will not alter the order or the outcome that the story will have, because I am telling you, dear ones, that we are already halfway there and I have already written in a notebook until the epilogue. I hope to have time these days to write the remaining chapters and post them more frequently.
With Blaise things were different. Contrary to Pansy, he did not tell her details - it would kill him to tell her things about his sex life - he listened carefully to the brief story that he summarized and only received a short sermon from Blaise: «How confused of whom to choose ? It bothers me to admit it, but you have deep feelings for the Harry of Gryffindor since the Triwizard Tournament. Just do that and that's it ».
Chapter Text
There where his Draco had him as his best friend and his personality was vibrant and charming, the one he recently met carried a loneliness in his soul that he could feel, and it was a privilege to be there for him, to help him forget what ailed his heart .
"I didn't see a memory to see if what he was telling Draco and me was true," Hermione replied. But as things were today, I don't think it's entirely a lie.
He felt his body being shaken. They weren't smooth movements, and maybe they were far from kind… He clenched his jaw, willing not to let his impatience get the better of him this time at least. She continued with her eyes closed and her face buried in her pillow, preferring to smell the mold than face reality in that moment.
Harry repeated the whole process of passing wand to wand until he could have his own, and when he finally got it and felt twice as powerful as without it, Harry simply paid for the seven galleons to Ollivander and said goodbye as formally as he could, gladly ignoring words about Voldemort's twin or shit he already knew, thank you very much.
We read each other. Rice pudding kisses.
What if he was friends with someone like Hermione?
He knew that if he continued like this, he would end up plummeting toward an uncertain and dark destination for him. The feelings he has for Draco were taking him into a spiral of emotions that descended and rose madly.
Walking around the place, he almost knelt in gratitude when he saw a mail building with owls, close to the apothecary, and he hurried there to send confirmation of his presence at Hogwarts. He guessed he got something right, so Hagrid won't actually be looking for him, since Privet Drive hadn't been invaded by owls or thousands upon thousands of letters. Well, one less problem, there are nine hundred and ninety-nine to solve.
Chapter 2 : Chapter I
Harry wasn't good at thinking before he did, but he would be lying if he said he didn't put the effort into planning a casual, romantic outing with Draco putting his heart into it. It had the economic, social and magic power to take you on an unforgettable outing, transport you to the fragrant streets of Paris and dine at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, or it could take you for a walk to the Big Apple in Manhattan ... but instead, you chose to be himself, enjoying with Draco the little things that made him happy and giving him experiences that, he was almost certain, he had not experienced until now.
-You are having fun? He asked feeling a lump in his throat, nervous about the answer the other might give him.
"Draco, lend me your Potions notes." Pansy appeared in front of him in the library, which was the preferred refuge of the Slytherins - if they didn't want to be disturbed - as well as the Quidditch court when they had practice or a match - where they used to be the ones to poke their comments at others-.
If only it didn't contrast with the desolation he felt in his soul.
"Understood and noted," Harry replied after a few moments, and that emerald glow returned again. He walked to his closet and pulled out one of the Slytherin capes McGonagall had made for him the night before. Come on, get dressed. If we hurry, we can get to the third class.
-I just wanted to know how you were. It was a very hard fall, ”she answered quickly, ignoring the slight twinge in her stomach as she felt him close.
For an instant, Draco felt his heart race.
Chapter 7 : Chapter VI
He had won the bet in a matter of moments.
Harry remained close to him, and although he still had a smile on his face, the sparkle in his eyes completely faded, leaving in his wake an unusual and cold tranquility that had nothing to compare with the green eyes of his world. they glowed at every challenge, or even just eating Honeyducks candy.
Now that he thinks about it, he can actually take advantage of this, Harry realizes.
Dead, will you take me to the damn Alley already?
And although everyone said he had won, Harry felt life itself slipping from his fingers. The scene was warlike, Hogwarts was almost destroyed, the cold air blew between the foundations, running and freezing the lifeless bodies that were piled up in what was the great hall area.
Drastic measures had to be taken .
Draco Malfoy.
Soon he landed on the hard concrete; He smiled, grateful enough to still feel his entire arm — remembering what a boneless limb looked like is something he vowed never to experience again. He rose in one piece, admiring the dawn that was slowly gaining ground in the morning darkness and, in front of him, the untamed Hogwarts building in the middle; He could barely make out the differences between the building from the last castle to this one he saw in front of his eyes.
A Harry Potter in Slytherin?
"Why should I care about anything about you, remember me?" Petunia raised an eyebrow and went back to her work, ignoring him.
A cynical smile, worthy of a member of the Salazar household.
He sighed and continued cooking chicken and potatoes for his uncles, appreciating the chores he once hated when he was (was, is?) A child. Despite being back in his ten-year-old body, Harry felt his magic running through his veins, with all the strength he had since ... before he died, basically. He was sure he was in full control of her, and that there wouldn't be any kind of explosion at any slightest provocation, but whatever accidental magic he didn't let out was piling up and making his skin itch uncomfortably.
—They had a very important business trip in the United States, and none of us three knew this letter would actually arrive, so they could only wish me the best of luck and send me to one of our neighbors who, in reality, cannot See the place, so I went in alone. ”Harry shrugged and then looked around with a little fear. Dad told me to find a place here to stay until classes start because they won't be able to be there, so ... I wanted to know if you know of any place, and how to get to the alley, maybe?
-Whatever. Draco just nodded reluctantly and sat on his bed and pressed the bridge of his nose; everything that happened that day was too much. He just wanted to go to sleep and make that headache go away.
"Ron's right, Hermione," Harry said resignedly. I had to be focused on catching the snitch, and instead, I was guarding a position that does not belong to me.
-You are not me!
"After such a long time, I have to confess something," Harry said, bringing a sugar gum to his mouth.
Chapter Text
You get obsessed.
"How long did you last in each of the universes where you were?" Draco lay down on his bed, being as comfortable as possible.
Starting the Hogwarts grounds, Harry stopped and Draco only stopped a couple of steps later, perhaps not feeling him walk behind him. Her heart beat rapidly, and the anxiety in her body increased her breathing; Like a hurricane about to make landfall in a storm
Oh, Harry was on Privet Drive, in his closet under the stairs, and staring at his body for a few seconds, possibly nine or ten years old.
"Potter sucks," he whispered, just loud enough that whatever he heard him let him in.
You decide.
He stretched his arms up, feeling the muscles in his back relax little by little after hours of being in the same position. Hermione did something similar, snapping her fingers one by one and breaking the stiffness in her tired legs from the time they spent sitting.
His heart raced.
"Because I know about my parents, about that world, and about the war that killed your sister." Harry internally rejoiced when Petunia froze at his words. I don't care that you lied to me and hated me for something I couldn't even control, but I need your help for… ” first time , she wanted to say, but quickly corrected herself“… one last time: I need you to take me to Charing. Cross so that I can enter, uhm, that world and thus begin my education. I don't need money from you, the school provides everything, or that's what the letter I received this morning says and I 'm not going to give it to you; In case it is not so, I will handle it myself. But I just need that last favor.
Possibly one of the most trusted adults he has so far is Severus Snape.
They managed to reach a truce when Draco tripped over a tree root and decided to wait to dry for a while, resuming his route back to the village. Draco started to tell him about how difficult it was to redo the Harry Slytherin diary, and although he showed a disgusted face, he didn't have enough courage to stop him from talking about his alter ego. Sneakingly, he suggested eating and drinking a beer in the little tavern with the dripping cauldron; remodeled after the war, it became an attractive place of entertainment for the young population who used to visit the small town.
Draco was beginning to believe in that strange Murphy's Law he read in Muggle books in the library. Or, rather, confirm that he was irony embodied in person.
She saw him smile for a few moments.
Chapter Text
"I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings, partner ." He was back to that mischievous and carefree personality again. I thought Draco in this universe was your friend , you know, like in my world. And since I am you, I did not think it would affect you to share a little ...
"I must have known, you nearly scared me to death!" Draco claimed holding his wand in front of him and deflated his cheeks. I thought it was one of my ancestors upset with me!
One of the idiots who had one of the horcruxes.
"If it's about being with Draco Malfoy, wouldn't it be easier for one with an easier personality?" Draco asked, almost in a whisper, as if afraid of the answer he would get. Like that Draco Hufflepuff you met before you got here, he was seen to be nicer, or fool, than I am.
"Does it matter?" Harry shrugged at the look he received. I mean, my parents were in Gryffindor, right? I suppose I will also go there, although I would not mind staying in any other.
He felt an electric shock on his back.
As much as he tried to concentrate, he had to reread the previous paragraph because he had not understood anything and despair took hold of him step by step. He really wanted to forget everything that had happened in his life lately and just wanted to study peacefully for his exams and finish that school year with the best grades.
What if it was someone special to Harry Potter?
Think of a still large family , of parents who still remember their daughter, of a boy happy to win an innocent tournament, of an innocent prisoner in Azkaban, of many children who grow up surviving in a war that does not even belong to them, of directors whose Well older is more important than hundreds of children and, no. Harry can't just turn his back on them to have a better life for himself, while knowing that thousands more are slowly but surely destroyed.
He knew that his return to school would mean that now the victim would be him. Although he did not care, one way or another, he would access everything that others wanted to express about him. He deserved it.
Harry never tired of kissing Draco, of glorifying his name with a monument to desire that was unleashed every time his lips brushed Draco's skin, no matter how smooth it was as the silk of his back, or demonstrating the work and effort of the calluses of his hands. Harry could love all those facets that had enchanted him throughout his stay in the universe from which the wonderful being came that was unraveled in his hands.
Until Draco spoke again.
When Harry finished and turned his attention back to Ron, he smiled sheepishly, completely embarrassed by his slight loss of control. Ron had pressed his back against the back of his seat and was staring at him with wide eyes, clearly uncomfortable and not knowing what to say.
But that would be history for another time and universe. For the moment, he would enjoy tearing this Gryffindor apart, and he smiled knowing how much he would enjoy seeing his face change with despair and agony at impending defeat.
And although he had in mind that the other Harry was with him most of the time - a minor jealousy inconvenience that he managed to overcome when he had a sexual encounter with Draco - he always tried to be neutral with himself. For the first time, he would try to listen to his reason.
Harry wasn't so convinced he's a Gryffindor by now. Right now, he lacked being sincere, and lacking the courage to face even those who were his friends and who were supposed to love him unconditionally.
He released all the air that was contained. Soon, he felt the heaviness come to his body again; he felt tired. He didn't want to admit it, but she was right. It was necessary for her to clarify her feelings.
Eventually, they began to talk about the different realities that existed, Draco was the one who asked the questions, and he dedicated himself to answering all the doubts he had and made jokes about the alternate versions of themselves, especially those that were in some other House other than Slytherin - no one could judge them for it, it was very funny to imagine with the personality of someone in the Hufflepuff house -.
"Draco…" Harry was silent for a few moments that brought him back to reality. Then she heard him take a deep breath and continue— Is there something bothering you lately?
With a speed worthy of a Quidditch hunter, Harry got up from the table, leaving his plate half eaten and ran out of the room and a desperation that he could not understand rose in him, where did he begin to look for him? He didn't have many options, but all the places were so far apart that he became desperate.
At least that was until recently. When in Defense Against the Dark Arts class, his eyes literally met the emerald irises of his Slytherin counterpart and he saw in them a streak of evil, and then a provocative smile on his face; soon, his gaze traveled to the other Harry's hands, who rested them on Draco's thigh ...
The vigor with which he penetrated another's body transported him to a mystical place, losing himself between the pleasure he felt running down his spine to the sweet sensation that settled in his pelvis, slowly accumulating those exciting sensations.
And at the same time, so different.
"Hello, Potter," he said casually, but kept his distance even with the surprise of hearing him say his first name. I see that you are better.
Without thinking, he told Hermione and Ron at breakfast the next day about the note Draco sent him, Saturday's date at Hogsmade and how this was an opportunity he was waiting for, how it was a godsend. Quite contrary to what he thought would happen, Ron looked conflicted, but he told him that he supported him in everything he decided, and even encouraged him to confess his feelings again; instead Hermione, her a gentle look, almost melancholic and only with a small smile on her lips that indicated a remote happiness in her.
"But Harry," Ron looked at him in alarm, "Slytherin is the house that You-Know-Who was in, and besides, everyone there was Death Eater." It's the house of evil. ”Malfoy scowled at her last statement, but said nothing, seemingly unable to disprove that.
"Do you need something, Potter? Draco spoke to her, interrupting her mental musings.
Chapter 11 : Chapter X
-I agree. And with the answer, Harry Potter, Gryffindor Patron Saint, flew off.
Regret never hit Harry so hard as it did at that very moment. In truth, he was complaining that he was nobody's hero, but then he goes and tries to help anyone on his way. And Draco damn Malfoy was one of those. Awesome, give Harry an award for being the most selflessly stupid person in the world.
He pinched the bridge of his nose, pushing to clear away the irrational ideas cascading through his mind.
"Well ..." the redhead put Pettigrew back in his jacket, and Harry didn't know whether to thank him or warn him without sounding insane, so he just fell silent as he searched for a topic of conversation, although Ron easily helped him when he returned. to speak-. Don't worry about that, I also have a bad memory with animals, but in my case, it's with spiders. ”Ron visibly shuddered and Harry smiled at him in understanding. They're horrible, insects that shouldn't exist, trust me. ”When Harry didn't say anything else, Ron cleared his throat. So where have you lived and all that? Do you have a magical tutor? What did you say your last name was?
A dream.
In three days it would be his birthday, and all Harry cared about was trying to grab the Hogwarts letter without his relatives noticing. It wasn't that it was an impossible task, but life (previous ...?) Taught him that it was better to be safe than sorry. And if Harry was making carefully thought out plans for all the scenarios to come, well, he's damn cautious.
And just as Ollivanders' eyes fell on his forehead, on his still covered scar, Harry decided to step back and speak.
-But you…
He wanted to interrupt them in that instant, separate them, claim Draco as his own and take him away from that place, that world… that Harry.
Draco turned his back on him right away from saying that and he couldn't answer anything to all that. He couldn't say that it hadn't hurt him in a certain way, because somehow, he was trying hard to please Draco, to have a little of the attention that he had devoted so much to him in previous years.
He had already turned around to leave, it was best to control himself at that moment before committing something stupid.
Harry released the air that was in his chest. He felt a slight reassurance after that, it wasn't because something happened between them; They had only been together for almost three weeks, it wasn't for things to move that fast. And the little mental stability that he had achieved, he went overboard when he quickly thought that he had to do something, because both Slytherins shared everything together, that was the first time in days that he had seen Draco really alone.
"You're lucky, there are some rooms upstairs I can offer you." Did your parents give you money?
"About ten o'clock." Harry kept stuffing things into a small portfolio he had for his classes, but he kept looking at it.
"How cruel," Harry said, and although he did an act of drama by bringing his right hand to his heart, he kept smiling. Anyway, this will keep us together for a long time and that's enough for me.
Draco saw how Harry's green eyes, without the glasses, were brighter than usual; the emerald created harmony with the shape of her eyes and cheeks that slowly began to turn pink. Although he did not know if because of the shame of his words or because of the embarrassment he felt too.
And that frustrated him too much.
Was there anything better than the raw love they professed at that time?
Draco smelled of a different cologne. It wasn't the usual peppermint scent that I loved to inhale as I passed him… it was an intrusive, repulsive smell, because it knew perfectly who it belonged to.
Notes:
"It is not the house of evil, as such." Who-you-know was there? Yes. Did he do it because he was exclusively evil? No. As I understand it, they place you in one House or another depending on which characteristics are best suited to you, ”he said calmly, catching a chocolate frog in his jump. You are brave? Gryffindor. Are you loyal? Hufflepuff. Are you smarter than average? Ravenclaw. Are you ambitious? Slytherin. I am sure that the Houses of a school of magic do not define good and evil. From my own experience, I could say that good and evil within a person are formed according to their life experiences and perception of the world. So, "he chewed on the chocolate frog's head before speaking again," no. I don't care which house it stays in. I know my parents will be proud of me in any case, as long as I focus on passing subjects. And if they're not proud of me for staying in a house other than Gryffindor, "he shrugged," it's not that I really change anything in me. I mean, they are dead .
Notes:
Thank you all very much for reading, the favorites, kudos, love of fic ... I adore you.
And yet, he knew what was coming after the moment he crossed his arms right over his chest.
He almost took the bait.
"See you in the room."
Harry knew that would happen.
"How can I help you, little one?" Tom frowned as he looked behind Harry. "Where are your parents?" Are you lost?
A desire to possess was not born in him ...
And that was him.
When he finished saying that, Hermione got up from her place and went to put the books on the shelf, getting lost in the corridors of the library.
Harry recognized it, it was from Draco.
Who was the Harry Gry expected to turn out like this? Slowly, his Slytherin nature was revealed, the one that does not care about anything ... and that is the result.
And with all that, it didn't matter much if, thanks to it, she got to know him.
Notes:
And the strange attraction she felt for him.
"Harry needs to rest," Hermione said calmly. Today he had the courage to tell us his secret ... although I think, you and I already knew it.
Draco, this Draco, was almost the same as his world.
Chapter 4 : Chapter III
For an instant, everyone shuddered at the harshness with which the Slytherin Harry spoke. He was selfish, and although he did it so that Muggles would not find out about his world, it was very irresponsible in the first place to request his help to create such an artifact, because although it was not entirely wrong to use it - because it was the first of its kind, unless it was known — it led to the use of very ancient magic, difficult to classify whether it was forbidden or not.
"I'm Harry, Draco." Harry pursed his lips, almost making the smile fade. Potter is the other .
And Draco ran out of there, leaving Harry with the proposal in his mouth and his hand on his heart. He ran until he collapsed near the dungeons, he wanted to calm down a bit before entering the common room, he did not want to risk someone seeing him in that state and starting to pressure him to say what happened.
The next update is the last one; final chapter plus epilogue.
Even with Draco they had a strange ritual, because in the month of October, just after entering the school year, he and his best friend had a habit of playing hide and seek, trying to hide from each other, but always trying to find the other. Was there a winner? No, they were doing it just for fun.
And he had the misfortune to meet Harry Potter who, physically, was similar to him, but they were so different at the same time.
Draco stood in front of the stone that gave access to his house, smiled a little and recited the temporary key.
Do not hate him please, it is that he is small and he barely gets twenty of many things. Thank you all for your comments, favorites, kudos, thoughts ... I am very happy that people from other countries read what I write, and when people read it whose mother tongue is not Spanish, well, it is a sugar bomb straight to my heart.
"That's ... amazing." Actually, surprising was that Harry had never thought that there was actually a will from his parents that had to be read. He shook his head and cleared his throat. Actually, right now I just wanted some basic answers about switching from pounds to galleons, what if it was possible that I had my key myself, rather than someone else? From what I know, my guardians are not magical, so only I should have access to it, right?
Draco was surprised to discover that Riven was not nearly as courteous and cultured as he seemed. Beneath his pretty words lay an extensive and well-worshipped vocabulary of the most crass curses Draco had ever had the pleasure of hearing. It had taken several slip-ups, but when Draco made it clear there would be no judgment between them, Riven relaxed and let his tongue run wild. He said what he wanted about who he wanted in whatever way he pleased, and Draco struggled to keep his amusement under wraps. This Riven was coin flip from the composed, serious prince he first met at the market and outside his house. It was refreshing, reminding him a lot of Blaise. It also reminded him of another dark haired friend, but Draco would banish those thoughts every time they crept up on him.
“You really do like them prickly, mate,” he wheezed.
They stand there in silence that is most definitely getting more awkward by the minute, Harry with his bags and his mask hanging off one ear, and Hot Neighbor with his fingers tucked into his long sleeves as he fidgets uncomfortably.
Draco’s life became a blur, days swimming from one to the next. He was invited to live out the days before the wedding on royal grounds and his parents had him packed and in a carriage before Draco could center himself enough to graciously refuse. The castle was airy and lavishly decorated, a veritable sea of marble and filigree, nothing like the dreary dungeon Riven had described. Draco’s rooms were equally beautiful, with large windows and dark wooden furniture, the carpets deep enough to sink one’s toes in.
“What are your own thoughts on marriage?” The ring went flying across the ground as Draco jumped.
Draco’s soft laugh was muffled as he pressed closer to Harry’s side. That’s one thing he hadn’t been prepared for when he finally extended a new offer of friendship to Draco— how tactile he was. In the hallways and classrooms Draco rarely even shook hands with his classmates, but in the privacy of the common room he might as well have used Harry and Pansy instead of chairs or a couch. Even Ron had gotten the startling treatment of having Draco fall asleep on his shoulder— he stayed so tense the entire time he’d ended up having to go to Pomfrey for soreness, and no one had let him live it down.
But they could be more. There was no excuse for how fast his heart was beating.
“I don't want you to be,” Draco whispered, and the resulting rush of happiness was so unexpected it made Harry giddy.
“Slag,” Draco snorted. “That’s just gossip.”
Ron seemed to understand, regardless of the words left unsaid. He grinned at Harry and toasted with his eggnog. “To you and Malfoy.”
Draco dropped his gaze, running his fingers over the edge of his seat.
“You’re— you’re on the page too?”
Malfoy looks thunderous, and maybe a bit hurt, which Harry really doesn’t understand. It’s not like
“I don’t subscribe to superstition,” Riven said. He crossed the room in long strides, jaw set and eyes burning. Draco tightened his white-knuckled grip on the seat when Riven stood only a few feet away. “Draco, what’s the matter?”
“If you don’t kiss me right now I’m changing that to a no—“
“I’m going to need help,” Harry finally decided miserably. “Not from you, though.”
“I can’t help it!” Harry groaned. “He’s—he’s always here, and he’s just—look at him, Ron, he’s everything!” Harry sank a little lower in his chair. “He’s never even looked at me.”
“I can think of some better things for us to do,” Draco murmured slyly. “Can’t you?”
Draco himself tried to forget the incident. He was busy for once the next couple of days so it was easy enough. He also had darker worries on his mind— worries that had disappeared, and therein lay his problem.
“Will you marry me?” Harry’s eyes had never been more serious, even if he was laughing. “I’m in love with you. I know I’m bad at saying it, and that probably will never change, but I promise to keep trying. As nothing more than who I am, here and now, will you marry me?”
“Mm, sleep well?” Draco asks in the morning, squinty-eyed and bright-cheeked.
For the first time in a while, Harry felt steady. He had a solid plan.
He does.
“Truth,” Draco finally said. He was wrapped in a blanket on the floor between Hermione and Blaise, his hair mussed up at the nape of his neck.
“Just do it, wanker.” But Potter smiled as he said it, and so Draco did. He closed his eyes and thought about the past, and then he thought about the future, and then he breathed in and blew out the small flame.
“Don’t worry, Malfoy,” Cho calls again. “He’s been wetting himself over you for years, he’s bound to say yes.”
“Yes,” Draco blurts out readily. “Very.”
Hurt flashed in Malfoy’s grey eyes. He looked down at his hands, pale fingers thin and stark in the dim light. “If you hadn’t thought I’d changed, why did you invite me out for drinks?” he asked in a quiet voice.
Well then. Harry certainly thinks he’d rather avoid that. “Er, how many currants do I owe you?”
He throws them both a saucy wink and leaves with all the smugness of a man who’s done his yearly good deed. Harry’s going to murder him before the day is done.
That is, until he realizes he actually
It had almost been a month since he’d seen Harry.
“—it’s fucking nerve wracking.”
“Your half birthday,” Potter repeated. “I figured you didn’t get much of a real birthday this year, so I thought maybe this would do. I’m sorry it’s six months late, but Hermione got wind of our hunt for Time Turners so this was the next best option.”
“The necklace was for you?” Draco sat up straight. “What do you mean, it limits your life?! Harry, there’s a cure right? There must be a cure, it’s only magic—“
Harry’s aware his mouth may be open.
“That’s not why he left, Draco.” Riven cut him off.
A button clinked sadly to the floor. Harry buried his head in his hands.
Draco waved as the prince rode around the curve in the road.
is brilliant. They part and come back again, and Harry sips at Draco’s mouth like there’s nothing he’d rather taste, and Draco can’t stop shivering.
“There have been rumors about the queen taking visits here during the festival,” Blaise said. “They say she likes to travel alone.”
For the next hour Draco proceeded to turn discomfort into an art form. He wondered at how long his mother had waited to call him down, as the polite conversation between her and Riven spoke of easy familiarity. He was invested without seeming overbearing, and amusing in a restrained manner. Draco dreaded the moment he would be alone to fend off questions.
“I can’t—the sleeves are too tight—fuck, Malfoy, it’s going to eat me!” he yelled shrilly.
Draco feels frozen, hot and cold all over, and stiff as a board.
. Certainly not the casual indifference Draco greeted every coworker with each morning. Even a rejection would have been better.
Ron was wrong about one thing. It was Harry’s fault.
and that’s not something unique to Harry’s observations. There’s not a witch or wizard alive who wouldn’t notice that head of bubblegum bobbing between the Auror cubicles.
Down the table, Pansy was chattering to Theo— and subsequently the rest of the Hall— about the perfume her parents had sent her for her birthday last week, and how it wasn’t the one she’d
“No, I couldn’t,” he replied. “You’d be left in just that ratty shirt then.”
“Oh, well, I’m sure you know now,” the other boy shrugged. “I mean, you probably went everywhere else before coming here, and the library was closed, yeah?”
“My given name is Riven,” Harry answered instantly. “Harry is a nickname. My mother wanted to name me Harold. It’s what people close to me call me. Harry Potter is an alias.”
He stepped closer, intending to hand Draco the cup across the counter separating them. But to his utter dismay, the wet plastic chose that exact moment to slip from his fingers.
yesterday—you erased half of my report!”
That’s the most simple, and yet the most romantic thing Draco’s ever had said to him.
Riven hadn’t visited for a week, but he was meant to come by that night, and Draco couldn’t wait. His friend had been uncharacteristically quiet recently, and he’d acted strangely on their last meeting, avoiding many of Draco’s questions and trailing off mid-sentence. Draco had caught him stumbling after getting off his horse, and he refused long walks out across the meadows now. Something was amiss and Draco was worried, but for now he wasn’t sure how his nagging might be received.
“I don’t understand,” Draco shook his head.
Draco was sorting through tea orders in the storage room. He was always sorting through tea orders. When Starbucks closed, he’d made the split-second decision to buy the now empty space, and Harry had made the slightly less split-second decision to invest in Draco’s dream. Seven months later and the new cafe was doing better than they could have ever hoped. Draco often worked long hours, but when he came home smelling like coffee beans and Earl Grey with a satisfied smile, Harry found he didn't mind.
husband thought to bring me some every once in a while.”
“A painful one.”
Come Monday morning, however, Harry was a mess of nerves. He could hardly eat breakfast, unable to focus on anything but the thought of the letter he’d foolishly left in Draco’s cloak pocket. What if it had fallen out? Worse, what if he had
“I may have been thinking I was sitting on the page alone.” Draco admits.
But Riven wasn’t. Riven who would bring him wildflowers and stop by for dinner. Riven was real, and Riven wanted him. Harder yet was to admit that he certainly wasn’t indifferent to Riven. Even if Harry were to be conjured up on his doorstep with uncharacteristic words of adoration, Draco felt dirt at the thought of that love, a love that was tainted by feelings for someone else.
Draco hummed in agreement. Under Riven’s unexpected honesty and prompting glance, he elaborated. “I always felt more at peace in the meadows than in the town. The flowers are wonderful this time of year.”
At that moment Harry wonders if he’s been hit by a particularly strong Confundus. He frowns and leans on the desk to leaf through the magazine, but— no, the article is definitely still there in all of its sleazy glory. He looks up at Malfoy. Looks down at the article. Shoves it across the desk.
The man’s lips shift around into something resembling amusement, but Harry’s having trouble not staring at them, which in turn makes reading his expression difficult. “Are you going out to brave the masses?” He repeats.
“Still an Auror, Potter?” he asked, joining Harry as they started back towards the Consultancy Department.
The gardens are lit by floating fairies. It makes a pretty picture, the flowers and trees glowing with spots of pink and green and blue. They laugh at him from the shrubbery, and Draco partially agrees with them. He certainly is a spectacle—in love with his ex-nemesis, bonded to a wizard who’s probably snogging another woman right about now. The thought itself doesn’t anger the bond-magic, but that barely makes a difference, the pain in his chest is so strong.
Just as he rounded a corner, however, a bushy head of hair nearly knocked him over.
“Alright.” Six is great, six is perfect. Harry waves with a smile and finally closes his door. Draco’s heart is beating a mile a minute and he thinks he may just throw up on Pea, but he hasn’t been this excited in weeks. This is definitely the opposite of social distancing but at this point they’ve shared all their germs over Pea and he really doesn’t give a fuck.
The ingredients were kept isolated and meticulously sorted, however, and Draco himself kept clean by way of a self-scourgifying apron, glimpses of which sustained Harry for months at a time. He had dreams about pulling Draco in by the pockets on the front, tucking his steam-damp hair behind his ears and kissing his nose.
“Dennis Creevey?” Harry yelped, sitting up quickly. “He’s a bloody intern! What gives him the right to make a pass at Draco?”
They’d lost too much, but perhaps they’d won enough.
“You’d think I was your pet pig, not your son.” He’d meant to mutter it, but by the amused twitch of Riven’s lips perhaps he hadn’t been quite subtle enough,
“I’m sorry, go ahead.” Harry nods at him in a way he hopes is friendly and not angry and/or belying the intense appreciation he has for the way the bloke’s hair falls in soft blond whisps into his grey eyes.
Ron found him sulking this way half an hour later. He stopped at the edge of their desk, eyed Harry’s forlorn gaze (and its unsuspecting target), and sat on the edge of his chair very hesitantly. Harry thought he looked a bit like a hare about to bolt.
“Y-your highness,” Draco stuttered, immediately attempting a bow, but struggling with the load in his arms.
“Oh, no need.” She winked again. Harry wondered vaguely if she had something in her eye. “I have just the thing.”
Harry shrugged, picking up his book and hefting it a little higher above his face. The position wasn’t exactly comfortable, but the story was just picking up and he didn’t feel like moving.
“Harry,” Draco’s return smile was as blinding as it was the first day they met. He twisted up to brush his lips against Harry’s in a brief hello. “How is it out there?”
“Five minutes,” he pleaded. Harry coughed guiltily. “Five bloody minutes of peace. I’m begging you, mate.”
He drifted through classes until dinner, when he turned away from the stream of students to head for the library. The Eighth Years were granted an extended curfew, and he planned to use that time to study. End-of-term exams were canceled for all NEWT students, but Draco needed top marks if he wanted— well, anything really. If he wanted anything.
Draco nodded, already thinking. “It’s always the not-quite-curses, isn’t it?”
“Hello,” a soft voice spoke. “Is this Narcissa Malfoy’s stall?”
His expression grew indecipherable, and Harry could not tell whether it was hope or trepidation he was seeing on Draco’s face. He hesitated, finally at the moment he’d worked so hard for, yet too nervous to speak.
“That would be the same rights that let you smash your specs on his pointy chin,” Ron said.
“Here!” he says quickly. “Here’re your currants, Draco. I’m terribly sorry, it was entirely my mistake.”
“You’re serious.”
When Draco rounded the top of the stairs, however, his lungs burning lightly from the climb, he almost turned right around and left the way he’d come. Sitting on the open edge of the tower, legs hanging over the drop and tangled hair blowing in the breeze, was—
“You’ve bought me roses, Harry,” Draco said softly. “I do think you should at least kiss me.”
“It’s the definition of my business!” Harry says vehemently. “You— you printed magishopped photos of us sucking face!” That’s really the only way to put it— there absolutely was tongue (Harry’s still not sure whose).
He stared at the words after he was finished—the hints of ink he’d vanished to reform a phrase or two, the curve of the lettering. It was truthful, but it felt like it was lacking something. A sentence, a certain life, Harry didn’t know. But he wanted to give it to Draco—he wanted an answer, he wanted to be clear.
“I bet you drink that grape juice they sell in Tesco, that’s why.”
Draco chose that moment to laugh at something Cho said, and Harry’s heart flipped in his chest. No, a rejection certainly would not have been better.
Draco watched bemused as the noble swung down from his horse with a practiced grace. He frowned as Riven came to stand at the foot of the steps to their door. Then he did something Draco would swear for several days he had dreamt up. He pulled a small bunch of yellow flowers from his cloak and held them up to the shocked blond.
“It’s action, Hermione,” Harry snapped. He could almost hear her shrug.
But when Harry pulled himself together and finally made his way into the office, the sight that greeted him was—ordinary.
“Oh. Then, no, not really.”
In Harry’s opinion, that was the best part. It made Draco look soft and huggable—two words no one had ever used to describe a Malfoy. Harry wanted to wrap him in blankets, sit him on his couch, and watch him open presents. Presents Harry had gotten him, preferably.
“Start?” Harry said, unwilling to leave things to hope.
“Please don’t be angry,” Harry said quickly, managing to catch Draco’s hand before he pulled away. “Draco, just listen.” When Draco just sat frozen, Harry took it as his cue to continue. “I’m James and Lily’s son, but I am also who you know me as. I’ve never lied to you. I have... difficulty, socializing with the court. I hate being confined to this castle. A year ago, it became too much for me. I went away for awhile— took torn clothing, spare change, just the bare things. I found Charlie, and he offered me a place to stay. It was easy to pass as a traveler settling down in Godric's Hollow. I didn’t expect to get close to anyone. I certainly didn’t expect to meet you.”
“Being an idiot,” Hermione supplied.
“No, she swears they—“
“Picking currants.”
“Did you need something, Potter?” Draco asked suddenly. He dropped a rounded stone into the blue potion and gave a quick swirl with his glass rod. “I’m a bit busy at the moment. They need this analysis done in an hour, and the potassium only just arrived.”
Draco ruined three circlets that day.
Harry gaped at the cauldron. At his own hand. “Coffee,” he mumbled, utterly humiliated.
They regard one another for a couple seconds, coming to the same quick decision. Harry takes the few steps separating them, and now Draco can smell the tang of sweat and aftershave, and he has to consciously stop himself from licking his lips. Harry takes another step, closer than strictly necessary for cat transferral, but this offers Draco the chance to see that his eyes are actually brilliant green and not the blue he’d once thought. They’re framed by thick, dark lashes under wire-rimmed glasses.
Slightly perturbed by the lack of any change in their usual routine, Harry continued on to his and Ron’s corner. He frowned as he sat, eyeing the back of Draco’s head in confusion. He’d expected—well,
Draco is grateful that that’s the moment Pansy gets them out of the ballroom and into the gardens, because he feels like he might sob, and the breath of night air is the only thing that keeps him together.
“How would I know? He’s probably going down to Creatures. He’s the Potions Consultant on a Werewolf case, Harry, where do you
that!” Draco knew he was sputtering. “That’s simply not
It seemed only natural to replace his finger with his lips then. Draco’s mouth was warm, and Harry thought he’d never felt anything softer. Draco pressed a cold hand to his cheek, and Harry found he even liked that too.
With new determination, he made for the next— or third— best option. While the common room wasn’t ideal, at least he knew no unfortunate magical accident would have rendered it inaccessible.
“Oh, fuck off.”
Every second he thought he had been jaded, left, rejected, Harry had been there toying with him.
“What on earth are you giggling about?” Harry murmurs onto his lips.
“Yes, obviously. It’s quarantine, who doesn’t?” Sane people, that’s the answer. “Listen, what fruit do you have? Or— sorry, you probably don’t play AC, it’s kind of a childish game. Sorry.
“Have you not been debriefed on—”
Harry wondered if perhaps Draco was coming in tomorrow as well, and didn’t want to lose his place in whatever investigation he was heading.
The rush of his successful sale lasted Draco through that day and over into the next. He was still unpleasantly shaken, not to mention overwhelmed by the money. His parents had been so excited— Lucius— and proud— Narcissa— that his father had picked his mother up and swung her a full turn before pulling them both into a hug. However, even with the new earnings, Draco felt the stirrings of curiosity. What good was a healing gem to a queen with access to the most sophisticated medicines in the land?
“It’s your half birthday,” Potter shrugged.
“I don’t—”
“I’m sorry,” Draco winced. “My answer is the same. I can’t say that I know you after a single afternoon spent in your company.”
their machine of war. They’re both as terrifying as they are attractive (in Malfoy’s case at least; Harry’s not sure what the world sees in Parkinson apart from the devil herself, but Hermione seems to like her well enough). Harry’s seen the editor of the
“Where is she?” Draco muttered for the fifth time in the last minute.
“We can call it off,” Riven’s voice, for once, was chillingly emotionless. It was painful to hear. “There’s still time to step back, if we’re doing something we’ll regret later—“
“Natural talent.”
“Is there another prince squandered away that I don’t know about?” Draco said. He was feeling thrown in the familiar way he always did around Harry. His hands were sweating enough to dampen his polishing cloth.
“...yes?”
The pain passes in waves, each lessening slightly until the relief stays and Draco can straighten up.
There’s a shift in Malfoy’s stance, and his grey eyes skim over the lines of Harry’s body. “Parts of it,” he says. His tone is a little off. Husky.
what?”
,” Ron practically whooped, “and then you told him your dick was big? Fuck, Harry, how are you even standing? That’s brutal!”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. Pushed his glasses up his nose, then cleared his throat. Cleared it again for good measure, because something seemed to be lodged in it—it felt unnaturally tight.
And he certainly wasn’t far off, was he? He already loved Riven as a friend, how hard could it be to shift that love into something different? In fact, if it weren’t for Harry, he was certain he a would have already done so. He had some measure of feelings for Riven. They just couldn’t seem to stand against the rest of his heart.
“You can’t say that, you didn’t hear it. I might as well have told him I’d take a prince like you over him should the choice be offered.” Draco gritted his teeth. “I chased him away and I have no one to blame but myself, and I hate that I’m still hanging onto a memory like a maid, mourning something so
“The hottest, you say?”
wrong with me? Am I that awful? I know I was cruel to him, but he’d reply in kind and I didn’t realize I was— that he would leave—”
“I gathered. You did kiss me.”
“So what, you decided I was a game to play?” Draco spat, pulling his hand back quickly. “The poor, neglected prince on his desperate quest for amusement?”
“Truth,” Ron answered hesitantly.
He set a plate of jems aside to reach a carved wooden box and lifted it up to the queen, popping off the lid. Riven chose that moment to step closer and as he shifted Draco unintentionally breathed in the rich scent of his perfumed clothes. He hesitated before dipping gloved fingers in to lift a necklace from the box. As he twisted it, the chain caught the light and flashed blue-black.
“Who’re we talking about? Malfoy?” Savage asked as she wandered up behind them. Harry tried not to jump. She was small, but quiet and built like a brick shithouse. She also had the unpleasant habit of slapping coworkers on the back hard enough to crack a rib. He unconsciously shifted to face her.
“Actually,” Draco says as she stands, “you can get another drink if you’d like. I think I’d really—I’d like to just sit here a little.”
“So you’re trying to instigate? Rip the bandage off?” She nodded sagely. “Good on you, Weasley. He needs someone to talk to about it. Merlin knows it’s not going to be one of us.”
“I wanted to say it in person.”
“Yes, that. But let us know how it goes. We just want you to be happy, Harry.” Hermione said it with such a tender look that Harry forgot for a moment that this was the woman who’d once driven Kingsley Shacklebolt to tears over a legislative footnote.
He didn’t see Harry the next week either. Or the day following that. Draco distracted himself with household tasks, and when that proved ineffective he took to denial like a fish to water.
He’s not allowed to be so cute, dammit, or Draco’s going to the hospital for cardiac arrest.
“Yeah, I suppose.” Harry snorted, even though he was sure Draco didn’t intend for it to be funny. “But on the other hand, think about all the places they could take you now. You’ve knocked some of the worst ones out of the park, wouldn’t you say?”
Harry chose to stay quiet, because while that was indeed exactly what he wanted, he was not going to publicize it. Let them think what they wanted—it wasn’t like he was ever getting either option.
“Do you mean the hair, mate?”
The alternative, however, was terrifying. Ask Draco out. Draco Malfoy, who, despite his reputation, attracted suitors like flies to honey. Harry couldn’t fathom how Draco would ever see him as a competitor to, say, Richard in Legislation (who was built like a tree) or Timothy from the Obliviation Squad, who seemed to know every wine on earth by scent alone.
“You’re staring again.”
Harry felt his lips twitch at that. “I just remember a time when you wouldn’t think twice about homelessness and Muggles. It’s good to know things have changed.”
That is, until he caught sight of Draco coming down the hallway towards them. Hermione muttered something hopelessly, but by that point Harry was happy to leave her to her file.
“Thought I’d—wait forever for you to do that,” Draco breathed in between kisses. Harry didn’t have the presence of mind at the moment to reply to the unspoken insecurity, nor the patience to explain just how often he’d tried. But he backed Draco against the wall and grasped blindly for his hands, already spellbound by the feeling of him and determined to show his dedication in every gesture.
“I— the utter nerve!” Draco was almost vibrating in his arms, trembling from rage or some other emotion, Harry couldn’t tell. “I’m going to show you— I swear, I’ll tell you— You know what? Do you
except something like that. Harry wished once again that the doors really had eaten him.
“Hands he wants around his—”
As it is, he didn’t and he doesn’t. And that makes it all the more beautiful, too.
“Do you think…” Hermione bit her lip as she extracted herself from Pansy’s arms. “Malfoy, could we— could we see it?”
Draco felt freezing.
“You’re supposed to be going out tonight,” Harry said. “Weren’t you invited?”
Harry was too busy looking at the angel in front of him to care. His skin was so pale it almost glowed under the golden coffee-shop lighting, a rosy blush rising prettily to its surface. His hair fell in white-blonde swaths over his forehead, the strands drifting teasingly into his wide eyes and making Harry want to reach out and brush them back. Harry coughed once, then twisted his fingers together beneath the counter to quell the disturbing urge.
“Didn’t take you for a romantic,” Draco whispered conspiratorially against Harry’s jumper. “Shall I ask Pansy for a few recommendations for you?”
Silence finally falls around them in a deep hush. The ebbing and flowing of Draco’s breath whispers against the fabric of the sheets, and Harry sighs before nuzzling into his hair. His hand is already getting a bit sweaty where it’s held tight in Draco’s, but it keeps them close in the center of the bed, and Harry likes that. He closes his eyes.
“Potter?” Draco asked quietly. “What was in that?”
“Friends,” Draco let the word roll around in his mouth. “I’d like that too. Please stop by, I’m sure at the very least my mother will be ecstatic.”
“He likes that Muggle shop across the street,” Harry continued. “That one with a frappa-whatsits. The caramel ones.” Harry knew this because he’d watched Draco lick the whipped cream off a frappa-whatsit once a week for the past year.
“Here, sir,” Pansy said seriously. “The hottest thing we have. I'm sure you’ll want him to go, so here’s your receipt.” She waved the little piece of paper in front of Harry, and when he only stared she leaned across the counter with a sigh to shove it down his front pocket.
“Muggle book, adventure and vampires,” Harry said automatically, his eyes already back on the page. “You wouldn’t like it. It’s an action novel.”
Ron regards him like he’s lost his mind. He seems to think Harry is confused about Malfoy’s business in the DMLE, when he’s usually with Hermione down in Mysteries. While that is out of the ordinary, it’s not nearly as pressing of an issue as
A couple hours might have been optimistic. When they reached the open door of Draco’s lab, Harry had to take a step back. Whatever had been in the cauldron seemed to have
Harry looked like he was going to retort, but instead he kneeled down in front of Draco and kissed him slowly. Once, twice, and he stayed that way, lips just barely brushing.
“I’m right here,” Harry muttered.
He wondered not for the first time what it was that gave him such rotten luck when it came to love. From his first kiss he’d felt like a disaster, lost and uncertain, entirely unsure of what he really wanted and how to go about getting it.
Silence descends over their cubicle. Malfoy eyes Ron’s chair, but wisely chooses to remain standing. Harry notices belatedly that his robes are trimmed in silver, the same shade at his eyes.
“Fuck you! I’m at least above average.”
Malfoy just shrugs and gestures vaguely. It makes his button up (which looks more like a button
“You know,” he said, “we live quite close together. Walking distance, most likely.”
Harry trips on his way out the door, as usual, and his phone slips out of his grip and smacks face-first on the floor. He spends the obligatory silent minute praying to whatever gods exist before bending down to check it. The screen is intact, and he breathes a sigh of relief before his little bottle of sanitizer falls, followed by his keys, headphones, and three canvas grocery bags. He curses and squats down to start fumbling around for everything. Lovely.
“Look,” Ron said, “give him a couple days. And don’t whine about it either. Just give it some time. You’ve got until Friday anyway.”
“You’re not drunk right now,” Draco points out. His voice is going shrill.
Once again the room grew quiet.
“Oh my stars, I’m marrying you tomorrow,” Draco swiped at his eyes.
His eyes blinked open. The smoke twisted in pale ribbons for a few moments before the glowing ember at the tip of the wick snuffed out and they were left with wax making sneaky headway towards the icing.
“No.”
Harry stopped listening after that. Ron and Bill started towards them, worried looks on their faces, but the laughter he’d been holding down was finally bubbling out of him. Draco was still pulling at the neck of his shirt, which put Harry in perfect position to wrap his arms around the blond’s back and crush him to his chest. There was an almost immediate rise in the volume of complaints and insults being thrown at him. Harry waited until he felt a break in Draco’s tirade that signified the Slytherin had run out of breath.
Riven let out a small laugh. Draco hated how quick he was to respond to it, how warm it made him feel. Another laugh sprung to mind.
“Oh. What? No. Really?”
Ron frowned, clearly offended.
he thinks to himself. “I loved it.”
“Um,” Draco hefts Pea up a little higher as he thinks. “There’s the Mandalorian? You’ve probably seen it though.” Christ, Draco, way to go. From the looks of Harry he’d probably never even seen Star Wars. Not to mention everyone on the planet has already seen the Mandalorian.
for and price was no excuse.
“Oh, congratulations! What should I get you?”
As days went, there wasn’t much to distinguish this one by. It was a mundane and predictably tedious set of hours, and Draco saw no reason for it to present itself with this much unexplained gusto. He’d woken up alone, he’d dressed alone, he’d walked alone and now he was eating alone. Lovely, truly, and absolutely no reason for the strange little flips his stomach seemed determined to perform. Really, the day had no right to act this self-important.
Draco spent two of the three days locked in his room. He let no one but his mother in, and that was rare enough. She hadn’t pried, but he called her in anyway and quietly told her what had happened, and finally, finally let the weight that Harry had become slip off his chest and onto some else’s. He’d cried a fair bit, most of it on her shoulder or into his pillow. Afterwards he still hurt but not as sharply. It helped when she shushed him and held him close, whispered encouraging words and explained that the first love was always the hardest. The first love, because that’s what Harry was.
And therein lay the only problem— Draco Malfoy, as usual. Harry had enough on his mind without the unavoidable realization of his bisexuality. Or perhaps his homosexuality. His Malfoy-sexuality, Seamus even once offered. He’d liked Ginny, loved her even, but the warmth he’d felt snogging her didn’t compare to the heat that pooled in his groin every time Draco stepped out of the shower with his hair damp and clinging to his forehead and a towel slung low around his hips. Ron had once grudgingly admitted that Draco was fit. Ron was wrong. Draco was bloody gorgeous.
At first, Harry doesn’t mind. It's the same two words, repeated in a tired loop, and he finds his mind humming along, riding the waves of Draco’s little pattern. He has a high, clear voice, the sort Harry would want a lullaby sung in. It’s not particularly refined or in tune, but it’s heartfelt and amusing. Harry thinks he’d like to spend all night listening to Draco sing about currants.
“I’m fine,” he finally said, but it came out too quiet for his liking. He paused, staring down at the table. “I just… I don’t understand. I wrote him. I did.” There always had to be something wrong, didn’t there. He looked up at Ron. “It’s me, isn’t it? All this time, and it’s—it’s just me.”
“I like
“Alright,” Draco said hesitantly. Granger gave him a toothy smile and continued on her way, the tower of books swaying precariously.
Narcissa pounced.
“Thanks,” Malfoy wheezed, clutching at the rail. Harry would have replied, but he was sufficiently distracted by the otherworldly experience that was holding Malfoy’s right cheek in his hand. He quickly let go, instantly mourning the loss.
“You’re beautiful in moonlight,” Draco whispered. “I wanted to tell you on that night in the snow. You glow.”
Distressingly enough, Harry was finding that he actually
The bus grew quiet, or as quiet as a moving bus could be. Rain was streaking down the front window, distorting the traffic lights. Somewhere ahead of them a horn blared in the night.
“Is it something I’ve done?” Riven’s words were slow and careful, and they broke Draco’s heart. “Something I’ve said...?”
“Picking currants, picking currants…”
“Seamus, don’t start,” Hermione sighed.
“I did, actually.” And here he was, doing it, having a conversation with Draco Malfoy in a lift, even after his disastrous start. He only had to find something else to say, something concerning shoes, something a bit flirtatious. Something like— “I was a size bigger than I thought. And you know what they say about shoe size.”
“That’s great,” Harry grins. “I mean, that’s a great idea. Quarantine slumber party?” Draco can’t help the laugh that snorts out of him. “Come over around six?”
That was not a passing fancy. Not an innocent sort of infatuation. Harry didn’t dare entertain the thought of grand things like love, but neither was he going to give up something so overwhelming, so all-consuming.
“Aren’t you even going to ask about the coffee?” he said somewhat desperately when they started down the corridor to get Ron.
“Have you thought at all about what I said last time I saw you?” Riven said softly. “The offer stands, if you’ll have me.”
“Then this is what it comes to,” he breathed. “You don’t want to go through with it.”
“And that’s sanitary?”
went out of business, of course.
He nodded and moved to pass her.
It occurs to him then that he probably can, so with equal hesitancy and excitement, Harry reaches across the desk between them to cup Malfoy’s chin. He swipes his thumb across the corner of that smiling mouth and drags it across his cheek. Harry watches the red bloom against Malfoy’s pale skin, and it ignites such a dizzying level of delight in him that he worries Malfoy may never look put-together in his presence again.
He thought about every mistake he’d made, and every decision that, no matter how terrible, he would never take back because they had left him and those he loved alive to see it through. Draco let them rush past and fly off into the night before regret could consume him. He was left with a gentle hollow feeling, as though his own mind was finally making temporary peace with him, leaving him empty and free.
“He seems to like me,” Harry comments. Draco almost asks who before he looks down and sees that Pea has his claws stuck in Harry’s shirt. Draco moves to peel his paws off with a sigh and a muttered apology that dies quite quickly. He can feel the heat of Harry’s damp skin through his shirt this way, feel the hard plains of his chest against his knuckles. Their arms brush and press as Harry finally hands the cat back to him, and at that point Draco knows his face is flaming.
“Oh, yeah. Yeah, I’ve run out of just about everything. You’ve got to get the shopping done at some point, right?” Harry’s not sure why he’s trying to justify his venture out into London. They aren’t on lockdown yet. He’s got every right to be gallivanting across the city if he so chooses (except for the fact that he’s not stupid).
“You flatter me, Your Highness,” she said swiftly. “Please, do pass on our greatest thanks to her. Anything we can do for her or for you, it shall be done.”
His mouth was dry.
Slowly, by feeble increments, he tried to let go. It wasn’t really letting go at all, but rather accepting the truth the way it stood. Draco’s fantasies wouldn’t return Harry to him. He was dead to Draco now, a figment of memory that Draco had crafted into a sculpture of love. Never something to hope for. Draco felt sick as he forced himself to say the words, whisper them louder and louder until he was almost shouting. Harry was gone.
“Are you worried he’s going to cause trouble?” Ron asks. His voice sounds different, and when Harry glances at him again he’s got both feet slung over the armrest of his chair. Robards will skin him alive if he sees.
“What do you— aha! Behind the TV,” Draco says triumphantly. “What do you have?”
The wizarding world at large thinks it will happen somewhere dignified, like a Ministry ball or perhaps the Atrium. People expect it to be public— even Ron and Hermione have mentioned crowded venues with pointed looks. Everyone argues that one of them will make a scene, get the cameras flashing if only to show one another off a bit. Mrs. Weasley seems particularly set on something grand. She missed out with Bill, Percy, Ron and Ginny, so she’s set on Harry. After all these years she still hasn’t realized that she doesn’t know him quite as well as she thinks she does.
“You called me Draco,” was the only thing Draco could think to say.
Harry braved the office until lunch. When he began to feel terrible enough that he started entertaining thoughts of hexing Smith into something slug-related (Draco couldn’t very well go to the gala with him then), he took the evening patrol on Diagon, if only to get some air.
“Are you doing alright?” A smooth voice sounds from somewhere behind him.
“I’m not familiar with your standards, Potter,” Draco sniffed. “The floors don’t matter much, but I’d rather my workspace be clean. Obviously now I won’t have to worry.”
“You both better shut up if you want to actually see the rumors,” Blaise commented nonchalantly. Pansy froze before whipping around. She grabbed Draco’s arm tightly and he sucked in a breath at her unpleasantly pointed nails.
Malfoy’s eyes widened, but he didn’t protest when Harry wrapped the knitted wool around his neck, bundling him up to the nose.
“Fine. Don’t burn the market down.” Draco kissed Pansy’s cheek and ducked away when Blaise swung at him.
“You can’t
Friends.
Harry’s lines were indeed smooth after that, unrecognizably polished and straight.
Harry isn’t sure what Pea has done to warrant the icy tone, but he’s distracted from figuring it out by the show Draco’s pulled up on the TV.
Harry looks blissful for a second before his expression turns panicked and then horrified. “The ring!”
“Oh,” Hot Neighbor says helpfully. It’s the first time Harry’s heard him speak, and his accent is just as refined and gorgeous as the rest of him. From the way he’s leaning out of his door, Harry can only see his top half, but he’s wearing the softest looking sky-blue jumper and his eyes are absolutely striking in it. Hot Neighbor’s mouth is quirked in a confused sort of twist. It’s only then Harry realizes he’s said something else.
“Er, Ron?” Harry asks. “Who was assigned to the Finley case?” He knows the answer before he gets it, but still can’t look away from the cutting figure Malfoy makes as he saunters towards them in swirling black robes.
“No, it’s not that!” Draco ran a hand through his hair in frustration. Riven flinched at his tone.
Reputable is a stretch. Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson have single handedly torn the tabloid industry to shreds and sculpted it into a beast of fashion-driven scandal. The press is their battlefield and
“Better.” Harry’s eyes narrowed as he leaned against the table. Draco suddenly wished he were standing.
“It’s Friday evening?” Harry tried.
“Your cookies,” Harry says quickly. “They’re amazing, seriously. You’ve got a gift.”
“What do you want?” Draco snapped. He immediately wanted to take it back, but the next second a pleasant blush was spreading across Potter’s cheeks, and Draco was disturbed to realize he rather loved the look of sheepish embarrassment on him.
“I can’t expect you to,” Riven sighed. “I made a grave mistake, and we’re both a bit heartbroken for it. It’s only fair I explain to you.”
Harry stood quietly for a few moments, trying to think of what to say. The doubt that he was wrong still hung tightly in his mind. He’d never seen a mark that remotely resembled his own until now, and evidently neither had Draco. Yet the possibility of having him for a moment only to realize he’d been mistaken still loomed bitter and cutting.
“Am I forgiven?” he asks.
He finally produced a thin wooden box tied with a silver ribbon. Draco didn’t recognize it, but neither did he question it when Harry handed it to him. With gentle fingers he untied the silk and pried back the lid to reveal—
“Or,” Ron continued, “when they know exactly what they should be doing, but really don’t want to do it.”
“Just our luck that the pince is a looker,” Pansy sighed and draped herself over Draco’s shoulder. “I can’t believe they locked him up for so long. That beautifully smooth jaw needs to be on permanent display. It’s absolutely lickable.”
Until Friday. Harry could wait until Friday.
“Malfoy,” Harry acknowledges with a polite nod. The stillness around them is most certainly plummeting towards awkward.
“Well,” Ron said, “I might not be George, but I’m definitely familiar with the benefits of a nice, empty elevator. And Malfoy’s headed out right now.”
“Harry, we’re getting married,” Draco says. He’s grinning like an idiot. “We’re getting married. You bought me a ring.”
“Reading anything interesting?” Draco asked.
“Sod off, Malfoy.”
“Potter, you can’t be that thick,” Blaise said after a beat. When Harry just stared in confusion, he made a shooing motion at him. “Go after him!”
“I’m missing my peace and quiet,” Draco huffed. “Haven’t you got other shopkeeps to terrorize?”
“I’m glad you like him.”
“Mate, what the fuck?” Harry hissed, hands cupped protectively over his jaw. He glanced surreptitiously at the group huddled around Savage’s desk, but Draco was still frowning down at his papers, entirely unaware of the quiet commotion in their corner of the office.
“I’d never speak to you again if you did.”
“Making out is putting it lightly,” Thomas held up a shockingly lacy champagne bra. “Hit me in the head as I ran. Risk it if you want.”
“I was in a state of distress.”
Hannah was dared to give Neville a lap dance next, then Dean admitted he had a collection of Celestina Warbeck porn in his trunk, until—
“I don’t understand.”
Draco’s been ready to kill to get oranges. Harry’s so close, the warmth of him seeping into Draco’s side, his lips smooth and full and talking about oranges. No one wants to talk to him about Animal Crossing, no one, and Harry’s sitting there with dimples and glasses and
She shook her head. “Oh, I wouldn’t. Peeves is wrecking havoc in there. If it’s just studying you’re doing, you could try the Eighth Year lounge? I know it’s empty this time of day.”
Draco chose that moment to walk through the cubicles on his way to his lab. He had his overly fancy coffee clutched in one hand, and his hair was falling in his eyes the way it always did when it was damp out. He looked pointedly at his shoes as he walked past them.
