“Harry was doomed to this fate from the beginning. You know that.” His reply was spoken through gritted teeth, and the man tisked at him.
Due to a nerve related back issue, as well as the amount of school work that I am currently dealing with (and will likely continue to deal with till I graduate high school in June) I have decided that I will need another week to wrap up How Fate Intended and officially move onto making chapters for Creature of Winter. However, after that week I believe that, again, only until I graduate, chapters will have to be written and posted once (or maybe twice) a week instead of every other day. The normal chapter upload speed will resume after that when my schedule is completely freed up.
The smile widened, and the dimness that had come with Tom’s aggression was replaced by a light not unlike the reflection of the sun’s rays off of ice. Tom felt that Harry belonged in those eyes.
He still doubted that the ring had managed to gain a body. The timing just seemed far too coincidental to be true. Really, was it so likely that the day after Harry Potter left the British Isles the horcrux of Voldemort was given a new form? It seemed far too…
Harry shook his head, setting the now quite cold tea onto the table and firmly turning away from it, forcing his mind away from the scattered remnants of what was sure to become his life and onto something more stable, more assured than the uncertainty he was feeling. Draco’s familiar voice was booming through the tiny kitchen, after all, punctuated occasionally by his perfectly obnoxious laugh. Harry closed his eyes again, settling his head back onto the back of his chair as he listened to the noise, forcing his mind to go blank and to forget everything that was haunting him, at least for the rest of breakfast. He could worry about Luna, and Theo, and Draco’s disownment, and the millions of other deliriously aggravating issues he would have to navigate once the day was up. For now, just for his birthday, he would ignore the lot of it.
The now nameless horcrux snarled, “that pathetic man is not alive in any respect. I am the true Voldemort.”
Wrangling the letter out of the bright bird’s beak, Theo let it fly back out the window, knowing that he could just send Apollo along if he needed to give a reply. Tearing open the letter, he paid only mild notice to the Greengrass emblem pressed into the wax seal, assuming that it was the only thing around for Blaise to use while living at the Greengrass estate.
“And you’ll write me each day, and tell me what the two of you are up to. Hecate forbid I sit idly by while you get into trouble in France.”
Tracey gave her a pointed look, and Pansy glumly snapped her mouth shut as she watched the other girl walk along the old log. A walk through the woods had seemed to be fun enough for both of them, and she could admit that it was a wonderful change of pace from the places that they typically ended up having conversations in. They had gotten into the rather unpleasant habit of hiding out in small corners or cramming themselves into tiny cupboards in order to, ah…
It seeped into him, cold and hard and unfeeling, and as he felt the hard rock of shock settled deep into his gut, Draco seemed to unwind more and more, the anger finally becoming palpable as fire-real, harsh fire-roared up from between his shoulder blades, burning away at his jumper as he screamed into Harry’s shirt.
He stared down at the worn, dusty floorboards underneath his feet, eyes glazing over as the tapping of his foot slowly ceased. His mind had been in turmoil for the entire day, so sluggish that he hadn’t managed to keep much of his thoughts in order or even coherent. Now though, he felt like his mind was clearing, if only a little.
“Theo’s already left me. The rest are sure to follow if I keep letting things slip.” He murmured, the tired admission feeling more like a forced confession as the weight of memories and passing time pressed down onto his back.
to both their suffering and their happiness. In the end, he doesn't care what happens to anyone who is living, as they are all just this means to an end who's souls will eventually be taken by him. Those who are considered immortal, and therefore he has no eventual control over however, are much more interesting to him as he can actually see them as more than just livestock.
“Gah!” The whispers from her housemates drove her over the edge, and Luna harrumphed rather loudly, slamming both arms onto the table as obnoxiously as she could manage as she glared distastefully towards the man everyone expected her to believe was Mad-Eye Moody. It was an utterly ludicrous thought; someone would have an easier time trying to convince her that Harry walked around on his hands instead of his feet. That was how blatantly obvious it was to her that the soul shambling towards the professor’s table could be nothing but a perfectly healthy twenty-something with all his limbs still attached!
No matter what, even if they were both reduced to beggars on the street, he would never leave Draco’s side.
He stared at it, blinked, before rubbing his eyes. He looked again, squinted, before shaking his head.
“I could never see you as anything but kind, Hadrian. Do not insult yourself by thinking I would be disgusted with you for simply wanting to live. Better men than me have done worse than you.”
It had admittedly taken quite a bit of begging and whining from her, but Tracey had been welcomed in eventually and submitted to a rather terse conversation with Pansy’s parents before they were both left to their own devices. It was all too likely that for the extent of the visit, the both of them would be practically ignored by her parents. As it was, neither of the girls had seen that as much of an issue, as that meant they would be free to do practically anything that they wished while everyone else in the house ignored them. However, a few very uncomfortable words in passing from her eldest brother had all but destroyed the mood, the two had unanimously decided that it would be best if they kept well enough away from the manor for the weekend.
Was this how he had looked during breakfast, pulled taut as a wire and seething? He tentatively reached out a hand, his fingertips just barely brushing against Draco’s temple as their eye contact held.
All she managed was a watery smile, dabbing at the corners of her eyes with the handkerchief as she did. “Yes… yes, that would be wonderful. Well, I wish you both safe travels.”
His eyes ripped open, and as the familiar, long, wonderfully freezing hands reached around to grip his shoulders, Draco found his vision crowded by brilliantly shining green.
question exactly what was wrong with Harry, because it really could be anything. Ever since the altercation the tall boy had had with a bloody
In the end, he sat with his head in one hand, looking down at the table between the cracks in his freezing fingers, and tried to will the tears not to fall.
His second office’s location is rather mysterious, as whenever the man is asked for the location he states that it is situated somewhere along the coast of Austria. Of course, considering that Austria is landlocked and therefore has no coast, it has been assumed by anyone who hears this reply that the man is rather lacking in geography knowledge and meant to say Australia, which while being quite a bit farther away, is still quite doable for such a rich man. They go further to assume that, being such an esteemed and well-regarded individual, Lord Lucius Malfoy might have willingly taken on such an exorbitant international floo fee so that he could discuss business propositions with clients that were situated in Australia, and that the office has nothing but the purest of intentions. In truth, they are right in believing that the Lord Malfoy would willingly take on exorbitant international floo fees for a cause that he found to be needed, but would be wrong in believing that he had pure intentions with such fees. In fact, his second office is situated along the coast of Alaska in the states, which is, while admittedly rather similar to Austria and Australia in terms of sharing the first letter of ‘A’, is about as far off course as one can possibly get. What gets done in the office off the coast of Alaska is anyone’s guess, though considering how often his wife joins him on ‘business trips’ to the office, it can be easily inferred that the office might have a fold-out couch, or ample space for a tipsy couple to… prostrate themselves.
Theo looked closer at Luna’s father, watching as his eyes shifted and glanced around the room. He seemed to be looking at
You can assign the name of one thing to something else entirely, and that does not diminish the existence of both.”
He shifted slightly, patting around in the grass for a moment before finding her hand. He snatched it up, planting a sleepy kiss on her palm, before linking their fingers together.
Draco laughed, leaning forward slightly as he nodded. “Yeah, nearly fell out of the blasted thing too.”
He shook his head, rubbing a hand down his face roughly before pinching the crest of his nose between two fingers and squeezing his eyes shut. All he had to do was say it, show Draco the letter, and go from there, right? It wouldn’t be catastrophic, or anything of the sort. It would be no different from what he had wanted to do mere hours before.
Perenelle stepped forward again, looking seconds away from pulling him down into another warm hug, before heavy footfalls made the three of them turn towards the narrow stairwell. Draco clambered down into their line of sight, his trunks in hand as he muttered obscenities under his breath. Harry smiled lightly, the worries of the past several months easing away as the shorter boy sided up besides him with a tired grin.
There was another, slightly longer pause, in which Luna was certain Theo was attempting to figure out the great puzzle that he envisioned her to be. He took a deep breath, and she followed his lead for a moment before deciding against it, and instead looked out to the tiny little pond and the single rock on the other side of the bank. For summer the grass was very green. She would have thought that with the heat wave that had come in not a few days prior all the grass would start to dry up and die, but perhaps the little pond had just enough water in it to keep the nearby grass watered.
His soulmate leveled him with a disapproving glare, before turning away and letting go of his hand as they finally reached the top box. Harry reached around and rested a hand on his shoulder instead, instinctively crowding closer as they stepped inside and a few nearby eyes turned to look at them curiously. Harry scanned the room, ignoring all the other eyes as Draco guided them over to their reserved seats.
behind it that unsettled Theo slightly. He refused to take a seat even after the man motioned for him to do so a second time. “Come now Favorite, tell me what she’s shown you. I would dearly love to know.”
"Hm... non, tu es bien trop petit pour qu'il soit intéressé par toi." Replied Gabrielle, in an almost matter-of-fact tone. Draco’s eye twitched, and he immediately grabbed Harry’s one free hand in a vice grip. Harry, however, merely leaned back into the couch cushions quietly, closing his eyes with rising frustration as the conversation fell further away from his influence. If they were going to talk with him, quite literally, right between them, then the least they could do was speak in a language he understood.
Draco groaned, burying his still-sizzling face in his hands and attempting to rub the feeling away. “You complete and utter… you
He wondered passingly, reaching his hand out to graze his fingertips lightly across the splintered remains of the worn wood. Harry would likely be needing some time to cool off though, and it was all too likely that he was currently working through Lucius’ letter with Draco, so it seemed that Tom would have to come up with a temporary fix for now, and deal with permanent locks at a time he was better prepared for it.
He looked at her strangely, at least, his body seemed to turn away from the pond he was throwing rocks into and his magic seemed to get a little more molten than normal, though she really couldn’t be certain. Her eyes were partially closed after all, it was a tad difficult to make out specific details.
He took a shuddering breath, blinking away the freezing ice in his eyes as his free hand was taken, and pressed between to warm ones. The hands seemed to subconsciously recoil at first, the freezing temperatures being either a shock or a surprise, before holding firm, and tightening around his own.
“I’m fine. I’m just fine boy, don’t worry yourself.” Harry muttered apologies as he stepped back again and Nicolas brushed himself off, looking vaguely nauseous as he did. Harry held back more concern as the man strode forward to pick the silty liquid up to the light, observing its color with the eye of someone who had been doing this for centuries.
A few people have asked this (which is way more than I honestly ever expected), but I am absolutely fine with fanart in any form as long as the artist shows me what they made, be it through a link in the comments or something personalized like an insta dm!
Krum nodded along to his words, his face about as readable as a waterlogged book floating about in the Atlantic. Draco grimaced slightly, his eyes flying between Harry’s ever-impassable visage and Krum’s apparent poker face.
She idled on the pair’s souls for a moment, before her gaze shifted to Draco’s. It was a familiar soul, a deep black with a smoldering feeling of heat, though there was something different about it. She frowned, biting at a bit of dead skin on her lip in thought. He seemed rather anxious, and profoundly tired, though for what reason she didn’t know. Perhaps she would ask him about it the next time they spoke. Neither of them had written to the other over the summer, but they had managed to have such a lovely conversation before the school year had ended, so hopefully, he might feel inclined to confide in her.
They sat in silence for a time, the only sound being Draco furiously flipping pages and the scratch of nails against wood as Daphne fiddled with her wand. Blaise had gone back to staring at the ceiling, mapping out the little patterns of carvings as the seconds ticked on. He listened as the train started up and slowly moved out of the station, carving a familiar path out of London as the sound of the city was replaced by the steady chugging of the train. The seconds really were ticking on. Really… genuinely ticking by. He grimaced. Harry really needed to get his pocket watch fixed. The blasted thing was remarkably loud.
are painfully obvious, Hadrian. No one person could desire someone as strongly as you desire Draco Malfoy unless that person was so deeply entwined with their lover that their very souls merged together. Don’t try to deny that.”
“I sent Persephone along ahead last night, so you don’t have to worry about her inside my room, she should already be in France if there wasn’t any bad weather. I’ll write to you both tonight if she is there, but if she isn’t I'll use Harry’s owl, Hades. You won’t be able to miss it father, if you haven’t seen the owl already. The thing’s massive, and has the most absurd eyes… but that doesn’t matter much in the end.”
It wasn’t until they were halfway to the great hall that her curiosity seemed to have gotten the better of her, and only as Harry started to turn down the wrong hall, the trunk still suspiciously in one hand.
Harry’s arms around him were firm and steady, and absolutely necessary as he pulled Draco up from where they had both fallen to the floor. Draco stumbled slightly at the sudden motion, lurching as a sudden bout of nausea washed over him. His vision span, and as his stomach curled his hand slought out Harry’s own, finally finding and gripping it tightly as he attempted with scrambling limbs to right himself.
There was a pause, a deafening silence, before the boy beside him shifted forward slightly, and confused green eyes came into view.
Blaise quirked a brow, not so much surprised as he was curious. Of course Harry had seen death, but it had only just occurred to him that Harry had barely been one when the attack on Godric's Hollow happened. Did he remember so early on in his life, or was there some other instance that made him able to see the strange horses? And, really, what exactly was it with Harry and death-related creatures? First the dementor backed down to his command in their third year, and now the thestrals were going mad at the sight of him as well?
Draco whipped his head up, following Harry’s finger as it pointed towards a thin man with sallow skin and a mile-long stare, standing around with a few people wearing Bulgarian colors. He blinked, watching as the man awkwardly stumbled over his own feet, needing to be caught by a man beside him, who laughed before patting him on the back.
“And when she says youth, she means around one to two hundred years old.” Harry quipped, grinning as Perenelle waved her hand in a ‘shoo’ motion towards his general direction, saying something muffled as her mouth was still filled with the pastry. Draco watched the interaction with curiosity. He had never seen Harry interact with his relatives, sure, but there was a comfortable familiarity between his soulmate and Lady Flamel that made Draco think there was some sort of bond between them. One that he could almost relate to the one he had between himself and his late grandmother. It was rather odd, really, if heartwarming.
The man, seemingly reverting to his past methods, observed Tom like he was nothing but a particularly fascinating book. “I do not believe that there are right and wrong paths for individuals, but it is all too clear to me that Hadrian’s actions hardly affect just him as an individual. What I suppose I should have asked instead, was: what is the right path for the very fabric of our universe, and how likely is it that Hadrian will not follow that path? How likely is it that he will not be the hero of our world, but Armageddon itself?”
He knew that Remus Lupin was innocent, which of course raised the thought of who the hell had been bold enough to not only enter his school, but kill a girl in one of the most gruesome ways imaginable, before fleeing off into the night, all without the wards giving him even a blip of concern for the intruder. Any werewolf in Britain was a potential perpetrator, though Albus felt that the only one fearless enough to even attempt such a thing would be Fenrir Greyback. The only issue with that being that the man was last spotted mere hours prior to the attack in southern England near the town of Newquay, which had to be about as far from Scotland one could get without being in the ocean. Sure, the bastard could have taken the floo to Hogsmeade, as it was the closest place within miles of Hogwarts, but it seemed doubtful that he could manage to get through without anyone seeing him or the private floo alarms alerting
All Harry could do was nod silently in agreement, ice crystals racing up his arms and tangling around his fingers to protect them as the fire roared brighter and brighter, Draco’s wings were quickly revealed out from under the layers of burning cotton, shuffling and twitching with the unmistakable urge to take off into the air. It
Barty felt himself react to the voice, electrifying every nerve as the familiar speech traveled over to reach his ears, somehow picking itself out amongst the other, louder voices, if only slightly. Harry Potter. Harry Potter? Harry Potter was nearby? Movement from beside him seemed to react to the voice as well, pulling him from the conversation forcefully. He tried to make sense of it as a familiar noise—a yelp, he realized—made its way through the overwhelming noises from the same direction. It was familiar, and rose up again as the creature beside him gasped breathlessly, making a movement and a squeak as it turned his way. He sighed in relief, realizing who it was. He wanted to reach out to her, the familiarity of Winky besides him being a welcome one in such an unfamiliar, chaotic space.
“The first name I wish to honor is that of Lavender Brown, who went missing and is thought to have passed during the collapse of the Gryffindor tower last Halloween. Please spare a moment to remember her.”
The steps were definitely descending the stairs now, he was sure of it. Would Luna overhear the end of the prophecy? Or was the floor thin enough that she had heard the entire conversation?
Her voice was light, in that same indistinguishable accent that she always spoke in. He thought that he might have heard a bit of Swati mixed in that morning, though he could never really tell. Harry hummed, noncommittal, before taking a slow sip of his tea. It was lemon tea today, he had found himself wanting citrus.
Was it worth it? Did she really want to force them out into uneasy waters when they were already thriving in a tropical paradise?
She shrieked, lurching backwards and scrambling to get as far away from the edge of the bed as she could. Molten brown crowded her, melting tendrils of honey and light in the shape of two arms coming up to steady her from a distance.
Tom gave one last, painful-sounding cough before righting himself, his reddened eyes narrowed at the far wall with anger as his hand still sat pressed against his mouth and nose. Harry watched as he stormed closer to the western wall, his magic gathering in the air around him like some sort of protective shield. Harry watched him go with a mix of concern and curiosity, partially confused with what was even going on and why Tom was bleeding and smelling and tasting things when he never had before. Sure, he had bled before, but that was only after attacking another piece of his soul and getting attacked back for it. He was incapable of being injured by anything other than himself.
individual back to life, where that one particularly unpleasant individual proceeds to make a rather crass decision and write several letters to several of his most close confidants.
“Remember when the Shrieking Shack burned? Draco had seen the corpse they found in there before it had become a charred husk, if you don’t recall. It’s a bit of a touchy subject for him, Blaise, so don’t bring it up again.” Harry whispered, voice hard and forceful as he gripped Blaise’s shoulder to the point of slight discomfort. Blaise blinked, his jaw unhinging as he stared at Harry. How could anyone possibly say something like
The Malfoy estate was sprawling, to say the least. It had miles upon miles of glorious hills and fields of plenty, and on those fields and hills were massive oak trees that housed all manner of magical flora and fauna. Draco had never been particularly attached to the grounds, as his fair skin and tendency to burn up in the sun had made him favor the indoors or the heavily warded quidditch pitch throughout his childhood. His love of potions that he developed sometime after his ninth birthday certainly squashed any remaining hope of him ever necking it out in the woods, though his parents never seemed to complain.
He murmured, turning to look at his ‘brother’ with gentle eyes. “Now come along, it’s time for you to go back to your vessel.”
“I would argue that a leg and my family are just as important as my life.” He replied scathingly, his mother’s face immediately crowding up behind his eyes.
“Tooommyyyyy~! Tommy my darling, you know you want to tell me, don’t you? You were always such a little gossiper you know, don’t betray your nature for some foolish little boy!” Teased the locket, its voice straining as it fought against the chain around its neck. “You’re in there somewhere Tommy! Come help your brother out of these chains!”
“Yes, that’s exactly right. We should wing it. Nothing will ever come of planning for improbabilities when you can merely curse the improbability till it can no longer move.”
The worst thing was that Daphne knew bringing it up wouldn’t end well. At least, that's what she believed. She remembered Blaise’s mental instability from early third year, and was concerned that he would lash out if she tried to get him to open up about what Loki was up to. She knew he would never hurt her, but she didn’t want to disrupt the heavenly peace that was surrounding them like a bubble. Hell, even after the catastrophe that ended their third year, as well as the apparent fallout between Harry and Theo, the two of them had remained unchanged and only slightly shaken. She had even let go of whatever Tracey was hiding in an effort to keep her peace, and had looked the other way as Harry acted unnervingly suspicious for the rest of the school year. She simply didn’t want to get involved if it meant disrupting their happiness.
A huge thank you to my translators Dacraun and idontevenknowyou for their amazing help with this! (you two are the best)
He stopped suddenly, rubbing a hand down his face as he sighed tiredly. The guilt had been eating away at him for months. There had to have been a way he could have stopped Harry from killing the girl. He had seen the entire thing happening months before the incident. He had known it was going to happen. Even if he didn’t know why, he knew that much. Harry said it himself, he would have listened to anything that Theo had to say on the matter. But… he didn’t speak up. He knew his own reasoning, of course, not wanting to change things past what they were decided to be, but after paying such a hefty price in the name of stability… the thought didn’t sit right with him anymore. If the Woman was going to show him these things, then didn’t that mean he had every right to do what he pleased with the knowledge…?
Blaise gazed into the compartment, his jaw slack as he stared blankly at the two people curled up in the corner. Draco raised an unimpressed eyebrow from where he sat pressed up against the compartment wall, Harry’s head leaned heavily on his shoulder, the tall boy looking utterly dead to the world.
“Fleur Delacour. It is a pleasure to meet you as well, mister Potter. I apologize for my sister, she gets rather excitable.” She replied, punctuating her words with a pointed look to the little girl, who pouted. He smiled again, stepping back another foot as Gabrielle attempted to lunge forward to hug him again. Touchy would be a more accurate word, in his personal opinion, but he was hardly going to tell the two of them that.
Teenagers stifled by their environment at home will always make an effort to rebel against their guardians.
Yes, he had been born of a quick, split-second decision. There was no other way for him to live but that. He had to emulate his own creation, and the crazed, bloodied actions that had led to it. That was what the gods wanted from him, and all other methods of existence were clearly defective and wasted on lesser men.
bigger, though Luna had no idea how. Was this what the mysterious woman kept hinting at? Luna didn’t want to believe so, at least not yet, though the thought did linger besides her as she watched Harry calmly walk to his designated table, a writhing mess of golden coils wound taught around searingly cold green, all of it obscured slightly by a protective bolt of blood-red magic that raced from the tip of his head to just above his navel. Luna rather thought it was trying to keep Harry safe, like a twisted cloak of fury. The thought comforted her, just a little bit, despite the angry red magic burning swelteringly hot under her gaze.
He thought bitterly, noting that the first letter looked suspiciously like an ‘H’. He didn’t say anything though, knowing that he and Luna very clearly disagreed on the matter of Harry Potter.
“My daughter often has nightmares of her mother. I am sure that she would make a vision known if she had had one, but would likely refuse to speak of a painful reminder of the… the accident. Yes yes, that is my Luna.” Xenophilius remarked, the man’s unseeing eyes focused onto a mason jar of honey sitting on the counter. “If she wishes to speak of it with you, Favorite, then she will.”
He watched the passersby for a time, observing how people craned their necks upwards to get a good look at Harry, before quickly turning to their companions, who quickly did the same. A few people even had the gall to point at him, and one over-eager cameraman even took a photo. Draco sneered at the lot of them, trying to figure out how Harry could so easily ignore the blatancy of it all. Sure, he got his fair share of people staring at him during school, but he had been living with muggles before that and couldn’t have exactly become accustomed to it by the time first year had come around, since even then he had been particularly uninterested in the looks he got from the general student body.
That being said, I decided to draw everyone in casual outfits instead of the usual uniforms, because at this point you all know what that looks like and I really wanted to show everyone's personalities in a more visual form, which you can't do when they're all wearing a uniform designed to make everyone look the same.
the attacker seemed to have set up the girl’s corpse deliberately, having her be spread out in the middle of the great hall. But, considering all the blood and guts spilled around the scene, it was
“If you’re willing to give it up, it would take a single letter and a visit to Gringotts for you to officially renounce your inheritance of the Black family lordship. Since I’m next in line it will naturally fall to me, and when I am…” he paused, expression breaking for a moment before he grit his teeth and continued. “Come the new year, I can appeal to receive the lordship early due to my status of being an emancipated minor.”
He questioned, hand still raised and prepared to knock. He wasn’t going to listen to Tom for whatever stupid reason he had for denying Draco this knowledge. He wouldn’t do it.
“It didn’t seem like something that needed to be discussed. Why did you not ask about me and Nicolas’ relationship if you thought that we might be soulmates?”
He leaned back in his chair, watching as she quickly rounded the table and sat down across from him, expression gentle and eyes knowing. Harry brushed a hand down his face, picking up frozen tears on his way down. He let out a huff of a laugh, eyes gazing around the room for something to focus on other than her kind, wonderful, understanding face.
Of course it's perfectly fine to do that, as fanfiction is in its very base element unoriginal, but when changing the story to the point that I am, you really need to change the characters as well.
She laughed, almost reminiscent, as she picked up one of the almond croissants she had baked the day before, off of the plate of other confections she had insisted on for breakfast. He watched her take a bite of it before his attention was taken back by the slowly rising sun, it seemed to have just barely started to peak over the distant hills, though it was too early to tell.
She was sitting much as he remembered, with her feet curled up on the seat and her spindly fingers covering her eyes. He studied her for a moment, before his gaze fell onto the seat next to her. He had found it odd from the beginning, but even after finding out everything the idea still sounded ridiculous. Why would Crouch Sr. do something so incredibly risky?
“That’s a low blow, Riddle.” He whispered, turning away from the wall as he closed in on the door Barty Crouch was hidden behind. “And this is a completely different situation, you know that.”
It was the easiest thing to do, as he was unknowledgeable in how his ‘dark mark’ functioned, and needed to learn more about it from a source more refutable than the Failure. He could certainly go to the families that he had already had followers in after graduating Hogwarts, but that prospect was risky considering how long it had been since that time. He had no clue who might be still sympathetic of the cause or who had cowardly turned their back.
“Enough of that, Draco, I wanted to ask you about the effects of gillyweed in water-based potions, remember? We discussed it for a short while last night…”
Tom’s voice boomed through his head louder than his own thoughts, nearly drowning out Draco’s own much quieter one. Tom sounded angry, or maybe… scared? Harry grit his teeth, forcing the thoughts and his father away.
She frowned, setting her book to the side in order to brush a tentative hand down her lover’s temple. Blaise hadn’t said a thing about Loki after yule, and seemed insistent on ignoring that the god even existed. It concerned her a great deal, but Daphne couldn’t help but feel that she hadn’t been pushing the issue near as much as she should have. She had been so swept up in him and their time together and how happy they were, that she had also pushed all thoughts of the god to the side to be temporarily ignored.
“But enough of that! I have many more plants that need watering, and my back has grown weak in my old age.”
Harry shifted from one foot to another, feeling slightly on edge as the time ticked down. In the first timeline, the Death Eaters had attacked late into the night, when most people had already gone to sleep. That time was hours away, so why did he feel nervous?
“I will listen-I am!” Crouch stammered, scampering back until his back hit the wall. Harry continued forward uncontended, only stopping once Crouch had no room left to go and looked sufficiently petrified. Harry stared down at the man, shaking with fury, before his inhibitions suddenly left him and he lunged forward, swinging his leg out to kick the man straight in the chin. Crouch’s head flew back, banging against the wall behind him with an echoing
“The gods think I need… help?” He questioned quietly, his eyes finally leaving the crowded wonders of the room to look at her again. Her eyes really were an unnatural purple. It felt like he was looking at something completely inhuman. Theo bit the inside of his cheek, realizing that he most definitely was. At least, if she truly did correspond with the gods. Her gaze glimmered unnaturally for a moment, and Theo got the sudden feeling that she knew exactly what he was thinking.
Harry sighed deeply, filling his empty chest cavity with air as he glanced out to Draco from behind his hand. His soulmate. His angel. Draco had promised time and time again to always stick by him, no matter what happened, and Harry had promised the same. Come the new year, he would carry Draco through the hardship and the backlash the best he could, if only to prove to himself that he wasn’t a monster, at least not yet.
He shook the thought from his mind, eyes traveling from the old paint on his walls to the open window, where warm summer air was wafting in on a merry breeze. Beyond the end of his alchemy training with Nicolas, had been the end of his and Draco’s seemingly never-ending piles of paperwork. Harry didn’t really know how they had managed to complete it all over such a short period, but theorized that Griphook had likely done quite a bit of the paperwork himself—the goblin did seem strangely fond of Harry ever since the summer of his 13th birthday, after all. It had initially seemed doubtful that he would want to help Harry through the legal gymnastics of transferring his heirship to Draco, but Harry was starting to suspect that the goblin had some strange sense of camaraderie or companionship towards Harry. Perhaps they would be able to sort out the issue of his guardianship now too, though Harry didn’t really have much time to worry about that.
He closed his eyes, breathing in a deep breath to try and steady himself and sort the thoughts running rampant through his mind. An icy chill encompassed both of his hands, snaking up and wrapping around his wrists as well. He peaked an eye open, watching as Harry rubbed a soothing circle into the palm of his sweaty hand with the pad of his thumb. Draco’s eyes followed the movement, observing his soulmate’s long, cold hands as they moved slowly, like a glacier, and in tandem with his heartbeat.
“Well…” He began, not hesitating to follow as she turned and continued deeper into the woods. “There tends to be a bit of an after-party. I haven’t heard of anyone skipping out on it before. And… well, we don’t exactly have a way to get back to France at the moment, do we?”
He sighed, closing his eyes with frustration as indignation made itself home in his mind. That was the worst thing Tom could have possibly said. “I am when those ‘personal happenings’ are affecting me.”
Despite the weirdness I get with drawing this female OC with a more manic and cruel personality (because she's usually a sweetheart on even the worst of days) I actually really love doing it. I think that insane characters that have something deeply wrong with their psyche are fascinating and something that I want to delve into deeper with Fate. Of course, there aren't a lot of scenes that have her in them, just because she isn't usually necessary to the plot as anything but a faceless deity for Theo to fear and Harry to curse on occasion. Of course, that will be changing somewhat in the coming years as the climax of the story reaches its head, but we don't have to talk about that here.
Voldemort began to turn over, eyes trailing up the shadowy space he inhibited until he finally laid eyes on the wisps of golden-green light. He let out a curious breath as he fell onto his back, having managed such a feat despite his injuries.
He stood very still for a moment, before shaking his head. “It sounded like you were out here with me for a moment there, I…”
“International floo is wretched at best, Hadrian, let the boy take a seat.” A cheery woman’s voice echoed through the room, rattling his skull painfully as it forced its way through his ears. Draco raised his hands up and pressed the heels of them into his eyes, hissing with pain as stars danced across his vision and vague colors danced behind his retinas. He was pushed down onto a reclined surface by Harry’s hands, held steady there as he was forced to lay back onto his wings. He shifted so it wasn’t terribly uncomfortable before sighing, muttering a likely indiscernible explanation about the blasted purple floo powder that had surely been the cause for his current state.
He watched as the death magic came closer from where it had entered, it’s glow revealing a little light from the outside, wherever that was. Feeling more so than doing, he forced his limbs to move and reached upwards with his one good arm, his fingers brushing against the wisps in the faintest of touches.
(Don't ask me how I drew each individual freckle on Fate, I literally just used a shitty special effects brush that is supposed to be used to mimic charcoal or something, just really lightly so only dots showed up. The larger dots were hand-drawn sure but that took like three mins max. Remember kids, digital art is already annoying enough, the only way to get something good out of it is by bullshiting your way through the entire process and hoping something mediocre comes out of it.)
Tom sucked in a sharp breath, turning to glare at the impudent little beast as it grinned devilishly at him with sharp, bloodied teeth.
“A tad tipsy are you, darling?” She questioned, taking a rather slipshod sip from the champagne bottle as poor Lucius swayed for a moment, his thoroughly sloshed brain working tirelessly to try to form a response.
If Draco didn’t want to go to Beauxbatons, then Durmstrang would be the next place to turn for help and shelter from the danger of a second wizarding war.
Harry blinked, opening his mouth to interject before she laughed brazenly, twirling back around as her summer dress spun merrily with the movement.
Came the quick reply, echoing as normal through his mind again. Harry rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand, shaking his head side to side as if he could dislodge the voice from inside his ears. What was happening to him?
The boy and old woman turned to look at him as his lord’s voice broke the painful silence, the man’s observation drawing them out of their silent conversation. Immediately the woman gasped, her shadowed face revealing eyes wide with surprise as she rounded his lord to come up beside him, her wand still in hand.
Well, he was still twenty feet up into the air, but stability was a very important factor in these sorts of things.
The imperious curse, as he had found over the years of enslavement, only took control of motor functions. It did not, for instance, control if blood pumped a certain way or if a person felt at all sore. The body, much like the mind, worked as normal, and his muscles ached and his head throbbed and it was torturous, sitting there with no way of fixing any of it. His throat ached and iched, but he could not clear it. His eyes burned, but he could not blink. His bladder was full to the point of bursting, but he could not relieve himself. He could do nothing, until his father returned from work and ordered him to drink water, or to eat, or to use the restroom. He was a slave to his father’s twisted wims, and even more so to his changing schedule. Sometimes, his father returned late, or forgot him under the invisibility cloak, and Barty was forced to lie in wait to be remembered and saved from the torture.
Harry hiccuped, finally pulling his face out of his hand in order to turn and bury it into the man’s shirt like a child. The hand on the back of his head steadied him in the movement, and he felt Perenelle take his other hand as well. He had never been held like this before, like he needed comfort. Perhaps he had; Harry didn’t know for certain if he had or not. Growing up the second time, he had never cried, or asked for comfort from either of the adults in his life. The thought had never even passed his mind, but sitting in that chair, sobbing into his mentor’s shirt, Harry wondered if things would have been different if it had. Would he have been different, more amenable and put-together, if he had been able to ask the Dursleys for comfort? Would it have helped him heal from his first life? Would he have lived his second differently?
The sun rose steadily into the air, and Harry blinked its rays out of his eyes as he took the final sip of his tea, draining the glass. Mornings like this one reminded him of a time he couldn’t quite remember, or maybe just of a vague feeling that he had been trying to chase for a long time. For some reason, he had the mental picture of white feathers and pink lips occupying every space that the sunrise didn’t fill. Perhaps he wanted July to pass just a little bit faster, if only for his birthday to come a little sooner. Perhaps he missed Draco more than he was letting himself admit.
“Would it be possible to turn a normal person into gold or another non-living thing like rock? Or would it be impossible due to the difference between living and non-living transmutations?”
care how Crouch saw him. As long as the man was willing to insert himself into dangerous situations for Harry’s own sake, he wasn’t going to complain. It would serve him well in the end, and if it helped him get a little further under Dumbledore’s radar, then he would bear the annoyances with nothing but a grimace if he had to.
Draco shook himself, ignoring the subtle flames flickering across his collar and cheeks as he set Harry’s letter aside to read again later before grabbing the second one. He hadn’t been sure who it had been from at first, as he had quickly recognized the surname Delacour but not the first name of Fleur. Perhaps she was one of the many daughters of the Delacour family? The estate was certainly widespread enough for one of its many children to escape his notice, though he had admittedly been paying very little attention to his mother when she had been attempting to teach him about French families when he was younger, so his scope of knowledge was likely less than satisfactory in that particular department. Sighing lightly, he tore the peach-colored envelope open and yanked the letter out, wrinkling his nose at the smell of floral that emanated out of it.
I did a piece with a lot of fire in it for an art scholastic this year, so not only have I had a lot of practice with drawing dramatic fire but actually enjoy doing it now. I think that it's likely pretty obvious now that I really like height differences (like...
“Dray, are you alright?” Harry interrupted, his brows furrowed as Draco continued to write silently. The blond boy’s expression didn’t waver past a tightening of his jaw.
“I apologize, my dear, but I have found myself protective of the boy after learning of his life.” He sighed, before standing from his chair. “Speaking of which, I do believe it is about time I return home. I do hope you will manage to control the direction of Albus’ attention, Olympe. I wish you well.”
Harry sighed, and set the letter down. He didn’t know what about it unsettled him so much, but the way Luna wrote felt… strange. Off putting. And not in Luna’s special kind of strange. It felt raw, untempered and rushed, like she had been running through the woods being chased by rabid dogs as she wrote it out. Luna didn’t sound like herself, though many people had difficulty writing in the exact same way they spoke, so perhaps that was it?
“Listen very carefully, you murderous sycophant, because I will only say this once.” He hissed, continuing forward towards the back wall as the man nodded aggressively, a near-whimper escaping his throat as Harry let go, watching as he crashed back onto the floor with a dull thump.
He blinked for a moment, contemplating the thought. Was Harry… overwhelmed? Something seemed to click inside his mind, and the sleepiness from just waking up immediately dissipated as he lurched into a sitting position, pulled from his stupor by sudden panic. What was he doing, just sitting there thinking about it when something was happening to Harry? He half-stumbled half-slid off his bed as he quickly reached for the nearest shirt, intent on figuring out what was wrong and putting a stop to it as fast as he could.
He wanted to argue. He wanted to take back the watering can and everything that he had asked, but instead, he straightened out, clutched her hand in his own, and nodded, the promise bitter and unfamiliar on his tongue.
Perhaps it was Theo’s terrified face that kept haunting the edges of his mind that he wanted to forget.
seemed to be pointed enough for him to understand that it had clearly been written in by higher forces.
The booklet was then placed on the table between them, displaying the title that had been previously obscured by the horcrux's hand. ‘The Will to Survive’ was what it read, the serif font mocking Tom from where he sat in a suddenly uncomfortable chair. He gazed at the booklet as if it had personally offended him, the bright blue letters gleaming in the light of a nearby candle.
“So… any particular plans for the year?” He tried, receiving a genuine smile from Daphne and a rather pained grimace from Draco. Harry merely grunted.
Harry ignored the Leprechaun gold as it rained down onto them all, and kept mostly to himself as the game began and events started to play out just as before. He barely remembered what had gone on the first time he watched, the memory being so vague that all he really remembered was the feeling of excitement as they surged through him. So, he simply watched the people around him, observing as Draco’s sour mood quickly took a turn for the better as he rose up in his seat, screaming and jumping as the players flew around the place at near-impossible speeds, the colors of their quidditch robes mere blurs in the air as the whizzing of quaffles and bludgers was drowned out by the screaming fans and Bagman’s constant moderation.
Luna froze as the cheers grew louder, interspersed with the occasional shocked yell and improper expletive. She didn’t pay any of it any mind, too focused on memories—dreams, she rather thought—no, the nightmares that she had been haunted by in her first year as they suddenly shot out to the forefront of her mind. Harry—this was something to do with Harry. Her head snapped up, and she stared out past her housemates and towards the familiar golden-green of Harry’s soul.
“Equivalence. The concept of equivalence forms each building block that makes up the foundational ideologies of modern Alchemy.”
The man’s eyes were an icy blue, and completely unlike the hateful red of his future or murky grey of his past. They were a scholar’s eyes, ones that were filled with a greed not for bloodshed, but for knowledge. The blue of his eyes was so bright and pale that one would find them more comparable to snow than the sky.
He shook his head slowly, slumping low into his chair as Fawkes finally returned to the room. There was so much for him to consider, and it felt like there was so little time for him to do so.
“The process of speeding or slowing or stopping the aging process of a certain thing’s spirit is based heavily on whether or not it is sentient. This is where the paths of true alchemy diverge into sentient or living, and non-sentient or non-living alchemy. If you wish to change lead into gold, it will be a different process than changing a monkey into an elephant. If you wish to make it so that the gold you created from lead cannot be destroyed, then it is a different process from making a human’s body stop aging. This is because non-living things do not age naturally, and therefore their spirit also does not age in the way that a tree or a cat will. The spirit of non-sentient objects simply will not change unless you force it to, while living things like shrubs and birds and people will naturally progress as time goes on.”
“Right.” Draco muttered, fingers now thoroughly tangled in Harry’s hair as he stared, blankly, at the parchment that he had written out the entire messy, slipshod plan on. “That’s fair, I suppose.”
Immediately as he said the first line, the other man’s smile vanished, and he leaned forward with a serious expression painted across his face. Theo felt unsettled by the ferocity in his eyes, but continued anyway, noticing that the footsteps above them were moving towards where he thought he had seen the stairs being.
“Perenelle, could I talk to you about tomorrow?” He started, his footfalls dampened by the worn rug underfoot as he slowly trekked towards her, his hand coming back up to the burn on his shoulder to absentmindedly rub it again. The eternal woman glanced his way curiously, before smiling and silently handing the watering can to him.
Marvolo stepped over the caretaker’s body, his eyes trained on the entranceway into the manor. He had not initially wished to come here, but after his failed attempt to invade Tom Riddle’s mindscape, he had sourly admitted to himself that the best course of action at the current time would be to find a tucked-away place to stay and gather his bearings. The effort hadn’t been completely in vain, as he had made considerable headway in understanding the connection between a horcrux and the main soul, but the fact remained that Tom Riddle was a much larger part of the whole, and had a considerable amount of magical strength on his side. In the end, it had taken a considerable amount of effort for him to even get inside the mindscape in the first place, and even then all that had gotten through the man’s defences was the barest hints of his subconscious. It had been a wasted effort, in the end.
Without looking at her, and without making much noise at all, Lucius turned and steadily walked to his desk, sitting down behind it with care, as if a bomb were to go off any moment. Narcissa watched with rising concern as he gathered together a quill and a piece of parchment, and mechanically began to write out a reply, the letter still clutched in his left hand.
“Ah, Nicolas, thank the gods zat you are here.” She sighed, before downing the glass and setting it firmly on her desk. “Please tell me zat Dumbly-dorr is not outside. That man arrived hours earlier than agreed, wishing to converse in the wee hours of the morning.”
With that final remark, and a soft exclamation for him to enter from beyond the door, Nicolas finally turned away from the other man and opened the door. Shutting it softly behind him, he waited only a moment before locking it, and turned to look at his dear friend for the first time in many years. Olympe looked tired, sitting back in her massive chair with a glass of red wine in one hand and her head in the other.
Autocorrect very nearly killed me when it changed 'whacking' to wanking in the first scene. I hope you all realize how relieved I was when I saw that in editing and fixed it.
Grunting, he got a hand onto one of his bookshelves, following it towards the west wall where the booming noise had originated. He felt his eyelids strain at the ferocity that he had them shut, the pounding in his skull overtaking any need for sight that he had felt privy to in the minutes prior. It wasn’t nearly long enough until he ran out of bookshelf to hold onto, and found himself stuck between forcing his eyes open or standing there and waiting for the pain to pass. Begrudgingly, he used the shelf to steady himself and slowly lowered to the floor, returning his now free hand to his ear and clutching both through pained grunts.
He looked again to Nicolas, who seemed to be waiting for his response. Sighing, Harry rubbed a hand down his face, no doubt smearing some sort of soot or more likely ink across his cheek. “I’m sure whatever you’re going to ask me is morals related, to which I say: save your breath.”
The third and final office is housed within the bowels of Malfoy Manor itself, and sports a wide variety of tomes, artifacts, and ancient family treasures that are under so many stasis charms that one would find themselves pressed to find a brand-new product on the shelves of a brand-new store that looked half as… well, new. The esteemed Lord Malfoy takes great pride in the office at his home, especially considering that it is the one he uses most often and spends the most time in. Those of his less-esteemed colleagues from less-esteemed businesses are equally familiar with the office, and during the height of the war, many of his subordinates also got extremely familiar with the pattern of the carpet underfoot, especially when their blood and various other bodily fluids were spilt onto it.
He glanced back at the simmering brooch, a sense of slight possession falling over him as he quickly tucked it away safely into his deep pockets before reaching out to Harry’s letter and yanking the blasted thing out of the envelope. Grumbling on about stupid inheritances and pretty gems, he took a deep breath to sooth himself before beginning to read.
of my head.” He snapped, whirling around only for his eyes to settle onto the door again. He stared at it for only a second, feeling like he was holding himself back from doing something terrible. He grit his teeth, fighting against the instincts urging him to
“-and he was just brilliant, did you see that Wronski Feint he pulled at the beginning there? I would never have been able to manage it, but Krum did it so effortlessly!” Draco gushed, his arms waving widely as they followed the darkened form of Perenelle through the tents as lanterns were quickly lit all around them, casting faint glows onto Draco’s face and revealing the wide grin on display there. Harry watched the expression fondly, smiling as the shorter boy changed focus towards the end of the match, hip-hopping from one thought to another like a jackrabbit.
“I just worry about you, Harry.” His father finally replied, a ghost of a hand on his shoulder. Harry snapped his eyes shut. It felt so
Instantly did those icy blue eyes dim into nothingness. The mindscape around them fell apart as everything crumpled, and before he could blink, darkness surrounded him. The man had disappeared, though his smile and his eyes were now forever entangled in Tom’s own.
Albus doubted that Harry Potter, even being the bright boy he was, would be able to manage bringing Voldemort back to life on school grounds without Albus finding out in some way. No, he doubted that the boy was even aware that Tom had risen, though it seemed likely that he was somewhat aware of the man taking residence inside his mind. Albus frowned angrily, settling down behind his desk with a thump. If not for those hex bags, he would have been able to remember exactly how Harry Potter had been acting after the death, but he couldn’t recall even glancing the boy’s way. He would have to observe the child for some time before coming to a conclusion on the extent of his bodily autonomy, though considering how Tom operated Albus doubted that the boy had much control over himself.
Harry bit his lip, almost trying to make it bleed despite knowing he couldn’t, before snatching the letter back off of the desk, turning on his heel, and storming out of his room. He didn’t even think as ripped the door open, taking two long strides down the hall to stand in front of Draco’s door. He didn’t comprehend anything as his hand raised, about to bang on the hard oak until the sudden voice of Tom ripped through his mind like the gong of a bell.
Lest his rather short attention span be squandered by examining a piece of lint in the carpet, Narcissa made quick work of the rest of her skirts, revealing the rest of her copious amounts of legs to her utterly enraptured husband from where he laid, sprawled quite pathetically, across his own office’s floor. Crawling forward, she took his champagne-soaked blazer in both hands and settled happily into his lap, tugging off the imposing piece of fabric as he made an admirable attempt to remove her corset.
“You need a new name, Voldemort. There is already one named Tom Riddle among the living, and I refuse to allow you to keep such a pathetic moniker. I gave you life, so you’ve got to throw your ‘flight of death’ nonsense away as payment.”
Harry hummed, turning back to look at her curiously. Her expression caught him off guard, something about it seeming distinctly somber as she took the watering can from him with nimble fingers.
Death's eyes are really important to the story, so I spent quite a bit of time on them in order to do them justice. I think that, while kinder than Fate, Death is not exactly partial towards humans, and is actually completely
Harry closed his eyes tightly, resisting the urge to say something particularly crass as Tom’s words taunted him.
Her hands ghosted over the feather brooch, straightening it slightly as she adjusted imperfections that didn’t exist. Her fingers, delicate from years of disuse, pressed firmly into the cotton of his black inverness cape. “And please be sure to give Hadrian my well wishes. Merlin knows that the poor dear needs it, what with who he’s apprenticing under.”
So that was it then, he was going to be leaving the house. The last decade of torture seemed insignificant to such a thought, the concept of feeling the sun and being around other people being far too tempting for him to resist. There were so many potential things to do at the World Cup, and most importantly, many different things that might distract his father enough for Barty to finally wrangle free of his binds. Would there be a close call with a bludger, causing Bartemius Sr. to need to dodge or, better yet, get hit in the head and subsequently knocked out? Maybe the hubalub of finding a seat may cause someone to bump into the man, and he would be too distracted by insulting the poor soul to notice Barty wrangling free and running off. The possibilities were endless, in such a crowded place. There would be no Winky to notice him wrangle free and stop him, and no locks to keep him confined if he were to somehow gain the upper hand. There would be nothing in the way of him and freedom besides his father’s easily distracted mind.
Harry didn’t question the quiet until his foot landed on a fallen twig, snapping it and breaking him from the daydream. He looked up and around, stopping in place suddenly as he realized that there were trees all around them. Since when were they walking through the forest?
to his maneuvering. Besides, while Albus had certainly made his disgust of Greyback clear over the years, there was no real reason for the werewolf to go to such lengths to kill one little girl and frame Lupin, especially considering his tendency to ‘turn them young’. So there
His words to Theo during their argument echoed through his skull, and Harry sighed again, feeling the beginnings of guilt creep into his mind. It had been a low blow, and Harry couldn’t help but feel like he had lost quite a bit of Theo’s trust for it, but even things said in the heat of the moment couldn’t be taken back. He would just have to wait and see what would happen when they saw each other again.
“I’ll be as calm as I damn well please, Riddle. And you’re lying through your teeth. Do you truly expect me to believe that you would do something by
His fist flung outwards instinctively, finding its mark in the form of the stone wall beside him, his anger exploding outwards physically at the remark. There was a distinct cracking sound, and he pulled his arm away, watching with distanced emotion as a large portion of the stone brick fell away and crashed to the floor.
"Et tu es bien trop jeune et... femelle pour qu'il te voie d'une façon romantique, donc on dirait que j'ai de bien meilleurs chances, non?" Hissed Draco, clearly mocking the little girl, just going off the tone. Gabrielle made an affronted gasp, before lurching away from both of them and storming off, her little fists shaking with anger. Harry watched her go with a mix of confusion and relief, happy that the altercation was over and done with, regardless of the fact that he hadn’t the faintest clue what it was even about.
“Tom… Tom, I didn’t mean it, it was just a bunch of fun, you know? Just a laugh.” It murmured, fingers twitching as he let go of the chair and faced the broken door fully, before reaching forward and resting a hand against the splintered wood. Tom hummed to the thing’s words, before breathing deeply and getting to work, slowly reweaving the destroyed wood as the locket started to get more and more nervous.
“Oh, the first century or two was filled with all sorts of existential nonsense like that. But once I hit three hundred, those sorts of thoughts seemed counterproductive.” Her eyes looked to a place far away, watching the approaching sun as her mind did the same, though centuries into the past. “I just started focusing on the act of living, I think, instead of the thought of dying. It had taken all that time for me to realize that dying just was never in the cards for me. Funnily enough, I don’t think Nicolas has quite realized that quite yet; he’s ever the mortal man, I suppose.”
“That’s Hermes, Blaise’s owl.” Theo replied, rounding the kitchen island and holding out his arm. The owl shuffled over on the sill before hopping onto his outstretched arm, preening under Theo’s hand as he stroked the bird. “Blaise must have sent me something.”
Perhaps it was because of the countryside, with its breathtaking scenery that he had never experienced on Privet Drive or even Hogwarts, where he could breathe in deeply and feel calm and relaxed and free of all obstructions. Maybe it was the ancient magic in the air, unobstructed by blood wards or Dumbledore’s stifling magic that weaved itself through your hair and gripped your clothes. The air at the Flamel house felt light and breathly out in the hills, and the garden which stretched around the old home was so colourful and vibrant that something as stunning as a red rose felt dull in comparison. Sure, the air would grow hot and balmy in the summer sun, which would typically bring him a great amount of stress and annoyance, but it seemed that the unyielding cold his body now emanated seemed abated by the heat in a way that was shockingly similar to Draco’s encompassing warmth, and so Harry couldn’t help but feel for the first time that he belonged in that sweltering weather. Even so, if the heat became too hot for his liking cooling charms were in abundance inside the home, and iced beverages lined every available table on the more sweltering days where the charms didn’t quite cut it. And even after all that, he still found ample heat down in the workroom, where the heat of melting metals and boiling potions was oftentimes more warm and chemical than the air outside.
Doing what he did to such a small, helpless child for seemingly no reason was something that Theo could never understand.
His mother brushed herself down, glancing up at her husband with a loaded expression. Draco peered down at his shoes, pointedly ignoring the heavy glances between the pair as his father’s hand tightened around his shoulder. It looked like there was some dirt stuck to the side of his left shoe, or maybe it was just the light? They were a burgundy dragon-hide after all, so maybe the light was glancing off it to make some sort of illusion. Draco wiggled his ankle, watching the light glint and further illuminate the brown spot. Definitely dried mud then.
“If you hadn’t come here today, you would have failed in what you must do down the line no matter how hard you try at it, just like how that poor boy with the demon would have died on last Samhain if it weren't for the equalizer rejuvenating and… well,
managed to disregard my authority enough to barge into my conscious mind, does not mean you have any right to information that does not concern you.” He replied tiredly, feeling the beginnings of a migraine building up behind his eyes. He had been expending far too much magic throughout the day. Keeping Harry’s thoughts away from anything that could have been damaging if Marvolo caught wind of it had taken an absurd amount of strength as it was, never mind the fighting and injuries he had also sustained. Keeping another person’s mind so clouded at the same time that he was fighting to keep another mind from infiltrating further into said mind… Tom sighed, rubbing the migraine away temporarily. He would rest his magic and his mind after he got rid of the pest, and then he would apologize to Harry for trying to keep him tight-lipped for so long.
Its eyes bulged as it lunged forward at him, its unnaturally pale face going red as the chain around its neck tightened. “Ooooohh reeeeeally? But you’re Thomas somewhere in there too, aren’t you? And you’re Tommy as well. Poor, sweet little Tommy, you took him young, didn’t you Tom? Why is Voldemort’s shard of the soul any different from theirs? When Marvolo takes me, he can call himself Locket too, since that’s what he’ll be. Me and him and me and him and-”
for clothes ever since the summer after his first year. It was a miracle that his father had kept the mad-elf on for so long, though he doubted that it would last much longer yet.
“It’s from when I got my burns, you know? I’d say more, but it's a bit of a touchy subject for Dray. I’m sure Daphne remembers everything I told her about it though.” Harry replied casually, making Blaise feel like more of a fool than he already did, before letting go of his shoulder and quickly turning away, chasing after the shorter boy as Draco hopped into a carriage and pointedly slammed the door shut.
There was a sudden, choked sob from the Gryffindor table, but Luna didn’t turn to see who it was. She was watching Harry instead, as his soul flickered from anticipation to amusement. Luna felt a tad uneasy at the change. Harry knew something about that girl, more than likely having something to do with it too. She didn’t know how to feel about that.
“Then don’t, Olympe. Your duty as a headmistress far outplays Albus’ wishes, no matter how small those wishes may seem. Perhaps, if he truly wishes to have this girl come to Hogwarts, you should direct him instead to her parents? If they are the ones that need to be convinced, then the entire matter is out of your hands.” Nicolas replied placatingly, before taking a long sip from his glass. It certainly sounded like something Albus would do, placing someone in a position where they had to choose between their duties and his wants. Olympe had never made him aware of a situation like this, so it was very likely that it was the first time she was having to deal with it. Nicolas sighed, before reaching into his blazer and taking out a handkerchief, which he then handed to his old friend like an offering.
“The ‘black liquid’ as you called it, is an easily manufactured mixture more commonly called the Alchemist’s Hand. It was created many thousands of years ago in Greece in order to simplify the process of alchemy, which at the time had instead entailed a great deal of chanting and runes. Alchemist’s Hand, or what I prefer to call ‘ink’ for convenience's sake, is created out of a combination of an alchemist’s own magic and one other choice ingredient.”
then everything that holds a spirit must therefore age and develop that spirit through that aging process. Alchemy, the true alchemy of the ancient Chinese and Greek magicians, is the process of speeding up or slowing down or even stopping the aging process of a certain thing's spirit.”
Came the swift reply, the man sounding particularly uninterested in the prospect of dealing with his own mistakes. Harry shifted lower against the wall, glaring at the blank expanse of old brick that continued to exist in his general vicinity. Tom was hardly one to talk about having things on one’s plate. And, unlike Harry, the man had all the time in the day to sort out the issue with his disobedient horcruxes, while Harry had things like eating, sleeping, and socializing to contend with.
Who was going to stop him, when the very gods had given him form? No one, of that Marvolo knew for certain.
“I’ll help you in every way I can, no matter what happens, alright? I promise, Dray.” He whispered, his calcified heart in his throat as Draco’s eyes widened. He couldn’t discern what was his own emotions and what were Draco’s. He couldn’t even sort out what he was doing from what Draco was thinking. This had to be the soulbond, right? Harry took a shuddering breath, feeling it in Draco’s lungs as the other boy copied the movement. It felt like he was in two places at once, living two lives at the same time. Maybe he was. The line between them seemed to be blurring more and more by the day.
Nicolas nodded along to his wife’s words, but otherwise stayed silent, as if he was trying to figure out the mystery through his own deduction. Harry pursed his lips, slouching further into his seat as the walls seemed to cave in on him. He tapped the side of his mug, wondering if they would give him enough time to come up with something believable before forcing an answer out of him.
“You don’t remember that at all, do you?” A sudden voice piped up from his left, and he turned to glance forlornly at Daphne, who hugged his arm in response. “Don’t you ever wonder about your poor memory, love?”
Pernelle situated herself down in the chair opposite of Nicolas, and suddenly Harry realized his few sparse seconds were up.
“Alright. Keep going.” He muttered, closing his eyes as Draco’s shoulders loosened slightly. Harry didn’t want to force emotion out of him, especially not while he was trying to come to terms with the sudden change in the best way he could manage.
His shoulders shook, a mangled sob finally wrangling itself up from deep within his throat as Nicolas’ arms came around his shoulders, pulling him into an awkward sideways embrace that was equal parts uncomfortable as it was grounding. A hand rested gently onto the back of his head, carding wrinkled fingers through his overgrown hair slowly, gently. Someone spoke-perhaps Perenelle-in French, some sort of muttered lullaby that seemed to drown out the static and memories. It was something sweet and mournful, like a gentle embrace in the middle of a funeral.
For a moment, they just sat there, with Tom watching the blue-eyed man as he in turn watched ‘The Will to Survive’. His companion’s jaw worked itself for those tense seconds, the look in the scholar’s eyes revealing turmoil but not much else as he clearly contemplated Tom’s words.
She waved him off, an amused smile painted across her lips as she did. “Think nothing of it mister Potter. I’ve met far worse in far nicer places.”
promising, and both Perenelle and Nicolas were equal parts excited and nervous to see the result. After all, the pair had been theorizing about the mysterious potion recipe ever since they had gotten their hand on it during some sort of excursion to the alps a few centuries prior, and were desperately wanting to see if it was even possible to make. Harry was, truthfully, not particularly fascinated either way, too focused on the nearing Quidditch World Cup and Draco’s own frayed nerves to care much about some strange potion.

“I’d rather you leave at least an hour before someone’s banging on your door with their wand glowing green, Dray.” Harry muttered into the boy’s shoulder, eyes trained on the messy scrawl of his soulmate’s penmanship across the ravaged parchment.
His feet hit the dry earth below the tree, and Draco took a moment to readjust his too-short trouser legs before setting off towards the manor, his mind awash with new possibilities and exciting notions. As he walked, his hand found the brooch in his pocket, and squeezed it tightly.
life, just like that. No matter that his soul and mind were much older; the man didn’t know that and seemed perfectly fine with throwing Draco’s entire livelihood his way regardless. Was this new Voldemort truly so horrifying that the Malfoys were turning tail and running to hide behind him?
Harry smiled wider, escaping Perenelle’s grasp only for Nicolas to yank him into a warm embrace. “I write to them all the time. They’re doing just fine without me. A little bored, I’m sure, but they get to go on a lot more vacations to sunny places now that I’m not there to complain about it.”
“You’re avoiding the topic Luna.” She pursed her lips, reaching out to pat him comfortingly on the leg.
The locket tried to yank away from his hand, whimpering like a wounded dog as he spoke. Tom’s grin widened as he basked in the sweet silence, his migraine finally receding slightly as he reached around the thing with his hand and grasped the back of the chair, lifting it back up into a sitting position with one swift movement. The locket’s eyes were wide and slightly panicked, and its mouth was wondrously, gloriously shut.
He let his eyes shut again, feeling in his bones that this next morning would be nothing short of excruciating. Sure, it was probably impossible for him to experience frostbite, but thawing himself out each morning would be not only a pain in the arse but a massive waste of time.
They seemed to be in agreement, at least that's what Tom thought. He had found through the years that the diadem horcrux was rather difficult for him to read, even though he remembered being that man himself. Perhaps it was the eyes, or the calmness that spoke of many decades of introspection, but Tom simply couldn’t see himself in the man that he shared so many conversations with. In the younger horcruxes he could easily see a relation, like the diary and Marvolo, but not the diadem. Never the diadem. He saw none of himself in that man besides for the slight curve of his lip when smiling or the particular way he took his tea. Everything else was foreign, and Tom doubted that his understanding would stop being that way after he reabsorbed the soul shard.
Harry grinned, feeling warmth travel up his arms to encircle around his rotting heart as the barest flickers of a spark lit up across Draco’s cheeks, which were flushed to comedic levels.
Just as he said it, Harry had to fight back a grimace. It was a stupid excuse to have come up with. Sure, Draco liked quidditch and other things like it, but Krum was hardly indicative of an entire sport. Of course, the man was a seeker just as Draco was, but that hardly mattered in the end since Harry had taken control of the conversation pretty quickly.
His shoulders sagged, and Harry closed his eyes with a hissed groan, letting his head fall forward and thunk silently onto the door in front of him as he finally lowered his arm.
It didn’t mean that the locket’s reasoning had any basis in reality though. He was himself alone, and while he had gained the abilities and memories of Thomas, Tommy, and Voldemort, that did not mean that he was hiding their consciousness away inside of himself.
He felt the tug of a hand held in his own, non-existent in anyplace but his own shattered mind. Marvolo followed the tug, pushing his way through a large door as he came upon it. The shadows seemed to hug to his sides as he did, whispering pleasantries with the voices of happy children. None of the voices were hungry, or wearing ill-fitting clothes; they existed separate from himself, living and loving and being loved in the way that children were supposed to be.
Harry wondered what the sunrise looked like on her 300th birthday. Maybe it had been a cloudy day, and all that could be seen were vague colours and light. Maybe they had gone to celebrate somewhere that got heavy rain, and hadn’t seen the sunrise at all. He wanted to ask her, but didn’t quite know how to word it. Instead, he took another slow sip of his tea, and asked the question again, but in a different way.
Nicolas sighed through his teeth as he bottled both jars of ‘ink’ with identical stoppers, setting them both back onto the shelf before returning to his seat in front of the forgotten petri dish of gold. “There are various methods I’ve taken to implementing, but I have found that the most effective way is to take a job as a mortician, where I can drain the blood of dead non-magicals without anyone questioning me. There are also blood banks but… ah, I suppose you’re wondering what this has to do with a philosopher's stone, yes?”
very differently from what Harry was usually feeling as well. As Draco stared at Harry’s side of the soulbond, of the rosary, he was acutely aware of it pulsing violently with… something. Anger? Confusion? He couldn’t truly grasp what the emotions were, but what he could understand was that the bolts of red were not feeling the same thing.
He let the words wash over him for a moment, letting them roll over in his mind as the silence returned. It was so quiet that he could almost hear Barty Crouch’s heartbeat from where the man was hidden several yards back, thumping loudly in the man’s chest. Harry focused on the sound, the steady beat calming his mind and letting him mull over Tom’s words. It was quiet, save for that heartbeat. They were too far underground for him to be able to hear much else.
“Gabrielle, give the poor boy space.” Fleur’s voice was overlaid in the same accent as her sister, though her’s was noticeably less strong. Harry thanked her quietly as she pulled the tiny girl off him.
Clearing his throat, Harry ignored the sudden spike of hunger and focused his attentions back onto the topic at hand. “So how did you get this blood here? You can’t just be going out and assaulting muggles to drain their blood after all. The authorities are bound to catch wind eventually.”
He reached the door, creaking it open and stepping outwards into a much better lit hallway. Despite his refusal to renew the library’s enchantments, Theo’s grandfather had always kept the rest of the house in (mostly) working order. Theo didn’t want to act spiteful, but he firmly believed it was out of a wish to stop his interests from being fully realized.
The man’s smile only broadened, eyes still trained firmly onto Theo’s. “Well? Please, enlighten me of what it entails, dear Favorite of our messenger.”
“You alright there love?” Harry questioned, his warm voice laced with concern as he grabbed Draco firmly around the shoulders, leading him over to a vague blob that looked something like a couch. Draco made a garbled groan-like noise, far too focused on the sudden uneasiness in his stomach to articulate anything vaguely discernable.
“I do beg your pardon?” Daphne whispered, her expression caught between dull shock and pure horror. Blaise rather thought it looked incredible on her.
He caught nothing of her expression, spare for a wide, happy smile, before he turned quickly around and stepped forward, his vision swiftly overtaken by purple.
Harry glanced at the étagère that he had kept it on, which now sported nothing but the remnants of the skull that he had yet to clean up. It had split evenly down the middle, as if someone had cut it cleanly with a knife, and was now sitting quite pleasantly on the shelf like… well, like any normal ball of crystal would. He felt no magic from it anymore, and even the peculiar purple silk that had housed it had gone still. He supposed the enchantments making the silk life-like had been severed when the skull had cracked. Such a pity, really, it had been some glorious rune work.
Shuffling his feet again, he focused on the sound of scraping metal underfoot as he grabbed the cauldron and lifted it off the fire, turning away to slowly, cautiously, carry it over to the open window. Setting it down on the stable surface of the windowsill, as if it were a pie, he stood back to watch over it for another moment, observing as most of the smog started filtering out of the window and into the outside air, likely making that side of the house particularly unpleasant to be in the general vicinity of. For a moment, Harry watched the wisteria vine creeping up the side of the window’s edge as it began to wither, before he turned away and headed for the door, waving his hand around his face in one last, woefully ineffective effort to see more clearly in the remarkably poorly ventilated room.
Before the escaped convict did anything stupid, Harry gripped his shoulder and swiftly steered him back to the forgotten stack of clothing, telling him to stop being disgusting by flirting with a girl who was clearly still a teenager, and to go pay for his clothes if he wanted to do something constructive with his time.
more than that of the normal floo, a revelation that he wished he could have had earlier, before he had gone and stormed into the blasted thing. Draco grit his teeth as the world spun past him, the fireplaces that he would have once considered slightly discernable now nothing but a blur as he passed them by. Did it usually take this long for him to travel from one point to another? Draco couldn’t recall a time that he was in the floo for longer than five seconds. It seemed that international floo, while faster and more aggressive, also took much longer than normal. Once again he was tempted to shut his eyes, if only to abate the nausea bubbling up from his throat as the world continued to spin.
The Parkinson estate was in West Sussex, and had a pompousness about it that she had at once been quite proud of. The sprawling country around the manor was nothing short of breathtaking, and the grounds around it were home to a wide variety of beautiful flowers and criss-crossing paths that wound around ponds with koi and the occasional turtle living inside. The interior of the manor was just as beautiful as the exterior, as it was home to the most exquisite decor imaginable, and was all tied together with paintings of past Parkinson Lords and Ladies that had walked those halls so many years prior. Really, the only places that could ever be considered more esteemed and grand were the Malfoy and Greengrass estates, though admittedly there were very few families out there that had drive comparable to the Ladies Malfoy and Greengrass, so it was unsurprising that the two were the only ones in the running for most grandiose home. Pansy considered the thought for a moment, wondering if there was some sort of causal feud between the two families. It would certainly explain why the heir and heiress of each respective house seemed intent on never getting along.
“Mind telling me what all that was about now?” He didn’t expect much of an explanation from Tom, but still hoped that he would have
It was infuriating, how so much had been going on under his nose for so long. He hadn’t a clue how much of Harry Potter was the boy he had painstakingly forged and who was Tom Riddle’s own conscience. Was that why the boy had gone to Slytherin in the first place? Tom Riddle’s conscience acting as a puppeteer and forcing him in the direction most beneficial for Tom’s twisted plans? Could he even salvage the Harry Potter that he had created, or would it be better to kill the boy and start afresh with Neville Longbottom? It was hardly ideal, but if it was necessary to kill Tom then Albus was certain he could find a way.
Hadrian Potter takes his tea with lemon as a chess player finds himself overwhelmed by his own hubris, screaming with frustration as a prisoner awaits his freedom, biding his time as his body is strung up like a puppet with strings of twine.
“I’d love to go, Dray. Thank you.” Harry interrupted him, taking one of the tickets with a smile that seemed almost bemused. They locked eyes for a moment, and the bewilderment almost immediately softened to something else, something familiar, and gentle. Draco waited for a moment, before sticking out his tongue.
“Nick, I need to go talk to Perenelle about the Quidditch World Cup tomorrow, do you mind if I leave? I don’t think you still need me here.”
He shook his head, his grip on Draco’s hand loosening as he pulled away. Draco lurched forward to close the distance he had created, eyes wide and half-crazed as flames erupted across his arms.
light in order for people to… well, to read. He would be less annoyed with it if the other methods of light in the library had been more effective in keeping the place well lit, but the enchantments on the chandeliers hadn’t been renewed and strengthened since long before he was born, since his grandfather-who was old enough and stubborn enough that he was both unable to do so and refused to teach him how until he had reached his majority-had never bothered with the chandeliers in the library. Even when Theo was just barely into his first few years of being able to read relatively quickly, and was therefore in and out of the library almost constantly, the man refused to fix the lighting issue.
agitated as poor Rèmy chattered incessantly about the gardens. Nicolas didn’t want to tell the man off for being so unnecessarily annoying, as he wasn’t the main source of Nicolas’ general agitation, and he was clearly quite bored with the lack of people mucking about during the summer months, but it felt like insult to injury that he would have to sit there and tolerate an empty conversation at a time like this.
Barty sat, eagerly waiting for his father’s reply as his body finished off the chicken broth. If he was taken to the World Cup, would he be able to feel the sun on his face, even from under the invisibility cloak? The thought sent another wave of excitement through him.
A chair scraping made him glance up from his palms, and again did his gaze draw towards the ice and storm that was held in the eyes of the diadem horcrux. The man smiled at him in understanding as he settled back into his seat, having shifted slightly forward to pick up a biscuit from the table. “I hope you understand, Tom, why I was so cautious to submit to your consciousnesses authority.”
So here are my personal (unfiltered) notes about the names and nicknames of all the horcruxes that have been introduced so far. Hope this helps with any confusion anyone may have:
Theo felt unease slowly creep up from his chest at the woman’s words, starting to connect the dots between the events of the past year and her admissions as they came spilling out of her mouth. He glanced down to the smooth stones laid out on the desk, and reached for a honey-colored one, feeling compelled towards a familiar shade as absurdity rained down around him.
Harry laughed, confusion lacing his tone. “What? Dray, are you… alright? Was that too much too soon?”
Backing up another half a step, Theo felt his back hit the display case behind him, the uneven shelves digging into his back as he continued to stare at the door. It was coaxing him in, he knew it was, but he couldn’t do much to break himself from the temptation besides turning tail and running away. If it
The imperious was emotional, physical, and psychological torture, and Barty could not wait until he was able to share such a glorious torture device with his darling father. He was certain the man would adore it, just as he adored it now.
Two brothers discuss the detrimental nature of gossip as plans are made for an uncertain future that, for Theodore Nott, is far blurrier than it has ever been.
In an instant, the sky above him was ripped away, replaced by a familiar towering form as a large hand grabbed a fistful of his hair and yanked up to his knees. Yelping, he instinctively grabbed at his injured arm, clutching it close to his body as a wand was shoved under his chin and his head was forced up to meet
In that moment, Barty’s body finished the slice of toast, and for a small, nearly indiscernible moment, his body smiled, reflecting the joy within in a display of a near-angelic smile. Oh yes, the possibilities were utterly endless, and at least one was guaranteed to come to fruition. The decision of whether that meant that Barty would be free or not, was now left in the caring hands of the gods.
Theo got the sudden urge to defend Luna in some way, and turned back around to glare nastily at his grandfather. “Speaking ill of the dead now, are we? Tell me something,
He glanced over to Perenelle, who had turned around to look at him, Nicolas’ retreating back facing her’s as he walked back to the house. She had a strange look on her face, a very faraway one as she watched the red stone glimmer and shine.
Olympe tapped the rim of her glass in a forgotten rhythm for a moment, contemplating his words. “I had no idea. Not much news leaves the island you know, and even less comes to France. I have heard near-nothing about the boy but his name and his claim to fame. I suppose much of his life has been kept secret for his own sake.”
He winced, remembering how he had been acting during that entire conversation with Mr. Lovegood. He needed to figure himself out soon, or his attitude would come back to bite him when he went back to Hogwarts and the people weren’t as understanding as the Lovegoods were.
Draco nodded in agreement, knowing that if he was able to find a broom fast enough he likely would as well. “Do you fly often? I’m on the Slytherin Quidditch team so it’s a passion of mine.”
As they were walking away and as Sirius appeared out of the stacks of clothing, looking glum, he caught the briefest of exchanges between the two, but upon finding that it was once again in French and he hadn’t a clue what it could have meant, he let it fall to the back of his mind.
With final words of departure, he regretfully left the room, finding Albus there waiting right where he had left him. Stepping away from the door, he waved goodbye one final time to Olympe, before opening the door wider and making a motion for Albus to enter. The man looked at him sadly, remorse painted across his face. Nicolas grit his teeth.
Barty saw stars erupt across his eyes as his entire body lurched forward, his shoulder and elbow both making a distinct popping noise as the joints in his arms ripped from their place, pain splintering out from his shoulder, elbow, and wrist as his joints immediately dislocated. Lights, noises, and feelings, all sharp and cold and impossible to describe, exploded out towards him. Barty cried out instinctively, nearly overwhelmed by the pain and sensations as he was ripped through space at a speed he could barely comprehend.
is sort out my livelihood.” Draco hissed, ripping out of Harry’s hold and immediately returning to his writing. Harry recoiled slightly, about to reach forward again before something in Draco’s posture stopped him. Closing his eyes briefly, Harry bit the inside of his cheek before leaning forward again, resting his forehead on Draco’s shoulder as the shorter boy continued to write.
Theo froze stiff as the purple pouch was set in front of him, unassuming and utterly mind-shattering. He looked from it to the old crone and back again, before taking a sharp breath and reaching for the small pouch of coins strapped to his belt.
“I’m afraid I haven’t until today. My family typically uses portkeys when we travel internationally.” He replied, fidgeting with the cuffs of his coat as he spoke. His heartbeat was thumping like a drum, hard enough that he could feel it right there. Draco glanced at Harry's hands, mentally cursing as he saw the familiar ring proudly on display there.
“Oh Hadrian, our soul is not our own to keep!” Her free arm-the one not preoccupied with pastry-waved ditsy circles through the air. “One’s soul is a synonym for their magic, and a body does not keep such a thing when it gives out. What happens to your magic, is much the same as what happens to your body. It decomposes, and returns to the earth.”
Harry shook his head as Draco snorted again, watching blankly as the two chatting women entered with a sullen-looking Gabrielle following quickly behind them. Draco slowly raised up into a sitting position, his foot sliding from Harry’s lap as he scooted down to sit beside him, their shoulders brushing against each other as Gabrielle caught sight of him and her entire demeanor flipped on its head.
Luna ignored the cheers that accompanied the announcement as she watched the not-Moody’s soul. She had sorted out why it was so excited, which was rather brilliant of her, but not how it related to the body the soul seemed to be inhabiting. Hadn’t Mad-Eye Moody been living a rather pleasant life in retirement ever since the war? There wouldn’t be much reason for him to keep his soul and magic constrained for that time.
Theo bit the inside of his cheek, unsure how to react. Blaise seemed to be doing well, which was better than anything, at least. He didn’t quite know what to think about the need for dress robes or how there was ‘something happening’ come September, but it all seemed pretty concerning, just considering all the secrecy surrounding everything. He had noticed a note on his school letter stating that he would need formal robes for the school year, but had admittedly been too focused on other, non-school related things, to pay much attention to it.
The next chapter will be a bit lighter than this one, though it will, as always, have some dark themes (it wouldn't be my story if it didn't, lol).
Harry swallowed again, biting the inside of his cheek again until he was certain that if he had blood of his own he would be bleeding. “That would take a lot of muggle blood.”
And, sure enough, Harry joined them at Slytherin table around fifteen minutes later, his face a mask of boredom as the tiny first years trailed along behind him, flanked by a stern-faced McGonagall as she led the procession towards the professor’s table.
Besides, necromancy was its own magic, and he didn’t want to risk mixing it up with the untainted blood of muggles if he did end up using it. Perhaps that was a good enough reason to avoid the magic’s use.
about it. What was it? How had Harry gotten it? Was it to do with his infamous scar, or something else? If it was to do with the scar, then how exactly was it related? Those questions had gone unanswered, of course, and eventually, she had let them sit somewhere in the back of her mind to collect dust, but now they were racing back to her attention as she gazed at the angry bolt of blood.
Nearing the familiar door of his usual compartment, Harry sighed with relief, pulling it open to usher Draco inside with a hard look towards the only other person in the hall—some random Ravenclaw who was watching them oddly. She audibly yelped, face erupting into an embarrassed red before she quickly turned away and scrambled into one of the compartments. Harry blinked at the reaction, not having expected it, before brushing it off and stepping into the safety of the compartment. Perhaps she was just a tad flighty.
“Where are you off to?” He called after her, eyebrows furrowed as Draco stood up, seeming as though he wanted to join them.
They both stood still for several moments, Harry with his hands splayed across the table and his shoulders hunched, mind working into overdrive to try and figure out a solution to what he had been told. Nicolas merely stared off into the middle distance, thinking of memories that had long since faded from the minds of society.
Do you understand what I’m saying? You can’t afford to hold secrets close to your chest anymore. You need allies that trust in you and that you can trust as well. You can't fight two wars all on your own with only me to guide you.”
The realization barreled down onto him with ferocity, and Albus jerked in place as he realized his situation. He
“You want out, Locket?” He repeated mockingly, turning back to the thing’s door as he began dragging the chair backwards towards it, holding in his laughter as its head, still turned to the back of the chair, shook slightly as its eyes widened, its gaze pinned on the door that was getting progressively closer.
Harry was… big. He had always been fantastically tall, sure, but now he looked less like a long piece of string and more like a massive oak tree. He wasn’t colossal in body mass by any means, still having that slender build that seemed to fit him so perfectly, but his shoulders were… broad, very broad, and his entire face seemed to have filled out slightly, taking the angular look he had been so synonymous with and doubling its effect. The large-ness of him seemed to be merely elevated by his height, which was still, for lack of a better term, utterly ridiculous.
Tom took a moment to take in the analisis before nodding in agreement, finally glancing away from the icy blue eyes in order to refocus downwards to his intertwined hands. He had known for some time-perhaps instinctively-that no matter how many memories he regained he would never truly be able to embody those memories. They were simply information that would allow him to better understand his soul’s past, but had no effect on his consciousness as it was now, and how it had been since before absorbing the remaining soul of Voldemort.
Rubbing the tears from his eyes, he sent Nicolas and Perelle one last smile before turning and, with a shaky sigh, clasped his hand around Draco’s much smaller one. Draco sent a heavy, knowing smile his way, before throwing the purple powder into the fire. It roared up angrily, dyed the same hue of the powder now staining Draco’s fingers. Squeezing tightly to their entwined hands, Draco let go and picked up his downed luggage and, without a single glance back, disappearing into the flames with nothing but an assured shout of ‘Platform 9¾, floo entrance!’.
The thing cackled, its neck making three separate and distinct popping noises as it twisted its head around to face him fully in an utterly horrific, owl-like motion. Tom stumbled back half a step, repulsed. Locket’s grin widened, erring on the side of unnatural as its thin skin stretched across its unnaturally large skull.
“Not to the gods.” Said the old crone, making Theo go mute as her tone sent off warning bells ringing through his head. “Death is the one who calls the shots for who dies and who lives after all, and he’s not one to let someone die earlier than their time.”
He jostled backwards, visibly surprised by the sudden voice. His mother seemed to be itching to riffle through his trunks, likely wanting another excuse to hold him up for longer. Sighing lightly, he hefted both up in each hand, giving her an understanding-if rather annoyed-glance. She sighed through her nose, hands clasped together and foot tapping an erratic beat into the hardwood floor.
“It has nothing to do with you, Locket.” He replied sharply, eyes skating over the barely human creature and towards the partially destroyed library all around him. It would take a long time to clean up the mess, even if Harry helped. On his own… Tom sighed, running a bloodied hand down his face and no doubt smearing all manner of bodily fluids across his cheeks. It would take ages to clean everything up on his own, and there was no telling how long it would take for Harry to open the door again.
Perenelle: "Ah, a budding potions master? I must say, after Nicolas took on Hadrian I have been wishing I had my own apprentice, how skilled are you?"
Nicolas’ eyes went hard, and he let go of Harry’s shoulder in order to pull out the chair next to him and sit down in it, attentive and horribly serious. Serious in a way that refused him any room for doubt. There was no going back from what he had said, and as Pernelle also rose from her seat at the far end of the table, Harry was confronted with the realization that he really would have to tell them everything. Absolutely everything.
against the thing’s face, slapping a sharp, pink handprint down the side of the insane little soul’s cheek. Then, he pulled his arm back, and socked the bastard in the jaw, sending the locket and the chair it was contained to flying backward, clattering to the ground with the jingling of chains and the wretched little thing’s cackles. Tom looked at it with pity, watching as it writhed and wriggled around on the wood floor, trying to dislodge itself from the thick ties that bound it in place.
Harry's horcrux ie. the OG: Tom Riddle. Repeat nickname(s) (there are a lot of one-offs): Riddle, Tom, and dad
He only got a sparse second to look at the twisting, writhing mass of emerald green, before a hook was looped around his navel and the rising sounds of panicked screaming fell away in a blaze of light.
Listen, just... bully me. It's okay, I promise. I was gone without warning for like... three weeks, you have every right to bully me.
He nodded diligently, shaking the man’s hand a second time before opening his mouth, intent on getting out of the conversation as quickly as he could manage. He didn’t have to do anything in the end, however, as there was a sudden slam, and everyone in the room turned to watch as Ludo Bagman charged into the room, piling rolled-up parchment and other random do-dads up into some poor secretary’s arms as she trailed behind him.
The familiar red of his lord’s eyes nearly drowned out all else, eternal and damning. Barty stared, he stared for as long as he would dare and as long as he could manage. But then, as if a wire had been cut, his instincts finally caught up with him, and he quickly ducked his head, searing embarrassment screaming through his veins like poison. A shiver raced down his spine as the monarch before him hummed, seemingly amused, before the red upon red eyes suddenly left him, leaving a hollow feeling in their wake. And, just as suddenly as it happened, the grace of movement left, and Barty watched with agonizing excitement as Harry Potter’s particular gait returned. Barty stared at the boy’s back, eyes blown wide, his thoughts caught between the bounds of his duty and the creeping fascination that was slowly snaking up from the back of his mind.
Harry grit his teeth, biting down on the inside of his cheek until his teeth broke through the skin. He had far too much to worry about to even
Pain erupted on the left side of his face, the slap ringing out through the empty hall as he let go of his trunks and stumbled backwards, hand reaching tentatively up to the now sensitive skin in shock. He was barely ever touched in a
Despite his thoughts swirling around Luna’s letter, time still passed on for Harry, and before long he was waking up on the morning of his fourteenth birthday, feeling entirely underwhelmed with the whole thing. After the mess that was his thirteenth, Harry didn’t know how he felt about having an actual party like normal, or even celebrating in the first place. Sure, it wouldn’t
“Good… yes, very good. I suppose you should get a move on now, yes?” She muttered, almost to herself. Draco spared a glance at his father to see the man’s reaction, noting a tense jaw and furrowed brows. He didn’t know if that meant his father was upset with his mother’s actions or just thinking-it was just too difficult to discern.
Fighting back a smile, Harry shrugged as flippantly as he could manage. “Yeah? Haven’t I been famous since I was a baby? Wouldn’t it just be two celebrities introducing themselves to each other?”
“Why do you even care about this, Tom.” He questioned quietly, ignoring the patent sigh he got in response as he slowly lowered himself backwards, settling onto the comfortingly cold stone underneath him. “Why did Barty Crouch showing up make you so insistent that I need to throw all my deepest, darkest secrets out into the open?”
He was quite wary to attempt any magic past the simple basics, as anything more than that had the potential to alert the ministry to his happenings, which was hardly a good thing. So, a levitation charm had been the thing to employ, and while the effectiveness of his wandless magic was a tad lacking despite his future self’s mastery of it, Marvolo had been certain the second that the rock had come in contact with the man’s head, he had been in the very least concussed. And, when a clear cracking sound was heard, and the caretaker fell like a sack of bricks onto the muddy ground, he felt confident that the man had died.
“Minister Fudge, who is this man next to you, if I may ask?” Harry interrupted, glancing pointedly at the Bulgarian Minister, who seemed unsure exactly what to do with himself. Minister Fudge seemed to wilt slightly as he spoke, seeming blatantly intimidated for some absurd reason. Harry felt his confusion over the absurd conversation grow, as Fudge backed up another half a step before waving a jerky hand at the man with him. He wasn’t even threatening the man, why was he backing away as if he was threatening him with the cruciatus?
Inescapable situations oftentimes call for horrible sacrifices. The limb must be cut off to preserve the whole.
He found himself whispering, nearly pleading, as his shoulders shook and ice formed where his tears attempted to escape. Bitter, and freezing. It was strange to get everything off his chest, just to verbalize everything that had happened and attempt to digest it all in one go. It was almost freeing, but...
It had been a good idea to take Luna along for the school shopping with Blaise, Tracey, and Daphne in the end. He had been concerned initially, because the reaction people had to Luna was always unpredictable and this was their first true introduction to her, so he had no idea what might happen. In the end, though, he shouldn’t have worried. Tracey thought Luna was hysterical in all the right ways, and Daphne was never one to judge someone for their peculiarities. In fact, Tracey and Luna got on so well that Theo had actually felt himself drifting apart from the group slightly, separated somehow from the friends he had known for so long for no other reason than his silence. It hadn’t quite hit him until then how it was an utter miracle that Draco had been stubborn enough to keep him around during their first year. If he hadn’t, Theo was certain he would still be living with his nose between the folds of a book, forever doomed to stagnation without the pesky, wonderful presence of friends.
Was he still laughing? Harry couldn’t tell, still gripping onto his hair as his shoulders shook. It didn’t feel like he was still laughing. Was this what madness felt like, he wondered?
alchemy?” If Fleur’s eyebrows could get any higher, they would be up at her hairline. He nodded slowly, watching as she gaped for a moment before shaking her head. “He 'as never done such a thing before, you must be quite a remarkable person, Harry.”
Barty swallowed wetly, sucking in a sharp breath as the boy’s gait completely changed. It was just barely noticeable, but Barty could tell when it happened. He could recognize his lord for who he was. His lord walked smoother, more elegantly than Harry Potter. The boy… Harry Potter, walked like a wolf stalking after its prey, animalistic and sluggish and taking its time. Held taught by thin strands of wire. Waiting for the right time to strike. His lord wasn’t like that. His lord, visceral and elegant and cruel, strode like a tyrant walking through the halls of a conquered kingdom. Lord Voldemort walked like he was carrying the head of his mortal enemy in one hand and the crown of a fallen kingdom in the other.
“It-it hadn’t, and he was so cold I was certain it wouldn’t have even worked, I… Hadrian, how do you feel?”
Jolting upwards with a start, the sheet fell away to reveal two wands pointed in his face. Acting on instinct, Harry fell backwards again, slipping over the tangled sheets and crashing to the floor as two flame-based spells were fired in the place his head had been. He cursed, more screams of indistinguishable French phrases filling the air as he threw out his arm, ice encasing it and much of the air around him as more fire erupted.
Shall I roll out the red carpet for you as well, your imperial majesty?” He drawled tiredly, shaking his head at the pathetic little thing as he turned away, focusing his attention on the partially destroyed door into the locket’s own twisted little mind. The doorknob had been ripped off from the other side, and what was left of the actual door had been blown off of the hinges, but with a little effort, it could all be fixed. The only issue would be adding extra defense to it to make sure that Locket didn’t break through again; maybe a deadbolt or three would suffice? Tom hummed, rubbing his jaw as the locket made strangled, inhuman noises from behind him.
“To be frank, I’m not completely sure I’ll stop anytime soon.” It seemed like he was doomed to back pain and, as he had found upon entering a shop earlier that day, crouching down to get inside low-hanging door frames. It was pure luck on his part that the door frames at the relatively new Flamel residence were exactly seven foot in height, and the ceiling well above that, so he had no trouble traversing through it, but he was finding that the older and therefore smaller shops did not give him nearly as much wiggle room.
The realization came to him suddenly, too suddenly. Scrambling up to his feet, he broke out into a half-sprint half-shuffle down the hall, cursing all the while as he fought to go as fast as he could while making sure he didn’t whack his head on the low ceiling.
The molten metal in the container, which was once a strange mix of copper and iron, had been completely eaten away at by the blackened liquid, which now squirmed and shook in what could almost be described as discomfort.
Right there, proudly displayed for all to see, was the Malfoy coat of arms. Harry quirked his brow, unease wavering as confusion swiftly took its place. Had Narcissa written to him? His name on the back didn’t seem to be in her handwriting though, and she always took great care to sign her name as well, so it felt unlikely. Of course, it also couldn’t be from Draco, since he wasn’t the type to send letters without his name and address either, and it seemed unnecessary for him to write him a letter at all, considering that they were living in the same house. Harry stood there for a moment, his still-waking mind sluggishly turning over each Malfoy that he knew of, before his eyes widened slightly and he clumsily ripped the envelope open and pulled the letter out, his curiosity piqued.
