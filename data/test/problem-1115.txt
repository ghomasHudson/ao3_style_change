Several people were watching them still, so Pansy rummaged in her bag and handed over her completed auror report analysis. The remaining people grew bored of watching Draco eat and Harry read, and after a bit, they all turned back to their own meals and conversations.

So sorry for being late!!!
A dark haired girl appeared from the mob of eleven-year-olds and went nervously up to the hat. She sat down and Harry placed the hat on her head and it fell down over her eyes. A few seconds passed and it declared “SLYTHERIN!”
“Probably not, I’d be on my own, but I think I could manage it.” Harry said, moving across the room and beginning to unload heaps of clothes from Draco’s drawer. Draco cringed as Harry unceremoniously dumped them into his trunk. “Oh don’t give me that look, we have to be down at Hogsmeade Station in an hour and you’ve done nothing on your own, if I let you continue on at that rate, you’d never make it before the train left.”
“Hey!” He shot back defensively as he rubbed his arm and toed the door closed. “How was I supposed to know it was you?”
“Aside from not wanting to sit near a bunch of people who will try to thank me for being a hero or some shit? Maybe I just want a quiet breakfast with my boyfriend.” Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and kissed his cheek.
“Sorry it took so long Molly insisted I stay for lunch.”
“Hang on,” Draco said, affronted, “You bet on it?”
Draco was a mess, an utter and complete mess. His mum’s trial was right around the corner and he had no idea how it would go. In the latest hours of the night, he often found himself fearing the worst; that she might be sentenced to death or that she might be tortured.
He was certain that he liked Draco at this point, but had no idea how to express his feelings without putting his friendship at risk. Not that Draco considered them friends. He still scoffed when Harry used the word to refer to them. They were most certainly friends, but there was a level of familiarity they had that made friends feel like an odd label.
“That means we have the whole rest of the day to waste.”
He hoped he hadn’t made things too awkward.
When they pulled away, Pansy slipped a piece of paper into Hermione’s hand, “My number in case you want to go out sometime.”
“We all have hard days, and though I think everyone is feeling it today, you probably have the most reason to stay in bed today.”
Yet again, his thoughts drifted away from the task at hand, even as he responded. “Creep.”
So, Draco was incredibly excited to have a Quidditch match coming up against the Gryffindor team. He was ready to destroy them. Since Harry had previously been their captain, the team had great insight to all of the Gryffindor players mindset and playing styles. Draco was confident that his team would win, they were flying better than ever before. That was until three days before the match when Padma spilled a boil inducing potion all over herself and had to be rushed to St. Mungo’s. McGonagall had assured all of the eighth years that she would be fine, but that still put them down a chaser for the match.
Gryffindor’s new seeker was a third year, one he had actually made a reserve for himself back in sixth year. That meant that she had quite a bit of talent and he might struggle to beat her, he didn’t mind though he liked a challenge.
Harry hoped he didn’t sound like a fool, but before he could second guess himself, he sent the letter and small package off.
Yep… we’re switching chapters. Now Harry’s got even and Draco has odd!
Draco furrowed his brow and looked at her in confusion for a moment, before offering a jerky nod.
Aaaaaand we’re done! This has been an incredible adventure for the last six months. I hope all of y’all are well and those who celebrate are having a Merry Christmas. No we did not plan to end with a Christmas on Christmas it just worked out that way.
“Speaking of that day, the reason I even encountered Draco, was that my friends and I were captured by the snatchers. Draco was asked to identify us, I had been hit with a stinging hex that made me less recognizable. I was terrified that we had just been made, that I would have to fight Voldemort then and there. But then, he looked me in the eyes and said ‘It’s not him.’ I knew we were saved, at least long enough to make a plan.” Now that was a little exaggerated, Draco thought. Draco had neither confirmed nor denied that it was Potter. Was Potter lying for him, or did he genuinely remember it wrong?
Despite Draco’s promise to plan an enjoyable date, he had absolutely no idea what to do to surprise Harry. A week passed, then another and nothing had come to him. Every moment spent with Harry felt like it was building up to some grand adventure for them to share, but his head was empty.
They went in, the coffee shop was bigger inside than it seemed on the outside, but not by much. The place was mostly deserted as it was nearly dinner. They had a cozy aesthetic with couches and comfy chairs as opposed to ordinary tables. There were a few spots that looked more like secluded desks off to the side, this probably became a study spot during the school year. Behind the counter there was a green and gold Timber Coast University flag with the mascot, a chimera, on it. Next to the flag was a menu with hot and cold drinks as well as a soup and sandwich menu and a breakfast menu. Resting on the granite countertop was a sign that said “HELP WANTED” in red letters.
Tired of waiting, he made his way down to the lot where he’d parked his car and stacked up a few of the larger boxes into his arms. It was a struggle to make it back to his dorm, but somehow he managed to do it without the boxes teetering out of his arms. He was on his second trip up- with even more boxes this time- when the top box began to slip. It slid to the right and he scrambled to keep the other boxes underneath it. He stumbled and the box tipped precariously. A hand shot out and steadied the box. Draco peered around the towering stack to find a dark haired boy with green eyes framed in circular glasses looking at him, his lips quirked upwards in the hint of a smile.
Sorry this was so late!!!
So classes suck write now and this is the first real thing I’ve written since my last chapter two weeks ago. Apparently exhaustion isn’t good for motivation.
“You owe me a galleon,” Daphne said proudly.
Hermione looked at him and Ron, sighed and went over to the staff table, taking Neville with her. She sat down in her normal seat and Neville wound up taking Harry’s spot next to her. Harry didn’t mind, per say, but Neville wasn’t a staff member so it was a bit unconventional.
“Hermione, you’ll be fine. Shockingly enough I think that you and Parkinson are the most prepared people on the team.”
My best wishes
Draco could understand that. Pansy’s parents- both very public government figures- had been involved in a very large scheme against the government. On top of that, while they were being investigated, it had become apparent that Pansy’s father was having a very extensive affair with a women fifteen years younger then him. Her family had been on the front page of the weekly news for the past twelve weeks straight. In fact, last week’s edition had headlined that Pansy’s mother was filing for divorce. Draco didn’t have the heart to ask her whether or not that bit was true.
It was only when they had allowed him to pass through that he realized this was actually happening. Draco was actually going to see his father. What if his father was angry with him or didn’t want to see him? Draco didn’t know what he would do if his father refused his company. “Alright,” Jess said, shuffling her papers, “Lucius is on the ninth floor, in cell 947. The lift is this way.” She led him through a few crisscrossing corridors until they reached a clunky old lift.
“I’m undeclared at the moment but I’m thinking something with history, maybe teaching.”
Last up, seeker. Shocker, Potter flew circles around the competition.
“I just don’t know why he would pick me I’ve never even been interested in quidditch before, I only went to the Gryffindor games because of you and Harry, oh hey Harry. And he put me with Parkinson! She and I have never gotten along, and now we each are going to be flying with weapons, that doesn’t sound smart. Also the only times outside of flying class first year I’ve flown were those tryouts and during the battle. I also have so much to do this year between studying for NEWTs, teaching, and attending my classes how am I supposed to make time for quidditch?”
Ronald was tall, very, very tall. He had at least four inches on Draco- and Draco had never been considered short. Usually it was Draco who was towering over the rest, but it seemed that that would not be the case anymore. Ronald concealed his anger well in front of his mother, giving a polite smile and introducing himself as “just Ron.” They made quick work of Ron’s things, of which were much more personalized than anything Draco owned, and much more worn down. The Weasley family certainly wasn’t a very wealthy one.
“Shut up.”
“See you then.” Harry quickly escaped before he could say anything stupid.
“You’ve been rather giddy all day.” Hermione commented out of the blue while she and Harry were laying out the mats.
Draco hurried on to his own room and dumped the boxes on the ground beside the rest. They were all in the center of the room- he still had yet to claim a side, waiting on his roommate’s arrival. He didn’t want to be rude by just forcing Ronald to take whichever side he didn’t select, but if Ronald didn’t arrive soon, Draco would be forced to choose one- at least for the night.
Draco pulled back for just a moment, “That one, that one sounds good.”
“Draco Malfoy!” Draco didn’t move, lost in his own thoughts, once again. “Draco Malfoy!” Pansy elbowed him in the ribs and he finally realized, he was supposed to be doing something. He hurried to Professor McGonagall. She smiled at him too, but it seemed a little more forced than it had with Daphne. Perhaps he was just being paranoid. Perhaps she wasn’t looking at him any differently than she had looked at the rest. Perhaps her gaze hadn’t lingered on him before the feast. Perhaps he was losing his mind, imagining things.
Draco was so relieved he could have collapsed to the ground. He had to physically keep himself back from laughing at his own stupidity. He had never had any sort of trouble with break ins, and yet that was where his mind had first gone.
“I see, so you actually do know to try not to get in trouble.” There wasn’t any malice in the words.
Draco took a seat next to Harry and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder.
Potter.
“Yup,” Pansy said happily as she nudged Draco’s dorm room door open with a foot. “She is entirely as I predicted. Super nice, she’s just as pretty as she was in her Instagram photos- you owe me twenty bucks by the way, I asked and she said she didn’t use any beauty filters or editing software on them. I quite like her, but she’s aiming to join Alpha Kappa Alpha, so she’ll probably off to live with them sophomore year onward. Kind of a bummer but whatever.”
Another hour came and went, Draco had managed to score three times, with Blaise and Hannah each scoring twice, but Gryffindor had scored too. Last Draco had heard, the announcer had said the score was 320-240, giving them an 80 point lead. Draco was still uneasy though, they could still lose. It all came down to Ginny and Harry.
“Do you think Granger and Potter will actually be able to teach us?” Pansy asked.
Fear clouded out everything in Draco’s mind as thoughts of the Cruciatus Curse bubbled their way to the surface. He closed his eyes. “I didn’t.” Draco said and loathed how scared he sounded.
He didn’t want to do a movie, they’d already done that with the horror movie. They couldn’t go and get coffee since that was too cliche and doubtable that Harry would enjoy that with half of his waking hours spent in Rise and Grind. It was too cold to go swimming or on a picnic, but too hot for any of the fun wintery date activities.
“Thanks. Right now it’s not to hard, since I’m at school Andie has custody and I just visit. We’ve planned for me to have weekend custody or something along those lines after I graduate. That’s what I’m a bit scared of. Especially because he’ll probably be spending most of those weekends at Hogwarts.”
Remember to leave comments and kudos!!
Harry nodded and laughed, “I can’t believe you remember that.”
Please leave COMMENTS and kudos to feed our souls!!!
“Good, let’s go.” Harry smiled and dragged Draco out of the room.
“I dunno. Wasn’t there, was I? Bella said Snape did it, Snape said so too.”
Harry’s letter was sweet. But it gave Draco false hope that he didn’t want. Harry missed him! But that begged the question; did he miss Harry? If he was honest with himself, then yes, he did miss Harry. But could he tell Harry that? He didn’t think that he could.
It was the middle of the night when Harry was awakened by sounds of distress coming from Malfoy’s bed. Something in him acted on instinct, it had become a general rule with pretty much anyone he stayed with that summer to wake someone up if they were having a nightmare and help them calm down.
Once he got back to his dorm he spent an hour fretting over what to wear. Hermione eventually grew tired of his inability to make a decision and threw a nice looking t shirt, his high school letterman jacket from varsity track, and a pair of really blue jeans at him.
Just before they took off into the air, Draco thought he saw one of the beaters offer Harry a nervous wave. He turned his head back to see if Harry would return it, but then the whistle blew and they were off.

DIACLAIMER: If you recognize it it’s not ours and we make no money off it.
He wondered what Potter would say at his trial. Would he tell the council about everything Draco had done during their time in school together? Or would he stick to the things that happened while Draco was a death eater? Either way, the list was pretty condemning.
So you might have noticed this chapter has a name. Well, Tay got a bit bored and decided to go through and name our chapters. So you will most certainly be seeing more of those as we continue!
They talked for several hours and then it was time for Draco to go. Just as he was about to close the door, his father spoke one final time. “Are you happy?”
The morning of the trial dawned and Draco was already gone. Harry assumed Draco was accompanying his mother to the trial, so he wasn’t surprised.
Pansy squealed excitedly and pulled Draco into a quick hug before hurrying back off in the direction of their dorm building. Hermione was in her dorm room, but sadly Harry was nowhere to be found. Hermione was being very closed lipped about the whole thing, and had vaguely said that Harry had gone off with Sirius and Remus somewhere. But Draco wasn’t one to pry, so he left it alone.
“Trace loves it, she’s happier than I’ve ever seen her, and she spent the whole time trying to convince me to go back with her and just ditch school for the second semester.” Daphne said, “I really considered it.”
“We’re drunk,” Potter whispered.
He fell asleep, content. Everything was well with the world.
Hermione helped Harry, Sirius and Remus move the boxes in and unpack for the next two hours. Once everything was settled Sirius and Remus said their goodbyes and went home, the two lived only twenty minutes from campus and said that their laundry room was always open.
Enjoy this weeks Draco chapter :)
He arrived down at the pitch and joined Hermione, who appeared a bit nervous, Ron, holding one of the new firebolts his brother had gotten as if it was a prized possession, (which it probably was seeing as it was a high quality new broom), and Neville, who looked as afraid of his broom as he had back in first year.
Harry grabbed his broom off the wall and headed down to the quidditch pitch, he could have used one of the new brooms that Bill and Fleur had provided, but they were the same model, broom companies hadn’t really had a chance to craft a new model due to the war. Besides, the firebolt was a gift from Sirius and it felt lucky.
“Let’s go back to Hogwarts, I believe we have something to celebrate.” Harry smiled and reached out his hand.
So I’m updating with Tay’s chapter again!
“You have been Mr. Malfoy’s teacher for the past eight years?”
A little embarrassed, he feigned ignorance as he said, “Really I don’t think, what is this, Big Hero 6? Why is this playing at nearly ten thirty at night? Anyways I don’t think it will help.”
Harry let Malfoy make the first move, the Slytherin sending out a few non verbal jinxes in rapid succession. Harry batted them away and went on the attack with a few jinxes of his own. Malfoy easily put up a very strong shield, and sent out a petrifucis totalus from behind it. Harry narrowly avoided the jinx and as he was settling back into his feet, Draco had disarmed him.
Harry woke up early, and noticed that Malfoy was already gone. He likely left early so as not to draw attention, Harry didn’t blame him for that.
“He’s right you know.” Said the female auror who had long bushy hair that reminded him vaguely of Hermione.
“Yeah. Tonight was my very bad attempt at trying to ask you out. I was just so nervous that you’d say no or I’d fuck up or something that I wasn’t really being specific. I forgot to even tell you what time.”
“It’s a type of muggle axe, when you bury the hatchet, metaphorically of course, it means to end a longstanding conflict of sorts.” Harry said calmly, trying his best not to sound condescending. He should have expected that Draco wouldn’t know the phrase. “Truce?”
“I just wanted to say,” Draco was finding this to be harder than he’d expected. “Er... I just wanted to say, thank you. Thank you for giving me a second chance and testifying and all of it. Thank you.”
“Did she tell you she didn’t want to be one?”
“Ah, yes, the matter of his actions during sixth year, I’ll let you know that he wasn’t the only person that almost killed someone that year. If you were to convict him of attempted murder you’d do well to convict myself as well. We were young and stupid, still are. He was coerced by Voldemort, his father was in prison, and Voldemort had taken up residence in his home. He hated that he was ordered to kill Dumbledore, the stress left him alone and unable to reach out for help. I witnessed him having a breakdown from the pressure he was feeling.”
Jacob's cheek twitched. At his side, Keith bared his teeth in a manner that ironically resembled the dog Pansy accused him of being, and Bruce's face darkened as he grumbled a reply. "No one asked for your opinion, little bitch."
Harry didn't like fame. He never had. At school, it had been a begrudging necessity that no amount of derision could deflect. After the war, he'd accepted it because there was no escaping it, and because the desperate people that needed something to cling to in the grief and destruction that ensued turned to him. And after that, with his modelling… Harry would have been content to be a small face in the industry, but his name and pre-existing fame forbade such negligibility. He hadn't known that such disregard was what he'd sought all along until it was decidedly taken from him.
Draco's jaw tightened. He didn't reply. There was understanding in Pansy's simple words, and understanding of what was there that Draco hadn't voiced. And that was –
Draco swallowed convulsively. Harry had known? For how long?
Holding the picture up against the space of white wall, Draco pinned it with his thumb, adjusted it, and moved it slightly to the left. "Hm?"
Eight years later, and Harry curled upon himself once more. Arms hooked around his shins, chin resting atop his knees, he stared through the frost-coated window. He didn't smile this time, though. That in itself wasn't a surprise, wasn't a realisation the likes that Harry was struck by, for he knew why he didn't. Couldn't. Too much destruction seemed to weigh upon his hands and cling to the wand that sat abandoned on his nightstand. He would never have thought himself capable of wanting to have nothing at all to do with magic until then, but…
Scrubbing his eyes, nearly dislodging his glasses as he did so, Harry crawled back to proper wakefulness. He felt Draco tense beneath him. "What is it?" he asked.
"Explain," Ron said.
It wasn't a performance, but it felt a little bit like it when, as soon as their lips touched, someone whooped. A shout followed, then a wolf whistle, and even a scattering of claps. It was so far removed from the stage of horror being performed in the adjacent room that it was almost jarring, but…
“You usually bring him up at least once per visit and you haven’t said anything about him.”
To Draco’s surprise, Harry laughed.
Harry gave them an incredulous look. It wasn’t that the plan was stupid, it was that two of the biggest high school troublemakers had chosen professions with high responsibility that made Harry hesitate. The plan wasn’t actually bad. Pansy and Hermione had plans to have some alone time after their exams wrapped up this week, so he’d have the room to himself Friday. If he remembered correctly Draco’s last exam was on the same day. Their other friends still all had at least one exam left after Friday, so if Draco didn’t want it to be a date he had an excuse to fall back on for only asking him.
Individually, Hermione moved around the room, sparring with each until she was satisfied that they had the basic grasp of it. Then she would pair them with someone else to spar amongst themselves. Draco had been so distracted watching her that he failed to notice as Harry sidled up to his side.
“Yes, truth or dare?”
Leave comments and kudos if you liked it!
Mr. Orange was inside and through the glass door he pointed Harry to the alley on the side of the building. There was a door there that said employee entrance and Harry assumed he was meant to use that door.
Draco finally seemed to wake up, “What?”
That was odd, Harry thought, continuing to his dorm. He pulled out his laptop, which was decked out with sci fi stickers, and finished filling out the online form for the classes he wanted to try out. There was two history courses, an athletics course, and an education course that he wanted to try. He also had the stray couple of required courses he had to complete. He knew he’d probably have to drop some of these, but just wanted to try them out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Whatever.” He shrugged, “You’re clearly in a hurry.”
—Appie
“I’m not entirely sure, I know he tried to get his wand back from Harry Potter, but I don’t think he fought for either side. After Potter faked his death, the three of us didn’t fight at all. We stayed in the castle after the battle was over, no one seemed to care that we were there.”
The next two chapters will be up on Thursday! Please leave us kudos and some comments! Love you all!
Hermione came back just in time for the party, “Sorry I’m late, my professor told the class about a monument to a local female historical figure up by the lake and I had to see it. The lake is really pretty too. We should go take pictures sometime.”
Neville was quickly followed by Blaise, who’s patronus was a snake, then Hannah whose was a horse of some sort.
Finally she was gone and Draco was left alone with Ron. He gulped thickly and opened his mouth to say something- anything, but no words came. Ron stared at him for a moment with narrowed eyes before he scoffed, rounded on his heel and stormed out of the dorm room. Draco supposed he deserved it, after all he hadn’t made the best first impression, but he had hoped for a little more sympathy on Ron’s end. Draco didn’t think he would be mad if the roles were reversed and Ron had wanted to switch roommates so he could live with his best friend.
Draco stopped in his tracks and rounded on the pair of them. “He was looking at me?! How?”
All my love <3
Malfoy nodded, dumbfounded, as Harry said, “I guess that means Mr. Zabini and Mr. Goldstein are up.”
When Hermione didn’t show up within the next few minutes Harry went to her dorm to see what was up.
“Have you tried to befriend him at all?” Pansy asked, incredulous.
“I can’t- I can’t be sure.” But Draco was a coward, and he had never learned how to lie. Greyback was standing so close to him, staring at him, making him lose his nerve.
“It’s a book, I worked on it over the summer. People are gonna want a biography for me at some point. I thought I’d rather write it before someone like Skeeter screws it up. It’s got a bit more in it than the draft I’m working on now, that one’s not gonna be ready for the public until the summer. This one’s more personal, you don’t have to read it, I just thought I’d share it with you.”
Harry gasped in mock offense, “Are you implying that my date planning skills don’t meet your rich ass expectations?”
“‘Mione?”
Draco jolted up, “What? She is?”
“Why do you have to be so good at everything?” Draco groaned. “Perfect Potter, you always have to one up me in everything, even being drunk.”
“We should try that.” Draco said. And immediately he knew that this was the special something he had been looking to do with Harry all this time. “Didn’t you say something about wanting to try pottery just has week?”
I only turned on moderations so we can be sure to see what you think!!!
“Oh come on, the heart wrenching emotions will replace the fear you feel. It’s funny too, and it’s just started.” And it was so cute that even if Draco had been thinking about denying the offer, he was forced to accept and snuggle in closer to the couch and to Harry.
Harry was starting to catch on to what Draco was getting at, at least he thought he was. Sirius was so deep in host mode he wasn’t really paying attention.
Draco scratched the back of his neck as he said, “Uh. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to sleep. But I’m not sure where else to go.” He cringed inwardly at himself. He was surely laying it on too thick. Harry was going to see through him at any moment. Only… he didn’t see through him at all.
His whole head started to buzz, in time with the incessant noise. It was getting to him, making his skin crawl. Finally, he gave in to it. He stalked over to Potter’s side of the room and realized...
“You really had no idea I liked you?”
He put away his grading, which apparently would have to wait until tomorrow, turned out the light, and fell asleep before he could ponder what Draco had just said.
“But-”
“Yep. Now that I’ve spilled my daddy issues I suppose it’s your turn.”
When Harry and Draco got back to the dorms to say their goodnights they found Pansy and Hermione watching the news on the couch on the first floor.
“Oi! Potter! Your alarm.” Draco called across the room, not looking at Potter. But when Potter didn’t answer, Draco turned around, setting the wand back on Potter’s nightstand. “Potter!” He said, a little louder this time. Still, Potter didn’t so much as stir. That was when Draco began to grow nervous. “Potter?” Nothing. Draco couldn’t tell whether or not Potter was breathing. Was he dead? Had Potter gone and died on him? “Potter!” He didn’t move. “Harry! Wake up!”
“So from your references and your application I can tell you’re a good guy and that you want to work here. I have a good sense when it comes to trusting people. And honestly you’re the first person that’s applied that has previous work experience in the food business. So start by telling me about that.”
“Please spare me the details. But we’re good?”
“What?”
“I dunno.”
Some kids still looked skeptical. “When I was sorted I almost went into Slytherin and I think that I might have done well there, perhaps have even better than I did in Gryffindor. Now follow me, the sorting is about to begin.”
Harry started again once order had been restored, “I was asked to come here to give my thoughts on Draco Malfoy, so I will do as such without interruptions if you please.
He bought himself a latte before his two classes for the day and only half paid attention until they were dismissed and he was free for the rest of the day. He hurried to find Pansy and dragged her away from a very annoyed looking Hermione, then they found Blaise in the dining hall for a quick bite to eat.
And Draco said the words aloud, partly because he knew his dad needed to hear them, and partly because he needed to say them, “I forgive you.”
Narcissa smiled, reached over and gave Draco’s other hand a squeeze and walked out flanked by the aurors assigned to her.
Blaise shrugged. “I’m cool with it. But only if Neville can play too.”
“I sure did, miss.” He drew out the last word, to make it sound like an insult.
“Good morning.”
“You think I should tell Ron soon?”
The ministry witch spoke again, “Mr. Carrow, you worked at Hogwarts this past year, did you not?”
“To being halfway done with the semester.”
“Thanks Mr. Orange.” Harry paid, and then followed Hermione to one of the comfy couches.
“Er, yeah, goodnight,” Draco replied awkwardly, before closing his eyes and falling into a restless sleep.
There was a lot of nodding, but Draco felt it he moved his head like that, he might pass out. What if his roommate despised him and tried to hex him in his sleep? Or worse? Draco’s insides churned at the prospect of being murdered by another one of these students.
“Your drink will be right up.” Harry said gently as he turned away and stared at the coffee maker as it dripped fresh coffee into the pot.
“Mr. Corner and Mr. Finch-Fletchley.” Nothing truly to note there other than they looked as though they were a year behind, which they were.
I’d like to thank Tay for being such an amazing person and willing to work on this fic with me.
“Yep.” He said, watching as Harry tipped the coffee pot over the small cup, letting the steamy coffee spill gently into it. Draco left himself moving another half step closer and forced himself to stop. It was a bad habit of his, always trying to draw nearer to Harry. It was like they were oppositely chargers ends of two magnets, whenever they were close, they couldn’t help but make contact with one another. The pot ran down to the dregs before his cup was filled and Draco stopped pouring. He turned away from Draco in order to start brewing more. Without Harry’s eyes on him, Draco had a little rush of courage and blurted out the words he had come here to say, “Also you never told me what time for tonight.”
“As his one of his teachers and peers how would you feel about him returning to Hogwarts?” The witch seemed irritated by his supportive testimony.
I hope you enjoyed it! Love you all! Please leave some comments, and kudos if you haven’t already. Keep on the lookout this weekend for Appie’s chapter.
Malfoy was silent.
“You’re in here whenever I’m working, if you weren’t studying the whole time I’d assume you were stalking me. We spend plenty of time together so you’re stalking me or we’re friends, take your pick.”
Pansy noticed Draco sitting on the couch furiously typing on his laptop. Harry knew that Draco hadn’t gotten as much sleep as he could lately with a paper due for one of his classes.
“I came to apologize.”
Draco should have believed Harry’s words because they turned out to be right. After the first round of matches, Timber Coast University beat out Chase College and stayed in the running for the Championship title. Next they were against Gretenburg University, a school that had never posed much of a threat to them. They easily knocked them out of the competition and moved on to the next round. The University of Brecken was a bit more tricky. They usually made it into the quarter final, so it was strange for them to go so quickly, but Draco and the rest of the team managed to eliminate them.
It was likely best that Draco asked later anyway, when there weren’t so many people around. Unable to muster the courage to kiss Harry in front of everyone, he simply grasped his hand quickly and gave it a gentle squeeze before turning away and moving into the throng of people.
Draco helped Harry to set everything up and then class started- Draco still had no idea what Harry had planned.
Ron had started auror training and Hermione was busy spending time with Neville before his apprenticeship started, leaving Harry more time to himself. That meant Harry spent most of his time either with Draco at the manor or taking Teddy to the park. Though Harry was finally close to finishing his cleanup and redecoration of Grimmuald. That had been slowed for a few weeks when he decided to reconfigure some of the layout on the third floor. He had started seeing his mind healer again. He supposed that was the best way to spend an afternoon a week.
“Great so my only hope is that you choose to testify on my side.”
Draco nodded as Harry went to get a rag to wipe tables.
The Thursday to Saturday arrangement for his custody of Teddy changed to weekends only. They had fallen into a rhythm where Harry would pick up Teddy before dinner on Fridays and then keep him over the weekend. He and Andromeda would meet up for dinner on Sundays at the manor of all places. It was a good arrangement, Andie got to see her sister, Harry got to see his boyfriend and Teddy got to run around the manor grounds.
He took another step forward and stopped yet again. What was the point? Harry surely wouldn’t accept him. Draco knew who he was and he wasn’t worthy of Harry, not in the slightest. He was Draco Malfoy, a convicted criminal, a death eater, the son of a death eater... a coward. And yet, Harry had protected him anyway, been on his side anyway.
Back and forth and back again. Draco could see that it was wearing on Harry’s nerves, but he could not get himself to stop.
She came out of the locker room with a towel around her shoulders soaking up the excess water from her hair.
He inhaled shakily, looking at the stars above him. The false, starry sky created by Potter. Potter, who maybe didn’t hate him after all. Potter, who had woken him from his nightmare.
“Muffliato.” Draco whispered, pointing his wand at the bathroom door, so the shower wouldn’t wake Harry.
“You don’t have to tell me more about them today you know, if it’s too much. Just tell me what you’re comfortable telling when you’re comfortable telling it.” Harry nodded, as Draco continued. “It seems you’ve got a lot of hurt in your past, I just want you to know that I love you, and I’m here for whatever you need.”
The semester charged on as normal and Harry and Draco developed a routine of sorts. Draco would join Harry at the athletic center for a morning workout before class. They did things separately as Draco played tennis and that didn’t generally consist of the same skills a runner needed to hone. They went and met whichever friends weren’t in class for breakfast after, went to classes and mostly had separate days.
Drinks were shoved into his hands and in spite of himself he choked it down. His head began to swim as the alcohol took over. Slowly, people began to leave, either stumbling up the stairs or through the portrait hole and back to their own common rooms. Some people had fallen asleep on the various sofas, and a few were even passed out on the floor.
He and Draco said goodnight to the girls and went upstairs to say their goodnights. Since they passed Draco’s room first they said goodnight at the door there. It was limited to a bunch of sappy goodbyes and small kisses, the two not wanting to separate for the night. Eventually they did and Harry went back to his dorm to get a good night’s sleep.
“It’s nothing.”
—Appie
Pansy tried to catch up to him and he let her. But he did speed up his pace to make it difficult for her to stay in stride with him. It was a satisfying feeling, especially with her breathing too heavily to be able to form words. That was what she got for not playing a sport or doing anything remotely similar to exercising.
“Sorry,” Draco mumbled and made his way to his bedroom. The auror followed him. Draco rounded on the auror, “Are you going to follow me into the shower too?”
“Oh, uh,” Neville stuttered, looking like a deer in the headlights. “Well I live with my Gran, and she liked this school for me, my parents went here, its where they met each other and fell in love, so there is a lot of sentimental value in this school. I think my parents would like to know that I was going here.” At the confusion evident in Draco and Blaise’s expressions, he added, “A serial killer got them when I was a baby.”
Mr Orange nodded, “Yep, always can use the extra help around here when the semester starts.”
Harry woke up the next morning and went for a run, deciding to do his weight set the next day, his coach had him on a schedule that involved weight training a few times a week. After that he hit the showers and went back to his dorm.
As some of you have likely realized, we are reaching the end here. There are three chapters left; Appie’s chapter for this week and then the two epilogue chapters that will be coming out on Christmas! It’s crazy to think about (at least for me).
“Hey, Ron?” Harry asked, “Can I talk to you for a bit?”
Noticing his expression, Blaise put a comforting hand on his shoulder and muttered, “It’ll get easier. I feel it too.” Draco nodded and sniffed, turning away from the photos. “I miss my parents too, but we all needed to get away, you know that.” Surprise flooded Draco, he hadn’t been thinking about missing his parents at all. He supposed he missed his mother a bit, but his father… not in the slightest. His father had grown cold in recent years, his smiles tight and eyes angry. And he always seemed so very disappointed in Draco, no matter what Draco did to try and please him. It wasn’t long before Draco had given up on trying to make happy. That was how they’d ended up at a public school that wasn’t even in the nation’s top hundred colleges, despite his perfect gpa and excellent extracurriculars.
“Good you’re done. We’re going into town to the fall festival.”
“Well you’re going home for winter break right?”
“I know what you’re doing.” Pansy muttered before giving in and answering his question. “He’s waiting for Neville to get back from something or other,” She waved a dismissive hand, “Then they’re going to head down here together.”
Their relationship was off to a rough start and they’d never even met… or spoken… or texted. Draco had not been too happy to find he would be rooming with a complete stranger when his two best friends from Linton Dale Prep had come here with him. He’d contacted the dean about being switched, but she had refused him and notified Ronald of his request to a room change.
Harry returned home to Grimmuald after dinner on Christmas Eve. He was a bit wiped after playing quidditch in the snow all day. He was ready to crash into bed and sleep for eternity.
Blaise went off to find Neville while Pansy and Hermione were making out, apparently in celebration of the unanimous decision for Hermione to be included. Draco had no interest in third wheeling them, so he rushed away to find someone to add to the game. His thoughts were a little muddled with trying to think of where Harry could have possible gone, and so he ended up back in his own dorm room.
“Yes.”
Hannah, Susan, Parkinson, and Zabini went up in the air and started playing something that closely resembled a dangerous game of catch.
He heard the door open and close and heard Sirius say, “Something smells good.”
Once the place quieted down enough Harry would put on some music and Draco would usually complain about his bad taste. After a while Harry would concede and let Draco choose the music.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fine. I asked Draco out.”
There wasn’t a party when they returned. The former Slytherins pulled Draco aside to talk details, and hear the verdict. Harry wandered to their room, while Draco caught up with his friends.
“So,” The auror began after a long while of silence, “How do you and Harry Potter know each other?”
Harry kept his eyes open, looking for the snitch. Every once in a while he glanced around and looked not see if Draco had signaled a play or if the Gryffindor seeker, Layla Andrews he believed her name was, had spotted the snitch.
“The police figured out they’re connected. And that it’s not just people wanting to steal from the rich.”
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy?” She asked him.
Suddenly the wand was gone. Draco opened his eyes to find that Ron was face to face with Harry now. Draco wasn’t sure whether Harry had pulled Ron away or Ron had simply decided to redirect his anger, but either way, his attention was now on Harry. “What’s wrong with you, huh? I come downstairs for some peace and quiet only for you to come down snogging Malfoy an hour later! Malfoy! Draco fucking Malfoy, Harry! What are you doing, having a laugh or something? Do you think this is funny?”
“What?!” Draco spluttered, caught off guard by the question. “No! Why would you even think that?”
Draco swallowed hard as Ronald looked up and their eyes met, anger flaring through them as he looked at Draco.
The Ministry witch nodded, “They haven’t got much evidence against her, but the Wizengamot members who are here today are the toughest of the bunch. They aren’t ones to let her off easy.”
He made a break for the library where he spent the rest of the night studying. Definitely not feeling like he was on cloud nine cause he sort of asked out Draco Malfoy.
“Right, that.” Harry fought the urge to look down at his feet.
They sat in silence for a minute.
Harry shrugged, “I might be back next year, I kind of liked teaching.”
“I’m not. I came to find you.”
Molly Weasley was a lot to take in, with her wild red hair and her patchwork dress that had at least twelve various patterns. She’d come bustling into the dorm room, closely followed by her son, introduced herself to Draco immediately and wrapped him in a warm motherly embrace. “Er, I’m Draco.” He said awkwardly once they parted. The hug had been nice, though Draco would never admit it. But it made him miss his mother, so he pushed the thought from his head and turned to survey his new roommate.
“I asked if you missed me too, or is it just mom?”
Draco scoffed and bumped his shoulder lightly against Harry’s. “Git.”
“And what did you think of him?”
When Harry invited him to the movie night early in October, he had no intentions of going. With midterms upon them, he had planned on holing up in his dorm room and studying the night away. But Harry had been rather insistent, so Draco had agreed, despite the fact that he really should have been studying.
“Once you get it you can let it wander around the room, but if you get tired banish it. I will not be responsible for anyone collapsing from depleted magical energy in this class.” Harry said, glaring pointedly at Neville.
“My mom is a little upset that I felt the need to get away, but she understands how… intense my dad gets. She wants to give me space to be an adult. But my dad is pissed, won’t even talk to me. Hasn’t said a word to me since he found out, aside from the initial screaming.” Pansy said, sitting on Draco’s bed and pulling out her phone as it chimed. Her eyes darted back and forth across the screen for a moment before she stood again and said, “I’m going to head out guys, Brittany invited me to go with her and a couple of the girl’s she met earlier today to a twenty-four seven smoothie bar down the street.”
The other new professors introduced themselves with very few nerves. Professor Delacroix spoke with a slight French accent and Professor Barlow surely seemed like a nicer professor than Snape had been.
Harry was atrocious as a Chaser, everything was too fast moving for him to keep track of, though that might be the whole four teams at one time thing. There were also two quaffles going around just to make it more difficult. Upon his turn at keeper, he actually found out that he could do it. He did let a few through but all in all he didn’t do terrible.
Chapter tw: parent death mentions
“Sure.” Harry wasn’t sure how to feel about Draco being that comfortable around him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right.” Draco said dully. “Have either of your parents said anything to you about it? Being so far away- and being here?”
“It’s eight right now, which means plenty of time. Besides weren’t you gonna go set up before curfew?” Hermione asked.
The fear began to rise back up in Draco. Potter could kill him and make it look like an accident.
“Not entirely.”
Harry had his first free night in weeks due to classes, work, and activities. He had worked a bit ahead and didn’t need to do any homework that night. This was good because Pansy’s roommate had planned a movie night in the game room and the whole building had been invited.
He was glad that Potter had done it, the nightmare had been terrible. The worst of all his nightmares.
So this is my chapter and I’m pretty proud of it! (Especially the sorting hat song!) The story might not seem quite cohesive at this point, but Tay and I are meeting tomorrow to buckle down on some plot points so there is surely more in store!
“Wait, how did you know that?”
“You’re late.” Said Delacroix when they met at the spot where the shift change occurred.
The contents of his stomach nearly emptied themselves when he stood, but he managed to keep them down as he staggered up to his room. Potter was there, sitting on his bed and massaging his temples.
“Yes, I taught him transfiguration for the first seven and now I am his Headmistress and the head of his house.” McGonagall answered coolly.
“My trial is only a week. I don’t feel like I can make any plans until I hear a verdict.”
He climbed out of bed and went over to Malfoy, “Malfoy. Malfoy. Draco. Draco wake up!” he said in a whisper-shout.
“Hey Padfoot!” Harry called.
Harry breathed, this was his opportunity, “What if you moved in with me?”
He got lost in his work, so when Potter entered the room, he didn’t even notice. By the time he resurfaced from his ancient runes essay, he was at twenty seven inches and it was dark outside. He glanced at his watch and was shocked to find that it was nearly two in the morning.
“Well, er, he and I talked for a bit, and...” Harry trailed off.
“We have been preparing for over a month, and they know it’s our first class. If we mess up, we learn from it. Also this first class are our age it’s not like McGonagall set us up with first years. So take a deep breath, and find that Gryffindor courage. Trust me, we’ve got this.”
He hastily ran over to the door and unlocked it for Pansy. She was midway through knocking again and nearly punched him in the face in the process. He had to duck to avoid her fist, but he couldn’t dodge her halfhearted punch to his arm. “Asshole.” She muttered as she shoved past him into the room.
Harry was up before the sun on Thursday morning. He left a note for Hermione saying he was headed to the interview and was out the door. He made it to the Rise and Grind with a few minutes to spare.
Hey everyone! Things are getting crazy on my end, so I’m proud to have this chapter out on time! Enjoy!
“Well Prince Dragon and Prince Lion would be kings of the world of course.”
“It did go well, great actually.” Draco said, a little gentler and a little less jokingly. “But perhaps next time we won’t go putting the champagne in the fridge. Especially not when the fridge in question gets so much traffic. The constant opening and closing of the fridge caused temperature fluctuations that resulted in the bubbles being disturbed.”
Tw: Alcohol consumption
It wasn’t long before Blaise arrived with Neville and they started up a game of truth or dare that ended in Hermione and Pansy making out and Pansy offering up her phone number to Hermione. Draco wished he could have that courage as he was now sure he wanted to make out with Harry, and maybe even give him his phone number. But while Hermione had been dropping subtly hints to Pansy all night long, Harry had offered up nothing to Draco, leaving him more confused than ever.
When he was in the stairwell off of the second floor, the top boxes were scooped right off of his pile. He turned to find his best friend, Pansy, standing there, her arms filled to the brim with his boxes. She turned without a word and started up the stairs. He quickly followed behind. “I cannot believe you are still bringing up boxes Draco, I mean really, how much did you pack?”
“Where else would I get to watch Potter and Draco dance around each other’s feeling.”
“Now Mr. Potter, would you please tell us of the crimes Mr. Malfoy has committed.”
Her hands were on her hips and she looked as though she were about to start scolding him. It reminded him vaguely of his mother and his heart warmed. He immediately liked her. “Do you want any help with those? Surely you can’t be unpacking everything on your own.”
“Ok, whatever you say, just please remember to be respectful. I know I didn’t say it explicitly, but you are to use first names for me and Hermione.”
“Sounds good!”
Harry was silent for a moment, then he had an idea, “You think we could write each other over the holidays or something?”
“Oh it’s you, I thought you weren’t working tonight.”
Harry smiled, “Quite right. Today we’re taking a bit of a break from the darker side of this class and performing the actual charm. Now, I doubt that any of us will ever encounter a dementor ever again, but it could be on the practical exam, it’s quite an uplifting charm, and we all need some of that right now. If you do encounter a dementor in the future, you’ll need this charm. I know many of you already can do it, or just need a bit more practice so hopefully this will be a pretty easy lesson. If you don’t get it today, first don’t feel bad it’s a pretty hard charm, and if you want more tips come see me or Hermione outside of class. And with that everyone over to the mats, let’s get started.”
“I’m going to go get Blaise, there is absolutely no chance the two of us can get all of this unpacked on our own before midnight.” She darted out before Draco had the chance to even process her words.
- Appie
“Good morning,” He said sleepily, grinning up at Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for

Harry stopped short at that. “So what, you’re avoiding me then?”
“He is an incredibly bright student. He always turned in all of his work on time, if not early. He was always rivaling Miss. Granger for the top spot. That is until his sixth year, in which he became distant, distracted and neglectful of his work. He frequently missed classes and looked rather sick. He skipped many of his detentions too and many other teachers saw his grades plummeting. In his seventh year, everyone’s grades were poor, so that isn’t anything to judge by. He returned to school this year to redo the previous one and once again he is back to his previous standards, rivaling Miss Hermione Granger for top spot. He has been quiet and respectful is even the Quidditch captain. He has caused me no trouble and demonstrated none of the death eaters’ ideals.”
“Okay ladies, what’ll you have?” Harry asked as Hermione and Pansy approached the counter, leaving Draco to work.
Bellatrix.
Harry dropped his trunk into the compartment on the train. As usual the Weasley family was nearly late, mostly because Ron was dragging his feet. Hermione was already waiting for them with Neville and Luna. Ron went in and sat next to his girlfriend, Harry sat near Neville and Ginny went to sat by Luna. Harry and Ginny had long since decided that they were better as friends. They had tried a few dates between the trials and the funerals and the press, but there just wasn’t that same spark that had been there in his sixth year.
“Neither of them have ever shown the slightest inclination towards Quidditch or anything to do with it, I wouldn’t be surprised if neither of them knew all of the rules.” McGonagall said.
Draco conceded and they had a lovely breakfast up at the staff table. They then returned to their room for their bags and then went straight for the defense classroom.
“No.” Hermione and Harry said at the same time.
“Because I’m pretty sure they’re connected to the person that murdered your dad.”
The way she wouldn’t meet his eyes confirmed his suspicions. He scoffed and turned away from her, stalking across the parking lot and back towards the main campus.
“There’s a whole litany of things stacked against me right now. Letting Death Eaters into the castle, the actual mark on my arm, a handful of Death Eaters who witnessed Him ordering me to kill Dumbledore, and then Dumbledore winding up dead, no one who was on that tower still alive to say that I didn’t kill Dumbledore, it was—”
Enjoy the chapter!
“Oh it’s so cute!” Hermione exclaimed and nearly spilled the remains of her latte as she rushed in.
It was like everything that had been pressing Draco down had lifted and he could finally move freely. The secret was out, everyone who he and Harry were together, and his mum hadn’t been sent to Azkaban. Draco could focus on the things that had been important to him before all of those horrible things had happened; his classes and Quidditch.
“Morning.” Draco said. “Feeling better?”
“I am doing nothing of the sort!” Draco said, indignation written all over his face. “I actually came here incase you were working at Rise and Grind.”
Harry smiled, “Only if you are.”
“Oh I see why you want to stay.” Pansy said, seemingly just noticing Harry, “We’ll stay and finish our date while Harry closes and you finish your paper.”
“Thank you, that will be all.”
“Really? You’re pretty new, so wouldn’t they not put you on the big case?” Harry asked, he had been about to head back out to the car to get his next box.
“Draco Malfoy, where do I start? Well I guess I should start with he can’t be all that bad if we can share a room for almost three months without irritating each other too much. I really do think that Draco Malfoy is not a bad person, and he is most certainly not a killer. Most of you do not realize I was on that tower the night Dumbledore died, he was killed by Severus Snape, a form of assisted and dramatic suicide. Even if Snape had not shown up that night, I do not think that Draco would have been able to kill Dumbledore. Draco just isn’t a killer.” Draco was surprised to realize that Harry didn’t seem to hate him after all.
“Thank you. My sister Narcissa and I have an ugly history, not as ugly as I had with
“Just try it.”
Harry walked over and leaned on the side of the stairs, “Hey, you wanna do something?”
His trial had arrived... and Draco was beyond nervous. Of course Pansy, Daphne and Blaise had offered to accompany him, but he refused. He needed to do this on his own. Or rather, he didn’t want them to see him as he was carted off to Azkaban. He was a Malfoy after all, he still had a little bit of pride remaining.
He opened it up, concern pooling in the pit of his stomach. His father never left voicemail messages… never.
At least he still had his mother. They would get through this together. Survive this, together.
“Oh god. When I was really little my next door neighbor and I would play princes together and pretended to rescue each other from a “tower” which was his backyard slide.”
“Yes please, what are you making?”
—Tay <3
A look passed between them that Draco didn’t quite understand, but it was gone so fast that he wondered if he’d just imagined it. “So, Brittany what are you majoring in?”
“Yeah, since that girls night you two had a few weeks ago you’ve really been in sync. I know you probably feel like puking right now, but at least eat some toast and have some water, otherwise you won’t have any energy for he game.”
With the trial out of the way the eighth years first quidditch match came rather quickly. They were set to play the Gryffindors, captained by Ginny this year. Harry was actually really excited for the game regardless of that pre game pit in his stomach.
TW: mentioned parent death
By then the two had returned to where Harry’s compartment was.
Harry didn’t really know how to respond, so he let Ron continue.
Harry signed and indulged her in the details of what he was planning.
“Nerd.” He smirked.
Through the darkness, Potter’s tentative voice came once again, “Well goodnight then.”
“That’s good I guess. My parents told me to hold off on a job until sophomore year. And I might just end up doing internships then so it might not be feasible to do that. Also I checked out the cultural clubs and there’s no Indian cultural club, there’s a multiethinc club that spends a few weeks on various cultures and gets a bunch of guest speakers to share though. You could head to the fair and ask them about it.”
They chatted as they binged the episodes and drank. By ten o’clock all of Draco’s chocolates were gone and the snack mix bowl was half empty. They had drunk a decent amount of the champagne and had just gotten to the Halloween episode of the cooking show.
“I will.” Harry said, slightly astounded by the interaction he just witnessed.
Ron nodded, frowning at the memory.
Draco needn’t have worried about the girl being with the green eyed boy though, because as soon as they reached Draco and Pansy, Draco’s gaydar started going off like crazy. There was no way the girl- her name was Hermione- was even the slightest bit interested in men. The boy- Harry- was a little bit more tricky. He was like a book written in a different language, everything was right there with a simple translation, but Draco couldn’t read a word of it.
Harry laughed, “I’ll do my best. But I have to say, Ginny’s really good, she used to beat me when I would play at the Burrow.”
“Who else knows?” Ron asked, “I don’t want to screw up and blab it to someone who will tell the papers.”
Ok, so I totally forgot to write until like Friday last week, then it ended up being super long cause Tay and I decided I was gonna write the date. So here, a week late, is a near double length chapter for y’all.
“Thanks for the interview Mr. Orange.”
There were also teacher duties they had, like patrolling the halls late at night and into the early mornings once a week after the prefect’s shift, or sitting at the staff table to monitor meals in the great hall. Professor McGonagall had asked Harry to be in charge of the sorting hat this year since the first years would probably be less scared this year if their hero was one of the first faces they saw. He had been reluctant, as deputy headmaster Flitwick should have been in charge this year, but he had conceded. Not even Hermione knew about this duty though.
Harry smiled, “Me too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I’m on Tumblr at @/ appalyneinstitute1 if y’all want to go check my blog out. I take Drabble requests there if you have an interest.
“So, when is your trial?” Pansy inquired, “And your mom’s?”
“I know it’s not real you idiot. I just have an overactive imagination. I’ll be fine.”
His first class was Defense Against the Dark Arts, with Granger and Potter. Fantastic.
Harry had woken him up. No, Potter, Potter, always Potter. Never Harry. And Draco couldn’t understand it, why Potter had done it. Why the hell would Potter care? Then it hit him, Potter didn’t care. He was being stupid, trapping himself in his own mind again. Potter didn’t care if he was suffering, Draco had merely been interrupting his sleep, and Potter had woken him up, simply for some peace and quiet.
Harry’s last week of midterms had two exams. Then he was done until December. He spent the parts of the week when he wasn’t in class or at work or running holed up in the library, studying.
“Prince Lion?”
“Do you know what she’s saying?” Draco asked, desperate for anything that might indicate what would happen to his mother.
This meant very few people were out and about throughout the campus. As Draco ran through, music blasting through his headphones, the quad was nearly deserted, with three people walking in a small clump towards the dining hall and absolutely no one else to be seen. It was a little chilly outside and after three miles, Draco had had enough. His nose was red and his cheeks were chilled. The wind bit at his face as he hurried towards Rise and Grind for his daily cup of coffee and muffin.
After that he was pretty sure he had covered his bases. The eighth year Gryffindors had put together a gift for McGonagall, but Hermione was in charge of that. He would go closer to the actual holiday to get sweets for the rest of the eighth years.
But Potter had just saved his ass... again. And Potter didn’t seem to hate him after all. They had been roommates for months now and had never even fought. Maybe they weren’t enemies anymore. Something had certainly shifted between them, if not at the start of the year, then surely now, after the trial.
“Thanks.” Draco bit into the apple.
Now, you couldn’t catch Draco without music playing, day or night, he always had the radio on. Harry found it incredibly amusing, especially when he’d walked into the sitting room to find Draco dancing around the room, lip syncing to Bon Jovi. Draco didn’t think Harry would ever let him live that moment down. Not that he really minded.
“Potter?” Asked a voice.
Hooray another chapter! Thank Tay for posting today, I have been in a fandom spiral due to a terrible movie that serves as the conclusion of a tv series.
He had gotten a couple books and things for Draco, but that wasn’t really the big present he had planned, he was planning to ask Draco to move in with him after his house arrest was lifted.
“It’s not that I hate it here, it’s my childhood home and I have some good memories here, but being here all the time is getting to me.”
When Draco climbed out of the shower a half an hour later, Harry was brushing his teeth. “Morning.” Harry mumbled, not so much as glancing in Draco’s direction. Draco hastily dried off and pulled on some fresh robes before sidling up to his boyfriend and giving him a quick peck on the lips.
Harry and Hermione had met at Camp Evergreen just before middle school and had been the first people the other came out to back at summer camp. They had been good camp friends for a couple years and the other kids had pressured them into trying to date. One failed first kiss later they both realized they were extremely gay and better off as friends, and became email pen pals during the school years. They didn’t both intend to end up at the same college, it just happened. Once they found out they decided to apply to be roommates together, Timber Coast University was shockingly supportive of coed dorms.
Harry couldn’t help but notice Draco hadn’t come down for breakfast. Of course Hermione noticed that he noticed and gave him a look.
Here is Appie’s chapter! Enjoy!
—Appie
Draco looked back on that time fondly. He loved his aunt and cousin, and they had been with Draco’s family nearly every day for months and months while he had been in primary school. Andie had even come to live with them one summer when his mom had had a bad cold and been off of work.
“Take a breath ‘Mione.” Ron said. “If anyone can handle that workload, it’s you, besides you really were one of the best beaters there.”
The last question brought silence to the room, Malfoy had asked it. That was the first time he had spoken in class since that first day.
Hermione was silent. Harry put a hand on her shoulder reassuringly, and then said, “I think I know what we’re going to discuss today, but first there is another question we need to answer. Can anyone think of it?”
“Quite right. Today we’re taking a bit of a break from the darker side of this class and performing the actual charm. Now, I doubt that any of us will ever encounter a dementor ever again, but it could be on the practical exam, it’s quite an uplifting charm, and we all need some of that right now. If you do encounter a dementor in the future, you’ll need this charm. I know many of you already can do it, or just need a bit more practice so hopefully this will be a pretty easy lesson. If you don’t get it today, first don’t feel bad it’s a pretty hard charm, and if you want more tips come see me or Hermione outside of class. And with that everyone over to the mats, let’s get started.”
He didn’t have much of a chance to focus on that though, next to him Hermione was panicking. which made sense because, one, it was Hermione, and two, hadn’t he done the same before his first match?
He went to room three and knocked, he was a bit early, but he would be fine.
“Attention students!” McGonagall called out, drawing the room to an attentive silence. “Now I have noticed that the morale is rather low for all of you. Am I sure that much of this is due to the excessive amounts of homework you have all been subjected to. However, the homework is necessary, so I have come up with another way to remedy this problem. Your house will have a Quidditch team and you will play the other teams and compete for the House Cup!”
“So you threatened him?”
She perked up immediately at the question. “I heard about your date tonight with Harry.”
“I saw Granger, Longbottom, Weasley and Potter. Finch-Fletchley too.” Pansy replied, contemplating, then she added, “Oh and Abbott.”
“And?” At this point it was clear, Sirius and Remus knew that Harry liked Draco.
“Fine. Why do you wanna sit up here so much anyway?”
“What?”
He wondered how much Potter could actually see, without his glasses. He had heard that Potter was nearly blind without them, but he had made it to the window just fine. So perhaps that had simply been one of the many false rumors that had gone around about Harry over the years.
Then his dreadful aunt had strode into the room and hell had broken loose. And Draco was forced to listen to Granger’s screams, and Bellatrix’s hissed, “Mudblood” over and over. He had to duel Potter and Weasley, despite wanting, more than anything, to just let them go.
Harry glared, but allowed him to lead him up the stairs none the less. Draco tucked Harry into bed, kissed his forehead then crossed the room and settled into his own bed.
“Right.”
In his more rational moments, he knew neither of those things would happen, but even so... she could be sentenced to life in Azkaban with no visitors allowed. He might never see her again. No, he knew that wouldn’t happen either... right?
“Blaise thought you fancied Weasley, Pans thought it was Granger and I thought it was Potter.” Daphne said.
“Do you want to tell them? Or should I?” Harry asked Hermione.
It didn’t matter that Harry and him had known each other when they were children.
“Well,” Draco started— wait since when was he Draco? How often had Harry been calling him that in his head? “My friends started making plans for the holidays. I couldn’t bring myself to join them.” Draco sat on his bed.
“Oh he talks, he’s just a bit shy about it. Hey Ted, can you say Harry?” Harry asked.
“Can we drop the subject, please.” Harry cut her off.
“My mother’s maiden name was Narcissa Black.” Draco said, “And my Aunt Andie would visit us when I was little, less so in the past few years. She married a man named Ted Tonks I believe.”
Draco reached down and took Harry’s hand and smiled, “I am happy, very much so.”
Malfoy’s eyes flew open. “Potter? What-“ He trailed off.
Harry sighed, rubbing his eyes beneath his glasses. “I’m not allowed, its all classified, you know that. I can’t tell you anything about how I’m going to testify, I can’t even tell you which way I’m going to go.”
His mind just keep turning back to a pair of green eyes framed by round, wire rimmed glasses that only a certain someone was capable of pulling off. His first instinct was to head over to Rise and Grind for a change of scenery to help get the creative juices flowing, but he worried that he might find Harry there. Despite the fact that he was pretty sure Harry had been joking about thinking Draco was stalking, he didn’t want to risk the off chance of Harry genuinely thinking Draco was stalking him.
The four as a group made their way back to their dorms. The girls walked hand in hand in front of Harry and Draco, every so often Pansy would glance back behind herself at them, then whisper to Hermione and the two would giggle.
He went down to breakfast, then straight to Hogsmeade to disapparate.
“I know you. So no. Especially because our going home for the break put us on the Monday morning hall shift.”
Harry balanced the box he was holding on his chest and opened the door. He was met with a song from a local musical blasting while a dark skinned girl danced around singing into her hairbrush. She noticed him and grabbed her phone off the bed to turn the music down.
“Okay, I guess. That’s not what I was hoping for, but it’s better than nothing. Aside from that what should we do this afternoon?”
About twenty minutes later Neville got it, a giant silvery lion bounded out into the room.
“Er, I—” Draco paused. “No.”
“I’ve been thinking that I’m going to keep the teaching position after the two year mark. I know Hermione wants to get out as soon as she can, and very well could be gone for next year, but I really like what I’m doing. The more I’ve thought about it the more I think being an auror isn’t right. Teaching about those damn case reports when most of us have more field experience before graduating than those aurors ever dreamed of has reminded me that I don’t actually need to spend my life fighting evil. I mean, yeah it’s the Defense job, so there will be a bit of that, but it’s more about students, taking the preventative steps and such.” Harry looked up to find Draco staring intently at him while Teddy played with the button on his cloak, “What?”
“Me too.”
—Appie
“She’s not my girlfriend anymore.” Harry said plainly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco was silent for a moment “Well go on then.” Harry needed to get back to his grading, he wanted to finish this one before he went to bed, “Anytime now.”
“That was one of the things they had the waiters do at the restaurant, actually. Along with the fountain drinks. They weren’t as fancy as what you offer here though.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Molly was up early baking something that smelled delicious. Harry followed his nose into the kitchen and took a seat at the table.
Things started to feel like a rhythm by the fourth week of the semester. The oddest part of that rhythm being Draco Malfoy. He tended to study in the cafe. He would spend time in the study nook when it was busy and once foot traffic slowed for the night he would order a hot tea beverage and move to the sofa and spread out his work there.
Hey all I actually wrote this before Friday! What a concept!! Got some interesting stuff for y’all this week.
Potter was still asleep when he got there. How late was he planning on sleeping? He ought to wake soon if he intended on making it to his first lesson on time.
“No it’s not.”
work.
Draco loved his father, and he knew he would eventually forgive him. He just needed some time,
Harry felt Narcissa relax a bit next to him.
The girls had put him in dark jeans and a green shirt that was a shade or two brighter than Slytherin green, it set off his eyes he supposed. Hermione had tamed his hair, well tamed being relative, it looked like it was messy on purpose rather than a rat’s nest. Luna had rolled up his sleeves to show his forearms, and made the buttons gold. She had put matching gold glitter in his hair. He thought it was a little excessive, but grinned and bore it. Ginny had spelled all the dings and scratches of the past year from his glasses, and added a gold spiral pattern to one of his back pockets. The top couple of buttons on his shirt were left undone.
“It’s okay.”
“And now for the easiest part of this whole ordeal.” Malfoy started, holding a snitch “Who’s going to play seeker? I will watch three seekers games, you will all play at once. Though I will eliminate as we go. If some one catches it twice, they will be seeker, if not, I will make my choice off of what I see. I call your name you’re out.”
Draco knew there were several people who would be testifying, but he didn’t know who, aside from Potter, of course. Then one of the ministry members was speaking, “We will move forward with our first witness, Amycus Carrow.”
Draco was shocked when he found that the class would be focused around occlumency and legilimency, for the next few lessons. This was something Draco was rather skilled at and Harry... let’s just say it wasn’t one of Harry’s strengths. Granger, on the other hand had mastered it with ease within a few mere weeks. Draco still had trouble sometimes comprehending how Granger had ended up in Gryffindor and not Ravenclaw.
All thoughts of the date he needed to plan went on the back burner as the tournament loomed before them. More than sixty schools would be attending this year, a higher turnout than ever before. Other colleges likely thought that they might just stand a chance now that the old coach was gone. Draco couldn’t help but wonder if that ideology held some merit.
He moved stiffly, ever closer and then he was bending down in front of Potter, for this was unmistakably Potter. Just say no, come on, please, say no. Say no. “I don’t know.” ‘Damn you!’ Draco thought to himself.
Draco was glad that Harry was putting the past behind him, but he wasn’t too fond of the comparison Harry had drawn between him and Weasley.
“And what did you think of him?”
Then they were lead on a tour of campus by an upperclassman named Jennifer, who said she was an architecture major. She skipped some of the history that had been standard on the tour Harry had gone on when he was college searching and instead told stories and traditions about some of the places they passed.
“When did you do all this?” Draco asked, still gaping at the hall.
Maybe it was the newfound truce or Harry’s tired state, but he went the truth. “Nearly everyone I know has had terrible nightmares this summer. It became normal to wake someone up from them.” He took a breath then added “I get them too.”
One day Harry noticed Draco staring, rather overtly, at him during the eighth year DADA class. Hermione seemed to notice too because she promptly called on Draco. It was funny, really, had Harry been the one talking Draco probably would know what was going on, but since it was Hermione he was utterly sidetracked.
His body craved the routine motion. It was... reassuring, in a way.
“Your hair looks fine, let’s get going.” Harry whined.
“I will be. It hadn’t been going well for a while, at least we know we weren’t meant to be.”
It didn’t matter that they had been friends, had been the very best of friends.
“Fine.” He rolled his eyes and came over to help.
“Yeah, she told me she started dating someone named Jules but she didn’t specify pronouns... and she’s pansexual, so I have no idea.” Daphne explained.
He’d gotten them and was on his way back when his phone started to ring. He stared at it and let it ring all the way through as his father’s contact photo peered up at him. Finally it finished ringing and the photo disappeared. Draco sighed and resumed walking down the street. A minute later he received a notification that a voicemail message had been left for him.
Harry was dressed nicely in a red button down and his warmest, yet still nice looking, pair of pants. He had decided not to touch his hair, it wouldn’t do any good anyways.
“It was a requirement for me, but I didn’t hate them.”
Everyone took to the skies, searching for the snitch while Malfoy sat on his broom and watched. After about ten minutes, he called, “Weasley and Pansy.”
When he walked in, she offered him a hopeful smile. He knew that she, maybe more than himself, had hoped today would go well. “You were gone a long time,” She remarked, as the auror, who had switched out with Jess, stepped out of the room to offer them some privacy.
The Headmistress strode in and took a seat. Like with his mother, the chains stayed hidden, and didn’t wrap around her.
“Whatever you say.” She smirked, “Goodnight.”
Timber Coast University had won that tournament consecutively for the past three decades, to lose now would be tainting that entire legacy. It was a lot of pressure, especially on their coach. It was her first year coaching at TCU after the coach who had led the team to victory for all thirty years had retired.
“What happened?” Harry asked.
“I don’t really care.”
Enjoy!
“Don’t be I wasn’t looking. You wanna walk with me for a bit?”
“I love you,” He whispered, “See you for Christmas.”
“Did you say Andie and Cissa?” Draco asked.
“I would love to.”
Harry turned to Draco to watch his reaction.
“Didn’t you think he was cute when you first met him?”
“Everything is fine, dear. I love you.”
“When was Mr. Malfoy made into a death eater?”
“We’ll talk in the morning, Draco. Go to bed.”
“Let’s just sleep it off, we can talk in the morning.”
“Room nine!” The hat called. So, Daphne and Padma then. Draco idly wondered what they could possibly have in common.
“What?” His father asked, stumbling to a halt mid-rant.
Embarrassment filled Draco at his unruly mind, as he quickly shoved the thoughts away. He had always managed to hide that side of himself, he wouldn’t allow those thoughts to intrude now. No one could ever know... especially not Potter.
It was just as they were finishing eating that the argument erupted at the other end of the table. Hermione and Ron were arguing again, soon enough they were yelling. Harry had no idea what it was about, because Teddy started crying, his hair turning a sickly shade of red. Instead of trying to be peacemaker for his friends once again, he took the crying baby into the other room to try and calm him.
Harry met Sirius at the local supermarket and bought what he thought he needed.
Draco was a nervous wreck. He hadn’t spoken to Harry at all since their ‘fight’ and now he had no idea what to expect. He paced back and forth in the hall. Nymphadora’s auror friend was back, she’d been the one to escort him here today, but she hadn’t been alone. Two other Aurora had joined them in Hogsmeade. The three of them seemed friendly with one another, but Draco wasn’t sure how that would translate over to him.
Then she released him and was launching into the arms of a very tall and very pretty girl. When they separated she turned to Draco and smiled. “You must be Draco! Pansy has told me so much about you. It’s so nice to meet you!”
Slowly, his father turned around to face him. A soft smile broke across his face as his father saw him for the first time in over a year. “Draco.” The word was barely a whispered breath. “Oh, my son.” He stood and moved until he less than a foot away from Draco. “I thought I would never see you again!”
Draco rolled over and stared up at Harry “I meant it. I love you. I think I have for a while now.”
He needed to remember that at least Azkaban no longer had the dementors, so it might not be complete torture, should be be locked up. No, he couldn’t think like that, like he had already received a life sentence.
The auror had shown polite curiosity when she’d seen that Draco had received a letter from the one and only Harry Potter, but she hadn’t pried or forced him to hand it over as many of the other aurors he had encountered thus far would have done. And he was glad for it.
And then finally, Harry’s letter of return was there.
And that was how they ended up in the local drugstore searching for chocolate to buy for Harry. When they finally found something suitable they went to checkout. The cashier was an older man with a wispy mustache and balding gray hair. “Aw, well aren’t you two a lovely couple?” He turned to Pansy and said, “You are quite lucky to have a young man like him buying you chocolates.”
His confidence in the team fluctuated constantly, resulting in him telling each person a different thing. If they all got together and discussed Draco’s responses, they’d find that he really had no idea how it was going to go.
“Your invisibility cloak? Dumbledore gave that to you?”
Next was an easy win, with their pairing being Ardenth College. It was a mystery to how they’d made it as far as they did without being defeated. Draco didn’t even break a sweat against them. The semifinals had them up against Shade Creek College, whom they beat with only a slight effort on their part. Unsurprisingly, their rivals, Cadence University killed the Malcolm Institute for Architecture and Engineering, bumping them straight into the finals.
Potter would always be Potter to him, just as he would always be Malfoy to Potter.
He took the longest shower in the history showers, and found, much to his pleasure, that the auror was gone when he flung the curtain open.
“I like hearing your voice too mom. I like my classes just as much as the next person, but they’re a lot of work- more than I was expecting. But it’s manageable. I’m trying to stay ahead of it, and its going quite well so far. I’m happy with my decision to come here, and I’m making friends. I think you’d really like them.” Draco said as he stuffed his laptop back into its bag and slung it over a shoulder. He transferred the phone back into his hand as he strode down the path back towards the dorms so he could drop off the school stuff and pick up his tennis equipment. “But hey, listen, I’ve got tennis practice in twenty minutes, so I can’t talk long.”
“Can’t you just tell me what I got on the Defense exam already?” Draco asked, they’d already had this conversation a dozen times, though Harry had always managed to distract Draco from seeking his grade.
“So, my uncles are ridiculous and gifted me a bottle of champagne to celebrate making it halfway through the semester. I was wondering if you wanted to come to my room and split it Friday night. You have your last exam that day too right?”
“It was Harry’s idea.” Remus said, “He saw it when we were shopping and thought it’d be good for your dorm.”
“Awww.” Pansy said, “Look ‘Mione, our friends are an old married couple.”
“Draco, you’re drunk, go to sleep.” Harry tried, he wasn’t quite in the headspace for this conversation, not yet at least.
Harry went into their room and found Draco sitting on the edge of his bed, staring straight ahead.
“If we have the day, why waste it?” Draco asked and crossed the room in three long strides. He stood directly in front of Harry and grinned down at him. He took his hand and pulled him up to his feet. “Cone on, don’t be a lazy bum.”
Potter’s wand alarm was going off.
“I don’t think so,” Draco mused, “During the battle of Hogwarts, he saved my life twice, I don’t think he’ll try to kill us.”
It was more than he could have possibly hoped for.
Please leave comments to feed our souls
I’m actually posting my own chapter this week! Whoo hoo! Tay will post hers later.
“Today’s class should be easy,” Hermione went on, “Since none of you have had an actual defense class in at least a year we are just doing a baseline assessment. You will be split into two groups based on room number, I will put you through a theory test.”
The summer flew past, Harry wasn’t sure where it went. He went to visit Draco at least once a week, usually more. His test results came in mid July and he had gotten an outstanding on the Defense test, which meant he qualified to return to teach.
Draco nodded.
“He used the cruciatus curse on the other children, the ones who had broken the school rules.”
“Yes, preferably before you act on whatever you feel towards Draco. He’ll react badly if he finds out both at once, you know he doesn’t handle change well. And I know you feel something, don’t think I didn’t notice you have been saying ‘Draco’ this whole time.”
Harry looked up to see his adoptive uncles staring at him intently, “Fine. I’ll do it.”
Harry did not want to imply that he forgave her. Too many people had pried too far today. “Thank you for the apology.” He turned back to his food and ate in silence.
He pulled away shyly a moment later.
“I got some of your favorites. If you wanna talk I’m here.” Draco whispered into Harry’s dark hair as he slung an arm gently around Harry’s shoulders and held up a bit of fruit to Harry’s lips.
“Sorry.” He said.
They stood awkwardly outside room seven, almost waiting for something to happen.
“What? Oh, sorry. I was lost in thought I guess. Could you repeat the question?”
“Thanks, but I don’t actually want it, nor does anyone else want me to have the job.” Draco mumbled, picking at his fingernails. “You can have it.”
“No I’ll answer. You can pry a bit, we’re friends now, remember. I have to finish closing though so if I walk away while I’m talking that’s why.”
Draco desperately wanted to accept the offer, simply to spend time with Harry, no matter what they did, he liked being near him. “Sorry, I can’t. I’ve got to go. I have tennis practice.” He said hurriedly as he backed away and practically ran the whole way back to his dorm. He bolted inside and slammed the door shut, leaning his back against it and breathing hard.
It had only been just over a year since Padfoot and Moony had moved in, so they still didn’t quite have set places for everything. It took Harry a good two minutes of opening cupboards to find the one where the pans were now being kept.
Harry smiled at the auror as he passed. The auror gaped at Harry, would people never realize he was literally, just a normal person?
Draco’s step faltered. He ducked his head and said, “Sorry, I’m just worried, is all. What with my mum’s trial coming up and... yeah.” He trailed off, his eyes on the floor. He looked up then, straight into Harry’s bright green eyes, unlike any he’d ever seen, and asked, “You’re testifying, right?”
“And the next time you saw her?”
“He doesn’t like that I chose to go to school here and not somewhere more ‘prestigious.’ He also hates that I’m trying to get a degree in photography.”
Harry then went on to explain what he had seen in the memory from Slughorn and then took guesses as to what the horcruxes were. Once they had finally circled back to Malfoy’s question, the class understood that there was a lot of strategy that went into how they had planned Voldemort’s demise and they were left with more questions for another time. Harry left feeling proud and he hoped Hermione did as well.
“I’m sorry if I did something, said something wrong.”
Harry followed Draco’s gaze and confused etched itself into his features, “What? Hermione and Neville? They’re just friends.”
“Last I saw you didn’t do well.”
Harry didn’t feel like going to lunch that day. It was more facing people than a lack of hunger. The eighth years had somehow gotten to the discussion of the tactics at the battle of Hogwarts, particularly his own death-that-was-not-a-death. Hermione and Ron, the good friends they are tried to steer the conversation to something else in the battle, but it didn’t work.
Draco shook his head, he didn’t want to think about this, not now. It wouldn’t do him any good. “Look, whatever happens, happens. No point dwelling on it. Do you know who else decided to come back?”
“I’m probably not going to join many clubs so I’ll be fine. And the website with the application said Mr. Orange is pretty flexible about hours.”
“Oh.” Draco sounded almost disappointed.
“You suppose? It is very simple Mr. Carrow, did you or did you not threaten him with pain if he did not inflict it upon the other children?”
“She thinks you’d make a cute couple. She’s been dying to have someone to go on double dates with.”
Andromeda was letting Harry have Teddy from Thursday evenings to Saturday evenings. This would probably change provided he was allowed to come back and teach again the following year, but that wasn’t worth thinking about until he got his exam results back.
“I bet if you and Parkinson bonded a bit, you would be unstoppable.” Neville interjected.
Draco nodded.
“I mean, it had been months of not hearing anything from you, then suddenly, you’re found by snatchers and You-Know-Who is on his way to get you. You decide to flee, and then like a week later, we are here at the battle. Why not confront him at the manor? Why not kill him long before that? There must be a reason.”
“Now Mr. Potter, would you please tell us of the crimes Mr. Malfoy has committed.”
It was then that Malfoy realized that Harry had the golden ball in hand.
Near the end of the lesson Hermione called out. “Ok the last thing you need to be able to do is do it under pressure of people watching. Vanish your patronuses, we’re gonna try it one by one.”
“For the first charge those who say guilty please stand.” Harry glanced around at the Wizengamot. Most of them had remained seated. That was good. Killing Dumbledore was the worst charge.
They’d admitted their feelings towards each other… so progress. Harry had feelings for Draco! He still couldn’t really believe it, not entirely anyways.
"Everything." Harry raised the mirror to eye-level once more and he didn't care that he likely sounded like he was pleading. He was. "Draco, please. Tell me what all this is about. If no one else will tell me, you… you have to –"
The girls shared a moment of laughter that sounded a little forced, but Harry didn't mind. His interview with the officers had been awkward, so it wasn't as though he was expecting the one with his friends to be any better.
Jill frowned. "I don't think it's right to assume…"
Draco didn't think he'd ever been less focused on a job in his life.
Sirius had taken him out, as he'd demanded was necessary conduct for the care of his cousin. His
And then the world twisted around him. The road morphed into a whirlpool of disjointed shapes. The familiar twist of Apparition sucked him in and Harry –
Harry's retort died in his throat. Visiting Draco's house. Meeting his family. The thought had played across Harry's mind countless times, but he'd never let himself dwell upon it. It was far too daunting. Swallowing thickly, Harry hitched his shoulders in a tight shrug but otherwise didn't reply.
Despite the absence of magic, however, there was nothing simple or humble about
"That's good," he said, opening his eyes and plastering a smile upon his face. He could do that, and believably too, he knew. There were some benefits, some skills learnt, from being a model. He knew it would fool just about everyone. "I think it's definitely a good idea. I know that all of us – you, Pansy, and me – will probably have to keep our heads under cover and out of the firing line for a while."
"Jackie," Jill said chidingly, while Abel muttered a barely audible, "'M not sensitive."
"Are you kidding me?" Ginny said as she slung her arm around Harry in return. "I'm having a blast. This is so weird, but kind of fun too, you know?"
A hook punch to his waist. A snap of a foot to the side of his knee. Another to his jaw that drove his teeth into his tongue. Draco wasn't sure which one of them forced him to his knees, that had him throwing his hands onto the cement before him to prevent falling further, but it didn't matter. He was down, he knew it wouldn't stop until they were even a little satisfied, and he didn't even hate them for it.
"I take it you forgot too?" Harry asked.
"Isn't it? What if I told you I can do magic, then? That I've
"You're looking at purchasing materials for the presentation and exhibition already?" Pansy asked, speaking up for the first time in almost an hour. Or speaking to Harry and Draco for the first time; she'd commented in return to Jackie's idle ponderings as she flicked through
Draco had been removed from London. He'd been set apart from the British Wizarding world. He knew next to nothing of what had become of that world since the war – of the people who had fought, who had been convicted, who had triumphed and became exalted in their fame – just as he hadn't the foggiest clue as to what had happened to key features of his past.
Picking up his pace further as another woman, one that didn't actually seem to be a witch this time, shot him a frown as though he contaminated the air with his presence. Draco rolled his eyes when she was out of sight. Muggles had even gotten their knickers in a knot over the situation. As the national curiosity that shining star Harry Potter was, the Harry Potter who remained steadfastly loyal to the negligible
Grasping Jacob's wrist, as much to hold himself steady as to loosen Jacob's hold, Harry spared a glance for Draco. "Draco, stop it. It's fine. You just – just go. You'll miss your bus."
, Draco thought to himself. It wasn't only because he was Harry Potter, because he was famous from a walk down more than one avenue, or because he was beautiful, though each element likely contributed. Harry made an impression whether he wanted to or not.
Except that it wasn't private. Not anymore. It was silent, but it wouldn't be for long. The humble detachedness of the cottage that was so removed from the surrounding village of Godric's Hollow was on limited time. Had been on limited time.
Draco was a coward. He knew he'd been a coward, and that he still was. But who out of everyone he knew, who besides Harry, and Granger, and Weasley, and their chosen posse, weren't?
"You spent most of your time trying to chat up Pansy by showing her gruesome pictures of torture scenes," Draco said dryly, the first he'd spoken since entering the room. Harry flashed him an encouraging smile and was rewarded again when Draco offered a small one in return.
Draco sniffed, and what would have once been a gesture of aloofness Harry now interpreted as being a touch of embarrassment. "Sadly, yes. Pureblood hierarchies. Don't ask me why it's a thing. It just is."
Hermione cuffed Ron lightly on the back of the head. "You are not dumb. Don't you dare say that. You're one of the smartest people I know, even if you're not good at studying."
Harry frowned. "I don't think so. They're just really friendly."
It didn't fix everything. Harry didn't think anything could. But it soothed like a cool balm on a burn. It helped just a little, but increasingly with every second. Slowly, with reluctant retreat, the abrasive threat of all that the boggart represented faded. Not gone, but sidelined. Not erased but filed back into the depths of Harry's mind from whence it came.
"Safer? At a goddamn boarding school?" Jackie hadn't taken the explanation well. "What, is this like a witness protection program or something?"
Draco wasn't sure how he felt about that. Relieved, he supposed;
"What?" Harry asked, dusting his fingers self-consciously.
"Touché." Harry took a sip of water. "Are you working still? I can go to my room if you'd like."
"I'm sorry, Jill," Jackie overrode her. "I can't hear your objections over the sound of how right I am." With another grin flashed over her shoulder, Jackie propped her feet up on the dashboard where they'd been for the majority of their trip and threw back another handful of jellybeans. A moment later, to the accompaniment of sticky chewing, she continued with another round of, "
"I resent that."
Ms McGonagall was turning away from him even before Harry had agreed, scanning her pool of waiting students. "Granger," she barked. "Weasley."
The crack of Apparition sounded again. The weight of something – an arm? – slung around Harry's neck, pinning against his throat. He jerked to a halt, was all but wrenched from his feet but a forceful tug –
As close as Harry was with his mum and dad, he didn't think he was ready for that. Maybe with Sirius, and probably more likely with Remus given he was the only one who wouldn't poke fun at Harry for admitting that he was maybe a little smitten, but not yet. Not now. Not when –
"Where is that bloody…?" he muttered to himself, turning in place. Only for his frown to smooth and a sigh to slip from his lips when he caught sight of the distant building. Disregarding his watch, he started into the sea of crowd once more.
Harry smiled. "True. I'll think about it. Maybe later."
"Snape was trying to teach me Occlumency. It didn't stick 'cause he was as shit at teaching it as he was Potions, but whatever. No disrespecting the dead or anything. I'm sure he was a great bloke."
Draco should have accepted it was a bad day and decided to go home. To hell too with the interview that he was supposed to film. He didn't even like filming all that much. Photography was his passion, had become his passion. He shouldn't have to side-line it out of necessity.
"Wonderful," the man said, smiling easily as he rose to his feet. "If you please, I won't be a moment. I'll just inform the Madame of your arrival."
It seemed like a story from a fairytale. An admittedly grim tale, but fictional nonetheless.
Harry thought it was rather accurate. His brain had been short-circuiting for nearly an hour.
"Do you like them?"
"Precisely," Calliope said. "Will you let us help you once more?"
"I hate that people see your pictures but don't really see you."
Draco knew that. He knew that Harry didn't hate him, and not just because he'd agreed to accompany him to Switzerland. Not just because he'd stood up for him in the face of nameless aggressors, defending him when Draco couldn't defend himself. Not even because, by and large, every interaction that they'd had was amicable and increasingly comfortable.
"Then we'll dive right into it," Dot continued, planting herself behind her desk with her hands laid flatly on top of it. "I've got a consultation in less than an hour but give it to me now anyway. The bare bones of what you've got planned and what you've come up with. Tell me how you want to handle this and I'll see what I can do."
Straightening, Harry raked a hand through his hair. Only to have it smacked away by the sharp slap of a hand.
"Yeah, I got that. But he was at the feast, so where'd he go?"
At Harry's nod, he shrugged. "Why the bloody hell wouldn't I be happy for them? Why would I be as much so much of a tosser as to have the shits with them for deciding to date another bloke when it doesn't have anything to do with me? It's not like it really changes all that much, right? I mean, they were always hanging out anyway; now they just kiss every now and then, or sometimes they'll share the same bed at night. As long as I don't hear anything, why should I care?"
"Get over yourself," Jackie said, far less indignantly than she would have only a handful of weeks before. Harry wasn't the only one with a crippling crush, after all. "We'll do something fun."
"If I wind down these windows, the entirety of London is going to hear how shit you are at singing," Harry all but shouted to Jackie.
New and exciting, maybe. Astute and reasonable for kids with a sixth form workload? Not so much.
"Ipetsky is known to be an affable enough photographer, and he's good at what he does. Very good. Good enough to get away with certain indiscretions." The scraping of ceramic on wood was a hollow discordance to Draco's words, consistent and hollow. "No one would question him if he chose to act in less that reputable ways. No one would pull him up on it, either. That happens all too often with independent photographers; they have no leash. I would expect that most – most models, or subordinates, or – or apprentices would feel as though they had to…"
"I'm so happy for you," he said. "Even if she is still a bitch."
Draco's crazy aunt.
In an shaking burst he found himself coming in a thick, warm rush into the fist of his hand. A desperate cry spilled forth unbidden, and he wouldn't have cared if the Silencing Charms around Draco's bed had abruptly failed. He wouldn't have cared in the least; not before that all-consuming, euphoric pleasure.
"Why what?"
"I assume from Blaise's lack of taunts and catcalls that he already knew?" Theodore continued. "Should I be surprised?"
"You two are together, I take it?" he asked.
Draco rolled his eyes. "You're a gossipmonger, Pansy. You don't understand the meaning of truth."
Then… that was it.
"You'll tell me if you're uncomfortable?" he said, a question more than a blatant demand. "You'll tell me if something I ask of you isn't to your liking, or makes you feel discomforted in any way?"
"If you like him back," Ron said. He nodded. "Right. I get it now. So, that's what's keeping you up at night? Or at least tonight, that is. Not sure if it's always been that."
"Not gonna lie, it was kind of hot."
"And this one, too. There's even less life to these pictures than Daisy managed."
Malfoy didn't sneer at Ron, or look down his nose at Hermione with mutters of "Mudblood" slipping through his twisted lips whenever they were close enough for her to hear. He didn't hold his head high with his old aloof arrogance, and Harry had noticed a distinct lack of peacock-strutting of late. Granted, being accused of standing on the wrong side of the war, not to mention losing both his parents to incarceration in quick succession, had to have a significant impact on anyone, but… still. Harry hadn't expected it. Not really.
Harry's murmured words drew Draco's attention towards him where it could never drift for long. He was staring out the window once more, but less in awe and wonder this time. He seemed more… contemplative.
"Fucking boarding school sods," Jackie grunted. "Fuck,
"That's the thing, though." Pansy's voice lowered, became suddenly insistent. "Things don't just crop up, Draco. Not for people like us."
“Sure.”
“And finally, those who say Draco Malfoy is guilty of being a Death Eater.” Quite a lot of people stood up. Harry realized that there was no way Malfoy could get away without this charge. “And those who believe he is innocent.” A handful of people stood up. “Let the record show that Draco Malfoy is guilty of being a Death Eater.”
Pansy stormed in and grabbed Draco’s laptop.
He thought it was best to get the class out of the way, as quickly as possible. He skimmed through the rest of his classes for the day and then headed back up to his shared dorm room.
“Are we doing practical stuff today? I don’t think dueling’s all that good for today.” Draco leaned against the wall, looking bored.
About twenty minutes later Neville got it, a giant silvery lion bounded out into the room.
Blaise nodded, “They’ve certainly got the experience and the skill. Otherwise how could they have broken into Gringotts and escaped on a dragon?”
“You’re drunk.” He said flatly.
He was asleep within minutes.
He made his way down to the Great Hall. It was strange to him, going down from a tower, rather than up from the Slytherin common room in the dungeons.
While I was proud of my last chapter I think I am more proud of how Tay and I’s chapters coordinated this week. Hope you like it please remember to leave comments and Kudos!!!
“I still am a death eater, ain’t no ‘was’ about it. And that little git wasn’t no real death eater. He never did nothing if he wasn’t told twice first.” Dolohov growled, voice raised and Draco flinched a little.
Her response came nearly instantaneously.
Next up were the keepers. Longbottom was actually rather good at this and Draco was considering him for the position. But he knew Longbottom would face the same stage fright troubles that Weasley often experienced. But Weasley beat out Longbottom fair and square, he managed to save every goal shot at him. Five down, only the beaters to go. Well, that and the seeker tryouts, but of course, Potter would win.
“What class do you have today?”
He was home alone, well alone if he managed to forget about the auror that followed his every step. It was a different auror now than when he had first returned home. This one was a woman, young and far kinder. She had told him that Tonks had been her friend, that they had trained together and even been in the same year at Hogwarts. It had taken him a moment to realize that Tonks referred to his cousin, Nymphadora.
“I— what?” How did she know that he was gay?
He had the list narrowed down to Abbott, Blaise, either of the Patil twins, but not both since they crowded together too much, or Michael Corner. Abbott and Blaise were better than the others, so they had definitely made it. Now the question was, Padma, Parvati or Michael? He watched them fly for a few more minutes and decided that Padma was superior to her sister. But, he had to admit, Michael did seem to be slightly better than Padma. Then he remembered the rumors he had heard about Michael, about what he had done to a couple of Ravenclaw girls, a couple years below him. Draco didn’t think he wanted someone like that poisoning his team. He wanted everyone to feel safe, so he decided Michael would not be a good fit for the team.
“Yeah.” Harry said and Draco had to hold back his sigh. But then Draco’s hopes lifted as Harry added, “You want me to walk you back to your dorm?”
Draco heard Potter’s sharp intake of breath and knew he hadn’t been quiet enough. But what did they say about alcohol, ah yes,
“Mr. Weasley and Mr. Macmillan.” As Harry payed attention to the duel he noticed that Ron was not good at non verbal spells, but knew more than Ernie. Of course he and Hermione had expected Ron to know more at this point.
The next morning Harry awoke to the alarm on his phone going off. It was six am, his battery life was just hanging on by a less than ten percent thread. He and Draco had been curled up together asleep on the couch. The TV had at least timed out at some point during the night, so at least the noise didn’t keep anyone up. Harry tried to get up but found his arm was trapped under Draco.
“So I applied for a job at that coffee place we went to last night. I should hopefully get a call about an interview soon.”
“Dare, so long as I don’t have to walk long distances in heels again.”
The group laughed at the joke and Malfoy looked relieved.
Harry seemed to notice Draco’s worry because he strode over to him. “What am I doing wrong?” Draco asked, pleading Harry to have some answer.
Harry returned to his seat and then looked around. He realized that it should be Draco’s turn to speak, but Draco was nowhere to be seen.
Harry wanted to pry, but if it had to do with Sirius’s work and it was freaking him out this much, it was probably classified or whatever. He did seem to have enough high spirits to invite Draco over for dinner in a ‘meet the parents’ sort of way.
Malfoy’s letter arrived the morning that he and Hermione were to head back to Hogwarts. Harry figured that it would be easiest to wait and talk to Malfoy in person later that night.
“I guess I’ll see you after the break.” Draco said as he started to walk away.
“Oh, I ended up having nothing on my Monday schedule, though one of the teachers listed on the booklet that if there’s low interest in a class they’d move it to Mondays to free up how many Wednesday classes they teach since it’s an athletics class that meets in the gym.”
Finally it was time for the verdict. The Ministry witch spoke to Draco directly for the first time that day. “Mr. Malfoy, the pending sentence for your crimes, should you be found guilty for all is five years in Azkaban. Should you be found guilty of minor crimes you will be allowed to return to Hogwarts, and will be placed on house arrest for the following six months. To review, you are being tried for murder of Albus Dumbledore, use of the Unforgivable curses, attempted murder of two of your peers and Professor, and the crime of being a death eater.
The city of Timberland was beautiful at night. The streets had trees with twinkle lights in them at regular intervals and some of the bigger office buildings in the distance had colored lights. By city standards, Timberland was a quiet costal city with the lake reflecting the city lights off in the distance. There were a few people around, Harry and Hermione even passed a group of university students that were clearly out to party that night.
that floated just above the floor, glowing warmly. The ceiling was a stunningly clear view of the whole night sky. Harry had modified the spell to show the sky above the clouds, that would wear off by the morning.
“Yeah, you’ll probably have to take it for your anthropology major.”
Draco was about to turn away when his eyes caught on a startling pair of green eyes. They belonged to the same boy he had encountered a few other times since moving into his dorm. The boy had messy dark hair and was quite attractive. He was with that same girl as always and Draco idly wondered if they were a couple. It was surprising to find how much that thought upset him. He had barely even had a conversation with him. And he didn’t so much as know either of their names, so he really had no right to be jealous of her, especially when he wasn’t even sure if they were dating.
Hey Everyone! I hope you like the story! This is my first time doing a collaboration, so I hope it goes well! Enjoy :) This chapter is my writing.
(See the end of the chapter for
The car sat in silence for a while. Harry, Hermione, and Ron had helped with the repair efforts on the castle, but everyone seemed a little shocked that they were actually going back.
“Harry!” Draco exclaimed, surprised to see his boyfriend here, two days before their planned date.
Draco nodded.
“Your wand alarm went off.”
Harry sat down and finally started his letter for Draco. He attached his present for him to it as well. He had found a pair of hyena shaped cuff links, and a matching pin for Draco’s cloak. Harry wasn’t sure why they made him think of Draco, but he knew as soon as he saw them that they were perfect.
Carefully, he removed Harry’s arm, which had been draped around him, and settled it onto the bed before sliding his feet onto the ground. He stood and stretched, padding over to the bathroom to wash.
“No, I am just fine, Potter.”
“You better not. Draco, you can come out now.”
Potter sighed and grabbed Draco’s arm, “Then I guess we will just have to celebrate in the common room.”
“Hi Draco, it’s your father. I’m sure you know that though since you probably watched the phone until it stopped ringing. Listen, your mom didn’t want me to tell you this, but it’s getting to the point where you need to know. Mom’s cancer came back Draco, and its worse this time, with her being older and the stress… the doctors don’t know how much time she has left, they don’t think she’ll be able to fight it off this time. You need to come home, at least to say goodbye- just in case.” His voice broke on the word goodbye and Draco was left standing on the bustling sidewalk, a bag filled with clay dinosaurs in one hand and the sound of that broken word ringing in his ears.
“You sure?”
“Nope, you get a do over of what tonight was supposed to be.”
Draco slipped out of the bathroom and crossed their room, the only light came in a strip through the window, from the moon. He settled himself into his bed and found that he could not fall asleep. For hours he stared up at the ceiling, his mind racing with every thought he had suppressed for his entire life. The dam had opened and now he was drowning. He turned onto his side and looked at Harry, whom had been sound asleep from the time Draco had started his shower.
“Go ahead Mrs. Tonks.”
“You must be Hermione.” Remus said.
Hermione pulled her blanket a little tighter, it had gotten a bit cooler as they were nearing a hall with quite a few of the ghosts.
Harry fought the urge to blush.
As the first week of February drew to a close, Harry realized that Valentine’s Day was only a week away. During a rare moment of free time on Saturday, Harry slipped out to Hogsmeade, a glamour hiding his face, and bought a single red rose. He returned and wrote a quick note tying it to the stem and then he placed it on Draco’s pillow.
“Can’t I just be excited about the new term?”
“That’s cute.” She smiled, “Okay I’m going Blaise don’t give me that look.” She grabbed her shoes that she had ditched at some point and headed out to the bookstore.
“Draco was given the Dark Mark when my husband, Lucius, failed to acquire the prophecy regarding the Dark Lord and Harry Potter. The Dark Lord set Draco with a task he knew Draco would be unable to do, as punishment, he hoped Draco would die in his attempt to kill Dumbledore.” Draco’s mother explained.
As he stepped off the train at King’s Cross, Harry knew that there was a good summer, and hopefully a good year ahead of him.
“I was under the impression that I could testify as I please. Therefore I will tell you that I do not believe Draco has committed any serious crimes.”
Once it was the beaters turn, Draco faced a great shock. Granger was incredible. Who would have thought? So was Pansy, but she had always rather enjoyed hitting things. None of the other applicants were anything special, so Granger and Pansy, it was.
“That’s fine. I don’t think the wrong glasses will ruin dorm room champagne.” Draco took his glass.
The two walked out the dorm and down the hall. Harry noticed a blond guy carrying a box into his dorm down the hall, he looked a bit dejected. Harry was going to say something to him in an attempt to get to know his new neighbors, but then Hermione pulled him in the opposite direction.
Teddy smiled and his hair changed from its inconspicuous brown to a black tangled mess that matched Harry’s.
“Yeah I guess. I saw a notification for the news app on my phone saying we’re advised to be wary because there’s rumors of the criminals planning to widen their scope.”
“It’s okay.” Harry said, smiling faintly.
Draco was determined to stay sober, however Harry seemed to have a differing idea of how to conduct himself. Throughout the night, Draco watched Harry down more alcohol than he could count. A little past one in the morning, Draco determined that Harry had had enough.
Amycus Carrow strode out, perfectly at ease with the chains entrapping him. He settled himself into an adjacent chair.
Draco was too shocked to cheer, to shocked to do anything more than gawk at the two as they took their places at the staff table.
“What?”
He watched Harry making his way down the stairs, to him. When Harry reached him, Draco asked, “You helped me?”
He set an alarm on his wand and settled in for a quick nap. He had just gotten comfortable when Malfoy entered the room looking distressed.
Draco contemplated that. Would the others stay? They had stayed last year, but that had been to try and protect the students. But, what would happen, now that the danger had passed? How would he be treated by the other students? After everything that had happened, he knew he deserved whatever he got. Would they turn the other way when they saw him coming? Whisper behind his back? Or would they mock him? Try to kill him?
“That sounds fun, and I think I’ll come people watch for the yoga class. And I’ll probably find something to do this afternoon. Maybe meet up with Sirius.”
Draco reminded himself that Harry had said Granger was like an older sister to him.
Harry was quiet, wanting Draco to continue.
“Well, I haven’t really talked about it with anyone besides Ginny. And now you.”
The rest of the school year passed in a blur of spring rains, summer air, stolen moments and late nights prepping for N.E.W.T.S. Draco and Harry were busier than ever between their classes, lesson plans and Quidditch practices, they hardly had any time for themselves, let alone each other.
He sighed to himself and watched the flames from a nearby candle, dancing and weaving itself through the air. He didn’t know how long he watched it for, and he lost count of how much alcohol he had consumed, but he only stopped drinking and staring, when the light of the candle dimmed and extinguished completely.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah.”
“We all still have NEWTs this spring. Even Harry and I. Also our grade is based on how we correct student assignments. Professor McGonagall said she’d pull an essay from each year a month and base how we were doing on the mistakes we caught, she also will sit in on some of your practical exams.” Hermione continued.
“You know we don’t have to pick for like a week, we can still test out classes.”
“Sorry I don’t have champagne glasses.”
In other news, Tay and I used this week to plan through to the end, and it seems like we’re gonna finish and post the epilouge on Christmas Day! The end is (sadly) in sight, but my has this been fun.
He scanned the options and decided on the churro booth in one corner, since the line was far shorter than any of the others and seemed to be moving rather quickly. They were to the front of the line within minutes. Draco bought churros for them both and they wondered around, admiring the scenery as they ate. Draco was the first to admit it was the best churro he had ever had.
“Is there any family that is going to visit?”
The swim practice ended and Harry went to change in the locker rooms before meeting Hermione outside.
She gestured to the cuff links. “They’re sharp, like tiny swords.”
“Nice to meet you Professor.”
“I have something other than just sitting in the Great Hall planned. I’m not dumb enough to realize that’s not a particularly exciting date.”
“Yes I did. I believe in second chances. And if you were really one of the big bad killer Death Eaters, you likely would have killed me in my sleep by now.” Harry said kindly and Draco wanted to hug him. Harry had saved his life... again. What was this, the third time? “Let’s go back to Hogwarts, I believe we have something to celebrate.” Harry said, offering up his hand. Tentatively, Draco took it and stood.
“And finally for the crime of allowing a terrorist residence in her home and playing part in his schemes.”
That was not what he had been expecting. He faltered, “I, er, what?”
Harry watched as no one stood.
Draco didn’t know what time it was when he woke up. All he knew was that it pitch black and someone was screaming. Thunder cascaded about and echoed off the walls, lightning flashed and the screaming- Potter’s screams- stopped abruptly. With the light, of the continued seconds of lightning, Draco craned his neck, just as Potter awoke from a nightmare.
“So what? It’s bigger than breaking into the Ministry? Bigger than stealing from Gringotts and freeing a dragon? Bigger than fighting You-Know-Who half a dozen times and killing him? You could do all of that and now you’re what? Afraid of a slap on the wrist?” Draco shouted.
Together they left the room and headed for the Great Hall. They thought that no one else in their right mind would be awake so early, so they weren’t careful.
Draco had a hard time packing his trunk. After living with Harry for this long, it was hard to say goodbye, hard to know their time together was coming to an end. He knew that Harry would be able to visit him, they’d be able to have dates and write to each other, but it wouldn’t be the same. Draco wouldn’t wake up next to Harry every morning, wouldn’t fall asleep to Harry’s soft snores.
Harry stayed with Draco and his friends for all of breakfast, laughing and smiling and joking with them. And Draco felt happier than he had felt in a long time. For the first time, he was content. His attention drifted across the room, to the table that used to belong to the Gryffindors. Weasley was sitting with Thomas and Finnegan at one of the table, and on the other end, Granger sat with Weasley’s sister and Longbottom. And, much to Draco’s surprise, Hermione seemed to be sitting awfully close to Longbottom, a little closer than a pair who were strictly friends would sit.
“I think I’ve loved you for a while now too.” Harry smiled.
Draco stepped out of the door and smiled. He was gorgeous, he wore a pale blue shirt, buttons done up and neatly pressed. He wore black slacks, his hair done to perfection.
He pushed the door to the courtroom open and stepped through. All eyes turned to him while he fought the urge to roll his own. He briskly walked to the place where the witnesses and character advocates sat. He quickly took his seat between McGonagall and Narcissa Malfoy, who had an auror seated on her other side.
“This is my stop.” Harry stood by the door awkwardly.
“Yes.” Draco said. It was the first word he had spoken all day.
He just hadn’t been able to tell Draco about that stuff yet.
He was pleased to find that the few people occupying the tables inside the small cafe were seated far from the cash register and counter where Harry was stationed. He grinned when he spotted Draco making his way too him and didn’t even ask what Draco wanted, he just made it and passed it to him without a word.
He supposed from an outsiders prospective it could seem like he was dating Pansy, but that was different. She was a lesbian and he was gay… they’d never be a thing. But those two, Draco had no idea. They didn’t have that couple look about them, but looks could be deceiving. His heart stuttered a little when he realized that the pair of them were drawing nearer to him. Quickly he fumbled around for a drink. Helpful as always, Pansy pushed one into his hand and he gulped it down quickly, nearly choking on it as it stung his throat. It tasted cheap and disgusting- exactly what Draco had been hoping for.
“Would you ever consider joining a sorority?” Draco asked as they settled the boxes onto the ground.
“How many people have you seen die at her hand?”
“No, I’m not, and I’m serious. I only had one drink, I swear.”
No, he had touched Potter... and he hadn’t been disgusted by it. It hadn’t been to taunt or harm him either. What was wrong with him? Potter was his enemy, foe not friend.
“Not closely.” Draco admitted.
“Six am?” Harry supposed he could make that work, he was usually up for a morning runaround then, “I think Thursday would work.”
All of the eighth years were in higher spirits after winning the house cup and the Quidditch Cup (yes they did that) and they seemed to have forgotten any animosity that they had held towards Draco. Though Draco suspected that their new found friendliness had something to do with all of the Daily Prophet’s articles regarding his relationship with Harry.
“Of course.” Draco replied and some of the tension left his body. A part of him had been worried that Harry would think back on the events of last year’s war and recall the hatred he had felt towards Draco. Then we would remember that he was a death eater and decide it was best if they broke up. But Harry wanted to eat with him, Harry wanted his company!
“Well, here we are, your last first day of Defense Against the Dark Arts. I honestly hope that, unless you plan on joining the Aurors next year, you will never have to use anything we teach  you outside of this room. We’ve all had enough defending ourselves for one lifetime.” Harry started, “First things first, we do not expect you to call us Professors, that will only be for years one through five for now. However, we do reserve the right to mete out punishments if you decide to be disrespectful during class.”
Harry was the Godfather of Draco’s deceased cousin’s son, for one thing. Granger and Weasley had broken up and now she was staying with Harry, for another. Draco wasn’t sure how to feel about either of those things. He had always been wary of the relationship between Harry and Granger, and with them staying in the same house...
“I don’t hate horror movies.”
“Thanks!” He called back and then she was gone, the door clicking softly shut behind her. Draco turned his attention to Blaise and asked, “And how has your mom been about all this?”
“I dare you to kiss Hermione, providing she consents of course.”
Draco sighed to himself.
—Tay <3
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna shared a compartment on the train ride back from King’s Cross. Hermione and Neville were deep into discussion about some plant and Ginny and Luna were curled up next to each other by the window. Ron was still oblivious to the fact that Luna and Ginny were most certainly an item, and Harry wasn’t gonna state the obvious.
Harry sent the letter off with his new owl Leo. It had been hard getting a new owl last summer, but he found it hard to function in society without it. He had also had to put up filters on his mail keeping out fan and hate mail.
“Yeah. How’d you know that?”
Shouldn’t Draco get a gift? Harry thought. They were after all roommates, and maybe even friends.
“Fine.” Draco sighed and sat back down again. He curled up under the blanket next to Harry.
Soon enough both Harry and Malfoy had fallen asleep while staring at the calming starry sky.
“You want me to walk you back to your dorm?”
His father wouldn’t accept that answer, he was too anxious to get into the Dark Lord’s good graces again. “But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!” Why couldn’t his father understand that Draco didn’t want to be a part of this?
Draco instead looked to his watch, which sat upon his nightstand. It was battered and cracked, but it was his. He picked it up, almost tenderly, and clasped it around his wrist.
“No idea,” said Ron, “Not that I really care.”
After dinner was finished, Harry waved his wand and set the dishes to washing themselves over the sink. Then the pair of them took their leave, curling up together in Draco’s bed. “I love you.” Harry whispered, his face buried in the crook of Draco’s neck.
“What about you sonny?” The man turned to Harry.
A few minutes later there was a knock at the door.
“I’m sorry this isn’t exactly the date I had planned.”
“Well, Harry and I wanted to keep it a secret, until the opening feast. Though I guess I just spoiled that didn’t I? And well, Harry has already run the DA which is the same as the practical side of class. Professor McGonagall decided that I would help him since we both still have our courses to take and I did just as well on the theory.”
“Not much to tell, my dad was killed when I was little, don’t have much memory of him.”
At nine on the dot the Ministry witch in charge of the trial started through her spiel. Harry mostly tuned it out, it was pretty much just stuff for the records and he had heard a version of it at every trial he had attended thus far. After that was over the doors banged open and in came Malfoy. He was being escorted by a pair of aurors who stood at a respectable distance from him. Malfoy held his head high and sat in the designated chair. Chains came up and bound his arms and legs.
All of the “eighth years” were gathered in a side corridor, sixteen of them in all. McGonagall’s eyes were scanning everyone, making sure everyone was there, and they spent longer than was strictly necessary, examining Draco. He couldn’t look her in the eyes, not after everything that had happened.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sighed. How could he sum up years of denied friendship, rivalry, jealousy, unrequited love, resentment, annoyance, and even at some points, hatred, in a way that she would be able to understand. “We’re roommates.”
And Draco knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that those three days were the very best days of his entire existence.
He made eye contact with Hermione across the hall, who was talking with Neville, as Ron went into a story of a quidditch match he had played in the snow with his brothers New Year’s Eve.
“No it’s fine. I just feel so disconnected from him that I have no idea how to feel.”

—Tay :)
After all was said and done dinner was admittedly a success. Remus and Sirius seemed to like Draco, and Sirius also seemed to have whatever burden from work he was carrying lightened off his shoulders, at least for a little while.
Sorry that it’s a little late. My fault completely. Appie had her chapter ready on time, meanwhile I procrastinated and then had writer’s block when I actually sat down to write it. Sorry about that! Anyway, I hope you enjoy!
“The Patronus Charm.”
He crumpled up the letter and began a new one.
Then there was the matter of telling him about his relationship with Harry. Upon request, Draco’s mum had not mentioned Harry to his father on any of their visits, and Draco was determined to tell him today.
Harry put the pasta in the pot and pressed pause on the music as he sat down at the kitchen table. Sirius came down and vented about some of his coworkers for a while. Remus came home half an hour later and complained about the midterms he had to grade.
“Finally! The amount of staring and tension between you two these past few weeks was driving me insane, what’d he say?”
Harry headed down early to make the popcorn. He had volunteered mostly because many of the others were terrified of burning it and setting off the smoke alarms.
“Go ahead. I’m not about to say no.”
“Bye.”
“They’re just so perfect.” Draco said, getting more and more worked up with each word. Then he muttered something that Potter almost missed, but not quite. “Makes it so hard to not kiss you.”
“Back again?” Asked Mr. Orange
Next to him Pansy and Hermione were cuddling and looking away at the same jump scare moments, they really were meant to be. On his other side Draco appeared to be attempting to hide under the blanket without being conspicuous.
“Huh?” Harry looked up from his meal.
All of breakfast was spent with the four of them huddled together at the corner of what had once been the Slytherin table. Draco recounted the entire story, with many interrupted questions from the other three.
“I’ve missed you too, dad.” Draco returned as they broke apart.
He nodded.
“I’ll take a break after midterms.”
The two started to go over their lesson plans for the day. Slowly, but surely the rest of the student body started pouring into the Great Hall. The teachers then went through the ritual of handing out schedules.
A soft tune played from a phonograph in the corner, Harry had pulled Daphne Greengrass aside one day to ask about Draco’s music taste. He had found a record with a bunch of good date songs that were both wizard and Muggle, the Wizarding ones including some of Draco’s favorites, according to Daphne.
“What do you mean minding her own business?”
Please leave Comments they are super helpful and fun to read!
Harry placed the not on Draco’s pillow and promptly fell asleep.
“Damnit, so it’s really not Granger then? But Potter, I can see it. It still makes more sense than Weasley,” Pansy said with a grin.
—Appie
“They really are.” Hermione agreed.
“He came out to me about thirty seconds later, so I’d say he’s fine with it.” Shit. He really shouldn’t of said that. Draco didn’t trust Ron, and the jury was out on Hermione. “But do not let him know I told you. He will likely seek vengeance if he found out I told you without his permission.”
“But we’re in public and—” Harry had crossed over and shut Draco up with a kiss.
“And you are happy with Harry, are you not?”
“It’s okay Draco. Really. Thinking about them doesn’t hurt as much as people think it does. I really don’t remember them enough to truly miss them.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Visibility was steadily shrinking, so much so that after another hour, Draco couldn’t see from one end of the pitch to the other. He doubted that the spectators were enjoying their time, drenched and unable to see what was happening.
“You were having a nightmare. Do you want to talk about it? No, wait that was probably a stupid question, we’re not exactly friends.” Harry winced at his words internally, why did he have to say that?
Harry sighed and stood up to take his seat in the witness chair, somehow they had added a new title to him since the last trial. Granted it was one he had held for nearly eigtheen years, but he had figured they decided it didn’t count at the last trial. Apparently the boy who lived would be his title for life.
“Well I have to go on a run, and you’re laying on my arm.”
“Oh, uh, eight?” Harry responded easily, turning back around to face Draco as he did. “I’m not quite sure when Hermione is going out, but she’ll probably be gone by then.” He reached into the little bakery display case and pulled out a blueberry muffin, passing it off into Draco’s open hand.
Draco was relieved that the tryouts were over, now he just had to get through practices... and games... and team celebrations... and the entire rest of the year... not to mention his trial. Suddenly it all felt like so much to bare.
“See?” She said, “Only you know what you plan to say.”
“And your whole family was at the Battle of Hogwarts, correct?”
Draco stared at it in disbelief for a moment, then vanished it and came over to Harry, “I did it.”
“I’m an idiot.” Ron said with a small smile, “I should have seen it earlier.”
“You returned to them for the holidays though, is that correct?”
“I’ll work on it.” Harry laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Where?”
He already had decided not to go to classes. He had friends taking notes to send to him or recording the lectures that day. Harry walked over to Sirius and Remus’s place alone and joined them when they got in the car. The three rode in relative silence for two hours.
He set up a word document on his computer and named it green. It became a sort of dumping ground for all things Harry related. Every little thing that Harry mentioned liking or being interested in went into the document. Within those initial two weeks of brainstorming, Draco filled pages and pages with things Harry had said and did. Thousands of words dedicated to planning out their special date.
Everyone filed into the Great Hall. Draco’s eyes widened to see the colors mixed together. Red, yellow, blue and even green at every table. Draco trailed behind Blaise and Pansy and sat between them. He stared into his empty plate. But he could see his reflection in the glass, so he redirected his gaze to the staff table. It was half empty, he counted and found five empty seats. Professor Sprout was there, as were Flitwick, Trelawney, Hagrid, McGonagall, Vector and Sinistra. Draco knew they needed a new teachers for potions, transfiguration, defense against the dark arts and muggle studies. But who would the final seat be occupied by.
Hope you like it.
“Less than you, no doubt.” Draco shot back, quickening his steps to fall in beside her.
Of course, there was a party in the eighth year common room waiting for the team when they got back. But Draco wasn’t really in the mood to party, he just wanted to celebrate with his boyfriend... in their room. But Draco was the captain and he had to stay, at least for a little while. Many of the seventh years from the various houses had found their way up to the common room and joined in the festivities, even Ginny, despite her loss had decided to join in.
"Draco," Jill murmured, gaze glazing as she lost herself in thought. "So everyone else…?"
Besides, James was right in that regard. Harry didn't think he was especially skilled at many things but running he could do.
a prejudiced arsehole. What do you call all that 'Muggle' crap you were going on about last week."
It wasn't much, but it was enough. Enough that Harry could gather himself once more. Being the only one disconcerted made it so much harder, but when it was the both of them?
Harry snorted under his breath. "Got the 'rough' part right." He kept his voice low enough that Jackie could pretend she didn't hear him, however, and turned his attention back to the road ahead of him. Not that it was really needed. Inner city traffic on a Saturday was far from thinned of the masses.
Closing his eyes, he sank back onto Draco, moving his hips with each thrust that gradually smoothed, gradually fell into a rhythm that became increasingly easier to bear. His hand unerringly sought his own arousal, and in time with Draco's thrusts, with his own rocking motions, he jerked himself off to the heart-throbbing beat of pleasure.
It was impossible not to smile at that. Warmth welled in Harry's chest and he found himself reaching for Draco's hand, threading their fingers as he pressed a kiss upon his cheek. In public places, he still felt a little wary in doing so, but between the emptiness of the street and the twitch of Draco's smile it was worth it.
Jackie snorted. "Seriously."
"Not really."
"Even smiling feels weird, though."
"Yeah. It's funny, you know – every decision made that wound me up in a pickle seems to have been entirely my fault."
Slowing in step, Draco cast a glance towards the last of the departing group ahead of them. He met the eyes of one as they tossed him a moment of their attention over their shoulder, but only nodded in reply to the unspoken question before disregarding them and watching them disregard him in turn. Instead, Draco turned towards Harry and properly paused in step.
"Already?" Blaise said, though he yawned a moment later. "Isn't it a requirement of high schoolers to stay up as late as possible?"
"I didn't use you as a beard."
Pansy's eyes narrowed. "Not right?"
"Ron?"
"Hey," Harry said, meeting Draco for a kiss. He dropped into the chair at Draco's side. "Have you guys had lunch?"
The bathroom, in contrast to the hallway, was wide, refined, and smelt remarkably clean for a men's restroom. All dark tiles, contrastingly pale bench and matching faucet. The doors of the cubicles were actual doors rather than the half-sized impressions reminiscent of school restrooms. But Draco hardly noticed. How could he notice when Harry, the 'different' Harry that seemed to immediately demand his attention when he saw him, was right before him?
Harry felt a shadow of warmth trickle into his chest, almost immediately chewing away at the wash of coldness he hadn't properly realised suffused him from the moment he'd stepped back into Hogwarts' castle. Hermione was far from a vibrant, eccentric person, and of everyone in the room likely favoured the colour palette the most, but she was trying. She'd already turned to the fireplace and cast a spell, an unexpectedly vivid splash of red, purple, and green erupting and immediately setting to burning the logs within.
"It's a school for prats," Jackie said, her words little more than a grunt. "Sounds like you'll fit right in."
"Well, we're not working over our holidays," Jackie said, snapping her book closed. "That's not what Christmas is for."
"What concerns me," Lily continued as if he hadn't spoken, "is that Remus says you've been spending time with a boy that he didn't recognise at the library. Or at least didn't recognise from afar. Is that right, Harry?"
And woven throughout it all,
He was still considering, turning over the possibility and what he could do about it, when a sharp finger flicked his temple. Jolted from his distraction, he frowned at Jackie where she'd planted herself alongside him, only to sigh in defeat a moment later.
"You're smiling," Remus said, dragging Harry's attention back to the dining room and the conversation James was having with Sirius through the living room wall. Something about chips still. "Is study all of a sudden enjoyable?"
"Harry, I was happy to have you passing out drunk in my lap before you even had the faintest notion of considering caring for me in return," Draco replied, his own hand returning to threading through Harry's hair. "I think I've managed the worst of it."
"You know," he said, his face so close to Draco's that their noses brushed, that he barely needed to whisper, "we've still got three hours to morning, apparently."
Harry sat and waited. Even in the stagnant emptiness of the room, devoid of immediate threat, he'd never been more terrified in his life.
That chill, sweeping through him and freezing the pit in his belly, was unlike any anger Harry had really felt before. It wasn't of the kind he was still distantly familiar with. It was… it was…
were famous. And that I can't believe that you're – you're
She knew in that moment. She knew with utter certainty that she would leave the Wizarding world, and she would take her son with her. She knew then, too, that she wouldn't be doing it alone.
"I know, I know." If anything, Von's expression twisted further. "I'm grateful and all."
blind.
Eyes squinting open to peer between heavy lids, Draco half turned his head to make a poor attempt at peering over his shoulder. "Are you awake?"
Incidents."
"Duly noted."
Harry shrugged again, absently flicking Draco's fingers with his thumb. He had beautiful fingers. Long and thin, perfect for dancing around the head of a camera. Perfect for caressing skin too, as Harry was abruptly all too aware of.
Huffing once more, Pansy propped a hand on her hip. She cast a frustrated glance around the empty room that was Draco's pseudo-office, towards the dressing room over her shoulder that Draco had seen Harry leave barely minutes prior, before resettling her gaze upon him.
"Thank you?"
"Not if I wanted us to actually survive," Harry said, slipping from dodging sluggish traffic to ducking between the school of swimming pedestrians. He paused in the gutter as a cluster of school kids at least three years younger than him passed in a chorus of chatter and laughter. "It's still too soon after you almost killed me the first time I let you drive me to school."
All of it was plain. Plain and boring and not because Harry had been attending the school for five years already. Potting Point didn't do 'exciting', and that commitment was embraced by its schools, too. The most adventurous it ever got was the occasional disco and the Year Twelve Muck-Up Day, which largely consisted of said year twelfth students simply roaming the open corridors of the school and making noise.
"Hello," Harry said, offering a small smile. He held out a hand. "Sorry, I don't speak German. I'm Harry. I was watching you before, you're very –"
A job, and likely in Switzerland as Madame Clementine preferred to host her photo shoots.
"Whoa, careful there. Careful."
He woke in a room. Woke, and then stayed there.
He was early. He always was.
He nodded slowly, sitting just as slowly back in his seat. "Alright," he said, folding his hands on the table before him. "If it's upsetting you, I won't call you a Muggle. Even if it's what you are."
But it didn't matter that he wouldn't actually be able to invite Ron along. Dot and Pansy both had spoken of inviting Harry's friends in for a shoot to include in the series, but he had little enough involvement in the decision at this point. Outside of the interview series, it wasn't worth the bother. Ron had about as little concern for fashion and modelling as Hermione, though he did partake of spending on what he termed 'nice clothes' with the money he'd never had before. At Harry's suggestion, however, he only wrinkled his nose and made a retching sound.
"Are you asking for specifics, Granger?"
Hermione wasn't managing so well. Harry knew she still took herself to the library far too often for someone who had finished her exams, and he found her still buried in books more often than not. Ron joined her on occasion, but he was spending more time at the quidditch pitch than he'd been able to before. He and Ginny had taken to one another's company with more jovial commitment than Harry had ever seen of them before, and it was such an unexpected delight to witness that he almost wasn't sad when he couldn't bring himself to join them himself. At least not yet.
"High-born? You have no idea what you're –"
"Wonderful," Hermione said, and she sounded like she really meant it. The way she too shook Jill's hand was almost too enthusiastic, but she sounded like she whole-heartedly meant it when she continued with, "I'm really looking forward to this project."
"Minutes?" Harry said, his voice as shrill in his ears as it was in his head. He shot Terpsichore a frantic glance. The traitor.
It was as much of a welcome as Harry had expected, and he couldn't help but grin. His good-humour felt unshakable that day. "No," he said simply before raising his and Draco's held hand. "Just the one."
He didn't think about Draco and Pansy for the rest of the afternoon. He barely even considered their project at all but to ponder what would be the most effective magic tricks to perform for the presentation. Keeping pace with PJ, he chewed over what little knowledge he had of the matter.
"Wow, has it really been so long?" Hermione had said, shaking her head as she stared at him over the restaurant table, fork forgotten in her hand. "Wasn't Malfoy under house arrest in France for two years?"
"I have some reliable sources."
"Fuck," he muttered.
"Jill, Jackie, this is Ron and Hermione," Harry said, introducing them easily. "I met them this morning."
Pansy nodded. "What was his name? Charles Hawthorn?"
Harry extracted his own wand. "I reckon that sounds like a good idea," he said, sparing a glance for his idling classmates. More than a few smiles – ghostly and small but still smiles – had arisen at Hermione's prompting. "Anyone know any particularly good colouring charms?"
"Yes."
"What?" Harry asked.
Bellatrix twisted his arm. With such speed, so quickly that Harry hadn't even the time to flinch, she swiped the knife across his forearm in a savage slash. Harry gasped as, for a moment, nothing but a perfect line marred his skin. Then the blood welled and another whimper escaped his lips.
"So, it was fairly uneventful," Lily asked, riffling through her papers in a manner of filing understood by her alone
Suddenly, Harry decided he'd had enough. The coldness in his veins abruptly grew hot, the frozen horror of his limbs bunching in readiness. His grasp squeezed one-handed around Jacob's wrist even as his other hand dropped to his own pocket.
"Ron," Hermione said.
Unremarkable, Harry thought. It was a shame that Potting Point couldn't make more of a show for the Hogwarts visitors. Not that he personally felt he needed to compensate for anything, but if Mr. Hastings' announcement speech at the beginning of class was any indication, he was hoping that the misnamed 'exchange program' would be a long-term commitment.
Jackie's mouth opened and closed like a goldfish as she struggled for words. "She - she didn't tell me."
Draco huffed, but there was no scoffing or frustrated retort. Instead, Harry felt the warm press of Draco's lips against his crown, a short kiss loaded with acceptance. "Don't be sorry," he murmured. "Whenever you're ready."
A glaring Jackie could rival Medusa. Harry hadn't ever seen her turn anyone to stone, but he was sure she could manage it. That, or set her victims on fire.
Mr. Hastings was a strange choice for a principal. He was clearly unnerved by the position and just as clearly disliked public speaking. Whenever he climbed up to their clumsy stage, his hands were always clasped together, rubbing and folding against one another as though kneading the nerves from his fingers. His eyes twitched, darting across the audience, and he fumbled his words more often than he successfully linked them together.
"But… why?"
Shucking his bag high onto his shoulders, Harry flew down the footpath in the direction of his school. If he ran fast enough, he might even beat the bus. It wasn't unfathomable; it had happened before in almost identical circumstances. If anything it felt like a challenge that picked up his speed with each step, a challenge that added a spark to properly awaken him for the first time that morning.
It was a sincere struggle to withhold from sinking further into his seat. A flicker of something that felt almost like anger sparked within Harry, but it died just as quickly beneath the familiar weight of resignation. Weeks of interviews and the weariness of constant attentiveness and attention in return had long ago frazzled Harry's nerves in a remarkably different manner to how they'd been in the war. To use anger as a shield, or even as a weapon, was nigh impossible to manage.
"Are you mocking me?"
many, anyway.
Harry laughed a little, and the man's smile widened once more. "Yeah, you and me both."
"The rest of it," he said, his voice unconsciously lowering. "About the magic."
"I don't want him to wake up halfway through the night again," Lily said, scrubbing her face once more.
or whatever it was she'd gotten her hands on that day. The deaths of long-passed queens apparently warranted more attention than school projects.
"You look to be in a foul mood, Pansy," Draco said, stepping up behind one of the remaining chairs and regarding her with a raised eyebrow. "Is the vintage not to your taste? Would you rather find somewhere else to dine this evening?"
"They were on – on the other side." Another swallow, this one only a little easier. "They sided of the Dark Lord."
Hermione's smiled warmly. Why such a statement seemed to satisfy her so much, Harry didn't know, except that it came from Ron and she seemed to be nothing short of smitten whenever he demonstrated any glimpse of his own commitment to schooling. Ron, Harry thought, had realised as well; he was certainly dropping such comments more frequently of late.
"I disagree," Draco replied immediately.
"Are you ready to go, Harry?"
"I don't always study with him, anyway."
"Dickhead."
He never told them his real name. He never shared what he actually did as a profession, and should any of them pry too deeply or learn too much, he erased himself from their memories with a well-aimed
It had been warm. Sincere. Open, and honest, and as firm and steadfast as Ginny was herself. And yet it had been vastly different to every other embrace they'd ever shared, and Harry didn't think it was so much because they were no longer dating. Rather, the difference lay in that, far from sinking into it, Harry had felt the urge to draw away from Ginny. Because he'd realised that he'd wanted to draw away.
Harry retrieved a glass from the cupboard, filling it from the fridge, and hopped onto the edge of the counter before replying. His feet propped on PJ as he planted himself beneath him with his usual attentiveness. "School is school," he said. "How was work?"
"I have had the pleasure, yes," Dimitri replied, that satisfied smile in his voice again. Taking a step forward, he drew his finger across the image of a young man with brilliant curls. "Jamie Armstrong. He was surprising enthusiastic for someone so esteemed." His finger drifted downwards, grazing over a woman staring aloof and heavy lidded into the middle distance. "Fiona McGuire. Excellent model, though she doesn't take to suggestions too well."
Mostly, however, he didn't like being surrounded by so many people. Not only had Draco learnt to be wary of people as a whole, but in a club…
Harry shook his head. He didn't know why, but desperation, had him shaking his head in fervent plea. "Please," he croaked, the word muffled by his fingers still clamped across his mouth. "Please, I –"
"I skimmed it. It was a load of crock."
"I'll fall to sleep through it, but if you'd like."
Pansy flinched and Draco did right alongside her. He didn't even need to share a glance with her to know they were wavering upon the same wavelength.
"- would make it catch fire? It should just make the pasta cook faster!"
Shoving aside the slight tightening in his gut, Harry managed a casual shrug. "Sure. Do whatever you want."
"I'm not."
"Yep, I definitely like him," Ginny said with a short nod. "He's going to be doing – what, hair and makeup?"
Not that he cared. Kids like that… it would be better if they didn't ask questions. Better if they didn't know. Besides, what was the use in trying to convince a kid that he was an good person? In the long run, what would it do? It wasn't like the boy's opinion wouldn't be changed back again the instant another article was printed, or a friend whispered a rumour in his ear.
"Hate to break it to you, Jill, but you're still not actually a part of this class," Jackie pointed out.
he was good at. Time didn't erase the years of practise he'd committed.
Harry met the eyes of each of his family in turn: Sirius, peering at him sidelong as he pretended to be distracted with PJ. Remus, with his open acceptance of whatever was to come. James, his slight frown resurfacing and fingers curled around the back of Lily's chair, and Lily, leaning forwards in her seat with her chin in her hand, her fingers curled along the scar marring her face. She ran feather-light fingers across the shiny ridges as she always did when pondering, and Harry knew even before she spoke that she would be the one to initiate the conversation.
"Are you going to?"
"James, use your spare pair for today," Lily said, not even glancing up from stacking the dishwasher.
The four Hogwarts students – because two of the original six had disappeared, leaving only Harry and Jackie's partners and the two gorilla boys – lined the wall just as they had the previous week. They stared at Harry and Jackie as they approached stared at them upon their approach as though they were nothing short of repulsive. Maybe they were to their eyes, Harry considered. Plenty of other people certainly seemed to think so.
"Have you told Lily and James yet?" she asked.
Thoughts of magic and objection abruptly left Harry's mind at the sight of them. Something had… happened. Draco was naturally pale, but he looked like he'd actually become even paler. His lips were pressed together, his brow furrowed, and he stared at Harry unblinkingly.
"Then why?" Harry snapped his gaze sidelong, a grasping motion as though seeking to latch onto something tangible, a glance entirely different to his prior wistful staring upon the lack. Desperate, and frustrated, and searching for some explanation that Draco wasn't providing. "Then why didn't you just tell me? Draco, if you tell me, I would give it to you. You just have to ask."
Harry saw them first. Maybe, despite how comfortable he'd felt that morning, he was still hyperaware of being watched and of unsavoury company. When a trio of his classmates stepped through the door, loud and swaggering, with Bruce in particular looking even larger than usual wrapped in a puffy jacket and scarf, the mouthful of toast on Harry's tongue turned to ash. That ash became acid as Jacob, leading his friends like the entitled prince he considered himself most of the time, glanced their way.
"Say another word and I'll seriously consider killing you."
In recent weeks, Draco's workload and work offers had dwindled substantially. It wasn't because he couldn't take on the extra jobs, because he could. He knew he could. What time he didn't spend filming Pansy's weekly interviews, or with Harry in his weekly shoots, was spent finishing up the jobs he'd already accepted and even refining those that didn't especially need it. Because he had time. He had too much time, even.
Harry shook his head, smiling as Von was shunted further into the elevator by more passengers and fell to effectively gushing about what was, apparently, a scandal of sorts regarding "Christine Walker, that bitch". It was amusing to simply watch him; for a man so tall, so broad, so imposing and hard-faced much of the time, his deterioration into schoolboy gossip had been astounding the first time Harry had beheld it. It was as though he were two different people in one.
The modelling industry was gruelling. It was merciless, or so some people said. More than that, as with every industry, it had a dark side that was kept under wraps but occasionally seeped out into the open to the cringing side-eyes of onlookers.
With a struggle, Harry dropped his gaze to where he hadn't even realised his hands clutched one another. His knuckles had turned white, fingers shaking slightly, and no amount of mental scolding seemed capable of making them stop. "I…" he attempted.
Draco's hand tightened where he'd grasped Harry's, almost clinging to him. "They're being relocated to be given the Dementor's Kiss."
"Over here, sweetie. Take a look this way."
It was obvious. It was so blatantly obvious what was going through the man's mind that Harry didn't even bother pretending he didn't see it. He knew what attraction looked like. He knew the particular light of lust in someone's stare, the way that stare would flicker downwards just briefly before catching itself. He knew what was being asked without words.
had a small enough cohort of its own and had been largely shunned for its insignificance for years.
"Did he climb the gate?"
Harry smiled, wide and heartfelt. He couldn't help himself. He flashed a glance towards Draco, who rolled his eyes but couldn't quite keep his own smile from surfacing. It was a wonderful smile, that slight, almost reluctant curve of his lips, and Harry didn't think he'd ever get tired of seeing it.
"Often?"
Harry doubted he even saw the fire. He knew that feeling of staring and losing himself a little all too well.
The room was warm. The company was good, with the unobjectionable exception of a few key players to fill out their ranks. The food wasn't ideal, but it was filling, and little could surpass a belly-full of bacon and tea in Harry's opinion. Sipping at the last of his own cup, thigh pressed against Draco's and caught in discussion of their upcoming presentation, Harry had the passing thought that he didn't think things could get better than this.
"It's better not to bother," Harry said to Draco before turning back to Jackie. "Actually, we've pretty much drafted the presentation. Just got to bulk it out."
Draco's nose wasn't broken, but the memory of blood dribbling across his lips wouldn't leave Harry alone. That, and that Draco even then was touching it tentatively as though palpating for further injuries. He caught Harry watching him and dropped his hand.
"So when do I start?" he'd asked as they'd crawled through midday traffic.
he scolded himself.
"I guess you could call it that."
Draco wasn't exceptionally broad across the chest, but was certainly enough to notice. The breadth of his shoulders was appealing enough that Harry all but felt his fingers itch to touch them. Surely he played sport. His arse was too noteworthy for it to be otherwise.
"Had to see…"
But for the moment, Harry didn't care. Grinning like a fool, he plucked the flower from Draco's fingers. "Malfoy, I think that sounds like a bloody brilliant idea."
Harry nodded again. "Good. That's good, then." Taking a slow breath, ignoring that it shook slightly, Harry glanced to the nightstand alongside Draco's bed. "Would you like to cast the charm, or should I?"
Draco didn't care about Harry and Harry didn't care about him. Or that was how it was supposed to be. Draco didn't let himself wonder why that thought felt like a lie itself.
"Old water under the bridge and all that, right?"
Draco nodded slowly before switching his gaze towards Pansy. "Speaking of opportunities, how did you land one at
"I get it," he said. "Yeah, I get that. Magic seems harder than it was before."
"Hey!"
Hermione nodded. "Yes, anyone with a red and gold tie is from our House, so we're all pretty friendly with them. We could vouch for them."
It was stationed just to the side of his room, which was probably why Harry had missed it. A stand – no, a cot. A cot with a cradle nestled between its ornate ends. For a moment, the juxtaposing shadows swathing the room hid the contents, giving it the impression of little more than a formless bundle of blankets tucked beneath the half-raised hood of the basket.
"I'm not going to back out now," he said, shifting in Draco's lap. "Do you know how much preparation it takes? It's crazy."
Draco's snort was muffled into a sharp exhalation. "No. It's deliberate." He paused, shifting alongside Harry. The silence was heavy with Harry's own expectation before he continued. "Are you okay?"
"This is a terrible angle," he said.
"I'm just heading straight home, you know. You're the one –" Harry cut himself off as Draco's smirk widened a little. "You're drunk."
"We should probably go with her," he said, jerking a thumb over his shoulder. "She'll start hollering if we make her wait for too long."
In spite of himself, warmth flooded Harry's cheeks. He was acutely aware of Draco's hand still upon his shoulder, of his smile that widened slightly as Harry stuttered a reply. "I… that's not… I mean, it's not wrong, but I – it's complicated with the whole… you know… I don't want to make things awkward, and it's not like it's going to affect our studies or anything, so –"
"You acknowledge it as delicate and even difficult, and yet readily agree to step up to the challenge?"
"I can't believe it," Harry whispered, closing his eyes again once more. "I don't even know what to think."
"It's who I am, Harry. You have to let me spread my wings and be myself."
"Of course."
Bellatrix was insane. Terribly insane, and yet she had a goal, an objective, and something that wasn't working for her. It promised a whole new kind of risk; the handprint on Harry's cheek was more than telling of where she would lash out should she fail.
"Meaning," Harry drew his gaze briefly sidelong in the direction he knew Blaise Zabini's bed lay, "I'm thinking about our friends. And about them not knowing."
"Your dad hasn't been an interrogator for years," Lily said. "And don't try to deflect; it's only making me more curious."
"No, you definitely are."
"Nice to meet you, Harry," Hermione said, smiling as widely as Ron now. "Thanks for helping out with this. I don't think McGonagall's really sure of what the procedure is for this. Our school's never done an exchange program of this kind before."
The streetlamp flickered, interrupted by a shadow, and then he was there. Draco was there, collapsing to the ground at Harry's side. Sirius didn't stand a chance, even as adamant as he was, when Draco flung himself at Harry and wrapped his arms around him. His hold was as suffocating as Apparition and felt just as good. With Draco's arms around him, Harry didn't have to try so hard to hold himself upright.
Harry only just managed to withhold a groan. Already? They were already suggesting it? He buried his still-flushed face in his hands even as James' exclamations, Lily's tentative reasoning, and Sirius' false support replayed in his head. When he spread his fingers to peer through, it was to see Remus regarding him with a curious expression on his face. Knowing, but not the kind of knowing that Harry would have anticipated. He looked almost suspicious.
Harry didn't know why it was closed but he cursed whatever teacher had forgotten to unlock it. He didn't slow in his headlong charge, however, because the sounds of Jacob, of a grumbling shout that sounded far too much like the Bruce's bellowing tone, nipped at his heels. There was little he could do but –
Harry tucked his chin, though didn't really bother to hide his smile. Just the thought of being considered was enough. Surreal, and a little uncomfortable when it came from someone other than Ron, or Hermione, or Ginny, but special. "I don't mind," he said quietly. "Besides, who knows? Maybe I'll get itchy feet after this and want to take a break from work to travel the world or whatever."
Harry was left behind, alone and stunned in the empty hallway. Slowly lowering his gaze to the key in his hand, he shook his head. The trip had certainly taken an unexpected bend, and it was far from over yet.
Harry wasn't angry at Draco. He hadn't been for years. And yet something about him seemed to trigger the rebirth of what felt very like it. It had almost surprised Harry, almost left him shocked the first time he'd spoken with Draco and something cold, something fierce and hard, swept through him.
"Quite," Draco replied without inflection. He hadn't much care for posturing these days, even from waiters. "Though it could hardly be constituted evening just yet."
attendants each dressed in varying degrees of black and in various states of business.
"Draco!" he called and, as one, Draco and his two companions turned towards him.
Blaise stared at him blankly for a moment before, in a succession of expressions that passed so quickly it was barely discernible – horror, embarrassment, amusement, then feigned self-deprecation – he shoved the coins back into the pouch and disappeared the entirety with a flourish. "Oops. Yeah, my mistake."
"Pansy? Really?"
"Oi, hold on a second," he said, sitting forward with elbows on his knees once more. "This guy. You talk to him, right?"
Harry couldn't deny that. He couldn't really deny Jackie's suggestion, either, because the cluster of green- and silver-tied students were about all who were left without partners of the Hogwarts students.
Draco shrugged. "Because I like it, too. You're not the only one to make some strange discoveries in the past few months." Shifting slightly, Draco adjusted himself until his shoulder propped against Harry's. "Is that wrong?"
Turning away, resting his cheek back onto his knees, Harry gazed through the window once more. He opened and closed his mouth three times before he could utter a single word.
"He didn't just demand that we come along," Ron had said over the phone days before when he'd first been formally approached with the offer. "I mean, he actually asked. And offered money. But – like, he actually asked."
thing? Harry, I daresay you're playing with fire, especially when certain ears are present and listening."
"I have no idea," Harry said. "It seems a little redundant to me, and a time waster, especially since we're in sixth form."
"I think he wouldn't care if you used shots of him," she said slowly, "but if it bothers you, then tell him. Show them to him."
"Is it?" Jackie turned towards Jill. "How do you know that?"
"And get back to me."
The intensity of Draco's regard spiked further at that. Before Harry's eyes, something seemed to change. It shifted, morphing slightly, and though he wasn't sure what it was, it was as though a switch had been flicked behind Draco's eyes.
Harry didn't protest. Once, he might have done, might have proclaimed how public image was nothing and that he could do whatever the hell he wanted. Time and experience had taught him that such wasn't true. It was far from the truth, in fact.
"Aristocratic," Hermione corrected him, even as Jackie opened her mouth once more. "You could say they're, ah… upper class?"
"You don't have to go tomorrow," Harry said, closing his eyes as Von turned towards him and pointedly raised the eyeliner before. "I don't have anything booked for a whole half a week after today."
