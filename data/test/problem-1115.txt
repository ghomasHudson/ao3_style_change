"Okay," he frowned slightly as he watched the elf. So different from those he had met before in the kitchens and Dobby.
“Yes, she… I almost lost my baby girl,” she said, voice shaking as she thought of what could have happened to her.
“I think we should go,” Sirius whispered as he and Harry went through the floo, “Ron, make sure your Dad takes Ginny, don't let Molly browbeat him,” he warned him.
“But he might not want to come over,” Harry nodded, he thought the same, “well we can ask about it in a bit,” he added, not sure if he was going to ask Sirius to talk with Ron and bring him over. Harry knew that the two of them would be able to learn from Draco better. As he explained everything so much easier.
"When I placed you there, I put up some wards, using what your mother had done to protect you from those that might want to harm you." Albus was cut off by a snort from Harry, "Yes, I know, they didn't protect you from anything inside, which is why I will not be sending you back. I've no doubt that Sirius is more than capable of keeping you safe and he has protections on the home that you will be staying at for a while before going to a place he wishes to have set up. He has asked Remus for his help in this case," he smiled, though it was strained as he looked at the young wizard.
“That’s fine,” he smiled, “The house is just us, Molly has taken Ginny out for the day. Percy has started work, so he’s at the ministry now,” he added as he wandered towards the backyard as well to watch the three fly.
"Thank you," he nodded, "I... I know why you sent me there, I never really understood it, a wizarding family would have been able to protect me."
“I know you had a number of them during school as well, that you would get out and find someone and bite them,” Sirius remembered how fearful Remus had been throughout most of their school years.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, as he concentrated on packing things away for a moment before sitting down on the camp bed and then taking a breath. “Part of me knows that you might not like what I have to say, but I need to.”
"Hmm," he hummed as he noticed the stunned looks from the three students in the room, "You took the pranks too far at times."
Sirius nodded “yeah, the bad blood between the two families is… bad, though that might be because they were on opposite sides this time.”
“Wh… what does that mean for Ginny?” he asked, worry lacing his voice as he thought of something being wrong with his baby girl.
"Then we shall make sure there is one, for now, Potions Master Snape, I presume that you have some Veritaserum available for me to use in this case?" She asked the wizard.
“I know, and I will,” Harry said, more determined to put aside what Hermione did and really knuckle down and make Sirius and his parents proud of him.
"But what, Harry," Sirius asked gently, turning the young wizard around to face him, a serious look on the older wizard’s face.
Sirius almost collapsed at that moment, his mind going to Harry, “I’m sorry, but I am going to have to finish our meeting early, I need to get back to my godson.”
“I know,” he nodded, “I know what family is like,” he sighed, “come on, my office would be a better place to talk,” he said leading the way to the other end of the house and to a small room that he kept locked only for himself to be able to enter. “Come and sit down,” he finished, gesturing to the chairs in the room. Taking one himself, he waited for Sirius to talk.
Arthur shuddered “my word, who, who was it?” he asked, voice shaking as he wanted to know the bastard that he needed to go after for hurting his baby girl.
“Why don’t you stay there and I’ll go and get him,” Ron suggested, quickly pushing Harry back into his chair again.
Harry and Ron shared a glance, “Well, she wasn't really herself. She had part of her memory missing when Voldemort took over,” Harry began.
“Well, you quit, you’re the only one that's been able to do that in almost fifty years.” Sirius pointed out to him.
“I’m sorry, Sirius,” he told him, apologising, “and sorry to you as well Master Goblin, but it is somewhat urgent that I come here,” he added, turning to the goblin that Sirius had been in a meeting with.
Harry gave a small smile back before standing, "Thank you for telling me, though... one thing I still want to know."
Ron looked at him, glaring as he walked out of the room before Harry could even say hello to him. Harry slumped, feeling a hand on his shoulder. He looked up and saw Sirius giving him a sad, soft look. The twins saw the exchange and since they didn’t know what was going on; they approached Harry.
“Afternoon, Albus,” he smiled as he walked over, “sorry to disturb you during the holiday, but I found something that I thought you should know about.”
Harry settled down, he heard the floo go and then light talking going on. He ignored it as he picked up the book and started to read. It was a few minutes later when he started to shift around in his chair. Feeling something odd in the room, he hadn’t been in there much. No one had really. Blinking as he felt a fog descending on him, he tried to push it away. Harry glanced around, wondering what could be causing it. His mind slowly started to go blank as he got up from his chair, the book he had been in the middle of reading falling to the floor as he moved towards a cabinet on the far side of the room.
"More fool me, but I did, with revenge in my heart for the death of my brother, I went after him. Leaving you with Hagrid to keep you safe until I could get you later. But he tricked me, he actually did it, he tricked me," Sirius said, hands pulling at his hair as he thought of that night.
Ron shook his head, "No way, I'm way too brash for Slytherin. Fred and George, I found out at the beginning of last year. I know why they pushed for Gryffindor, Mum would have killed them if they had gone to Slytherin."
“Oh, you didn't have to do that, I understand why I don't have… Him any more,” Ron said, wrinkling his nose in distaste as he thought of the rat.
"Then we shall use some Veritaserum before anything is to happen," the woman said as she took a step forward, giving the minister a look.
“Exactly, you have what he craves, and he’ll never really have that until he is older,” Sirius told him softly.
“Hmm, I’d rather not know, Ginevra,” he said with a shrug as he walked with Ron towards the Burrow and into the crooked house.
Snape walked behind Harry, three days after the Shrieking Shack, a hand on his shoulder guiding him around the paparazzi that had shown up for the trial. They were shouting at him, questioning him on anything and everything that they could think of. Harry ignored them, feeling safe with Snape since his glare was keeping most of them away. Though one vile sounding woman did try to get too close. But with a few sharp words from Snape, she was scuttling back from where she had come from.
"Because over on that bed is Peter Pettigrew, believed to have been dead for the past 12 years," Sirius said as he gestured to the bed across the room, that held the unconscious and bed-bound man.
“That's fine, and well… I,” he paused for a moment, gathering his thoughts and putting them in some sort of order.
"Well, well," came a very sarcastic voice as Snape appeared at the far end of the room, "Sirius Black, such a lucky day for me, the Dementors will be happy to feed off your darkened soul. And Lupin should have known you would have been helping an 'old friend' back into the castle. You haven't changed," he sneered at them both.
Harry stood by the fireplace. Ron was going to be flooing in soon. The fireplace lit up, quickly turning green as Ron came out with a sour look on his face. Before Harry could even ask what was wrong Ginny followed him. Harry's heart sank at the sight. Ron gave him an apologetic smile.
Ron grinned and nodded as Sirius left the two of them alone. Letting the boys have a bit of fun before Ron had to return home.
"Hmm," Harry nodded, grabbing his trunk as they all started to leave the compartment, the throng of students heavy in the corridor, though they were a lot more polite when Remus joined them in leaving. Harry took the lead towards the door and stepped down from the train and onto the platform. His green eyes darting from one side to another, trying to spot Sirius.
“He’s family,” Ron was the one to answer, “and I know, it’s a little weird. It is for me, too, to know that Harry’s been hanging out with him during the summer. But he’s welcome here,” he added.
"Make sure it is an anti-magus cell!" she called after him, "Headmaster, Professor Snape, Mr Potter," she said as she looked at all three of them in turn, "I may be calling on the two of you," she indicated Snape and Harry, "to come and testify for Mr Black," she finished.
"Of course. I have several regrets in my life, and sending you to live with them is one of my main ones. I will forever regret not being able to find a family that would be able to take you in and keep you truly safe from the dangers in our world," he sighed softly, a regretful look on his face.
Pettigrew fell to the ground, but before he could do anything Sirius and Snape both sent a stunner to him, making sure he wasn't going to make a run for it. "I'll levitate," Snape said, "you help with them," he gestured at the teens.
“Because I thought you were leaving me behind like they always did,” he answered him honestly. “Then you said that Draco was there, helping and being friendly with you and it was like I was alone, but it was more than that, he has money and I know you do as well. But the thought of you two being able to do things that I’ll never be able to do, like going out and shopping or anything really,” he added softly, looking away.
The two grinned, it wasn't Mrs Weasley or Ginny. This time it was Sirius. Finally, they could go back to Grimmauld Place.
"Yes, well," Mrs Weasley said, a frown on her face as she carried on, "I'll let Ron go, but don't leave your sister alone all the time. She deserves to spend some time with her friends as well," she huffed as she started to guide everyone to the Floo exit.
Harry slumped in it and nodded. Ron was worried Harry was a lot paler than he had been when he had first arrived. “Yeah, okay,” he sighed, closing his eyes and slumping against the desk a little more.
“Yeah, I’m coming with you,” Ron said as the two of them quickly packed up. Molly protested to them all the way to the floo. “See you later Mum,” he told her as he was the last to go through. He slumped on the other side. Seeing a smile on his friend's face the two went to Harry's room to continue working on their school work for Remus and Sirius. They were more determined to work hard and prove to Molly and Hermione that they didn’t need the help.
“You’ve already told me that she’s not welcome in your home,” she snipped, sparing him a quick glance.
“The wards that were anchored at Privet Drive and to Harry are breaking. It's going to make Harry feel a little weird, as they were blood wards and they are being broken before he turns seventeen. Normally if we had waited until then, Harry wouldn't have felt anything,” Sirius explained as he sat down himself, Kreacher popping into the room to serve them.
"He is the reason your parents are gone, Harry," Remus clarified bluntly, looking at the teen, trying to gauge what he was doing.
Harry looked around the large room. They were finally in their new home and had been for a day so far. He loved it, it was large, open and airy. He had a nice room, larger than he had ever had before. But he wasn't complaining. How could he? It was still like a dream for him. And now, he was finally fourteen. He was getting older, and he finally had his wish, his birthday wish since he knew how to make them, he had a family. He had friends and family that he loved.
Ron snorted, "I can put two and two together. And you behave more Slytherin-like at times. And you're not the only one that was meant for the house of snakes and got the lion," he shrugged as he walked over to the bed and sat down beside his friend.
Snape gave him a nod of acknowledgement as he went over to Madam Bones and said, "Here we are," he handed over the vial.
“Then why am I getting E or A’s then?” Harry asked, frowning and even a little upset that he hadn’t been able to get a proper grade.
“When I look at the ones, you wrote after Hermione’s suggestions,” Sirius started, picking one up and glancing through it.
“In her case, yes, the Horcrux she had was a diary, when she started to write in it, it locked onto her and started to transfer itself to her and then drain her of magic and life,” he said, a little more bluntly than he intended to.
“Food in the kitchen, Harry,” he reminded him, not wanting the same trouble his own parents had with rotten food being left in rooms.
Sirius stood up, leaving the teens on the floor, at the moment Harry was safe with Draco. The blond-haired teen didn’t look like he was going to be letting go of his godson any time soon with how tightly he was gripping him. Going over and glancing into the cabinet, he could feel the evilness coming from the locket. It was stronger than the others, but it blended in well enough that he wouldn’t have sensed it if it hadn't of called to Harry at all. Casting a charm he tried to get a read on it. Casting several others he went pale as he murmured to Narcissa what it was.
"You gave back really good sometimes," Sirius grinned, "I think if we weren't blinded by our own idiocy, we would have seen what a true genius you were with pranks."
“It’s fine,” Harry nodded, a smile on his face as he saw the grimace. “I know that you said he was doing it mainly to keep in his Dad’s good book and not cause waves,” he added, thinking about the talk that the two of them had the day before.
"Okay, thank you," Sirius nodded as he turned and took over from Hermione in helping Ron head to the castle. "You know, when you get to know me better, maybe, maybe you'd like to live with me?" he asked, sounding afraid of the answer that Harry could give.
“Sure, we can work on that,” Harry nodded, turning to Sirius and Remus, “Sure we can go there, just come and get me as soon as you get back, I don't want to be there for long in case they come back.”
Ron sighed, "he is asking for you to pass on a message to someone in the same family as you, and as himself. While neither of you carries the Black name, you are both part of the Black family. I'm too far removed from the Black family for it to count, but both of you are within three generations of being a Black."
“What?” both Harry and Ron shouted. The two had been let in on what it was, much like Draco knew what it was all about.
“Ginevra,” Harry greeted politely, no longer using the nickname she had. Sirius had said it might be a way to show how distant he wanted to be with her. As using her nickname may give her the wrong impression.
“Okay, I think the two of you should drop it, it’s not going to help you. There are other ones you can take. I don't mind helping in tutoring you in the subjects that you chose. To make sure that you can catch up with your year group,” Sirius suggested.
“But what has he had to lose to have things like that?” Sirius asked him, “You really need to think about what he has that you want, and then look at what he wants.”
Harry led the way into the Great Hall. Other students were looking at him as he entered and he knew why. Since the night at the Shack, the papers had been full of Sirius Black and his innocence as well as the capture, arrest, and persecution of Peter Pettigrew. Harry had never been happier about making sure they hadn't killed the man for what he had done to Harry's parents. Entering the hall and heading towards the Gryffindor table, whispers once more broke out. Though this time they were looking at him. Harry glanced towards the paper as he reached his usual seat. There on the front page was a picture of him and his parents along with Sirius and Remus. They all looked so young, but he could see the worry in their eyes.
Ron closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath as he followed the goblin down to the offices that were further in the bank. Ron was too nervous to look around, he knew that he would never come down this corridor, as it was mainly for those that had money that needed meetings with the goblins. His family hadn’t had money in a very long time, since his grandfather's time if he remembered correctly.
Ron thought for a moment, “okay, tell me about him, tell me what he’s like and what he has done and everything,” he told him, sitting up and leaning against the wall. Legs crossed in front of him.
“Sorry isn’t good enough though, Mrs Weasley, she did something that could have really harmed us. And it has harmed our standing in the school, and the belief that people have of us, we are the laughing stock at times,” Harry pointed out, “We always knew the wrong thing and were laughed at, and we thought we were right because of information that she had given us. We could have easily died if we had come across something that she had given us false information on,” he finished the small rant at the woman.
“Where's Harry?” he asked, a little confused. He didn’t think Ron would be comfortable enough to come and meet him as he did.
Moments later they landed with a wobble in the middle of a dark living room. Harry looked around, seeing a house-elf nearby grumbling and glaring at the three of them as they arrived, "Who?" Harry asked, gesturing slightly to the elf.
“Language and you think you can raise someone special like Harry,” she huffed, “you’re not even fit to raise a dog.”
"I'm keeping an eye on him," Remus muttered, as he walked over to where Snape was, taking the wand from the floor, where it had dropped and pointing his own on Snape as he started to come around, "Keep quiet and I won't do anything, Severus, maybe you could learn something," he pointed out to the Potions Master. Snape glared at him but remained quiet.
"Hang on," he huffed as he began to read. Eyes following the words as a smile broke out on his face.
"That my mother is happy that he is free as he should have always been. That she remained on his side, knowing he wouldn't do such things, and that I believed in him as well," he said softly, looking at Harry, not even sparing the brunette’s friends a look.
"I did as I had to," Malfoy turned to her for a moment before looking at Harry, "Some of us have no choice but to follow the family line on things. Some of us don't have anyone to back us. Not everything is so black and white, Granger," he finished, glancing at the young witch.
"Well, Sirius was going to change it all to red, and while I love being in Gryffindor..." he trailed off, sitting on his bed.
“I wanted to be needed,” she said, sniffling a little as she began to cry. “If you were always so smart then I wouldn’t be needed and I’d be alone again,” she told them, “I…”
“Morning, Harry,” Sirius greeted a cheerful tone in his voice, though the smile on his face turned into a frown when he spotted a pale-looking Harry.
“Very well, I shall end our business now, you have the cup that you wished for,” the goblin nodded, understanding that the young wizard that Ron and Sirius was talking about was the heir of houses Black and Potter.
"Sorry to interrupt your meal, but I ask that you pass on a message from my mother to her cousin when you see him," Malfoy said quietly, his tone remaining polite and refraining from saying anything to Ron and Hermione and their attitude.
"I'll see you soon, Harry," Sirius said as he hugged his godson tightly one last time before he followed the witch.
"Now," Albus sighed a little, "Why don't you go and see your friends, let them know what is going on," he smiled.
“He’s not feeling great at the moment,” Ron answered him, hurrying up the stairs, “I really don't think we should study. I think we should let him rest,” he sighed a little as he reached the bedroom door and walked in.
"And why not, I am the Minister of Magic!" he huffed, almost as though he was trying to make himself taller with the movement.
He ran into Gringotts like Voldemort was after him and looked around. He looked lost as he couldn’t see Sirius. He knew that he would have to wait. He looked to one of the goblin guards, “Excuse me,” he said, giving a bow, “I know it is really bad to ask. But I have something that I need to tell Sirius Black, I know that he has an appointment here. I don't know who with, though. It's about his godson Harry, something has happened and I need to speak with him,” he asked, almost begging as he hoped that the guard would listen to him.
Sirius sat down and shook his head, “he isn’t, but I think Draco is going to be a better help than me at the moment,” he said softly.
"I... I would like that," he gave a soft smile as he moved a little closer to Ron, helping him over a rock.
Harry reeled back, eyes wide as they began to fill with tears at Ron’s words. “He thinks I'm like Hermione?!” his voice shook as Draco entered the room.
“Hello, Draco, if you want to talk with Harry, he’s in his room doing some work. He’s going to be changing his third year electives, so he might not want to talk,” Sirius warned him.
“Yeah,” he murmured, slumping at the mention of Hermione, “I… Hermione is… not in our good books at the moment,” he told him, being honest.
“Sorry,” Harry grinned a little sheepishly, “I don't mean to say that he hung the moon and stars, but he was really helpful,” he finished.
"There is one more thing I need to tell you about, Malfoy, he asked to pass on a message," Harry said, remembering the blond.
“Ah,” he nodded, “you both okay?” he asked, somewhat concerned for them. He knew that they were hurting badly for what Hermione had done to them.
"Minister Fudge, if you do not shut up, I will launch a full investigation into your dealings since you came in office, and I will make sure to turn up every single stone I can think of," she warned him.
Ron nodded, "Shi-" he began, only to be cut off as Hermione reached around Harry and smacked him on the back of the head. "Ow!" Ron said, glaring at the witch, "What was that?"
Harry nodded, giving him one last smile as he left the office. Fawkes flew over to Albus, as the man contemplated how to tell Harry what he knew, he didn't want to burden the teen, but now understood that Harry wasn't the child he hoped to be, but a young adult.
“Thanks for telling us, I think from now on, you might have to come here more than Harry going there. Hope you don't mind,” Sirius said as he held Harry tightly. The teen had never been given the chance to grieve for his parents, and being reminded that he had lost them, wasn’t easy now that he could have that time.
“Draco is part of the Black family and has been coming over; he and Harry have struck up a bit of a friendship. Ron is feeling left behind,” Sirius said, repeating a little of what Ron had told him.
“No, no, it’s fine,” Harry said, shaking his head. Sirius had wanted to check with Arthur to see what they were doing about Ginny. Though Harry had a feeling that there was something more going on with the meeting than just that.
“Death Eaters aren't just from Hogwarts though, Ron. They weren’t just from Slytherin either,” Harry reminded him, sitting down on the camp bed.
Sitting down, Harry reached for the waiting paper and began to read it as the Owls began to fly into the room. "Looks like they are talking about my living arrangements now that he's free since he was named as someone my parents wanted to take me in," he murmured, eyes down as he tried to avoid the stares of the others in the hall.
"Expelliarmus!" Harry shouted; wand aimed at Snape. the wizard went flying, hitting the wall before falling to the floor. "Tell me?" he asked, "Tell me what happened that night, everyone says that it was because of you that Voldemort went after my parents. If it wasn't you, then who?" he pleaded with the crazed wizard.
"No, not at all. Never think that. I honestly stress myself out. I should've just said no in the first place. I'm sorry, Ginny."
He grabbed the Marauder's Map, said aloud, "I solemnly swear I am up to no good." And tapped his wand to the page.
Draco nodded back at him and walked out. His mind went blank. Maybe now everything will be ok? Though, a part of him felt sick to his stomach even more so than before.
He waits until he gets back to his room to take a deep breath. Though he failed to realize that he had much bigger issues to deal with than his father.
Blaise grabs his hand and pulls him up. He stumbles up and comes face to face with Blaise. "What in the world?! How are you here?! I thought your grandmum-"
His embarrassment felt like it was going to kill him. He groaned and pulled on his hair in frustration. Why did he have to be this way?
"Well she says that Neville can't see me anymore. We didn't talk for weeks until he, get this, snuck out of his house in the middle of the night. Luckily enough me and Luna were both awake. It seemed to be perfect timing. I was so stressed about it I couldn't sleep so Luna went to talk to me about it and here comes Neville on a broom-"
He ran a hand through his hair with no essence of gentleness. He wanted to pull his hair out. He would never be good enough, would he? Now the Slytherins as a whole would destroy him and so would the rest of the world. He kept wondering why, oh why, was he in Gryffindor. He wasn't worthy whatsoever. If only that wretched dusty hat put him in Hufflepuff. That's exactly where he belongs. Besides, all the Hufflepuffs are seen as weak failures, just like he is. He was perfect for it, yet he got Gryffindor. It made no sense.
Neville takes a deep breath, grips his hands onto the broom and kicks off softly. He gasps when he notices he's floating and not flying all over the place like he did in first year.
Before Draco could say another word, Molly's voice booms through the house. "Dinner is ready!" She shouts.
"My father, he... He has very high expectations. Ones that I really can't meet. I'm expected to know every polite rule in the book from birth, always look polished, never gain any weight, marry a girl, carry on the Malfoy name... When I don't meet these expectations or I do something he dislikes..." Draco sighs and fails to finish his sentence.
He was pleasantly surprised to hear Harry chuckle. The sound made him smile wider. "Sleep well," Harry says before the room goes silent.
"Neville, don't go! Look, I'm sorry. I can't help it. I don't... I don't mean to be weird. I just... This isn't even the time, is it?" Blaise says.
Hermione and Ron get married in the year of 2002 as well, but months after Neville and Blaise got married. They both work as Aurors at the ministry and also advocate for LGBT+ rights. Hermione also still advocates for House-Elf rights, even as Ron tells her it's useless.
"Blaise, come help hold him up." Harry says, putting Draco's arm over his shoulder. Blaise does the same with his other side and they start to walk him over towards the exit.
He felt silly, but he needed someone to talk to. With his quill in hand and parchment on his desk, he wrote to the mysterious gift-giver.
It's not like he didn't like girls, they were great. But Neville was different. He has been with many girls, but he never loved them, he just wanted to be with them for a couple of nights to kill his mind, but now it's different. It's been different for two years. For once in his life he's felt love for someone, not to mention actual empathy. But now he wishes he didn't. It's awful.
"Yeah, you're definitely going to the infirmary." The continue on and Draco makes an effort to keep his mouth shut. Luckily for him, he never says another word.
Why is the room so hot?! Why is my heart beating so fast?! Oh, Merlin, I'm having a panic attack! Neville began to slowly hyperventilate. He couldn't stop himself.
"You could've destroyed Ne-Draco's life! Do you have any regret at all?!" Blaise holds his hands out in rage.
"Uh... It's ok..." Harry says, looking down at the ground. He walks over to his bed and covers himself up.
It's been happening for weeks now and it's beginning to drive him crazy. Every now and then he'd think of Blaise, especially his clean clothes, flawless skin, and pearly white smile. It was hard not to have the image of him resting in your brain sometimes. But now, it was every second, of every minute, of every day. Sometimes it made his stomach feel queasy, but in an oddly comforting way. In all reality, it was just him being jealous of Blaise. He looked good in everything, had a polished look, and most likely was rich just like every Slytherin. He was also incredibly skilled at... well everything. However, he was the most intimidating boy in school, other than Gregory Goyle of course. However, while Gregory Goyle made him nervous as well, Goyle made him want to curl up into a ball far away in a corner and cry. Blaise, on the other hand, was somehow addicting. It was terrible to feel because it made his face warm and palms sweaty, but he wanted to be around him. People like Snape and Goyle drive him as far away from them as they can, but Blaise just can't do that. Something about him was incredibly interesting to Neville and made him come back for more. Little did he know, it was only a poison.
"Sod off, Potter. Your life is great. You're praised for everything, even laying a brick in the loo." Draco jeered, making Harry huff in anger.
There was such a strong wave of it, though, right after he mentioned the scent of ink. It hit him right in the face. It was more hypnotizing than the other smells. Bloody hell, it was amazing. He didn't think he should've asked him that question, though. He bloody embarrassed himself. Damn, he's talking like Ron now.
"He will apologize to you and I will make him get you back on good terms with Neville." Draco promises.
Blaise smashes his lips onto Neville's. He stands there, shocked that Blaise would do that so spontaneously. After a few seconds, he begins to kiss back.
Even though the Slytherins were a pain, he missed his dorm. Being here with Harry was worse than hearing Parkinson whine about every little thing. However, it was a close contender.
He stands there, his legs shaking but failing to make a move. He was frozen. The screams filled his ears and made him want to crawl into himself. He watched as his Aunt reached down and hold the knife up to Hermione's skin.
They catch eyesight and Neville's nerves skyrocket. At this point, he would need that bracelet, according to the gift-giver. But there was no way he would risk being asked questions by his new girlfriend. Especially since he was planning on using every single gift in that box.
"First, give me the letter please." Luna says, holding out her hand. Neville takes the letter out of his robe and hands it over. Luna examines the back of the envelope without taking the letter out. She then smiles softly. "I am pretty certain it's the same person."
"Well..." Draco sighs, "I don't know. See, when I got back to my dorm, it was completely silent between me and Harry until today when he said we should 'just go back to normal' and that the kiss meant nothing." Draco finishes staring at the covers of Blaise's bed.
"Not as sad as you accidentally proclaiming your love to Potter and ending up here because he thinks you're crazy," Blaise says, popping in another bean. "Ugh, ear wax!"
how to have a conversation with the other. They usually only ever insulted each other or had quick, unimportant discussions, like on Thursday when Potter had rescued Draco from that broom closet, or Potions class on Friday. Conversations about the whole sleeping curse didn’t really count. It was basically forced conversation. But now…
He added in a drop of Bundimun Secretion to his and Potter’s yellowish looking and foul smelling potion, and much to Draco’s relief, it turned purple. He and Potter had made it correctly.
Draco stepped a little closer, aiming to congratulate him by patting him on the back, but Potter apparently thought he was doing something completely different, so they ended up in an awkward hug-like-stance with Draco hesitantly touching Potter’s shoulder blade, his lips close to Potter’s ear and Potter’s breath on his neck.
“You know how dreams have meanings?” She stated. “What you experienced was a sort-of-dream. Your mind created those visions when you were directly faced with death, and the images you saw had utmost importance to you. For example, it’s pretty clear that hugging your loved ones holds the meaning that anyone would guess: you love them and wanted to embrace that before you ‘died’. The mirror is a bit more tricky. It holds self reflection, beauty, ugliness, so on and so forth. It stands for a lot of different things. You just have to work out for yourself what it meant in your situation.”
When they both arrived at the classroom that was converted into their therapy space, they each took a deep breath and proceeded into the room. The room was spacious, wide enough to hold about fifty kids, and smelled like chalk and old books. It wasn’t decorated at all, and had no furniture in it, except for a colorful rug and around twenty chairs. There were maybe around forty Eighth Years in total, but therapy sessions were split into two groups. Draco, lucky for him, got stuck with the group that had Potter, Kaspian, Granger, and Theo in it. He didn’t have anything against Granger, it was just that every time he looked at her his stomach did a weird flip-thing that he knew was guilt. Guilt that he once called her foul names and guilt that she was tortured in his own house.
Their words turned to touches and sweet kisses; that would one day be lost in time but never lost in their hearts.
“It’s- it’s. It’s Snape.” Potter's voice softened to a whisper so that Draco had to strain himself to hear properly.
He watched as a green flash of light filled the air, and then Harry was gone. A sob ripped through Draco, and he felt like his own skin was being torn off of him. Out of everything he’d experienced with the war, he’d never felt so sick and so lost as he had when he watched Harry’s lifeless body fall.
that we attempted to fix! You sounded so sure of yourself when you told me how this book works! And- and it failed us!” What Draco meant to say was,
“I’m sorry, I forgot what you had gone through with this room when I had announced we should use it.”
Of course Harry wouldn’t be scared, though. He single handedly fought the Dark Lord on multiple occasions. Whatever Sunday brought would probably be nothing compared to what Harry had had to deal with.
“Uh, no problem.” Draco wanted to tell Snape the only reason he had ventured into the Headmistress’s office was to get information on the book, and not to check on the portraits' well-being, but he decided against it. “So, um, about the book.” He waved the book out in front of him.
Potter looked annoyed at Draco’s lame attempt for an excuse. “Pleaseee, Malfoy. Books aren’t going to get you anywhere. Trust me.” Potter said in the most whiny voice humanly possible. Draco was glad to know Potter was still immensely immature.
Somehow, they moved farther onto the bed so no body parts were left hanging off, and Draco was now on top of Harry, his leg slotted between Harry’s and their hips crushed against each other. Sounds of pleasure came from both their mouths, and Draco relished whenever Harry gasped.
“Yeah yeah, we know.” Potter gave a soft chuckle. “Listen, I just want you to know, I won’t tell anyone about… you’re secret,” he coughed. “It’s safe with me, I promise.”
Draco hadn’t wanted Harry to complete his sentence. He knew Harry would say something along the lines of agreeing with Draco’s statement, about how they weren’t friends, and Draco’s heart couldn’t take that agreement.
Draco agreed. He got out of bed and headed for the bathroom, where he got dressed and ready for the day. His arm was throbbing a bit, but he wouldn’t look at it. He would not obsess over it. It wasn’t worth the energy at the moment.
Pansy was inviting a good amount of people. She made sure to invite all of Draco’s closest friends, which consisted of Blaise, Greg, and of course herself. Then she made sure to invite some of his acquaintances: Hermione and Ron.
Seeing as he really didn’t have any theory of where Harry could have gone, he figured he would start at the bottom of the school and work his way up. He could cast
Draco instantly suppressed his urge to dramatically roll his eyes. They started every Friday off like this, and it was honestly getting very annoying. Granger volunteered to go first, and she talked about how she was getting farther in her plans for making S.P.E.W. seen and sponsored by the ministry. Her not so great thing from the week was that she got stuck completing her boyfriend's homework every night.
A nagging voice entered the back of his head, saying how Drys and Olive were Mudbloods, and Mudbloods weren’t strong Wizards, and couldn’t possibly create this Garden with organisms, living off of artificial sunlight alone. He quickly shook his head, willing the thought to leave his brain, telling himself
Harry leaned against Draco, and Draco leaned against Harry, simply enjoying what life put in front of them.
there were people somewhere among the trees. They were outside of Hogwarts’ protective ward, along with the ward that Drys had allegedly put up, keeping him and Harry inside Hogwarts and Hogsmeade grounds.
“Uh.” Draco thought Potter knew about his probation requirements. He didn’t really want to recount them, but he supposed he had no other choice. “I can’t. Learn the defensive spells that is.”
They made their way to the Potions classroom and Draco immediately got to work stirring the yellowish-looking potion clockwise for fifteen minutes, using his wand to keep track of the amount of time going by.
He wished he hadn’t written the letter to his father. He wished he would have been smart enough to send out a piece of parchment with the word, ‘HELP,’ and had an owl send it to the Ministry.
The only way Draco could explain to Harry why he hadn’t written a letter for help, was to tell him about the Figure’s offer. So that’s what he did.
“In theory, yes. I wouldn’t understand why it would just be my father and I affected by it. But, you really don’t think He’s back again, do you?”
Sure, the Figure really could have been throwing empty threats at Draco. Maybe Harry was right, and maybe nothing would happen Sunday. But Draco was too much of a coward to think otherwise. Too much of a coward to defy yet another person who had taken advantage of him.
But it was. The pain worsened every second and he had to strongly suppress himself from ripping his arm off right in front of Potter. His mind kept circling around the thought that the Dark Lord was back and enraged beyond belief.
But right now Pansy, Blaise, Granger and Weasley were waiting for them, and they were damn well going to enjoy their last couple of days at Hogwarts.
“This is great,” Draco said, grabbing his plate from Harry and sitting down at a table in the middle of the kitchen. Harry sat down across from him.
Harry went on, “I realize you don’t have to tell me every aspect of your life. I would be completely hypocritical, since I obviously don’t tell you every aspect of mine, but I do want you to know you can talk to me. I’ll be here for you.”
Potter finally broke the silence. “Book, please reveal to us some sort of counter-curse that will safely return people who are in a cursed state, back to their normal non-cursed selves.”
He tried to reassure himself with those kinds of thoughts, along with staring at a spot on his sheets, which helped with trying to focus his mind, and soon he had stopped panicking and started to relax.
She brought both hands up and squeezed his shoulders endearingly. “Thank you, Draco. Apology accepted.”
Draco snorted. “Only because you can’t actually cast them properly. Otherwise I think they’d be quite
Zacharias Smith and company blocked the door, the only way out of the room. Smith and his group kept walking closer and closer to Draco, until he had hit the back wall of the classroom. He was truly trapped and had nowhere else to go. He probably looked really pathetic, shrinking in on himself, tightly gripping his wand; the one he could not use to fucking defend himself.
“Let’s just get this over with,” He muttered. He instantly regretted saying anything out loud. He didn’t even realize he
“Draco, may I remind you I was a teenager when creating that book. Yes, I was talented at creating spells and what not, but I did not know all the secrets of the universe. I still do not. And I’m sure you don’t need more than three spells.”
“I’ll try again, though.” Potter did attempt the spell again. And again. And again, until he had probably cast the charm about fifteen times, and each time it never worked.
called him Harry, and he knew he now mirrored Potter’s bashful composure as the realization struck. “No,” Draco said.
“To answer your question, about Ron and Hermione, they’re okay. Ron is still shaken up about Fred’s death and all, but he’s doing a lot better than he was this summer. Hermione has a lot of nightmares and she rarely ever sleeps, but she’s also doing better.”
As the night slowly moved on, Draco’s worries started to crawl back. He started analyzing the night they had shared, and started stressing over the thought that, yes, he and Harry were friends for now, but what would happen after the curse was broken? If he and Harry randomly became mates, strutting around Hogwarts together, people would think Harry was under the Imperius curse or something else horrible. Not to mention Harry’s reputation if he was seen hanging around Draco. Draco couldn’t be the reason Harry’s life was ruined, now that it was starting to finally piece itself back together.
He pulled the blade away, and the sharp edge had a gracious amount of blood sticking to it and dripping to the ground. He felt content with what he’d succeeded with, and walked back over to Drys, handing the blade over.
“You were just saving Malfoy’s arse, once again. Malfoy was definitely the one who knocked over that jar, and you were just covering for him. You knew he would get yelled at by Slughorn if you told him the truth.”
“It doesn’t matter who this man is. He’s a nobody.” Draco chanced a withering glare at the Figure, and saw that he was watching Harry and Draco thoughtfully, almost with an amused smile.
owl,” He said, and bit back on a bout of laughter he felt coming as he heard the words that had come out of his mouth.
Draco was standing side by side with Drys as they walked into Hogwarts together, the other Death Eaters following them. He was then a witness to all of the Death Eaters and Drys murdering the Pureblood students and teachers. He didn’t feel anything as he watched Pansy die, along with Blaise, Theo, and countless others.
are the ones that are going to have to save everyone. I don’t think we can do this alone. We’re going to have to work together.” Potter said.
As if he was reading Draco’s mind, Harry cast a spell that detected presences of dark magic. Something he probably learned during his Auror training over the summer. The thought made Draco’s blood boil for a second; Harry becoming an Auror. He could do something so much better with his life.
He turned to the mirror in the bathroom, looking at his reflection, and immediately frowning. He really hated looking at himself in the mirror.
He tried to pinpoint the exact moment when he had developed his futile crush, but found he couldn’t choose one specific moment to blame. It was a series of moments and conversations and years of jealousy and hatred rolled up into a messy ball of unrequited feelings.
He’d been blindly following the Figure’s advice. He hadn’t realized until just now, but the Figure had specifically told him not to send out more letters, or else it would end badly for him. Why hadn’t he just went with his gut and done the
And, by Pomfrey saying, “Last time,” she meant the last time she would have to put healing salve and wrap up Draco’s forearm.
So far, all the books Draco had looked through held no relevant information whatsoever. They talked all about Dreamless Sleep Potions, Sleeping Draught, and everything in between, but no sleeping curses.
From what Draco could tell from Potter’s expression, he could feel the emptiness that loomed all around them too. He guessed it made sense, Potter had lost the most out of everyone at Hogwarts. Draco supposed Potter carried the weight of all the deaths on his back.
He didn’t have to worry about the Aurors stationed at Azkaban reading his letter; along with removing the Dementors, they implemented more humane rules that insured the Prisoner's privacy. Immediate family members were the only people allowed to message anyone in Azkaban, and although the guards weren’t allowed to read the contents of letters sent to the prison, they were allowed to read what the prisoner’s wrote back. It wasn’t much more privacy for the prisoner’s exactly, but privacy to the family members outside of Azkaban. It was something, and that something was all Draco needed.
Draco joined Harry and laid out the patterned blanket, smoothing out the fabric so that there weren’t any bumps. Harry picked up the food basket and placed it in between the two of them as they sat down, and placed the radish on the closest bench.
He avoided death somehow, too, even though he was supposed to die right alongside the other Death Eaters.
Draco was out of the hospital bed before he could answer his own question, grabbing his wand, and ignoring the pain in his chest. He walked carefully to Madame Pomfrey’s office and knocked lightly on the door. Nothing. He knocked a little harder, and still nothing. No noises or movements to indicate there was a living being on the other side of the door.
“But since Potter is with me, he can ask it three questions too, right? I can ask three and he can ask three.”
As they walked in, the door automatically closed behind them, and Draco was hit with an overwhelming, but most certainly welcome, breeze of fresh, cool air.
Draco, still clutching his arm, peered around the forest, knowing that he was obviously missing something. All he could see was trees without their leaves, and darkness, mixed with rain and fog. Although, things were moving. But he knew that they couldn’t have been the Death Eaters Drys had mentioned,
“I’ve made a new friend, haven’t I?” Harry answered, quite genuinely. His eyes sparkling and a small smile forming.
His cheeks were hot and his breathing was ragged by the end. He thought he would combust from embarrassment or whatever right then and there. Half of himself was yelling at him, screaming at him, saying
Draco hoped it was the former option. The prospect of pulling apart random lips while hoping the person with said parted lips didn’t choke on the potion in their sleep, was quite frankly anxiety inducing and disgusting.
He honestly couldn’t wrap his head around the truth that Granger was worried about his well-being. He had called her a mudblood. That was unforgivable. And now here they were, alone in a dark classroom together, acting like nothing had happened between them in their youth.
Maybe Harry didn’t understand the importance of learning new defensive spells fully, but he was at least motivated, and was glad he had something to do instead of waiting around for the potion to be finished.
So, basking in his horrible memories related to the Astronomy Tower seemed like a great option. To remind himself that he was indeed a sucky person who had a less than ideal past. Because if he could remind himself about all the gruesome details, surely he would try and stay as far away from Harry as possible from now on.
“Oh yeah, I’ve been here plenty of times this summer and have served myself Butterbeer from the tap. Let’s just say I’m pretty good friends with the person who owns the Hog’s Head.” Draco had no clue who the owner was, and didn’t have much interest in finding out. During his earlier years at Hogwarts when he and his friends would go to Hogsmeade, they would always pick The Three Broomsticks to get Butterbeer and food over any other place. Now though, he was extremely happy Potter had picked the Hog’s Head to take shelter in. He didn’t know if he was brave enough to enter Rosmerta’s pub.
the savior of the Wizarding World, after all. He could hold his own. Just like he had said to Draco in the rain. Harry was more than capable of defeating whatever threat was coming their way, if there even was a threat at all.
The group walked farther into the room, and they were obviously here to mess with Draco, because all twelve eyes were dead set on him, and nothing else.
He jumped up from the ground, and ran directly in front of Harry, just as the killing curse rolled off of Drys’s tongue.
Harry then noticed Draco’s left forearm, covered in a magi-bandage wrap, and looked at Draco with terror.
Draco was definitely startled at the question. “What for?” he asked. In reality, it wasn’t like he couldn’t remember almost all of the things he’d done over two weeks, but that there were
Potter looked up at Draco and contemplated his answer. “I’m not sure what to think. I would hope it was just an honest mistake made by a kid, but what if it’s not? We don’t know anything about what’s happened, besides the fact that we’re pretty sure they’re sleeping and not dead.”
They had already ruled out the option of them both sleeping in either Gryffindor or Slytherin together. All of the beds were occupied by their roommates, leaving only one bed open; Draco’s bed and Potter’s bed. They were most certainly not going to sleep together in one bed. They had both silently agreed on that fact. They had talked about transfiguring a bed out of some other piece of furniture in one of their common rooms, but they both weren’t the best at transfiguration, and they weren’t able to agree on which common room they should occupy.
Harry’s piercing stare was almost too much. It made Draco want to reveal every last one of his secrets right then and there.
“Once I was awake, Father told me to go and get you, Malfoy, after I got Potter, and that I was to stun you and levitate you to the edge of the forest. But, you heard me coming, and I couldn’t risk you finding out I was there until you confronted my father. I was in the Slytherin quarters though, so I figured I’d throw you off my trail by leaving a green tie.”
that might be a little bit too dark, even for him, but the thought did bring a small smile to his face.
Like Potter had said at Hogsmeade, he needed to do something to actually show he had changed. He knew he couldn’t keep staying silent, he needed to speak up more and join an important cause. Maybe he could somehow join the Muggle Studies class, even if it was mid-January.
“I don’t believe in all of that Pureblood shit, anymore, just so you know.” Draco said quietly. Maybe some part of him still did, but he
The Auror spoke again. “Mr. Potter gave us his memories. However, everything he saw was blurry, and the voices were hard to hear. We did, though, get the part where you killed a man.”
Draco knew he would be a social outcast at Hogwarts, he was expecting it, but he was glad he was away from the manor. That place now haunted his dreams. It was like he could feel the Dark Lord’s presence there, even though he knew that was silly, he was dead.
In all honesty, it was a stupid, reckless plan that would probably end up not working. They weren’t even sure if everyone else in the Wizarding World was subject to the curse too. But Draco had to try. Plus, his plan wasn’t hurting anybody. He wasn’t going to use up the last question from Snape’s book, he wasn’t going behind Potter’s back to plan a murder, he just wanted to know if others were experiencing the same pain as he was.
Even though earlier Draco had wanted to solve everything alone, after the trip to Hogsmeade, a part of him realized he wouldn’t be able to. He did need Potter. As much as he hated to admit it. He was also pretty sure Potter needed him.
Despite the fact that he was already feeling much better ever since he woke up, he downed the potion in one gulp, and was surprised to find that it did not taste as horrible as it looked.
“How much did you see?” Draco asked worriedly. What if Harry had given them all of his memories over the past two weeks? What if they all saw them kiss?
you were dead. I carried your limp body up the castle. You jumped in front of the Killing Curse, to save
There was no one walking by at the moment, but Draco still felt embarrassed by his mother’s embracing nature--which accumulated sometime in the past week. Although, if a student did pass by, he didn’t think he’d mind so much.
section of the library, and already knew it would be another dead end. But he had to do something. He couldn’t just sit around and wait for someone to save them. As Potter had said last night, they were on their own. Well, they were on their own together.
The walk to the Headmistress’s office was not far and as he reached the gargoyle, he spoke the password- which was still crumpets- and stomped up the stairs, throwing the door open and revealing himself to a startled looking Dumbledore and Snape.
Harry didn’t need to respond, for the gleam in his eyes was worth a thousand words. The kiss he gave Draco was strong enough to wipe out the world.
Potter shook his head. “I’m pretty sure I did it right. Look,” Potter showed Draco the page and pointed at different parts, “It’s a simple spell. It’s not supposed to be hard at all. The movement required isn’t even difficult.”
Ron watched him, seeing how animated the younger was and shaking his head. He had a feeling he wasn't going to be losing his best friend status, but Draco would be taking another, “okay,” Ron told him, stopping him mid-sentence as he had a feeling that Harry would have just carried on and on if he hadn’t.
Ron nodded after a moment of thought, “yeah okay, in a couple of days we should have her come to the Burrow and talk to her there.”
"But... But... that's just not possible!" he was yelling at the end, eyes wide as he glanced towards the bed, not wanting to believe the words coming from the man before him, "You're a criminal, you made it up, that's, that is just a... a... conjuration of some kind! Some sort of dark magic!" he finished, seeming to calm down as he thought of a reason for everything going on, "And everyone has just been confounded," he nodded a smirk on his face as he finished his perfect reason.
Ron blinked, looking down at his rat, "Scabbers!" he shook his head, clutching his pet closer, "No, he's a pet."
Thank you for all the awesome and amazing comments and kudos. So happy that so many of you are enjoying this fic! Love you all!!!!
"No thank you, Mrs Weasley, I want to spend a bit of time with Ron," Harry said, shaking his head, hoping that the witch wouldn't try and force the two together again. It had been the same during the summer as well, always sitting Ginny next to him when all he wanted to do was to spend some time with his friends. She was constantly pushed towards them all.
“We’re both dropping Divination and maybe care of magical creatures as well,” Ron told her, not looking up from his work. He was scared, scared of what he would see if he looked at her.
"As soon as I find out, I will try and convince my parents to let me get an owl for the family. So I don't have to wait for Hedwig or Errol," she told him, letting him, "Bye, Ron, and do try and get your homework done before I come and see you," she added, giving the redhead a little glare.
“What do you mean?” Remus asked him, knowing that the other wizard had been having a number of meetings with Albus over the last few days.
"Remus, Sirius, my old friends," a snivelling voice whined as the rat turned man. "Oh, Harry, such a sweet boy," he then started to grovel, as he went towards the teenager.
Harry watched as the woman very efficiently waited for the man to return to consciousness and quickly fed him the serum and asked her questions. Fudge was still blustering that people were lying. When the last question was answered. Madam Bones straightened up as Fudge continued his tirade.
“I ask her to check my own work as well, she does it because she’s our friend and wants us to do our best all the time,” Harry told her, frowning, “now, please leave us alone,” he said as the two of them headed back to Ron’s room, grabbing the lunch that Kreacher had made for the two of them. Ron got Harry to go in front of him when his sister was following.
Sirius shook his head, “I don’t think he would have realised how deep this… that would have gone. Even if the object is destroyed and the thing stops possessing someone, the damage has been done. And it needs to be healed. Just like everything else. She would need to see a healer trained in healing dark arts damage,” he told him. Thankfully, the damage that would have been done would be the same as a few other dark artefacts. There were many objects that mimicked the possession made from a Horcrux.
“No, it’s contained, there is another magic that is containing it, though I think the wards at Privet were shielding it from the rest of us so we couldn’t sense it,” Sirius said, mostly guessing.
“So,” Ron said as he ate the last bite, “you wanted to tell me something?” he asked him, letting Harry put away most of the plates, passing the few that he had.
“I’ll take them, And I think I might drop creatures. Hagrid is great, but… I know I won't really use it after school,” Harry added, “I’m not too sure of what I want to do, but I know it won't be working with creatures.”
“I won't, I’m only going to the drawing-room over there, there were some books that Sirius said were safe to read that he put in there for me,” Harry smiled at him as he then left Remus to go back to the library to try and figure out what else he could try to get rid of the brilliant blue hair.
“It's summer, you should be out playing and having fun, and Ginny is lonely. She’s all alone,” Molly said, trying to coax them into going with her daughter.
“Sirius Black is in a private meeting with Narcissa Malfoy and Sharpclaw, wait until he is free,” he growled at the teenager before him.
Harry stopped, almost causing Ron to stumble as he gripped his friend tightly, "You... you really mean that?" he whispered, shocked, "That I... I could live with you?"
Albus looked up from where he sat on his sofa in his home. It wasn’t often that he gave away the address of where he lived. He had guarded the place as much as he could over the decades since Grindelwald. Not wanting the chance of the one place he could rest and relax to be disturbed by just anyone. “Sirius,” he greeted the wizards. The young man had wanted to meet with him as soon as he could. So Albus had sent him the letter to be able to get in.
“So that's what Ginny was writing in, was one of those?” he asked, “she told me something about a diary,” he added seeing the look Sirius was giving him.
“Hermione is staying at the Burrow now until school. She’s done nothing but try and get me to study with her, to let her help me. I know she’s trying to show that she has changed, but the way she is going about it makes me really uncomfortable. I don't want to let her help at all,” Ron answered him.
“Hermi-” he cut himself off, “she advised both Ron and I that it would be a good one for us to take, that we would be able to get really good marks in it and it would help us, later on, to have a subject that we were good at,” he slumped in his seat, tears in his eyes as he wondered how many lies Hermione had told him, and told to Ron as well.
And I hope you liked what I did for the Samhain holiday. I'm a little nervous about it all. I've actually have a document full of the traditions and holidays that I made up for this story (may even use them for other fics one day).
"Thank you, Professor Lupin," Hermione said primly as she walked into the compartment as she took a seat by the window, opposite Remus. Harry took the one beside the werewolf and the last seat was taken by Ron, the two teen wizards muttering their thanks as well.
Harry thought about it for a moment before he nodded “yeah, you’re right, they were,” he put them away again and then to his surprise Draco began to tell him an easy way of learning the different setups for runes to make them all easier to remember.
Ron and Harry just nodded, “yeah,” they said, non-committal about what she had said. It hurt, and they knew it would for a while as well.
"What are you on about, Ron?" Hermione frowned, leaning a little closer, "Nothing like that should matter at all."
“Wow, don't ever cross a Witch from the Black line, they will devour you. A lot of the women in that line have the nickname black widows, not because they kill their husbands or that, but because they are deadly if crossed and angered,” Ron said, remembering something that Bill had told him.
“Thanks,” Harry smiled and headed to the floo room. Draco was unsure for a moment if he should follow him.
Harry opened his eyes and glanced at the red-headed witch that was making her way towards them. "Hello, Mrs Weasley," he greeted, though not letting go of Sirius at all.
Ron glanced at him, “okay,” he nodded, then once more looking to the ceiling. He knew he had some things to think about, he just hoped that it wouldn't strain his friendship with Harry even more. He had been wrong in what he had said yesterday, he knew that. But, in that moment, he had been hurt, feeling left behind like he always was as he grew up.
"I'm going to take our things to our rooms," Remus said, he already knew which rooms they were going to be staying in. Sirius had told him and showed him as he had stopped by a few days ago to make sure that the place was safe enough for them to remain for a while.
“Well, I’ve changed, and so has Harry. We both have a lot to catch up on. So we’re not going to be playing today. We’re also waiting for Hermione to arrive,” Ron said as he tried to continue with his work.
“It looks like it, Harry, I want to look at some of your work from your first year before you became friends with Hermione and then I might be able to see if she really did start right then,” Sirius asked him.
“Yeah,” he said as he curled closer. Remus had left the two to do some lunch as Harry was going to have some there for a while before coming back. As the two older wizards were going to be sorting a few things out to move to the new place ready for when they had the main move in about a month.
“Herm-” he huffed, “you know, I’m just going to say I thought it would be easy as well. That I wouldn't have to do as many essays and writing. She put that in my head a lot,” he added softly.
“It's fine to have other friends', Mum, but she's making him uncomfortable. She won't leave us alone. He already told her to go away and we want to have fun with just us,” Ron said, gripping his temper as best as he could when she saw Ginny look around his mother, a smirk on her face.
Draco looked away, “I wouldn’t do that. I don't have to do that anymore. My father,” he spat, “doesn’t control me anymore,” he added, gathering his courage and looking at her.
Ron and Harry sat at the dinner table in the Burrow. They were working hard on some work that Remus and Sirius had sent them. It was also the day that they were going to be confronting Hermione on what she had done. To them, there was no good reason for her to do what she did. There couldn’t be. She had ruined their trust in her, and the betrayal that the two of them were still feeling was still painful to think about. It was going to be hard, but for now, they had a few before she would be arriving.
Harry looked over at him, making him quickly redirect his eyes back to his book. The sight, however, still burned in his brain. What shocked him most what that it didn't repulse him one bit.
Suddenly, Neville's face pops into his head. A bright smile etched onto his face. Him holding Neville and watching him blush in front of Blaise. Them going to Honeydukes together and seeing Neville's face light up at the sight of it.
This isn't important but I just looked up the actor who plays Pansy (Scarlett Byrne) and I just realized how pretty she is. How did no one tell me this and how did I not know like what. My lesbian heart omg. Anyways, I just had to vent about that. Ok, goodbye have a good day.
"It's normal to feel heartache. Don't feel so bad about it. You only felt jealousy because well... Neville's never dated literally anyone until now. Again, it's completely understandable why it's so hard for you." Draco says.
Blaise smirks at him, "You could probably guess who. Regardless, it isn't a valid excuse to not let me help you anymore."
"Now, every death eater gets an assignment to prove their loyalty," Voldemort says gently, not failing to give him another chill. For once he wishes that someone, Voldemort exactly, would speak to him angrily like his father. "If you fail, great consequences will be in store." Of course, there was another part of the initiation...
He walks off without another word. He locks himself in his bedroom and lets the tears flow out. He cries and cries with his blanket over his head. He holds it tight to himself, worrying if this will be one of the only things he'll have left of Blaise.
As if on cue, Luna passed Blaise. He didn't fail to give her a glare as she traveled by. Draco watched as she tapped Neville on the shoulder and handed him a plate of cookies. Neville smiled at her and said a few words. She nodded back and skipped away towards the Ravenclaw table. Draco looked over to notice Blaise's hand softly shaking.
"That's the issue! That's what I did to many, many people! I'm just like your bullies! I deserve no sympathy."
Blaise looked at him, wondering if he was ok. He seemed to be upset about saying what he did. Blaise couldn't explain why that would be. He wouldn't have said it if he didn't want to. "Uh, no it's ok. I understand. We don't have to be friends."
They both stop for a while and stare at each other. Harry is looking at him with wide eyes. Draco, on the other hand, is going back and forth from an angry expression to a confused one.
Does this mean Draco likes boys? Is that why he got so upset when Harry joked about it? "Uh... Draco?"
"It was nice. I hope you find a guy much better than me soon. You deserve it." Harry says with a smile.
He walks quickly and gracefully toward the dungeons. "Holly berries." He says clearly and the door to the common room opens immediately. He strides in to find Pansy sobbing in front of the fireplace. She stops as soon as she sees Draco.
Neville never knew someone could like boys. Well, he heard of it, but everyone said it wasn't actually possible. Simply something people choose. Did Blaise choose to like Draco? No, that wouldn't make sense, right? If he could choose, or anyone for that matter, he would've chosen to like Hannah Abbott so it didn't feel so weird around her. Or he'd choose to like Luna Lovegood so perhaps he'd have a chance of someone truly liking him and not lying about it. So, how did other people seemingly choose to like others? It just wouldn't make sense!
"Try uh... Pushing your feet back." Blaise says. Neville does just that and kicks off into the sky at full speed.
Blaise shakes his head at him, "Are you kidding me right now? You really don't see it, do you? If you were me you'd understand. There are these small things about you that... maybe you hate, but they drew me to you. The way you stumble over your feet all the time." He chuckles, "It's adorable. The way you smile... Merlin, I can't describe it. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen... That look you get when you're working in Herbology... Your face just lights up. How you stutter when you talk and fumble around when you're nervous." Neville stares down at his shoes, his cheeks burning red, "And your cute little blush, how could I forget that?"
"Sit." His father demands and Draco quickly obeys. "Sit up straight." He demands again, and Draco obeys once again. "The dark lord will be here soon. I expect you to be obedient and respectful. You will do everything I ask you to and what ever he asks you to. No negotiation. Understood?"
Some of them give him a strange look, but he can't seem to care. They then all walk away without another word. Some went back to their dorms while others remained downstairs. He knew this was an opportunity to read that letter.
Draco quickly wipes his face and swallows the slice. "It's amazing!" He says, which makes Molly perk up.
He was terrified, though. Terrified that Draco was in trouble, terrified that Neville would die or be horribly injured, and most of all he was terrified of you-know-who taking over. If anyone knew where his loyalities lied as a pure-blood Slytherin, he would be dead within minutes of his reign. Then again, if Neville died, would it really matter if he did as well?
They get close to the grounds of Hogwarts and Blaise tells him to let his feet down before landing, and it works! He lands perfectly!
"It's-" His face burned at the squeak he made. He clears his throat softly then whispers, "It's fine, I d-don't need a thanks."
"Of course not, especially not Hermione. If it would make you feel better, I'll threaten to hex Ron if he tells." Harry jokes.
"Now get a hold of yourself. You're embarrassing us all." His father sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, "Why couldn't I have had a normal son? Or better yet no son at all?! Just had to be lucky enough to get you, huh?" Draco stares at the floor. "Sit up." His father demands and Draco fixes his posture. With a deadly glare, his father turns away and leaves Draco alone in his room once more.
"I'm sorry!" Neville says once more, covering his face up with his hands and trying desperately to move away. Blaise still kept his grip strong.
"Your father gets... violent... doesn't he?" Blaise guesses. "I'm sorry if I just offended your family if I'm wrong."
Harry smiles once again and Draco's heart leaps from his chest. "Of course. Now let's get out of here." He chuckles, walking towards the exit.
"I actually felt like that once... When I became friends with Ron and Christmas came, Molly made me a sweater. Ron always hated it, but that present made me feel so special and loved even though I wasn't a part of their family. And when I first came to the Burrow... It was amazing. It was like the loving home I've never had." Harry says. "I understand you completely."
"I know that..." He replies irritably. Goyle rolls his eyes in response and opens his trunk. Grabbing his books for his next classes, and walking out. Draco sighs and soon does the same, walking in silence to his classroom as the other students chat noisily around him.
After a long train ride, they finally are able to get on the ground. He was hoping to see his mother, or maybe no one at all. Sadly, he came face to face with his father. He grabs his arm and drags him away from the train.
"Alright... Well, go get some rest! That'll help for sure! If you want, I could also bring you some cookies tomorrow that my friend made! The house-elves were very upset when he took over the kitchen, but they're so very good!" Luna says.
"Ah... Draco, do you have another story?" Dumbledore asks. Draco shakes his head in response. "Very well... Well, both of you were in the wrong in this, that's for sure. First of all, Draco apologize to Harry." Dumbledore says.
Blaise raises his eyebrows and lowers them before shaking his head with a soft chuckle. "You know nothing, Potter."
He follows closely behind her and they meet outside with the Knight Bus waiting for them. Someone must have called for it.
Neville closes the space between them, but instantly wishes he didn't. Blaise was amazing at it and he never wanted it to end, but Neville couldn't help but realize that he kept ruining it. Their teeth clashed and Neville's face burned. He pulled away and Blaise smiled at him.
He tries to mix it again, but it's still too thick. Blaise sighs. "I keep messing up." He nearly whispers.
Blaise laughs once more, "Thank you. I'm sure if you laughed, I'd like your laugh as well." He smiles at him. Neville blushes even worse this time. He tries to hide his face but fails miserably.
I didn't randomly make up the words "parvus" and "ignis". They are both latin. Parvus means small or tiny. Ignis means flame. In short: Parvus Ignis is a spell I made up that makes your wand act like a lighter.
Draco smirks, he knows it's the time. "Blaise is just mad because you thought he'd ever even think about hurting his boyfriend."
"I know it might make you feel better, but you're harming yourself! It's only a temporary release and it's a bad habit! It only leads to worse things... You can hurt yourself even worse and I don't want you to do that. I really do care about you and I've been worried sick!I know you're hurting, but there's better ways to deal with it. I'll even help you exercise better coping mechanisms. I'm here for you and I'll support you any way I can. But we need to get this sorted out before it gets any worse and you get addicted to it." Harry says.
"Potter, we need to leave," he told him, his voice almost gentle instead of the harsh growl that he would use when speaking to Harry.
“Come on, Ron, you have to admit that’s all you think of. You barely do your homework either, Hermione has to do it for you,” she snorted, as she remembered the times that her brother would ask Hermione to check his work before he submitted it.
"I'll say," Ron muttered, as he looked away when Harry gave him that look of disappointment. Harry had been telling them that they should try to react less when Malfoy comes near to try and lessen what he does. Or rather tries to do to them, as they normally got in trouble when they retaliated against the Slytherin.
“I’ve always had trouble with spelling. It’s why I asked Hermione to look things over in the first place,” Ron said with a shrug.
“I… I know, Harry, but my mind went to jealous town straight away, knowing that the two of you would be able to do a lot more than I could even dream of,” he sighed, flipping on his bed, “I’m really sorry, Harry. I know I have trouble with Slytherins, and out of the school, it doesn't mean shit. But Mum, she always went on about Slytherins and how they killed our uncles and that they were the cause of the war and all things like that.”
Harry gave a small nod, “yeah, I think I should. He knows that you’ve been around but not that we’ve actually talked more than a few words.”
“Divination was just fine,” Molly said, though there was something in her tone that said not even she believed her own words.
“Lucius slipped Ginny Weasley a diary, a Horcrux into her cauldron her first year. I think she might still be suffering from some of the effects of it as well. Told Arthur to get her seen to, to make sure that she has healed from it, but with her behaviour, I doubt it,” Sirius said, and then noticed that Narcissa had paled.
"I was to be their secret keeper, but it was too obvious. Everyone knew how close I was to James, to your father, he was my brother in all but blood," Sirius murmured.
“Hermione,” Harry said, “Sit down,” he ordered. Going into the bag he had brought with him and pulling out one of the examples that he had, one of his own essays, and the marks on it from Hermione and the one he had handed in. “Sit down,” He repeated when she didn’t move.
“Ron, I need you to get Sirius now, as soon as you can, wherever he is, go and get him and make him come back here. Tell him Harry’s scar is like the locket. He’ll know what it means,” he said, eyes still fixated on Harry’s scar.
“I can’t,” he complained, “She fucking staying with us now. And I have her coming to me all the time, trying to get back into my good books and saying that she wants to help me with my studying. I keep having to lock myself in my room. Mum and Dad are getting annoyed with it.”
"But Harry, I came all this way to see you," Ginny murmured, her voice going a little shy, but Harry could see that shyness was put on. That it was fake.
Harry thought for a moment and then nodded, “Sure, we can go flying for a bit?” he asked, a grin on his face as he wasn’t able to go flying where they were at the moment.
Ron turned and faced him, “I know, Sirius pointed that out to me, I need to get over it, and I’m going to try, I just...”
“Yeah, I’ll make sure you do, Sirius should be finished by now,” he smiled softly as he guided his shaken friend past his mother and sister, even though they protested.
Hermione stood up, wand pointed at the two of them, "You can't trust anyone," she remarked. Sending Harry, a quick look, "He's a werewolf."
"In about two hours you'll be able to walk around again, but I would suggest going easy for at least a week," she advised him as she took the flask and went to her office, only to have to almost dance out of the way as Snape was striding out of it, a small glass vial with a silvery liquid inside.
Ron nodded, and then winced as he felt the birds claws dig in a little to keep himself on Ron’s head, “Yeah,” he sighed, reaching up and taking hold of the owl before settling him on his lap, “Think I’ll call you Canon,” he grinned.
Harry looked through them all, “yeah I can see where it works,” he grinned, “you know, I think… I think we should have had Ron over as well.”
“Same here, I don't know if I want her at the Burrow. I know that we are going to have her there soon, as you promised her parents. But I might not talk to her much when she is,” Ron told his Dad.
“Hey yourself, you look like shit Harry, you sure you want to do this today?” he asked him, a worried frown on his face.
“This child wants to see one of our clients that are currently in a meeting,” he answered, nodding to his superiors and then gripping his spear tighter as he glared at Ron.
Molly looked at him, “And why have you changed? Really, why would you do something like that? I thought you were happy with your choices.” She questioned.
Sirius thought for a moment and then sighed, “I’m only telling you this because I think you have a right to know. But… do not tell anyone else, especially not Molly. Albus and Narcissa know what they are, but that's all,” he said to him, his voice taking on a forceful tone.
“The diary had a hold of her and she couldn’t let it go. She did figure out the diary was responsible and tried to throw it away,” Ron added, remembering what Harry had shown him.
“Right, I’m going to call Harry down, I was going to take him to see the new place. But I think I might leave that for tomorrow,” he sighed, turning to the skies and yelling, “Harry, we’ve got to go now!”
“Oh, my word!” Arthur said, hand covering his mouth, “Bill... Bill has come across a number of those, he told me what they are and what they can do, they are… they are…”
“Draco thinks that there is something similar in his scar as well. Draco is scared and worried about it. But…I don't think that it’s harming Harry that much at the moment. It hasn't been done yet, though I don't know why,” he murmured at the end.
“That's fine. I’m no longer sure I can trust her,” Arthur sighed heavily. Hermione seemed like such a good girl. He wondered why she had done it.
“I’m so fucking stupid,” he cursed himself as he left his room and headed downstairs. He needed to explain a few things to Harry. Maybe if he could make Harry see where he was coming from, he would be forgiven for being a prat.
"And with the fame, you couldn't?" Harry asked he was curious as to what the Headmaster could tell him. Nothing had been written down with what happened after Grindelwald's defeat.
“So, you see, just remember that little rhyme and you’ll remember all nine ways that runes can be set out,” he said as he finished writing down the last set up.
“He’s right, Mum,” Ron told her softly, “She could have put us in danger, you know the type of things that have been happening at the school,” he added.
"Was it really that bad?" Harry asked, looking at him, trying to see if he could tell if the man was lying to him.
Sirius sighed, knowing that he would have to talk with Ron one of the days. He knew that most of the kid’s hatred for Slytherin was from his mother and her influence on him. But he could see that it was lessening as time went by. He would just have to make sure that Ron knew what he was doing and that the last of Molly's influence on him would leave.
What I said about Ron's family, you may recognise from another fic I wrote. It's somewhat like a mini headcanon I have for the family.
“Like I said Mrs Weasley, what she did could have caused us a lot of major problems. This is something that Ron, Hermione, and I have to work out between us, you do not need to… butt into our business,” Harry told her, keeping his voice calm and even.
Sirius took a small drink of his own before he added, “Yeah, that's what I remember of it as well, but what I know is that this had a hold of Harry, trying to make him open it. It contained a part of a soul. Voldemort’s,” he told him.
“I don't think this is a good idea, Harry,” said Hermione, bristling at the thought of Draco Malfoy being anywhere near her.
“Hmm,” she nodded, “Is Harry all right?” she then asked, seeing the concerned look on her cousin’s face.
The goblin stood before some doors and knocked loudly. “I apologise for the interruption,” he called out, waiting to be let into the room.
“It’s fine, I’ll be like this for a couple of days according to Sirius,” he sighed, pulling himself into a sitting position with Ron’s help. Harry told him what Sirius had explained to him before the two of them started to get their work out and go through it. It was going to be the second time that Draco was over to tutor them in Arithmancy and Runes. Ron was looking forward to going through the Arithmancy part of the work. He found it a lot easier to deal with than Runes.
Sirius nodded in agreement, “That's what I thought as well. Molly doesn't know what dark magic can really do. Your Dad, on the other hand, he would,” he sighed softly.
“Thanks, Ron for being so understanding,” he smiled, he could see the flare of temper in the blue eyes and changed the subject, “So is it like this with Ginevra all the time?” he asked, wondering about the words spoken.
“Exactly,” she smirked, “Though I have thought of something concerning the locket,” she said, “though, has it been destroyed?” she then asked.
“Yeah.” Harry nodded, “My second year, Ginevra was possessed by a shade of Voldemort. She took control of the basilisk that was in the chamber of secrets, set it on the school. We know she wasn’t hurt, but Voldemort took her over. She almost died,” he added.
"You don't have to call me that anymore," Remus said, "Especially since we'll be living together. so call me Remus,"
Harry nodded rapidly, "yeah, he said that he and his mother believed in you and that they are both happy you're free once more."
“Right, I’ve looked through the essay that you’ve written first before Hermione looks through them,” Sirius said, “And out of the two of those I read that you wrote, well, they were really good, would have got you some high grades.”
SURPRISE!!!!!! Second chapter for you all. Going to try and update again on Friday, do not hold me to it, you know what I'm like. BUT I WILL TRY!
“Albus would have told us if we needed to take her to see someone,” she frowned, getting up, “now stop talking about it. I don't want to remember it and I don't want Ginny to even think of it!” she warned him. She returned to the stove.
Arthur led the way into the Burrow going over to Molly, “I’m taking Ginny to St Mungo's in the morning to be checked out for dark magic damage,” he informed her.
“Because I wasn’t doing well. If I want to do something worthwhile, I need to have the right subjects. Someone told me a few falsehoods that I should have realised was that,” he said, berating himself as he looked to his work.
“At least you’re able to do something about it all now,” Albus tried to console him, unsure if it would be welcome.
"Harry," Ron nudged him as a beautiful barn owl began to head towards him. Landing neatly beside Harry's plate.
“Yeah, it’s fine, really,” Harry reassured them, “Look, I know and understand what he was like at school, but we’re not at school and he can finally leave what his Dad told him behind him. Give him a chance, and you… you might make a friend,” he added, hoping they would give the blond a chance.
"Yeah," Ron nodded, "I think Sirius would be able to explain it all better than me, I didn't pay that much attention," he said ducking a little, "The families we’re mostly tied to are the Prewett family. My grandfather married someone from the Bones family. The Black that married into the family was my Great grandfather that married them. So If it had been my grandfather, then I would have been beholden to pass the message as well."
“I know, and I’m not the type to leave old food around, just give me a chance to prove it,” Harry told him, trying to bargain since he could see that begging wouldn't work.
"Could you... could you tell me about her sometime?" he asked, "Aunt Petunia, she always told me off for asking about my parents when I was young."
“It was fun, your friends are… nice,” Draco said softly, from where he had perched himself on a chair nearby.
“Then yeah, I’ll do the same,” Ron nodded, looking at Harry, “I don't know what to, though. I’m not really good with other things.”
“You sabotaged our work. Every single essay we wrote would have gotten better marks had you not butchered them. And please, don’t tell me that you were getting the same answers as ours. Remus talked to me about how your answers had all the information that ours didn’t,” Harry answered her, explaining a little more.
Harry and Draco followed, joining in on the fun. Though Hermione glaring at the two of them occasionally and at Draco. However, the others in the group decided to give him a chance. Harry and Ron had to help him at least once, to escape a prank that the twins had tried to pull on him.
“Oh hey, Ron, sorry,” he laughed, eyes bright and mouth turned up. He looked behind him, waiting for the floo to activate again. When he didn’t, he turned hopeful eyes towards Ron. “No Ginevra?” he asked, still refusing to use her nickname, even if it was just Ron around him.
“I’m okay, not I’m out of the room, I’m really fine, honestly.” He said with a smile on his face as he tried to reassure his godfather that he was okay.
Thank you for all the awesome comments and kudos!!! I love and adore you all. I hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
"Of course," she nodded, "I'm going to send for Shacklebolt to come and take this thing away and get him set up as well. And into an anti-magus containment cell." With that, she left the room to call for Shacklebolt and another Auror.
“Okay, here's the thing, I’m the youngest of six boys. I had no friends at all. I tried to hang out with them and they would always leave me behind, push me away, because I was too young to play the big boy games. I’d try to play with Ginny, but she hated doing that. I was a boy and not a good person to play with in her mind. So I was always alone, every time something came up, I was alone, left to the side nearly all the time,” he said as he tried to explain what he was feeling, “And then I made a friend, with you, and I finally had someone I could hang with, play with, have fun with and it was great, awesome, magical,” he snorted.
“I myself did Arithmancy,” Arthur added, a smile on his face, “I know we still have books from when Bill took those two courses as well,” he added, hoping to know that his brother took them that would persuade Ron to do the same. He had been disappointed when he had learned that Ron had chosen Divination and Molly hadn’t talked him out of it.
“Like a tutor?” Sirius asked as he thought for a moment, “that could be a good idea,” he nodded, smiling at the two of them.
"I wanted to, by Merlin that is all I wanted, but he escaped me, yelling for all to hear that I killed Lily and James. Then... the paper, I got the paper and there he was right on the front page," he said pointing at Ron, "on the front page was Pettigrew and I knew he would try to go for you Harry, and I couldn't let it happen, I couldn't. So, I escaped, went to see you, and then went after him. He's right here, and now I can finally bring the truth out and he can pay."
“Sorry for just holding you all the time,” Draco said, a little awkward, a light speckle of red adorning his cheeks as he spoke.
"Oh, yes," Molly said as she turned to her sons, "We should head home, oh Ginny dear," she called out as she saw her only daughter walking towards her.
Harry looked from his friend back to the blond, "Okay, so what is the message?" he asked the Slytherin.
“I… I  know, but she was… it was like she was trying to tell me that I could replace Mum,” he said, tears in his eyes as he-is voice wobbled.
"How?" Harry's eyes went wide, he had never told Ron about what the sorting hat had said. The only person that knew he could have been in the house of snakes was the hat and Dumbledore.
“I think you should wait for Dad to get back. You should be able to talk to him better than Mum. Mum never wants to listen to anyone other than Dumbledore. We all know that he wouldn’t know that much about dark magic,” Ron said, wrinkling his nose a little.
Thank you all for the awesome comments and kudos! Love and adore you all. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
“I only quit because I was constantly on edge about someone finding out, or I forget the potion,” he added, “it gave me nightmares,” he admitted softly.
Thank you for all the awesome comments and kudos, love and adore you all. Hope you've enjoyed this chapter as well!
“You look like-” Draco started as soon as he saw him only to stop and focus on his forehead, “Harry,” he said softly, almost cautiously, “you have a headache, yes?” he asked him.
“He’ll know nothing because of you,” Molly interrupted, “you are teaching him that those that attacked his own parents are fine to be around!” she yelled.
“He isn't your friend!” Ron yelled back, “he has told you twice now to leave us alone, so just do so. You-”
Harry closed his eyes and made a wish that he knew was futile. Turning around he saw Ginny standing there, wearing a nice yellow sundress, her hair done up special as well. Harry knew she was trying to draw attention to herself again. Ever since he had a go at her she had been the same. Molly had been even more determined to try and push the two of them together when he had first arrived. If it wasn't for the twins pulling a prank and taking their mother's attention away, he would have been stuck in the house with Ginny and not outside with Ron throwing the garden gnomes over the fence.
Sirius looked at Harry as they stood in the floo room, “Sorry, Harry, I know you wanted a little more time before you saw Ron,” he said softly, patting the young teenager on the back.
"Really, Harry, did you have to rush off like that," Hermione huffed as she settled her wheeled truck beside her, Crookshanks carrier being settled on top of that as well, "My parents will be waiting on the other side, so I'm going to go now, we might be able to leave before the traffic really hits," she added, as she went over to Harry, "You write as much as possible," she warned him as she pulled her friend into a hug, pulling him away from Sirius.
Their handshake abruptly ended, and the two were about to say something when Madam Bones walked back in with a tall, dark wizard following behind her. "Shacklebolt, take him to the cells, don't let anyone see him, I want only the two I mention and you on him at all times. And I want the same for Sirius Black as well. The minister may try something," she warned as she gestured to the wizard unconscious and bound on the bed.
“He hasn’t been,” Harry said before she could even speak a word, “So far he has done more to help us than hinder us, which he hasn’t done at all.” Harry growled at her, “Now drop it, Hermione,” he finished going to walk away.
“He doesn’t want to leave you behind, he wants you to join him. It is a new friendship, and he wants you beside him. He knows you care about him and thinks very highly of you. But sometimes he just needs to branch out a little more. You also have to remember that he isn’t just going to go out into the wizarding world as an unknown. He is the Heir of House Black and of House Potter. He's going to have to learn a lot that you won’t need,” Sirius told him, “All the traditions that you grew up with have relaxed, but a lot of people still follow them. I know I do, it’s hard since I know Harry doesn't,” he added, sighing softly.
“Yes, and I want to talk about taking Divination,” Sirius began, “Ron, you should know that no one in the wizarding world would be looking to that as a qualification,” he said as he looked to the redhead.
“The magic used is really dangerous. What you came across in Grimmauld place is the same type of magic. You felt the same type of pull that Ginny would have done. That's only the beginning of that ‘type’ of dark magic. It’s… bad, very,” he told him, his voice sounded worried.
“Oh, what are you working on?” she asked them, as she stepped over and began to look, “Why are you studying arithmancy?” she then asked, puzzled.
“That’s because I have trouble with the words. I ask her to make sure I mean what I want to mean,” he huffed, he had always had trouble with reading and understanding a few of the words. He often got them mixed up. Though his grades could improve more if he was honest. He wasn't always doing his best since Hermione always said he messed up and got a lot of the facts he was putting down wrong.
“They had no choice but to follow the blond prat,” Sirius snorted, he was no fan of Lucius Malfoy, not many were if they knew what he was truly like and didn’t see the manipulations that he did with those around him.
“Yeah, it’s… fine,” Harry shrugged as he let the slightly older teenager into his room. He closed the door as soon as Draco was inside and went back to the large oak desk that dominated part of the room.
Molly huffed, but did so, turning the stove off as she then wandered over and sat down. Her eyes were hard and glaring at Sirius, “What is it?” she asked, impatiently.
Molly huffed but moved away, keeping an eye on them as they carried on their work. It was almost an hour later when the floo flared up as Hermione stepped through.
Harry just nodded, "We should head to the castle," he advised, "I... I don't want to linger here," he finished, looking over at Ron.
Harry’s frown deepened, and he took his spot across from Draco again on the blanket. “What’s wrong, then?”
It was like Déjà vu. His mother’s warm arms wrapped around him, her grip strong and firm, but the gesture full of so much emotion. This exact hug had been repeated so many times today and throughout the past week; but it never got old. The only difference this time was that the hug was filled with indescribable, pure happiness--no ounce of sadness or grief to be found.
The two of them had spent a good amount of time in that room together, Draco stirring the potion while Harry sat on the nearest table and talked to him about anything. He figured it was a good, and sentimental, place to look.
Potter tucked Snape’s book into his coat pocket- since it was small enough to fit- and Potter’s coat pockets were oddly ginormous.
“You deserve someone who sees you for you. Someone who knows the good and the bad parts of you, and accepts it.” Harry was so, so obviously talking about himself, even though he didn’t outright say “Me,” or “I.”
He crept over to the side of her bed, thinking how it was foolish trying to be silent when he was going to wake her up anyway.
“There’s something else carved into the door,” Draco observed. It was near the design of the waterfall. Having said that, when Draco saw what other words were carved, his stomach dropped.
“So you’re using me to get out of trouble.” Potter crossed his arms over his chest, and steadied his hard, unwavering gaze at Draco. Draco felt intimidated by that stare. He always felt like he was nothing, compared to the great Harry Potter, and that stare ensured the thought.
Harry stepped up to the portrait of fruit, and tickled the pear; the entrance appearing and both of them walking inside, still not touching each other.
The remaining Purebloods were all scared of death, and the Halfbloods and Muggle-Borns were enjoying living a free life.
He had to lift himself out of Harry’s grasp to see what Harry was looking at, and he immediately felt the warmth travel out of him. Though, when he saw what had grabbed Harry’s attention, he smiled, and began to stand up.
He could just make out the tears forming in her eyes. “It’s not a problem, Draco.” She gave another smile. “You were-
“Meet me at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, near the gates that lead out to Hogsmeade, and-” the Figure kicked Harry’s body again, which made Draco’s blood boil about a thousand times over, “you can save your precious Savior.”
In all honesty, he didn’t want to die. He was terribly afraid of facing death in either one of the ‘
Draco heard Harry shout an almost inaudible “Ugh!” as he presumably left the door, hopefully realizing Draco wasn’t going to let up and say anything.
“Yeah,” Draco responded, just as shocked at what was happening before their eyes. What he and Potter shared
He’d told himself he was going to be productive. He was going to look out after Hogwarts, defending the school from a hooded figure. And, possibly, if he came across Harry, he would try to apologize to him for the hundredth time.
“Well you don’t get to say that when you constantly get up from your seat.” Harry crossed his arms, falling into a prideful stance that clearly said he wasn’t backing down from this argument. “What are you reading now, anyway?” He pointed at the book laid out in front of Draco with his wand.
Draco looked Narcissa in the eye and steadied his feet, hoping he wasn’t coming off extremely anxious. “I’m gay,” he finally blurted out.
Harry was being incredibly gentle, taking his time and looking up at Draco to get his reassurance to keep on. Draco found it hard to believe he’d ended up with a man this thoughtful and caring, let alone that man being Harry Potter.
“Harry, what is all this?” Draco walked closer to the center of the room, eyeing all the stuff around Harry.
Even though he didn’t really want to ask the question, he had to know the answer. “Did anyone else see- you know.” He lifted his left arm up for a second.
Potter was stunned. He was massaging the spot where Draco had punched him, and Draco wondered if the punch
He quickly rose to his feet, fueling his anger towards something a little more productive than sulking at the Astronomy Tower. He was going to go yell at Snape.
Because what he had learned from all their shared moments was that it made them who they were, and it led them to sitting next to each other in the snow, looking at each other like they were the only two people to have ever existed.
It had been late at night and Draco had been exhausted, so Potter reluctantly agreed they should head to the Room of Requirement.
They laid out the book on defensive spells on top of the table they had been occupying, and started skimming through pages trying to find spells that seemed useful in a showdown.
Draco wasn’t sure of exactly what happened next, but he thought he felt Harry press a soft kiss into his hair. Harry didn’t need to respond to what Draco had just said. The supposed kiss contained a million words that were impossible to say aloud.
They pocketed their respective photos, taking extra care as to not crumple them, and went back to sitting in the snow, watching the stars.
The Nott’s certainly both had a motive to make Draco’s life hell. Theo was angry that Draco hadn’t gone to Azkaban, when his father had. He thought Draco deserved it more than Theo’s father. Draco always thought Theo was right.
“You don’t know that! What if the potion we’re brewing right now ends up not working! We have a week and a day until next Sunday, we-”
“The Room of Requirement. We can have our own two beds, and it will provide us with a bathroom, food and everything if we desire it. It’s perfect. I don’t know why I didn’t think of it before.”
After Pansy finally left, Draco went back to sulking in his hospital bed. He tried to fall asleep, but he wasn’t tired. Madame Pomfrey bombarded him with many questions regarding his physical and mental health when she noticed Draco wasn’t in the least bit tired. He answered them very vaguely, which annoyed her to no end.
He turned around to ensure that his trunk was locked, and caught a glimpse of his bedside table, where he kept his cufflinks.
Groaning at his words, Draco picked up a piece of toast and nodded to his owl as it dropped a letter in front of him and a couple copies of the
“Everything alright over there?” Slughorn called out from behind his desk. He seemed to only be addressing Potter.
“Ugh!” Potter shouted, and Draco snickered. Potter moved to walk besides Draco, with enough distance between them that they wouldn’t accidentally touch each other.
although Draco usually associated that movement when a person wanted to call a dog. Draco thought back to what the Figure had said not that long ago when Draco had asked what he had done to Harry.
“Aren’t you worried about what’s going to happen? I mean I know you told me before that you think nothing huge is going to happen, but…”
He’d gotten kind of used to the faint hum of the Mark over the past week, which was it’s usual state. However, like right now, the Mark burned so painfully Draco was almost always thrust into flashbacks of when he lived with the Dark Lord. Not something he wanted to recount.
He felt the Mark starting to burn more fiercely, and he wondered if he really had made progress. Of course, it wasn’t himself causing the burning, as much as he wished it was, but the Mark itself flaring, as it was quite literally alive. As it had been for two weeks.
Once the vial was completely emptied, Draco took another look at Harry, who pulled him into a bone crushing hug. Draco melted into the warm embrace, and took a deep breath, letting all his worries flood out of him as Harry wrapped his arms tighter around his waist. After what felt like an hour, which in reality was only really thirty seconds, they both let go of each other and stood to watch Theo’s body.
“Yeah, we need to prepare, now that we know about these things. We need to find them, destroy them and find the shade that's still around. As soon as we do that, then we can get rid of him for good,” Sirius smirked, eyes alight with fire. He needed that bastard destroyed for what he had done to those in his life and he would do his darndest to make sure that Harry remained safe. Getting up, “Right, I’m going to watch Harry and suffer a few heart attacks with those dives of his,” he snorted as Arthur got up as well.
“Oh, Harry, you don't know any better,” she said condescendingly, “he just thinks that he makes a good father figure, but really he isn’t. He was so irresponsible in school, it was hard to take him seriously even out of it.”
“Have a good think about what type of friend you want to be with Harry, he cares about you a lot, you’re his first friend. Don't ever forget that. You are the one closest to him,” he said as he got up from the camp bed that was set in Ron’s room.
Sirius glanced at him, a curious look in his eyes as he replied, "Yes, I do, you’re family Harry, and I would love it if you would. But if you... you want to stay with your family. I would understand."
Madam Bones broke the seal and checked the potion to verify what it was and then nodded, "Thank you, with your assistance and with Albus', would it be all right for the two of you to help me question Pettigrew of everything?" she asked.
Ron nodded, eyes still narrowed as he wondered why Harry was stuck on being held a little, “What else can you tell me?” he asked him.
“Of course,” Draco nodded, stable now that he had some time to settle his nerves after he realised that something really bad could have happened to Harry if he hadn’t stopped him. Helping the younger wizard up off the floor he guided him to the living room where the floo was.
“Yeah,” Harry said as they headed down to the ground. As soon as they landed Ginny was over to them, like a shot.
“I’ve heard a few of the students talk about them, always sounded like a dream to me,” he laughed lightly.
“Hey Sirius, Draco really helped me with Runes and the layouts. I think he might be able to help Ron and I, in learning things better,” Harry said.
“Still, thank you, I don't know what would have happened, but from the way it sounded, it would have been bad,” he said, feeling more like himself the longer he was out of that room for.
Sirius and Narcissa took in the sight. Draco kneeling on the floor, shaking with Harry in his arms, who looked a little uncertain as he looked around him. “What happened?” Sirius asked as he went over to them, kneeling beside them, he placed a calming hand on Draco’s back, and ruffled Harry's hair, trying to get the youngster's attention as Harry was looking around the room in puzzlement.
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, “come on, Draco, we can fly for a bit longer until your mother comes,” he suggested, seeing Draco looking a little subdued.
Thank you for all the awesome comments and kudos, I love and adore you all, thank you. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
“Come on,” Sirius said as he activated the floo and the two stepped through and into the warm kitchen of the Burrow. Harry looked around and saw Ron walking towards him.
"No, we're not, and I would suggest before waking him, that you stop him from being able to transform, he is an Animagus, takes the form of a rat," Snape told them, giving Sirius a look to tell him to be quiet.
"No, people wanted me for everything. They wanted to show me this, or that. Wanted my help with something. It was demand after demand. It felt like I was being pulled apart. In the end, it was your grandfather that gave me an out. Told me I should travel a little, and I did. I let the flame die down enough that when I got back, I could carry on with what I truly wanted to do," he smiled.
“Why don't you go and ask him? Your cousin and I have some things that we need to talk about,” Narcissa told her son as she began to shoo him away.
Hermione then walked away, leaving them alone as she said, “Goodbye Mrs Weasley,” she then left through the floo, an air of defeat around her.
Hermione looked up, her eyes were red as she turned to Harry, “I’m so sorry Harry, please, please don't leave me alone,” she begged him.
“Nice one, Harry!” Ron yelled out as he swung around with his own gnome and tried to make it go as far as his friend had managed.
Hey all, sorry for missing last week. Things were going on, but things are a little calmer this week.
“We… we need time. I can’t say that we’ll be as close as we used to be. We might not ever be best friends again but maybe we can be friends after a while,” Harry said, giving her a little hope. He didn’t know if he could be close to her again.
“His social standing, Malfoy’s, Lucius Malfoy, that is, well, it would drop. It's because he married into the Black family that he went so high in the ladder,” Ron nodded, “With a divorce and a breaking of the betrothal which would have to have a good reason behind it, then yeah, it would put him down a lot. He wouldn’t have half the influence he has now,” he snorted, “that is a nice thought, couldn't happen to a nicer bloke either,” he grinned at Harry.
“Yeah, I think it might be best. Ginny and Mum are getting worse,” Ron nodded as he went back through the floo.
Sirius sat up at that, “Harry, do you happen to have all your essays, the ones before Hermione edited them and the ones afterwards?” he asked him, keeping his voice level.
"That's... that's Sirius Black!" he yelled out, pointing in horror at the man that was standing next to Harry, "I'll get the Dementors, he needs to be kissed."
“I think we should take a few days and then talk to her. We don't want this over our heads for a long time,” Harry said to Ron.
“Of course they are, they’re not disgusting Slytherins like you,” Hermione snapped at him, sneering as the teens all looked at her.
Harry got up, a little shaky at the thought of such a betrayal. Rushing to his room, he searched through his drawers for all his first-year things. It took a few, but he found them and took them downstairs. Along with some that Hermione had redone with him.
“Yeah, sorry, Harry, but it might take a few days for them to fully break, and when it does you’ll have the worst headache, but it will clear up after a couple of hours,” he said, patting him on the shoulder, “it’ll be just fine, now eat up,” he advised, “I need to head to Gringotts, Draco will be coming by a little later as well, like you asked. And I’ll be with Narcissa at the bank. Remus, you have an errand as well?” he asked the werewolf.
“Okay,” Sirius agreed with an easy nod. He knew his godson was avoiding the two Weasley women, and he didn’t blame him.
"Well, this should change that," he said, patting the teen on the shoulder. Snape looked back towards the trial as Pettigrew was brought in first. One by one the two of them were called up to testify what they knew. Ron and Hermione could have also been called, but it was deemed unnecessary for having so many come as witnesses. Harry smiled in satisfaction as Pettigrew was sentenced to Azkaban for the rest of his life. It was then that Madam Bones announced the next case. There were a few shrieks, but not as many as there would be after hearing the testimony from Pettigrew.
“Mrs Weasley,” Harry said before she could start a tirade against her son for his behaviour. “We really will leave and go back to my home, now please, let us do our work,” he told her, keeping his voice calm as he looked at the woman that had been doing nothing but causing trouble with him since the moment she had learned that he was to be living with Sirius. She had been snipping at the man, trying to be subtle in her words of derision against him.
Harry woke up that morning feeling as though he was going to be sick at any moment. He had Ron and Draco coming over. They were going to have a good study session. Though Ron was coming early to get away from Hermione. She had been bugging him the day before and he had ended up sending a plea to Harry to come over early. Harry didn’t mind at all so he had told him to come early. Getting up and dressing was a chore and a half as he finished dressing and went downstairs.
“No, you’re not,” Remus said as he walked past the room, “you’re still a teenager,” he muttered, running a hand through the bright blue hair that Sirius was charmed on him that morning. He still hadn't been able to get it back to normal, and the Animagus was being tight-lipped on how he had achieved it.
They emerged from the tunnel and into the moonlit night. In the distance they could hear a howl, knowing that it was Remus. But it wasn't a sorrowful sound, it sounded more like joy, happiness. Sirius gave a small smile, "You know, Harry, your parents wanted me to raise you."
"Okay," Sirius grinned as they took the final path towards the castle. Harry was smiling the whole way, as Hermione followed behind them. Ron winced in pain occasionally as they went up the stone steps that led to the main door into Hogwarts. Snape leading the way with Pettigrew floating behind him.
“Thank you,” he said, trying not to get teary at the sight of his friends being there. All of his dorm mates were there, as well as the Weasleys. Draco had also turned up, but he had been standing near the back of the group since he arrived, not wanting to be noticed, but Harry could see him. Hermione had also come, but that was because she was now staying at the Burrow until school began. Ginny was there, but she had been warned to remain away from Harry. The teen was glad she was receiving treatment for what she had been through and hoped that it would help her.
It took a few moments before the owl finally landed on Ron’s head, preening the red hair as he settled down on his new perch. “Well,” Ron grumbled, though there was clear amusement in his eyes.
Sorry for not updating yesterday, a headache sapped everything I had, but feeling better today, so have a chapter!
“Sir, please,” Ron said, “I know Sirius is in an important meeting concerning the House of Black. But what I have is something that concerns the heir of House Black and Potter,” he told him, “He’s fallen ill and Sirius needs to get back because we think it’s magic-based.”
"But they would have taken you out, to show you off to let the fame that had been heaped on you fall on you at such a young age. I wanted you to be away from that. When I... I defeated Grindelwald, I had that fame heaped on me, it was the worst thing that had ever happened as far as I'm concerned," he spoke softly, almost hesitantly, "All I wanted was to rest, to be a normal man and to carry on with what I wanted to do in my life."
“You will,” Draco nodded, “I’ve been doing so, I’ve no doubt you will as well,” he smirked a little when Harry sighed.
Harry watched them go, feeling a little freer without Ginny there, "So, shall I show you my room, it's amazing!" he grinned as he headed out of the living room, Ron following behind him.
“No,” Harry answered bluntly, “I’m sorry Mrs Weasley, but I have work I need to do. And so does Ron, and then we need to have a good talk with Hermione about something private,” he added, glancing up and taking the book back that the woman had taken from him.
“I don't need a mother, I had one, one that gave her life. So you’ll have to forgive me, Mrs Weasley, if I refrain from calling you in such familiar terms,” he said, his voice shaking as Ron reached out to him and put a calming hand on his arm.
Harry stood nearby, Sirius next to him as Hermione settled down on another bed. Sirius placed a hand on Harry's shoulder, smiling at him, "You all right?" he asked him softly.
“Your results for the year arrived,” Sirius smiled at him, “I’ve looked at them and I have to say they’re not bad, but they could be better.”
“I am not that close to you, so I would prefer not to,” he told her, making sure to remove any of the annoyance he had in his voice.
“You made our work be downgraded each time we asked you for help. I asked you and trusted you,” Ron said, his voice getting a little loud.
Sirius sighed and then glanced towards Arthur, “I’ll talk about it in a moment, I want to talk with Ron first,” he told the older man.
“You said that you would die while choking on a snitch,” he snorted, “Didn’t you do that first year?” he asked.
“Destroy the locket, I couldn’t do it, Master Reggie asked me, and I failed Master Reggie,” he continued to wail.
“That's no excuse, you could have done a lot of damage, hell you did. I thought the wrong things for almost all of my classes and that could have ruined my future and could have left me vulnerable in certain classes,” Harry told her, shaking his head, a frown on his face.
"Bars on the window, a cat flap in the door. My meals sent through them were only soup and stale bread that I gave to Hedwig. You think I'm making this shit up?" Harry hissed at her, eyes narrowing in anger at the disregard Hermione had for what he had been through with the Dursleys. "They would have happily heard of my death and danced on my grave. They didn't want me at all. They thought they were being watched by wizards and that's why they did so. Vernon and Petunia hated me, locked me away and kept me hidden from those around them. Ashamed that I was a wizard, so no, he wasn't lying. Just people ignoring what children had to say, and once again we see that you think more about the adults than your own mind."
“That was awesome,” Harry grinned as the last guest had gone. Though the Weasleys and Draco were still there.
“Yeah, it feels like it to me, go get him, it… it looks like it's part of his scar, but contained,” he said, eyes narrowing as he looked at it, wanting to get closer, but was a little scared of what could happen.
Ron and Harry dug into the food, they could hear Molly and Ginny whining and calling to the two of them as they ate, but the two teens ignored them. Enjoying their meal in peace without the two harridans around for a bit.
"Mrs Weasley keeps pushing us together all the time. I know Ginny has a crush on me, but... she's..." he gave a weak shrug, like he wanted to say something but couldn't.
“It’s like she’s taken almost half of your right answers and changed them to wrong ones,” Remus finished, “I’m sorry, Harry, but she’s sabotaging your work. When you asked her to look it over, how long into your first year did it happen?” he then asked, wondering if he could get an idea on how Harry’s first year went with his grades.
“Okay, I’ll do both as well,” he said, breaking the hug and smiling, looking at Sirius and Remus, “Do you think you could help me as well?” he asked.
Going to attempt to try and update this twice a week, and maybe even three times a week. There is a LOT, it's over 160k in length. One of my longest fics.
“Okay,” he nodded, “Yell if you need something. Narcissa and Draco should be arriving soon,” he added as a small warning, though he knew that Harry would be well behaved.
“Not all Slytherins are bad,” Harry said, “or are you forgetting yourself and Pettigrew,” he added coldly, making Hermione gasped.
Harry's eyes followed him until he was out of sight. Hermione looked at him and Ron sent him a reassuring smile. He walked over to Ron's bed and sat down as Madam Pomfrey began to check over the other two teens as the Headmaster left the room with Snape.
Thank you all for the amazing comments and kudos. I love and adore you all so much! Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
Ron walked into the room behind his friend and grimaced a little at the colour. It was dark green, with areas of blue here and there. "Slytherin colours?" he asked, wondering why it hasn't changed.
“Harry, I’m going to scan you a second all right?” he asked, getting a nod in response. Sirius scanned him and there was a slight glow around the scar. He slumped, “yeah, it is going to have to talk to the goblins about it, we need to find out what they can do to help.”
"Don't even think of going anywhere near him," Sirius growled at him, getting in the way, "This time, I'll happily go back to Azkaban after killing you."
“Remus, Harry needs to come home,” Ron said, “Just let him go to Sirius and I’ll explain,” he added, seeing the concerned look on the werewolves’ face.
“You forget, Molly, that I was a fully trained Auror by the time I was twenty and worked damn hard in that line of work. Now I am responsible for the House of Black and Regent of the House of Potter. I take it all seriously, including to make sure that Harry knows-”
“Okay,” Ron said and rushed from the room. He ran down the stairs to the floo room and took the floo to the Leaky Cauldron. “Hey Tom!” he yelled out, greeting the owner of the Leaky Cauldron as he darted down the alley and towards Gringotts. He knew that's where Sirius was, but couldn't remember where Remus was.
“She really is…” Remus trailed off, shaking his head and putting his own set down. He had gone through three, and all three of them were the same.
"Yeah, yeah," Ron muttered, rolling his eyes. He wanted to have fun in the summer. And with Harry now with a wizarding family, he might be able to visit and have some fun with Harry during the holidays instead of having to be around family all the time.
“Morning,” he mumbled, going to the table and taking a seat, slumping in his chair, head in his arms and eyes already closing.
“As long as Lucius’ plans don't come back to bite us, that's fine,” he said and then asked, “So, where were we?”
“They are fine. Molly was going on about you being disrespectful,” he said, almost singing at the words, but able to hold it back.
"Thanks, Ron," he smiled, getting one back, "I just didn't want people to link me to Slytherin and Voldemort all the time if I went there. And I had met Draco, and he reminded me of my cousin too much."
"Hi Ginny," Harry gave her a nod, "Sirius, would it be all right for Ron to come over tomorrow?" he asked, as he thought about what he would be doing.
“Do so, please, keep me informed of what's going on. I’d like to know if she’s okay. It’s harmful magic, and I really don't like the thought of her going through so much. She’s still only very young,” he added softly, patting Arthur on the shoulder.
"The essay Snape set, it was easy to figure out after that," she replied almost smugly as Harry slowly stood up and pointed his wand at the two of them.
Harry glanced up from where he had rested his head against the desk, “hey, Draco,” he smiled tiredly.
"Mother," Percy said from behind her, "It's obvious that they are being boys at the moment, let them have their time together," he added, "We should start heading home if you have left dinner cooking. It might ruin otherwise." Ever the diplomat in the family, Percy could see that Ron and Harry were getting annoyed. It was something he noticed during the summer as well, that his mother was always trying to push Ginny towards Harry, no matter how uncomfortable the brunette was with the attention.
"I forget that to the wider public I'm known," he murmured, looking away, embarrassed at the attention he was getting.
“Well, Mum and Ginny aren’t there, so you should be fine to come over?” Ron suggested as he glanced at his friend.
Ron closed the door and locked it with the muggle lock before using something Bill had given him and magically locking it as well. Bill had said that his mother wouldn’t be able to unlock it, but Percy and twins would. Just in case something happened. “Okay, we’re safe here now,” he sighed as he flopped down on his bed.
"Look, you don't have to accept or anything. I had a lot of time to think, in there, and I realised that I had become what I didn't want to be, just like my mother. I hated her with a passion for what she put me through, and I was practically doing the same to you. So I'm sorry, and I hope we can get past it. I doubt we will ever be bosom buddies, but I respect what you did. I know a little, even after all that time in there. So thank you for the help in making sure they listened and not kissed me on sight," he said, hand still out.
“A lot of hard work. I know. Sirius and Remus are helping us in catching up. We will have to take a month or two with the third years, and then we can take the exam and see if we can move up to fourth year,” Harry told her, finally looking up from his work. He felt the sting of betrayal once again.
“It’s the same, he may not have been getting O’s all the time with his spelling, but that can be rectified,” he said.
“I’ll make sure. If I have to, I’ll call Bill and Charlie to help,” he nodded as the two left the Burrow and Ron continued to listen to his parents argue.
Narcissa and Sirius went to the living room, “thank you for having us over again Sirius, Lucius is getting unbearable,” she huffed a little, sitting down as Kreacher served the two of them some tea.
“Not Harry,” Sirius said as he opened the door, grateful that it hadn’t been locked. But wondered why the younger hadn’t done so when he didn't want to talk to his friend.
Ron got up from his bed. He had been laying on it for almost an hour after Sirius had left him alone. He walked to his window and watched for a while. Harry was flying with the twins. The two brothers were diving and dodging as they went for the smaller wizard. Ron couldn’t help the small smile on his face as he watched. His friend was amazing in the air, and it was always fun to fly with him. You never really knew what would happen next with the green-eyed wizard.
I'm so excited to write the next chapter and all the chapters after that, because its just going to be Draco and Harry and ahhh! But anyways, hope everyone enjoyed this chapter even though I made Draco suffer quite a bit.
And although the only sounds to be heard were their breaths, and the splashes of the fountain, Draco could’ve sworn he heard music playing from somewhere, space, or time.
The gem that usually pressed against his chest wasn’t there, and he hoped someone had taken it to a safe location. He wanted his wand; he wanted to feel the familiar wood, and magic coursing through his fingers.
Potter seemed startled at coming face to face with Draco as he stepped farther into the room, closing the door behind him. He was still in his pyjamas, and his hair was more messy than usual. His cheeks were flushed and he was shivering a bit.
“Very funny. But seriously, go back to casting. I’ll find out what’s making the noise and be back in a minute. You could be practicing very useful spells right now.”
He hesitated. He didn’t want to talk about how Potter had given him no credit for their potions work, and then had basically touched his Dark Mark. Also, now that his mind had slowed down and he could think clearly again, the whole Potter situation was stupid. He didn’t really care that much about a silly assignment. It wasn’t like he would have gotten much more attention and praise for his work if he’d had worked alone.
“One last thing,” Draco said, “why wake everyone up from the curse in the first place? Surely, it would be much easier to leave everyone in an unconscious state, so no one can stop whatever evil plan you’ve concocted.”
“Sure, we’ll work with the both of you over what you should have learned this year,” Remus reassured him, “you’ll be working hard, but from what I’ve seen in these essays, you’ve got good minds, the both of you.”
“Hey, Sirius,” Harry greeted as he walked past him towards his room. In his hand was a plate of food.
“Yes, kind, Mistress Cissa, one that mistress loved,” he bowed a few times before he answered, “Master Regulus, the kind master let the nasty man, the unspeakable man, you know who, took Kreacher to the cave. When Kreacher came back, the kind master helped this miserable creature, and I took him there,” he said, as he began to tear up thinking of his late master, “he ordered me, he ordered me to take him there and leave him. I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it.” He wailed loudly.
“Mrs Weasley, Ginevra isn’t my friend, she’s just Ron's little sister. And that would be fine, but she keeps trying to stop me and Ron from having any type of fun,” Harry said as he took a step or two to beside his friend.
“It might be one of the Horcruxes, we know he made three for a fact, but he could have done a number more,” Sirius said softly.
Draco took them from him as soon as he sat down and started to read through them. Eyes wide, “you really submitted this?” he asked.
“The Locket,” Draco murmured, “he was reaching towards that. I can feel something really dark from it. I don't know what though,” he added, his voice levelling out now that he knew that his mother and cousin were there to help if Harry tried to go for it again. He could sense that the locket was bad news that it would cause harm to anyone that touched it.
"I'll tell him," Harry nodded, giving into Malfoy's request easily. He could see the sincerity in the silver-blue eyes.
With that Harry turned away from her, not wanting to look at her after she had just called him a liar. it was one thing he hated being called, as his so-called family called it him all the time. Knowing that he was in the right and Dudley and them were the liars. Ron gave him a nod, and the two of them turned to tune Hermione out as she tried to backtrack on what she had said. The two wondered who she was listening to, as Ron and Harry had talked about Dumbledore and how he regretted letting him live with his aunt and uncle.
I know a lot of you wanted Hermione to be dealt with IN the Tournament, sorry, it wasn't going to happen. But I do hope you enjoy what I did with her in this little chapter.
“Please,” he begged again, “please, I just need to tell him, Harry’s in trouble, he's really ill,” he said, changing what he was saying a little.
“I don't, so far you have insulted Sirius, told me what I should be doing, that I should leave my education up to chance. That I should forgive someone that has been telling me falsehoods for the last three years. You are also trying to force me to be friends with your daughter Ginevra. She is my best friend's little sister, and that is all she is,” he added, standing up, “I’m sorry Ron, but do you want to come with me back to Grimmauld? We should be able to get more work done there.” he suggested, not able to be around Molly for a bit, he was going to lose his temper with her if she continued to spit insults towards Sirius.
"Potter," Malfoy said, causing the three to stop what they were doing and look up at him. Harry paused before saying anything. The tone of voice was different than normal. there was no derision or disgust within it. It was just toneless, almost.
“Mrs Weasley, I suggest you leave my home,” Sirius’ voice was cold and dangerous, “Don’t even think about protesting. I am raising Harry to become the next Lord of House Black and Potter, and he needs to know a damn sight more than you think. It doesn’t matter what house they are in; they are allies. House Greengrass are allies of House Potter and are considered family friends. They are predominantly Slytherin, you forget that houses changed for each family. The Potters were once Slytherins until Harry’s great-great-grandfather, much like house Weasley,” he pointed out to her.
Sorry about not posting last week. I was on Holiday and even got the chance to visit Stonehenge last week. So back to normal this week
“Harry,” Hermione said as she walked over, looking a little stuck up as she sent a glare towards Draco.
“Sure,” he replied, taking them and settled down to read through them. It didn’t take the two of them long to be able to see what was going on.
Harry shook his head, "I saved you because you're Ron's baby sister. I wasn't going to let him down, he's my best friend. I knew he would be devastated if something happened to you. So I did it for him, not for you. I don't know you," he said, shaking his head, looking at Ron, "I know that sounds bad, but..."
"You have a patient in Weasley there, concentrate on him. Make sure that no one revives this one while I floo for the Headmaster to come through, we will need to get Madam Bones in as well," he told her as he levitated Pettigrew over to another bed and bound him to it, redoing the stunner that was on the rat.
“Thank you, for telling me. I take it Molly didn’t want to listen about it,” he sighed, glancing towards the kitchen window. He could see Molly watching him.
Sirius pales, “what is it? What's wrong?” he demanded to know. Only the calming hand of Narcissa on his arm stopped him from running off before or could finish.
"Thank you for bringing him back, Severus," Albus said as soon as the two of them appeared in his office. The old wizard had beaten the two of them back to the castle since he had taken his office floo instead of the public one back to the school. "I would like to speak with Harry for a moment, I'll let him go back to his dorm a little later."
Albus looked a little startled, but then shook it off as he looked at Harry, "Well, Harry," he said with a smile, "Sirius has been writing to me, about things that are happening now that he is free. And I fully endorse them," he added.
"You could have done as we had done, as we all did!" Sirius yelled, "We fought back, we stood up, we would have died for them, for you, for anyone if it meant that someone else would live!"
It didn't take long for said wizard to walk into the room. He gave a heavy sigh when he saw the redhead standing there, "I'm going to take you home now, Miss Weasley, Ron, Harry why don't you go off to Harry's room." He smiled at the two teens as he went towards the floo and activated it.
Sirius closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, “Fine,” he said, “I’ll stay for a bit longer, hope you don't mind,” he said, though the pleasant tone was forced. He looked back and saw the two boys. Gesturing to them, he walked outside Burrow into the garden.
“All right, it’s on your head, Harry,” Seamus nodded as he and Dean walked off together, Neville slowly following behind them.
“It… you need to talk to the bank, they’ll be able to sort it out,” Narcissa said, her own voice now shaking after learning what the object was.
“You know you can call me Ginny, Harry,” she said shyly as she played with the light cardigan that she was wearing over the dress.
“Not sure on Draco,” Harry nodded, “I get that, I was as well. I remember what he was like in school, and the person I’m getting to know now is totally different. There is no trace of him at all,” he told him.
Harry and Ron looked at him, “Hermione being her usual righteous self,” Harry was the one to answer him.
Thank you for all the awesome and amazing comments and kudos. You have no idea how happy it makes me to see them, and while I may not reply, know that they are all appreciate immensely.
"Severus," Remus said as he looked to the wizard, "You going to fight?" he asked him quietly, "Or are you going to help?"
Ron looked at her, feeling sorry for causing her to cry. He closed his eyes, he had to fight against the need to soothe her, “Hermione, I don't know if we can ever trust you with anything. You go behind our backs with things, without telling us anything. How can we come back from this?” he asked looking at Harry for some form of guidance.
“I’m going to see if Ron will be able to bring some of his over as well. And Arthur,” Remus said as he got up to floo the Weasleys.
“Yes, but for most of his life he had people that would rather see him dead,” he told him. “As for Draco being friends with him, he no longer has to follow what Lucius says. He’s free to be who he truly is and not the carbon copy of Lucius Malfoy. Narcissa and Draco don't have to toe that family line because I’ve taken over house Black. If I hadn’t, they would still be alone, fighting against Lucius to remain true to themselves.”
Right, my keyboard on my laptop is messing up big time, using an external is also causing a lot of problems for me. So I apologise now if I have more mistakes left behind than normal. I've been having this issue for a while, but it's really getting bad now.
“No, it isn’t,” Ron was the one to answer this time, as he removed her from Harry, “He’s… he’s not the same,” he murmured, looking as though it pained him to say that.
“Molly, I think you need to get her checked out. The type of dark magic that was used, it could cause problems that you wouldn’t see unless someone checked her over. A proper full healer and not just a mediwitch like Poppy, she wasn't trained for that type of magic,” he tried to push her a little.
“He… he might not know about them,” Ron said softly, “And I’ll… I’ll try but just give me some time. I’m..”
Harry knelt in front of the fire and made the call, “Hello Mrs Weasley, is Ron there? I’d like to talk to him please?” he asked politely.
“He’s helping a lot,” Harry added. He had the things Draco had taught him checked by Remus and Sirius occasionally, and so far the other teen hadn’t given him anything that would be false, only the truth and the right answers when Harry was getting things wrong.
"So, what was wrong? What was going on at the station?" Sirius asked, guiding Harry over to the sofa and sitting both of them down.
"Like you would believe something like that," Hermione snorted, "You were goading Harry about Sirius throughout the year!"
“I… I think we need a bit more time to think about it. It hasn’t been long since we found out what you have done. But it hurt Hermione. It hurts so much that you would betray the trust we had in you,” Harry said, a little softer as he looked to his… friend.
"They are still your family, Harry, you should at least respect them for taking you in," Hermione told him, her voice a little snappish when she spoke.
“Yeah, I’ll show you some of the things Ron and I came up with to get good grades in that lesson.” He said as he turned to his work again, “I just want to try and understand this first.”
Sirius turned to him, holding his hand he smiled, "Well, looks like I'll finally be able to be the Godfather I wanted to be with you," he said as he pulled the young wizard towards him, wrapping his arms around him.
Harry frowned, but got up and rushed up to his room. He searched around and quickly found the essay for the last year and brought them down. Handing them over he asked, “Is something wrong?”
“Why are you sorry? There's nothing wrong with me being friends with you. I’m fine to have friends outside of Ron,” he added.
Sirius walked into the room moments later, "Hey," he smiled as he held a small cage, "I wanted to say sorry for you losing your pet, I brought you something to replace it.”
“I don’t mind either,” Remus added, “You may spend a few months in the year below you to make sure you have an idea of the course. But they’ll give you a test in October to make sure you’re ready for the year above. This does happen often after all,” he reassured them as he saw their worried looks.
“Narcissa is going to be bringing Draco over as well, do you think you can keep the peace?” he asked, grimacing a little. He knew that if he had been Harry’s age and told him he had to behave with Snape, he would have not reacted well.
“Right, so I heard from Ron and Harry what happened to Ginny in her first year. The magic she was exposed to can have long-lasting effects on someone. And she was exposed for a long time. Harry was recently as well, and while he was fine, it still took a few hours for him to stop feeling like he needed to search out the object that tried to possess him,” he explained, giving a very basic explanation. There was no need to get into the details and scare the man even more.
"Thank you," Sirius murmured as the six of them slowly went through the passage. Leaving Remus behind as the moon slowly rose.
"He was too powerful, I had no choice!" he yelled out, falling into a prayer position on the floor of the shack.
"He's right here, right here, I can make things right!" Sirius said as he glanced towards the bed. Where two young wizards and one young witch huddled together.
Arthur shook his head, sighing, “No, he really wouldn’t. He is a great wizard, we all know that. But there are some things that he has never delved into, healing the damage caused by dark arts is one of the big things he has never picked up,” he added, understanding what Sirius meant.
Sirius nodded, “I heard Ron and Harry talking about it. I know dark magic and that… that is some of the worst out there. I just need to know if you took her to a healer, a true one at St Mungo’s to make sure she was okay after it all,” he said, almost blurting it out.
Two bright blue lights rush out of their wands and mold into two roaring lions running after the dementor who was now escaping down the hall. The lions swim over each other as they chase the dementor away from them.
Before his next class, he quickly grabs his bracelet from his dorm and rushes toward the classroom, only to realize he is pretty late. He kicks himself at his lack of time managment, but manages to run fast enough where he's only a couple of minutes late.
"Alright, Zabini, see you later! Good work today!" Hunter says, giving him a much unexpected hug. Blaise couldn't tell if he appreciated it or wanted to push this boy far away from him, so he did nothing except stand there until Hunter pulls away. "Good luck with love!" He runs out of the kitchen with the tray in hand and Blaise slowly follows him. He sees Hunter dip into his common room for a split second.
"Potter!" Draco shouts, throwing a wand Harry's way. He grabs it with one hand and throws a spell at Voldemort's snake, but Voldemort blocks it for him.
"Well, I better get to class." Neville says, walking away from Hannah briskly. He can hear her protests, but decides not to listen.
It shocks Neville to feel Blaise pulling him close and wrapping his arms around him. Without thinking, Neville leans into him and hides his face in his chest. It was strange, for sure, but he hasn't had a hug since he was seven years old. Especially not one like this.
"Oh... Uh... That's been ok. I switched out partners for Blaise. It isn't too bad now." Neville acknowledged.
"To Blaise, I worry that this will be the last time we talk. My grandmother says I can't see you anymore. It hurts so much. You've treated me so well and I care about you so much, but this could be goodbye. I'm sorry. I want to fix it but I can't. I don't want to let you go but I have no choice. Please, if I don't ever see or talk to you again, please move on. For me. I am begging you. Don't be alone forever because of me. I thank you for everything you've done and I'll miss you incredibly. I'm so so sorry. Goodbye - Neville."
He heard Harry shuffle across the room and glanced over to see his shirt just above his head. His back muscles seemed to become more defined as he stretched his arms above his head and laid the shirt beside him.
Harry sat on the staircase thinking about what Blaise said. Perhaps it was just a friend messing with a friend.
Draco takes a deep breath and opens the door. He attempts to appear like everything is fine, yet Harry narrows his eyes at him.
"Hi, Neville!" Someone's soft voice said behind him. He looked back to see Luna Lovegood smiling down at him.
"Draco needs to get the first piece!" Molly says, smacking George's hand away from whatever was on the table.
The scariest part of it was: Draco was no where to be seen. They went home that year due to Luna's father wanting her home.
Blaise walks through the halls, trying not to think of Neville. The only thing it would get him was the thought of Luna and Neville together, which only made him miserable.
Harry leaves the room feeling much better. Maybe now things won't be so weird between him and Ginny. Then again, he kinda fueled this fire. He fueled the fire with Draco, now look where he is. He can only hope this fire dies down as quickly as it started.
"Uh... by my feelings? Well... I don't wanna say. It's weird and you'll think I'm some creep." Neville says.
Blaise looks up at him and grins like an idiot. "I'm in love with Neville Longbottom!" He says louder. He seems to be in surprise. "I am! Ha!" He says, smiling even wider.
You may be wondering how same-sex couples in this book can create biological children. If not, you may be wondering now. So, the children can be created with magic. The process was developed in 2003 and couples Brian and Ned from America were the first to try it. It went successfully, so then more couples decided to do it as well. It isn't an mpreg situation at all, the children actually are born instantly, but are fully developed as if they very growing nine months inside of a mother. Many people are against it because they feel it's unnatural or that couple's do it without thinking, but many same-sex couples who want to have children this way have to go through classes to learn to how take care of a baby and see if they are willing to so that way no one makes any rash decisions. Harry's children were made this way as well as Blaise's child. Many same-sex couples, though, still choose to adopt or get a surrogate.
He should stop thinking about it! Blaise wouldn't give that gift let alone be that kind and understanding. Especially since he has noticed no one at all speaking about the things he wrote down, which means this guy actually is genuine. Even if it isn't Blaise, he really should stop thinking about the things that were filling his mind. He doesn't even like boys! He likes girls. He liked Hannah, right?
"Well... I live with my Aunt, my Uncle, and my cousin. They're all dreadful. My Aunt called me and my mother a freak for having magic and they would lock me in a cupboard under the stairs without food for weeks..."
"No you aren't. This has happened before. You like someone other than Ginny, don't you?" Hermione asks.
"Thank you for that. I really appreciate everything you do for me. I'll try my best to be better to myself. I'll talk to you later, yeah? Be safe, please. Eat good food and stay warm.
His happiest memory had now changed, but he was hoping he wouldn't ever have to use it for a dementor again.
"Blaise! No need to sit, unless you want to of course. I only need to talk with you briefly." Dumbledore says.
She was certain this would work. Only time would tell. If she was lucky, she'd see them together by the end of this week. Unless of course they'll be their classic stubborn selves.
Due to Neville's silence, Blaise's smile seemed to fade. "Well... I'm going to go then." He purses his lips together and puts his hands in his pockets. "Good luck." With that he walks away, leaving Neville to sigh in relief. He escaped the possibility of being a joke to someone once more.
Now he was supposed to fight Harry, win, and bring him to the Dark Lord?! No matter how angry he is at Harry, no matter how much he hates him, he just can't do that! He just can't.
Neville quickly grabs an ingredient and pours it into the potion. As he stirs, the steam gets bigger and bigger and the bubbles grow higher and higher.
Blaise sighs and walks out. He turns toward Draco in the doorway and waves goodbye. Draco nods back then finally relaxes as Blaise steps out of sight.
"Avada Kedavra." says Snape, no hesitation whatsoever. Draco almost gasps as he watches Dumbledore fall backwards, right off the side of the tower.
Neville can't help but feel suspicious. Why would a Slytherin want to help him? Why would anyone want to help him? If anything, they'd just want a good laugh and a reason to use those jinxes they learned.
Blaise grins, "Don't worry, Nev, I'll be the most bestest friend you can ever have!" He says dramatically. Neville snorts behind him, making his heart swell and his lips curl up into an even bigger smile.
He wouldn't have thought for a second that someone like Blaise could've fallen for someone like Neville.
"No!" Neville exclaims. He stares at the floor for a bit until his breath begins to grow louder and louder and faster and faster. Slow tears began streaming down his face.
Blaise follows him after and begins unloading the basket. Blaise pulls out various foods like blueberries, apples, treacle tarts, and a container of various cheeses.
"Of course." He lowers Trevor into Neville's hands. "There you are, Trev." Blaise smiles and pats Trevor on the head softly. He looks at Neville, making his palms sweat. "Hey, Neville, how are you?"
Blaise seemed just as shocked as him. "I'm sorry." He says back. However, he doesn't move from his spot.
He suddenly looks up to notice the once dead-end now has a grand door staring him down. Logic had told him to not open the door, yet something so powerful continued to pull him towards the handle.
Draco doesn't respond, but instead holds back the tears threatening to fall onto his cheeks. But, as usual, his efforts fail.
Neville drops the sword on the ground and drops his arms to his side. He softly laughs and stares up at the blue sky. He clenches his fist and holds it up high in the air.
"I feel a lot more calm. Wow." Draco says, holding his wrist to his nose and taking a deep breath in. "I still feel urges though."
The next day she strutted down the halls and stepped right up to Harry and his little group of Gryffindors.
"Yes, but it's not his doing! None of this is his doing. He's just a good person who needed a home. He fought them, you know." Luna says and her father rolls his eyes.
"All great ideas, but don't forget we need to make sure we don't forget his little fear." Xavier smirks.
Harry rushes to him and attempts to get the wands from him. He holds onto them tight, but then Harry touches his hand and he loses focus. Harry runs away with the wands in hand. He sits there in shock and fear. He really was weak.
Blaise comforts Draco in the meantime and he attempts to get his mind off things by talking about potions, their boyfriends, and even different foods. It seems to calm down Draco's shaking as well as his crying.
He makes his way into the Great Hall and notices Neville, Hannah, and a few other students are already there. Neville is smiling softly, to which Blaise smiles as well. Even if the smile isn't directed at him, he can't help but feel happy as well.
Finally, he knew what he needed. He struggled to reach into his pocket and grab the bracelet, but it falls onto the floor. He grunts in frustration and agony.
He picks one up and is thrilled that they are still warm. Not entirely, but still pretty warm. He smiles and hugs the blanket while he clutches the bracelet in his hand.
As he walked towards the Slytherin common room, he was called by Professor Trelawney. "Dumbledore needs to see you, dear." She says.
"Very well." He responds, pulling away from Draco and walking past him. "Severus will be here soon, I assume?"
"Personally, I don't think anyone spiked his drink," Blaise says, causing a confused look from Harry and a warning stare from Draco.
"Let me tell you a story. When I was fifteen, I dated a boy named Rufus. He went to Durmstrang. But, when my mum and dad found out, they shouted and lectured me for a good few hours because they thought all students at Durmstrang were dark wizards. They were wrong... He was the sweetest boy I had ever met. He would help out anyone and everyone that needed it without a second of hesitation. But, because my parents didn't believe that, I wasn't able to see him anymore. And I didn't... Not for a few months at least. Until I decided to do exactly what you have been doing. I snuck out to see him, but I got caught... You wanna know why I did that, though?"
"Good work!" says Lupin. The class continued on and only a couple of people managed to form a Patronus. Hermione Granger, however, didn't manage it and remained upset for the rest of the day.
He was back at Hogwarts, eating lunch with all the seventh years that came back along with Ginny and Luna. Blaise sat beside him and chatted with Ginny about Quidditch. Blaise cleaned his plate and laid it beside him. He nodded along with what Ginny was saying and leaned towards Neville with his arm out, laying it right across his shoulders. Neville blushed and continued to eat, even as his heart beat like mad and he could barely focus on anything let alone his food.
"Of course! It already is awkward. I tried to be his friend, then a bunch of Slytherins bullied him and he blames all of us. But, I can't say he was wrong in that. He is just protecting himself. Besides, we never would've worked out." Blaise finishes sadly.
Snape sighed once more, "Look if you and Harry remain partners..." He got closer to Draco and whispered, "Perhaps then Voldemort will give you a pass. Perhaps then you can help him get to Potter instead of having to kill Dumbledore yourself. Perhaps... Just maybe, you'll be more well-liked by him."
Draco stares at him in shock. He couldn't say he wanted to laugh, he was just in wonder. If anyone were to like, or in this case love, Neville Longbottom it would've been Luna Lovegood.
"Last night in the common room I couldn't help but overhear Draco droning on and on about you." Pansy says.
"Draco, finally." Father lifts up his sleeve and reveals his dark mark. He points his wand right at it. A sudden fear washes over him. He wasn't prepared for this.
Draco leans in to take a whiff. It was hypnotizing, he almost forgot to speak. "I... I smell wood, broom polish, grass, and... Something else. I can't quite get." He says.
"We'll always be here for you, especially me. Every single one of us will be here. I promise. You're my best mate and I'm not gonna let you deal with this alone, ya hear?" Blaise says.
"I... I am!" Neville says with a soft giggle. The broom dips down and he gasps. He tightens his grip on the broom and tips it up slowly and finds himself back in his spot and in control of the broom. "I did it!" He says, "Yeah!"
He stood still out of shock. Draco laid there crying, blood seeping out of his stomach. He hears heavy footsteps running towards him, but he can't move. Cold hands push him out of the way and lean down towards Draco. He quickly notices that it's Snape. He looks up at Harry with a look that Harry can't seem to put down before he picks up Draco in his arms and rushes out of the bathroom.
Dumbledore sighs, "I guess I must tell you a story. Sit here right here," He point to the seat in front of him and Blaise goes to sit in it. "Well, when I was your age there was this boy I knew. He was a student at Durmstrang, I was in Hogwarts. But we were very much alike. We became lovers very soon after meeting each other. I loved him, sometimes I still think of him... But terrible things happened between us. We fought each other, becoming enemies, and he showed his dark side. I was heartbroken." He stares at his desk with sad eyes, "But I can see that love in you. I notice how you look at him. The importance of that story is that there is nothing wrong with how you feel. It's completely normal. Love is a beautiful thing and you should be glad you can experience it."
He reaches into his pocket to put the bracelet on, and apparently in bad timing. Just as he reached to grab it, the door to the classroom creaks open again.
Great, now Harry is worried about Draco's well-being again. He blamed it on hero complex, which made his fears dissipate a little.
"Blaise," He whispered. Blaise looked over at him and this time, he could truly see the anger. "Uh, let's go to the common room! I need your help with my homework." Draco says, standing up and allowing Blaise to follow him out.
For a while, it felt to him as if he was laughing with his family. What he failed to realize was that this is his family after all and will be until the day he dies.
"O-oh... Ok." He looks over and sure enough, Luna sat there holding the newest edition of the Quibbler with her.
Neville's face burned and he felt that funny feeling again. The more he looked at Blaise, the more he glanced at his lips. Then the dreadful, but rather appealing, thoughts replayed in his head. He wanted to kiss Blaise, but why?
No one else moves, at least not for a few seconds. Until he watches Neville limp forward and Blaise rushes toward him, only to be pulled back by Luna. He shakes his head in disbelief. Not Neville, please no.
"I may be hypocritical, but I know when I have made mistakes. Don't do what I did. Talk to him!" Blaise urges.
Blaise closes the space between them. His lips were soft and delicate against his. He couldn't help but feel jealous. His lips were chapped and rough, yet Blaise still kissed him. He didn't think he'd ever understand that.
He then noticed, due to his inability to calm his nerves, that he had left his bracelet at home. How many more times would he do this? However, this type of nervousness was much nicer than what he usually felt.
"I'll help you up. Take my hand." Blaise says. Neville complies and grabs onto Blaise's hand and he pulls him up to his feet. "Come on, let's get you somewhere safe."
"Yes. I told him everything and he plans on talking with you when he gets here. Well, he said whenever you wake up, but you're awake now so..." Harry informs.
