“It might not be a problem,” Draco offers finally. “Even if the elves do tell Warrington. He might just assume we’ve had a falling out.”
Malfoy studied his ghostly fingers.
“Beer, Dudley?” Potter asks, opening the fridge. He seems vaguely uncomfortable.
“Just so,” agreed the ghost of Malfoy. “I feel I understand the Muggle concept of hell now. What else could explain your conspicuous presence in my afterlife?”
“It’s not lopsided. It
Blaise looks at him sharply. “Odd?”
Hermione looked a tad annoyed with him, but she went on without commenting. “A rise in the number of people infected over the weekend. St Mungo’s is getting alarmed—they haven’t many empty beds left.”
He looked over where Malfoy was sitting once again. His reasons were more of a mystery; it definitely wasn’t his turn again, and no one had luck
“Mm.” Blaise raises his eyebrows, lacing his fingers together across his stomach. He's still in his maroon silk dressing gown. “And?”
Draco turns and looks at Harry now. “I did,” he says. “Despite everything, I do.”
Malfoy smiled again. “No.”
“Potter,” he breathes. His voice is all gasp and groan. “Harry. I’m going to come. I’m going to—“
“The one with the man talking about his holidays as a child?”
Harry lifted his head off the pillow. “You are real.”
The morning after his night out with Pansy and Blaise, Draco lies in bed for a long time. The sun paints his wall from blue to gray, white to yellow-gold as the sun rises higher and higher into the morning sky, and still he lies there, in his soft white sheets, staring at the ceiling.
, Potter likes to joke.
“Oh, uh— were you?” He shifts awkwardly on his feet. “I suppose I didn’t think about how that might come as a shock. I’ve been wanting to do it for so long, so—“
“At fixing things,” Harry said. Malfoy blinked. Something in his eyes went sort of soft, and from that moment on Harry would never be able to think of him as anything other than human, and ever-changing, and breakable.
“There’s nothing right about
“We could transfigure that chair over there into a small bed,” Potter suggests. “Who would know?”
Regulus surprises Draco by sitting down in the chair on the other side of his table. Regulus has never taken a seat with or around Draco. He has always been friendly but deferential.
“Hermione! Malfoy said you were here.” He steps forward and catches her in a half-hug, one of his big, tattooed arms going round her shoulders. “You keeping that little brother of mine in line?”
“Don’t try to play with me, boy. I don’t know why you insist on thumbing your nose at all of our—“
“None,” says Lucius. “But speaking of heirs, Salazar has chosen one from among his most trusted vassals, and I’m very pleased to say he’s chosen you.”
“It’s—“ Harry sighs. “Complicated.”
Petunia brings her hand up to her cheek. “She almost died laughing, when she gave it to me. ‘A proper British tea cosy,’ she said. ‘Just as proper as you are.’ I was spitting mad. I thought she was having a laugh at me, mocking me.”
— to find someone who understands that as I do. My father has some trouble seeing the bigger picture.”
“Where do they live?”
“Can you really?”
“Yes,” says Draco. They are speaking so softly now, as if telling secrets. Something feels delicate, nascent about the moment. Harry makes the circuit with his fingers a few more times, watching the chess pieces tremble on Draco’s skin. He leans down and kisses Draco’s chest, right above the king.
“You must be very good at Apparition,” Draco says. “For a man to get from here to London and back again in time to tend the lighthouse is impressive.”
“Touch me more,” he whispers, as the metal clinks and the zipper slides open.
, somehow, like a pen and ink drawing that the artist has gone back to, taken the time to shade in.
Malfoy closed his eyes. Harry counted every breath he took. When Malfoy opened them again Harry swore he could see the very particular storm-grey of his real, tangible irises.
“What do you taste in the tea?”
“Hey,” Harry said. “I’ve got tea ready. Want to hear a ghost story?”
“I need a listing for this piece.”
Hermione leaned closer in the Floo. “It means they left their bodies where they were—in confinement—and just…went out,” she said excitedly. “In terms of what other people experience, there was a range reported from merely hearing the subjects’ voices to seeing them in their entirety.”
“He’s the best of them,” says Regulus.
. He knows that feeling—that sharp curl of instinct sitting low in the belly— so well he can still taste it now. Now, when his life has become the other reaction.
“I’ll have to remember them,” Potter’s voice is much closer and Draco startles, just a little. “We haven’t had much practice at that.”
“I understand,” Harry said. “And I’ll be right here.”
“It’s just that it’s a little more… basic than the brochure said it’d be,” Harry tries. The man just looks at him. “It’s rather rundown, is all I’m saying, and—“
Draco begins to feel sick after he emerges from the fireplace in his own flat. He goes into the kitchen and fills a glass with tap water, leaning over the sink and looking out the back window. The ghost, that damned ghost, is back in the garden. It’s wearing the same form as the last time, male and well-dressed and with pale hair. He can’t tell now, though, if it reminds him of Lucius or of himself. Bile rises in his the back of his throat. He lets the glass fall into the sink with a loud clatter and turns away.
The convenient thing about living above a bar is that he doesn’t have to go far for the next bottle of Firewhisky. In fact, since he opened a tab with the owner, all he has to do is tap his wand on the nightstand and a fresh one appears. That’s good, because after the first week Draco realized he was a little unsteady on his feet every time he tried to walk away from his permanent sprawl across the bed. Sometimes he twirls a heavy-bottomed shot glass across the scratched floorboards to see if he can get it to the opposite wall. He doesn’t bother with the glasses that get sent up with the whisky otherwise. He drinks it straight from the bottle, like any merciful god intended.
“My problem! My problem is that you didn’t even
“Is that right?”
“You could have asked your father’s portrait,” Snape pointed out. “I know he has one in the Manor. It would certainly have been easier for you to access then mine.”
Draco watches the dragon for awhile. He’s only half the size of an adult Welsh Red, which he imagines is what’s saving him now, making it possible for the Sanctuary people to treat his injury and keep him still long enough to heal. Draco hopes he gets to grow; he hopes the dragon has the chance to fly once more, over fields and mountains, along the coast of Wales like the Reds used to do two centuries ago.
Lucius doesn’t call him back as he leaves, shutting the door again behind him.
“I saw him walk in, but Millicent grabbed him and took him back toward the kitchens.” Potter looks confused. “They haven’t been back since.”
Then Macnair went for his wand, and Draco’s was already pulled, and it was almost simple to send that curse through the air. Hit Wizards were sent with a single purpose, after all, and Draco was very good at his job.
who I was anymore.” He glances at Regulus. “You gave me a chance when I was no one, and I would never betray that.”
Harry looks at him for a long moment, then he says, “I propose an agreement between our kingdoms that you and I will jointly maintain the forest and borderlands between us in friendship and for the common interest of both Slytherin and Gryffindor. Your land lies closest to the border, and Gryffindor doesn’t currently have a keep close enough to the forest to occupy. It will take some time to build one. We’d like to pay for our continued presence here in the meantime, if you accept this treaty.”
Potter smiles all crooked, his eyes crinkling in the corners and his teeth showing. His whole face smiles.
December 30th — Friday
Care is a magic shaped by relation; it alters and winds its way through all spaces. It is always on the move, always changing its shape, and sometimes— it turned into love. Harry felt, finally, like all his various perspectives on Draco Malfoy over the years had clicked into place, simultaneous and one. He felt certain he could love this man through every view, from any side of before or after.
Granger is happy to hear about the Warrington house party invitation. “Scotland,” she says. “You know, that’s where our informant said McLaggen was when he was supposed to be here in London for the rally. What’s Warrington like?”
“And what’s this for?” He holds up his mug, tea untouched.
There’s just enough moonlight spilling in through the window to make out the tall, old-fashioned posts of the bed around them, and Potter’s profile close by. Draco doesn’t normally sleep on his back but doesn’t want to move now. He stares at the ceiling, thinking he will never get to sleep, but he concentrates on the sound of the surf and, eventually, Potter’s rumbling, soft snores, and at some point he drifts off between them.
“It’s… complicated. I asked him for a favour two years ago, and told him I wouldn’t bother him again. Actually, I was hoping you might bid on it, and I could just pay you for it.”
“I don’t know what you mean, Potter. Why would I do Auror work?” It’s so easy to slip into his accustomed sarcasm.
“And they… understand?”
Draco pulls the money he’d changed over to Muggle pounds from his pocket, and sets it between them on the table. Petunia looks at it, the spell broken.
Dudley waves around another mouthful of pizza, and Potter stands to follow him out of the kitchen. He starts back toward the front door, but Potter stops him.
Malfoy's head tilts a little to the left, and he swirls the liquid around his glass. "You're the leader," he says, and then he meets Harry's eyes. "We could wait and see if Longbottom has anything new."
The light is tricky in his room at night; the candles make shadows bend and shift across Regulus’s face. But Draco thinks he sees a sheen of moisture around the older man’s eyes.
“Forgive me,” she says, all sugar and poison, “if I don’t weep over your lack of agency.”
Granger smiles grimly at him, and his McGonagall comparison has never been more accurate. “I’ll send over all your paperwork to keep you busy, Malfoy.”
Harry decides that was when it started, even though he knows that beginnings don't actually happen that way—not all at once, not in self-contained moments rising up like monuments to mark
“I know. I know this.”
“We need you to disappear for awhile,” continues Kingsley. “Take you off the game board. It will confuse them, and also alleviate one of our concerns.”
“You’re still about to lose this game, you imbecile,” Harry heard from the parlour, and then there was, again, only silence.
Harry’s smile is dazzling. “If we’re managing the border together, you’ll need to be here. Not the capital.”
Warm is dangerous.
A third finger slips in to join the others, and Draco curls and twists them, strokes in and out while Potter gasps out his non-words. Sweat is gathering on Draco’s forehead and his lungs are burning, his chest rising and falling unevenly.
Draco clears his throat. “Do you have a minute? I want to ask you about a listing.”
“Good luck,” she yells after him as he runs forward. People are leaning out of windows, coughing and crying and screaming for help. It is only much, much later, after everyone but the Aurors and other investigators have been removed, that he realizes he’s been repeating the same word to himself, over and over in his head.
They walk through the rest of the housing development, all of them so eerily similar that Draco finds it disorienting. “I can’t believe you grew up here,” he tells Potter.
“So have you, Potter,” Malfoy snapped. “What’s your point?”
Malfoy nods.
“Greg, you’ve got to lay off the Muggle junk food a bit,” Draco says, “or St. Mungo's is going to be forced to flush all those chemicals out of your system soon.”
The gin was weighing Harry down —making his limbs heavy and his brain slow and all his veins warm and pulsing through his body— and Malfoy looked so
“How are you?” she continues.
“I’ve wanted to retire for awhile now,” he pushes on. “Just because I don’t want to be an Auror anymore, or in the Ministry at all. It had nothing to do with you, or with us, or everyone knowing about us.”
“You don’t want to go at all,” Harry observes.
“I will,” he says.
"I know," he says. "I'll be here. Waiting."
“But it’s a good way to motivate pureblood support,” Potter says, looking thoughtful.
“She’s doing well. You know, I wasn’t sure how we’d get on, because of— well, you know. Old history. But I quite like her. She’s very funny once you understand her tone.”
It takes her a moment— she looks as startled and dazed as he feels— but she nods, and he lets go of her arm. “Put up your flare,” he reminds her, and she quickly sends up a bright ball of green that hovers above her, a beacon for those who need medical help.
“Like twenty dragons?” When Evers steps into the sunlight, the freckles on his nose stand out.
Draco is about to say something else— to thank Potter for what he’d done, however poorly— but Harry is smiling at him again, and it’s so soft and perfect that Draco holds in any inadequate words, lest he spoil it.
“Don’t be so… dense.” Further argument is stalled when Lucius appears at the doors to the library.
“Charlie!” Granger says from behind him, and Weasley breaks into a smile.
“Potter,” he said again, and his surprise was gone, too. He shook his head, slow, side to side. “Gin. A very good gin.” He slid his fresh shot over to Harry. And that was how they’d begun an evening of drinking together, and why they’d ended up stumbling out past midnight, out the back door and into the warm London springtime. It was quiet back in the alley. Muffled, like reality was when you had a particularly good dream. Malfoy’s body was loose and imprecise, and he stopped after a few steps to stand against the building. He looked at Harry, his brows pulled together over his eyes, like he was trying to figure something out.
“Well, no, I— I don’t think I mentioned it.” He feels suddenly like a lightbulb has been turned on for him. “Are you saying that— that Draco thinks I resigned because of the story?”
“There are trained rescuers to get people out of that building,” he yells over the chaos. Soft pops begin to come from around and behind them as other Aurors and Ministry rescue workers arrive. “You’re needed here, for the wounded. They’ll be bringing them to you.”
“Pardon?” asked the ghost of Draco Malfoy.
The door to Pansy’s apartment clicks open as soon as he says his name into the little intercom above the doorbell.
On the stoop, he pulls a small brass key from his pocket, and he unlocks the door.
“Yes. Really.”
Carys shrugs. “That’s Iwan’s dream, and good on him. I’ve got my own work, and I do it here at the cottage.”
Potter is standing in the doorway of the kitchen, bare chested, his flannel pajama pants hanging low on his hips. His hair is a mess, and there are dark pink patches along his collarbone and neck where Draco’s mouth had been last night.
And then nearly five weeks later, on a dead end stakeout he’d been called to back Potter up on, the tension broke like a storm cloud, in thunder and hot breath in each other’s ears. He would never forget, no matter how many times they’d fucked each other since, the look on Potter’s face when he dropped to his knees and took the tip of Potter’s cock between his lips; the way Potter’s bottom lip had fallen, like the pleasure was dragging it down, and how his eyelids had fluttered shut as Draco tasted the salty slit with his tongue, and then open again as he pushed his lips further up the shaft and sucked. The seconds went all slow and heavy between them. A strange, sympathetic magic.
“You’re a target now,” Regulus insists. “You’re in more danger than you’ve ever been, and it will only grow as word spreads throughout the kingdom.”
"Come back again sooner, mate," Ron says. "I miss you."
Draco rolls his eyes, and pours himself a healthy glass.
Malfoy shivers, almost imperceptibly, but Harry notices. He always notices. He is fine-tuned to Malfoy.
The older Aurors had accepted Malfoy now. They respected his work. Some of them, Harry thought while reading the files and watching them around the office, even liked Malfoy.
At the gate he flashes his badge and the fake one they’d made up for Dudley Sayre. It was good to be Harry Potter, apparently, even when you actively were being Not-Harry Potter. Draco spots Weasley as they near the pens.
“Look here, you tosser,” he began, but then his lips were so close to Malfoy’s, and their hips were nudging together. Malfoy was already getting hard, pressing through his trousers against Harry’s cock, which was rapidly following suit.
“And is Zabini doing a brisk trade, then?”
“But?” Draco senses Weasley has another reservation.
"Love to," she says. "I'll send Ron a message and he can meet us there."
Ginny shrugs and waves a hand in front of her face. “I thought I’d be dodging howlers for not being good enough for Harry Potter, but what are they going to accuse me of? Not having a cock?”
It’s Potter.
The witch touches her wand to the red dot, and the address and vectors pull off like a ribbon or bit of web now stuck to its end. She hurries over to a large basin in a corner, waving open the little locked gate that usually protects it, and drops the destination inside. A yank at the lever on the wall sends a cascade of emergency Portkeys, small rings with holes in their middles, in a line down into the basin as well.
The house he’d lived in with Ginny, where they’d had babies and the babies had grown and left home from, is quiet and sunny in the early morning. Ginny’s got her pajamas on still, and she puts a pot of coffee on the table, along with some toast and jam. He’s too nervous to eat anything.
“Er, well, just the tea cosies, really. I do have a discman, too. Blaise just gave me one. I like some Muggle music.”
Millicent snorts, and stabs at her fish. She’s never cared much for fine manners; Draco used to think less of her for it, but these days he appreciates the transparency.
There was a dust-filled hallway, and a door framed in old, rough-hewn wood. And when he’d put his hand up, his palm had barely touched the surface when the lock clicked and it popped open to him as if it had been waiting for this all along.
“It’s a limited edition of…” Goyle pauses, flicking through the binder set up on the desk. “One. There’s only one got made.”
Potter’s put the kettle on. Draco likes to mock him for it, usually—
“Fear,” Kingsley muses, “is a powerful motivator. It makes people react in ways they wouldn’t normally, as all of you here well know.”
. Two hundred pain receptors per square inch in the human body and it was nothing but background noise in the explosion, the revelation, that was Harry Potter’s body against his.
He nods and stands. “I’ll let you know what I find out tomorrow.”
“I live here,” Harry said, each word enunciated with deliberateness.
You’d think, after defeating Voldemort, that Harry’s luck would change. He’d certainly thought so himself— that it was all an upward trajectory from certain death. And yet, here he was, pulling the night shift on Christmas Eve with Draco fucking Malfoy, with his ridiculous hair slicked back away from his pointy ferret face and his stupidly expensive black boots propped up on his desk. Harry been stunned, when he heard that Malfoy had applied to the Auror training program a couple years after the war. And yet somehow Malfoy made it, and here he was, the newest Auror in the department.
He remembers now, the way Lucius had smiled up at him when he managed to hover a good eight feet up in the air. He remembers his own wild excitement, the joy splitting his cheeks around his grin. And Lucius, seen from above, his eyes wrinkling in the corners where he was smiling, too.
It’s almost completely dark when the ghost comes. It starts with a pulse of pale light in the corner, by the bare, craggy rose bush. As he watches, it seems to shake itself into existence, a pulse and a sputter and now a human shape. It floats around the broken pieces of lawn furniture and discarded garden tools, seemingly without purpose or direction. Finally, it seems to notice Draco, and it comes a little closer, facing him.
“Draco.”
Malfoy just raised his eyebrows.
Millicent’s brow wrinkles. “I’m not really sure. Just grunt work, running errands, that kind of thing. Cassius does a lot of organizing, you know? Politics. I don’t have the head for any of that— I’m well happy with my beasts.”
Harry covers his face with an arm for a moment. He laughs. And then he eats a damn croissant.
“Oh,” says the man, looking up. He seems familiar, but Draco can’t quite place him. “Malfoy. I’ve got orders you’re to go straight through.” He waves over his shoulder at the little hall behind him, and turns again to the witch beside Draco. “I’ve told you already, Midgen, no one’s getting in to the Minister without an appointment. Not today, not tomorrow, not the day after that, so don’t start with—“
, thought Harry.
“Yes,” Hermione interrupted. “I see your point. But no, I haven’t heard anything. Why do you ask, Harry?”
Malfoy is more circumspect. He doesn't tell Harry and Luna what he does when they are apart, and they don't push him. There are his parents, Ministry-bound to their Manor, but Malfoy doesn't seem to have anyone beyond them.
For a moment, Draco can’t speak. He hadn’t considered whether he and Potter actually trusted each other, but right now, he realizes he does. He trusts Potter. It’s more of a surprise that Potter finds Draco worthy of the same.
Harry wondered, suddenly, what it might be like for Malfoy. To come to work every day knowing everyone there sort of hated you, and worse: didn’t trust you. Not that Malfoy deserved anyone’s trust. Not yet. That was something he had to earn, but Harry did feel an unaccustomed stab of empathy for what must look like a long, steep climb. He wondered if Malfoy would stick it out. He wondered if Malfoy had really changed, deep down where it counted.
"Oh," says Hermione. "Well, I do have a lot of work to do—"
The place where Draco’s hair curled against the back of his neck. The dip just above his mouth. His shoulder. The hard plane of his chest. Lower, where his belly would be soft and ticklish. His wrists and his long fingers. The backs of his knees. Draco’s lips with his lips. His arse. His sides, to pull him closer. Eyelids, the bridge of his nose, the sharp line of his jaw.
Hermione is beaming at him from across the room. Kingsley gathers up the papers in front of him and taps the pile against the table to straighten them.
Potter turns away, toward the window that looks out over the street in front of the house. He fiddles with the blind, opening and closing the slats. “So you can let yourself in. Any time.”
Potter looks excited as soon as their boots hit the sand. “I’ve been wanting to come see Draig Sanctuary since it opened,” he says, following Draco up the sand dune toward the little path leading to the compound. “Never found the time. Charlie has all good things to say.”
“It’s the perfect piece to complete my collection.”
Potter was a boy he knew a long time ago, a boy he envied and hated and could never ignore. Potter was a teenager he resented and admired, grudging in equal measure. Now Potter is a man Draco doesn’t know at all— an Auror and a hero and something else behind that. And what connects this Potter and the ones he’d known at school is Draco’s continued, unwilling fascination; not with the hero or the boy who lived, but with the something behind them.
Harry had shrugged. “I don’t know,” he’d said, because it was partly true, and because he couldn’t explain the other true parts. Ron didn’t understand, although he tried to. Harry couldn’t tell him about Ginny’s face when she didn’t think anyone was looking, those last few years. How it looked so much older, somehow, while looking impossibly young and yearning for something he didn’t understand and couldn’t provide. How he felt it, too.
“Yes,” said Hermione. “I know.” And Harry didn’t hear suspicion or disapproval in her voice at all—he just heard warmth. And love.
“Perhaps I should buy stock in Zabini Imports,” Draco muses. “It’s clearly a miracle company.”
Some nights Luna puts an old record on and dances around whatever room they're staying in at the time—sometimes it's an elaborate suite and sometimes it's a single, shitty room with two double beds and a fold-out sofa. She grabs Harry by the elbow to join her and he does, but he can never coordinate his movements to hers, which are always in sync with some beat he can't quite hear, some instinct he does not possess.
He looks away, back at the stairs down to the platform, where the announcement had just come over the speaker, signaling a train is about to pull in. He looks back; Potter is still there. The rain has made streaks on the lenses of his spectacles.
Like never being alone again.
“It’ll only take a moment,” he finally murmured. “He’ll grab the basket and go.”
“You’re alive in Azkaban.”
Charlie sighs. “The wings are actually looking pretty good. They’re healing. If we can keep him from using them until the potions do their job, we can save them and he’ll fly again.”
Potter presses the small, brass key into his palm one Saturday morning as Draco is leaving his flat. Draco always makes sure to leave early when he stays over on a Friday night. Weekends together mean something else. They mean something other than fucking.
“I truly am sorry,” he says more warmly. “I’ll try harder not to let work take over every part of my life. I hope you’re happy with… Warrington, right?”
The tips of Malfoy’s fingers dug into his scalp. “Here you are, Potter,” Malfoy whispered down to him. “You’re right here.”
“Sure, Rowle,” says Potter, and he sounds almost bored. He’s got his wand in hand, but his grip is loose, and he’s flicking the end lazily against the side of his leg. Which is a classic, overconfident
Blaise loves them, though. He points to one of them, where two young girls are looking over the edge of some sort of long cart on a track like the one at Gringott’s, except the track rises into steep inclines and curls in the air before returning back to the same spot. Their mouths are open, stretched into shrieking smiles, their hair flying away from their heads on a perpetually sunlit afternoon.
“How’s it looking?” asks Draco. He can’t take his eyes off the young dragon, his glittering scales in the sunlight, the lithe way his body moves even under the pain of a terrible injury.
“Are you going to tell me what you were saying to me in your head, before you projected your consciousness over here?”
“No,” says Draco.
Harry watched as Rose sat herself down into her mother’s lap, still studying the paper dragon. Hermione looked surprised, but pleased.
“What the
“I’ll find out myself, anyway,” he tells her. “I’m going home tomorrow, and when I see Pansy I’ll give her the full grilling.”
"I think they all deserve the Dementors' Kiss, Mr. Potter." Finnagle isn't smiling anymore. "Make no mistake about that. But I must justify, to the public which we represent, the continued cost and the secrecy of the program dedicated to hunting them down in foreign lands, when results—captures, Mr. Potter—are fewer now, and far between."
“Was that public knowledge?” asks Kingsley.
“How involved in the plans is McLaggen? Does he—“
Harry pretended to think about it. “I like mint ice cream.”
Harry snorts, and pulls them over to the low patio wall. They sit on the smooth stones and watch the other guests laughing and talking.
“No,” Draco says. “No, this is a perfect metaphor for every trouble we have right now. I tell you we need to spend some time alone to reconnect, and you bring me to a hovel.”
Harry’s eyes widen, but he doesn’t reply. Draco feels foolish suddenly, and cold all over. He leaves Harry to trail behind him as he goes back inside his castle.
“What?” Draco looks back at him, the powder just escaping his frozen fingers before he can stop it.
“Of course,” Draco says. “Enjoy your evening, Mother.”
Granger speaks up again. “It’s not just for your protection, Harry. You want to work on this, and we want you to work on it, too. But you can’t work on it as Harry Potter. Not effectively.”
“Perhaps you aren’t getting enough exercise. It’s difficult when we can’t
“Merlin. It’s Pansy,” Draco says.
“A highly flammable, mostly
hovers on his tongue, but he holds it back. It doesn’t feel right somehow. “Well. There’s not much by way of groceries, I’m afraid, but help yourself to whatever’s around.”
“I didn’t say it bothered me,” Potter hisses. “Don’t put words in my mouth.”
“Should go back to sleep,” Potter mumbles into his shoulder. His breath is very warm, even through the cotton of the t-shirt he borrowed. “S’not time to be up yet.”
“When will he summon you?” Harry asks as they lie naked in bed together. It’s near midnight and the candle is almost burned down to nothing.
Potter’s sheets are a strange rust color, as if an orange had been set on fire and the fire had been put out with dirt. They’re rough, too, cheap and fraying like Potter can’t afford to replace them, which is stupid. Potter could buy a closet full of silk sheets and not be skint. It’s just one of his weird quirks, more annoying than it logically should be.
Sometimes he looks at himself in the mirror, naked, after a shower or when he’s just taken off his black wool uniform. He looks at the faded pink lines across his chest and torso, so faint and thin and almost invisible, like spider webs. Potter will trace them with the pads of his fingers, some nights. His lips following gently, his face hidden in Draco’s skin like he can’t stand the guilt of having put them there.
The bees dance around him, and he wants to let go, as they do. To ride the sweet current, to be directed, to be taken and given in the same breath.
“I suppose that means I’m on house arrest, too,” Draco drawls.
When they land back in the Ministry’s Portkey entry room, Draco follows Granger back through the Atrium, into the lift, and back up to Level Two. He doesn’t turn toward the big oak doors leading to the Auror Department, but turns the opposite way. At the end of the corridor is the Wizengamot Administration Services; Granger’s office is midway, and she holds the door open until he walks through, then shuts it firmly behind her.
“But why Harry? He’s only been here a few months. Why him specifically?”
“And then George said, ‘What do you mean the Elephant Trunk Charm hasn’t worn off? I can see your nose right now and it looks like the same nose you’ve always had, Macmillan. Blame your mum and dad for that.’ And then Ernie’s face turned so red I was worried he was having some sort of fit, and all of a sudden he just dropped his trousers. Right in the middle of the store! And bugger me if his knob wasn’t—“
Blaise shakes his head, but his lips twitch up anyway. “You’ve got it bad, Potter. I worry about you and those bees, I don’t mind telling you. And we
“That’s a rather nebulous motive— we’re looking for someone who’s anti-Wales?”
, physical Malfoy—aware of what his projection is saying and doing?”
“If you don’t want the answer he would give, why do you want mine?” Snape pressed.
It surprised him, but he found himself hoping they would all get there. He found himself thinking of that as the true victory over Voldemort.
Harry thinks about the tremor that sometimes sets up home in his wand arm. He thinks about other people's memories that sometimes come back to him in his dreams—a grievously injured and gleefully injurious boy; a red-headed girl laughing, growing bluebells in the palm of her hand; Snape, shattered and kneeling on uneven floorboards, his voice cracked and awful and the same name on his lips again and again, an unanswered prayer,
Harry scowled at the clock again; only twelve minutes had passed since the last time he glanced at it, which felt impossible. Time seemed to be stalling, stretching out improbably like taffy being pulled on those machines they put in the storefronts of beach towns. And yet each hour that passed was another he was
“Invigorating,” Man-Bun says. “A shock to your senses, waking you up to the potential of a new day.”
“Er, horses?” asks Potter.
He glances over, and Potter is staring back at him now. He lets out a loud burst of air, and then he’s laughing, helplessly. Potter’s whole body is shaking with it. The lighting is dim, but Draco can still make out Potter’s face, and how it breaks wide open when he laughs. He can’t look away. He can’t stop his mouth from stretching, too, into a grin to match. The air is still warm from this day that has already slipped away, and the traffic somewhere distant reminds Draco a little of the ocean heard from far off. The sweet, slightly acrid scent of tobacco lingers in the air, and Draco can scarcely believe he’s here, right now, in this slightly unreal pocket of time, laughing on a crummy back stoop with Potter.
A tear finally slips down her cheek, and she bends her head down toward the table. “You’re sure it’s Tom?”
“My place?”
“God,” said Harry. “Yes.” Malfoy moved against him, rubbing, hitting spots Harry hadn’t even thought about before this thing started. His own cock was being ground into the soft flannel of his sheets. He wished Malfoy would wrap his fingers around him. He wished Malfoy would never stop. “Good,” he murmured. “So good.” This was a fever dream, all heat and heaviness and unreality.
“What’s that phrase—
, he thinks. This moment with Potter, this possibility, it’s worth the chance of pain.
“Money,” says Dudley. “Since my dad died a couple years ago, things have been tight. Turns out there wasn’t as much in the bank as she’d thought.” He looks sober suddenly. “It was a heart attack, came out of nowhere, and then with all the money trouble she’s been in a right state for awhile now. Totally different. Now she’s about to lose the house. I think she’d be better off in a different one, anyway, but I think it’s the last thing that makes her feel like herself anymore.”
“Who the fuck are you to tell me I have a problem, Potter?”
“I’m going to bed,” he says. “I don’t feel well.”
“Well,” Draco grabs a bit of Floo powder from the small pot on the mantle. “Do let me know, Potter, about the item.” The flames flare up, and Draco steps in. “Malfoy Manor.”
Harry shivered—he could hear the longing in Draco’s voice, and it mirrored his own, echoes feeding off each other. He couldn’t remember deciding to move, and yet there he was, standing right in front of the incorporeal body of Draco Malfoy, which seemed even now to flicker with a tamped-down desire that Harry could almost taste.
Mirror Harry opens his eyes, and shifts a little to the side, and the real Harry watches as Malfoy wraps his other hand around his cock. He feels it like an electrical shock. Not that it’s Malfoy he’s having sex with, but the look in his own eyes. Like he’s lighter, freer. Like he’s exactly where he wants to be.
Usually, Malfoy would pull back toward the end, finish things off with hands or mouths. But he stayed, flush up against Harry, his mouth on his, chests heaving against each other. Harry wrapped an arm around Malfoy’s back. His shoulders moved under his skin, the miraculous machinery of their bodies. When Malfoy lost himself in pleasure, all the careful calibration of the face he showed the world dissolved, and Harry remembered the young man weeping in a bathroom, and terrified, clutching onto to him as their broomstick darted through a wall of fire. He remembered the little snot filled up with the teachings of his father. And all these facets of the same man just made Harry feel full, right in the middle of his chest.
“MLE.”
“Those are flats,” whispers the Mediwitch beside him. He’d forgotten she was there, and he pulls himself together now. “I have a friend who lives in that building. Oh, the people still inside!” She starts toward the bigger building, but he grabs ahold of her arm and turns her to face him.
Harry blinked. “I suppose it is.”
“It was hard,” Harry began, and let that feeling inside him lead, “when I no longer felt like I could call The Burrow mine. I guess holidays make you think about that more than usual.”
“I think that’s all I’ll ever be, sometimes,” he says. “That I peaked at seventeen, on one very long night.”
“It’s more a toolbox, really,” Harry says, easy and light. He almost puts his hand out to touch Malfoy’s shoulder, but all the nights they spent touching in the past make that more complicated, more loaded with suggestion, than he knows how to safely navigate with this Draco Malfoy. This man the years have touched, just like they’ve touched him.
Potter snorts. “Is that all Zabini is doing these days? I haven’t seen him in years and years, and Hermione and Ron say they haven’t, either.”
“Does he still have the wife?”
Harry thought about being eleven years old and stepping into Diagon Alley for the first time. The cobblestone streets stuffed with crooked shops and the witches and wizards who had seemed so odd at first, so fantastical. His community, finally.
The ghost spins and spins, a dizzy, lurching dance, and he shuts the window. He grabs a new bottle of Firewhisky, and cracks open the seal. Three fingers, four. He stops counting, just fills the glass up to its top and takes it back with him to the bedroom.
“Touch,” he whispers.
“Watch yourself,” one warns them, voice low and slow. Granger leans forward first, and her knuckles tighten around the frame of the little window at what she sees.
“I very much doubt that, Potter. I feel sure your friends and family would disagree, too,” he says after a moment. He stares down at the toes of his own boots. “Anyway, you didn’t exactly do the whole death thing right, did you? Here you sit, very much alive.”
“It is a conundrum,” Malfoy agreed. “But on the whole, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, it is nicer here than in Azkaban. So I think I’ll stay awhile.”
The Auror squints down at the paperwork in his hand, then at the printed badge Potter extends to him. “You’re the British DMLE representative, then.”
“But that merits the Deputy Head and an investigating Auror? I’m not complaining, mind you—“
“I thought the house elves didn’t serve alcohol until dinnertime,” he says when he reaches her.
that might be relevant, or you see anything new that’s suspicious, Floo us at the Ministry.”
“Whatever for?” Draco is grumpy; he pushes a pile of scrolls to the floor and spreads a map out across his desk. A maid is trying to serve him the dinner he didn’t show up to eat earlier, but he waves her away in irritation.
“I’m sorry,” he says.
“But why?” Hermione looks baffled, and worse, upset.
A swift rage washed through him. “So we’ve been shut in, isolated and going mad, for nothing.”
“Maybe,” Weasley says. “Maybe not. Maybe you’ll luck out and he’ll give you another chance. He’s like that, and he’s always seen you clearer than you think. Besides, there’s other people who seem to like you, for some reason.”
“Am I supposed to think you care, Potter?” Malfoy’s voice was kind of thin and wheezy, and now that Harry could see his eyes he noticed they were glassy and bright. Malfoy really was ill.
“It’s good to finally meet you, Draco,” Warrington says at breakfast. “Pansy rarely has anything nice to say about anyone, so I’m anxious to know one of the few exceptions.”
“It’s skin colour,” Blaise told him as he walked Draco out that night, trailing the adults and looking at the portraits. Blaise had always sounded idle and unaffected, even when they were boys. “In many parts of the Muggle world, my family would have been sold in chains until rather recently.”
“I’ve never had anyone stay over,” he said.
“It’s disgusting, you know,” Granger tells them. “The flirting you do over corpses. I’m going back to the Ministry to tell Kingsley we got Rookwood, before you actually start snogging.” She starts walking over to the Apparition point, then turns back. “Snogging at a crime scene is not allowed, by the way.”
Potter’s breath is on the back of his neck, and Draco closes his eyes. He bites his lip, hard, holds it between his teeth so no sound can escape him. Potter is moving against him now, a steady press and retreat, a rhythm that sets Draco on fire with no way to put the flames out. It’s excruciating and it’s divine and Draco
“Make sure our friend understands he’s not to come here again,” Warrington is saying to someone as he enters the room. Draco can hear the door snick shut behind them. “And then I’ve got another task for you. Millicent is occupied?”
Malfoy’s face turns very careful again, and he looks at Harry, hard, for a very long moment. “You do remember, Potter, how our ‘catching up’ sessions usually ended?”
“Not yet,” Harry says, tracing along Draco’s thumb and then down into his palm, a slow, promising drag of skin on skin, before he tangles their fingers together. “But they’ll get there, I think.”
Draco carefully slides out from under the arm and walks silently to the bathroom. The stone is cold beneath his feet and when he opens the small, circular window above the bathtub the wind off the sea is cold, too. Draco stands in the coldness for several minutes.
When he finds the right room, all bright and light and surrounded by windows on three sides, Draco has his back to the door. Harry pauses, and looks at him. So careful, so easily harmed. He clears his throat, and Draco turns.
December 29th — Thursday
Draco tries to pay attention to the news of the court as his father relates it, but his eyes are drawn repeatedly to the elaborate—and alarmingly high—coil of braids and fabric perched atop Pansy’s head. The headpiece is black velvet, with pearls sewn in. It matches her black velvet dress and the strands of pearls curling around her thin, pale neck like an extraordinarily expensive rope with which to hang herself.
“Yeah,” says Weasley. “Iwan’s alright. Really excited about having Welsh Reds here again. He came into a bit of money, after the war. Reparations. His family was all killed in a raid right before the Battle of Hogwarts.” Charlie glances at him, a tight, careful kind of smile, like he’s sorry he mentioned it.
“I’m engaged, actually.” His smile faded. “One of those contracted arrangements. Astoria Greengrass.”
Harry studied the ghost of Draco Malfoy for a moment. He looked much like Harry last remembered Malfoy—thinner and sharper than when he’d been at Hogwarts, with shadows curled up underneath his eyes. He was wearing a plain dark suit and his hair was slightly longer than Harry remembered, almost brushing the tops of his shoulders.
It was the first gentle touch they’d ever allowed themselves.
Draco nods at him in thanks and takes a deep drag of tobacco. “Came with Granger,” he says.
“About tea cosies?”
“You can’t drink this, so I’m not offering,” Harry told him.
Tonight, though, he’s seriously reconsidering that notion.
“I’ll be fine,” Harry said, cutting her off. “What’s the latest?”
Draco flinches slightly, and they finish the meal in silence.
to be the person you were picked to be?
Potter pulls out his wand. “Finite,” he says, and the charms all vanish at once.
“No, neither have I. It’s very sporting of him to let Pansy boss him into this one.”
“What?” He tears his eyes away from Potter—
“Minister’s direct request, Malfoy. Your other duties can wait.”
“Do you actually like peas?” he asked, wrinkling his nose a little.
Now Harry was smiling, too. “But you must have had so very much to say.”
Harry spoke slowly, pulling the words up, meaning them only as he heard himself voice them. “It’s a small one. Sometimes I think the small tragedies are more dangerous, because they lead to the bigger ones. Malfoy. Draco. What conversation were you having with me?”
"Worth a shot," Harry says. "We keep trailing one step behind him, losing him in a crowd. I can't figure out a pattern to his movements."
“Regretting it already?” he said, finally. He didn’t turn his head toward him.
Draco listens to his breaths, heavy and even, and matches his own to Potter’s rhythm until he drifts off again.
“Kitchen witchery, I heard someone say?”
“It’s been almost four years since the war ended. Is that all I will ever be to any of you?”
The brochure had said—
There’s no room for any other fantasies, not inside this crowding, humming hunger. He wants Malfoy. He wants Malfoy all over, inside him, everywhere. He wants Malfoy to
“I’d better get these guys over to their new boxes before they get mad at me and swarm.” He stands up, and so does Ginny. She takes his empty mug from him.
“Sure,” says Charlie, stepping forward and extending a hand to Potter. “Nice to meet you.”
“Of a sort, I guess.”
Malfoy snorted. “Big words, Potty. Did you pull out a dictionary and write that down beforehand?”
“It’s better for everyone, anyway. They want my protection. An organizing hand. They don’t want my friendship.”
Draco takes a deep breath, and looks at her—
Harry was silent. Hermione waited, watching him closely.
Harry wants to tell Malfoy that he isn't afraid—not because there is anything wrong with fear, but because he would like Malfoy to understand. Harry would like to explain that it's the absence of fear that makes his limbs quake sometimes. That there is an empty space inside him, because Harry has known the forest and when he left it something stayed behind, and now there is a hole Harry suspects he might fall through, and gladly, if he isn't very careful.
“Muriel is dead,” he’d said, into the very particular hush that fell inside. He’d waited, and so had the silence. What would happen to the hives, he wondered. Would someone else take the bees? Would they survive on their own?
“Last spring,” she says. “We did invite you.”
Harry smiles at him, his face gone strangely soft. “People must talk.”
“Sure. Looking forward to living in this lap of luxury for awhile.”
Draco runs a hand over his face, still watching the men in the yard. The hawk dives into the high grass just beyond the castle walls and comes back up with something small and struggling in its beak.
Draco wonders what Weasley now owes her the extra minutes of, but Potter screws up his face and says, “Ergh! You’re not allowed to be gross in front of me, you know that.”
,” she gestures at the paper lying on the table between them, the black and white picture flashing as his image pulls Draco’s face down to his, over and over, “we can say ‘cock’ between us like adults.”
Draco stops. “Don’t call me that,” he snaps.
“So,” she says when she’s sat down and poured them each a cup. “You want to buy my tea cosy.”
“Oh.” She relaxes, giving a cursory glance to his badge. “Alright then. What do you want to know?”
“This is a Muggle neighborhood!” Harry said, speaking over him. “Why the hell are you wandering around here? What are you up to?”
It’s funny— Draco never thought he’d ever feel as though he understood a Muggle so well, particularly Potter’s rather horrid, wizard-hating aunt. But there is something about her grief and her regret that strikes him like a bell, the ring reverberating all throughout him. He recognises things in her— his father, or maybe just himself as he could have been if he’d waited too long to let the world change him, to break free of all the bitterness and cast his own shadow, his own way.
He looks around, and realizes it’s growing dark; the sun is slinking down behind London’s enclosing skyline. “So have you,” he reminds her. “And there’s something not right about this—“
“My mother always said a person’s face might freeze like that. You’re only one sly charm away from a perpetual grimace,” Malfoy said. He looked up from where he was picking at his fingernails. “Course, I don’t know that there’d be much difference, in your case.”
“I did hope so,” Harry says. “I want it to be, anyway. But what about you? Have you thought about it again, lately? That summer?”
Listening to the wireless.
“Er…ok, then Malfoy’s ghost is haunting Grimmauld Place?”
He wants to say: "You're the first thing stronger than the forest."
“We’ve got all night,” he told him. “It’s a long shift, and Christmas isn’t over.”
“No.” Harry waited, but that’s all Malfoy said. He wasn’t looking at Harry; he began to organize the file between them, clipping together photographs and notes. Harry let the silence stretch. He scrawled his signature across the bottom of the paper and let his eyes drift over the words he’d written.
, every bit of it. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you who I was. I just—when we were together like that, I should have told you, but I wanted you to want
“Tell me you’re getting the same creepy vibe from Warrington,” Potter murmurs as they leave the dining hall. Pansy had stayed behind to greet all the other guests with her fiancé, but they were expected to show up on the lawn for a pick-up game of Quidditch in the afternoon.
Malfoy disappeared into the bathroom, and called out, “I can touch every wall in here just by putting my arm out. Potter, you live in a literal cupboard.”
“Morning, Malfoy,” says Charlie. “Nothing new.” He gestures to the door in the barn near them.  “We’re letting the injured dragon out for the first time in just a moment. Get him a bit of sunlight and fresh air, poor beast.”
“This is good,” Draco says, before he’s even finished chewing. “
Draco’s heavy breaths were starting to slow. “It only took us six Christmases,” he said, and his voice was all rough and dark and unpracticed, and Harry closed his eyes on the unexpected jolt of love and want and hunger that surged through his body. He turned his head just a little until he could press his mouth against Malfoy’s cheek.
It was raining that afternoon. He’d ducked into the tea shop because it looked so inviting, lit up with soft lamps on the tables and a chalkboard advertising the house-blended earl grey, and because he’d forgotten his umbrella and didn’t want to risk doing magic in Muggle London. He began to suspect it wasn’t strictly a Muggle tea shop, though, as soon as he spotted the tawny brown owl perched on a lovely wooden stand in the corner, and his suspicion was rather strongly confirmed when the young man waiting at the counter turned, and it was Malfoy looking back at him.
“That’s it,” Harry whispers. He lifts his chin to meet Draco’s lips again, sloppy and sweet. “That’s it, Draco. God, you’re so—” Draco groans into Harry’s mouth. His entire body is ringing like a bell. Their hands are wrapped together now around the both of them, and they’re thrusting with and against each other. “That’s so good, Draco, you’re—oh fuck—”
“That’s where I
He wasn’t sure what he was doing. He didn’t know what this was. What he knew was that it felt like wading into the Black Lake, the water climbing higher, caressing and pulling, shifting his body weight in some decadent deception of gravity. He knew he wanted to keep walking —farther, deeper— to let the water close over his head and be lost to it.
How to breathe underwater.
is a bad thing.”
“Yeah. Batteries. Can’t picture that many wizards running to Tesco, you know? Does Zabini sell them, too?”
When the sun slipped away behind the skyline and Islington was dark again, Harry went into the parlour and waited.
“Tungsten,” says Granger, softly. Something about the building makes him want to whisper, too. “Highest melting point of all metals.”
—it’s too much. Draco doesn’t know what to do with so much all at once. He turns his face away, hides in the crook of Harry’s neck where he smells and tastes like salt and sunshine.
“In Muggle London? Come on, Malfoy.”
“Just picture it, Blaise.” He smiles into his disbelieving face. “Imagine it all cleared out. A little herb garden, some more flowers. The hives back behind the trees. Imagine sitting out here this summer, drinking your stupidly expensive fire whiskey, with the bees humming at you.”
“What?” he demands.
“Almost two years.”
“And you?” Draco lets Harry kiss him one more time.
Draco pulls the pillow away. “I am drinking my own weight in whiskey, Weasley. I am pickling my internal organs and drowning every thought in my head. I’m ceding my flat to a ghost. And I’d like to invite you once again to sod off. This is a solo performance.”
“No.” She looks away, over her shoulder. “The Evers family. They’ve always had the running of it. It’s only Tom left now, though.”
“For your palette, Weasley,” says Blaise, “I’m sure that’s true.”
“Money?” Draco asks quietly.
“Yeah, we did, Dudley,” says Potter. “How’s your mum?”
“So bid on it.”
It almost feels unfamiliar. He could almost imagine it was someone else’s palm he was thrusting into. He could almost think— when he squeezes harder, slowly down, then up a little faster, a little tighter— it was Malfoy’s grip. Just always shy of too much; always just past what Harry imagined he wanted.
“And you can start without me, back at the Ministry?”
Malfoy's hands in his hair, his fingers twisting the strands until it hurts. Malfoy's face so close to Harry's, their teeth sharp and careless. Harry's tongue tasting the slippery heat of Malfoy's mouth and then the hint of salt on his skin, down his neck, across his chest. Biting lightly at a nipple. Harry thinks about fairytales and books of monsters.
“Sounds lonely,” Harry says. And then, when Draco says nothing—because there is nothing to say—Harry says, “I could teach you, you know.”
; he is paying for this with his own money from his own job and the small, fierce happiness of that is something he could never have imagined when a spoiled, rich, only child had been all he was. He looks around at the bare space, and the evening falls down around him in splashes of grey and lavender across his empty walls.
Later, when everyone else was leaving, she turned to Harry as she was pulling on her gloves. “He’s nice now, really. Malfoy.” It was just the two of them all the way back in the corner of the cloakroom; they could hear the voices of the others coming from just out in the hall. Seamus was ribbing Neville about how often he could be found sitting at the bar of The Leaky when Hannah was working, nursing the same small firewhiskey all night. Rose was shouting a mangled version of Jingle Bells with Ron’s encouragement.
“Merlin, Draco,” mutters Harry. “Why would you be thinking about that?”
She smiles again, and this time it’s one of her real smiles: warm and a little crooked. “Goodbye, Harry,” she says.
Granger pulls in a sharp breath. Her eyes are sort of watery; Draco very much hopes she’s not about to cry. “No,” she says. “No, that’s not a bad thing.” She smiles back at him. Draco doesn’t know what to do with himself.
“Yeah,” says Dean. “You have an alcohol problem, Draco. You need to dry out.”
“Can you do that now, Potter?” he asks. “Before we take Warrington?”
“Draco,” whispers Harry. His voice in the shell of Draco’s ear makes his whole body shiver and press harder into Harry’s.
“Work?” Dudley speaks around a mouthful of pizza, and Potter nods again. “You still having trouble with that—”
“Call your boss,” Potter cuts in. “Now, please. You’ve no idea how much paperwork I have waiting for me, and I really haven’t got time to go through all this with you. Let’s just make this easier for everyone, yeah?”
“What happened to you?” Harry asked.
“What do you mean?” Draco’s face feels hot and tingly, his tongue loose. Perhaps he should have gone a little easier on the bourbon. “That’s preposterous. The thing with Potter is just sex. It’s just a casual sex arrangement.“
“It’s a good thing you’re here,” Potter said after a couple more mouthfuls. “I can’t reach around my back to put the ointment on there. I could use your dexterous fingers.”
“But—I’m needed here, Father.”
A year ago— even a few months ago— Harry would have heeded the note of warning in Malfoy’s voice. He would have been more careful. But care, he thought now, twisted and flowed with the change in landscape; like magic, it fed on a continual change of form.
It occurs to him that Potter will soon be lying down less than a foot from him, if he’s estimating the size of the bed accurately. Under the same blankets, all those parts of his body warm and close to Draco’s.
Draco grits his teeth, grinding the back molars together slightly, then consciously forces his jaw to relax again. “I didn’t say I was giving up.”
"How were they?" she asks as Harry strips off his jacket and Malfoy heads for the bottle of Firewhisky on the little gold cart by the kitchenette.
“We’ll fix it,” Malfoy interrupted. Harry stared at him. When he looked back again, Dulcinea had retreated to the storeroom.
Malfoy kept his eyes open. He stayed very still, but his mouth softened and his breath turned into a sigh on Harry’s tongue. When Harry pulled back, Malfoy’s eyes went down to Harry’s mouth, and he swallowed slowly.
, and Harry wasn’t sure why.
When Granger and Weasley gather their coats and head toward the Floo, Granger sticks a hand out toward him. “Thank you for the discussion, Draco,” she says, and he’s so surprised he almost fumbles the handshake.
“I need to get into some of these society events again,” Draco says, giving in.
Granger and Weasley both look up from setting the table when he walks in behind Potter. After a brief, intense silence, Granger holds out an extra plate to Weasley, who rolls his eyes at her and takes it, setting it down with the other three.
It’s a little odd, seeing Malfoy here at the Manor again. Harry hasn’t been here since the war. Malfoy meets him in the foyer.
, he’d told Granger just yesterday afternoon. Tomorrow he would get answers. He remembers now, how that word can bend and shake, can tremble and break along fault-lines that had been invisible to the eye only moments before.
He holds on tight.
Pansy startles, very subtly. Her spoon knocks against the side of her porridge bowl just a little too hard. “It is,” she agrees, and she offers a smile up to Potter, who she thinks is a pureblood from Ireland and Draco’s lover. When she looks back to Draco, her eyes are sincere. “I’m so glad you two are here.”
“I think the most important piece of it is that Muggleborns look to be the ones responsible,” says Granger.
“You can’t think like that,” Hermione said. “It mattered—of course it did. This is not the end of the wizarding world—it’s just a problem we have to solve. Actually, all the people in St Mungo’s feel fine again after about a week.”
“And?” Potter looks amused now.
"I believe the family was Komensky. There weren't many left even when Dolohov was young, though. It's one of the reasons he was so easy to recruit."
“I remember,” he says, and it’s all in his voice. All that weight of heat and desire.
It’s front page Monday morning. There are lots of stares, and whispers, but Harry finds he doesn’t care. On Tuesday, there’s a full story on he and Ginny’s divorce, and speculation about where he’s living. On Wednesday, someone has leaked the news of his resignation from the Aurors. He receives letters back from all three children, telling him they’re fine with whatever makes him happy, and that’s the last weight off his shoulders.
“I’m not—“
“Am I supposed to tell you what I taste?” His voice comes out rough, like it scraped along his throat.
“Did you take your potion?” asked Harry.
“Draco!” says Dean. “Didn’t know you were coming over.”
side now.
The palm on Harry's right hand—his wand hand—tingles and burns. He could swear the temperature of the room has dropped. That there is a hint of pine in the air.
Draco looks back again. Harry is closer—he’s moved across the room and is only a few feet away. He nods at the window and the sound of metal against metal below.
“I’m sure you were.” Potter turns to him finally, and Draco sees his jaw clench when he takes in the bruising around his left eye and the faint abrasions on his cheekbone. His eyes flash and his mouth turns down on one side as they lock eyes, then he glances away again. If they were alone, Potter would tell him he probably deserved that.
“Mmm.” Millie goes back to her reading, and he tries to nap, but something is niggling in the back of his brain now. He leaves with an excuse about finding a house elf, and wanders deeper into the house.
“Like the dragon has been taken care of? Like its shredded wings?”
“Time to eat,” calls Hermione, and Blaise nods at him, then walks over to the table and holds Hermione’s chair out for her.
There is the briefest of seconds, the slightest tremble of an eyelash worth of time, when Rowle sees his curse coming, and his eyes widen. When Draco slices through his shield like a knife through the thinnest paper. A flicker of surprise. Draco has come to cherish that surprise, from dark wizards and colleagues and random strangers on the street. It feeds him, some days; he drinks deeply from the place he keeps it, the dark well inside him.
Every other thought leaves Harry’s head as Draco pushes his cock inside him. There’s no room for anything else inside this hunger. He hears himself, whimpering and pleading, and it’s like hearing someone else. Someone who needs something very badly.
He goes over to the old place on a Saturday afternoon, with his woven skeps to move the hives over to their new boxes in his new back garden. Ginny waves him through. He feels something inside him loosen when he hears their low, steady hum. He’s missed working with them, talking to them, feeling them pull on his magic. Bees love witches and wizards; even the most common, regular old species of bee is a little bit magic, and between a wizard and his hives there exists a fundamental, sympathetic sort of understanding. Harry had stumbled upon this, and his own natural inclination toward it, when Aunt Muriel had died and he’d gone along with Ginny and Molly to tie up some loose ends at her cottage.
Potter shifts again, and Draco’s attention shifts, too, to where their bodies are touching, and where Potter is trying to hide his growing hardness between them. Draco fans his fingers out against the wall, so carefully. His breath is stuck in his throat, and he makes himself exhale. There’s a litany of reasons scrolling through his head about why this is a terrible idea— all the ways this could end in disaster.
actually belong here,” said the ghost of Draco Malfoy. “Or at least, this is one of the places in which I belong, as it is a Black family house and I am a member of the Black family by blood. You are no Black.”
Sometimes Draco goes up to the battlements, the highest point of the castle, and looks south to the forest curving like a secret smile in the distance. Beyond it lies Gryffindor. Draco wonders about the missing prince, the boy who was adopted by King Godric. What would it be like, to just disappear? To choose
How to break a curse.
“What’s this?” he asks, his hand gone still in the laces of his boot.
It’s not that he often does much on the weekend— he usually stays in, except for getting takeout. But there was something about being told to stay inside that made him immediately want to get out of the house, so to speak.
“Morning, Hermione.” He stepped over the stain and knelt down by the hearth.
“Don’t be mean,” Granger says, coming up next to him. “I don’t think he’s ever done anything with a ball other than play Quidditch.”
“Go on then,” says Dudley, taking the seat next to Potter’s.
“When you—you told me I could touch you.” Draco clears his throat. “Was that real?”
“It makes sense, that’s all. There’s always been something between the two of you. I haven’t always known what it is, and I doubt you two have, either. But it’s always been there.” She reaches out and takes his hand in both of hers. “Are you happy, Harry?”
you? We didn’t talk about a name.”
Potter’s lips slide against his. His breath mixes in with Draco’s, and he can taste the inside of Potter’s mouth now, that slick warmth. He puts a hand on the side of Potter’s head.
Pansy attempts to laugh as she wipes her face. “It’s a whole new world,” she says. “If I’m pals with Harry Potter.”
The key still clutched in his hand.
“Bit early for a fancy dinner, isn’t it?” he asks. He’s wearing some old sweatpants and a Chudley Cannons t-shirt. “It’s only nine.”
“What, Potter?”
“Oh,” says Granger, going a little pink. “You know Ronald. I’d ask George that, if I were you. I don’t want to know what they’re getting up to at that joke shop some days.”
Everything just past ordinary.
It was the same moment Harry had been remembering, when he knew for sure that he was in love with Draco Malfoy.
“Too much, clearly,” she says, and then she’s looking at something over his shoulder. “I think it’s best if Draco goes home for the evening. Could you make sure he gets there, Mr. Potter?” Her voice is very quiet, and the hallway is empty, but Draco startles.
Draco’s chest was so tight. His eyes were stinging. “I don’t know,” he said. The words poured out him. “I feel like I don’t know
Evers lets out a low chuckle. “No problem. Would have been nice for Iwan to ask our opinion before building it, though.”
Draco pours the rest of the carton of milk down the sink, and then goes out to the shops for more. This is the highlight of his day.
Blaise sighs. “You’ve never been that subtle about it. Not to me.”
Potter looks once more, then turns his entire body back around, watching Draco closely. “The garden is empty.”
“I’m going to go by the Rhees place, Granger,” he interrupts. “Just to check with the wife, ask some questions. I’ll meet you back at the Apparition point when you’re ready.”
Draco searches for it, but he can’t find a barb in Potter’s tone. So he just says, “I suppose that’s true,” and follows Potter to the kitchen.
“That lighthouse,” he says. “Is it your family that runs it?
“Now,” said Potter, when they broke apart. “About me fucking you—“
But Malfoy had beat him to it and said, in a bored-sounding drawl and without ever looking up from his newspaper, "You are this team, Longbottom, same as any of us." And maybe it had started then, actually—when Harry looked at Malfoy and saw his partner, the man he trusted to have his back in a sticky situation, and then saw behind that man, too.
Potter does, and it only takes one more stop at a hardware shop on the way back, plus shelling out about a hundred quid, to purchase some peace and good will. Not a bad deal, in Draco’s opinion.
December 24th — Saturday
He knows exactly where they’ll end up when night drops its heavy curtain down on London. After Kingsley tells them all to go home and get some sleep.
Granger tries to send him to the Infirmary, but he can’t leave yet. He’s standing on the other side of the one-way glass, watching Tom Evers, who is slumped at the interview table, waiting to be questioned. His head is bowed, his cuts and scrapes already healed over by the mediwitch Draco waved away. Something roots Draco to this spot, some vague feeling that he might have been Tom Evers once, or in some future that didn’t occur. He wonders if that makes them the same. He wonders what it means, that he understands, somewhere hidden inside his bones, what drove Evers during the long nights he spent alone, on his cot, thinking on all he’d lost or never had at all.
“Blaise doesn’t gossip about his friends,” Malfoy says gravely.
“I poured it down the drain,” Potter says behind him. Draco turns to look at him. “Before we left for the house party. You have a problem, Malfoy.”
had come from. He let his feet fall down to the floor with a resounding thud, and Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“It’s new. A man called Iwan Rhees got it approved a little over a year ago, and they’ve been slowly adding dragons since. They’ve reported some minor damage the past few months— a portion of the perimeter wall blasted in, some graffiti, a little petty theft.”
“Why would she think—“ Potter stops.
“I had a feeling you were coming,” she tells him when he reaches the yard.
December 25th — Christmas
December 19th — Monday
Draco is startled. “Of course not. Pansy, you know I’m actually quite fond of you, yes?”
Potter— as Sayre— has frozen at the exchange, still holding his knife over the crumpet on his plate. Draco nudges him with his foot under the table, and he blinks, bringing the knife down to spread the melting butter that had slipped off.
Draco hopes the look he’s giving Potter conveys the depth of his skepticism. “Let’s go, Potter. Sayre. We don’t want to be late. My mother is not very forgiving of lateness.”
Potter doesn’t look happy, but he nods— reluctantly.
“I see.” Harry looked up at the ceiling. Above him, the projection of Draco Malfoy’s consciousness was probably still attempting to flip the pages of a novel.
“Anyway, you know that tea cosy? The really— er, bright one? With the Queen on it?”
Overgrown is a generous description for the back garden, it turns out. Harry can hardly hike through the waist-high weeds and brambles to get at the patio. When he does, though, he knows. This is the place.
“How long has she lived here?”
“I’m not an idiot, Malfoy. I know how to behave at a dinner party.”
“I think the hipsters have infiltrated wizarding society,” Harry announces when he gets back. Draco is sitting stiffly on the end of the nubby orange sofa and flipping through some paperwork. “Draco, we said no work!”
Draco still doesn’t know quite what he’s doing when Sunday afternoon arrives. He stands there on one side of a seemingly normal street, the scrap of paper in his hand, and watches the brick townhouse slide into view among the row of its Muggle neighbors when he whispers the address out loud. He straightens his spine, pulls back his shoulders, and crosses the street.
Malfoy glances at him. “No. Astoria prefers an apartment in Paris.” They pass through what looks like a formal dining room and then a conservatory.
Harry isn’t back by nightfall; he isn’t back in the morning, or at dinner, or by the following night. A week slips by, and then another.
Draco winces. “She was not known as a pleasant woman.”
Draco rolled toward him, and rested his silvered head on his hand. “You sound dangerously close to some sort of declaration, Potter.”
Harry and Draco kick off with their brooms, flying up beside him, and the dragon roars in delight, tossing his brilliant ruby head back and forth. Phoenix shoots forward, and Potter laughs, aiming his broom in the same direction. Out toward the sea spending itself on the shore, the sun shining on the water until it was a mirror for the sky, the two of them, impossibly, racing toward the clouds with a dragon.
“I didn’t ask, specifically. I probably could have put the pieces together. I’ve heard you’re good with flowers and magical remedies for gardens.”
The ghost of Malfoy blinked, and looked around as though he’d been deep in thought, or reading a book for a long while, and was just coming back to himself.
Draco shudders, and Harry’s eyes move over his face, down his neck to his chest, and then Harry is looking at the point where Draco’s thighs bracket his hips. Draco can’t resist reaching out to feel the skin at the base of Harry’s neck, in the little dip of his throat, the place where Harry’s pulse and his breath race wildly with each other.
“How?”
“I see what you mean,” he says, pushing a pea around his plate. “And it’s true, a lot of pure-bloods just started collecting and displaying Muggle things to appear as though they’ve given up whatever prejudice they had. Still have, probably.”
“I know,” Potter says. “I know you are.”
After a few seconds, Malfoy smiled back.
And Hermione says, "Yes," and then she says, "Do you remember the smell when Ron burnt those beans, and how all the tea we made tasted of woodsmoke?"
Harry takes a deep breath. On one side is Luna, smiling brightly at the people sitting around the table with them, but Harry can see her knuckles pale and strained on her clenched hand beside his. Her foot tangles with his on the floor below. On his other side, Malfoy is a wall of stone and silence, his face as cold and impassive as it's ever been, but under the table, where no one else can see, his hand finds Harry's thigh just above the knee, and curls into him, warm and steady.
“I look like my dad, but I have my mother’s eyes,” Potter had said, the second time he’d stayed over. Draco looked up from where he’d been staring at the photo of Potter’s parents on his dresser. He hadn’t heard him come into the bedroom. “Anyone who ever knew them always tells me that.”
Draco rolls his eyes and walks back toward Greg. “How much?”
“That I’m more than the Harry Potter that gets talked about in the papers, or whispered about in the Ministry. I— I hope I help you remember, too.”
For weeks, Harry attacks the many weak spots in Draco’s sword work. He stops to move Draco’s arms into different positions and he taps the pommel of his sword against Draco’s belly to correct his posture. Draco leaves their sessions sweaty and bruised. He goes to bed sore and wakes up stiff and pained in the morning. When Harry decides his swordsmanship is better, he pivots to hand to hand combat.
“You don’t even know what to do with yourself now, do you?” Malfoy pressed. “Who
The ghost of Draco Malfoy raised one semi-translucent eyebrow. The clock on the mantle ticked its way beyond midnight and Harry struggled to catch his breath.
Draco pulls out a pinch of Floo Powder from the pot on the mantle and throws it in the fireplace. He steps in and says, “Malfoy Manor.” Potter’s face, and his bare feet stuck up on Draco’s coffee table, is the last thing he sees before he swirls out of sight.
“Perhaps the rains have finally broken,” Draco replies, and Regulus comes to stand with him at the window. One of the new recruits lifts the hem of his tunic to wipe at his face. Someone shouts something rude at him, but he only laughs. Draco has been watching him for nearly a fortnight and his good humor has never slipped.
Weasley sits down on the edge of his mattress instead. “So you live above a bar now? Why aren’t you at the Manor, being catered to by house elves? You’d at least smell better.”
He opens his eyes, and this time there’s a tall figure behind him. A man’s hand on the back of his neck, fingers curling around into sight. As he watches, the Harry in the mirror closes his eyes and leans forward under the other man’s force. He’s naked suddenly, his cock hard and flushed and his hands pressed against the glass. His breath fogging up the mirror. There’s no sound; the man thrusting behind him, into him, the smack of skin against skin and words falling out of their mouths are all silent, like a television put on mute. The Harry in the mirror reaches up and behind him, tangles his fingers in soft blond hair.
given you a key, and that you haven’t already done the same, to be quite frank,” Blaise is saying.
“Oh,” said Harry. “I’m sorry.”
Draco takes the opportunity while Potter is gone to look more closely around him. The place has the distinct look of neglect, a specific kind when someone lives on their own and probably doesn’t take much care of themselves, either. And yet, there are magical photos of smiling people tacked up on the wall by the old hob and a huge copper kettle ready and waiting. There are stacks of plates and cups and jars of utensils on the open shelving and Draco can imagine a large group of people in here, laughing and dining and enjoying themselves. He remembers when he was a child and the Manor filled up with visitors, and thinks about long weekends and school breaks spent with Blaise. The chatter, the laughter. The wreck of their dining table when everyone stood up, full and happy. He allows himself a brief moment to feel the loss like a physical amputation, and then he pushes it away.
“This is my home,” Draco says quietly. “I’ve done a good job, Father—”
Narcissa looks away from Potter and meets his eyes. “Draco, my darling— did you really think I would ever allow anyone into our home again if I was not absolutely sure who they were?”
Luna rips off the bottom of her shirt to wipe the blood away from her upper arm and then aims her wand at the wound. The skin knits itself back together slowly.
“I still feel like we’re missing something,” Draco says. Guests are leaving, the appearance of Aurors being a great deterrence to fun, apparently. He watches Madam Flint hurrying her son along, and he realizes what it is. “Granger, have you got this covered?”
“You can touch
Potter turns back to look at him. “Ghosts don’t change their shape, Malfoy.”
“We’ll have to start slaughtering the draft animals by midwinter.”
Harry rolls over onto his stomach and rests on his elbows to look down at Draco’s face. “What’s wrong with the capital?”
, he thinks,
“So you’re saying I can’t know, for sure. That I will never know.”
The guy from Accounting who came by sometimes to nervously tell Harry the Aurors were over budget on office supplies or requests for meal reimbursements, and how his wire-rimmed glasses might fog up and fall off when he sucked someone off.
“Got a warrant?” he asks as soon as Draco introduces himself.
“But Hermione, you can’t expect me to—“ Weasley rubs his hand over his face, agitated. “And anyway, who do we know that can cozy up with some Death Eater wannabes?”
“Oh, yes. I’m sure that’s the reason you missed it.” For the first time that evening, some bite creeps into Pansy’s voice.
He couldn’t tell Malfoy any of that, and it made him angrier. “I know enough,” he shot back, and the wall of crockery shivered and shook behind them.
The next morning, Harry knocks on the front door of Malfoy Manor. An older house elf, wearing a cravat and bowtie, shows him into a small parlor, where Narcissa is waiting.
Harry smiled, and it stretched out his mouth and the warm space in his chest that was its own kind of magic. “Apparently,” he answered.
“What I don’t want is to be sold like cattle for the good of my family estate,” Pansy interrupts. “That’s already happened. What I don’t want is to be denied the ruling of my estate because I am a woman. I would have been good at it. Much better than my fool of a cousin.”
Draco breathes and watches Harry’s jaw flex. He rubs the back of his head and his hair stands up in small, dark spikes.
Harry asks about Pansy one night while Draco is writing a letter to his father. Draco looks closely at Harry’s face, but all he can see is curiosity.
“Cheer up, Malfoy.” Robards says, sending a pile of memos flying across the room with his wand. They shuffle themselves in midair, and fall singularly, like giant snowflakes, on desks all around the bullpen. Draco can hear a chorus of groans start up. “You’ve got more time to ingratiate yourself to our future Minister of Magic.”
“You have a bit of dirt, you know,” Harry said. “There—“ he waved his hand at Malfoy’s face.
When he emerges around midnight, Potter is asleep on the sofa, snoring. He moves quietly around his tiny kitchen. Out in the garden, the ghost is moving around the perimeter, touching the wall here and there, looking over the rose bushes and shaking its head. It has long hair, but the build of a man, and it pulls an old pocket watch from a front pocket. It moves fretfully, as if searching for a way out. Draco watches for awhile, something hard and icy growing and spreading inside his chest, until finally he pulls the curtains so that the garden is hidden, and goes back to bed.
“Looking for anything in particular?” Draco asks him, taking the arm chair across the desk.
“What do you think she was thinking?” he asks roughly, echoing the question Blaise always asks him. Like other people were such a mystery; like the mystery meant something.
“Yeah, I guess.”
Beside him, Draco stirred. “Never?”
“And?” Harry made himself ask. The flagstones in front of the fireplace were cold and hard under his knees, and for some reason he found himself reluctant to hear what she had to say. Like there was a spell over Grimmauld Place that she was about to break.
“I told you, Ron. A tea cosy I listed.” Potter’s voice is neutral, but Draco gets the impression that Weasley had a great deal to say about Draco coming to dinner. Not that he can blame him.
“I think Ron is going to flip. It’s one thing to divorce Ginny, and another to start seeing someone else. But this someone else—“
It’s all he can think about, with his cock in his hand and his breath turning uneven. That image of them in the mirror. They hadn’t done that, back then, but he tries to imagine exactly how it would have felt. How it
There are storm clouds forming out on the ocean when he lands on the beach at Ynys Llanddwyn. Sand flies out from under his boots, and he turns his face into the wind whipping up off the water for a moment. He looks at the lighthouse. The top is still dark. He turns toward the cottage of the Kitchen Witch and makes his way over the dune, to the little path of crushed shells among the tall grasses.
“She’s not ‘Granger,’” he says. “She hasn’t been ‘Granger’ for decades.”
Pansy comes back to herself. “Tell him— well, tell him.”
Potter sounds so tired. “Work. Ginny— you know we broke up last year? Yeah, it was all over the damned papers. This house.” He throws a look over his shoulder, then turns back to the rather gloomy garden. “Sometimes it feels like the only thing I’ve done right is dying.”
Potter smiles. “About you.”
Blaise doesn’t answer, but then Draco hadn’t expected one.
“Actually, he charms the discman so that it runs without them, just to get around that.”
Draco turns and runs out into the hall. The doors have disappeared, a built-in charm for times like this, and he passes other Aurors coming up the hall for their Portkeys as he goes down. “I can take someone with me,” he calls, and a dark-haired witch wearing the green robes of the MediCorp peels away and runs with him down to the emergency Portkey point. She gets a finger on it just as they step over the warded line, and they are immediately whisked away.
“I’ll send over some artisanal coffee beans,” Man-Bun promises, and Harry gives up.
Harry is never afraid in the forest because there is nothing left there to fear. In the forest, all senses to the contrary, he is already and always done with his dying. The miracle of his body realized only in that moment. In the forest Harry doesn't know fear, but he dreads the waking up. When he awakens after a dream of the forest he is only himself and the slinking suspicion that death has already won; that it won a long time ago surrounded by pine trees and echoes, and he's spent all the years since just refusing to admit it.
“Maybe,” says Draco. “Anyway, I should go. Save me one of the new ones, yeah? I’ll pay gallery price.”
market”— Potter makes air quotes with his hands— “I could help her out and list them for her. Supposedly, that tea cosy is the only one they made. Some sort of manufacturing error. Luna told me that made it more valuable.”
They eat, and eye each other across the table. Draco’s skin feels too tight, as if he might split it right down the middle and emerge as something that looks more like he feels on the inside— awkward and strange and anxious.
“Just—just let me,” said Draco roughly. “Move your hand with mine and let me touch you.”
And it is; it’s so good. Nothing this good could ever be wrong, and neither of them could be wrong together.
“Snuffed it,” says Potter.
an Auror, not when—
Draco is watching a man struggle to fold down a child’s pram, his flailing toddler under one arm, when a voice speaks behind him.
"Yes," Harry says, his voice so dark and low he barely recognizes it. "Yes, Draco,
Inside, they go to the study. Draco closes the door with a glance at Regulus standing watch beside one of the Gryffindor men. Harry stands in the middle of the room. Draco skirts him and heads for the window. It’s small and doesn’t really look over much—just the corner of the chapel and some mud—but he examines the view all the same.
“But— the point is that’s not what happened. That’s not how it went.”
Draco can still see the candlelight flickering over the adults’ faces as the house elves removed the empty plates, still feel the way something opened up inside him like a door to hear someone, anyone, stand up to his father. He hadn’t really understood at the time, had looked again as they left at the portraits lining the main space that ran right up the middle of Regno Hall like an artery, every room opening off from it like an afterthought. Merchants and artists, a famous opera singer and a magistrate of Venice. Royalty wearing heavy ropes of gold from Africa and Rome and medieval London.
Hermione put on her hat and then took his arm again. They walked toward the door, where their friends were. “Merry Christmas, Harry,” she said before they crossed the threshold. “I hope it’s a happy one.”
“Rain check on lunch?” he asks.
Malfoy’s boots dropped down to the floor as he sat up straight, his back rigid and his face hard and cold, like glass. “You don’t know anything at all about my mother, Potter. I’d advise you not to open your stupid mouth and speak about her as if you do.”
He passes through the center of the room on his way to his desk, which is in the back, in the Investigations section. He’s quite good at investigative work, it turns out. He’d mostly envisioned a lot of wand fights when he’d applied to the Auror force, but he liked the puzzle of the cases that weren’t upfront, weren’t obvious.
, base to tip and back again. It had only taken a minute or so before Draco had come, painfully out of control, all over Potter’s fingers and fist and with Potter’s teeth in the flesh of his throat.
An elf blinks into sight as he’s brushing off the front of his robes. “Master Draco!” she says.
?” Draco is breathing very hard now. His chest is moving up and down, rapid and against his will.
"Do you think the information was bad?" Luna taps each small beetle with the tip of her wand, and their legs go still. She places them one by one into a blue velvet-lined box and closes the lid.
If they were alone, Draco would agree.
“Fuck,” he gasps into Harry’s ear. “Fuck, Harry. You feel so good.”
Malfoy pours a palmful of soil into a little envelope and stands, peering back at the little white boxes. “How many hives do you have?”
“This is where you’ve brought me for a romantic getaway,” comes a voice behind him, and Harry cringes. “This—
He holds out his hand, and waits. Draco lets his own hand fall onto Potter’s, and then they swirl away.
“Cheer up, Pans. It all gets better from here. You won’t have to marry that prick, for one.”
“I haven’t always been happy to be here on Christmas. Aren’t your parents expecting you?”
“I’m sure we’ll think of something.” He wishes Potter looked like Potter, suddenly. He doesn’t want to stare at Sayre anymore; he wants to watch and touch and taste Harry Potter.
“It took me awhile, but I came across some very interesting case studies of witches and wizards in isolation for a considerable period of time—for various reasons, from political prisoners, to abuse, to regular incarceration…and even a religiously-motivated, self-imposed isolation. Anyway, under certain conditions, and to varying degrees, isolated magical subjects actually projected their consciousness elsewhere, beyond the physical space of their confinement.”
“A foot rub, Harry,” Granger says, smacking him as she passes him with some silverware. “Honestly, whose mind is in the gutter, here?”
Through the window, he sees Granger appear on the bluff between the cottage and the shore. He drains the last of his tea. The crockery is too dark to make out the shape of the tea leaves. “If you remember anything,” he says as he stands, “
It begins because of that look on Malfoy's face. Because it is mostly dark and because he has perhaps forgot that Harry might be looking at him. That anyone might be looking at him. His head is tipped back on his neck. He is looking up at the fairy lights and, beyond them, the stars improbably winking in the darkness, and he is looking out over a wave of people dancing in a ruin, in a city where four out of every ten witches or wizards had been killed or injured in the war and where the blood from it may never completely dry. And they are dancing now. They are dancing anyway.
“No,” says Pansy, and then more loudly, “Cassius had a business dinner, I’m afraid. But that reminds me of how you can make things up to me. We’re having a house party right after Christmas, at Cassius’s place up in Scotland. You must come, Draco.” She looks across the table and catches Potter’s eye. “And you, too, Dudley.”
“So Iwan is the foreigner, then.”
The ghost in his garden is just a kid who died here a long time ago. Draco wonders if he’d been happy, while he was alive. If he thought about that life at all anymore; if he had regrets. The ghost quickly loses interest in him, though, and bobs away toward the little gate at the back of the garden. Draco stays, and watches as he inspects every barren plant, lost in whatever world he left behind.
“Perhaps because they’re all
Potter nods. “I can Side-Along her myself. Just give me a moment to send a quick message to Hermione.” Potter squeezes Pansy’s hand one last time, then stands and walks over out to the balcony. Draco can see a large silver stag erupt from his wand, and Potter talking to it. He gives Pansy a quick hug and hands her a handkerchief.
“Yes. She really is gifted.”
“We won’t get out without being seen,” Potter says, looking around. “They’re moving too fast. There must be a lift I didn’t know about around the corner. There—“ he points at the cabinet. “We’ll wait them out in there.”
If anything, Potter looks more amazed than ever. “You tracked me down here at the Ministry to ask about buying my aunt’s tea cosy? Why didn’t you owl me?”
The lady clucked, and pointed her wand at him. He stiffened, but she just shot a drying spell at him, probably mixed with a slight warming charm, too. It felt like being wrapped up in a hot towel just out of the dryer.
By the time Potter went utterly still, some indecipherable words on his lips and his head thrown back as if he was talking to Draco and the gods both, his own breath was coming so hard and hot that he hardly recognized himself. He hadn’t touched his own cock yet, but somehow Potter’s pleasure and being its sole source had pleasured
“Angry? Merlin, no. Are you joking? I was worried you would find someone younger, that I’d see pictures splashed all over the Prophet of some fresh-faced thing and everyone would be talking about how you traded up. And then you went and not only shacked up with someone exactly your age, but a man to boot.”
Harry spun around, his spoon clattering to the floor, and there was the ghost of Draco Malfoy floating through the doorframe and into the kitchen of Grimmauld Place.
“Mr. Potter,” begins the Ambassador’s man, but the lawyer shakes her head at him.
Gray light breaking in striations of gold and the palest lavender over the Thames below. The winding stretch of concrete high rises on this side of the bank, the thick panel of glass forming one wall of his living room. London teeming outside, gleaming stainless steel and blank walls inside his flat. He breathes, the steam rising off his tea and up into his face; malty Assam, tinge of bergamot. He breathes, and imagines the hush coming in through his nose, of quiet circling in tendrils through his veins. The floor tiles are cool and smooth beneath the soles of his feet and so is he; swept bare each morning, made new with every press of dawn’s fingers. He is the thing which he builds fresh every day— layer of soft white cotton underneath, and then stiff white linen against the throat, unrelieved black of the wool uniform on top, darkness all the way from collar to polished boots.
“It’s called a rollercoaster,” Blaise says. “Muggles are so strangely inventive, really. Less to work with, and yet they come up with all these things anyway.”
Potter is maddening and Draco can’t stop thinking about him.
“Spitting nails. The roof’s started leaking again, right in the middle of the kitchen. She just had the contractor in a couple months ago to fix it, so she called him up and told him if he wasn’t there in less than an hour she was calling her solicitor. She don’t have a solicitor, of course— can’t afford one. But I reckon she’s hoping he don’t know that. Anyway, that’s why she didn’t come.”
“We understand, Mr. Potter,” begins the lawyer, “but—“
“He’d been recruited by the Order by then. He was a crack flier, Iwan was. Coulda played professional Quidditch, if he cared about anything but the flying part. He did a lot of surveillance for us. Completely secret, of course. I think his cover was that he’d moved to America for school. He was away from here, from his family, for a good while. And then they all died, except his wife, and he couldn’t even come home until after it was all done with.”
Malfoy will pretend to be utterly disgusted with the song choice, the dance moves, and the assault on dignity the two of them are apparently intent on waging, but Harry has learned where he keeps his secret smile, curled up in the corner of his mouth. Harry looks for it now, and he always finds it on the nights Luna decides that what they really need is dancing.
Granger snorts, and they all sit down. Potter squints up at him, from the seat he’s taken beside Draco, and raises his eyebrows.
“How do you know?” asks Draco.
Harry knows Malfoy is right; Dolohov has very little to lose, after all. There's no telling what he'll do. They will have to wait, try to catch him when he leaves, even though that is precisely the point when they are most likely to lose him.
“No. Why should I?”
Pansy raises one of her well-groomed eyebrows at him and pointedly sips from her own. “Anyway, darling, as I was saying, I really am put out that you missed it.”
As Draco’s guard, he’s supposed to watch, of course. Watch for threats. For assailants and assassins, for angry peasants and scheming noblemen. But his watching is different, somehow. Draco has always had guards like he’s always had a shadow, always gone everywhere with someone meant to protect him. He’s never felt watched like this, though. He’s never been so aware of his own body and its movements as seen by Harry, watching him.
When the waves have stopped, he carefully pulls out each hive’s queen and carries her gently to the baskets. When he's done, he finds Ginny standing a few feet behind him. She holds out a cup of tea, and they sit down on the back steps.
Potter makes a very particular sound when Draco puts one— then two— slick fingers inside his arse. A high, breathy kind of sound, like he’s swallowed a word before it left his tongue. Draco has memorized all the sounds Potter makes when they do this together.
The doors to his father’s study swing open from the middle, like a gate. These days, they are always closed. Draco takes a moment to look at the gold-etched handles, each ringed with an elaborate wreath of roses and thorns. He can remember looking at those handles when he was eye level with them, can still almost hear his father’s voice bidding him come in, warmth underneath the careful modulation of his voice. He steels himself now, and knocks.
Evers cracks a smile, showing off the thick gap between his front teeth. “That’s right. Just like you. We take care of our own here on the island.”
Harry always tells her he is, but Hermione still asks again.
He arches his back— Potter likes that, his fingers tighten over Draco’s— and shifts his upper body. Warrington is talking about the seating arrangement for dinner now, nothing important. He moves slowly and carefully until he can turn his body around flush against Potter’s.
“Yes, but it’s different. Somehow. You were never someone I actively hated.”
She takes a deep breath. Potter is still holding her hand in both of his, sitting beside her on the cushion. “Yes,” she says. “Since the bombing. I knew Cassius was leading a political revival, knew he wanted to regain power for the old pureblood families and separate us from the Muggles, even the Muggleborns again. I knew he was stirring things up, but—“ Pansy closes her eyes. “I didn’t know until then that he would actually hurt anyone.” She opens her eyes and looks at Draco. “McLaggen came here, the night before the rally was scheduled. The night before the bomb went off. He was agitated, scared. He’s come before and Cassius has had to talk him down, but I thought it was all campaign stuff. And that night was different. He kept saying he thought they were going too far. And then— then I saw the newspapers the next afternoon, and I knew.”
Suddenly, all the fight goes out of him. He feels tired, drained. He closes his eyes.
— has a ghost in their garden.”
He snorts, his hand coming up to press against his mouth, and then they’re both laughing. The sun is filtering in through the lace curtains over the kitchen window, lighting a trail over the dishes drying in the rack, and all the way across the wooden table. And right then, in the room where they’d fed their babies and sat down to dinner over nearly two decades, where they’d laughed late into the night over bottles of wine with Hermione and Ron, right there, he feels it: a curious lightening between his shoulder blades that spreads out and down into his chest. And he thinks, at last, that maybe everything really would be alright.
They sit some more, and listen to the night sounds, and it’s a better evening than Harry ever could have hoped.
Potter is looking at him, his brows furrowed. He’d nearly forgotten how the full attention of Harry Potter felt. It’s encompassing and heady. It makes him aware of every breath he takes in and out of his body. “You think they planned the bombing, then. To make it look like someone was attacking them, and drum up sympathy.” It wasn’t a question.
“Pansy.” She stops, surprised. “About the election,” he continues. “And the bombing, and the anonymous tips to Granger.”
Broom rides.
“Er,” said Harry. “Yes, thanks.” He ran his hand through his wet hair.
“It’s just so—drab. It’s kind of tedious and boring.”
rich?” Potter— dressed as Sayre again— mumbles under his breath.
“You’re right—I don’t know who I’d be without”—Harry wiggled his hands in the air—“all that. The dying and not-dying. Voldemort. And I don’t know who I am now, after. I don’t know what my place is in the world. I thought I’d have all this…
December 21st — Wednesday
“I was hoping I could stay here, too,” he says. “While my castle is built nearby, with excruciating slowness. Then—” Harry shrugs. “I was thinking we go back and forth. And Pansy will come with us, of course.”
Blaise spreads his hands out in front of him and arches his brows. It’s a face he makes a lot around Harry. He really is genuinely fond of Blaise.
Travelling—by Floo, by Portkey, by Knight Bus, by Apparation.
"'Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small,'" he says carefully. "'Though with patience he stands waiting—'"
Granger pops out of sight, and Potter looks back at him. “Wanna recreate our own crime scene later? You can play investigator. I’ll play the body.”
“We’re nearly fifty,” he continues. “Think about that. Half a century behind us. Who is Harry Potter, this next fifty years? The answer is: whoever you want to be. And you don’t want to be Head Auror anymore. Don’t let anyone make you feel guilty for that, Potter. You’ve all given too much, all three of you, to waste the next half century of your lives on what society wants you to be.”
Harry wrapped the thumb and index finger from his right hand around him, and took the head of his cock into his mouth. He ran his tongue around, in a circle, then flicked it over the slit there, salty and sensitive, because Malfoy jerked above him.
"No,” Potter says, looking around them and running a hand through his hair. “No, I’m selling it for her. Why do you want it?”
“How do you walk through the world?” he asked, his voice rough. A splintered thing. “How do you— go on? After you’ve done wrong? After everything is different?”
“Right,” Draco says. “Good idea.”
"Alright," Harry agrees. "We'll stay here tonight and talk to Neville in the morning."
“It’s still early,” Charlie says. “We just don’t know how he’ll recover— how he’ll
“She’ll never leave him for you,” Draco continues. “Especially now that she knows what you are. And Iwan still has the girl, doesn’t he?”
“Hermione already knew McLaggen had been here,” Potter says. He’s standing at the window, looking outside. Draco takes a step toward him.
It’s a sharp, overwhelming pleasure, Potter thrusting into him. He wants more, curls his heels into the back of Potter’s thighs to pull him deeper, to feel his belly pressing and sliding against his swollen, desperate cock. Potter laces his fingers into Draco’s, their hands fisted together above Draco’s shoulders, on either side of his head. Potter pushes his weight into them; he pins Draco to the bed and he moves him with only the force of his hips snapping back and forth against Draco’s. In and out of Draco, stroking and burning him up on the inside.
“Do I need one? I just came to ask if you’d seen anything out of place on the island recently?”
“How difficult will it be for you to make those connections, Mr. Malfoy?” asks Kingsley.
“That’s— I do see what you’re saying, Malfoy, and I do believe you, actually.” She pauses, glancing over at Weasley, who is watching the exchange closely. “But the intention doesn’t matter, if the effect is still the same. And I am not at all convinced that this Muggle Mania benefits any Muggle themselves. If this acquiring of Muggle goods and art only benefits pure-blood wizards, isn’t it just the same old one-way relationship, where wizards take and don’t even consider the needs or wants of the culture they’re taking from?”
“Why have I never heard of it then?”
“Ron loves you,” Hermione says. “If it’s something you really want, I reckon he’ll come round, and quickly. Because if you feel that way about it, Harry, it can’t really be bad.”
“No. I’m not a fortune teller.” Carys takes a sip from her own mug. “It’s only for you to know, and address as you like.”
board on the back wall of Zabini Imports. “That’s the one. I need it.”
Potter does this thing with his fingers where he rolls his thumb over each one beginning with the index fingers, cracking the knuckles as he goes. A succession of little pops, at least twice an hour. He clears his throat often, even though he hasn’t got a cold, and he makes endless cups of tea. Potter’s insides will soon float away in a wash of the stuff.
“Draco,” he whispered. He wrapped a forearm around Draco’s lower back, his hand settling into the dip just above the waistband of his trousers. He pulled him closer; he pulled him as far into his own body as he could go with all their clothing still on.
The sea of living people do.
“It’s just a political party.” He takes a drink from his water goblet. “I think a lot of purebloods support it. I just wondered if that might be what Greg’s helping Warrington with.”
Malfoy looked up briefly. “No,” he said, and went back to the futile effort of cleaning off his clothing.
They look down at the corpse lying between them. One of the dead man’s legs is bent at an odd angle and an arm is half-falling into a gutter. The sleeve has pulled down enough to reveal the dark mark.
Granger just looks at him. There’s soot on her forehead. He knows he must be covered with it himself. “I’ll need you in the morning,” she says quietly. “Please go get some rest and come in early tomorrow.”
“Yeah,” Draco says. “Yeah, I do.”
He feels like he’s suffocating. Like the library is a tomb and someone is throwing dirt on top of it. The fire is blazing and there are too many people inside this room, people he’s seen eating off his mother’s silver and also kneeling in the dirt before the Dark Lord, clamoring to be his best dog. He’d seen some of them do unspeakable things. He’d heard more of them say casually terrible things. There is a particular dissonance in his head, like two incongruous images being shuffled over and over behind his eyes until they begin to blend into one. Like he can’t trust which one is the present.
Blaise raised his eyebrows. “Ah, yes. And there’s nothing like that in the Wizarding world, of course.”
“Is that the end of the Traditional Wizarding Order, do you think?” he asks. “Out with a whimper?”
“Ginny!”
“And we need him paired up with someone who has access to members of and backing the Traditional Wizarding Order,” Kingsley says.
“You ready?” Charlie calls, running from the barn behind the dragon. “I’m going to take the last of his bandages off now!”
“What do you want from me?” she asks him. “Let’s speak plainly with each other.”
He knows, because no matter how often he tells himself it’s the last time, it never is. It’s a wicked little curl low in his belly, a sharp stab of heat that swirls up, and down, and everywhere his blood travels through his body, this thing Potter does to him. One of these days, he promises himself every time— every morning he wakes up in the wrong flat, the wrong blanket all rumpled and wadded down around his knees, the wrong walls around him filled up with Quidditch posters and framed photos of the wrong people— he’ll run the right way. Away from Potter, and Potter’s hands and mouth and cluttered flat, from the ridiculous heat of his body and the way he smiles just as his eyes are closing in sleep, every time.
Lucius does look pleased; he’s practically glowing, in fact. Draco’s heart sinks.
“Nah, man,” he says. “You got the last one.”
“It’s not a hovel,” Harry says automatically. “It’s just a very rustic cabin. We’re, you know— roughing it. Apparently.”
Potter makes a sudden movement on his other side, his fingers tightening on the rail of the fence.
“Than any of the dragons. More than the sanctuary itself.” Granger sighs and puts down her quill, leaning back in her chair, which Draco is jealous to note is nicely padded. “Iwan Rhees, he’s a big war hero there. Bringing the Welsh Reds back is about more than just the dragons themselves, you know? It’s national pride, a celebration of Wales and of its future going forward.”
"No,” she says, “and I still maintain that intention doesn’t absolve anything, but— well, it’s not just about right and wrong. If all we’re doing is
“Look at him. That’s an enormous four year old.”
The look on Malfoy’s face— confused, cautious— amused him and broke his heart all at once. Maybe Harry needed to be the change, the perspective. “It’s Christmas, Malfoy,” he said, and nudged the chair in front of his desk out a little. “Come have some dinner.”
Draco sighs. “There’s a listing in your shop. A consignment.”
Draco doesn’t react, just pours some cream and stirs it around his cup.
“I can’t.”
December 17th — Saturday
“No, I do,” Draco says, and realises it’s true. “I used to believe you loved all the attention, but that was jealousy, I think. I can tell you don’t, these days.”
“What’s this? Do you honestly think I’ll be anything but happy for you, if you’re happy?”
Harry fumbled with his own trousers, unable to not touch himself anymore. Everything about Malfoy in that moment, from his pale hair falling over his forehead and into his eyes, to his thighs clenching and quivering as Harry sucked him off, made him feel desperate.
“Get on your knees, Potter,” said Malfoy, as if he could read his mind. He pulled back just a little, and Harry paused, sucked more breath into lungs.
Draco swallows, and asks no more questions.
Draco nods. “True.”
“Wow,” breathes Harry.
asks Harry in the darkness, and Draco says
“Sir? But I have—“
“Uh-huh,” Harry murmured again. “That sounds really frustrating, Hermione. Hey, have you heard anything about Malfoy from the Ministry?”
Then they can hear the door to the hallway open and close again, the sound of their voices fading away behind it. They both stay very still for another moment, and then Draco removes an arm from Potter to ease the door open.
“What’s the common word for ‘manners’?” he calls back. “And do you intend to employ any while you’re staying with me?”
, god, he wants everything.
Harry was, admittedly, feeling rather sorry for himself, imagining what his friends and the people he’d assumed would one day be his official family were doing while he sat at the Ministry, alone. And then a fit of coughing broke into his thoughts.
And still, sometimes it almost hurts to make eye contact with her, like looking directly at the sun.
"There are too many people here." Malfoy is suddenly beside him. He speaks very quietly. "He's armed, and he won't go easily. Someone will get hurt."
He imagines the view of himself from above: how his blood might have looked leaving his body in seeping streams, in slow rivers. He thinks about Potter kneeling there, in the water and in his blood, and how afterward, when Snape coaxed it back into his body, some of his blood had traces of Potter in it. Faint, flickering.
It’s fine. It’s really fine.
“What’s Malfoy doing here?” Weasley finally asks. Potter shifts in his chair, and Draco thinks he’s about to say something, but it’s Granger who speaks.
“Foxglove affects the contraction of the heart. If your father experienced rapid and abnormal heart activity, spells of which tend to become both more frequent and more severe over time, then it could potentially have killed him without proper intervention, particularly dependent on the original cause. Spell damage, for instance, is notoriously tricky to reverse in the heart and the effects often linger.”
It’s silent now in the bullpen, all the murmuring ended. “I want the full weight of the Auror Department behind this,” Robards finishes. “Let’s get to work.”
Draco watches the men train from his tower window. Marcus fidgets behind him. An order has come from the capital. Salazar commands the Malfoy forces to gather near the forest and prepare for invasion. He calls Draco to his side at court.
"Prague."
“Go see our man in Wales after you talk to McLaggen,” Warrington continues. “Tell him I have a job for him in a few days.”
“Granger?” Draco flips open the file and pulls out five photographs, laying them out in a line. “You think she’ll be Minister before Our Patron Saint Potter?”
Hermione frowned and adjusted her glasses. “What? Draco Malfoy?”
Carys is standing at the door when he arrives, the top half open to the coming evening. She makes a strangely lonely silhouette against the brightness of her kitchen beyond.
“The owner, Rhees. You know him well?”
“Yeah.” Potter sweeps the trash into a bin, then carries the teacups to the big sink on the far wall. He looks tired. “Walburga Black’s house, forever. She put a permanent sticking charm on that portrait.”
, something had gone a bit wrong and it had been stuck that way the whole weekend.”
“You jumped-up little cunt,” he seethes. “You filthy fucking—“ Rowle’s wand hand twitches, and his lips form the silent beginning of a spell, but Draco’s lips are faster. His mind is faster, his reflexes are faster. His wand was already poised.
Malfoy makes a small noise that sounds suspiciously like a snort as he pours a finger of the amber liquid into a cut-crystal tumbler. Harry notices the edge of his mouth is turned up.
“Pomona says we’ve only six months of grain left if we use it at a normal pace,” Draco says. “Not enough to see us through to next year’s crop, assuming we even have a normal crop.”
“Don’t be stupid.” Draco is starting to get angry. “I just saw it.”
He taps another one Draco hasn’t seen before; an older man in a suit, jacket draped over one arm, his face in profile as he looks out at the sea from the edge of a ferry. “What do you suppose he’s thinking?” Blaise asks. “Where he’s going?”
“I just know,” Draco says on his way out. “I have excellent taste.”
“Of course,” she says, and he pulls his wand out, already walking away.
“I had fun,” Granger says. “I really enjoyed showing her different Muggle clothes, and introducing some Motown into her record collection.”
, or at least mostly; where the solid brick and graceful curving pillars of the Society for Magical Historical Preservation once stood, there’s only a blackened pile of rubble and twisted metal. Part of the buildings on either side are damaged, too, and there are flames leaping through the blasted-out windows.
Draco stands, and walks over to the wall of glass, looking out over Narcissa’s gardens. Harry can’t see his face, so he watches the line of his shoulders, the curl of his fists shoved into his pockets.
“Then why would she tell me he was four years old?”
Draco switches a few name cards at dinner so that he’s sitting beside Millicent again. He waits for an opportunity, and watches Potter across the table from him. He’s put on a black necktie with his dark gray formal robes, and he’d obviously attempted the hair charm Draco usually did for him, but it’s not quite as neat; some of his hair is going rogue in little waves and ripples. It reminds Draco of Potter’s real hair, black and perpetually messy, and it makes him think about getting his fingers in it while he does something else with Potter’s mouth.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked instead.
Draco has never agreed more.
He knows as soon as Potter enters the square, metallic room outside the holding cell. If he hadn’t recognized him by height and stature, by the dark, untidy hair and the familiar set of his shoulders when he’s particularly tense, Draco would still have known him immediately by the way he held his head when he walked into his peripheral vision. High and straight on his neck, with the chin tilted up like a satellite scanning the area for the source of disturbance. His body turns toward Draco, but he keeps his gaze away, on the three other people in the room with them: one Auror, a representative for the Italian ambassador, and a lawyer.
“No, just after. During the chaos.”
“I know. I know, Hermione. But my deputy head is strong, and she’s ready for the job. I know she is. And I just don’t want it anymore.”
“Hermione,” Ron interrupts gently. “Harry deserves to live his life in a way that’s for him, and just him. He’s lived it, and given it, for everyone enough, don’t you think? Enough for twenty wizards.”
“He lost someone.”
Draco raises his hips and pulls at them with one hand. Harry helps, and together they pull down the fabric separating them. When Harry’s hand wraps around Draco’s cock he can’t believe anything can feel this good.
“You’re telling me that you have seen the ghost of Draco Malfoy in Grimmauld Place?”
He hears voices coming from somewhere else in the house when he steps out at Grimmauld Place, and he has just enough time to get really nervous before Potter comes into the room.
"But Potter—there is always another wave. You think it's over, that the war is won and the justice meted, and that's it. But there is always another war. Humanity's dirty secret."
Once, when Harry was in primary school, his class went on a field trip to a science museum, and they’d each taken a turn touching a static electricity globe. His classmates had all laughed as their hair began to rise and stand on end, and shocked each other afterwards with their lightly charged fingertips. Harry had been entranced with the feeling of something invisible yet impossible to ignore humming and thrumming below his palm, skittering along the back of his hand and up his arm.
“Why indeed,” says Blaise. “Can we just get to the point rather than repeating tiresome, circular arguments?”
"In what city do we currently find ourselves, Potter?"
“Aside from why,
“He cares about you.” Draco tries to keep him voice neutral, but Blaise’s shoulders tense up, and he turns, heading for the door, half a sandwich still in hand. Draco waits— for the sound of a door shutting, for the inevitable silence.
“He’s expired now,” says Potter.
“I—” Draco clears his throat. “We’ll have to be married now. We should do it in the capital. You’ll be safer there afterward, when the war begins. I know you don’t want this, but—”
“I’m sorry it didn’t seem like I was listening to you,” Harry says, and Draco pauses in the middle of removing his coat. “This place looked a lot nicer on the brochure, but it’s my fault for not checking it out. I was just so busy at work. That’s no excuse, I know, but—“
“No. I’m just very observant, and you’re unusually quiet today.”
Dolohov's wand is in his hand before the cacophony ceases, and then Harry is across the room and has him by the throat. It is satisfying, to squeeze until he feels the man's windpipe compressed and his throat working hard to breathe or swallow or speak. Much more satisfying than using his wand. Dolohov's hair is falling out of the slick pomade-waves it had been styled in, his robes ripped during the fight, and there is a bruise beginning its slow spread across his cheekbone. Harry is surprised, in some distant corner of his mind that has the leisure for it right now, by how much he would like to give this man even more bruises.
"'With exactness grinds he all,'" Malfoy finishes. He looks calmer now. His eyes are focused on Harry. "You're willing to do this forever, aren't you? Part of you is already planning to."
“Does he have a name?”
Privet Drive is quiet on this Sunday afternoon. Dudley answers the door.
“You knew?” he asks her.
“I wasn’t, either,” Draco finds himself saying, and he isn’t sure why. Dudley reminds him a little bit of Greg; he can see where a bully might once have taken up all the space inside him, and he can also see that someone else had taught him how to be one.
“We can hold Warrington for a week before we file charges with the Wizengamot,” Granger says. “Plenty of time to get statements from Parkinson and Goyle. I’ve got Aurors out picking up McLaggen, too. I imagine he’ll have a lot he wants to tell us, once his lawyers start angling for a plea deal.” She wrinkles her nose.
He can see why this is one of the best guest rooms; there’s a huge picture window looking down over the sea, crashing onto the narrow strip of sand below. There’s a large en suite bath with a copper soaking tub attached, and the normal finery he’d expect to see in a high society house. The bed is large, a tall four-poster taking up most of the center of the room.
