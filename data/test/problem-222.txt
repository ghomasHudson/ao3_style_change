"I'm your only cousin that you care about, Sirius. Well, Tonks and I are the only cousins you care for. Anyway, it's not about- hang on. How did you find out about the contract?"
“And if you sigh like that one more time, I’m going to request a frontal lobotomy to be done on you.” Ron warns.
Draco is fiddling with his hands in hesitation, and Harry can see the wheels in Draco's head turning.
"Since he's a fucking deadbeat, I have to take care of my baby all by myself. I just know that my parents are going to say 'I told you so' because they knew that Marcus was wrong for me. I should have trusted their judgement based on my previous ex-boyfriends, but apparently I never learned my lesson." Draco said as his tears were rolling down his cheeks. "If I'm being honest, I guess that deep down inside I knew that they were right, but I wanted to prove them wrong. I can't go back and face them right now. Nothing good ever happens to me."
As getting home, Harry checked the time and noticed that it was 7:56, which is almost an hour later than he anticipated. They had been standing near the front door for the better part of three whole minutes when Harry decided to stand on his tippy toes, moving in for a kiss. Draco on the other hand, wasn't sure if he should back away or not as he didn't want to kiss Harry yet. Finally, he moved his head so that Harry's lips met his cheek.
"You look like me." He exclaimed and she squirmed with excitement as he spoke to her. "We should get a Christmas tree really soon, Draco."
"Please, don't make this any harder than it is for me Hermione. You've known for quite some time that I've been dying to get out of Los Angeles and go to the other side of the coast for quite sometime. The expansion of the company makes it the perfect time to do so!"
"On the outside, he is a grown man." Draco starts. "However, on the inside, he's like.... he's like... he's the light that shines from the sun. He's the kind of guy that you'd want to spend the rest of your life with, and he deserves every bit of it."
He smiles as Harry does this and positions himself behind Harry, pulling out the lube from the nightstand.
"If Harry is the perfect guy for me, wouldn't I have noticed that years ago when I fucked his brains out multiple times?"
"Hermione, hi! What's going on?" Sirius says from the other side of the line, with a smile on his face.
Just as he finishes his statement, a hookup pops up on his iPad. He reads the mysterious guy's profile, and is fascinated by what he sees. He looks at his watch, and decides to meet his hookup.
"But I don't think that he'll find out." Draco says. Well that's what he's hoping for at least. After all, how could Harry find out about this? He wasn't going to tell Harry about
At this moment in time, Tori sneezes, scrunching up her nose and Harry gasps. He quickly gets up to grab a tissue and wipes her little nose.
“Ok. Bend over sweetheart.” Harry whispers in Draco’s ears. Draco complies. He lines himself up with Draco’s open hole, and slowly enters within him.
"It's just that- Well- This might sound odd, but I wanted to make breakfast for you as a way to thank you for letting us stay."
A week or two ago, Harry had been trying to make Tori laugh simply by making faces, but the only thing that he received were smiles. He was about to give up on making Tori smile, until he sneezed into his arm, thus hearing the sweetest sound of laughter erupting from the little baby. That day, Draco owed Harry a dollar for doubting him. Today, Harry was taking Draco out for their very first date and he was ecstatic about it, however Draco was having second thoughts about it since he had to leave Tori in the hands of their friends. Truthfully, Draco liked them very much, but he thought that the guys were bone heads, and he really only trusted that Hermione could take care of Tori. After all, he's seen the guys through a baby doll around one time, and what if they did that to Tori?
"I know I am, and I know that I'm moving a little bit.... forward, but I would rather have you here with me than being at some other place."
"Ha, ha, ha." Harry said. "Anyway, I'm actually looking forward to Christmas. It's my favorite time of year."
About half an hour later, they reach their destination and Hermione sees a restaurant at the corner of the street, a large, worn out, sign that says
"Sorry, Ron." Draco says. "Yours truly has plans tonight! I have a date that includes a few drinks, a bed and a sticky bed sheets."
"Ok, calm down. I'll call Sirius and see if he's seen or heard from him, alright? Hermione says, trying to calm Draco down.
“It’s my birthday, Malfoy.” Harry reminds him. “I can cry if I want to. Besides, I haven’t seen or heard from you all week, so this gift made my night.”
"No, we wasn't, Harry. Please, trust me.” Draco says, sounding hesitant. “Thank you." Draco tells the bartender.
"I mean, I am happy that Harry is dating other people again even though he still wants Draco, but I didn't get the greatest vibe from Inferno at all when Harry was telling us his story. I mean, what kind is hookup name is Inferno? I don't trust his motives. Something tells me that there's more to this Inferno character. I just can’t put my finger on it right now, but I don’t trust him." Ron seriously states.
"Well, I’m gonna let you know right now, Malfoy. I definitely won’t be dating any of the men that work there; however, I'll give it a shot." The raven colored hair man conceded wishing that he can spend a quiet night at home with the blonde.
"I have to tell you, I just went south of the border, and the trip was amazing! I should think about bottoming one day."
Harry licks beneath the foreskin, around the head of Draco's cock as he bobs his head up and down, hollowing his lips to suck on the knob. Below him Draco is restless, though still asleep, alternating between whimpers and quick breaths. Harry smiles around Draco's cock as he uses a hand to pull Draco's foreskin down and suck him properly.
"Well, he put his hand on my thigh again," Blushed Harry. "And I might have jumped on him and kissed him." He said in small voice.
"Aww, Draco that is a very sweet gesture." Harry tells him, appreciating the small gesture. "But, I'm having Inferno over for dinner. I decided that I wanted to cook a special dinner for him since we've been dating for a while. I cooked Mac and Cheese with lobster and I also made German Shepard's pie. Right now, I’m just waiting for the dessert to finish."
The sounds being made are a mixture of slurping from Harry's mouth, as well as some hums and moans, with Draco's whimpers and hisses. Draco gasps aloud and raises his hips to arch his back when Harry slides a finger in with his tongue. Draco clenches around it instinctively, never releasing the grip it has with his subconscious in full control. Harry manages to lick around it and slide his tongue out, then works on forcing his finger in and out of Draco's wet, pink hole, fucking him open by crooking his finger and digging it around in Draco's entrance.
"All I want for him is to be happy. I mean, I love making him happy and - God, I don't know how to describe it."
“Wait! I haven’t-Are you gonna-” Harry starts, but his ass is quickly filled with Draco’s cock. “Oh My God!" He says. Draco starts moving in and out of Harry, which makes Harry groan more and more. After a while, Harry starts to feel comfortable.
"If you want to get away unharmed, get out of my fucking way, Draco!" Harry shouts, gripping his steering wheel even tighter than before.
"Ah, sookie, sookie now!" Hermione says, while the Ron clapped and cheered with glee while Harry breaks from the kiss and starts laughing.
Harry guessed that Gregory was the baby father, so he nodded as he was listening to Draco, who was currently putting his spoon in the empty mug.
"What? You know that I've been dying to see you get married. Draco seems like a good guy and you two look cute together. People would probably whip you as Drarry."
Harry moved closer towards the stroller to look inside of it to catch Tori's attention. Tori looks from Hermione to Harry, and when Harry smiled at her, she moved her little fists around and gurgled happily at him.
The last two people Harry dated were dubbed a 'complete ass' by Hermione. She had disliked Romilda Vane, and she really despised Cormac McLaggen with a passion. His other friend Neville constantly told him that people, especially Romilda and Cormac were simply using him for money, but he didn't understand it until it was too late. As soon as they got what they wanted from Harry, they broke up with him and he was left with his heart, which was completely broken. Blaise, Harry's other friend, would always tell him that they were gold diggers, and in the end, even Harry had to agree with his sentiment. At this moment in time, all he wanted was someone who would genuinely like him and not use him for their own beneficial needs.
"Yeah." Harry agreed as he moved closer to the blonde haired man, waiting for any reaction from him. "She get's that from yours truly."
For the past hour, Harry had watched his parents quickly become fond of the blonde haired man. He was happy that his parents adored Draco as much as he does, especially Tori. They fell in love with the gurgling baby in Draco's arms. Right now, Lily and James were with the cooing baby as Draco was smiling and leaning on the counter.
Harry was currently moving around the coffee shop as he cleans up the dirty tables, making sure that there wasn't any trash under the tables. He really loved his job at the coffee shop and he considered it one of his best jobs ever aside from watching his best friend's two children. He loved hanging around his friends, drink coffee on the job (who favored him and his best friend Hermione), and kill time when business was slow. If you were to ask him, Harry would say that his life was great, however, he was a single man. Hermione and a couple of his other friends would tell him that he was easy-going, and that they would take advantage of him.
Lifting his head, Draco popped up between Harry’s spread thighs. "You want me to stop? I don’t think so." He dipped his head down once more and lavished Harry’s hole with his mouth.
"Well, all I know is that he's probably left for New York already. We've looked everywhere." Draco says.
“I wanted to go somewhere special tonight.” Harry starts. “I think that when you have met someone, you should spoil them a little, right?”
"Of course you can. So two orders of nachos, a salad and a burger, right?" They group nods. "I'll be back with your orders soon!" Luna tells the group.
"I know you don't want to talk about Inferno right now, but anyone who is as stupid as him has the time to break up with you, are the worst people on earth. If they knew you like how I know you, they would adore you in a heartbeat. You are someone’s happy ever after." He tells Harry while untangling their hands to cup Harry's cheeks.
"That's going to be very hard considering I've had a bad night, an exhausting morning and a few bad days. I'm just ready to move on with my life at this point." Draco says in a tired voice.
You guys, I can't cry anymore. I'm really tired of crying. When Harry leaves, he'll be taking all my tears with him."
"So where exactly have the two of you been? Because I didn't think it would be this hard looking for Harry at all."
"Maybe you should sneeze." Draco told him as he smiled at his daughter who had one of her hands in her mouth. "After all, she does like when people sneeze."
Draco nodded quickly as Harry pecked his cheek and made his way to the shelf. As Harry made his way to his shelf full of movies, Draco noticed Harry's dog Rex in it's bed chewing on a toy once he got downstairs. He smiled before he sat down on the couch.
"I like it." Neville says as he give his friend two thumbs up. "Oh, I am very impressed with myself."
when he's been right in front of my face for the longest time. I also think that after ten years of having this stupid contract, I think that I finally deserve a proper kiss." Harry says with a smile on his face.
"But you forget, Malfoy, I don't go out searching for people with the same unit that I have." Ron reminds him.
"I don't know. I thought that I would be pissed off at myself for deleting Grindr, but I'll have to call you back to tell you how it's going because I’m definitely going to hookup with this one again."
"So, was this Hermione's idea?" Draco asked when he was freshly showered and dressed for work a few minutes later.
"Ooh, take a look at this one!" Draco squealed as he took a blue dress with a braided belt off of the rack.
"That's great, Harry." Draco says forcing a smile on his face. "I'm happy that you're putting yourself out there again. But next time, please don't do anything that stupid again.” Draco tells him, while gently cupping Harry’s cheeks with his hands. “You never know what kind of freaks are out at night, especially since you're
"Well, excuse me for being so flexible!" Draco grinned, grabbing his fork while wiggling his eyebrows.
At this point, he didn't give two shits about anything at all. It felt like he had lost the will to go on. He just stopped caring about any and everything, and it wasn't helping that he was miserable.
"You know I always have to call you when I'm in the middle of a hookup. I know it's your birthday and you're getting old, but you didn't forget already, did you?"
"There's come in my ass," Draco states breathily, then punctuates his next question with Harry’s forceful thrusts. "Did you fuck me?"
Draco loved hearing her laugh. It was music to his ears. He tickled her sides over and over again, making her burst with giggles as her tongue was sticking out a bit.
"Tori, give me that pretty smile of yours." Draco said as Harry made funny faces. As Harry was making funny faces, Tori moved her fists happily in a quick motion.
"I was a four year old kid." He says as he went to retrieve the baby bag from the chair by the door. Harry laid on the bed near Toriand he held her hand.
"That's- I don't want you to waste your money. We're already staying here, and I think that's enough."
"Harry. He told me all about it, precisely nine years, and some months ago. Besides, he had Neville give me a copy of the contract." Sirius told him. "Besides, I didn't really see the need for you two to write that contract. You know, I never told you this, but I always approved of Harry being the one for you, since you two were hanging around here a lot a couple of years after college."
Draco looked back at his daughter and smoothed out her brown hair. He smiled at her black eyes, brushing his nose against hers. He was glad that she mostly looked like him. The only thing that she had that weren't his were the color of his hair and eyes. Those belonged to her other father. The moment Draco saw Victoria's eyes when she opened them, he instantly fell in love with her.
"I'll keep him safe, Ron, I promise. Hope to see you soon, and please get to your destination safely."
"Tori, that is despicable on all levels." Harry told the two month old, chuckling when she sent him a toothless smile. "Be happy that you're a cutie."
“Well, right now, I’m a little bit scared. I mean, I haven’t had a relationship like this last this long in the past ten years, with anyone romantically and to tell you the truth Sirius, I’m totally nervous because sometimes it fells too good to be true. The longest relationships I ever had with someone else both lasted a month and a half, and it terrifies me because-” He tells his godfather sounding unsure of himself.
"Yup. I don't need anybody but you, Hermione, Sirius and now Ron." He says before leaning in to peck Harry's lips.
"Yeah! Bachelor for life! Now, let's stop talking about love and let's drink the night away." Draco tells him.
"So, let me get this straight, I'm not a good enough reason to stay here anymore? Is that what you are telling me?" Draco asks Harry, waiting for an answer, but Harry doesn't answer him.
"I'm going to clean up." Harry said, ignoring Draco's last statement. Draco gets up and picks up Tori and gets up from the couch.
I can’t wait to sing our song to you!! I can’t wait to make sweet, memorable, passionate love to you with the song playing with some candles lighting our bedroom. I also can’t wait to sing
"Are you finally convinced that you need someone now?" Harry asks. Draco doesn't even have to think twice about his answer.
"I probably would have loved a date with Armie Hammer or Josh Duhamel, but you are perfectly fine." Draco teased.
Harry watched as the wet man lifted his hands to lift up the cover of the stroller, checking on his baby who was dry and sleeping quietly. Harry smiled at the baby, trying not to coo so loudly.
"You're absolutely correct my partner in crime. Knowing you, you'll be getting the double cheeseburger. Am I right, or am I right?" A blushing Draco asks.
“Cum inside of me!” Harry demands, and Draco spills a large load of cum, deep inside of Harry. Draco rides out his erection until he pulled his dick out of Harry, watching his cum leak out of Harry’s used hole.
He licks them before scraping his teeth against one of them as Draco's legs move to wrap around his waist and push him back in.
"It's too early to get drunk." Justin says. "But I am hungry considering it's 10:30 in the morning and we haven’t eaten yet."
"You must be Harry. I like the whole Democratic look you've got going on. It makes you look highly mature, for a cutie who looks more like a schoolboy. Chances are, you're a total sweetheart. Can I get you a drink?"
"Anyway, I came to ask you if Harry called or dropped by. Apparently, he's been missing since last night, and his friend Hermione, said that he missed a critical meeting at firm today." Draco says in a single breath.
"I only ever went there at night to be honest. When Goyle left that afternoon, that was the first place that I thought of going."
“So, since you also had a failed hook-up, why don’t I repay you by giving you the orgasm that the wimp didn’t give you?”
Harry gets in position right in front of her and does about fifty push-ups before stopping for a break, watching Tori smile and gurgle at him. He grins and grabs one of her toys.
"If you followed all the steps, then it definitely should be fantastic." Draco tells him, and Harry smiles.
"Well, it's great. It feels like you're on top of the world and you feel invincible." Draco answered as he started to lie down on the pull out bed. "It's amazing to have someone that you'll love unconditionally, no matter what. I think that's one of the best highlights I can tell you right now.
"Wait." Hermione says. "Before you say anything, I better call Draco to let him know that you're still alive."
Draco nods as he watches Harry feed Victoria. He noticed that Harry was gentle with his daughter and in that moment he noticed something. Marcus never held their daughter like that, like she was wanted. He only held her when Draco forced him to.
"Oh, I'm well aware of that." Hermione says as she's trying to mask her sadness. After all, she's going to be at a job without her best friend. "I can't believe that you're doing this to me. Driving across the country without me."
"It was amazing!" Hermione says as she sits on Harry’s desk. "It was mind-blowing, hot, amazing… there aren’t enough words in the English language to describe the night, handcuffs and all."
Harry rushes behind the counter and made a cup of cocoa for the young father. After a few moments, he had a big mug that was filled with hot chocolate with whipped cream on top with marshmallows on top with a spoon in the mug. As he was walking back towards the occupied table, Harry noticed the man hunched over in the chair, pushing his hair back with his hand.
"Well, I am so fucking glad that everybody's made a choice for me and what I should do." Harry says angrily, letting his tears fall. "Doesn't anybody want to know what I feel, how I feel or what I want or want?"
"Oh, I know because I always here that on a regular basis, which is strange because I detest that movie."
"This is the hard part. Well...I um, we got into his apartment, and he kissed me. After he pulled away, we said that he had a dinner date in about an hour or so and that we needed to hurry. He said that he was ok skipping the appetizer and just getting to the main course since I was his appetizer. Anyway, we went into his bed, and started making out heavily, until his phone rang. He was going to ignore the call until I asked him to answer his phone. Well, Flames - I, um… he....took his phone out of his pocket, and um, he dropped the phone and I saw your picture on his phone."
stuff, so understand it when I mean it when I tell you: FUCK YOU AND GO TO HELL!” Harry yells, and he turns to exit the bar.
He took a sip from his drink and deleted the app from his phone, not even noticing that Ron had entered the bar and sat down next to him.
came out. That song had always, always meant something to me when it came out, but that song is special to me because we shared a special moment in time in our relationship: we gave each other a hot kiss. Well, I gave you a hot ass kiss and then we fucked after wards, but it is what it is. I kept thinking that I wasn’t going to be good or what if it ended so soon and would you compare me to anyone else. I remember that at the end of it, I felt good and that it felt…right. It was an amazing first time and all the other times were amazing as well. No matter what you think, it’s our song because it was the sweetest song that I’ve ever heard in my entire life, and nothing and no one can replace you.
"I'm serious, Draco!” Ron sighs. “You and Harry would make a great couple. Husky, but a great couple nonetheless.”
"Ugh, this is so fucking frustrating. It been days, shit weeks, since I've tried to fix things with Harry, but he's just not listening to me anymore." Draco tells Luna as he is currently moping in Ron's house.
"Did you have fun, princess?" He asked and Tori drops the toy, smiling widely at Draco, showing her gums. "You have such a beautiful smile." He coos, rubbing his nose on hers.
"Oh, that’s ok. I think I could actually be friends with her once I look past the fact that she can seem like a…somewhat silly and sentimental girl."
"Aww, Harry!" Hermione squealed. "I'm so happy for you!" She says, hugging him tightly. “And it was good to hear this story again!”
"Are you fucking serious!?!" Draco yelled in frustration as he was honking his horn, conveniently blocked.
"Someone was hungry for a bottle." Harry said as he sat down. Draco dug into the bag and he handed him a bottle. He watched as Harry began to feed Tori, who was clinging onto Harry's thumb. Draco simply smiled at the sight, wondering how life could be beautiful at this moment.
After she places the order, she joins Harry on the couch, who is currently taking money out of his wallet for the pizza and wings. She notices that he looks pissed, but she doesn't ask him why.
"I've just been dumped, for the umpteenth time." Harry sighed. "So it's just me and my chocolate covered strawberries."
"Honestly? Yes I am because that contract is almost up. I'll tell you more about the wedding plans I have for you and Draco's wedding, at lunch." Hermione stated.
"Draco, you and Harry weren't exactly subtle about these things. I even found your underwear here several times. Neville said that the both of you use to wear Ring Pop rings and say that you were married, and that you'd like to be married forever.” Sirius told him with a huge smile on his face. “You have my blessing if you decide to marry him.”
"Nope. I'm a bachelor for life. You and I are total opposites. You're the better catch out of the two of us."
"Well, it's your loss." Draco shrugs. "I love people with same unit as I do. Sometimes I love it when it's bigger and thicker than mine."
"What the hell possessed you to do that without telling anybody about this hookup?!" A freaked out Draco asks him. Draco is not pleased with Harry’s decision at all, especially at this hour of the night.
“Thank you, Sirius. You really are the best. I think I’ll go shower now. I don’t want to look like a mess for Inferno, even though it feels so good.”
"I forgot my keys. I was going to pick the lock, but Sirius let me in. He used the spare key you gave him to unlock the door. I'm sorry for almost picking your lock."
"Thank you. Her name is Victoria." Draco says as his daughter was moving her tiny fists around. "You want to hold her?"
"Well, as shocking as it is for me to admit this, but you're actually right. I feel so bad for the guy." Ron asks, even though Draco is still oblivious to what is right in front of his face when it comes to Harry.
So he goes on and explains the details of the slumber party, while they eat out of each others food. By time they are done, they decide to get some milkshakes for their desserts. Once they were done, Harry was going to pay for their bill, but Draco stopped him.
"Hermione, you're the only other person we have here as a lawyer and I’m pretty sure you have heard about the contract between Harry and I. Can you see if this-" Draco says, pulling out his copy of the contract from his wallet. "- is still legally binding and valid?"
"What?!" Hermione asks. "I just never thought that you've been feeling some kind of way about your love life. You can’t just give up!”
A few minutes later after a heavy make out session, Harry starts kissing Draco’s neck, clavicle and nipples.
"Well I did forget to tell them about you and Tori." Harry said. "But you don't have to go, unless you really want to."
Several minutes later, another man comes and stands next to Ron. He ordered a shot of vodka, drank it, grabbed Ron by his neck and made out with him with a mouth full of vodka.
"Please, Harry?" Draco begs while moving towards the driver’s side of Harry's car as Ron stands in front of Harry's car.
“It’s not a big deal anymore.” Ron says dismissing the conversation that they’ve had for the past hour or so. In Ron’s opinion, Draco had turned into a nightmare ever since his fight with Harry two weeks ago. He wasn’t fun or playful that much, and frankly, it was getting to Ron. Draco has been depressed, and it was riding on Ron’s last nerves.
While he was waiting for a smack or a scolding, it didn't come as Draco simply laid his head on Harry's shoulder, making Harry's insides jump with excitement. He only wanted Draco to be comfortable around him. He knows that they're taking it slow like a slow dance, so he doesn't expect anything from Draco now, and he's absolutely fine with that because all he wan't to do is love him like he truly deserves.
"I think your daddy is very cute and brave for taking care of you and being a songle father. That's amazing. Even though we just met today, I feel like we'll be a great little trio, don't you think?"
"See, I- I think right now, you feel like you are becoming my personal, permanent unneeded bodyguard, constantly trying to baby me. Had I known that you were going to pull that shit the other night in my kitchen, I should have fucked you up. You’re lucky that you went to his house afterwards, and you’re lucky that I let you walk away, while I was getting myself together for that dinner date. But, bitch, I'm going to let you know, if you ever pull that shit again on me again in the future Draco Lucius Malfoy, that will be your last motherfucking day standing. I promise you that.”
“I’m going to show you what real men do, bitch. See, you don't know what real motherfucking couples do, Draco! And FYI Draco, real motherfucking couples sacrifice! Your parents should have aborted your motherfucking ass! You’ve made me feel like I’m a worthless piece of shit! I bet your parents knew it when the doctors put you in their goddamn hands, that you weren’t a goddamn thing, but a fucking whore. And you’re going to have that pathetic look on your face, bitch?” Harry asks. “Get it off your fucking face!” He says while slapping Draco on the face. Draco falls down to the ground from the force of the slap that he has just received. The whole entire bar gasps at Harry’s sudden action.
I could go on and on, but I think that’s good enough because you’re a constant/permanent part of me. What I love about our relationship is that it’s never truly been complicated. It was always a give and take, like an unofficial couple that were meant to be. My favorite memory of us…..it was when Mariah Carey’s
Now, Harry guessed that he had been lying to himself for years, thinking that he and Draco had something special. Somewhere along the way of their friendship, he just fell in love with Draco, and he didn't even know how it happened. All he knew was that he fell in love with him quite sometime after they made their contract, but he couldn't pin point when exactly. Since then, Harry secretly wished that Draco would love him the same way that he loved Draco, but at last, it wouldn't happen. The idea to be a happy couple was squashed.
"So how did you rent out the whole cafe?" Harry asked as he shoved a spoon of ice cream in his mouth.
"Anytime. Well, my break is over, but I am sure that we're going to hang out soon, so I'll see you later."
birthday from the man that he loved. The picture is of a cake covered Harry and a pristine Draco are standing with their backs together, making goofy faces at the camera. Harry smiled at it.
Today has been the start of the best birthday of my entire life! I finally landed with the man of my dreams and I have to say, I never thought that it would happen. I finally landed Draco Lucius Malfoy and I love him just as much as he loves me.
"So, it's just me and you, cutie." Harry told the whining baby as he picked her up. He turned down the volume of the TV before sitting down next to Draco, but not too close to scare him away. As he laid down, Harry dug through Draco's baby bag, looking for a pacifier. He slipped it in her mouth gently before laying her down on his chest with her eyes gazing at him.
Draco continues to kiss Harry all over, failing to realize that Harry has slightly pulled his pants just past his cheeks.
"So, how did you and Goyle meet? If you want to tell me, I'm all ears, but you don't have to tell me right now."
“Well, I figured that since we always talk about our friends, I think that we should all meet each other for dinner, and maybe we can set them up.”
When she first heard him say boyfriend, she was wondering if she heard that correctly, so when she asked Harry what Terry did, Harry told her that Terry was a male model who broke up with him because they never spent a lot of time together. With that information, she finally realized why he never fell for her antics and ignored her advances. Although she was a bit sad that Harry wasn’t into her, she was also happy that she found a great friend in Harry and Harry, in turn, was happy that he could confide in her about anything and everything in ways that he couldn’t tell Hermione. After that, they always went shopping, bar hopping, went to get manicures and pedicures, you name it. Harry was just happy that Hermione was the friend that he never knew he needed.
“Aw, yeah! Go-Go bar, here we come!” Draco cheers. “Now, I hope you are ready for round two because you’re a huge turn on for me.”
"Pleasure's all mine, Hermione." He smiles and then turns to Ron. "She's so pretty, you sure she's just a friend, Ronald?"
“Thanks, Sirius. We’ll hang soon so I can tell you how it went. Until then, later Sirius. I love you.”
"If she'll like the water." Draco answered as he smirked at the raven haired man. He then placed a kiss on Tori's bare stomach before he grabbed her bear onesie and put in on her.
And with that, Harry sits down taking in the blonde's appearance. He noticed that the man in front of him was tall, slender, had a pale and pointed face, sleek blond hair, and ice grey eyes.
"I'm Draco Malfoy, and thank you for the muffin." He said shaking her hand. "You've already met Victoria."
"That's so adorable." Harry cooed as he pinched Draco's cheek, causing the blonde to scoff as he unwrapped Tori from the towel.
"If I were to give you this picture of Harry," He says, pulling a picture of Harry, Neville and Draco out of his photo album from about three years ago. "What would you say?"
I used to live by a few rules in my life that I though would make me happy. One of the rules that I always loved by is
"Hello, there." Luna says as she's bouncing Tori in her arms. "I apologize on the behalf of the chef. Ron is acting like Chef Ramsey, and Hermione is telling him how to do things correctly. At this rate, you'll be having dessert before an actual meal thanks to Justin and Neville."
"I don't know. This usually isn't the way how it turns out." Ron says. "Anyway, I want to eat a good hot dog or get a couple pieces of pizza because yours truly is hungry. Speaking of which, have you eaten?"
"Alright. You crazy kids go have fun now." Hermione says as she follows Harry and Draco into the living room. Harry dragged Draco outside after their goodbyes and helped him into the car, buckling him up.
During the ride to the restaurant, Harry kept talking to Draco in order keep him from worrying so much about Tori. As soon as they got to the restaurant, Draco felt a bit insecure. The restaurant that Harry had taken them to was fancy, and Draco couldn't afford to eat there with people who were dressed up in fancy suits and dresses. He snapped out of his thoughts when Harry pulled out his chair for him to sit in.
"You'll never know, Harry. Things will get better, plus you'll find an even better man. Besides, he couldn’t have been that nice." Draco said trying to cheer Harry up.
While he doesn’t have an ovary of eggs, he understands where Hermione is coming from because he wants kids as well.
Harry is just lying in bed, fantasizing about Draco and how he is a take-charge kind of guy in bed.  He loves listening to Draco's heartbeat whenever he lays his head on the blonde's chest. He loves when Draco runs his hand through his hair, flesh-to-flesh.
"Can you imagine me, Draco Lucius Malfoy, in a relationship with Harry James Potter, Ron?" He asked Ron. He was trying to wrap his head around that concept. In his head, it seemed ridiculous, but his heart was telling him something that he couldn't quite figure out yet.
"Not at all." Harry laughs. "I just wanted to brag, since he always calls and brag about his hookup, at the end of his romp."
"I know, Draco. You don't have to worry about me all the time. Like I told you before, I can take care of myself." He says wiping Draco's tear away.
Draco picked up the pace a bit, thrusting into Harry, moaning a bit. Harry, who had his face buried in his pillow, lifted his upper body from the bed and his back was on Draco’s chest. He turned his head a bit and kissed Draco passionately. At this moment, Draco felt like he was on top of the world with Harry by his side. He pulled out of Harry and turned Harry around so that he was on his back and started thrusting into him once more, kissing passionately. They were at it for a few minutes until Draco started to pick up the pace again.
"Yeah. I still feel kinda sad that you didn’t want to join us. But I’m extremely happy that we got to hang out though. But I digress.” Harry stated. "What about the other night?"
"Yup, and Tori is three months. She is the cutest little thing." Harry said. "Anyway, Draco needed help because his boyfriend had kicked him out of their house and abandoned him, leaving Draco on his own with Tori. I couldn't leave him on his own, especially since he was going to stay at a hotel."
Harry knows the feeling all too well. Like his friends told him, people only used him for their own beneficial needs. It hurt Harry to know that people would use him just to gain materialistic things instead of loving and having feelings for him.
"Wow." Harry says as he looks at the clock. It's after 11. He makes his way to the kitchen and washes his plate and throws the empty bottle of wine away. After all that is done, he takes a shower and relaxes under the pulsing water hitting his skin. Ten minutes later, he's in his bed just wearing his black underwear and a tank top.
“Thanks.” Harry replies, hoping he sounds like a normal 34 year old businessman. While Inferno goes to make Harry his drink, Harry pulls out his phone, and calls Draco. Draco answers on the first ring.
Harry frowns as he was looking around the dimly lit coffee shop, running his hand on his leather jacket. Hermione made him shower, put on some nice clothes and drove him to the coffee shop.
"It sure did." Draco admits through his smile. "It took so long so save some money and when I didn't have any more money to save, I just cleaned out my savings account. I always said that when I would propose, I would want to do it in Athens!"
"Why not?" He asks himself, with a small smile on his face, and he gets out of his bed. "It's only 12: 17 in the morning. I'm pretty sure that no single person sleeps at 12 in the morning anyway."
"Hi, cutie pie." Harry said making Tori smile and coo loudly at him. Tori moved her arms wildly, so Harry gives her the stuffed animal. "So, what kind of dresses did you see?"
"Don't fill up on too many now." Harry says as he puts the platter down on the coffee table. "I made some stuffed bell peppers and cooked some rice.
"Hey, hey, hey! Calm down, babe." Harry says grabbing Draco's hands as Draco starts whimpering, wondering where his baby girl is.
"You better tell me that you're on the way back here, babe." Hermione says as she answered the phone.
"Yeah, I live in a huge house." Harry said. "You can stay as long as you need to until you are ready to see your parents."
He takes as much of Draco's cock as he can, ending with his nose pressed flush against Draco's blonde pubes. Draco's dick is inching down his throat and Harry hums around it, loving the fullness of Draco's hard cock in his mouth.
Draco smiles at him. "I better get going. I wouldn't want to ruin your special dinner with Inferno." He says while walking to the door.
“Draco!” Harry moans as he in know putting his weight on his forearms and his knees. “Put it in already!”
"Wait- what do you- No. Forget that. Why? Don't tell me you're running away from your problems!" She says, still shocked from hearing the news.
"Ok, calm down. I'll call Sirius and see if he's seen or heard from him, alright? Hermione says, trying to calm Draco down.
"Alright." Draco says with glee. Harry took the car seat and put it on a chair so that Draco could sit next to her.
"Awesome, you good looking specimen." Draco remarks as he is making his way into Flames house. Once they pass the threshold of the front door, Flames closes the door and immediately starts kissing Draco. He even takes off Draco's button down, short sleeved shirt in the process.
Now, Ron hoped that this plan would work out. He was happy that they were all free tomorrow, however he wasn't sure as to how Draco would react to Harry's news at all. If he played this game correctly, not only would he not have to break the news to Draco, but he'd also get these two in a room together where they'd hopefully work things out.
Harry ignored him as he walked out of the room. As he was nearing Draco and Tori, he was Hermione beside the stroller, cooing him Tori.
as well, because that song always turns you on. I want to stand in the sun with you, singing this song endlessly or in a nice house in Vermont, where I can sing any song to you, in bed.
"Here's to you, Draco." Harry says as he is raising his glass. "I hope you find happiness, wherever you go in life very soon." Harry says, lifting the glass to his mouth before going to bed.
Harry was constantly looking outside the window as he was wiping down the tables just waiting for Draco and Tori to arrive.
"I think she really likes you a lot." Draco says after his daughter released a burp. After he burped, Draco placed he in the stoller, secured a little hat over her head and covered the stroller with a blanker.
"What? I'm confused. Run this by me one more time." Ron said as he put his sandwich down. "Why didn't you tell Harry what happened the other night with that asshole?"
Licking and sucking, Draco adored his hole. Harry moved unconsciously on the bed, wiggling his hips, trying to get Draco’s tongue in deeper. He desperately wanted Draco to lick his insides.  He could feel Draco’s cheeks pressed against the sides of his thighs and he reached down to pat Draco’s head. He intended to just run his fingers though the other boy’s hair, but he found himself pushing Draco’s face further into his own ass. After Draco ate Harry out, he inserted his length back inside Harry’s hole and started to thrust into him.
It's been nearly 10 years later, and not much as changed. Harry is now a successful lawyer, who's still looking for Mr. Right. He might not look it with his glittery apron, but he is a rich man, who is completely modest about nearly everything in his life. He is ready to settle down, and live a life with someone who wants a quiet life with him.
"Well, I for one, am glad that you had a good time. I hope we can have more of these. Seeing as how we're taking it slow, I only have one question."
Draco's cock is standing rigid, sticking up straight into the air at an angle. Harry eyes it hungrily and he wraps a hand around it, giving it a quick stroke. He probably shouldn’t be doing this, he thinks as his mouth waters, but then Draco's dick twitches in his grasp and he licks his lips and swallows the head down.
"You'll never know what'll happen if you sit here and wallow." Ron tells him. "Now, go buy some food and take back your quality time with Harry." He tells Draco.
"I've been hanging in there!" He says while patting Neville on the back. "How've you been?" He asks when they pull away from the hug.
Draco can only smile as he pulls out his softening dick and cuddling Harry in his arms. He kisses Harry's head.
....yeah, that one is very hard to do, mainly because it is easy to put the blame on someone else's. I know it's super easy to make petty excuses for something that doesn't happen or to conform to something that you aren't, but it's human nature, and I always learn how to take a cue from you when it calls for it. Seeing you own up to your mistakes....it's a huge turn on.
"Yeah." She moans. "Let me bend over so that you can spank me." She begs bending over. He compiles to her wish and spanks him.
“I'm tired of having my heart broken by assholes who don't appreciate me. Sometimes I feel like it just isn't worth it looking for love since Draco is…..Draco." Harry says.
Ronald Billius Weasley, who came from a big family, is a good looking man who was popular with the ladies. Shit, even men were enticed by his red hair which he absolutely loved. He is a honest man who would do anything to help a loved one in their time of need. Draco was  happy that he found a friend in Ron.
"Awesome!" Ron says ignoring the argument. “Maybe he knows a girl he can set me up with since your wingman game is……rubbish. I keep on forgetting to ask him if he knows someone.”
Draco enters his house, with a bottle of red wine. He puts takes his shoes off and puts his keys on a key holder. He accidentally trips over one of the nearby chairs and knocks down a picture frame. He picks up the frame and inside the frame is a picture of him and Harry. The picture is the same picture that he gave Harry on his 25
Draco simply grins as he puts Tori on her stomach, preparing her for Harry's friends. He hears the door open, followed by-
Sirius bursts out laughing hysterically. "Can you repeat that again for me, Draco?" With tears running down his face. He’s also trying to catch his breath while laughing at Draco. "That's the funniest thing I've ever heard from Harry in the longest time!"
"You know," Harry says. "I don't mind you putting your hand on my thigh again. This drink really calmed my nerves."
"Yes." Draco said without hesitation. At this moment, he's never seen a boy smile so beautifully in his entire life, and he was beyond fond of the crinkles by Harry's green eyes. "I just have a hard time...."
"Make everything twenty times batter. I mean, look at her smile!" Blaise says, poking her pudgy stomach, making her smile brightly at the tan skinned man.
Draco put his book down, and smiled at the man who was currently standing by the TV, putting on the DVD player.
"I promise you that if they do something wrong, then you have permission to kill me with your bare hands."
Hermione giggles as Ron pouts. "I'm Hermione, Ron's friend." She offers a hand to shake and the girl takes it with a grin.
"Draco." Ron says trying to get his attention. "Draco?" He tries again, but he ignores Ron and he takes a long sip of whiskey from the bottle. "What's wrong?" Ron asks him taking the bottle from his hand.
See, when I was three, I met someone who became my very best friend in the entire world. What I didn't know was how that friendship would....evolve into something much greater than that. We went through a shit ton of food, emotions, arguments, tragedies, boyfriends,
Since he wasn't expecting a response, he gently placed her in the water as she squirmed a bit. Harry smiles as he's rubbing Tori's stomach as she smiles at him.
When his grip left Harry’s length, he ran his hand all over Harry’s body. He then intertwined their fingers together, both hand’s above Harry’s head. Draco kissed Harry all over his face as he started to feel his gut tightening. He lost it when Harry opened his eyes and looked at Draco’s gray eyes. Draco forced Harry’s legs wider with Harry accommodating him as he came deep inside of Harry. When he was emptied out, he collapsed upon Harry, feeling drained but satisfied and happy.
"And a gentleman, who I covered for this morning at his meeting, doesn't tell me what happened is asking for a beating." Hermione threatened.
“My wingman game is not rubbish, Weasley. My father will hear about this.” Draco says as he dials Harry’s phone.
made me appreciate her even more because they’re very catchy." Hermione states after dancing along to Kelly's
He started placing everything together based on his dream and how Harry had been showering him with love and affection. The fact that Harry had been the only man that he’d ever slept with without any protection also sprung in his mind for some odd reason. Everything with Harry had just been so… right and he felt so oblivious to his feelings about Harry for so long.
"That was one time, and one time onldy because I was on medication." Ron said. "So you don't need to worry."
"Draco, how much longer will this go on for?" Ron asks him. "You're beyond miserable and so sad that it's pretty pathetic now."
Ron still felt violated and it felt as though as he was cheating on Hermione, and they weren't even official yet.
Harry throws his head back with pleasure. Draco’s tongue delved in once more. It was pushing at the muscular ring of Harry’s opening. He could feel Draco’s tongue entering him. He knew that it was wrong, but it felt so good. Draco kissed his hole and licked again. He pushed his tongue in past the muscle and Harry gave way.
"THE BABYSITTERS HAVE ARRIVED!" Ron said loudly, causing Tori to jump a little in her father's arms from being startled. Draco looked down at Tori, and noticed that she poked her lip out and she began to cry.
"Excuse me?" An old lady says as she and her husband walks up to them with a smile on their faces. "Could you please tell us the time?"
Harry was sitting in his office, blasting love songs on his computer speakers, singing along with the songs. That is until his phone went off.
"Sure. Can we make vegetable lasagna? It’s been a while since we’ve cooked a meal together.” Draco says.
“Anyway, thanks again for the recipe and for the suggestion on the course. You truly are the best, Sirius.” Harry tells him.
"I think that’s a good idea. Would you like something to eat? It’s been a while since we’ve hung out since we’re both busy bodies."
He didn't give a fuck about any of the guys that he was sleeping with at all. In that moment, Draco came to a realization. Meeting up with these men, sleeping with them, and leaving them never to contact them again, only made him feel bad about himself. This wasn't the life that he wanted, especially at 35. He just turned 35 a couple of weeks ago, and this is not how he pictured his life. Years ago, he believed that he would be married and living a great life with Cormac, but now, he thought that it was time to stop hidding from himself in the beds of strange men. He wasn't a fan of that person and he knew deep down that things needed to change ASAP.
“Alright, Draco. It’s a date. I can’t wait to see you guys. Now, I don’t know about you, but I gotta get back to work.”
Draco nods and walks back into the dressing room. He stared at his reflection for a few minutes, and yes, he thought that Neville did extremely well. But still, what was the surprise?
"That's right. I wanted to talk to Harry because I don't want him to leave without telling him how I feel, but the whole plan was a bust." Draco says in a sad tone.
"You see that? She's happy. Tori's practically telling you to have fun with me." Harry said as he took her out of the swing. He kissed Tori's chubby cheeks watching her react before he does it again several times as she giggles happily. Draco smiles as he watches them together. It has now been two months since he and Tori has stayed with Harry and it's been more than amazing. Harry was taking care of Tori like she was his own daughter and it made his heart burst with immense fondness because Harry has been attached to his daughter.
"Hermione says that you're invited. Harry is going as well." Ron tells his friend, hoping he'll go to Harry's going away party.
“So what are you going to do? I mean, I can see why you hook up and I don’t blame you at all. He’s good eye candy.”
Harry licks his lips and places both hands on each of Draco's thighs, pushing them upward so that Draco's knees are on either side of his chest and stretched apart, before he bends over and lets his tongue lick a long swipe between Draco's spread cheeks.
“Why me?” He wonders out loud, before he even realizes it, he starts crying. Every single time he thinks he's found someone, they turn out to be complete jerks. Just when he thought that this could potentially be the guy for him, reality bit him in the ass. All he wanted at this moment was to be in Draco's company to forget about his broken heart.
Later that night, Draco reaches Harry's door and hears something interesting on the other side. He opens the door and immediately smiles. Harry's so busy dancing and singing to himself, that he doesn't notice Draco watching him putting utensils on the dinner table.
"Enough about me and my boyfriend though. Judging by all the love songs, I’d say that your love life is going well for you too."
Now, Draco knows that he and Harry are two different individuals to be in a relationship together. Was Harry making the right decision in leaving? Was leaving him and everything that he knew here the best option for the both of them? Was it truly his job as his best friend to support this decision in letting Harry go?
"At first, I had declined the drink, because I didn't know what he was expecting from me. He must've sensed that I have never done anything like that before. He had out his hand on my thigh-"
"Don't flatter yourself, Potter." Draco said as the blonde came over and gave the credit card back to Harry, who have the man a generous tip. Once they exited the restaurant, they took their sweet time going to the car.
"Yeah," Sirius says. "And as long as you support Harry and his happiness, then that's all that matters. Are you truly happy for Harry, Draco?"
He lived a few miles from Harry, but at this rate, he felt as though it would take forever because, today of all days, traffic was a hot mess. It was like a nightmare come true for him because a few minutes later when he was on Harry's street, a truck was blocking the road. As he put his car in reverse, a car pulled up behind him.
"You'll find someone who appreciates you for being yourself. Anyone who breaks up with you over a text isn't worth your time." Draco says with a serious look on his face.
Draco clenches around him immediately, moaning in pain and pleasure, though still not waking up. Harry knows that he, too, is a heavy sleeper, but with one look at Draco's nine inch cock, doubts that he'd be able to sleep through being fucked by Draco's dick. Nor would he want to, really.
"Draco! Long time no see!" Neville exclaimed when he saw Draco. "How've you been?" He asks while giving Draco a hug.
"Ah! Nah, nah, nah. Hell no! You know I fucking hate parties!" He says, making a disgusted face at her idea.
As Draco was about to say something, whining comes from the stroller and he quickly caters to his baby.
"I think it's great that your plan worked." Ron says, even though he's still rooting for Harry and Draco to get together.
"You're making me hate him." Ron replied playfully, shocked that he wasn't catching on to all the sarcasm he's been throwing for the last few minutes.
"Come on, Victoria. Let's go find your daddy a nice, warm blanket." Harry quietly told the baby that was in his arms. He smiled as she was cooing and buming her little fists against his chest. Harry opened the lenin closet, grabbing a nice, thick, warm blanket for Draco. Once he got the blanket, he closed the door with his foot and walked back into the living room. He dropped the blanket next Draco's sleeping figure and placed Victoria in her car seat. Once the baby was in her seat, Harry opened the blanket and covered Draco's sleeeping figure with it, placing a soft kiss on his forehead.
That same night, a slightly tired Draco shows up at Harry’s apartment ready to shower and go out with his best friend.
"I know, right?" Neville says in agreement before making a face at the smiling baby. "So, what are you thinking when it comes to Draco and Harry, Justin?"
“I uh- I have a problem and I think you’re the best person to talk to about this.” Draco tells him. “Can we meet up later? I need to talk to you about something really important.”
"Thanks, Draco. How do you always know what to say to make me feel better?" Harry asks with a bright smile on his face.
"Well, I guess it's true, because you aren't miserable when he's not gone." Ron says sarcastically, hoping that Draco would catch on.
"I hate the fact that I never have anyone to come home to at the end of the work day! I hate that I come home to an empty, quiet house everyday. Most of all, I hate how everyone I date just dates me because I'm Harry Potter. No one ever finds me as wonderful or caring, and it's a horrible feeling!" Harry sobs burying his head in Draco's chest.
After another hang out session with Ron, Draco decided that he wants Ron to meet up with Harry after a few weeks.
"Thank you, blondie." Ron says. "I just wish that I had a gun. Oh well. At least I'm packing, and friction is what makes the heat."
Well, they met in medical school and they were always in the same classes for their entire school career. The first couple of weeks, both men never really interacted with one another until the halfway point of their first semester of med school. From that point on, they went to movies, binge watched many TV shows, went to concerts, you name it. They have nearly been inseparable since Their medical school days. Their favorite pastime overall, had been watching
As I ring in the start of my 35th year in bed, naked with the man of my dreams, I will always be the one to protect him, just as he always protected me.
"Well, I've tried reaching out to him and I've failed miserably." Draco sighs miserably. "I've accepted the fact that he's going to New York without even telling me goodbye, accepted that I'm going to be miserable without him and I've also accepted that I'll be a gay spinster who patrols the streets at night as a 'Menace to Society' on a daily basis. I've accepted the fact that I've screwed up each and every opportunity that Harry gave me, and now that I'm ready to commit to him, he's gone."
Lavender rolls her eyes. "Okay, this way please." She guides them to a table for two with a lit candle and a small flower set on top. She takes out the reserved sign and gestures for them to sit. "Oh, and you better say hi to Dean. He'll be properly cross with you if you don't. Now, I will be back to take your order." She says before leaving.
"Thanks, Lavender." Ron says, putting his arms around both Hermione’s and Lavender's shoulders. "Now, can we please be lead to our table?"
"Hi, baby." Draco cooed, kissing her forehead causing her to wrinkle her nose and lips to curl. "Do you need any help, Potter?"
"Hi." Draco greeted the dog, softly petting the dog as he heard Harry's dog's tail hit the floor. He looked at the dog tag and smiled. "I like your name, Rex."
Draco arrives at Hermione's house with a 24 pack of Heineken. "I can do this." He tells himself before stepping into the house.
"I think you mean the love of his life, Neville." Blaise told him. "I think you should get it right before Harry kills you."
Draco nods unsurely before watching Harry motion to his parents. He smiles seeing a middle aged couple walking in with warm smiles on their faces.
Ron sighed as he shook his head. He was tempted to take a picture  on his phone to show it to their coworkers and Hermione, but he decided against it. Besides, he'd probably show it to Draco later on, but strangely enough, he didn't have it in him to kick his best friend while he was down. He picked up a pillow that was on the ground, and he hit Draco in the face with it.
"As you can see, she's safe and sound in my arms. I see that she likes getting up early." Harry said.
As soon as they step foot into the building, Hermione is welcomed by the smell of fresh herbs and spices and just
"Draco here took a picture of me, and he posted it on Grindr. At first I wasn't fond of the idea at all, because I wasn't comfortable with having a dating profile. After begging and pleading with me on trying to find someone to hookup with, I finally agreed to try it out. When I left his house, I decided to change into my pajamas, and stayed up for a while, just to look through Grindr. At first I was going to delete my account, until Inferno's profile popped up, asking if I wanted to hookup. I decided why not go for it, and I went to his house."
Harry watches as Draco stomps towards his bedroom before he took the plates to the kitchen. Once he was in the kitchen, he pulled out his phone, found the number he needed, pressed call and pressed it against his ear.
"There's come in my ass," Draco states breathily, then punctuates his next question with Harry’s forceful thrusts. "Did you fuck me?"
"It's like all the guys I've been with just turn on me. First, they're sweet and amazing, then they turn into unrecognizable trash. When I found out that I was pregnant with his baby, I was scared to tell him simply because he would leave me. Thr funny part is, when I told him that I was pregnant, he was extremely happy and gave me hope that we would be fine. After Tori was born though..... everything changed. Instead of helping me with her, he went out, partied, and just acted like we were just footnotes in a book. He acted like he had no responsibilities whatsoever.
“I won’t.” He says, picking up speed in both thrusts and strokes. Six strokes later, Draco is spilling all over himself and Harry is in awe of this. Harry spills his load into Draco a minute later. He collapses on top of Draco, and Draco simply runs his hand through Harry’s hair.
"So, I think we should get to know each other since we're going to be roomies." Harry told him seriously.
It was lunch time at the hospital, and Ron and Draco were at the nearest diner eating some sandwiches and talking to one another.
"Well, I had to check! The last time you said that you didn't want a pizza, you ended up eating an entire box of pizza without sharing and a container of frosting, which you ate in less than half an hour." Hermione deadpans.
On one hand, he’s sad that he didn’t get so talk to Harry, but on the other hand, he was happy that he didn’t get to talk to Harry because he didn’t even know where to start apologizing from.
"Yes and I happily embrace it." Draco answered making Harry snicker as he finally got the door open. As they both walk in, they instantly frown as the house is quiet.
"I’ve already had this discussion with Sirius already, so I’ll tell you what I told him. I need to do this for me. I have literally given all of Los Angeles the best of me and it's officially time to move on with my life. I need to go and explore other aspects of this business and explore my own avenues as well. Please, trust me on this." He pleads with Hermione, and she sighs.
"You know it. The night is still young and we still got tons of food to eat." He says before kissing Draco on both cheeks.
“Then he doesn’t forgive you.” Ron says, knowing that Harry is definitely going to forgive him in due time since he’s been speaking to Harry. “You owe it to yourself and to Harry to clear this situation up. It was a mistake, and you can’t let it keep hurting you or him like that at all. None of you deserve the heartache that you’re going through.”
"Ok. I trust you, but if he does something you don't like, I will punch him in the face and call him a foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach, got it?"
"Oh, I'm sorry. I was just really excited for this date of yours." She says smiling at Hermione who gives her a small smile back. "I expect an invitation to your wedding!"
"Man, don't be a jackass. I've known the guy for a long fucking time, and he's the greatest most nicest man you could ever meet. Just, please go have dinner with him and talk to him and have a good time screwing him or whatever. We seriously don’t need to waste anymore time when you have a date." Draco tells him.
"Come on, Draco. We have reservations." Harry said. Hermione smiles as Draco peppers Tori's face with kisses before handing her to Hermione.
“Ugh.” Ron says as he rolls his eyes at him. “You really need to get out more and stop sleeping around.”
"Yes, but only because I fell into a pool late at night and no one was around for a good minute until someone saved me." Draco responded.
34 year old Harry Potter was rushing around his cozy little home, making everything was perfect his dinner date with Seamus.
"I do!" Draco said earnestly. "I just have a hard time letting people in. The last guy I let in literally left me. He just vanished without a trace, leaning Tori and I to fend for ourselves. I'm just scared that I'll get hurt again, and I definitely don't want Tori to get hurt like that either."
"You're really gonna call him, Draco? Did you forget that Harry's a helpless romantic? Go after him!" Hermione says, but Draco still calls Harry.
"Harry, I know that I'm not your Prince Charming at all. Trust me, I know that, Harry. I really do. I know that you don't need anyone, but you deserve someone and I want to be that someone."
.’ Sirius thinks to himself. "Oh Draco, jealousy isn’t a good look on you. And so is anything orange."
"That's what everyone says, but I always settle for less. I thought that he was different, but I was clearly wrong. When I told him that I was pregnant, he was so happy, but by the end of my pregnancy, he was distance. When she was born, he acted as if she didn't even exist. All he did was cheat on me, drink and did who knows what. I didn't even care taht he cheated on me as I was going to break up with him, but he did that to me in the most shittiest way possible. It sucks that I always find my heart in pieces in the grass because of dumbass people, you know?"
which is far from the truth. What would dad or Sirius say or do?" He asks, hyperventilating over what happened at Inferno’s house. As soon as he sits down on the couch, Draco's phone ring. It's Harry.
"Come on, Harry. You wanted a guy, I think you should try it this way. Just one date if someone finds you interesting. Promise you'll try it, for me?" He asks, breaking out in his puppy dog face.
"According to my best friend, I have a knack for kids. I guess they like me or something." Harry says as he shrugs as he starts feeding the baby.
“Thanks for your help Ron. I really appreciate your help. I'll let you know how it goes." Draco says putting his thumbs up.
"As much as I'm mad at you for fucking me while I was asleep," Draco pouts, "And not letting me enjoy it as much as I would when I'm awake, I have to admit, waking up to you is really good.”
He screams out of frustration. “Sorry.” He says when the bystanders look at him as if he’s lost his mind. “It’s now or never.” He says as he takes a deep breath and decides to walk towards the door.
Harry takes Draco’s hand that is running all over his torso and binds their fingers together as he is sucking on Draco’s length.
"I wanted to buy these cute dresses that I saw at H&M!" Draco says, causing Harry to smile as they get closer to H&M. A few minutes later they walk into the establishment, and Harry pushed the cover of the car seat up to see Tori awake just looking around. Harry gave Tori a stuffed animal that he had at home when he was a child, simply shaking it to catch her attention.
"Draco?! What the fuck are you doing?!" Harry says, flooring the car. "I have places to be and people to talk to, Malfoy! Get this next word through your motherfucking head:
in bed." Draco says angrily. "That Inferno knew how to take care of him in ways that no one has ever known how to, and he made Harry feel very loved." Draco says in a single breathe. "He literally said "
"As long as I get to do that for you as well." Draco said with a smile on his face as Tori started to coo loudly.
Blaise leaned over, grabbing Tori's attention as she stares at him. He starts making faces, such as crossing his eyes, and Tori instantly smiles once her pacifier falls out of her mouth.
"You should hear him talk about you. He's always mentioning you and Tori. He loves that little girl to death."
"Well then, if that's the case, then tell him how you feel about it. If you really do care for someone, let them know how you feel about their decisions." Sirius suggests
"I don't know, man. It just sucks really. Badly. God, he was a great guy." Harry says no longer sounding depressed or sad. “This really sucks, because I finally found somebody who could’ve been the one, and he turned out to be a fucking jerk.”
. He almost knocks out when Brenda pranks Cindy. He’s happy that he didn’t cry or fall asleep because he finally gets to his favorite part of the movie when Cindy and George both forget to take Cody with them after they got married. As the movie ends, Draco throws away what’s left of his leftovers and he takes a shower. Once he was finished with his shower, he got a notification on Grindr.
"You- you're leaving in three days and this is how you decide to tell me? You'd actually leave and not tell me anything at all? Am I that.....unimportant to you? Just...why?" He asks Harry as his eyes are filling up with tears. He literally doesn't know what to make of this at all. At this moment, he is beyond pissed because he knew that Harry was mad at him. But the fact that Harry was going to move away from him? It felt surreal.
"Well, there's nothing wrong with that, Malfoy. I mean everybody needs someone, even you. I will say though, you certainly know what's best." Ron says, slighly mocking him.
"You heard him, Ron. He met some guy off of Tinder, had sex all night and showed up later to work. If I know him as well as I think I do, then Harry is smitten with Inferno."
After about a few minutes, the driver of the truck got back into the vehicle and drove off. As he drove off, Draco sped off as fast as he could to Harry's house. As soon as he got into Harry's driveway, Draco turned the engine off and ran towards Harry's door.
"Can you give me a smile, Tori? Pretty please?" Harry asked as he's taking pictures of Tori with his Canon camera.
Both men reach Flames’ bedroom and both men resume making out, exploring each others bare chest. Once they got on the bed, Flames straddled Draco on the bed and started undoing Draco's belt. Just as he finished undoing Draco's belt, Flames phone started ringing.
"Yes." Harry said. "I like you too, and I know that you've been through a lot, so since I don't want to pressure you, we can take it slow."
Harry simply starts going faster, thrusting his hips with fluid movements as he bottoms out and pulls back out, only to slide back in with powerful force. He wants to make Draco feel really, really good just as Draco makes him feel good. The thought makes his dick twitch as he snaps his hips back in, his balls slapping against Draco's skin. He bends down as he continues thrusting, and not being able to kiss Draco properly in his dazed state, sucks on his nipples, which are already hard and firm from horniness.
"Sirius is truly a God send. We're lucky he's in our life." Draco remarks. "Anyway, what are we going to watch?" He asks Harry.
"Of course I am! I'm truly lucky to have you around so that you can buy the best TV movies on DVD. Besides, that one dude from
!" Draco said excitedly as he kissed Tori's forehead and rubbed her back. Harry smiled as he got up from his bed.
"As long as they're Rated G or PG. I don't want Tori to hear anything that has any type of cursing in it." Draco said as he picked up his daughter.
"Come on in, Draco. Are you sure you don't want to stay for bottomless drinks? Cause we've got plenty of booze and you can stay and hang out with Ron and I for a while." Hermione offers.
"Well, the good news, I'm glad that your date was a success Harry." Hermione said. "Bad news, you're going to have to take my afternoon meeting as soon as you can as repayment for me taking your meeting."
"You're on!" Ron says shaking his friend's hand. "You're buying the popcorn and I got the drinks and the candy!"
"That doesn't help me at all, Neville. All I know is that he's going away and I won't see him anymore." Draco tells him dejectedly.
"So, how's the dating life with Hermione going?" Draco asks his friend as they get back to Ron's car.
The next morning, Draco let out a content sigh as he snuggled into the soft pillow. As he closed his eyes again to bask in the moment of being comfortable, a small golden retriever was sniffing around the pull out bed. Draco smiled when the dog's wet nose was on his hand.
"Beats me, but what I do know is that I'm still holding on to a shred of hope that Harry and Draco will get together within the next couple of months. Those two are too cute! I always found it amusing that Draco looks like Harry hung the moon whenever he talks about him, to anybody who’ll listen to him. I find that their contract is highly useless."
"Lav, please stop embarrassing me." Ron finally speaks up, pulling away from Lavender. "Get us a table, yeah? I made reservations."
"Well, whatever makes you happy, Harry." Draco says dejectedly with his voice cracking. "I hope you get everything you wish for." And with that, Draco turns to leave the house trying to regain his composure.
"It was fun, as usual." Ron says as they give each other a bro hug. He gives the guy behind the bar a bill to get Draco whatever he wants. "Later, Draco."
"Well, I have some news, and I don't know how you're going to take this." Draco tells him. “And I don’t know how this will turn out.”
"I think she likes you." Draco says handing Harry a bottle for Victoria. "She always gets fussy when someone new holds her for some reason."
"You're not even a lawyer, and yet your argument is truly compelling and disconcerting." Harry says as he shakes his head.
Once they are in bed, Draco climbs on top of Harry and starts kissing from his bellybutton all the way up to his neck, then finally his lips.
"Harry, there's nothing wrong with dating and wanting something worthwhile. Although I think you're looking in the wrong places for love, I believe that you're not going to be single much longer. You're one person that everyone would like to have in the long run, and anyone who says otherwise, can come find me."
"Man, that's rough. Well, if you're good and you trust him, then I trust you. Just be very careful, alright?"
"Will do." Hermione said. "Now, you two better have a good time on your date. By the time you get back, she'll probably be sleeping."
is showing! I like this episode. The one where Blanche was jealous of all the attention Dorothy was getting from all the guys at The Rusty Anchor. Dorothy's singing was awesome!"
"I'm not that kind of guy.” Harry says while Inferno takes of his shirt. “I mean, I'm not ready to-"
I live to make my life so....difficult without really considering the consequences of my actions. It was easier to appreciate myself after we got together because in the long run, you appreciated both yourself and me, which is undeniably sexy. I guess I never truly appreciated myself until I almost lost the one important thing in my life, so to truly understand that statement now, is pretty mind blowing and fucking beautiful.
"Ahhh! Ok, tell me what happened!" Hermione says as she sits on his desk. "It better be filthy, show me pictures, tell me the descriptions, names, phone numbers, videos, sizes-"
"Really. It's one of your most endearing qualities that I've never seen in anyone, other than my dad and Sirius. It's something that I tried doing, but it's not something that I can achieve well, but to see you do it is truly beautiful."
"Because I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. I want the boring live, where I get married, have kids, grow old and share my life with someone who loves me in return."
"Of course! Giving a baby a bath is very simple. I think it's better than giving a six year old one. One time, I was babysitting for my neighbor, and he dumped a whole bucket of water on my head."
"I stepped out and sat outside your door for a few minutes. I uh- I went home and had some leftover food and I watched
"Ah, yeah. You won't regret it." Draco cheers as he steps towards Harry, unbuttoning Harry’s pants. “And I know that you won’t regret this either.”
situation, I have to be honest and say that I was dishonest with myself as well. The simplest thing in my life, I made it so complicated, especially when there was something right in front I my face turned out to be my greatest achievement in terms of having the love that I've always dreamed of. You've always been honest with me, and that's something that never fails to amuse me. All though honesty is an important thing to me, it is both a blessing and curse because it can either make or break you. In the long run, I’d rather someone be honest to me instead of lying to me because lying is the one thing that hurts in more ways than one.
“I don’t care.” Draco says as they make their way back into the lounge room. “If people didn’t cheat on their significant others, then bad things wouldn’t happen to them.”
Draco pecked Tori's head and placed her in her little mobile seat on the play mat. He smiled as she was immediately interested in the toys hovering above her.
"You won't as you're staying with me. The weather is still bad and I don't want you or your baby to get sick."
And with that, Draco starts to pound into Harry like there’s no tomorrow and Harry really enjoys this.
"Yeah, you always start off your stories like that, but I digress. Why exactly are you telling me this story, Draco? I mean, you're kinda kicking me while I'm down here."
"If you call giving me a tablespoon that barely had chocolate frosting on it sharing, then you're an angel!" She playfully retorts.
"Well, I think I've kept you up longer than you needed to, so get s good night sleep, Har. Have sweet dreams." Draco says bidding Harry a good night.
"Then he gets hurt. Just remember that time heals all things, and even in the loneliest state of mind, happiness is still so hard to find. Besides, we will always be there to help him pick up the pieces." Neville reminded him.
“Oh.” Neville says. “Sorry about that. I thought he told you that he changed the locks. Anyway, I was actually dropping off the money I owed him. Would you like to go in and wait for him? I have a key.”
"My mum and Lavender's mum used to go to school together." Ron answers. "Which led to me and Lavender growing up together. Her dad passed away when we were only four years old. Anyway, we went to college together where we met Dean who was studying to be a business owner. They got married right out of college –even though she keeps on misplacing her ring, he built this place, and the rest is history."
"I haven't left yet." Harry says, baiting him. Now, he was hoping that Draco would notice the soft and inviting tone, subconsciously begging Draco to take the bait and be his happily ever after. This was the last very last opportunity that he was giving Draco, and he hoped that he would catch on to it.
Draco thinks to himself, panicking to himself. He really should have met the guy when Harry asked him to several times during the time they weren't hanging out with each other.
As soon as he was done with the tables, he looked around the empty shop and sighed to himself contently. He figured that not a lot of people were outside due to the heavy rainfall. It was raining so hard, that the drops were hitting the windows, which made him want to grab a cup of coffee and sit at one of the tables to enjoy the rainfall that was currently taking place.
"We would be a cute little family, don't you think?" A cheeky Harry asks as he nudges Draco's arm for an answer.
Harry has three fingers in when he brushes against Draco's prostate, and Draco's moan turns to a scream as he clenches around Harry's fingers even
The room goes quiet as everyone watches Tori sleep in her father's arms. Harry wraps an arm around Draco, smiles and presses a kiss on Draco's jaw before kissing Tori's forehead.
. And that's one piece of advice that I live up to. I mean, it's so good to explore other boundaries that I've never dreamed of going or doing in my lifetime at all. Seeing you push yourself through my eyes.....it's a huge turn on because you are always excited to try something new, you're always the first to explore your strengths, plus you look very sexy when you are achieving your goals. Your opinions, your excitement and those beautiful eyes of yours when you push yourself, it’s timeless and that’s something that I always want to come home to.
"She's so quiet." Draco said with a smile as he moved Tori's arms a little after he gave Tori her purple binky.
"What the hell?" He wonders and he sees that Draco is calling him. "I can't. I just can't."  He says to himself, sending the call straight to voicemail.
"Thanks." Harry said with a smile on his face. "Make yourself at home. Are you hungry? I could make something that's quick and easy."
“Harry, don’t stress yourself out, my boy. And stop doubting yourself, James. I’ve seen you grow from a little boy to a marvelous young, good looking man, Harry. Honestly, Harry, anyone would be lucky to have you as their husband.” Sirius tells him, trying to calm his nerves.
"It's a pity that you think that I don't know you." Ron said. "You're acting as though we've never met."
Right now, though, he collapses, exhausted, on top of Draco's chest. Both boys are breathing heavily, and there's a poking in Harry's stomach, so as soon as he gathers the necessary strength, forces himself out on his arms, only to see Draco's cock pressed into his stomach, hard.
“Alright. How about later at our favorite bar? I’m craving a martini with a spectacular view.” Harry suggests.
"Well, I know that you and I are free tomorrow. So how about we set up the double date for tomorrow?" Ron asked Draco.
"What the-?" Harry says as he looks in his rear view mirror. He sees Draco walking on the sidewalk "What do I do?" He wonders before pulling away from the curb.
"Trust me. As a confirmed bachelor, I can tell you that I have had some great guys over the years. If I wanted to be committed to someone, then I would have been scooped up a long time ago in a heartbeat. Anyway, my loss is your gain, which means that I am going to find a husband for you. Manhunt, here we come!"
He isn’t shocked, but at this rate, Ron doesn’t understand why he can’t tell Harry all of this at all. It’s truly baffling to him.
"Yeah. I promise you that it's nothing against you because you are the most sweetest guy in the world. I just keep thinking that I'll get hurt like I did before."
"That's because you don't know Draco at all. He's a really nice guy." Harry said as he playfully hit Blaise on the arm with his rag before going to the staff room with the rest follow him. "He doesn't even want any of my money. In fact, he gets upset when I buy things for Tori."
"In a moment." Harry responds. "I'm trying to find my wallet so that we can go to the mall so that we can buy Hermione's present after dinner."
"Hey, we figured that it would be better for him to tell you that he was leaving himself. I'm sorry about that." The red head tells him.
"Damn it. What the hell do I do now?" He asks himself, while he lifts his hands to rub his face. "I just inadvertently did something totally wrong to Harry. What the fuck do I do now?" He asks, hoping someone or something would answer him. "I'm totally losing Harry's trust after this. He'll think I hooked up with his
At that point, Neville simply took a sip of tea making Draco to stifle a laugh, especially when Hermione said
"Let's eat then." Harry chuckles, while grabbing Draco's hand. "What are you on the mood for?" He asks while tangling their fingers together and putting his head on Draco's shoulder, waking to the kitchen.
"Aww, don't be." Harry said with a grin on his face. "Nothing can compare to her amazing father at all."
All these years of convincing Draco that he is capable of being loved by another, and giving love to another man, has finally paid off. I’m happy that it finally took some convincing that he is a good man capable of finding true love and that will always be a part of me.
During the date, Harry was successful in reassuring that nothing would be too pricey for him. They even shared a slice of strawberry shortcake cheesecake, which was fine with both Harry and Draco. Harry was just happy that he got Draco to open up more and he thought that Draco's laughter was the most precious thing in the world. His nose would wrinkle to and his eyes would crinkle up so easily that Harry just wanted to hear him laugh for hours knowing that he wouldn't get tired of it.
"I don't know why you have keys, Ronald." Hermione says as she steps into the house, followed by the rest.
"And the burger for the cute and handsome, young man." Luna says with a pretty smile while giving Harry his food.
After feeding their food to each other, they went back to her house where things got steamy. Once the door was closed, they were wrapped up in each other’s arm with their lips pressed firmly against one another. Within moments, they were in the bedroom where clothes were flying off of their bodies.
“You were hard, and I was horny, so I sucked you off and swallowed you down, then fucked you open, hoping you'd wake up to that, but you didn't and I came, deep down, in the way that you always do, which I like.” Harry says as Draco wraps his arms around him.
Draco simply feels his cheeks warm as he watches the old, cute couple leave, trying not to be too awkward as he glances at the raven-haired man. Harry on the other hand, was trying to conceal the grin on his face, nodding to himself.
"I can't believe that this is how you tell me." Draco  says, becoming angry as the time passes. He honestly can't believe that Harry would break this heart breaking news.
“He just snuck on by, thinking that I wouldn’t see him, but he left with another man.” Harry tells his friend.
"Red. It'll go best with the cake we’ll have later anyway." Draco says through his laughter while he retrieves wine glasses from the cupboard.
"Hell, yeah!" Draco says happily. "No wine, no dine. A simple beer, a quick fuck and a chat with Harry before I go to bed."
"Boys really suck sometimes." Draco says almost three hours later in the empty coffee shop. Within those three hours, Harry found out why Draco was walking in the freezing, cold rain with his two month old daughter. His ex-boyfriend had kicked them out of their apartment for reasons that Draco didn't know, and when Draco went back to the apartment an hour later, Draco's ex was gone. The only thing that Draco knew was that his ex had left him a note saying that he didn't care for him nor their baby.
As soon as their shoes and socks are off, Harry’s pants are on the floor and both men’s shirts are off, Draco runs his hands all over Harry’s body.
Draco nods as Harry grabs his own sleeping clothes from the chair by his closet. As he is grabbing his clothes, Draco goes to the bathroom to change out of his clothes. Harry on the other hand, took Tori to her crib before returning to change into his own sleeping clothes. When he finished changing, Draco stepped back into the room smiling at him.
"I know, Drakie." Harry says genuinely. "Thank you for always having my back." He says while giving Draco a hug.
"Anyway, we met there and he just... won me over with his flirty remarks even when I knew that he was a bad idea. I remember introducing him to my parents and they instantly disliked him."
"Hermione, please -and I do mean please- take care of her. You're the only one that I trust with a human life."
The question stumped Harry. He really didn't know how he was going to tell Draco about his decision. In fact, he automatically assumed that Draco wouldn't care that much at all since their fight that took place at the bar. If, Harry was being honest with himself, he wasn't sad about Blaise and his whorish ways. He wasn't even mad that Draco had hooked up with him at all. Harry was actually sad that he couldn't stop blaming himself for being so damn gullible for far too long, thinking about achieving his happily ever after that he's been wanting for so long. Gullible for believing that something was there between he and Draco, even after showing him that someone is capable of giving him love in ways that Draco was capable of receiving.
Draco is the one that I would cross the ocean for, because he did the impossible in more ways than one.
"None whatsoever.” Draco says, taking a seat next to Harry. "Did you see how Hermione kept looking at Ron when I was telling her about your birthday party? I've never seen someone so in love like that before."
He collapses on the bed as his come hardens and dick softens. The vibrator is still on, nudging insistently at his prostate, but Harry only turns the power down to low, enjoying the sensations and subtle feel it has to offer. It's nice, okay, especially when he's pretending it is Draco’s cock. He's smiling blissfully in the dark, sleepy and content with fantasizing Draco and him in sexual context.
In that moment, Draco sat there for a moment and started to think. It did seem logical for Tori to have a crib for her instead of sleeping on a couch, in her car seat or on their chests half the time. He still wasn't sure if he was staying or living with Harry, and while he was honest enough to say that he wanted to live Harry, this felt like a little bit to much to handle.
"What do you say about teaching these lovely people to a lesson in actual beauty, Har? You think we can take 'em?" A flirting Draco asks.
"What was-? Ok." Draco says, dismissing their behavior. "How have you been? I missed you so much Harry. I have been.... never mind all of that. So what's this party for?"
Draco smiled at the fog before he stretched for a little bit before he looked for Tori's whereabouts. He found the stroller, but the car seat was missing which instantly caused him to get out of the bed. Once he as on his feet, Rex was running around in circles around him excitedly, but the man couldn't play with the dog right now as he wasn't sure where Tori was. Draco's first instinct was to look upstairs, but instantly stopped when he heard the sound of a timer going off in the kitchen. He quickly walked towards the kitchen with Rex following him. When he got into the kitchen, he saw Harry hold Tori in his arms. Tori was drooling on Harry's shirt as Harry was placing two plates on the table.
Draco's cock softens, just barely, but doesn't go down, and after spending a minute still sucking Draco off, even when Draco has already finished coming, he pulls off, noticing his own hard on. Harry frowns, just slightly, but then Draco's legs are spreading on their own accord and Harry's frown curls upward into a wicked grin, which gives Harry an idea.
"You know, for Hermione to say that you're smart, you're pretty dumb." Neville says. "We're shopping."
"Thank God it's Thursday." He says entering his house. He hung his keys on their designated hook, loosened his tie, and started to scroll through his phone contacts.
At this moment, Ron didn't answer as he didn't know what to say. He felt sad that he couldn't help his friend out. They knew that nothing could be done at this point to cheer Draco up.
Draco sobs, getting up from the floor, grabbing a hold of Harry’s right wrist. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I’m so, so sorry, but you don’t understand, Harry. I thought that if I could tell you the whole story, maybe we-”
“It just sucks that I won't be going to your possible wedding to one Draco Malfoy in the future, where you'd become Mr. Harry James Potter- Malfoy, or Mr. Harry James Potter-Malfoy, and taking care of my future niece and nephews."
“Mmm.” Harry whines, but Draco starts kissing his nipples, causing Harry to dig his nails into the blonde’s skin.
Draco chuckles a bit as he pulls his mouth away from Harry’s hard cock. He pulls Harry’s briefs off, and continues to suck on Harry’s hard leaking cock.
"Oh yeah." He moans. Hermione takes more of Ron in, stroking him, leading her hand and mouth in sync with one another for a while.
They both sat together on the couch, simply watching TV when Harry finished eating and played with Victoria with Draco's permission. He was lucky to have a pull-out couch, so he pulled it out just should in case Draco and Victoria fell asleep. Harry got on his knees and made funny faces at Victoria, who stared at at him and cooed loudly.
"No, but I wish I had!" Draco honestly tells him through his laughter. "Thank you for the idea though. Maybe I'll tell them to give you another type of shot."
"Yeah. Like, my mum always said that having a baby at a young age would be hard, but it's not that bad."
"That is true." Harry said. He handed Draco his camera before getting on his knees in front of the cooing baby. "Achoo." Harry pretended to sneeze in his elbow.
Once Draco was safe within the confines of his apartment, Draco moped around his living space for an hour or so. He felt so stupid for wasting his time, listening to Ron and taking his advice. Since he had nowhere to go and nothing to do tonight, he decided to stop moping and he eats his leftover spaghetti and attempts to watch
Suddenly, Draco feels a pair of lips on his lips, and he groans and moans in pleasure as he kissed Harry back.
"How about we eat?" Draco suggests. "I'm dying to eat some of your cooking. It's been a while since I've eaten your cooking."
“I’m looking for Harry. He hasn’t left yet, has he?” He asks Harry’s neighbor, hoping he’s still around the house somewhere, but the old woman simply shakes her head.
"Trust me, Draco. You being with Harry is probably going to be a great thing. He's gonna treat you like the moon and stars." Blaise tells him.
"Obviously, you blonde ferret." Harry answered. "Anyway, when it gets warmer, we can have swim races."
Harry pulls out the lube from the night stand and applies a good amount on Draco’s length before applying some on his one hole.
"Hey, beautiful." He cooed making Tori smile a little. "Look at you!" He said as he put her on his lap and held her head up.
"You are supposed to be sleeping, Princess." Draco told his daughter as he took her from Neville's arms and peppered her face with many kisses. "Thank you, Longbottom, but where is Hermione?"
Draco on the other hand, grinned as he snapped pictures of his daughter smiling widely, moving her arms around happily.
“You- going to my goddamn house ringing my motherfucking buzzer? Talking about me being someone’s ideal
"Hey, besides being a goddamn man whore, I finally found something that I'm fucking great at besides working at the hospital."
He's pushing the dildo in and out with vigor, trying to imitate the ways in which he fantasizes Draco would always fuck him, and not a minute later his dick is pulsing and he's coming undone, again, without ever touching himself.
"Well, I can say the same about you, right?" Harry asks Draco with his head buried in the crook of Draco's neck, with the tears slowing down.
"Thank you very much!" He says, but he misses the evil glare that Draco gives Luna, when taking his food from her. In fact, they all miss the look Draco gives her.
"Oh, hush. They're taking their time to get to that point in their relationship." Hermione says as she plays with Tori's feet, making her squeal in delight.
"A bit." The blonde said as he shivered as he pulled the stroller closer towards him after he dropped his bag near his feet.
"I know, but he was a really, really great guy." Harry says, while swirling his martini around in the glass sounding sad.
"I sure did, Blondie. I can't believe I finally got to hang out with Ron tonight after so long. What other secrets are you hiding from me,
"Just remember, no matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, just remember that I love you." Draco says. "Food, here we come!"
"You think that kissing me would change my mind?" A hysterical Harry asked him. “Did you honestly think that kissing me would achieve anything at all?”
"Oh! Before I forget, I made some fried cheese sticks, homemade breadsticks and I got some salad as our appetizers." Harry says before rushing to the kitchen.
Harry places his arms behind him, rolling his hips into Draco’s thrusts causing the blonde to put his own arms above his head.
“See you later. It was nice meeting you, Ms. Granger. I hope we can hang out again soon!" Draco says while hugging her.
Draco pushes his ass down into the feel of Harry's tongue, making an aborted noise at the wet touch. Harry pulls back and smirks smugly, then pulls a hand down to rub a thumb over Draco's entrance, watching with entrance as he moves the fine, wet hairs around Draco's hole. He licks his lips again and bends back down, burying his face in between Draco's spread cheeks and digging his tongue in, licking at Draco's hole and lapping the excess of saliva that spills out and pools around it.
"We all know that, but Draco wants to take things slow. He's been there with a guy who literally up and left him. For all we know, he's just unsure since this little cutie pie is in the picture." Hermione says.
Fortunately for Harry, the tightness makes it that much better. The pressure is intense and Draco's hole is already incredibly wet from Harry's tongue, but also so very hot. It's unbearable, really, and Harry loves it. He pulls out without exiting completely and slams himself back in, enjoying the way Draco cries out as Harry presses against Draco's prostate. He repeats the action with steady, precise thrusts, again and again, until he works up a rhythm and continues at that pace.
“I’m fine, Sirius. I was actually calling to thank you for the Red Velvet Cake recipe. I thought it would have been hard, but it was a piece of cake. No puns intended.” Harry tells him.
"Really?!" Draco happily exclaims as he quickly gets off the couch, almost tumbling over due to his hangover.
“And he missed a very important meeting, as it was pertaining to this client who is expanding a business in California.”
“Har…” Draco moaned, running one of his hands all over his own torso while the other is behind his head.
"And we don't have all of that?" Draco dejectedly asks. "You're honestly going to tell me that we don't have all of those things?"
"Well, in that case, let me turn up the heat." Draco said seductively. He took out his phone and resumes the song that was playing on his phone. He proceeds to sing it and gives Harry a lap dance.
Harry shook his head and took a seat at a table with a candle in the middle of the table, raising an eyebrow. Internally, he's hopping that his friends didn't set him up on a blind date. The last time he did that, he ended up with a guy who ate like a ferocious animal, played with his food, spit food into Harry's drink, make a hat with the napkin and put on Harry's head, ordered a cake and proceeded to eat the whole cake with his hands.
“It’s my birthday, Malfoy.” Harry reminds him. “I can cry if I want to. Besides, I haven’t seen or heard from you all week, so this gift made my night.”
"Got it." Draco said, and with that, Harry went back to work. He took Tori out the the stroller and rested her against his chest, massaging her back as they were waiting for Harry and his friends. "We're going to meet some new people today, baby girl."
"As for the cake, I hope I made justice by it as I did use Sirius’ recipe." He tells Draco while grabbing the entire cake, two forks and the wine.
Draco rolls his eyes. He is not the person who wants to be in bed at 10 pm, even if he has an early shift in the morning at the hospital.
He was going to send the message, but he stopped. He couldn’t send it at all. He took a moment and wondered what he was doing.
As Harry swallows Draco down to the hilt, he teasingly bites down playfully, and Draco lets out a loud moan and bucks his hips up, forcing himself further into Harry's mouth as he comes. Harry is surprised, to say the least, but pins him down on the bed by holding his hips and tightens his lips around Draco's cock, swallowing the come flooding his mouth and sucking Draco dry.
"Like it? I love it, Mr. Photographer. Now I can see why you're a photographer you nerd. But why did you take my photo?"
"Thank you. May I ask what exactly am I drinking?" Harry asks Inferno. As Inferno was about to answer Harry's question, Harry's phone rang.
While Draco was at Harry’s house, Harry was over at Hermione’s house, just chatting about any and everything that they could think of.
The moment he parked his car in front of Draco's place, he turned the car off and knocked on the door.
A couple hours later in his own bed, Harry decided to check out his Grindr profile. While he did admit to himself that the picture did look good, he was uncomfortable with the whole idea of having a profile on a hookup app.
"You seem a bit....tired." Harry says looking Seamus. "Do you want me to give you a massage or something?"
"I was thinking that she could be Catwoman." Harry says as he moves his hands with excitement, but Draco makes a face at the idea.
"Why not? She's the only artist I care for at the moment, next to Kendrick Lamar." He says nonchalantly. "Besides,
"Harry? Draco? I think Tori left a present for you in her terms of a diaper." They hear James say, making Harry laugh. "I think that gift is a gift for you two guys."
"Don't worry." Harry told him. "Besides, he has a baby, so he needs a warm place to stay since his ex walked out on them."
"Oh. That's fine.” A crestfallen Inferno says to him. “We'll just talk or whatever." Inferno says able putting on his shirt back on.
After a plethora of men that Harry met with at the coffee shop over the past hour, each for about five minutes, he sat alone in his car, wondering how and why his love life was pathetic. Was this all real? Was this all happening in his head? Was it a nightmare? He wished that this was just a dream so that he could wake up from this bad dream, but alas, he was alone.
"OPEN THIS DAMN DOOR, MALFOY!" Ron bellowed as he was banging on the door. When Draco didn't open the door, he simply used the spare key that Draco gave him and entered the house. When he stepped inside, he spotted Draco in the couch, passed out clutching a bottle of wine.
"All I am going to say is that I have enough money to have someone eliminated if I were a horrible person." Harry says.
All I know is, he's the one I was willing to give my life to because he was the only one to make me feel things that I never felt with anyone before.
"Fine. I'll talk to him." Ron says in defeat. He can't continue to live life like this. His relationship with Harry was built on trust and honesty. That was something that he wanted keep in this relationship for a lifetime no matter how scared he was. As soon as he was finished eating, he called Harry.
“I tried calling him, texting, emailing him, and showed up to his place, but he isn’t talking to me. I am not the smartest guy around, but I sure can take a hint when someone is ignoring me.” Draco whines.
"Then Harry proceeded to tell us that Inferno such a good kisser." Draco says with venom in his voice. "How his kisses are very
birthday party when someone was trying to get with him. My Draco, who was the one who encouraged me to be take things slow instead of trying too hard when I was dating back in our 20s when I was ready to settle down.
“Oh boy.” Draco says thinking about the conversation he had yesterday. This was going to be a long night. A long night and a longer conversation.
"And I'll give one more good reason. Maybe I'll find a pretty lady here to ask out on a date." Neville tells Draco.
"I think that after waiting ten years for the perfect man, I feel so stupid and I’ve wasted so much time looking for
"I love that you’re so into the character at the moment. It’s adorable and it’s also priceless!" Harry laughs.
"That's what I've been trying to tell you! I mean, you keep thinking that one guy is exactly what you need to be happy! Harry, you can still have-" Draco says but Harry cuts him off.
"I'm going to go use the restroom. I'll meet you at the car." Draco says going to the restroom. Once Draco is out of sight, Ron pulls out his phone and calls . "One hot dog with extra relish please?"
"Same here." Draco said. "I probably would have been living in the box on the streets or at my parent's house."
"Nothing at all. I just like hooking up, with hot guys and it's really the most fun I've ever had in my lifetime. I've got an idea!"
“Then you’re gonna love this.” He says, before having Harry lying down on the couch on his side. He continues to fuck Harry senseless before he has Harry completely lie down on his back, making sure Harry straddles his hips while he hits the sweet spot.
At that moment, Draco understood that Harry made his decision, and he was going to stand by Harry's decision no matter how much it was hurting him.
Ron arrived at Hermione’s house in fifteen minutes time, and he was proud of the feat. It had been just over a year since he had been in a relationship with anyone and he was striving to make a good impression on Hermione. He examined himself in the rearview mirror, popped a mint in his mouth, grabbed the fresh bouquet of flowers that sat in his passenger’s seat, exited his car and walked towards Hermione’s front door.
"Just- I remembered something really important and I need to go." Draco lies. "Inferno, Flames, whatever your name is, just go have a good time with Harry and we can hook up some other time, if you want. Besides you should be there very soon."
"What am I doing? This isn't me at all. Honestly, I don't even know why I agreed to this. I've got to delete this, immediately. I’ll just deal with Draco’s consequences when I tell him that I deleted my account."
"It's delicious!" Draco exclaimed as he moaned through another bit of pasta. "How often do you cook?"
"Harry? Why are you getting mad at me? I was trying to protect you! I mean what else was I supposed to do other than try to protect my best friend?" Draco pleads as his tears are falling. "Besides, you're forgetting that I never met the guy because you never introduced him to me or the others. His name isn't even Flames or Inferno. It's Blaisé Zabini."
"Thank you. You have a nice smile too, Potter." He says as he tries to concentrate on his book, but fails.
"But let’s talk about Draco. Didn't you notice how he was behaving when Harry was telling his story? I was shocked!" Ron inquired.
Justin Finch-Fletchley was the man that Harry had always dreamed of marrying. He was hard working, loyal, caring, smart and educated. He looked good and he was going nowhere but up. In other words, Justin was the man that Harry Potter wanted to marry and share his life with. After three years, Harry felt like it was time to settle down and start a family with this man.He pulls out his phone and calls his best friend of six years that he met in college in the entire world.
“Now cry about that. Cry about that you goddamn whore!” He says while getting up to leave the bar, which has now gone completely quiet.
"I don't know what to do. I'm sick of chasing men, only to get my heart broken, time and time again. It's so damn frustrating finding my heart in pieces in the grass all the time." A dejected Harry says.
Draco nodded his head as he took off his shoes, placing them on the mat by the door. Ince his shoes were off, he then took the car seat out of the stroller, took Victoria out of it and proceeded to take off her little jacket.
"More like a week or two. You cook too much sometimes." Draco says with a smirk on his face. "I'll leave the food in your fridge and I'll come back another day so that we can tackle the food. Besides, everyone but me is busy tonight."
You’re a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Your mind is beautiful, your body is so…..mouth watering, and that’s something that I never get tired of. I really want to share this life with you, and protect you as Draco Malfoy, the blondie in your life. I love thinking about you on hours on end and I am willing to do anything for you.
"What if you don't want us to stay with you anymore? Then you'd have bought everything for Tori would be for nothing."
"Any time, you ferret." Ron says. "What do you say we grab a drink after we knock off night after we've rested?"
birthday, I think that this occasion calls for a toast.” Harry says as he raises his glass. “Here’s to us for dating each other for three years.” He says.
"Neville, you do realize that I'm not a Ken doll or something, right?" Draco says as he is watching his friend rush around the store grabbing clothes and accessories.
"I spent all day cleaning, a couple hours cleaning the place, and you tell me that you want to break up, after I wanted to make you feel good? What kind of ex-boyfriend, what kind of man would do that?"
And with those words, Draco started to fuck Harry. Every thrust seemed as perfect to the both of them as Draco was thrusting into Harry slowly as if he were worried to break Harry. With every thrust Draco did, Harry moaned in content as every movement had seemed calculated to hit Harry’s prostate. They kissed passionately with every thrust, and with every moment that was passing, Harry was getting more and more reduced to a blabbering mess that Draco thought was beautiful. At one point, Harry simply wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist as he was getting fucked. He dug his fingers into Draco’s back as he gasped out greedily, crying out for more. He shut his eyes tightly as his mind spiraled with colors. He felt as if he would explode with every thrust Draco took as they kissed again.
Now knowing that Draco was clearly upset and jealous of Harry’s sexual encounter, this truly made his day.
"Because I don't want to be with anyone who has the same unit as I do, I really do love the drinks here, and the music is out of this world!"
"Fine, but you're paying for those extra wings. Actually you're paying for everything, since I'm consoling your skinny, rich ass." She says trying not to laugh at his scowl.
"I want so many things. As stupid as this may sound, I want all types of hate to be over. I never thought that I would see the day where I would say this, but, I want quiet days and loving days. I want to have kids, eventually. I want to hold someone in my arms when he's depressed. As for Harry, I just love putting a smile on his face. I love when he hugs me from the back. I love that he gives me massages when I'm stressed or feeds me when I'm sick. I love holding him in my arms and feeling like it's me and him against the world. I love that he gives me something to believe in when I'm feeling down. I love how he can tell you or do things without actually saying the words ‘I love you’ on a regular basis. He’s just so… he’s amazing. His mind is beautiful."
"Bitch, don't kill my vibe." Neville says in a sing-song voice as he  flicked him off. "Now, go take those off so I can pay for them. We need to finish get you all dolled up for the surprise."
After Blaise left, Draco sat in silence, simply thinking about what Blaise said. He was so busy thinking that he missed when Harry came up to the table, kissing Tori's forehead.
themed party. At least we read the books together when they first came out. I was so bored of reading the
“That never works anymore.” Draco says with a pout on his face. “Anyway, what do you say to hanging out with Harry again?”
The answer to all of the questions that I asked myself had been one answer: Yes. It was an easy answer really because they've always pushed and supported me when I felt like giving up. They are the best support system that I could ever ask for, and I wouldn't trade that for anything in the world. Harry, you've always made me feel attractive and that's something that I thought I had a long time ago, but you've managed to change to change my perception on things. On top of all of that, spending time with anyone of you makes me feel so good because it feels like home.
"Draco why are you so down? I can feel all that sadness oozing out of you." Neville says, completely shocked.
however, I need to do this for me. I need to break this cycle of thinking that I will find one guy who will make me happy."
"Alright, Tori. We're going to do a little bit of exercising." Harry says picking up Tori, who was currently gurgling. "You're gonna have your own tummy time while I have my own time, ok?" He asks, kissing her forehead before placing her on her little, plump purple pillow.
Now that is something that I always admire about a person, no matter who they are. I will say that even though I was dishonest about that whole
"But why? Don't you think that Harry has bought me enough clothes? I mean, I appreciate the gesture, but I don't need you to waste your money on me either."
"Yup." Harry says as he takes the keys out of the engine, getting out of the car. He opened the door to the back of the car, grabbing a hold of the car seat that Victoria had been in. Draco took the car seat, attached it to the stroller and followed Harry up the couple of stairs. As soon as they stepped into Harry's house, Draco was in awe of what he saw.
My knight in shining armor, who was there for me when my past boyfriends couldn't be bothered with me. My Draco, who I wanted to comfort for the rest of my life when I was feeling down and cold. The same Draco, who made me stay up late at night for weeks, thinking about him and that kiss for hours on end because he gave me a very hot kiss back at his 26
and his touch is “very warm”. Draco tells his cousin. "You know what the worst part of the story is? He said that Inferno was even
"You weren't going tell me anything and you know it! Someone else told you to tell me! You know what you can do, Malfoy? Take your ass back down to this guy's house, since you have to have everybody's man! What the fuck do you think this is? So I guess you think you're cute now right? You’re a goddamn bitch. You should have kept your fucking mouth shut! Just because he gave you more attention than he gave me that night, you think you're something fucking special, Malfoy?! Fuck you and fuck him! God, I can't believe you! Just when I met a great guy, you- you know what? You aren't worth my time anymore."
All of a sudden, Harry moves his face towards Draco's hypnotized face. At this point, Draco and Harry's faces are inches away from each other, with Harry's hand inside of Draco's underwear, clutching the blonde's dick. When Harry finally realizes what happened, Draco breaks the silence.
Draco doesn't get to finish as Neville pushed him into the dressing room. Nearly nine outfits later, Neville almost fell asleep against the mannequin that he was leaning against when he heard the dressing room doors open.
"I’m gonna go hang out with Neville. It’s been a while since I’ve seen him and I really want to hang out with him to get more advice, this time from a young guy’s point of view." Draco says to Sirius. "I mean, I can’t really ask Harry, can I?"
"Yeah, yeah. Anyway, Harry thinks he's so in love that he thinks that this guy named Inferno, could finally be the one. I don't think that I'm going to exist to Harry anymore."
"Damn, this is going to be fun. You're probably going to miss the appetizer course at your dates house, by you'll be right on time for the main course and dessert." He remarks while taking of Flames’ shirt.
"Two." She repeats. "One whole box for you to eat tonight and a box for me that I'll start eating tonight and finish eating tomorrow.
“Draco.” Harry warned once he was getting close a few minutes later after Draco’s slow and sensual bobs.
"She was born July 26th at 2:47 in the afternoon. She loves to look at her reflection, snuggling, and sleeping."
“Please, hear me out!" Draco begged as he felt his heart breaking. "I know what I did was wrong, but I thought that I would tell you-“
"I can't do that to him. He'll think that I'm jealous and that I don't trust him at all." Draco says gloomily. “I’d never forgive myself if something bad ever happened to him. I mean, people only want to date him because of his last name! I just want what’s best for him, and support him, you know?"
"Of course I want you to stay. I have extra rooms and I want to make sure that you and little Victoria here that you are safe."
"Don't you know how much money that's gonna cost? A crib, changing station- it's just too much. I don't want you to spend anymore money on us."
"Exactly! Harry just wants to find his happy ever after. He just wants to be happy, and have someone to take care of and I just want him to be happy." Draco tells his friend with tears in his eyes.
"Draco, what are you trying to say? You’re hesitating about something." Harry notices. “Is everything alright?” And he hears Draco sigh.
The crazy part? Had we gotten our shit together, we could’ve been married for over a decade if he wasn’t a bed hopping man whore and me a person who’s to clingy, but whatever.
"Ronald, don't be so loud!" Hermione snapped rushing over to Tori. "She's only three months old, and she's not prepared to hear any hollering from you yet.
"In your dreams, Harry." Hermione says. "I'm in the mood for nachos. Hermione. what will you have to eat?"
"Harry, Harry, Harry." Draco starts. "These boys will help you find a man. Besides, that bar has four of my favorite things."
"There's my cookie buddy!" Ron exclaims, ignoring Hermione as he was rushing over towards Tori, who simply stares at him.
"I have to fix this tension that's between us. Maybe I can apologize and make things right with him." Draco tells his best friend, with a glimmer of hope in his voice as he walks towards the bathroom.
"It's pretty easy, especially since I wander around sometimes." Harry answered as Draco placed a kiss on Tori's head as he followed the other man to the bathroom. "Ok, time for bath time, Princess." Harry says excitedly.
He licks Harry’s nipples, Adam’s apple and when Harry is about to open his mouth so that Draco can lick into his mouth, Draco licks Harry’s lips before licking his nipples once more, causing Harry to pout a bit.
Meanwhile, Draco, 35, is hotter than ever. He is more broader, muscular and a doctor that has an awesome friend that he is happy to work with. Draco and his friend Ronald Weasley, are currently changing out of their scrubs just talking about their weekend plans as they do every single Friday.
"You're such a cutie-patootie." He says as he waves her toy in front of her. A moment later, he leans over to kiss her forehead before giving her the toy, then quickly went back to doing his push-ups.
Roughly forty minutes later after playing with Tori, Hermione comes with a muffin and places it in front of Draco. She takes the seat next to him and smiles him.
"Likewise." Draco said as he places several kisses on Tori's cheek. "I was born on June 5th 1980, this is my natural hair color, I love green apples, reading and creating looks."
Draco simply smiled because of course Tori would recognize him. Harry has been with her 24/7 and there wasn't a time where Harry wasn't holding her or playing with her.
At one point as Harry is riding him, Draco gently pulls Harry by his neck and kisses Harry like he’s the only thing that matters to him.
Harry was about to say something when he heard whining from the baby on the smaller couch across from them. He quickly gets up, getting ready to pick up the baby who was crying.
"Ah, finally something that I've done in a long time to turn you on. Score one for the blonde boy! Like what you see?" Draco taunts.
"Well, in that case, let’s not drink anything strong. Let's just drink Harry’s favorite brand of wine, juice and water. Is that ok with you?"
, the duo went to a bar a few blocks from the office. Hermione was talking to him about her case on a woman who had slapped a man because his dog ate her ring. Harry was simply listening to her and paying attention to her ramble on and on about the case. She also told Harry that she was dating a new man named Oliver Wood and that she felt good around him. When she finished talking about Oliver, she asked him about his love life and he told her that his boyfriend broke up with him.
He turns to the nightstand next to his bed, and pulls out a pink vibrating dildo that Draco gave him, which is his favorite, and a bottle of lube. He takes his underwear and tank top off and flings it to the other side of the room. After prepping himself for a few minutes, Harry then works the dildo within his ass and tries to find his prostate all while memorizing how Draco fucked him so well two days before. He pants, moans, sees starts, and clenches tightly around the toy pressed against his sweet spot.
"Yeah. It’s the best idea you’ve had in years when it comes to me finding a man." A cheerful Harry tells him off the bat.
"You're a cutie, baby girl. Such a cutie patootie. Yes you are. Yes you are." Harry cooed at her in a baby voice as she held onto his finger.
Draco called his parents, and let them know what he was out with Harry, Ron and his new friend Hermione, and that they wouldn't need to wait up, even though they live a few houses away from each other
"Sorry to break this to any of you, but there's nothing that anyone can say or do to make me stay here in California anymore. I'm officially done with this place!" Harry sobs. "I've had it with this place and frankly Draco, I've had it with you and your-" Draco shuts Harry up by giving him a kiss on his lips. Suddenly, Harry pushes Draco away from him, giving him an angry look.
"Well, it's a story that I will tell you when we hang out. Pete, I- oh, I have to go. I’ll call you later and let you in on the deets." Harry tells Draco, once he sees Inferno coming back into the living room.
"They're here." Harry said with a smile as the door opened, snapping Draco out of his thoughts. Draco took Tori from Harry and sat on the couch, kissing her forehead.
Draco lowered his head and gave Harry’s crack a quick lick. As Harry cried out, his asshole puckered at the contact.
"Just go over to his house and see if he's down to hang out with you. If I were in your position, I'd take some pizza and some beer and just hang out with him."
"Nope. This is way more fun. Besides, it must be my clingy date." He says as he is kissing Draco’s neck.
"Honestly though, these past few weeks have been great! The sex with Hermione is out of this world! I should have asked Harry introduce her to me a long time ago. Which reminds me, I need to ask him where I can get some handcuffs since you won’t tell me where you get both get them from."
"You're going to be a very good baby today, aren't you?" He asked his daughter, who simply smiled at him and kicked her legs.
“I mean, it wouldn't be the end of the world of you and Harry did go though with your little contract would it? What is your best bet on how Harry ended his night after your escapade?”
"Actually, he's never seen the movies at all. Since his birthday is about two months from now, we're going to have a
"Okay. I hope he has some sort of information or something." Draco says to her as he tries not to break down and cry.
Draco leaned forward an he started to kiss Harry’s back and when Harry lifted his head, the blonde slightly turned Harry’s head and kissed him passionately.
"Just head to my room while I wake these two up." Harry told Draco. "Are you going to stay the night, Neville?"
"Hey!" Hermione says, standing outside the car on the passenger’s side. "Where are you two coming from?"
Ron smiles at her. "Okay, come on." He hesitates for a second but then grabs Hermione's hand leading her to the restaurant.
when you knew that you were lying to my face the whole entire time, after you hooked up with Flash?! You're a fucking man whore, Malfoy!” Harry spits out. “You will never know shit about being in a monogamous relationship! Why? Because
"To finality and closure." Harry says, lifting his glass. "To useless men and women who are out of our lives and gone forever!" He says with a smile on his face.
"Let's just say that you did harbor some feelings for Harry, and you had to describe how you feel about him, what would you say?" Neville asks him.
"You're a lying  piece of shit, Draco. I know this has something to do with Harry because anything concerning Harry always makes you anxious or sad. Right now you don't look anxious about anything, so you're sad about something." Ron says.
"I know that because according to Harry, you're prettier than Ken." Neville says as he hands him a shirt and a pair of jeans. "Try these on."
“Great.” Draco says, pulling down Harry’s pants and taking off his socks. He pulls Harry by his boxer briefs, bending him over the couch. Then he proceeds to remove his own pants and underwear, takes off his socks, before literally ripping Harry’s underwear off.
"Yes. I finally admit defeat and agree that even I need someone in my life. I don’t know if you’re going to believe me when I say this, but I'm happy you're that person." Draco says with a bright smile on his face.
"Oh well. Deal with it. And I know that you don't want to see me right now either, but I don't care about that at all." Ron started. "Since I'm your only friend right now and at work, I'm here to tell you that you're going to have to move on eventually."
"It wasn't my fault that you were sleeping like the dead." Harry said. "I tried to wake you up, but you were totally knocked out."
"Thank you." Draco said as he smiled before he walked over to Tori. "Princess, I'm going out with Harry for a few hours. I'm going to miss you so much."  After he finished talking to her, Tori simply smiled at him as she cooed.
"Those crazy kids. I hope he catches up to Harry." Ms. Figg says to herself and she walks away from Harry’s house.
"So, what did you think of Harry's story?" Hermione asks Ron an hour later as they are simply wrapped up in one another twenty minutes later. "Isn't it sweet that he's putting himself out there? I mean, just by hearing his story, I get the feeling that he's been burned by so many guys before."
"From what Draco has told me, that is definitely true. Harry has had lots of bad luck trying to find
"Newsflash, Draco: It didn't change anything at all! I really don't want to play this stupid game anymore. I don't want to play this game of cat and mouse with you anymore either. Look, I have to do what's best for me right now, and that's getting away from New York and living my life on my own terms without any distractions or problems."
Hermione Jean Granger was the first person that Harry met at the law firm where they first interned- now work at. At first, she was taken aback by his charming looks, friendly demeanor and the fact that he was almost always right based on his instincts was something that she found highly attractive. What she liked about Harry was the fact that he wasn’t like every other man who would approach her acting “macho” and that he didn’t treat her like an object to prize that was meant to be won.
"I'm not wasting money, Draco. I swear that I'm not cocky, but I have a lot of money. Millions to be exact, but I don't think it'll cost me that much."
As Draco was rushing to the Harry’s office, he thought back to his younger days before his relationship with Harry.
“So I can see you get off on me.” He simply says. Harry starts stroking Draco in time with his thrusts in a perfect rhythm, until Draco moans, heavily.
“No buts, Malfoy! I know what kind of person Harry is, alright? I know that he’s hurt and that no amount of apologies can fix this, but you have got to do something. Man up and admit that you miss him. Make it right!”
"You shouldn't have been the one to apologize. He should be to one to do that for cheating on the both of you."
"Thanks buddy. See you soon." Harry tells him before disconnecting the call so that he can dry off and put some clothes on.
"Princesses don't cry." Draco says as he picks up gently, before he wraps her tightly with the towel and rocks her.
Harry smiles triumphantly as that is one step closer to being with Draco. Now, Harry knows that even though they met, he has to fulfill the goal of getting Draco to let him in so that he can take care of him and Tori.
"Sure." Neville responded as Draco took Tori's bag and made his way to Harry's room. Now, Draco has never slept in Harry's room as he usually slept in one of the other rooms that was available. When he finally got to Harry's room, he put the bag down on the bed, and laid Tori down and changed diaper and into PJs. He chose the onesie with little hearts and stars on it. Draco then noticed that his daughter was yawning and fisting her eyes.
A smell that just makes you miss home, even if your home didn't smell this way. The place has a rustic design to it and a homey mood, it's dimly lit with candles on each table. It's not full packed but there are still a lot of people in the seats as Hermione looks around. A girl with wavy blonde hair and high cheek bones, who Hermione assumes is the receptionist, because of her uniform and all, approaches them with a smile.
"What's going on, Potter?" Draco says, rubbing at his eyes as he saw his baby girl on her pillow, cooing loudly at her toy.
After about 10 minutes in the bathroom, Harry goes to his bedroom to get changed. Before he can dry off, he hears his phone vibrate. He looks at his phone and sees that he has received a text message.
"Thank you." Harry said as he pulled out Draco's chair, pushing it in gently once Draco sat, before he sat back down in this own.
"Come on you guys. Let's get out of here. If we stay here too long, these two will rot our teeth! I believe they have some things to discuss with one another." Ron jokes.
He’s fucked his best friend on occasion, but something about fucking a depressed Harry always made him complete.
. After they've eaten their food, they decide to put the dirty dishes in the sink, they move into Harry's living room with the cake and wine. As Draco was opening the bottle of wine, Harry turned to the TV and the DVD player, trying to pick which movie they were going to watch.
"See, had you met up with this.... stranger before, like Harry asked you to several times before, this wouldn't have happened." Ron stated. "With that being said, I would have told him."
"No. It's just....I rarely ever you look tired from a long day at the hospital. Damn, baby, you look good!" Harry says, salivating over this man in his mind.
"And he told me to relax. I had told him that I had never done anything like that before, so I asked him for a drink, just to calm my nerves. When he went into his kitchen to make me a drink, I called Draco. When I told Draco that I was with a hot guy, he started freaking out. Just as I was going to explain the situation, I hung up from Draco because Inferno came back with my drink. Anyway, he gave me
Harry can only smile at that statement because it was true. He was extremely happy that he was doing something with Inferno, and he was happy that Hermione was seeing Ron. Now, as much as he was very happy that Hermione and Ron were now dating, he was certain that she was craving more gossip about him and Inferno. They were almost one in the same in that aspect whenever one of them would find someone to date. He turns to his computer and shows Hermione a picture of Inferno that’s currently on his background.
"Morning!" Harry chirped, making Draco want to smack and kiss the man at the same time. "Are you alright?
"Hey, I'm not stopping you from finding it. I'm just happy being from one bed to he next, hooking up with a hot guy." Draco says happily.
“Must we go through a sea of emotions, Potter?” Draco teases as he notices his best friend tearing up. “It’s just a picture in a fancy frame.”
Harry continues to writhe as Draco bobs his head up and down in a slow manner. He swore that he would just die from getting his dick sucked by the man that he loved so much. What took Harry out for a moment was the fact that Draco looked at him as he was bobbing his head up and down all while running his right hand all over his chest. When Draco finally pulled away, he got back on top of Harry and went back to passionately kissing Harry as if his life depended on it. They kissed for a good minute or two, Draco inserted his hard, leaking cock inside of Harry.
"Fine. I'm just a little sad that I haven't been able to hang out with Harry. Worst of all, his birthday is coming up, and I have no idea if he remembers that I planned out his birthday sleep over." Draco tells his friends.
"Well actually, there is another thing. Someone’s been getting a lot of smack-down, scream all night, bed-breaking, neighbor-banging-on-the-wall type of sex."
Throughout the whole ride from the coffee shop to Harry's house, Draco had glanced from the window to his daughter several times.
"Not that, you dumb fuck! The pity party of the year that you're having! It's been going on for way too long now!"
"Well, you wouldn't mind if we got together and get to know him. I'll see if he's good enough for you or if he can leave. Are you happy with that?"
Harry wipes his lips as Draco takes a deep breath. They lean in and one second later, Draco pulled away.
He looks around the barren living room, thinking of all the good times that he’s had in this house. A few minutes later he starts walking around the house with a drink in his hand. While walking around his home, he comes across a picture that he was fond of. The picture is the same picture that he recieved on his 25
Harry grabbed a cup of coffee, sat at a table and took out his phone. Now, if Harry was being honest with himself, he had a gut feeling that something was going to happen today. If there was anything that he could be sure of, it was to trust his gut feeling and his gut was telling him that something good was going to happen to him. Just as he had his fourth sip of coffee and sent a text to his friend Luna, the door opened. As Harry looked up, he saw a tall man with wet blonde hair plastered on his forehead, soaking wet clothes and holding onto a stroller, causing Harry to rush over to him.
"Draco!" Harry shouts when he comes undone a few minutes later on his torso. After he's done, he notices that he is still so hard, so he decides to turn on the vibrator which instantly starts vibrating against his prostate, making him moan out in complete bliss as he is still fantasizing that Draco is currently fucking into him at the moment.
Harry smiles as he picked up the stuffed animal, slightly dusting it off. He looked up when the doorbell went off, wondering who it could be. He placed the teddy bear back on the couch before he walked towards the door. He then rubbed his eyes a little before he opened the door.
"Harry, are you fucking kidding me? I have something really important to say, so could you please stop? Please?" Draco begs him.
"What if you and Draco are actual soulmates? I mean, you two are practically inseparable. What is taking so long?"
"I'm sorry guys, but this contract isn't legally binding until Harry's 35th birthday, which is tomorrow."
Harry simply shook his head before he chuckled. As they stepped into the living room, they found Ron spread out on the floor with a big bag of Lays on his chest and fork with half a sausage on it. Blaise was currently on the couch cuddling with a throw pillow, laughing randomly in his sleep. Before Draco could ask what happened, Neville came out of the kitchen with Tori in his arms cooing at the baby who was eating.
Harry cries in pleasure, when Draco starts stroking Harry’s cock. It doesn’t take long for Harry to spill cum in Draco’s hand and on his stomach. A few moments later, Harry is clenching around Draco. “I’m gonna-”
The string of bad luck with men cheating on him, or leaving him had truly taken a toll on him, and it wasn't fun being alone. On one hand, he knew that Draco would blame him for being too clingy, and on the other hand, he knew that Draco would always defend him ad cheer him up. With that in mind, he made his way over to the blonde's house to have this conversation with his
"Well, we went a couple rounds. Ok, six to be exact. When I woke up, it was well past 11:10 this morning and Inferno needed to leave because he had to take his Art History exam. After that, he was going to his Karate class, so I decided to come here, and do something good with myself, after a long night of frolicking." Harry said.
Draco looked down at his daughter who was currently staring back at him. He smiles brightly at her as her lips were starting to curl into a smile when she looked at Harry. At that moment in time, he knew that Harry was correct.
"I might be overreacting, but is your name Inferno?" Draco asks, hoping it truly isn’t Inferno he’s talking to.
“Oh, don’t cry my little munchkin. You’re too pretty to cry.” Draco said as he was sliding Tori’s yellow sweater on her arms as she was wailing. “You look pretty, my baby girl.” Draco said as he was kissing her little button nose. “You’re my little princess, right? Aren’t you my little princess?”
At that point, Draco looked sleepily over at the side where Harry was playing with is daughter with his heart fluttering, watching as Harry pressed a kiss onto Victoria's hand. Goyle never did that, and it pissed Draco off because Goyle treated her as if she were the plague. It was nice that someone else made Victoria smile.
"One again Harry James Potter, you are correct." Draco responded, as they all sit at the booth the host has taken them to.
Draco shook his head fondly. Harry was doing the most right now, but he wasn't sure how to repay him at all.
Harry withdraws his fingers and lowers himself down to lick open Draco's stretched hole, just because he can, really. He pushes his tongue in to lube it up more and enjoys the way Draco's tight muscles feel around him. He pulls up after a moment and climbs up to align his aching cock at Draco's entrance, resting his cock between Draco's cheeks as the head of his cock lies right above Draco's hole, desperate to slide in. Harry takes one long look at Draco's sleeping form, noting how peaceful he looks all flushed out with a blissful smile on his lips, and pushes in, not stopping until he's buried balls deep inside his boyfriend.
"I would, but I don't think you'd want to eat burned bell peppers." Harry says rushing off to the kitchen.
"Sorry. It's just- I've never done anything like this before. I don’t really know what to do at all." Harry admitted in a shy voice.
Both men are fighting for dominance, but Draco decides to let Harry take the lead as it is his birthday.
"So I'm gonna get a well done steak with steamed vegetables and rice. What are you going to get?" Harry asked.
"Since I started to look for a man." Harry laughs. "I guess the cognac wasn't going to help either since I soaked the strawberries in it."
"I feel like I should be a piece of meat for her to take full advantage of." Ron says. "How awesome would that be?!"
A week later, Draco and Ron are in the gym, working out like crazy on their day off from the hospital.
"He's not poor or anything, but I just didn't want them to be alone. He needed an extra hand and I wanted to be that person to give it to him. I really like him and his daughter means the world to me."
"Aww, Harry! Soon it'll be time for you and Draco to be a couple. Just 5 more months to go! I don't know about you, but I'm definitely excited for that!" Hermione squealed a couple of weeks later when she popped up in his office.
"I swear, what is the point of Ron having a key?" Harry asks himself as he rolls his eyes. "He's worse than Neville."
At this moment, Harry realized something. He realized that for the first time in a long time, Draco was afraid that someone that he cared about was in trouble, which made Harry smile to himself.
"Friend of the owners." Ron smiles, "it's been a while since I went there, I know the chefs there so we're in good hands."
Later on in the morning, around 10:45, Hermione decides to visit Harry at his office. When she gets to Harry's desk, she noticed that the desk is still empty.
"Forget that! I'm happy that I didn't have to pay because I didn't have enough money at all. All I have in my wallet is $8.62, three credit cards, my driver’s license and my tap card." He says with a small smile on his face.
." Harry said before putting the first movie into the DVD player. As soon as he pressed play, he walked right over and sat right next to Harry.
Harry's breath almost hitched as cool grey eyes met his own green eyes and if Harry was honest with himself, they were beautiful.
"Oh please, Draco." Harry snorts. "I know for a fact that you aren't capable of having a working relationship at all and-"
"I promise that I won't yell anymore." Ron said, but the moment he turned, he saw a little spider crawling on the walk and he shrieked loudly causing Tori to cry again. At that moment, Hermione pulled Tori into the kitchen as Draco glared at the red haired man.
"Oh, you know your mum would say the same thing!" Dean laughs as he pours each of them a glass, takes their order and walks away.
After a long day at the office, Harry finally got home at 8 pm, dead tired from all the cases he had taken care of for the past week.
As he is walking towards Hermione, he is stopped several times by different men asking him if he remembers their hookups, which irritates him. In his opinion, they are wasting his time because he wants to get to Harry, now.
"Awesome." She says hugging him. "So how will you tell Draco the rest of the story after he finds out that you're leaving?" She asks him, pulling away from the hug.
"That's my baby." He encouraged, making her move her tiny little hands before laying her back on his chest and tickled her stomach, causing her to squeal.
"Damn you for snooping on my laptop." Harry said before sitting next to Draco. "Anyway, I was also thinking that Tori can have her own room."
"Oh yeah!" She moans loudly as he starts to go deeper and deeper inside of her. He thrusts harder and harder, but keeps a slow steady pace. She starts crying tears of joy and tells him, "Oh Ron, I love this! Give it to me! Harder!" She cries and he flips their position so that he is on his back on the bed.
“Here we go.” He tells himself, walking through the door. After about a minute or so, he immediately spots Harry sitting at the bar.
"That's good with me, and hopefully I'll get to kiss you the same way you want to kiss me very soon."
at all since he was out the picture. As long as he was in Harry's company again, he was content about how things were going.
"You tell me." Harry tiredly says. "Like I said, I need to break this cycle of thinking that I will find one guy who will make me happy. I am not going to depend on Prince Charming to come and save me when I can do it myself."
"It's alright." Draco promised. "I actually want to kiss you really badly myself, but I'm trying not to break into beast mode."
Any journey with you makes me happy to live, and no one has ever shown me how to be…..well, Draco. Every little thing I do, you’re on my mind. It’s as though you are able to see right into my soul, as if I were a canvas or something. You’re more than just my lover. You’re my best friend and even though we’ve known each other for the longest time, you’re still so complex and interesting in ways that I could not have imagined. And I don’t care what you think right now about my statements, but we’re gonna be together forever.
"Are you absolutely sure that you don't want something to eat? You should at least take a nap." Ron kindly offers while Draco parks Ron's car in the driveway.
"Thank you. Well, now that our search for Harry is over, I have to go home and sleep for this procedure that Ron and I have tonight.” Draco says. “Can we talk about this later when we have the time to hang out again?”
Draco continues to kiss down Harry’s body, stopping at the bulge in Harry’s briefs, to kiss it relentlessly.
Here's Draco's Realization, Y'all!! So, This Chapter Is A Dream Sequence Y'all. Bear With Me Cause I Think It's A Bit... Predictable.
"No, Draco. You literally just missed him. Harry just left about a minute ago." Hermione says shaking her head.
"You're a successful lawyer with money in the bank and you didn't have enough cash on you?" Hermione asks, taken off guard by his statement.
"Oh don't worry, Harry. We're going to be awesome." Neville says as he and Blaise plop on the couch.
"Babe, it's fine." Harry reassured him. "I like to spoil Tori because she deserves it, and maybe if you want, I can spoil you too?"
“What have we been doing for the past 10 years of our life? I may not be your ideal Prince Charming Harry, but you know that I would slay a dragon for you." Draco tells him.
Inferno resumes kissing Draco. After the third ring, Draco says "I think you should get that because it's fucking with my thoughts and it's distracting us from going all the way."
Draco nods as he places Victoria's  blanket on the comfy couch, laying her across it. He adjusted her headband, smiling softly at her. He then took a look around the living room simply taking everything in, and so far, nothing bad happened yet.
"Hey, Tori. What's wrong?" He asks quietly as he holds the crying baby securely before sitting next to Draco on the other couch.
"You don't know me! You can't possibly tell me all of this and get over it so fast. Harry told me that the party was his going away party. The one that I didn't even know about. I guess it's just better if he just leaves and create happiness on his on terms."
“I just wanted to thank you for being the perfect boyfriend.” Harry says. “To many more date together.”
"Why are you all doing this to me, on a day like this?" Harry demands, trying to keep his tears at bay. "Why?" He demands.
I have to admit, when he brought up the idea of making a contract, I thought that he was crazy. I mean, I thought that he was simply joking about being a couple at the age of 35 and that he was willing to be tied down to someone.
"I'm just shocked, that's all. It's like he was telling us that he finally found somebody who could be the one! I mean, isn’t that just a tad bit crazy? Cause if you ask me, I find that highly ridiculous."
And with that, Harry went to the restroom as Draco watched him leave, cradling Tori protectively in his arms.
"Hermione, thank you for inviting me. I'm honored to be here!" Draco says with a smile on his face. "It's good to see you again."
"Because everyone deserves someone, even if they don't believe in that concept. Even if they are scared of it, they'll never know who they deserve as a soulmate if they don't take the chance. But enough about that. Where's your future husband? It's weird not seeing Harry here with you at all."
"I guess we both agree on something." Harry says in a hard voice, indicating that he's finished with their conversation.
“It’s going great!” Harry responds. “I really think that Justin is the one, but I am nervous to propose to him.”
“Yes.” Harry moaned as Draco placed his forehead on Harry’s forehead, looking into his eyes. They continued to kiss as Draco kept up his thrusts for a good while.
Ten years of me trying too hard to impress men or people using me or cheating on me left, right and center was really....it was horrible. The best part of all the heartaches was the fact that my best friend was with me to help me pick up the broken pieces of my heart up from the grass.
"Ron!" She exclaims. "How are you?" She pulls Ron into a hug, which obviously, makes Hermione have to let go of his hand. "And who is this? Well, I'll be, you've finally found someone to put up with your smelly self?"
"Oh, that was a world away." He says, sitting on the couch, touching the broken glass. "Here's to you, Harry." Draco says, opening the wine bottle, lifting it up in the air. "I hope you find love and happiness, wherever you go in life." Draco takes a long drink from the bottle, before he passes out.
"It's not my fault that I'm hot. I can't help that my looks are so cute, especially my mother's eyes." Harry said as he kept his attention on Tori.
“Alright.” Harry says, while hanging up his phone. “Dinner is done, dessert is cooling down, the wine is getting chilled, the place is clean, and the setting is perfect, if I say so myself.” Harry tells himself. “I’m going to take a shower and get dressed.”
"Well, I don’t need a visual of you and Hermione in my head for the rest of my life, but congrats to you."
Luckily for Harry, he knew that Draco never locked his front door, so he turned the knob and let himself in. He entered the apartment and started to look for his friend. He wasn't in the living room, kitchen, or the bathroom. He finally checks the main bedroom.
"Well, we can't be a hundred percent sure, but from the sound of Draco's story, it seems like Harry is missing. I even called Harry’s house and his cell, but he isn't answering at all. He missed a meeting this morning."
"You grabbed my chin and - Don't blame this on me. I said a peck not a full make out session with my daughter is on the floor."
"Isn't.... Don't you think that getting a crib and a whole room for Tori mean something? What does that mean to you, Potter?"
"It's too late for anything at this point. Let's just go back home. I'm tired and very depressed at the moment. Besides, we wouldn't want you to be gone from Hermione for too long. She might get the wrong idea about what's happening between us." Draco tells him.
"Of course you would bring me to a gay bar." Ron says as he's looking around the place, nursing his beer. "I should have known."
"That sounds awesome, but I don't really feel like being around anyone else today." Draco tells her ruefully
"It's just that these clothes cost you a lot of money. Plus all the other things you bought at Target.... it's just too much."
"Oh, stop it. Stop it!" Hermione gushed as she smiled at Tori who continued smile at Hermione as Draco out A pacifier in Tori's mouth.
"As I was saying, tonight will be the best date of your lives, hosted by yours truly." Justin says as he motions to himself. "Now, what would you like to drink? Will white wine do?"
"Well, while you two argue, Hermione and I are going to walk around and then enjoy the night at my place. See ya later boys."
"Thank you." Draco said as he smiled unsurely. "I don't think I'm good at it though. I mean, I want to give her the world, but I know that's impossible since there are limits, you know?"
Harry Potter that people are afraid of in court." Draco tells him before giving him a small kiss on his lips. "I would never forgive myself if something ever happened to you!" He says with a tear rolling down his cheek.
He carries her to the bed and proceeds to kiss almost every inch of her body. As he gets to her clitoris, Ron looks up at her.
They start to move together, causing their leaking cocks to rub against each other as they continue to kiss.
Harry was suspicious by Draco's tone. On one hand, he was wondering if the blonde was trying to weasel his way out of the contract, and on the other, this plan could help him get out of his comfort zone. Their contract was going to be up very soon, which would make them a couple that everyone, and literally everyone, was root for. Hell, even Harry was rooting for it.
"Harry loves that episode!" Draco says, getting up from the couch. "I've got to try and forget Harry. For some reason, I can't get him out of my mind." Draco sighs. "I blew it- I really blew it. I took him for granted."
"What? That made my day! Do you think he actually got screwed against Inferno’s bedroom wall?" Sirius says while wagging his eyebrows.
“You know, I still have some clothes here, so I think it’s best that I get ready here. Go-Go Bar, here we come."
Victoria smiles at him and in that moment, Harry's heart swells in a way that he's never felt before. He instantly has this urge to protect her at all times.
"I know you can, Harry, but I don't want you to get hurt. I just want you to know that I'll always be here for you and I know you're making the right decisions for yourself."
"It's time for bed, my little princess. You're past your curfew." Draco joked as he grabbed her pacifier.
"That's crazy, Malfoy. You need someone to take care of you." Harry responds after pulling away from the kiss.
Draco is clearly enjoying it in his sleep, and is now murmuring dirty nothings of contentment. His hands have found their way to Harry's hair on their own accord, tugging them roughly before gently pushing him downward.
At first, Harry thought that it felt so wrong to be taken in this fashion. Draco’s tongue fucked his hole like a cock, fast and wet. Harry tensed at the sensations. "No," Harry murmured, as he threw his head back. "Stop."
"Damn, you've really thought about my contract with Draco haven't you?"  Harry asked, amused by his friend's statement. "Plus, what makes you think that I want children?"
"See, had you met up with this.... stranger before, like Harry asked you to several times before, this wouldn't have happened." Ron stated. "With that being said, I would have told him."
Draco is fiddling with the shirt that he's wearing, compliments of Harry as his daughter is being pushed by Harry. At least he's wearing his own pants because Harry's pants were a tad bit to short on him. Now on the other hand, Draco was checking out Harry.
"Very descriptive, but very delicious for a drink. You're lucky I drink a bit, so I don't need to ask what a '
"My pleasure." Harry said. "Since the others are staying over tonight, we're probably going to watch a movie or some tv. Care to join us?"
He's accepted the fact the Draco belongs to someone else, and he's fine with it. He just wonders when Draco will see it.
Ron smiles at her. "Well, you told me you didn't like fancy restaurants and the typical date thing." He starts, "I'm trying to make a good impression here, and I agree with you so we're going to an old restaurant that serves the best homemade stuff, ever."
"It's nothing I can't handle, so don't worry about it, pretty boy." Harry says. Draco smiles as he nods, and he picks up the menu looking at the high priced meals. He decided to find the cheapest meals so that Harry wouldn't have to pay for a big meal.
nobody needs a man like you! You’ve fucked around for years, and now you’ve fucked my motherfucking man? Screwed all the gay men like ourselves? I’m surprised that you aren’t a goddamn escort.”
“Well, what is it to you that he has a hickey? Ron asks as Hermione is trying not to laugh as Draco’s expression.
When Draco got there about fifteen minutes later, he spotted Harry. Harry was wallowing and singing one of Draco’s favorite song to himself.
"Hey, Har-bear! Shouldn't you be sleeping?" Draco asked Harry. “I mean, I remember you telling me about a client meeting taking place tomorrow, so….”
"She's fine. It was just a little sneeze." Draco says, laughing a little bit. He sits his daughter up and she's looking around the room.
Harry makes a face as he gently gives Tori the stuffed animal, watching her as she put the paw in her mouth.
Harry is surprised. “Maybe he had a family emergency.” He says to himself, knowing that the unexpected can happen. He gets another message.
"What makes you think I can't pay attention to four movies in a row, in the course of one night?" Harry asks playfully.
"Not since last night after your double date. He did call last night, but I honestly can't remember what it was about because I have a terrible flu. Anyway, what’s with Harry?”
"Harry James Potter, where the hell have you been?!" An annoyed Hermione demanded when Harry finally stepped into his office at 11:52. "I've been calling you all morn because you missed your meeting! I even had to call Draco to see if he knew where you were!"
“You got it.” Luna says as she writes the order down on her notepad. “You two make a lovely married couple.
Harry closes his eyes as he pulls up, then promptly slides his lips back down, stretching his lips apart as Draco's width increases towards the base of his cock. He repeats the motions vigorously, using his tongue to trail along the underside vein or the lips of the head with each movement.
Tori's head lifted a bit before she resting her head on his chest once more as she was sucking on her pacifier.
"Sure. And I flew to DC and met with Olivia Pope and Fitz where they were talking about moving to Vermont and making jam." She responds, still annoyed at her friend. "Now, where were you?"
for the past few weeks and we don't really talk or see each other anymore. He has totally forgotten about me." Draco tells him while trying to hold back his tears.
After he finished cleaning himself off, he simply lied in bed not even bothering to put his underwear back on.
Hermione smiles and clinks their glasses together. "To new beginnings." She sips a bit of the wine and is surprised at how good it tastes. "Hmmm, this is good."
"Sure. Death by wine, here we come. I'll swing by and be there in about 10 minutes." Draco tells him with a huge smile on his face.
"Meeting or not, I'm happy that you're in a good place, and that you're finally taking a chance on love again, Harry, even if it’s temporary." Ron said with a smile on his face.
"Because everyone deserves someone, even if they don't believe in that concept. Even if they are scared of it, they'll never know who they deserve as a soulmate if they don't take the chance. But enough about that. Where's your future husband? It's weird not seeing Harry here with you at all."
“Just ask the damn favor.” Ron says noticing Draco’s pleading look on his face as they are at their lockers grabbing their belongings.
"Oh well. At least that's an upside." She says walking towards the couch with the pizza and wings. "Well, Potter, we have pizza, wings, wine, salted caramel ice cream and cheesy ass movies." Hermione says while Harry opens up the bottle.
"Would you like Scotch or Whiskey, Draco?" Neville asks as he pulls out a bag of liquor from his bag.
Draco is lying down on his bed under his covers. He turns to his end table to grab his phone and dials a number that he's engraved in his head.
"Yeah. I know about it. Anyway I'm starved. Do you have anything in the fridge for a sandwich?" Ron asked Hermione.
"I was just trying to cheer him up!” Draco says defending his actions. “Harry broke up with his latest boyfriend. I would think that anyone would want to be cheered up after breaking up with someone."
"I think the better I should ask you should be this: Do you think it's crazy that two people who wrote a promissory note to each other a decade ago, who actually care for one another, would actually be in a committed relationship?"
“He left about two hours ago. After his last batch of errands, he was going to make his way over to the airport.”
"How will Harry ever know that he's wonderful? Gosh, I'm so stupid." He says, running his hand through his hair.
Harry digs through the bag and pulls up a picture of the two of them in college. In the picture, a cake covered Harry and a pristine Draco are standing with their backs together, making goofy faces at the camera.
"Awesome. I can't wait to see that movie. I’ve been dying to watch it!" Draco says as he sounds like a little boy.
, so I don't know what to say about this one. I guess I should start off with something that I admire about you. You, my love, are so bright that you can take anyone down, without burning everything down to the ground. It's so beautiful to me because you're the person that knows about so much, but you're honest enough to say that you don't know everything. I also appreciate that you don’t brag about what you know or claim to know it all, which a lot of people fail to practice. You're always caught up in what is happening in our broken society, and I think it makes you the best humanitarian in New York. It’s just mesmerizing that you are able to use your resources to help those who are less fortunate and knows that it takes more than one person to help our broken world a better place. Whether it consists of charities to the AIDS foundation, Cancer, homeless….you know that it takes a village to learn about these causes and that they need a lot of work from our people. An educated man like you, it's so sexy and I always admire your knowledge.
They go at it for a few minutes completely lost in their own world. This kiss was…different from all the other kisses that Harry experienced from Draco, and little did he know, Draco was thinking the exact same thing. As they continued to kiss deeply for the first time in so long, there was no fight for dominance at all. Harry allowed him to take control when Draco tried for it, and easily gave it back when Harry allowed him to. It was comfortable.
"You, Harry James Potter, are two minutes away from being a thirteen-year old girl who’s crushing on the football jock at school." Hermione tells him as she examines the picture. "I will say though, he’s hot. He’s a tall, dark skinned boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes. He looks good in that silver vest. Just look at his abs!"
Harry decides to shave a little bit, before hopping in the shower hot shower that he had going. In the shower, he sings one of his favorite Cheap Tricks songs.
"I've got it." Harry said as he took the things and went off with Tori. "Hey, cutie pie." He said kissing her cheeks, causing her to move her fist excitedly. He laughs a bit as he began to change her. If he was being honest with himself, Harry was getting attached to Tori. He loved her so much and loves to see her smiling and laughing that he never wanted to let go of that bond with her.
"How can you make a decision like this and not tell me?" Draco quietly asks as his tears are falling.
"Care for me or Tori at all. It's just....different, you know? At first, I thought that it was weird that Harry showed me that he cared. I wasn't used to it before, and now, I don't want it to end. Harry makes me feel nice."
Draco whimpers as they are kissing because he enjoys Harry’s touch that is currently tingling through his body. He enjoys Harry running his hands all over his torso, arms and the soft touch on his neck.
I'd tell you about money, but I don't think you'd care much babe. I guess all I have to say on the matter is to save up for a rainy day because anything can happen.
