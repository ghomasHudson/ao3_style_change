Harry stayed still, his breaths unsteady as Draco’s cock rubbed against his cunt again. “Please,” he said quietly, trying to decide what he wanted more — for Draco to touch Harry’s dick or to fuck him. It was an easy choice, it always was, even if Harry’s answer wasn’t in
“Yes,” Harry moaned, in spite of himself, unconsciously trying to move to rub his dick against Draco’s, “please.”
Draco lay back against the headboard, at enough of an angle to be able to look right into Harry’s eyes when Harry went down on him, but still sitting up enough for it to be clear who held the reins. Draco spread his legs and pulled Harry between them; Harry felt sudden pressure on the back of his neck as Draco lightly jerked on his leash, and Draco drew him in so that Harry was on all fours over him, their faces at a similar height. Harry didn’t know what he was allowed to do, and he couldn’t do much for himself — his jaws were, humiliatingly, propped wide by the ring gag, and he couldn’t even ask to touch his dick because of how his mouth was held open. Draco kept the leash loose in his fist, but tautened it, keeping Harry from moving away at all, and he brought a hand up to Harry’s mouth.
He lost track of time after that, happy to just be gently used, but it couldn’t have been longer than five more minutes before Draco was guiding him off his cock and coaxing him to sit up.
Because Harry’s was a small, useless clit. “You’re too desperate to be filled up and used. You need someone else in control, baby. My cute little whore.”
And that was years ago. It was somewhat often, even still, that Harry came across another turn-on he had. They ranged from minor to large-scale, and it often took him some time to work up the courage to tell Draco. Certain things, like Harry’s possessiveness kink, to use that example, Draco had happened upon by accident. Sometimes
And suddenly Draco licked hard over his dick, and Harry let out a shout, his hips moving of their own accord to try to get more of this man’s
weak enough to ensure that Harry couldn’t cum from this alone. He was certain that was intentional — Draco wouldn’t have wanted Harry to be able to cum
Harry hissed through his teeth when his knees hit the rough carpet, and he barely had any time to complain about the change in position before he felt Draco’s wet cock brush his lips. He could feel cum dripping out of him and onto the carpet.
“Maybe I won’t even let you cum,” Draco continued. “I’ll just pin you down and take you until you’re dripping with my cum. Toys like you don’t need to feel good, you’re only here to please me.
But Harry never knew how to bring up something new like the collar, or especially his craving to try puppy play; do you say it in the midst of post-coital snuggling? bring it up casually over dinner? and when? where? how?
Harry groaned again and bared his neck as Draco finished marking him. “No, sir,” he muttered. Harry knew that he would never choose to use magic to cover up the marks Draco gave him, and Draco did too, which was why he occasionally inflicted them on Harry in order to claim him, knowing that they’d stay until they faded.
Harry groaned and dropped his forehead to Draco’s shoulder. He wanted to touch himself so badly, but knew better than to ask. He knew that he couldn’t cum just from getting fucked, no matter the hole — he needed stimulation on his dick — and it was awful to know that Draco might not let him touch himself. Yet it somehow made everything better: to think that Draco only cared about his own pleasure made Harry even more turned on.
Harry felt Draco’s chest rest against his upper back; Draco briefly put his full weight on Harry as he felt for the leash, which, though still fused to Harry’s collar, had laid forgotten on the bed as the two men had become occupied with more interesting matters. But now, Draco grabbed it and wound it around his palm so that it was quite short, and re-rested his hand by Harry’s head in order to keep his weight up. Harry now couldn’t lift his head if he’d wanted to — not more than a few inches off the bed, anyway — and he was already becoming more flustered by his spit dripping out the side of his mouth and onto the sheets. He moaned through the gag as Draco kept fucking him.
The kiss was intoxicating: Draco dominated it, unsurprisingly, starting slowly before beginning to kiss Harry with more greed and vigor. Harry felt vulnerable — in these moments, his soul always opened wide and let Draco in, and that was how their sex worked so well.
Harry shuddered, and, closing his eyes, leaned forward; he groaned when he felt Draco’s hand gently guide him onto his cock. Harry began on just the upper half of the shaft, hollowing his cheeks and letting his tongue wander to slicken up the cock in his mouth. He barely had to take extra care to cover his teeth: it was reflexive, at this point, with all the time he’d spent on his knees for Draco (and, only on a few rare occasions, other men. Draco wasn’t too fond of sharing). Harry began slowly bobbing his head, letting his saliva lubricate Draco’s cock, and he leaned further to take more into his mouth. He loved the sensations: the weight on his tongue, the subtle taste of pre-cum, and especially the way it pressed into his throat. He loved how, when his mouth was full like this, he felt as though he didn’t need to breathe. And, some of the time, he couldn’t.
Harry’s mind wandered to the first such incident, a few months ago. They’d been on the sofa. He had been straddling Draco, facing him with his head tucked into Draco’s shoulder. Draco had been fully clothed, save for his trousers undone, and Harry had been bottomless on his lap, desperately trying to stay silent while he sat with Draco’s cock inside his cunt. Draco had been scrolling on his mobile when Hermione had called him, and Draco had laid a controlling hand on the small of Harry’s back before picking up.
Harry forced himself to think about something innocent, like the project Draco was working on for Mrs. Weasley — researching woods’ magical properties to find which ones are best for usage in cooking — and it helped for a minute, until he heard Draco walk back into the room.
“Such a good slut,” Draco said sweetly. “Even in your depraved little fantasies, all you can think about is me using you for my own pleasure.” When Harry moaned again, Draco smirked up at him and continued. “I know you like thinking about me using you and then leaving you there without letting you cum. Maybe sometime we’ll do that. I can get you a cute harness and a strap-on and make you watch while I fuck myself on you. Make you lick it up like a good boy when I cum all over you. Would you like that?”
He felt Draco kiss his neck above his tungsten collar, and Harry gasped when Draco pushed a hand under Harry to touch his dick with two fingers.
Although he wasn’t in any right mind to realize it, most of the times when Harry heard Draco scold him with a name — like “you’re not being a good boy, are you?” or, in this case, “bad dog” — it jolted him into obedience. Harry didn’t like being bad, and there were very, very few exceptions. When he tried to be a brat — and he
He vaguely knew that he wasn’t making sense, that he was just babbling, but the only thing that seemed important was persuading Draco to be inside him. If only Draco knew how Harry
Draco said something under his breath, and Harry was about to ask what it was when he felt the collar quickly grow cold and then to normal temperature, for the second time. And then Draco kissed him briefly, and the wonderful feeling wasn’t there, and Harry whined as Draco broke away and smirked at him.
Harry didn’t remember breaking into a smile, but he must have done so because his face began to hurt because of how widely he was beaming.
Draco’s palm gently pressed down on Harry’s chest, holding him still so he wouldn’t move again. “Please what?”
“Woah,” Draco had said quietly after pulling away, his voice throaty with satisfaction. “I didn’t mean to do that, but...damn, look at you.”
“Please!” Harry begged, more loudly this time, spurred on by wanting to touch Draco too, but Draco just
Draco grunted in surprise against Harry’s mouth before chuckling and kissing him back. And then it was Harry’s turn to make a noise of surprise when Draco ground into him suddenly, rubbing wonderfully inside him. The sound Harry made morphed into raw arousal when Draco grabbed his wrists and pinned them to the desk.
Harry was curled on his side next to Draco, naked, the smooth metal of the leash’s chain cold against his skin. The leash, clipped to a leather collar around Harry’s neck, stretched to the nearest bedpost. Draco was sitting up, propped on pillows against the headboard, his legs outstretched and an open book in his lap — some Muggle author (
Part of him hoped that Draco would just make him admit to whatever it was that he was wanting, but he also knew that Draco was an incredibly patient man who found amusement in watching Harry suffer in silence. If Draco made him talk, it would likely either be in an unexpected, domestic setting, such as sitting comfortably on the couch together while each read his own book; or during their play, where Harry would be denied until he told Draco what he wanted to try. And that was only
It was so hard to talk while being subjected to this glorious torture, and Harry had no idea if he was making any sense as he began speaking. “Ah— fuck, I like this,” he said. “Because my shirt is open and you get to tease me like this. And because, ngh, you can move and spread my legs however you want, and I’m tied and I can’t do anything. ‘N you can kiss me and look at me. And...my arms are up.”
a time where he was naturally craving to be fucked. It already seemed to happen some of the time — his libido was wildly unstable from hormones, and occasionally it was through the roof for weeks at a time — but they’d never called it...
“Ass up,” Draco said, his palm pressing between Harry’s shoulder blades and pushing his chest against the bed, forcing Harry to arch his back to maintain the position.
Draco laughed. “You’ve got exams to grade. I can’t go back to Diagon Alley, so I’ll go home and do some work there and make dinner, and you’ll be done in three hours. You can wait that long.”
“No, they don’t,” said Draco sweetly, but his tone was firm and told Harry just what would happen if he stepped out of line. “Good puppies don’t talk, but sometimes they need help remembering that.” And he reached forward to squeeze Harry’s ass again, took a fistful of Harry’s hair and tugged his head up, and summoned something — Harry couldn’t see what — from the drawer. He discovered it was a ring gag when Draco reached around his head and tapped the silicone O-ring against his lips, easing his mouth open, before fastening it neatly at the back of Harry’s head. There was nowhere for his tongue to rest, of course, so he was left with it hovering awkwardly in the middle of his mouth as he tried to acclimate to the ring that kept his jaw from closing. He made a slightly disgruntled noise, unsettled by the fact that he couldn’t talk, even though he knew that was the primary purpose for gags in the first place. It wasn’t odd to him in and of itself that he couldn’t speak — silencing charms could accomplish that much. But he found the fact that he could make noise but not
This thought disappeared almost immediately, however, as Draco’s tongue moved lower and swiped over his asshole. Harry twitched and made a noise in his throat, and he quickly discovered that it was even harder to sit still while he was getting rimmed. Draco’s tongue teased his perineum, tracing tiny circles over his hole, and Harry groaned.
“You know what to do if you want to stop,” Draco said, his tone a bit more gentle than it had been previously. When Harry let out a hard breath, he added, “Although, I would bet a million Galleons that you’re already wet under those Auror robes of yours.”
He started when he felt the cool, tingling feeling of Draco’s cleaning spell in his other hole, and his mind brought up the time that Ron had replaced their lube with toothpaste as revenge for having walked in on them.
“You want more?” Draco asked him, and Harry found himself nodding desperately before Draco had even finished speaking.
whenever Harry tried to rub against something, and say, “You want my cock, puppy?” as he tossed a dildo into the crate. “Then show me. Let me see how much you need it. If you’re good I’ll consider fucking you.” Draco would look on, seeing Harry whine and desperately fuck himself on the toy in his hopes to please Draco enough to be rewarded.
Draco just laughed at his attempts to speak, and turned Harry around; he pushed Harry onto his stomach so he was lying flat against the bed. “Well, you’re lucky I
Harry made a noncommittal sound and exhaled hard through his nose, shifting uncertainly. “Can I taste my wetness?” he mumbled.
“That’s okay,” Draco said softly, his thumb tracing Harry’s cheekbone. “That’s perfect. You’ll be perfect.”
Which is why he was surprised upon noticing that Draco was allowing Harry to rub against his mouth. Had Harry been in any state of mind to explore this further, he would have come to the conclusion that Draco was trying to make him more comfortable — almost an apology for being too forward a few minutes prior.
“Maybe I’ll lie back and have you fuck me like that,” Draco said. “I’ll have you on that little short leash you love, so I’d be able to make you move however I wanted. I’d have you look right at me as I told you how good it felt getting filled while you fucked me. I’d bet you’d wanna touch me so badly, but I’d just make you keep moving while I jerked myself off.”
“I’m going to suck your pathetic little cock,” Draco said. “And you’re going to sit still because I don’t need you trying to fuck my face like a desperate whore.”
Harry nodded. There was a careful art, he had learned, to how to show enthusiasm around Draco: too much eagerness meant he’d be forced to wait, and too much nervousness and reservation meant that Draco would likely humilitate him before allowing him what he wanted.
Which was why Harry had wondered about the magic in the new band around his neck: Draco hadn’t done it, or he’d be able to feel his familiar magical signature on it. And though Draco was quite skilled with wandwork, this was something that he would ask of Felicity in order to be sure that it was done properly. They certainly trusted her enough for it, and wouldn’t be hesitant to tell her what the charms were for — especially if they were as...unconventional as Harry suspected they might be.
Harry fell forward a bit and buried his face in Draco’s shirt. “Please fuck me,” he said, his voice breaking a little.
Harry choked out a whine around Draco’s fingers and somehow became more aroused when he saw Draco smirk again.
Harry let out a hard breath, which he hadn’t even known he’d been holding, and rolled over, embarrassed when he made a small noise upon seeing Draco unbutton his trousers. He sat back on his heels.
He felt his hips begin rocking gently into Draco’s touch, shuddered as Draco’s fingers slid against him, and let his head fall back into the pillow.
And, oh, what if Draco wanted to come by and not let Harry out, just stick his cock through the bars of the crate for Harry to lick and suck, until Draco came on Harry’s face and Harry would whine, lick it up, and have to suffer in silence through his own arousal as Draco zipped himself up and walked away. If Harry whimpered and begged too much, Draco could gag him, send a Stinging Jinx through the bars, or, maybe, they could even buy a shock collar. Merlin, the
Draco kept smiling at him, and sat back, tugging Harry up by the leash so they were both sitting on their knees on the soft bed, Draco always being the taller. Draco kissed Harry again, cupping his face, and Harry made a soft noise as Draco used the leash to pull him closer.
Harry felt Draco begin to speed up, Draco’s thrusts becoming slightly shallower as he did so, and, had Harry any leverage, he would have been moving his hips to get Draco further inside him. Though he knew he was a pillow prince, this was different: Harry was now just a toy, a thing, all for Draco to use. It didn’t matter what he wanted, and it didn’t matter if he didn’t like what Draco was doing — he had no say in it. He knew that Draco would stop immediately if Harry so much as showed any sign of genuine dislike of their play, and so this knowledge left him free to let go, enjoying and allowing Draco’s control. Even tiny things, like the way he could do nothing about how Draco’s unbuttoned shirt tickled his chest, exacerbated those feelings: that of being owned, and that in which Draco’s feelings were the only ones that mattered.
“Can I cum, please—” he whimpered, and felt Draco’s fingertips tickling his chest until they wrapped around his throat.
“Of course,” Draco said, and he slowly stood up, leaving one of his hands still cupping Harry’s cheek. Harry gazed up at him. “What do you want to change?”
him; he often teased Harry when they were around others — especially friends — in order to get a reaction. It would be something so small, so nearly imperceptible, that no one else could pick up on it unless they knew what tells Harry had — which, of course, nobody did. Except Draco. He’d brush his fingers across the back of Harry’s neck, discreetly tug at his hair, or pinch a pressure point in public, just to watch with satisfaction as Harry tried to hide his reactions: the tiny whimpers and gasps, the way he ducked his head, the way his breath shook. Draco drew it all from him so easily, and it mortified Harry to have to try to maintain control when they were around other people. But he loved it. If Harry wore something that Draco had gotten him, he could tell that Draco made a point to mess with it at some point — he’d adjust Harry’s bow tie, perhaps; fix the collar of his shirt or robes; even fiddle with the charms on a necklace or day collar that Harry was wearing — all to discreetly rile Harry up. Draco would always smirk when he noticed Harry’s reaction, and it drove Harry mad. What was worse, even, was when Draco would hiss something in his ear when nobody else was paying attention: “good boy” was a common one if he wanted to make Harry pliant and distracted; even a quick reprimand, scolding him for any number of actions, got to Harry — he’d want to make it up to Draco, or even, on somewhat-rare occasions, provoke him further.
“Please,” Harry said, and he noticed that his voice sounded quite far away. “Please, it feels so good.”
“I understand,” Draco said, and he slowly rose again. His eyes were soft as he looked at Harry and tapped the top of the desk. “C’mon, baby, hop up.”
to touch himself, but he still felt like he was floating, and Draco’s words were what grounded him. And so he contented himself with a disappointed whimper and nothing more, letting Draco guide his hand away.
Harry hadn’t understood what he meant until Draco had dragged him, hair mussed and with a wet spot in his boxers, over to the floor-length mirror on the other side of his room. He’d held Harry from behind, his chest to Harry’s back as they looked at themselves in the mirror, and pushed his hand into Harry’s pants. Harry saw in the mirror the bright, fresh bruise on his own throat.
“I love fucking you,” Draco murmured quietly, kissing Harry’s neck. “Always feels so good. You liked having both your little holes stuffed with my cum, hm?”
Harry shuddered and did as he was ordered, planting himself on all fours. He felt Draco’s hands on his ass as soon as he did so, and he let his head hang quietly as Draco began to examine him. The leash hung similarly from his neck, the short chain meaning the handle loop rested fully on the bed, but only just.
Harry gasped quietly, and he had to fight to keep his eyes open and on Draco’s. He felt the motion of Draco’s cock against his G-spot, thinking about how ironic it was that he was on top and yet completely powerless.
took the time to touch him in the ways he knew Harry loved, to take care of him in the ways Harry barely knew he needed, and so much more...thinking about it was stunning, frightening,
“You’re an Auror, there’s not a chance I’m leaving even the slightest possibility that something happens and you can’t take it off. But nobody else can except for the two of us. You have to know the spells.”
Harry felt fingers tug at his hair. “Hush,” Draco said, a bit sternly. “You’re to stay still for a few minutes more. I told Molly I’d do some reading about which wood is best for new enchanted cutting boards; it will only take a short time.”
Harry quickly tried to swallow the saliva that had built up in his mouth, and he let out a hard, shaky breath when Draco pulled his hair, forcing his head up and to the side. Draco quickly bit Harry’s ear, and whispered to him, “You’re so pretty for me. Just lying here like a dumb little puppy while I use your holes.” He thrust into Harry especially hard and Harry whimpered; Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hair until Harry could feel his scalp burning, and he made another desperate noise. He felt Draco’s hot breath on his ear: “Get on top of me,” Draco breathed, and he pulled out of Harry and lay back against the pillow.
Draco shifted above him, and Harry only noticed that he’d changed the angle when Draco’s cock rubbed over his G-spot on the next thrust in. He choked out a groan and tried to press his ass up to get Draco deeper inside him, and his position change allowed Draco to touch him more easily as he fucked Harry.
“You feel so fucking good,” Draco said, groaning quietly. “You want me to cum in you, baby? Fill you up ‘til it drips out of you?”
“Your cunt keeps clenching around me,” Draco whispered huskily in his ear, and Harry whined in embarrassment when he realized that it was true. “Your body is
more marks on him, more signs that he belonged to Draco. But he knew that if he kept acting up, he’d probably be in chastity for up to a few days, which he always hated. And so he tried to sit still and let himself be content with doing so. He was barely aware of anything other than Draco’s hands on him and Draco’s tongue inside him — not to mention the ache in his cunt from wanting to cum so badly.
Harry knew that he was going to eventually. It was only a matter of time. He bit back further protests, reluctantly resigning himself to what Draco wanted, and kept his eyes closed.
“Desperate slut,” Draco said, and his tone was a strange mix of sharp and loving that Harry could get addicted to. “You look so needy.
“I shouldn’t have to tell you three times,” Draco growled in his ear, and Harry could do nothing but blink helplessly up at him as one of Draco’s hands made its way to his throat. “I shouldn’t even have to tell you more than once. I don’t care if you don’t want to do whatever it is I tell you. You’re nothing but a stupid fucktoy, so stop acting like you’re something more.”
Harry turned his head to the side, resting his cheek on the pillow, and let Draco continue to tease him. He felt familiar hands fondle his ass and leisurely move one finger in and out of his cunt — Harry’s breath began to fall unevenly, and he shifted, hoping that Draco’s touches would stray lower to his dick.
Harry was happy. He touched the band reverently and stepped over to the wall mirror in his office, there in case he needed to check his appearance before exiting the room. Draco would be using it shortly, he noted.
Draco stayed still for a few moments, gathering himself and coming down from his orgasm. Harry felt Draco regain himself: Draco, still inside Harry, nuzzled the mark his teeth had made on Harry’s neck, and gently kissed his way to Harry’s mouth.
“I don’t want to get you wet,” he mumbled, and embarrassment made his face flush further when Draco laughed.
Harry could hear Hermione’s words on the other side, given his proximity to the phone, and it was something to do with that book club that she and Draco were planning. Nothing interesting. Draco had spoken nonchalantly, casually, not remotely like he had his cock buried in his dripping-wet husband, and it’d turned Harry on more than he had even imagined it could. He’d started when he heard Hermione ask about him, ask to talk to him about Marchbanks’s fundraiser the following fortnight, and he had to wait no longer than a second before Draco, without missing a beat, responded.
“You have a problem with that?” Draco murmured, beginning to suck on the spot again, and Harry knew that it was too late, regardless of how he felt about it — he’d already have a bruise there.
“No matter, though. I’ll just have to fill you up as many times as I can, so all my cum takes and you end up full with my child.”
“Do you want to say something?” Draco said, and he grinded once against Harry, giving a self-satisfied noise when Harry gasped and tilted his hips back in search of more contact. Harry just made another incoherent noise, trying to move to persuade Draco to put more pressure on his dick.
His mouth opened and remained like that as he tried to invent something to say. “I have work….” was all he could muster, and he knew how pathetic the disbelief in his voice sounded. He was
Harry groaned. “Please, Draco,” he whispered, and he gasped when Draco yanked his head back by his hair. His scalp smarted with the force of it, and he gasped again when Draco’s teeth found his throat.
, aren’t you?” His voice was condescendingly sweet as he spun Harry’s chair to face him. He used one knee to nudge Harry’s legs open, stepped between them, and grabbed Harry’s chin. He gently turned Harry’s head to either side, examining him.
but broke off, not even knowing how to start. He was sure that Draco could feel him shaking slightly.
“I love how you get wetter inside right after you cum,” Draco murmured, and, out of nowhere, he started to fuck Harry again with long, deep thrusts. “Perfect. It makes it even easier for me to use your holes to get off with.”
would be the one. It was a Saturday; both men were off work and at home. Draco was shut up in his workroom, a fascinating space that was half-study and half-potions lab, busily testing out the woods he was using to make Mrs. Weasley’s new cutting boards. They were almost ready for carving, Harry had heard Draco say earlier that day; the woods just needed a few more potion tests before he could successfully determine which one was the most suitable. As for Harry himself, well, he hadn’t been able to get much done so far, even though it was nearly half past noon and he had nothing particularly heinous on his to-do list. He’d had four giant mugs of tea to try to curb his anxiety (and thus had gone to piss three times in the last seventy-five minutes) when he determined himself to confront his demons and be done with it. Hopefully, Harry thought, being in his element would give him more courage. So he went upstairs to his and Draco’s room, took off his shirt, and looked at himself in the full-length mirror.
, this was what Harry had wanted. In the back of his mind he knew he was being loud, but every time Draco’s cock rubbed against his G-spot, he couldn’t help but make a noise.
Draco began to fuck him, and it was slow and deep and everything that Harry needed. Draco’s movements were lazy but still domineering, and oh,
Draco’s waves rocked Harry’s boat once more, and he felt so close to being ready to cum that he thought if Draco made him stop he would scream. He kept touching himself frantically, being
he would move faster. “I love getting you all embarrassed and seeing how wet your cunt gets from it. You want my cum inside you, huh?”
“The best is when you start begging. I tell you how much I want to fill up your pretty cunt, and you get so shameless. It’s almost like you know your worth, know that you’re just for this...just for getting used.”
Draco actually laughed. “Can’t pay attention when I push you around, I shouldn’t have expected anything more. Would you rather I fuck you as you are, on your back, or I bend you over the desk and use you like that?”
Harry felt Draco touch the outside of his cunt then wipe the wetness on Harry’s inner thigh. “Just as you should be,” Draco said smoothly, and he spelled the tie away from Harry’s wrists. Harry exhaled hard, bringing his hands down automatically to try to shield some part of himself from exposure. Draco just laughed and let go of him, before sitting back, propping himself up on one hand, and letting his eyes rake over Harry’s body. “Well?”
, read the smaller wording on their sign. Draco worked the potions and had a room in the basement of their shop where he expertly stirred and invented. He occasionally came home smelling like smoke or some herb that Harry didn’t know the name of; once, his robes held the lingering, acrid odor of what Draco explained to be the smell emitted by black swallowtail osmeterium.
He felt Draco’s chest against his back, sticky from their sweat. Each time Draco thrust into him, his breath caught and he felt pleasure spark through him. And time felt foggy, but he knew that it was only about a minute before he was whining as Draco came in him.
“You’re such a cute slut,” Draco said, slyly caressing the new red mark on Harry’s ass. “I love seeing you ride me and touch yourself, rubbing your cute cock for me. You enjoying yourself, puppy?”
Harry let out a hard breath and sat up, away from Draco’s cock, doing his best to stop drooling everywhere. Draco sat up too, pushing himself up and rising onto his knees; the duvet was bunched up around them now, and he thrust it to the side. Harry knelt in front of him, sitting on his heels so that Draco seemed even taller than he normally did — to Harry, anyway, who never saw the tops of anyone’s heads, and the top of whose head was nearly always visible to others. He could probably name fewer than a dozen people who were shorter than him.
Harry immediately lost all of his remaining ability to form sentences, and he bucked his hips without realizing it, seeking more pressure on his dick. He heard the other man’s muffled chuckle before Draco lowered his head again and sucked Harry’s dick into his mouth. Draco’s lips wrapped around the shaft of Harry’s dick as his tongue flicked lightly over the sensitive head, and each time Harry pressed his hips up, Draco just ate him out with more vigor.
was capable of being. Draco, who was attractive and graceful and clever and glamorous, and Harry knew that if he was any of these things, it certainly wouldn’t be glamorous or charming, so how did Draco want him?
“I love you so much,” Draco murmured, and started to gently suck marks into the skin of Harry’s inner thighs.
“You’re so gorgeous,” Draco said. “I love when you’re desperate and I get to hear all the pretty little noises you make.”
Harry once more found himself nodding silently into Draco’s shoulder, and he let Draco lead him to their room, where Harry had just sat in front of the mirror minutes ago. He felt disoriented and fidgety.
“What is it?” Draco asked him, but Harry could tell by the smirk on his face that Draco already knew.
It was almost Draco’s way of courting Harry, not that he had to. But it made things delightful for both of them, and it was a way for Draco to dote on Harry in an additional way that he, as Harry’s dom, enjoyed. Not to mention it gave them something else to do with all of the extra money they had.
“Draco,” Harry gasped, but he hadn’t remembered thinking it before he spoke. He was so far gone; everything seemed like a fantastical dream. “Draco….”
“Come on, cum for me,” Draco said, and if he had been attentive, Harry would have identified the intense genuineness and love — and
Harry groaned softly, but he did, shifting his head to look at Draco, who still hovered over him. Draco had finished unbuttoning his shirt, and it now hung attractively off his shoulders, the open front halves hanging down and brushing Harry’s stomach. Draco looked at Harry appraisingly for a second before he spoke again, his eyes flashing silver.
Harry’s hands began to wander too; he started to try to touch Draco’s cock, which was hardening again against his leg, but the taller man took his wrists and moved them away, nipping Harry’s lip as he did so. Harry moaned quietly and relaxed, and Draco pushed him back until he was lying across the top of the desk. His knees were bent and his lower legs were hanging off the edge of the desk, but Draco pulled Harry forward to more easily remove his trousers. Harry didn’t know what to do with his hands, and, as if having read his mind, Draco grabbed Harry’s forearms and hissed a spell under his breath; cuffs appeared around Harry’s wrists, and short chains sprang from them, rooting themselves in the wood of the desk. “Fuck—” Harry felt his wrists being pulled to the sides of his head and secured there, and Draco grinned at him before pulling Harry’s pants all the way down to his ankles.
as quickly as he could. Completely different from his normal methods, but Harry was in no right mind to care about that.
“That’s it?” Draco asked neutrally, feigning innocence. He raised an eyebrow at Harry, still stroking himself.
“Fuck, you’re so hot, I want to make you feel good. I love that you’re jerking off while looking at me.”
Draco smirked, and Harry ducked his head when he saw how he was being looked at: like an object. Draco reached out and caressed Harry’s face for a moment before he reached for the bedpost and, from it, unlooped Harry’s leash. He wrapped it thrice around his palm, leaving a little over a foot of slack, and tugged Harry closer.
you’re the best thing I’ve ever seen?” Draco said, a nudging lilt to his voice, but Harry knew that Draco meant to affirm what Harry already knew — he
“A few other little tricks that I shall keep hidden up my sleeve for the time being,” Draco said evenly, his warm smile filling Harry’s heart.
Maybe that was wishful thinking. Maybe that was just Harry trying to tell himself that Draco would grant his desires at
Harry loved thigh hickeys, and he felt himself slowly get lost in the sensations: tiny zings from the teeth lightly scraping against him; pleasurable waves emanating from where Draco sucked against his skin, until a red mark blossomed there; the gentle clasp of their hands together, while Draco’s other hand held Harry’s leg, keeping his thighs open for Draco’s reverent mouth.
. He wasn’t allowed to talk, and though he was sorely tempted to do so just to get Draco to gag him, he knew that he wouldn’t get fucked if he disobeyed.
He cut himself off with a moan when Draco bit down on his neck, hips stuttering, and Harry whined as Draco came inside him. He couldn’t feel it, despite wishing he could, but Harry loved this moment nonetheless: the sharp pain as Draco’s teeth dug into his skin; the way Draco, for a brief moment, lost himself in Harry’s body; and that blissed-out feeling from knowing that he had pleased Draco. Harry loved all of it. He realized that he was whimpering almost inaudibly, and he let himself close his eyes.
Harry moaned and took a deep, shaky breath. “I….” Deep, shaky breath. “I want you to knock me up,” he whispered, his eyes on Draco’s.
. Look how wet you are.” He removed Harry’s pants completely and knelt between his legs, pushing them apart and leaning in, his hot breath on the damp fabric. His tongue laved over the spot, and Harry felt Draco’s tongue moving on the other side of the fabric.
Draco turned towards him, and Harry couldn’t see him, but he felt the movement against his bare back. He felt Draco rest a hand on his hip, possessive, and couldn’t hold back his whimper.
...but the way he fell apart so easily under Draco was humiliating, and he loved it. He came to the realization that he was whimpering continuously, trying to respond to Draco but unable to bring himself to.
Draco grinned and sauntered closer, leaning against a wall to the left of Harry’s desk and crossing his arms. “I was bored.”
Harry seldom came twice in the same session, but now it didn’t seem so far fetched: he felt sparks flickering in him — little beginnings of, hopefully, fireworks still to come. The number of sparks increased when Draco pressed the vibrator harder against Harry’s dick, and he felt his cunt tighten around Draco’s fingers.
“You’re dripping all over my cock,” Draco hissed in his ear, and Harry moaned when Draco leaned in and began sucking a mark under his jaw. “Oh, what, you like that? I’m just marking my territory, baby.”
Draco spanked him again, his hand coming down hard before Harry had any warning. The pain from the smack shot through his entire body; it fucking
“Please,” he moaned, though, admittedly, there was little more that he wanted right then: years of glorious sex with Harry had Draco’s fingers moving in just the right ways and his tongue swirling exactly how he knew Harry liked it.
And then, when Draco knew everything else about him, when there were no more secrets to keep nor grudges to hold, they talked about sex. They’d messed around at that point — heavy kissing and what have you, with the occasional hand down the other’s pants — but had said nothing about the cravings that both of them had: Draco’s, to be trusted with something to possess and protect, and Harry’s, to trust someone with possessing and protecting
touched one of his nipples. He felt no pain as Draco pinched him gently and slowly began increasing the pressure on Harry’s nipple, until finally he was pinching
He wanted to be able to move, it being better when he was allowed to, but he still relished being held down. “Fuck,” he gasped, “please….” He brought his hands down, wanting to tangle his fingers in Draco’s hair; he felt Draco growl against him, and found his hands suddenly pinned by his head by invisible ropes. He whined as Draco licked up his cunt, his hips straining against Draco’s hold. He hated how empty he felt, but Draco’s mouth made up for it.
Harry closed his eyes, and felt Draco brush his hair out of his face. Draco kissed Harry on the forehead and pulled him close.
and Draco wrapped an arm firmly around Harry’s torso, mouthed at his neck above the collar, and began to thrust into him with quick, shallow motions. Harry made no move to touch himself — he was too worn out and sensitive from having just cum — but it still was good to be fucked.
And the world felt frozen in time, just Harry waiting painfully for what Draco had to say, holding his breath and not venturing to look the other man in the eye.
He inhaled sharply when he felt Draco’s fingers wrapping around his neck, gently choking him, and Harry moaned when Draco suddenly began to fuck him with deep, hard thrusts. He knew better than to close his eyes, but he had trouble keeping them open and focused. Draco was his whole world — with him, around him, atop him,
. The sensation shot straight to Harry’s cunt; he groaned and he arched into the feeling of Draco’s touch on his chest. But Draco’s fingers wrapped around his throat, and Harry shuddered and went limp as Draco slowly choked him.
But when the door opened, it wasn’t her, and Harry blotted the paper in his surprise as he watched his husband step into his office and close the door behind himself.
“Love tasting yourself while you clean me off?” Draco said a few moments later, and Harry moaned in response. “Can’t get enough of having your mouth full of cock? Fuck,” he’d added, “you're incredible. You take it so well, look at you, all flushed and pretty. Open your eyes, baby.”
Draco smiled — not shyly, for he was never shy, but there was something there that was different from how he normally behaved. Anticipation? “Take it out,” he said, warmth in his voice.
He’d forgotten about the collar, only reminded when Draco tugged on it, pulling him farther into the kiss, and he gasped softly. Draco’s tongue slipped into Harry’s mouth, and Harry moaned quietly and began to idly touch himself once more.
Because the skin of Harry’s inner thighs was particularly sensitive, Draco’s kisses there always made Harry more desperate — Draco was content to take his time when in that position, but, as they both knew, Harry was prone to impatience.
, for Merlin’s sake!) of it turned him on all the same. His breath caught as Draco’s fingers found and fiddled with the little ring that connected Harry’s collar to his leash.
Harry nodded. He wasn’t sure he could speak if he wanted to, and was reluctant to try, fearing that all that the only sounds to come out of his mouth if he tried would be moans.
Harry blinked his eyes open, just briefly, and in that quick glimpse he saw that his thighs were littered with hickeys of various sizes and shades. Nobody would see them but Draco and himself, of course, but it still affected him to be marked. He knew that Draco liked doing it, liked leaving things behind that showed the world (even if no one else
Harry moaned quietly, embarrassed at Draco’s words and the way he was rapidly becoming turned on again; it just felt so
Draco knelt down in front of his chair, allowing Harry to be the taller for once, and looked him in the eye. “You okay?” he said, his fingers gently tracing shapes on Harry’s wrist.
“Seems like you’re just here for the sex,” Draco teased, and Harry knew that Draco didn't really think that, so he laughed and kissed him, his left hand coming up to wrap around the back of Draco’s neck.
To Harry’s dismay, Draco’s mouth and fingers left his chest as their eyes met. “No, baby,” Draco murmured sweetly. “I can’t, not for too long, ‘s’not safe.” He leaned in and began kissing Harry’s collarbone, as if in consolation for not being able to choke him more.
“It’s okay, baby,” Draco said, no longer arrogant, but still in control as he always truly was. Harry thought Draco’s silver eyes saw into his soul.
He could have a crate or cage to sit in, with his own little dog bed and cozy blanket, and he’d stay there until Draco unlocked it and let him out. It’d be roomy enough for a bowl of water should he get thirsty. There’d be a rubber ball for him to chew on. If he got needy he could find something in his crate to rub against, since dogs don’t use their paws to do anything, let alone to get off.
He apparently didn’t need any, because Draco smiled at him again, looked him up and down, and touched the doorknob. He turned to go. “I’ll just leave you to it, then,” said Draco, his words still far too innocent for his expression. Stepping out into the hall, Draco stopped briefly, looking back at Harry. “Unless you have something to tell me?”
“Aw, look,” Draco mocked, that patronizing lilt to his voice that always made Harry blush. “He’s embarrassed? No worries, baby, I know you too well to think that you don’t like it.”
“I decide what you need,” Draco interrupted, and Harry fell silent under his quelling stare. Draco released the spell on Harry’s wrists and flicked his hip. “Turn over.”
And then he remembered how Draco always looked at him, and spoke to him, and held him when he felt small. He remembered one of the first times that Draco had gone down on him: Harry had been on his back, his legs spread as Draco lay between them, and that was when Harry was still new to what a
“You’re gorgeous,” Draco said. On the edge of his tone floated reverence, like he still couldn’t believe he had the privilege of watching Harry cum, even after years of sex together. His hair was uncharacteristically messy, and it was endearing to see him like that, Harry thought, since the whole rest of the world only saw well-put-together Draco and nothing less.
Harry groaned. That wasn’t what he’d meant, of course, but...he’d be lying if he said he hadn’t thought about it. He’d wondered how it would feel. He’d wondered if he would be in charge. He’d wondered what it would be like to see Draco bottoming.
“You’re so beautiful,” Draco breathed, his mouth trailing lower as he prompted Harry to lift his hips, working his pants and boxers off. “Thank you for telling me.”
Harry wished he could muffle the extremely-aroused noise he made. He shut his eyes hard, but opened them when he felt a light tug on his leash; he saw Draco looking at him with his eyebrows raised meaningfully.
“I, wait—” Harry said. He was flying blind, everything was happening too fast. He didn’t know what to do. He sank to his knees, only halfway across the hall to Draco. “I do. Have something to tell you.”
Harry was vaguely forming an idea in his mind of how to ask Draco about the collar, about what else it could do...but this was a slow process, as he was kept sufficiently distracted by Draco’s kisses, which stirred flames in the pit of his stomach, and touches of his dick, which made him yearn to have Draco inside him.
Harry still felt a thrill every time he heard those words, and he wanted to take a deep breath, sit up a little straighter,
Harry felt Draco unclip the leash and spell it aside before rolling him onto his back. Draco climbed on top of him, cupped his face, and kissed him.
He heard Draco hiss something while touching the collar. And suddenly the collar turned startlingly cold — it felt good against Harry’s hot skin — and he inhaled deeply through his nose, his eyes falling shut. He felt Draco’s palms slide up his chest, and arched his back, savoring the feeling of being touched and held. But the collar faded back to the perfect temperature almost as quickly as it had become ice-cold, and Harry blinked open his eyes as Draco crawled over him.
“I can’t believe how wet you are,” Draco said huskily as he pushed all the way inside Harry. “Leaking all over my cock. I could fucking tease you all day, you look so good with your cunt dripping for me.” He began to rock his hips slowly, still staying most of the way inside Harry as he started moving. His left hand moved from Harry’s chest to holding one of his legs up, maneuvering him exactly how he wanted. Harry just groaned and arched his back, basking in the feeling of being controlled.
He wished he was chained inside the crate that he didn’t even have. Draco could watch Harry through the bars of the crate and mock him when he whimpered — he’d
“We match,” Draco said, their noses brushing, and he leaned back and ran his fingers through Harry’s hair. “You’re perfect,” he said again, and Harry beamed.
Draco stepped in front of the mirror and corrected his hair with a spell, straightened his waistcoat, checked his fly; Harry watched him with a half-smile. They kissed again, Draco gently cupping Harry’s face before trailing his fingers down to the band around Harry’s neck.
And this always made Harry dizzy, when Draco did something like this — told him to move when he was tied, asked him a question while he was gagged...it made Harry feel helpless. He’d want to please Draco so badly, but not know where to start, and it made him wetter and harder than it had any right to.
“You’ve been so good, baby,” Draco whispered. “Here’s a treat for now. If you stay good, I’ll let you suck my cock later.”
best interest as much as the other option. “Please fuck me,” he whimpered, “please, I want your cock so much, I can’t stand it. I hate feeling empty, please, sir.” He held his breath as the head of Draco’s cock slid against his swollen crura, his wetness making the movement easy.
Draco said to him, and kissed him sweetly. Harry made a contented sound as their lips met. Draco gently released Harry’s legs, pulled out of him, and sat back, casting an appreciative glance toward Harry’s cunt, out of which Draco’s cum was beginning to drip. Harry rolled onto his side, rather embarrassed but quite pleased nonetheless, and Draco took his leash and lay down next to him.
Harry did as he was told and clumsily flipped himself over, climbing over Draco to straddle him awkwardly. As soon as his lower legs were settled on either side of Draco, Draco guided Harry down as he pushed inside him again. Harry let out a contented sound when he felt Draco’s cock slowly fill him up again; he yelped in surprise, however, when Draco yanked him down by the leash for a rough kiss and thrust up into him. And when Harry started to move to try to reciprocate the motions, Draco just grabbed his hips and held him in place, whispering, “Don’t move.” Draco held Harry still just a couple inches above him, so that he remained inside him, and that left room for Draco to begin to fuck Harry from below, bending his knees to better be able to do so.
Draco’s fingers wrapped lightly around his throat, just above the collar, and Harry froze, afraid he’d done something wrong.
That was one of the major things he’d been scared to ask for, and finally it was out there, a huge weight off of Harry’s chest.
And Harry would just need to be a good and quiet puppy if he wanted to be allowed to have Draco’s cock again later. Maybe he’d even get fucked if he was good enough.
Harry sat up nervously, avoiding Draco’s eyes and saying nothing. He kept his legs spread, and slowly reached between his thighs, his head leaning back to rest against the pillows as he began to touch his dick. He let his eyes fall closed.
a bit shy about how much he reacted, Harry loved it too much to be too embarrassed — loved when Draco could control him just with the smallest touch or the most meaningless word.
it — but as soon as he put pressure on his dick, his whole cunt and ass both tightened. He wanted Draco to let him use a vibrator (under the argument that Draco felt better when Harry’s holes got tighter, of course), but he was already so ready to cum that he thought it would be a waste of time to grab one. And even though this wasn’t what he was used to — more wetness made it harder for him to find the right pressure while touching himself — it worked out just fine and soon enough he was groaning through each exhale.
“I’m not upset,” Draco interrupted calmly, and Harry believed him because of that malicious smirk that still sat on his face. “I’m just wondering why you didn’t come get me if you wanted to have some fun.”
Harry whined and strained against his bondage, wanting to touch Draco, wanting to pleasure him, and, more than anything else, wanting Draco’s cock in his mouth. His eyes raked over Draco’s body: dressed in some of the finest garments Galleons could buy, not a stitch out of place, and fully clothed except for his fly undone, Draco exuded power, authority, and nonchalant arousal; he watched Harry struggle, casually jerking himself off. Harry couldn’t stop reacting, moaning and panting as his eyes took in the way Draco languidly touched himself.
They came seconds later. “Turn around,” Draco said to him, and Harry did, pivoting on his hands and knees to face Draco, who was fully hard and jerking himself off again, his eyes on Harry. Harry wasn’t sure if he was supposed to look Draco in the eyes or keep his gaze low; regardless, he was distracted by Draco’s cock merely a foot away from his face, and couldn’t keep his eyes off it as Draco’s hand moved over himself.
He was jolted back to reality when he felt Draco slow. He’d gone from hard, fast licks and sucking to long, slow, teasing licks, and Harry needed
that always seemed like a crazy thing — and thought, not for the first time or even the hundredth, that there was nobody else with whom he’d rather experience it all.
“Sounds like you don’t mind too much, baby, huh?” Draco said, not bothering to wait for Harry to string together a coherent response, and slowly started to grind into him again.
Draco flicked Harry’s collarbone with his index finger. “You heard me. Or is my cute puppy as stupid as he looks?”
“Don’t even try to play upset,” Draco said, his breathing getting heavier. “You’re loving every fucking second of this. You love that you’re tied up with my favorite necktie, you love that I’m using your cunt, you love when I hit you. You love that I’ve still got my shirt around my shoulders while you’ve been naked this whole time.”
And then Draco’s mouth enveloped his dick again, and Harry lost all comprehension. And this time, thank Merlin, Draco didn’t stop, and pleasure washed over Harry.
Draco said again; he guided Harry’s head lower, moving past the gag and into Harry’s mouth. Harry closed his eyes tightly as Draco pushed farther in, pressing into his throat until Harry had work to fight his gag reflex. He slid his tongue against Draco’s cock, trying to do his best even when his jaw was pried open, and the smug smile that Harry received in return made the effort more than worth it. As Draco began to fuck his throat, Harry let himself relax, as he was used to doing whenever Draco took total control.
, and Harry could do no more than gasp and groan and take it. Normally he would have yelled into a pillow or cast a cooling charm on his skin to take the edge off, but neither of those options presented themselves as available at this time. He felt something drip down his thigh from his cunt, and shuddered when he remembered that it was just as likely to be Draco’s cum as his own wetness. Harry started to savor the ache of Draco’s cock forcing its way into him, and he whined.
to be filled. But his struggles just served to amuse, apparently, because Draco smirked when he saw Harry squirming, and pulled out anyway. Harry couldn’t keep in his whimper; he hated this part. He felt his cunt clenching around nothing, trying to close around the cock that was no longer there. He let out an embarrassingly plaintive sound.
He was already soaked, and this would have him dripping even more. Harry couldn’t help but shift, arching his back and trying to shift the vibrations inside him — the toy touched his G-spot inconsistently, and the lack of pressure was torture. He was still curled up, on his side, and the position left him with frustratingly little leverage. He groaned. It wasn’t enough.
Harry knew he would need his hands or a toy on his dick to cum, and it only bothered him at this moment because he was completely helpless. He realized that he was tied up with one of Draco’s neckties — Harry didn’t own any, Draco insisting that bow ties looked better on him — and he loved the thought that Draco would wear that tie out at some point, and nobody would know that it had been used for this. He also loved that,
Harry groaned, and forced his eyes open and head up. Draco’s hand went to the side of his face, and Harry slowed a bit so as to not dislodge him.
to be used and displayed. It was more than that, of course: it was giving up control, and that was the essence, the raw crux, of his desire. He wanted to just be, and not have to decide anything at all; to have someone —
) that Draco had been interested in of late. He was close enough that Harry could feel the heat of his skin, even through the thick fabric of Draco’s trousers.
...Nobody else underneath whom he’d rather be pinned, getting fucked like he was the only thing in the world that could give his husband that satisfaction, that pleasure.
Harry whimpered and pressed his hips up, but Draco just continued the same pattern of light, lackadaisical rubbing over Harry’s dick. He knew that Draco would make him talk, and he knew that he’d give in.
of getting pregnant, he’d still want Draco to finish inside him, no questions asked. He’d beg, even. Like that was any surprise.
get home (after what felt like five days of waiting for Harry), he’d leashed Harry to the post of the kitchen table and kept him there while making dinner, humming jovially to himself. Harry hadn’t been gagged, but it had been made very clear that if he spoke anything other than asking to stop or slow down, the denial would be extended three more days. Draco had made Harry kneel right next to him, perfectly still while Draco ate, and for his obedience he was rewarded with table scraps: bites of sautéed asparagus and bacon-wrapped filet mignon and potatoes au gratin — Draco was an excellent cook. (Harry supposed it went hand in hand with the potion making.) After having finished, Draco had remained seated, summoned the latest edition of
Harry couldn’t decide what to do; it all felt so good. If he went slowly, he got to feel Draco slowly fill him up, which was incredible — but if he went quickly, the deeper motions were more likely to stimulate his A-spot, which he especially loved. He settled for the faster pace, lowering his head and bracing his right hand on Draco’s shoulder for support.
“You’re close,” Draco said, panting, “I can feel your cunt getting tighter, damn. It feels so good when you cum on my cock, makes me want to own you even more.”
Draco’s left hand held him by the hair, but his right brushed over Harry’s ear and then lower to the hickey on his neck, tracing it possessively. Harry badly wanted to touch his dick again, to slowly rub the sides of it and stroke himself until he was as hard as he could be. He knew he probably wouldn’t be able to cum again right away, realistically, but the desire was still there, just as strong as if he hadn’t cum a few moments previously.
Draco stroked his hair and kissed him softly, before spelling the two of them clean. He summoned a cloth, wet it, and wiped Harry’s face gently.
Harry didn’t remember tearing up, but he must have done so because he was so happy that his vision was suddenly streaked with tears threatening to fall. “I love you,” he said happily. “I love you. Thank you.”
didn’t even know what he would like prior to Draco’s discovery, either — like the time Harry was told in the morning of his day off that he wouldn’t be allowed to touch himself or cum until that night, when Draco was to get home from work. This had happened several times, to Harry’s enjoyment (and reluctance). On the most recent occasion, when Draco finally
, Harry thought, without any bitterness, as Draco guided him down with a hand still in his hair. He felt pressure on his neck, and realized that he was being held in place both by Draco’s hand and the taut leash.
“Shh, baby, maybe in a bit,” Draco said, and he pushed something against Harry’s cunt and slipped it inside him. Harry inhaled sharply, and he realized when Draco’s fingers let go that it was a vibrator, small and egg-shaped and—
Nothing seemed to happen, but when Draco guided Harry’s fingers back to find the spot where the split in the metal was before, Harry found it to be smooth. He traced the perimeter of the band, feeling along the etchings for the opening of the slit, and he let out a heavy breath when he didn’t find it.
“I love feeling you inside me—” Harry mumbled, and he felt embarrassed, too, that the only place he could look was right into Draco’s eyes. Draco was looking at him intensely, in the way he always did; his silver eyes shone with the affection that he was in too dominant a mood to express.
“I...kind of want….” Harry took a deep breath, focusing on Draco’s comforting touch. “...a crate. If you’re okay with it.”
Draco quickly pecked him on the lips, and there it was again, a sudden spark of pleasure that lasted for less than half a second, just as long as Draco’s lips were on his. Then it was gone, and Harry was left staring breathlessly up at Draco, his eyes wide and mouth halfway open.
“Not sure,” Draco said. “Probably a modified Protean Charm,” he murmured, leaning in and beginning to kiss along Harry’s jawline. His lips brushed Harry’s skin and Harry bared his neck as Draco moved a little lower. “But I don’t know any details.”
The apathy in the way Draco said it made Harry shudder with want. He arched, bucking his hips and delighting in the feeling of Draco’s fingers rubbing wonderfully against his G-spot.
“You know why,” Harry said, not as irately as he would have preferred. “I told you I needed to finish grading by half-past two.”
The glorious sting of Draco’s palm against his ass pushed Harry through his climax, and he heard himself moaning more loudly than he thought was decent as he moved himself down on Draco’s cock one more time. His hand had become almost numb from touching himself, but he desperately he tried to keep going, so Draco pushed Harry’s hand aside and started to rub his dick — it was far from perfect, but it prolonged Harry’s orgasm for long enough that he started to squirm from the hypersensitivity.
“You’re the one who suffers, according to you,” Draco said. He cast a quick cleaning spell over Harry, kissed him on the temple, and began to assist in the buttoning-up of Harry’s shirt. “Since you get all whiny when I don’t let you cum.”
He felt Draco’s hand caress his hair, and smiled up at him — to the best of his ability, given that he still wore the gag.
It embarrassed Harry that, though he’d only known he wanted this for a few weeks — to try pet play, that is — he had to suppress a few things that already seemed sort of natural to think about. He knew he’d been a little bit different, and he knew that Draco noticed — most notably, a few times upon hearing Draco’s praise, he’d been tempted to wriggle happily and move as though he was wagging a tail. He would smile and lean into Draco, but he’d wanted to do more and he sensed that Draco could tell.
His dick was so wet that there’d never be any way to find the exact pressure and placement he liked, and he discovered that the only way he’d be able to get close enough to cumming was to press against his dick with all four fingers and just
Harry groaned and shook his head, biting the inside of his cheek to stay as quiet as he could. He felt Draco slowing his thrusts, and wanted to cry out to beg him not to.
“What a good boy,” Draco said. “Pity I can’t push past your cervix, that would be sure to do the trick.”
Harry took a deep breath, and already things were beginning to feel better. He didn’t need for this to be
Draco’s voice was soft and kind, drawing Harry in and grounding him. “Of course, love,” Draco said, running a soothing hand up and down Harry’s back. “What kinds of things?”
His eyes were still closed, and he took a shuddering breath, jumping a little in surprise when Draco kissed him. The kiss was comforting, slow, Draco’s tongue coaxing courage into Harry, who sighed contentedly when he felt Draco’s fingers tug at his hair. It ended too soon.
He’d never been able to cum from oral — only his own hand or a vibrator could push him over. The pressure was never quite right if it wasn’t from one of those, but wow, Draco sure could get him close. Sometimes, when Harry wasn’t cuffed like this, Draco would move back, his mouth slick, and pull Harry’s hand down to prompt him to touch himself if he was close. Draco would keep moving, fingering Harry or fucking him with his tongue while Harry rubbed himself off. Draco had never been insecure about how he couldn’t make Harry cum by himself; he understood that it was different for people who had bodies similar to Harry’s, and that it was hard sometimes, and he was kind and helpful and sweet, doing all he could to help Harry whenever possible.
it?” Draco said, his cock sliding through Harry’s wetness with just shy of enough pressure to push inside him.
He let himself sink against the bed, moaning quietly. He wasn’t sure what to do with his other hand; he was using his wand arm to touch himself, and he awkwardly rested his left hand on his chest. His palm rubbed slightly against his dick as he curled his fingers in his cunt, and he hoped Draco wouldn’t scold him for it: that was the best position for his hand, and they both knew that he wouldn’t be able to cum like that anyway...but if Draco noticed, however, he didn’t say, so Harry was free to stay like that, with the heel of his palm gently pressing against the shaft of his dick.
And so Harry had sat still on his knees for nearly half an hour with Draco’s cock in his mouth and casual hand in his hair. It had taken an immense amount of Harry’s self control to not suck him off, and if he even swallowed or moved his tongue just a bit, Draco’s grip on his hair would tighten as if in warning. Harry was self-conscious at first about the saliva building up in his mouth. It wet his lips and eventually spilled down his chin, and he’d been impatient for the first couple of minutes, but it wasn’t too long before he relaxed and began to notice the lovely floating feeling he had come to associate with subspace.
“Why should I?” Draco murmured smoothly, his palm splaying over Harry’s lower back as a subtle reminder to stay still, be good, be good.
, this all-consuming. The fireworks were about to go off, and he desperately waited to see, see the gorgeous display of colors they had to offer him.

have to do the work,” Draco said. “Why would I do that when I’ve got you to make me feel good?” The tone of his voice made Harry want to apologize for suggesting something so stupid.
Harry couldn’t do anything more than blink at Draco helplessly and whimper, his mouth busy, and without warning, Draco took his fingers out of Harry’s mouth and slapped him across the face.
off, and so Draco genuinely liked to eat him out. Harry supposed it was for similar reasons to why he liked sucking Draco off, though from a dominant’s perspective...Draco liked Harry’s reactions — his little motions and noises — and knowing that
It strongly emphasized their power dynamic when Draco made Harry wait for something for no reason other than that he wanted to keep Harry on edge. Harry assumed that this was also what was currently happening with his newest secret — Draco wanted to know what it was, but he was more than willing to draw it out and make Harry admit it without being prompted.
But Draco wasn’t having it. He tightened his grip on his fistful of Harry’s hair and pulled his head back a bit, holding Harry firmly in place. “Tongue out,” Draco ordered, and Harry whimpered and obeyed as Draco took his cock and began to rub it against Harry’s tongue.
felt like. He remembered how, barely a minute in, Draco had reached up and grabbed Harry’s hands, holding them tightly as he continued to eat him out. Harry remembered how he had gripped Draco’s hands blindly, feeling overwhelmed by the affection and care that Draco was showing him and the pleasure that went along with all of it.
“If only there was something I could do….” Draco said apathetically, his nails briefly digging into Harry’s skin before he pulled away. “Too bad I can’t help,” he added, moving back so he wasn’t touching Harry, and Harry whimpered before he could stop himself.
— and had continued to spank him until Harry was so far gone in subspace that he couldn’t stand up without help. It didn’t take very long. Such was a wonderful example of a fun punishment. The “un-fun” punishments included orgasm or masturbation denial that lasted longer than a few hours, being repeatedly forced to help Draco get off without any relief of Harry’s own, or being pushed to the limits of how much embarrassment Harry could take. But even those were, of course, pretty damn fun.)
“Oh,” Draco said delightedly, apparently having picked up on Harry’s hesitation, “is there something else you want too, puppy?”
like that, he really could...just be there, at all hours of the day, just in case Draco wanted to use him, wanted a warm hole to put his cock in. And if he ended up pregnant, that was his fault for being so desperate and slutty, wasn’t it? It’s not like Draco would care if he ended up getting Harry pregnant — toys are for using, after all, and Harry had a cunt, didn’t he? He was made for it.
rather than the other way around. Draco seemed to take immense satisfaction in watching Harry confess something he desperately wanted yet also found intense embarrassment in admitting. Likely, Harry supposed, it was the extreme shifting of the scales in Draco’s favor that did it for both of them, especially Draco, who loved seeing Harry at his total mercy and wanting something that only
Now there was something he hadn’t thought about. “I think so,” he mumbled. “I don’t know what else it would be.”
He heard the fumbling, rustling sounds from behind him as Draco took off his clothes, and stayed silent, impatiently waiting for directions.
“I can’t believe how much you like it when I hurt you,” Draco condescended, and to prove his point, he pinched one of Harry’s nipples until Harry moaned. “Merlin, look how fucking wet you are. You’d do anything I told you.”
“I’m going to fuck you, and you’re not going to say a word,” Draco said. “Moans are fine,” he added, “since I know you can’t help it.” He smirked. “You know the safeword.”
The moments between Harry’s ask and Draco’s answer were always agony. There were two ways it could go. Draco either would grant him permission, the subsequent orgasm leaving Harry’s thighs shaking; or Harry would be refused. And if he was refused, Harry would have to choose between the
He felt Draco enter his mouth and had to stay still, unable to move if he wanted to. Held in place, Harry felt Draco begin to rock his hips slowly up from the mattress while simultaneously pulling Harry’s head down to meet him. His cock pushed slowly into Harry’s throat, and Harry tried his hardest to not gag. He couldn’t breathe, and it was
He let his mind drift further, and he could think of nothing more than their current states: his nakedness, vulnerability, desperation; Draco’s arousal, though completely hidden, and his domineering demeanor. Harry thought of how Draco was reading something for a book club that he and Hermione had started together. He thought of how he might as well not be there at all — he was allowed to neither speak nor move, and he was only there for Draco’s amusement. They did this on occasion: Draco busy responding to owls or finalizing an abstract or something of the sort, with Harry nearby, on display, just a pet. Sometimes Harry would be under a desk with Draco’s cock in his mouth while the latter worked. Sometimes he’d be curled on Draco’s lap, forced to sit still and ignore the cock filling him, while Draco read the news or even, on occasion, spoke on his mobile with a friend or colleague.
“I know what you want,” Draco continued. “I know what you think about, and you’re going to tell me.”
Harry dropped his arm and slid his hand between his legs. His dick was slippery from how wet he was, and he let out a choked whine as he began touching himself. He heard Draco’s breath hitch upon feeling Harry’s cunt clench, and something like pride rushed through him —
He slammed his eyes shut when Draco grabbed his calf, forcing Harry’s legs further apart. He adored being on display, even if he didn’t like to admit it to himself. It was so humiliating — worse when his cunt was soaked, like this — and Harry craved it.
Harry moaned, trying to move to get friction on his dick, but Draco held Harry still as he fucked him. “Fuck,” he rasped, “I need—”
Fucking hell, he loved when Draco did that. Little condescending comments, questions, little things he did to tease Harry, knowing all the while how embarrassing Harry found it all.
“Hm,” Draco said appreciatively, tapping the damp spot that had soaked through Harry’s underwear, “I was
Harry didn’t know what he was supposed to say, if anything, and he blushed, turning his head away again and hiding his face in the bed. He felt the dangling leash sway whenever he moved.
By the time he realized he hadn’t said anything to respond to Draco, it had been long enough that Draco knew his mind had been wandering.
Pleasure crashed over Harry, and it felt so good and was so shockingly out of nowhere that he forgot for a second to kiss back. But then he opened his mouth to let Draco’s tongue in, and the sensations surged through him even more strongly; he bucked his hips, trying to rub against what he thought was Draco’s knee between his legs, but found no further friction as his hips met empty air. He made a confused noise into the kiss at the same time that Draco’s tongue prodded his, and groaned when Draco slowly pulled away; the pleasure waned instantly. Harry automatically tried to follow the kiss, leaning up, but Draco smiled at him and gently held him down with a hand on his shoulder.
— make the decisions for him, do the important things, and he could just be content and happy and servile. And if there happened to be sex along with it, then that was all the better, he thought.
“Your cunt feels amazing, puppy,” Draco hissed as he pushed into Harry again, his voice husky. Harry groaned as Draco slowed his pace and pulled his hand from under them; he gasped out something incomprehensible that could have been
Every time Draco sucked him off, it felt like the first time. Draco’s mouth was warm and his tongue was wet and it felt
It felt amazing to have to do all the work. Despite Harry preferring to be on the bottom — not to mention
, so Harry relaxed and remained still, though he made a similar embarrassing noise every time Draco thrust inside him.
he was a mess again, his hair mussed and his lips a bit pinker than usual, but this time the part of his mind that cared was much quieter than the others. Draco looked him over for a moment, and then pressed gently on his shoulder.
He hoped that something like that wouldn’t happen now. There was no way he’d be able to focus on getting back to work if he hadn’t been allowed to cum — the submissive feeling would drive him crazy until he’d be squirming in his desk chair just to get some friction from his boxers.
“Yes,” Harry said mindlessly, and he sucked in a surprised breath when he felt the pleasant sensation of a vibrator press lightly against his dick. Draco must have conjured it, or...had it in his pocket? Maybe the latter, since it seemed to be a familiar one: one that Harry liked for its low, deep rumbling — rather than the buzzing of some others that served only to tickle him or make his dick numb. “Fuck….” he whimpered, pressing his hips up, and he groaned low in his throat when Draco’s fingers began to hook inside his cunt.
As Draco held him down, Harry became aware that his cunt had begun to clench and unclench itself around nothing. He was getting very low on oxygen, but, somehow, he found that he didn’t mind all that much. This was nothing like staying underwater for too long and running out of air, or anything of the like — this was pleasant, and Harry felt as though he could
Harry whined as he felt Draco’s tongue on his skin, and he let himself be held down and subdued. “It’s high up,” he said halfheartedly, and involuntarily bucked his hips to shift Draco’s cock inside him.
Draco worked in Diagon Alley, in a small store where they made and sold custom, made-to-order potions and spellwork.
Draco eased Harry off of his cock, smirking when Harry licked his lips and broke the line of saliva that had connected his mouth to Draco’s head. Harry was panting and still touching himself as Draco pulled his hair, forcing his head up to connect their eyes.
Harry moaned again and blinked his eyes open, and he saw Draco lean back a bit, still fucking Harry’s throat, to look at him. His eyes watered a bit, and his vision was a little blurry — he had to blink every few seconds to clear it — and he recognized this as a symptom of being overwhelmed with how much he loved what they were doing.
The pain was closer to bearable now, though he was still dying to be able to take things at his own pace. Draco continued to fuck him steadily, and Harry was held in place, denied control over anything. He couldn’t speak, and with Draco’s fingers in his mouth, he couldn’t focus enough to swallow, so he knew that his face was getting even messier as spit wet his chin. He didn’t know what to do with his tongue.
told Draco, and even if he skirted around it for however brief a time, Harry would always open up. It was his intention to do so only
Draco took Harry’s left hand and gently raised it in his own, touching his lips to Harry’s knuckles and, significantly, his wedding band. “What do you want?” he asked gently.
It was getting a little bit easier, now that Draco knew. Just a little. “Just...things? That a...a dog might have?”
Draco pulled his hair, dragging Harry off of his cock. Harry was panting, eyes shut tightly, and he could feel how wet his mouth was, hating that Draco could see how disheveled he looked. He made a miffed noise in the back of his throat.
Harry knew that Draco was just as likely — if not more so — to wait until, eventually, Harry came to
Instead of answering him, Draco let go of Harry’s chin and sat on his desk. He snapped his fingers; a blank purple memo sheet appeared, floating innocuously beside them at Harry’s eye level. Draco tapped it twice with his wand, and words began to appear on it in a replica of Harry’s handwriting.
He felt the sparks of orgasm starting to rise deep in his cunt, then in the body of his dick, and he felt himself shaking as his fingers desperately slipped over it.
He felt Draco’s tongue in his mouth, and whined. He was straddling Draco’s thigh, yet he hovered over it, afraid of what punishment might ensue if he got any of his wetness on Draco’s trousers. This was already difficult enough, seeing as Harry was dripping a bit, and it coated his inner thighs. Torn between playing it safe and letting himself grind shamelessly against Draco’s leg, Harry held himself awkwardly to avoid any repercussions. He moaned when Draco nipped his lower lip.
“Good boy,” Draco said, affection in his voice. He murmured something; Harry’s wand arm fell free from the chains. “That was the right answer. You can have both.”
Harry’s arm was twisted beneath him, his fingers between his legs. He felt a gentle weight atop him, a gentle pair of lips on the back of his neck, and a gentle cock inside him.
“It’s okay,” Draco said again, his hand moving to cup Harry’s cheek. “Whatever it is, it’s okay. I can help you. I’ll give you what you need.”
The leather collar vanished, indubitably sent back home to the drawer where they kept such items, and Draco tapped the new band with his wand.
unpleasant then you’re in for a rough next few minutes.” He pushed into Harry’s cunt, still holding the leash firmly, and moved slowly in and out a few times.
Upon thinking about that, Harry was reminded of the permanent collar that he now wore around his neck, the one inlaid with tiny diamonds and topazes, that said
It always felt like that when Draco pushed into him; even more so when Draco would pull out just to tease Harry before moving back inside him to fuck him again. It felt good, it felt right, and there was very little that Harry loved more than having Draco fuck him. (Close competitors, of course, included getting head,
Harry had what, he’d eventually learned, was called a breeding kink. “I would rather eat a hutch’s worth of fine china,” he’d said to Draco, “than get pregnant.” And this was why it had confused him. But now that Draco had found out, and incorporated the concept into their play a few times, Harry understood. Some things were just fantasy, and that was okay.
“You’re so pretty,” Draco said, and he slowly began to jerk off again, still resting his cock on Harry’s tongue. “You always look adorable when you look at me like this. I like getting to see your pretty eyes.”
The collar felt heavier than it normally did, and Harry let its weight and that of Draco’s hand push him down into the bed, feeling excited in a way that he hadn’t a few moments before. “What...
Harry nodded, his face still buried in Draco’s shirt. Draco smelled nice, Harry observed, like fresh sawdust and crackling fires and patchouli. He absently was comforted.
“It’s perfect on you,” Draco said, holding him tighter. “I knew it would be. You can wear it anywhere, it’s not conspicuous like the other collars. And it’s waterproof, won’t tarnish — nothing. And you can remove it if you need to, just tap the front with your wand and there’s a brief series of incantations, and then it’s off.” Draco listed the order of incantations, demonstrated once, and then the band was back around Harry’s neck where it belonged.
, he didn’t care. Everything was consumed by pleasure, every other thought drowned out by the frantic movements of his hand, and Draco’s cock inside him. The fireworks were beautiful, drawing Harry in...the colors leaped and raced, filling his whole body with sparks and plumes and petals, all for him, all for Draco.
“Some incident outside Mulpepper’s,” Draco said, smiling. His tone was casual but, by the look in his eyes, he could tell that Harry was feigning his indifference. “Closed down a third of the shops in Diagon Alley for the remainder of the day, but the rest of us might as well shut down too. Anything people need they’ll go elsewhere for. Nobody wants to be anywhere nearby when there’s bubotuber pus and poison ivy covering the whole road.”
feeling of slowing his fingers on his dick, his orgasm denied, or making himself cum anyway and having to endure whatever unpleasant punishment Draco deemed appropriate.
Harry didn’t have a good response, and so he rolled his eyes again and allowed Draco to help him back into his Auror robes and pants. Draco, who had evidently tucked himself into his trousers at some point — while Harry’s focus was elsewhere, presumably — had no dressing to do, and often remained mostly clothed during their sexual endeavors, so he turned his attention to Harry.
. Draco’s fingers stopped hooking inside him; now they straightened and moved slowly in and out of Harry’s cunt, providing little satisfaction.
“What’s this about?” Draco said casually, in a voice far too sweet and light for the deviously smug expression he wore.
At that moment, Harry became aware that he was gripping Draco’s forearm tightly, as if to ground himself amidst all of the intense sensations and emotions. He felt how hard Draco was inside him —
Harry was about to say something that would undoubtedly be extremely eloquent and romantic, but then Draco kissed him and he had no choice (or desire) other than to kiss back.
He made a quiet, happy sound when Draco licked into his mouth, and his hands rose tentatively to Draco’s shoulders. Draco held his face in one hand and lowered the other, slowly tracing down Harry’s chest and abdomen until he reached Harry’s dick. Harry gasped minutely when he felt Draco touch it, and heard Draco’s amused, pleased hum in response.
Harry was exhausted, but he smiled and hummed and thanked Draco. He felt arousal already creeping into his veins again.
Harry whined again, but he nodded and pressed back against Draco, who chuckled sleepily and moved his hand lower, cupping Harry’s small dick and sliding two fingers easily into his cunt. He laughed again when Harry moaned and ground against Draco’s palm.
“I want to kiss you,” he managed, shy for reasons he couldn’t put his finger on, and Draco smiled dazzlingly and crawled up Harry’s body to do just that.
He barely even knew that he had broken a rule when Draco slapped him hard across the face. It stung like mad, and Harry was sure that if he had been touching himself when Draco hit him, he would have cum instantly. His mind felt numb, and he blearily opened his eyes, whimpering.
Harry always got ridiculously wet from anything done to his ass. Draco loved to tease him; how much wetter he got when Draco fucked his ass, how his wetness would drip onto the bed — it was mortifying, and even more so when Harry was made to lick it up.
The fuses were dangerously short by this point — if someone wanted to put them out before the fireworks went off, they’d better do it quick, for it would only be moments before it was too late.
“There’s something else,” he said softly. He realized he was gripping Draco’s shirt much tighter than necessary. It would need an ironing charm later. “Not a name, but...could— could you call me puppy? Sometimes?”
It was overwhelming, Harry felt, to get told how he could top when he was currently trying to fuck himself on Draco’s fingers. He found it was not unpleasant in the least.
The movement of Draco pulling out felt good in and of itself, but Harry despised being empty, and he was mortified to feel Draco’s cum begin to drip from his ass. He groaned again, and slid a hand between his legs to rub his dick, but Draco pulled Harry’s wrist away and spoke in his ear:
“You’re fucking adorable,” Draco said from above him, and Harry made a noise of surprise when, all of a sudden, his collar appeared around his neck. Draco chuckled. “Just making sure you know where your priorities are,” he said smugly.
“Already jerking your little cock again even though you came just a few minutes ago?” Draco said, pulling Harry’s head down. “You’re so predictable.”
Harry moaned and bit the inside of his cheek in his effort to hold still as Draco moved in and out of him. Draco was watching him intently, Harry noticed, searching his face as if he wanted to burn the image into his mind.
And perhaps it was just the impatience talking, but Harry was pretty sure that Draco was drawing out the anticipation of the collar’s other functions solely because he
Neither man said anything for a long moment, a moment of terrible, silent anxiety that Harry was sure would kill him before age or illness ever got the chance.
“Fuck you,” he mumbled, and Draco took the opportunity of Harry’s lips parting to grip his hair and push forward, forcing his cock into Harry’s mouth. It tasted strongly of cum and his own wetness, and Harry resented that he moaned quietly when it overwhelmed his senses. His hands were free, and he brought them up to rest on the fronts of Draco’s thighs in order to steady himself. Draco towered above him, it seemed, and Harry knelt at his feet, as subservient as Draco wanted him but not without his own desires.
me to fill you up with my cum. But I’m not doing it for you. I’m doing it because I own your holes, and I can use them however I’d like.”
“Good boy,” Draco said, and he reached with his other hand to grab the short leash that still was fused to Harry’s collar, tugging him forward until his cock was touching Harry’s face. Harry felt the soft skin of Draco’s cock brush his cheek, and he whimpered, saliva already building in his mouth from the gag.
quietly, and he closed his eyes and tried to steady his breathing. The shame coursed through him and it took everything not to whine and beg Draco for something more.
Though he wasn’t yet as far gone as he’d been that time, disobeying was still the last thing on Harry’s mind. He was desperate to get fucked, to
Harry felt Draco’s fingertips dig into his hips, and he blearily heard Draco’s voice through the haze of his desperation: “You’ll have to tell me what you’re asking, Harry.”
Draco’s lips gently pressed against his, and Harry leaned up into him, grateful for the contact. He felt Draco’s fingers on his stomach and lower, until he was sighing when they gently dipped into his cunt. Harry opened his mouth when Draco’s tongue swept against his, and he let out a low moan as Draco withdrew his wet fingers and began softly rubbing them against Harry’s dick.
But the way Draco was sitting on his desk allowed his robes to fall open, and Harry saw one of his hands rest over the front of his trousers, and finally he was completely certain about what was going on.
get fucked — to lie back, helpless, while Draco took what he wanted from him. He wanted to be choked and roughed up, fucked full of cum before being left there, exhausted and still unallowed his own pleasure.
uncomfortable, but he still relished the intense submission he got from being used painfully. His desperation overrode everything else.
Harry hadn’t thought this through. He’d have to say everything, admit everything, and what if it wasn’t okay?
Draco stopped kissing him, but still gripped the leash hard, keeping their lips brushing together. “I think I might fuck your pretty little cunt,” he hissed against Harry’s mouth. “Now be a good boy and turn around for me so I can see your cute holes.”
. Not too long, not too short. The perfect size to occupy Harry’s mouth, and the perfect size to feel inside him without discomfort. And it was right there, when Harry’s mouth was watering and ready and—
Draco just grinned at him, the closest thing to a smirk that he’d worn since Harry had opened up about what he wanted. Without warning, Draco kissed Harry hard, and the world flipped over on itself:
“Can you show me something with the collar?” Harry mumbled, quickly and a bit bashfully, between quiet groans, and Draco kissed him again.
,” Draco said, pushing off from the wall with a roll of his eyes and walking over to where Harry still sat behind his desk, “you’re
But now, all Harry wanted to do was go lax with servility and meet Draco’s every desire. He wanted to be praised and degraded in the same sentence. He felt Draco’s fingers, slick from touching him, tease along his crura and perineum, and he whimpered. Draco continued: “Aw, look at you, baby, you’re so sweet and pretty when you get needy like this. You’re lucky you have me to take care of you, otherwise you wouldn’t know what to do with yourself.” He found the loop from the vibrator and pulled it slowly out of Harry’s cunt, spelled it clean, and tossed it to the foot of the bed.
It slid into him easily from how wet he was, and it was embarrassing how good it was to not be empty. He whined softly as he sank down around Draco’s cock, and he instantly started to rock his hips gently, savoring the feeling of being filled.
Harry obeyed. He thought he knew what was coming, but didn’t say so in case he was wrong, not wanting to give Draco further reason to humiliate him. Draco pulled his leash, gently forcing Harry to arch his back, and Harry felt Draco’s cock brush his inner thigh. He wanted to let his head fall so he didn’t have to think about how utterly embarrassing this was, but the taut leash held him in place, with his head up.
“Don’t tell me what to do,” Draco said coldly, and Harry fell silent with a whimper. “Do you want to touch yourself?”
Harry was dimly aware that his mouth was hanging open, and that the sounds that came from his mouth were just a jumble of moans, all in reaction to what Draco was doing to him.
This was the third interdepartmental memo in half an hour, it seemed, and Harry plucked the little plane from the air with irritation. The first had been from someone in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, asking if a small Auror squad could be put together as backup for an investigation of a hub of illegal beast trading. The second, from Hermione, discussing when the best time would be to hold the ceremony for the MACUSA ambassadors. And, the third:
Harry made a desperate noise and turned his head, trying to take Draco into his mouth to the best of his ability. The gag prevented him from actually giving a blowjob, as he couldn’t create any suction or close his mouth around anything, and he couldn’t cover his teeth because the ring was in the way — nevertheless, Harry loved having his mouth full and would do what he could to fulfill that desire.
Draco knew that Harry automatically felt more vulnerable when his arms were above his head because of how ticklish Harry’s underarms were. Harry hated it, but Draco knew that it made Harry struggle more when his ticklishness was at stake.
, the anxious part of Harry’s mind thought, but when Draco sucked hard on his dick once more, any other rational ideas he had were drowned out by pleasure. Harry bucked his hips again when Draco rubbed the outside of his cunt with two fingers, and he moaned when he felt those fingers slide into him. He was wet enough to ensure that there was no discomfort, and Harry could actually
Harry lifted himself a little, and he had to bite his tongue to stay silent when he felt Draco push his cock inside him.
“Look at that, baby,” Draco had said huskily into Harry’s ear, having already discovered Harry’s affinity for possessive nicknames. He wrapped an arm around Harry’s torso and began rubbing Harry’s dick through his underwear. “Look,
— at least, not anything like the extent to which Harry did — but Harry could tell if Draco was enjoying his mouth by whether or not he heard Draco panting by the time they were through.
And Harry suddenly found himself on his back, his arms pinned above his head, with Draco between his legs. Draco’s cock had slid from him in the process, and he pressed his hips up, searching blindly to be filled again. Harry tried to sit up, but Draco pushed him down, hissed something inaudible, and Harry found his wrists secured above his head by something that felt like a necktie. He whined, opening his eyes for the first time in a while, and let himself adjust to the lighting in the room.
when Draco expressed disappointment. Harry wanted to be good, to please Draco, and to be praised in return, even if the praise came in the form of degradation. But his disobedience never lasted long once Draco said something like “bad dog,” because it made Harry want to get to his knees and do everything for him.
head, being filled in both holes at once, and having his dick touched. But there was a time and place for everything.)
“Tell me which one you want,” Draco said coldly. “Like this, or I push you over, turn you around, and take you like that.”
“Exactly,” said Draco smoothly. “It’s a waste of energy for me to fuck you. You’re just a toy anyway, and it’s no use touching that useless little cock of yours. Might as well make yourself useful.”
place — the submissive’s place — to give pleasure, and now that he was getting sucked off while still being firmly dominated, he hardly knew what to do. He was glad that his hands were tied, thinking he wouldn’t be able to keep himself from touching Draco.
Suddenly, all too abruptly, Harry heard footsteps, and was jolted out of his mind when he heard Draco’s questing voice, too late and right outside the door.
. He’d tried to get her to send a memo if something was urgent, or tell him when he left at the end of the day if it was trivial, but she seemed to fear that the message wouldn’t find him or that she’d forget to mention it, so he often found himself interrupted by her when, really, the matter could have waited. He took a breath and dipped his quill, hoping that whatever she had to say wouldn’t take long. “I have to grade these, and you know the Minister’s been up my ass all week about the—”
