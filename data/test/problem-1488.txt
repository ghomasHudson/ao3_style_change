But one thing didn’t sit right with him, because Granger was there with Weasley, but Harry was no where to be seen. With another accessing look around the Great Hall, Draco was sure that Harry wasn’t there. But where would he be?
A cold hand landed on his shoulder and Harry jumped, disoriented for a moment before realising that it was Hermiones. “Let’s get inside, Harry.“, she said, her voice nothing more than a whisper. He nodded and pushed himself up, taking the wands from where he had dropped them before following them to the house. Dobby stayed at his side the whole time.
As soon as Draco stepped into he room, he knew that the crazy woman had been right, it is Harry Potter. Harry Potter with a swollen face, staring up at him out of one eye, missing his glasses. But it was him, without a doubt. It couldn’t be anyone else, even if he couldn’t see the scar on his forehead.
Warnings:
Harry pressed himself as close to the door as he dared and peeked inside. He couldn’t see much, only part of a stone wall and the left arm of Lucius Malfoy, gripping onto his cane. He couldn’t see Malfoy or Bellatrix, but he couldn’t hear the crazy woman’s laughter either, which may be a good sign. Just as he wanted to turn back to Ron again, a reflection on something silver caught his attention.
This feels very rushed, and I'm sorry about that. I kind of lost my interest and motivation for this story but I still wanted to bring it to an end. Hope you like it regardless, I still tried to end it in a good way.
Harry thought back to what had happened in the manor. Maybe it would have been better if they had taken Malfoy with them. He had said he would be alright, but what if they found out it was him. And the dagger that Bellatrix had thrown. The dagger!
Draco stayed silent and countless thoughts were racing through his head. This had to be a dream. Draco was sure it was a dream. Why would Harry Potter offer to forgive him, to start again? It didn’t make any sense. He blinked a few times and looked back to Harry. He seemed genuine and nervous.
His thoughts came to an abrupt halt and continued to circle around that one thought.
He entered the forest and followed the way that was just barely visible between the trees and plants all over the ground. He could hear Bellatrix’ cackling echoing between the tree trunks.
Malfoy? Harry sank back and landed on the sand, the residing water soaking his clothes. He couldn’t believe that he had doubted Malfoy’s intentions. Sure, he has the Dark Mark, and he was always antagonising Harry and his friends in school, but helping out Luna and making a plan with them, that had seemed genuine. And he didn’t kill Dumbledore. He was supposed to kill Dumbledore, but he didn’t. Now Harry was the one staring into the distance, trying to keep track of his chaotic thoughts.
They had promised Malfoy to wait for at least ten minutes before they went upstairs, so they wouldn’t raise any suspicion against him. Ron had been against it at first, but even he had to admit that it would be saver to keep Malfoy’s involvement out of it. Harry still couldn’t quite believe that he had helped them. It didn’t make any sense. Luna confirmed to them that Malfoy had actually brought food down every day or two, because the amount that they had gotten never would have been enough to sustain two persons and a goblin. But it seemed so out of character to Harry. Hadn’t Malfoy been against them the whole time? And did he really switch sides or is he just pretending?
Without really thinking about it he sprinted forward, right at Malfoy. Malfoy’s parents still didn’t really react to it, but it had to look realistic so Harry just grabbed Malfoy and threw him onto the ground. As soon as Malfoy had collided with the stone floor Harry gripped onto the wands and tried to rip them out of Malfoy’s hands. He resisted and Harry gripped on tighter, glaring at the boy lying underneath him. Malfoy glared right back and Harry got the bad suspicion that this was Malfoy’s plan all along.
The elf nodded at hearing his name and lifted the hand off his cheek. “Dobby came here to bring Draco Malfoy back to Hogwarts.“ The elf’s voice was enthusiastic but he sounded sad at the same time. Why would he be sad? But then the words properly registered in Draco’s head and the bad suspicion of something having happened at Hogwarts crept up on him.
“Arsehole.”
“I think I might have heard of that happening somewhere! I’ll go to the library and ask Madame Pince for any books she has on magical portraits!” Hermione scampered off to the library, leaving Ron and Harry in the common room.
Harry avoided Draco for the rest of the day, purposefully sitting as far away from him as possible in classes and trying not to look at him in the Great Hall.
“Fuck off.”
A few weeks after Ron’s experiment with the portrait, Harry got another vision of an open door instead of the normal dark cupboard. He stopped reading his transfiguration textbook and looked up at Ron.
“Well I’m sure glad I’m not crazy but that doesn’t make it any less weird. Thanks for looking though, Hermione, what would I do without you?”
“Someone’s in the cupboard!” he whispered “The cupboard with the portrait!”
“I never told you- er- I’m sorry. About that.”
The eighth year dormitory was set up similarly to Gryffindor tower, but decorated very differently. The common room had a much more neutral color scheme and had the Hogwarts crest on the walls instead of the Gryffindor lion. Most of them weren’t paying the room much attention, and were instead focusing more on the fact that they now had to share a dormitory with students from other houses.
“Oh um- yeah” said Draco, looking down at the sectumsempra scars across his chest
“I don’t even know why you’re so upset about the stupid portrait. You saved the entire bloody world last year so people would be talking about you, portrait or not. I doubt most of them even care about it.” Ron added, sitting entirely too close to Hermione.
“Well how about we hear it from one of them?” Zacharias shot another glare at the group of Slytherins
“Everyone deserves a second chance.” Harry whispered
“So you- you heard me?”
“No you wouldn’t! You’re famous Harry Potter, the savior of the wizarding world. Everyone loves you. You wouldn’t make the mistakes I did.”
“No I’m not! I mean er- nothing. I’m fine.”
One time, just after Harry dodged another question from a young Gryffindor, he realized something. He kept seeing the inside of a broom cupboard, which was probably where the portrait was being stored. What was strange, though, was that he had never gone and seen the portrait where it was hanging, yet he seemed to be able to see and hear what his portrait did. Harry didn’t know much about the magic of Hogwarts portraits, so naturally he went to ask Hermione.
Ron went a little pink, but Harry wasn’t sure why.
After chatting with Harry for a while, Neville gave Luna a kiss on the cheek and said that he had to go meet with Professor Sprout about an exotic plant that they were getting delivered. This left Luna and Harry alone by the lake.
“Woah mate really? What did you see?” asked Ron.
The start of the school year was as normal as it possibly could have been. Harry went to class, which was different because he now had a lot of classes with the seventh year students. One thing that Harry had not predicted was the number of teenage girls who hoped to take advantage of the fact that Harry was single and ready to mingle. Apparently, being the savior of the whole wizarding world made him somewhat more attractive to adolescent witches than he had been considered in the past. Part of Harry wanted to say yes to them, but as Hermione often told him, “they only want you because you're THE Harry Potter, they don’t even know you!”
“You needed someone. I’m here.”
Harry had tried to talk to Ron and Hermione about how ridiculous it was, but they were taking a different approach than Harry about coping with the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War. Where Harry was trying to avoid the limelight by more or less becoming a hermit in Number 12 Grimmauld Place, Ron and Hermione must have been making up for lost time or something because they usually had their mouths occupied by things other than Harry’s qualms with portraiture. Because he couldn’t get any backup, Harry begrudgingly agreed after many a conversation and owl correspondence to have a portrait made but with a few terms: The portrait was to be hung in a broom closet on a side hallway and nobody was to be told of its existence until Harry was graduated from Hogwarts after his eighth year.
“The fact that you are so upset about it proves that you are not a monster. You did what you had to do to save your family. But Voldemort is gone now. You can make your own decisions. Just decide who you want to be.” Draco didn’t say anything, and instead just looked out at the stars. “Look, there you are, Draco,” Harry said pointing at the dragon constellation in the sky.
“Draco. You keep watching him and he clearly wants to talk to you too.”
“That doesn’t make it okay! You have no idea the things I have seen and done. He lived in my house. He made me kill for him. He made me a monster!” He dissolved into sobs again.
“Because I’ve been there. I have thought I was a monster and had people think the same of me. I have had my name slandered and my friends turned against me. I know how much it hurts. You need help. I can help you.”
“It was weird, mate. It was like talking to you, except not. It looked like you but only said what someone who didn’t know you very well would think you would say. It tried to disarm me when I came in! I didn’t do anything and there he went! Expelliarmus!”
“Er- Right.”
“Oh you know, people talk. I think it's incredible though! I can tell my kids when they go to Hogwarts to say hi to Harry for me, imagine that!”
“Yeah I checked that the coast was clear before I went in. When I came out Malfoy was walking by but that was it. If he heard anything, at least he probably won’t go around telling any first years.”
“I can see everything that portrait sees. I can hear everything it hears. I get flashes during the day and then I see everything in my dreams.” Draco was silent, as if he was realizing just how much Harry knew.
Harry wasn’t sure why, but he didn’t want to tell Ron about Malfoy. Maybe it was because Harry knew Ron was holding more of Draco’s past against him than Harry was and he would probably suspect ill-intent, or maybe Harry just wanted to investigate on his own. Either way, Harry grabbed a scroll of parchment and headed back down to the common room to finish his homework for the night and ponder over what in Merlin's name Malfoy could be doing with his portrait. He got a couple more blurry glimpses of the closet, but nothing concrete enough to piece together a theory.
“What- no!” Harry denied, then sighed. “How did you know?”
“Come on Smith, the war isn’t over until we stop fighting it.” Harry said, even though he was still slightly wary of some of the other Slytherins.
Instead of reacting, Malfoy and the other Slytherins just glared at Zacharias and remained huddled together at the back of the group.
Draco exited the room with the portrait and started walking quickly away. Harry watched closely where he was going. Draco’s name moved across the old parchment towards the astronomy tower, where he stopped. Draco stayed in the astronomy tower until Harry fell asleep.
“I don’t hate you, Draco.” The name felt strange on his lips after years of calling him by his surname. “I don’t blame you, you know. I probably would have done the same thing in your position.”
Hermione got back from the library after an hour or so, seeming triumphant with a stack of books in her arms.
“I welcome each and every one of you to Hogwarts, and this year more than ever I am so happy to see all of you safe. These past few years have been devastating for so many people, and I hope that finally we will have peace enough to begin to move on. I know that this year is going to be a process of growing, healing, and rebuilding for all of us. I ask that we remember those we have lost and the sacrifices that were made, but also that we do not dwell in the past. We must keep moving forward and to do that we must eliminate past grudges and understand that we are all rebuilding together.” Many wary eyes fell on the Slytherin table, who were significantly more subdued than Harry remembered them being in his younger years at Hogwarts. “I also ask that you treat everyone as equals and remember that everyone here is here to learn, regardless of their name or accomplishments.” At this, most of the eyes turned from the Slytherin table to Harry instead, where he stared into his potatoes. “Many changes have had to have been made this year, firstly I am your new Headmistress and Professor Flitwick the new deputy headmaster. We have new teachers in Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Muggle Studies, as well as changes to accommodate the lack of instruction received last year. Curriculums have been revised, and as many of you have noticed, there are many returning to finish their NEWTs. All eighth year students will not be living in their house dorms, but instead in the new eighth year dorms constructed in the South Tower. This will be a wonderful opportunity to get to know students from other houses, and it is imperative that you do so because we must stand together in order to rebuild. Division is what caused the war, and unity is the only way we can ensure we do not make the same mistakes again.”
That night, the dream was even more clear. This time, Draco started apologizing again but soon sacrificed words for silent tears before leaving for the night. Harry woke up feeling so much sympathy for him. How could he help him?
“Yeah that's a good idea! How about I stay here and you go and talk to my portrait and I will see if I can tell you what you said? It is in a cupboard near the prefects’ bathroom.”
His eyes darted to the fifth floor near the prefects’ bathroom and found the cupboard where his portrait was kept. Eyes widening, his suspicions were confirmed. Draco Malfoy, the map read. Harry wasn’t sure what to think. What could Malfoy be doing there? Harry figured he would just have to wait until that night to see what business Malfoy had with Portrait-Harry.
Harry placed his lips on Draco’s and kissed him. Draco jumped but then leaned into it, wrapping his arms around Harry and pulling him closer.
“I- are those- did- I” Harry stammered, tearing his eyes from the boy’s stomach and up to his tired-looking face.
Of course, rumors about Harry's portrait continued to circulate the school. After a few weeks of searching without any success, some of the younger students started trying to get answers out of Harry himself.
“Why would I want to talk to you?”
Now that Harry thought about it, maybe this was nothing new. He definitely hadn’t let himself think about it during the war, and he was busy dating Ginny anyway. But before that, Harry realized how often he watched Draco in the Great Hall over the years and how much the two of them had gone out of their way to get on the others’ nerves. As long as Harry was convinced that Draco was evil he didn’t let his mind go there. But now that Draco was repenting for everything he had done, Harry was finding himself in a surprising place. Draco was certainly very attractive.There was one problem, though. Harry didn’t like boys. Although now that was sounding like further and further from the truth.
“Why are you here? How did you find me?” He paused. “Why?”
“Boys are not very good at being subtle, you know.”
“And you believe me? That I’m sorry?”
“Not really, why? You’re not still worried about that are you?”
“Yes.”
“Just the inside of a broom cupboard like in weird flashes throughout the day, and then at night I dream I can see the cupboard and hear anything that went on outside of it that day. I’m not positive if it's the portrait but why else would I be dreaming of a broom cupboard?”
“Relax, Harry. Everyone will have forgotten about this by next week! Besides, you’ve dealt with much worse and you know it.” Hermione said after they found an empty compartment on the Hogwarts Express as an escape from the looks of awe and admiration from younger students in the corridor. One Hufflepuff third year had actually asked for his autograph as he was climbing on to the train, which made Harry walk swiftly in the other direction, leaving the poor thirteen year old empty-handed.
His voice broke. “Why?”
“Yeah. I do.”
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
“Again with the heroics. You still haven’t told me how you found me.”
“Why is it always Malfoy? But anyway, I saw you! I didn’t hear anything but I got flashes of you in the doorway when you came in. Maybe tonight I’ll dream of whatever you told me?”
“You’re right, it wasn’t okay, but that doesn’t mean you can’t come back from it. The war is over Draco. I forgave you. It's time you forgave yourself.” Harry said, nearing a whisper. He was sitting down now, with his hand on the other boy’s back.
“What do you want?” Draco snapped
“To talk,” Harry said quietly.
They stood there for another moment too long before awkwardly walking opposite directions. Harry walked over to the mirror and looked at his bright red face. What was wrong with him?
Harry had tried- really tried- to change her mind about this because he “just wanted to be normal now” and he “already had his name in enough history books and news articles that nobody would be forgetting him any time soon,” but McGonnagal was adamant.
They headed up to their rooms to crash after the long train ride. Harry was struck by how normal it seemed sharing a room with Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus. Harry relaxed into the easy banter with Ron, and into Dean and Seamus endlessly flirting, and soon found himself drifting off to sleep.
“What? Who?”
“But why would you want to listen to me? You hate me!”
They were interrupted by a knock on their compartment door and a glimpse of blonde hair made Harry think it was time for the annual jeering comment from Malfoy on the train which usually ended up in someone being held back for risk of attacking the other. Harry just knew that the coming remark would be something along the lines of “I heard you got a portrait of yourself painted, Potter! Just can’t help yourself, can you? I bet you’ll have the thing prancing around the school reminding everyone of just how important and famous you are, won’t you?”
He arrived outside the door and heard what sounded like the end of a conversation. Draco was yelling this time. Suddenly, the door opened and Draco stormed out, his face red and puffy. Harry made sure his invisibility was covering him and held his breath. Draco walked swiftly with his head down; Harry followed far enough behind that he wouldn’t be heard, but close enough that he didn’t lose him.
Harry was sitting by the lake with Luna and Neville. He and Ron had just finished a game on the Quidditch pitch and now Ron was off with Hermione, and had asked that Harry leave them alone for the afternoon. Third wheeling two separate couples was really starting to seriously blow.
Ron got back before Hermione.
Harry was never in it for the glory. He was especially not in it for the glory in the moment that Professor McGonnagal approached him and said that she wanted a portrait of Harry made and hung in the school to commemorate his little act of heroics in the past year.
That night, Harry found out why Ron had gone pink earlier. Harry learned all too much about Ron and Hermione’s love life in his dreams, and the first thing he did when he woke up was to throw a pillow at Ron’s face.
Most of Harry’s ideas on what Draco might be doing had something to do with mocking Portrait-Harry or trying to get information out without talking to the real Harry. He had not imagined that in his dream he would be watching a teary-eyed Draco delivering a disjointed, emotional apology to Harry for all the terrible things he had done. Harry wasn’t able to recall every detail, but it was something along the lines of that Draco didn’t know who else to go to since he didn’t have any real friends and that Harry hated him anyway so he wouldn’t listen to him. He apologized for being a death eater and for doing Voldemort’s bidding and for being a prat all those years.
“You don’t have anyone to talk to.”
“But how? I was terrible to you for years! I was a prejudiced piece of shit! I was a fucking death eater! Nobody else believes me that I regret everything! Why should you?”
“You don’t get it though. You were always right. I was always wrong. People didn’t just think I was a monster, I was a monster! I still am!”
“Apparently it is incredibly rare, but sometimes the subjects of portraits can somehow share consciousness with their portraits when they are in close proximity to them! It is not well documented because it doesn’t happen often and many of the subjects of the paintings are dead. I don’t think it should bother you too much. Maybe just a lot of dreams of broom cupboards but besides that it's really nothing. So I don’t think you’re crazy! Maybe you should talk to Professor McGonnagal if you want to know more since I know she already has her headmistress portrait.”
After that, school mostly went on as normal. Normal meaning like actually normal, not normal for Harry which usually involved facing Lord Voldemort or nearly dying. Eighth years weren’t able to play quidditch, but he made sure to get out on his Firebolt as much as possible. He usually played with Ron, and Ginny had even started joining them. In the eighth year common room, there was still tension between the Slytherins and most of the other students, but nothing had happened that suggested any shower jinxing was happening. Zacharias was always sure to broadcast that he was putting wards on the Hufflepuff room and that if anyone tried anything he would make sure there were repercussions. Harry wasn’t sure how to tell him that he was the one being ridiculous, and that the Slytherins were keeping to themselves.
“But you still love me!”
“Hey Hermione, have you read any books about magical portraits?” Harry asked after accidentally breaking up a moment between her and Ron.
“I promise I’m fine!” Harry shouted before staring at his food and ending the conversation. Ron and Hermione exchanged a worried look before changing the topic.
“Relax, Harry, it’s probably just Filch getting a mop,” chided Ron.
The next night, Draco was back. Harry sat on  his bed with the Marauder’s Map open in front of him. He wasn’t sure why he cared so much that it was Draco talking to his portrait. He wasn’t sure why he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about Draco since he woke up that morning. He wasn’t sure why he was so fascinated by his shirtless body and how his light blonde hair fell in his grey eyes while he was in class. He wasn’t sure why it took so much effort to avoid him and to stop thinking about him. Bloody hell. Harry knew why.
“Why do you care about me? I don’t deserve it.”
After that conversation, Harry doubled down his efforts of Not Looking At Draco. It didn’t seem to work much, because he just kept noticing things about him. He seemed so different than he had in the past, so much more vulnerable and reserved.
Even though Seamus meant well, Harry was regretting agreeing to this more and more.
“We won’t do anything to you if you don’t do anything to us!” Pansy Parkinson snapped.
The two of them had tried to make it work again after the war, but it became immediately evident that it just wasn’t happening. Where Ron was coping with the loss of his brother by attaching himself to Hermione, Ginny didn’t want to deal with a relationship on top of her grief. Harry didn’t blame her at all and he himself was also not in a place for a relationship, so they mutually called it off and ended on good terms. That didn’t mean that things weren’t awkward between them, so he had seen little of the fiery red head since then.
“Harry’s right, we all have to get along somehow! Everyone’s just here to finish their NEWTs and I doubt anyone wants to keep thinking about the war.” Hermione added
Eventually Hermione convinced Zacharias and the others that the only option was to try to be civil to everyone. Harry was surprised by how much she agreed with him, given her history with Malfoy, but thought that maybe she had come to the same conclusions as he had over the summer.
“Trust me.”
The portrait was kept a complete secret, so naturally the whole school knew. The moment Harry stepped onto Platform 9¾, he knew he was right to worry.
“I didn’t ask to be the boy who lived! Everything I did was to make sure that my parents didn’t die for nothing. You did everything to protect your family. You just happened to be stuck on the wrong side of a war.”
Harry woke up dumbfounded. How could Draco Malfoy, the death eater, be giving tearful repentance to a talking portrait of Harry Potter? Harry wanted to talk to Draco about it, but then he would have to reveal that he had seen, which was the opposite of what Draco probably wanted. Instead, Harry decided to mind his own business and not embarrass Draco. That didn’t exactly go as planned.
From what Harry remembered from his dream, Draco wanted to talk to Harry in person but he didn’t think he would listen. Harry decided to muster all the Gryffindor courage he had, take off the invisibility cloak, and climb the stairs.
After a week of avoiding Draco, Harry got another flash of blonde in the cupboard. For reasons he couldn’t quite explain, he gave half hearted excuses to Ron and Hermione before grabbing his invisibility cloak and hurrying down to the room with his portrait.
“Whether you want to acknowledge it or not Mr. Potter, you have done more for our school and for the wizarding world than most any other wizard this century. It would be a pity for our school to not have you memorialized on its walls. Besides, our portraits can meet for tea every fortnight if they wish; it would not be lonely!”
“Yeah, I guess. Hey, I’m going to run to the dorm and get some parchment- I’ll be back in a moment.” Harry hurried to his room and dug through his trunk for the Marauder’s Map. He closed the grey curtains on his bed.
Harry saw a head of blonde hair, but elected to drop it with Ron and to investigate on his own.
“Oh God. I don’t want to talk to myself, that would be so weird. Did you make sure nobody saw you?”
“I know, I know! But the fact that I got a portrait done makes it look like I enjoy the attention.”
The next few days, Harry tried his best to avoid seeing Draco for fear that his face would reveal too much. Were people able to tell that every time he walked into a room Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off of him? He thought he was being subtle.
He didn’t get an answer, not that he had expected one, but he heard Luna telling them to take a step back. To his surprise, they actually did, and Draco was able to take a look at the room. Wormtail wasn’t standing directly in front of the door, to his relief, but he couldn’t be far. Harry still had a hand on Weasley’s shoulder and Luna was standing a few steps behind them. Ollivander was sitting on the ground to her right and the goblin was nowhere to be seen. Draco was actually glad about that, he didn’t like the creature.
Draco sighed and went to get up from his place. He wouldn’t want to have him here, he was sure of that. Why would Harry Potter want to spend any amount of time in the presence of the Deatheater that had only recently decided that he wanted to help his side?
With that, he turned around, not waiting for an answer.
"But why? You can look intimidating, to be honest. And you have the body type to be in the police."
"Ginny almost spit the tea."
"Yeah, we don't need the help of our Saviour, we can defend ourselves." Replied Zabini.
"Our favor for winning. I asked the team after your confession then I asked McGonagall for the right to apparate outside the castle for the rest of the day."
"We don't have time for this, we need to get our broom!" Hissed Malfoy when he grabbed Harry's arm to make him move.
"I must know that there is a special room for that kind of request." This time McGonagall's attention landed on Harry who knew exactly where she was thinking but they never went in that room since the war. "I don't want to hear any fight. You're old enough to know better."
"Seriously? What did they say?"
"He died last May. I— I want to continue what he always wanted to be. In his honour."
When he reached the door of the classroom he took a deep breath before opening the door, his hand tightly gripping his bag. People from his year were talking or introducing themselves to each other in a circle of chairs. The walls of the room were full of pictures and posters of people, nature and other things. It was a warm and welcoming atmosphere.
"Before the war, you know that!"
"Hi." She made a small smile and kept her eyes on the Black Lake. "So, Ron or Malfoy?"
"I'd know, he's my best mate Gin!"
"I miss you.." Breathed Harry between moans. He couldn't resist kisses on his neck.
The professor whistled again then set free the Golden Snitch and the Bludgers. Harry looked vaguely at the snitch only to observe his rival's Seeker. It took him only a second to understand they were still determined because a Ranclaws girl and a Hufflepuff boy looked at the snitch fiercely, trying to keep it in sight.
"He's just checking if his crush is okay guys, let him be!"
Kingsley had already proposed to give him a job as Auror. Few years ago he would have been pleased but now.. now he doesn't know. He couldn't stand to be another soldier. Another puppet fighting against the evil guys.
"I'll talk to McGonagall tomorrow."
"Well. I hope everyone has arrived." The voice of the Headmistress made Harry stop fixing the Blond boy and give his attention to the professor. "Like I said earlier we will proceed to the sorting of the new students. Now as you can see, older students will take place here as well to finish their 7th years because of.. well the war."
Malfoy's voice made both Gryffindor jumped in surprise before facing the blonde Slytherin.
Ron let's Harry go and face the Slytherin correctly. Harry wanted to hug his lover and comfort him but this wasn't his moment right now. Both his best friend and lover needed to talk seriously about that. If he wanted both in his life, he needed to stay put.
This year was definitely the best year Harry had ever had.
"I.. we need to talk. Alone. Please."
Ron looked at him and Ginny for a second, wondering what the ex couple would talk to before Hermione grabbed his arm and pushed him away.
"Did you plan to pass the selection?" Asked Ron interested.
"Very well." The professor turned to face the men but Harry shrugged his shoulders, not knowing what was that about. "What do you want, Mister Malfoy?"
"I.. don't know."
"Always."
"Sorry, I didn't mean to ruin the mood like that!" Harry added quickly.
Weasley is our king!"
Zacharias Smith took the ball and flew rapidly to the goals but Goyle saw it in time and trew a Bludger on him. The Chaser saw it come and changed his way only to be caged by Malfoy and Zabini, an old and good strategy of theirs. They pushed him until they were close to a tower and then let him fall on the tapistry like the Slytherins used to do.
"I’ve never held a camera until this summer”, Harry confessed, looking down at his bag. "A friend of mine used to take pictures of people all the time so I thought... "
"What tension? We have hated each other for years!"
The noises of brooms flying towards them made them silent before Harry sighed and turned to face his team.
"But..you would tell me if you had a..have you the dot for the git?"
"Seriously Potter, I thought you were brave enough to face that."
"Used to? Did he…?" Colin trailed off, sadness flashing through his black eyes.
"Thanks.. about keeping the secret."
"Chill up Weasley. We've been dating for years! I think Harry knows my feelings better than you now!" Replied Draco in with a smirk.
"So you're saying that your best friends are some kind of police agents and you didn't want to join them?" Gabe asked incredulously before Darcy could ask one of her many questions.
"It was in the moment. It meant noth-"
People around him started shouting and laughing, bringing him back to reality. Harry looked at the crowd and was happy to notice they were all mixing groups. Harry took his camera out to capture some moments of the night and walked around, taking pictures of people, the forest, and the campfire itself.
"And that kiss on the stairs that day? Before your last-"
"Well, each eighth year's house students could make a team and so we could play against each other!"
It took me some serious willpower not to be too excited and told him that that would be nice.
Will be fun to watch him instead of competing against him. I hope other people won't notice me looking at him most of the game though...
I slept is his arms and never felt so safe.
I leave the arena but decide to stay in the hallway close to the lockerrooms. Harry is the last one to leave. He sees me and stops. "Eh hey, thanks for coming today. I feel like you gave me some good luck." Harry smiles.
The question interrupts my thoughts and I stammer: " Uhm yes! We are going to finish them!" Questioning what I meant by that.
"She told us she actually is in love with Luna. Did you see that coming? Is it okay though for me to say they look really adorable together? I just saw them hanging out." Hermione says.
"No need to be so agressive Potter, I wanted to congratulate you." Draco said. "You were great out there." he added.
Draco leaves me behind stunned. What did just happen??? I decide to go to the nurses room before I talk to Ginny. To take care of the scratches and I take out my phone to text Ginny. "Ginny, I need to talk to you, can you meet me at the brigde in an hour?"
"Hey Harry!" I turn around. "Oh! Hey Ginny." "Haha did I scare you? You are blushing." She giggles and the gives me a kiss on my cheek. "I quess I'm just a bit tired from the game. Do you mind if I go?" "Oh, no sure! That's okay. I'll talk to you later then!" She says.
On my way to the library I feel guilty. I should tell Ginny the truth. She deserves that. "Hey Ron, Hi Hermione." "What did Malfoy want?" Hermione asks. "Nothing much, he actually told me I played well." "Haha, bloody hell Harry, and you believe that he meant that?" Ron laughs. "Oh well, at least he wasn't mean to me. Could have gone worse." And I leave it at that. We spend the rest of the day reading and making homework. Since we have a test this upcoming Monday.
We say our goodbyes and get on the train. My head goes back to last year. I wonder if he'd changed. If he'd look even better. Shoot. I should stop thinking about him. He hates me. I bet he would kill me before you know who got the chance. "Harry... Harry!... HARRY! I'm startled. Yes, Hermione? "Jeez Harry, you are with your head in the clouds! I asked if you wanted a piece." She shows me the bar of chocolate and I break off a piece. When I look up I see him walk by. His almost white hair in front of his eyes. I feel the butterflies storm through my body. He looks our way, and I swear he stares right into my eyes for a second that I wish would last forever.
"Ofcourse!" And I hug her. We say goodbye and I find my way back inside looking for Ron and Hermione. Not sure If I should tell them.
How am I supposed to focus?
We won! Gryffindor won! It didn't feel like that, I don’t want to win like this. Draco lost focus for a second. Why? I couldn't let that chance slide though.
H POV
"Ha, yes we know, they are bloody annoying." Ron laughs. "Ginny wasn't easy either this time though. She kept talking about you Harry!"
Gryffindor won.
Sunday
When I get there I can see her waiting for me already. ”Hey.” She says. She looks at me. "I see Hufflepuff gave you a hard time out there? Also, you are here to break up with me aren't you?" I don't know wat to say. Which actually gives her the answer.
Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for us there.
Suddenly I feel two arms around my waist. "Hi Harry, you actually are here." Draco whispers.
"You are way better then him Harry, you shouldn't let him see that he scares you." Hermione says.
I still feel the butterfly's racing, the face he made after running into me made me smile. I wonder what he was thinking about so deeply that he didn't see me standing there. Must have been very important.
He looks around and says, surprisingly in a much softer tone, "Just please watch where you are going, unless you preffer running into me." He doesn't give me a chance to say anything back and walks past. His arm touching mine while passing me. Leaving me stunned. I can feel myself getting sick from the butterflies in my stomach. After standing there for what seemed to be an eternity I go on to my way to the toilet. Making sure I look less flustered before returning to Ron and Hermione.
I turn around and look him in his eyes. For a moment time seems to stop. "Can I kiss you" I ask. He nods and before I know it I feel his soft lips against mine. It seems like fireworks are taking over from the butterflies. I can feel our tongues finding each other and I have never felt so happy, this is what I've been waiting for for so long. I slowly move my lips to his cheek, to the end of his jaw and go down to his neck. I can feel Draco's hands moving down a bit. He sights. I kiss his neck softly. He does the same.
The place looks amazing. There are candles flying eveywhere. There is a fireplace soft music a couch and a bed. I feel myself getting nervous.
”Ahw, Harry! You really like her don’t you! I can see you blushing!” Hermione bumps her shoulder against mine. If only did she know...
When we get inside people from all houses are, as always at their own tables. Dumbledore welcomes us all and the new young wizards get sorted by the sorting hat.
”What do you want Draco?”
I'm about to get on the field and already can see Harry standing there. I see him looking at me and I quickly look away. I wonder what he thinks.
On the other hand. Harry is too sweet to do that. Would he keep it a secret if I ask him?
Professor Snape ends the evening by telling us that for this year two houses will be taking the classes at the same time due to the fact that we don’t have enough teachers. When he then proceeds to tell that Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw will be joining for classes which means that Slytherin and Gryffintor will be joining classes. My heart jumps. This will mean I'm seeing Draco at every class!
"I'll be a chaser Potter." Harry looked at him in surprise. "What ? You're a better Seeker than me, we're on the same team now and I want to win for once."
Harry wasn't sure what to say. He couldn't say he was a wizard or that he had fought in a war that left him alone and depressed.
"I love you too, Dar."
"Yeah, something like that."
"Nah, I don't think so. He doesn't know that I'm into guys and I don't know if he is either."
Everyone started panicking or running to take their broom to the locker but when the Gryffindors and Slytherins saw Harry hadn't moved yet they looked at him questionably.
And sometimes Ron, Hermione or Dean and Seamus even pushed him so he fell on the blonde.
He didn't realise that he was talking really loud because once he looked at the professors' table he could see all the faces looking at him in shock. He rolled his eyes and waved discretely to the Headmistress so she could continue the ceremony.
"Good job, Potter." Draco whispered, brushing his lips against the Gryffindor's.
"He's more like a brother to me, Ronald."
"He almost killed me mate! And you knew it!"
"Harry, can I talk to you for a second?"
"Shut up Malfoy", Harry said automatically.
"What ? They tried to give Harry to You-Know-Who!" Scoffed the red-haired girl.
"I.. Er.. walk slowly?" Tried the Gryffindor when his friends saw him.
"Ginny !" Gasped Hermione in shock.
Ginny didn't say a word and left right away. Harry took that opportunity to grab the blonde and kiss him as a proper greeting.
"You should tell them Harry."
Malfoy wanted only the Eighth year to the party but Dean suggested it would be better if everyone could come and celebrate the first victory. As he said "there will be other matches this year so one of them will be Eighth years only." And Draco accepted that. After their coming out as a couple, people were more inclined to fraternise with the others.
Before someone else could speak, however, the door opened and a middle-aged woman who reminded Harry of Luna, walked into the room.
"I know.. I'm sorry. Ron and Hermione wouldn't let me alone!"
"Another year, another reason to be a freak.." sighed the black-haired man.
The pitch and bleachers were filled by students of all the eighth years' houses, waiting for Headmistress McGonagall  to make an annonce. Harry convinced her to let them play and as expected she thought about mixing two houses so each house could play.
Harry took that at his advantage and turned hard to his right to make a little detour before coming back on track. That destabilised her a moment but she saw the Golden ball and flew toward it without hesitation now.
“Yes, his name was Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. He turned out to be as lost as I was in secondary school but he wasn’t really surrounded by ‘good people’, if you know what I mean.”
"And what about Ferret?"
"Wait, what ?" Harry snapped into reality right away. " Did you just say, right now? But we didn't have time to prepare a strategy or-"
Harry couldn't protest because having Draco jealous was hot and he didn't see him in months. He wanted to have Draco just for him, showing the world that he was just a child on the wrong side and that he was Harry's.
"Well, it's about time."
"Why do you want to become a professional photographer, Harry?" Colin asked, a little too loudly because now everyone was looking at him.
One arm away.
Ron opened his mouth to say something but nothing came. Instead they all start eating in silence at first then they chat about Quidditch. Ginny was the new Captain but none of the eighth years were authorized to play.
Gabe nodded as Harry took his car keys from his pocket. He was glad he took time to pass his driver’s licence the past summer. It was mainly because he could have time for himself and to think while driving on the roads.
"Oh, you must be Harry Potter!" Harry flinched and looked at the girl who said it. "You're the last student to arrive. You're almost late. Were you lost?"
Draco captured his lips again and Draco pushed Harry across the hallway and pushed him against the wall. It was dangerous, they could be seen but that was the point. Danger was always more exciting.
Before he knew it, Harry’s body moved and he took a picture of the blonde chatting vividly with two men and a woman. However, Harry forgot he had turned on the flash of his camera and now the four people had turned their heads to face Harry.
"I'm Colin, by the way. Nice to meet you, Harry!"
"No, it's with the whole university. So we can get to know other people from all classes and make friends."
At the moment the Slytherin opened his mouth to say something, Harry moved forward and pressed his lips on the other. The moan who followed in his ears pleased Harry and then he pushed the man against the wall.
Harry didn't know how to respond. He wasn't even sure if this was a good idea but he wanted to be something that people wouldn’t expect him to be. He had enough of fighting for a lifetime. It was when he found Colin's camera at Hogwarts, after the Battle, that he knew he wanted to show the world that beauty and peace could be found everywhere, in everyone. Like Colin used to do.
"Pansy is hot, don't you think?" Said Dean one night.
"Stop calling him that!"
"What do you want, Gin?" Said Harry walking away from the Great Hall.
Draco's hairs were not with pristin this time but even if he had lost his fame he looked really elegant on his robe. He looked healthier than he was last year but he lost his confidence Harry admired in their first years.
"Harry is with us. What's your problem, man?" Gabe's powerful voice sounded from behind Harry.
They stood at the door leading into the basement, barely daring to breathe while waiting for the time to pass. Harry couldn’t hear any sounds from Wormtail yet, and he hadn’t moved since they had thrown him into the cell, so he still seemed to be out cold for now.
Harry had fallen out of Hagrid’s arm and he was standing. He was alive.
Without hesitation Harry gripped onto Ron and Dobby and the elf disapparated with them. But just before they disappeared Harry looked back at Bellatrix again and he saw a dagger in the air, flying at them at an impressive speed. But he couldn’t do anything. The next moment everything warped around him and then his knees crashed into wet sand.
He didn’t feel like moving. Draco let out a huff and then he wished that he didn’t because it hurt in his ribcage when one of his broken ribs moved painfully. He started to wonder why they didn’t just kill him. He was no use for them now, right? He had helped Harry Potter and his friends escape. He aided the prisoners all this time and helped them to get out of here.
Harry looked back to Ron and his friend nodded. Both of them had come to the same conclusion. They couldn’t wait any longer, no matter what Malfoy had told them.
Unfortunately, it didn’t take long for Draco to find out what Bellatrix wanted to do, and Draco looked away. He couldn’t help her, he couldn’t do anything. When the screams started, Draco turned away and left the room. Maybe his mother had told him to stay, maybe not, he was trying to tune out all sound, to be able to ignore the screams, and couldn’t properly hear her.
He ran over to Ron as fast as he could while not getting hit by any curses. Bellatrix had seen him by now but she hadn’t managed to hit him yet. He pulled one of the wands in his hand at random and shot an Expeliarmus her way.
“It’s not him.“, he said, voice as emotionless as ever. He stood up, not looking at him again, and went over to his mother. Draco watched while they led Harry and Weasley away, but Bellatrix kept Hermione upstairs. What was she planning to do?
Draco raised his eyebrow. “Why would you want to thank me?”
And that was when he understood. They wouldn’t call for the Dark Lord as long as they aren’t sure that it is really the boy who lived. And given that Draco had been going to school with him, he would be the best to identify him, right?
Someone stepped up next to him and he was momentarily distracted from the picture in front of him. He looked to the side and saw Luna standing there, giving him a small smile.
It was the sword of Gryffindor, lying on the ground near the door. Harry turned around to Ron after all and pointed at the sword near the door. His friend nodded, immediately understanding Harry plan.
Draco didn’t know what the future would bring, but he knew that this could be the opportunity he needed. So he took it. He nodded. “Let’s start again, then.”
A sheepish smile crept onto Harry’s face. “I’m sorry, okay. Maybe it was too much. It’s just...”, he trailed off but Draco had no inclination of saving him from that awkward moment. He had brought that upon himself.
The healer in front of him sighed. “I’m not going to hurt you. Dobby brought you here about an hour ago, but I had to tend to some others at the time and you were unconscious anyways.”, her voice was gentle and calm. Nothing like the storm of emotions that was raging inside Draco’s chest, constricting his breath. “I’m going to bandage your arm now, it stopped bleeding, but I still need to clean and bandage it to keep dirt from entering it. The cuts seem to be from a cursed blade so I won’t be able to heal it.”
They didn’t deserve this, no one did. Involuntarily, his thought supplied him with a different picture. Malfoy. What happened after they had left? Dobby said that it was Malfoy who threw the dagger off its course. Did they find out it was him? And what did they do to him? A wave of guilt washed over him and Harry felt like he should have insisted on taking him with them. He had refused, yes. And they had been enemies once, always at each others throats during their school days. But now?
It was uneven, some cuts deeper than others, and he was sure that it would scar. At least the Dark Mark would be partly obscured and hidden from sight by the scars on top of it. Not that it made a difference, no one would see it anyways. Maybe the unlucky person that found his dead body in a few weeks, when someone from the Ministry was send to check if anyone is still hiding in the Malfoy’s house. Not that he would be hiding at that point. Not anymore. What point would hiding have, it’s too late for him anyways.
A hand touched his shoulder, grounding him. He looked over and it was Blaise. He motioned for him to look forwards and reluctantly, he did.
A smile crept onto Harry’s face and he still didn’t let go of Draco’s arm, instead, he let his hand wander downwards until he grasped Draco’s hand in his.
The voices around him where still muffled, fading in and out and Draco just lacked the energy to listen to the conversations around him. He was just so tired. He stayed on the soft and scratchy thing underneath his back, staring up at the ceiling. It reminded him of Hogwarts, in a way. Hogwarts is full of high ceilings and floating candles. Floating candles?
A groan sounded from behind them and both of them turned around to see Wormtail slowly turning over on the floor. Harry and Ron both ran up the stairs without any hesitation, it would be too late to do anything as soon as the man really woke up and was able to warn the other Deatheaters.
Suddenly everything fell silent again and Draco looked back to where the Deatheaters were standing. He noticed that Hagrid was with them, holding a body in his arms and with shock he realised that it was Harry.
He was also acutely aware of his surroundings again. The hard floor he was lying on, the silence all around him, the rays of sun that seemed too bright and not bright enough at the same time. He could smell the blood. Its metallic stench.
Looking to the side, Draco could see people running around, some of them were limping and he started to register the muffled screams out of the mass of sounds around him. The stench of blood hit his nose and he closed his eyes, trying to block it out as best as he could.
Instead of trees, he looked at a familiar figure standing in front of him. Sirius. He looked to the side, just to see his mother and his father on his other side. He looked back to Sirius, his thoughts stuck somewhere between awe and shock.
Next update will (hopefully) be on sunday 07/02/21
“Harry Potter does not have to worry about Dobby. Mr. Malfoy stopped the dagger from reaching Dobby.“
Harry blinked at him owlishly, uncomprehending about what just happened.
Blaise seemed taken aback by the question, but Greg was the one who actually voiced it. “Where is your wand?”
When Draco opened his eyes, the bright rays of sunlight that got inside trough the dirty windows burned his eyes and that was all it took for him to get catapulted back into reality once again. He could feel every little ache in his body. His throbbing forearm, the cuts littered all over his arms and upper body, the tremors still cursing through his body from time to time.
“Luna?”, he asked in disbelieve.
Bellatrix’ wand flew through the air and Harry just so managed to catch it. At the same moment he arrived next to Ron and Harry noticed that Dobby was already there too. He hadn’t seen him before as Ron had shielded him too.
Well, that was actually the problem, he did not have a plan. Before he could think about an answer, another scream echoed through the room and Weasley ripped himself out of Harry’s grip. He grabbed Draco and slammed him up against the wall. “What are they doing to her?“
She paused for a moment, wand already in hand. She didn’t move. Draco realised that she was waiting for his permission, and he nodded. She smiled again and touched his left arm at the wrist. Then she pointed her wand at it and touched it briefly with the tip. He felt something soft wrapping around it and even though it didn’t stop hurting it felt better with the gauze around it, in a way.
warnings are at the end of the chapter!
He arrived at another door after taking multiple turns and again tapped at it with his wand. It opened to the outside and Draco stepped out into the cold and wet basement. Immediately he was crowded by Harry and Weasley, but upon nearer inspection, it was actually Weasley crowding him, with Harry trying to hold the redhead back. He huffed, trying to sound as bored as possible. “What’s your problem, Weasley?“
There were a lot of injured wizards and witches, young and old.
But he had chosen his side and he would fight with them. Because they had a chance again. A chance in the form of the boy he had inadvertently fallen in love with over two years ago.
Draco swallowed. He wasn’t inclined to tell them what happened at the moment. He just shook his head. “I’ll tell you but not right now.”, he paused for a moment, but then another thought came to him. “Do you have any idea where I can get a spare wand?”
“Because I will listen.” Draco was quiet for a moment before responding.
Ron left Harry sitting alone by the fire in the common room. Harry started to work on his Potions essay hoping that his friends didn’t decide that Harry was in fact just going insane. Suddenly, Harry saw red hair in an open doorway. Not clearly, but as though he were remembering it. He got a couple more flashes of a ginger while he kept working on his essay, not sure if this made him more or less sane.
By the time he arrived at Hogwarts, Harry was feeling better about the portrait, though he did get flashes of the inside of a broom cupboard for some reason. He sat down with his friends at their usual spot at the Gryffindor table, and suddenly Harry realized how surreal it was to be back at school starting a normal school year when just months ago he had been destroying horcruxes, flying a dragon, and defeating Lord Voldemort. He looked around the room and felt nauseous from how much it reminded him of how many people had died right where they were sitting. Harry forces himself to push those thoughts to the back of his mind. He had to eat here for the rest of the year and he couldn’t bear the guilt if he thought about it too much. After Flitwick had led the first years in the sorting and food had appeared on the plates, McGonnagal stood up to give her opening speech to the school.
They were sitting very close to each other. Harry felt like he was in a dream. He realized this was the first time he had ever talked to Draco without fighting. Suddenly, Harry felt even more brave than he had when he first came up the stairs. He turned to face Draco and put a hand on his chin, turning it towards him.
He pressed on, keeping a steady pace on his way to the dark forest that was stretching out before him, getting bigger and darker with every step. He still had doubts, but every time when the thought to just turn around entered his head again, he thought back to the people in the big hall. The injured, the dead, the people who had lost someone. He couldn’t let this continue, he had to stop it.
„What are you doing here?“, he whispered, not daring to raise his voice.
“Hey, Mr. Malfoy. It’s just me, Madam Pomfrey, okay? Please lie down again.”
This could all be a plot to reveal to the others that he is really Harry Potter and then they would somehow notify Voldemort to come and kill him. He couldn’t let that happen. But at the same time it didn’t really make sense for Malfoy to help them and then not let them escape. Maybe he only wanted Luna to escape and keep him and the others here. Harry’s thoughts kept going in circles, coming to the same conclusion every time. That Malfoy had betrayed them, that it had never been his intention to actually let them escape.
It took Draco a lot of strength and determination to open his eyes, and when he finally did, he found that he was staring at a ceiling. It was high above him and made of stone. It also seemed vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t place it. Where had he seen it before?
A few people turned their heads and stared at him with disdain written clearly on their face, but most didn’t even give him a glance. As if he were invisible and in a sense, he was. He didn’t belong here.
The next moment the fight broke out and everything around him descended into chaos.
Draco didn’t know how long he had been up in the tower when he heard footsteps coming up the stairs. He waited until they stopped, before he turned his head to look at them. It was Harry.
He thought back to when he was lying on the bathroom floor in Hogwarts, blood flowing out of his body and onto the ground. It was Harry who had used that curse he had never heard before on him, and for a moment, Draco had actually thought that it would end there for him. And for a short moment, he had wished for it to end. He wished for it because then he wouldn’t have to deal with being a Deatheater, with Voldemort and his mission, with nothing. Later on, he had questioned himself for thinking like that, but it still was there, locked away in the far back of his consciousness.
They crept down the hallway, anxiously looking around the whole time and Harry almost expected to run into someone on the way. Where did everyone go? Hopefully not into the room where they kept Hermione, they wouldn’t have a chance without their wands.
After a while, he didn’t know how long, Draco opened his eyes again and looked down at his left arm. The sleeve was torn open up to the elbow and the bloody remnants of skin seemed to glare back at him. The whole arm was covered in blood at this point and Draco wished that she had cut a bit deeper. Deep enough for it to just bleed out and leave him in peace. But she didn’t.
„Are you serious, Harry?“ He ripped his arm out of Harry’s grip and they continued to glare at each other.
Draco couldn’t see who the voice belonged to, but Weasley let him go and Harry walked over to the source of the voice. Draco still couldn’t see them, but when they continued to speak, he recognised the voice. “Dobby?“ The house-elf stopped talking as soon as he heard his voice and looked over to him. He had expected to see fear in these eyes, but instead all he found was sadness. “Mr. Malfoy, Dobby thought you would be at Hogwarts. Dobby is here to help Harry Potter and his friends.“ The way he said it, it sounded like he expected Draco to try and stop him. He shook his head. “Go ahead.“
He turned so he could see better and looked at the chaos in front of him. There were even more injured people as before and the Weasley’s were still huddled around one of the cots.
He felt out of place again, even more so without his wand. The Deatheaters had positioned themselves opposite them, with the dark lord at the front, leading them on. If they attacked now, Draco would be dead for sure.
With that she got up and moved on to the next person in need of medical attention. Draco was left there, staring at the ceiling of the Great Hall. He wondered why exactly Dobby had brought him here. He had never been particularly kind to the elf. He hadn’t hurt him like his father had done, but he had been a spoiled brat and he had acted accordingly. Especially towards creatures he was taught were beneath him. He sighed and sat up, taking a proper look around.
The narrow stairs weren’t long and the hallway it led them into was empty. The guys that had picked them up in the forest weren’t there anymore and it had been a few minutes since they had last heard Hermione’s screams.
He couldn’t come up with one plausible reason, so he went to go, but before he could pass Harry at the top of the stairs, he grabbed his arm and Draco stopped in his steps. He turned back to Harry and looked at him questioningly.
He ripped his gaze off the wand and looked around. They had landed on the wet sand near a beach, a house in the distance. Harry could see Ron and Hermione to his left, also sitting on the ground. Hermione was gripping onto Ron, her head buried in his shoulder. When Harry looked to the right, he could see Dobby. The house elf was standing in the sand and looked into the distance, a melancholy look on his face. But he seemed alright, at least as far as Harry could tell without his glasses.
Quiet steps were echoing through the otherwise silent manor. There were voices, silent and fleeting. Barely there and gone again.  Like echoes in the wind. There was the hiss of a snake, near to his ear, but even that faded into nothing only a moment later. The voices subsided and the footsteps he had heard where fading as well. Slowly, he became aware of the cold stone floor pressing into his side and a shiver ran down his spine, chilling him to the bones. There were no footsteps anymore. No voices. Everything was eerily silent.
The house-elf actually smiled at that.“Dobby thanks Mr. Malfoy for helping Dobby and his friends.“ He saw out of the corner of his eye how Ron snickered at that, but he chose not to react to it.
Draco shrugged. “Potter took it.”
A new voice spoke up before Weasley could punsh him in the face. “Harry Potter?“
Before he could continue and embarrass himself even further, Draco stepped forward and took Harry’s hand in his again. Their eyes met and Draco gave him a small but genuine smile.
this chapter is from Draco's perspective again. there's not much happening plot-wise but I still felt like it needed to be done.
When Bellatrix came back from the gate, she brought three people with her. She claimed that they had been caught I the woods, putting up a fight to get away. She also claimed that one of them is Harry Potter.
Harry extracted himself from Mrs. Weasley’s hug and looked at her, trying to convey how truly sorry he was for all that had happened. “I’m sorry. I won’t let anyone else get hurt.”
Before Draco could make up his mind and tell the elf that he should leave him here, he felt a small hand touching his shoulder again.
He turned away from them, this wasn’t his place. He didn’t get to apologise to them or to offer his condolences. It wasn’t his place to do that.
As soon as he remembered it, Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted over to Dobby, grabbing the elf by his small shoulders. He turned him around, looking for injuries, for blood, anything to indicate that the dagger had hit him. He found nothing. When he was sure that he hadn’t missed anything, he looked up and into Dobby’s big eyes. Dobby gave him a small smile.
A hand touched his shoulder then and he jumped, ripping his eyes open and suddenly possessing the strength to lift his upper body from the ground. He couldn’t see his attacker clearly and nearly collided with them on his way up.
He squinted up at it and was greeted by big green eyes and pointy ears that were hanging down at the tips. He immediately recognised the being in front of him. “Dobby?“, he whispered, his voice hoarse from screaming. Draco couldn’t believe that this was really happening. Maybe it was just a dream after all. A very vivid dream.
At the thought of them he dropped the wands onto the ground and fished for his glasses, still somewhere in the pockets of his jacket. He put them back on as soon as he managed to find them.
He let his gaze wander over it and tried not to think about the future for a moment. He had no idea what he would do, now that everything was over.
Looking back at the redhead, who was still waiting for an answer, seeing the desperation on his face, he made himself answer. “What do you think?“ It wasn’t what he had actually wanted to say, but he was sure that it was the answer they had expected.
(See the end of the chapter for
He closed his eyes again, still blinded by the sun, and tried to block it all out. To escape from this place, or maybe to just disappear completely. He couldn’t believe that they had let him live. They had no reason to. Maybe his parents had something to do with it. Or they were just waiting for him to die of thirst.
He stayed there for a moment, keeping a tight grip on the wands in his hands. He looked down at the one he had used to disarm Bellatrix. It had listened to him perfectly as if it was his, but that wasn’t possible because his got destroyed. Looking at the wand didn’t help him though, because he wasn’t able to recognise it. It seemed slightly familiar though.
Everyone nodded and Dobby disapparated with the others.
Then she moved on to his ribs and they stopped screaming in pain as well, only leaving a dull ache behind. She went over his body, looking for injuries and healing them. Draco’s eyes never left her hands while she worked. When she was finished, she started speaking in a low tone again. “You’re free to go, but I wouldn’t advise you taking part in the fight.”, she paused for a moment and shrugged. “But if you decide to fight, I won’t be the one to stop you.”
Draco lowered his eyes again, staring at his bloody arm again. He couldn’t go to Hogwarts, the Deatheaters would surely attack soon. And he wouldn’t be of any help, he could barely move. He was better off dead anyways so Dobby could just leave him here, lying on the floor, and pretend he never found him in the first place.
The chapter is from Harry's perspective again.
Everything came to a stop. He couldn’t really hear what He was saying, not that it mattered because they were all dead anyways. The dark lord had won. And that meant that Draco could just start to dig his own grave by now. There was no hope left.
He let it fall into his hand and looked at it, thinking back to what Luna’s father had told them about the Deathly Hallows. He had no idea how Dumbledore could have gotten his hands on the stone of resurrection but it was undeniably lying in his palm. He turned the stone in his hand absentmindedly and looked up again, in the direction he heard the voices of the Deatheaters come from.
“Lets start over then.”, he whispered and Harry nodded.
Feel free to leave a comment or drop by on my tumblr @silversfiction!
“Okay. Lets start over.”
Draco sat down and leaned his back on the wall. He looked down and watched as the sun went down, but he didn’t feel like moving, not yet. This was his opportunity to run away from reality for a moment longer. The opportunity to forget and not think about what could come next.
Draco is having some depressive thoughts again, there are some slightly graphic descriptions of injuries and implied torture (not described in any way)
His steps led him into the Great Hall, where witches and wizards of all ages where resting, tending to the wounded, crying over loved ones. His stomach dropped when he saw a group of red heads huddles together around a cot. The Weasleys were holding on to each other and all of them were crying. He saw Ron kneeling on the ground, draped over a still body.
Before he could think further about that, he heard someone call his name. He turned to the door and saw Blaise and Greg standing in the doorway. Both looked at him in disbelieve before they made their way over simultaneously.
After the fight, the first thing that Draco did was getting rid of the wand. Bellatrix had died during the fight and he didn’t want any reminder of her. His parents had fled when it became apparent that the dark lord would loose and he wasn’t inclined to look for them, not yet. Maybe he would, later on, but not right now.
(See the end of the chapter for
As he walked through he castle, he saw more and more of his friends, all of them battered and bruised, skin covered in blood.
No one would die anymore, not because of him. Too many people had already lost their life for him. To protect him. He couldn’t bear that thought any longer and it was the only thing that kept him marching on without faltering in his sure and steady steps towards the wall of dark trees.
They arrived at the doorway, the heavy wood doors only slightly opened. Their were voices drifting over to them from inside, but they were to quiet to fully reach the doors. Harry couldn’t understand them. And if Malfoy had told them about the escape plan they wouldn’t have a chance.
All the students he could see seemed to be from any house except Slytherin and for some reason he couldn’t quite grasp, that fact pained him. They had always been on the wrong side of the war, by default. But he felt like he could change that. A new sort of determination rose up inside him and he looked around, trying to find someone who could get him a spare wand from somewhere. He would need a wand if he wanted to fight.
Draco really wanted to answer with sarcasm, rile the other up even more, but another scream echoed all around them and he decided against it. If it was one of his friends up there, he would probably react the same way, looking to blame someone else. But even with that in mind, he couldn’t bring himself to actually say it. That Bellatrix was using the cruciatus curse to get answers out of her. He didn’t want to think about the pain that the curse could inflict.
Bellatrix had been very precise in her work with the dagger. The dagger that was meant for Harry, or for Dobby perhaps. Not for him, but that was his punishment.
Suddenly he was acutely aware of his injuries again and of the warm hand that still rested on his shoulder. He swallowed the bile that was rising up in his throat and tried to control his breathing.
Then it finally sunk in. They had won the war, the dark lord was gone. And he was still alive. And that may be the biggest surprise of all.
He wasn’t sure why he had started doing it, but he had noticed that the food that Wormtail was bringing down there couldn’t possibly be enough for one person, least of all for nearly three. He didn’t have food with him this time, but Harry and his friends arriving changed a few things. Harry’s face had possibly been hit by a spell that would wear off soon and even if not, they would find out about the identity of their guest soon enough, judging by the muffled screams he could still hear from within the walls of the old house.
He shuddered at the thought and he felt slightly nauseous, but he realised that there was no other choice to be made. He is one of the horcruxes, which means that he has to die so the others can win. He wouldn’t let anyone else die. But even though he had made his decision, he was trembling all over.
After getting rid of the elder wand, Harry stayed on the bridge even after Ron and Hermione had left. He looked back to Hogwarts, the place he had thought to be indestructible, ruined.
He must have fallen asleep at some point, because when he became aware of his surroundings again, there were a lot more people in the Great Hall than before.
—————
Draco crossed his arms in front of his chest defensively. “What do you think you’re doing?”
The elf gripped his shoulder a bit tighter and answered with a strong determination in his voice. “Dobby will bring you back to Hogwarts.”
“What are you doing?”, he asked in a small whisper.
Without really thinking about it, Draco began to move to the doors as well, dragging both Blaise and Greg with him. They both protested at first and asked what he was doing but in the end they came with him willingly.
There was a pounding in his head and muffled voices floated around him, but he couldn’t grasp the meaning of the words. He struggled to regain his memories and orientate himself. How did he get here? He didn’t even know where he was for Merlin’s sake!
Harry sighed and something in his gaze changed when he looked at him. “I wanted to thank you.”
He was going to die. Tonight.
In that moment shouting could be heard from outside, and everyone who wasn't occupied with tending to the wounded got up and began to move outside to see what was happening.
Even after everything that happened, even after becoming a Deatheater, Draco still had that bit of hope. Hope that the Dark Lord would loose. And if that happened, he wanted to be able to actually have a life after the war. Should Voldemort win, he would be as good as dead anyways.
A touch to his shoulder made him jump and he immediately regretted it, when all the different injuries all over his body send out flares of pain again. But he didn’t turn around, he couldn’t muster the energy to even turn his head and look at the person that came to end him. He closed his eyes and expected to hear an Avada Kedavra but instead there where light footsteps on the floor.
His determination became even stronger and he knew, he had to end this before anyone else died, even if he died in the process. He left the castle and made his way to the Forbidden Forest. Halfway there, regret gripped him tight and he nearly turned around again. He hadn’t told Ron and Hermione what he was doing. Where he was going. But he didn’t stop, he didn’t turn around. Hermione would figure it out with Snape’s memory. They would know why he had to do it. They probably wouldn’t forgive him for not giving them the chance to say good-bye, but if he turned around now, he was sure that he couldn’t make himself go into the forest again. Not soon enough to stop anyone else from dying.
“Did you bring food again?“, asked Luna. He couldn’t tell if she was asking because of the food or because she wanted to ease the tension in the room. He shook his head. “Sorry, I’m here to get you out.“
When Ron and Harry went to the locker room to change after the match, Ron cornered Malfoy and asked him tons of questions about his true feelings for his best friend. Harry tried to calm him down but he knew better that it wasn't by mean but to protect his mate.
"Well, you're here. He is here. Maybe things will change?"
"I know.."
"Like it makes a difference.."
"Wow Malfoy, I didn't think you could do that!" Exclaim Dean in a sassy voice.
Tears rolled down his cheek and it was quieter each time he spoke but everyone on the locker qtay silent and listened to him. It was his moment of redemption.
"No he's not !" Shout the red-haired girl. "She's mine!"
"Draco." He could feel his breath on his chin when Draco looked up to lock his eyes on him.
"And we mean to go on and on and on and on!"
"What do you mean?"
"Or maybe you should thank us because we're exactly what you needed. And we're as strong as you at Quidditch so we will end this year with five wins because of us." Outbid Goyle in anger.
Everyone looked at Neville who was starting to eat when the food suddenly appeared. The group stayed silent until the blond-haired boy looked up to his friends.
"So you're implying you would like to date him?" Gabe smiled teasingly.
"Does it really matter?"
"Can you.. explain?" Said Hermione uneasy.
After a while Harry stopped to talk with some people, getting to know them, until his eyes focused on a particular blonde head.
The silence that followed could make them uncomfortable but Harry didn't bother to even acknowledge what reaction they could have because he kissed back. His free hand grabbed the blonde hairs behind Draco's neck and pushed the Chaser toward him, closing the gap between them. He wanted to feel the blonde on him. Felt this was real. Malfoy sat on Harry's lap to adjust his position, crossing his legs behind Harry's back without breaking the kiss.
"Five minutes then. I suggest you get your brooms Potter."
"Er.. taking pictures?" Harry didn't know what to say. He should have known Malfoy would be pissed if he saw him.
"I love you Draco, you're my champion and we won thanks to you. Not only the match but also the war. You were always here for me. And I want you in my life forever."
"Yeah, you told us about your
"You should have told me that the git was your ex! I could have prevented that fight tonight!" Gabe sighed as they stopped to a log not far from the parking lot. Harry sat down and looked at the campfire, watching people enjoying the evening.
Harry had put his wand in his coat's pocket after that. He didn’t really need it at school and the past summer he had trained to do wandless magic, since the last time he had broken his wand he’d had to borrow Hermione's. Plus, how could he explain to his new friends that he always had a weird stick in his pocket?
The Golden Trio walked toward the Room of the Requirement in silence. To be honest they weren't really up to returning to the place they almost died months ago but they were war heroes so people expected them to act like nothing reached them. And tonight they went there to celebrate the victory of their first match and it was Draco's wish to celebrate it together so Harry couldn't say no to that.
"Because I know you, Harry. It's been a month."
The Gryffindor and Slytherins scream in joy on the bleachers. Harry was happy to hear both houses chanting their names. It was odd at first but he felt like it was always meant to be like this.
"Well you're wrong. I'm going to bed. Night."
"Everyone could see the sexual tension between you two!"
"Is it really that obvious that I love you ?" He smirked between kisses.
Harry's eyes widened in surprise. He never imagined going to a party with the Slytherins and so, never thought about where to do it.
"If you want to keep your secret undercover then I'll keep saying that."
"Maybe because you’ve been looking for him ever since we’ve arrived here
Malfoy. The Slytherin git, a bully and a rather handsome man from Harry’s past, was standing on the other side of the fire. Harry had never seen Malfoy wear muggle clothes. The sight tickled his curiosity.
"Are you kidding me? You're the one who-"
"What are you talking about?" Asked Ron while playing chess with Harry.
"Right. So, how is the Ferret?"
But Harry didn't care what they said, he just wanted a truce and peace in this school. He save that damn school for fuck sake. He could feel Draco tensed up behind him but at least he had the decency to shut his mouth. Harry wanted to take his hand and comfort him but right now all he could do was clench his fists in anger and defiance.
"If I were you, I would keep my distance from Darcy. She could trap you in her claws!" the blonde man said.
After three weeks, Harry already felt at home in the muggle world. Everyone was really nice and fun to be with. Sometimes people would look at him weird because of something he had said or because he forgot it wasn't a world with magic and he would talk about his teenage life.
Malfoy tried hard to not snort at that but Harry wasn't finished yet.
"Mate, as much as I loved seeing you with my sister, seeing you last year made me think that you need someone by your side. Someone who can love you but also stand up to you."
"Watch out Potter!" He heard but didn't care at the moment.
"I know you don't like me Ronald, you have all the right but I love Harry. I have loved him since even before we were dating. He saved my life more than once, he saved my family. But I saved his life too, or at least I tried. I can't see my future without him, I can't imagine my life without him."
"That's why you never tried to find me after that moment? I thought I embarrassed you or.. or scared you.. "
"But.. Harry isn't gay, he dated Ginny!" Said Ron indignantly.
No recognition. No gasps or giggles when he walked in the hallway for his first class. No whispering from the other students. And that was exactly what he was looking for.
"Like here on Gryffindor. Seamus and me aren't good enough, Neville couldn't even stand being on a broom, no offense mate, and-"
"You'll only win because you're just you three and we needed only three players. So maybe you just need to thank us first." Said Cormac McLaggen harshly.
"Hum.. What about the girl?"
The Slytherin had changed the lyrics of their old year mocking song. Ron must have heard it too because he was smiling at the Seeker and was ready to play more.
"What?"
Harry tensed. Did he really want to take the chance of running into Malfoy? If it even really was Draco Darcy was talking about. Even if he believed in second chances, Harry didn’t know how he would react after everything that had happened in the past.
"Don't compare me to that ferret please. Plus, who says that both of them are gay? Don't you see you could make your best friend uncomfortable?" Responds Ginny, nodding to Harry with a wink.
"Come on dude! Can't you see Harry is panicking?"
Harry's hand gripped something at the same time to keep balance but all three fell down on the sand miserably. His head hurts a lot and he couldn't really feel his body either.
"Oh please, Neville was right about one thing. Harry was obsessed with Malfoy and we know that hate is really close to love."
Dean exclaimed and that was the moment Harry realised no one was singing anymore. He thought he could have done this without making a scene, thanks to George's products.
"I know, I'm sick of this too. They had to realise that they've been in love for years. And they need our help."
?" Malfoy moved closer so he was only an inch away from Harry, a confident smirk on his lips.
