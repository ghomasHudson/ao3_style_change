Draco couldn’t repress a shudder at the Dark Lord’s name. “I won’t take much of your time.”
Once there was a king who had a very picky, prickly son. The king had long given up hope that his only heir would marry a girl and settle down to have an heir of his own. He was simply too interested in men, so his father had promised to make whoever married his son heir to his kingdom, be they king or peasant.
Draco snuck out in the wee hours of the morning and returned to his room for a long bath, quite relaxed.
He blinked at the spot where the boy had been standing for a moment, glancing worriedly at the smaller boy, who was staring at him, round-eyed. "What… what did you
Unable to find the words for his relief that he wasn’t being asked to stop, Draco nodded, a spike of happiness filling him. He leaned in to kiss Harry again, his fingers once more moving down his body, stopping to undo Harry’s jeans. He fumbled with the buttons for a moment before managing to work them free then slid his hand inside and curling it around Harry.
That confused Draco, and then he was shaking his head, negating Harry’s statement for a moment. “But what about the fact that we were on opposite sides? And what about Weasley’s sister?”
Draco grabbed one of the potions, and threw it at Fenrir, which made the man howl and fall back. Draco tucked his knees up around Harry, shuddering, even as Harry pulled the broom up higher into the trees. "God…"
Harry followed, settling next to him before allowing himself to ask. “Is this something you’d like to talk about, Draco?” Out here, he seemed to feel more ease at talking to Draco as an equal, even though they both knew he was not. Draco was grateful for that, at least.
"This one's more of an actual story," Draco told him. "It starts after the war…"
Instead of answering, Harry pulled him close and kissed him again, and Draco could taste the hunger building between them. “Tonight,” Harry said when he pulled away. “I’ll see you then.” And then he was gone.
"Of course we do," the woman said angrily, looking up at him, her porcelain-pale face streaked with tears. "You are our first-born. We love you."
Nodding, Draco moved to straddle the handle, then put his arms tight around Harry’s waist. "Like this?" he asked.
Draco did consider enlisting his father’s help in ridding himself of Potter, but there was part of him that fought that. He convinced himself that it was because he was worried his father would do something unwise, and end up back in Azkaban.
He was woken at dawn by the sound of a rooster. Not that he knew it was a rooster. Just that it was the rudest bird he’d ever had his misfortune to meet.
Potter shook his head. “Of course not. Someone has to do it, after all, and I’m going to be busy selling all those pretty things your father gave us.”
Unfortunately, this does not go over well, and we can see the temper rising in Draco. “No? You don’t want me here? Perhaps you feel a touch uncomfortable having me here?”
will notice, I am no longer a dragon. Doesn’t that make any difference? Harry kissed me, and I changed back.”
Draco shook his head.
“G-good to meet you,” he managed.
“I don’t think—” Weasley started, but Potter waved him off.
"Then do you know… is mother still here?"
“Brilliant observation. It took you this long to get to that point, Potter?” Draco asked him with a scowl.
Harry looked at him sadly. "I can’t take you with me. She’s obviously enchanted the room to keep you here. Which means we’ll need to make our own door. And for that, I’ll need something else. I promise to be back before nightfall, okay?"
“Good. I’m glad. It hid those gorgeous eyes of yours.”
"Why should I believe a word you say, Malfoy?"
Let me introduce them to you:
But I was also certain by then we would never win. I don't mean I thought the Dark Lord would never win, but that the Malfoy family would never survive, regardless. At least under the old Ministry, we might have had a chance, but under Voldemort's regime? We would never survive. Not for long, anyway.
"What? What did he do?" If Lucius had hurt Harry in any way…
Draco’s heart sank for a moment. It was as though his father had slapped him in the face. But then he remembered that his father didn’t know the full truth. “Come inside. Let me explain, at least?”
Potter smiled. “As many as it takes until you learn your lessons.”
Draco was growing very bored.
Draco placed it on the table rather than putting it back in his pocket. He didn’t want Potter thinking that he was here to attack him, after all. He moved away from it, crossing to the window, glancing out at the street before looking back at his one-time nemesis. “Did you curse me, Potter?” he finally asked.
Looking up, Harry smiled. And Draco couldn’t help but think that while Harry might not have parents, he definitely had family. He hurried to the other two men, greeting them with open arms and a wide smile. “You made it!”
But Potter was after him in a flash, grabbing his arm. “No…I don’t think so, Draco…”
“Don’t tell them. If they ask for a decision tonight, say you might have a possibility, but that you need to think about it, and that you need that extra ball tomorrow to be certain. Okay?”
Potter seemed sad, and sighed. “Look…” He shook his head. “I really do need a shower. Let me do that, then I’ll meet you in the sitting room across the hall from our rooms?”
“And what will you be doing, hm?”
“And you are his advisor?” Lucius asked, narrowing his eyes.
“Yeah,” Harry said with a smile. “She’s pretty cool, actually. She’s actually able to look like whoever she wants.”
Draco sagged back onto the bed, defeated. That damned cart. His fingers had yet to really heal, and now the blisters that remained would probably break open. He rolled onto his side, away from Potter, and though he thought he’d be up all night, upset, somehow he managed to fall fast asleep almost immediately.
Draco took off again, following the road out of town, then into the fields around the castle. There were plenty of people along the road, but Draco was scared to approach most, as they were in large groups that he was pretty sure included fighters to protect them on the road.
"I know you don't—" Harry started, over Draco's, "Did you want—?"
Returning to his rooms, he took a long bath, then dressed in the second set of robes his mother had prepared for him, and managed to be finished just in time to go down to the ball. If he hadn’t had a chance of seeing Harry there, he’d likely have run for the stables and out into the fields around the town, and away from all the leering looks and simpering maidens. He wasn’t sure if he’d be able to stand it a third time.
Snape’s eyes narrowed. “Indeed. At least your great aunt didn’t wish to marry a woman…”
She sighed. “Fine. I’ll see if there are any possible candidates left. But…I don’t know what we will do if this doesn’t work…” She turned and made her way back into the castle, and Draco turned back to his new friends who were talking softly. He saw Remus put his hand on Sirius’s shoulder and whisper something that seemed to calm the other man. And at the sight, something flared inside him. Yes, that was what he wanted. That kind of love.
Finally, nearly a month after Blaise had left on his quest, he returned late one morning after a particularly stormy night, a bedraggled and wet girl in tow.
He really wasn’t a pet. He was a man. A very creepy man. She called him "Fenny." They both seemed to find that funny. Draco wasn’t sure what the joke was. To be honest, the man scared him. All the more because when Draco didn’t do as the witch asked, she threatened to let Fenny play with him. Whatever else, Draco knew he didn’t want that to happen.
“Maybe…” Harry mused. “But then why me?”
“King Abraxas was the one who freed the Muggles, Highness,” she simpered at him.
“I do not see it that way, Majesty. I see it as a chance to reconcile our families. After all, they were once quite friendly, were they not?”
Draco blinked at him, not having expected the question. He slowly shook his head no.
“Gryffindor, sire.”
“What is that supposed to mean, Malfoy?” Potter sounded annoyed now.
The days before the ball were filled with fittings and lectures and plans, but somehow, Draco found the time to bribe Hannah, who was the Royal family’s personal seamstress, to adjust one of his own robes to fit Harry. Not that he told her it
"Don't. I mean, I know you can't. Don't make yourself feel guilty about it. It isn't your fault I'm here," Draco told him, voice soft.
“What? But…those are
“Yeah?” Draco asked, more confident now as they moved together.
Then, too, Harry wants his friends to visit, but their attitude towards Draco shows just what they think of him, and Draco’s attitude towards them is little better. So Harry eventually asks them to stay away. Too bad Draco doesn’t seem at all grateful for his sacrifice.
“Never mind. Just remember to have something waiting for me when I get home tonight. You did such a great job with our clothes that I offered your services to the King for his wedding banquet. So you’ll need to go to the servants’ entrance of the palace and retrieve the tablecloths and napkins, wash them, then return them before nightfall. And don’t forget to make something for us to eat for supper!” And then Potter was gone before Draco could protest.
"Right…" Draco said again. He searched his brain for something, anything to tell Potter. Then the perfect idea came to mind.
“So?”
Draco blinked. Shacklebolt couldn't really mean that, could he? Five years community service seemed like nothing. "S-sir?"
It took a good deal to convince his feet to move, but finally, he stepped forward and made his way up the stairs. As soon as he was close enough, the woman threw her arms around him and sobbed. Draco met his father’s eyes, not sure what to say.
"I have to take your tray after anyway. This way I have an excuse to linger," Potter said
He didn’t notice the lights of the town as they approached, his eyes screwed shut as they were. He barely even noticed as they alit in the courtyard of the palace.
“I wish you could tell us. Maybe one of your parents could help?”
“How bad can it get? Do we…” Potter paled, unable to even say what he wanted.
“Just…give me time, mother?”
So I did what I was told, and Hogwarts fell. And Dumbledore died, though not at my hand.
Sitting down, Draco folded his hands in his lap, looking down at them. “Because…it left me shaken.” He looked up at Harry, who settled next to him, his arm pulling Draco close.
Narcissa cleared her throat, and the two looked back at her once more, both chastised. “So…a…joint interest, Draco?”
Draco watched after him, confused and upset. All he could do was hope that Potter meant what he’d said, and that he wouldn’t have to deal with this any more after tonight. He sighed, paid for his drinks, then apparated home.
There seemed to be a bit of electricity between them at the words. Even Harry seemed excited. “You mean…he’s…human?”
"Yes."
Draco wished that remembering alone didn't hurt so much.
“I don’t think so. The girls rarely stayed more than a day. So hopefully by tomorrow…” He’d be tasting those lips. They were certainly quite full. “You…do like other men, right?”
What might surprise some is that for once, he has no fear of this place, though he should. But then, he is a Gryffindor, and Gryffindors laugh at danger, do they not? Particularly when they are coming to beard a dragon in its den, as it were.
“You’ll come with me?” Harry asked.
“Harry.”
Draco shifted, curling deeper into his pillow. Except that it didn’t give like a pillow. And it grunted. “Ow. Draco, please…”
Draco moved back away from the wall before he took flight. He was really getting the hang of this, but he wanted to be well away so that the arrows wouldn’t be able to reach when they came into view. He swooped high above the walls, then relaxed when he didn’t see the archers. But he did notice something further inside the walls. Near the tower that housed his room. There was a small crowd there. He flew toward it, almost forgetting about Harry.
Panicking, he stepped back against Snape, purposefully planting his own foot hard on Snape's, in hopes of giving others a chance to escape. The other boy looked at him for a moment. It was a moment before he nodded, then turned and ran as fast as he could from the room. As he ran, he grabbed others, and tugging them along in his wake. Within moments, the room was nearly empty. A few other students were caught, though. Filch had two girls by the arm, ranting at them as they struggled against his hold, and two other students stood by the door, bound.
Draco didn’t care who "he" was, or what he’d done. He just jumped to his feet from the bed he’d sunk to in his despair. He hurried to the window. "I don’t care! We have to get out! Now! He’ll be here any moment! If he sees you…"
Now, as long as no professors found a mask on a student, and as long as none of them caught on to the fact that none of the upper years came to lunch, Draco might actually get to talk to his mystery guy. All he could do was hope he didn't react badly to his revelation. And he actually got a chance to tell him.
Draco was floored at this. Sirius was…a pouf? He’d never really considered the idea at all before now, really. Poufs were just people to stay away from, and deal with as little as possible. But while Sirius was a bit obnoxious, he’d in no way struck Draco as any different than he was. So…what did that mean, then?
The woman took a step forward, but the man—Draco knew he must be her husband—held her arm. "Draco?" she asked. Her voice was wavering, and he could hear the tears in her voice. He knew they had to be his parents, but he was scared to step away from Harry, so he nodded instead.
Glancing up at Potter, Draco sighed. “I had hoped…maybe it was just a spell.”
“What?” His defenses were high, now, and quite certain he wasn’t going to like Potter’s next question.
Unfortunately, that was the moment when Narcissa called Draco back to meet with the latest batch of girls. It took all his energy not to snarl at them, but he managed, sneaking a glance over at Harry between the girls’ kisses.
Harry gave Draco a regretful look, and a last scratch, then moved away to follow Padfoot once more, and Draco’s heart sank. He couldn’t let them leave him here! They were his last chance! He took off into the sky, then landed in front of Padfoot, blocking their way.
So Draco watched him walk away and waited. Again.
other ways to live. Sure, he knew people did, but as it hadn’t concerned him before, he hadn’t given it any thought at all.
King Lucius spoke warningly behind him. “Draco…”
What did reality have compared to that?
"I can. And I will, Mister Malfoy. Do not push me."
“You wouldn’t!” Draco tried to tug away from his father’s grip. “I am your heir!”
Queen Narcissa glanced from Blaise to Harriet, then nodded. “Very well. Let her get cleaned up, then Draco and I will meet her in the audience hall.”
It was nothing to what Padfoot did, though. “Look! What did I say? Get back, Harry.”
“He’s…father made him my personal guard when I was born, and he seems to have decided that since he failed me before, now he’s got to be extra vigilant. I don’t think it would have mattered who you were.” He smiled at Draco. “He’ll get over it.”
“They haven’t been that bad…”
Draco blinked. "Well…I just…assumed we would offer him a place to sleep for the night?"
Draco waited until he heard the shower in Potter’s room turn on, then pulled the door closed. He had preparations to make…
As for Draco, the glares bounced off his happy bubble. He had everything he needed, and come the summer, he and Harry would become the new kings of Slytherin, and ring in a new golden age for their kingdom. Everything was perfect.
He didn’t have to hold it long. “I like.” He kissed Draco again, and Draco happily responded, feeling his heart lighten just a bit. But then Harry pulled back. “But…I…can we really do this? I mean…your parents…”
Draco scowled. It wasn’t his fault Potter had refused to use some of the food the kitchens had packed, but he’d insisted that they keep the food for their first night in Draco’s new home. Instead, Draco had only had a scrap of bread and some water for his supper the night before, glowering at Potter the entire time.
I am wishing you all a very very merry xmas and hoppy holidays!XD
He swallowed as he remembered how the Dark Mark felt when he casted a spell on it. That was something inhumane. The feel of the magic was repulsive,
“We are going to brew a potion inside a girl’s lavatory?” Marius raised his eyebrows when they stopped walking.
In that moment, they all swore to become stronger than they were before, to never ever lose someone they love ever again and the promise to take back what was lost to them made them strong.
“He had no choice in the matter knowing who his father is. His mission is to kill the Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore.”
Cho Chang’s eyes widened at this. She was confused. It was as if the High Witch blamed the Dark Witches about what she had done when she knew it was her own self that made her do the deed.
“Nymphadora”, the witch before her then smirked an amused glint shining through her eyes.
Marius' eyes turned cold at the redhead's outburst and he replied coldly, "Not all werewolves belong to the light. Not every vampire is in the dark. Witches never remained neutral and chose sides and us humans will not remain weak. Just because some bloody dumb-head decided that he wanted your whole race dead does not mean that you should believe the same." His glare was piercing and this caused Ron to flinch, Harry's eyes to widen, and Hermione merely watched the scene with her mouth gaping.
Harry looked about to protest, but a small smile from Marius was all that made him nod. His mind was still whirring from his conversation with Lestrange.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Come on Harry, everyone’s already assembled", he let Hermione tug on his arm but his mind still travelled back to the strange human named Clarke. As soon as they entered the Room of Requirement, almost all of Gryffindor was present along with some Ravenclaws and no Slytherins, they all snapped their head at his and Hermione's arrival. Being the Alpha's son he has gained every single one of their trust and has proven himself worthy of becoming their next Alpha. He walked to ward the podium and glanced at all of them.
Orion remained calm and collected, though. He might have been called the Prince of Slytherin but when dealing with the Seventh Years who were marked before him, he could not disobey them. Even so, being Bellatrix’s son could be something to be grateful for because that gave him an edge to be able to reign the seventh years a bit.
“With me being here, the ward will hold, but only for a while”, Remus came rushing in and he stopped when he all saw them at the balcony and he approached them.
“Sorry, Marius,” said Harry, his eyes not completely meeting Marius’s grey ones. “I just came with Hermione to deliver them.”
Theo looked at the witch who finally opened her eyes to the hidden darkness of Chang. “I have eyes everywhere, Granger. We have always been watching what happens inside of this castle, but it has never been in our place to interfere.”
That was the only thing that popped within her mind as she waved her wand to re-new her barrier. There were only a handful of wolves who could inflict damages to her barrier and this wolf by far was the closest to breaking hers. Her sweat trickled down the side of her face as she calculated her next move to defeat the wolf.
The werewolf was only a step away from truly growling this time, but it was great he reacted fast enough. Before he was seen by Nott when his eyes suddenly gazed over his direction, Harry hid behind a column. He made his presence as undetectable as possible as he calmed his breathing and heart rate. Though, he still could not shake off the sinking feeling from his system. His heart constricted in a way he could not comprehend. His stomach in knots once again and he did not know what to do.
“Oh, don’t worry, dear. Everything is swimming well, all according to our Lord’s and my plans.”
"I think you should call me Draco."
At first, he felt something warm touched his shoulder, causing his tears to slow down and his thoughts to pause. He recognized it as a hand, comforting and so familiar.
It wasn’t long until he was surrounded by the vampires that seemed to have smelt the blood of Lovegood from her injuries. “I don’t think I want to let you pass, especially since you are carrying a very enticing meal in your arms.”
“Thank you”, Draco said once more and Griphook nodded Apparating then his gaze fell to Ragnok who already took the necklace and began casting spells upon spells upon it.
“I killed people, Harry. Innocent ones. I could not stop myself.” He pushed Harry away slightly as he sat up, not daring to look up to those green eyes that would be surely full of hate and fear and disgust at him. He looked at his hands and he could still remember them drenched in blood as his laughter rang in the midst of the village.
Harry closed his eyes, asking himself whether he could trust Marius. He did not know but this is the closest clue to Draco, so he took a gamble and told him about the war in the past. He did not mention of Bellatrix trying to find Draco to kill him though. That was a bit too much.
Smiles bloomed from every person in the room when they all saw Dumbledore. Lily stood primly as she greeted Albus, followed by James who then gestured for the Headmaster to sit. Molly left the room saying that she would bring up some tea for all of them.
“What, is the story done?” She stretched herself like a cat and sat up while rubbing her eyes. Beau acted like a blanket on her feet and she grinned.
Everyone watched as he fell, his eyes snapped quickly to Orion who looked just as shocked in his eyes, but remained composed as those marked ones around him was hiding the mirth in their eyes.
Memories trickled in due to the scene and remembered that she had always had a knack for knowing before the marks appear. She could see the cursed red-strings of fate connecting one person to the other. She once thought of it as a gift as she could easily find where her other half is, but as she huffed and turned away.
Draco held up his palm. Orion and Dumbledore watched as a sudden ball of light appeared on Draco’s hand, only for it to be reformed. Soon the light dissipated and all that was left in Draco’s hand was a dagger.
“Marius? Are you okay?”
“Take me to my room please.”
No matter how many times Hermione hear about the Grimoires, she still could never accept the fact that once demons roamed their lands.
All eyes widened at the revelation.
Blaise held up a hand to stop him and Neville did as told before he began fiddling with his hand, completely apologetic.
The spirit smiled and Hermione’s eyes widened.
Draco released a breath he was holding to all the new information he had just received. He had to leave. He had to go…
”, a shriek was called out from the living room only to echo into the entire house was heard and the house shook from the sheer power.
A chuckle reverberated in the room and all heads turned to stare at Ephira Zabini. She did not seem fazed at this and merely smiled with her fangs glistening, Blaise’s clear annoyance with his mother showed by his eye roll.
“Padma.” The last one of the trio struggled to hold the Indian back. “You—“
When Harry noticed Marius wearing Lestrange’s school robes, he almost couldn’t stop a growl from his throat. It didn’t help him when Lestrange’s sharp eyes went to his direction once again. The Vampire was coming closer after that, but fortunately, he was tugged by Marius. This was then that Harry noticed they were holding hands.
"My loyalty lies to him and no one else. If ending the war is what he ever desires, I will willingly shake hands with Potter to fulfill it."
“You want us to charm it to hide who you are”
Lily began to hug herself at what she heard. She couldn't believe that someone would be capable of performing that kind of magic, that kind of barbaric deed at this age. James instantly felt his mate's emotions as he stood up and hugged her. He tried his hardest to soothe her until she calmed down for a while.
While the child raised by Bellatrix was raised in full darkness, in fear, in blood, in lies. The two children were never allowed to meet, raised separately. The only person the child ever found comfort in was Orion, as he told him things about Draco, at times the war in secret. But even Orion could not protect him with the onslaught of Bellatrix’s madness.
She turned back to look at Marius clutching his neck. She crouched and grazed her hand at his pale neck. The coldness of her fingers made Marius shiver.
He had to keep up the smile, the laugh, the mirth in his mercurial eyes as he killed, his hands soaked in blood each day. He would carry this weight all of his life. He knew the pleas of the people he killed, he tortured. They would forever haunt his dreams and memories for as long as he would live. The moment he regained his faculties, he was about to kill someone, he was about to rip her heart out. His whole being rejected the idea but he felt her, Bellatrix’s presence always there, ever present. He knew one wrong move from him would result in death.
“Is it true?”
Agravain knows that she is about to lose, she could feel the exhaustion in her bones. She looked up at her who just pouted and held a dark sword in her hands as the wraith floated just behind her.
“Hold her off for me will you?”, the child then walked to the passage and disappeared down as if the power within had no effect to him.
Orion was about to respond, but his eyelids grew too heavy for him to form coherent words. In no time, the world turned black.
. There was something about Harry that just pulled him in and Marius was curious as to what that connection was. He wanted to know more about it. He felt safe just being by Harry’s side, something that Marius has not felt in a long while.
“What was that one Centaur spouting about anyway?” he asked before he entered the portal.
Penelope glared at the High witch and Andromeda haughtily ignored her. Instead, she began addressing James. "Alpha James, you have to understand if Bellatrix were to get her hands on my sister's corpse, she will use it against us. After all, even in death, she could use my sister's body to draw magic and even try to break the barrier."
He tampered it all down and watched as Orion then inhaled deeply at Draco's wrist. His eyes then widen in shock and full of horror as he tentatively returned Draco's wrist down. He snapped his gaze to Harry. There was no question to what he was saying, they needed to talk now.
“That is fine by me, thank you once again for this”
Orion huffed. “Of course I know that, but you know what will happen if he does find out. Draco will tear this place to shreds and he will die before he would get to them.”
Ron immediately straightened his back as he nodded and regarded Harry fully. When he coaxed him to talk, he didn’t exactly expect Harry to open up to him just like that. Usually, it took some inspiring words from Hermione until he broke the ice but never this. So Ron braced himself and opened his ears to hear whatever Harry would say.
“I mean just look at how he brews each potion, he doesn’t even look at the books for guidance and he is even humming”, and Ron took a look and that was when they saw Marius already finishing up two of the potions and now bottling them up.
who right now is traipsing with your Father’s enemies.” The boy glared at her with a passion and Bellatrix merely sauntered to sit at the foot of the bed. “It’s not your brother’s fault that he was tainted by your Mother’s ideals that those mudboods would seek to have peace with us. Oh no, because all those mudbloods want is to eradicate us all.”
Harry stopped in his tracks as soon as Lestrange called out to him. He was focusing on his senses while trying his best to remove the horrible scent of Lestrange. He tried to concentrate on the scent of Narcissa, but the git would not allow him to do so.
and quick question: who here is a klance shipper?
“Is something the matter?” He asked softly.
“Being a witch has its perks Harry how many times have I told you that”, then Harry gave a boyish smile then he stood up and stretched picked up the letter and they all said their goodnight’s as the two werewolves headed up the stairs and Hermione headed off to Ravenclaw Tower.
“—got along so well?” They finished together that made Harry look at them with a face of horror. He was about to retort when Lestrange began to speak, his voice devoid of any emotion as he placed both of his hands behind his back. Harry could see that he was clutching his right wrist tightly.
“What do you choose, Miss Granger? Time is running out,” the ghost-like appearance of Narcissa Black whispered to her as she stood awaiting her answer.
“I know.” Severus held Draco’s hand and he gave him a small smile. “I apologize, but I had no other choice.”
"Though you can't share that information with anyone else outside this room,” Marius said.
Marius settled his head comfortably on Lestrange’s nape and slowly, his breath was evening. They were gone then, Lestrange carefully walked away carrying Marius on his back, leaving Harry who was beyond shocked. The werewolf was confused at everything—his feelings, Lestrange’s sudden change in behavior. When he made sure that they were fully gone, his cloak fell at his feet, stunned to watch where the two stood a while ago.
“I’m sorry, Blaise.”
She was surprised when she felt the power emanating from the child that stood beside the old vampire that her hands fell to her sides. Soon Albus’ face was seen and the child, no it was not a child as she stood quite tall next to Albus. Her face obscured by a huge hood. She waited until the vampire introduced them as she could not form any words.
Orion only shrugged his shoulders at the comment. “Well, if you are in the mood to brawl with him then do so. Don’t expect me to fight your battles with you.” His tone that clearly challenged anyone who was stupid enough to do what he said, combined by the grin coming a second after, had the higher year that spoke paled. Happy with the impact he made, the Lestrange vampire walked away.
’ upon his opponent only to see it hit but cause no effect as it dissipated.
"I never knew Harry was capable of that. I suppose it is best to keep it under the wraps for now until we are sure of it."
Hawthorn, ten inches with unicorn hair as its core, he held the wand in his hand and he closed his eyes feeling the familiar tinge of his magic in it. He opened his eyes and a smile graced his lips. Looking back in the mirror standing next to his closet, he waved his wand and felt his magic settled to his whole being as the glamour set in.
please comment on it, would appreciate it since im still new at making this fanfic, thanks!!
He knew Draco would be already out of the castle and on the move to Gryffindor Lands. He just had to trust his allies to assure that he would arrive there safely and he could finally have his own piece of mind.
A few footsteps were then heard, signaling the presence of the two late vampires who seated themselves next to Pansy, in front of Orion and Marius.
Her mind reverted as she knew the spell that Draco used. For now, she had to keep up her barrier or risk getting killed, permanently.
“What is the meaning of this, witch?”
The wind suddenly blew and the cold air caused the human to further shiver and snuggle to Harry’s heat. Harry wanted to place him in his lap and hug him from behind to cover him up with his own warmth but he knew if Marius woke up, he would not want to be in that kind of situation with Harry.
“I will be right out, Orion,” he told his cousin.
“Possessed? What does that mean, Hermione?”
That was all Hermione heard while she watched her barrier break into a million pieces in front of her. She quickly tried to reform it as she was pushed back, but the wolf was faster and slashed at her.
Theo can only chuckle at his friend’s antics before he asked, “So, where is this beast anyway?”
“That is going to serve as a warning that is what is going to happen to those who oppose our Lord.”
It was Pansy who finally able to speak next. “Are you certain that potion exists and the grimoire is located in this castle?”
Theo grinned at her as he jumped down. He landed gracefully, his eyes gleaming with knowing understanding. “Wanna know where Chang does her dirty work?”
"What is wrong?" He held up his hand to touch Draco's face and it was warm, so warm that Draco could not help but lean into it as he whispered back.
"You're bleeding." The stranger just gave out a small chuckle as Harry then took out his handkerchief and wrapped it along with his bleeding hand. "Don't laugh," Harry scolded and the stranger stopped as he smiled, amused.
“I think Flint needs to be reminded some manners.”
“I’m sorry”, she voiced out as a hand then clutched her shoulder and everything went to a standstill once again. The eyes that Hermione was so used to turned different and the mischievousness within them turned into something more akin to rage.
A light then began to emanate from her chest and a book materialized. It was a thick tome, its cover just but a simple leather. As Hermione held it in her hands, she could feel a warm magic enveloped her. A mark appeared on her arm, similar to the mark that is engraved on the front of the book as if linking her to it. She then opened it, only to find that the pages were blank. She tried to emit her magic like in the library, but no words appeared.
Narcissa croaked out.
Ron was frantically scribbling on his parchment about the things he knew about vampires that particular afternoon. His writing was a mess and since classes were about to be over, he needed to go to Professor Snape’s hell hole and wash the cauldrons. As soon as he realized that Harry would not show, he started on his essay but the time was not enough. He was about to pull on his hair when a thick tome fell on the table in front of him.
Marius was quite early. The only ones awake were the early-birds. He opened the door to the Great Hall only to have heads snapped to his direction. This was the first time he had this much attention and he did not know what to do, so he looked down and headed to the Hufflepuff table.
“He does not belong to you. He can be with who he ever damn wants,” Harry retorted.
away after that, her cackle of laughter echoing as the snake devoured the land and the mountain to ashes.
Neville looked down once more and Blaise did not stop approaching him, Marius and Theo was watching this development with keen interest. Theo was a bit surprised he knew this would happen eventually but he did not expect it to happen this soon. He then looked at Marius who was currently watching the scene unfold his eyes guarded, but his smile betrayed his face as he seemed pleased.
Marius didn’t know he was crying again until Harry began wiping his tears softly, carefully.
Despite seeing his friends happy, Marius knew everything was far from over. This was just the beginning of their journey. In order to free the vampires from the mark that bound them, they needed to find someone who could possibly break the spell of the Dark Lord since searching for a person who bears the blood of the Malfoys is no longer an option. He released a heavy sigh. It looked like he had to gather up more information.
“Let’s go on then, my humble steed!”
“A warning to those filthy mutts that sooner or later we will purge them of their mudblood”
Draco’s mind froze, his eyes widened and her arm that was raised up for a shield fell down to his side. “H-how?”
“I understand Mother.” Regulus went on to hug him once again. Draco’s heart warmed as he could not help but be reminded of Harry through him.
“What is a mere livestock doing in Hogwarts?”, his voice was cold, sharp and scathing, but still there was a hint of exhaustion in his tone. When Marius saw the other’s appearance he lifted one of his eyebrows when he saw the uncanny similarity. He saw his picture at the Black Family tree from Gringotts, he did not expect to meet a part of his family this quick and he was not prepared to meet, Bellatrix Black’s son. He was pulled away from his thoughts when he felt hands encircling his neck, he held onto the hand as he was raised in the air.
“Andrew, enough.” The soft voice of his twin stopped Andrew with his egging. She turned her head to Orion’s direction. “If you can’t take it anymore or need blood, all you have to do is kill someone and drain their blood. It will ease the pain and that way, you could also eat normally like you were before.”
Draco nodded like a broken doll telling a story that haunted him every single day of his life. “Power.” Then he suddenly looked up at Harry, his eyes full of fear and unshed tears as his lips wobbled. “I’m scared, Harry. I-I don’t want to—“
“I wish of you good luck, Draco Black”, he whispered to himself as he saw the back of the boy walk away headed to one of the guest rooms along with his huge dog.
But as soon as he approached the large window, feeling the cold fresh air whipping his face, he smiled. The stairs were worth it after all. He then began to walk near the ledge of the Tower. When he reached it, he held on to it as he closed his eyes just to feel the air. It calmed him down almost effortlessly and the feeling of euphoria enveloped him. There were no high places near where they lived before. Just small slopes where he and Beau used to lounge on after collecting herbs from the forest.
oooh and before any of you guys read this next chapter i just wanna apologize for the mistake i made at the previous chapter: MERLIN IS A WITCH not a wizard he is a female in this fanfic...it was my mistake and im truly sorry for that if Authlene had not pointed it out i would not have realized it..anyway enough of my rant onwards to the chapter hihi
"She said that she left the key to destroying the Horcruxes in her Grimoire, but we don't even know where her Grimoire is."
“Amortentia, sir”, several students snapped their heads at him and Snape tried to suppress a smile on his face.
Something does not add up. Hermione could feel her instinct screamed that there was something missing from the memory, something she did not know and that was the answer to the question.
“Uhm Headmaster, will I be staying alone at Hufflepuff?”, he tilted his head.
Mother is not mad at me. She is smiling at me
. What is wrong, Orion?" the human’s voice was calming the storm within Orion.
The Vampire then retreated his previous attacking posture and straightened his posture as he stepped back and began to kneel on one side of the circle prepared.
Orion crossed his arms. Despite the Blood Ward, they had no way to find out who is the enemy on the inside. Yes, he knew how strong the Blood Ward is. It was impregnable but in the inside, one can easily make loopholes. Especially if that one is his mother and her elite witches. He had seen it, her research. They were brutal and took a lot of energy and time from her mother but she was able to create a way.
“She released Leviathan, and Bellatrix clearly knew her as she even stood by her side”, Ginny released a gasp as her mouth went wide open. But she could not accept it, could never accept that the girl she knew would ever do that. The girl who talked so honestly and straightforwardly, she was a hell lot of odd but she was her best friend. Her eyes flared with determination when she looked up at Hermione and Ron.
“Well that is no need Headmaster, instead may I ask what is a human doing in my classroom?”, he raised his eyebrow in question at Marius’ direction.
“Did anyone tell you?” Harry said, looking up at the ceiling and closing his eyes just a bit. He could feel the eyes of Marius watching his every move. He could feel the slight confusion in Marius' voice as he replied.
The boy’s head slowly tilted to look up at Orion who was looking at him filled with worry. He blinked once, twice. When he fully registered what was happening, he looked around and began to scream in agony. Orion could do nothing but to hug him.
“Hospital wing. Now!” Marius commanded sharply. Ron quickly obliged, leaving his shocked friends in his wake. No one could command Ron that way. Not anyone except Harry, as he was the Alpha.
A hand stopped Ron when he was about to run after her, he looked toward Hermione and saw something in her eyes, trust. He was about to question it but Hermione voiced out.
"Who were you talking to Harry?", said Hermione placing her hand on his shoulder.
“Do not worry. I have no idea what your plans are Headmaster, but is it wise for a stranger like her to weave her magic amongst these walls?”
Hermione just shook her head at him. “No need to thank me, Harry. We are like siblings.”
Orion gulped before bowing his head and staring at his bracelet. His hand was unconsciously caressing it. He then closed his eyes as memories began to play on his mind. When he opened them again, Draco was subjected to pools of emptiness direct gaze.
"Where?" Sirius was the one who asked as he closed his eyes, his hands clenching. He was still feeling bitter for the way that he had no idea how his cousin died.
Marius was this close to hex her himself. “Just because she is a Dark witch you attacked her? Then what makes you any better? Three seniors attacking a single student, a junior, without any reason at all?” The other two flinched as silver eyes glared at them with malice.
“Really? Well this is the Room of Requirement, everything you require this room to be, will be” he grinned wickedly and then he took over the supposed desk of Snape and sat on it, opening their Potions book in a random page.
A sparkle of something flashed in her eyes before it was once again disappeared.
“Come on. If Theo were to find out that we are slacking, we will never hear the end of it.” She smiled and Neville took her hand as he stood up and seeing Pansy in a new light. He found a friend in her.
The door opened and he saw Ron and the other Weasleys entering the pack's house to wish him a Harry Birthday. Everyone was present. Everything was so bright and he was so happy. But in the midst of it all, a voice began to call on his name as he looked back to see nothing other than the backyard.
to all who left me kudos, comments, subscribed and bookmarked this story huge thanks to all of you always!
“Dear nephew, I did not know you had this kind of humour. The chains you placed on my Dementors are fading, soon they will all be here and sucking the life of all you love”
That was when Marius realized he apparently didn’t have the whole day for himself. He pouted once again. “Tomorrow, then,” he offered. “Harry told me things about the war but only the gist of it. Besides, I want to learn it from your side as well. I want to understand.”
“It seems you are struggling to keep the balance in your magic. Don’t worry, I will assure you that you will find clarity in the darkness.” She took out the wand of Luna and began to chant as she cast a veiling shield, cutting the two of them away from the real world to not be seen.
Marius clutched his necklace and fiddled with it for a while before taking a deep breath and releasing it, then he turned to the corner to look for Izzy, seeing that she is not anywhere there he called upon her.
“My name is not Avada,” the werewolf said.
He entered the Hufflepuff common room only to see his cousin Orion looking stiff as ever and Beau sitting at the carpet away from Orion. His eyebrows raised at this. The dog usually sleepy by the feet of Orion when he visited.
“I apologize Remus, Headmaster and Lady Andromeda but we have to go”, he then dragged Ron out of the Room of Requirement and as soon as they were out Ron exploded.
Orion’s eyes snapped open. He looked at his cousin whose silver eyes gleamed with determination.
“The way you looked at one of the Weasley twins… It was as if you were pained. Tell me why.”
Pansy smiled widely at him and began to run the other direction but was stopped when Orion shouted at her.
Marius released a huge sigh, his mind was so full of things already. He did not want to leave Hogwarts while having bad blood with Harry. It would not be right and it would bug him all the time.
“Tsk!”, she irked and wiped her blood with the back of her hand, then uttered another spell that easily cured her.
“The secret Chamber created by one of the Founders, Rowena Ravenclaw.”
“Thanks, Professor,” he said as he easily slipped from his seat. Before going to his place next to Orion, he stopped a bit to whisper to the still gaping Neville.
“Take it, Marius. Besides werewolves have higher resistance to cold than humans.” He gave a small smile before he followed Hermione in the Owlery.
Harry and Ron watched her as her face paled.
“Now Mr. Clarke please take any seat you wish to occupy”, and he nodded his head, seeing an empty seat next to what looked to be a Gryffindor, he took his seat there and the rest of the class still stared at him.
Annoyed, Harry tsked at him before retracting his teeth back to normalcy. “What is it Ron?” he almost snapped. It sounded more like a tired sigh at the end, though.
Theo chuckled before it died down several second later. The vampire took a deep breath before saying, “Orion.”
Marius felt like taking back what he said about those eyes having the same color as the Killing Curse.
"What are you doing here?" Harry voiced out as he tilted his head, his ruffled up hair falling slightly to one side. His huge green eyes watched the stranger with interest.
"I will help you with your Vampire Studies essay and in return…" she then leaned in as she placed one of her elbows on the table so she could rest her chin on the back of her hand. The way her hair cradled her face made Ron want to touch her cheek, but he drove that thought away as he raised an eyebrow with a bored look. "...You will help me with my Werewolf Studies essay. How about that?"
Light blue eyes snapped open and Luna found herself lying on the floor the circle still present around her. She sat up slowly allowing, her body to feel accustomed to what her Master did. She lifted up her hand to feel her head, only to find the bracelet she removed to once again reappeared on her wrist.
—Neville was chanting this in his head as he felt his grip on his wolf fading.
Marius looked back at Harry who remained silent at the whole exchange. He picked up the cloak that the Werewolf left him to return it. “Harry, here. Thank you.”
“When Lucius learned of this, he tried to fight back. But the sudden surprise attack left him defenseless. The Families that were taken and controlled were: the Carrows, Lestranges, Rosiers, Rowles, and Yaxleys. It is said that even if the Dark Lord took over as the Elder, he could not fully control all of the other older families of vampires due to the fact that Lucius did not pass onto him the mark and power of being the Elder of the vampire race.” Theo as he continued on as if a broken record. This was the darkest days of their races’ history and when he heard about it, he could not stop the rage he felt. Then the sorrow and pain.
“—survive this.”, the hooded figure then turned his back as he helped up Barty and the Dementors, Draco held back broke out of their chains. Hermione and the other witches casted a barrier made out of Patronuses.
Marius nodded and after that, Neville went on his way to the Gryffindor Tower.
Marius' eyes narrowed as he tried to look strong. “You want me alone with you.”
Orion knew his cousin was honest when he said he was sorry, so he let out a puff of breath. “Alright. I saw parts of your memories anyway so we’re practically the same.”
“What is that letter on the table?” Pansy started to ask.
“No she is currently the High witch and I doubt that even her will be wary in fear of Bellatrix”
Blaise was about to protest, but Orion’s eyes stopped him from doing so.
“Tell Harry I went to catch some sleep in my apartment, share me what you guys find out okay?”, Ron was confused as to why Hermione was concerned about their current case but knowing her she probably just want to help since muggles are being killed by some maniac again.
“Marius that is enough,” Harry voiced out sternly before the human could get his voice any higher. Marius glared at him before he turned again to the girl. This time, his voice was lower but colder.
“I’ll sleep on the couch.” He pointed the couch at the huge room of Draco but then the blonde’s hand tightened on his sleeve.
“—we would follow you anywhere,” George finished with matching grins on their faces. The rest of their pack mates nodded at this.
Hermione raised her eyebrow at this. She watched Harry squirmed for a bit before she was sure that the werewolf would not say anything, then she asked, “Is there something wrong?”
She looked down to see huge rubble of stones preventing her from doing so. Her surroundings were full of destruction and she could see Pomona passed out on one corner her head bleeding. She clutched her wand in her hand and mustered up the strength to cast a spell to lift the rubble covering her lower body.
"Potter, follow me," Lestrange called out as he guided Harry to the room of Marius. As soon as he saw the bed, he laid the human down. Before Harry could place the blanket over him, Orion beat him to the punch. Marius slept by his side, his face being tickled by his hair once again that Orion seemed to have noticed and brushed it away from his face.
“You are probably thinking how I knew.” Marius then shrugged and explained. “Since you’re Gryffindor’s Alpha and Lestrange is the Elder of Slytherin… rivals are inevitable, right?”
“It has been a long time since I have seen people enter this place.” A voice boomed. It sounded feminine enough to pass as a female’s. The echo it made around the room made it hard to point exactly where it came from.
A gasp erupted from Neville and Pansy. The other’s shocked expression were not missed by Marius.
Harry awoke with a start. He could feel his wolf squirming deep inside of him to be released, to be let out. Harry knows that if the urge ever comes he knew he could never stop his wolf from trying to come out. However, he could not allow himself to transform inside of the dorms. Releasing a tired sigh, he removed his blanket, changed his clothes as quietly as possible and stepped out of the rooms.
“Tell me how to remove her from my friend’s body”, Lucifer’s eyebrow rose but she approached them carefully as she was still wary of Leviathan who remained silent till now.
"Don't worry, I am very patient, unlike my mother who would surely force you to submission. Though, this will be an interesting game between us." She smiled as she turned back on her heels, walking back to the entrance but continued talking.
“The hell are you talking about?” Ron growled out as he pushed Blaise away but the vampire just remained giddy.
“Oh wow, is the world now about to end? You just said that
Marius’ voice broke Orion’s thoughts. He nodded slowly.
Harry silenced him by covering Marius' lips with his free hand.
“What is wrong Blaise?”, Theo asked in a sing-song voice.
Draco looked down, feeling the weight of what the Headmaster is asking of him. His heart was beating erratically, his thoughts spiraling into a huge mess. He felt the Headmaster’s hand fall away. “I will do what I can, but do not expect me to stay. You and I both know what will happen if I ever stay. Everywhere I go, war will follow. Both sides will do their hardest to obtain me one way or another.”
The hologram disappeared. Sirius clutched it to him, his fists clenched to it. "What about my nephew? Where is he?"
She was an old woman. Grey hairs were already starting to show from her pitch black hair. She was wearing a shawl over her light lavender dress.
Luna awoke to see herself in the mirror where she usually communicates with her Master. Her eyes widened. She looked around her to see if any of her friends were there with her and she released a sigh finding out that she was alone. She stood up from where she was seated and she passed by the huge walk-in mirror of their dorm when she noticed something.
It was now mid-October and the weather was tuning more colder than before and so Harry clutched on his Invisibility cloak closer to his chest. He sighed deeply as he looked above the sky in the Astronomy Tower, all he was thinking about when he returned to Hogwarts was that he might meet his Mate. But ever since he entered the huge doors of the Great Hall no scent ever called onto him. Instead it made him much more agitated, it felt as if there is a huge hole in his very being that he cannot fulfill. The huge itch to scour the world to find his Mate was tempting but he knew that his parents would not allow him to abandon his responsibilities.
With great force, he tore his eyes away. “Then shall we begin the search?” he said in an attempt at keeping his mind off Marius. Everyone in the room seemed to brighten up as they all shouted their chorused
Draco gave him a look of affirmation as he tilted his head back to stop the bleeding.
“I fear that is a bit too late as of the moment, Young Black. As Lady Narcissa died her protection upon you weakened allowing your existence to be known”
“Y-yeah I will”
Narcissa’s voice broke as sobs began to rack her body. She rested her hand on her stomach where her child grew.
Hermione choked off a reply. “Wh—what?”
He then changed his pajamas into black pants and a white shirt. On top of it, he wore his school robes as it was a bit resistant to the cold. He decided to go to the Astronomy Tower since high places always made him calm and so he began his trek, careful not to be caught by the school’s keeper. Especially his cat.
"I want to lessen his burden," said Draco.
Severus remained quiet as he merely watched the exchange of Bellatrix and the Dark Lord about the twins.
It took the human three deep exhales and inhales before he finally could turned his head towards Madam Pomfrey and bowed his head.
“There was something about him, Ron.” Harry looked up then, his eyes meeting Ron’s, and he could see just how much Harry was fond of Marius. “I can’t explain it, but he was different. So different that I’m afraid if I ever look away just one second from him, he will disappear and I can’t bear how that makes me feel. I know I just met him but…” Harry began to slide down the wall and sat down on the floor, his hands rested on his knees as he faced the wall opposite them.
“Marius?” Harry repeated urgently.
Draco's eyes softened at this. "I am sorry for giving you such a heavy burden."
Andromeda turned her gaze toward the headmaster. “I apologize for my sudden outburst, but it truly seems like this school needs to be purged fully from dark witches, Albus.”
Minerva had her suspicions but hearing this made everything clear.
“So this could also mean that it is possible that, that is not her true form?” Minerva asked and Dumbledore merely smiled at her his eyes twinkling.
“My name. Call me by it.”
he thought grimly.
Harry’s forehead then touched his. Draco felt as if all his fears were blown away.
Luna, standing around the other witches, looked like she was a bit afraid before she slipped away from the crowd of students, slowly but surely moving out of the room.
—blue-grey eyes looked up at him. Orion then whispered in a voice that he knows would be heard by any of them in the room, but he did not care.
When he arrived, the same exhaustion he felt as usual after the trek up helped him cool off. He leaned against the wall and after a while, he closed his eyes as he let himself be drowned by his previously locked thoughts. He instantly felt tears prickled down his cheek because it
“Ugh I don’t get why you would think that I like him that way”, Theo could almost pull his hair out of frustration sometimes when dealing with Blaise and his wrong assumptions.
“Wait. You could read this gibberish?” Ron gasped.
Tears fell from his eyes as he closed them. He could feel his magic fighting over the little balance he had kept for years. He remembered the time when the balance of his magic once broke free. It pained him to remember about his death, but he dug deeper to remember his mother’s words that day he found his body in that forest, his mangled soul not even allowed to pass on. The darkness seeped out, seeking blood to the one who caused him harm. He could barely remember that day as it hurt him. But he could now hear the words his mother uttered that day.
Hermione gasped at that. Time-based spells were the hardest to cast, almost impossible.
They all waited for the Headmaster’s reaction. Marius was also prepared to defend Orion but fortunately, Dumbledore merely released a deep sigh. His eyes then turned to the vampire who just looked at him as if he was prepared to allow the Headmaster to attack him at any moment, feeling that it was only right since he was asked to kill him.
The haughty tone made Hermione turn her back on the scene to face the grinning Orion Lestrange. Behind him was Pansy Parkinson who was looking at the duo by the tree with interest gleaming in her eyes.
"Don't call me Avada."
Marius released a soft sigh as he let his head fell onto Harry’s shoulder.
"You don't have to worry about me, Professor."
"How could I not have foreseen this?" the vampire looked as if he had failed all of them and he closed his eyes as if the word pained him so.
Harry swallowed as he thought of ways on how to avoid a full-on attack from Bellatrix. She was after all the most precious sword of the Dark Lord.
“Not yet, but when I do, I will be sure to tell you.” She gave a small smile towards Hermione. She looked behind the brunet only for her face to pale.
“But for now—“
(See the end of the chapter for
“And that is what I leave for you to find out, Hermione Granger. You are smart after all. Prove to me that you truly are worthy,” the spirit said before everything became black.
"It is like a sire bond, Marius. We cannot go to war and fight to death without any reason at all. Without an Elder to lead us, we couldn’t function easily. Just like how a pack cannot function without an Alpha, we cannot do it as well. Yes, we fear the Dark Lord, but above all our bloodline is not allowed to be lost. Without our bloodlines, the vampires born or bitten will have no leader and they will all wasted away following no order. They will be killed and punished and be brought to Azkaban. Worse, they’d be turned to follow the Dark Lord’s rule. Only a few of us remain now as most of the others were conquered by the Dark Lord.”
Hermione abruptly stood up before pacing around. “No, that is impossible! I could understand it if it were transferred to another object, but to take over a living human?” Her eyes widened suddenly.
Bellatrix skipped to pick up a knife on a nearby table and she slit her palm as she began chanting, she could almost feel the fear and taste it emanating from her slaves. Then a spell she learned from one of her dear sisters she casted on the five simultaneously.
“Sleep. You need it.”
but Ron had to keep up his appearance so he sneered at Pansy’s direction.
She reached the confines of her spell and torture room. She frowned when she realized she was not alone. Her husband was present along with Fenrir Greyback. Both were sitting to each of her couch opposite to each other, both eyes snapped to her.
With an evil glint in his eyes that Harry did not seem to realize, Fred listened smugly as Harry obliviously began telling him all about Marius.
“I don’t have to answer that”, and she then dragged Ginny to where the engraved words are and she released her. With Luna’s wand she sliced open both their hands as blood flowed upon the engraved words.
“I will not make a deal with you Parkinson,” he said as he ignored the Vampire and decided to write stuff again on his parchment.
“Why are you here Parkinson?”
“No one,” he hastily said.
thank you for giving this story of mine a read! im open to any comments!
His eyes then travelled back to the human—
How could he miss all of that?
The room turned quiet. None of them was willing to speak. That was until Hermione quivering lips moved again.
“You are about to put too much, which would’ve caused your potion to explode”, he merely stated then he let go of his wrist, then Neville slowly lowered his hand and began to take the proper amount then dropped it on his cauldron, he sighed when the cauldron did not explode then he turned towards the human.
"A Horcrux is an object in which a witch could draw more power from the soul that they had trapped in."
“My, what beautiful creatures, Bella,” the Dark Lord voiced out as he saw the babies on the ground, still crying. His eyes then stared at her. “You did well.”
They stayed like that for a while, surrounded by a bubble of lulling heartbeats and light feelings.
“After you do it, return back to me in this same place.”
Draco unknowingly gritted his teeth at the sight of the mark, wanting to erase it and replace it with his own mark. However, he could not deny just how beautiful it looked, the swirls of the runes written, translating an unbreakable bond forming the infinity mark.
"But what is her relevance, Remus?", Hermione added as she finished reciting.
When she tried to hit him again, Theo raised both of his arms and smiled. Marius just watched their interaction fondly.
“What happened after?”, and Hermione went on about how the black dome disappeared and she found them collapsed inside the house and Penny Elmore dead. Then they were taken immediately to St. Mungos for treatment, there were no injuries found in their bodies but it was all due to the exhaustion that they collapsed. There was a moment of silence after Hermione’s explanation and there was a twitch in Harry’s brow when he repeated what Hermione just told him in his head.
Harry looked up at Orion, his eyes a mix of emotions. "Who would do such a thing?"
Nymphadora grinned as she began to ask. “For what reason do you give your oath to?” Her hand was now on the shoulder of the boy.
Orion seemed confused at this as well, so he tested as he asked. “Do you mean to turn him mortal?”
“Sorry, I was distracted,” Harry apologized, successfully managing to sound both worryingly frustrated and genuinely guilty at the same time.
"He won't talk, will he?" Ron asked worriedly. After seeing Marius' spark of anger a while ago, he felt threatened that he might spill it because of that incident.
Hermione’s eyebrows rose at this, her mind began to find what Wrackspurts are only to find no knowledge about such creatures. Therefore, to be polite, she went along with the younger witch.
“Okay, what do you need us for?” Ginny raised a perfectly curved eyebrow at Hermione which the brown-haired girl just smiled at her in humor as if used to it.
Orion sighed. He stood up after that before turning around to face Draco and patted his head. "It's late, go to bed. Filch would catch you." Of course Draco wasn’t about to let go without any protest. The vampire stopped him before he could say anything, though. "Sit with me tomorrow at Slytherin. The least I could do is protect you inside of these walls. And don’t use any more of your magic. God-forbid if Mother found out about your power."
“I’m sorry it must’ve been a horrible thing for you to see”, Ron voiced out his voice laced with sympathy and the woman snorted which made the two looked up at her.
She could feel the emotions of Lucifer swirling, anger, sadness and mortification at what Nymphadora made her do. She just snorted as she then gestured for the two familiars to follow her.
Draco began to explain what he observed. "When I bound him with pure magic, he was able to break from it without any injuries. I had to infuse my magic to the roots to hold him down, but I could feel that he was beginning to drain the magic from them as well the longer he stayed within the roots' clutch. Also when I used magic on him to bring him back. He did them all unconsciously." He ended his explanation when blood trickled down his nose again, this time it almost flowed down to his chin.
“Are you sure that it would be best to be brewing this potion here, Marius?” Hermione came closer to Marius to show him the Grimoire.
“Luna”, Ginny was about to rush to her side and undo the bindings she placed on her friend but Luna screamed.
Hermione stood up from the ground and looked around the expanse of darkness that surrounded her. Her body seemed to be glowing, providing some kind of light.
Ginny looked at it with a deadpan expression. “So, it’s gibberish.”
“Since the other one will be a spare, may I, my Lord raise him?” The Dark Lord’s eyebrow rose at this and so she explained. “I wish to train the spare to be my heir. Children born from Witch Trees are rare and I wouldn’t want to pass up on an opportunity such as this.”
Harry looked so conflicted. But in his eyes, Draco could see understanding in them. He pushed forward.
“But Professor isn’t that too much?”, and both Professor Snape and the human looked at him as if he was saying something wrong, then Snape raised his eyebrows at him.
“Hey! Just so you know Beau was a wild dog before till I made him all soft and now he won’t even let me leave his side!” The human said with so much smugness in his face that made Theo wanted to burst into another wave of laughter. But then a line caught his interest that he spoke in a thinly veiled curiosity.
but was soon forgotten as Theo continued to talk. “Searching for the Chamber in a huge castle is a hard task, Marius. If we could—“ Pansy shook her head at Theo. That was then that Theo remembered Potter still hadn’t apologized to Marius and so the strained relationship between the two.
"… Oh, um, thanks for the offer, but I promised Theo, Blaise, and Neville, we would study together," he said and whether it was his eyes playing trick or something, he saw Harry's face turned disappointed at this.
Draco’s eyes widened his eyes brimming with unshed tears. Harry just caressed his thumb to his cheek.
"Why did you not inform me that Draco Black has been here in this castle prancing about as Marius Clarke?"
“How should I approach him? I can’t just suddenly go talk to him for no reason.”
“So you are asking me to surrender?”, a sinister grin and spark appeared upon her face.
He turned to his right, staring at Regulus. And then to his left, to Corvus, whose bond with him seemingly weak. “What did Bellatrix do to you?”
The owl then again landed right to the Slytherin's table right infront of Blaise and Theo. They looked at each other before shrugging and taking the letter. They opened it and read the single sentence written on it. Theo and Blaise grinned widely at this then Blaise folded the letter and placed it in his pocket. He then stood up picking up his bag Pansy Parkinson looked at both of them her eyebrows quirked up.
Im just popping in to leave this chap for you all! i am hoping you all will love this chapter just as i did writing it!XD
Marius clutched the necklace that seals his magic and willed a substantial amount of his power to flow in his body. The sudden feeling of magic that ran through his veins suddenly warmed up his whole being, better than the small amount he usually had to endure when the seal was still on. He closed his eyes and when he opened them, black irises flashed as a cloud of mist engulfed the surroundings.
Severus' eyes narrowed and he huffed. "Do not get cocky, Orion. But might I ask, how did were you able to bow yourself to Potter and gain his trust? Don't tell me you begged?"
“So, she was pregnant when she sealed the Dark Lord? And made the Blood Ward?”
“Yes, I am is there something wrong?”, she looked at them from top to toe and her mouth turned to an o.
Neville looked back at the place Marius occupied and then the seat next to Theo that would lead him directly to Blaise. He cursed inwardly for letting Marius once again manipulate the situation he was avoiding almost all week. Now, the thought of sitting next to Lestrange seems the lesser of two evils. He was suddenly interrupted from his epiphany when Snape snapped at him once again.
The spirit smiled and answered truthfully. “She chose both”
They stayed there for a few more minutes before Harry schooled his features and stood up, holding out a hand to Ron’s direction. Ron took the offered hand and they began to walk towards the Hufflepuff Common Room.
The way Marius said his name made his wolf purr in delight. It looked like he wasn't the only one enamored by Marius. He leaned closer but before he could attempt to claim those plump lips, Marius suddenly sat up. He began to rub his eyes showing his sleepiness.
Closing her eyes, she felt as if she heard her name being called. She could feel her body being possessed by another as she felt herself falling once again and she knew at that moment, Nymphadora has taken over control.
“I am not oogling him”, he said defensively and crossed his hands at his chest and huffed.
Parkinson stopped viewing her nails at that. "No. Why would I need mutts help when I can take you on myself?" Her voice was dripping with venom that made Flint took a step back.
"But when I taught him in my class, I never once associated him that much with Narcissa. Yes, there were similarities but his manners were—" before he could voice out something he shook his head and the Headmaster watched him with keen eyes as he lowered his cup.
Hermione was startled when the wolf suddenly spoke using his voice. Her eyes widened. Her heart skipped, feeling dread. Her hand shook with a certain familiarity she could never place, not knowing the reason that she did not realize she had let her guard down.
"Do I have to?" It seems that even in his child state within his mind, Harry knew of his fate. Draco gave him a sad smile as if not wanting for this small child in front of him to face the real world where he truly is. Something within Draco awakened. He wanted to protect Harry whose small shoulders held the fate of their world.
Hermione stared at the Grimoire in her hands. She could feel a twinge of magic in it, making the book felt like it is alive. She shook her head before promptly turning around to check on her companions. They all looked like they had seen something that caused a turmoil in their minds. Even the usually bubbly Ginny now remained quiet while Luna seemed to be pondering about something. Marius—well, he looked like someone just defined his existence and his face was too pale, too gaunt.
The female looked confused at her but then a realization seemed to come to her. “Ah, the Chamber took my form, didn’t it? Though, how? You haven’t even seen what Narcissa looked like just by seeing your memories.”
“Though you will still tutor me right?”, he said with such an angelic smile and when Neville saw this he almost melted into a puddle, his heart was pounding too much that he was afraid Blaise might realize something.
However, this forest was not like what it used to be. It was dark, too dark. He could barely see his surroundings as he ran. Why was he running? Why was he here? Even he did not know the answer to those. Even so, he felt like he knew where he was headed. Why did he have to relieve this moment of his life?
Harry was about to retort once again but before he could snap back a retort, the vampire was already out of the room. He wanted to see Draco and be by his side just a bit longer. He knew, though, that they have pressing matters to attend to, especially if they want to have Draco transferred to Gryffindor Lands before dinner started. They had to clear up their plans and assure that only wolves knew of this plan. He would have to talk this out to Hermione although their suspicion about a spy would probably have Hermione once again on the edge. But for all of this to be enacted, they would have to do this plan perfectly and without any mistakes as possible. Hogwarts would lose if Bellatrix could truly step into this castle despite the Blood Ward.
He was about to take the first step when he heard his name being called. He looked back to see a male. He knew his is a Slytherin due to the crest on his robes. He raised his eyebrow in question.
“With him in our side I can use him to tap into Narcissa’s powers and use it to our advantage, and with it I can aid Young Potter in his fate”, Harry looked away, his thoughts were flying into a spiral, another person like him bound to his fate, he felt sympathetic.
A growl erupted from Orion as he scrunched up his nose. He crossed his hands and scoffed. "Ha! As if that wolf could ever make me work for him. My loyalty lies somewhere else. Thank you very much."
That woke Marius up enough to let him send the silly werewolf a glare. “You—
“Tell me all you know”, Harry never expected to be at the end of the interrogation when facing Hermione, but knowing that this creature might still be prowling about killing people like Penny Elmore, he just has to trust his friend on this one.
The door then opened to reveal Hermione carrying some of the ingredients that they needed for the potion. Following her was a mass of black unruly hair—Harry—and this brought a small smile to Marius’ lips. He stood up to offer help to Hermione. He took some of the jars from her and began to place them on the coffee table. Hermione huffed as she began to open up the Grimoire, showing her the potion that she wanted to brew.
The other werewolves, having an inkling to what he was feeling, decided that their esteemed leader needs to figure this out on his own as they all shook their heads at his obliviousness. They even noticed that Harry did not budge at all when a half of the ever crazy Weasley twins made his way over to him. It seemed like Fred Weasley, along with the whole Gryffindor House, had noticed their Alpha’s infatuation on the human.
Harry even dared himself to card his fingers through Marius messy blond locks, making the other hummed in appreciation and sleepiness. Marius had never felt this comfortable in a long time. His breathing was coming even and when he was about to close his eyes, Harry’s warmth disappeared. He was then faced with Harry and another one of his fond smiles.
Hermione watched the human who seemed happy. His eyes had that glints in the light and Hermione now understood why the vampires around him were all very closely attached to him. The way that he could tackle any kind of obstacles in his way, not choosing any of the given choices but instead making his own answer to the problem—Hermione found that she respected the human.
Harry released a sigh he was holding as he caressed Draco’s hair so tenderly. “We all have pasts that we wish to forget, but you living with what you have done, never forgetting and until now repenting, is something not anyone can just do.”
Marius nodded confidently. The three unmarked vampires looked at each other as if sharing a silent agreement.
"I'm glad you’re safe."
“Orion”, Orion’s eyes snapped dangerously to the human and Marius merely gave him a sheepish smile—he felt confused, everyone in Hogwarts know he was not to be messed with—he was feared and that was his best protection for himself.
“Ugh come along, we’re wasting time here”, Blaise tugged on the arm of Neville without realizing how Neville suppressed his shiver from showing. Theo noticed how Neville looked like he was having an internal battle, he pitied him and so he sighed and placed his hand on Blaise’s shoulder.
“Do you reckon he knew about those killings?”, Ron voiced out and Harry looked up at him defending Regulus.
"I am gonna be a spy for the werewolves' side."
Pansy looked down, she was then biting her bottom lip. Theo inclined his head to watch what was happening.
“Oh, well Headmaster, my Gammy was adamant that I enter this school, but since she was already sick when I was 11 and I decided to stay to take care of her. I read any book that I could ever come across to and Gammy’s knowledge is very extensive.”, the fondness seeping out of him when talking about the late Mrs. Clarke was probably being shown in his features as he saw the Headmaster smile at him. He almost feel guilty for fooling the Headmaster but he trust his Mother’s words too much.
When Harry released him, Harry wiped away the remnant tears on his eyes with his thumb as he cradled Draco’s face in his hands. Draco looked up at those emerald eyes that looked at him with so much adoration that he could not help to start telling him of his plan to leave Hogwarts.
thank you so much for the read! see you guys on the next chapter!XD
Then, a sudden thought struck him that brought him to his knees. It made his heart drop in a way he could not understand.
After a few more teasing to poor Orion, they left the ‘Marius and Harry’ matter alone.
“I apologize it’s just that you don’t look like your age”, the woman laughed and handed them their cup of tea.
“Thanks”, then he held it up to see how sharp it is then holding out his right hand he made a clean cut from it. Draco then placed his palm to the stone gate and as if on cue the stone walls parted to allow him passage inside. Without saying anything he entered the vault that was suddenly lit up as he entered, its fires flickering as if awakened from its long slumber.
Hermione and Marius were the first ones to enter the Hufflepuff Dorm, seeing a grumbling, irritated Ron Weasley and a smug looking Blaise sitting on opposite couches.
Severus nodded. They called both children to follow them and the twins held hands as if never wanting to ever let go again. They hid under a disillusionment charm as they headed into the room that they both have no idea what lay in. The guards did not mind them much as they passed.
“Ow!” she said as she rubbed her bottom. She then looked up unknowingly with a glare, only to see Luna Lovegood began to ease away from her. Hermione realized she must have scared her due so she took a deep breath and held in her anger. She then offered her hand for the blonde girl to take. Lovegood merely looked at her offered hand then her brown eyes as if uncertain.
“Well Dad is asking all older pack members to go to the Room of Requirement tomorrow after our classes”, then Ron grumbled and Hermione rolled her eyes.
. I and that brat there are not mates.”
Orion’s eyes widened and he gritted his teeth. “He wouldn’t do that, he doesn’t have the heart to.”
James turned to him. "Choose only a few of the elites. The others will remain here for the time being."
to obtain her wand.
Flint looked pale, along with some of the Vampires who tried to attack Marius. They all turned their eyes away and just continued eating their meal in silent.
He held onto that thought as he walked briskly to a hall he had never been into. He only realized it when he stopped in front of a bare brick wall. He was about to walk away when he heard a click from behind him. He looked around to see if anyone was with him, but only to find the place abandoned. He stared at the brick wall once again when suddenly a huge door slowly materialized. He watched as the crest of the Malfoy family sculpted on the huge doors.
Hermione’s face twisted in pain as she thought of the pain Narcissa had endured in making that decision. She didn’t answer because she could not believe that the Narcissa she saw in the memory would be capable of doing that.
Marius was facing Lestrange, his hair mussed up and unkempt. The Vampire beside Marius was currently fixing his tie, their distance too close for Harry’s comfort. He tightened his grip on whatever he was holding, not caring what happened to it. He was controlling his expression to not make it obvious that he was staring at them.
“A wise choice.” Dumbledore agreed since no one would ever be able to think that she would be the center of the barrier. “I will inform her soon then, but I would not tell her of your existence.”
“For him to know what part he has to play in this war, he has to learn about his father as well, Narcissa.” His tears continued to fall down. “Fate truly is a cruel thing, I now fully understand what you meant, Sybill.” He blinked as he remembered his old friend the seer Sybill Trelawney's last words to him.
“No?” Harry looked confused. “Sirius…isn’t your ability a rather rare gift? I mean…it’s not something farmers tend to learn, is it?”
It was easier said than done, but those eyes had caught Draco, so he would simply have to wait and see. He nodded, then moved to offer his arm to Harriet. “So…What do you think of Slytherin, Princess Harriet?” he asked.
She tried to close the door, but he caught it, keeping her from shutting it all the way. “No. I need to talk to him
There was no one to complain to. The elf refused to answer questions. It merely brought him food and cleaned the house before vanishing off to wherever it went at night. Soon Draco began to think the house-elf would be better than nothing.
Draco'd debated that question with himself after realizing Potter might ask something along those lines, he'd already decided on an answer. "I'll leave it up to you. If you decide this or one of my other stories is worth more… I'll take them. If not, so long as I get my question, I'll keep telling them."
For some reason, Harry seemed to go almost calm. "I’m afraid I can’t do that, ma’am. Need to get him to his family."
It happened in a flash. He was so busy looking for that shock of red hair that he wasn’t watching where he was going, and crashed headlong into someone, then toppled backwards into a mud puddle. Horrified, he jumped up, trying desperately to clean his clothes, despite the fact that they were beyond repair, then looked up to growl at the man who’d bumped into him—only to find Potter staring at him, horror-struck.
Unfortunately, just as Draco was getting comfortable, his mother returned—followed by a small group of girls. Draco couldn’t help but laugh—or at least, as good as he could in this form—at the look on their faces. They looked as though they thought he was going to eat them, rather than that
After Harry left, Draco curled up on his bunk, lost in thought until he fell into a doze.
Draco laughed. “Exactly, Po—Harry.” He flushed, still not used to using the name, but glad for the chance to be so familiar. Once he’d caught his breath, he looked up at him. “So…?”
“That’s what I said. You’re saying you didn’t…” Potter's honest shock was surprising. If he hadn't done this, then why…?
Draco grinned. “I guess so.” He kissed Harry again. That bit was not going to get old any time soon. Each kiss seemed more addictive than the last. Finally, he pulled back to look at Harry again. “So…now what?”
The larger of the two narrowed his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest. "He's a
“I don't—!”
Queen Narcissa shook her head, her expression saying what she obviously felt she could not. “Well, I suppose you will just have to learn in your own time, won’t you?” And then, before Harry could respond, she turned. “I suppose I’ll have to see if Lucius has managed to find more candidates.” Then she crossed the garden, and disappeared through the door leading into the palace.
“You mean…but…you hate me.”
Draco had been playing chess with Pansy at the time, trying to convince her of Blaise’s good qualities.
Draco shifted to see him better, and to speak, but it felt like he was moving through treacle. "Wha…?"
The night Draco set as his deadline, he set out a potion next to his bed before dropping off to sleep. It was only a headache potion, but if taken in high enough quantity, it could cause death. He woke to a footstep outside his door, but feigned unconsciousness, waiting to see if his host would come in, or stay outside. He heard a whispered spell, and saw the room grow faintly brighter as his host entered.
The next attack came when they landed to get their bearings because Harry’d gotten turned around. Fenrir attacked, and they’d jumped back onto the broom, but not before both of them had gotten scored by the talons he had for finger-nails.
Padfoot raised an eyebrow. “You think…he’s like me?”
Days passed a little faster after that. Things began to settle into a rhythm, and Draco found himself looking forward to Potter's visits.
Potter pulled him back, gentle but firm. “You did, Draco. Please…stop fighting this? Let me at least try?”
Draco frowned. "What doesn't?"
Shacklebolt smiled. "Good luck, Mister Malfoy. You are free to go."
Unable to speak, Draco nodded, the fear back once more then tried to relax as Harry began to touch him. The first touches made his skin prickle, and then, there was pressure, and Harry was urging him to relax, to breathe, but how could he? The feeling was simply far too intense, and each time the feeling lessened, there was soon more.
Before Blaise could answer, Queen Narcissa had appeared as well. “Yes, Blaise. Who is this girl you have brought to tempt my son?” The words put Draco on edge, but he did his best to keep calm, glancing towards the girl Blaise had brought him to distract himself.
He nodded. "We'll give it a couple of days, then send out a new invitation." He'd have smirked, if not for the butterflies in his stomach. "Thanks, Pans." Draco headed off to his dorm. Time for some serious thinking.
"What is that supposed to mean, Malfoy?"
“Kissing. Yes.” Draco looked away, his nerves getting the better of him after a moment. He got to his feet again and moved to the window. “You don’t have to like it. It was just a dream. Apparently.” So why did he feel worse now than before he’d come here?
“Yes, well…I have to admit, the bed was very soft. And yet…” Harriet blushed again. “Something kept…poking me.”
Blaise shot him a secretive smile. “Trust me.”
“That’s what I keep telling them, but…” Draco sighed then looked down. “They do have a point. It’s very dangerous if I end up with some odd connection to someone, and…”
“Aside from the kissing?”
“Yeah?” he said. “Then what?”
Waiting.
Draco caught his arm before he could move. “No. I’m sorry. She just…rubbed me the wrong way, that’s all. I’m glad you’re at least able to learn about your family.”
“You didn’t.” Lucius’s attention was focused on him fully now. “You wouldn’t be so stupid as to jeopardize everything that way.”
Draco looked back over his shoulder, and saw the man still standing there, glowering at him. Turning back to Harry, he made a face. “He…doesn’t seem to like me much.”
He hurried to a nearby fountain, glancing into the water, and recoiled at what he saw—he was a dragon!
, damn it!
Potter glared at him once more. "I told you to shut your mouth, Malfoy. It so happens I have other things to concern myself with than you. Now be quiet, or I'll make sure you stay that way regardless."
“Of course, Draco,” Potter said, far too pleasantly. He settled in under the covers, and fell easily into sleep. Draco watched him with a scowl before rolling on his side and away from him so he wouldn’t have to see him.
“Padfoot…” Moony warned him.
"I assure you," the woman said, "they would love to finally meet you."
With a beaming smile, Blaise bowed to his prince. “Then I should set out immediately, if I am to marry her any time soon,” he said with a smile.
“Potter.” Draco doesn't look much better. He actually looks as though he has not even seen sun since that day. He is pale, and if we look close, we can see there are bags under his eyes, highlighted by dark smudges. “Happy day. I’ll just go find myself a seat, shall I?”
"Bird or not…" Bella said, cutting across their argument, "I will simply have to ensure that he doesn’t fly off with you, dear nephew. I wouldn’t want you being abducted," she added with an evil smirk that made it difficult for Draco not to shudder.
Draco hadn’t, but he nodded. “I’m collecting wood for the palace. For the wedding feast,” he said.
“Oh, right!” She stuck out her hand to be shaken as though she were a man. “Tonks. At your service, sire. Or…is it majesty?”
So, when Harry appears a few days later on the grounds of Malfoy Manor, which is Draco’s ancestral estate, it should surprise none of us.
Draco turned to look at Potter, who looked charmingly sleep-rumpled in a way he really didn’t want to consider. “What are you doing in
But apparently Harry could. “Good. Does that mean I can take this off, now, Draco?” he asked in his normal voice, pulling off his wig.
effect on how you feel here?”
“Right. Narcissa’d love me even more if you brought her son a giant wild beast.”
Startled, Draco looked up at his father. “Father…?”
“But…but…” Draco watched as Potter pulled the wagon to the door and began to unpack the mattresses and comforters, then pulled the wagon to the side yard. Sighing, Draco trudged into the house, barely able to pick up his feet any longer, then collapsed on the nearby bed, and was asleep in a flash.
Potter flushed again. “I’ll have Ron show you up to your room. And send someone to draw you up a bath. And retrieve your mattress.”
Apparently, it was the wrong thing for him to have done. The larger boy, deciding Draco was too much of a threat, seized on his companion to bully once more, and pushed him. Hard. The smaller boy fell to the ground, his glasses falling from his face and sliding across the pavement.
. Both mum and dad say so. Freaks aren't allowed on the beach."
But Harry wasn’t alone. There was a rather raggedy man standing in the door of the stables talking softly to Harry, and Harry was shaking his head.
And the clothes? That was true hell. Potter had pointed to the soap, a goopy syrup to pour onto the clothes after he’d gotten them wet, but when they were in the tub, he couldn’t tell if anything was coming out, and when he tried to scrub them, he couldn’t find a discernable difference either before or after.
Draco stood and dressed in one of his clean outfits, untouched from the horror that had started the moment he’d left Slytherin. He didn’t use his best—he’d save that for the rescue he’d hoped would come, even in his darkest moments. Now it had, but he found he simply needed to keep going as he had, and everything would be perfect.
It wasn't okay, but it would have to do.
Harry's cheeks darkened. "Not what I expected, but no." He looked at Draco for a long time, both of them silent. "Did you want to ask a question?"
It was. Potter gave him instructions, most of which went entirely over his head, then left for the day, taking the cart with him. Draco sighed and decided to start with the dishes and the sweeping. Hopefully those would be easy enough, at least.
Despite the fact that Draco was used to being alone, and, in fact, had
"Yes, Severus. I'm sure we all know what you think. But first we need their explanations before we decide further." She turned to Harry. "You wanted to say something, Mister Potter?"
“What is it, Draco?” Harry asked softly, his hands stopping their roaming to stroke his back calmingly.
Draco grinned. “Still, you never know. I am Crown Prince. I do still have to outdo you…” His grin faded quickly, though. “I just wish…”
But Draco seems unaware of anything more than his own annoyance, and scowls at him. “I suppose.”
She turned to Draco, a calculating look on her face. "You’ve been a bad boy, Draco. Perhaps your auntie should punish you?"
Draco frowned. "Like what? Stand on our heads?"
And why is it that this sight, of all things—his rival and his rival’s fiancée—makes Draco so upset? Why would he care what they do? But he does.
Draco's discomfort at telling Harry his dreams grows.
“Padfoot” saw this and moved towards Harry, his eyes widening in alarm. “Harry!”
“I…I’m not sure. I remember several, though.”
Harry and Weasley's sister never got back together after the final battle the way everyone, including Weasley and his sister, expected. Instead, Potter seemed more focused on his studies than Draco recalled from before the war. He watched him the first few months of school, but aside from Granger, who was obviously not interested in anything but her studies this year, he didn't seem to show  any interest in any girl. Or any boy, really.
Potter obviously sensed the change in him, as his eyes narrowed. “Yes. You’ll need to get up there soon. They’re expecting you.”
“What about breakfast?”
The boys slowly grow closer, and Draco tells another story.
Draco supposed it was true. "I guess that makes sense. It seems silly not knowing for sure who you are."
Draco blinked up at him, not having expected that. "Now?"
“You’re right,” Harry says softly.
“He saved my life. Twice. And saved all three of us from Azkaban, father. If not, we’d have lost everything! What was I supposed to do?”
The King watched him for a moment before nodding. “Very well. But if I should lose my son, Dumbledore…”
Draco turned to Harry. He wouldn't volunteer for that as well, was he? But Harry turned to the stands, and Draco followed his gaze. His eyes widened as an eerily familiar woman stood and made her way down to the floor where they stood. But she was dead and even if he'd somehow been wrong, why would anyone allow her to be here, let alone free?
Draco glanced between Potter and his father, then moved closer to Potter again. “Will there be more lessons?” he asked, and suddenly he wasn’t sure what he wanted the answer to be.
* * *
Turning back, Draco looked at Harry for a moment. “And what do you think, Potter?”
“You want to live in my house, near me? You actually want to live with a family of Death Eaters?”
All three men glanced at Draco at the noise. “Are you okay, Draco?” Harry asked, looking concerned.
And over there? In the corner with the red-headed boy and his girlfriend with the fall of thick curly hair? That is Harry. He is beginning to realize that his friend Ron’s sister is simply no longer what he wants. Draco is.
Draco swallowed. “Uh…”
Lucius’s rage is barely restrained now, but Harry seems not to care. “He is my son, not a sack of meat, Potter! I won’t let you…use him.”
“If he doesn’t take him back home…”
“Oh, all right. Good seeing you again, Potter,” Blaise said with a wave.
Eyes narrowing, Draco felt his anger pulling at what his father had told him was his magic. "Take it back
Draco sighed, then nodded. "Yeah, he probably would." Probably had at some point or other, if Draco were completely honest with himself. "But if you use it against him—"
“And…what was that?”
“Well…yeah. I mean…that’s what I’ve been told,” Harry said, looking a bit nervous himself now.
“Then stand still, Draco. The poor girl is simply trying to do her job.” Narcissa stepped forward and fiddled with the collar of his robes. “At least it’s a flattering color.”
“As you aren’t you when you are Padfoot, Sirius?” Dumbledore asked him.
“You can. But he won’t get it for a month, I’m afraid. The mail doesn’t go out until next week, and it will take several weeks before it reaches Slytherin, because it has several stops to make before it even reaches Gryffindor’s borders.”
Draco looked up at him, suddenly not sure what to ask. He stayed quiet for a bit before finally letting the words escape. "My father—" He could see the frown growing on Harry's face, but hurried to ask anyway, hoping Harry would answer. "Have they sentenced him yet? You don't need to tell me what, or even when. Just…have they?"
“Well, you look wonderful,” Draco said, glad it was dark there in the gardens, so that the blush on his face wouldn’t be easily noticed by his friend. “And I’m glad you’re here. I didn’t even get to talk to you today when I came down to the stables.”
Draco rolled his eyes. "Please, you know that's not why."
After the disaster of the Gryffindor/Slytherin Quidditch match, where they lost 420 to 10, Draco knew they needed to take matters into their own hands. There was no way they'd be able to manage another six months of life like this.
“No. Not until we talk, Draco.”
"Me?" Harry looked stunned, making Draco smile wider.
“Seven.”
“Please, Potter?”
"Why me?"
"I do. But I can't. I'm sorry." And then Potter hurried down the corridor to the next cell before Draco could try anything more.
to him, at least. Even just that he wanted to talk to him elsewhere. But not this…not ignoring him all evening. This was ridiculous! Potter had said he would explain! Throwing his napkin on the table, he got up and stormed after him. “Potter!”
When Harry returned the next morning, he was more subdued. He wasn't alone, either. The provisional Minister was with him.
Then she spoke. "Minister, he is my nephew. I would be willing to let him come and stay until such time as the court believes he finishes his sentence."
“Even if you still hate me after.”
Draco sighed. "Fine. Right." He was silent for a moment, then moved to pick up the tray and hand it to Potter. "Here. And Potter?"
“We will return, sire,” Potter said with a gracious smile.
"We shall see," Robards said, but he was cut off by Shacklebolt.
“It’s white and gold, mother. How can one go wrong with that? It’s practically not a color at all.”
Draco smiled. “Oh, that one’s of particular interest to me, of course. Given my predilection. But then, I suppose the same is true for you, isn’t it? It’s almost like we’re them, reincarnated. To heal the rift.” Okay, perhaps it was a bit over the top, but there had never been anyone else who he could share his speculation with about the two kings, and now, here was Harry, who obviously believed the same of them. And who was here to marry him.
Draco nodded. Part of him was glad that Harry would promise to visit again, but another part of him wanted Harry to not leave at all. Still, better that than have the witch catch him here. "Soon," he said to hide his turmoil. "I look forward to it."
When the sun reached the top of the trees, Draco began to shake. He knew what would happen if Fenrir arrived and smelled Harry here once more. And if Harry were
“I don’t want to hurt you, Draco. Not ever. I promise.” He pulled up Draco’s chin. “Just…give me a chance?”
Once Harry had mounted, the two set off down the main street of the town, and out into the fields. The two of them headed automatically for one of their favorite pastures, then dismounted and let the horses graze for a bit. Draco moved to a large stone the two of them had spent many happy hours “conquering” as boys, and settled upon it.
“Apparently so.” Draco took Harry’s hand. “And even more? I’ve Chosen. Whatever you do? Harry’s right. People
"I was going to say if I can't, then you get to ask another question. All right?"
"I assure you, sir, I don't—"
The King and Queen attempt to break the spell on their son.
So much so his benefactor stayed longer than usual. Draco sent him into the living room to mix them drinks so they could continue their debate while he cleaned up in the kitchen.
to be groped by him. Seemed almost offended when I went off to dance with my next partner.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Believe me, he won’t be the one I choose, even if mother and father force the issue.”
Draco felt his stomach protest. He’d never gone more than twelve hours without food, and that only when he had not felt like eating, not because he had not been allowed. “But I’m starving!”
“I’m afraid so. Even if I were the sort, the girls mother continues to find…” Draco sighed. “I don’t know what to do, Blaise. I can’t tell her why. She’d go apoplectic. And I can’t…function with a girl.” Just the thought had him feeling a bit ill.
“Then I guess I’ll have to give you inspiration, won’t I?” Harry asked with a wink, leaning down to kiss Draco once more.
Sirius snorted. “Yeah, Narcissa told us about that. Can’t blame the poor kid.”
Potter snorted. "No. Lifetime of dealing with goading. You're nowhere near as good as my cousin Dudley was."
When Draco was finished, he was shocked Potter hadn't stopped him long ago. The silence stretched out between them for several minutes before Potter finally spoke.
"Your magic dumped him in the water. Because you were protecting
The oldest of the remaining wizards stepped forward then. “Stop this, Tom. There is no need—”
"What? You don't think people in the Wizarding World can be gay?"
It was on the tip of Draco’s tongue to say it was too late to worry about that, but he repressed it, smiling instead and kissing Harry again. After all, Harry wanted this. That was a big improvement all on its own, wasn’t it? He shifted to roll them over on the couch, settling on top of Harry. “So let me lead the way, then?”
He packed himself a light lunch, then went outside and got out the cart, which he’d been hoping to never see again. Sighing, he pulled it down the road leading from the palace and into the woods. He wasn’t sure how to get larger pieces, but the smaller sticks and branches seemed easy enough, and by the time his stomach had begun to growl, he had a good stack in his cart. All he could do was hope what he was finding was enough.
Afterwards, time dragged. The books were no distraction, and there seemed to be no solace. It grew hard to function, and it took Draco longer and longer to get himself out of bed. Eventually, he didn't bother, except for the occasional trip to the bathroom, or when he could no longer stand the hunger. Otherwise, he stayed curled up there, unmoving when he heard the house-elf calling his name, begging him to get out of bed to come and eat. Why should he? What did it really matter?
Draco chuckled. "Please. When are you not about saving people? How many times did you help me this past year? And you had no reason to. I deserved the fate I'd made myself."
Draco wasn’t sure he liked that idea. But Harry seemed to think it was a good idea. “You need to get back, Draco. At least I’ll be able to explain a bit, right?”
“Cook?” Draco twitched, his first reaction horror at the idea, his second, the memory that Potter was hiding all this from his king. “In the palace, you say?”
"Actually, sir, someone is here to ensure that."
Turning back to him, Draco sighed. “The worst two.”
“With a wizard in your midst! How do you know he didn’t trick you into it?” his mother asked, horrified.
Of course, the moment he saw the potion, he shook Draco awake.
“You should have paid him off! Something! Anything other than
The use of his surname felt like a slap. Did Harry not remember? "Potter… did you ever spend time at the beach as a boy?"
Harry nods slowly, his shoulders slumping. If only we could give him a hug. “All debts settled.” Draco doesn’t seem to notice his dejection. He’s too pleased that he has been given permission to leave.
“You…we…wow…” His hand came up to stroke Draco’s cheek again, and he scooted closer. “You chose me over your father?”
The other turned. “What is it, Mo—“ He caught sight of Draco, and his sword came out. “Fuck! Harry…get behind us!”
Draco blinked at him, then nodded, dropping forward a bit so that Harry could climb on and settle between his shoulder blades.
Harry rolled his eyes then stretched out on top of him. “I have better plans.” And then, before Draco could protest, Harry kissed him again, drawing a moan from them both. Perhaps now Harry actually agreed it was finally time to get on with things?
“Right…never mind that it’s
“Dreams. You think…what? That I hexed you to dream nasty things?”
Weasley raised an eyebrow, then shook his head. “Look, why don’t you let me take that, and you can go home. You look ready to topple.”
“And your parents?”
Harriet shifted, then looked up to meet the queen’s eyes and replied in a soft, sweet voice she’d obviously been practicing on the road with Blaise. “It is possibly my best chance for marriage, Highness. Any other marriage would probably see me marrying a much less…worthy candidate.”
They both spoke at the same time.
Draco glared at him. "Why don't you try it and find out?" Rather than give him a chance to respond, Draco tried to rise again, much slower than before, and was grateful when he was able to stand, even if his legs felt slightly wobbly.
After a moment, Draco shook his head. They didn’t know, after all. They’d think he was just a beast as Harry and his friends had.
The Prince didn’t run from the room, but it was a near thing, and by the time he’d gotten halfway to his rooms, he’d broken into a bit of a jog anyway. Upon reaching his room, he opened the door quickly, then looked around, hoping to see the familiar mop of black hair and the bright green eyes he loved so well, but sagged when Harry was nowhere to be seen.
Once inside, he repeated his spell from the day before, this time managing a quite passable beef stew, and cut up some bread and cheese to go with it, serving it up just as he heard the cart outside. He was about to go out and ask Weasley if he wanted some food, when he heard voices.
He lay in bed at night and imagined
Narcissa was waiting for them, seated upon her throne, her closest advisor, Minister Snape, at her shoulder. He shot a look at Harriet, then whispered to the queen, and her eyes narrowed.
Draco wasn't about to say he'd already guessed, so instead he nodded. "Of course. Can I ask why you won't stay here with me? Or are we all being kept this way?" After all, maybe this was part of the punishment.
Draco sighed. “Fine. I can have the elves prepare you a room in the guest wing, I suppose. Shouldn’t take too lo—”
Shacklebolt looked down at his notes once more, ignoring Robards, who grew redder as he continued to ignore him. "This says several instances of the Cruciatus curse were found when Priori Incantatum was performed on your wand. Are you aware of that?"
Nodding, Lucius pulled one out, and Draco turned away. “Put it over my eyes.”
“Mmm…” Harry nodded, then dug into his food, completely oblivious to the glares the queen mother was sending their way now.
“Potter? What are you…” Even as he began to ask, a thought came to him, but it couldn’t be true, could it? “Weasley said the king would be showing soon… You can’t…no…”
“So…you wouldn’t then?” Harry sounded sad.
“So…why did you come here?”
"I don't know." He frowned, then stepped back. "I need to finish my rounds. I'll let you know later, okay?"
Draco thought of the new tasks he had been given. The organizing projects here at the house meant nothing, but the potions… The person appeared to know his connection to Snape. Also his visitor had looked to be about his age. If he crossed off all the rest, that would reduce his list quite a bit. If he crossed off the Weasleys—they'd never have been able to afford a place like this—that left only one person. Harry Potter.
He watched the other boy tense at the question, but he nodded. "Yeah. I guess it's now or never, right?"
“No.” Harry paused, examining Draco’s face for a moment before speaking. “I didn’t realize anyone else knew about Salazar and Godric.”
Draco huffed. “Wrong. His father did. Grandfather Abraxas was the one who implemented the Muggle restrictions. To keep them from hurting themselves by trying to use magical objects.” He turned to his mother. “I don’t think so, mother.”
“I doubt that very much, Padfoot. He’s not young enough to have imprinted on him. Likely he’s just friendly, and was enjoying having Harry pay attention to him. Stop overreacting.”
For a long moment, it seemed as though even Harry didn’t know. Then he let his hand slide up Draco’s spine, sending a thrill through him, his fingers settling at the base of Draco’s skull, and pulled him forward. Draco gasped as their lips met, and Harry pressed his tongue between the parted lips.
"The potions, Draco! Hurry!"
“You said you wanted to make me happy. I…” They’d both hurt each other so much over the years, but Draco had never considered what it would feel like to be the one to refuse Potter. They weren’t on an even slate. He’d done worse than Potter had on the Hogwarts Express. Apologies weren’t something he was accustomed to making, but he knew he’d have to try. “I…didn’t mean it. I was confused.”
Draco led the way up into the treehouse, and began to show Harry everything he'd already discovered—the telescope you could use to watch the beach and the sea, and the trap door up to the turret where they could practically see the end of the world, and the little cubby hole with books to read.
Draco smirked. That only proved they didn't deserve Harry, he decided. If they couldn't give Harry this, Draco would. He'd show him he did have magic. Because Draco was certain he did. He wasn't sure why. He somehow knew he was right. "Isn't it nice? It's not as nice as the last beach house we had in the Canary Islands, but I like it. The one in the Canaries didn't have that." He pointed to the treehouse, grinning as Harry stared up at it.
Draco shook his head quickly. "No. It’s late. I wouldn’t want to wake them. I can meet them soon enough…"
Draco Malfoy had had two bad years in a row, and even though the war was finally over, this year wasn't turning out be much better. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Potter.”
“I suppose…you never really stopped hoping I’d change my mind. But then…why the kissing?”
Certainly, none of Harry's friends understand his need to reform Draco. He may well need your empathy, as they seem to have none in this regard. Not only that, but Draco continues to make Harry's life difficult. When Harry tries to take Draco out to get groceries, he complains the entire time. Especially because they go to a Muggle grocer rather than sending the house-elf to a magical one.
The young man they’d been calling Harry ignored both of them and stepped toward Draco. “You don’t look so scary,” he told Draco with a soft smile.
“Your...” Draco huffed, hating to be so wrong-footed by such an odd person. “And just
“God, yes.” Now, before his father could take it from him. “But…”
"What? What's wise?" he asked, standing.
"But—"
“Shaken? Why? What happens?”
"You shouldn't call me that." Despite himself, Draco's anger faded and grew into confusion with a touch of hope. "We're not friends."
“God knows why he wants a spoiled thing like you when he could have anyone, but he does.”
Draco smiled. “Of course.”
She blinked for a moment. “And that would be?” she finally asked.
The next few hours were filled with making the Prince comfortable. He was pleased that Harry chose to stay with him. Even though they’d never met before, Draco felt rather attached to him. After all, Harry had been the only one to actually understand what had happened. Now if only he could get him to convince his parents to call off this horrific kissing contest…
Harry pushed him forward. "Go on," he whispered, smiling softly.
Harry nodded. “There’s one more, right?”
“And who would I want to talk to at a party
Granger peered out at him, but she said nothing at first, just looked at him. There was whispering behind her, and she glanced at whoever was there with her—Weasley? Potter? After a moment, she opened the door wider to glare at him. “Malfoy? What do you want?”
“All right, then.” Yes, this year definitely was shaping up to be at least as difficult as the previous two.
"And you wanted me stay. With you." His confusion seemed to grow as he spoke.
"No," Harry said, looking regretful. "I realize I shouldn't take credit for the parties, but I knew McGonagall would be more impressed if we were working together. And, well, I knew it was you."
Harriet nodded, taking his arm, then let him lead the way down the hall, Blaise and Pansy following them a few steps behind.
“Yep. Porridge.” He held up a bowl, then ladled a large serving in and handed it to Draco, who wrinkled his nose at the grey, lumpy mess.
“He is still their son, Harry. I mean, granted, he’s probably pretty grateful right now because you helped him, but what about later?”
“You’re here.”
And then everything went bad.
They made their way up the road, both lost in their own thoughts. At the turn-off for the hut, Draco paused, not sure if he should go with Weasley up to the palace, or go home and prepare supper. After all, it was almost dinner-time, too.
“It is not a horrific idea,” the King agreed, eyeing his son’s new form. “But will they even consider it?”
Where the guest bed usually sat was a tower of mattresses. After a moment, a face peered out over the edge. “Draco?”
Harry looked at him for another minute, then nodded once, wincing again. "Fine. I'll ask Hermione to research it. That doesn't mean I believe you, Malfoy."
All three men turned to look up into the stands, but Draco didn't check. He knew who had spoken. Harry. He shot him a glare.
Draco scowled. "Not even about father? Please… I just want to know he's all right. And mother. I know you stood up for her before. Do you know…?"
The words were enough to pull Draco out of his daze. Shifting, he scowled and rolled his eyes. “Oh, dear god, Potter. Starting off that way hardly lends me confidence…”
He didn’t wake for several hours, and when he did, the cloth under his cheek, as soft as it was, didn’t feel like his pillow. And his legs were tangled around…something. And then there was that soft sound in his ear.
Lucius turned to him, raising an eyebrow. “You have a way of getting rid of him?”
"All right." Harry waved for him to mount the broom, and Draco did, clinging to him, four vials of…something in his hands. He only hoped whoever was helping Harry knew what he was doing…
"Well…my name’s Harry. It’s good to meet you."
“About my son? And what is it you would like to tell me about my son?” Lucius’s voice is cold and unimpressed, but if one listens carefully, one can detect a note of unease or concern beneath it.
Harry shook his head. "Well, it might not be anything. Let me check. May I…come back and visit?"
The two kissed again, and Draco knew his plan succeeded more than he could ever have dreamed.
And when the time came for me to choose, my path was only too clear. No one would help my father. So I had to help him myself. Show my true quality. I had knowledge even the Dark Lord did not, and through it, I would free my father, and we would rise to greatness once more.
Landing several yards from the road, then approached them slowly, hoping that the three would not fright at the first sight of him. The young man seemed to be the leader, though he was far younger than the other two. One of the older men walked with a slight limp, and the other ranged far ahead, not merely to scout ahead, but also because he seemed to be made of energy, as though he hadn’t been out in the fresh air in years.
It wasn't until I'd faced the Dark Lord himself I understood. There was nothing but hate in his snake-like eyes. Not for me, not for my father, not for our plight…  We were all just tools to him. And we would all die at his whim.
“I…I’d like…to try being…friends?”
“Well, yeah. I do stay out of that drawing room, but otherwise…I’m sure you’ve got memories here you’d rather forget…”
Draco flushed, thinking about them and how Potter might respond. “Are you sure you want me to?”
It was getting both harder and easier to sleep. Harder, because he didn’t
. He shook his head. But it did give him an idea.
“Worst?”
Then came Hogwarts, and with it, the realization of Harry Potter, and of what Muggles and Muggleborn were truly like. Somewhere, in the back of my head, I could see Muggles and Muggleborn were different, but my annoyance at Harry Potter and his friends, particularly the know-it-all witch who seemed to want us all to think her better than all of us, kept me from acknowledging what I could see plainly for myself.
“To buy things to freshen up the place and to eat?” Draco asked hopefully.
All in all, it was nice to have someone to talk to. Even if it wasn't someone he'd spent much time with before.
Draco felt his face heat, then sank back down to the couch, head down. “We do all sorts of things,” he muttered.
“God, no. Your mother insisted. Said I would have to be comfortable for my first night here. Particularly if I was to become her daughter-in-law.” He made a face at that. “Hold on. I’ll come down.”
Draco huffed at that, then turned back to Harry and nudged him with his head. If he was going to suffer through this torment, he at least wanted his new friend with him through the ordeal. Harry reached up to scratch at Draco’s head automatically, and Draco sighed happily. At least something about this was going well…
The party was such a success that they repeated it the next week, and the week after. The only break from the parties was the Winter holidays, when most of the school returned home to visit their families.
"I…no, that’s not what I meant. I mean, he
Before the relieved parents could react, however, one of the others stepped forward—Trelawney. She was a rather bumbling witch, but her prophesies had a tendency to come true, despite her predilection for drink.
Harry met his gaze, then nodded and smiled. “All right.”
The ball started in much the same way, with only a slight variation in number of hands to shake or kiss, and a few new leering or simpering faces.
“No, Sirius. Just talking to him. I think he needed a friend, really. He seems a bit upset by what his parents have planned.”
There was a surge of joy inside Draco, and he leaned down to kiss Harry, not even caring when the edges of Harry’s glasses pressed into his cheek as they kissed. Even as they kissed, his hands moved to push up Harry’s tee-shirt, his fingers marking out the lines of Harry’s ribs, then working down over his stomach.
Which meant he still hadn't confessed the night Professor Snape interrupted their party. Worse, Draco was the one he managed to catch.
The King nodded. “He has.”
"I'm locked in here, and bored. That's all, Potter. Okay? I'm not going to try to steal you from Weasley's sister, if that's what you're worried about."
“What? Impose forever? Make a fool of me? Do this to me?” The words were bitter, but even Draco could hear the longing in them.
The boy shook his head, looking down. "They died."
“Until your Grandfather decided he disagreed with her prospective husband and they dueled. I’m certain you know how that turned out?”
He doesn't seem to see the dejection on Harry's face. But we can. “Yeah. I thought this would work, but…you’re unhappy. I’m unhappy. It’s better if I just let you go home.”
After a moment, Potter pulled reluctantly away. There was a great deal of wariness on his face. “Draco?”
Shacklebolt nodded, then turned to Draco. "And did this happen, Mister Malfoy?"
Draco nodded this time. After all, the castle wasn’t too far for him.
"Wow. You wrote it all down?"
Draco nodded slowly, afraid to even glance at Harry, now that he was so close to getting his father’s permission for this. It was far too good to be true. “Of course, father.”
“I have no reason…”
Were all girls really this dense? “He asked me for your hand,” he told her with a slight smirk, waiting for what he was sure would be a fantastic explosion, no matter what form it took.
“Tom?” A common name. But Draco nodded all the same. He held out his hand. “It is good to meet you.”
They walked towards the front gate, Draco stopping in the shade of some bushes as Harry approached. He could tell that the guards were still on high alert from seeing him earlier. However, when Harry approached to talk to one of them, he was waved away. Draco noticed that there were many people on the road, waiting for…something. Why were they just waiting? Why weren’t they letting people in?
Then, of course, he began to berate himself over the fact that he was actually
this? “Father?”
Draco wasn't one to settle after one attempt at finding out something he wanted to know, and he wasn't about to start doing so now. He wrote a second letter, this one a trap intended to learn if his host was actually reading the notes. He doubted the man would let him see his face if he did come, but at least he'd know he could get to him if he wanted.
“I don’t think so, Draco,” Harry said, rising to his feet.
Draco nodded, unhappy he wasn't able to get more from him. But pushing wouldn't make him more likely to agree, so what else could he do?
“So long as he stays at least a month, I will consider our debt fulfilled.”
"What did you do to me, Malfoy?"
Draco nodded. It wasn’t even lying, if he really thought about it. But the idea that Harry would be his first, as he’d always dreamed…even better, that he might be allowed more… “Harry?”
Both men turned to Draco, and at the curious expression on his father’s face, he felt the bottom drop out of his world once more. “I see.” His father had known. And expected Draco to stay. Regardless.
“I’m not playing a game, Draco. I like being here. Is that so hard to understand?”
“How much more?” Potter asked softly.
Finally, Draco shook his head to clear it, then nodded. “All right. Just…let me talk to my parents before you show up, baggage in tow?”
Upon hearing the words, Draco nodded vigorously. Harry glanced up at him. “You’re…the Prince?” he asked, his eyes wide. “How…? I mean…no one ever said anything about you being a dragon before…”
If he thought about it, he supposed he should be, but he wasn't. "It's not that. I just… I wish… he'd been able to trust me. Save me. From myself."
This family that Harry had told her about…were they waiting at the palace? Draco desperately wanted to tell Harry to turn around. Yet…where would he go, if not to his true family? It stumped him. Now that he was free, who was he? Where was he to go?
Lucius scowled. “Then…I will…approve of your marriage.” The words sounded as though he’d had to struggle to get them out of his mouth at all.
“No. It’s not that. I…” He glances back at the room where he changed, then to Draco once more. “Could you…wait in the dressing room there? I…need to go talk to someone. But…then I’d like to talk to you. If…I can?”
Draco came fully awake at that. “Potter?” he asked cautiously.
“Yes, but…I mean…what happened in them?”
Shacklebolt entered the room with them, activating the recording and protection spells in the room before removing Draco's bonds. "Remember, I'll be right outside, Harry. If you need anything…"
Draco tried not to meet those green eyes he’d always thought Potter didn’t deserve, even at the very beginning. “I want to speak to you.”
It took him a bit to be certain of the house, but once he was, he walked up the steps confidently. He only hoped the circles under his eyes weren’t too obvious. He clacked the knocker against the door, harder than he might have otherwise, then waited for Potter to answer. He kept his breathing steady, though he did jump a little when the door opened.
Draco nodded.
Then Harry nipped at his lip, shifting to nibble down his neck, and Draco forgot all about his worries and fears, arching his neck and grinding harder against Harry as he moaned again. “Oh…yes. Like that…ah…” His fingers slid up to stroke over Harry’s chest, delighting in the groan that tore from him. “More?” he asked in a whisper.
While this was hardly unexpected, Draco became more cautious at the statement. “And that would be?”
“Please…I’ve always hated you.”
Potter turned, halfway up the stairs. “Did you need something, Draco?”
Harry likes to think of it as an improvement. But we are far less deluded, and can see quite plainly that it is the only improvement. We are not so blinded to the fact that the two have constant fights.
Draco glanced at him, then back to the two he knew were his parents. Their robes were quite luxurious from what he could see, and now he knew why Harry had brought him to the palace. He was the son of the king and queen.
“You never tried! Why should I have bothered?”
"And you knew of your father's affiliations with the man who referred to himself as Lord Voldemort before the events of May nineteen-ninety-five?"
It took time to put an impressive enough outfit together. He didn’t want Potter thinking he’d managed to affect him, after all. Even if he had. Once he’d showered and combed out his hair—shoulder length…looked like it was time to get it trimmed again—he pulled on his robes, then apparated to Grimmauld Place.
The Queen turned to look at her son, seeming rather crestfallen. “Hopefully the wizard will know what to do to help him,” she sighed.
Harry smiled wider. "Yes. I brought a broom that should hold us both. All you have to do is hold on to my waist. Can you do that?"
Narcissa’s face took on a calculating look. “He didn’t say why?”
“What? No!”
“Not that I’m aware of…”
Time dragged, and by the time his turn for a trial came, Draco was sure he would jump out of his skin before they could impose his sentence. He wanted this
“More?” Potter sounded truly horrified. “How many of these dreams have you had?”
“Oh, nothing. Just…it’s not fair that they’re doing this to you. You should be able to take your time. Find someone you want to be with.”
Draco nodded, not sure what to say.
Harry grinned at him. “Yes.”
"So…? Why does that matter, Malfoy?"
It was like a broken record. They’d already been at this for five minutes, and it still made Draco's head hurt as he tried to understand. “Why?” he finally asked, trying to free them both from the loop they seemed to be stuck in.
Snape watched him for a moment, then nodded. "Very well. You may go. But if I hear even a hint that another party will take place…"
The clerk hurried down from his place below the Minister, with papers for each of them to sign, and Draco had to fight a shaking hand to manage his signature, still not sure they would let him walk out of here without ever being sent to Azkaban.
The problem was Draco wasn’t really interested in marrying. Not any time soon. And the one person he could think of he might be interested in that way was of such a low rank, likely his parents would both die of heart attacks on the spot if he were to suggest it.
Every possible solution felt more hopeless than the last. Now he knew nothing would convince him to return.
“It’s…not the marriage that I object to, Harry. It’s that it couldn’t be who I wanted.”
"Please… there has to be someone. Anyone! I'm going mad."
Harry's eyes grew round at the sight of their rented house. "Wow… Aunt Petunia would be so jealous."
Both father and son looked at her, dubious. “If you say so, Narcissa. But if that boy so much as threatens…”
Draco opened his mouth to answer, but someone answered for him. "Not guilty."
After break, the amount of parties per week doubled. Unfortunately, the frequency caught the attention of the professors, who seemed determined to put a stop to them. The first time Filch and his cat caught them, all the partygoers managed to scatter and escape. The second time, they were't as lucky. A few sixth-years found themselves with detention for the rest of the month. But as they didn't know for certain who arranged the parties, and the time and place for each party was arranged the day before, there the professors couldn't easily stop them.
Draco sighed. “I’ll give you my wand. Not that I could use it on you, now. It still recognizes you as its owner.”
Potter—Harry—was a very good kisser. Draco was beginning to think being married to him might not be so bad after all.
“You’d do that?” Draco asked, his heart leaping.
Ron didn’t come in with Potter, nor did Potter ask how Draco’s day had gone. Draco might have found that suspicious before, but now he was certain he knew what it meant. Potter was nervous. Or didn’t want him to know the truth. It really was a dead giveaway.
Draco’s heart sank at that. He wasn’t sure if he should be pleased or scared of what might happen if the man were to say anything to Potter. Still, he doubted it would be good.
By the time the sun had sunk halfway towards evening once more, Draco was finding it hard to breathe. If Harry didn’t come soon… He began to pace in front of the window, glancing out at the woods every so often, hoping for a glimpse of his new friend flying back toward him to help free him.
Narcissa seemed to be caught off guard. “That does seem a good number. Draco himself could have done with another sibling or two. But I…never managed.” She sighed, and for the first time since this quest to marry him off had started, Draco wanted to comfort her. His father had always been a busy man, and he knew his mother had always wished for a daughter, but the few pregnancies she’d had after Draco had never made it to term.
His smile faded as he remembered just why he was upset—the ball.
“About you.”
“Hai’llow!” he heard someone call, and turned to see a girl with short bright pink hair and wearing breeches.
"His mother is my sister. And my home is empty now. He can spend his time when not helping rebuild the Wizarding World taking care of my grandson." She smiled, the expression small and sad. It was reminiscent of Draco's mother in such a way as to make his chest ache. This might be all right after all.
"Nothing," Draco said. "It just happened. I wish you could remember."
Smiling, Harry nodded. “Yes. All right. I’ll be out here when you’re ready for a bit of escape.” He sobered. “Good luck, Draco.”
We watch as Harry opens the door, and can see his expression soften with pleasure when he finds Draco there. “Dr—Malfoy. I’m glad you could come.” He opens the door wider and steps aside to let Draco in.
“My god…look at you.”
“Draco…your clothes would never fit me.”
"So do you have a story for me today?" Potter asked as he passed the tray through.
We can see that Draco looks shocked and confused at this request, but after a moment, he nods, and the agreement brings the first smile in days to Harry’s face. “Right. I’ll…be right back again.” And then he is gone.
Draco saw the corner of her mouth twitch, but perhaps it was a trick of the light. "Indeed, Severus." She nodded behind him, and Draco turned to glance back at the hall. A crowd of students stood behind them. Not just the upper years, either. Third and fourth years were standing with their older friends, and even the lower years stood with their siblings.
It was sobering. For a moment, seeing Potter almost helped Draco forget why he was there. "Right." He settled back in his bunk, looking at him for a moment. "How are they going?" he asked.
Remus smiled softly and nodded. “They sent horses for us. Quite pleasant company, as well. Met Sirius’s cousin as we came in, too.”
After the war, things seemed to return to normal at Hogwarts. But for one group of students, things did not improve. The Slytherins, never a popular house, had become pariah, and none of the other houses in the upper years wanted to spend any time with them or partner with them in class.
Draco pulled away, feeling his face flame. “Get…get out!”
"I… don't know. I'm sure he's fine. Are you okay?"
“It is not as though it has not been tried before,” he said, turning to glare at him. “Great aunt Alabaster nearly married one.”
Draco glanced up from the parchment he was writing on. "Thanks. You've already gone round?" he asked, surprised.
Potter nodded. “All right. I’ll go take a shower, then come back at ten, shall I?”
"Who would be better placed to cast some of the spells cast to keep your little soirees secret from the professors? And who would benefit more? I assure you, Draco, this has gone on long enough. If you truly wish me to get the Headmistress involved, do continue to pretend innocence. I assure you, she will be even less pleased when I tell her."
Harry looked up, startled. “Prince Draco! Um…hold on. Let me get Egan saddled for you.” He smiled distractedly then disappeared into the stable.
“Harry Potter,” he says, his tone hopeful.
Draco’s eyes narrowed at that. “No. Just on us, apparently?”
Green eyes caught Draco’s once more. “Well, it is my name.”
Potter blinked. “Excuse me? What the…”
Harry laughed. "Yeah, well, one, at least."
Narcissa seemed impressed with the answer. “Oh? So…you have no objection to marrying the foes of your family?”
Harry nodded. "Yes, Headmistress. We apologize if it caused problems."
Draco shook his head, but immediately after, Harry cleared his throat and stood. "May I say something, sir?"
“You said there were seven dreams, right? And you’ve told me a bunch already, so there’s what, one left?”
Story based on the Frog Prince.
Those green eyes of Potter’s darkened, and he moved closer, his look more intent now. “How about the fact that you called out my name at the end?”
Harry’s fingers settled over Draco’s lips. “No buts, Draco. Not tonight. There’s just you, and me.” Then, before Draco could say anything to dispute that, Harry pulled him into another kiss, robbing him of the little breath he’d managed to keep from their last kiss.
Draco wasn't sure he'd heard right, but he did his best not to betray his confusion. Particularly when the Headmistress turned her gaze on him once more. "Is that right, Mister Malfoy?"
“You want…me.” Harry looked stunned.
Harry smiled, then he did turn to look at Draco. “Not a chance, sir.”
Draco’s aunt appeared that night, and Draco was even more glad he’d told Harry not to return in the darkness. Unfortunately for Draco, Fenrir was with her.
The children of Voldemort's Death Eaters, Marked or not, were also dealt with. Each gaining a guardian who would ensure their good behaviour. Should they prove upon their majority, or after five years, whichever was the longer time, they could be trusted in Wizarding society, then they would be released.
“Will he?” The voice wasn’t Draco’s. Nor was it Sirius’s. Instead, Lucius was standing off to one side of the path, glowering at them both. “And why would he do that when I cannot see you ever marrying my son, Prince Harry?” The last two words were sneered as though he refused to believe them.
"Couldn't… put… imperturbable… on?"
"After they found out what you were up to."
Harry’s arms went around him. "But… This is where you belong, Draco."
And Potter ended up with my wand. Not an outcome I'd have predicted, and definitely not something I was pleased about. But perhaps it all worked out for the best.
The man seemed content to watch Draco quietly, though his golden-brown eyes followed Draco as he moved to settle on the bench—then jumped back when he heard a growl from near his feet. A great black dog lay in front of the bench, and raised its head to bare its teeth at him.
‘Harriet’ cleared her throat, then decided against speaking and shook her head.
Narcissa was telling the girls that there was nothing to worry about, that he was still Prince Draco and that he would not eat them. Draco decided to give them a look at his new form, and see what kind of—awe—it could inspire. He stood up to his full height, stretching his neck out and towering over the others. There were a few shrieks of horror from the girls, but for now, Draco ignored them. He swished his tail a few times, banging it into the tree he knew was behind him, and then, for good measure, he gave his wings a few flaps—just to get out the kinks, of course.
Draco saw his mother react to the first name, though she said nothing about it. “We shall send riders to retrieve them. You shouldn’t be without such loyal guards. And we’ll have the best guest room made up for you, as well.”
Right up until the moment Potter appeared. How Potter had ended up in a place like this, Draco didn’t know. He hadn’t even known Potter
"What if? Draco…"
While Draco didn't doubt the Headmistress would take Snape's word over his, he refused to give in easily. Snape's true loyalties, attested to by Harry Potter himself, meant Snape was second to Harry himself when it came to adulation of the Wizarding World. He could do no wrong. Especially with those who worked alongside him, but doubted him upon Dumbeldore's death. Now that his name was cleared, they refused to doubt him again.
Draco couldn’t honestly answer the question. He wasn’t really sure why. Just that right now, he wasn’t ready to meet the world without Harry. Maybe someday, but not yet. Not now. "Because you saved me. Because I want to. Please?"
The king raised an eyebrow at this. “Indeed? You arrived with your king?”
Draco turned to see Harry standing behind him. “What?” He meant the word to come out sharp, but it was soft, an almost plaintive note to it.
When King Lucius arrived, Draco was the first to the door of his father’s carriage, opening it himself with a grin. “Father.”
Draco paled at the mention of the name, but nodded. "I did, sir."
"Well, no real harm done. Though we will be more strict should we find more of these gatherings, gentlemen. Are we clear?"
Potter looked sad. “Because…maybe the fact that I was trying so hard to get through to you meant that I wanted more?”
“Well…they are nice enough. But…I’d rather not say. Just in case. I wouldn’t want to end up with resentful subjects later, after all. Tomorrow. We’ve already planned for a ball then, anyway. I promise that by the end of tomorrow night, I will have a choice for you both.”
Draco shook his head. Even if he'd wanted to defend himself, there was no true defense for his actions.
The shrieks turned to screams at the thumping, and when his wings spread, one of the girls fainted, and another took to her heels, running for the safety of the castle. If Draco had been able, he’d have smirked. Still, there were four left. That was too bad.
Draco would have shouted for joy at the question, but nodded instead.
“…Didn’t mean…Please…Draco, I…wish you could understand.”
"Draco, come down here."
"A little ways. But I’ll be back as fast as I can. I promise."
At that, Draco looked wide-eyed at the two men. They were lovers? Harry had chosen to travel to their kingdom with two who were lovers? And had felt comfortable with it?
“Looks like we have at least one friend in the royal family, Sirius,” Harry said with a smile, reaching up to scratch at Draco’s head again in thanks.
"My sixth year, sir."
Draco nodded. "I just want to know they're okay."
“Well…I was sleeping. Then someone pushed at me.”
“You heard me. I’m not going to say it again.”
Draco glowered at him for a moment, then looked away. "My father loves me very much. But that doesn’t mean he’ll put up with anything I want, Potter."
Draco blinked. He’d never really thought about it. "I…don’t know. I don’t know any magic, but…she says I’m her nephew, so I must be, right?"
The flight was a quick one, though this time Draco avoided the road as best he could, landing out of sight of the main gate so that Harry could climb off his back. Harry scratched his head again, and Draco was quick to lean into the caress, letting it relax him.
The man dismounted, then approached Draco, his blue eyes narrowing. “What are you doing in here? You know this is the king’s forest, right?”
By the day of the wedding, anyone with eyes can see that Harry is having second, or possibly even third, fourth or fifth thoughts. He is very unhappy, despite his best friends’ encouragement that it is nothing more than nerves. It is only the sight of Draco arriving for the wedding that finally draws him out of his funk. Not only is it the first time he has seen Draco since the day the blond came to see him at his flat, but it is also the first time Draco has been seen in public since that day.
He knocks at the door, and someone lets him in—after a long and awkward moment of distrust. Shall we follow him inside?
Harry gave him a glower that said volumes about what he thought of that question. "Why would I, Malfoy? They treated me worse than you treated your house elves!"
, you Muggle!"
By the time he’d danced with ten young ladies, and three gentlemen (including Zabini, who had been far too grabby for Draco’s taste), and Harry still hadn’t shown, Draco decided he’d earned a break, and grabbed himself a goblet of wine, then made for the gardens, hoping for a bit of privacy.
When the two princes—or rather, prince and princess—emerged from “Harriet’s” room once more, the Gryffindor princess looked far more suitable to be the betrothed of the only heir of Slytherin. Her hair had been pulled artfully back from her face, done in braids that wrapped from front to back, then wound into a bun at the back of her head, and set off with sparkling pins that matched some of the trim on her bodice. Her lips were even more lush and full than before, with a soft pink color that made Draco want to smear them with his own lips. Her long, full lashes had been complimented with a soft green-grey shadow that gave her eyes a smoky look and set off their green color even more. Around her throat she wore a simple velvet ribbon that easily hid the Adam's Apple that would have given everything away. And the long velvet dress gave her soft curves that Draco knew for a fact she did not possess. Pansy was a genius.
She waved off the girl, who looked disappointed, but left the throne room with a curtsey. Once she was out of sight, Queen Narcissa turned to her son. “You have been putting this off for far too long, Draco. You are nearly twenty.”
"Well, I assume so. I don’t recall anything else. Why?"
When the man turned to look directly at him, Draco’s breathing sped up. Caught. Well, a Prince did not hide from others. He stepped out from the shadow of the hedge and approached the man.
That statement astonished Draco. It touched on a particular interest of his own, and that Harriet might be interested in the same story seemed almost too much of a coincidence. “Were they?” he asked her.
When he began to move, all Draco could do was hold on and gasp. Particularly when he brushed a spot that made sparks fly behind his eyes, pleasure finally flooding him. He cried out at that, arching up to get more. “Yes…please…”
Draco followed suit. “At least say you’ll come again tomorrow, to give me a bit of relief from those fools inside?”
“Oh, don’t leave on my account. Daniel and I were just about to find a more private spot to get to know each other better.”
Potter nodded. "I'm sorry if it upsets you."
“I will not do anything to him, sir. At least, nothing that he doesn't want. I just think spending time together might be good for both of us.”
“Um…they…well; they kind of want me to go with them.”
The smaller boy appeared next to them. "Dudley…"
"What kind of stories?"
“Well, I’m not. So leave, already.”
me your worst, Malfoy! Am I supposed to expect something I've never seen?"
And at the head of the crowd stood Harry Potter.
Draco nodded. “A very wanted prince. The only son. And long awaited…”
"Yes," Draco agreed again.
Staring after his betrothed for several minutes, gaping, Draco found himself wondering who the King had chosen in his place, and if they in any way compared to him. It took several growls from his stomach before Draco finally stumbled to his feet to scrounge up something for breakfast. Finding bread and cheese, he made a makeshift sandwich, then tried to clean himself up the best he could before he went to his former suitor’s palace. He was in no way presentable. He hadn’t washed properly since they’d left Slytherin, his hands and nails were in abominable shape, and his clothing was smudged and beginning to be tattered. He considered pulling out a new outfit from his bag, but he was scared of the same happening to it. Enough not to want to waste it on a man he hadn’t wanted in the first place, even if it did make him look bad. Let the man think he preferred this to marrying him.
"How about now?"
Harry scowled. "Like they'd ever waste that kind of money on me. They always left me with someone when they went on holiday. Why do you care? Trying to find more to taunt me with?"
But Draco isn't so easily won over with pleasant words, dear reader. “I wasn’t aware that I had a choice. Father said something about family honour. Let’s just get this over with, shall we? So…where is my room?”
“I think he should come live with me. Spend some time with me and my circle of friends. Instead of acting like a constant letch like he does. You do want him to be accepted, don’t you? This way I repay what your wife did for me, and he and I can work on what your family owes me. A fair arrangement, don’t you think?”
Those green eyes met his once more, and Draco allowed himself to believe that what he saw in them was hope. “Really? Me? But…”
It was hard to keep his face from going red, Draco looked away again. "Yeah, well…you didn’t dream it. And you weren’t the one so badly used, either."
“Startled?” The King looked dubious about this suggestion at best. “And how would you suggest we accomplish that, Dumbledore?”
“Give her a chance, Moony. She’s still got plenty of time,” Sirius said, sinking to the bench Harry had procured for himself. “Likely she’ll tell dear King Lucius, and he’ll have us tossed in the dungeons. He won’t much care that Harry has his own kingdom and that it will likely cause an incident…”
“But…see, that’s just it, Draco. I’ve never been able to ignore you. Not from day one.”
"I thought it would be simplest in the long run. You'd be comfortable, and without any preconceived notions of how I might treat you."
“I…know I don’t deserve a second chance, but…I’m asking.” He held out his hand. “Could…we start again?”
"Fenny? Who is that?"
If Draco had been human, he might have bit his lip at the question, but he refrained, not sure how to answer. The archers were still fresh in his memory. What if they were still up there? They might hurt Harry. Finally, he nodded slowly, then bent down to let him climb on once more. After all, he could stay out of reach until he was sure, then decide from there. He’d keep well away so that there would be no risk to Harry at all.
Draco wrinkled his nose at that. It sounded abominable. He sighed. “I wonder what mine will be…”
Draco blinked at him for a moment, unable to understand, his eyes widening when he realized how Dudley ended up in the water. "I sent him into the ocean?"
Instead, he made his way to his favourite fountain. But someone had beaten him to it. He hid behind the hedge, watching the other man, wondering who he was. He couldn’t recall ever seeing him before, but that didn’t mean the man wouldn’t know who he was. And as he’d escaped his captivity for the moment, he wanted to prolong the time he had out in the fresh air.
He had to pull away quickly when several of the archers, who had obviously been positioned on the battlements at the sight of Draco’s new form, began to fire upon him. The few arrows that did reach him only bounced off, but it was enough to tell Draco that he wouldn’t be able to land without terrifying everyone below.
Draco turned to glare at him, shrugging off his hand. “Obviously something you enjoyed too much to bother with anything else, which tells me everything I need to know about
He focused on Harry’s signature, approaching him then taking his hands. “Found you.” The handkerchief slipped from his eyes—he didn’t pay any attention to who had pulled it off—and looked up into the green eyes he loved so much. “You’re mine,” he said with a smile.
Draco blinked. Snape exonerated? When?
King Lucius raised an eyebrow at him. “Indeed? You think two hours of dancing and then leaving without a choice will get you any closer to finding a consort, Draco?”
Finally, Lucius nodded. “Very well, Draco. But remember—the future of our kingdom rests on your decision. Be very certain you choose not only what is best for you, but also what is best for them.”
Draco nodded. “Yes. It’s why I came here today.”
"Just go," he whispered, putting a hand over his face.
“Are more, aren’t they?” Harry asked, turning back to meet Draco’s eyes.
Two things fascinated me from a very young age: Harry Potter and the Dark Lord. From the time I could understand, father told me of them both. Of how our Lord tried to kill Harry Potter, a boy my own age, and failed. But some day, we would rise to greatness again, with the Dark Lord leading us.
“Different?”
Draco held his tongue. If this was about that day… well, he wasn't going to jinx it.
He waited until Granger left before speaking. "How's the head?"
“Everything.”
“That’s not it,” Harriet whispered back. “I…think I recognize him.”
“Still, they’re hardly doing it to upset him, Sirius…”
“Right. Like a canker sore.”
“Yes, well…the company’s suddenly got a bit too crowded for me,” Draco answered with a scowl in Potter’s direction.
Draco ignored the sour expression on Robards' face, then turned to his aunt. "And thank you for helping me this way."
