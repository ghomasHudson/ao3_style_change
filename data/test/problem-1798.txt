"She is," Hadrian confirmed, "Tonks-er, well, her name is really Nymphadora, but she hates it and tells everyone to call her Tonks-is also a Metamorphmagus. Maybe, after we take care of Dumbledore, you can meet her." Hadrian frowned, "Do you think Andromeda was spelled by Dumbledore? Maybe that's why she turned her back on everyone?"
"And other members of the Oder of the Black Rose," Draco interrupted, startling Harry, who had become used to the blond’s silent presence, "Yes, Sev; I believe we were able to come to that conclusion ourselves." Draco smirked at the dark-haired man, earning himself a glare in return.
"Finally," Severus sighed, sitting down at the desk in Draco's room and rubbing his temples, "The magic suppressant is out of Potter's system, and now we can focus on actually healing him." Draco was sitting on the bed next to Potter, his grey eyes weary.
"It is rather hard to wraps one's mind around, isn't it?" Draco agreed, with a thoughtful frown, "I never thought of the Dark Lord as an actual person; I wonder why Father never mentioned him? Even if he didn't want to tell me that he was the Dark Lord he could have mentioned that he and Uncle Sev had a friend named Tom…" He trailed off as the next memory started; Tom and his friends Severus, Lucius, Lily and Elena, as well as James Potter, Remus Lupin, and Narcissa, Bellatrix, Regulus and Sirius Black were standing in a room that was very familiar to Harry.
"Yes, it is," Hadrian countered, "It's your birthday-remember? Happy Birthday, by the way. We only have two hours until your party."
“I have not lied to you once!” Draco protested, giving into his own anger, “Just because you are too much of an idiot Gryffindor-”
He had set the timer on the ward protecting his wand for one hour from the time the handcuffs clicked closed around his wrists. This was his third time sitting on-or touching, rather, it was only his second time sitting-the stool, and the plug had activated several times; surely the hour was almost over? The next time he stood up, Harry decided he would feel for the ward and see if he could reach his wand yet.
"Interesting," Blaise said thoughtfully before getting to his feet, "Well, we-at least Theo and I-should get back to the party before someone comes looking for us. We should get everyone you've converted together sometime before school begins."
“I can agree to that,” Draco replied, brushing his lips against Harry’s scar before sitting back, “Now, since Frost has secured our compartment, why don’t you try to take a nap? No one can break through his wards, so you will not be bothered.”
“Why, worried you lost?” Draco teased, smirking when Harry glared at him, “Alright then, let’s have it; what were your final sales?” Draco slid off Harry’s lap, and walked around the desk, grabbing the top sheet of parchment and taking it back to Harry. Harry pulled out his own sheet of parchment, and the two examined them side-by-side.
“But that’s no fun,” Malfoy mock-pouted, “Besides-you look so cute when you’re glaring at me.” Harry’s glare intensified, even as he felt his cheeks flush from Malfoy’s comment. “That blush is even more adorable than the glare; if you’re not careful I may just have to snog you.”
“We should have spelled him to sleep until at least eight,” Draco grumbled, even as he climbed into bed with Harry. They lay down with Harry’s head on Draco’s shoulder, and the warm comforter pulled up to their chins. “I can’t believe I’ve been off work for a whole five days and we haven’t had sex once,” Draco pouted, “You’ve kept us so busy getting ready for Christmas that we haven’t had any time to relax.”
The orb returned to its previous silver color as the image of Aracely faded, and Hadrian looked at Draco with wide eyes.
"Yes, My Lord," Severus replied, "I found out just a little while ago that he sent Dumbledore a letter as well, severing all ties, and I happen to have a copy of it, if you wish to see it."
“Who are you?” Harry demanded, “I know someone is there; let me go, or I'll report you.” Harry received a chuckle in response, followed by a teasing touch running down his chest.
“Sure,” Harry said, and Ginny took the lid off the box; there were ten pieces inside, each one different. One had what looked like a rose petal on top, another a purple flower petal with sugar, and one had a curl of what he thought was orange peel. Harry selected a piece that looked to have sugar crystals on top, and took a bite. He discovered that it was salt, not sugar, on top, and the shell of the candy was dark chocolate, while the filling was caramel. The taste was amazing, the salt and caramel balancing each other perfectly, and Harry couldn’t stop his moan.
Malfoy was still opening his presents long after Harry finished, so he read his letters. The letters were the same as usual; Ron and Hermione told Harry that they wished he was with them, but they couldn’t tell him anything, per Dumbledore. The twins-in a joint letter-told him that the Order hadn’t held any meetings so far, but that Dumbledore had stopped by at one point and gotten into an argument with Sirius. Sirius’ letter told Harry that the argument was about Snape teaching Harry Occlumency; Sirius didn’t want Snape invading his godsons mind, but Dumbledore insisted it was necessary. Sirius’ letter also gave the basic steps for learning Occlumency, and instructed Harry to tell him if Snape didn’t follow those steps, because that could cause damage to Harry’s mind.
“What-that was horrible!” he said, “I can’t believe-that bastard is forcing her to marry someone who cheated on her? And the way he grabbed her-he’s abusive too!”
"We have some ideas," Hadrian said as he pulled away from Draco slightly-the blond wouldn't let him go too far however, and he didn't want to cause a big scene in front of the twins, so he let Draco keep an arm around his shoulders, "You two are brilliant with your inventions, so I thought that you could help us get the information that the adults want to keep from us, and we're going to get Neville and Luna in on it, but we haven't planned much beyond that."
"That was the basilisk that used to live in the Chamber of Secrets," Harry replied musingly, "She wasn't as big as she was when I saw her."
“Slytherins are very strange,” Hadrian shook his head, “You expect a reward for doing the right thing?”
“If you fight me, you will get a strapping you’ll never forget, understand?” Harry nodded once, and Petunia reached in to untie his gag, before pressing a vial of familiar potion against his lips. Harry swallowed it automatically, then reluctantly allowed Petunia to replace the gag. “You’re to stay in here until Vernon gets home; I have some people coming over, so don’t you dare make a sound!” Harry shook his head fearfully, and closed his eyes in relief when the door was shut; with Harry bound as he was, Petunia didn’t even bother sliding the bolt to lock him in.
"Well, we can't know anything for certain until we return everyone's memories," Lucius said, "We will, of course, see whether Andromeda was coerced by the Headmaster and do everything in our power to reverse his influence if he is responsible for her actions." Lucius smiled at his wife, adding, "I must admit, however, that I am glad you are the one I married."
“Some know at an early age,” Narcissa told him, “But many will not know what they are until after their Inheritance. It is not something for you to worry about right now; I just wanted to make sure you understand the dynamics so that you will not be confused when it is mentioned at school. There is, I believe, one Omega currently in Hogwarts; he received his Inheritance this summer, and so you will likely see how a courtship unfolds. You, personally, will not need to worry about your status for at least another four years. Now, if you do not have any more question, I am certain Draco is eager to go flying again.”
“Then we should go ahead and eat now,” Harry decided, getting out of the bed and heading over to the wardrobe to pull on a t-shirt; he was comfortable sleeping in his boxers, but he didn’t want to eat breakfast with no other clothing on.
Harry moved as silently as he could through the empty corridors, down one flight of stairs to a set of empty classrooms on the sixth floor. There were several rooms for him to choose from, all of which he had explored quite thoroughly over the last week and a half, but he already knew which room he wanted. At the end of the hallway was a large classroom which contained a small storage room at the back; the storage room was empty, save for a small stool sitting by the back wall; it was this storage room that Harry intended to use tonight. After a moment of silent deliberation, Harry decided to leave the classroom door unlocked; if Filch was patrolling and he found it locked he would come in and investigate, but if it was unlocked he was unlikely to enter the room.
Albus frowned again as he looked at the cabinet that contained his pensieve memories; it would be so simple to just view the memories, yet his younger self must have had a good reason for telling him to rely on the notes for information. He had already learned so much, including the information about Horcruxes. Could he really afford to take that time though? Things were getting close, especially after receiving that letter from Harry...He already had a solid plan though, one that he had developed once he uncovered the note telling himself that Tom Riddle had six Horcruxes. He knew that one-the diary-had already been destroyed, and he was close to figuring out where the next one was even without additional information from his younger self. He did have to wonder how his younger self knew about the Horcruxes, but that was not relevant to his plans. No, the most important thing was getting the boy back under his control.
“Wispy is being sorry,” the Elf wailed, “Wispy is failing! Wispy is not being able to enter where Dobby is being! House Elf magic is not being working!”
"Yes," Draco purred softly, pulling back to look at the flushed face below him, "Mine." He leaned in and pressed their lips together once more, but gently this time, coaxing Hadrian to reciprocate. When the brunet turned his head away to get his breath back Draco began trailing kisses down his neck; since Hadrian was no longer struggling Draco released his hold on the other boys wrists and instead smoothed his hands down across Hadrian's shoulders…his chest…down to his waist where he untied the belt on the bathrobe Hadrian was wearing.
“Sure,” Harry agreed, “I don’t know what time I’ll be home, though; depends on how long it takes us to clean up after closing.”
“Underage marriages were made illegal in the magical world a long time ago,” Draco informed him, “The only time underage weddings are allowed are if the couple involved agree to the bonding, and the parents sign off on it. We become magically of age at seventeen, but most of the older families have a clause stating that the children fall under their parents’ guardianship until they are married or reach a certain age-usually either twenty-five or thirty-five, which is why parents can still force their children into a marriage after they turn seventeen. If things here are not resolved before your seventeenth birthday, we will find a way to get Aracely out of that situation.” A soft chirp had both boys looking near Draco’s feet, where they saw Arden sitting with his front claws on the twin sphere.
“Later though,” I tell him, “I don’t think I’m up for another round at the moment. Was it a potion you used?”
"Of course," Hadrian rolled his eyes, "Not only do I have to be a Veela's mate, but we can't even have a normal bond.”
“I’m not repr-fine,” Harry sighed, “I’m repressed and hearing about your dreams would scar me for life.” The brunet yawned and turned back to the bedroom again; this time Draco followed him.
“I do not require you to offer your friendship again,” his mother told him, “I told Harry a condition of staying here was for him to try becoming your friend. If you do not outright antagonize him, then he will attempt to befriend you so that he does not have to return to Hogwarts or his relative’s. It would be helpful if you offered a truce, but nothing more is required of you until you see him making an effort. Already, he will be forgetting the troubles of the outside world, and your previous animosity will seem almost like a dream.”
"But you had time to notice Draco,” Neville pointed out, “Now that I think about it, you've always paid attention to Draco, to the point of obsession.”
Albus Dumbledore was furious, and had destroyed his office in a rage; how did this happen? He had always been so careful with the boy, giving Harry numerous privileges while in school and then ensuring that the Dursley's treated him appropriately during the summer; he had been working on Harry's conditioning for sixteen years, he couldn't fail now! He growled lowly as he re-read the letter he had received the previous evening.
"You is a bad cat you is!" Harry heard a squeaky voice that could only belong to a house elf, even though he couldn't see the creature, "Such a bad cat, trying to attack Master's peacocks! Wispy is putting you back in the forest where you is belonging!" The house elf (Wispy?) came into view, and Harry decided that it must be a female, with big blue eyes and wearing a grey towel spotted with dirt. When Wispy was in front of him, she saw something that made her gasp and Harry rolled his eyes at the dramatics of house elves; if she wasn’t going to let him eat the turkeys-er, peacocks-then he wished she’d just put him back in the forest so he could find something else to eat.
“Okay,” Harry said, voice a little shaky, “I’m starting to believe you, but it’s just so weird.” He looked up into grey eyes that were a light with curiosity. “I know you’ve changed from how you were in school-we both have-but…how can you be Santa Clause? I mean, where’s your beard?”
“What will happen when-if-Elena gets her memories back?” he asked, “I mean, she’s still married to Tom, but she’s also married to Brandon. Not to mention, what would happen to the kids?”
At thirty years old, Harry didn’t really look much different than he had at Hogwarts; he still chose casual Muggle clothing over proper Wizarding attire, and he still had an easy grin and brilliant green eyes hidden behind round glasses. Thankfully, Harry had traded in the thick black glasses for a smart pair of gold wire-rimmed glasses, Wizard-made, which suited his face better. He had finally stopped slouching and trying to hide, and now a quiet confidence was evident in his manner. Harry was still fit, even though he had started taking less field assignments now that he was a father, and his Indian heritage showed through; his skin had a healthy glow that had been absent during their school days. Harry’s hair was still wild, but it no longer resembled a tangled bird’s nest; Harry kept his dark locks just long enough to be pulled back in a low ponytail. The added weight tamed his formerly unruly hair, which shone with rich blue and purple highlights in the afternoon sunshine streaming through the windows; never before had Draco seen someone whose hair was truly the color of a raven’s wing. Every time he saw Harry, Draco’s fingers itched to tangle in those raven locks, to see if the raven hair was as soft as it looked.
"Um, sure," Hadrian shrugged, allowing Fred to cast a couple of detection spells, "What are you doing?"
“Professor!” Harry cried, running towards the headmaster, then stopping suddenly and looking down as if embarrassed; “What are you doing here? What’s going on? How did I get in the woods earlier?”
"I will send a house elf to wake you boys in the morning," Narcissa added, "Good night, boys." Hadrian and Draco bid the adults good night, and then returned to Draco's room so that they could work on the translation.
"Uncle Harry!" Teddy cried, at the same time that the boys yelled, "Daddy!" He then heard Scorpius and Albus call out "Papa!" and he turned, searching for his husband. Instead, the white dragon flew straight at Harry's chest. Harry's arms automatically rose to encircle the dragon, even as he fell backwards. Then, suddenly the dragon was gone, and his arms were full of a wickedly grinning blond, who cast a cushioning charm just before Harry hit the ground.
“Well then, we should get started,” Harry said, jumping down from the sleigh, and waiting for Draco to follow. The blond took his hand and Apparated them to a large room. Harry got a brief impression of bright colors, before his attention was captured by Draco’s lips on his, and insistent hands pulling at his dress robes. What followed, was a purely magical night, and the beginning of a wonderful life together.
At the end of two hours Hadrian had reluctantly left Riddle Manor; he had promised Draco to return in two hours so that the blond wouldn’t worry. Now he followed Draco over to the love seat and sat down next to the blond, expecting that Draco would want to look at the books.  He was surprised when, instead, Draco took the stack from him, set it carefully to the side, and then promptly twisted so that he was straddling Hadrian.
"Well, it was," Fred mock-pouted, "Only you kinda ruined it by expecting it. Seriously though-hurt him and I will make Dumbledore look like an angel; you have no idea what some of this stuff George and I invented does."
“Harry?” Draco’s sleepy voice drew him out of his thoughts, “What are you doing?” Harry flushed at being caught staring, and shook his head.
"The great Harry Potter trusts...me?" Dobby whispered in disbelief, his green eyes welling up in tears, "Oh, Dobby is so happy! Dobby can help Harry Potter sir hide until he is better! Dobby just needs to get something!" Dobby popped out, leaving Harry startled and a little uneasy as he didn't know where the little house elf had gone, but Dobby returned after only a few moments, holding a black leather collar in his hands.
Draco stood and allowed his mother to lead him out of the library. When she led him upstairs to the family wing, he became curious; was the gift in his room? But Mother had made it seem like he was only allowed to see the gift tonight, and that he would not be able to actually have it until the morning. His mother stopped in front of his room-no, she stopped in front of the door to the empty suite across from his room, and Draco’s curiosity increased.
"It is different for every pair of mates," Narcissa explained, "So I cannot say for certain what will happen, however I can tell you that Draco will be possessive before and for some time after you mate."
"What?" Hadrian gasped and shook his head, "No! Of course not!" A soft growl had him remembering that ne needed to be mindful of the Veela beside him, and he hastened to add, "We're still young, and it's too early to be worrying about things like that…" Hadrian frowned as he remembered that Veela mate for life, "…I'm not in any hurry for something like that, not when Draco and I are still getting to know each other."
"That won't work," he informed them, "We have to meet Narcissa for lunch at one, and then I'm sure we'll be going back to the manor. Is Hermione staying at the Burrow?"
“Er, first, sir, can you promise not to tell Professor Dumbledore about our conversation until after Christmas?” Harry asked hesitantly, “If you think the idea will work, I don’t want him to try and stop us.”
"There is one other thing I needed to tell you," Severus said, "Just before Fawkes found me, Lucius returned to the manor; it seems the Dark Lord has freed some of his followers, although Lucius was not sure who exactly had been freed as he was sent home immediately. I did verify that Harry is still safe; even Lucius cannot break the protection spells when Sanctuary is requested and then granted; I have offered to stay at the manor, ostensibly to help Lucius, but in reality I will ensure that Potter comes to no harm."
"Why do you care so much?" Harry asked curiously, turning his head a bit, this time dislodging the fingers that had still been combing through his dark locks, "We just found out we were evidently friends as children, but we spent the last six years hating each other."
"I agree with you," Augusta said after some time, and her son and daughter-in-law nodded, "We will join your cause to improve the lives of wizarding children and support you in the ministry. Now, the real problem is dealing with Dumbledore."
“Patience, Luv,” Draco murmured, using his tongue to trace the exposed skin between the ribbons wrapped around Harry’s waist and chest. He lifted Harry’s arms above the brunets’ head so they weren’t in the way of his explorations and kissed and licked his way across Harry’s chest. Draco soon found Harry’s nipples beneath the ribbon and kissed and sucked on them until the ribbon was wet with his spit. He kissed around the ribbon around Harry’s throat, and then removed the ball gag so he could take Harry’s lips in a bruising kiss. Tongues battled, taunting and teasing as the two men tasted each other. Draco carefully aligned their bodies until their cocks touched, growling when Harry whined and bucked his hips up in search of friction. Draco broke the kiss and waited until green eyes blown wide with passion focused on him.
“You wanted to see me, Mrs. Malfoy?” Harry stood hesitantly at the door to Narcissa’s study, nervously playing with the hem of his shirt-one of the many new articles of clothing the Malfoy’s had given him.
Harry took the lube and stretched himself with one finger, then picked up the plug, which was just a little wider than his finger, and also a little longer. Harry slowly inserted it, then slipped the silicone cockring over the head of his cock, sliding it down to the base of his cock until he was able to pull his balls through the opening. The cockring felt a little loose, so Harry cast a shrinking charm on it until it was just tight enough; after a moment’s thought, he also transfigured it to be steel, gasping a little at the harsher feeling, and watching breathlessly as his cock filled with blood.
“I believe Mother and Madame Longbottom will be the only adults,” Draco replied, “Mother is slightly annoyed because Father, Severus and Tom continuously forget to tell her about their plans, and so she has “forgotten” to tell them about tea with Madame Longbottom.” Hadrian laughed at that, shaking his head as he allowed Draco to lead the way downstairs, where they found Narcissa waiting for them.
“If you’re getting new robes anyway then stop complaining,” Hadrian said, yawning, “Go to sleep.” He turned over onto his side and snuggled down into the blanket. Draco grumbled softly a bit more before laying down behind Hadrian; he spooned his boyfriend, wrapping an arm around Hadrian’s waist and smiling when the brunet turned his head for a brief kiss before settling down to sleep.
“Thank you, Cousin.” Harry watched with wide eyes as the man disappeared, and he realized the cloak pin must have been a portkey.
"No, he would be disappointed in you for losing," the sardonic comment had Draco and Hadrian looking up to see Lucius standing in the doorway, "There is no need to worry however, as I will make an announcement to everyone that you are not to be attacked in my home. Bellatrix may still pose a problem though, so I would recommend avoiding her, and make certain that you are never alone with her."
The next morning, after breakfast, Draco insisted that they work on Harry’s dancing again, as it would take more than one lesson for him to become proficient at it. They practiced waltzing until lunch, and then settled in to relax that afternoon. The two sat in companionable silence for a few hours, before Draco decided to break it.
"Well, thank you both," Harry said to forestall any further argument, "I'm sure you're both thrilled to have me owe you a life debt."
“I mean you no harm, Harry,” the Snow Queen said, cupping his face and turning him to look at her, “I offer you safety and the chance to make a new friend. If you do not wish to come with me, I will not force you.”
"Yeah, it's not that we don't trust you Har-er, Hadrian," Fred agreed, "but you had the advantage of actually seeing the memories-we haven't."
"Calm down Potter," Snape drawled, "I have no intention of telling Dumbledore where you are, although I will expect some answers from you once you are healed. Speaking of which, Draco is going to help you sit up and turn over so that you can drink your potions." Harry had quieted down again and he nodded his agreement-or at least tried to nod.
"Come on Hades," he said, "Let's go flying." Hadrian laughed at Draco's sudden about face and allowed the other boy to drag him outside to the Quidditch pitch behind the manor.
"Everything you've had to put up with?!" Hadrian cried in disbelief, "You never put up with anything! Any time I really needed you, you abandoned me unless it was something that could get you recognition! In fourth year you even accused me of cheating to get in the Tri-wizard tournament and refused to talk to me! I heard you last year complaining to Dumbledore about how insufferable I am and how you hated pretending to be friends with me-well, guess what? You don't have to worry about that anymore! Oh, and you know how you beat out McLaggen for the Keeper position? You only did better than him-"
"As a half-Veela Draco will more than likely have a mate," Severus answered before Narcissa could reply, "He will come into his magical inheritance on his sixteenth birthday-which means midnight tonight."
“Yes,” Draco said, pulling back from the kiss, “So close…come for me Hadrian...with me…” He captured Hadrian’s lips in another brief kiss before the brunet threw his head back again, arching and crying out his pleasure as he came. Draco wasn’t far behind him, the sight of his mate writhing under him more than enough to bring him over the edge. Both boys lay there panting for a few moments before Hadrian began pushing at Draco’s shoulders.
“Harry James Potter,” Draco began, “We have known each other since we were children. You have seen me at my best, and at my worst. After getting to know you over the past several months, I have begun to realize that there is no one else I would rather spend my life with. Harry, will you marry me?” He flipped the box open, revealing a gold signet ring set with a single blood-red ruby. Harry was relieved it wasn’t some dainty little engagement ring; he might have had to hex Draco. Instead, Harry had no qualms when he let Draco slide the ring on his finger.
"I-Draco!" Hadrian turned his head to the side, embarrassed, and Draco released Hadrian's hand so that he could cup Hadrian's face and make him face him.
"Yes, Dumbledore went to extremes this time, and he has made things extremely difficult for us," Voldemort-or rather, Tom, agreed, "We shall bring Lucius in and allow him to view the memories, and then the three of us can decide where to go from there; it would be dangerous to allow everyone access to the memories right now lest Dumbledore discovers that we have our memories back."
“I am certain he will,” Draco said reassuringly, “It sounds as if he did not agree with the arranged marriage. You can check on her again in a few days; at least we know she is out of immediate danger.”
"Te! Piddy Twee!" Three-year-old Lily Potter giggled as her father carried her downstairs, dressed in her little nightgown with her cheeks still rosy from her bath. Today was the first day of Hogwarts Winter Holiday, and they had picked out their Christmas tree after picking twelve-year-old Teddy up from the station. Now that they had eaten supper and all the kids had taken their baths, their family was going to decorate the Christmas tree. And what a strange family they were!
“I will be here,” Lily laughed, “I wouldn’t dream of going anywhere else now that things are beginning to get interesting.” Narcissa laughed softly and shook her head before bidding Lily good-bye and going in search of her son.
Severus Snape was alone in his sitting room, enjoying a cocktail and contemplating his life. For sixteen years he had been leading a double life or-in Muggle terms-playing both sides of the fence. When he had first joined the Dark Lord he had truly believed in his aims, but then Voldemort's sanity started slipping further and further each year, until he had killed Lily Potter, the only woman Snape had ever loved. The attack on his unrequited love is what had prompted Severus to switch sides, and he became a spy for Albus Dumbledore, which is the only reason he managed to avoid a long stint in Azkaban. Then, the Dark Lord had come back and expected Severus to be a loyal servant once again, while Albus expected him to spy on his former master.
“Soon,” my lover promises, stilling as he bottoms out. He holds himself inside me, unmoving, for endless minutes, until I can’t stand it anymore. I begin writhing beneath him, trying to force him to move, but his hands grip my hips to keep me still, and it’s too much, the unrelenting pressure. He presses impossibly forward, until I think I think I could taste it if he came inside me at this moment, and I am pleading with him to move.
Supper was uneventful, the talk mostly centering on the grand opening of Nargles and Nibbles the following day. After the meal, however, when they were in Harry’s bedroom-Harry’s, because Draco technically still lived at Malfoy Manor-Harry had to bring up Draco’s news from earlier.
"Very well," Lucius agreed, "See him to the downstairs parlor and serve him refreshments if he so desires." Wispy agreed and popped out. "Hadrian, as your father is not here, would you like some-or all-of us to accompany you?"
A few minutes later found Harry in his old bedroom kneeling in front of his trunk. It had only taken him seconds to open it-the key had been hidden under a loose floorboard-and he was about to start looking for his invisibility cloak, when something caught his eye. It was a pair of mismatched socks, one sock red with flying golden snitches and the other gold with red brooms; the socks had been a gift from Dobby, and Harry nearly slapped himself for not thinking about the little elf sooner.
"Of course, My Lord," Severus agreed, bringing the Dark Lord the pensieve he kept in his lab here; the Dark Lord created a stand for it, and Severus set it down gently before adding the vials of memories, "Harry Potter is currently in stasis at Malfoy Manor, having suffered from grievous injuries the past two days; with your permission I will collect the items needed to save his life while you view the memories.”
"Yes sir!" Wispy bowed and popped out of the room as Lucius unrolled the scroll, Narcissa leaning close to read over his shoulder.
"Not yet," Draco corrected, "I am in the process of convincing Hadrian that he wants me. It was starting to work too, until you decided to interrupt us." He glared at the twins again, as he recalled his earlier frustration.
"It can be confusing to figure out what you feel," Draco conceded, "and I know I should probably give you some space to think, but that's just not me; I can't do that. If you want to talk about it however, I would be more than happy to listen. What happened with Luna and Neville yesterday?"
"They had better not stare at you if they know what's good for them," Draco growled, wrapping a possessive arm around his mates' waist; "I can't promise that I will be able to control my instincts the next time I perceive someone as a threat. What is Mother telling the guests?"
“You should have put it down as soon as you realized it wasn’t yours,” Harry glared, “I guess you just couldn’t resist getting ammunition against me; go on then-make fun of poor orphaned Harry, who’s only living relatives want nothing to do with him. Then, you can tell me how you really feel about me, and maybe you can get your parents to call off this stupid ritual so you won’t have to sully yourself with me.”
Harry left the headmaster’s office before Dumbledore could reply, and slowly made his way to Gryffindor Tower. The common room was empty, and so was the dorm; it seemed that everyone had gone home for Christmas. Harry looked around the dorm and noticed that his belongings hadn’t been returned; he shrugged and climbed into bed, pulling the hangings closed and burying himself under the covers. He briefly recalled what Dumbledore had said about being a Horcrux, but quickly pushed it away; he couldn’t deal with that at the moment-not until he knew Draco was safe.
"I've only heard a couple in passing," Hadrian replied, "Like, did it hurt when you fell from heaven? And: I lost my number; can I have yours? I also heard my cousin tell some girl: You must be tired, because you've been running through my mind all day."
“Wha-?” Draco leant in and pressed their lips together in a passionate kiss, nibbling and licking as he sought entrance to Hadrian’s mouth. When Hadrian parted his lips Draco eagerly lapped at the warm cavern, teasing Hadrian’s tongue with his own. He kept one hand tangled in the other boys dark locks, and trailed the other one down so that he could caress Hadrian’s chest beneath his shirt. Hadrian moaned into the kiss, involuntarily thrusting upwards when Draco flicked his nipple. When Hadrian felt Draco’s erection through their combined layers of clothing he thought about stopping, but instead found his hands clutching tightly to Draco’s waist as he rutted against the Veela.
“You’re alive!” Draco greeted Harry with a hug, and the brunet fought to keep from collapsing against his friend, “You’re a bloody maniac, but you’re alive, thank Merlin!”
"No," Severus shook his head, "Elena didn't betray you-and she isn't dead." He held up the vial with the combined memories and explained the contents, "This vial contains memories of your school years and immediately after leaving Hogwarts, the truth of what happened that night in Godric's Hollow, and Dumbledore's memories from two nights ago, which are important for you to understand what is happening right now, and why Potter wishes to change sides."
"Stupid git," Harry muttered, glaring as he sat across from the blonde, "Fine, what do you want to know?" At Malfoy's nod Harry grabbed an apple and poured a cup of tea; he was starving, but his stomach felt somewhat queasy, and his back was beginning to ache.
"You made me chase you my girl," Dumbledore shook his head, "Flooing to Potter Manor and then apparating here; did you really think you could throw me off?"
"The Dark Lord," Draco replied promptly, "He doesn't know we've told you the truth yet, so you should still refer to him as you would have before tonight. Do you two have any other questions?"
"Arden lit her robes on fire," Snape informed them, "Needless to say, Miss Parkinson was not pleased and she left for the evening. Now come; Narcissa said it is time for dinner and presents."
“Yes?” Draco stepped in front of Harry, standing between him and the older boy, “What can we do for you, Diggory?”
"I hate him," Harry seethed, "He ruined my life! And not only my life, but the lives of so many others!” Harry could feel his magic struggling to escape again, but Draco’s continued embrace helped him to calm down and keep it under control; he still had more questions to ask-freaking out again could wait until he was alone and there was no one around to get hurt. “How did he change everyone's memory?"
Harry was so busy planning his escape, that he didn’t realize his Dudley and his gang had come back outside until someone grabbed his arm.
"Tom said we should wait to tell Hermione until they have a chance to try and heal Bellatrix," Hadrian said, "but...we could really use her help."
"I'll keep that in mind," Hadrian said and then they sat in silence for a few minutes as Draco resumed carding his fingers through Hadrian's hair. After a while Hadrian stirred and pulled away; "You need me to sleep in here tonight?" Draco nodded; "Okay then, I'm going to change into my pajamas," he told Draco and the blond reluctantly loosed his grip; "I'll be back in a few minutes."
“I can’t go into details, but Astoria will only be able to have one child,” Draco said, “Something happened to her-it isn’t my place to tell.”
"Yes, I do," Hadrian replied, hiding a grin as Draco’s shoulders slumped in disappointment; the other boy quickly hid the disappointment with a smile and started to turn away.
"Ah, poor little Hadrian can't handle the adult talk," Fred teased as he put away the collars and chokers before Hadrian could get a good look at them, "I guess that means he won't be interested in backing our line of adult products."
"Yes Uncle," Harry replied and picked up the cup with his eyes averted; he knew that the tea was spiked-did Vernon really think he was stupid? Now, the question was which potion had he put in the tea, and would Harry be able to just pretend to drink as he had with Umbridge last year. Harry decided he would just have to take a chance, so he closed his lips tightly and pretended to sip the tea. After his third pretend sip Harry let the teacup fall from his hands and spill on the floor. After a few seconds he looked up and saw Vernon glaring at him angrily. "I'm sorry Uncle," Harry said, "I didn't mean to-“Harry widened his eyes in feigned surprise before throwing an accusing look at his uncle, “You-you drugged the tea! I-I can't-" Vernon stood up to walk around the desk, and grabbed Harry by the throat, lifting him out of the chair and throwing him onto the floor.
“Sure,” Hadrian agreed, “I’d like to see the gardens.” He stood up and held out his arms to Arden, who looked at him in contemplation before leaping up gracefully; he climbed so that he was arranged around the brunet’s shoulders, and then they both looked expectantly at Draco.
"I'm sorry about this Elena, but I have to do what I can to keep Artemis and Luna safe," the man said sadly, "I would help you if I could."
The sphere activated, and the boys saw that Aracely enter a large bedroom containing two sets of bunk beds, an entertainment are with a television and a gaming system, and shelves of books and videos. Two younger children, a brown-haired boy who looked to be around seven, and a blonde girl of about ten years, were fighting over the control for the game, but they both looked up as Aracely entered the room. As soon as Aracely closed the door, the sound on the orb activated, and the little girl was running over to Aracely.
"That's very generous of you sir," Tom said calmly, "However I will have to decline; I plan to join the ministry so that I can work to change the laws regarding contact between wizards and Muggles, as well as work to improve living conditions for magical children being raised by Muggles."
to the Dark Lord? Well, he would obviously have to show him the stolen memories; Severus had found that, once he allowed the memories to sink in, he had begun remembering other things that had happened, things which had been buried deeply in his mind and locked away without his knowledge. It was highly likely that the Dark Lord would experience the same thing, and further plans could be made once His memories were restored.
"That you're not gay?" Draco interrupted, "Oh, until I believe you, which won't be happening anytime soon, not with the way you always cuddle up to me in my bed and try to catch a glimpse of me when I get out of the shower...not to mention you're always freaking out so that I can hold you and calm you down."
Before straddling the dildo, Potter had inserted a small vibrating item, which Draco hadn’t seen before; if he sat on the dildo, however, the small item would be pushed further into Potter’s anal cavity, which Draco thought was hot beyond words. Potter’s wrists were cuffed and attached to a hook on the ceiling; the chain was long enough so that he was able to rest his feet comfortably on the floor but, after a moment of examining the configuration, Draco realized the chains would pull on Potters wrists if he were to sit on the stool. Potter had a thick black blindfold around his eyes to complete his bondage scenario, although Draco saw that there were still a couple of items left on the desk-after a quick glance to make sure Potter couldn’t see him, Draco cast a silent muffliato and walked over to the desk; lying on top were Potter’s magazine, a pair of small silver clamps, and a red ball gag. Draco stood so that he could keep an eye on Potter, even as he looked at the magazine and noticed the differences between Potter’s final scenario and the one on paper. He discovered that the small vibrating item was called a bullet, and deduced that Potter was using it to stimulate his prostate; what a treat, to find out that the smaller brunet was in to both pleasure and pain. Potter, Draco decided as he looked at the scenario in the magazine again, needed some help in making his fantasies a little more realistic, if this was anything to go by.
“Yes,” Harry said, “I’ll marry you, Draco Malfoy.” He drew the blond into a kiss. He broke away after a moment to ask, “What about the kids?”
The boys had been in Draco’s room for the past ten minutes, with Hadrian attempting to call Tillie so that he could have a bedroom set up, and Draco preventing him from calling the house elf. Hadrian was seriously considering hexing the blond, but his wand was still in his trunk; he made a mental note to unpack it as soon as possible.
The envelope held the deed to some property in France, and Draco explained to Hadrian that it was a Malfoy tradition to give the heir his own property at the age of sixteen; the other gift from Draco's parents was a new set of Quidditch gear.
“Professor Snape, Harry,” Dumbledore interrupted, giving him a stern look, “He is your teacher, and you will show him respect.”
“Yes,” he whispered, as Draco stopped right in front of him. The other man raised one pale, slender hand and traced the edge of the choker, before gently flicking the bell to make it ring.
“You have an early day tomorrow,” Draco reminded him, “And I have a meeting in the morning; I can’t see either of us getting much sleep if I stay.”
“I was worried about going back to school,” Harry replied, “I’m still worried. I like having you for a friend; what if Dumbledore or Umbridge doesn’t let me talk to you? What if Ron and Hermione cause problems? What if your dad-”
“The Ritual itself is fairly simple,” Draco told him, “We will each be wearing an amulet charmed by either Merlin or Morgana; the amulet is to identify the dominant and submissive partner in The Ritual, and will be the only items we wear. Once we remove our clothes and don the amulets, we will spill our blood into the chalice while thinking about what we wish The Ritual to accomplish. Once the chalice begins to glow, the magic will transform our blood into a potion, which we will each drink half of. After we have drained the chalice, you will kneel in the center of the circle and speak your promises out loud. Do you know what promises you have to make?” Harry nodded, and Draco continued, “Okay, then I will kneel behind you and make my own promises, before accepting yours. After that we consummate the bond, and The Ritual will take control of our magic to do the rest.”
Harry stood there in shocked silence, unable to believe what he had just seen; James and Lily had a daughter…they didn’t have a son…James and Lily weren’t his parents.
"I wonder what Severus will tell him," Narcissa mused, "He'll have to let him know that Hadrian is here, otherwise Dumbledore will never trust him when he eventually finds out, but he has to make up something to explain why he can't make Hadrian leave…"
“Well, Santa, it’s Jack Frost again,” Bernard said, “He has decided that he wants his own holiday, and he has caused a riot at the workshop. Curtis and I tried to stop him, but…well, Curtis is now frozen. I barely escaped.”
"Yes, Master Draco!" Tillie said excitedly, "Tillie is doing as you asks!" Tillie vanished, and reappeared a few seconds later with the vial of memories, "When Young Master is done call Tillie and Tillie will return memories." She bowed once again and left.
The rest of the day passed in a similarly busy manner for Harry. There were always kitchen mishaps which caused the House Elves to panic, at least one reindeer tended to act out, the naughty and nice list was forever being misplaced, and, on occasion, Jack Frost and his snow imps showed up to cause mischief wherever they could. Then, when Blaise finally made his appearance, the second-in-command seemed to thrive on countermanding Harry’s orders, meaning Harry had to work twice as hard just to keep everything running smoothly. By the time the supper bell rang, and everyone got ready for Santa’s send-off, Harry was ready to rip his hair out-or hex Blaise and Jack Frost; maybe banish them both to somewhere far away. Honestly, this was only their second year having the North Pole operational, and Blaise was more of a hindrance than a help. As for Jack Frost, Harry had no idea where he came from; he suspected Frost was either a Veela or George Weasley in disguise. Harry was betting on the latter.
"Yes," Lily scowled, "Once he realized he couldn't manipulate us Dumbledore taunted us with information about what he did to the children; about a year after our deaths he couldn't take the guilt anymore, so he removed his memories and promptly forgot about us. Tell us, Cissa; how is our daughter? Is she being treated well?"
“I have a potion for that,” Draco withdrew a silver vial from his pocket, “I will make sure you are well-prepared when the time comes.” He looked up at the sky, and saw that the edge of the moon was just visible in the clearing. “Speaking of time, are you ready to begin? We need to have the ritual completed before the moon reaches its zenith.”
I step out into the corridor, pausing to listen but the only sound I hear is that of my own breathing. The hallways are empty right now, with everyone being in the Great Hall for lunch, and I am completely alone. I make my way through the chill dungeon, once again taking in the lack of holiday décor so prevalent in the rest of the castle. I shake my head, my thoughts on the professor whose rooms I just left; I wonder what he would do if someone decorated the dungeons one night while he was sleeping. I would love to see the expression on his face if he stepped out into the corridor and found it covered with holly and mistletoe, and garlands and tinsel, with a large tree in every alcove. Now, how to pull it off without it getting traced back to me? Well, the Sorting Hat hadn’t wanted to put me in Slytherin for no reason; I would just have to come up with a foolproof way to execute my plan.
“All the potions have been distributed, A-Albus,” Pettigrew stuttered, “We have confirmations that even the magical communities in Russia and the America’s have received the altered memories. James, Lily, Sirius and Remus don’t suspect anything either, and the-the Dark Lord has marked several more wizards.”
"Harry," Draco said softly, motioning for Severus to take the pensieve; he did so and motioned for Lucius to enter-with a glance at his master Lucius complied. "Harry, that was…terrible," Draco placed a hand on Harry's shoulder and felt both relieved and worried when he wasn't pushed away; it was like Harry didn’t even notice Draco touching him, "Please talk to me; you can't keep this all in…"
“Finally!” Pansy exclaimed, “I’ve been trying to get you up here all year! Are you finally going to let me make you a new uniform?” She didn’t wait for a response, but immediately flicked her wand and set her tape measure to work.
“I will go to Hogwarts,” Severus announced, “If Dumbledore is behind this, I will find out. I’ll meet you back at the Manor as soon as I can.” Narcissa and Draco nodded, then stepped into the Floo to return home. Severus waited until they were gone, then headed back into the ministry; he would be going to Hogwarts later, but first he wanted to see who was missing from the ministry. The new minister would likely be able to confirm whether certain employees were still at work, or if they had left early, it was just a matter of persuading him to help.
"Of course," Dumbledore nodded, smiling, "Xenophilius and his wife Artemis must be watching them; how fortunate that the Molly sent her children over as well-along with Peter the two older boys can help keep track of Ron, Percy and the Twins, and before the day is out they will have a new baby sister."
"For Merlin's sake," Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed Hadrian by his wrist, pulling him further onto the bed, "I'm not going to rape you in your sleep Hadrian; stop being so melodramatic." Hadrian's only response was to stick his tongue out and roll over on his side, facing away from Draco to hide his blush. Despite his arguments about not being tired, it only took the brunette a few minutes to fall asleep, not feeling Draco's watchful eyes on his back. Draco waited until Hadrian's breathing was slow and even, and then carefully pulled the other boy closer, arranging them so that Hadrian's head was on his chest; if Hadrian hadn't been so exhausted he definitely would have woken up, but as it was Draco was able to wrap the other boy in his arms and hold him in a secure embrace. He couldn't explain why he wanted Hadrian to be so close to him, but he just couldn't help himself, and it felt so right…with that happy thought, Draco drifted off into a light slumber, a small smile gracing his face.
His resolve weakened twenty minutes later, when his legs were shaking from another round of vibrations. His ankles felt like they were on fire, and Harry wondered why he decided to wear the heels with the straps; as tightly as he had done up the straps, there was no way he could kick them off. He shifted on his feet for a few minutes in an effort to get more comfortable, before giving in. Harry sat down on the stool, his ass planted firmly in the middle as he leaned forward to alleviate the pull on his arms, and took a few deep breaths as he thought about his situation.
"Of course not," Draco scoffed, and Hadrian was happy to hear the tiniest note of amusement in the blonde's voice, "I will take care of choosing your outfit."
“Yes, but Mother might choose to disregard that,” Draco said, “She is very particular about appearances.” The two stood together in silence for a few minutes, Harry leaning his head against Draco’s shoulder as they looked out at the moonlit landscape. Eventually Draco sighed, causing Harry to tilt his head back to look at the blond. Draco took the opportunity to lean down and kiss his fiancé, enjoying the feeling of Harry in his arms as they had been too busy to relax over the past few days. After a few minutes, Harry broke the kiss and stepped back, holding Draco’s hand, and crossing towards the bed.
"That reminds me," Draco began, "The life debt; I think we should settle it now and I know what I want."
“Harry,” Draco called softly, shaking Harry’s shoulder. The brunet responded with a groan, and promptly rolled over, pulling a pillow to cover his head. “Stop being ridiculous,” Draco scowled, yanking the blanket down and making a grab for the pillow.
“Then we will look elsewhere,” Narcissa said calmly, “Dobby, you stay here until we are ready to go.”
“Wonderful job,” Dumbledore praised, “We will go out over the next few days and similarly mark some other witches and wizards that I have already selected. For now, however, we have other things to take care of. Alastor, I need you and Kingsley to take everyone down to the dungeons, to the rooms we already prepared; you know what to do once you are there. I shall take care of Tom and-Molly, Arthur; why don’t you take Ginny home to meet her brothers?” Dumbledore withdrew several potions vials and handed them to the Weasley patriarch, “Make sure everyone takes their potions so that there is no confusion, and we will meet up again in a few days.”
After viewing the first set of memories Severus was stunned, but he knew there was more, so he continued to view them, one vial after another. Oddly enough, one of the heavily warded vials was from a few nights ago, but Severus understood why it was there once he viewed it; the memory showed Albus betraying his students trust and giving Muggles-Muggles!-potions to use against him.
“Nope, even better,” Sirius’ grin turned mischievous; “Follow me.” He led the two boys to the Muggle side of King’s Cross, and then down a side alley, where a motorcycle was leaning against the wall. “I enlarged the side car, so we can shrink your trunks, and then you two can sit there. I’d let one of you sit on the seat behind me, but Narcissa forbid it, so…”
"I received a most interesting letter this morning," Voldemort informed him, "It was from Harry Potter-" Severus jerked at that and saw the small, cold smile on the Dark Lord's face, "Stand up Severus, so we can have a real conversation. Ah, that's better. Yes, Harry Potter sent me a letter saying that Dumbledore betrayed him and he was no longer going to work for the light-he has even offered to join me; isn't that wonderful news?"
"This place is being far away from the bad people who hurt Harry Potter," Dobby informed him, "Harry Potter is being careful; there is being wizards close by, but they is not looking for Harry Potter so Harry Potter is being safe." Harry butted his head against Dobby in thanks and then bound further into the forest, quickly leaving the small house elf behind.
“Don’t mention it, Diggory,” Harry replied, “I don’t need your thanks, not after you called me a liar and a cheat. Go back to Hufflepuff; we’re just lousy snakes remember?”
“Ah!” Harry cried out in shock before he could stop himself; the stool shocked him! Seconds later, the plug began vibrating again as well, stronger than last time, but not as strong as it had previously been. Harry almost forgot about the stinging hexes on his leg, so focused was he on the vibrations in his ass, until a particularly strong hex had him yelping at the pain and renewing his efforts to get free. As the pain increased, the vibrations stopped and Harry had nothing to distract himself. It was with great relief and an almost-sob that he pulled his leg off the stool when the ten minutes were finally over.
"Hey Fred!" Hadrian called out as he entered the twins joke shop with Draco at his side, "Is George here?"
“What do you mean?” Harry demanded, “I took the potion, just like you said!” Draco gripped his hand tightly, as he realized what Snape was saying. A quick glance at Harry told him that his husband was still clueless.
“I am glad you have been happy here,” Narcissa smiled down at him, “I look forward to seeing you again this summer. Be safe, Harry. You as well, Draco. Do not let anyone tear you two apart.”
"I have something in my room for you to wear," Draco looked at Hadrian expectantly until Hadrian rolled his eyes and walked towards the doorway connecting the two rooms; as he passed through it, Draco stepped up behind Hadrian and wrapped his arms around the younger boy's waist, gently nuzzling his neck.
"Hey!" Hadrian protested, "I didn't know if I could trust you-I'm surprised I even thought to ask for Sanctuary, since I only heard Sirius mention it once!"
"Who? Oh, you mean Potter?" Pansy sneered, "What would I want with him? I was only being nice earlier because your family offered him sanctuary, but he obviously has no manners as he turned down my gracious offer of a dance. Really; what would I want with a pathetic little Half-blood? The Dark Lord will dispose of him eventually anyway." Throughout her speech Draco's growl had been getting louder, and Hadrian could once again feel talons pressing against his skin, although they didn't actually pierce it.
"To a certain extent," Lucius confirmed, "Although Tom has made sure Draco knows not to abuse his power too much. I am just wondering how Hadrian came to be in possession of the collar."
“I’m fine,” he said, “Still a little confused, I guess, but other than that…” He shrugged, “I’ve always known the Dursley’s weren’t nice people; this is just one more thing that they took from me. It’s nothing new, really.” Harry stood before his friends could reply, “I’m going to go check on the boys.”
“This way please, Madame Longbottom,” she led the way out to a side garden, where tea had been set up and placed under a warming charm. “Milk?” She asked, as she served the tea.
"Yes," Tom answered in a low voice, "Salazar wrote much of it in Parseltongue, however I have managed to translate one of the books; it details potions that can be used to counter the damage-both mental and physical-caused by using or being subjected to dark curses. Severus has been reading my translations and he found the description of a potion that should heal Bellatrix and the Longbottom's, but the actual instructions and ingredients for the potions are written using a combination of Parseltongue, Runes and Arithmancy."
Harry remembered the vision, and how he had felt as if he were the one to bite Mr. Weasley. Then, he recalled the surge of blinding hatred he had felt when he looked at Dumbledore. What if his friends didn’t want him around? Ron was aware that Harry had seen everything through Nagini’s eyes; what if he thought Harry was possessed? Hell, what if Harry was possessed? He could be endangering his friends by joining them! Maybe he was better off staying at Hogwarts…but no; he couldn’t take one more night of Snape ripping through his memories and mocking him, or Umbridge insulting Harry’s friends while he was forced to write in his own blood.
“Of course he does, Harry,” Ginny gave him a worried look, “The children get presents from him every year. Remember last year? The training wand for James and the flying dragon toy for Albus?” She looked fondly down at the two-year-old girl sleeping in her arms and added, “Lily got that unicorn plushie.”
The shop was set to open the following morning, and Harry was relieved that they had gotten everything set up in time. For the first week, they had decided to be open from ten in the morning to nine at night; they would both work Friday through Sunday; Luna would be off on Monday and Tuesday, and Harry would be off Wednesday and Thursday. Mrs. Weasley had insisted on providing the baked goods and cooking supper (she said she needed something to keep her busy, now that she had no more children at home), and Ginny agreed to help her when she didn’t have Quidditch practice. Rolf Scamander, Luna’s fiancé, agreed to help with stocking the shelves and running the register three days a week, and Lavender Brown had also offered to help out three days a week. Mrs. Weasley refused to be put on the payroll, but agreed to accept a portion of the sales from her food, and Rolf was also working for free, since his fiancé was co-owner. This meant that only Ginny and Lavender were getting paid, and Harry thought that they really shouldn’t need any more help than that at the moment. Hermione and Ron were currently in France with her parents and not set to return until Christmas Eve; they had both offered to help when Harry re-opened the shop the day after Christmas though.
“An annulment is not the same thing as a divorce,” Draco pointed out, “Father wasn’t happy with the plan, but he eventually admitted that, while divorces are not allowed in our family, there are no rules against getting an annulment.”
“I don’t want to be forced into a bonding,” Draco said, and Potter smiled at him before turning back to the bedroom; “However,” Draco continued, “That isn’t to say I object to a bonding with you-just the forced nature of it.” Potter looked over his shoulder, emerald eyes widened in surprise, then laughed weakly.
"I'm not tired," Hadrian replied, "I am starting to get hungry though, and I think Arden wants to go out; why don't you take a shower so that we can go down to breakfast together?"
“I guess I really am a little freak,” Harry muttered, pulling on his chains in the hopes of getting a little more leeway with them. It didn’t work, and instead he began counting, trying to guess when the sticking charm would let him up. He was distracted, however, when the plug began vibrating, this time at a gentle speed that only served to tease.
Hadrian noticed with a start that Draco's eyes had started to glow silver and a quick glance down revealed that his fingers were tipped with talons. Hadrian frowned; why were Draco's Veela traits coming out? All he'd been doing was joking with Lee-oh! Draco's instincts must be acting up, making him think Hadrian was serious about not really wanting him; he gave an internal sigh-hopefully Draco’s possessiveness would die down soon.
"Salazar Slytherin himself," Lucius replied, "It seems that Tom is his descendant, as is Hadrian, of course; that is one of the subjects Severus is discussing with our lord. Griphook indicated that the books may have counter spells to reverse the effects of long-term suffering under the Cruciatus Curse."
After watching the manor for what felt like hours to his empty stomach, Harry hadn't seen anyone on the grounds and came to the conclusion that no one was home- or, if they were home, they were somewhere within the large manor and unlikely to see him. The large white birds he saw last night were gathered by a pond several yards from the gazebo, and Harry idly thought to himself that they were strange looking turkeys-they seemed to have long, flat tails instead of the fan normally seen on a turkey and they didn't have the beard either. Dismissing it as unimportant, Harry located a branch that was near the fence and allow him easy access to the grounds beyond; he crouched low on the branch and then leapt over the fence, feeling a faint tingle of magic as he crossed the boundary. He crouched behind some topiaries and remained still as he waited to make sure that the wards had not alerted whomever lived here to his presence.
"Calm down now Dray," Hadrian said softly, relaxing into the Slytherin's hold and laying his head back on Draco's shoulder; "Severus and Arden will take care of her; she shouldn't bother us again tonight."
“Of course, Harry; I simply forgot,” Draco said, then added with a sly smile, “I wouldn’t be able to call you Potter for much longer anyway, and it might be a bit confusing if we called each other ‘Malfoy’ all the time.”
Harry thought about it; he’d rather live with Sirius, but Dumbledore would never let him do that. If he took the Snow Queen up on her offer, at least he wouldn’t have to return to the Dursley’s again. Still, this could be a trap; what if she was working for Voldemort?
"I don't think so Potter," Malfoy replied calmly, "You came here on your own, as near as I can tell, and we have things to discuss. You were hungry enough to attempt eating a peacock-not that I mind necessarily, they are horrid birds, always attacking me as a child-therefore we shall sit down to lunch and talk about how you came to be here and why-as well as why you are in possession of an item that rightfully belongs to my family. Now, sit Potter." Malfoy turned his back on him and walked over to the window where there was a small table with a decent-sized lunch spread out. While the Slytherin's back was turned Harry reached up to pull his trunk off the collar-only to find out it was gone. He looked over at the blonde frantically, only to see Draco smirking and holding the charm in his hand, "You'll get this back later, if you can remain civilized," Malfoy informed him, "Now sit."
After several minutes, Potter stepped out of his heels, and Draco watched, riveted, as the other boy sank down onto the dildo, only to gasp and suddenly stand back up; the small pained gasp Potter emitted went straight to Draco’s cock, and the blond groaned as he increased the speed of his strokes.  After a few seconds, Potter began to slowly lower himself on the dildo again, and his next gasp tipped Draco over the edge, drowning him in a sea of white.
“I thought we could get some shopping in first,” Hermione counters, “Then we can stop for lunch, and go skating after.” The other three agree, none of them at all surprised that Hermione has planned out their entire day, and Harry hopes he can use the reprieve to come up with an excuse not to skate; despite outward appearances, he really isn’t dressed for it.
"That would be great," Hadrian beamed, "Thank you Narcissa; I'll give you some of my money to use for my clothes-"
“That man was your mother’s cousin, Sirius Black,” Lucius replied, turning his gaze to Harry, “He is also Harry’s godfather.”
“It is good that you are getting started on it early,” Narcissa smiled approvingly as they entered the house, “I am off to contact Lucius, so I will see you both at supper tonight.” The boys told her goodbye and headed up the stairs back to their room to begin working on the Parseltongue translation.
"Thank you, My Lord," Severus bowed before going into his lab to get the items he would need; when he came back out he bowed again, but his Lord was already in the pensieve so he left the old mansion and returned to Malfoy Manor, where he set about healing the injured child lying broken on his godsons bed.
Potter writhed in the chains, and Draco pulled back so that he could see the other boys face; Potter was panting, his mouth open as his hands clenched around the chains. Every few seconds he would let out a quiet whimper, but Draco wasn’t sure if it was from pleasure or pain; either way, the expression on Potter’s face was exquisite, and Draco quickly released his hold on Potter so that he could resume stroking his own erection.
"I am going to the library to look for those books," Draco announced, picking Arden (the little dragon had been taken to the kitchen to eat, and then returned by Tillie near the end of breakfast) up and settling the dragon around his shoulders, "Do you want to join me, or will you meet me back upstairs?"
“Well, Aracely found her own way out,” Draco said once the images faded, “From what she said earlier, I would gather she has gone to your grandfather for assistance. I have never seen mirrors used in that manner before; I had no idea mirrors could be used for travel!”
"Because Hadrian ran away from his relatives and somehow found his way here," Lucius smirked, "It seems a lot happened while our son was here by himself, but I will tell you what I know. Evidently the Muggles did give Hadrian the potion to bind his powers and beat him severely, but Hadrian managed to get a hold of the pain relief and healing potions. He called for Dobby-you will remember the elf always liked Potter-who helped him escape. Dobby gave Hadrian a collar to turn him into his animagus form, shrank Hadrian's belongings, and brought him to the woods just beyond our wards, where Hadrian spent the night in a tree.
Once back in his room, Harry hurried to take a shower before dressing in his new robes. The robes were similar to the ones he wore to the Yule Ball in Fourth Year, but the color was a rich emerald green, and the cut clung to his upper body, accentuating the muscles he had gained from playing Quidditch. A black half-cloak with silver lining and warming charms and a pair of black dragonhide boots completed the outfit. Harry made sure his wand was secure, and then summoned Dobby.
“Then I can show Potter where my room is,” Malfoy added, “If Potter does not object, we can work on our holiday assignments together and perhaps talk some.”
“It will,” Draco interrupted, “All we have to do is focus, and The Ritual will do exactly what we want it to. I have all the materials we need-” Draco pulled a box out of his robes “-so all we have to do is decide who is going to take which position once we set up.”
“I am going to Hogwarts,” Tom admitted, “I will force Dumbledore to tell me where he took my son, and then I’ll kill the bastard. If I kill Dumbledore, all our problems are solved.”
Inside this hidden compartment, were the S&M magazines and the toys that Harry had managed to acquire so far. He was eager to play again tonight, as he had been too busy with schoolwork to try anything the past few days. Tonight, however, Harry had the time to enjoy his experimentation, and he already told Hermione and Ron that he was planning to sleep in the next day, so he wouldn’t have to worry about drawing suspicions if he missed breakfast in the morning.
"Oh?" Dumbledore arched his eyebrow, affecting polite interest, "And how would you improve these conditions?"
"You shall have to wait and ask Potter that question," Severus said, before pinning Draco with a sharp stare, "I have noticed that you seem to be unusually worried about him lately-is there something you would like to share with me Draco?"
"Get over it Pot-I mean Riddle," Draco said, almost lapsing back into the familiar insults now that they were outside, brooms in hand, "Why don't we play a Seeker's game? Winner gets to claim a forfeit."
“You should take a nap,” he says, “Because I have every intention of wearing you out again later-multiple times.”
“Now, Harry,” The Snow Queen began, “First, let me assure you that everything I said to you last night was the truth. You are welcome to stay in my home as long as you like, and I will make certain that you are safe. No one will be able to force you to return to your relatives if you do not wish to go. I will also make certain that you are protected while at school.”
“Love you,” I reply, and he gives me a bright smile, then his hand is reaching between us, long, thin fingers wrapping firmly around my cock. It takes only two strokes and then I am gone, screaming his name.
"Good," Tom said, with the air of someone who was not happy with being ignored for so long, "Now that that's taken care of, I want to introduce you to Salazar Slytherin's familiar. Just a warning-I have warned her not to harm any of you, but you need to avoid looking in her eyes." Tom began hissing and the shape of a large snake appeared, but the memory faded before they could see it clearly.
“Mother’s palace is in the Faerie Realm,” Draco replied, “And magic is different here. Mother’s kiss helps to balance your magic, otherwise you would get very sick, very fast. Mother will already be in bed, but…well, I have the same magic. I would let you wait until tomorrow, but I have heard stories of mortals falling asleep and never waking due to an imbalance in their magical core.”
"Ah, I can take care of that for you," Dumbledore sounded cheerful again, "I always come prepared, just in case something like this were to occur. Give me just a moment...now where did I put those...?" All was silent for a few minutes, except for the soft rustle of Dumbledore searching for whatever it was he needed, "Ah! Here we go!" There was the sound of clinking glass, and harry recognized it from his time spent in the hospital wing: Dumbledore was giving the Dursley's vials of potion. "Now, each one of these has a different purpose, and they are charmed to never be empty. This one will block his magic from reacting to anything; make sure he gets two drops of it twice a day. I am aware that he has been training physically this year as well, so this potion will cause him to become disoriented, while this one will cause him to lose control of his muscles. This potion will prevent him from being able to tell anyone the full truth of what happens here. And, finally, this potion will heal physical evidence of any beatings you must give Harry, while still letting him feel the pain he needs; this is just in case you have to send him outside or if unexpected visitors stop by." There was a thoughtful pause, then the sound of another bottle being set down. "I realize that you will still need the boy useful even with the punishment he will be given, so this potion will heal anything that is life-threatening, and I believe we have everything covered; do you have any concerns about this?"
"Okay then," George nodded, "Follow me." He led them through a door at the back of the living room which led to a more intimate room with work tables along the back wall and a few comfortable chairs arranged in the middle, "This is our planning room; you two are the only ones aside from Fred and I to see it, so no telling people what we have in here." He shot a look at Draco, "I'm trusting you because Harry said you're trustworthy, but if he turns out to be wrong..." He trailed off meaningfully, before grinning again, "You two want something to drink?" He gestured for Draco and Hadrian to sit down, and didn't fail to notice the way Draco took the lead, pulling the brunet to sit next to him on the small couch, if the smirk he shot the blond was anything to go by.
Hadrian remained unmoving for a handful of seconds as he fought to get his breath back, but the sound of shouting had him forcing himself to his feet. Hadrian didn’t chance a look behind him, but immediately began running away from the Burrow, and towards a wooded area beyond the Weasley property.
“Okay, I forgive you,” Hadrian said, leaning in to give the blond a chaste kiss, “Are you ready to go back down to your party now?”
"Of course," Draco said stiffly, still upset about being excluded from the Order, "Goodnight Mother, Father. Come along Hadrian." He grabbed Hadrian by the hand and started pulling him out of the room.
“I’ve been waiting all year for you to make up your mind,” Draco said when they finally parted, “Now that I have you, I’m not letting you go.”
“Okay, just follow my lead,” Draco said, “I’ll guide you, all you have to do is keep your eyes on my face and trust me.” Harry felt ridiculous being in such a position with his former rival, but at the same time he found that he enjoyed the closeness.
“Master Hadrian is not being moving,” Dobby said sternly, “Dragon magicks is being strong, and Master is needing resting. Dobby is having food ready when Master is waking up.”
"Not quite," Griphook replied, producing a bright orange quill, "You will use this phoenix-feather quill to sign your name-your true name-and then I will simply require a drop of blood next to your signature." He passed the book and the quill to Hadrian, who signed his name
"What?" Hadrian cried, outraged at Griphook’s words, "That's not fair! I've already had enough of keeping secrets from Dumbledore, and now you’re doing the same thing!"
“Turning Blaise’s eyes into leaves and the eyebrows into caterpillars was brilliant,” Draco agreed, “Although I suppose it is a good thing that Longbottom reversed the spell before Blaise’s eyebrows could eat his eyes. I’m sure Sev could have brewed a potion to restore them, but Blaise would probably never get over it.”
Draco, wisely, chose not to argue with his friend; Pansy was vicious when angry, and something had obviously already happened to her this morning. Upon entering the kitchen, he found Blaise already hard at work, whistling cheerfully.
How are you? I just wanted to let you know that everything will work out just fine; Lillian will come back to the right side, and Helena will see the truth eventually. I can't wait to meet your sister! I have told Neville to be ready to go, so we shall meet you at the Manor this evening once we receive your reply. Also, the Headmaster knows where you are and he was told that you claimed Sanctuary-it is a very good idea and may help you in the future.
"I will not," Draco said, then added, "I suppose I don't have room to complain, since you and the kids make me happy as well. Not a word, Potter, or you'll see just how much damage a dragon can do."
"No," Severus shook his head, "I know where he is, however the full moon is tonight so it would not be a good idea to bring him here; it shall simply have to wait until after the full moon."
“I never meant to come off sounding stuck up,” Draco frowned, “I was just acting the way my father taught me to; as for Weasley…I’ll admit I did insult him, but he insulted me first.”
Just before dawn, Harry returned to the workshop to wait for Santa’s return with everybody else. He briefly thought about going to the stables instead, so that he could be the first person Draco saw, but ultimately decided he’d rather be with everyone else. This way it would be less embarrassing if Draco didn’t respond to his new look.
“Probably,” Hadrian agreed, picking up the next letter; it was addressed to him and had never been opened.
“Hmm, I’ll hold you to that promise,” Draco said, tucking Harry’s head under his chin. Harry, who had woken up at dawn to make sure everything was ready for their guests, fell asleep after a few minutes of silence. Draco found himself thinking back over the past few days, and he had to admit that there was a certain charm to doing some things the Muggle way. He didn’t think he would want to do a fully Muggle Christmas again, but it might be nice to keep some of things they had done. He’d like for Teddy and Harry to make more Christmas decorations, and they could decorate a gingerbread village every year. Even decorating the tree without magic had been kind of fun, but Draco thought it would be easier to decorate a slightly smaller tree-maybe eight or nine feet instead of fifteen. Maybe next year they could even have two trees; they could decorate one with magic, and one without. Harry and Draco would be married by next Christmas, so maybe they could start their own traditions with Teddy…
“Thank you for inviting Luna and I to your home,” Neville concluded the polite greetings, and gave their hostess a crystal vase, which instantaneously filled with flowers when Narcissa took it.
"Hmmm, that's true," Draco said, "but this time it's just you and me-no distractions or bludgers or anything. Enough talk-let's go." Draco reached in his back pocket and pulled out a Snitch and both boys watched as it flew away, up into the clouds and out of sight before mounting their brooms. It wasn't until they were in the air that Hadrian notice Draco wasn't flying his normal Nimbus 2001.
“Kiss me?” Harry frowned, “I, er, I don’t think so. I kind of remember her kissing my forehead last night, but I don’t think she did today. Why?”
“We also need to make sure his true memories are returned as soon as possible,” Tom added, “Otherwise he will attempt to fight us.”
"Well, to fight against Dumbledore, of course," Hadrian's tone said that he thought it was obvious, "Not outright fighting him, like with hexes and such, but undermining his authority and uniting the school against him. In addition, we want to reach out to everyone who has been negatively affected by his meddling and show them what truly happened."
“Do not be afraid, child,” the woman said, her voice even more musical than the bells, “I mean you no harm. I was called here by your distress. Tell me, why are you alone in the woods on Christmas Eve?”
"Ooh! That was a total rejection Pansy!" Blaise said gleefully, "Looks like even a half-blood like Potter has more sense than to mess with you!"
"Of course she is," James smirked, "She is a Potter after all." The three old friends shared a smile, and then James became more solemn; "Cissa-can you tell us what your plans are now that you have your memories back?"
“That’s because Santa usually stops giving kids presents around the time they start school,” Rolf told him, “Most kids don’t talk about it, because it’s normal to us. It is weird that you never received anything from Santa.”
"Shall we say one o'clock?" Narcissa suggested, "That gives me plenty of time to finish shopping, and you boys will be able to explore for the next few hours. Just make sure you don't wander off alone; no one knows where Hadrian is, and we should keep it that way for the time being."
“Will you tell me about the Muggles?” Harry looked up from the book he had been reading, and found that Draco was watching him with a steady gaze, “I’d like to know what your life was like.” Harry examined those grey eyes for any sign of mockery, but found none. Still he hesitated; he didn’t like talking about his relatives to anyone, but Draco was his friend now…
“That is not an appropriate use of your forfeit,” Draco complained, “Fine, but I’ll get you back tomorrow night. Now, are you ready to go home?” He grinned slyly, “Or, we could break in the desk.”
"That was before you had me," Draco replied, "Now you have me to look after you. I'm not saying that I'll hold you back and prevent you from fighting your own battles, but if I can protect you then why shouldn't I? You forget, Hadrian, if you die then I die as well. I'd rather keep you safe, if it's all the same."
“I can’t believe you want to stand here and discuss Pansy’s love life when we have the house to ourselves for the first time in fifteen years,” Draco countered, stepping closer with a lascivious gleam in his eyes. “We never did get a chance to properly christen the house, what with all the kids running around. Shall we start in here?”
Draco chuckled, then slowly slid out, before slamming back in; he kept to this pace, loving the way the slow withdrawal made Harry whimper, while the hard slam drew a cry from the brunet’s lips. He tried different angles, enjoying the way the cries changed slightly each time, until he managed to find that spot that had Harry closing his eyes and throwing his head back with a scream. Having found the right angle, Draco increased the speed of his thrusts, making Harry writhe and scream beneath him. Draco felt his balls tightening, and reached down to wrap a hand around Harry’s erection, only to note with surprise that his lover had already beat him to it.
Draco felt the brunet tense in his arms and make a soft sound of distress, so he released Hadrian's hand and slid his arm around the other boy's waist to keep him from fleeing as he leaned down, closing the small distance between them and gently pressing their lips together. Hadrian remained tense in his arms for a moment until Draco slid his hand up to card through the dark locks as he nipped softly at the lips beneath his and Hadrian parted his lips with a soft gasp; Draco took advantage of the action to slip his tongue into the other boy's mouth, gently lapping at the warm cavern while Hadrian finally began to relax, melting into the embrace.
“I think I’m done here,” Luna said thoughtfully, conjuring a brilliantly colored dream catcher and sticking it above the window in the front of the store, then adding a sprig of mistletoe. “Rolf was with his grandfather today, and promised to bring me home a surprise. Mind the Nargles.”
“Everything is ready, Santa,” Harry replied, “The new sleigh with built-in time-turners was tested again today and works as it should, and the reindeer are ready to go. The gifts have been loaded into the sleigh, and there is a basket of food and Pepper-up potions in the front seat. The Naughty and Nice List is also in the sleigh.”
"You're so mean Hades," Draco pouted as he rose gracefully from the bed, "You're supposed to be nice to me on my birthday." Hadrian looked over his shoulder, ready to make a joke, but was stunned by what he saw.
"Calm down Wispy," the voice was saying, "Father is not here, as you well know, but I will take care of it; if need be the trespasser can rot in the dungeons until Mother gets home. Honestly, I have no idea why you didn't send him to the dungeons in the first place. Oh, stop punishing yourself; it gets tiring!" As the drawling voice got closer Harry could feel his muscles tensing; he knew that voice, and it was possibly worse than Voldemort and Dumbledore combined. "Ah!" There was a breathless exclamation, and Harry could only assume that the wizard had caught sight of him, "A black tiger; I thought those were myth-no one has ever been able to verify sightings."
"Oh, sorry Draco," Hadrian mumbled as he tried to pull away, frowning when the other boy wouldn't let him go, "Draco; let me go."
“Mother,” Draco nodded at her, before walking over to his closet and examining his robes for something suitable to wear, “Did you need something?”
"My Lord," Severus interrupted quickly, "Perhaps now would be the time to tell the boys what we discovered last night." The Dark Lord stared at him blankly for a moment, before nodding his agreement.
“I did,” Hadrian confirmed, pushing at Draco’s chest until the blond sat up, allowing him to do the same, “It’s still strange to think that I have a father, but it’s a good kind of strange. We talked a lot, and he told me some of the things he remembered about my mom. I keep wondering if we should tell him that we are able to see Aracely…”
His second day in the palace, Narcissa had given Harry a potion, informing him that it would heal all of his injuries. He spent the next 24 hours unconscious, but when he awoke he could see without his glasses, and the only mar on his skin was the scar on his forehead.
"It's not out of guilt," Hadrian protested, "and I definitely don't pity you! I just-I don't know what to think Dray; everything has changed so much in the past two days..." Draco didn't respond, so Hadrian decided to try another tactic, "What happened to your Slytherin cunning? I admit that I don't feel ready for a...relationship and that I wouldn't even be thinking about it if it weren't for the fact that you're a Veela-I don't want to lose my best friend after all-" Hadrian saw a small smirk on Draco's lips before the blond replaced it with a scowl, but he took this as encouragement and continued; "but shouldn't you be using it to get what you want? I seem to remember the Sorting Hat in first year saying that Slytherin's were "cunning folk" who "used any means to achieve their ends". It's not like you to give up so easily."
"This is impressive," Draco said as they came to a stop outside of the twins' shop; it was a three story building with a sign reading 'Weasley's Wizarding Wheeze's' in bright magenta letter's directly above the door. Some of the windows showcased items that the twins had invented, while others had signs such as the one reading; "Why Are You Worrying About You-Know-Who? You Should Be Worrying About U-No-Poo-The Constipation Sensation That's Gripping The Nation!"*
Once that was taken care of, Severus took out his notes on Horcruxes; there were very few written works about them, and all the information was spread out so that it was hard to gather it in one place, however Severus had an extensive book collection and owned the only book completely dedicated to the evil objects, which was part of a series dedicated to obscure and un-tried magic-oddly enough, the series was authored by Mathias Gryffindor and his wife, Lorena Ravenclaw-Gryffindor. (When Severus had first received the series as a gift from Lucius several years ago, he had discovered that Mathias was Godric Gryffindor's grandson, and Lorena was Rowena Ravenclaw's grand-niece; Mathias had been disowned by his family for his foray into the dark arts, but-as the Ravenclaw family valued knowledge above all else-they were taken in by Lorena's family until they were able to support themselves.)
Hello again! Here is the latest update! Sorry it has been so long, but things are finally calming down some in RL; if all goes well I should have the next update ready in a week or two at the most. Thank you for all the reviews, and I hope you enjoy!
"Very well," he agreed, "I will spare your lives, if you agree to leave and have your memories altered."
"How can you accuse us of using you?" Ginny demanded, looking hurt, "He's a Death Eater Harry! He's only pretending to help you so that he can turn you over to Voldemort! Even if Dumbledore was doing as you said, you still should have come to us for help; why don't you trust us Harry?" Hadrian focused on Ginny, ignoring the other two for a moment, and saw hurt in her brown eyes.
"Two hours just to get that horrible stuff out of his system," the blond scowled shaking his head, "I can't believe Dumbledore would do this to a student-especially Potter! I always thought Potter was his precious Golden Boy…why would he do this?"
"Not so fast," Hadrian spun around to see Draco leaning nonchalantly against the doorframe, watching him with silver eyes; his Veela features had begun to recede so that only the long canines and the molten silver eyes remained, but Hadrian could still sense Draco's power swirling around the room.
“Report, Number One,” Santa commanded, and Harry rolled his eyes; he may have decided to play Santa, but Draco Malfoy was still as arrogant as ever.
Draco summoned the enchanted camera and set it to taking pictures again, and then summoned a jar of lube. He crawled between his lover’s legs and began working his fingers inside Harry’s tight hole, slowly loosening him up. Harry moaned and gasped into his gag, and Draco quickly reached for his wand, vanishing the gag so he could hear the sound his
“An hour or so ago, Hadrian and Dobby appeared in the room,” Lucius replied, “Hadrian looked confused, and then he vanished seconds later. We believe Dobby brought him here, and then a portkey took him away. We have been casting tracking spells ever since they vanished, but nothing has worked.”
"Be nice Draco," Hadrian glared at him, "Fred and George are my friends, and you have no reason to be an ass to them; we want their help, remember?" Draco scowled but nodded, mumbling;
"Within a few years of her disownment, Andromeda had thrown her support behind Dumbledore, and then tried to convince Bellatrix and I to break our own engagements. When we refused, she declared herself to have no sisters." Narcissa smiled sadly, "I never even had the chance to meet my niece, although I have heard that she is an accomplished Auror."
“There are many others who accepted the role of Santa Clause throughout the ages,” Draco said, “I am just the latest in a long line, and I will not be the last. Now, let me give you proof that I am Santa, then I will answer your questions.” Draco reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, red velvet bag, which soon expanded. The blond reached inside, pulling out several gifts.
Harry scowled at Malfoy’s back as the blond sauntered out of the common room-after trapping him into helping Justin and Michael with their Defense assignments. The Slytherin had done it on purpose, Harry was sure; he just didn’t know why. Was it just Malfoy’s way of being a prat and continuing their rivalry? Harry decided he would corner the blond for a talk as soon as possible, and see about putting it all behind them; he was finally rid of Voldemort, and the last thing he wanted was for Draco to continue causing problems for him at school.
"Where is Father?" Draco asked, "And what are you looking at?" He took a seat next to Severus, motioning for Hadrian to sit next to him.
"Elena…" He murmured, and a small smile appeared on his face for just a moment as his eyes flashed brown, "Dark hair, with red highlights and the most beautiful eyes…green eyes. I remember a sweet voice, singing, and laughter…" The Dark Lord’s eyes closed for a moment as if in pain; when he opened them again they had returned to their previous crimson and he regarded Severus coldly, "Why do you mention Elena? She betrayed me; her death was easier than she deserved."
"Morning Hades," Draco murmured, carding his fingers through Hadrian's hair, "Has the house elf come yet?" Hadrian briefly closed his eyes, enjoying the sensation, before responding.
“Don't look at me,” Neville held his hands up when Hadrian glanced at him, “You understand her better than anyone else does, so if you don't know what she's up to then I have no chance of guessing.” The two friends watched as Draco gave a scathing reply to something Luna had said, resulting in the fey girl tossing her head back to laugh, before snuggling into Draco's side. Draco looked panicked for a moment, then he glanced over his shoulder at Hadrian; his expression slowly became a smug smirk, and he wrapped his arm around Lunas waist, then leaned down to whisper something in her ear.
"I guess you want me to start it off again?" Hadrian asked with a sigh, "I'm getting really tired of having to tell the story over and over again."
"Really?" Hadrian's eyes shone with excitement, "That could be really cool. You know, I never even recognize when I'm speaking or reading Parseltongue; maybe I should study the book with you."
Draco and Harry spent the whole day making preparations for Christmas. Harry stayed in the kitchen watching over his food most of the day, while Draco roamed the house putting up the rest of the decorations-garland on the banisters and around the windows in the main rooms, and wreaths on all the exterior doors. Then, Draco settled down in the family room with presents, wrapping paper, scissors, boxes, tape, bows, and tissue paper. It took him a few hours, with Harry helping while he waited to switch out trays in the oven, but all the presents were wrapped by suppertime. Draco admitted that his presents weren’t the most aesthetically pleasing- he used a lot of tape, bows, and scraps of paper to make sure the gift wasn’t visible- but at least they were all finished. He decided it didn’t really matter how the paper looked anyway, as it was just going to be ripped off and thrown away in a few days.
“I was accompanying Narcissa, Potter and Draco to the ministry,” Severus began, “Narcissa had an appointment, and Lucius had asked me to go along with them; since Draco offered Potter sanctuary, there are some Death Eater families who are not too happy with the Malfoy’s at this moment although, as far as I know, the Dark Lord remains unaware of Potter’s presence at the manor.” Dumbledore nodded, and Severus continued; “As we were leaving the ministry, someone abducted Potter. None of us saw who took him; I offered to search the ministry while Narcissa took Draco home, but I came straight here as soon as I could.”
"Mmm, maybe," Hadrian replied, "If nothing else we can always have lunch outside. Is Tom coming by today? I was hoping we could talk; we haven't had much of a chance since I got here."
"Calm down," Draco said soothingly, moving his arm down so that he could rub circles on the brunets back, "Just calm down and breathe. We can-"
He proceeded to tell them everything that had occurred that night, from being force-fed a potion to getting beat by his uncle to being used as Dudley’s personal punching bag; he explained that Dobby had given him the collar and how he awoke in a tree earlier that day. "…so that's why I ran away and how I came to be wearing a collar that obviously ties me to Malfoy here."
“Hmm, I think I can live with that,” Draco returned the grin, before leaning down to kiss his lover, “Now, it isn’t quite midnight yet, which means you still have a few hours left to serve me. You can start by drawing me a bath and arranging a wine tray, followed, I think, by a massage.” Harry rolled his eyes, and started to get up, but Draco stopped him with a hand on his arm. He pulled Harry back down into a kiss, and relaxed against the pillows as the brunet melted into him. Draco lost himself in the press of lips for a minute, then gently but firmly pushed Harry away, pressing one last chaste kiss on his lips.
“An excellent idea,” Draco agreed; before Harry could reply, Draco suddenly moved so that he was kneeling over Harry and then pressed their lips together, using one hand at the nape of Harry’s neck to prevent the brunet from moving.
Harry and Draco remain at the festival for several hours, during which Harry tries his best not to let the bells and the knowledge of his lack of clothing distract him. After shopping, with the bells jingling incessantly, Harry, Draco, Ron, and Hermione have lunch before walking to the other side of the festival area where the ice rink is set up. Ice skating is torture as the bells jingle and the ropes rub against his sensitive skin; Harry knows he will have marks from the rope burn later, and the knowledge just increases his anticipation. Then, there is the anal plug that Draco sets to vibrating at random moments; once, while they are leaning against the rail to supposedly catch their breath, Draco sets it to vibrating for several minutes, until Harry is just about ready to strip and demand Draco fuck him right there over the railing.
"Whatever you say," Draco smirked, "Why don't you go take a shower; it's right through that door there." He nodded at the ensuite, adding, "And you can borrow some of my clothes for now too; if the rags you're wearing now are any indication we need to take you out shopping sooner rather than later."
It seemed like an eternity that the blows came down, one after the other, ripping his clothes to shreds and leaving his back a raw, bloody mess, but eventually they slowed and then stopped, and Harry could hear his uncle's ragged breathing and his own pitiful whimpers, his throat having gone raw from screaming long ago.
"Take all the fun out of it why don't you?" Blaise said teasingly, and then he and Theo made a wizard's promise to keep the information secret.
“Hmm,” Hadrian hummed in agreement, “Theo has new respect for Luna now; I saw the shock on his face. And after that everyone got along alright.” Draco nodded his agreement, and then noticed that Hadrian was yawning.
"That's understandable," Neville nodded, "I'll miss you being there though.” There was a pause in conversation, and Hadrian once again noticed Draco giving Luna a death glare. Thinking back, he realized Draco had been glaring ever since Luna sat on Hadrian's lap; Neville must-have noticed the same thing, because he asked;
“I’d say it’s a draw,” Parkinson shrugged, “So either no one won, or you each won half a day, however you want to do it. Come on, Lovegood; let’s let these to get back to making
"Don't blame them Dray," Hadrian said, "I told you I'm not that easy to convince. So hey; do one of you guys want to come shopping with me really quick?"
“About eight,” Draco replied, “Breakfast is in the sitting room; I didn’t want to start without you because it could disrupt the stasis charms.”
"Ah, Mr. Riddle," Hadrian was startled when Griphook addressed him as soon as he entered the bank, and looked around quickly to see if anyone had heard the goblin; "Not to worry," Griphook assured him, "There is no one here to overhear us. Your father owled me this morning, so I have been expecting you; if you would all follow me." Without waiting for a response, Griphook went down a small side corridor, leaving the boys and Narcissa to follow. The goblin led them to a rich-looking office (the furniture was made of polished ebony with gold accents and the chairs were richly upholstered in dark blue velvet while the bookshelves held numerous expensive-looking objects made of gold and silver and sparkling with gems) and gestured for them to take seats across from him.
"I thought that you were handling the horcruxes," Hadrian frowned, "You said you didn't want us going near them because they were such dark magic."
"We are glad you came," Narcissa smiled, "Why don't you set Neville down and let him play with the others? And Lily, you can put Lillian in the playpen as well."
"We will let the Malfoy's keep their spawn," Dumbledore said, "We just need to alter their memories; young Neville can also stay with his parents, but we will give the Riddle boy to the Potter's so that he can be raised to despise the Dark Arts, and Elena and her daughter will be disposed of; it should offer a big enough shock so that we have an advantage over Tom." Dumbledore had his back to his unconscious enemies, so he didn't notice a number of them stirring; Tom and Elena, Narcissa and Lucius, Bellatrix, and Frank and Alice Longbottom seemed to have suffered less from the spell, and they shared a look, nodding briefly before acting.
stood up and walked around the desk, then straddled Harry’s lap to give him a passionate kiss which was eagerly returned.
“Naughty, complaining like that,” Draco chastises, using his arm around Harry’s waist to keep the brunet upright and moving forward as the vibrator continues to buzz, “Do you need me to take you into the loo and spank you?”
Harry and Draco, after eating breakfast, shared a not-so-quick shower, during which they took the time to learn each other’s bodies at a more leisurely pace. After they were done, they set out to explore their new estate, and promptly got into an argument which escalated to a duel. The duel quickly devolved into a physical fight when Harry hexed Draco’s hair pink, and that quickly turned into Harry being bent over the nearest piece of furniture (a counter in the kitchen) and receiving a fast, hard shag.
“They usually do,” Sirius confirmed, “But the really powerful ones will come into their Inheritance at fifteen.”
"Okay; what do you want as your forfeit?" he asked suspiciously, and Draco grinned-this did not ease Hadrian's mind.
Ten minutes into the session, Harry’s feet began to hurt. He knew that if he took the shoes off he likely wouldn’t be able to get them back on, so he lifted his right foot off the ground to give it a rest. Unfortunately, he was only able to lift it a few inches, and this pulled on the chain connected to his ankle cuff, providing a completely different type of discomfort. Still, Harry was determined not to give in this soon, so he spent the next ten minutes alternating legs as he attempted to relieve the pain.
"I could arrange for you to see them," Draco said suddenly, "At least, I think I can, unless Mother and Father gave the house elves specific orders against removing the vials. Tillie!" There was a small pop, and then the house elf appeared, bowing.
"Ah, Lucius, it's good to see you," Severus said, as he closed his notebook, "You’re looking rather worse for the wear.”
"How horrible," Lucius said, his tone completely sincere and nothing like what one would expect from Lucius Malfoy, "I can't imagine what it must have been like for you, to be raised among Muggles; tell me, are they truly as barbaric as Father says?"
“In here,” Draco called, and Harry noticed that the bedroom door wasn’t closed all the way. Draco had never invited Harry into his bedroom before, so he was careful when he pushed the door open. There was an alcove across from the door, with a loveseat facing the floor-to-ceiling windows. Draco was standing in the alcove with his back to the door, looking down at the grounds as the sun slowly rose higher in the sky.
"Please My Lord; I meant no disrespect," she simpered, "I was simply trying to assist you; you have said many times that you wanted the Potter boy out of the way-"
“I would always choose you,” Draco said firmly, “Even before I knew who you were, when we first met at Madam Malkin’s, I wanted to impress you; you were just so…different from everyone I’d ever met, innocent and nice…Of course, I completely bolloxed it up, but they say it’s the thought the counts right?” Hadrian laughed softly and Draco smiled down at him, “Don’t ever think that I only want you because I am a Veela; I was attracted to you long before my instincts started to kick in-do you know I desperately wanted to steal a dance with you at the Yule Ball?”
“Augusta wants to view the memories,” Narcissa smiled at Lily, “I believe I shall invite her over for tea; after she views the memories would you like to speak with her?” She pulled out a sheet of parchment and wrote a short note, sealing it and then placing it in the silver tray for the house elves to deliver.
"Whatever you like Hades," Draco said agreeably, "We need to really get started on our summer work tomorrow as well, and we should look at that journal. I wish we could get a hold of Slytherin's books…"
"I wonder what your dad wants," Hadrian mused as he and Draco walked towards Lucius study on the first floor, "and why didn't he say anything at supper?" It was a few days after Augusta Longbottom had been informed of the truth (Lucius and Tom had been surprised to find that Narcissa had won her over so quickly) and Hadrian and Draco had been in their rooms studying-Hadrian studying Mathias' journal and Draco the Parseltongue book Tom had given him for his birthday-when Tippy had appeared to say that Lucius had requested their presence.
“Fine,” Draco sighed, reluctantly getting off the bed, “There won’t be any relaxing with the two of you around, I see.”
When Harry awoke the next morning, he was disoriented for a moment, not recognizing the green-and-blue room he was in. He found his glasses on the nightstand and then his memories of the previous evening came rushing back when he noticed the blond sitting in the window seat, staring outside. No, Harry realized after a moment, Malfoy-Draco-was staring at him, using the window as a mirror. Harry flushed as he remembered the way Draco had teased him the night before, but he knew the blond was just joking around; Draco was the most-lusted-after guy in school, and Harry just couldn’t see the blond actually wanting to be with him. Draco would bond to him if he had to, because of the ritual, but Harry was determined to save the blond from making that sacrifice. For now, though, he needed to make the blond stop staring at him.
"Don't worry; there's no way I would be a Hufflepuff," Harry assured him with a wry smile, "I already know where the Hat will place me; I should have let it do as it wanted in first year."
Before he could blink, Harry found himself standing out in the hallway and staring at the closed door to Pansy’s office. Shrugging, Harry made his way to his office; Draco wouldn’t be back for several hours, so Harry figured he may as well get started on ideas for the new year.
“Nothing,” Harry shrugged, then laughed, “Everything. I was just thinking about our family, and how we ended up here. I was remembering when we first met, and everything we went through during school-all the obstacles we faced. That first day of school, during the Sorting Ceremony, I was so terrified of being put in Slytherin that I begged the Hat to put me somewhere else.”
"Oh, I shall send a house elf up to Draco's room around six so we can have breakfast before we go," Narcissa said, "Draco can wake you after he gets ready to go; you boys should head upstairs since we have an early morning."
“Perhaps tomorrow,” Draco said, taking Hadrian’s hand in his own, “Hades and I were planning to start on the translation today anyway.”
"No Tom, don't interrupt," Narcissa placed a hand on Tom's arm as he moved towards the boys, no doubt intent on separating them.
Finally, Santa appeared at the top of the stairs leading down into the workshop, and Harry stopped to stare at him along with everyone else.
Somehow, the discussion of Draco’s new wand led to a discussion about career choices and, before he knew it, Draco was agreeing to have dinner with Harry. What started as friendship quickly evolved into a romantic relationship. A year after getting his new wand, Draco moved into Hallow Hall, Harry’s home on the Peverell Estate. Then, earlier this year, Draco had, for once, been the courageous one, and asked Harry to marry him. Harry had, thankfully, said yes, and they planned to hold the ceremony-open to friends and family only-the following summer.
"They might have helped me," Hadrian conceded, "but they also would have gone straight to Dumbledore, and he would have sent me back to the Dursley's. I couldn't risk being sent back there; next time I might not survive."
“He might do that for a few weeks,” Draco concedes “I’m sure he knows better than to separate us like that for too long-after all, he wouldn’t want us to scare the little runts. Besides, it’s the last day before the winter holidays; he should have known better than to insist on a full day of classes.”
“So, Astoria then,” Harry nodded, unbuttoning his shirt, “I can’t imagine you’ll be able to avoid her for too long. I’m guessing, since Daphne probably has this June, you’ll be married by the following summer?”
"George is very good at haggling," Fred replied, as he watched Draco turn the dragon pieces over in his hands, "I thought you might like those; the choker has charms built into it to repel minor hexes, and the opals and moonstones can actually store magic. You can set it up to release a spell with just one word; we wrote down some instructions on how to use it. Also, the dragon pendant works as a portkey-you can set it to be activated with a certain word and it will take the wearer to a pre-designated place-also, we tweaked it a bit so that if the wearer is in danger and unable to speak the word the portkey will activate automatically and take them to the closest safe place. If Har-I mean, Hadrian, doesn't like the choker design we can put the pendant on a leather cord instead, and we have a few loose gemstones we can thread with it to hold some extra spells. The cuffs just have a basic shield charm and locator spell on them, but we can add more protections if needed." Fred spent several minutes showing Draco the rest of the pieces and explaining the different protections on them, but the blond had already made up his mind.
"What are you talking about?" Draco demanded, "I can't even read this page; this is where they start writing in that strange language Sev was talking about."
Draco walked back over to Harry and sat on the edge of the bed; he levitated Potter and turned him onto his back, then helped the unconscious boy to swallow the two potions by using a mild compulsion charm. Draco lightly placed his wand against Potter’s side and slowly chanting a healing spell to fix the boys broken ribs. Once he was done he carefully ran his hand down Potter’s side, and smiled in satisfaction-the ribs were no longer broken.
"You have some very high-quality items," Draco mused as he looked through the assortment, "How did you manage to acquire them?" He picked up a choker that had a small silver dragon charm hanging from it and examined it closely; it was made of dark green leather set with numerous black opals, and the dragon had moonstones set as eyes. Glancing back down, he noticed more accessories that matched the choker.
"Ah, Severus my boy! Come in!" Dumbledore called, as Severus stepped off the moving staircase and onto the landing in front of the headmaster’s door, "I'm so glad you could make it; tell me, are you alright?"
“Liar,” Draco accused as he entered Hadrian’s room and shut the door behind him, “I could sense you were awake as well.” Draco climbed into the bed and lay down facing Hadrian, then immediately pulled the brunet into his arms. The blond gave a soft, happy sigh and nuzzled the back of Hadrian’s neck. “This is much better,” Draco murmured. Hadrian hummed his agreement, suddenly feeling tired again. Within moments, both boys were fast asleep.
“I have asked the house elves to set up tea in the garden,” Narcissa replied, “Once we sit down I will be happy to explain everything, as well as provide you with proof to back up my words.” She turned her attention to the four teenage guests and smiled, “It is good to see you again, Blaise and Theodore. Luna and Neville-please be welcome in my home.”
“Thank you, Pansy,” Draco smiled up at his friend, then sighed and dropped the parchment on his desk, “He probably won’t even show.”
The two continued talking through supper, which was brought to them by a Snow Imp when they didn’t appear in the dining room. Malfoy had a lot of questions, however, and they lost track of time. It seemed Malfoy had some doubts before, but he hadn’t thought he could choose a different path than his father. Now that Harry was showing him a different path, Malfoy appeared to be seriously considering his options.
"Well, Hadrian feels that the headmaster deserves to suffer before he is granted release in death," Severus replied, "and our master, Tom, seems to agree with him whole-heartedly. We have a long way to go before we take on Dumbledore however; reversing the damage caused when Tom was forced to create those Horcruxes should be our number one priority."
“Only by you,” Harry said, and Draco flicked his nose in retaliation, making Harry pout, “I don’t think I can fall asleep.”
"Absolutely not," Draco refused, "This may be for Hadrian, however I am giving it to him therefore I shall pay for it. So, how much?"
When the stomach-turning feelings passed, Santa lifted his head, pink lips upturned in a smirk as grey eyes flashed.
“Fuck,” Harry swore, his hips stuttering before he began thrusting more frantically, crying out his lover’s name as his orgasm was pulled from him. Draco followed soon after, spilling his release over the green corset before collapsing on top of his lover. He reached for his wand and vanished the ties and the dildo, and Harry groaned as he lowered his arms to wrap around Draco.
"Draco," Hadrian said softly, moving to stand in front of him; Draco turned his head in the other direction and crossed his arms as he scowled; "Come on Dray-don't be mad at me," Hadrian pleaded, "I-I was just surprised when you said that; I never even thought I liked boys until yesterday, and then you tell me that I'm destined to be your mate? Can you blame me for looking for a way out?"
Santa looked nothing like the modern depictions of the mythic being; he was not fat, he did not wear a red suit, he was not old, and he wasn’t jolly either-smug, was a better description. Santa was tall, with pale skin and blue-grey eyes. His hair was the color of moonlight, and he had a neatly trimmed beard. He wore a pale blue tunic over white trousers with white dragonhide boots and a white belt. The tunic was sleeveless, revealing toned arms, and Santa’s lips were curved in a smirk as he surveyed the workshop.
"We'll be safe Narcissa," Hadrian assured her, "We're just going to walk around a bit and I want to drop in on Fred and George Weasley-as long as the rest of their family isn't there."
“Sorry, Harry,” Draco said, opening his eyes to see green orbs filled with worry, “I had better go straighten this out. Jack Frost in a stop can cause a lot of damage.”
“It will scar though,” Narcissa said, “If you continue to have detentions with Madame Umbridge. Draco, darling, when you return to school you are to stop assisting that woman. You will do the minimum needed to keep her from targeting you, but I do not want you getting any of the other students in trouble with her. Get the other Slytherins on your side as well.”
"Torturing-?" Hadrian questioned and then shook his head, "Can't we just not think about them anymore? I really just want to forget I ever lived with them, especially now that I never have to go back."
“Well, after hearing about the close call the previous Santa had, you said you wanted to start working to fulfill this particular clause early,” Curtis replied.
"Thank you," Hadrian said quietly, turning around and relaxing in Draco's arms. He glared at Hermione for a minute, then sighed. "Look, 'Mione, I can't prove anything today, but I do have proof about what happened. In a few days, or maybe a week, Luna is going to invite you and Ginny to spend the weekend with her; I'll be able to show you proof and tell you the rest of it then, okay?"
“Come on Dray; help me go through this stuff." Hadrian opened the trunk and first set aside the box he had stolen from his uncle's study, intending to go through it later, and then he pulled out his school books from the previous year, as well as his summer assignments; Draco immediately banished the books to a bookcase and the assignments to Hadrian’s desk, then looked on in disgust as Hadrian pulled out his clothes-Dudley's old hand-me-downs.
Within moments they were off, and that night was the first of many Harry would spend in his new home, with his new family.
"If she's as smart as you say she won't stop being your friend just because she's in a different house," Lucius placated the younger boy, "In fact, she will probably need you more than ever. Oh, by the way Severus, this is my friend Tom Riddle; Tom, this is Severus Snape-we've been friends since we were little."
"You had better not be that insane or I swear I will hex you," Hadrian threatened Draco, "There's no way I can stand to have you hovering over me day in and day out for a whole month."
“From what I understand, you dumped him,” Ginny said, “He tried to talk to you about Astoria, and you just assumed-”
"Nonsense," Narcissa interrupted, "And call me Narcissa, or Cissa. Draco Lucius Malfoy; I thought I told you to stop teasing and let him up." She turned a glare on her son, who pouted but released Hadrian none-the-less. "Good; now get dressed and meet us outside; and Draco? Don't tease Hadrian so much."
“We discussed it already,” Harry said, “We both wish we were older, but we decided that we’re willing to do whatever it takes to make a relationship between us work.”
“Yes,” Lily confirmed, “We promised that we would let him know as soon as anything changed over here, so James went to speak to him. Not everything is going well, and so you will likely have at least one new guest arrive in the next couple of weeks. You have a letter Cissa.” Narcissa looked down at her desk and saw that there was indeed a letter resting on the silver tray; when she picked it up she saw that it was from Augusta Longbottom.
"Give it a few minutes before you try to speak," Severus instructed him, "I just want to run an additional diagnostic spell to make sure there are no other injuries." Hadrian rolled his eyes and stuck his tongue out again. "Do that one more time and I will cut out your tongue to use in my potions," Severus threatened, and Hadrian immediately pulled his tongue back in his mouth and proceeded to pout.
"Oh, well, I actually just meant am I staying in your house," Hadrian corrected, fighting a blush, "I wasn't trying to make you share your room with me."
“I is not having proof,” Dobby shook his head, “Master Hadrian might be having proof in Master Hadrian’s pocket.” Harry frowned, but searched through his pockets. He found a rolled up scroll, tied with a blue ribbon in his left pocket, and he unrolled it. Upon reading the scroll, he saw that it was confirmation of his status as Draco’s Mate, as well as a record of Draco granting him Sanctuary, and the ministry acknowledging Narcissa Malfoy as his magical guardian.
"Well, you know how our parents had the Order of the Black Rose?" Draco continued after the twins nodded, "They intend to start it up again, however they refuse to allow us to be part of it, so we decided to start our own group to fight against Dumbledore."
"You'll get used to it," Draco said nonchalantly, propelling the brunet towards the bathroom and handing him a bundle of clothes that he had summoned, "I doubt we’ll have time to go out today, however we might be able to go shopping tomorrow. Then you can buy me a birthday present; I turn sixteen the day after tomorrow." Hadrian rolled his eyes as he accepted the clothes; he turned toward the bathroom, only to stop as a thought occurred to him.
"Stop being melodramatic," Severus snapped, "I have no intention of turning him over to the Dark Lord-I will at some point have to alert him to Potter's presence, however it is not something to be worried about at the moment. First, I need to find out what potions Potter has taken. Did he have his trunk with him?"
“Come along now, Harry dear,” Narcissa held out her hand, “Draco will be wondering what has taken so long.” Harry hesitantly placed his hand in hers, and allowed Narcissa to pull him into a hug before saying; “Hold tight, Harry.” Harry closed his eyes as the world went dark and he felt as if his body was being sucked through a straw; it was over in moments, and then Harry found himself standing in the entryway of a very large house.
"Why thank you, O Chosen One," one of the twins-wearing bright magenta robes that matched the sign outside-walked in and gave Harry an exaggerated bow, "You're not so bad yourself."
“And what do you expect me to do in the meantime? Sit around and wait patiently for someone to find my son, when he could be getting abused again as we speak?” Tom’s voice was frustrated, but some of the blind rage had drained away; Severus’ potion really did restore his sanity, and sometimes forced him to see sense even when he would rather act than plot.
“Of course not,” the Snow Queen agreed, “I never meant to imply that you did. No, I was referring to the way you have been betrayed by those who are supposed to care for you. The headmaster turns a blind eye to your suffering, which was caused by professors in your employ. You wish to see your godfather, but are uncertain of your friends’ welcome, and do not wish to cause any problems during the holiday. You have never considered your relative’s house a home, and have no true desire to return there. I can provide you with a home for the remainder of the holiday, at least, and you would be welcome to return at any time. In return, I only ask that you attempt to befriend my son; he is in danger of going down a dark path, chosen for him by his father, and I fear he will soon be lost. He has no true companions his age, and thus does not see that he has a decision in the path he takes. Will you make this bargain with me, Harry? I will provide you with a home, and you will try to help my son?”
“Well,” Harry bit his bottom lip, looking down at his lap before glancing up to meet Draco’s eyes, “I suppose…a couple of years isn’t too bad; not when I thought we were over for good. God, Draco! I thought that-”
"If by "something to drink" you mean water or another beverage that is not part of your joke products and will not cause any side-effects, then yes," Hadrian replied with a grin, causing George to pout.
“I’m surprised you didn’t go,” Harry replied, “Not like you’re under any obligation to have supper with me. You can go now if you like; I’m sure you can catch them having coffee.”
"Where is you be getting that?" Wispy demanded, and Harry realized she was pointing at the collar he wore, "That is not belonging to you, no it is not! You is a bad wizard, stealing Master's things and trying to kill his pets! Well, Wispy is telling on you she is! Wispy is getting Master to take care of you, bad wizard!" With a pop Wispy was gone, and Harry began to panic, realizing that he was now at the mercy of an unknown wizard who could potentially be a Death Eater, or even a Dumbledore supporter. He fretted uselessly for a few long moments before he heard a familiar drawling voice;
“This!” Harry indicated the book, “The book is full of runes, and whole pages are in Latin-I can’t even read half of it!”
“Wispy,” Narcissa called, and the house elf appeared with the pensieve, having been given her orders prior to Augusta’s arrival. Narcissa accepted the pensieve and placed it in front of her guest, not even noticing the disappearance of her house elf. “The memories will take some time for you to view; I would offer to join you, however I cannot bear to watch them again.” Augusta nodded her understanding and pushed her teacup away, and then entered the pensieve without any hesitation. Narcissa pulled the book Theo gave her-it was a rare book on creating flower hybrids-out of the folds of her robe and settled in to read until Augusta was finished with the memories.
"Don't look so gloomy Severus," Lucius said, "That's the girl you told me about over the summer, isn't it?"
"There's so much to do," Narcissa murmured before shaking her head softly, "I am going to wake the boys; shall we meet you on the veranda? It's a lovely day and I think Hadrian would enjoy sitting outside while we talk and have tea."
“Having fun?” Hadrian asked as he stood next to Draco, who was alternating between scowling at the board and glaring at Luna.
“I want you in me, now,” Harry demanded, spreading his legs wider; Draco wasted no time in penetrating his husband, eagerly sinking into the willing body below him. Once he was fully sheathed, Draco paused, leaning forward to capture Harry’s lips in a passionate kiss. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck to hold him in place as he lost himself to the mouth that was devouring him. His last clear thought before he succumbed to the lust, was that he was the luckiest man in the world, and he spared a quick thought to thank whichever deity had gifted him with such a loving husband and four amazing kids. Then, Draco moved, and Harry lost himself to the pleasure of being with his husband.
“It was decided to move you to the attic,” Dumbledore replied, “Your aunt and uncle agreed to let me use magic to turn the attic into a small apartment so that you do not have to go downstairs, and I was able to ward your apartment separately. The whole house is under a special form of Fidelius, which hides it from Witches and Wizards, but allows Muggles to enter. The attic, however, is warded so that no one may enter without my permission. You will be safe here until I am able to move you to the Burrow later this summer.”
"She is being raised by the Weasley's," Narcissa replied, "They spoil her, as she is their only daughter, but Hadrian said she does not truly fit in with the family; she is a bit more wild than Molly would like."
"Well, that's definitely better," he murmured, walking to the bathroom to wash his hands, "Who would have ever thought I would be looking after an injured Harry Potter?" As he washed his hands, Draco thought back to his summer reading as he tried to recall the incantation to cast a diagnostic spell; he needed to see if anything else was wrong with Potter so he could finish healing the boy-the decision about what to do with Potter once he was fully healed would have to wait.
"And who said I'm giving up?" Draco demanded, finally turning to face Hadrian; he held out his hand and Hadrian took it, then gave a little "eep!" of surprise when Draco yanked him, causing him to fall into the blonde's lap, "Maybe I was just using your guilt to get what I want." Draco smirked as the brunet glared at him and tried to get back up, "No; after hurting my feelings I think I need a cuddle to feel better." He helped Hadrian get into a more comfortable position and then wrapped his arms snuggly around the brunet's waist, resting his chin on Hadrian's shoulder.
"I thought I told you not to shed on the furniture?" the drawling voice woke him up and he lazily opened one eye to look at Malfoy before closing it again and tuning his head to the side, flicking his tail once in an obvious dismissal, "Get off my bed Potter." Draco poked him in the side and Harry started to swipe a paw at him, but stopped himself as he remembered the pain from earlier and instead sat up and fixed Malfoy with an intense stare. "I know I am attractive Potter, but you don't have to stare.” Harry snorted in disbelief; Malfoy thought Harry found him attractive?! Not a chance! “Now, kindly get off of my bed and I will return you to your human form." Upon hearing that Harry leapt off the bed, landing at Draco's feet; the blonde scowled at him and reached out to place a hand on the collar, giving Harry a warning, "This collar binds you to me in human form as well, so please remember that and try not to attack me." Holding his wand in the other hand he touched it to the collar as well and closed his eyes, his lips moving in a silent spell. Harry felt that familiar tingling again and mentally braced himself for the pain that was sure to follow; he was therefore pleasantly surprised when, instead of pain, he simply found himself back in his human body, kneeling on soft carpeting with Malfoy's cool fingers touching his neck under the collar. Harry opened his eyes only to find Malfoy gazing down at him, a small smirk on his face.
“Since you and Andy are cooking Christmas dinner, I can make breakfast that morning,” Draco offered, “Pancakes, eggs, bacon, and fresh fruit?”
"This is ridiculous!" Molly Weasley scowled at Dumbledore; they were in the kitchen at 12 Grimmauld Place, discussing the situation with Harry. "You saw what that boy did to my poor Ronald! Harry Potter living with the Malfoy's-this is absurd! They are obviously a bad influence on him!" Sitting nearby and observing everything quietly were Remus Lupin, Arthur Weasley and Nymphadora Tonks.
They flew for hours, not coming down until after midnight, when Draco had Crispin land in the garden behind Grimmauld Place. Harry conjured some carrots from the kitchen and cast a warming charm on the garden, before leading Draco into the house. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck and pulled him in for a kiss, which the blond eagerly returned, firm hands resting on Harry’s waist.
“Fine!” Harry huffed, “Will you please let me cum? Please fuck me or suck me or whatever, and let me cum.”
“I had not realized I was required to tell you my plans,” Draco replied, “However shall I make it up to you?”
My invisible lover guides me onto the bed, and I soon find my arms bound to the headboard with strands of garland; green and silver are wrapped around my left wrist, while my right is bound with red and gold. I feel him join me on the bed, spreading my legs wide so he can slide in between them. It is strange to feel the pressure of his body, without being able to see him, but I find myself even more aroused. He could do anything to me-anything at all-and I would have no warning. Hands smooth up my chest, gently brushing against my nipples before sinking into my hair and yanking my head up for a kiss. The kiss is passionate and all-consuming; his tongue is everywhere, laying claim to my mouth. He pulls back slightly, only to bite down on my lower lip, soothing the sharp sting with his tongue once more. I arch up, and we both groan as he lowers his pelvis at the same time, slowly grinding our erections together until I am fully hard once more.
“Ah, Severus my boy!” Dumbledore smiled as he met Severus at the Entrance Hall, “What brings you here today?” Severus had already spoken to the minister, and Scrimgeour had promised to get him a copy of the arrival and departure times for all ministry employees that day; it was likely to take a few hours to compile, so Severus had arranged to have them sent to Malfoy Manor and then apparated to Hogsmeade so that he could talk to Dumbledore.
Severus was still musing over this when a sharp tapping at his window disturbed him; looking up, he was annoyed to see Fawkes flying outside, holding a scroll that was evidently from Dumbledore. With a scowl Severus waved the window open, and Fawkes dropped the scroll on his desk before taking up perch on the window sill. With a sigh Severus opened the scroll and quickly scanned it;
“Sirius was falsely accused of betraying your parents to the Dark Lord,” Lucius informed him, “He was also accused of killing another of their friends, Peter Pettigrew. Sirius has spent the past twelve years in Azkaban, which is the Wizarding Prison. Now, however, it appears Sirius may have been framed. You heard his story; tomorrow I will set out to locate Pettigrew and attempt to determine whether Sirius was being truthful. If he was truthful, he will want you to come live with him, Harry. You will, of course, always be welcome here, but we will also not be angry if you wish to live with your godfather.”
When Harry finished changing into the new outfit, he was happy with what he saw. His new outfit consisted of an outfit similar to what Draco had been wearing. Harry had on black hose with an emerald green sleeveless tunic that fit him like a second skin; he had on black dragonhide boots instead of the pointed elf shoes, and a black dragon leather belt with a gold buckle. He also had emerald green robes that were an exact match for Draco’s, but the embroidery on Harrys’ robes was gold.
“Don’t worry,” Draco whispered as he pressed kisses down Hadrian’s neck, “I won’t even take our clothes off, okay?” He ground their erections together and smirked as Hadrian threw his head back, gasping with pleasure; “If you really want me to stop, just say so and I will.” He pressed a kiss against Hadrian’s pulse, before sucking on it harshly, determined to leave a mark. Draco continued to grind their erections together, thriving on the gasps and moans coming from the smaller boy.
“It’s nice to see you again, Mrs. Longbottom,” Hadrian added, then turned to address their friends, “Come on; we can go eat out on the balcony, right Dray?”
“That’s correct,” Draco confirmed, “This is your last chance to change your mind; once we begin, The Ritual cannot be abandoned.”
Frowning to himself Draco quickly crossed over to his bathroom and grabbed a pot of salve out of the medicine cabinet, at the same time summoning two potions from the shelves near his desk; the salve was some that he used last winter when he fell off his broom. Of course, that was Aunt Bella's fault-she had decided that Draco needed to practice evading curses and hexed him while he was out flying; he had been hit by the body-bind curse and fell into a tree-Bella had made sure he survived, but he'd had a few broken bones and a lot of scratches. The potions were a general healing potion, which should help with the internal bleeding, and a blood replenishing potion.
Petunia didn't reply, but merely gripped Harry's chin with one hand to force his mouth open; in a last ditch effort to avoid the potion Harry attempted to bite her, and Petunia was quick to slap him across the face several times, before pinching his nose. If he didn’t want to pass out from lack of air, Harry knew he would have to open his mouth; as soon as he did, Petunia poured two drops of the blue potion onto his tongue. There was no need for him to swallow the potion, as it dissolved almost immediately.
“Really,” Draco affirmed, “I know we joke about fate choosing us for one another, but if I ever find out which deity gave you to me I will build a thousand temples in their honor.”
Potter was completely naked, except for a pair of strapless red heels, a cock ring, blindfold and the cuffs around his wrists and ankles. He had transfigured his desk chair into a school, and attached a long, medium-sized dildo to the top with a temporary sticking charm. His legs were spread on either side of the stool, with his ankles attached to rings in the floor by small chains; the chains allowed him to move his feet a little bit, but were not even long enough for him to rest his feet on the bottom rung of the stool. With the way he was positioned, the tip of the dildo just breached Potter’s hole; it wasn’t in far enough to really stretch him, but it was in just far enough that Potter could not lift himself off of it.
“I know you will,” Harry smile softly, “It’s only been a week, but I already trust you more than anyone else I’ve ever met. Well, except for Fred and George, but they rescued me too, once.”
"Well, we will put the boy to work immediately," Petunia said, and Harry could hear the satisfaction in her voice, "As soon as you leave I will have him start cleaning the house from top to bottom and he won't get any food or sleep until it is completed to my satisfaction." Dumbledore let out a heavy sigh before replying.
“I would like to offer you my assistance,” the Snow Queen said, once Harry fell silent, “What I did not tell you before, is that I am of the Fae; our magic is different from that of Witches and Wizards, more based in nature. At certain times of the year my power is stronger, and I am drawn to those who need my help. Most of the time I am called to help young children in abusive homes, but I am on occasion called to help someone older. Your pain and betrayal called me here this night.”
"Of course," Draco nodded graciously, "Welcome to Malfoy Manor Longbottom, Lovegood. Tea?" He sat down in a chair in front of the low coffee table, where Tillie had already set up the tea tray. Hadrian took the seat next to him, while Luna and Neville sat across from them.
"That is good news," Lucius smiled as he studied the board, "Has he said anything about how long it will take to find a permanent cure?"
"A miniature Sentinel," Narcissa gasped, "Wherever did you-Hadrian, these are very rare; where did you find it?"
"Draco has been feeling rather protective of Mr. Potter," Severus interrupted smoothly, "We are not yet certain of the cause, but I will be looking into as soon as I get the boy healed-that is, with your permission, of course."
"But you're so adorable it's hard to resist messing with you," Draco teased, and was rewarded by Hadrian's blush.
Once that was done, Hadrian took the pitcher of water and dumped it on the quilt; he had to wait a few seconds for it to refill, and then he dumped it again. He continued until the entire quilt was soaked, then wrapped it around his upper body, leaving his legs free so that he could run. Without giving himself a chance to re-think his plan, Hadrian ran towards the opening in the wall. A small table had been altered to make a low ramp, and Hadrian jumped when he reached the end of the ramp, pulling the blanket over his head and tucking his legs in. He felt his shoulder hit the wall as he passed through the opening, and then a pain so intense that he couldn’t stop himself from screaming. The pain only lasted a few seconds, however, and then he had the wind knocked out of him as he landed on the ground.
This must seem strange to you, although it is undoubtedly not the strangest thing you have ever encountered, receiving a letter from yourself; I am writing this November Fifth, approximately a week after the terrible events that transpired in Godric's Hollow. Once I write this letter I will be altering our memory, and I will charm this letter so that you will not find it until Harry Potter's thirteenth year.
“As I said before, a betrothal contract is not set in stone,” Draco reminded his mate, “The bonding cannot legally take place until she turns seventeen; we will just check in on her from time to time and if need be we shall find a way to remove her from that situation. Hopefully we can resolve this issue with Dumbledore before next summer and then Tom can declare the contract null and void.”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” Narcissa’s voice was stern, “You will stop this useless tantrum at once!" She lowered her voice and continued, "This is not helping your mate; you need to calm yourself so that we can find Hadrian.” The magical storm around Draco slowly died down, and the blond turned around to screech at his mother, but he didn’t try to attack. He closed his eyes and vanished in a flash of silver light, only to reappear seconds later, pale and shaking. Draco blinked out again, and this time fell to his knees when he returned.  “You can’t locate him?” Narcissa’s voice was full of worry, and Severus spared her a quick glance before his attention was snapped back to his godson; he watched in fascination as the sharp beak that had appeared when Draco transformed slowly faded until he had a normal mouth, although the rest of his Veela features remained.
“Indeed, it will,” Draco told him, “There is one portion of the room, in particular, which will be very time consuming.”
“Mmm, Zabini,” I reply, “He was the one who told me where to find you. Somehow, this wasn’t what I expected when he told me you wanted to give me an early Christmas present.”
"Dray," Hadrian said softly, leaning closer so that Lee and Fred wouldn't be able to hear him, "I was just joking. I-I like having you with me; it makes me feel safe. There isn't anyone else I want." Silver eyes gazed at him searchingly for a moment, then Draco gave the barest of nods before swooping down to press their lips together in a swift, hard kiss.
“And he doesn’t need any,” Draco said, earning himself a glare from the reindeer, “He already ate; Scorpius has been feeding him all day. Ah, here we go.” Draco finished checking the buckles, and swung himself up into the saddle, then gestured for Harry to join him. Harry climbed up behind Draco and rested his hands on the blond’s waist.
“Merlin yes!” Harry responded, tilting his hips up, “I’ve been ready!” Draco smirked, then gripped Harry’s hips tightly as he slowly entered his lover. Harry gasped at the burning pressure, his fingers twisting in the sheets beneath him as he was slowly penetrated, his walls being forced to part for Draco’s thick length.
Hadrian and Draco watched as Aracely turned a corner and faded from sight; since she was no longer visible, the glass returned to the mirror, reflecting an empty room and the orb went dark once again.
“Well, I heard from Hannah that Draco is bi, so flirting doesn't mean that he is leading her on,” Neville said, “You know that it’s okay if you're gay, right?” Neville pressed on before Hadrian could respond, “Gran mentioned that a lot of Muggles don't like gay people, but it's acceptable in the Wizarding World.”
"It couldn't hurt," Draco agreed, "I'm sure it would be useful for you to be able to speak Parseltongue when you want to, instead of it happening unintentionally. Hello Father," Draco gave Lucius a nod as they entered the study, "Mother, Severus, Tom." He nodded to everyone before taking a seat, Hadrian willingly sitting next to him with Arden settling on the floor in front of the fireplace.
This box was an item she had forgotten about until a couple of days ago-until Hadrian had come into their lives and Severus had given them all back their true memories. A few months before they had been caught in Dumbledore's devastating trap, Narcissa, Lily, Elena, Alice, Bella and Artemis-Artemis Lovegood neé Lefae-had met here, in this very room, to hold a secret conference. The six women all feared that the headmaster was up to something terrible, and they felt that they should safeguard their memories and secrets in preparation for the worst. The box contained memories and heirlooms from all six families, as well as letters from each of the women to their offspring. Narcissa had been selected to keep everything safe, and so she had placed it in the warded box and hidden it in her study; upon her death, the box would have been sent to Gringott’s, and the Goblins would have been tasked with distributing the contents to the appropriate persons. After that horrible night in the Great Hall she had completely forgotten about the box, and never paid it any attention even when she opened the ebony chest.
"Really?" Hadrian asked hopefully; with his attention on Severus he failed to see the pained expression on Draco's face as the blond turned his head away; "Then Draco and I can go back to just being friends?"
"Ah, but that was yesterday," Draco pointed out, "and today is a whole new day. Well, since you refuse to let me sleep I suppose we may as well get up." Hadrian was relieved when Draco let him go; he practically leapt from the bed before the blond could change his mind and try to pull him back down, "I will let you borrow some of my clothes until we can get you your own."
"They're just joking around," Hadrian laughed, "I promise they don't see me like that; they're like brothers to me. Besides, how many times do I have to tell you-"
"I'll be on Harry watch!" Tonks volunteered eagerly, her bright pink hair changing to neon green, "I can make it so that they never even realize they're being watched!"
“I think I’ll go to bed now,” Draco said a few hours later, putting his book aside as he stood up. He crossed the few steps to where Harry was sitting, and placed a hand on his shoulder. “The Muggles-they wanted you to feel worthless,” Draco said quietly, his grey eyes solemn, “You are a lot of things, but worthless is not one of them.” He held Harry’s gaze for another moment, before giving a small nod and turning to the bedroom.
“I can, and I do,” Draco countered, “The question, Harry, is do you want me? If you tell me you don’t want me, then I will do everything in my power to get us out of this ritual. If, however, you do want me, we can start planning how to make this ritual work for us. I won’t make you answer tonight, but think about it.” Draco kissed him again, just a chaste kiss on the lips, and then stepped back with a smirk before heading for the bedroom, leaving Harry staring after him with a mixture of shock and longing.
“Whatever,” Hadrian rolled his eyes; he chose not to argue-or point out the fact that his sense of fashion had nothing to do with it, as Draco had been the one to pick out and reject the first two outfits, “What robes should I wear? The dark red ones?” Hadrian was wearing black slacks, black shoes, and a red shirt.
"Not until you take a shower and brush your teeth," Hadrian responded, "Until then you can consider me off-limits." Hadrian stuck his tongue out and then went back to his bookcase, ignoring Draco’s irritated huff.
"Well, that was…yeah," Hadrian said, then wondered, "Ummm…am I staying here?" If the Malfoy's wouldn't let him stay, then where could he go? He wasn't sure which of his friends he could trust-well, there was Neville, but what about his Gran? No, he couldn't risk her going to Dumbledore.
Harry set the letter down; Draco was safe, but for how long? It was evident that Draco was counting on The Ritual to save him, even if he didn’t come right out and say it, and Harry hated that he had to take that hope away from the blond. With a frown, Harry got up and went to his desk, pulling out a fresh sheet of parchment.
Fifteen minutes later Hadrian had finished his shower and used his wand to dry off; there was a dark blue bathrobe hanging on the back of the door, and Hadrian pulled it on before exiting the bathroom, using the door that opened into his own bedroom rather than Draco's room. Hadrian was surprised to find that his bedroom was empty and there weren't any clothes laid out for him.
-be gay: there is no way I can be your mate! Isn't...isn't there something we can do to make this...not happen?"
“There may be a way,” Astoria said, “I have no interest in being stuck in a loveless marriage, especially when you already care for someone else; you would eventually come to resent me and our child. However, I think I know a way that we can satisfy our parents, and still let you be happy. Have you ever heard of…”
“Fuck, I want it!” Harry admitted, writhing on the stool, feeling increasing pleasure as the bullet continued to stimulate his prostate. “I want to come! Please!” Harry heard his mystery partners breathing speed up, then there was a soft cry and Harry felt hot liquid splash on his aching cock; the sensation had Harry throwing his head back, and he startled as warm lips pressed against the column of his neck, gently nipping his skin.
"Well, for now we just need to keep this quiet," Hadrian replied, casually returning the embrace; it would feel weird with anyone else, but with Luna Hadrian was surprisingly comfortable, "We can't let Dumbledore find out that we know the truth until…well, I'm not sure exactly, but I would guess that we need to keep it a secret until Tom gets his soul back. Nev-we're looking into ways to restore Bellatrix to sanity, and I promise we will also do what we can to help your parents. Severus has a set of books written by some descendants of Godric Gryffindor and Rowena Ravenclaw which have information on Horcruxes, and there may be other useful information in them, but a lot of it is in Parsletongue so only Tom and I can read it."
“Tonight was a success,” Draco announced, and the workshop erupted with cheers, “For the second year in a row, we have brought a little light into the lives of those who need it most. I already have many ideas for the coming year, plans to make our North Pole even better than it is now…” Draco’s stormy blue eyes never once looked away from Harry as he gave his end of the year speech, and Harry found himself trapped in that gaze.
"In the pet shop in Diagon Alley," Hadrian replied, watching Draco anxiously, "Do you like it Dray?"
"They did, and his name is not Harry," Draco was the one to reply, "He has chosen to go by Hadrian now, to separate himself from the pawn he has been in the past; you would do well to remember that-both his new name, and the fact that Hadrian will no longer allow people to manipulate him. If they try, they will have to deal with me." He flashed a sharp smile, and Hermione visibly blanched.
The next morning, Harry was smiling as he walked through Diagon Alley, enjoying the quiet of the morning. It was cold out, but Harry was warm in a hand-knitted sweater, and he had decided to walk in to work instead of apparating. He was even earlier than planned-it was only now seven-but Harry thought that he could offer to help Mrs. Weasley, who had
“Hello boys,” Narcissa called out to them as they passed the library, “I am glad to see you were out enjoying the weather. How is Arden today?” Arden gave a happy sound almost like a purr, causing Narcissa to laugh delightedly, “He really is amazing Hadrian; I still can’t believe you just stumbled across him in Diagon Alley.
“I agree,” Snape said, “However, if I tell you that the idea is foolish, I will be placing a tracking charm on you to make certain you remain within the school grounds until I am able to tell the headmaster of our conversation. If you attempt to leave despite this, you will serve detention with me for the rest of the year.”
"He does not feel safe there, and he has asked our family for Sanctuary, which we granted," Narcissa interrupted coolly, "The laws of Sanctuary are protected by Magic itself, and not even you can interfere. Now, if you will excuse us Headmaster, Harry needs to see a healer, and I must make sure this attack is properly reported. Come along boys-we shall use my emergency port-key to return home. Draco, hold onto Harry and make sure he doesn't lose his balance when we land." Draco nodded his consent and helped Hadrian to his feet, keeping an arm around the other boy's waist as his mother took out the port-key, which was a small pewter replica of the Malfoy crest. Once both boys were touching the crest Narcissa said the activation phrase-"Prosapia Primoris"-and they were gone, leaving an angry Dumbledore behind.
“Thank you, Bernard,” Santa said, standing, “Curtis, I would prefer to take Crispin if he has passed all the tests. Comet may get upset, but I want the main team to rest after last night.”
“I’m not much help, I’m afraid,” Draco said as he flipped through one of the books, “I can’t understand any of this.” Arden nuzzled his neck, and Draco reached up to pet him absentmindedly.
"I still can't believe Dumbledore pulled that little trick off," Lucius drawled, "It was rather underhanded of him. Now that we know where Sirius is, perhaps we can devise a way to bring him back." Lucius had seen some of Dumbledore’s more recent memories that the boys had not been privy too, and one of those was Dumbledore’s memory of the battle at the ministry.
"My Lord," Severus bowed, "I just finished purging his body of a magic stripping potion, and now Draco and I are going to give him the healing potions; the injuries are more serious than I had first thought."
The sound of the bathroom door opening startled Hadrian from his thoughts and he looked over his shoulder to see Draco emerge with a towel draped around his waist.
"Stop it Blaise!" she snapped, "If I didn't know better I would think that you're interested in Potter." Hadrian took advantage of the brief distraction to slip away from Pansy and head off Draco. When he was a few feet away from the blond Hadrian noticed that Draco's Veela features had made an appearance and knew that he needed to get Draco out of there before he attacked the idiotic Pansy.
“Did you try calling Dobby?” Narcissa asked, and her husband nodded, “Did you try sending one of our elves to locate Dobby?”
"What is this?" Harry asked, and Teddy jumped up, carrying with him as he stepped up beside his godfather.
“You’re evil, Dray,” Harry smiled, allowing his husband to help him up from the couch he had been sitting on, “Let’s send an owl to everyone and have them meet us at our house so we can tell them over dinner.”
“You might change your mind about div-I mean, getting the annulment-after the baby is born,” Harry said, “You might decide it would be better to raise him with two parents.”
"Maybe," he shrugged, "but that's my right, and not even your father will interfere unless I use it to harm you,” Tom’s eyes narrowed, and Draco hurried to add, “Especially since it will allow me to know where you are at all times and will bring you either back to the manor or to my side if you are ever in danger."
"So you admit that you are attracted to me," Draco smirked, catching Hadrian's hand when the Gryffindor tried to knock him upside the head, "Why don't we perform our own test to see if you're interested in me, hmm?" He said teasingly as he pulled the smaller boy closer, "How about a kiss?"
“Hmm,” Draco agreed, kissing the nape of Harry’s neck, “It probably won’t last long. Since you were on the potion for so long, your heat will probably be extremely demanding. Not that I mind, of course.” Draco moved his hips experimentally, and found that his knot had receded. He slipped free of Harry’s ass and turned him over so that he could kiss his husband, only for Harry to cry out as his skin grew hot again. Draco’s cock hardened immediately, and soon he was pushing back inside his lover, claiming him once more.
"Of course," Griphook agreed, taking the memories and tucking them carefully away, "In return, I have some items and information that may help you. Much of the information is Dark, and not fit for the ears of children. As young Mr. Riddle is underage, and his guardian is not here, I do require him to leave the room. I would suggest the young Mr. Malfoy leave the room as well."
