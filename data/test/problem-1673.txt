“Scorpius, James.’ Draco called quietly down the hallway of St. Mungos. ‘Come here. Meet your baby sister Lily Narcissa Potter.”
“WHERE IS HE?! NO GRANDSON OF MINE WILL BE A F-” Lucius rant is cut off as they floo’d through. The other kids made it safe and Harry and Draco were pulling out of a hug. Scorpius throws himself at his Dad while Harry looks at her questioningly.  “Lucius broke into the house. They didn't hear or see anything. We’re okay.”
They pulled apart and Draco asked “Harry when the bloody hell did you get smart? You still act stupid half the time.”
"Yeah. It's great. Mom and Dad fixed it up after they got the Malfoy vault. Com'n see my new room and then I think Fred, George, and Ginny are starting a game out back. Mom and Dad got us all new brooms for Christmas."
“Yes. Mr. Lupin has taught before and I have full faith in the rest of you to be great Professors with a little guidance.”
“He wants us to visit! Who does he think he is, he thinks he can destroy our lives then ask us to come give him some company. Come talk about things. Work it out. And how dare he ask you to come visit him. He must know if you are not there you're not allowed to talk to death eaters. After months, months of being there, now it's okay to want to talk! No absolutely not I'm not going and you can't. We should just burn the stupid thing.” Draco Exploded, letter crumpled in his hand.
Draco clears his throat and stands on top of a table. "The war against the dark lord continues. The battle is raging now. Those who have given their lives today should be awake and rejoining the battle.
Scorpius, too shocked to do much else, just nodded rapidly and ran off. Literally ran, apparently that was wrong.
This is the only one that wouldn't have spread out. The room would have contained it with the fire. The Dark Magic within the horcrux is just sitting in the room. It will refuse to open until it's cleansed of most of it if it doesn't insist on all.”
“We are very pleased to meet your Harry Draco.” Grobb smiles at him. Him and Jeal move out of Dobby’s way and Draco drops to his knees like he's done every time since he turned 12. He looks up from his hug with Dobby and sees Harry smiling lovingly at him. He smiles back just as lovingly.
“I CAN'T UNDERSTAND! I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY! I'M THE REASON YOU DIED! I GOT YOU KILLED!” Harry yelled with tears in his eyes. Everyone had stopped eating breakfast a while ago. (Besides Regulus, he was far too used to yelling at breakfast.) James went to intervene earlier but Lily and Remus stopped him.
Lily kneels down next to them and gently turns Draco’s face to her. “Why do you think people would hurt them?” She asks gently.
Despite all the people no one pays attention to him. He doesn't mind. He asks Grobb why his and Jeal’s son Dobby can't come with. Dobby’s his best friend, they grew up together. Grobb says it’s because they are house elves and he is a Wizard. He doesn't quite understand they all have the same magic. He sits by himself all the way to Hogwarts. He already misses his house elves; they're his family.
Sirius burst out laughing when James screamed then thudded to the floor. “Oh. James Mate that was good you almost got away with it.”
“The six newest things on the menu. Three black coffees, and can you tell Gregory the Slytherin’s are here Please?"
"Hang on Reg.' Harry told him then ran upstairs quickly. He came back down with another present. 'Will you give this to Draco please."
“Not as dark as it was, but there are a few spots better to avoid. I don't think you’ll have to go near those.”
Narcissa, Lily, James, Sirius, Regulus and Remus all gathered around them saying hello to the babies. Ron and Hermione came up after the group separated.
It was after a particularly bad fight between Sirius and Harry after a bad night's sleep that Lily, James, Arthur, and Molly ganged up on everyone.
“Thank you mother, these are great here, open your guys’s.” Draco said while handing them theirs. Harry got a bigger box shaped present while Narcissa got a smaller box shaped one, she opened hers to find a set of earrings and a necklace engraved on the back with
Harry lasted until the night after the Prophet article. “So exactly how much of your inheritance do you have left?”
“Very well, you should get mother to go maybe then she’ll finally reach out to Andromeda.” Draco said.
“I won't.” Neville walks back down the walkway and out the gates. He arraperates as soon as he can. “Mom. Dad. I'm home. I figured it out.”
“Scorpius’ Lucius remanded. ‘You don't run unless necessary. You walk with a straight back and your head held high.”
James breaks first he starts laughing hard enough to almost fall off the couch. “Oh Merlin. I'm sorry. I just- I can't… I think you traumatized them. Hahahaha.” Albus and Scorpius, sure enough, look traumatized.
Everything Dumbledore did related back to the war. But he didn't fight for the people fighting in the war unless they were useful to him. Voldemort did the same thing; he just liked to use Impiero to do it. The ministry was right when they said he was raising an army, it just wasn't the one they thought it was.’ Harry finishes thickly with tears in his eyes. ‘I need some air, you guys should join everyone who's left in the great hall, be back in a bit.” He fishes his invisibility cloak out and puts it  over his head and walks out.
“My name is Draco. I'm going to Hogwarts too see?” Draco said while pulling the front of his robes to show the slytherin crest. “What's your name?”
Draco hugs his parents as hard as his exhausted muscles can. “I love you both.” He says unable to keep his voice from cracking.
Draco understands quickly. “Oh! Grobb. Of course I am. This is Harry, Harry and his family. They wanted to meet my family and they don't care about the, Well, house elf thing I guess.”
“I already did, I took it the last week before break and had them regulate it, but told them it wouldn't be yours till Christmas.” Harry told him which got him a smile and a kiss. He stayed at the Malfoys for another hour before kissing Draco goodbye and hugging Narcissa and heading to Diagon to pick up a new wand then Godric's Hollow to visit his parents. He stayed with them for an hour then left for Grimmauld place. He spent the rest of the holiday with the weasleys and grangers with minimal yelling and lots of explaining till the kids still in school packed for Hogwarts again when break ended.
“The Battle of Hogwarts was the end of two wars. The First and Second Wizarding Wars. Everyone that sacrificed their lives for these wars still died. Some of them were returned to us but not all.” She started.
Tonks was flying through life. She had one week on the job then one week with Teddy. Some weeks the week with Teddy took more energy than finding dark Wizards. She was ecstatic that she came back and could actually raise her child, and she had her dad back. She was doing okay with the separation from Remus. Some Days she would miss him a lot, those days she reminded herself of the days she felt like second best. They still saw each other now and again but it was different from being together. She hoped someday she would find someone to share the rest of her life with just like her parents.
“Thank you, Harry. Maybe I’ll track Petunia down and at least tell her I'm alive. I hope your trip to see Malfoy goes well”
“He will since he can't get to me or Scorpius. She’s the next person he’ll blame for letting it happen.”
The last person Scorpius was expecting to see come through the floo was his grandfather. He knew of his grandfather. The whole world did. His Dad spoke of him as little as possible. He knew better than to mention Grandfather around Grandmother.
“Mr. Potter I'm sorry I have to insist on having guards in here for you protection, I will have to stay as-”
Harry sighed heavily before answering “Of course I meant it. I didn't exactly mean to say it but I Do. I love you, and I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable. We can just ignore it and I'll keep my mouth shut till you're ready to hear it, and it'll be fine.”
When Harry takes him out on a date that weekend he doesn't talk about his family at all. He doesn't tell Harry about his family for the next two years while they are dating.
Harry comes back an hour later with Ron in tow. He looks tired, Has blood smeared on part of his robes and A split lip. “He called some friends. They will all go away. The association with Lucius will earn most of them a very long time if not a life sentence and some were already wanted.”
Voldemort said “There are no more shields for you to use today.”He tried to use Dumbledore's death to make Harry feel pain. He said the battles that Harry won were all accidents.
Draco tentatively curled his hand around the wand closing his eyes at the rush it gave him. He learned some wandless magic. Mostly healing spells after Potter took his. He didn't want his mother completely defenseless. Since then he's learned some more everyday ones. Regulus thankfully didn't comment and Draco trusted he wasn't the reason Potter was giving it back now.
“Actually Minnie, me and Reg talked. The kids will call me Sirius or Professor Sirius so we don't get confused.”
“Of course, but we have to go. Me, Hermione, and Ron are going to find out who did this, we’ll be back as soon as we figure it out Okay.”
"I had Severus teach me at the beginning of sixth year, and Occlumency of course. I knew once he was in the manor and could be in my mind everyday without me knowing he was there I had to hide. Harry my feelings for you aren't exactly new, Now I can just feel them though and not have twenty different agendas involving you.”
“Lily and Regulus are sitting outside without you. We just had to wait until something slipped out of the cloak.” Remus answered.
“Okay. It sounds like I have somewhere to be. Thank you for coming Draco, tell you mother I love her. Please don't tell her about the ministry till we know if I can come home. And I love you my boy never forget I will always love you.”
The Battle of Hogwarts anniversary hit before they took their N.E.W.T.S. Harry couldn't give a speech. He shut down Mcgonagall before she could even finish the sentence. Hermione gave one instead.
“Good morning Harry, Good morning Draco’ ‘-mmmgggg-’ ‘Anyway sleepy head I made pancakes for breakfast if you want Harry, only awake wizards get their breakfast.” Narcissa teased with a smile.
They reached the door and a nicely dressed house elf opened it. “Master Regulus may come in. Guests must wait for Master Draco before entry.”
The rest of the group cracked up while Harry Objected. “You’re not an owl. You got presents as well.”
“Are you sure you have no defence Mr. Malfoy?” “Yes Sir” “Then we call on witness number 1 in Draco Malfoy vs. the ministry. Harry Potter.”
And coming from a muggle family and just thrown into this world. All the things I didn't understand. How the school works, what you can do in the world. Even now I don't actually understand what I can do in the wizarding world. I don't understand how it works.
“I have a delivery for Harry Potter. And In case anyone was wondering, I am just a very advanced Owl.”
He knew he would be useless in class today. So he gave up on that pretty easily. He decided to try to pull himself together enough to write a letter to his mother.
Lily was helping Molly in the kitchen. Arthur was referring, and Remus was commentating with Teddy in his lap.
“Jimmys her ministry worker. He has to follow her when she leaves the house, and she can only leave for essential things.” Draco told him.
“No, that wouldn't have worked. During the final battle, when you and Riddle were circling each other, did you feel the magical build up?”
“Gentleman, Welcome to Azkaban. Mr. Potter I weren't aware that you were to see anyone or that you would bring Mr. Malfoy here, I heard he and his mother we’re reformed.” Said the worker with a slight smile.
He and his mother had moved to their hogsmeade house with the possessions they cared about and a few family aerlooms his mother instead they keep. They celebrated his birthday recently and his mother bought him new robes and a new broom even though they got a letter saying eighth years couldn't play Quidditch but could train and help the teams if they wanted to. He was shopping in hogsmeade for another journal as he had filled his current one, when it first happened. He was passing by Hogs Head when one of the people walking by hexed him. He knew it would happen at some point he just didn't expect it till he went to Hogwarts, he could have defended himself considering defensive spells are the only ones he can do, he just couldn't bring himself to stop it thinking this is what he deserves. Luckily he had already bought his journal and could go straight home, where his mother freaked out then started performing standard counter-hexs because he didn't know which hex it was yet, which probably meant it was one of the worse hexs. He ended up going to his appointment the next day recovering from the hex, meaning he had to tell Nydia what happened and how he didn't stop them from doing it.
With the skill of a seeker Harry caught the Elder Wand. Tom Riddle hit the floor with mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hands staring down his enemies shell.
Shock showed on Voldemort's face for a moment before it was gone. Voldemort said “I can attend to Draco Malfoy.”
When I first pledged my loyalty to Voldemort I was a dumb kid who thaught that purebloods were more powerful then anyone, and I was angry because certain people didnt like me. When Voldemort died the first time, I was relieved I didn't have to deal with him anymore. When he came back I knew if I didn't show he would kill you and I thought he couldn't be beaten, he died yet he still came back. I figured if he was going to rule the wizarding world the most I could do was make sure you had a safe place on the ash heap.
“MINNIE.’ He rushed over to hug her which she returned gently. He used a sonorous to announce her ‘Attention please. Mrs. Minerva McGonagall is in the house.”
Draco Summons Kreacher to the potions classroom. He asks "Would you be willing to gather the house elves and help me bring back people that died during the first war?"
Harry quickly lost his appetite. Hermione knowing he wouldn't want the attention on him struck up a random conversation. Dinner moved on while Harry sat quietly. Dinner became a light thing with a dark spot. Instead of a dark thing with a light spot.
They spent the next 2 months doing school and visiting Hogsmeade every weekend. Draco hung out with Chip and brought him to hang out with the trio every now and again. 1 month after Christmas Draco got his mother's flowers tattooed around his scarred Dark Mark, and Harry told him he would look good with more tattoos.
Later the night Malfoy broke the routine, he didn't put up his privacy charms or draw the drapes. Harry did the same thinking he did it for a reason.
"Yes mother. I'll be safe, I'm wearing my cloak, I'll be in and out before anyone realizes I'm there. Okay?
“Yes.” Draco whispered, grabbing Harry by the waist when he flinched back so hard he jumped. “Harry Potter. Look at me,’ he said, trying to get Harry to look away from the scars.'Look at me Harry’ finally getting Harry's eyes to meet his. ‘This was for your own protection. Harry that night when you followed me to the bathroom, I failed again, I was terrified. If you hadn't stopped me...I don't know what would've happened. I wouldn't have been able to let you go tell everyone, and I would've had to take you to him and that would have been worse than death for both of us okay, cause I wouldn't have been able to stand back while he tortured you okay thats why I didn't tell Bella I knew he would've came and I can't watch you be in that much pain. Don't get me wrong watching Hermione go through it wasn't pretty but Harry you going through it would have broken me more than I already am.
Draco looked down at Chip and saw that he was hiding halfway behind him looking almost as scared as he did in the forest, so Draco nudged at him and said "Hey its okay go on, you have to get sorted into your house' then whispered to him 'plus as soon as you move away from me they'll stop staring at you."
Teddy turns around to babble with them. His emerald green eyes contrasting with his still platinum blonde hair.
Lily, Sirius, and Remus exchange a look before laughing. Regulus snorts and James blushes with a small smile.
He had started at the bottom of the list and four days in he had completed Dean, Luna, Ollivander, his fathers and his mother's letter. He had floo-called Nydia again to ask if she would read the letters, but she said the letters were between him and the recipient and they shouldn't be shared until he was ready to share them with everybody, knowing he wasn't ready for that he let Nydia go. He had sent his father's letter to Azkaban knowing it would be read by the guards, and also sent Dean, Luna, and Ollivanders out. He gave his mother her letter at dinner time the day he finished, then retreated to his room not wanting to be there when she read it. After dinner that night he wrote Nevilles letter and addressed it to be sent after his owl got a full night's rest and a good breakfast. The next morning he pulled out three pieces of parchment and addressed them
They were content with the children they had. They weren't actively looking to have more. Plans changed. A baby was left on their doorstep. Baby Knightley the note said. Her parents said they trusted Harry and Draco to be the parents they couldn't be, to give her the family they couldn't. Draco knew it was a done deal as soon as Harry held her for the first time.
When he got home he could see his mother trying to avoid looking like she was waiting for him on the couch from the moment he left.
Each house dorm has been expanded for the overload of students. Eighth year will have separate dorms. Bullying of any kind will not be tolerated. In this castle we are all on the same side. May we come together this year to move past the prejudices of war and into a new time. A lighter time. Enjoy your fest.” McGonagall sat back down amid the applause.
Ron was currently at the Weasley's house while Hermione visited her parents and Harry was at Grimmauld when a mysterious owl flew in with a letter to him. As soon as he saw who it was from he wanted to throw it away but it started with ‘please read’ and he thought it might've been the first time Malfoy ever used the word please.
Greg put the jar closer to the wall then looked at Draco with a too sweet smile. “Harry?” He questioned.
“Good. I will see you in 2 days for the next meeting. And Draco one more thing before you go, you can tell your mother you didn't fail her, that you trusted me for today.”
They spent the next week in bliss waiting till they finished the official last year at hogwarts. McGonagall held a special ceremony for all the eighth years and Narcissa showed up with Jimmy in tow who had been following her for ministry approved trips when she needed to leave the house. They left Hogwarts and Ron and Hermione went with their families while Harry went to the Malfoys.
“Listen before you object’ James started ‘We think it would be best if everyone went to a mind healer.’ Objections started ‘HEY I said wait.” Everyone quieted but seemed displeased.
“Exactly he was letting his anger bleed into his magic. When a powerful wizard lets that happen, excess magic builds in the air. Riddle, You, The Dumbledore Family, Bellatrix, Sirius a little bit, many other Powerful wizards. More powerful than the average.
Harry was sure that he and Draco wouldn't be able to write for a week. Ginny sure had her strength for a Quidditch player recovering from a Major Injury. Even with wizarding medicine having a leg crushed that badly took some rehab. Luckily for Harry and Draco she was willing to be pregnant for half of that rehab.
Harry waited 5 minutes before Draco came down. Harry's heart sped at the sight of him in tight fitting Black jeans, an emerald hoodie and a black beanie covering his white hair minus a few strands.
“Ah, that was part of her punishment. I'm afraid they didn't tell me what happened during your trials, I only know what I could piece together from your letter.' He said while opening the letter from Narcissa carefully and pulling it out.
“My dragon, please calm down, we must talk about it, not talking about anything may have been the reason it got so bad. That day in the forest I did ask Harry Potter if you were alive or not, I had not seen you at all and I had no clue. I lied to The Dark Lord because I knew if you were alive there was a chance Harry could beat him and you would be safe, If he would have said no I wouldn't have lied. You are the only thing left in this world that I care about. I love your father and I will always love your father but I can not care about the man he has become. I don't expect you to love your father or forgive him for what he has done.”
Naturally they bought most of the trolley, and the train was packed this year. 8th year students, and 1st years with all the kids who were redoing a year. Hermione said she would bet that McGonagall had to work quite a bit with Hogwarts to extend the dorms.
“Well Mr. Malfoy if you must know. Auror’s Robards and Weasley want to see the final product in person before they purchase it for the department. As I have been on a lovely honeymoon the last 2 weeks they wished to do it as soon as possible. What brings you here?”
He opened his notebook and put an X through everything that he had written and started over. Starting with what he knew based on how people acted.
“Hi Jimmy, If something happens to either of them I'm blaming you.” Harry said with a small smile and serious eyes, He waited till Jimmy nodded before leaving “Lets go guys.”
Moaning Myrtle walks to the front and says “Hello Tom nice to see you again this time you won't kill me” She grew as a person while being a ghost.
“That took a lot out of all of us. We need at least a week to recover before taking the same amount.” Regulus responded.
Apparently  Harry now had a lot to think about before they returned to Hogwarts the letter was appreciated and did help him understand, but until he saw that Draco had changed he could not trust it or him, no matter how much he wanted to.
"Hey Ron. I like what you've done with the place. I'm glad it still feels Homey." Harry greeted his friend.
The two Apparated to Malfoy Manor “Sorry I dragged you into coming. I figured he would be at least slightly comfortable with you.” Harry cringed slightly.
Harry and Draco walked around Hand in Hand in Hogsmeade. They were waiting until they were sure Remus and Sirius were done with their date before going to the new shop. Most of the students were already gossiping about them before they even walked in the restaurant. They just sat down when the first flash went off. And this is also another reason they went shopping first. Luckily the owner took care of the press guy quickly.
“Hogwarts would be honored to have you all. Potter I'm to assume you will return. What about Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Granger?”
Sirius had talked to Harry late afternoon and calmed him down some. The next day they all had a meeting in the living room AFTER breakfast. Lily, James, Arthur and Molly sat everyone down and stood in front.
And you know you can't stay out of the Papers forever. They’ll get bored and come back to their favorite topics. Harry Potter, Powerful families, and The War. You're quite intertwined with all 3 of those. And Harry is certainly not going to care what the Papers say.
"Okay. If you don't mind, I wouldn't mind some books about Mu-muggle-borns and muggles. I never really got to learn about them."
“Yeah, Yeah Harry too. I guess.’ Ginny replied sarcastically. ‘On another Note. Mr. Zabini has the booze. Have fun everyone.”
He learns they aren't enough. He wants them to be but they aren't. For the first time in his life he wants. He wants Harry. Grobb says they are still his family. He didn't understand until Zacharias Smith called him a death eater Poof. Harry punched him. Then he cursed him. Draco made Harry sweets to thank him. No one else calls him a poof, or a death eater.
Despite working with their bosses sometimes when Tonks and Remus had Teddy they still had to do some work. Remus had Teddy this week, he was also taking 3rd through 5th years on a field trip. His History of Magic class was by far the most active ever. Because of said field trip Harry was doing Godfather duties. He was watching Teddy in his dorm. They had put protective spells around Malfoy’s stuff and Teddy was using Harry’s wand. Malfoy walked in to a face full of pillow feathers from Harry's new exploded pillow.
“Dragon.” His mother chided and he looked down into his cup. Thankfully Regulus saved him from more.
He flipped through his notebook and saw his opinion on muggles and wondered if he would be able to take Muggle studies this year. He didn't even know that was a class until Voldemort said so when he killed Charity Burbage. He wondered if he was supposed to put dead people on the list, he still felt guilty even though they were dead. After 2 days of creating the list he knew that if he didn't write the letters and send them he wouldn't be able to return to Hogwarts and see those people without going insane. He wanted time alone to write the letters so he floo-called Nydia to ask if they could meet a week from that day instead of their normal time and told his mother for the next week he would only come out for meals and to please leave him be. He didn't tell his mother exactly what he was doing just that Nydia suggested it and he needed alone time to complete it.
Draco led them in slowly. Harry couldn't remember any direction he went that day but Draco seemed to know exactly where they were going. They ran into the diadem first. It was melted and looked disfigured.
“Then that's where we should start. I know that the courts say 3 times a week but that might be more destructive than helping, so I wont see you till one week from today. While you're not here I want you to look at all the subjects on this list and write in a journal your opinions on them. Not what your father wants you to follow or what your mother believes. I want you to form your own opinions blocking out other people's opinions as much as you can. Then we shall discuss it next week.”
He’s nervous about meeting Harry’s family. Of course he is. But there’s a worse feeling he can't shake. Like his world is going to fall apart. He thinks it makes sense. Harry’s Dad James Potter is Head Of Magical Law Enforcement. His Godfather Sirius Black is Head Of The Auror Department. His Mother Lily Potter is Deputy Ministress Of Magic. His Other Godfather Remus Lupin is Mrs. Potter's assistant and terrifying in his own right, even without the werewolf thing. The other attendee is Regulus Black. He runs the unspeakables. Draco only knows that through Harry’s slip ups. He was able to put it together.
“You forget you can not hide anything from your mother Draco. How long have you loved Harry Potter- don't deny it we both know it's true- and how in the world did you hide it?”
I hoped that someday the war would end and The Dark Lord would lose. I thought I could just wait it out. Then I found out about the locket. Voldemort meant for his war to last more than one lifetime. I figured I might as well die trying to make him mortal once more.”
An hour later Draco left to take a breather. Harry followed after. “Are you drunk Mr. Malfoy?” Harry asked teasingly.
He watched Potter swallow then slowly back to the door. “Yep, yeah, okay. Tell Reg I went home please.” Potter walked quickly out the door. Draco shut it behind him and closed his eyes, breathing deeply.
They met Ron, Hermione, Neville, Dean, and Seamus. Seamus decided to open a pyrotechnics store, Dean was apprenticing for Aberforth planning to take over Hogs head once Aberforth retired. Neville was going on to study Herbology, he planned to one day take over at Hogwarts. Hermione was already working her way up to Madam Minister, Ron was going to become an Auror, he already started training, which happened to include death eater hunting with Lucius. Harry told them that he would be joining Ron as an Auror for some time before maybe teaching at Hogwarts, Draco shyly told them about his hopes to become a mind-healer and open his own place without his Family's money. They all had two last weeks together before heading back to their homes.
After Draco finished his letters he found his mom sitting in their living room letter still in her hand with the pages looking weary and worn.
“Mr. Potter it is also my understanding that during the battle of hogwarts after you came back from the dead so to speak that Draco Malfoy also gave you a wand then when you were defenseless against Voldermort by throwing it to you while you were running away and he was running toward the other side of the battle. Is that correct?”
“Yes, You jerk I know what you mean. And I meant it my mother's wand just doesn't get me well, bloody hell some days my new wand still doesn't get me. Thank you Harry. I've missed this wand dearly. I'll have to call the ministry and tell them to regulate this wand as well.” Draco said, finally picking the wand out of the box.
He comes out of the floo and Teddy, James, Albus, and Lily are playing games in the living room. Ginny comes out of the dining room at the sound of the Floo.
“Yeah, of course I do. You met my family. I wanna meet your’s. I also kinda want my family to meet your family but we don't have to do that now if you don't want.”
“Good’ Draco said with a blush ‘We should probably get ready for bed now. Um but I have to warn you Harry, I may have nightmares tonight and It won't be pretty. Sorry.”
From how the curriculum the Professor’s have to follow is made. To how we know who’s a wizard and who’s a muggle. And how muggle-borns and half-bloods raised with muggles are introduced to our world.
“No. Plus you don't have to stop using DADA. You could train on your own for a bit. Practice on other things first. Then you would be prepared for training.”
Harry gently tried to pull Draco's face from his neck, laughing softly when Draco whined and refused to. “Draco, come on, look at me,’ Harry said while kissing Dracos temple. ‘Come on, baby, look at me...there he is. Hi baby boy’” Harry said with a smile on his face.”
By August most of the Weasleys moved out of the mansion. The older ones went to their own houses or in some cases bought their own houses. Charlie went back to his Dragons.
He walked out without another word hoping his mother would have something to distract him when he got home so he wouldn't lash out. When he got home she did have something so he avoided it till he went to bed.
“Thank you mother.’ He smiled. ‘I’ll see if I can go to Gringotts today and get the specific numbers. When I come home next week I’ll let you check.”
A man sneers at him. He has a kid on the other side of him who looks scared. But the kid looks scared of them oddly enough. “Death Eater Scum.” The man says, looking straight at him. He looks up at his mother confused but she doesn't spare him a glance. He’s used to that.
Narcissa noticed the look on her son’s face. “I agree with Mr. Potter, Chocolate does help after a cleanse.”
He didn't touch the list again for 2 days. He didn't know what to do with it, he already had opinions on these things didn't he, that's why he had the dark mark. That's why he called Granger Mudblood and Weasley Blood traitor. He knew his opinions and he told her she may not like them so he wrote them in the journal she provided and didn't touch the book for another 2 days.
“Because people will.’ Regulus answers for him. ‘If the most loyal death eater family’s knew that A Malfoy claims House elves as his family they would assume him to be cursed and therefore punish or even kill the elves.”
Neville came by with his parents to dinner one night. Alice took Hermione away for a bit, she heard from Neville that the young girl was another one of Bellatrix’s victims. Percy was the one to ask the weird question, quietly to neville.
A week later they set it up again. Tonks did not collapse this time. They cleansed until the room stopped shooting Magic. It cracked open the doors to the room of hidden things. Everyone that was waiting rushed to the circle.
“Regulus thinks the base theories are good. It may be the choice in the spells we used. The box itself also needs to be more formidable. We used a pliant wood. We’re thinking of speaking to a wand maker about different types of wood. It did start to cleanse the magic though so we’re hopeful it can be done.”
“After you guys were brought to the manor. He lied to Bellatrix, we know that now. Luckily Bellatrix just thought he couldn't Identify you. I imagine she would have kept him there if she knew. But he was sent back to Hogwarts, and Bellatrix let the Carrows have full range. They said it was punishment for failure. He was theirs for the whole month until the Battle.”
“Yes Potter the offer was extended to Slytherin’s and Gryffindor’s alike. And Mr. Malfoy has already responded that he would like to return if he is welcome, and I assured him he was.” McGonagall left Harry to his deep blushing and floo’d back to Hogwarts.
Sirius crosses his arms, clenches his jaw, and sollows before speaking. “Both of my brothers were dead, I spent 12 years in  Azkaban. I wasn't necessarily in the mood to talk about old times. Even if Harry Deserved to know.”
“He did. And both of them agreed nothing could touch the love he has for you. Alright?’ Sirius nodded. ‘Now we’ll wait until the kids are seated then I’ll announce your entrance. You’ll come out the staff entrance to the great hall and Say??”
Mcgonagall, Kingsley, Harry, Hermione, Ron, James, Lily, and Remus were standing at the end of the hall. The heat had gone down but Mcgonagall kept the barrier up in case the Dark Magic loses control.
“The last one please” Draco said in a small voice looking down at the ground. Harry put his arm around Draco walking them toward the room then shaking his head at Ron and Hermione who silently asked if they could do anything. They got to the room and lay down completely relaxing knowing no one would find them in there. They laid there for a few hours before Harry asked Draco if he wanted to talk.
Draco shared a smile with Regulus. No matter how strong his mother was, he could tell she was struggling. The session he had with her showed him just how much. He had a lot of unfound anger at her and she had a lot of unfound guilt about his life. But their relationship was as strong as ever, she would always be his Mother and he would always be her Dragon.
Draco, Narcissa, Regulus, Sirius, Andromeda and Tonks were gathered in a semi circle around the room.
Harry groaned and turned over. Remus dropped Teddy on him. No matter how cute Teddy was, he didn't think he would cheer him up tonight. “We had that party tonight, you know. Well Draco was on his second drink and I hadn't finished my first one. We went outside for a breather and I kissed him. He ran away. He didn't even say anything, just turned and walked.” He pouted.
“NO It's not. Draco are these from me? Did I do this when I almost killed you?!” Harry demanded with tears in his eyes.
“I would like to but it's a lot. Not to mention some of those things would take Law changes. I’ve never been that great at school.”
“Some Restitution to individual people, purchase another Manor and Donate to the ministry for an Orphanage. A wing or two will be for people who are still displaced by the war until they recover. I want to do all that anonymously. No newspaper, No name on the building, No attachment to a political regime.”
James joins him on the table and says "We might as well have fun since we already died. Those that aren't in the order may leave whether it is to fight or to leave to a safe place."
Draco walked away from him ignoring his calls to bring him back. He walks back in and sits back down with his mother, leaning into her touch when she runs a hand through his hair.
“Both Lily and Regulus ignored me for years. Lily thought I was a jerk, which was kinda true, and a player ,which was not true no matter what she says.’ Harry chuckled.
James looked devastated for ½ a second before jumping on his best friends hugging them as tight as possible. All three men closed their eyes. James pulls back and looks at Lily then Regulus with question in his eyes. Lily smiles and Regulus shrugs indifferently.
They moved in Two weeks before school started. Harry refamilarted himself with the castle while the adults rushed to get ready for their classes. He helped set up each classroom though. Every once in a while he would floo to Ron or Hermione's.
“Yeah I'm going to uh do that, Bye Hermione we can finish the potion another time.” Draco said picking up his stuff and slinging his bag over his shoulder finally breaking his trance. Draco sat outside the exam room for an hour and a half waiting for Harry to finish. He came out with Ron who said “Well, as much fun as this seems i'm going to go do anything else. Good luck mate.” While clapping Harry on the back earning a double glare from both the boys.
“Thank you.” Harry responded to the healer then he summoned his Stag to inform Narcissa, and Hermione in case she needed the information. He then walked to Dracos room and entered slowly, oddly enough Draco looked more relaxed then Harry had ever seen him. He pulled the chair in the corner across the room and sat next to Draco, hesitantly reaching up to grab his hand, when he didn't stir Harry grabbed it more firmly and laid his head down on the bed, anger evaporating quickly. He sat by himself for a couple of hours then Ron, Hermione, Narcissa, and a ministry worker arraparated into the room. Harry stood up still holding onto Draco, which nobody but he missed. “He's alright he’ll just sleep for a while.”
“Hey...You know ever since sixth year i've been wanting you to smile like you used to, you to get that gleam in your eye I used to hate so much cause it meant trouble for me, you to relax in the grass or sitting in a tree you're beautiful when you do that, Did you know? Anyway I would very much like to do all those things with you and much more, baby boy.”
Muggle schools may have a hierarchy and they definitely aren't perfect but some school systems are mind-blowing. They actually prepare the kids for life while teaching them what they need to know.
"Not like that. Here.' Harry grabs his hand with his other free hand. He brings Draco’s up and touches their palms together. He curls Draco's fingers around his hand and shakes with his whole hand. 'Like that. See?" Harry asks him.
“There will be no need for that. I said you may leave now and I meant it.” Harry cut him off dismissing him again. This time the worker got the hint and listened to the boy leaving the office while the guards knocked on the door to bring Lucius in. Once the guards and worker left, Draco and his father stared at each other while Harry tried to blend into the office.
“Grobb told me when I was 11. Right before he dropped me off at the platform. He told me what people might do if they found out. I don't care about the world knowing of Mother’s death but the world asks questions and questions are dangerous.”
Draco has to accept that you feel that way about him. Now he might doubt it sometimes but he has to accept it at least once. And you have to accept that it might take him a while to be totally comfortable in his feelings and your relationship whatever type that might be.
Two hours later year 1 through 7 were sent to the dorms and eighth years were asked to stay behind. “As I said before, you all have separate dorms. The Third floor Corridor on the left side has been prepared.’ She paused at Seamus’s hand. ‘Yes. Mr. Finnegan that one, it's plenty safe now. There is only one entrance and there is a common room open straight across from it. Your dorms are down the hall on both sides. You do have assigned roommates. No you may not switch. I'm counting on you all to help bridge the gap between houses especially for the younger students.’ Everyone looked slightly displeased and alarmed at this. ‘Professor Potter and Professor Black will lead you there. You should also know that there is no curfew but this does not extend to other years. We also ask you to inform a staff member if you take a trip to Hogsmeade. It is good to see you all.” She finished smiling.
Once again the minister put his charms up. Harry didn't know where the need to keep Draco safe came from, where his anger that Draco was so ready and willing to give up and provide no defense came from. He didn't miss the way Draco looked like he wanted to be punished, like he wanted to get worse then his mother did, like that was what he deserved. He also didn't miss the way he flinched anytime Hermione's name was said, the way it looked like he stopped breathing altogether when Harry said Cursio, they way he looked at Harry like he was some type of alien when he revealed that he knew Draco let go of his wand on purpose. Draco also tensed up when Harry mentioned Lucius, but he had been doing that since first year so that was nothing new. Harry started to pull himself out of his head when he saw the charms going down.
“Michelle!’ she looks at him in surprise. ‘I need you to send an emergency message to Draco Malfoy. We need a curse breaker here now! Sign it Head Auror. Nothing else.” She nods her head and he goes back to his office. He waits impatiently in front of his floo. Not 5 minutes later Draco comes through.
Harry looked down at his few opened ones. "I have no clue. Guess I just do, I'm not used to presents."
Malfoy looks highly annoyed and rolls his eyes. “They were exceptionally cruel people. They had twins. One daughter and one son. They had a house elf named Keplion. They once starved the daughter so bad she passed out. Her twin thought she was dead so he buried her alive. Keplion was a slave to the rest of the family but he was her friend.
“Well forever is a long time but if you must. I would like you to come look at these cottages that are on the ministries list please. I plan to move to the area around Hogsmeade so I can see you during term. I think leaving this house in the past would be best for us.”
Draco snorted. “Wanker. I love you. Good luck.” He kissed Harry gently before stepping off the lift.
“The mind-healer we found would also be able to do joint sessions. Sometimes it would help to have an outsider opinion and a mediator in the middle of a fight. It's also all free due to a donation to the ministry purposefully to help pay for ‘The traumas of the 1st and 2nd Wizarding Wars’.” James finished.
He waited until after class started to move to the owlery. He luckily didn't see anyone that would ask questions on the way there or the way back. A house elf was kind enough to leave him breakfast. He climbed back into bed and Nibbled on it.
“Why did Dumbledore send you there? He knew what Petunia was like.” Lily asks. Both Ron and Hermione give diserive snorts at the question.
“Dragon, shhh, calm down, it's okay,’ Narcissa soothed him, bringing him into her arms. ‘My Draco, why don't you go to Nydia's see if she's there and take the letter with you to show her, and once you have decided what's best we’ll work it out from there. Harry and I will wait for you here. Okay?”
“Yeah. There was a good amount of Dark Magic in the room before but it's never spread out into Hogwarts.”
After the ceremony Everyone configured a bed in Draco and Harry’s dorm. It went from wall to wall. There wasn't any floor left. They set up entertainment and house elves brought snacks and an appropriate amount of firewhiskey.
“Harry. Mate.’ Ron started, ‘You need to talk to him. He probably just needs reassurance of your relationship.’ Both Harry and Hermione looked at him slightly weird. ‘What? I read a book.”
“I've been told that mind-healers are a bunch of nobodies who only want to profit off of weak wankers who believe that mind-healers can help them because they aren't strong enough to do anything else.”
“Yeah… I saw you take it that summer. I heard you had to be willing to take the Mark. I was hoping it was just a nightmare.”
“Thank you.” Draco politely nods and walks out the great hall. He drags himself up to the headmasters office past the Gargoyle.
“We’ve all made bad decisions guys, besides I don't think either of them were loyal to voldemort, maybe to Lucius, but not voldemort.”
“No Draco. I don't want to change it. I like the idea of the word meaning something else other than you bleeding out on a bathroom floor.”
He sends another one to moaning Myrtle's bathroom and tells them to ask her where she is buried and then collect a piece of her hair.
Arithmancy was still his favorite class. Regulus, or Professor Black to the younger students, let the older years do independent projects. He helped Draco make something new. The cleansing of the Manor was Draining in every way. He looked for something that would help them do it but there was nothing. When he complained to Regulus he told him to make it. So in class they tried making it. It would take a lot more work then one class for one year that was for sure.
The forest of Dean would have been a wide open space and it  would have thinned out. If it caused issues in the forest the ministry would have cleansed it. Same with the forbidden forest.
“And Do you Draco Lucius Malfoy take Harry James Potter to be your Lawfully and Magically wedded husband?”
“Alright then case dismissed, next case Draco Malfoy vs. the ministry, You are also a witness in this case Mr. Potter?” “Yes Sir” “Then you will stay where you are, also Mrs. Malfoy you are welcome to stay considering the defendant is your son, would you like to?” “Yes Sir” “We will now start the trial. Mr. Malfoy you have been accused of being a known death eater, allowing and aiding the trespass of death eaters onto and off of Hogwarts grounds, associating with many counts of the capture and tourture of Garrick Ollivander, Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, Griphook the goblin, Ron Weasley, Harry Potter, and Hermione Granger. Now that you are aware of the charges you may defend yourself.”
He chose to protect you Draco, He chose to do what Dumbledore wanted, He knew it would probably get him killed, he was one of those people that love unconditionally. He loved my mother from the first time he met her to his dying breath. It was his and Voldemort's fault no one else's.”
Harry was sure it was a very nice speech but he didn't listen past that. He killed someone on this day. It was Voldemort. And he was barely human, but he still killed someone. It took him some time to come to terms with that. He saw all those bodys in the great hall. Yes, people came back to them that day, but Harry didn't think he would ever be able to focus on that instead of losing them in the first place.
He led them to a picnic set up close by. You could see the layers of warming charms. Two full picnic baskets were filled with food with charms over them. A big blanket was spread on the ground and candles floated in the air unlit. Several small blankets were folded as well in case the warming charms weren't enough.
They sat like that for a few more minutes before Greg started to pull away. Pansy and Blaise sat back down. The waiter brought their sweets and coffee plus a hot chocolate for Greg over a few seconds later.
Harry smiled and leaned in. Kissing Draco Malfoy was a lot better when he kissed back. Harry pulled away and beamed at him.
They came out to their friends at the next gathering in the Room of Requirement. This time it was only their friends.
“It's fine. I do get to see Narcissa. I just like the power I have over your father. Your mother likes it too. He hates when we agree.” Regulus winked.
Back in the Potter house Ginny is faced with 5 very confused children, one who is slightly shaken and shocked. “Okay. Okay sit down. Put the games up.’ She checks the wards while the kids clean up. She starts talking when the kids are settled. ‘Harry and Draco.’ They made an early habit of not calling Harry Dad when talking about him for Teddys sake. ‘They were the most affected by Voldemort. I know with Tom Riddle and the diary I was also very affected but Harry and Draco had it the worst. After the war during 8th year they bonded over that a lot. Now me and Harry were on a break during 8th year. We needed space to deal with the aftermath while still supporting each other. Draco and Harry were together.” She gives the kids a minute to process.
She waited till most were walking away before addressing Draco. "Mr. Malfoy,' 'I know, I was late, I'm sorry, I could-' 'Mr. Malfoy this is not about that, although I'm not mad at that you did the right thing, you handled it excellently. What I wanted to ask was, I saw you signed up to take muggle studies and I wanted to make sure it wasn't a mistake."
James, Lily, and Regulus got a room. Just because Lily and Regulus didn't love each other didn't mean they couldn't share quarters. There was an extra bed in other quarters though. Sirius got his own room. Remus had his. Harry and Teddy each got their own room too. Then they had a kitchen, dining room, and living room.
“Are those families ones you still want contact with? You can always make new contacts. And in the current climate they would be unwilling to have a problem with Harry Potter publicly.
“Alright, Alright.’ Draco calmed them. ‘Dont go telling the press yet. We have a Hogsmeade date planned for Valentines day the press will probably figure out then.”
Harry and Draco introduced the baby at the next large family gathering with all their families there.
“I have a message from Auror Robards. He’s heard of your work to create a box to help cleanse Dark Magic. He would like to help you if you need it. He would also like to talk further down the line about supplying the Auror Office with the finished product.” He handed them each a card with Robards information.
‘And Regulus, he hated me for a long time, absolutely despised me. He thought Sirius was replacing him with me. Saw me as Sirius’ idiot friend. When we first got together it was purely physical’ Harry wrinkled his nose.
“I quite cared for Kreacher, and that potion was wretched. I loved my parents even though perhaps I shouldn't have and it made no sense to. As we know Sirius has no objections to actively hating them. He’s right to. They were horrible people, but I couldn't hate them.
“What if I'm just using you to rebuild my family name and I don't even realize it. It’s not hard to see how they got to that conclusion.”
“Ah, Chip. I've heard about you. Draco will be fine. He needs to sleep for a few days then he might have to stay at the hospital for a few days but he's good. We were going to talk to the teenager who did it, would you like to come?”
“Ah, Of course not. I will have the guards bring him, you can use my office, my apologies we normally don't have people to visit.”
Also there are 3 restricted places due to not being completely repaired or having an excess of dark magic. These areas are clearly blocked off please refrain from messing with them.
Sirius starts crying as James and Lily come back. "I'm sorry' he sobs 'It should have been me, I should've known."
Harry snorted. “I don't know.’ He sighed. ‘I fixed my Holly wand. Put the Elder wand back. Don't know what to do with this one. If I give it back does Malfoy become the master of the elder wand again. And how do we know this would even work for him.”
“That’s why you didn't know how to shake hands. Why you’re so socially unaware and awkward. You only had interactions with house elves.” Harry says. Draco meets his eyes with tears down his face. Harry wraps him tightly in a hug and kisses his forehead. Draco closes his eyes trying to block out the world.
He started to skim through one's written during first year till he found one mentioning his first potions class. Severus had always been his favorite professor. He was the only one who knew what Draco felt for Harry, the only one who understood Draco. He was one of the only people that Draco cared for enough to cry when he found out Severus had died. He read through the first page which was mostly just him praising Severus. The second page wasn’t that interesting till he saw that he mentioned Granger. He couldn't believe that he once wrote that she ‘is one of the smartest in our year and she annoyed Professor Snape with knowing all the answers but I found it rather entertaining that she could keep up with me in potions and she must be from a Pure-Blood family in order to do that’. He couldn't believe he wrote that about a Mudblood and was curious about what he said in his next letter but found nothing except him ranting about Potter, Weasley, and Granger the Mudblood. He thought about his journal and how his feeling toward Granger changed just because he found out she was a Mudblood. He started to feel unsure if he really had his own opinions or just went along with what he was told to feel.
The next few days were spent in the hospital goofing around as much as the staff allowed it, which brought glimpses of Dracos mischief to his eyes that faded out during sixth year, with Blaise, Pansy, Chip, Hermione, and Ron visiting. Ron and Draco shared a few civil words before going back to bantering with each other including Thank you and You're Welcome.
“Okay…’ Harry replied in a whisper ‘Draco...I want...Can I’ He choked out cupping Dracos face in his hands.
“We are going to talk about that last one later. The Diary and The Cup would have spread up from the Chamber and been cleansed in the rebuilding process, along with Nagini.
Draco gently brought out a wrapped Jar from inside his cloak. He unwrapped it and put his hands down.
Harry looked sad and angry now slightly avoiding Draco's eyes “Um..You went to see who sent the charm and someone did it to draw you out so they could Hex you for what they called ‘Justice’. They used a pseudo charm of Cruciatus, where it just puts the body in pain instead of both the body and the mind. It dosnt hurt the mind but it does disorder it, that might be why your memory is messed up.”
I didn't have hope Potter would beat him, I didn't believe in the savior, so as long as I could keep our family in good graces with Voldermort you and your mother would be safe. My choice long ago made me lose choices later, I couldn't go back on him . He would have tutored you in front of me to make a point.
Lucius died at some point, but if I put it in the story I feel like I would have to write the impact it had on Draco and i'm not really feeling that right now so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“Put him back’ Narcissa says definitely ‘We are not safe with him out. Nobody we care about is. Do what it takes.”
Luna had two boys with Scamander. Lorcan and Lysander. They were a year younger than Scorpius and James. Somehow she knew. Draco and Harry wanted another kid. The twins were 6 and Lily was 2 and a half. Lily was just old enough to understand Remus Fornax Malfoy was her baby brother.
They talked for almost an hour figuring out what was best for Draco and Draco only. Nydias lunch was by far gone when they finally decided that it would be best for Draco to see his father to gather closure but he should pick someone close to him to come with for moral support that his mother would be giving if she could go. So Draco and Harry left on brooms, the only way to enter Azkaban without an escort, that afternoon as well as carrying a letter from Narcissa to give to Lucius.
Harry slowly kissed Draco and waited till Draco started to kiss back then kissed him again. His slightly chapped lips against Draco smooth ones. Draco held him by the hips then started to lightly push Harry back to the bed till Harry hit his knees and fell back in to the bed never breaking the kiss and bringing Draco with him, who pulled his knees up to straddle Harry's things moving his hands up to Harry's shoulders while Harry moved his hands to run them across Dracos thighs.
“I-I-I've loved since the first day I saw him. It all went wrong when I tried to talk to him of course, I thought there was no way he wouldnt love me, I was just a stupid child but by the end of first year I didnt know how to fix it and I couldnt it just continualy got worse. Now I know he'll never love me, he can't love me. As for how I hid it, at the beginning of sixth year I asked Severus to give me occlumency lessons. Between the two of you I got pretty good at it. I used Harry to block off that part of my mind whenever he used legilimency on me, I knew he would kill me if he found out I was in love with the precious savior.”
Harry felt dread spread through him as he realized Draco has the mark and she would not be able to talk to him or see him. Their relationship kept him alive and he could not let it be taken away now.
“Hello, father.’ Draco said then stared again. ‘This is from mother she insisted you read it before we talk. I believe that she wanted to come, but i'm the only death eater that she may consort with.”
“Im fine darling. The healers said that once you woke up you should only have to stay for a few days then you can come home. And I spoke to McGonagall you're going to finish the rest of the work before Christmas break at home then go back to school after Christmas break.”
After the war ended Hermione went to Australia and restored her parents memories, now that Voldemort was dead her parents could remember and be safe. Even though he was dead she made sure to put protection charms around her parents and their house. She went to see the mind healer close to weekly now instead of frequently like she did right after the war. She was currently visiting her parents spending the majority of her summer with the weasleys and grimmauld place. She wasn't expecting to get any owls unless something bad was happening, so she panicked when she got one, but was even more surprised that it was from Malfoy.
“Very well. The quarters will be set by the end of the week for you to move in. I will send more information soon. I shall take my leave now.” She smiled.
Two weeks later Narcissa’s House arrest ended. Draco and Regulus took her to her favorite restaurant in France for a nice night out.
They tell him what to wear. They tell him to relax about it. They tell him to be himself. They tell him to be careful and keep everyone safe. He understands other people might want to punish them for being his family. He tells them he would never put them at risk.
He couldn't resist. He leaned over and kissed him. Draco sat shocked when Harry pulled away. Draco stared at him then turned on his heel and walked down the Hallway quickly. “Draco?” He tried. Draco didn't respond.
As you can see we have quite a few new staff members. I would like to introduce Professor James Potter who will teach Defense against the Dark Arts. Professor Lily Evans-Potter who will teach Potions. We welcome back Professor Remus Lupin who will teach History of Magic.’ She waited for the rise in applause for Mr. Lupin to quiet before speaking again. ‘Professor Regulus Black who will teach Arithmancy and Professor Sirius Black who will teach Transfiguration.
Snape killed Dumbledore but you disarmed him that night and Voldemort never won it from you. It was yours till I disarmed you at the Manor, then it was mine. Voldemort killed Snape and assumed the wand belonged to him but it didn't, its loyalty was to me. If Snape did own the wand Voldemort would have won.”
“Okay.’ Draco said, taking a moment of quiet, ‘You know what made me the most angry when you got thrown in here was?’ He questioned looking at Lucius ' It was that I lost my father and I couldn't ask you what to do. I broke Harry's nose on the train because I missed you, and now you've left again, you're back in here, and Azkaban doesn't exactly have visiting hours. I just want my Father back, the one before Hogwarts and before sixth year, the one who loved me and was proud of me.” He ended quietly.
The house elves have taught him how to write, read, and speak. His mother ordered them to start teaching him subjects a year ago. They let him explore the library when it's his free time. Which means it's his choice of what to learn about. He chooses a book that’s called ‘The Wizarding World War: The Basics.’
“Don't look so scared, boys.’ She comforts them. ‘They weren't in love or anything. They care about each other of course but they weren't in love. They just comforted and gave each other what they needed at the time. They understand each other like no one ever could. Hermione likes to call them two sides of the same coin.
All around them battle breaks out. Everyone eventually makes it back into the great Hall, the light side is being pushed back by the death eaters while they all fight.
“Attention students.’ Mcgonagall started at Dinner. ‘I would like to inform you that the 7th floor left corridor is now unrestricted.  The only restricted section’s left at Hogwarts are the Forbidden Forest and Madame Prince’s Restricted library section.”
“The only way the things you're afraid of are going to change is how strong I know and think you are, and I'm only going to think you are stronger Harry.” Draco said while lying down on Harry and wrapping him in his arms. Harry said okay and the both closed their eyes to try to sleep.
It didn't take long to find who did it; they found that people answered pretty quickly when a pissed off Harry Potter asked them questions. They were on their way to the teenager who did it whose name was David when Harry heard a young voice call out.
Draco and The Slytherin’s were quiet all day. They seemed cowed and detached, but they still tried to comfort their friends when they could. They also lost a friend that day, one they didn't get back. They visited Gregory for the first half of the day. They only came back for the ceremony that night.
“Mr. Potter, what reason do you believe Mrs. Malfoy had for lying, surely she did not do it out of the goodness of her heart."
A week later, after the ministry had taken Draco to get a new wand and restricted his and his mothers, put tracking charms on their magic and trackers on their person and set his first appointment with the mind-healer, they were escorted to the manor. It felt so weird to be back for the first time since the battle. The front room was still trashed and bloodied and the rest of the house seemed dark and cold. He went up to his bedroom, one of the only places in the house he liked, one of the only places untouched by Voldemort.
“Um. Yeah. Yeah he did. Well i'm going to find Neville and Luna because you're not gonna be much help anymore now that you're broken.’ Hermione said while smiling at the shocked boy. ‘Why don't you go wait for Harry outside the classroom so you guys can talk? I'll see you later. Bye Draco.”
When they got to the hospital the healers took Draco away to treat him. Harry couldn't get the image of Draco on the ground screaming in pain out of his head he slid down to the hospital floor and put his head in his hands knowing no matter what he did the image isn't going away. While waiting for the healers Harry's anger grew steadily, vowing to himself that once Narcissa got here and Draco's stable he was going to find who did this and make them pay. Just as he felt he was going to explode the healers came out and Harry stood to meet them.
He started to walk to the check in after nodding to Narcissa. He couldn't bring himself to look at Draco, afraid of whatever he might see in those eyes, afraid of what they might look like with shields up, no longer surprised to see him. Once he talked to the worker at the desk he sat down and lost himself in his thoughts, the Malfoys being led on their way past the dim hallway. He couldn't stop thinking about how Malfoy looked now, still skinnier and paler then before sixth year but not as bad as it had been a week ago. He couldn't help but wonder if Malfoy's eyes would ever light up before like they used to going into a challenge. He didn't know why he had been thinking about Malfoy so much since the war was over.He heard his name and stood not sure he was fully prepared to be in that courtroom again but going in anyway.
The 8th year spread out at their own table that was horizontal just below the staff table. The students broke out in whispers over who was sitting at the staff table. Remus led in the first years and everyone started to quiet.
Draco startled with a gasp removing his hands. Harry looked at him with crazed eyes and he immediately started to apologize.
“Natural curiosity I guess. And they are also confused. In their previous state of mind sometimes they weren't sure what was real and what wasn't.”
Silence holds as they process it. Sirius speaks first, shock lacing every sound he makes. “You're talking about House Elves. You lived with essentially just House eleves your entire life.”
“Because I'm his godfather and Remus is busy. And don't talk about Teddy like that, you don't even know him. Although I think he's your cousin somehow.”
"Um..yeah. Of course I'll treat him right. And it's his choice if you can still do that. I'm just here for moral support since Narcissa couldn't come. I also think she sent me so I could tell her everything Draco wont." Harry said slightly shocked at first and ending with a smile toward Draco, who responded by muttering 'traitor' under his breath.
Umbridge, who used a quill that used your blood as ink, taught everything from the book, wouldn't allow practical magic, and forced us to make Dumbledore's Army to pass our O.W.L.’s.
Draco sees the crowd fall around Harry, His parents spot him from the other side of the room and rush to him.
"Sure mother no problem." A week later Draco was in Diagon Alley buying his school supplies and storing them in an expandable bag so he wouldn't look like a student. He bought some copies of his books for his mother like she asked mainly the ones muggle studies said he needed. He caught glimpses of other students including the golden trio but hid every time he thought he saw them. When he got home he separated his books and his mothers ,who was cooking dinner, putting his in his trunk and his mothers in the empty spot on the bookshelf for now. When they sat down to eat his mother started talking.
“Yes, but he’s also Scor and Jamie’s little brother too.” Harry said, looking at the boys behind her.
“I know a room that can be whatever we want it to be and we share a dorm, no one would look that much if we locked the door.
Harry starts to talk for the first time. “I lived with Petunia and her family all this time. They weren't great, but they could've been a lot worse. And once I started at Hogwarts I ended up at Ron's half the time. And before you ask Sirius no you're not allowed to go Dursley Hunting.’ Sirius sits back with a pout making Harry smile. ‘They were also living with a Horcrux all this time, I wouldn't be surprised if that made them worse than they truly were.”
He’s nervous. He’s never been around this many people. Not since the time he was Three, that’s the only time he’s left the grounds. Grobb tells him his parents would have preferred him to be in slytherin. Grobb also tells him they will await him at home for the holidays no matter his house. He takes Grobb’s word over his parents.
“I did. I was also reinherited. Although Regulus had to approve it since it was our parents' Vaults. I can't help but wonder why though.”
Luna visited with her dad, he apologized for selling the golden trio out and was met with full acceptance. Even Seamus and Dean, and the rest of their closest friends visited.
The next day Harry went to the Ministry and they approved that Lucius was to help them catch Death eaters, and he was to be at the malfoy home or with the ministry at all times. Harry returned to the malfoy house with Lucius in tow making Narcissa drop the pie she was making. Lucius had been helping for 2 weeks when it was time for Harry and Draco to go to Grimmuald for the week.
The room heard the conversation between its friend and it's friend’s friend. It carefully lifted the ashes with the same signature and floated them into the open container.
He directs one elf that is formally known for killing its masters to go to Saint Mungo's and kill the longbottoms and then get a piece of their hair.
“Well I was on the train but then I saw one of weird looking horses. He started walking this way so I followed him, then he started to fly and, i've never seen a horse fly so i started running to keep up with him, then I couldn't see him anymore and I ended up here. Wherever this is. You know where we're at right?”
When he found out what the twin had done he tried to save her. However he was bound to his Master’s will. Their father stopped him. Ordered him to leave her there. He didn't have a choice. When she finally did die he went insane. So insane he was pardoned by the wizengamot. He killed all three other occupants. He buried the father just enough so he could watch as his son and wife die before him as well.
“Oops” Harry said while slowly going to hide behind Draco. Once they explained what happened and convinced Narcissa not to kill Harry, Harry and Draco put the balls into their boxes from Narcissa, and Harry handed them their presents. Narcissa opened hers first and Harry got her a few new books about muggles that Draco didn't know she might enjoy because he only got her what his class list said. Harry went and sat by Draco on the couch and gave him a long rectangular box then wrapped his hands around Draco so he couldn't run. Draco opened the box and saw his old wand that Harry was still using since he broke the elder wand.
Frank and Alice Longbottom had been enjoying life since they returned. They both had to see a mind-healer frequently. Being insane for 18 years by way of tutore would do that to you. But it wasn't all bad they got to watch their son. He already grew up but he wasn't done growing, and he was just as excited to have them as they were to have him. The last thing they expected was restitution.
Bellatrix laughed the same laugh when Sirius died. Molly's Curse hit Bellatrix squarely in the chest. Bellatrix toppled. Voldemort screamed, blasting McGonagall, Kingsley, and Slughorn back. He raised his wand and directed it to Molly when Harry yelled “Protego.”
“Mr. Potter I believe that to be quite a dangerous activity to be doing.” James was trying to magically braid Regulus' hair without him noticing.
“Also Harry said that your friend Chip said he come visit when you woke up lucid enough for a conversation. I also heard that Chip and Ron beat up the teenager who did this, so you'll have to thank them next time you see them.”
He arrived at the ministry at 11 unable to stop thinking about how it would be the first time since Malfoy threw him a wand that he would see him. He supposed he would have to also point that out during his testimony today. He stepped into the lift and thought about the previous times he had been down to the courtroom. One seemed like it was a lifetime ago him being the one on trial and One seemed like it was years instead of a couple of months. All thoughts of anything disappeared when he stepped off the lift and his eyes locked with malfoy’s. His eyes changed so much over the last two years from the beginning of sixth year determined and prideful to when he looked desperately afraid to completely blank and lifeless to relieved and tried, but they never had quite returned to sparkling with mischief and dangerous glee, to matching the mirth and laughter in his voice before that changed too. After a moment Harry forced himself to break away looking to Narcissa who was watching them with a weird expression on her face and the ministry worker who looked scared half to death to be by the malfoys even if they were cuffed and wandless. He supposed he should ask someone how he was supposed to do this as he walked over the workers eyes widened in either surprise or fear although he's not sure which.
James and Lily Potter land in front of Ron and Hermione, directly across from voldemort. Voldemort furious starts mumbling to himself “how are they alive”.
They were probably halfway through their date when they noticed James. They could see Lily and Regulus talking outside of the shop but James wasn't there. Sirius chuckled and Remus sighed.
“I love you too father.” Draco said hugging his father good-bye. Draco and Harry went back to the Malfoys and told her everything except about the ministry.
“She has been and yeah she is that's Jimmy’ Harry said while pointing him out ‘he's supposed to stay with her while she's here. I actually think that you would like him.”
To this day there are things Draco can understand about Harry that I can't. And if I’m honest I am so glad I can't understand. I don't want to and I don't want anyone else in this world to understand. Obviously they aren't together anymore. When we all graduated they broke up. Harry and I got back together a few months later. A few years later Draco met Astoria.’ She smiles gently at Scorpius who somehow both perks up and skins back at the mention of his late Mom.
“I’m not enthralled by the Idea, but if you are sure you want to take this family in this direction, I will do my best to support you.”
He goes to introduce himself properly, but another boy defends him. "Ron! You can't ask him that! It's like asking my parents about Pettigrew."
The house elves are teary eyed all day. He doesn't know why. He asks. They tell him Master Cissa has gone. She has passed away of her own will. He asks if they should call anyone. They tell him it is against her wishes and orders. They are all to carry on as normal. They are to tell no one of her passing otherwise the Master may be made to leave the Manor. He agrees easily to their requests. He finds a new word in a dictionary. Orphan. He knows his father is dead. His mother is now dead. That’s what he is now. Orphan.
Pure-Blood: Purley wizards in the family, possible to have non-pure-blood relatives, traits change person to person
“No!’ He can't stop his panicked shout. ‘You can't. You can't hurt them It’s not their fault They have to do what I tell them They didn't know any better. They’re my family, you can't hurt them. Please!!”
Harry sighs and leads him to the bed. He wraps himself around him in a hug and pets his hair. “It’s okay. Everything's Okay.”
"Ah we did but we're okay now Headmaster. Chip followed a Thestral and I found him on my way in." Draco Explained.
Harry’s parents tried to actually be his parents. Which was not a bad thing in nature but Harry didn't really have parents so he pushed back quite a bit.
“How do you know that though?!’ Draco stands and starts to pace in front of Harry. ‘With everything I’ve done is it really that hard to believe I see you as a political opportunity? That would hardly be the worst thing I’ve done.”
“I still don't understand that expression even with Muggle studies. Babies sleep horribly.” Draco pointed out while he got up and started to get dressed.
“That's okay when and if you forgive him it needs to be for yourself not for him. But do you still love him?”
“Hey, Harry. Malfoy was down there with Parkinson and Zabini.” Ginny nodded her head. They decided pretty quickly that they were better apart.
Similar to Teddy Mcgonagall offered the same privileges to Grace. James, Lily, and Regulus didn't want to stop teaching to raise her and McGonagall didn't want them to leave so now Hogwarts frequently saw a 5 and 7 year old running the halls.
“Mr. Potter, it is my impression you wanted to talk to Narcissa Black Malfoy, that surely can't be correct, can it?”
The next week McGonagall visited the Mansion. She had sent a few letters here and there. She was busy reconstructing Hogwarts during the summer.
“Yeah buddy I know where we are. The horse that you saw is called a Thestral. Hogwarts uses them to pull the carriages to and from the school, and only certain people can see them. Now-”
As they leave Sirius  notices Frank and Alice Longbottom. "You know they weren't dead last time I checked."
“Draco breath, It's okay. You told your mother you would try. Let's try before you assume you're going to fail, okay.”
“Ah.. Y-Y-Yes Mr. Potter, all witnesses check-in over there and wait till they are called upon and can I just say what an honor it is to meet you.”
As they were getting the teenager up Ron said “I think i've finally gone mad’ and punched the teenager as hard as he could which is a lot harder than Chip making the teenager pass out while Harry and Hermione looked at Ron with matching faces of shock. ‘What? I told you I think I've finally gone mad, defending Malfoy, who would've thought?” Ron said with a hint of smile earning himself a kiss from Hermione.
“But after 17 years of hearing the same thing it's hard to believe the one time you're told differently.”
Over the next month things didn't change much. It seemed to be more hopeful and lighter than before though. There was a discussion here and there about people moving out of Potter Mansion. James of course told everyone they are welcome to stay. The Grangers were invited after Regulus, Hermione, and Ron went to Australia and restored their memories. They moved in just while they got their affairs in order to move back to Britain.
He went to bed late that night thinking over his Mother’s Letter. He knew had to go to classes the following day, but he hadn’t made any decisions therefore he prepared himself to wear his mask and resolutely not look at Harry.
“Next time you should put shields around you guys so you don't get hurt. But I'm glad it's going well. You’ll get it done someday.”
