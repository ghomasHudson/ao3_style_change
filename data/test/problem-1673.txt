“I know this case means something to you, something personal,” said Draco, evenly. “I saw how it affected you on the day I was brought under the Fidelius. And I can sense deception in your answers about Potter. You were a good enough Occlumency teacher to get me that far.”
“Of course.”
The dark man said something in a low voice. She replied something biting, but edged in fear. Harry was certain he wouldn’t be able to understand their conversation, but Draco urged him forward. He could almost hear him saying to sharpen the recall, to block out everything else but the two people before him.
Draco let out a long breath and stalked over to where Pansy sat on a black scalloped settee, startling a few muggles entering the foyer who scuttled out of his way. She fixed him with an indulgent expression, patting the cushion next to her. She looked impeccable in a scarlet dress that fit her thin form; her pale legs crossed at the knee. Her dark hair was pulled back, showing off the graceful lines of her long neck. He took a seat next to her, leaned his elbow on the arm of the sofa, and attempted to look relaxed.
“Yes, my boy, it is,” said Ollivander, closing his briefcase with a satisfying snap. “Holly, 11 inches long, phoenix feather core.”
“Why don’t we say I’m tutoring you in Potions, since it’s more believable that you’d come crawling to me for advice than the reverse,” said Draco. “Plus, it’s not like you’ve got anyone to save face to. Does anyone even ask where you’ve been?”
The following months went by in a blur. Most of which Harry had already seen. But they slowed again over Christmas. Lingering on his arrival to the Manor and reunion with the Dark Lord. He could feel himself going numb as Harry watched, horror struck as Draco joined the brethren for a toast on his last night in the Manor, before Voldemort subjected him to the Cruciatus Curse.
“I didn’t choose the path, I just followed a memory your subconscious was trying to hide,” said Draco, finding that he was breathing equally hard with the exertion of the spell. “Who was that?”
“Not bad, Potter,” said Draco, straightening up. “But not good enough, I’m afraid.
Draco scoffed, now realising that he’d steered them onto a topic he distinctly did not want to talk about. “Oh, I see. It’s a joke to you that he can see that sort of potential in me outside of the match. Is that what you’re saying?”
Draco chuckled. “If Luna foresaw this, she could have damn well told me earlier and saved me all the trouble of making my way here.”
“Wow. That was actually a worse move than the last,” said Draco, shaking his head.
“Er, no one really.” Hagrid scrubbed a worried hand across the back of his neck. “I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’. So it would only be, oh yeah
“How interesting,” said Snape, drily. “There were rumours, of course, of a mental link. I imagine Dumbledore heard of the same or he wouldn’t have gone to the trouble of prescribing Occlumency lessons. Beyond that, what’s there to tell?”
“Unicorn hair, Cedar,” repeated Ollivander, checking the labels on the boxes and flicking a few away, which zoomed back to the trunks and nestled in among the others. “Let’s give this one a try.”
“Even if we had all of them right now, there’s still the matter of destroying them,” said Cedric, picking up the locket and inspecting it in the firelight. “If Dumbledore couldn’t destroy the ring, I’d say it’ll take more than your garden variety Blasting Curse.”
“Alright Potter, I think something’s going on with your grip here, let’s see,” said Cedric.
said Ivy, as if that clarified things.
Harry flicked the back of Draco’s head and he winced, as the other two dissolved into giggles. Draco stopped walking abruptly, and Harry, who had been close on his heels, stumbled into him, causing his robes to get invisibly rumpled and Luna to snort with laughter.
“It’s incredible, but… what are they all doing here?” asked Harry. “It’s not exactly a time to be bringing more people into the fold, we’re about to do something really dangerous.”
“Today is December 15, 1997, right?” he asked. Hermione did not respond. “It is for me too, but not in this timeline. Right now I’m at Hogwarts in the Room of Requirement with Luna and Malfoy. We’ve just found another Horcrux—”
Snape’s nostrils flared as Draco smirked at him from his reclining position against the cabinet. The Potions Master wouldn’t dare cross him, Draco knew, not while he was under his father’s thumb so completely. He was pushing it, but he had a feeling Snape wouldn’t put him in his place. Not anymore.
“We haven’t finalised all the details,” said Angelica, “but we’ve been discussing it all week. We’ll be setting a date sometime soon.”
“Someone has to make sure Voldemort pays for his crimes.”
Harry squirmed under the old man’s piercing gaze. “I’ve been told mine is forgettable,” he said with a shrug. “That’s what my last girlfriend said, anyway.”
“Erm, I need those to see,” said Harry.
“She’s got nothing to do with this!” shouted Harry.
Hermione nodded, accepting her exile as a few quiet tears fell down her cheeks. Cedric pulled his cloak on roughly and headed for the exit. Draco hesitated for a moment, then turned quietly and Transfigured back into his school robes.
“Kill you?” said Voldemort, his face splitting into a thin-lipped smile. “Who said anything about killing?”
Draco’s shoulders dropped some of their tenseness. “Alright, this should help,” he said, pressing the cup back to Cedric’s lips. Then, turning to Hermione he continued in a low voice, “He must have been heavily dosed. He'll be stable for a while but Veritaserum overdose can cause nerve damage if it’s not treated quickly. Do you know how to make a wideye elixir?”
“So he and Lucius re-wrote the history. Scratched out all the muggle alliances, even covered up some of their more sizable investments in muggle businesses. I assume you’ve looked at the books, so this is probably old news to you. But then things got a little hairy when it became clear that this new guy, this ‘Dark Lord,’ was after personal immortality and soul magic over some of these lofty ideals he’d been touting. Once there was talk of a new world order, only the fanatics were still the true followers. The rest were locked in out of fear.”
He turned around to see Charlotte near the brink of tears, holding a tree branch. She threw it down and flung her arms around his shoulders.
Hagrid’s bottom lip trembled, and he sniffed loudly. Minerva laced her fingers together, but nodded in agreement as sagely blue eyes fell over her.
Harry ran a thumb over the loopy signature on the letter, his shoulders hunched, head bowed. In that moment, he looked utterly alone.
Snape marked the paper with three quick Xs as he crossed off the words ‘Cornish Pixie Dust.’
No fewer than six Death Eaters had their wands trained on her, but Voldemort held his hands out “Stop! Do not harm her,” he commanded, and they stopped in their tracks.
“Didn’t think so,” said Draco, pushing past her.
“That’s – It was out of necessity,” sputtered Draco.
“Sure,” said Harry. Draco caught his eye and smiled. Mission accomplished.
“I would, but he seems more forthcoming with you. I just assumed if there was someone he’d confide in… nevermind.”
“I agree,” said Draco, glaring across the room at Hermione and Cedric. “Maybe the two of you should take some time to get your stories straight.”
“You two, back up. People will ask questions if they see us walking together,” said Draco out of the corner of his mouth. “And you under the cloak, shut it. You’re already on thin ice for this hairbrained scheme of yours.”
Could it have really been the snake? If animals couldn’t be bound by Fidelius Charms, that was one loophole found. But he wasn’t sure he’d be able to convince any snakes to carry the message to Wiltshire for him.
Massive thanks to my beta, Honeybeet, without whom none of this would make any sense. Seriously so lucky to have you as my banter coach, kiss consultant, and checker of obscure lore minutiae. You’re the best, HB!
Hermione stopped again. Draco, who had only been half-listening, started to cast a quick eavesdropping charm to amplify their voices when Pansy pushed the magazine in front of him.
“I told him not to bother. It doesn’t work that way,” she said with a light shrug.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Merlin, no,” said Lucius, his face drawing tight. “Not while you’re still in school. There are other matters in Wisteria Hall that require attending to.”
“How can it be fixed?” asked Harry.
“Well?” Draco said impatiently. “May I come in, or shall we stand here until dawn?”
He was just about to turn to Cedric to leave, when he felt a delicate hand on his shoulder. He flipped around to see Pansy with an unimpressed expression and Blaise and Theo right behind her.
“We’ll be alright,” said Hermione, sounding like she was telling herself just as much as them.
Luna turned to face him, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. “It was you in my vision too,” she said. “It has to be.”
“Don’t worry about it, Hermione. I wouldn’t expect anything different from them.” Harry felt a familiar combination of responsibility and loathing, but shoved it down. “I’m just glad they let you pick up my things.”
“—We are trusting you with what is certain to be a heavy burden. But nothing, of course, which Head Boy can’t handle.”
“Happy Halloween,” said Harry awkwardly, as he tried to keep Luna’s attention on the small feast he’d set up on the coffee table and not the fact that the room was looking particularly bare. “Thanks for coming.”
He activated the coin with his wand and waited, first close to Luna to check she was still breathing, then pacing around the room when he couldn’t keep his eyes on her any longer.
“She’s just refusing to teach me anything useful is all,” said Harry, slouching over to the armchair by the couches. “I mean honestly, when am I ever going to need a needle but I’ve only got a match?”

“She’s working on some protective charm I can take, and says that I’ll be ready with the charm and all the magic I need by mid-October,” said Harry, though he wasn’t sure if he believed it anymore. “But the longer I’m here, the more I wonder if that’s the case.”
“You’ve just received a message beyond the grave from one of the most powerful wizards in history,” said Draco. “Are you sure you don’t want to take a while to think this through?”
“I’m afraid I’ll be in the hands of the Ministry by that point,” said McGonagall, her lips pursed with worry as she glanced at the door and flicked a spell at Fawkes’ cage, letting the door swing open. The majestic golden bird swooped out, landing on a perch by a tall cabinet. “They’re coming for me soon, so you had better not linger. Quickly now, what do you need?”
As Harry’s footsteps died away, Draco let out a slow sigh. Of course not. He was an idiot to think that Potter would still want him after all he’d done.
Harry took the bike in a lap, one he remembered cycling often as it always brought him back around to Privet Drive, where he was obligated to return. And a familiar sinking feeling reemerged as he began the back half of the loop.
“We’ve already tried that,” said Harry, sitting across from him. “Besides, didn’t you say practising recall clarity would help? I’ve been practising sharpening one in particular.”
Snape hesitated, clearly choosing his words carefully. “It was not unusual for the Dark Lord to choose targets that defied him to set a public example. I believed, as many others did, that the incident would be a nonevent. I do not know the Dark Lord’s personal thoughts on the matter.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be making a few changes of my own.”

“That must be Draco’s…”
“You don’t need to answer now,” she said, finally pushing away, her eyes glistening. “I’m just glad you’re not shagging Granger. That was Blaise’s guess.”
“He trained you,” he said, finally.
“My father might know something about soul magic,” said Luna. “I can help Hermione look into the research.” Hermione smiled weakly at this suggestion as Luna beamed at her.
, Hermione,” said Luna in an uncharacteristically stern voice for someone with a snake poking out of the neck of her Jumper. “If You-Know-Who comes back, none of us will live a normal life.”
“I would pay good money to watch Granger and Lovegood debate whether Crumple-Horned Snorkacks exist,” said Draco, who was rewarded with a laugh.
“Alright,” he said finally. “We haven’t got much time left to figure this out. I’m willing to try whatever you think will work.”
“I knew it would spoil you,” said Petunia, the dark hallway casting long shadows under her cheekbones. “I saved your soul for this world and the next. And they got what they deserved – blown up for some cause no one’s ever heard anything about.”
He pulled away and smiled warmly at his mother. He couldn’t remember the last time they had spoken openly like this. If only it could last.
cried Umbridge, pointing her wand at McGonagall, who screamed and thrashed uncontrollably.
Harry searched his face for the signs – it checked out. He was telling the truth. But there was something else, something he was hiding carefully, always tiptoeing around the subjects that might connect him, as Harry suspected, to followers of the Dark Lord.
“Saved by a mother’s love…” started Harry. “I’m not that much of an idiot that I haven’t noticed all the pieces of your memory you’d rather hide.”
As he stared at Draco’s back, he had the funny feeling that he was forgetting something. There was a strange tickling at the back of his memory, like a song that was stuck in his head. Familiar, yet distant. He shook his head to clear the thought.
Ollivander removed the dusty lid from the last box and held it out to Harry. As soon as the wood touched his skin, he knew this wand was different. His hands closed around the handle and a surge of energy blew through the room, pushing Harry’s hair off his forehead as the gust whipped by.
said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.
Since Edgar DuPont’s revelation about the joint venture with his father, Draco had spent the following week diving into research around the alleged partnership. Narcissa had ballked at the news at first, but quickly filled in the gaps where she could.
“Convinced him of what, not to rip my head off?” said Harry, whispering harshly.
The thought suddenly occurred to him that there was a very real danger of something happening to one of them within the next 24 hours that would separate them, and he found himself climbing out of bed and standing awkwardly among Sirius’s old contraptions and motorcycle magazines. The risk that he had been so quick to write off for himself only a few hours ago now seemed unreasonable when applied to Draco.
“Attempting immortality,” said Luna, quietly. Draco cast his eyes down and nodded.
and tossing it on Draco and Pansy’s desk.
“Yeah, I feel ready,” said Harry, dropping the shield and looking around at the others. “Listen, thanks loads for all your help on this. Honestly. I’m almost sad to go, but I feel ready to meet what’s out there now.”
“I’m happy to help however I can,” said Draco with a smile.
Pansy rolled her eyes and sat back in the booth. “Please, do you even hear yourself? He’s been the only topic of conversation for weeks. I know you disappeared with him at the gala. I know something happened at the Scotland weekend that you’re not telling me. And tonight, he’s inviting you to this lavish thing and you both keep glancing across the room at each other. It’s completely obvious.”
“What is it?” Harry asked.
Hermione looked nervously at Harry.
“Talk some sense into him, Malfoy,” said Hermione, turning to the blond with a scowl. “You’re the only one he seems to listen to anymore.”
“There are rumours, of course, of your return,” said Draco. The watery eyed man jumped nervously. “The
Luna looked up at Harry with an expression of resolve. “What I’m wondering is how you’re meant to activate its knowledge-giving properties. We could certainly use a bit of insight after all.” She rose to her feet, diadem still in hand and fringed leather jacket rustling around her. “But I think the task is clear, insofar as it gives sight to the wearer…”
“Yes, I see,” said Ollivander, peering thoughtfully at Harry. “I’m quite sure I didn’t fit you with your original wand, or I would remember. I always remember a face.”
He stared in disbelief at the space where Draco had been standing. Where he’d kissed him, held him, and now – Draco was gone, and there was no way he could follow.
“Oh,” said Draco, lingering by his things. The austere corridor seemed colder and darker than he remembered it. “I should go up and see her.”
“I don’t want your sympathy,” said Harry. “I just want answers. I thought we agreed on that much at least.”
Draco pushed back from the desk, stumbling a few steps away, unable to mask the horror on his face.
To think Dumbledore had been visiting Harry in Muggle England practically every week for the last ten years was unthinkable. The fact Harry had managed to effectively Occlude this from him was beyond that. He’d been so focused on driving Harry to his one memory of the Dark Lord that he hadn’t bothered to dig into the other sacred pockets of thought.
“You weren’t saying…” he started.
“Ron Weasley,” he said, holding out a hand to shake. “Tell us how we can help.”
“No, he’s here,” said Hermione. Draco came to a complete stop and whirled around on her, expecting her regular snarky expression but instead seeing deep worry in her brown eyes. “But he’s hurt.”
Instead, his eyes fell on a glass jar in the corner, which had some sticks and a bit of moss in it. Perfect. He held the jar, feeling its heavy, cool weight. And when he looked up, he was on Clearwater Court, near the local cricket pitch. Dudley and his gang were in their mid-teens, smoking durries and talking loudly about a party they were going to later.
Draco had learned early on in Slytherin house that rule number one of betrayal was having a contingency plan. Luckily for him, he'd maintained his facade of friendship throughout his attempt to turn Potter over to the Death Eaters, and from what he could tell, Potter wasn’t the wiser for his involvement.
“You don’t?” said Draco. Potter was more the fool than he knew. “So why bother with all this, then? You could be levitating quills right now.”
As Angelica chattered on, Draco stared evenly out the clubhouse windows, gripping the leather arms of his chair. For a moment he pictured himself as an old man in this very chair, 50 years into this marriage, with an elderly Angelica babbling on raspily about some golf trip or other they’d been on in the past. Merlin, he’d have to draw some lines as soon as the ink was dry on this marriage.
Borgin’s lip twitched nervously as he said, “I am a loyal—”
“You’re despicable,” said McGonagall. “Dumbledore was working to expose the truth. He Who Must Not Be Named has returned, and if you are too blind to see it the whole Ministry will fall.”
“No look, you’ve done it!” said Hermione, holding up the matchstick for an inspection and then pausing. “Wait, are we doing needle to match or match to needle?”
“Once we have the locket, we’ll need the diary,” said Harry, turning to the blond. “Malfoy reckons it’s in his family’s possession like the cup was, so it’s either at the Manor or the second property, Wisteria Hall, where we believe Voldemort to be hiding out. Once Cedric is back from the castle, he and Malfoy will head to the Manor first as the less heavily guarded location,”
Draco looked innocently between the two professors, as McGonagall straightened her glasses and cast a glance at the silent Potions Master before saying, “Well yes, we will need to gather the Prefects tomorrow and discuss the best way to support the other students during this time. However our request of you tonight is something altogether separate.”
“What’s the matter?” asked Draco, hesitating by the door.
“Would you think more of me if it was?”
Harry sighed, rubbing at his eyes under his glasses. “There is no alternative. We have to get the diary in order to even have a chance at facing Voldemort. Limiting our search to the two most likely places that it could be hidden is the smartest option, especially while we have the element of surprise on our side.”
“Hm, makes sense,” mused Draco. He didn’t care a lick about broken muggle bones, but when it came to financial return, he was all ears. “If less than half a percent of the population is magical — and I assume the concentration is similar in the US — then we’re talking what, 250 million individuals in your non-magical customer base versus a million in the magical population?”
At a curt knock on the door, a dishevelled looking Cedric pushed his way in, making the others in the room jump.
“Since when do you care? He wasn’t even a part of our lives until you dragged us to that bloody Ministry gala.” Draco snapped, unsure why he was picking a fight.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” said Draco. He sounded serious, but his fingers twitched nervously. “It’s no secret that the Malfoys stand for pure-blood ideals, and yes, we have influence in less savoury circles, but my father was exonerated of any involvement in the First Wizarding War. Instead of trying to ostracise me, why don’t we put the knowledge I have to good use?”
As he showed Harry the memory, he was horrified by the callousness with which he regarded this woman. But in the memory itself, Draco let his ambition supersede his compassion. He was called on first to perform the Cruciatus Curse, and he intended to set an example.
“Where do they have those Jaffa cakes I like?” asked Draco in an attempt to steer the conversation from going down a dangerous path.
Snape looked at him bewildered for a moment and then made a break for it, trying to push past him to get at the basin.
“Pansy,” said Draco, trying to mask his surprise as quickly as possible. “No need to wait up for me darling, I wouldn’t want to be the reason you’re losing sleep.”
at the nearest building, causing chunks of brick to sail into the air and sending another Death Eater flying. Draco urged the Thestral around, towards the head of the pack. The animal’s wings beat the air, its breath coming in clouds of mist, and he gripped its mane to steady himself.
“I was just leaving,” he said, grabbing his gloves. “Potter is out cold, but he’s alright. Luna can fill you in.”
“No, no, this won’t do. We’ll never find one here,” the portrait muttered, angrily striking out a sentence.
Snape whirled around, shimmering cloak flapping behind him like a giant silver bat.
Voldemort suddenly burst into a strange shrill laugh that chilled Harry to his bones.
“But the Ministry are the ones keeping us safe from Dark Magic,” said Hermione. “If they’ve been compromised, our entire way of life may be at risk. What could we do in the face of all that?”
“Hilarious,” said Draco, mirthlessly. “Just like Potter to be joking around when we’ve got a serious game to play here.”
, share stories about the other students in the castle, or just generally take Harry’s mind off things.
“Stop saying the name,” snapped Draco, smacking his hand on the table and making the others jump. “Do you realise what you’re implying? That a mere teacher acting on his own could bring about the return of one of the most powerful wizards of all time and then keep him hidden for years? It’s preposterous.”
“But if it’s been missing for decades, how will we find it?” pondered Luna.
“I can ask,” said Harry lightly, in case he had to play it off as a joke. “I can speak to snakes.”
How in Merlin’s name was this girl, of all people, able to break Dumbledore’s Fidelius Charm, wondered Draco. He’d been kicking himself for days that he still wasn’t any closer to controlling the information about Harry, while this sixth-year had somehow wandered into him on a whim and a daydream.
“I’ll get you to cast
“It’s best if we go in the proper order. All the research shows that compounding magic leads to better efficacy,” said Hermione with little conviction. “Although Harry’s magic is uniquely temperamental.”
“Shrub has tried her best, sir,” said the house-elf, blinking back tears in her protuberant eyes. “But sir is not moving from the basin’s edge, sir.”
“He was a mad old wizard,” said Draco. “But brilliant.”
“I’m just saying... I’m happy it worked out for you and all. I just can’t help but think that getting laid once in a while would do you a world of good,” said Pansy, tucking her dark bob neatly behind her ears. “All this secrecy, it can’t be good for a person.”
“Well, if we assume he was a pure-blood, that will limit the pool of potential suspects substantially,” said Hermione. “The war was pretty much fought over the point.”
“Blast! Are you sure?” said Hermione, accepting the locket and turning it over in her hands. “Neville was so convinced. And he said Dumbledore practically gave his life for it. That has to mean something.”
“Perhaps you should ask him yourself,” said Snape.
The snake poked its little diamond head out of the pocket, making a light noise like dry leaves skittering over pavement. Harry chuckled.
“Only you could play yourself and lose, Potter,” drawled Draco, eyeing the setup on the board. “If white moves her rook, you’ll have a chance at the Queen.”
“Right,” said Pansy, a knowing smile creeping across her lips.
The crowd erupted in Slytherin chants as Draco held the Snitch aloft. But Draco’s eyes went straight to the Regents box, where they met the cool gaze of his father. Lucius would later tell Draco how disappointed he was that he would have certainly lost the match if it hadn’t been for the stray Bludger. Draco quickly pushed Harry out of his memory before he had a chance to register the sinking feeling of disappointment.
“I mean you still ought to tell me,” she said, returning the embrace. “I am your girlfriend after all.”
“That’s just the thing – it’s a Muggle remedy.” Hermione flipped through the heavily dogeared pages, handing it over to Harry on one that bore the heading
“This is pointless, Hermione,” said Harry, scrubbing his hands through his hair. “The new wand isn’t working, the stupid match isn’t even pointy yet, and I still can’t understand why I need to learn this spell in the first place when you’re supposed to be teaching me defensive magic. Can’t we move on to curses already?”
His head popped up to look at Draco again, “As I say, my good chap, I am in the muse’s grip, currently writing my magnum opus. If you have a few moments, would you care to advise on a bit of iambic pentameter?”
“To date, no information on the whereabouts of Mrs Longbottom has been uncovered, and the case remains under active investigation. The Auror Department did not respond to requests for comment.”
Snape chuckled unexpectedly. “If I didn’t play the memories out in the Pensieve, I would only play them over and over in my mind. Madness would find me just the same.”
Of all the things Angelica knew, this was one area she was still in the dark. All for the better. If he was going to follow through with the promise that he made to Potter earlier in the night, he’d have to keep Angelica out of the details.
“No, it’s not that, it’s just, well, everyone knows how your parents died, don’t they?”
But Harry already knew exactly what it was.
“I had put a few of these pieces together once I became suspicious of Al’s identity, but nothing like this,” said Harry, shaking his head as he glanced at the contents of the trunk. “We should get this in front of Hermione, she’d know what to do with it.”
“I can’t lose him, Hermione,” said Harry, helplessly. “I just can’t.”
“Why’s that?” asked Harry, pulling the robes over his head and repositioning his glasses on his nose.
“No, well let me spell it out for you,” said Snape, in a voice of cold control. “The world’s fear of the Dark Lord is predicated on the fact that no one has ever stood against him and lived. But someone did, someone survived a Killing Curse at his own hand and reduced him to a spectre. If the world were to find out that Potter exists, the world would know the truth – that the Dark Lord is but a mere man. Powerful, certainly, but mortal.”
The plan went as smoothly as could be expected. They made their way down to a decrepit old pub called the Hog’s Head, where a fire was roasting in a concealed sideroom. Given the musty smell and the suspicious look of the food as the group wove their way between grimy tables, Harry wasn’t surprised that the clientele looked as questionable as the old barkeep.
He was met with booming laughter from Mr DuPont, who slapped a knee and said, “That’s good! I’m gonna steal that one.”
Harry had learned more about Draco’s past in the last few days than in all of the months they’d been friends at Hogwarts. It wasn’t like the curated memories he’d been shown before either, it was honest and vulnerable and frankly embarrassing at times.
“I know,” said Pansy, ladling a measure of purple liquid into a phial for marking. “We’re all busy. Normally when you’re busy with you-know-what we hear about it, but you haven’t given us an update in ages. Maybe I’m just eager for information about what’s going on.”
“I agree,” said Cedric. “Which is why I’m sure he wasn’t acting alone. I’d wager he met You-Know-Who the year he went travelling, maybe even went looking for him. He offered his body as host and brought him back, bringing him straight to Hogwarts where the Philosopher’s Stone was hidden. And when he couldn’t get that he was forced to run, living off of unicorn blood while he supported his master.”
Harry scrambled to a sitting position, leaning on his elbows to return Luna’s stare. “What does he—”
“You keep telling me it’s this amazing sport,” said Harry, settling back into his chair, a challenge in his expression. “But to be honest I can’t see what all the fuss is about. I mean, can’t you pretty much just chalk every game up to the Seeker?”
“We’ll see,” said Harry, returning the challenge as he took his duelling stance. “I’m a quick learner.”
“You don’t? She seemed to know you,” said Cedric, pulling a black notebook out of the pockets of his robes and flicking to the last page. “If that was a Ministry agent looking for you, the department will be all over me. Here it is – tall girl, red hair, goes by Lois Lane.”
Yes, here was the question he’d been waiting for. If he could get Pansy curious about the boy he and Hermione had been walking around with, maybe he could get her to guess the details of the Fidelius. That was, after all, why he’d steered them towards where he knew she’d be after Charms.
“How fortunate that you had such foresight so many years ago,” said Draco, forcing an appreciative smile at his father. “And this ‘trust.’ What was it that proved our loyalty in the Dark Lord’s eyes – a sacrifice? Or a deed of service? Perhaps the protection of a valuable object…?”
“It’s not looking good, Harry,” called Cedric as he strained to hold the shield. “We need to get out of here. They’ll decimate us if they tip the scales much farther.”
It was all a drone beneath the sound of Draco’s pounding heart as he turned on his heel and left the dungeon, promising himself he wouldn’t end up like the man he’d once revered as a mentor, and respected as a friend.
“Couldn’t have hurt,” said Harry. “Sure would have made finding this place a hell of a lot easier.”
“You think you already know what I want?”
“That’s true,” said Hermione, cutting her plate up into little bites. “I don’t know half the wizards who could learn as much magic as you’ve done these past few weeks.”
Pansy put her orange down with a thud.
“Thank you for your transparency, Draco. I’m sure you can understand,” said Voldemort, crooking his finger at Nagini, who returned to place her giant head in his lap. “You’re dismissed.”
“The others are worried,” said Draco at last.
“She really likes you,” said Harry.
“The late Headmaster speaks for himself, I see,” said Umbridge, her lip curling as she stepped around the desk to face the serene portrait. “And why is that?”
and the fire roared up like a column high into the chimney, washing them in a wave of heat and igniting the few other candles that dotted the room.
The restaurant was full of run-of-the-mill muggle families seated for dinner of pasta and breadsticks. Some of them looked up as the elegantly dressed group walked between the red and white chequered tablecloths, but most continued eating. That was muggles for you, happy to remain ignorant.
But at the same moment, Draco cast a “
“You don’t say,” muttered Harry.
“Brave words for a man who didn’t know he was carrying a wizard’s chess set.”
Again nothing. Hermione let out a groan of exasperation.
“While the group’s aims are aligned with my own, it just makes sense.”
Glancing at the board Harry reached out a hand, and moved a white pawn forward to E4.
“Muggle fashion,” said Hermione through peals of laughter. “No wonder wizards can’t blend in in the real world.”
“She checked it first.”
“Sorry gang,” said Harry bashfully, rubbing the back of his neck. “Gemma and I got caught up getting ready”
“Out of the goodness of my heart, of course.” Draco flashed her a signature smile for good measure.
Draco met her gaze and there was something sad in her eyes. “Go on,” she continued. “If you can only have one night, let it be tonight.”
“For Merlin’s sake, Harry, hold still!”
Harry hardly knew how to respond. This woman, whom he had so long sought the approval of, and so long despised, was showing him a type of maternal affection that he had craved for years. He hated her, but he also wasn’t sure if he could really leave. Privet Drive was, after all, the only home he’d ever known.
“A wizard keeping tabs on you and he never let it slip? He must have been trying hard to keep it a secret,” said Draco, his eyes lingering on a bishop before deciding to choose a less obvious attack and considering a pawn instead.
“Alright,” said Harry, taking his stance and casting a “
The others seemed thrilled to be kicking on with the search, but only Draco noticed the slight shift in Harry’s demeanour. Where he was usually brimming with ideas, he instead chose to listen while Cedric and Hermione babbled on about the possible methods for obtaining and destroying the final Horcruxes. Where Draco was normally rewarded with a broad smile when he made a joke or a sly comment, they now only won him a tight-lipped nod.
. Draco clenched his fists and screamed as the Dark Lord laughed. He hated himself for his weakness.
Harry let go of his arm and took a step back. “I get it. It’s fine. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn’t want to be with me either.”
“If you please, Professor. How much are you really expecting us to teach him in a few weeks’ time? We’ve spent nearly seven years here and we’re still mastering the finer points of our study.”
“A smokescreen can be useful to confuse your opponent,” said Cedric as he was consumed by fog and only his voice could be heard echoing down the corridor. “And gives you an offensive advantage as well.”
“Sounds like more evidence of a guilty conscience to me,” said Harry, laying the book to the side and returning his focus to the mimbletonia, slouched over in its now too-big pot.
“I’ve been holding on to this prisoner for a special occasion,” said Voldemort as Charlotte approached, and he reached out to run his pale fingers through a lock of her hair.
“Which ones?” asked Draco, craning his neck to see the letter and nearly toppling her mug in the process.
“Draco, do you know what’s going on?” asked Pansy in a hushed tone.
“Oh, well accidental magic happens regularly for children before they begin their magical education, but they usually grow out of it while they’re young,” said Hermione, seeming to choose her words carefully. “Does that always happen when you try to access your magic?”
“Good, the clarity has definitely improved,” said Draco. Getting ready to steer the conversation back towards early childhood memories.
Luna crossed her arms. “You once released a boa constrictor at the zoo and it told you it was going home to Brazil.”
“I have but—” started Harry.
“It’s not my secret to tell the others,” said Harry, letting out a sigh of frustration. “Yeah, it’s bloody awful what you did with that woman, but I’m sure the person I saw casting that curse isn’t the one I know. At least I want to be sure of it.”
“Look at this, Draco,” she beckoned him over and wrapped one warm, loving arm around him. “Can you see him? Gently now.”
Draco got unsteadily to his feet. “My pleasure. Master.” Draco had to force the word through his teeth, before he turned and left the room.
“Peace at the price of freedom?”
“He must have really cared about you,” said Luna, plucking a bit of meat off of her plate for Ivy.
“Well, there were a fair few about Minnie and Rube and a collection of crazy old bats that liked to play tricks on each other,” said Harry, laughing to himself at the memory. “One time Rube bought an illegal lizard and tried to keep it hidden, but it grew so big it destroyed Pam’s garden. Al had to replant a hundred turnips by hand.”
Meanwhile, the progress on the Horcrux plan was maddeningly slow.
Blaise scoffed, Theo nodded supportively, and Pansy showed a flicker of genuine concern as she laid a hand on Draco’s arm.
“Harry, we’re here for you,” said Luna. “What do you want us to do next?”
Draco recognised the sound of distaste in Snape’s voice. A guest at the castle on the night of Dumbledore’s death was curious, but not altogether surprising. Surely every Auror worth their salt would be champing at the bit to investigate the strange affair.
Hermione froze as well. “You mean…”
“Can’t imagine they’ll be worth the time,” drawled Pansy. “Is that why you were with her the other day?”
“What visions?” Hermione looked up abruptly from the stack of crime scene photos.
“What do you mean it picks an owner?” asked Harry, realising the wand, like his room, may have a life of its own.
But where he had failed in ascertaining certain memories, he would succeed in breaking the Fidelius. After all, no matter how much time they’d spent tangled up in each other’s memories, it didn’t change the fact that Draco had a task to do.
“Are you serious?” laughed Harry, throwing his hands in the air. “Football is one of the most challenging sports out there. Some people say it’s an art form.”
Harry knew better than to ask questions at this point. He quickly placed a few slices of meat in a napkin and trailed after Luna, taking one backwards glance at his room before following her into the chill of the corridor.
“But we’ve gotten more than that,” said Harry, the light from the fire catching in his glasses as he looked around at the group. “In every other world that could have been, one thing was consistent: If Voldemort wins, the whole world will be taken over, magical and Muggle alike. And I, for one, will not let that happen.”
But that was long ago. Back when they could be best friends without worrying about which one of them the Dark Lord would choose.
he cried out, feeling a blast erupt from his wand and strike Charlotte who screamed and writhed. Seeing the pain in her face, the spell faltered and she was released into a heap on the floor.
“So I checked out a book, I don’t see what this proves,” said Draco. “I was—”
“Hard to be jealous of a guy who takes girls down to the broom shed for a—”
“But then what?” said Hermione, more obstinate than anxious now. “Even if this works and we get both relics back to the house, we still have to figure out how to destroy them. I’ve been looking into the Fiendfyre spell and I don’t think it’s a feasible option, it’s incredibly hard to control and many experienced wizards have died attempting it.”
Draco’s eyes again flicked to Harry. “It is if you can achieve prolonged life,” he said. “If you can store a piece of your soul somewhere safe, you double your chance of survival from the fates.”
She pictured James and Lily in their last moments. They were students merely a few years ago. She couldn’t imagine leaving their son in the hands of these people.
First things first, thought Draco, turning to head back to the dormitories for a few Extendable Ears. He’d need to know what the teachers were saying; McGonagall was bound to know something.
“And the pure-blood sentiment had nothing to do with it?” asked Draco distractedly, still trying to understand how it all fit together.
Harry froze. His eyes narrowed like he was trying to see through a disguise.
“And he’s powerful. They say wizards with the strongest magic come from Slytherin house,” said Hermione.
“What does the Ministry care what Al was up to? That sounds like a total overstep,” said Harry, drumming his fingers in thought. “Unless they suspect some kind of connection to Voldemort. What does Hermione say?”
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling suddenly self-conscious. “Couldn’t you hear her?”
she asked drily, though she knew full well that there was no witch or wizard alive capable of withholding secrets from this man.
“Brilliant,” said Draco dryly.
,” he said in a clear voice, with a light slashing of his wand. A bolt of red sparks shot forward and arced to the end of the room, illuminating the targets at the end and then fizzling out as they hit the floor.
“It’s true,” said Draco. Hermione’s head snapped in his direction. “He’s a Parselmouth. I’ve seen it in his memories.”
“About time you got here,” said a lanky redhead in Muggle clothes, who sauntered to the bar and pulled out two pint glasses. “You were about to miss happy hour.”
“Wow, I never thought I would be glad about knowing someone with Death Eater relatives,” said Hermione, who was positively beaming.
“That’s what got me thinking – from what you’ve told me, the bursts only happen when you’re emotionally charged. The woman who solved the case similar to yours was a psychologist, Dr Weaver.”
“Do you consent or not?” demanded Harry, his voice rising. “It is my wish that he be freed.”
He turned to look at Harry who was sitting up as well, round frames catching the moonlight, and offering him a slight smile.
Draco stared out over the London wasteland and tried to remain steady on his feet. It wasn’t just London, but the world?
Harry’s expression melted from annoyance to apprehensive interest almost immediately as he accepted the paper. “What’s Quidditch?” he asked, looking at a live table of scores. “Sounds like a card game or something.”
“You just love being right,” joked Cedric. “The magic on this certainly feels strong enough to be a Horcrux. I’d say we’re damn lucky that Malfoy pays attention to the contents of his vaults.”
“Yes, of course, it’s all my fault as usual.” Pansy took a brusque sip from her cup and then placed it down again with a clatter. “I mean, call me crazy, but I thought we were enjoying ourselves. Far be it from me to feel concern over someone who showed the faintest desire to be our friend. I’m sure I don’t have to remind you it doesn’t always come easy for us. Harry wouldn’t be the first to forget everything our families have done.”
“That is yet to be decided. But for tonight, our course of action is clear. Under the charm, none of us will be able to reveal Harry’s location, or even the fact that we have seen him alive. Tomorrow the
“That’s quite enough of that, I think,” she said, sounding vexed. “We all had our own reasons for coming here, but that doesn’t change our position now. No one besides us knows what Voldemort is doing or what his weaknesses are. If any of us thought this would be easy, we’re fooling ourselves, but it’s not impossible. Unless we fall apart.”
Draco caught sight of the bloody bandages that he knew covered a ripper of a necrosis curse. Yaxley’s specialty. He shuddered to think how much worse it could have been. Which was stupid really – it was his own fault that Potter was nearly apprehended by the Death Eaters.
Draco couldn’t let Harry find out who was at Wisteria Hall before he’d had a chance to explain himself.
“It is, though,” said Hermione, her pace quickening. “Muggles spend their whole lives building solutions for things wizards can accomplish without raising a finger. He means it as an insult, and I would be offended if I were you.” Hermione came to a stop at an arched wooden door so abruptly that Harry almost ran into her as she was knocking.
The muggle suit in question had been Potter’s direction for the night’s dress code, as Aparecium was in the heart of muggle London. He’d chosen a slim cut, navy suit which had cost him a weekend’s worth of Quidditch winnings and had damned well better be worth it. Under normal circumstances, he would have ignored Potter’s instructions and gone with a nicer set of dress robes, but after the surprising events of the golf weekend, he was finding himself more inclined to go along with Potter’s suggestions. Given the glances that he and Pansy were receiving from the muggles who passed by their spot in the foyer, it had been the right call.
“Pretty much.” Harry directed his wand around the room, lighting up the far corners of the space. “Sometimes I can aim it if there’s a threat. But most of the time it just happens, like when Malfoy was forcing his way through my memories and then bam, next thing I know I’m in the shower.”
“Tell me they’ve gone past
“What on earth would the Minister want with a deceased wizard’s wand?” asked McGonagall.
Draco laughed. “Frankly, no. But as much as I hate to say it, you of all people are most likely to understand why we are currently speaking to my dead godfather who, I might add, is not a ghost.”
“I’m sure he’s not,” said Harry definitively. It didn’t do to dwell on the past. “There are some things no one can survive.”
Draco realised he had not said anything other than muttered thank you’s and was now standing with many eyes on him. Angelica gazed up expectantly, with her hand tightening slightly on his arm. Without another moment’s hesitation, he slipped back into character and wrapped a loving arm around Angelica, pulling her close and planting a chaste kiss on her forehead.
“I don’t,” said Draco in a huff.
Beyond which there was an annoying sense of guilt that weighed heavily on him as he remembered sharing memories with Potter. Flashes of his stupidly noble attempts at saving all the weaker creatures that stumbled across his path. A naïve sense of wonder every time he saw a new form of magic. The unquestioning trust he’d put in Draco to delve into the dark recesses of his memory.
“I’m sure he came in here,” said one voice. “Find him!”
“Let’s say I considered joining you,” said Harry slowly. “What then?”
Thinking he could see a shape through the fog, Harry dropped his shield to cast a Disarming spell, when he was hit with something nonverbal on his right knee and his leg went completely numb.
As Draco paged through, Greenacre continued in a bemused voice, “This one has been on my books for a long while. I remember it falling through. It was a devastating blow. We ended up not executing on the buyout, and the investors and the American partner company were furious.”
“Girlfriend?” asked Harry incredulously, before he could stop himself.
“It’s obvious,” said Angelia, flicking her long ponytail off her shoulder and then lacing her fingers together on her knee. “You are on the precipice of wizarding society. One wrong move and you will be living out your life on significantly different terms than you started it. And if I’m not very much mistaken, I don’t think your finances are faring too well either, judging by the state of the Manor. Moreover, you are the last of your bloodline. Quite an inconvenient position to be in for someone with no interest in women. What you need is a partner, a lineage, and a financial backer to lift you into your proper place in the world. How am I doing so far?”
He turned down the Transfiguration corridor, coming quickly up on McGonagall’s door, when the memory of an evil, high-pitched voice sounded in his mind. There was, of course, one other option. He could forget Potter and his stupid rebellion and save his mother instead. The only way to release himself from the Fidelius was to kill the Secret Keeper and become one.
“I was wondering. Why did the Dark Lord choose us?” he asked.
“Are you so determined to keep him from our kind that you would rather the world think him dead than see him placed with a loving wizarding family of no relation? Why even Sirius could—”
“Muggle studies. Really?” Hermione held up a book called
“Please, Draco. If you think I didn’t learn how to tell your lies years ago, you’re more of an idiot than I am,” she replied, brushing his hand away.
“Let me,” said Draco, taking Hermione’s place by the couch where they’d moved Cedric’s unconscious form. “I’m going to try and revive him. Check if we have any dittany on hand, he might have been poisoned.”
“Never better, Mr Borgin,” said Draco with a shallow nod. “You do well to keep an eye out for the activities of the brethren. Change is indeed on the horizon.”
“Charlotte walks free.”
“Go to another portrait then,” Harry grumbled, shoving his face into his pillowcase.
By the time he left for the evening, Draco was kicking himself for wasting the time on a romp down memory lane when he should have been pressing Harry about the green flash in what might have been his last chance to see it.
“That is not your concern,” said Draco, with complete composure. “Can you tell me the details of the enchantments?”
Hermione took another step forward, pressing the wand into his cheek. “Where did you hear that word?”
“Time for you to grow up and stop playing the hero, Potter,” spat Draco. “Some of us are beyond saving.”
“It does sound like it could have been a dream,” said Harry. Him, famous? Not a chance.
She hated when he called her professor outside of Hogwarts. It was one of his many small tells she had learned over the years; his use of the formality was a quiet reassurance of the natural order of things. Despite the tinkle of laughter in his voice, she had the genuine sense that Albus was afraid.
Darco could not remember being so relaxed as he was now. The sun was shining on the emerald lawns of the Manor. Dappled patches of light shone through the vines of wisteria on the gazebo overhead, and Angelica had been back in the US for about a week. He’d finally caught Pansy up on the events of the Aparecium night — as much as he could share at any rate.
“I need to speak with you,” he said, crossing over to the armchair and grabbing Harry by the wrist, pulling him into a standing position.
“I’m just trying to look out for you,” said Harry defensively.
Draco shot a last glance at Harry, whose green eyes flashed. Draco felt another pang in his chest and turned towards the door.
The group stayed close through the afternoon. Harry even found spare blankets in his wardrobe when it started getting colder and they sat together by the fire, wrapped up and hypothesising in low voices about what it could all mean. By the time Cedric returned from his vision, Harry was dreading what Draco would see.
It seemed everywhere Draco turned he could see the white blond head of his father, dressed in austere black robes and observing the game with an expression as icy as the weather. He would not be pleased with Draco’s two missed attempts to secure the Snitch, nor the abysmal performance of the team which would surely be attributed to his captaining skills. Moreover, he knew the piercing stare of his father had something to do with the tip-off he’d given his mother about the rendezvous point with Potter, but how much he knew Draco couldn’t be sure.
“Revealing the secrets of the universe?” asked Draco, putting his hands in the pockets of his robes and sauntering over to the window.
“Not sure what you’re hinting at, Granger,” said Draco, bumping her back. “I’ve always been known to appreciate the finer things in life.”
“This ought to be good,” said Harry, crossing his legs under him and sitting up straighter, ready to reach out into Draco’s memory.
“And Hermione didn’t vaporize you on the spot?” said Harry, sitting back in the chair.
“Well, we can’t know that for certain,” said McGonagall, her voice wavering. She had taught Sirius for seven years, seeing him grow up from a headstrong child into a headstrong adult. He’d separated from his family’s ideals years ago, hadn’t he? He would die for Lily and James, she was sure of it.
Draco smirked to himself. No wonder Granger was so dedicated to the cause. She wasn’t helping Harry out of her big Gryffindor heart; she wanted the recognition for her apprenticeship applications. Maybe Hermione had more tricks up her sleeve than he’d given her credit for.
At that moment Angelica was calling from the green to get their attention and Mr DuPont was setting up to take his shot.
Harry was relieved. He may never be the most accomplished wizard, but he had enough skill now to be a threat when the time came. And if Hermione was onboard with spell stacking, who knew what she’d be able to dream up for him.
She placed the tiara in Harry’s hands and he turned it; the gems catching the diffused light from the windows and sparkling wildly. Harry could feel the weight of powerful magic resonating in the object and somehow knew that Luna was on to something.
,” said a smooth voice, and Harry felt himself tipped forward into his own subconscious.
“Just about to leave,” said Harry, tight-lipped. “Don’t worry, you’ll never have to see me again.”
Harry’s glasses glinted in the moonlight from the window. “Want to talk about it?”
“No, I insist,” said Draco, stepping into Harry’s space. “How are you going to save me this time?”
Tonks was already giving instructions to the group, speaking in a calm, authoritative tone. She motioned for Draco to come with her as the strange crowd got to their feet and she led them out of the back entrance of the pub, which dissolved away into a darkening alley. Tonks held up her wand in a small
!” But again, the sparks seemed to run out of steam about halfway through.
Greenacre paused at this, seeming to consider how much to reveal, but carried on. “Lucius had developed a small fund of independent backers. A few personal acquaintances, business connections, that sort of thing.”
“Maybe we could take P and play it off like she and I will room together,” she suggested with a slow blink. He was suddenly struck with the mental image of Angelica attempting to look seductive in pink frilly underthings and a pouty face, and for the first time wondered if he’d be able to play believably interested.
A psychedelic guitar intro floated into the room as Harry turned around smiling. He and Draco had set up a pair of makeshift chairs by the window in Sirius’s room where they would sit as the snow fell and practice Legilimency.
“Look, I can hear the judgement in your voice, but it’s not like that,” said Draco. “You’ve seen my childhood. I’m expected to mix with a very specific group of people. Marry one of them, carry on the legacy, you know how it works.”
Tomorrow he would simply tell her that Harry had been plastered, and he’d stuck around to make sure he was alright. It was a good enough lie, and he could finesse it in the morning. Not like he needed to lie — Nothing had even happened with Potter in the end, much to his chagrin. He suppressed the memory of Potter avoiding his attentions, as a fresh wave of embarrassment rose in him, and opened the door to his room quietly.
Draco felt numb. He was pretty sure his mouth was open, but he couldn’t think of anything to say. Mr Dupont was casually wiping at a smudge on one of his clubs before selecting it and taking a few practice swings through the air.
The memory of her support still glowed warmly in his mind – she had been one of the only figures to really believe in him, and to expect nothing in return. She’d been the one to dub him a strategist.
“Alright, here,” said Draco, positioning himself opposite Harry and laying a hand on his shoulder. “Next best thing.”
“Are you really going to say no to this?” she said, slowly untying the fluffy robe and shrugging it off her shoulders to reveal a matching lacy black bra and panty set.
“If it were me I’d want to make sure I was learning the spells that had the best chance of keeping me alive.”
“Hermione, you legend!” said Harry, diving into the stack and pulling out Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, and Mission Impossible.
McGonagall fumed silently, keeping her chin up with dignity as the Aurors stepped back and Umbridge turned to face her prey.
“Excellent,” said DuPont. “This is your veteran friend, Draco?”
“What is this memory you would do anything to get lost in?”
“Do you ever regret the path you chose?”
He had tried alluding to Potter, using pseudonyms, even sharing an anecdote about their training that didn’t name Potter, but all his attempts were met with a burning headache and momentary confusion until he stopped writing. It seemed the charm even knew when he was being deceptive about the secret.
By the time Saturday rolled around, Harry was on much better footing with Hermione. Draco’s tactics were working a treat and Hermione was so pleased that Harry was perfecting his Levitation Charm and not pushing on the order of the curriculum, that she skipped forward a full day’s lesson to teach him softening charms, which Harry thought were about as useful as match to needle Transfiguration, but he put on a good face anyway.
“Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have all the answers, but I think Dr Weaver identified a link between the physiological and the magical that no other doctor has fully explored. It may give us a clue about your burst magic, but I can leave the book with you if you want to learn more.”
He returned the hug, grateful that no matter the timeline he would have found Hermione as a friend.
Draco must have been thinking the same thing. “I’m free for the rest of the evening if you want to spend a bit of time on it, Potter,” said Draco easily. His long form, dressed in black, leaned propped up against the dark window, arms crossed.
“Yes, you’re right,” he said absently
Draco and Snape shared a look, but Draco could read nothing in his teacher’s face. He swallowed hard. If the Fidelius was still intact yet the Dark Lord knew of Potter’s return, Draco had somehow found himself the missing link, unable to reveal what he knew.
“I’m afraid that is one thing I can not do,” said Voldemort, settling back into his chair and looking quite suspicious. “Draco betrayed me and for that he was punished in equal measure.”
“Oh?” said McGonagall, looking between the two boys and clearly trying to steer the conversation back towards introductions. “I hope Miss Granger hasn’t done anything to put you off magic?” she joked.
“Sorry,” said Harry, helping him into a sitting position. “I’ve been busy saving your arse.”
“Oh dear, now how was this missed?” said Lockhart, sweeping back to his desk in a flurry of lilac robes and looking more concerned than he had been when Neville had flat out fainted a few minutes ago. “Students! Please. Turn to page 167, paragraph three. There is an egregious error in here where it says I brazenly approached the horde’s encampment, when I’m positive it should say I
“Kreacher wishes to fight,” said Kreacher. “For Master Regulus and for Master Draco.”
“For that, I have to show you.”
“But Albus, that’s preposterous.” She was sputtering, blinking back at him incredulously as he unwrapped another sherbet lemon and popped it in his mouth. “How can you be so calm about all this? Lily and James have just been struck down in the prime of their lives. This is not some lost puppy we’re talking about, it’s a child.”
called Harry, drawing his wand in a wide arc across the room and watching the red sparks shoot down the end of the corridor until – There! The sparks bounced back off of a shape in the fog and Harry had a split second to cast a powerful
Harry looked up from the note with unshed tears in his eyes. Draco on the other hand was shocked.
“What was that creature, anyway?” asked Harry, remembering the chill that had seemed to suck the warmth out of his bones as it approached.
“See? The diadem can offer us a glimpse into another world for answers, but we have to know where to look. I only saw a piece of the world from where I was, but Harry,” Luna held the diadem out to him. “You might see everything.”
said Harry, feeling the pressure of Charlotte’s gaze.
Luna buried her nose in
Hermione got to explaining the history of the house ghosts when, turning down a narrow hallway lit by lamps, they nearly ran into a pretty witch about their age with porcelain skin and dark black hair cut short around her shoulders.
“Run and fetch the ‘55 Bordeaux, will you?” He summoned four crystal glasses from the sideboard, which came whizzing into his hand as he turned to the others. “I’ve always wanted a reason to open this.”
“Your mother indicated that you were interested in taking over the family’s affairs with Lucius... indisposed?” said Greengrass, slowly.
“So you tell me, Granger. Is it better to have all our secrets out in the open?” said Draco, closing in. “Because I for one feel great.”
She silently wished that wizarding Britain would minimise their chances of exposure by keeping to themselves, or better yet ceasing their celebrations altogether. She was not yet convinced there was anything to be celebrating, but the wizard she was waiting for would know more.
Leave it to Loony to be predicting the future off of a magazine column. Meanwhile, Neville was wheezing and looked a pale green, but was slowly rising to his feet with the help of Dean and Seamus under each arm.
“So happy for you both,” said Pansy, coming close to kiss him on the cheek and whisper in his ear, “what a relief!”
“Pure-bloods you mean,” said Harry.
Harry paused a beat. “Is there a reason you’re avoiding teaching me Occlumency?” he asked.
A dawning realisation spread across McGonagall’s face. “I see. You no longer report to the Minister do you? There is a different master you serve,” said McGonagall scornfully as Umbridge’s lips twisted. “Shame on you, Dolores. If this world falls, it will not be without blood on your hands. You will pay for your sins.”
But as Harry whirled around to face him it wasn’t anger in his face, it was disbelief.
“And I suppose it’s just better to walk around looking exactly the same as everyone else, is it?”
“I thought you might be feeling that way, so I picked up a few of these from my parents’ house. I couldn’t send them by owl of course.” She dropped her school bag on the coffee table with a heavy thunk and opened it up to reveal a stack of worn VHS tapes.
,” she said, twisting her fingers together nervously. “And we haven’t managed to get Harry a proper wand yet.”
“Cedar and…” Harry couldn’t recall.
Hagrid blinked in response and then his beard split into a wide grin and he broke into deep barks of laughter, as though he understood this to be some sort of joke.
“I’m sure you mean to say, ‘wow, what quick thinking, Malfoy. Well done for covering for us so Potter could make his way through the castle without being seen,’” said Malfoy, lazily turning a page.
“Oh,” said Hermione, looking like she didn’t have an argument to make for once, and grabbing Harry by the crook of the elbow, took a few fast paces to catch up with Malfoy. “Well alright, but whatever we do we better go quickly.”
“But I couldn’t find their nest. It was hidden somehow,” continued Luna, as though Hermione hadn’t spoken. “It was really the snake that led me there.”
Suddenly the kettle started a high-pitched whistle and a woman’s voice from upstairs called, “Draco, would you get that for me?”
“I guess I just don’t see the point in keeping secrets,” said Draco. “Not from you anyway. Now that you know what I am.”
“Right,” he said. He was deluding himself if he thought for a second Draco wanted to spend time with him at three o’clock in the bloody morning.
“Not yet,” said Tonks, gripping his shoulder with encouragement. “Follow me.”
“Oh, I quite agree,” said Voldemort. “Which is why I’m making this offer. I want nothing to do with the girl, you want to see her freed, it’s a fair exchange. I will even guarantee her safety if it means something to you.”
Once again, nothing is mine!!
“Yes please.” Severus smiled at his pun and pulled out his wand. He tapped a pattern onto the stones and stood back as the stones began to rearrange themselves into the archway.
“Since I am no longer needed, I will show myself out. I am glad you are safe, Harry.” Severus looked up at Remus. Remus could see that he was struggling with himself. Severus set Harry up and turned him so he was looking towards Remus.
“Severus Snape's office.” As the Floo connected he could hear Minerva's voice from the classroom.
“Can... can I have the blanket back. The one that I had when you found me?” Severus blinked in surprise. That was not what he was expecting.
(See the end of the chapter for
+++++
But first, he needed to put their home back together, and tell Minerva that he would not be able to teach classes the rest of the day.
Draco wrapped up his story as his mother came into the room. As hyper as Draco was, he knew that his mother was very no nonsense when it came to school work. She had no problem taking away his favorite things if he didn't pay attention to his studies.
“I can tell, Lupin. I know my son.” Severus muttered. Severus watched Harry for a moment, then gestured for Harry to come over.
Harry woke up the next morning, confused about where he was. At least, he thought it was morning. It was very dark in the room, but he was warm and the blankets were soft. After a moment, he remembered the events of the previous night. He smiled to himself, and looked up at the ceiling. He wished that he could see what was glowing up there, but even blurry it was pretty. Harry snapped his fingers to turn the light on, then did it again a couple of times to turn the lights off and on again just because he could,  and then slid out from the covers. He pulled them back up, making the bed neatly the way that he had learned at Aunt Petunia's house before walking across the room and peering around the door into the living room area.
“Harry, you know that I always try to be honest with you, right? And that I try to tell you everything that I can, even if it’s a little complicated?” Harry nodded, his solemn little boy.
“The gargoyle said that it wasn’t time for me to meet Dumbledore yet, so I think we are going to be fine. We are almost there.” Severus gave Harry a weak smile as Harry led Severus to the gargoyle at the bottom of Dumbledore’s tower.
The rest of the evening went per their normal routine until after Severus was sure that Harry was asleep. As soon as he heard the soft snoring of his son, he called Tippy.
“It kind of felt like... when you try to push two magnets together on the wrong sides, and they push away from each other.” Narcissa swallowed hard and nodded. She knew that no one in this house could do wandless magic. She knew that the Dark Lord had been able to, and there were rumours that Grindelwald and Dumbledore both could. She knew that she was going to have to speak with Lucius and Severus. Magic training for Harry would need to happen much sooner than she expected.
“You can teach me to do that, yeah? I wanna learn to do it too!” Harry looked startled.
“Hey there, how are you feeling?” Harry blinked a couple of times, and his eyes filled with tears before he launched himself at his father.
“What on…” Minerva was going to exclaim about his presence here in the castle, but spotted the bruise developing along the side of Harry’s face and cut lip and she puffed up like an angry cat. “Oh, oh no…” She looked back at Severus. “What are you waiting for?!?” She began to make her way in the direction of the Hospital ward, making it clear to Severus that she was going with him to help Harry. Smirking internally, Severus followed. There was nothing like having the Transfiguration professor and Deputy Headmistress in your corner. As they walked up to the doors to the ward, Severus disillusioned Harry again, in case there were students already in the ward.
Not all had fared as well. The future for Draco’s father still hung in the balance; his trial would be forthcoming over the following months, along with several other Death Eaters who were apprehended or turned themselves over to the Order. The rest of Voldemort’s followers were still being pursued by the Ministry, including the man called Wormtail, who had managed to escape capture under mysterious circumstances.
If everything was going to plan, he’d be hearing from his mother via firecall any minute. And if things had not gone according to plan, he would almost certainly be hearing from his father.
The door opened to reveal a bare room with tall ceilings and three long windows which cast beams of light on the pale floor. The walls were a cream coloured sandstone, curving into a dome shape overhead. At first, Harry thought the room was empty, but then he saw that on the floor was a lone object: a dingy silver tiara encrusted with sapphires.
“Not experimental
“Never,” said Draco. “But that’s just an exercise to get you familiar with the properties of an object. Will you ever need to transform something wooden into something metal? That’s the question.”
“To be honest, Professor, I’m concerned,” said Hermione. “So far Harry’s magic seems extremely temperamental. One minute he’s struggling to maintain a steady glow on a
“Wait a minute, at least stay a while,” said Harry, grabbing him by the shoulder. “We were just catching up. Have a seat, change out of your robes, you look like you’re heading to a funeral.”
“Then we’ll figure out how to get our hands on some Basilisk venom,” said Harry impatiently. “But that’s not the objective of this mission. The longer we wait, the greater chances that Voldemort fortifies his defences on the remaining Horcruxes. It’ll work, it has to.”
Harry turned to look at him, realising his expression was not his usual smirk but a deep, honest gaze.
“Only that I think he saw a lot in you once too,” said Harry, with a shrug. “But he’d have been disappointed to have seen how far you’ve fallen.”
“You know Hagrid of all people is actually into golf these days. I visited him earlier this summer, and he’d set up a small green down by the forest. Would you believe he set one of the holes near the whomping willow? Nearly took my head off when I was putting.”
“Really? A great Legilimens like you didn’t know the motivation behind the act that would lead to his master’s demise?” asked Draco, an air of challenge to his voice.
“The Wheel of Fortune?” Draco read from the card. This was one he had not seen before.
“Can you see if she wants to come home with us?” asked Charlotte.
He and Luna tried asking the room for Horcruxes a few more times, but the room failed to appear. It materialised once when they requested a lost object of great value, but the room was so stacked full of towers of objects floor to ceiling that they didn’t bother.
Even when Harry was on his own with Ivy, he felt strangely at ease. He hadn’t had a vision through Voldemort’s eyes in weeks, and his bursts of magic had all but disappeared. Even his dreams had shifted from fantasies of his old life to a certain blond, flitting around on a broom over a dark grassy pitch.
“Draco?” said the witch, startled.
He and Charlotte abandoned their bikes in the car park and jogged to the ticket counter, where a particularly bored looking teen served them half-heartedly. Harry was reluctant to part with the cash that for so long had been destined for greater things, but sharing a tight smile with Charlotte they accepted two tickets from the spotty youth and made a beeline for their track.
“Er, no. You haven’t” said Harry, placing his fork back down.
“That is all banking on there not being Dementors coming after us,” said Cedric.
“Powerful curse, this,” he remarked, half to himself.
“The worst part is that the rumours of the Dark Lord are increasing, fuelled by horror stories from the
“Oh er, he was back at the school too,” lied Harry, not sure he was ready yet to face the truth of what Draco had been in the other timeline. “It was like everything had progressed as it was supposed to except… there was no Fidelius. I think the diadem showed me what the world could have been if I’d come to Hogwarts when I was meant to.”
“Of course.” Severus took the tapestry to the wall opposite from the door and put it up on the wall with a sticking charm. Shadow chose that moment to saunter into the room, inspecting everything with little chirps of what sounded like approval. He jumped onto Harry's best and walked towards where Harry and Severus were standing on the other side. He didn't realize that he was being stalked by the tiny dragon figurine, who had abandoned it's ribbon for something more interesting.
A shuddered breath from the other side of the yard caught his attention, and he quietly made his way in that direction, listening for any noise that might indicate a dog or cat that would give away his position. As he moved closer, he could hear the sound of chattering teeth, and knew that it wasn’t a dog he was going to find. A heavy feeling in his chest was all the warning that he got that something was wrong before he realized what he was looking at. Lying under the bushes in the corner of the yard was a tiny child wrapped in a threadbare blanket. Messy black hair stuck out from the edges where the boy had wrapped the blanket around his head. This left his feet uncovered, and the boy had curled up as small as he could in an attempt to get as much of himself under the blanket as possible.  The boy shivered and his teeth chattered, but he didn’t wake up.
At this point, Draco had a great idea. He looked around his room. Maybe Harry could come over, and Draco could show him all his toys, and the gardens, and the stables with all the horses and Pegasi... Draco realized that Harry could be his best friend. WOULD be his best friend. He was often frustrated with how quiet his room was, and the house elves wouldn't play with him because they all had WORK to do. Draco had a plan.
The creature was like nothing that Harry had ever seen before. It had large, bright blue eyes and enormous ears that wiggled independently of each other.  It's loose skin and long, pointed nose kind of liked like an old man, and it appeared to be wearing a tea towel, wrapped around itself like a dress.
Lucius looked over at Narcissa, who was fingering the tear in her skirt and looking thoughtfully at the fire.
“You know I would never do anything…” Severus cut in.
Severus talks to Harry about Remus, and goes outside his comfort zone to make an ally.
“Lucius...”
“I... I have a dragon like that at home. “ Harry said quietly. Draco grinned.
“Well, no one knows what happened to Arthur after he went to Avalon. Some people think that he was sleeping and would one day wake up, others say that he passed away from his injuries and would be reborn when he was needed.” Harry nodded. He had decided that this was his favorite story of all the ones that he had heard so far. “I believe that Arthur died long ago, but that the myth that he would be reborn is true. He’s known as the Promised King.” Harry smiled.
All of the blankets had been thrown off the bed onto the floor, and Severus could see Shadow hovering at the end of the bed looking frightened. Severus thought that it looked like he wanted to get closer to Harry but at the same time wanted to get away from the noise that had his ears flattened back against his skull.
“I know, Harry. He’s trapped here, he’s not going to be able to take you anywhere.” Hearing that, Rowle sneered.
Once Severus was back at Hogwarts, he made his way up to Remus’s chambers and knocked on the door. He didn’t understand why he kept doing this, or why it had to be HIM of all people. The only person he would hate more being in this position was Sirius Black. Thank all the gods the lunatic was in Azkaban and would be for the rest of his days.
Where we learn about Harry and Severus, and how much we don't really know Albus.
“What if, when he grew up, he was really nice? You would have a hard time believing that, because you believed for so long that he was mean.” Harry nodded again, understanding what his father was trying to point out. It would be really hard to change his mind about something like that.
Narcissa blinked once, twice, and kept blinking. Almost as if her brain was unable to process what she had just heard. Lucius's reaction was much more dramatic. He jumped out of his seat and moved to take a step forward, but his feet got tangled in Narcissa's skirt. With a solid thud and a tearing sound, Lucius landed flat on his face on the expensive Persian rug. Narcissa didn't react at all to him falling or her dress tearing, but continued to blink at Severus.
“Disagreement with his cousin? Seemed alright? Albus, I am going to be quite up front with you, but what in BLOODY HELL do you mean, was okay? He’s NOT FINE!” Albus looked up sharply, blinking in surprise at Minerva’s withering tone. Severus stood back in the middle of the room with his arms crossed over his chest, letting her take the lead. “That young boy has been beaten to within an inch of his life, and had Severus not brought him here there is no telling what further injuries would have been done to him. Or, indeed, how long he would have been able to survive in that place. What did I tell you? I told you when we left him there 5 years ago that those people were the worst kind of Muggles, and I was right. I was more that right, because they were not only the worst kind of Muggles, but they were the worst kind of humans!” Minerva barely stopped to catch a breath while she ranted at Albus, and was breathing hard in her rage.
Once the holidays had been completed, life seemed to settle into a comfortable routine, at least for everyone but Severus. Harry resumed lessons at Malfoy Manor, supplemented by time spent once a week with Remus. Severus was more willing to let Harry spend time with Remus, as well as less likely to unleash his frustration at the situation directly on Remus’s head, but he still wasn’t happy. He didn’t trust Remus to stick up for Harry should Albus try to interfere with him in some way, and was concerned that the Gryffindor would rub off on him. He didn’t want his son to be the type of person who would run off into things without thinking first, or start problems. He conveyed his concerns to Narcissa and Lucius, and both of them reassured Severus that Harry was very much not that kind of child.
“You are okay. I got you, my Harry.” Severus dropped to his knees and cradled Harry on his lap, checking him for any wounds or marks. Severus held him in his arms for long minutes while Lucius went over to Rowle’s form. Lucius picked up Rowle's wand, and watched as Rowle twitched on the ground. Remus came up beside Lucius.
Once outside their quarters, Harry got his first view of the student body. There were so many of them, and all of them were wearing the same kind of clothing. At the same time, the student body got their first sight of their terrifying Potions Professor and his... son? When had Professor Snape gotten a son? It didn't take long for the entire student population to be whispering about Professor Snape and the small boy who was holding his hand without even a glimmer of fear.
“Draco, send Ari if you or Harry need anything! I'll send Rose when lunch is ready!” Draco and Harry were already out the door. Severus sat down on the abandoned couch with a sigh. Narcissa sat beside him. “Severus, how are you doing?” Severus looked at her, then shook his head. Severus described how Harry had been adjusting, the flinching and being afraid of having things taken away from him. Narcissa was patting his hand as he moved on to talking about how worried he was for the future and making sure that Harry was safe.
“He also managed to make Draco grow a second head.” Lucius nodded and made the same noise, so Narcissa gave up talking to him and went to go refine her lesson plan for the boys.
“I have the coolest best friend ever!” Severus and Harry smiled at each other as they came out of the Floo, and Severus lead Harry over to the table where dinner was waiting.
“Lucius? Narcissa, are you there?” He didn't see anyone in the room, but he knew that the Floo was monitored and that they would be alerted to his call.
Harry and Severus get all of Harry's new things put away, and Harry meets Narcissa.
Lucius came over and quietly informed him that Lucius needed to talk to him once Harry had gone down for the night. A worried look crossed Severus's face, but he quickly schooled it away and continued to listen to Harry talking about his day. He smiled down at Harry.
“You want to hang out and learn all the things with me, right?” Harry looked at Severus for a moment, but his father appeared to be letting Harry make the choice.
“Harry James Potter, do you swear on your blood and your magic to accept Severus Tobias Snape as your father? To be protected and guided by him in the ways of magic and life?” Harry swallowed.
“Are you ready, Harry?” Harry nodded, excited and scared at witnessing magic for the first time. Minerva moved up so that she was standing next to Severus, forming a triangle between the three of them. She pulled her wand out of her sleeve, and started the ritual with a wave.
To all the people who have written reviews: Thank you. They mean more than I can possibly say. I never thought that I would be able to write something this long, or amazing even to myself. The more reviews, the more I have inspiration to keep writing.
“Harry is fine. He’s staying with a friend this evening.” Remus’s look went from wary to puzzled, as he wasn’t aware that Harry knew anyone other than Severus in the wizarding world.
“Lupin. I hear you are to be the Headmaster’s newest charity case. Have you grown tired of sleeping in alleys and halfway homes?” Lupin merely looked at him calmly, not rising to Severus’s goading. Severus never knew if it was because Lupin had no pride, or because he felt guilty for almost killing him when they were students.
**********
“You will never be in trouble for asking questions. Questions are important for learning to think for yourself and not following blindly. If you have questions about anything, it's always better to ask.” Lucius thought that it was a rather lovely small lesson, but was blindsided by the luminous emerald eyes that met his without fear for the first time.
“I will keep that in mind.” Severus replied, and continued walking.
“What does this mean, should the Dark Lord rise again? You and I both know that he isn't gone for good.” Both Severus and Lucius winced as a twinge went through the Dark Marks on their arms, although they stayed quiescent and faded.
I am SO sorry that it's taking so long to get Harry and Draco introduced. The story is playing out the way that it is, and I can't just cut it short. But I promise, many more amazing things will happen, and the very first thing that will happen next chapter is Draco and Harry getting to know each other.
After his bath, Harry got dressed in some very nice fitting clothes. The black pants and green sweater were very soft. It was the best bath ever, in Harry's opinion.  Severus and Harry went back to the table to get Harry some breakfast.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Narcissa is very smart. She knew that while hearing about you being hurt would make her sad for a little while, it would help you feel better. I am glad she did. And you can talk to me about it anytime. I am sure that Lucius would be willing to listen too, if you wanted to talk to him.”
Minutes later, hissing came from the ground to the left of the group. From under one of the hedges came an all-black viper, followed by 6 smaller grey and black vipers. They quickly moved towards Harry and Rowle. Rowle tried to back away from the advancing snakes, but ended up backed against the wards with nowhere to go. He realized then that the hissing was coming from Harry.
“I hope you are right.”
Thank you everyone for your patience with me. After working through a great deal of depression and burn out, I am finally writing again and posting again. I will be going through the chapters that I have previously posted, doing edits to clean up errors and continuity.
An hour later, Severus came through the Floo. He expected Harry to greet him as he normally did, but instead was greeted by Lucius. The hairs on the back of his neck prickled, and he immediately felt threads of worry.
“I agree, it does sound heroic. But being a hero is hard, it’s a lot of work, and training. And people have… expectations.” Harry looked confused at the large word. Severus thought for a moment about how to explain this to someone so young.
(See the end of the chapter for
Severus came through the Floo to the Headmaster’s Quarters. He was rarely called here, not since the Dark Lord had disappeared 5 years ago. Most of Severus’ time was spent dealing with obnoxious children who didn’t want to be bothered to properly learn Potions and fulfilling his Head of House duties. Severus was surprised that instead of the quiet of the tower, there was a shrill screech coming from one of the nick-knacks that cluttered Albus's office.
Severus looked Harry in the face, noting the surprise and awe running through his eyes. Severus opened the 4th door, which was in between his room and the bathroom and furthest from the hallway. Someone had a hand in decorating the room for a young child, and he was surprised and pleased to see that there were stars and constellations painted out along the ceiling. They glowed and twinkled in the dim light from the living room. Severus snapped his fingers and a lamp on the bedside table turned on, showing that the dark blue comforter on the bed had matching stars and constellations embroidered on it in silver thread.
“It just looks like a passageway to me. Maybe if you hold my hand?” Harry took Severus’s hand again, and led him towards the wall. Moments later, Severus was standing on the other side of the wall, and was looking down at a spiral staircase that he had never seen before. Severus blinked several times.
(See the end of the chapter for
Severus remembered what his first winter holiday with the Malfoy family was like, and knew that Harry could very easily become overwhelmed. He made sure to check in with Harry regularly. But while Severus had been a rather severe and rather antisocial youth, Harry was quite empathetic and enjoyed being social. There were moments where Harry's eyes would go wide with wonder, and he genuinely seemed to enjoy the holiday games that Draco and Narcissa were teaching him and he loved helping with all the decorating and rituals. There was one thing that Severus needed to talk to Harry about, and it was fast approaching.
Albus had his harmless old man face on when Severus came to the office after the dinner hour, which immediately put Severus on guard. Albus always did that when he told Severus something that was going to make him mad.
Severus and Harry arrived much later that afternoon. Severus's pockets were full of bags shrunk down with items for both Harry and his new companion, who Harry had decided to name Shadow. Shadow was riding in a carrier, and Severus took both Harry and Shadow through the school without a thought to the student population. He ignored the looks from student and staff alike as they made their way back to their rooms. Once there, Severus took the bags out of his pockets and returned them to their original size. Before he released Shadow out of his carrier, he placed it on the dining room table and sat on a chair in front of him.
“Have a child, my father said. Carry on the family line, my father said. I never would have…” Lucius’s complaining devolved into muttering. Narcissa laughed and left the room, heading to see if Severus needed help getting the chocolate off the boys. Remus excused himself, wanting to do his own research about the Arthur myth and any other information he could find. Forewarned was forearmed in his opinion. He also wanted to check and see if there was any information about this prophesy regarding Voldemort and Harry. He had almost no experience with young children, and was worried that every time Harry was around him, he was uncomfortable. Remus wanted nothing more than to have the kind of comfortable relationship with Harry that Severus did. The first thing that he needed to remember was to STOP mentioning difficult topics around Harry.
**********
Harry stirred, and realized that he was not lying on the ground, nor was he cold. The sharp pain in his side was gone, and his head didn’t ache. He wasn’t sure what was going on, but he realized that whatever he was lying on was soft and warm. He laid still and listened for any telltale signs of where he was, and realized that he could hear two people breathing not very far away from him. There was a hollow feeling to the room that he was in, as if it was much larger than he was used to. The room sounded nothing like any place he'd ever been before. Breathing deeply, Harry braced himself and opened his eyes.
“Good, good. I have come up with a marvelous idea to help him adjust to living in the wizarding world again. I am going to bring Remus Lupin to the school as a teaching assistant. To Professor Binns, as a matter of fact, in hopes of assisting him to move on. Remus was a close friend to the Potters, and I am sure they would want him in their son’s life. I am sure that the connection to his parents will help Harry heal. And Remus can teach him all about the magical world.”
“Ah, Severus, glad you are back. And how is young Harry this evening? Everything resolved? Surely a simple disagreement with his cousin? I noticed that that he seemed fine again not long after you left.”  Albus was reading through notes on his desk, and didn’t notice that Minerva was in the room until she stomped over to his desk and slammed her hand down sharply.
**********
Once Harry had woken from his nap, Severus asked if he wanted to play a game. He got out one of the wizarding games that was part puzzle game and part lesson about magic, and they spent a happy hour playing. The random sparks that shot out of the game made Harry giggle, but Severus could see that he was also very interested in the little wizards walking around and little pieces of information about wizards from the past. After the two of them had finished their game, Tippy let them know that it was time for dinner.
Shortly after they sat down, Lucius came into the room and sat at the head of the table. Draco had continued to chatter at an animatedly listening Harry, who was nodding and adding little comments with a gleam in his eyes. When Lucius sat down at the table, Harry began to draw into himself. Plates of food appeared in front of them, and the Malfoys began to eat. Narcissa noticed that Harry waited until they had started before he started eating himself. After a few minutes of them eating, Lucius spoke.
“Well, Harry, I am happy to tell you that are just fine, no lingering injuries. Are you ready to have your eyes checked?” Harry nodded again. Poppy ran her wand around his head, and then in front of his eyes.  “Follow the bouncing light, Harry.” A shining ball of blue light appeared and began to dance around the room. Harry followed the light with his eyes. A couple of moments later, glowing writing appeared in front of Poppy, and Severus leaned over to read what it said.
“Then there was this odd situation with Granger. Walking around with her and some boy and disappearing at strange hours,” said Pansy, drawing closer and looking like she was ready to light him on fire. “You couldn’t possibly be spending the time with Granger of your own volition, there’s nothing she could teach you that would be worth putting up with the smell.”
Hermione folded her arms patiently, glancing at the others before saying, “Harry, even if Charlotte survived the attack at the train station, there’s no guarantee she’s still alive. You-Know-Who isn’t particularly known for mercy, you’ve said so yourself.”
Draco said nothing, considering whether it was advantageous to seem appalled but almost too exhausted with the farce to try. Harry didn’t seem to notice either way.
“Not interested, thanks. And besides, you’ll be late for class if you linger here for too long. Anyway, see you for
“No, we can’t, Harry. There’s a proper order to these things,” said Hermione, pulling out her timetable scroll. “The basics of Transfiguration are the building blocks for Vanishment, Conjuring, and Disillusionment – all very important advanced magic. First we do transformation, then switching—”
“It will be too late.”
Draco tried to hastily clear his mind of the thoughts of Harry, scrabbling for something to say to placate Pansy. All this time spent thinking about the goings on in the Room of Requirement, he’d forgotten that he had an important stakeholder to keep occupied.
Harry looked up at him, propped up on his elbows, his hands slipping down his face in exasperation. “What use will that be?”
at the Slytherin table, absently eating a slice of bacon. “The Dark Lord is ready to make himself known.”
He sighed.
“It’s obvious,” said Draco, hopping to his feet and coming to stand next to Harry. “It’s the wand movement. You’ve got him doing some sort of jab when it should be more of a slashing. It’s not nearly so precise, see?” Draco’s wand erupted in a shower of sparks that flew down the corridor and bounced off the far wall.
Harry shifted in his seat, thinking it over. Draco had already seen Harry’s tragic backstory, the loveless relationship with his family, his sad little cupboard – what more was there to hide?
“Doing what?” asked Harry, his voice tinged with a slight chill.
“Er, Malfoy?” he said.
“Sorry darling, secrets come with the territory.”
He glanced to the Gryffindor table, where Hermione sat alone with her eyes glued to a large tome on dark magic, scribbling notes on a scrap of parchment and immune to the raucous chorus of Christmas carols Seamus Finnegan was leading from a few seats away.
“Mind if I sit here?” asked Draco, approaching the table.
Harry’s face darkened. “You’re joking”
“Could say the same to you, my friend,” said Draco, carefully slipping under a mask of composure. “Wandering around in the night, sneaking up on housemates. People will think you’re spying.”
“Keep the others away from this.”
“St Mungo’s finds itself under heavy scrutiny, following an incident on Saturday, 27 September, as a second patient, former Auror Frank Longbottom, has also gone missing under similar circumstances,” continued Pansy, her eyes flicking up momentarily to meet Draco’s. “‘St Mungo’s has complied with all Ministry-mandated security changes,’ said Healer Marina, spokesperson for the hospital. ‘However, none of the protective wards were tripped and the patient was not capable of self-Apparition. We simply do not know where he has gone.’
