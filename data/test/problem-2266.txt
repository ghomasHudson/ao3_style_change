Had to stop halfway through this to work out what year I'd set it in, just to determine what large coffee chain Harry could be frequenting. Didn't even name it in the end. But now I know that Harry is 25 in this story and Starbucks launched in the UK market in 1998, so... it's all good research.

Title is of course a reference to the stage play Tea and Sympathy, which was one of the first American stage shows to directly confront themes of masculinity and homosexuality. However, it's also a reference to the excellent Tea and no Sympathy by Who_La_Hoop, found here: https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311
With a day to wait for Draco's help, Harry ends up wandering Diagon Alley in disguise.
This got angsty, didn't it? Hope that's okay.
I hope Draco's okay. I also hope the next chapter takes me less than three weeks to write.
Also, I started this chapter like three different times before I worked out what was actually happening, so that didn't help either.

It's been a busy week. Hopefully the next chapter should be a little quicker. Looking forward to Harry and Draco confronting Kreacher? Let me know what you think might happen in the comments (I haven't decided how it's going to go yet, so I'm just as curious as you are).
So Draco and Harry are in Cetus' belly, but 'the belly of the whale' is also the name of a stage in the Hero's Journey, where the protagonist faces a symbolic death and is reborn, shed of his previous flaws. I dunno if that's actually where Harry's at right now, but he's definitely undergoing some kind of change.

he’d promised both. To himself, maybe, but he’d promised. He’d
It was jarring how much Draco looked like his father, when they were both smiling, presented next to each other.
The heavy door swung open, and Draco saw the holly wand first, followed by a strong, uniform-covered arm, before his eyes finally landed on Harry’s stupid, beautiful face, and Draco wanted to cry at the look of relief that washed over his features upon seeing Draco, but he couldn’t, he could do nothing at all but stare, standing there, trembling.
Memories and thoughts and feelings were flying through Harry’s head at an incredible speed, so different from Draco’s Legilimency. Faintly, Harry could smell freshly roasted coffee, and he thought he felt himself grin softly through his disorientation. But he was getting dizzy, and he wasn’t aware of anything outside of the hurricane in his head, and the floor under his knee didn’t feel as solid as it had a moment ago—
Harry left for the Ministry once they’d all gathered back in the library of Malfoy Manor. Hermione sent him a worried look, but Draco wouldn’t meet his eyes.
of his forms—well, he only had the two—and it was nearly impossible to hide that urge from Harry. Draco had managed as best he could by simply draping himself over Harry more than usual, much to his husband’s confused yet delighted surprise, but it wasn’t enough. Taking Harry’s shirts would be too obvious, and the same issue with his trousers; they were large and bulky and even Harry rarely managed to lose full articles of clothing.
Hopefully, she could meet up with him in the morning. If he didn’t get an owl by the time he had to leave for work, he would figure out what to do then.
“At seven, then.” Weasley pressed the book to her chest and went back to the till.
“He told me he showed up in a forest,” Draco said softly. “Saw a castle and thought he was trespassing.”
Potter shifted in his chair. “You’re going to think I’m crazy.”
“You and I both know Harry isn’t a danger.”
“Is that the
Something twisted in Draco’s chest. “And that was my doorstep?”
“I’m sure we could.” Lovegood settled into a chair finally, hand reaching to squeeze Potter’s. “It’ll be a nice trip, I think.”
With his wand out of reach under his clothes in a drawer, he had to make do with arming himself with a broom he left out. He gripped it tightly before easing his way to the front door. Just when he was about to open it and confront whoever dared to disturb his house, he heard a soft knock.
“The dino-shapes, just as promised. The bowls?”
Draco knew that Harry's memory could return any day, but he held onto the hope that the relationship they were building now would overcome anything the man remembered. As he looked down at his hands, he couldn't help but feel hopeful for their future.
Draco found himself smiling. “You’re welcome... Harry.” If he hoped to be friends, he should probably get used to referring to Harry and his friends in a more friendly way. “Should we have dinner again in a few more days? After you’ve had a chance to research, Blaise?”
Potter shifted so he could look at Draco more easily, their knees touching and sending a slight thrill through his spine. “Did you plan on telling me we’re wizards?” he asked, a teasing smile on his face.
, Draco, not with them. Ginny says my instincts have always been pretty good and right now they’re telling me to stay here.” Potter squeezed Draco’s hand. “If that’s okay with you.”
“Thank you.”
“Luna?”
“You do realize I don’t care about the book, right?” Weasley asked.
It was and it also wasn’t. Draco looked down at their hands, not sure he was doing the right thing. But, he had to admit that Weasley was right -- Potter’s instincts were usually spot on. Besides that, something in his own mind was telling him that this had been the right choice. Potter showed up on his doorstep for a reason and maybe if Draco helped him, Potter would stick around as a friend even after he remembered everything.
Draco couldn’t stop the small smile that came with the question. “Growing. He’s at the neighbor’s today.”
He wasn’t sure how much time passed before a jingle over the door caught Draco’s attention. He straightened and opened his mouth to greet the customers who braved the weather, but the words died on his lips. The Weasley girl he may have expected to potentially come by, but his old roommate Blaise and Hogwarts’ resident nutter Lovegood were a surprise. Weasley’s focus was on him while the other two were quietly discussing something Draco couldn’t hear.
Scorpius stuck a bit of food in his mouth, chewing through it before nodding. “The super moon?”
“Thank you, Draco.”
“It’s just some look-a-like,” he told himself before making his way back downstairs. Potter died years ago, there was no need for Draco to get worked up about it all.
Scorpius stood on his bed so he could wrap his arms around Draco’s neck in a hug. “Teeth and sleep,” he repeated before pulling away and hopping off the bed.
“Actually, he found me.
“It is,” Weasley insisted. “Luna did a scan-” he had seen that flash below the counter, but hadn’t been sure what it was, “-and it’s him. I want to take him to a healer, but I know what taking him to St. Mungo’s will do.”
Harry smirked. Ron groaned.
Harry was reminded forcefully of Remus as he gingerly took the chocolate and did as he was told. He wasn’t sure if Remus would have scorned the comparison, or been proud of Malfoy for how much he’d grown. Probably the latter.
Kramer waved it off with a dismissive hand. “I know it’s rare to give you feedback, but this is important. Keep up the good work, but we need

“I am not ready to give up your breakfasts,” Willem said, when Harry complained of burdening him.
Harry didn’t know why it had to be such a secret, but he’d signed the contract anyway, and was therefore magically forbidden to speak of anything he did for the Department of Mysteries.
Memory-Harry muttered. His breathing had sped up.
he thought, glaring at the mug. It was probably Dumbledore’s fault he drank his tea like this, too. Harry tried to keep from growling.
Recognizing that Draco wouldn’t contribute any more to the discussion, nor would he reveal any details about Harry’s condition, Shacklebolt ended the conversation by patting his knees once and standing up to his full, not-inconsiderable height.

“We don’t know,” Pansy replied, sparing a concerned look for Narcissa. “Narcissa doesn’t know
Potter’s face fell as it turned back to Draco, his gaze moving from his blond head to his expensive leather shoes and back, assessing. Draco’s skin crawled under the scrutiny. Potter couldn’t keep the suspiciousness out of his eyes, but Draco felt a little calmer now that he looked less like shattering the windows with raging accidental magic. Potter’s eyes moved to Granger, entreating, nearly begging, and he thrust a hand in Draco’s direction. Draco could read that one:
Harry had

“Come on, then, Eric’s dying to meet you,” Dudley said, turning and striding back up the walk. Harry saw Eric waving excitedly from the door, cackling when Dudley swept him up and carried him back inside.
He thought of the love she had shown him, the love of a mother: of waving goodbye to the Hogwarts Express and watching a child grow, knowing the child is loved. Of her strength in carrying her family through War, and her determination and guilt for the prisoners in her home, her dutiful and conspiratorial care, her ambition and intelligence and eagerness to learn everything.
if not curious. Eager to learn, desperate for knowledge about anything and everything—you know, knowledge for knowledge’s sake. He said they hoard knowledge like a dragon, in their dark little lair, deep in the bowels of the Ministry.”
“In case you need another holiday, from your head,” Draco murmured, handing the glowing vial to Harry, “I’m assuming you have a Pensieve, at home.”
Draco huffed a surprised laugh. He reluctantly opened the journal, and allowed Harry to show him how to work the pen. Harry held his breath when he brought it to the page.
Harry nodded, rolling his eyes faintly.
“No wonder you couldn’t sleep,” he mumbled. “Hang on, let me show you something.”
which was a little embarrassing, but it was the first thing he’d thought of, the first time he did this, and he couldn’t change it now. Harry raised his eyebrows, cautiously amused.
He scrutinized Harry once more, up close, as if searching for something he still couldn’t find. Harry had no idea what he was looking for, as usual, so he simply stood there and waited for Malfoy to remember his manners.
“At that moment it was a private battle of wills, wasn’t it? You wouldn’t ever have given her the satisfaction of knowing she got to you. But you also knew it was bigger than that… because she was the hand of the Ministry. It wasn’t just you versus Voldemort, anymore, or a simple matter of what was right or fair or not. It was bigger than just you—the fight became
Harry nodded into his cracked palms.
Draco nodded. “I’m sure he did, what with the way I found him in our cellar, having strangled himself.” They both cringed at the memory. Harry shook his head, writing again.
Draco thought as he danced a Viennese Waltz to Coldplay with his house elf, while Harry Potter watched and laughed fondly from the middle of the room among containers of takeaway. Draco’s twelve-year-old self would have spontaneously combusted if he could see this. Could his life get any stranger?
of Draco, the history of him, but half of it was missing.
“Leave that notebook here,” Draco told him. “You can use it for our sessions, but it won’t leave this room.” Harry set the notebook on the side table, and grabbed a chocolate covered biscuit from Timsy’s tray. Draco smirked. “Good, Timsy would be terribly offended if you didn’t.”
Her and Ron tried to convince Harry to allow them to join him, but Harry vehemently refused.
An easy one to start, Draco noted, relieved. “It’s an odd, silvery glow around certain memories,” he explained. “It looks very similar to what the hole in your memory looked like, when I first saw it. It’s a kind of magical signature. I let the memories pass until I see that glow, and then I sort of… grab it.”
“Say it, Harry.”
Ron opened his mouth to respond, but Harry failed to suppress a snort. Both faces turned towards him, one exasperated, one indignant.
but his body wasn’t his own. His muscles felt like they were made of heavy sand, slipping through his fingers, out of his control. It didn’t stop the adrenaline rush.
keeping things from her best friend. Draco wondered how long it would hold up.
Draco was frozen, powerless, completely silent. He fought desperately against the restraints in his head, but it was no use, and Harry was slowly, hesitantly coming closer. Draco was begging him internally to look, to use
I trusted google translate for any unfamiliar spells, so take it with a grain of salt.
“How long ago?” Draco asked, unsure of what else to say, since
Draco nodded politely at each person in turn, his eyes lingering on Potter a bit longer than normal, before turning and striding out of the room. Granger and Weasley broke out in quiet conversation as he closed the door behind him, and walked briskly towards the apparition point in the hospital.

It was halfway through August before Harry had enough power to form a tap in Prague.

He took his steaming mug and thanked Timsy for the meal. Timsy offered to welcome the impending guest and show them to his study whenever they arrived—he had probably deduced from Draco’s agitated fidgeting that he was expecting someone. Draco agreed and gave the elf a smile before returning to his study to organize his thoughts.
Potter was silent—of course he was. His face was tense, concentrating, like Draco was a difficult puzzle to solve. Which was alright, because Draco thought of Potter like a puzzle, too, albeit from more of a Healer’s perspective. The fire crackled quietly in the grate.
With a jolt of panic, Harry raised his wand, made several rapid circular movements in the air, casting nonverbal Bubble-Head Charms on everyone in the room.
and yet, here it was, Draco’s and his father’s names were on the tag, and his brain was working so fast he could hardly keep up. If his name was on the tag, that meant that action had been taken, events already set in motion, just like with the prophecy of the ‘Chosen One’, the tag had been edited after Voldemort had targeted
Draco’s. But he hadn’t even heard of another prophecy being made about him, what was this? On second thought, he didn’t want to know. He moved on to the next.
“Will you relax? Look around!” Harry spread out his arms, inhaling the sweet pine scent of the Norwegian forest, listening to the echoes of the birds, the hush of the wind, the skittering of a creature nearby. He hadn’t been able to explain to Draco
for reading this over for me and making sure it was satisfactory for you all! And as always, to my faithful alpha readers, my wife and BFF. ❤️
“Harry,” Draco said, because he didn’t know what else to say, but he had to say something, to try to bring Harry back to the present, alleviate his hurt. Harry let out a shaky breath, still gripping Draco’s fingers tightly with his right hand, eyes intent on Draco’s face. His left hand reached into the back pocket of his jeans, pulled out a silk handkerchief, and handed it to Draco.
“I might be an excellent dancer,” Harry mumbled. “You would never know.”
“Why is this important, Draco?” Kingsley glared. “You think the bookworms down there had something to do with what happened to Harry?”
“Death Chamber,” Harry murmured.
Weasley snorted at that. “SPEW, but I won’t tell her if you won’t.” He finally made his way into the sitting room with Draco on his heels.
“You’re right, that does sound mad,” Ron said. “But alright. Time to visit the house elves.”
“Took you long enough,” he mumbles. “Is that—why you’re early?”
His lungs tightened suddenly, contracting violently and squeezing all of the breath out of his body. He tried desperately to inhale, but once again, his body was not his own. Lucius held him like that, suffocating him, glaring ferociously, until he saw dark spots on the edge of his vision, and felt his body start to sag.
Hermione kept insisting, and Harry could admit
Boran had nearly jumped, and was pressing himself against the wall, eyes filled with terror again.
things: Draco’s hair in Harry’s face, the solidity of Draco’s body, the sounds Draco made. Pretending, pretending, Draco’s hot breath on Harry’s lips, Draco’s fingers in Harry’s hair, Draco’s teeth on Harry’s neck—the way Draco mewled and whimpered for him, mindless and flushed with pleasure, his hand gripping Harry’s wrist hard enough to bruise—
“Come here,” Narcissa said firmly, interrupting his racing thoughts. Harry stopped pacing.
“Sorry, mate. Forgot.”
Draco froze as a small rectangular compartment opened in the front, barely the size of his palm, almost exactly the size of the cassette tape on the shelf. Holding his breath, Draco opened the plastic case of the tape, glancing at Harry’s scrawled handwriting on the card inside. He took out the odd, smaller rectangle within, and carefully slid it into the compartment—it fit perfectly, and he whooped with accomplishment, startling Timsy in the hallway, who jumped and grumbled under his breath.
Harry pressed his lips together to hold back his smile. Narcissa looked mildly shocked and indignant, but there was so much fondness beneath it, it was hard to tell.
Later that night, long after Draco had fallen asleep, Harry left for the Ministry. In the familiar, fluvial solace of the Pensieve room, he deposited his shortest, most vague observation to date.
One was of Lucius, younger than Harry had ever seen him, holding a bundled, white-haired infant. A chubby fist reached up and tugged on Lucius’ long hair, eliciting a fond, amused laugh. Lucius’ hand carefully removed Draco’s from his hair, allowing the tiny fingers to wrap around his own instead.
“He was the target,” Harry mumbled. “Of course, that curse sent me directly to him, he’s the only one in England…
“He said you haven’t left the house or worked in days, that you lay around moping all day.”
“No, Lucius,” Draco whispered, closing his eyes, still grinning weakly at himself. A lock of his dirty hair fell into his face. “It is my mercy, not yours, that matters now.”
Harry was stretched out, his head propped on a soft cream throw pillow against the armrest, his lawless hair splayed across the fabric. He had one arm thrown above his head, the other settled against his stomach. The hem of his navy t-shirt had ridden up a little in his sleep, and Draco’s eyes were drawn to the thin sliver of deep bronze skin there on his hip, just above the waistband of his faded muggle jeans. His boots had been discarded in the front hall as soon as he arrived this morning—his socks today were a normal, black cotton. Draco missed the polka dots.
“Don’t look at me like that,” Draco sniffed.
The three Gryffindors were quiet, taking in the information. Potter still looked a little spooked, so Draco decided to let him recover. His own mind was buzzing with theories, none of them helpful at the moment. Today’s work was done.
“—and I have
it—no use stopping now.
Harry sat perfectly still, as if one single movement would break this spell, would stop the flow of freely given insight into Draco’s life. Draco continued frowning at him, trying to figure him out.
, and Harry was thrown back as the shelves shattered, the vials burst, and all of Harry’s memories from the last ten years shot towards him, freed from their confines.
Harry didn’t move, but the sadness had lifted somewhat from his face, and Draco felt that tiny, warm sense of accomplishment again.
Draco breathed hoarsely, emotions storming through him. He dropped his wand, somewhere—his hand grabbed for his chest, not for the scars, but where he felt the jet of green light hit him—hit Harry—
“He knows we talk,” Draco parroted him again, because
“See something you like?” Harry asked, not looking up from his book, licking the tip of his finger to turn a page. Draco swallowed.
“Yeah?” Draco asked, strained. “Did you tell Robards off?”
The lightning should have incinerated them, he realized belatedly, but it should have incinerated

like something was wrong, but he wasn’t eager to stay at St. Mungo’s longer than he had to.
and having his mind invaded. Voluntarily. He couldn’t help the spark of excitement in his gut, making itself known through the nervousness. Fate was cruel, and Harry was indeed an unlucky bastard, but maybe this was supposed to happen, after all.
“Hm,” Draco hummed quietly. “Well, now you know,” he said matter-of-factly. “Ready for a break?”
The island had powerful magic, but it was dark, and built on centuries of despair. It was not anything he wanted to expose himself to, even with the Dementors evicted.
He pulled the small pouch hurriedly out of his pocket, and accidentally elbowed someone else in line for the floo.
“Prat,” Harry replied, shaking his head, but eagerly leaning down to kiss him anyway, threading his hands through soft, blond hair, unable to control his own happiness.
“This is Hera,” Draco explained, not taking his eyes off of her. “She enjoys carrots and gentle scratches behind her ears.” Draco gave her the carrot with a fond smile, and demonstrated the ear scratches. Hera leaned into his hand.
me do it, instead, so that I would prove that I’d put myself in danger for the sake of others. He said it was all I knew how to do, now, that all I had ever done was take the roles thrust upon me because I had to, because I was told it was the right thing to do, because I have no self-worth, apparently—he said I keep giving away pieces of myself because I never learned that there was anything worth holding on to, and that people were using me, all the time, and I’m letting them, that I’m just as much of a pawn as I ever was… He called me a puppet…”
“Filched it,” Draco finally spoke. “From the Ministry, when I was eighteen. It fell out of an Auror’s pocket.”
“Listen,” Draco urged, apparently worried that Harry might explode. “It sounds like the purpose of this curse was to make you ‘be known,’ right? They said they’d
different: the magic was so much more intense, here, as if its roots had dug deeper into the soil after so many eons of existence, tangling around the megalithic tombs. Harry felt it reach for him, because he was reaching for it. He felt the connection between his feet and the earth, and if he closed his eyes, he could imagine torrents of light in his veins.
Harry eyed him appreciatively, and Draco raised an eyebrow, disgruntled.
,” he said, accusatory and so bloody fond.
Draco rolled his eyes. They both shared dramatic tendencies, it was how they got along so well, after all this time. Their interactions would do well on a stage. He loved her for it, even when it was annoying as shit.
Draco deepened his glare, hoping Shacklebolt could feel the disapproval in his gaze, since he didn’t want to risk saying another word in this conversation. The Minister was relying on the bloody Chosen One to save the day, yet again. Did anyone get anything done without help from the Saviour?
Camila poked her head into the sitting room.
“Enjoy your time at the Ministry, Mr. Malfoy,” the wizard mumbled, face still slack with shock. Draco decided to test his new theory by looking him in the eye and giving the man a charming, lopsided grin, saying, “Thank you, Mr. ...Collins,” as he read the man’s badge. The young wizard swallowed and
line, because it was possible. Likely, even.
“Lord knows you’ve fought worse,” Willem muttered wryly.
and then it was gone. Draco tsked in annoyance.
“Together,” Ron murmured, and they cast the cutting spell simultaneously. The three people holding onto the strands gasped as they were plucked more violently, and Timsy started rocking back and forth anxiously, squeezing his eyes shut—could he feel it, too? Or could he feel Draco’s distress? They tried again and again, and Harry was losing patience, watching those handling the bond threads as their faces twisted in pain, knowing Draco was likely in agony—Draco, who was already in danger, already defenseless against a man without a conscience—
The memories slowed, and finally stopped. The muggle pub surrounded them once again. Harry was alone at the bar, looking tense. Draco looked around—there she was, on the other side of the room, the blonde woman he remembered from the first time he glimpsed this memory. He nudged Ron with his elbow and pointed.
“Thanks,” Potter said, smirking up at him and patting his chest. Draco furrowed his brows, feeling like an idiot.
He could handle the bird on land, he could shift and scare it away. But if it dropped him now, he was a goner. Snake or human, he wouldn’t survive that fall.
“If you know something I don’t, Hermione,
No, Harry couldn’t. Well, he could, but he wasn’t really
he loved hiking so much, but he’d hoped he’d be able to
Draco scoffed dramatically. “I wore them for Rose, of course.” He flipped his hair and crossed one long leg over the other, putting the outrageous slippers on full display for the room. The trio chuckled at him, before Ron clapped his hands together and motioned toward the Pensieve.
Draco tried not to jump at the word “friend”—she was probably only saying it to show her daughter that Draco wasn’t a threat. Which was still baffling, but he was rolling with it. He loved children, and he didn’t want this little girl to be afraid of him, so he got down on his knees, sitting back on his heels—he could see Ron’s eyebrows shooting up at the sight of Draco Malfoy on the
Harry opened his mouth to ask more, but Ron and Hermione chose that moment to walk in with takeaway.

time. The memories flashed to Hogwarts, to Umbridge, to Harry yelling at her in the middle of class, until finally the silvery glow appeared in Draco’s peripheral. “Here we go,” Draco whispered, seizing the glow.
Draco’s head tipped forward, his neck failing to hold its weight completely, and he felt Harry’s wayward curls brush his forehead. He could feel the soft puffs of Harry’s sharp breaths on his face, and it was hurting, now, in his core, but not enough to make him stop.
in Draco’s dreams.
“Er… do you want your…?” Harry motioned toward Narcissa’s jumper. Willem huffed and shook his head.
It was a split-second shift, the pressure inside him equalizing in a blinding flash of heat and light. It was an eternity,
Harry’s hands shook violently as they fumbled with the kettle. Water sloshed in the metal belly, and he winced as it made a clattering, clanking noise upon landing on the hob. Thankfully, he managed to ignite the flame on the first try.
When he’d returned to the BnB and forced down a meal, he sat on his bed, naked and shaking, staring at the journal peeking out of his rucksack.
Harry held tight to his hand, kissing his knuckles, white-blue under the moon. He could feel incredulous laughter building in his stomach, but he held it in.
The next song was too easy for him to subconsciously sway to, so he stood to replace the Firebolt on the rack, and returned to his stool with the
Malfoy’s shoreline looked even more dreamlike in the mornings.

Draco’s stomach dropped.
Harry’s hand covered Draco’s on his chest, tentatively raising the other to Draco’s face. Draco’s eyes squeezed shut, evicting more tears, his fortress crumbling between them. Harry wiped the tears with his thumb.
He thought hard for a moment, trying to think of what else he wanted to know. Was there anything he was curious about that might also make Draco feel better right now?
Nothing. He waited for Parkinson to do her Life Detection spell, but she was silent. When Harry looked over at her, she was staring wide eyed at the archway.
“You’ve
Draco’s lips are warm, and soft, and everything he’d imagined and
Willem listened with an air of calming, enduring patience, letting Harry get it all out, painting and humming occasionally. After a while, he put down his watercolours and sat back in his chair, his hands clasped over his stomach, watching Harry intently.
at, what I trained and studied for years to do. What’s done is done.”
Draco felt the blood rushing back into his limbs; there was only one way to find out. He drew his wand in a blur, aiming it at his maybe-father, maybe-hallucination—
“N—” Draco tried. “Not in my home,” the potion corrected. “Apparently there are some waiting for me in an inheritance that I do not yet have access to. I don’t want them.”
Malfoy turned to face him, furrowing his brows in confusion. He always seemed to look at Harry like that, lately, and Harry was a little horrified to find he was endeared by it.
It wasn’t much of a decision at all. He pointed gently at Malfoy.
A pause. “You seem a bit… young, for her.”
and thinking back, Harry could now recognize the sounds he’d made as those of
Timsy’s hand started to move, as if drawn by a magnet, holding Harry’s wand tightly. It spun him, slowly, pointing outwards across the room, until it finally stopped, aiming at a door three doors down from them.
Harry walked out of the library and all the way down to the gardens, grabbing his heavy Unspeakable cloak on the way.
Weasley had grown up, definitely—his shoulders and chest had broadened significantly to fill his tall frame, effectively moving him from lanky, gawky teenager to intimidating Auror. Draco was irritated to note Weasley had at least a couple inches on him, which was no small feat. The fabric of his navy Auror uniform was perfectly tailored, but still straining over the muscles of his shoulders, arms, and thighs, and honestly, when did wet-shoelace-Ronald-Weasley get so stupidly

“I have ideas,” Draco said quietly, “but I’m not sure exactly what it was about that fight that was so important to you.”
He eventually raised his wand again, and declared himself ready. Harry consented, but he still looked a bit cautious, which only furthered Draco’s resolve. He had to do this, had to see this through, he was a fucking
Draco gently ran his thumb over the raised lines, and was casually fascinated by the juxtaposition of their hands, together. Draco’s fingers were long and slender, his skin pale and soft with only the occasional broom callous. Harry’s fingers were shorter, but his hand was stronger, rougher. The skin of his palm was a slightly lighter shade than the rest of his hand, and there were more scars than Draco had seen, at first—all shapes and sizes, all over his arms, and Draco knew the stories of some of them, now. His hand moved to Harry’s wrist, feeling the quickening pulse beneath his fingertips, the light dusting of dark hair on Harry’s forearm, the muscle tensing beneath the bronze skin.
Draco’s hands were shaking violently, and he could feel his hair sticking to his forehead and neck with sweat. The pain continued in his gut, as if someone had reached in, grabbed his organs in a fist and twisted them around. His hands clutched at his sides, his arms curled over his abdomen in defense, in defeat.
Harry rushed down the stairs, wand at the ready, because Ron and Hermione would have just used the floo—
Harry started walking towards the floo, but paused and turned back, looking pleadingly at Hermione.
“He even brought you to his muggle father’s grave, and still, you groveled at his feet,” Draco muttered, feeling more confident in himself, even without full control of his faculties. Lucius’ nostrils were flaring with anger, but he probably wasn’t willing to attack Draco like a
Harry swallowed, considering his answer. He gently pulled the elastic off the end of Draco’s plait, combing his fingers through it.
or something.
and “
Harry had remembered the taste of his breath, but had forgotten the sparks that zipped through his veins at the brush of Draco’s tongue. He’d remembered the sounds Draco made, but had forgotten the jolts of arousal they sent through him, tingling heat from his scalp to his toes and back, pooling in his belly. He’d remembered, but the memory was nothing compared to the real, living moment.
His body only shook harder—Draco’s presence was a comfort, but also an unavoidable reminder of the contents of that dream. Of how much he had to lose. 1:30.
He spun suddenly in Draco’s arms, flattening his trembling hands on Draco’s scarred chest. Draco let him move, let him bury his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, then held him even tighter. Harry breathed in his scent, feeling his pulse under his palm, allowing Draco to stitch him back up with sturdy arms and gentle, caressing fingers. So very alive, without a doubt, wonderfully tangible and perfectly real.
Harry heard vague grumbling against his shoulder, only making out the words
Draco sighed, and rubbed the tops of his thighs with his palms. “You’re right,” he said. “I wouldn’t’ve.”
to dress formally for a floo call, but it certainly wouldn’t hurt, in this particular case. Timsy was shaking his head in disapproval on the other side of the room at the sight of Draco practically
“That was obviously a very happy and life-changing moment, for everyone involved, but it was quite different for you—because it had always been you three, since you were kids, the absolute best of friends, you did everything together. It must have been odd when Ron and Hermione got together, and became something separate, even though your friendship stayed just as close as ever. But when they had a child, it was even more pronounced…”
“This is true,” Draco nodded again, “and not only because you could ruin me if I failed, or otherwise sabotaged your healing.”
“Draco?”
Harry,” he said. “That may be
But right now, he only wanted a new pack of scrunchies, because his hair had been falling in his face all day—all morning, it wasn’t even noon—and then to pick up bubble tea from the place nearby that Draco liked, and maybe that would help cushion the blow that Harry was a big, messy, hotheaded disappointment who couldn’t provide for his husband. Well, he still had his inheritance—plenty of money in the vault. But he’d been hoping to, perhaps, save it, for a possible potential future maybe child—anyway, it was the principle of the thing—
He probably could have used the direct floo to the Minister’s office, but that just seemed rude. He didn’t want to push his luck. So with a grimace, he stepped into the filthy booth, and dialed 6-2-4-4-2.
Timsy appeared as soon as Draco put down his fork, and began clearing the table. Draco took a quick swig of his pumpkin juice, made sure Harry was done, and stood up, stretching again. Harry watched, seeming to map out the lines of Draco’s body with his eyes, the way he mapped out unfamiliar rooms.
By the time his alarm went off Monday morning, he was in a similar mood as the morning before. As the minutes ticked closer to nine, his doubts became louder and louder. Why on earth had he agreed to this? There was no way to maintain a professional distance with Potter—there was just too much history between them, right? Surely there was somebody else with his particular skill set that could help Potter?
Draco hadn’t been this close to someone since his time on the Continent, and this was so, so different—probably because it was
Draco withdrew, pointed his wand at the board, and labeled the next dot “Diggory’s Help”. He looked back to Harry, and his lips started twitching at the fiery blush on Harry’s cheeks. Harry’s eyes were wide, surprised and embarrassed. Draco couldn’t hold back his amusement, now that his Occlumency walls were down.
“At the moment, yes.”
“This was one of the first albums Pansy ever bought me. I listened to it so much that Pansy ended up just buying me more records, so that she wouldn’t have to listen to the same thing every time she came over,” Draco said. “She’s been adding to my collection ever since. She even forced all the Backstreet Boys albums on me, though I tried to get her to take it back. I’m perfectly satisfied with N*SYNC, as you well know.”
Draco put his freed hand on the doorknob.
Harry frowned at this, looking like he wanted to protest. Draco held up his hand.
“Because she
The other Aurors’ jaws were dropping slowly.
Sitting up in his chair, Draco put his hands on his knees and got comfortable. “I’m not going to teach you Occlumency unless you ask me to, but it would be easier for us to start if we’re completely relaxed. Imagine what your mind looks like when you’re anxious or upset, then imagine having to watch that in someone else—“ Harry shuddered, “—quite—so we’ll start with some breathing and meditation.”
He thought about how easy it was to find that missing memory, how it had dragged him in against his will and gotten him hooked on the puzzle, on the mysteries he wanted to solve. He felt something like lead fill his stomach—this curse could involve Draco as much as it involved Harry. Wasn’t that just his luck?
“In my study, in my home, in Devon.”
He realized that in the ten years he’d been coming to this room, he’d never actually
“Perhaps,” Hermione replied, shaking herself. “You’ll have to ask Draco where he found them.”
“Thermo—what?”
On the second day, Harry made himself leave the bed. He couldn’t make himself shower, the water felt like a spray of hot glass. But he made himself eat, then wandered around the village of Port Erin and along the shore of the bay, taking it all in. Literally.
Harry closed the heavy door behind him. Kramer stood by Harry’s shelf, his hands clasped behind his back, scrutinizing Harry’s memories.
Draco walked into the next room, almost as dark as the first, and heard his own breath catch in his throat—it was at least the size of a cathedral, or two, and packed with towering shelves of glowing glass spheres, exactly like Harry’s memory. He could almost hear Lucius’ demands and Bellatrix’s jeers, could practically see them in front of him. Draco shuddered.
He listened carefully, but could only hear the sounds of soft breathing, somewhere near him, and the occasional quiet chimes of the monitoring charms.
Ron put his hands up in that appeasing gesture again. “Mate, it’s not like that. He won’t be assaulting your mind and asking you to defend it with no real instruction. He’s a Healer, he’s a professional. People wouldn’t be raving about his work if it was torture, alright?”
Draco stared at him, silent and steadfast, committing every inch of him to memory—as he did every day, every night, just in case.
It wasn’t as though he had purposefully set out to steal Harry’s scrunchies and then hoard them in a way that certainly did not befit a gentleman, but perhaps befit a gentleman who was sometimes, of his
They basked in the heretofore inconceivable moment, until Harry looked at Draco expectantly and put his hands up, palms facing the ceiling, in a slight shrug. Draco read it as,
Sometimes it was explosive, sometimes it was insidious. But it always ended in bed, with Draco asking unfiltered questions about Harry’s life, and Harry providing extensive, honest answers, their fingers laced together under the dim light of a floating
“No.”
Timsy held out his hand, and Harry handed over his wand, though his instincts were screaming at him for leaving himself defenseless in enemy territory. He’d have to trust
He walked Harry to the front door himself, and watched him take his leather jacket off the hook on the wall and slip it on. Harry ran a hand through his hair, and turned to face Draco, holding out a hand for him to shake.
“What? Draco, listen—” Harry tried rubbing Draco’s leg soothingly. Draco shuddered. “—I can fix this—” he wasn’t even sure how, but he’d do anything, if it would make Draco stop trembling like a leaf.
Ron shrugged. “I remember how she kept you alive in the Forest. And it was weird, seeing Malfoy like that. I almost…
, sparks, wind; Harry threaded his hands in the softest hair he’d ever felt, pulled him down into a smoldering kiss, and ignited.
Harry couldn’t tell if Narcissa was uncomfortable being at Willem’s, or uncomfortable because of her out-of-practice physical existence, but something wasn’t right. He kept asking her, every day, “
Harry felt like he was floating. Like a feather, drifting back and forth as it fell slowly to the earth. Except he never landed. He just kept drifting, back and forth, a gentle rocking motion. Weightless.
special,” she rolled her eyes, flapping her hand at him, but the small smile remained on her face, as it usually did when Draco was around.
“Should’ve known you’d try and sweep me off my feet,” Draco muttered. Harry could feel the smile against his cheek.
“Harry once thought it might be an Unspeakable,” Draco continued with their theorizing. “I don’t know anything about them. This person clearly has access to an extensive store of Polyjuice Potion, and probably some more dangerous, experimental potions… They also sounded pretty prophetic, when they attacked him. What do you think?”
The figure asked, probably another rhetorical question, as out of it as Harry was. No, he wasn’t in a bloody hurry to get to know anybody. Honestly, the only person who’d come close was Ginny, and he just couldn’t be with her. He couldn’t imagine meeting somebody, now, and having to explain his life story to them. What a nightmare.
“Draco—!”
Draco lifted his hand, and Harry laughed as he read the upside-down script:
on the room.
“Shut up,” Harry snapped, his rage returning in full force as he met the Minister’s gaze.
Draco’s heart was racing wildly, the blood draining rapidly out of his face.
Their wand was raised again, and Draco fell backwards into his mind-viewing. He quickly gathered his wits and exited Harry’s mind.
Draco didn’t even wait after closing the door this time; he simply locked the front door with a flick of his wand, turned around, and walked straight to his bed, unbuttoning his shirt as he went. He got his trousers off just in time to fall into his nest of pillows, pulling the fluffy duvet up to his eyes. He brought his hands up close to his face, his nose next to his wrists, and fell asleep instantly, breathing in the faint scent of treacle and warm grass after rain.
Draco had a lovely time, despite his best efforts not to.
He closed the bedroom door behind him. He made sure to lock the front door, though no one would ever find the house unless Hermione wanted them to.
He stopped outside the door to Potter’s room, gathering himself, smoothing nonexistent wrinkles out of his jacket and straightening the glowing Healer’s Emblem pin on his lapel—the crossed wand and bone shimmered with its authority charm. If he weren’t in public, he would shake the tension out of his limbs vigorously, but he settled for deep breathing. He could feel a bit of sweat under his arms and on his lower back, which was annoying. It wouldn’t be seen, of course, the jacket was practically drowning in his own well-crafted impervious and temperature regulating charms, but he cast a freshening spell on himself anyway, just as he caught the sight of bushy brown hair rounding the corner.
“Your magic is perfectly natural,” she said slowly. “You’re a brilliant young wizard. You have a good heart, and a strong spirit. And your hair is lovely,” she added as an adamant afterthought. Harry couldn’t suppress the embarrassed, amused grin. “And Petunia Dursley will have to move homes if she ever wants her gardens to grow again.”
Harry had done some seriously unprecedented things in his life: youngest Hogwarts Seeker in a century, surviving a few duels against Voldemort, coming back from the dead. Telling Molly Weasley “no”. Eloping with a gorgeous, irascible, adorable, controversial former Death Eater. Breaking the news to Narcissa Malfoy over dinner and not throwing up from nerves even a little.
Draco smiled encouragingly and took a deep breath, building his defenses and selecting a couple of memories. He raised his wand. “I’ll cast and hold the Legilimency, while you just relax and keep up the shield charm, yeah? It doesn’t have to be very strong.” Harry nodded, and raised his wand. “Three, two, one,
Harry raised one eyebrow at him, folding his hands under his head and crossing his legs at the ankle, looking perfectly relaxed.
Harry closed his eyes again, breathing out slowly.
Harry had his head in one hand, eyes squeezed shut, rubbing his forehead. His expression was pained, and Draco panicked a little.
They began to wilt rapidly, turning to dust in Harry’s palm. Her face fell.
“The Ministry of Magic.”
The memory ended, and Draco withdrew carefully, not yet letting his Occlumency walls down. He had work to do first. He pointed his wand at the board, made another dot, and frowned, not sure what to label it.
Draco raised his wand, and concentrated to allow only a fraction of his power through it.
him, Draco could hear his barely contained laughter.
Harry huffed a laugh at that. Bubo finished up his feast, hooted once, and flew back up to his perch. Hera looked back at him with her big, dark eyes, hoping for another carrot, but when he held up his two empty hands, Hera huffed and brushed past him to return to whatever she had been doing before. He gave her a soft pat on the back as she passed.
Draco’s face was flushed, full of wonder and awe and something else Harry couldn’t read, his shining grey eyes fixed intently on Harry.
“I’m saying that if she didn’t turn it away, then it didn’t find her,” Ron explained carefully.
Harry ordered them both the spiciest Vindaloo they had. No rice, no naan,
Draco should have been expecting a memory of Lucius. He should have been prepared for something like that. He would be, next time, he promised himself. He opened his eyes.

Harry tuned out what was surely a riveting academic discussion, thoroughly distracted by the vibrancy of Draco Malfoy’s
“Why don’t you show me, then?”
The strings bounced as if they had been plucked, but did not break. Kingsley, Parkinson and Smith winced in discomfort.
They landed in Draco’s childhood bedroom. The walls were covered in Quidditch and broomstick paraphernalia, and the shelves were stuffed with books and toy dragons. The furniture was ornate, the curtains around his bed were a deep, Slytherin green. Harry grinned at the sight.
My links keep breaking, so if you wanna listen along with these bozos during their break, copy paste this!

of the fire, and then Harry was gone.
Draco tipped his head up on Harry’s shoulder, lifting his eyes to meet Harry’s own. Harry felt it like sparks in his mind, every time—persistent collisions of metal and flint over dead, dry brush.
Harry stood up on numb legs and left the office. He rushed out of the Department of Mysteries, and did not stop until he reached Ron’s messy cubicle in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
Harry still looked hesitant, but he nodded anyway, and Draco understood that Harry trusted him enough to let him take the lead—even though he didn’t have much of a choice. Draco turned back to the couple.
“What the

Draco felt that being made to feel all of Harry’s pain secondhand was a fitting punishment for having to put Harry through that again. His own emotions were combined with what he’d absorbed from Harry, and he couldn’t tell what pain was his own—he felt a wetness on his cheeks, and when had that happened?

territory, but it didn’t work—Harry could still see the ink smudges on his hands, a lock of hair falling out of his plait in a wide loop. With his face angled toward the door, the scar over his jawbone was illuminated with firelight, and his bottom lip was pink and shiny from where he’d been biting on it.

“She’s your responsibility then, Harry, and if she slows us down or compromises this in any way, I’m blaming you,” Ron said shortly, using his best Head Auror voice. Harry could tell he wasn’t happy about the situation, but he knew why Harry was allowing her to join, regardless.
The owl flew off looking much happier, and Draco felt satisfied that no one would suspect he had mistreated the bird at all.
He was careful to recite it word for word, exactly as he’d made Draco say it in the false memory.
Willem’s eyes widened. “You have
Harry’s hands quickly turned, his palms landing on the inside of Draco’s wrists. He closed his eyes, effectively pushing Draco out of his head. Draco was terrified that he’d passed out, that he’d killed him, and tears were streaming freely down his dirty face, outside of his or Lucius’ control.
“Don’t start something you can’t finish, Potter,” he muttered hoarsely. Harry gave an exaggerated sigh.
suddenly desperate to explain himself.
“Do I know you from somewhere?” Willem asked quietly. Harry sighed and looked away, back to their maps.
Her vigilance felt familiar. He wasn’t as surprised to see her as he’d thought he would have been. Of course she was there, because she was always there.
Draco could feel his left hand shaking in his lap, but carried on.

The floo sucked him in and he waited, enduring the nauseating, dizzying journey, before he landed in his own fireplace, and stepped into his sitting room with a great sigh of relief.
“And we're not going to think any less of you, no matter what, mate,” Ron added. “You know that.”
“Draco Malfoy,”  Draco said stiffly, sticking out his hand. “A pleasure, Mr. Dursley.”
“Now, you

That part, he was pretending.
Before long, the supple brown leather boots were transformed into outrageously fuzzy green slippers, each with two huge eyes under a ridiculous unibrow, and a wide, thin mouth. Rose let out a delighted giggle, clear as a bell, and bounced gently on the balls of her feet. She whirled around to her mother, who was watching the interaction with a face full of shock.
“And Boran?” Draco asked, moving on.
He closed the back door behind him, stepping fully into the garden, admiring the long grass and wildflowers growing uninhibited beneath his boots. It was a garden the Dursleys would have hated, which made it the best garden in the world, exactly how a garden should be.
“Er—no—”
“I need the Hall of Prophecy,” Ron said, because they had to start somewhere, but the doors did not move. Ron walked to the nearest one and pulled, but it was locked. He moved to the next, but that was locked too. He tried every door, but they were all locked, barring them entry. Harry guessed that was to be expected.
Draco closed his eyes, finally letting his Occlumency barriers down, feeling the tidal wave of reactions burst through. His thoughts were racing, but he rubbed his thighs, his hands, his hair, his collarbone. He knew who he was. He had just
Harry huffed a short, disbelieving laugh. Malfoy, asking about his day. Harry shook his head slowly, making Malfoy even more concerned.
Harry’s grin widened. He looked past Malfoy toward the peaceful, modest cottage, then backwards to the serene, secluded shoreline, and finally back to Malfoy himself, his hands stuffed in the pockets of his peacoat, his long hair in its loose plait tucked into an old green and silver scarf, the sleepy and affronted frown on his unfairly attractive face. Harry raised his eyebrows instead of answering.
He was dressed impeccably, as he always had been, but Draco couldn’t see the walking stick anywhere. His hair was much longer and whiter than it was the last time Draco had seen him, down to the middle of his back, and he was looking around Draco’s sitting room curiously, as if he’d just popped by for a visit. He held his wand loosely, lazily, in hands clasped in front of him.
Pansy smirked at him. “You put it in a tape player,” she replied. “I’ll get it out of you eventually, you know. You’re shit at keeping things from me.”
“That was over a month ago,” Draco noted, his frown deepening. Harry nodded.
“Try not to be
Potter raises his eyebrows incredulously.
“Unspeakable—what?” Malfoy finally tore his eyes from the side of Harry’s heated face.

He visited Narcissa and wrote to Willem. Some days, he did absolutely nothing but kiss Draco and feed him.
as he slashed the wand down.
The witch glanced up at him, unimpressed. She waved her wand with several muttered diagnostic spells. Glowing diagrams appeared above the gurney, making her eyes widen in alarm.
“I did too, once,” he murmured. Harry’s eyes snapped back to his, still looking cautious, resigned. “Pansy was also very gracious about it. I was fourteen.”
She looked like she was trying to contain her laughter. “You got the im-portant part.”
“You’re
is a weapon?”
But in Harry’s eyes, Draco had spent their interactions making him feel stupid and inferior, throwing a bigoted ideology on his shoulders and expecting him to carry it, and insulting his first two friends, ever. They’d made enemies of each other so quickly, as children. What would have happened if Draco had apologized and asked for Harry’s perspective? If they had had time to introduce themselves in Madam Malkin’s, if Draco was the one to offer his friendship first, instead of Weasley?
Draco twisted the quill between his fingers, his expression thoughtful. Harry held his gaze, determined to have his answers.
Harry found himself smiling so much that his cheeks hurt, endlessly entertained by his theatrics. When they finally made it out to the gardens, Malfoy paused, scanning the sprawling grounds with an anxious, mournful gaze.
“Muggles, I think, English ones,” Draco explained, picking up his food again. “Have you heard of them?”
“Hmm,” Draco sighed, wondering how to explain this. He propped his chin in his hand, idly tapping his finger against his cheek.
Narcissa, so why is his name written here?” Harry’s voice was ice, and Narcissa winced, her expression filled with utter misery.
“I guess I’m just looking for things to experience,” Harry continued. “Like you said, seeing everything there is to see.” He refrained from adding,
Harry’s heart sped up a little at the sight of Draco’s elegant signature, but he forced himself to concentrate.
Draco took a risk, and inched his right foot forward on the carpet, until the tip of his shoe touched Harry’s. It was much less scary than surprise handholding—they could pretend it wasn’t happening, if they wanted to, or they could take comfort from the modest contact. To each his own.
“He said I was trained to give myself up, without thinking twice about it, all the time. He said that Dumbledore could have done all of the things I had to do as a kid

he’d said. The first time Draco had heard his voice in eight years, and it was a livid, growling lie.
“Idiot Gryffindor,” he said softly, teeth nearly chattering with his violent trembling. “Not much there to begin with.”
Draco still complained, but he complained that Harry had been holding out on him—breakfast wise—in the few days Harry had stayed with him; he complained that “
Harry’s eyes widened. Was
“There’ll be time for that,” Draco muttered. “First—” he pulled away to kiss Harry’s forehead, then stepped back, composing himself, “—Mother wants to see you.”
“Because I wanted to,” the words flew out of Draco’s mouth. “Because I knew I should, as a Healer, because I owe you a life debt, because I was curious, because I wanted the challenge, because I wanted the opportunity to really get to know you, after I mucked up so many chances, and for you to see me as the man I’ve become.” Draco gasped for breath. That was exactly what he had said previously, when Harry had asked. He’d actually told Harry the full truth, the first time.
Hermione pressed, and Draco rolled his eyes. Were they just going to repeat his words all night?
Draco replied, chuckling, and then they were both quietly giggling at the absurdity of the situation.
“Aurors. Licensers. Wizengamot. Harry, this isn’t—” —important, he wanted to say, but apparently that wasn’t true, and he couldn’t force the word from his lips. Harry continued writing, and at this point, the notebook was always faced where Draco could read it, as Harry wrote, sitting awkwardly crooked on his chair.
He was reminding
Draco held the hand against his face, trying to control his breathing, riding out the hurricane of emotions, noticing the difference between those and the twisting discomfort in his gut from his bonds, now, painfully sharp. He had never had to test it like this, before. It only made him grip Harry’s hand harder, probably out of spite.
“Lucius was never known to put reasoning before pride,” Ron grumbled. Harry turned to face Kingsley.
“You would,” Draco muttered upon hearing the news of his new security detail. He had his hand in front of his mouth, as if he were biting his nails, but Harry had never once seen him bite his nails, and so could only assume he was hiding a facial expression.
Malfoy finally stepped aside, glaring at them, but waving them in anyway. Harry nodded politely as he passed him, allowing himself to look, his cheeks heating again at the cool, clean scent that filled his nose. Like the salt of the sea, like eucalyptus in a hot shower, like sun-dried bedsheets; he smelled like everything Harry had never had.
Harry looked at him warily, and let out a long, exhaustive breath. Draco waited for a moment, watching him.
“May I come in?”
Hannah’s eyes widened in shock. Harry smiled weakly, his stomach fluttering with nerves, and left the room.
“Yes?” Harry raised his eyebrows, watching Draco shift underneath him.
Of all things to hallucinate, it had to be…
“You weren’t a
“Alright, Draco,” she said, with a slow nod. Draco nodded back and sniffed haughtily, then turned his head to examine an uninteresting piece of wall. When he wasn’t looking, Narcissa let her smile break out.
Ron closed the heavy oak doors behind him as he entered last, his ears violently red. Draco stood from his chair.
Draco was panting and shaking with adrenaline—Occlumency couldn’t protect from his own physical reactions. He felt something warm and strong in his left hand, gripping him and trembling, and knew he’d probably unconsciously reached for Harry’s hand again. But he had a feeling Harry needed it, too, an anchor to the real world. Draco couldn’t stop now—he could feel more than see the next breadcrumb, so close, nearly there. It couldn’t get much worse than this, right?
Kingsley, they wouldn’t have done it without your approval! They would have simply given Draco his license if you’d just used your authority for once and
Harry smiled weakly; there was no joy in it, but a little surprise. It was a question he hadn’t expected.
Harry was looking at him with those sad, concerned eyes again, and Draco did
“Go on,” Malfoy purred.

He remembered Lucius once punishing a house elf for making a noise after accidentally burning themselves—he had seen Harry’s aunt do the exact same thing. He realized he hadn’t even heard anyone say Harry’s
but his body was a mere plaything, out of his reach. Lucius was clearly enjoying the taste of his success, and evidently eager to rub it in Draco’s face, because he released Draco’s mouth, enough to allow him to speak freely.
Draco exhaled in relief. “Thank you. That’s all I need. Good day, Minister.”
Harry’s lips quirked and he shrugged, even as he felt his cheeks heating. “Come on, it’s a classic. Essential to his musical education.”
He looked in the shabby mirror in the loo of his Prague bed and breakfast, at his sunken eyes and shadowy stubble. He looked angry, dangerous. Violent.
Timsy was wringing his hands, darting apprehensive looks at every witch and wizard in the room, determinedly trying to fight through obvious nerves.
The smell of broom polish and wood drifted over them, and Draco breathed it in indulgently. His brooms were hung neatly in a line along one wall, and all of Timsy’s outdoor tools adorned the other, above a short wooden counter filled with pots of soil and plant cuttings. Draco had held on to every broom he’d ever had, even as they got old and couldn’t fly like they used to, or lost too many twigs to keep a straight line. There were five in total, starting with his first real broom, a Cleansweep Lucius had bought him for his tenth birthday, at the protest of his mother. Then there was the Nimbus 2001, part of the set Lucius had bought for the Slytherin team, followed by a top of the line Comet Aurora he had bought anonymously after the war, when he was stuck within the bounds of the Manor on probation. After that was the Turkish
Draco would never know, under vows of confidentiality as he was. He could imagine the headlines, though.
“If you’re amenable, Potter, we can start with memory recovery right now. I’d have to look at the general structure of your mind to find any holes, and from there it’s a simple matter of tugging the memory back from your unconscious. You don’t feel like you’re missing anything substantial, correct? You don’t feel disconcerted, disorientated, or confused?” Malfoy asked.
Draco decided to try the method that had already worked once before. He cleared his throat. It might not work, there might not even be a prophecy here, but if there was, he would only be able to obtain it if it was about him. He had to try.
“My favourite record for rainy days,” Draco said. “If we’re lucky, I might be able to get Timsy to dance to it.”
Only because they had the most fun scrunchie selection, and the clerk never judged him or gave him funny looks, and always had new scrunchies for him, and one of these days she was going to wear him down and he would let her pierce his ears. He could, now that he was no longer beholden to the antiquated DMLE dress code. He’d had to fight Robards to be allowed his
He ambled through the Vyšehrad fort and absorbed its history, connecting with the tendrils of magic that wound through its opulent graves and statues. He brushed his hand over the imposing carved stone entryway of the Basilica, though it felt like hot, shattered glass against his fingers.
Harry was looking at him intently, face full of something Draco couldn’t quite read. Draco waited for more questions, but they didn’t come, so he decided to move on.
and Harry started to feel that it finally was: encountering the Veritaserum in Draco’s bloodstream and following Harry’s command, gently burning it away, leaving only Draco’s blood behind, continuing on through his body.
The Warden jumped at the noise and made a little strangled sound as Harry revealed himself.
you?”
He stood up from his desk, stuffing the last of the cold sandwich in his mouth and adjusting the leather wand holster on his thigh. He’d gotten used to carrying his wand in his pocket, again, and now the holster just felt constricting, uncomfortable. He walked down the long row of cubicles, towards the heavy, ornate wooden door of the Head Auror’s office.
Apparently, Ron could. “No, he doesn’t mean the Manor. He has a place of his own,” he answered, with a meaningful glance at Hermione. Ron didn’t wince or shudder at the memory of Malfoy’s “place,” so Harry assumed it wasn’t too bad.

in plain English, but it makes sense in the context of their rambling.”
Kramer chuckled and nodded. “Yes, how witty,” he replied dryly, informing Harry that he did indeed watch the memories as soon as Harry deposited them, and so far thought nothing was amiss.
Harry burst into laughter, surprising them both. Malfoy smiled, incredulous and infected with Harry’s amusement.
“I’ll stay away, if you want,” Harry forced out. “I did it to make you happy, not to make you indebted to me. You needed her. I couldn’t sit still and do nothing, once I learned where she was and how to get her back. And you couldn’t—” he gave up, grasping the lapel of Draco’s coat. “You couldn’t come, because I was stealing magic from everything around me; your Patronus—I
“How would you describe the staring?” Draco asked, frowning.
Draco was sensitive enough that he could see the faint, cold, silvery shimmer of Lucius’ magic covering him, but he didn’t want Lucius to know that, so he darted his eyes around in panic, careful not to land on him. The chains suddenly released him from the chair, and he was pulled up out of it like a doll onto his feet, hissing as his muscles seized again. His body was walked to the middle of the room, and kept there, his feet rooted to the spot against his will.
Next to
“He’ll eat with me, occasionally,” Draco started, “But only once or twice a year. It makes him uncomfortable, especially around guests. I’m lucky if I can get him to take tea with me in the garden.”
Draco sighed, and caught a glimpse of the thin, jagged scars on Harry’s hand. He motioned toward them with his head, and met Harry’s eyes. “May I?”
The Department of Mysteries had never been a particularly cozy and welcoming place, and it was even less so in the middle of the night. It wasn’t like there were windows, anyway, with the Department being underground and averse to the real world in general; it looked the same no matter the time of day. But it felt like the earth pressed harder against its tunnels at night, the winding halls more threatening in their silence.
The massive room was dim, smelling musty and dank. The walls were covered in filing cabinets, some with drawers that extended out ten feet or more. There were desks spread throughout the room, each with a single lamp, covered in parchments, pretentious charmed quills dancing across endless scrolls. A number of smaller, closed off rooms lined one of the walls—they looked far too much like interrogation rooms for Harry’s liking.
“Ow!” Harry yelped as he was thwacked over the head with an empty pizza box. “What the—”
and as long as it came from you, Potter, it would ruin me. But I’m trusting that you won’t.” He made sure to hold eye contact with Potter. This was too important. And utterly terrifying.
Harry fell asleep on the train to Copenhagen. The conductor prodded him awake with the ticket punch, as if he couldn’t be bothered to touch Harry directly. Which Harry supposed was understandable, if terribly rude.
Draco picked up his wand again, pointing it at the chalkboard. He made a new dot at the end of the line, and labeled it “Hearing the Prophecy”.
This latest development in their relationship made Harry’s mornings twice as hard to endure.
“Well done,” Draco declared, to Harry’s pathetic delight. “We’ll make a selfish man out of you yet, Harry Potter.” He winked, and Harry huffed a weak laugh in an attempt to control the fluttering in his stomach.
“Six months.”
and his abdomen contracted with it. He let out a grunt of pain as his body seized on the ground.
she cast carefully, and tiny pink sea thrifts grew from the wand tip. She smiled brightly as Harry took them.
that I love you, Draco,” Harry urged. “We have… time, for the rest. Don’t we?” He hated how small his voice sounded.
“Oh yes, we’re going to listen to it,” Draco teased. “The first time was slightly ruined by a very rude interruption from Pansy.”
“Thank you,” Harry said into her cloud of hair. Ron reentered the cubicle, his face falling with worry as he took in the scene. Harry held his arm out to him, and Hermione did the same.
“My house-elf,” Draco replied nonchalantly, then widened his eyes, realizing what he’d said and the inevitable explosion it would cause—
Well.
Looking around, he spotted Potter’s hunched figure at the end of the bar, closest to the wall, his head in his hands. The mysterious individual was there, as well, a couple seats down, talking softly. Draco still couldn’t decipher any singular feature, and could only discern that this was

Harry’s eyes lit up. Draco had seen Harry on a broom enough in his youth to know he absolutely

Draco watched him for a bit. “Would you say you’re aware of your magical power,

Draco took a deep breath and conjured two glasses, filling them with the lemon water Harry liked, before pulling his notebook into his lap.

Malfoy’s brows were slowly drawing down, his expression transforming with concern. His thumb brushed over Harry’s cheekbone, and Harry leaned into the gentle touch. Malfoy,
“I’m not your son,” he reminded her, then winced at the sensation of a chiding flick on his forehead. “Watch over him, not me.”
Harry choked. “You didn’t.”
Draco finished explaining his theory, watching Harry’s face carefully, and picked up the potion vial on the side table. Harry followed its path with his eyes.
“Draco,” he urged, taking Draco’s wet face in his hands. His lips were turning blue again. He brushed away the long hair the rain had plastered to Draco’s face, and called him once more. “
Draco had been pacing for what felt like hours.
Was that what Harry was thinking about? Was Harry understanding
Draco took a running leap, transforming in mid-air and immediately diving underneath the scrunchies, wiggling in delight, his thoughts reduced to a litany of
“Who?”
Draco closed his eyes, steeled himself, then held out his hand to Ron.
“I only know Harry as well as I do because you
“But you didn’t do it for him, did you? No, you said you did it so your dad’s friends wouldn’t become killers—you saved them from damaging their souls. But you didn’t
Harry had never seen Draco look more stressed.
“My name is Harry, as you probably know, but you may refer to me as Unspeakable Potter,” Harry said. The man’s eyes widened, his jaw tensing with anger. No one liked when the Unspeakables butted in. Harry wasn’t technically an Unspeakable, anymore, but he needed to use any leverage he could.
and so
He reminded himself that it was worth it, over and over, but it didn’t help. It never did.
He took a day to recover in a charming little inn, then got out his maps and started planning the final leg of his task.
“I died because I
“You seemed to be getting along just fine in the last six months,” Harry pointed out.
That was news to Draco—he remembered Harry’s furious face when Draco arrived in his hospital room, he remembered Harry’s silence and cold look upon returning his hawthorn wand, and walking away from him, before Draco could muster the strength for a useless ‘thank you.’ But he also remembered Harry’s lengthy and unnecessary testimony to keep him out of Azkaban; he remembered Harry flying back into danger and pulling him out of the fiendfyre. In the back of Draco’s brain, he knew that it could be true—that Harry hadn’t hated him, even then, and had maybe even wanted good things for him. Maybe Harry had wanted him to live, to thrive.
“Right,” Ron began slowly, “I’m going to assume you got through the wards with Timsy’s house-elf magic, but how did you find us?”

“Well, I’m here now. And my desk is nearly cleared, and I need more cases.”
She’d volunteered. She’d wanted this. Had she
Weasley huffed and picked up his coffee again. “To do whatever it is you do. Fix him, heal him, figure out what happened to him, so we can find the bastard that did this and put him away. All the Healers we’ve spoken to agree that you’re the best option, and the only option in England, and Harry doesn’t want to leave the country without his voice.”
“No. I haven’t
. He held Draco tighter, and didn’t let go, not even when Draco finally stopped shaking.
“How long are you going to keep this shit up?”
The heavy door swung open with a loud creaking sound, startling them both. An unanticipated figure appeared, grinning mischievously.
Timsy had to step in around one in the morning to make him go to bed, which Draco tried to do, he really did. But his thoughts were moving too fast to relax, and even his best efforts at Occlumency couldn’t keep the image of Potter’s angry green eyes out of his head. He’d ended up slipping out of his house for a quick fly on his Firebolt 3001, hoping the cold, late March air would clear his brain enough for sleep. The sky was a deep blue-black, the stars shining brighter under a new moon. It was beautiful, and rejuvenating, disencumbering his mind as it always did. Timsy gave him an exasperated look when he landed, but said nothing.
of raw energy—”
Draco stared at him for one full second, then two, before he burst out laughing, a full belly laugh that had tears leaking out of his eyes. When he was finally able to look at Harry again, Harry’s smile was nearly blinding, his eyes twinkling and shoulders shaking with his own silent laughter.
Harry moved closer.
Harry rolled his eyes, and simply pointed at Draco, apparently tired of writing for the moment, or unsure of the words.
“That you’ll forgive me,” Harry answered, consumed with the weight of Draco’s hips and the taste of Draco’s tongue, with lust and fear and fire, always fire.
He palmed his wand the second he passed the wards, and apparated straight to Draco’s house.
Draco inhaled sharply, pointed his wand, and vanished the chalkboard entirely, with only a half-second of mourning for the loss of his delicate charm work and books. That board held a ton of “true knowledge” of the
“You’re the

Harry didn’t move for a moment, eyes darting back and forth between Draco’s, taking a long, deep breath. Eventually, he shook his head, slowly. Draco nodded at him.
and Harry’s breath caught in his throat. He’d
“Yeah?”
“Draco, I’m not pretending,” Harry managed, over the lump in his throat. “Not about that.” He leaned in and kissed him again, his hand under Draco’s jumper. “Of course I love you, can’t you
Harry grimaced. Growing bones hurt like hell. “I missed
Harry’s first day on the case was nothing like he’d expected.
Harry gasped as Draco kissed him, his lips, his cheeks, his eyes, his forehead. Harry hated that he was crying, but he didn’t have to think about it, with Draco holding him together like this. Harry held on to him for dear life, crumbling in the cage of Draco’s arms.
Harry opened his eyes, immediately meeting Draco’s gaze, and Draco could now see the traces of sadness on his face—of course, a Patronus is the embodiment of happiness, but his stag apparently represents the parts of him that came from his father, which would conflict with those feelings.
“I’m—” Harry stopped himself, because he wasn’t sorry for those things.
It was nearly time for a tap. Whatever that brewer had used was much stronger than Hermione’s version. At least he’d gotten his money’s worth.
“A common nightingale.”

Harry had thought he’d been prepared for something like this, but, like lightning, being prepared didn’t make it any easier.

Ron stood, raising his voice.

“Okay, point is, Healer Malfoy is our best bet,” Ron interrupted, “since there’s nothing wrong with you physically, the Healers agree this is a problem for the specialist in Mind Curses and Afflictions, and he’s agreed to help regardless of your history, and Harry, you’re just going to have to trust us on this.”
But now he wished he had, because he felt
He couldn’t help but answer Ron’s jabs and engage in Hermione’s discussions, and he got to take the piss out of Harry for anything and everything while Harry cooked for them.
Ron chuckled. “It’s a brilliant idea, but I am not chasing after anyone who utters the words ‘Love Chamber’, I can promise you that.”

“Wonderful, I was hoping we could take a stroll through the park, it’s a beautiful night—”
He almost felt… safe, here.
“Sorry, what?”
The memories felt vibrant and violent and Draco prepared himself for a potential breadcrumb, but the violent feeling quickly retreated, followed by a deep feeling of bitterness and despair in the next flow of memories. It was months in a tent, on the move, carrying a horrible locket, hungry and hopeless and miserable, and only getting worse—
Harry listened intently, his face caught somewhere between rage and determination. Draco recognized that look from school, and knew he wanted to fight someone, right now. Draco hoped it wasn’t him, that Harry would give him the chance to take the potion and tell the whole truth. But he’d understand if he didn’t. The trust between them was still so new, and so fragile, and it was already being tested.
Potter had grown, but not much in height. His chest and shoulders had much more muscle on them than when Draco had last seen him in person, which was when he was malnourished from a year on the run and saving the bloody world, so that wasn’t much of a comparison. He could appreciate, however, the curve of his biceps where they held the top half of his body up from the bed, propped on one elbow to better see the chess game. This stretched his plain, grey t-shirt over his apparently toned chest, making Draco divert his eyes quickly back to Harry’s face. His deep black hair was as ridiculous as ever—Draco thought privately there must be magic keeping those wide, wild curls from being remotely tamed. They fell haphazardly over his forehead, around his ears and the nape of his neck, sticking up at random intervals as if they couldn’t decide whether or not gravity mattered. Draco could see the trademark scar peeking through the fringe in a jagged, pale line that barely cut through his right eyebrow, just over his glasses, which Draco noticed were a slightly larger, more modern version of the round frames he had worn throughout school.
As always, kudos, comments, reviews and shares are much appreciated.
An old book reveals exactly why the house is responding so violently to Harry. Finally, answers! Surely this will all be wrapped up really easily from this point with no further issues.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry and Draco have a civil conversation, and it's only interrupted by Harry's RAGE twice.
So like... he's in the belly of the whale, but he's also *in the belly of the whale*, right? Get it?
After the last chapter took a while, I found an unexpected pocket of time and this one flowed pretty easily, so hopefully that makes up for the slight delay in getting to the juicy return to the house and more Harry/Draco interactions.
Also, I came up with the name 'Quaffle Waffle' before remembering that Quidditch Weekly exists, and I like my name better, so suck it JK.
Argh! Just when I thought they were going to get out of the house and start making progress, now they're trapped!
Ooh, also, last time I mentioned there would be an incredible pun in the title of this chapter. You see, 'cetus' is a name for a type of sea monster in Greek mythology, and the story of Jonah in ancient Greek translations of the Bible uses the word 'cetus' to describe the beast which swallows him.
But Draco’s Occlumency walls were still up, and his face was carefully blank. His body was still while he waited.
“Malfoy’s here, ‘Mione,” Weasley called as Draco took in his surroundings. He heard some noises from what must be the kitchen, and then Granger walked in, toweling her hands dry. She smiled tentatively at Draco, who was still stunned. Why were Granger and Weasley
i.e. Sunday, 26 March, 2006.
“Come here,” she repeated. She pointed to the floor at her feet. “Now, Harry.”
“Yes, obviously, but—Harry, why?” His voice is so small. Harry desperately wants to hold him, but he remains still.
“I didn’t know him,” he admitted. “Not like you did.”
enough.
“One of these is the Love Chamber,” Harry said gravely, to the raised eyebrows of everyone in the room. “It should never be opened, it’s kept locked at all times. Remember how it melted my knife? ‘A force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than Death,’ Dumbledore told me.”
robes, adjusting the lopsided shoulders. “You work best under pressure.”
but they were too busy staring at Draco in shock to register it. He guessed it must have been as much of an emotional whirlwind of a day for them as it had been for him—although in very different ways.
This apparently released some sort of tension in the room as the three Gryffindors broke into quiet giggles and looked at each other meaningfully. Draco shook his head and tried to keep the small smile off his face as he put his glasses back on and returned his attention to the file. The satisfaction of finally making these people laugh, even at his own expense, caused a warm feeling in his chest. Which was pathetic, he soon realized, and rearranged his face back to
“Yes, of course! I was particularly intrigued by your work on the Unstoppable Nightmare Curse, how you were able to guide the patient through the nightmares to find the personalized counter curse pieces in each one, utterly fascinating, and the False Tongue Curse, with that witch who could only speak to people in languages they didn’t understand, were you really able to—”

“Let me explain my theory to you, first, and when I’m finished, I’ll take the Veritaserum and answer any questions you have. I told you I’ll always give you full honesty, and you should trust that, but in this case, I thought you might appreciate the extra failsafe.”
Potter blinked open his eyes. “You think we could?”
Draco’s eyes widened and he looked to the other three. “You aren’t going with them? I thought you’d be more comfortable...”
Weasley took the book without looking at it. “We’ll bring something. Any allergies?”
She scowled and pulled her arm away. “Maybe he just doesn’t remember
Harry Potter himself, so Draco had no choice but to make his way through whatever job he could find to support the one thing he never thought he could ever have. Raising him hadn’t been easy, especially without the support he could have received had his family still been in good standing.
She turned her head, smiling at Draco over her shoulder. “Don’t worry, it’s nothing bad. I’m curious.”
“That’s right.” He wrapped his hands around the mug, letting out a breath. “There were a bunch of boxes around and nobody seemed to notice me from the street. I looked around but didn’t recognize anything, though. And then I realized that I wasn’t even sure of who
Draco gave him a smile. “Lucky for you, Potter and I haven’t had our dinner yet. We’re waiting on our friends.”
But soon their bellies filled and the food grew cold -- Draco knew it was time to get down to business. He set his glass on the table and stood. “I should tuck Scorpius into bed. He’s played his game long enough, I think.”
“You’re more important.”
“So I can play until then?”
. I... The first thing I remember is this alley and I didn’t recognize anything, so I panicked. And then... Well, I don’t quite know how to explain it.”
Draco tensed, a flicker of memory flashing across his mind. Fiendfyre -- he tried to forget that day had ever happened if he were honest. "You rescued me," he finally admitted. "I had done... I had participated in something stupid and you saved me from it."
was on his lips, ready to come out and break Potter’s heart. But Draco’s mind had always betrayed him and now wasn’t going to be any different. “Of course,” he heard himself saying. “Dinner first.”
“They tend to get religious and preachy.” Draco settled back behind the till. “If you just read the books as a fantasy adventure, they’re entertaining.”
“Don’t be jealous, Draco,” Blaise teased. “It doesn’t suit you.”
“Luna’s a Mediwitch, so if we can maybe come over tonight...”
-Teddy was raised by Bill and Fleur after Andromeda passed.
Potter stepped into the room, barely looking around. “Thank you, I appreciate this.”
Since he didn’t want the kettle to scream and wake Scorpius, Draco plugged in the electric one to heat water for them. By the time he finished putting the mugs and various teas on the table, Potter walked in, tugging the end of the sweater down. Draco offered a smile before motioning to the small table between them.
Potter waited until Draco stood before he finished the last of his tea and stood as well. They went upstairs in silence as Draco led the man to Scorpius’ mom’s room -- she only used it if she was in town for longer than a night, but Draco kept it tidy just in case.
“I promise to hold back judgment.”
“My wife adores me so much.” Blaise pulled Weasley in to kiss her cheek.
“I think so.”
“Just use a random scrap paper.” Draco pulled out a records book -- he had some business to do before he could read himself. “Let me know if you need anything else.”
Draco’s breathing was shallow, uneven, difficult through the painful lump in his throat. With shaking arms, he brought the strong hands he held to his face, holding the backs of the fingers to his forehead and cheek, feeling the warmth beneath the skin.
“Yes, her magic smelled different, too. It’s comforting, and soft—it smells like snow, and strong tea.”
“Harry, those two were the only—“

“I wanted to,” Harry said quietly. “I wanted to see you.”

Teddy’s birthday was the perfect excuse to guilt Draco into coming, since he’d met Teddy once before, and they were cousins. Draco cherished what little family he had left, more than anything.
“Where’s the other one?”
Harry laughed, leading the way up the hillside. He could nearly smell it, nearly hear the rush of the tunneled wind. They were
“Shall we?” Ron asked the room at large, itching to get to work. But Draco had just realized something—
the air is too thick, it’s too hard to breathe—
“A pleasure, Aunt,” Draco said quietly, still studying her face, marveling at the fact that this woman was
Draco’s eyes widened, the color draining from his cheeks. “Circe’s sagging
The corners of Draco’s mouth lifted as that little sun in his chest woke up. How unbelievably miraculous it was to hear Harry Potter say that to him.
“Oh,” Hermione breathed, her eyes wide with shock and understanding. “That means… Does it mean that every time, to purebloods? When you say you’re bound to something—you mean,
And coming closer, closing in around them. Harry couldn’t see past them at all. Eight huge, colourful globes were surrounding them, this was definitely
Harry continued moving, his steps gaining speed until finally, to Draco’s pathetic delight and utter horror, he was right in front of him, his hands gripping Draco’s arms, touching his face, his neck, his chest, checking him for injuries, proving to himself that Draco was actually there, and all Draco could do was watch him.
here, but us.”
“Right. Well, Potter, we’ll discuss that curse first thing tomorrow morning, say, nine o’ clock? I can provide meals. We can meet here, or at your home, or at mine—which would you prefer?” Malfoy asked, and Harry caught a glimpse of curiosity in his eyes, but he suppressed a grimace at the thought of bringing someone else to Grimmauld at the moment. It was a disaster.
“I love you, darling,” she said softly, her voice muffled against his chest. “I hate seeing you hurt.”
Draco looked up, and his breath caught at the sight of the little Seer boy, on his knees at the bars of the cell, panting and lowering his hands.
“Trust me, Pansy,” Harry said quietly, standing in front of her to make her look at him, “you don’t want to.”
That was much more like it. Harry was almost grateful for the jab, for the reminder of who this beautiful man actually was. Ron sighed and crossed the short stone path over
“Did I say something wrong?” Draco asked quietly. Harry shook his head slowly, that alarmed expression remaining. Draco watched him for a moment, searching his face, before looking away and picking up his mug from the table. This seemed to shake Harry out of his daze, and he did the same.
He turned to find another one.
“Do you have any questions so far?” Draco offered. Harry hesitated, holding the pen over the paper.
Draco nodded, as Weasley stared, open-mouthed, at his muggleborn wife. It was a creepy story, and unrealistic—that witch must have been truly senile to be overpowered and outwitted by two muggle children, but she was obviously barmy if she was trying to eat them anyway.
things about him, and his name was on the tag—
“Excellent,” Draco declared, still grinning. “Thank you, Harry. I will figure out what on earth this object is and how to hear music from it, mark my words.”
Lucius looked positively gleeful. If this were any other situation, Draco could have pretended that his father had just learned that his only son was in love, and was brimming with happiness for him. But Draco was chained to a chair, his father’s wand was aimed at his face, maneuvering him like a bloody toy, and Lucius had just discovered Draco’s greatest weakness.
“I had wondered… but I couldn’t know for sure…” Lucius mumbled to himself, before turning back to Draco, eyes brightening. “Then, the Dark Lord is still alive, is he not?”
Harry just watched him a moment more, before grabbing his notebook and turning to a blank page to write.
have been something Draco would do, a long time ago, but he seemed so different, now. Could he really do something like that? Send someone to curse Harry, just so that he could have the credit for saving him?
Now that he was here, however, facing the house’s sophisticated black door and its colourful, overgrown gardens, his nerves were returning in full force. He hadn’t even stopped at Grimmauld to change out of his uniform—what if Draco thought he was here in an “official” capacity? How on earth was he supposed to explain himself then? What if Draco was busy with a patient? What was he even really doing here? Did he honestly think
Draco gripped Harry’s hand like a vice the entire way to Narcissa’s room. They both ignored the stares and whispers, intent on their destination.
“It is,” Harry said. “It’s just you.”
“I know.” Harry’s lips quirked sadly.
“Shall we?” Draco motioned towards the door. Granger seemed to shake herself out of staring at Draco as if he were a complicated Arithmancy problem, and made towards the door, gently pushing it open.
“Harry doesn’t know this,” he said flatly, simply stating a fact.

Harry dropped the parchment, feeling defensive. If Malfoy wasn’t seeing his memories, then

Draco pulls away reluctantly, running the pad of his thumb over Harry’s bottom lip. Harry can’t help but kiss it, savouring the sweet citrus. Draco lets out a breathless little laugh, and it might just be Harry’s new favourite sound.
“This means the bonds have reacted, recently,” Smith explained in his most pompous manner. “Or, they are currently acting in a constant, low-level defense.”
Draco felt like he was drowning under the deluge of emotions he’d held back, but he knew they wouldn’t go away until he’d felt them all. He’d never felt this strongly seeing another person’s memories before, and he’d seen a few shitty childhoods. But a

But also—Lucius Malfoy, “model prisoner”?
“Think we can go for another?” Draco asked. “Snap if you need a break.”
The Potter next to him was staring hard at them, bewildered and frustrated. Draco wondered if he’d have more luck recognizing them like this.
As Harry shrugged on his old leather jacket, Draco decided to try his luck on something.
“I was waiting for that, you know,” Draco said after a moment of quiet as they walked leisurely along the trail.
He held his hand out and summoned it wandlessly, feeling he had to do something slightly impressive in order to make up for his mess, even if he was sitting in front of someone already quite proficient in wandless magic. He pointed the wand at the chalkboard, finally labeling the empty dot “Sectumsempra”.
Harry tore himself away and threw up a hefty shield charm around Draco's prone body, just as the transformation began, the sickening crack of shifting bone and flesh tearing and twisting itself into a massive body covered with inky black fur, piercing Draco with glowing, bloodthirsty green-gold eyes, and one word snarled and spat through a lengthening throat:
“That makes no

Hermione hesitated uncomfortably before answering. “It’s not a very nice story. They sort of fall prey to a cannibalistic old witch with a house made of sweets, who fattens them up like pigs for slaughter. They end up murdering her with her own oven, and barely escaping with their lives.” She shuddered. “Gave me nightmares as a child. Not a good bedtime story.” She thought for a moment. “Also a terrible portrayal of magical people, but not entirely atypical for the muggle world, especially at the time it was written, in the middle ages.”
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco murmured, then threw the gifts aside in favour of kissing him more, closer, deeper. Harry wrapped an arm around his waist and dragged him in, toppling them over on the bed, and then it was only
“Let us begin with something easy,” Lucius muttered, sitting down on a stool in front of him. “Tell me how Harry Potter survived two Killing Curses.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened at the same time as Harry’s, and Harry couldn’t tell if his pale cheeks were turning pink because of Harry’s violence or Harry putting his own foot in his mouth. But the corners of his lips were turning up, exposing sharp, white teeth in a brazen leer.
Harry thought he saw a glimpse of a satisfied smile on Malfoy’s face as he slipped his glasses back on, before it was schooled back into that aristocratic smoothness.
“You look tired, Harry.” There it was again—a definitive exhale, falling from Draco’s lips like a
