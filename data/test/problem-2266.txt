Fear increasing potion- Albus Dumbledore – Fear of snakes, of being different, and of letting the Dursley down given 3 months ago
Acknowledgments: Thank You all for your comments I really appreciate your patients with me, this chapter took longer to get done than I would have liked but here it is hope you all enjoy…
Draco and Harry walked into transfiguration, they were the first ones there, sitting down Harry looked at the cat on the desk and smiles. “Why does she always do this?” Draco whispered looking at the cat. “She wants to see who acts out on their first day.” Harry said smiling more, kinda hoping that Weasley and Granger made fools of themselves. “I see you plotting Har, what are you planning?” Draco asked still whispering knowing Harry wasn’t going to do anything bad, but he was hoping something happened. “I’m not planning Drayk, you know me, I’m just thinking of what would happen if something happened in class.” Harry said pretending to look chocked at Draco.
Everyone landed in the Leaky Cauldron 15 minutes later hoping that no one would bother them. “Ah, Severus is it really that time?” Tom the owner said looking at Harry with such hope in his eyes, only looking away when Harry glared at him. “Yes.” Severus said also glaring at Tom who knows that Harry hates it when people stare at him. “Right well, you all have a wonderful morning so far its not to packed.” Tom said looking uncomfortable getting caught up in the moment every time he got to see Harry Potter. They walked to the back of the building and tapped on the brick wall, as Diagon Alley appeared into view. “Let’s get to Gringotts and then we will have Cissa and Tom grab your books while you get fitted for your robes.” Severus said looking around seeing it really wasn’t as packed as he thought it would be, hoping that this would be an easy trip and they could get home he and Tom still had to do their lesson plans and send it to Dumbledore who had thrown a fit about letting them become professors.
Severus sat down in the chair and then looked at him, clearing his throat he started to speak. “November 1st, 1979 a prophecy was read at a diner in a town called hogsmead by a soon to be professor at the wizarding school in our world. It talked about a child being born on the seventh month would kill the dark lord and he would have powers the dark lord knows not, the prophecy went on stating that those who had faced the dark lord three times and won would produce this child and that he would mark the child as his equal that neither could die in the hands of the other and that as long as one of them lived the other would survive. Now at the time everyone thought the dark lord was a man named Lord Voldemort but there is no such lord, it’s a lie told by the man who really is the dark lord pretending to be part of the light side. That man’s name is Albus Dumbledore…” Severus went to say something but looked down and saw Harry was crying
Harry was fuming by the time he got down to the dungeons. “* Draco meet me in dads quarters. What I’m hearing needs to be heard by them. *” Harry sent out to Draco through the bond. “x Okay, see you soon. x” Draco replied sounding interested and confused on what was going on. Harry walked into his parents quarters ready to throw something. Looking at his dad gritting his teeth he said, “Calming draught now.” Harry was close to losing control. Just as Severus handed his son the draught Draco walked in rushing to Harry. “I’m here Har, breath in deep and out slowly just listen to my voice.” Draco said doing everything Lily had taught them to calm Harry down. “Thanks, Drayk my mother says she’s proud of you.” Harry said looking up at his bonded.
“Now for you Albus Dumbledore, your involvement of all the actions taken against Mr. Potter-Snape and his loved ones past, present and future have not gone unseen and they have been your biggest mistake. My punishment for you is stripping you of almost all your magic. You’ll be able to use basic defense spells nothing that can harm and until you show you’ve learned your lesson that is how you’ll stay.” Lady Magic said as she waved her hand over Dumbledore his magic going into her hand, she took most of his core only leaving a first-year muggle-born amount. With a bow to Harry and Draco, the Lady disappeared leaving parchments addressed to the ministry.
After class Harry and Draco, along with Blaise and Theo started to head straight to Defense class. As they were walking the old goat stopped them. “Harry my boy I would like to speak to you a minute.” Dumbledore said with his grandfather type smile. “So sorry Professor but unless my fathers are present, I won’t be having any conversations alone with you.” Harry said giving him a smile and walked away hoping to get to his fathers class before being stopped again.
Lucius Malfoy, I know we had to hide the fact that we got along and dear brother I am sorry that I am gone, but I hope Harry and Draco become great friends. I leave you vault 589
Harry sat back on the bed but couldn't let Cissa do everything so he waved his hand around in a circle to indicate the whole room and said “Repro” at the same time the room started to repair itself back into the way it was before Harry’s dream then he shrunk when he saw everyone looking at him with a shocked look. “I’m sorry I didn’t mean to be bad I won’t do it again, I just thought I would help.” Harry said pulling his legs to his chest scared he was about to be punished again the dream still fresh in his mind. Tom brushed his hand on Harry’s arm “Harry we aren’t mad, you just did magic without a wand that’s hard to do even for older wizards.” Tom explained looking at Harry with a smile at that Harry looked at Tom’s eyes and saw that Tom wasn’t lying, he then turned to look at Severus and saw he was smiling as well as Cissy. Harry blinked then blushed that he did something that was rare to do even older wizards, he really was a freak how could anyone love him when he could do things like that. Tom looked at Harry seeming to understand what Harry was thinking “Don’t Harry you are not a freak, I said it was hard but its not freakish or bad, and how can we not love you? Harry you have been loved since you were born, your parents loved you and we love you when we lost you… we never stopped looking for you, we have wanted you back so much Harry you mean so much to us.” Tom said as he hugged him and every doubt that Harry had was washed away.
“Tom? Severus? What are you doing here?” Lucius asked seeing the nervousness radiating off Severus as he sat down at the table. “What has that old goat done now? I asked around the Ministry he hasn’t been complaining or asking Fudge about anything, so if he is planning something, they don’t know anything about it.” Lucius said looking a little put out by the glances that Severus kept giving Tom. “Harry had to put a eavesdropping charm on the two lions that have been giving him trouble today, after they tried to put the imperious curse on him. While listening to the conversation Dumbledore spoke to them and got a plan for tomorrow before Harry and Draco go to the Great Hall.” Tom said pausing to let Lucius absorb all the information. “What kind of plan?” Lucius said fearing that he was not going to like this at all. “Dumbledore is going to try and kidnap Draco in order to get Harry to do what he wants.” Tom said waiting for the outburst, but so far it didn’t happen. “Wait you said try? What are you doing to prevent that from happening?” Lucius asked when he saw Severus relax a little, which meant he had been waiting for an outburst. “I have away that would make it to where Dumbledore couldn’t use any kind of port-key on Harry or Draco.” Severus said smiling and thanking Lady Hogwarts for her gift on the day of the purge. “What are you talking about?” Tom asked looking confused on what his husband was saying. “On the day of the purge while I was in sleep state, Lady Hogwarts spoke to me and gifted me a very ancient ward that not even Dumbledore knows about. It will prevent anyone from putting a port-key, tracking spell, or any kind of harmful curse on the boys inside or outside of Hogwarts.” Severus said kinda wishing he had thought to use it from the very beginning of the year. “That’s amazing, but I feel like there is a catch to the ward.” Lucius said also getting a nod from Tom that he was thinking the same thing. “It means that the only way for the boys to use any kind of transportation like that they would have to be willing to use it. I also know that it must be performed every few years to keep the ward strong and if I place it on a bonded pair then I only must place it on Draco and Harry is protected as well. The catch is that if someone places a port-key on either of the boys it would automatically transport them to each other so if Harry is in the middle of one of his trainings with you things could be a little distracting, same for Draco with his training.” Severus said look from Tom to Lucius wondering what they were thinking. “I would rather the boys get distracted in training, then one or both of them get kidnapped.” Tom said as Lucius nodded in agreement and know how good Severus was with wards, he knew his son and god-son were protected.
“Sevvy? What’s going on? Am I in trouble?” Harry asked, finally feeling a bit calmer with someone he knew in the room.
“Your about to regret saying that you old goat. I call upon Lady Magic and invoke my magical right to seek judgement on those who have tried to harm my family and my self, past, present and future. I also ask Lady Hogwarts if she is listening to please lock down the school so the accused can’t escape until punishment has been passed.” Harry said feeling the wave of magic from both ladies. Hogwarts was locked down with in minutes, as Lady Magic just stood there observing each of the accused who all had gone pale. “I am ashamed of you two Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger how could you become so blinded to the evil in your own prejudice hearts. This is not who I gifted magic to you had bright futures ahead of you and you might have just thrown it all away.” The Lady said looking up and down at each of their cores as well as what was truly in their hearts. “I see mostly you have been under spells and potions, but you still have a lot to learn based on what I see in your hearts, so your punishment is this. You Hermione Jean Granger will only be allowed to use your magic during classes nothing more, you are also banned from using the library, you need to learn that books aren’t the answer to everything, so take good notes listen to your teachers and maybe by the end of the year if your heart has changed I will give you full use of your magic again. Your punishment is the same Ronald Bilus Weasley with an added punishment like Hermione’s you are not allowed to harm anyone with your hands or anyone else hands.” Lady Magic said waving her hand and releasing them from the spells, and potions they were on but allowing them to remember what they did and their punishment before putting a timer on their cores.
“That will be the end of that, you two have two weeks detention for your lack of respect.” Professor McGonagall said jumping off the desk. “I will have you know Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger the Headmaster is still very much gay and Miss. Granger being gay is accepted in our world. Maybe not in the Muggle world but in the Wizarding, world being gay is okay.” McGonagall said looking very angry at her lions. “Professor, what right does Draco have in taking Harry way from the option of having a wife and child.” Hermione whined looking at Harry with hunger. “Because Draco didn’t take my rights away. If anything, I took his away when my magic bonded us at Nine years old.” Harry said glaring at Hermione then at Draco with a sad look. “Not that it’s any of your business, who I am with or not nor is it the Ministry or the Headmasters.” Harry said looking back to the two lions behind him with his purple eyes showing again.

Harry was nervous to go, he knew his family would be there but it wasn’t going to be as easy as just going to school when it came to Albus Dumbledore. “Harry you don’t have to go on the train, you can just come with us to the school.” His dad said Harry hadn’t been away from Tom and him long since the day they found him, to say he was nervous for his son would be putting it lightly. “I can’t leave Drayk to go alone besides its part of the experience.” Harry said smiling at his dad knowing his fathers love him a lot to have become teachers. They all got their trunks and headed towards kings cross station, the potter-Snape and Malfoy family helped their kids put everything away saying goodbye they got on the train.
They had heard everything and were both angry. “Maybe had you listen to the people who knew Lily and James best, you would have know that the only way for those so called blood wards the Ministry put up only work if the people caring for Harry gave him love and made him feel at home, if at any point in time Harry didn’t feel loved or feel like where he was living was home the wards would have broken.” Severus said with such malice that the Minister cringed. “Now Severus be a little understanding Harry was with his mother’s sister I’m sure she loved him.” Said Albus giving them a smile that only made putting him in his place more glorious to bring down. “PETUNIA! YOU IDIOTS SENT HIM TO PETUNIA!! Did you not listen to anything Lily said you either of you, did you dunderheads listen to a single word? Why am I asking of course you didn’t why would you listen to the mother of the son you have lost? She Fucking told you under no right or reason was Harry to go to her sister. She hates anything magic, so your damn blood wards would not have worked for I can guarantee that she hated Harry like she hated Lily. How you became Minister of Magic when you are a complete fucking moron is beyond me. I will Vow this right here and right now if I find Harry and his cousin alive they will not have anything to do with you Minister and they sure and hell will have NOTHING to do with you Dumbledore, I Vow on my life and my magic that I will do everything to keep them away from the both of you.” Severus said with such demand that magic swirled around him and sealing the vow.
“You think I care what you want, I am going to have my fill of you, and you are going to comply other wise it will be 100 times worse.” Vernon said with a knowing look suggesting that he knew I wanted to die.
“How dare that man think, that there is something wrong with my behavior.” Harry said getting closer to the edge of a full transformation. “What has Luci found out? I don’t want to go in blind when we go to this so-called meeting.” Severus said pacing back and forth in their quarters looking concerned. “Sevvy, sit down you are going to ware a hole out on the floor, everything is fine he’s just trying to get a rise out of us. I just got done talking to Luci and he said that Dumbledore hasn’t been complaining or trying to do anything at the Ministry. So, Dumbledore is really just trying to get Harry to do something that will give him cause to try to get him away from Severus and I even though legally he couldn’t do it.” Tom said walking to up to his husband and giving him a hug. “Dad, Father, I think we should introduce our trump card, it will probably give us more room to breath and keep him in line.” Harry said but wasn’t sure that his parents would go for that idea, they hadn’t planned to use that bit of leverage until on a later date. “I don’t believe we will have to use that card just yet Harry, but if he continues to be a problem then we will send the documents over as well as watch his face as everything gets blown up.” Severus said also hoping that they didn’t have to use it anytime soon.
Let me know what you all think... Is this easier to read now and should I do this with the rest of the chapters??
“Oh, this poor boy, I hope those horrible muggles got what they deserve,” Cissa said, looking at Severus for confirmation. “Yes, Tom got rid of them; what does Harry need to be healed first?” Severus asks, watching Cissa wave her wand at Harry getting a diagnostic of his health.
“Fine, I want a meet with you and Severus with Harry. I have much to say about his behavior the last few days.” Dumbledore said with fire in his eyes. “I will let Severus know at dinner we will meet right after. Now may I start my class Headmaster you’ve made it late.” Tom said with a tight smile. “I will see you all at eight, don’t be late I’m a busy man and have another meeting.” Dumbledore said as he left the room just as a jar on one for the shelves shattered.
After tregging up the castle stairs, and the stern woman announced the houses, Harry and the rest of the new students entered the Great Hall. “Now when I call your name, you’ll come up here and I’ll place the hat on your head to be sorted into your houses.” Professor McGonagall said and so it began Draco, and Theo where placed in Slytherin, then finally “Harry Potter-Snape.” McGonagall called looking over at harry with understanding. Whispering hello Minni before sitting down and waiting for the hat to speak. “Difficult, very difficult.” The hat said, “Oh no you don’t DUSK, you know exactly where to put me, that old goat is trying to compel you to place me someplace else.” Harry said he wasn’t going to allow, this hat to be defiled. “Thank you, my lord, that old man doesn’t know the release word. Your correct, I do know what house I’m going to put you in.” The hat explained “Better be Slytherin!” the hat shouted as Harry shot out of his seat and sat down next to Draco taking his hand underneath the table. Finally, the sorting was over, and Blaise was the last Slytherin.
Draco reads, casting Pansy’s words out of his mind. He’s at least thankful his lawyer will deal as an intermediary between him and Harry. He can’t meet Harry again, not when his words are still so fresh, wounding his heart like sharpened knives.
With slight apprehension, though, Draco lifts his gaze to meet Harry’s stunned expression. He was not the only one that felt it. Harry is staring at him with wide eyes, mouth hanging open. He licks his lips, and all Draco can do not to jump on him is to interlace his fingers on top of his knees.
When he was little, he would rise before the sun, tip-toe quietly through the halls of the Manor, and slither through a crack in the kitchen’s back door into the cool, misty morning.
"I thought the League was going to start fining people for partisan statements?" Percy asked with a look that was too knowing by half. Of course, he knew, but Hermione wouldn’t have.
“And you love the world, you love magic.” A slow grin plays on Harry’s lips when he cups Draco’s cheek between his fingers.
He sighs, resigned to following her. But the woman comes to a halt at the door to the kitchen once she catches the mess on the table. “What’s that?”
"Good follow through," said Luc. He lifted Atty’s bruised knuckle to his lips and kissed it. The Healers must have not seen to her yet. She waved him off, though the rest of the locker room catcalled. After his Healer check, Harry did his cooldown on the mat by himself instead of on the stationary bikes with the team.
, so different from how glazed and distant they had been before. A smile creeps across Harry’s face, crooked, guarded, as if he’s still doubtful about Draco’s skill, though the song still echoes through the space.
"The Fidelius from before is active. I can re-do it, and you can become the Secret Keeper," Draco said.
The peak builds inside him slowly from the point of contact and explodes between them as Draco calls Harry’s name in a long cry.
Draco nods again, clasping his fingers tighter at the distant look on Harry’s face. “Yes. You did. Saved me from a trip to Azkaban, so... thank you for that.” Again.
Harry stirs, almost causing Draco to stumble back. The bond flares for a single second. He turns his gaze to Draco, it’s still clouded, but it’s more alert now.
I met Hermione and Ron over there. Despite not seeing you, your presence was relaxing. You only showed up when I was about to bolt, and I wasn’t sure if you noticed my trembling hands or just had a knack for good timing.
Draco is still mortified about his attempt at kissing Harry Potter, granted that Harry was polite enough not to bring it up again when they parted ways after the park.
"You didn’t sell them," Harry said, instead. Of course Draco didn’t sell them. Draco, who loved old things and sang to houses and went through auction house records across Europe in a half dozen languages. Draco, who respected magic objects in a different way from anyone Harry had ever met.
Harry closes his eyes, heaving a heavy breath and fighting the pain away from his face. He says, voice small, “I’m sorry.”
He takes a few steps forward. Harry’s easel rests in the middle of the room, almost sparkling from the light where it hits. Resting on the wood, there’s a single large paper, its surface so amber and frail Draco fears touching it. But he approaches it slowly. The light from the windows cast shadows around the face drawn in the paper. His face.
The moment only drags for a second, though it feels like the entire night, before Harry’s stumbling back and almost slipping on his wet shoes.
"There’s a record player in the study, but all I have is the Muggle music Sirius left behind," Harry said.
Harry’s face falls. All the emotions he’s been hiding—consciously or not—drag the corner of his lips down. “I’m… I’m sorry too” he says, voice heavy, eyes pinning Draco to the spot. “Were you alone all this time?”
His friends don’t argue or try to stay. They respect Draco’s wishes and leave with promises that they’re just a Floo call away. Draco vows to call them if he needs anything,
"Oh, I'll be fine. It's no worse than I imagined. Percy had told me George might not be happy I was here. It…it’s sometimes more strange when people pretend everything is fine."
Harry’s eyes move to Draco’s hands, and he pauses for a moment, before tentatively sliding his own across the table. Draco catches himself staring at the long, brown fingers as if they’re alien to him. As if it’s not real, or if Draco hadn’t spent years mapping out every line on that hand, every scar.
It was a rare Friday afternoon match that the Falcons lost to the Pride of Portree. Harry hesitated. He never hesitated. Hesitation ruined your Quidditch game. Harry had been blindly furious at himself. He had been thinking first, and it cost them a whole match. There was no such thing as a perfect season and they were always bound to lose some of the time, but it still felt awful. Everyone backed off during the post-mortem, even though Harry felt like every single team member knew that he was the reason they lost.
. His eyes, his lips, his scent, everything is wrong and Draco can’t help the way his stomach falls at this. He’s not Harry.
The Cup passed to the Harpies that year. Harry turned down England’s offer to play for France. He had never been happier.
Granger stops, face constricted, and Draco can almost see the engines of her mind working. She buries herself in another book for an hour, and no one has any expectation of rescuing her now that she’s delving deep in whatever theory she’s brewing.
"Don’t be silly. I put a lot of work in, and I’m proud of it. It was tricky, but we got you all sorted, didn’t we?" Draco cooed to the house, petting the new ivy patterned wallpaper. God, Harry wanted Draco to talk to him like that.
Draco doesn’t go back to the centre next week. He’s terribly busy with his Healer training and convinces himself he can use his Saturday morning for a bit of rest.
“I think I’ll call you Pax,” he whispers as he sketches, delighted by the foal’s high-pitched chirps, “it means--”
Potter deserves anything he wants. He dedicated himself to defeating evil, when all Draco did was follow said evil, hurt people, and cry in dark bathrooms.
He finds Potter a bit later, after they've put away the chairs. His back is pressed against the exterior wall of the building as he shields himself from the heavy rain falling upon them, a half-burnt cigarette hanging from his fingers and a small grey cat lounging by his feet. He's staring at the sky, and the light coming from the inside frames his body against the darkened street.
He didn’t understand that letting the past go doesn’t mean forgetting. And he sees it when he finally takes down their marriage photo.
Because Draco wants to. Oh, he wishes he could be by Harry’s side, to hold him and be the support Harry needs, but he’s not and he’ll likely never be again.
“Well, it’s a Tree of Life, like our families’. It feeds on the magic of every wizard who’s ever lived in Hogwarts, it uses it to grow. In return, the tree keeps them safe and helps them. Have you ever noticed how things there tend to... happen when you most need them?”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Harry tries to say to him, once his glazed eyes resemble something alive, and he recognises the grey of Draco’s again.
They’ve been married for about six months now, and settling into the new house and routine proved a seamless task. Not that Draco doesn’t believe they might have hardships in the future, they have enough fights as it is. But they’ve been learning together how to communicate with one another and things are slowly falling into place. Even Ruby seems to be adapting fast—though she had made a point of showering the house with cat’s pee after they left her under the care of Pansy to go on their honeymoon.
He Apparates on the spot, without waiting for Pansy. He feels the familiar pull of magic as the world darkens around him for a second before he lands.
“Tell me more about… your trips,” Draco asks, ignoring the question more because he can’t answer it the way Harry wishes, and not because he doesn’t know the answer.
Pansy continued. "But for the sake of Wizarding society, if someone doesn’t tell people like my parents to get fucked, we’re going to have another Dark Lord in ten years. And I know you can be that person because people respect you as a war hero."
Harry’s feet drag him around one couch, eyes darting from the wall overflowing with Draco’s fiction books, to the hearth’s overmantel, where a photograph of a Harry kissing a smiling Draco’s cheek as they stare at each other rests. Harry from the picture moves back a little, but his Draco pulls him back to a kiss on the lips, before it rewinds and starts again.
The minute Harry sat, Miles sat in Harry's lap and was insufferable half the night. Harry kept glancing over at Adrian, but he didn’t seem to mind, and Draco didn’t seem to care either. It also had the added benefit of keeping Theo at the other corner of the room as Theo seemed to dislike Miles about as much as he hated Harry.
"I hate them. I prefer to do community stuff. But the League will never move forward if I don’t put myself out there. All they care about is looking good. So yeah, I’ll do a League event today. If looking at my face makes them do the right thing, I’ll do it."
Everyone at the table, except for them, roars with laughter. Draco has to agree with Harry. In silence, obviously. Apart from all that Saviour of the world business, he’s finding Harry to be genuinely good, caring, and selflessly devoted to those he loves. He is, to this day, amazed at how he secured a man as wonderful as Harry by his side, and he’s determined not to let him go.
The distant pain that comes with Harry’s condition is diminished by the certainty that he’ll fix it, even when none of them—Granger, Pansy or Draco himself—can identify the curse in Harry’s body.
But Draco, Harry realised belatedly, was very much not used to it. He stood stiffly by the entryway, face blank and eyes cold. Harry followed, trying to figure out something to say.
When Draco left that evening, it was without saying goodbye, and Harry thought he might have crossed some invisible line.
A hand rests on his shoulder, and Draco turns to the side to meet Marvin’s broad smile. “I’m glad you’re back,” the man says. Draco will come back every week, though, and his therapist knows this.
"We’ve all seen photos of Albus Dumbledore when he was young." Daphne punctuated her points with a mushroom crostini. "You’re lying if you said you wouldn’t."
"Spare me," said Daphne. "Or at least spare Potter who did not ask about Marietta Edgecombe's sister's tits."
This is Draco’s second year of spending his Saturday mornings in the Community Centre, in meetings all too intense. Despite his frequent attempts at avoiding the attention on him, he always leaves these sessions with a lighter heart.
"I had to go see my parents' solicitor. Every few months my father accuses me of having stolen one thing or the other, then I have to come up with documentation that it either always belonged to me or that it’s somewhere in the Manor."
“I don’t hate you, but... when I look at you, it’s just—it feels like it was all two months ago for me.”
“They must kiss. They always kiss in the end,” Harry says, and his lips are on Draco’s. And it’s even better than that day at the park.
Hermione cries a bit, head shoved against his shoulder. But it doesn’t matter how many times she, Pansy, or Blaise say it’s all going to be alright. Draco is making peace with the fact that nothing is ever going to be right again.
words getting lost in the waves of despair, nausea, and anguish. He mindlessly cast a Patronus, desperate for help, and it took Pansy and Hermione half an hour to manage to get him away from Harry.
And then Harry’s cheeks turn a tone redder as he averts his gaze. “Do you know where I got my tattoo? Nobody seems to know, and since we... You know... I gathered you might.”
And this is not the right table. It’s too exposed. But this is not the right Harry, so he tries not to get too caught up in details. None of that matters, if he can’t recognise this man.
The bridge’s wooden railing is intersected by small stone pillars, covered in a plethora of shells of varying sizes and forms. Draco skates his hand across the handrail, fingers groping the shells lightly, afraid they might either disappear at his touch or cut with their pointy edges. Nothing happens, as if he’s not touching anything at all.
Time feels different. A concept he can’t quite grasp as he holds to the only certainty he still has: Pansy gave him ten minutes in death. Ten minutes to find
Harry pulls away further, and Draco has to grip his mug again to prevent himself from reaching out. This feels important, even if he can’t quite grasp why. It’s not like Harry would
He wants to scream, but then Elle’s face creases in pain. Draco’s chest warms smugly at her silence. It lasts one second, before guilt is thrumming inside him. He’s here to treat her, not inquire about her odd and (in)convenient friendship with his ex-husband.
There was something still cautious about the way Draco dealt with Harry. Harry felt unsettled because it was like they had stirred up the dregs of their history, when he meant to leave it alone. He didn’t care. Or at least, he didn’t want to care enough to re-litigate something he thought he had let go. His Mind Healer said that Harry wasn’t responsible for other people or all the social ills of the world.
"Right, well. I’ll need a few more things. Any coins on you?" Draco rummaged in the pockets of his own trousers, holding up a two pound coin. Harry produced a Galleon and a Sickle. Draco spun his wand and then tapped each item until it was the correct size.
Harry emerges from wherever he’s been hiding the past few minutes and Draco makes a point of staring straight at him and not at the new man in the kitchen.
“We can’t be together anymore,” Harry blurts. His words are expelled so quickly, it feels like he’s just breathing them out.
Harry stood up. "Of course, yeah, sorry. Thank you for that," he said. Wherever Draco had gone in his head, he stood still, staring down at the pattern of the carpet.
“Sure,” Draco says weakly, and is relieved by the distraction when Kreacher shows up with two plates of spaghetti.
"You have money, and you look like that." Draco made a large sweeping motion with his hand. "You don’t need a style."
Far from Draco to be annoyed by the company, even if it implies having to lend some of his hard-won clothes to Harry, or dealing with double the amount of mess that he’s used to—although he likes to call his own an organised chaos. Draco’s so used to Harry’s presence at his flat now that being alone in there feels almost weird. The apartment is… lacking when he’s by himself.
“Mate?” he hears and turns to be blessed with a Ronald Weasley in a blinding, saturated orange shirt that’s doing things to Draco’s nerves. But to be fair, it might be just his presence.
"What are you going to say to me? That I would know about being a coward? I do. I’m not saying this for his sake. I’m saying it for yours. Don’t let him walk away from you."
be back. It doesn’t matter that ten minutes feel like ten days when he’s sure he would spend a lifetime here if it means he can be with Harry again. But Draco will be back, and Harry will come back with him.
Harry’s eyes are still closed, but his face is creased in a scowl, his fingers coming to rest on Draco’s forearm.
“We are not sure. She was fine the entire day,” the Mediwitch says, shaking her head. They stroll fast down the corridor, Elle’s door almost visible. “It was very sudden. Miss Carrey is not responding to any of the earlier treatments. The prognosis is that her curse is still active.”
She was so comfortable and happy these days, it was hard to begrudge her anything. She had broken his heart once, and he still felt that sometimes, when he caught a glimpse of her as he remembered her best. But she had freed them both for a different kind of contentment, and Harry could appreciate that now.
“What is this?!” is the first thing Blaise says as soon as his eye catches Draco’s. “Morgana and Merlin together, Draco Malfoy is going to a pub!” he shouts to no one in particular on the busy street. A couple passing by smirk at them. But other than that, no one says a thing, despite Draco’s churning stomach. “Someone call the authorities—”
That seems like a terrible bargain, though. Draco keeps the house, but loses everything else that matters.
He risks staring at his reflection, and it hurts to see what has become of him. His complexion remains fairly sickly, and his clothes don’t fit as perfectly as they once did, but at least the scorching water gave him a slightly more natural blush.
“What…?” She starts, but Weasley cuts through her inquiry with a rushed, “I don’t want to know. I absolutely don’t want to know.”
"But you don’t watch the whole game play out before you start changing things," Draco said, watching Harry start to move Kenmare’s Chasers to flank the Beaters instead.
“It’s not your fault. I’m sorry I’m putting you through this,” Draco says faintly. “I’ll try to control it better from my end.”
Harry lodges himself in the circle of Draco’s arms, his breathing slowly evening out. “You’re… You have people who love you, Draco. You’re not alone.”
Harry would have thought such pettiness was beneath them. Harry’s thoughts must have shown plainly on Harry’s face because Draco said, "My parents are deeply unpleasant people with a lot of money and a grudge. This is just the tip of the iceberg with them. Come."
"Hi Pansy," Harry said. Pansy busied herself tidying her desk although all the pens and quills looked plenty organised.
"You weren't there in eighth year, and also, you wouldn't have attended if you were invited," Neville said. Neville was, of course, right. The spiralling Harry had been doing on his own took precedence. And Ron and Hermione hadn’t been together then so Harry wasn’t surprised neither of them had brought it up.
"Oh," Neville said. "Would you look at that? I don’t think I’ve seen an Ampelos vine outside of a textbook. This must be what's keeping everything alive." Neville reached a tentative bare hand to the vine.
But the next morning, when Draco pulls Harry closer to his chest, whispering apologies in his ear, Harry doesn’t wake up.
"Do you want a drink?" Pansy asked. She put Harry in the armchair by the fireplace which sank comfortably, enveloping Harry in blue velvet. Harry shook his head. Pansy busied herself with a kettle anyway.
"I love camp week. I wish I could take all of the kids home." Pansy’s office overlooked a small corner of the pitch where kids were being herded into the building. She watched them scramble with a small smile on her face.
choked on my throat. I rested my head on your shoulder, a sigh heated the air in front of me. “You always look good too.”
Harry had never been in a position to deny that he was a good person, but he wasn’t as nice as Pansy made him out to be.
It’s everything Draco’s ever hoped for. It’s more; different. The lips are the same: the texture Draco knows so well, the curves he’s navigated a million times before. But they taste different, sweeter. Harry’s tongue is rougher, more urgent now, when it invades Draco’s mouth, as his fingers close on Draco’s nape and he all but closes the distance between their chests.
Draco sags in his chair, a bit terrified, a bit relieved. “I gather you’ve heard this lecture before?” Harry nods. “And you won’t stop drinking coffee?” He shakes his head. “Then, can I gift you with some fine beans I’m sure won’t be as detrimental to your health?”
“Beautiful,” Harry finishes. “I would have never guessed you could play like this. You always seemed so…” Harry motions his hands broadly, but the meaning seems to escape his grasp too and he shrugs. “That was great.”
The plants Harry had loved caring for before are moved into the garden and Kreacher seems to have fun tending to them. Harry’s painting studio is transformed into a child’s room, filled with toys for Teddy for when he wants to stay over.
Harry raises a brow. “Draco, this is the place we come when we die.” His face is serious, constricted as he fights the words he doesn’t seem able to say. “Are you…?”
The match played out in the shadows for Harry. A circle passed Oliver, and Harry furrowed his brow trying to follow the Chasers. Their Chasers weren’t any better, falling out of sync and sticking too close together to score well. Both Milo and Luc played like it was a Hogwarts match, amateurish and clumsy. Harry couldn’t spot the Snitch anywhere when he wasn’t being distracted.
"Not right now. I really am very busy." Harry laughed. He was supposed to leave it there, but he added, "I think I’d like there to be. If the right person came along." Harry wouldn’t linger on it, but the desire was there sometimes.
Draco paused for a long moment and took a sip of water. "Definitely related. Theo is my ex. We’re still friends, but that’ll always be there."
“I lost him. I lost him again, Pans,” he says, two mornings of complete silence later, when Pansy finds him bundled up inside his blankets in the same position he’s been in since he left St Mungo’s. “And this time he’s here, and he’s awake, and I don’t have him.”
"I’ll see you back here bright and early for training, folks. Early is on-time, on-time is late, and, if you’re late, Merlin help you, because I certainly won’t," Coach said.
"I’m beginning to lose faith in humanity. I don’t understand why the fuck would someone take this." Harry gestured at a bird bath that they moved into the garden.
Right. Ten minutes, Pansy had said. He has ten minutes here to find Harry and bring him home from whatever this place is.
Luna brought him to the centre for one of the Saturday sessions, and Draco kept coming back. Luna doesn’t come so often anymore, not since she started her Healer training, and he’s still far from finding the answer he needs, but thinking about his past isn’t as painful as it was right after the war.
"They haven’t decided on that yet for next year," Stella reminded him. "Must be the weather, but I think everyone’s here today except for Queenie."
There was only one thing Harry found more insufferable than a hot person, and it was a hot person who was well aware they were hot.
decision. Together. And if they will both pretend it’s all because of Draco’s ‘dork-ness’, so be it.
"You’re being told off for your disloyalty," Ginny corrected. Even Hermione had been photographed wearing a tiny Falcons or Harpies pin on her barrister’s robes on match days.
Draco doesn’t take long washing the dishes. He takes a shower and goes to look for Harry. He finds him on their bed, sound asleep, curled inside the blankets.
"So," she said. She sank into the grey armchair opposite, sipping from her own mug. It was the weakest yet bitterest cup Harry had ever tasted in his life. He was touched by the gesture all the same. "You’re in love with him."
The grey cat follows them on their quiet stroll around the block, before disappearing inside a garbage bin. It’s awkward and strained, but the absurdity of the situation is such that neither of them tries to talk or leave.
Harry didn't even miss the extra touching. It used to be that he loved being on the Quidditch team at Hogwarts just because he had grown up touch-starved, and he could glut himself on casual friendliness of a shoulder bump, a huddle, bodies slumped against each other in exhaustion. His friends were used to it, and they let him, although they didn’t quite understand it. Teddy and his friends’ kids were thrilled, realising early on that Harry would let them crawl all over him for far longer than most adults.
"I can get one working no problem. It’s accuracy that’s the problem. Home, school, and work are fairly simple, but dealing with abstract concepts is trickier," Ron said. His neck was a bit red.
"Harry James Potter, to whom I owe my life, what is it you wish of me?" Draco asked. His voice was smooth and lower than usual.
“There’s something... I haven’t told anyone,” Harry admits, finally. His eyes dart around the room, insistent on avoiding Draco’s. “It’s nothing, really. Just...”
He notices new things about Harry every day, how he’s becoming a whole new person in tiny details: Harry shaves the sides of his head and stops using glasses because they make him feel older. He still takes some potions to help his body adapt after the long coma, but he finds comfort in exercising every day. Harry’s smile is broader, he’s wilder now, more active.
“Harry thinks he surrendered himself to Voldemort a few moments ago.” Her voice is soft, contradicting her heavy words. He can’t believe it.
"It’s not new. I just didn’t want to tell you because I was afraid you’d react the way you are now."
"Rosie-Posie, we use gentle touch, yes? You know Crooks doesn’t like his hair being pulled, same as you," Ron said without looking.
"Aren’t I?" Harry muttered. But he tried to relax his shoulders and let his brow smooth. He was warm and uncomfortable with everyone watching him.
Draco’s a bit startled to come back to Harry’s laughter, as he looks at the board Draco has hanging on the only wall clear of shelves or piles of books .
“For Salazar’s sake, Draco,” his father hissed through the library’s Floo connection, angry at having been awoken in the small hours of the night, and angrier still at being pelted with
Taking the hall to the outside stairs; moving in slow motion though he’s pretty sure he is walking quite fast.
Harry looks up in time to see the way Draco grabs the wine bottle by the neck, how he looks disappointed, a stern look on his face, pouring another quite large glass of red and standing up in a fluid motion.
“Yes Draco, indeed,” Sirius sing-songs just like Aunt Bella does, but when he does it, he sounds nice and warm and not mean at all. “You are the
And Draco, sweet, sensitive, gentle Draco, welcomed Harry’s shame, sheltered Harry’s fears with a barricade of understanding. He made Harry feel normal and accepted, like any other kid would have been dealing with such huge conflicts. He made Harry feel seen and embraced and cared.
Harry kisses him, trying to voice his needs with his tongue against Draco’s lips. It starts soft and sweet, but there’s an urgent need to it, and suddenly the kiss turns messy and delirious, wet and hot— feverish as last night, but even more.
Sirius laughs softly, and stares at the empty doorway—with teary eyes and his heart full—for a long while after Harry closes the door to his room, he has a wonderful family and Harry deserves all the happiness in the world.
His flat is in complete darkness. He thinks that maybe it’s just a perfect mirror of how he feels in his heart. Actually, that’s a lie. There is a bit of an orangey light coming in from the street lamps. It makes his room look like a scene in a film. Yes, maybe his life is just like a film.
Harry asks himself if it started way before, over breakfasts at Hogwarts staring at Malfoy and his parcels full of treats sent from home. He asks himself if it started with late nights watching Draco’s steps on the Marauder’s Map, or if it started when he bumped into the Slytherin wearing lime green robes at St Mungo’s two years ago.
The grey eyes pin him to the spot. And Sirius was right all along: Harry is not capable of lying to him.
“Though, you know,” Remus says, a naughty smirk forming on his lips. “He keeps nagging me about how much he dreams of tasting my cum and how it bloody saddens him that he will never know.”
“So I met his friends and we talked, and they said Draco has some pretty valid reasons. And they were really worried that this was going to break him, and Draco is depressed so I now worry too, because what if this is what does the trick and he—he—
At some point though, things started changing. Some of the fantasies and kinks Draco wanted to try out made Harry cringe, made him feel uncomfortable under his own skin with only the bare thought of it. He started saying no to many proposals.
Out of fear of rejection. Because last time Harry told him no, last time he said he was not comfortable with picking up another dude in a club, Draco said his freedom was very important to him and he would like Harry to respect that.
“I have never made love to anyone in my life!” he sobs, spitting. And admitting it hurts so much, cuts so deep. “And now, now who the fuck is going to want me? To love me? To endanger their health to make love to me? To look me in the eye when we are naked and vulnerable and on the verge of an orgasm and tell me—tell me th-they love me?!”
She ends up tugging him gently out of her arms, prompting him into a chair, and sits in the opposite one, holding his hand while she does so. Her own eyes are shiny and her pale cheeks reddened, but she hasn’t cried.
Harry frowned. It was like they had gone back to day one, and Draco was being overly formal. Harry had probably brought this on.
We met only once more at PRTND. Luna lent me one of her dresses and, apart from changing my face, did little in terms of hair. It felt good. Not entirely comfortable, but just being able to wear anything I wanted, not worrying about what anyone would think. It was easier with a stranger’s face instead of mine, but it was a
The owl hoots softly, raking its head against Draco's cheek, and only then does Draco realise his skin is wet. A stray tear falls on the envelope, marring the ink that forms
"That hurts my feelings," Harry said. "I’d like to think I was hot at sixteen." Harry was joking, because he wasn’t much for assessing his own looks. In some important ways, he felt like the exact same person, even if objectively, he had gotten a bit taller and bulkier in the meantime. Harry had been eighteen by the time they got to the trials.
Draco doesn’t look at Harry when he replies, “Curse-damage. I’ve decided what specialty I want to undertake at St Mungo’s.”
"I don't like Muggle supermarkets. They are too loud and crowded, and I don't have time to Apparate and exchange money at Gringotts on my lunch."
"It would hurt me if the papers said things about you," Harry admitted. To Harry, that was more than just affection. Wasn’t that waiting? Wasn’t that a declaration?
"Narcissa’s boy, aren’t you? My dear grand-nephew. Have you decided to restore the house of Black to former glory?" Harry had never heard her use this sweet, wheedling tone before. He preferred the screaming.
"Absolute nonsense! He attacked my player!" Coach was also screaming. Coach, at one point, switched to Spanish, in which he said a number of rather rude things about the referee's eyesight and mother.
Harry’s memories can come back tomorrow, or he can spend the rest of his days without knowing what happened during the twelve years after he died in the battle.
Draco’s eyes cast to the nearest exit, considering if there’s the slightest chance he can make it and slip away from her unheard-of worried gaze.
"Wasn’t that also the year you spent in love with Malfoy and Nott?" Adrian asked. He managed to sound scandalised, even though he had draped himself sideways over Miles' lap. Theo looked amused as he drank his wine and ordered food for the table.
it, but to know that something is there is one thing, to know its history is another matter entirely.
"No problem," Harry said, even though his vision was going fuzzy at the edges. It didn’t feel like a break, Harry thought distantly. He made it back to the pitch on his own, but the team had formed a protective phalanx around him.
Draco’s sure his heart stops for a second, but when it starts again, it slams so hard against his chest he thinks it’ll break free.
If it had been any other time and he hadn't already been dealing with heightened emotions, Harry might have dealt with it more diplomatically. If it had been himself who was injured he would have shrugged it off. But there was the famous Potter temper, because instead of doing the sensible thing and turning around, Harry simply said, "Do it then. Fuck you," and threw his broom on the ground.
He had his own memories from before Barb and Pansy had decided letting him see his own name in print was not helping his post-War mental health.
Draco sputters, taken aback, and laughs surprised at Molly. And her almond-shaped hazel eyes turn to Harry, knowingly. And Harry feels busted. He asks himself if she sees it, the rainforest storm inside his chest, the strong tide of affection running deep inside his bones, if it’s visible to everyone else.
Harry yearns for that kind of love and connection. He parks in front of the LGBT Centre and turns off the car.
Maybe it was after their holiday trip to Tuscany with Blaise and Pansy last summer, when they talked about the massive adventures of their open relationship.
He feels bold. Oh, so bold. He’s been jerking off to the idea and the pictures of Draco for weeks now.
So when Harry watches Draco on that sunny morning, sitting on the threadbare rug in the drawing room of Grimmauld Place, with his naked legs and a steaming cup of coffee in hands, Harry wants to keep him.
“We will see about that, pup,” Moony winks. “I just worry about you, Harry. And you deserve some fun, that’s all.” He affectionately caresses Harry’s shoulder. "Have fun tonight," he watches Harry with a warm smile on his face, says his goodbyes and then runs out of the car.
“No, but, hear me out,” he insists. “You are in love with this bloke, you have never seen him, and he doesn’t seem like he is ready to meet in person. You are putting all your real-life life on standby waiting for him to take the leap.”
His head was providing, over and over again, images of the way Draco’s fingers paused in the tender skin under his earlobe, their wedding ring shining golden, and the Austrian guy licking his lips.
“Oh here, I have a picture of him in my purse. Draco is the most handsome, you will see, he has the Black eyes,” she says, laughing proudly and reaching for her purse. “Do you have a photo of Harry? I’m curious now.”
“Oh boy...” he mutters, shutting his eyes closed and lying down, feeling the room spinning around him in dizzying circles. “HURRY UP, DAD, I’M GOING TO FAINT!!”
“That was before, okay?” Harry lets out. “And I feel safer here, that’s all. At least until I’m sure Moony is all well and safe and healthy,” he shrugs and sticks a tongue at Sirius.
Narcissa looks good. The years have made her features a bit softer, her cold steely eyes still look too sharp and too cold, but there are some kind wrinkles at the edges that make the sharpness smudge into something like amiability.
“Harry,” there’s such softness in Draco’s voice that Harry’s shoulders relax, like coming home, like giving in and stopping fighting. The blond stretches his arm over the wooden table top and holds Harry’s hand. “I would never leave you for anyone else,” his voice is kind, his grey eyes are soft and there’s this small, beautiful smile on his lips, though a bit sad; “I love you.”
“Oh well,” Moony says. “This is the worst cake ever,” he admits and they all laugh at it. He pouts at the cake and looks from Harry to Sirius. “Your godfather is meeting a long-lost cousin next week,” he finally says.
Draco sucks one ball into his mouth then the other, then both. He feels greedy and starved and alive. So fucking alive and the heat inside his body is one overwhelming feeling of raw pleasure and surrender.
tw: this chapter contains a scene of someone cutting their foot non intentionally and there’s blood, so if you are sensitive, just message me and I can send you an un-blooded-version. also: naughtiness ^^
Harry is no boy. He’s 29 and he’s pretty sure there is nothing wrong with not indulging in all his partner’s fantasies.
“I press the issue?” he growls. “I cannot fucking believe you, Potter!” His voice echoes, irritated in their living room.
Harry stops hearing. It’s weird how the body can function in situations of tension. He hears nothing but his heart pounding madly inside his rib cage. His fingers are tingling and his breath stutters as he moves blindly.
There’s this beautiful ringing of pure laughter and it lightens the mood of the room. Remus’ laughter has a deep, rich quality to it that transfixes Draco.
They have been trying it out for a few months now. And everytime Harry feels a mix of regret and excitement and jealousy to see Draco entertained by other men.
While people are having cups of tea and eating biscuits in the back of the room, Remus leads Draco back to a pair of chairs and they sit, looking at each other, still a bit surprised.
“He will know how to go about it,” Remus says kindly and pats Draco’s shoulder. “If you need, he will know how to teach you and lead you through all the protection measures.” He adds, starting to stand up. “Now, I apologise for this rather uncomfortable talk,” he laughs, entertained.
The other day, he went to bed after reading Harry’s long email about dragons. It was so sweet and full of images and tidbits of the story—it warmed his heart. One of the photos was of Harry kissing the miniature plastic dragon, his glasses sitting askew on his nose. He looked so good, his olive skin and unruly hair and a stupid beanie on the top of his head. He wanted to hug him, to snog him senseless. Harry has been the best thing that happened to him lately.
And then it all clicks into place, as if turning a switch inside his mind, a light turning on in his brain. His mouth forms a stupid
Loves how Draco tastes like dessert and red wine and warmth and reality. How his hair feels like satin and his skin is warm and wonderful.
Harry stumbles in the hallway and Draco laughs, manic, delighted, high. And Harry laughs with her, her, her. He holds Draco’s hand and stares at her lovely face, the messy makeup, the sweaty brow, the long blonde hair sticking to the sides of her face.
In the sorrowful hours of dusk, Draco was the one who stayed awake chatting with him while Remus was in the hospital and Sirius paced the house like an empty shell.
He wishes Draco would look at him that way without the extra kinks and fantasies and other men involved. He wishes they could go back to the start when each other's presence was more than enough to ignite that specific kind of fire inside their loins and that torturous tremor on their bodies.
, Draco and Harry had breakfast. Draco was over the moon, speaking fast, gesticulating, a glint of happiness in his eyes.
Draco takes a deep breath, body shivering with an arousal that makes him ache deep inside his bones, and heat that pools down his navel and makes him grow harder. He licks Harry’s cleft, needy and hungry and a kind of debauched joy burns him inside out.
“Take me,” Harry whispers hotly against Draco’s lips. And he sounds desperate, like a castaway coming back from the sea after months of thirst and starvation. “Please,” Harry gasps, as Draco holds Harry’s half-hard cock firmly and pumps it in his hand. “
And Draco can relate to that, feeling scared and worried. Because he’s been keeping Harry at arm’s length of his naked body with all his might. Even last night, when they ended up getting a bit too greedy, Draco thought he was going to lose it,  give in and tell Harry to just fuck him right there in the back of the dark cinema.
This is my favourite chapter so far. I loved writing it, and I hope you guys enjoyed reading. I think my endless love for Wolfstar was very pronounced, wasn't it? Thank you for all the comments and kudos and encouragements! Maybe drop a line today? I think this chapter rather deserves some love. Draco, my darling, you definitely deserve all the love in the world and many, many years to live and love and find happiness <3
He wonders if he’s getting old. If something is wrong with his libido. If he should go to a sex therapist or something.
Draco looks up at Harry with excitement written all over his face. “Walden has one of the most exquisite homoerotic art collections of the 19th century, all safe under protected wards in his estate. Guess what, Harry?” he beams at him and Harry smiles, checking Walden's smug face floating. “We are bringing it to London!”
“Sorry that I was late,” he starts, and his voice sounds like warm tea and chocolate cake. It’s weirdly calming. “I hear you talk and I hear myself,” he says, looking at Draco and he lets out a bitter laugh, shaking his head and sighing sadly. “I was nineteen and had sex only twice in my life when I was diagnosed,” he tells them. There’s such sorrow in his eyes. “I hated myself so much for trying it out with a man, for craving it so much that I fucked up everything.”
Because last night, they were inside their mutual dream but now, in the light of day, it feels real, palpable, it feels so bloody human. Draco moves forward and with his hands on Harry's hair, he ruts his  hips, rolling them over and pinning Harry onto the mattress.
He loves Draco, his sharpness, his imperfections, his curiosities, the way his eyes shine and dart quickly to check if Harry is still there.
And then Harry is tasting her, because Draco doesn’t wait, she just moves closer and plants her lips against his, soft and sticky and tasting like cherry lip gloss and whisky. Draco tastes perfect, perfect, perfect.
“You were shit,” he spits, before taking a sip to calm himself. “You were all shit.” His voice is firm now, and he feels sorry for Narcissa’s son.
“I don’t understand why you’re still with me if I’m obviously not enough for you...” he said honestly.
And it’s delicious and terrifying and marvelous and arousing. Draco presses open-mouthed kisses over his hole, stretching Harry’s arse cheeks with his hands and sucking on the coarse skin of his heavy balls.
Harry wants to lay his head against Draco’s shoulder and savour his smell, to touch his high cheekbones with the tip of his nose and kiss the side of his lips. He wants to thank him for saving Harry from the darkest shadows of guilt and regret and shame.
Harry feels the sexual tension start to dissipate, his mind turning down the wrong path. He closes his eyes, hands on Draco’s waist pushing him backwards.
“Well, Theodore, I wouldn’t mind showing you,” Blaise plays along, voice smooth and velvety and Draco cackles, seeing Theo finally flush at the offer. “It’s when someone kisses and licks your arse, Theo. Quite enjoyable, if you wanna know my humble opinion.”
(A bit about grieving: in psychology we often work with grief not only in the sense of losing loved ones, grieving is very common when someone discovers a condition or illness or goes through a divorce, but also in positive changes like getting married, moving to a new city/job/country, having a baby, because there is normally a bit of loss/grief in any life-changing experiences (be it big and traumatic or small and smooth). It can be expressed in several ways and it's very, very, personal. )
He wants so much to meet Draco and the shiny figures make him think of him. How much he wants to bring him to the bookshop, and introduce him to his friends and family. To go out for a cuppa together and just look at him. He looked lovely in all the pictures they shared. High cheekbones and a big smile on his face. He wants to see that smile, to touch it, to kiss it.
Draco takes a sip of his wine, watching Harry. He seems concerned and interested at the same time, as if he’s trying to understand the puzzle that is Harry Potter. His jaw works, he presses his lips together in a thin line, a frown forming on his brow.
“What? It’s true, because my wonderful cousin Bella caught beefy Arpàyd Krum and me going at it in the guest room.”
Maybe, after the turbulent waves of anger, maybe there’s still hope for Draco. And even if it’s not Harry, maybe he will find someone to love him somehow, at some point.
Draco’s never done something like this before, he tries to remind himself. They are probably just smoking a cigarette. Draco never goes hunting without him. It’s always both of them, even though Draco is the one to lure the men in.
Much love your way, my darlings, may 2021 bring us new starts and safer grounds! Keep healthy and hopeful! Happy New Year! Love, Tai.
is a stand alone story, and whatever comes next will be just me giving it a bit of extra information.
“Should I point out that you should get laid?” Remus asks looking out of the window. “I feel like that’s something Padfoot would say right now.”
His blood is buzzing in his ears and his magic is buzzing all over his body, like a second skin, uncontrolled and mad.
Harry deflates against the chair, feeling his whole body weighing much more than it normally does. He hates it. He hates to feel so close to this man and at the same time so distant. It’s like Draco is intangible. A ghost, ethereal and unreachable.
Harry watches him—Sirius always talks about that in this rich, sarcastic way. Harry is pretty sure deep down it had been awful, terrifying even. Though the story leads to Sirius going to live with Harry’s dad and his parents at the tender age of 17.
Harry is playing a board game with some teenagers at a corner table and stuffing his face with cinnamon rolls. He smiles at Draco.
Surrendering is like letting the tide pull you under, or allowing the winds to guide the way. It’s like a specific kind of quietness, a gentle silence that is not barren—on the contrary, it’s a pregnant silence filled with pleasant emotions.
His hands are shaking slightly and he feels like crying all over again. So he takes a long shower, puts on some warm clothes and sits in front of his computer. Turning it on with shaky fingers.
“Yes,” he says, memories messy and blurry with emotions and the rain and the cold that comes from both outside and inside his body. “He’s white—I mean, he is not black,” he shakes his head, confused with his own words. “He’s blond, and looked pale, very thin... I-I don’t know, I didn’t see him close enough. It’s just—like a glimpse. Not enough. I don’t know how to explain.”
“I was angry at him because I was in love with him,” Remus says, and there’s a sad silence. “I thought:
He cleans himself while waiting for Draco to reply. It was taking a while, so Harry moves around the room and puts on a clean pair of pyjamas and an old fluffy sweater. On his way, he ends up knocking off the miniature pine plant pot from the windowsill. It clashes loudly against the floor, dirt and porcelain scattering everywhere.
Unannounced, the man moves closer and brings Draco into a strong impromptu hug. His arms close around him, pressing Draco’s wet face against the leather jacket. He smells like cigarettes and men’s aftershave. He rubs circles on Draco’s back and shushes him until Draco’s sobs quiet down.
“I’ll take care of you, now,” Draco whispers, dropping his kisses lower, against the round, meaty globes of Harry's arsecheeks; softly, gently, breathing his scent in.
“I will tell you what would be fun,” he tries and Draco smiles dirtily at him, all ears. “You will suck my cock and then I will fuck you against the countertop...” Harry counters hotly, feeling his whole body shake with the idea, a deep sensual need pooling between his legs, canting his hips against Draco’s, pulling the shirt off his arms.
“C’mon, old man,” Blaise chastises. “It’s not like the man will be hung like a horse and the condom will break,” he adds with a teasing eyebrow going up. “Or is he?”
Harry watches the blush creep from the open neck of Draco’s sweater and run up to his pale cheeks, tinting them in a deep pink hue. Harry wants to touch the colour on his cheeks, feel them warm under his own palm.
“Yes. So I took my rightful time to mull it over. I don’t know what she wants or what she needs, but I finally agreed.”
He just wanted the man to leave and Draco to be satiated enough and to go back to their cozy little life.
“I thought, what if it was all but a dream?” Harry whispers, his voice secretive and small. “Sometimes,” he explains, bringing their chests together, skin on skin, warm and delicious and making them shiver as he rubs his lips against Draco’s jaw. “Sometimes I still think it’s all a dream, and that you will disappear if I close my eyes for too long,” Harry whispers, looking up at Draco, and Draco holds his hips, firm and real.
And the truth is right there, in front of everyone’s eyes to see. In front of all these strangers that share the same condition.
When Remus looks up, there are tears trickling down his cheeks; he looks bitter and mad. His sad hazel eyes look straight at Draco’s grey ones, almost as if he could see his soul.
“It’s alright, kid. Go on,” says the old man by his side, Mr. Dumbledore, egging him on. And Rolf is watching him intently from across the circle of chairs, nodding. “Let it all out, pet.” Mr Dumbledore encourages.
The sunlight dances over him like a spotlight, his hair shines with a golden quality, his mouth moves softly around whispered words but Harry can’t hear what he says. He looks almost childish, sitting there, vulnerable in a way Harry never imagined to see Draco in his home.
Harry James Potter, go read the goddamn email, you shit! xD Much love your way, my darlings. What comes next now?
The way his eyes shine, his hands gesticulating excitedly, mouth moving fast as he talks to the other man, then keeping quiet and focusing completely on the Austrian good looking dude and whatever it is they’re talking about.
And Molly laughs at him, patting his cheek softly, kindly. Muttering when would they have ever imagined having Draco round their kitchen so often, and how he turned into such an admirable young man.
“He chose you. Maybe he’s going through this moment of life in which he just wants to live a little. But he wants to live this with you.” She points, and she’s right. Draco never seemed eager to fuck around without Harry’s presence.
But now Remus was back home and Sirius had returned to work. Things were slowly getting back on track. Harry just wanted something good to come out of the whole ordeal, and Draco seemed to be the best thing about it.
His voice rings through the cold breeze like a spell. Like old magic. Like something stronger and deeper than Draco had felt in years.
“Sirius?” Remus' voice comes from the hallway and soon enough he is in the entryway of the kitchen and then hurrying towards them. “What happened, Harry?”
“Yes... well, after school—after Mum died, I mean—it was bad, Draco, really bad.” Draco remembers how Theo’s mom’s passing made his friend close himself off and retreat from their group of friends for almost a year. “My head was a pretty bad place to live in.” He huffs a bitter laugh and goes on. “So at one point, my gran took me to a psychologist. I felt so stupid. Jesus Christ, in my head, I thought it was ridiculous. But it helped.”
The Austrian man is staring at Harry and lighting a lumos with the tip of his wand. He seems confused and out of sorts.
Harry is looking intently at the screen. It’s Friday night and he is so pleased Draco is online—he doesn’t want to miss a beat of their conversation.
They laugh and he watches Albus go back to his friend. A sudden giddiness overcomes Draco. It’s such a wonderful idea, to trace back stories and experiences of queer people over time. To give them a voice, give them a space to share with a bigger audience.
There’s a throbbing in his head and he feels queasy. But it’s too bright inside and he blinks against the light. “
warning for: Sirius being crude; past family homophobia; mentions of rimming. (but's none of these get too intense.)
Harry told Draco about how much these memories crossed his mind and hurt his soul nowadays. How having Remus in the hospital was making him remember all the awful feelings he once felt growing up and accepting HIV and homosexuality as part of their family reality. How the idea of losing Moony was bringing back these ugly parts of him that he wanted to forget.
He is smiling, though softly, and his lips are pink; they look dry. He looks a bit sad and mysterious.
Then Harry cries, staring at Draco’s photo. Because this thin, pointy man is the one who stole his heart with kind words and half-truths. This is the man he fell in love with.
“We deserve it, right?” Draco asks firmly, feeling the tears blur his vision. Because he wants to believe it, that they all deserve it. “We deserve to live and love and I hope I can live this a little longer.”
He asks himself how it would be to grow up with such an interesting support network. It makes him emotional, to think that newer generations will have a better environment than what he had, than what Sirius had, than what Mr Dumbledore had.
And Draco busies himself in stretching Harry open with great amounts of lube and greedy fingers. He is mesmerised as Harry opens up and moans and gasps and breathes deeply, asking for more and deeper.
Harry was about to say to hell with it and go back inside the room and view the damn memory for himself, or at least what he could stomach of it, when he heard a choked sob.
He really was beautiful - and not just physically, no. Damn him. Potter was way more than a pretty face. He was loyal and caring, full of generosity and kindness and
And here he was now, edging closer to three years later, the mental war within himself now waging alongside fighting a physical one, his question finally answered.
When he finished moments later with his signature on the line labeled ‘Father’, he stumbled a bit standing back up straight, handing the parchment back to the assistant. She looked down at it quickly, the wand in her hand ready to transfer the information to a very tiny blue bracelet.
Harry had very gently turned Draco's left arm over. There was no need to roll his shirtsleeve up; The Dark Mark was so prominent against the porcelain-white skin of his forearm that it showed through the soaked, nearly transparent cotton.
Harry, exhibiting an equal enthusiasm, pulled against his shoulder blades hard, forcing Draco forward. Their bodies were suddenly pressed flush against one another.
"And in case you can't tell, I quite like having a permanent reminder of you on my own skin." He said, boldly running the flat of his hand over the bulge in his trousers, a deep groan catching in his throat.
Draco quickly glanced at Harry, but instantly regretted it as a blush crept across his face. "I said that father was dead."
"Yeah, maybe," he said softly, a small smile on his lips, sure that Draco had just given him the answer to when he had fallen in love with Harry. "Maybe I've always loved you."
"I want... this. I want -" he paused, tongue nervously flicking over his lips. "Draco, I want you to suck my cock."
Ginny gaped at him as the assistant then attached the bracelet to the baby’s tiny right wrist, which had been gently pulled from the bundle. Finished with her work, she happily started out of the room, telling them “I’ll let your brother back in now!” as she left.
"So? Didn't those -" Draco stopped himself. "Didn't your, er - aunt or whomever, give you your family's ancestry book?"
"Draco. Stop." Harry demanded, sitting up to look at him. Harry wanted to scream that he hadn't been, that this had been a long time coming. He wanted to grab him and kiss him and give Draco that confession of his love - to hell with however melodramatic it may be - that he knew Draco was secretly hoping for. Harry wanted to. He did.
"That wasn't a joke and you know it." Harry gritted through his teeth. Malfoy laughed again, and Harry jabbed the tip of his wand into Malfoy's chest.
On Friday evening, the night before the final Quidditch match of the year - the very Quidditch match that just so happened to be the one that determined whether or not Gryffindor would beat Slytherin for the Cup - Harry Potter was nearly at his breaking point.
Then he licked the wet, golden skin in front of him, pressing searing, open-mouthed kisses further down while his knees slowly,
"Fuck," Harry breathed, his muscles going slack against his will, collapsing against the other man. His softening cock slipped out slightly as their position changed, and Draco bit his bottom lip as he felt Harry's come leaking from him onto his silk bedcover. "I'm s-sorry about, ah-" Harry stammered, entirely unsure if it had been okay to come inside Draco since Ginny had never, ever let him finish like that during his few experiences with her.
"I mean, I'm perfectly aware most people believe the Hallows are just a myth. I certainly don't blame you for thinking that if you do, but if you really bothered to research it there's loads of evidence throughout history suggesting otherwise. And I must say - in addition to history, I'm quite educated in pureblood lines besides my own. That wasn't
"You clearly failed my every attempt to teach you, Potter. You could never possess the amount of skill required to block the likes of the Dark Lord from your mind."
Then Harry turned around, making him stir beneath his trousers and he cursed his teenage hormones for running amok. The Quidditch showers were a very long ways away from the Headmaster's office and even the terrifying prospect of changing his allegiance couldn't completely stop his mind from wandering south.
"Fine," he managed, and he quickly began tapping his wand to things, trying to concentrate wholly on the magic at hand.
"Trust me," he repeated in a hoarse whisper as he glided closer. His cold, undead breath was only an inch away from his face, sending chills down Draco's spine.
"Draco, I -" he started, and it was the first time either Draco or Harry saw Snape lost for words. He swallowed and nodded to himself. Then he spoke very carefully.
The waitress re-appeared, clearing away the fourteen empty shot glasses with a flick of her wand and a smile toying at her candy red lips that suggested she had seen this situation a hundred times before.
"Potter," Malfoy drawled, arms crossed while he leaned against said bare wall, "Did it ever occur to you that it could just be chipped paint?"
"Harry," Draco moaned again, threatening Harry's hold on himself, a desperate sound escaping him as he felt the immense pleasure building its way through his body. "Harry," Draco gasped, his hand flying over his cock between them. "Look at me."
"Very sorry." he said, at a loss. Malfoy studied him for a moment, trying to detect any trace of malintent in Harry's condolence.
"I don't care." he said defiantly and looked at Harry, who was now looking very touched. Harry held his gaze, and Draco’s heart leapt as he thought maybe - just maybe - he might not be alone in his true feelings.
They were now both staring in silence at the small, dark room in front of them. Something inside was emitting a faint blue glow. Harry was sure he knew exactly what that glow was. Draco made to slowly step forward, but Harry grabbed his shoulder and stopped him from doing so.
Harry's eyes met Draco's, and he was instantly reminded of Snape and his similar look of longing and love and so many other unspoken things, and Harry realized with a shock that it was the same. It broke his concentration, his mind, his heart to see it so clearly before his vision suddenly blurred, whether from pleasure or the beginnings of tears he didn't know. Draco was clenching impossibly tight around his cock, his heels digging almost painfully hard into Harry's lower back, and he felt his toes curling, his legs tensing, his hips shuddering from the sheer force of it, forgetting to warn Draco that he was coming because Draco was already digging his nails into Harry's shoulders and screaming. He had let go of his cock and Harry could feel hot spurts of come splashing against his abdomen as his own cock pulsed with wave after wave of release inside Draco. He arched his back, pushing his cock as deep as Draco's body would allow, throwing his head back as he slowly rode out the last of his orgasm. Draco shook beneath him, filled with Harry's come and his lean torso slick with his own.
"Yes." Harry whispered, though his expression seemed to say otherwise. He lowered his wand so as to not jab Malfoy in the chest with it and marveled at the sight of him.
Water gently splashed against him as Harry moved through the spray to sit directly next to him on his left, Harry's thigh and knee pressed against his own. He swallowed back another sob - Harry's unprejudiced concern and kindness was too much for him.
Potter jumped so sharply his left hand slipped off the tiles with a loud squeak and he almost fell face first into the wall. A second later a wand was being pointed in his face.
Smirking, Draco gently took part of the fabric in his hands. He had tried convincing his father to buy him his own ever since he found out Potter had one, but for once Lucius wouldn't budge. He had said it was utterly foolish to waste so much money on something temporary.
Draco had been interrupted a number of times in his life while masturbating and every single time - save for idiot Blaise a few nights ago - it was by someone he found to be the absolute least desirable person imaginable. He had encountered Crabbe, his own mother and even that insane house-elf Dobby once. Every single one of those times had caused his erection to deflate faster than a punctured Quaffle.
"God," Harry whispered when he removed his lips from Draco's neck with a loud smack and saw the dark red mark he had left on the Slytherin's otherwise blemish free white skin. It drove him mad with desire to see it and his continued thrusting became erratic. Draco clutched him tighter, making desperate little sounds in-between his panting breaths that repeatedly ghosted over the shell of Harry's ear in time with their hips meeting together, and Harry was suddenly coming harder than ever beneath his robes, beneath his over-worn jeans and into his boxers. "Draco," he breathed as his orgasm subsided, his hips slowing. He heard Draco yell a second later, arching off the wall to press his cock against Harry as he came. They panted together for all but two seconds, when a faint voice seeped into the closet room through the master bedroom door.
“Yeah – well, ‘s been a crazy night,” Ron said loudly over their heads as they walked through the crowded London nightlife. “We were all doin’ rounds with Steathers, y’know, for his birthday ‘n’ all, as you do, and you’ll never guess who happened to be at the bar, ‘Mione!”
Potter getting angry never failed to turn him on. He felt his cock throb and he dared himself to inch forward again.
Draco finally looked away from him and let his head fall with his tears. Harry, whom he had spent the last six years ridiculing after a rejected offer of friendship and who was supposed to be his
He sighed sadly when his feet touched the ground again, as if it were some Portkey that had transported him back to reality.
"Suck them," he hissed. Harry did, wetting Draco's fingers with his tongue, sure that he had never been harder in his life. When Draco removed them, Harry, feeling slightly afraid, was sure he was going to use them to penetrate him. Instead, Draco reached behind himself and made a deep noise in the back of his throat.
- like a real human being - and then Harry went and slashed him open like an imbecile. The shame and guilt he felt was almost too much.
"Holy shit," he gasped. Entranced, Draco ground against him a second time. Harry's head fell back as he moaned, long and deep, head lightly thumping the tile wall. Crazed by the amount of lust consuming him, Draco bent his head down and licked the base of Harry's throat, dragging his hot tongue up to Harry's ear. He traced over the cartilage with the tip before sucking in the soft lobe.
Draco searched Snape's face for a moment, then slowly wrapped his arms around him, hiding both his face and tears into his stiff shoulder.
Now that they were no longer in separate rooms, Draco could make out the harsh panting added to the sound of the running water. He ducked back behind the wall, hands nervously smoothing his hair back, mind beginning to race.
"Leave it," Draco whispered and Harry stopped, looking at him in confusion just as Severus Snape appeared in the entrance way, his wand drawn.
"Yeah, I'm sure. He used it when he was here. Dumbledore gave it back to me at Christmas my first year."
Harry watched as Malfoy furiously slapped his hand over the spot on the wall. After a good ten minutes of Draco practically yelling various phrases in Latin at it, which would have been entirely comical to Harry had he not been so pissed off, he turned to glare at him.
“Ah! Congrats, mate!” Ron said, immediately pulling Harry into a crushing hug, making them both stumble.
his mind asked. He had finally decided his own path at long last and he wasn't going to turn away from it without a fight. Not when Harry had pleaded with him. Not now when he finally knew exactly what it felt like to hold Harry's hand and press their lips together. He would teach Harry Occlumency himself morning, noon and night if he had to.
"It isn't? So, it's just me you get off on then, is it? Have I just really been the object of your desires all these years instead of your enemy, Potter? Is that the real reason why you stalked me all of sixth year?"
“Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, could you please wait in the hall?” The Healer’s assistant politely asked them.
At some point he had released Draco's right arm, which Draco had snaked around Harry's waist, his hand tightly gripping the thick fabric of Harry's robe to pull him closer. Harry, thrusting in abandon against him, closed his mouth over the soft skin of Draco's exposed neck, eliciting another moan from him.
"Yes," he moaned. "Yes, Harry." His left hand, still wrapped around his cock, began moving rapidly again. His grip in Harry's hair tightened, pulling him down for another kiss. It was difficult to breathe through it, even more difficult to keep their lips together as Harry's cock drove into Draco's perfect arse. Harry's brows knit together in concentration as he pulled away, refusing to be the first to come a second time.
. First his mother, then his father. He would then die next, of course, only after he had suffered from watching his parents die. His mind drifted to a certain someone who had suffered a nearly identical circumstance, albeit they were fortunately too young to remember the horror of it.
"Why not?" he responded, no intention of stopping. He was pulling Harry up the single step of the platform to his bed. The seduction in his voice snaked around Harry, cutting off the circulation to his reasoning abilities.
Harry waited for his usual anger and hatred for Draco to flare, but it never came. He stood there, silent and completely naked in front of him and almost completely defenseless, as he heard Ron somewhere in the depths of his mind reminding him he could just punch Draco on the nose if he had to. Draco, obviously not getting the response he had been trying to elicit from Harry, continued.
“Yes, yes, yes,” she chanted, and the Healer’s assistant handed her a small vial that she drank immediately, sighing in relief. The Healer was saying “I’m getting you into position now, alright, Mrs. Potter?” waving her wand before she even finished speaking, and Ginny nodded as her feet were being magically supported up.
What if Vernon Dursley had been his own father? Harry thought with a sick pang in his stomach. Would he have wound up acting like Dudley? Like Draco?
About 20 or so minutes later, Draco reluctantly began to make his way back to the ground, spiraling the length of the pitch down as slowly as he could - never wanting the blissful feeling to end.
“Time for papers, I’m afraid, Dad,” said the assistant Healer, smiling. Harry cleared his throat and nodded, putting his son softly back into his wife’s arms.
"I - I didn't -" Harry was saying, his anger fading fast. He was looking terribly ashamed of himself and Malfoy couldn't resist taking another step closer.
“Ah,” Malfoy sighed, his laughter finally subsiding. “Merlin, I need a smoke,” he said, standing up and swaying back a bit, grabbing the pack he had put on the table.
“Absolutely!” Hermione said, grinning and dragging Ron, who was giving Harry and Ginny a thumbs-up, out of the room.
Draco quickly understood that meant Harry hadn't caused it, and he heard quick footsteps descending the spiral staircase.
"If the Ministry had really been diligently searching for me they would have found me here six months ago."
He pulled his mouth off Harry's nipple to look down, watching his own hand move over the long, thick length of Harry's cock in amazement. The muscles under the taut skin of Harry's flat abdomen flexing as Harry rocked his hips to meet his hand was surely one of the most erotic sights he had ever seen. The action of it was almost no different than stroking his own, but it felt infinitely better than anything he had ever tried with girls. There was no guessing here, no need for exceedingly gentle, unsure fingers. He started twisting his fist as he came up, slightly increasing the pressure, knowing just how much he loved that sensation himself.
“Sure, love,” Malfoy said, draping an arm around her shoulders, her face pressing into his chest slightly, and Harry looked at Malfoy’s silver wedding band again before drunkenly looking down at his own gold one.
"One minute you're throwing your Auror status in my face and threatening to detain me, and the next you're apologizing. You're a basket case, Potter." Harry internally agreed with him but rushed to defend himself.
“Hey,” he whispered. He was holding him very carefully, still leaning into the bed very close to Ginny, not trusting his whiskey-laden motor skills enough to walk around the room safely with his newborn in his arms. “Welcome to the world, little guy.”
she said happily, and Harry couldn’t stop the hot tears that began to run down his face as he looked back into his mother’s green eyes.
His lips continued to meet his own hand repeatedly until he removed it, wanting to find out if he could
"Well, by all means then, Auror Potter." He opened the door in a grand fashion and extended his arm out towards the entrance hall. Harry stepped in, not turning his back to Malfoy. This was not the plan. This was not supposed to be happening. The assignment had only been issued to them, as they were brand new Aurors, because the Manor was almost guaranteed to be empty. Almost.
"And you… you don't understand why it's strange that Dumbledore had your Cloak… considering his history with Grindelwald?"
"Listen," Harry said, holding back another laugh at Draco’s expression. "If I start telling you about the Dursleys, you'll never change your mind about muggles."
Draco looked away as he broke into an answering smile, something he knew was extremely rare for himself.
"Who was he?" Harry asked softly, looking up again when Draco did not respond immediately. This short moment of impassive silence made Harry realize Draco only became unreadable when confronted with anything that warranted emotions beyond malice and conceit. He didn't know why he had never realized that before. That Malfoy was merely acting the way he had been told to act. That Malfoy's ideologies and idiosyncrasies belonged to that of his father, expected to be dutifully carried on by his only son. Harry didn't realize until that moment just how awful having Lucius Malfoy for a father could have been.
Draco remembered The Baron saying the same what now felt like eons ago. He realized he would no longer have to fix that stupid Cabinet. More importantly, he no longer had to devise ways to murder another human being. He felt like an enormous weight had been lifted from him.
Or was he just a coward - a coward that was forever doomed to hide behind a facade made up of pure blood and wealth - not brave enough to have been placed in Gryffindor?
"Do you really want me to?" Draco asked, stepping into the stream. The hot water hit his platinum blonde hair, turning it a very pale gold as it fell heavy around his head, clinging to his ears and neck. His white shirt became nearly transparent, sticking to him like a second skin and his trousers were becoming weighted, drifting slightly from his hips due to the amount of water they were absorbing.
“I do not,” he said, staring at Harry and Harry’s eyes went wide. “I may have used to, but not anymore.” He ran a hand over his hair again, nose in the air, looking just as arrogant as ever.
Draco whipped around, wand-arm flailing, immediately firing off a hex in the direction of the unknown intruder's voice. The hex hit a large stack of mismatched furniture, sending it crashing to the ground and Draco's eyes finally focused on who had spoken.
"It's okay," Draco said, his voice still breathless and somewhat hoarse. Wincing, he lowered his legs to the bed and caused Harry's cock to slip out completely. Draco's words soothed Harry's concern and thoughts began flooding back to his mind while his sated body relaxed.
"Perhaps," said Malfoy with a small shrug, his eyebrow quirking. Harry looked as if Draco had just slapped him.
Malfoy, girl still attached to his side, moved along the crowd, brushing against the brick wall to an empty corner, discarded beer bottles and other bits of rubbish amidst a sea of cigarette butts on the ground around them. Taking his arm off her, he pulled three cigarettes from the pack, putting one in the corner of his mouth and handing the other two to the girl and Harry in silence. Malfoy then pulled a muggle –
Age 5: Skull Fracture, broken lower vertebrae, Anal Tearing, five broken ribs, Malnutrition, Dehydrated, Obliviate
“Harry! Was that necessary? We just wanted the best for you.” Hermione said looking shocked about what had just happened. “If it wasn’t necessary, I wouldn’t have done it, be thankful Lady Magic was lenient with you and Ron.” Harry said looking bored but in side was relieved. “You’ve ruined me! I will do everything in my power to destroy you.” Dumbledore yelled looking like a child having a tantrum. “Really, you’ve already lost most of your power Headmaster. Do you really want to lose the rest?” Harry asked looking really bored now. “I advise you to start proving you can change your ways, so you can possibly have a chance in getting back in Lady Magics good graces.” Harry said before taking Draco’s hand and walking towards the Great Hall doors. Not seeing, Lady Fate watching the whole scene agreeing with what the young elf had said and hoping she could help Dumbledore be the good wizard she had seen him become.
And the signs are all there again. Draco is already disengaging, walking out of the room, putting on some rather loud music with a sharp flick of his wand and disappearing to his own personal headspace.
And, weird as life has been, Theodore actually pulls him into a hug and tells him, very honestly, that it was his pleasure.
Sirius holds his hands in return, accepting the hard grip and breathing through his nose. Harry tries to match his breathing so he won’t hyperventilate.
It’s a sight to behold, the sunlight kissing Harry’s caramel skin like honey. Draco touches him, fingers drawing the curve of his spine, creating goosebumps as he traces skin and vertebrae. Draco kisses the small of Harry’s back softly, hands coming up to cup firmly on arsecheeks, kneading flesh and muscle.
He arrives home a bit earlier, looking forward to a long shower, a cuppa and maybe convincing Draco into getting take away from the Thai restaurant down the street and watching something stupid in the telly.
He doesn't know if Harry is hung like a horse. He doesn’t think he is; well, at least it didn’t feel this big when Draco rubbed him a bit over the jeans last night.
“Do you want to try something new?” Draco asks breathless, pulling Harry’s t-shirt over his head, breaking the kiss.
Then Sirius’ dad died, and to everyone’s surprise, left him a third of his fortune, so Sirius stopped working at the motorbike shop and they bought the bookstore from old Mr Binns who wanted to go back to Aberdeen with his grandchildren.
“You are definitely not fine, Harry James,” Sirius states, his voice ringing in the quiet kitchen, sounding angry. “What happened?” he presses again.
Remus takes a moment, his jaw working, eyes fixed on the ground in the middle of the circle and Draco hears in his silence the understanding of their shared agony.
“I was afraid of opening my eyes,” Harry says and Draco turns around in the bed to look at him, at his bright green eyes, still sleepy and blinking slowly against the cold light that enters the room.
Outside, it’s fairly cold and there is Padfoot: arms crossed tight over his chest with a fierce expression. But before Remus and Draco can say anything, the man walks straight up to them and smiles brightly and grandly at Draco, putting his hands on both Draco’s shoulders.
“Hello, Mr. Potter, nice meeting you,” greets the man from the other side of the floo with a thick Russian accent. He looks sharp, in smart clothing and dark hair slicked back, a charming smile on his lips.
It takes a while for the reply to come back, so he grabs the roll of toilet paper by his bedside and goes back to his chair.
“Yes, it was,” he concedes. He wants her to get to the point so he can leave. “Is this about my mother?”
He goes back to the party. He will let Draco know that he cannot deal with bringing someone home tonight. He hopes they will still be able to enjoy the rest of the celebration with their friends.
“I’m in love with you, Draco,” he whispers back and Draco gasps, gasps, gasps. Eyes shocked and mouth open and they're breathing the same air, hot and damp and so close he can almost taste her.
The strong pull of affection and hope blossoms like springtime in Harry’s chest. Inside his body, there are waves crashing and winds blowing and rainforest storming.
He wishes it was all a film. He could press play, pause, stop. Turn off the dvd and start it back up the next day, or next month, or next year. After a bit of time off to let this abhorrent feeling of complete uselessness go away.
“That was very honest,” Rolf says. His eyes are a bit wet as he looks warmly at Draco, and now Draco can see that many others are nodding or drying their eyes or blowing their noses. “Would anyone like to share their feelings about it?” He looks around.
Moony puts three steaming mugs of tea on top of the table and steps closer to Harry, running his hand in big calming circles over his back. Harry trembles and shivers and takes deep, shaky breaths. Padfoot only nods at him, holding his hands and eyes with a serious expression.
The comfort bit finally arrives to this blasted story. Y'all. I'm so glad I'm weeping ;_;  love, tai :3
“Look, when Draco told me you guys were opening your marriage, I didn’t get it. You don’t seem the sort. I sensed trouble...” She regards him for a second. “I had a hard time too, Potter. Not because I didn’t enjoy my bit of exploration and adventure, but because I’m really not very good at sharing. I’m jealous, I’m petty, and I was raised to be a decent housewife, which is the opposite of how it felt in the beginning.”
He needs to get his head sorted and find a solution. Or at least decide about some of Draco’s ideas, like inviting other men into their bed.
And now he is downright sobbing and crying. He can’t say anything anymore. His body aches, and his chest is on fire. And he’s starting to panic, because now that he came clean, now, well, now Draco will leave him.
He excuses himself, feeling a bit off. Lately, everything related to sex has been a bit uncomfortable between them.
He barks out a loud laugh, throwing his head back, shoulders shaking with the incredulity of how destiny makes intricate knots while knitting lifetimes.
“Let’s go home now. I’ll tell you everything about my grand gay life!” Sirius beams. “I told Harry I would bring him a surprise,” he informs them. He disentangles from Draco and kisses Remus hotly on the mouth. “Hey, beauty,” Sirius winks theatrically at Remus, who laughs.
“Yeah, I’ve been writing quite a lot lately, so I sent some of my things to one of the publishing houses and they invited me.”
“I hate you,” Harry mutters, closing his eyes. “I’m so glad I gave in and am going to this new club with my friends tonight. I’ll get so shitfaced I’ll forget all about this bit of information.” He takes a deep calming breath. “I’ve just decided, I’m not moving back after all. I’ll go to my room and pack my poster of Brian Kinney and LEAVE!”
Harry distantly heard the announcements and did the post-game handshake. Then, as he stepped into the locker room, the ground tilted, and he heard Oliver distantly call "Harry!", then nothing.
Harry stepped back into Grimmauld and was sprayed in the face with petals in the foyer. His mouth had been open, so he caught the full brunt of the floral scent in his nose and mouth at the same time and sputtered while trying to clear his vision of white.
"I went through a period of hating everything that reminded me of my parents. Now, it's that I don't have access to a piano," Draco said. He ran a finger along the shiny lettering lovingly.
Harry lifts his head, but his gaze is glazed, distant. It makes an icy shiver run down Draco’s spine.
I tried not to feel guilty about relying so much on her like that, taking comfort in the fact that I was as good a friend as she was for me and that what we had was mutual.
The music is louder, almost deafening. The time to go is getting so close, Draco can barely keep his eyes open. His words are flowing in a sea of clouds. He closes his eyes, presses his nose against Harry’s neck.
Draco reads everything that comes out about Harry's sudden recovery: newspapers, magazines, even occasional letters from fans of their relationship, or the hateful howlers. The latter are turning up in increasingly frequent intervals, though Draco’s doing a superb job in ignoring them now.
"Happy birthday, Astoria," Harry said. She wore shiny silver robes and silver boots. He wasn’t sure where he stood with her, but she swept him into a brief embrace as if they were also friends.
Though this Harry has never done this, his body remembers how to render Draco an incoherent mess. When Harry’s fingers find his most sensitive spot, Draco’s vision blanks. “Oh, God, stop. Stop,” he wails, nails digging into the skin of Harry’s arms.
Haughtiness would have had him ranting not long ago. Draco is not here to be good to anyone else, only himself, he might have said. But before it settles under his skin, Draco’s wondering,
"Is that meant to be me? I don’t sound like that. That’s awful. Come here. I’ll show you accommodating," Draco said. And what had seemed momentous was the inevitable conclusion of Draco coming here, to this house, to them meeting and knowing each other at all. They were always going to be like this.
Elle has followed his and Harry’s story from the beginning, and although she barely ever comments on his personal life—even though it is plastered all over the paper, thanks to his husband and the whole Saviour of the Wizarding World thing—he can’t help the smile tugging at his lips at her faint display of affection.
"Race to the Floo?" Teddy asked. Even though he was tired, Harry put on a burst of speed. They both narrowly avoided crashing into a poor staff member rounding a corner. Harry and Teddy both yelled "Sorry!" but kept running.
Draco receives all of what Harry gives him, keeping it carefully tucked in a corner of his heart, safe and hidden away.
"I think your head is big enough, thanks." Draco was always relaxed after sex. In his head, but in a good way.
He moves on to his bedroom, the one he insists on using despite it reminding him so much of the man who doesn’t want him.
Harry stumbles out of him, body falling flat on the bed and a cheeky smile  on his lips. He turns to Draco, hand hovering over Draco’s waist, but not coming in contact.
Draco Summons a pen and writes on the back of the paper, fingers trembling and heart threatening to escape its enclosed cage.
The team’s support staff came out to watch. At one point, Pansy leaned against the stands and spoke as her staff scrawled her observations down. The trainers and Coach stood in the box and discussed a few things, but Harry wasn’t called over. Only Milo was, who spent a lot of time miming hitting a Bludger in slow motion for them for some reason.
"I love that. Tell me about it. Are there teams, or are they pickup matches?" Harry asked. Padma’s smile was bright. Harry was great with star-struck Quidditch fans of a certain age. It was almost like they were encountering their first crush. He listened intently to the difficulty of getting pitch rentals and the long-standing rivalries, and left him with a promise to send tickets for his team and family.
"It does not. There’s very little left to do now and certainly not enough to justify being here every single weekday. I have other houses to move on to," Draco said. "I told you, the Ministry wants me to start looking at the abandoned houses up north."
He doesn’t bat her hands away. He doesn't want to disturb the peacefulness that has crept inside him. He hums contently at how the leaves chant and sway distantly, the ancient magic rippling through the trees of the Forbidden Forest as if it knows him and what he’s done.
“You said he lived in Malfoy Manor during sixth year, right? And that the longer he stayed, the duller the house felt?" Granger rushes to open one book, flipping the pages rapidly. “According to this, only those who live on the family’s ground can access the magic of a Tree of Life. It had been feeding on your family’s magic for generations. Your tree stored a substantial amount of energy within. Voldemort could channel it if he wanted, as he started living there.” Draco shivered at the memory, and Granger didn’t seem to notice, proceeding without a pause to breathe. “But it’d be limited. Borrowed. I believe he went into the manor
how I process things,” he pleads. “I need to do something. I can’t just… Please. I’m the best, you know that. Let me come back to work.”
He was becoming too well known for steep dives and corkscrews, and, even if it kept working, he needed something else. Last season, the League had mused about adding a penalty for skimming the grass to discourage copycats and injuries. Coach was annoyed but Harry was just glad the League was finally paying any attention to player safety.
isn’t true, despite her wishful thinking, but it makes Harry laugh, too. Some of Harry’s tension ebbs away, and Draco bumps their shoulders softly. Maybe that friendship is something Harry can have back from his old life.
Though he’s afraid this is still a nightmare, he gropes around on the bed until his fingers take a hold of the warm figure by his side.
PRTDN had taken the appearance of a burlesque club now. While a woman in feathered costume sang on the stage, people curled in on themselves upon the many red velvet couches.
The large red sign of Spillers greeted Harry, and he spent the next few hours picking through for what Sirius wanted. He let himself contemplate whether Sirius had liked Oasis, wondering about Sirius’ infatuation with American Jazz and meditating on the story behind the signed LPs and when he’d found the time to go to gigs.
Now that Draco had resolved some key issues with the house, and they had a formal work plan, Harry figured the rest should be a piece of cake.
mount--as the newborn colt found its wings and learned to fly. They grew together, both becoming taller and stronger, each praised and celebrated for their good breeding and superior talent.
Binding their souls should serve as a beacon, guiding Draco towards Harry’s, making it easier to find him here. The spell was supposed to be straightforward. There should be no surprise in finding Harry again, that’s what Draco had intended all along.
It’d been months before I’d left the flat after the whole post-war memorial business and the auror fiasco. Then another one or two before I started meeting other people — strangers on the street, essentially. That was when Luna and I found each other again. Somehow, between those weeks and me freaking out, she moved in. More two months in, and I was equipped to go to a party, hanging by a thread.
, Draco feels so high he is soaring and it feels like tendrils of pleasure are spiking up all over his body. Draco moans and licks at Harry’s neck, then the sides of his open, wet mouth, rolling his hips up, meeting Harry’s downward movements, while pumping his slick hand over and over on Harry’s dick, corkscrewing the head of his cock and making Harry pant and cry out his name again.
The snow is falling heavily outside when they wake up, groggy and sluggish, slow with the warmth underneath the blankets and duvet. Draco luxuriates in stretching his long lean body and Harry moves like a needy puppy, touching him, nuzzling him and kissing his back sweetly.
Harry just wants to get lost in the beat, in the heat of stranger’s bodies bumping into him as they dance. He wants to stop overthinking. He wants to stop feeling this much.
“He was ashamed of his looks, so—” Harry sobs, eyes closed but he keeps going “—he sent me pictures of his fucking friend and not himself.”
Writing this fic was a big accomplishment to me, as I haven't finished long stories since 2012. I have 2 abandoned WIPs on my ffnet, they always stare back at me, making me feel like I'm an unfit author. But here we are, with 25 chapters of Dragons Don’t Know Paradise, complete. I cried a bit when I finished writing, it was really hard to let them go.
Harry assures himself that Draco is there, that Draco is made of skin and bones and that he has him under his hands.
Draco grins and winks at him. He has been supervising the installation of said exhibition the whole day.
Harry would always take a moment, before disrupting the quiet surrounding Draco, just to watch him. He was deeply in love and he felt at home. Even when they fought and said hurtful things, seeing Draco perched on the countertop was like staring at a favourite painting.
“But I don’t want to hurt him or make his life miserable...” he says, looking around and trying to see Remus' reaction.
He takes his feet from Sirius’s lap and informs him he is going to be in his room. He reassures his godfather that,
Draco holds Harry’s limp body against himself, panting, in a tangled mess of sweat and semen and saliva. His hand is on Harry’s chest, feeling the fast beat of his heart against his palm. He breathes in against Harry’s sweaty temple, feeling insanely alive, insanely bold, insanely young, insanely brave and he says:
“You know what, Harry?” Remus looks at him while Harry makes a point to look at the traffic lights. “I think I will pull a Padfoot here. He is not completely wrong.”
When Harry wakes, it’s already late in the afternoon. Sirius is in the living room watching the telly and Remus is at the bookshop with Luna for the children’s arts and crafts activities.
“The fucking will need to wait, Harry. The doctor ordered Remus ‘absolute rest’, remember?” He waggles his eyebrows provocatively.
It had been years since Remus had looked that bad. His health has always been controlled, taking his meds and following a balanced diet, doing exercises, keeping exams up to date.
They are close to the balcony laughing at each other like idiots. Harry sees red. The laughter is high and there is a loud ringing noise in his ears. Draco is doubled over his stomach with a hand on the guy’s biceps.
he moves his hips back, taking Draco further in, until there’s no more to take. “It burns so good, Draco,” he hisses and shakes under Draco’s hands and around his cock. “It feels
It was obviously fun at some moments, but then Draco would want more, and in this case Mr. Irishman wanted it too. He felt defeated.
Draco feels a sudden realisation. He has been so scared, so afraid of Harry not wanting him, or that it wouldn’t work out between them, that he didn’t realise Harry had the same fears. He hasn’t seen the naked vulnerability behind all the softness and reassured touches and whispers Harry offered him.
Draco’s body is electrified with excited energy. He can’t remember the last time he felt so good. It’s surreal—having Harry in his life is changing everything. Harry is soft and tender and cheesy, and Draco’s heart feels like it's going to explode in big waves of tenderness.
He sounds childish to his own ears. He hates it. He hates the way his own voice rings in the kitchen and the way Draco is looking at him from the other side of the table, as if he were a little boy. Sharp eyes and a probable scold on the tip of his posh quick tongue.
“You sound very excited,” Harry laughs, watching Draco take a swig straight from the bottle. “Oh gods, you’re even overlooking your manners!”
“Yeah, I heard about that.” Remus smiles brightly and knowingly. “We just didn’t know then that you were
But she shushes him, waving a hand dismissively, before lighting a cigarette with a quick snap of her fingers. The smell of smoke is not helping.
They cackle like teenagers, as if happiness is something contagious and the fact that Draco is happy makes them happy as well.
“Thank you for meeting with me, I know it was a surprise.” Her posh accent makes him shiver with memories of times that Sirius doesn’t want to be reminded of.
Thank you SO MUCH to everyone who commented! really, it means the world to me. To be sharing this story with you all... the feedback counter-backs the anxiety of posting and writing at the same time. English is not my first language, so writing this multi-chapters story in a foreign language to a wider public, a drarry fic, it's a big step for me. And all your comments make me believe that I can do this. If, at any point, this story triggers you or moves you, please feel free to talk to me, here, or at tumblr or at the drarry discord. I'm here to hear and share. After all, we grow together in sharedness. We are not alone, dears. I hope you are enjoying the ride, folks. Be safe, my darlings, have some tea and a great Saturday. <3
“Concerning your worries about condoms breaking,” Remus laughs, shaking his head, and Draco feels his face flush, all embarrassed and small and fucking young and exposed. “Don’t worry too much, condoms don’t break that easily. I should know,” he adds, laughing at Draco’s flushed face.
It’s starting to make him feel even worse about sex- about himself, and how inadequate it feels to be less sexual than his husband.
He’s sitting on top of a high branch on a tall tree. Harry doesn’t remember why he ended up there, but it’s summer and the heat is suffocating and Ron or Ginny dared him. So here he is, while everyone else is on the ground over the picnic blanket by the thin stream close to the Burrow.
Everyone listens to him, rapt. Gay love stories from the ‘70s tend to be sad—they tend to end in death and heartbreak.
He is delighted to see his friend being so supportive. She is quietly talking to Rolf by the food table and the way Rolf is smiling at her, honest and open, makes him question a few things—he will need to ask Pansy about that, about the way the man slid one solid finger very gently over the side of her thigh, over the bruises Draco knows are lying underneath her woollen trousers.
He steps outside in a hurry—he doesn’t want to talk to anyone. He feels too vulnerable, raw, naked and cut open for handshakes and small talk.
“What happened?” Harry asks, and he feels terrible, because he spent the whole day doing nothing and thinking of her and avoiding her and feeling sorry for himself and his life, just like he has been doing since the war. Since he couldn’t manage more violence and his Auror dreams went to hell, since he stood on that bridge, thinking of dying this time for real, but instead found Draco there, thinking of dying too, and they stared at the dark dark dark sky, and the space bodies and then stared into each others eyes and muttered secrets and truths like it was the last thing they would do in life. And Harry wanted the pain to be over, but when Draco said “She, she, she,” Harry decided he wanted to stay and watch. To stay and see. To be mesmerised by Draco and her life and her changes and her light and her life, life,
He scribbles it in the notebook; then he puts down pen and paper, lets out a shaky breath and lies down, closing his eyes. Allows his mind to quiet down.
“I’m sorry you ended up hearing my concerns about Harry dating you. I didn’t realise it was you,” Remus says in a tender tone.
He is alone in bed, but the bedroom door is open and the delicious fragrant smell of fresh coffee comes from downstairs.
“Look, I haven’t been feeling very sexual. We both know that. I know you are bored of our sex life an-”
We all know that back in 2004, transitioning for trans folk was not something easy to achieve (we’re in bloody 2020, and it is still insanely hard to get hormones and surgery), BUT I’m using a bit of poetic license here and this chapter contains one (1) really fit trans counsellor, who—god bless him—got his top surgery and hormones alright in our imaginary 2004. This character was inspired by my best friend Will, an amazing man that has a huge heart and a beautiful way with words. He’s a massive blessing in my life! I can only drool so much at his gorgeous writer-psychologist vibe and style, his arms, his legs, his hands, his smile, his eyes, his beard, his voice, his whole amazing being!! As you can see, my dear readers, this author has one (1) strong crush. Will you marry me, William? <3
the real reason Harry is moving back for good,” Sirius says smartly. “Because I am wonderful and he cannot live without me!”
After a few silent minutes, Draco takes him in his arms and holds him for a while. Clutching to each other, scared and devastated. Draco kisses the top of his head and hugs Harry while both of them cry, until their sobs quieten and their breathing stabilizes again.
“Now,” she extinguishes her cigarette and it disappears in thin air in a pop of smoke, “you can choose when you are into it and when you are not. And if tonight is not the right moment for you, that’s a no. And if he presses, then there’s a talk you will need to have.” She pauses, considering. “You can go out there and snatch him with your gorgeous green eyes and strong arms and all your weird hero charm, and spend a nice night with your husband and friends. You can decide to engage in talking to the Austrian hottie and see how it goes. You can tell Draco you guys better go back home because you’re not feeling well. But you need to communicate, Potter. Otherwise it doesn’t work.”
“He was crying and saying he didn’t want me to die.” He shakes his head, presses his hands against his knees. “Back then, it was bloody scary. We thought it was a death sentence. And he kept repeating it:
“Harry, Padfoot here is a sore loser, he just wants to hear you say how much you love him and miss him and can’t live without him,” Moony laughs, sticking a tongue at Sirius.
. He had his fair bit of exploration in the first few years after the war. He had different partners and tried different things.
“If you don’t want to do that, you should be very honest with him. Just explain you can’t deal with it. And talk.”
He becomes used to it. Harry surrenders to the emotions and feelings and the inevitability of it. He starts to enjoy the way his body lights up when Draco is around, how his eyes chase him in the room, how his breath speeds up a bit every time their gaze holds or when they exchange words.
“And, Potter,” she gets closer, and works her fingers over his hair trying to put it back in place. She is a bit stiff, but there’s care, and he appreciates it before she steps back. “You are gorgeous, and you’re bloody nice, though it pains me to admit it. He’s lucky to have you.” She smiles kindly at him. “If all goes bad, fear not, oh chosen one,” there’s a bit of sarcasm and he smiles at her, shaking his head. “You might not believe it, but you are a very lovable man.”
A shaky laugh escapes Harry’s mouth, and he is already giving into the desire he isn’t sure will visit again anytime soon. He turns in Draco’s arms and instinct kicks in. Grabbing Draco by the hair, crashing their mouths together, tasting his own sweat on Draco’s tongue, hips pushing and teasing in tandem. He trails a wet hand to Draco’s arse over thick fabric and moves him even closer, making him moan against his lips, fingers messing Harry’s hair, thrusting against each other in a delicious mess of sweat and saliva and heat.
With high cheekbones, sharper than Blaise’s, but thinner lips. He’s very pale, and the deep green from the trees and grass around him in the picture, makes him even paler. His hair is pale blond, long enough to touch his jaw. His chin is actually very pointy.
“And I thought I would be the one giving you a nice surprise by introducing you to Draco,” Remus says, shaking his head and touching Draco’s shoulder. “You always steal the scene, Padfoot.”
“Yeah...” Harry murmurs, not wanting to worry Sirius or talk too much and let the strange sensation in his voice show.
Draco feels his body turn soft in the chair. With relief. With the gentle, warm feeling that somehow, someway, this complete stranger with soft hazel eyes has a love story still going on for him.
It was the only thing that kept him sane, while Sirius paced around the house, desperate and anxious, like a living ghost, haunted. It had been one of the most difficult periods of his life.
Draco realises that Remus’s son is Harry, and the HIV-positive person his son is dating is Draco himself.
So they move, chasing the feeling and the desire, thrusting and holding and gasping. Draco’s hand manoeuvres Harry up, bringing him to a sitting position, hands on the headboard and head falling back against Draco’s shoulder, his sweaty back against Draco’s chest, moaning as Draco’s cock goes deeper inside him.
“You’re going to do just fine,” Sirius says, feeling warmth for her, overwhelming tenderness. “You are already doing it perfectly, actually, though it pains me to admit it. Asking for help is a good first step.”
Ginny keeps jumping in and out of the water and splashing rivulets of cold stream water on everyone. He watches them, enchanted by the opportunity of getting a glimpse. As always, it takes him by surprise, the delicacy of a normal life. A life in peace and not war. A life full of a certain kind of freedom and quietness.
Also, some good news for those who feel curious about Sirius x Remus story: I'm definitely going to write about them after Dragons is finished, I have a fic title and all, so that's that! :)
The push and pull inside Harry’s chest. The constant extreme movement of his beating heart, oh so loud, every time his eyes and Draco’s held. It was magical—a magical struggle to avoid it, and another magical struggle to accept it.
It shouldn’t feel like this to watch Malfoy exercise his profession on paediatric healing. It shouldn’t warm Harry all over just like a high fever to see how his long pale fingers caress Teddy’s bluish hair and smiles at him, talking softly and putting him to bed, before going down to have a word with Andromeda.
And after the first words, he realises there are many other words that need to come out. They talk for hours, they walk back to his flat and talk and talk, while Theo cooks some bad pasta carbonara and they eat in front of the telly. He tells Theo everything, about his fears, his loneliness, his anger. He tells him about Harry and about his hollowing sadness and how he misses his previous life.
He doesn't want to do it anymore, but he wants to at least please Draco. He doesn't want to deal with whatever reaction could come from stopping now. The disappointment and frustration that will flash in cold grey eyes. The conversation that is now long overdue.
It’s so incredibly hopeful to see how these two men are so utterly in love with each other even after all these years.
I'm soaring. Got so drunk on prosecco after I finished writing lol. I hope you guys enjoyed this story!
“Are you looking forward to going out with your friends tonight?” Remus asks while they are in the car.
Once their lips part to take long distressed breaths, Harry laughs and watches the smile on Draco’s mouth.She looks sheepish and coy and bites her lip and Harry kisses her again, and again and again for good measure, feeling the temperature escalating between them.
Harry found comfort in a website that supports family and friends of people with HIV and AIDS. It was in one of these online forums that he ran into Draco in the LGBT chat group. From one message to the next, they were telling about their lives and exchanging experiences, talking through the chat every single day.
He stands up, excusing himself and walking towards the bathroom. His breath is catching in the back of his throat and his eyes are starting to sting.
“I feel like I will never be able to fuck again. I’ll be too concerned and scared and cornered, and what if I transmit it?” He shakes his head. “But it’s not just that, you know. I miss it, I crave it, the feeling of being desired, the debauchery, the game, to go with a man to a dark alley and just have a go at it. Dirty and messy and nasty and—”
But he doesn’t feel like messaging back right now. He’s in the middle of a thought, and the thought feels impossibly large, like being on the verge of something else, something beautiful, something huge. Maybe he will get to write it down...
The Austrian guy is as enticed as Harry, as he can see, staring at Draco’s mouth, eyes flicking with the hand movements, tongue licking lips in a quick motion. All indicative of how alluring and interesting he’s finding Draco Malfoy.
Draco is now everywhere. Because Ron and Pansy are engaged and she is pregnant, and what used to be a once a week encounter, is turning into a nearly constant presence.
next chapter is still under revision. not sure if I'll be able to post tomorrow but I'm hoping I can make iittttt! <3 Hope you all enjoyed this chap as Harry finally gets to read Draco's email. ^^ we getting closer! :3 I would love to hear your thoughts!
Draco turns, looking like a painting under the sunlight, with his hair forming a golden halo around his head, his eyes dancing with joy and a bright smile on his pink lips.
“I wanted to tell you something about the reading night, but you left right after you finished,” Albus says and smiles knowingly.
“It helped because I got to talk to someone, knowing they didn’t think I was stupid. And, you see, nowadays, if I think back, the stupid thing was to think you guys would think badly of me for struggling.”
He can still remember when he first moved in with his godparents after the red tape with the Dursleys worked out and at 5 years old, Harry finally got to live with his parents’ chosen guardians after the car crash. No cupboard anymore—he had a playroom and his own bedroom and he would spend the afternoons with Moony in the bookshop while Sirius worked 10 hours a day in the motorbike shop so they could keep up at the end of the month.
He needs a moment to calm his body, feeling overwhelmed with Harry’s tight hold around his cock, and he peppers kisses on Harry’s shoulder blades and his sweaty neck and caresses his sides, before moving.
Harry’s breath hitches and he chokes stupidly on his own spit while coughing and clicking in the photo attached to the email.
Harry feels like a déjà vu, a flashback. He is sitting at the table nursing an already cold cup of tea when Sirius flicks the light on.
He tried though, not only avoiding it but—before that—pretending he didn’t feel it. Even though it had been nagging inside his rib cage like an agonising beast, huge like a whole unknown continent inside him.
He spills over his hand in delicious waves of pleasure and tension and this is so bloody hot. He just messed up his pyjamas, but fuck it. He takes a deep breath and starts typing with the hand that is not full of his own come.
They fucked for hours, or at least it felt like hours. Harry was pretty spent when they started it all over again. The sheer appreciation in Draco’s eyes once Oisin, or Eoin, or Eammon started sucking his dick back to life once again.
“I was madly in love with him, see, but I was not bold enough to tell him that. And there he was, crying like a ridiculous baby as if it was his life at stake, and I hated him. God, I hated him so much. I wanted to punch him right in the face and say:
He gets into bed and kisses Draco softly. Something turns inside his chest, something observing from a different perspective as Draco hugs him under the blankets with so much familiarity. It pains him how Draco drops a kiss exactly over Harry’s scar, over his heart.
“Harry...” the way he said his name sounded as if Harry was a small kid, there was pity and concern and Harry just hated it. “You know it changes nothing, right? It’s just a spot of fun, that’s all.” He went on.
At the Wednesday pub night with friends, and Friday dinners at Luna’s cottage, and Saturday’s tea with Teddy and Andromeda, and Sunday lunches at the Burrow. And Harry has not enough willpower to make his feelings stop.
“Oh, no.” With her thin lips, she looks conflicted. Her tailored light blue suit match her earrings, and her manicured hands take the tea cup with care. Swift moves, as they were thought once upon a time, in a lifetime Sirius feels so detached from.
And it spiraled into his known self-loathing: Draco would leave him for someone more sexual, Draco wouldn’t even miss him. Harry would be lonely, all his dreams of family and coziness would be shattered. It would take years for Harry to put his pieces back together and get over Draco. By then he would be much older, and it would be a pain in the fucking arse to find someone else that would love him just the way he was and not because he was Harry fucking Potter.
A lock of blond hair falls over Draco’s eyes and he pushes it back behind his ear, his long elegant fingers touching the delicate skin under his earlobe. Gold band shining on his ring finger.
And after three fingers in, Draco rolls the condom on his hard, leaking cock and lines up, body moving forward to cover Harry's, his swollen lips against the nape of Harry’s neck, hotly, whispering sweet nonsense mixed with perverted fantasy. And slowly, he pushes in.
He moves around the room at a lethargic pace and waits and waits for sleep to pull him in. No luck though. So he pulls a notebook from a drawer and starts writing bits and pieces of broken sentences. He can’t even write properly lately.
“So boring, Auror Potter,” Draco restots, rolling his hips anyways, playfully. It pushes all the wrong buttons and Harry feels himself deflating. “You could tie me to the bed and spank me...”
He takes a long breath, fingers pinching the bridge of his nose, glasses sitting askew against his forehead.
She stares at him for a long moment, silent, eyes intent. And then, slowly, a warm, relieved smile forms on her lips. Her eyes start shining, this time with mirth.
The overwhelming feeling of regret and guilt took over and he felt his eyes sting and his face warm up. It was his fault because he had no idea of how to put boundaries on their relationship. His fault for choosing poorly. It was his fault for trying to give Draco something he wasn’t able to.
“I still find this generation very strange. How do you fall in love with someone you don't even know?”
Remus keeps talking rushedly and Sirius is talking too, and Harry just wants it to stop hurting so much.
“I love you, Pads,” he says in a hurry. He needs the words out there in the open, while Sirius is still here to listen.
Narcissa sounds utterly young and joyful. It’s nice to see her like this. Sirius understands. She probably hasn’t talked about any of this with anyone else. She is lonely.
The silence is no longer uncomfortable. It feels like it creates a tiny delicate bridge between them, a sliver of a possibility of reconnection.
He tried to list in his head: Draco loves me, Draco comes back home to me, Draco is my family, we have plans together, we have friends and support.
“It’s scary,” Draco admits. “I dunno if I’ll be able to enjoy sex while I’m thinking the condom will break.”
Sirius headily makes him a fry-up for brunch and sits with him, sipping his tea. He’s careful today, not saying much. Actually, not saying anything at all, just watching his godson with concerned eyes.
“I know, Pads...” There’s a sad smile on Harry’s lips. “Thank God everything went well...” he sighs, squeezing his godfather's fingers tightly.
“Change of plans,” he mutters, his brain sorting fast for a way out, walking Draco backwards to the kitchen table, pushing him against it, undoing his trousers, dragging his underwear down his thighs and sucking on his neck.
The dark circles under Sirius' eyes are also purplish, but his light grey eyes were so alive ... Harry smiles, basking in the feeling and the fact of how alive those eyes are and lets go of his godfather's hand to wipe the corner of his own eyes.
about his health. “I’ve been with Remus for twenty-six years now, and I’ve never got a positive test in my life. Your son will need guidance and support.
Harry takes a long breath and heads to the kitchen to take something for the headache and puts the kettle on.
It’s his mimicking Harry in a baby voice that gets a rise out of Harry and he throws a cushion at his godfather’s face, but Remus catches the cushion midair before it crashes against Sirius and his plate of cake.
Draco nodded, lowering his hands. Six years... it had to be one hell of a strong Disillusionment charm, even though it didn't explain the weightlessness of the fabric.
"I - I'm sorry," he whispered back, unable to shake the image in his mind. He had gone mad, he decided. Here he was, in a gigantic closet, with a wanted ex-Death Eater who was finally showing him a little bit of heart by confiding a traumatic experience to him, and all Harry could think of at that moment was how it would feel to kiss him. He felt terrible.
“Come on – St. Mungo’s is only a few blocks this way,” Hermione said. “And seeing as you’re both much too drunk to apparate, we’ll have to walk,” she laughed.
His courage peaking again at his best friend’s words, his fingers quickly enclosed around the glass and he brought it up to his lips, knocking the vicious liquid back to an eruption of cheers.
He heard Harry huff a short, awkward laugh and his heart clenched from it, unable to stop his oncoming tears.
“I’ve done a lot you don’t know about, Potter.” Malfoy said, giving him a look that made Harry’s newly permanent blush deepen even moreso.
"He died?" Harry repeated, aghast at both the probability of Lucius murdering the child and Draco's lack of emotion.
“Who?” Hermione said interestedly, looking up at her husband as they came to a stop at a red pedestrian crossing signal.
“He nearly killed me the one time,” Malfoy said, still rummaging, and it was clear now that Malfoy was just as drunk as he was.
Harry nervously licked his lips, his eyes flicking down to Malfoy's half open shirt before he shook water from his fringe, then looked at him with a hard, daring expression.
"Are you mad, Potter?!” he yelled, straightening up. “Did those killing curses turn your brains funny?!"
Draco tried his best to keep his expression simple. He was admittedly shocked, not just from the truth of it, but from the ironic nature of an eternally brooding, usually mute ghost covered in blood calling
“Eight to seven!” the same young girl said loudly, smiling at Malfoy in a way Harry could only describe as seductive.
"Don't," Malfoy said quietly, and then in his best expression of disgust, "Do not talk to me with that wretched tone of voice, Potter. Like you suddenly feel sorry for me."
laughed, his bar stool almost toppling over as he stood up from it, his broad shoulders shaking as he gripped the table, head down in hysterics.
"A peacock?" he whispered in bewilderment, lowering his wand as unwanted memories began flooding their way back into his mind. As soon as his heart rate returned to normal, Harry removed his gaze from the majestic bird and continued towards the manor ahead. The last time he had seen that albino peacock he was being dragged up this path against his will, along with Dean, Griphook, Ron and Hermione.
“Right, then,” she said smiling. “Here you are… six more fire shots.” She set three down in a line in front of him, delicately holding each one between the thumb and middle fingers of her right hand as she did so. She placed the others down in the same fashion across the table in front of none other than Draco Malfoy, who had started all this nonsense, the bastard. He tipped her three galleons and she beamed at him before disappearing again.
He swept forward and Draco could do nothing as The Bloody Baron passed right through him, drenching him in the sensation of being dunked in the harshest of icy waters, making him gasp and shiver.
He felt the fabric of the Cloak slipping through his fingers as Harry pulled it, stepping closer to him.
“Er, thanks,” he said awkwardly, looking up at Malfoy again, and Malfoy was saying “You’re an idiot,” before somehow their mouths were pressed together.
"Listen," Harry said, feeling the familiar rage he experienced in nearly every encounter with the blonde standing in front of him. "You are a wanted man, Malfoy. The ministry has been diligently searching for you and your family since the day after the battle." Malfoy laughed at this, furthering Harry’s anger.
“Harry!” he heard from the back door of the bar. “Oi, Harry! You out here, mate?!” he heard Ron call again, just as he was centimeters away from kissing Draco Malfoy. Harry gasped again, stumbling backwards. Draco was looking at him, his gray eyes still dark, his expression hard.
"Tell me, Harry," Draco said quietly, still smirking and ignoring him. "Does the she-Weasley know you get off on other men?" His wand emitted hot sparks as it took everything he had not to throw Draco into a wall.
"I should have stayed at Hogwarts." Harry Potter muttered to himself, walking briskly along the yew hedge-lined pathway and dreading every step. "I should have just stayed there and helped with the repairs and then joined a damn quidditch te-" Something stark white appeared in his peripheral vision, cutting his self-berating short. He whipped around toward the offending thing and pointed a tightly gripped wand at it so fast, it took him a moment to register what it was.
The thoughts he had had for the first time that night challenged all that he knew and his very being. An internal crisis began to quietly wage a war within himself. He had been blindly following his parent's ideals without question for just over fourteen years. And then, as if an answer was appearing before his eyes, he came face to face with the object of his deepest, darkest secret.
"Not here," Draco said softly, pulling Harry by his wrist to follow him. He was naked except for the thin, tight white undershirt, and Harry let his eyes roam over Draco's back down to his pale, perfectly rounded arse. He was being lead out of the bathroom, back into the closet and into Draco's bedroom. He watched his surroundings change through a lust filled daze when the reality of it all struck him. He was most definitely about to have sex, something he had only done enough times to count on one hand, with Draco Malfoy. His school rival. A Slytherin. An ex-Death Eater. Another man. A man who, he reminded himself, had just practically confessed his love to Harry less than thirty minutes ago.
Harry's blunt nails dug into his back through his thin, drenched shirt, his mouth falling open as wet wool roughly rubbed against his over-sensitive cock.
Harry's hands were scrambling over Draco. They hurriedly pushed his open grey shirt off and went flying to undo Draco's belt. Harry pulled it free from the loops, and the buckle clanked loudly on the floor. Harry struggled with Draco's fly, and Draco's hands immediately went to aid him, releasing his lips from Harry's with a hiss when his cock was freed. His trousers slowly slid off his hips and piled around his feet. Draco wasn't wearing any underwear.
"You want me, Harry," he whispered, his hot breath ghosting over his face. And then, to his shock, Draco leaned forward and licked Harry's parted lips.
“Another nephew!” Ron exclaimed proudly as he broke their embrace, clapping Harry on the back. Hermione quickly went over to Ginny, who had still not stopped gaping at Harry, even as Hermione said “
"I just want to know who he was to you.” Malfoy turned his back to him. “You said you knew him. Was he your friend?" That's what did it. Harry saw his shoulders tense at the word. Draco’s emotions managed to find a crack in his mental shield and they ripped and tore through it until he was screaming.
"Why not?" Harry echoed back to him in the same seductive tone, and he swore he could see Draco's pupils dilating as the grip on his hand was slowly released. Harry lifted the fabric up and over Draco's head, his hair falling over his eyes. A deep blush was creeping across his sharp features, slowly moving down his neck and prominent collar bones to spread over the top of his bare chest. Harry's eyes followed it and then he realized why Draco had wanted to stop him.
"He's at George's," Hermione's head from Hogwarts in his small fireplace explained. "He needs some time alone to process everything, Harry. Much the same as you."  Harry had just been about to explain everything to her, but he realized she already understood. He also realized that the path had ended at some point and he had been standing in front of a very large front door for at least 30 seconds.
