Harry's prick leaped eagerly at Draco's sultry tone and proposition. Though his stomach was threatening to digest itself, dinner could wait. (Life-and-death situations--even relatively benign ones like earlier--tended to leave him hot and bothered; he couldn't even count how many hasty wanks he'd had in the Ministry loos.)

Something flickered in Malfoy's face. Harry was fairly certain it was an emotional reaction, not a spasm, but wasn't sure to what. Before he had a chance to decipher it, Malfoy'd locked it down.

Potter,

Dear Malfoy,
"Hm, no. I've had enough of walking for one day. After all, I did head straight for your place after a full day with Mother. Let's go back and... Relax a bit," and there was plenty of suggestion with that remark, wasn't there? "In fact, you should carry me! I'm running low on energy and if I am going to bear the label 'princess', then I should be entitled to a few perks--including riding my knight.
*****
"Lay back down, you poor delirious knob," Draco insisted, gently pulling Potter's elbows out from under him and pushing him back onto the bed. "And why aren't you under the blanket? You're as pale as a ghost! Is this what you consider 'getting better'? If you had come into work today I would have kicked your arse right back through the floo!"
He wasn't so keen on the handholding, but given the couple of days Draco had had and the fact he was venturing rather far outside of his comfort zone for Harry, he swallowed his displeasure and focused on the positives--the weather was nice, Draco's mood was surprisingly good, and he was about to eat his weight in chips. There might even be shagging in his future. Plenty of things to be happy about.
You wouldn't have to do all the cooking if you'd stop refusing to eat what I make! The same goes for the rest of the chores--if you choose to do everything because you find my attempts lacking (because they're not up to your ridiculously fussy standards) then you can't get mad or claim any form of superiority.
Potter was warm, possibly from fever, and his skin a slight clammy though still soft to the touch. Draco rubbed the back of his partner's neck and scratched at his somewhat sweaty nape hairs. With his face so close it was easier to see all the shades of green swirling in the sick man's eyes.
"Noon, really?" He whined petulantly to himself. "Ugh, whatever... Maybe most of the staff will be on lunch break by then anyway."
"A grand romantic gesture!"
It was like apparation the way his body seemed to be turning inside out, except the focus was his dick, not his belly button. Merlin, he wasn't sure he enjoyed it. His wrists stung and his prick throbbed and his hips burned and he might have pulled something in his back. The aftermath left him shaken, emptied out, exhausted.
"I did appreciate that, you know... You being so angry on my behalf. It was rather sexy to hear you growl like an enraged wolf."
He racked his brain for clues, filtering everything that had been said about the books.
As he rounded the corner to close in on his prey, he noted smugly that Draco hadn't told him to keep his hands to himself.
"You know, it's not nice to tease people, unless you're me," Draco said with a sigh as he sat back in his chair and was forced to let go of Harry's hand so they could finish their meals.
what he wanted to do.
Malfoy,
He bumped Draco out of the way with his hip and reached into the bag to pull out his cheeseburger--he did not need a plate or silverware for this meal. He tore away the paper and took a huge bite, heedless of fulfilling every last one of Draco's criticisms about his uncivilized eating habits.

affected by it. That much was unquestionable.
That was until he suddenly smelled bacon. It was permeating the air like a delicious, greasy tease to his nose. Slowly, cautiously, a blonde disheveled head rose like a mummy from a coffin and blinked. However, sitting up he found to be rather uncomfortable, so he groaned (not in pain, per se, but in definite discomfort) and laid back down.
Harry slumped back into the sofa, heartsore and defeated. "I hadn't thought about it that way," he admitted sheepishly. Draco harrumphed, likely owing to the fact he really should have because...well...Draco had been saying something similar for a while.
The world will thank you. Again.
"How long is it going to take you to accept that this is just bedtime?" Harry asked with affectionate exasperation. Draco smirked in response and pulled him to his feet, through the door, and toward bed--leaving the rest of Harry's now forgotten tart.
When you are ready to ask me to spend time with you, say the word; I have had more time than I know what to do with lately. (Though I have a few ideas now...)

"Now I would appreciate a real answer. How do
Harry mentally retraced his steps to see if perhaps he had been confunded or dosed with some sort of mind-altering potion without his noticing. The bloke looked like Malfoy (a looser, smilier, shinier version of Malfoy, at any rate) and he responded to the name, but he certainly wasn't acting like the Malfoy Harry knew. This friendly--borderline
without permission, you wanker. Need I remind you of all the food of mine you've eaten or the time you took my wand to do dishes? You can't expect it not to go both ways!
Harry grinned wide and leaned forward to nip at his lips.
It was a tremendous relief.
There was something he had to know, however. Beyond the shadow of a doubt.
Dear Potter,

P. S. I might be slightly out of uniform when you get here.
Having his hand suddenly taken was surprising, but only for a second. As their fingers interlocked, Draco curled his across the warm back of Harry's hand between his roughened knuckles. He squeezed to show his approval of the new tact, and promptly rolled his eyes at the wary way Harry glared around at the few evening passersby. Draco was far more comfortable than the angry looking Auror who appeared to have something to prove.
"How are you doing, physically? Have you kept up with any of your exercises?"
*****
..." he prompted circumspectly.
Sunday Special: Two Chapters for the Price of One!
Draco was so grateful he could cry. ...Possibly. He wasn't sure that ferrets had tear ducts. Regardless, he leapt off the sofa before he could think better of it and twined himself around Potter's legs in thanks.
*****
Quit stalling and get your pert little arse over here. You can think up reasons
Potter stopped immediately. "What?" he said, looking around for the unknown threat. Draco pointed at the nearest splatter mark and shook his head urgently. Potter sighed, giving him an expression that was simultaneously indignant and indulgent.
"It's here if you need it," he said, placing the potion on the nightstand. "I have to go now but, uh...you don't."
"I'm... Not ready!" Draco called from upstairs without revealing himself. "Just a second!"
Well, if you were pining away and if you had limited your conquests to dark-haired men with light eyes (Parkinson, again), why not approach me yourself?
*****
"It was... Interesting to see you both again," Draco let Granger kiss him on the cheek, though he did not return the favor. Instead he quietly promised to send a copy of his next book to her as soon as it was published.
He liked watching Draco, touching him, kissing him, feeling him. Merlin, he'd liked everything so far, so much more than he would have guessed or expected. He was blown away by the ferocity of his want, amazed that it could be so great after such a short amount of time (not to mention the even shorter amount of time since his last two orgasms). He didn't even know what he wanted to do next. A lot, really. But much of it was intimidating.

"Devil's Snare can't live in intense, tropical conditions," he muttered to himself, crunching along the gravel with heavy footfalls and sporting an unattractive rouge about his cheeks. "It would have died within hours. This was either intentional or they have a new gardener with the brain size of a shrivel fig! Either way, I intend to find out."
******
"Oooh
Harry was stunned. "How do you know that?" he asked, marveling at the beautiful, thoughtful gift. "And what were you doing in Russia?"
“That’s not what I meant and you know it,” he said, obviously enjoying himself.
He was in bed, as naked as he'd been when he took that...intimate... photo, feeling like a right tit as he waited for his partner to show up and call him on his bluff.
, Harry reasoned.

Draco considered Harry's offer for a cut with a vaulted brow as he stuffed a piece of chicken into his mouth and chewed experimentally.
"I think the Spotted dick is a bit tart, but have you tried the French chocolates? I was surprised to see them, considering the budget and all. Not the brand I would have chosen, but decent I suppose."
caught it.
Harry snorted at the odd combination of insult, accusation, and declaration.
I received the enclosed letter yesterday. I do not know if you initiated these proceedings or if you're even aware of them, but I wanted to contact you personally before getting solicitors involved. Hermione has advised my that I have strong legal grounds to contest the decision, but I'd rather not go that route if it can be avoided. My godfather left his inheritance to me. Not only does that carry significant emotional weight for me, but Grimmauld is my home (and has been since the end of the war). I couldn't care less about most of the heirlooms and artefacts--if you'd like to come over and sort through the attic, you're welcome to the lot of them. But I would be exceedingly grateful if you'd sign over the deed to the estate to me so I can be done with this unpleasant business and get on with my life.
Then after a beat, "What exactly is the lesson you hope to impart with your sad, cautionary tale?"
"So demanding," Draco admonished playfully as he released Harry's nipple with a wet slurp. He used both hands to grip the twin peaks hard and used the renewed addition of his weight on the Auror's cock to grind down into Harry's erratic thrusts.
He'd joked to Draco that he wouldn't know what to do with himself without him there (despite having lived alone since Hogwarts and rather enjoying his solitude under normal circumstances), so Draco thoughtfully left a copy of his latest work in progress. ('
Pansy looked like she was sucking lemons. "Have you been building up to sex during your

No response.

He carried the curry to the table to dish it into the bowls and motioned with his head for Malfoy to follow. "The chemistry between them is electric and undeniable," he continued, gaining steam. "And I especially like that their relationship has to overcome significant challenges, what with it being so unconventional." He seated himself and picked up his fork. "I've never liked for things to be too easy," he concluded with a wink.
"I tried to tell you before," he admitted, hoping he didn't sound too pathetic saying so. "Too subtly, I guess. That's not usually a problem for me," he wryly observed.
"Merlin, Potter," Draco exclaimed, throwing his arms over the shorter man's shoulders for balance, "if I'd known you were this eager, I would have had you over a desk ages ago."
rather stay right where I am." In case there was any doubt in Draco's mind about where, exactly, he meant, he gave him one long, slow withdraw and push, making the both of them shiver and groan. "But that's only if you're ok with it. I know some blokes are quite finished when they've finished."
When he wasn't doing his damnedest to drive Harry spare, Malfoy was a surprisingly good conversationalist. He was attentive, witty, and engaging, and his wry observations made Harry smile. Maybe it shouldn't have been that surprising given how much he enjoyed Malfoy's writing, but then, that wouldn't necessarily translate to interpersonal skills, he thought.
An hour had gone by. A whole bloody
Everything was going pear shaped. Not necessarily for the worse, just...unexpected.

"I don't hate you," he said honestly, quietly (mindful of listening ears). "And this isn't a trick or a trap. Really, I was hoping to figure out the same thing. Or if you'd been dosed with a lust potion or something. I never would have thought you'd want to...you know," he looked between them pointedly, suddenly bashful about giving voice what almost happened, even as he grieved its loss.
Thanks again!
"Mm... I don't know what I did exactly to deserve all this, but I am not complaining. The ambiance is exquisite, the lavender is strong enough to relax the senses but not over power them, and you even knew how hot I like my water." Draco turned his head to get a glance at Harry. "All that's missing in here is you."
oo00oo00oo
Draco had his right hand occupied by his fork and spearing a piece of squash. He was looking out over the yard when a large swallow caught his attention just before his left hand was taken. Draco blinked and turned to confirm the contact before smiling in return and squeezing his lover's hand.
“The spirit is willing, Malfoy,” he panted, hands braced on shaking thighs as he struggled to catch his breath, “but the body is weak.”
Draco rolled his eyes and gripped Potter's hips.
******
Potter,
Harry felt like it was Christmas morning.
Neville cleared his throat, leveling a serious gaze at Draco. "If I may, what are your intentions with Harry?" he asked somberly, making Harry feel both warm and anxious. Beside him, Draco tensed. He was pretty sure Neville meant the question neutrally, but Draco wouldn't take it so.
had recently been by. Lengthening his stride and laughing on an exhale, he hurried to follow after--
Freshly scrubbed and shining, in a clean set of his usual weekend uniform (denims and a t-shirt, as before, making him woefully underdressed), with his still-damp hair as styled as he could muster (which was to say, not much), Harry was lead by a somewhat subdued Bixby to the dining room. Blessedly, it wasn’t the one Tom Riddle had favoured for his “family” dinners—Harry learned later Malfoy had had that one shut up for good. This room was small by comparison, with just ten seats at the heavily polished mahogany table and a fireplace that only
Draco chuckled as he did as told, for once, and lifted his loafer covered feet to settle over the provided cushion. He leaned back with a long breath of relief and slowly closed his eyes, willing his body to let the alcohol do its work.

"Hm, your arse is firmer than I expected... Could probably bounce a coin off this thing."
Hermione looked at him, not for the first time, like Riddle's failed assassination attempt might have caused some form of permanent brain damage.
******
"You have something on your cheek," he commented as he cleaned the rest of them off with a gentle Scourgify. "Ready to eat?"
******
"I fear to tell you, but I have never cooked steak," Draco admitted as he took Harry's beer (he didn't snatch it, just pulled it away casually) and drank a quick swig. He nearly wretched, shoving it back at him and coughing. "H-How can--uck--how can you

Though you are correct that I could, I won't be making any bribes to keep you there. I have been all but grounded in the office without you. Apparently the higher ups don't trust ex-Death Eaters in the community without an armed escort.
Fucking hell. Why couldn't he just enjoy a quick, freely-offered buggering like a normal person?
Draco was at his office desk when a familiar "tap tap tap" at the window caught his attention. He was having a bit of writer's block, so at the sound of a tiny, feathered visitor he smiled and thanked the bird silently for the momentary reprieve from work (even if his next book was due in a month and he had hardly finished the first chapter.)
Draco tutted and shook his head, his brows furrowing with the renewed rush of guilt and concern. He lifted his clean hand up and gently pet Harry's unruly bangs from his face once again, gently scratching the skin of his scalp.
Harry sealed his mouth over Draco's arsehole and licked. Draco bucked like a wild thestral so Harry held him down and did it again. This was something neither one had tried before, though Draco threatened him with it on occasion. The taste was musky but not unpleasant and the act dirty and thrilling. Harry squeezed Draco's thighs and ate him out like he'd been born to it.
Using his fingers, he popped a juicy red beet into his mouth and savored the burst of flavour from Draco's citrus vinaigrette as he waited for Draco to serve himself.
******
"What next, Boy Wonder?" Draco prompted, forestalling Harry's royal sulk before it had a chance to establish itself. He was quick, that one.
He certainly didn't appreciate being called a coward--even implicitly--but a juvenile tactic like that should not affect a seasoned Auror like himself, who had been trained to resist physical and psychological torture of the highest magnitude. He could shake off an
"He's an ex, okay?" he 'admitted' reluctantly, with enough real embarrassment to be convincing.
Something else slotted into place in Harry's mind. Malfoy had admitted to fancying him as far back as school. Hermione thought the love interest in Prince Charming was a lot like him... Could it be that Malfoy had based some of his characters off of Harry?
Not. Thinking. About. It. he reminded himself sternly.
Draco was on top of him.
?!" Hermione's hands were firmly on her hips now, her eyebrows at the height of disbelief.
Draco flashed Harry a wicked smile.
That wasn't what Harry meant but when Draco asked so persuasively...
Malfoy's lips twitched. "You're not off the hook yet," he warned.

open minded.
"Maybe this is all a misunderstanding." (It wasn't. He knew it wasn't. But he was trying to be sensitive.) "If so, the investigation will clear that up. I promise to hurry everything along as much as I can. In the meantime," he fixed Draco with a focused gaze, "you shouldn't have any contact with them." It was critical Draco understood that piece. "If Goyle was right, it might not be safe for you to do so. Even if he was wrong, you're still in danger. Whoever set the trap in the garden wasn't him. I think you should have an Auror escort with you any time you leave your house from now until this is settled. And Draco," he softened his tone, "I'm sorry." He trailed his thumb over Draco's knuckles. "I know this is bloody awful."
It wasn't like Harry made a point of reading the articles about Malfoy or anything.
*****
.... Fuck..."
He sat back with his own glass, sampling the rich red Draco ordered for them. It was earthy with a hint of berry, not too sweet. He liked it.
Draco moaned softly as his mouth was dominated. He kicked his chair away from the table, somehow without breaking the kiss, leaving enough room in the seat for two. His hands curled into Potter's front pockets and pulled him sideways and forward until he had lap full of Auror. Both arms encircled the man and his kisses became more demanding, in case Potter was dumb enough to attempt escape. The curry was spicy and tingled along the thin skin of his lips. Potter, on the other hand, was a wonderful contrast--sweet like jasmine tea.

Draco
"How about... We grab what's left of the food and talk while we eat? I can hear your stomach from here and I need a minute to unbox myself for that one."
...Which turned out to be not all that far.
No. It wasn't possible. Not unless Draco was the world's greatest actor, and even then he would have a hard time accepting it: Draco was just too sincere for him to believe he would try to hurt him like that.
Harry chuckled warmly into Draco's nape, fine hairs tickling his nose where it nuzzled his skin.
The tension headache that have been Harry's constant companion for 30 hours and counting throbbed angrily at the base of his skull.
"I have food," Harry smirked. He had a well-stocked pantry, in fact.
Harry experienced the mental equivalent of one of Ginny's notorious Reductos. He rejoiced that Draco knew his identity and hadn't shown an ounce hesitation over it and he could have wept over how bloody good Draco's promise sounded, but then his useless voice of reason had to go and choose that moment to rear its stupid shag-ruining head and screech at him that letting Draco Malfoy have his way with him in the Atrium's loo was a Very Bad Idea, citing the following reasons:
He looked his greedy fill, feeling rather like a starving man at a buffet. He didn't know where to begin. Draco's sweet, pink nipples stiffened to peaks in the cool, open air. The flat planes of his stomach quivered in anticipation. His legs--
he, Henry?" she insisted, big brown eyes a mix of worry and interest. She hadn't believed his lame, "I don't know--I just had a bad feeling about him," for one second. The intrigue had attracted the attention of damn near everyone in the building (why did that always happen to him?). Several other therapists had gathered at the receptionist desk. There was no way he was getting out of this without a better lie.
*****
Anyway, I am not drinking nearly enough to even approach the limits of my tolerance. I was born with wine in my veins instead of blood. (Another "gift" of my upbringing.)
He didn't know how good a job he was doing hitting Draco's prostate, but he sure could toss him off confidently. He let go of Draco's knee to take up his prick and wank him to completion, trying desperately to hold off his own impending climax long enough to see Draco through.
"Before we're done getting to know each other," he clarified, relatively sure Draco couldn't twist those words to take them the wrong way. "Now, hush."
He looked over his partner's head to scan the room for options. The settee wouldn't do--it was difficult to get semen stains out of antique velvet (he knew from experience). "The writing desk," he decided, motioning towards the heavy oak furniture with his chin, "but I'm walking over there myself. I don't trust you not to stumble in those shoes."
The blonde stretched himself out across his couch like a languid cat first: his legs straightening out over the seat, toes spreading, torso twisting slightly, and his elbows curling over the comfortable arm. After a quick yawn, he finally stood up and walked around the couch. He picked up his wand from where he left it on the dining room table (he no longer needed a wand for basic locking charms he had done them so often), visible from where Harry sat, and quickly returned.
"I've got an update on your case," he began, facing Draco fully. "Goyle is awaiting trial. He confessed to the attack." Harry bit the inside of his cheek. Just say it. "He claims Parkinson and Zabini are involved. I haven't yet been able to confirm or disprove that."
"I can't feel past my waist," Harry answered in a strangled voice, panting desperately for air. His face was red from exertion. "Aren't these things... For slimming? I don't think a man's ribs are meant to bend... This way...
"Morning sunshine," Harry greeted sardonically as Malfoy yawned and stretched and slowly blinked himself to wakefulness (so much like a contented cat).
And he hadn't eaten since breakfast.
Dear Malfoy,
"I've heard of cake and ice cream served together but this is a first for me. Is this what ice cream cake tastes like? Just cake with ice cream on top?"
Draco blinked at Harry with the admission. It took a few seconds to register exactly what it was Harry was asking for--asking
*****
And how nice it was that Potter and what Draco assumed to be his Weasel friends were in a group just behind him! What a coincidence.
Harry ground his teeth hard enough to leave cracks. "I will not be posing for photos like that," he said tightly. "Not now. Not ever."
He wanted to ask if Draco was ready, if he was sure, but he'd already said yes to both. He might grow irritated or doubt Harry's willingness if he continued with the questions. So he lined up his prick with Draco's entrance and pushed.
"Harry? What's wrong?" Draco was covered from head to foot in ink splotches. "Are you okay? What happened?"
"Thinking didn't have a whole lot to do with it," he admitted, much to his chagrin. "It was a knee-jerk reaction."
Harry rapidly filed away information to sift through later--the shifting of Malfoy's gaze (up and to the right, recalling rather than fabricating), the way he plucked at the fabric of his pyjamas (anxious), the admission of his sexual interest in the (male) assailant and his level of intoxication, the name of the club (
Fine, I'll wear the tie, but it's your go now. Truth or dare?

"I'm ready," Draco panted, pressing himself up on his forearms to look back at at his partner. Potter grinned, mouth and chin shiny with saliva he hadn't taken the time to wipe, green eyes heavy-lidded and dark under long, sooty lashes. He'd lost his spectacles at some point, Draco noted belatedly.
Draco tried to laugh off the fact he'd forgotten to lock the door but Harry wasn't fooled--it was obvious it had rattled him. Harry almost said there was nothing to worry about as long as he was there to protect him, but it seemed far too early for that kind of statement--if things didn't progress beyond that night, it would just be cruel.
Blaise is suffering his sentence in Italy with distant family and Pansy is angry with me over calling her new shoes ugly. (Coral, though, really? Her feet are not an ocean ecosystem.)

Now, take this dirtiness as an apology as we tarry forth!

Dear Malfoy,
"If you're this frisky now, I wonder how you'll be if we have sex?" Draco chuckled darkly. "Shall we rut and save the suck for later, you beast?"
I would hope that you might trust my interest in self-preservation is on a much higher scale than the desire to embarrass you. And by all legal rights, as long as you retain these initial missives, you technically have proof of a contract between us--both to keep my mouth shut (I, Draco Malfoy, will keep all privy information on one, Harry Potter, privy) as well as the deal involving your home. You should be well protected against any potential deviousness on my part.
So I felt it best to end this one here. There just wasn't a place that wouldn't have been awkward to end it coming up in the next section which means this would have gone on foreveeerrrr.

Walking upright on his hind legs in his best approximation of a man's gait (which was damn near impossible with his soggy noodle of a body), holding Potter's wand in his jaw and waving it like he was casting a spell (as best he could--the piece of wood was relatively heavy and nearly as long as him), using a quill to make indecipherable scratches on a piece of parchment (he'd intended to write his name, but that he successfully did
Like Ron, she'd asked about the date, but, unlike him, she was personally invested in the answer. She'd smiled with justifiable self-satisfaction at Draco's glowing review. Her unconditional positivity gave Harry the courage to ask how she really felt about him and Draco dating.

Ron had turned his attention to the files since the conversation was far outside of both their comfort zones, but he didn't drop the subject. Harry knew he was being protective out of genuine concern so he tried to answer the questions in that same spirit.
"Maybe think about... not leaving?"
Sincerely,
"It's obvious you didn't intend to become a ferret," he remarked (apropos of nothing), trailing his fingers over Draco's abdomen as though he still had fur. "What did you
"I guess what I need is more courage," he smirked suggestively, but his words were somewhat shaky.
Harry quirked a half smile. "We wouldn't fit, I'm afraid. It would just be bumped knees, spilled water, and uncomfortably pinned arms, and someone would probably have the faucet digging into his back. But that's all right," he began unbuttoning his shirt while he spoke. "I had something else in mind."
He offered an off-handed thank you to the girl on her way out the curtain that separated their box from the hallway and glanced at their food for the first time. It looked good. Fancier than soup, salad, and starters had any right to be, but so much the better for Draco.
. Details. Passion. At least an embarrassing erection. Salazar.)
He wasn't exactly what Harry would call a new man, but his attitude was improved and his behaviour with it.
He slumped to the tabletop, listless and despondent.
"Come on then," he urged as Draco gasped and panted and trembled like a leaf.
Of course he'd seen other pricks--boarding school followed by the locker rooms in the DMLE--but he'd never been so up close and personal with one before, especially not one that was
Malfoy eyed him speculatively. “It didn’t seem to bother you before,” he hazarded after enough beats had passed for the ringing in Harry’s ears to clear. “What changed?”
"Why in Merlin's name would you think I would dump you over any of that? And, Godrick, no more talking about being AK'd, okay?"
At any rate, it isn't as if you haven't borrowed things from
When they stood a pace apart, he stopped to look Potter over, tutting as he did so. "I suppose this is what I get for inviting you over directly from work," he opined, neglecting to mention the man cut a mouthwatering figure in his leather jacket and snug-fitting denims. "Though would it kill you to wear something serviceable beneath your robes?"
Potter,
Not that it mattered—except to Harry’s wholly unjustified jealousy, which snarled at the notion and dreamt up all sorts of hypothetical scenarios for his stomach to twist itself into knots over. He already knew how this argument was going to end...
Potter inhaled sharply through his nose and Draco smirked against his skin. For a man so concerned with his propriety around house-elves, Potter didn't seem over-worried about how he'd appear sporting an erection for his fitting.
Once inside with the doors securely locked, he marched with a frown upstairs to his bedroom and flopped across his bed with a sigh of resignation (after stomping up the stairs to his inner-brat's delight). He breathed (whined) into his duvet.
“Show me.”
Brusque, but I'll take it.

But he wasn't yet finished. He summoned a Gryffindor tie and matching pocket square from upstairs and handed them over with a gleeful smirk. "Your penance, princess."

Oh, right. Harry remembered having heard something to that effect.
Dare.
"Ugh. What else is new," Harry said disgustedly, crumpling the paper and dumping it in the bin. "I don't want to talk about the bloody Prophet."
Outside, the sun was low in the sky and the light filtering in through the open window was the warm orange of late afternoon. Harry was surrounded by the leftovers of his tea, crumpled up balls of parchment, and the notepad on which he'd been jotting notes and guesses. The time had been good for his mental clarity, as he assumed--or hoped--it was for Malfoy's. (The man had not been exaggerating when he said that calming draughts hit him hard.)

Sincerely,
So he gathered his courage, licked a stripe over the shiny head (noting the slightly odd, but not unpleasant flavour), and opened his mouth to suck down as far as he could go without triggering his gag reflex.
Your Most Gracious BEST Friend,
Said prick leapt at the idea. "Is that supposed to be a threat?" Harry asked, genuinely curious. Draco's tone indicated as much but the words were nothing but enticing. So much so, Harry considered apparating them straight to Grimmauld in full view of any muggle passersby, Statute of Secrecy be damned.

Harry chuckled at Zabini's description. It seemed spot on.

No response.
I am going to eat so much treacle tart when I get out. You should come with me--I will need some company after this mess. I feel like I'm in prison. I haven't been able to deal well with isolation since I was a kid.
As long as you don't throw out my beer or my wardrobe, I see no reason not to try, but it would be a good idea to get to know each other first...
He peered critically at the craggy geography of his ruined leg as he peeled back the cotton padding previously held in place there. Vicious scars crisscrossed the puckered, negative-space where muscle ought to be. His hollow-feeling stomach lurched nauseatingly at the grisly sight. Harry screwed his eyes shut but couldn’t escape the images flashing behind his eyelids—dark wizards, brilliant wand bursts, blinding pain—nor the unpleasant sensations that went with them. Jerkily, he pulled off his socks and pants and hobbled to the shower; his limp always seemed worse when he was thinking about it.
Snape and Crabbe were easily eliminated from the suspect pool, being dead and all. Zabini and Parkinson had good potential as accomplices since they'd both abandoned Malfoy right before the attack. Goyle was a wildcard.
Since when?!
Harry
He surreptitiously scanned the room to find they were the focus of every single pair of eyes, including the gaping bride and groom. He sighed. There would be hell to pay for this little stunt.
"Catch," Draco called as he tossed the box over to Potter.
Draco chuckled and seemed to let the matter drop.
Draco was utterly spent. The grey light of pre-dawn was just beginning to peek in through Potter's window as they laid tangled up in his sheets.
Draco's questing fingers moved away from his arse, but as he licked Harry's prick like a lolly and prepared to take it into his mouth, Harry reckoned there was probably no better time for him to experiment with, well...
Fixing an image in his mind, he brandished has wand with a flourish and murmured the incantation to transfigure Draco's 'fancy' muggle clothes into a slim fitting dove grey suit. Draco had tensed during the spellcasting but grinned with relief when he saw the results. Harry was impressed himself.
"Fuck, Draco," he moaned between desperate thrusts. "You're so beautiful, and so tight...

Draco hugged the arm he had around Harry's neck gently.
Harry tightened his grip and gave a rough growl in answer.
"It's really good," he said appreciatively.
It was done.
a code-breaker, or at least someone smart enough to determine that's what the situation called for. Which...limited his options.
Noting his empty coat rack (he didn't own more than the one as far as regular outer-wear went), he realized his coat was still on Harry's desk.A reason to visit, perhaps.

, the wine he selected was brought a second later after placing their orders, and as soon as the bottle was opened Draco's was filled half-way whereas Harry was given the usual "taste". The blonde didn't go straight to drinking, however.
With a flick of his wand, Draco levitated the cup to the sink. He stood to answer the door, but not before taking a cursory look around his apartment--wondering what an impression it would make. Everything was sleek, black and silver, and made of Manticore leather in his living room (his bedroom door was shut tight and the entire floor warded to hide what looked like tornado damage.)
It was a large space, well-maintained and modern, painted an inoffensive beige and sparsely decorated with nature photos and unassuming house plants. A single wall was entirely mirrored (and a right pain to clean at the end of the day) with a ballet barre running the length of it. Another was mostly windows, lending enough natural light to take the chill out of the medical-grade fluorescent lighting that buzzed overhead.
Potter
"What the bloody buggering fuck is this all about?" he snarled, lashing out with his words rather than his fists or magic. Ron flinched, but held his ground, even puffing up a little. "It not like Draco's presence here was a surprise, you enormous fucking wanker," Harry continued. "If it's so bloody difficult for you to be here, maybe you should leave."
Harry ought to be pleased he’d lasted this long, honestly.
He walked away from Harry, loosening his grip until their hands fell away as he strode up to the door of Grimmauld. Apparently apparating into the place wasn't as easy as apparating out, which was more than fine to him. He turned to lean his back against the door and suck in his bottom lip--eyes wandering over Harry with an obvious leer.
"Come on," Potter urged, gathering him up in his arms. "It's time for dinner."
******
*****
Harry missed Ron's punchline. He forced a laugh because he could tell that was what was expected at that point in the story, but his attention was almost entirely consumed by the perfect arse on display at his eleven o'clock.
"Oh no, what ever shall you do with me?" Draco asked in feigned distress and laughter. "I'm such a delicate flower! I bruise like banana! Do you plan to implement torture? Oh woe is me!"
." He wasn't even bothering to hide his evil glee now.

She licked her lips like a wolf after catching their prey. Her beady eyes flashed.
You know I am. Hurry over.
He reached over to grab the bottle of lube off the nightstand and scooted to the end of the bed once again. "Budge up," he said, nudging Draco's knees up and back. He coated his index and middle finger with the slick substance and rubbed both down Draco's perineum and across his hole. Draco quivered under his touch.
if necessary! And be certain to take your vitamins. Are you getting low on medicine or food? I doubt your cupboards are well stocked considering your abysmal dieting habits at work. I'll send soup with a separate owl--don't ask the contents, but let us say it works best for nausea and headaches.
"Rubbish does not belong on the ground, Harry," he admonished playfully with a smug smirk to match. He turned to quirk a brow at the man. "Coming?"
Was it Harry's imagination or had Malfoy's voice gone deeper at the end? Sweat broke out on his temples.
But even in the face of so much incontrovertible reason, Harry remained adamant. Draco sighed and let his head fall back, his free hand idly pulling at his cloak. He closed his eyes, as if silently denying it all would make it go away.
Malfoy was just so—
It wouldn't be a bad way to go, all things considered. Infinitely preferable to an A.K.
"Here," he said, handing Malfoy the note once he'd finished with the receptionist.
He was determined to find out what it was.
"And, for the record, I don't subscribe to either one of those rubbish publications," he asserted, more evenly. "You're not the only one they write 'hard-hitting exposés' about, you know."
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin when he heard the knock. The wards surrounding his house hadn't shimmered so he knew the person at the door was someone he had deemed safe--Harry, most likely. He cleared his throat, ran a hand over his hair, and with all the Malfoy confidence he could muster (without all the Malfoy
"I would suggest taking a walk out there, but I do believe I snakes and spiders running amok. Who knows what else, but the neighborhood itself is muggle so perhaps nothing magical that might try to strangle us at least?"
Instead, seeing as he was already holding a quill, he composed a letter. He used the walk to the owlry to count his steps and calm his temper. Ron would probably be back from lunch by the time he returned--perfect timing, that--and then he could pour his energy and focus into work. That would help.
Finished with the task at hand (but not his mental turmoil), Harry pushed the IFC trolley into the corner and made his way to the front of the clinic to pull Adrian's file for progress notes. The kid was doing well--with almost full mobility back in his leg, he'd be discharged soon and back on the court not long after that. Harry'd promised to come cheer for him at his next big game; Adrian said he'd hold him to it. (Because Harry was bloody decent,
to throw in the towel.

It was hard to watch.

Draco took the few steps toward his date, knelt to the ground, and gently pushed Harry's legs apart before shuffling between them. He placed a hand on the Hero's tented trousers and squeezed.
*****
"Then we have a bit of time before he's due," Harry said casually (with his hands still in his pockets and his grin morphing into a sultry smirk). His eyes flashed up to Draco's in challenge. "Enough for you to undress me, if that's what you really want."
!" he exclaimed when Draco licked a broad stripe from the base of his prick to the tip. His body curled, knees widening and feet bearing down into the ground. He forced his hips still, however; he didn't want to accidentally choke Draco while he was doing him such a kindness. (He'd never tried himself so he didn't know for sure, but he suspected there was a world of difference between a lifeless toy that one was in complete control over and a warm body that moved and responded in unpredictable ways.)
Draco,
*****
He reached down to pull Teddy out from under the mess and surveyed the damage. He didn't seem any worse for the wear...besides the bright red icing in his spiky hair (which was presently dishwater brown--a sure sign of guilt if ever there was one; he almost never kept the natural colour otherwise).
Draco
Malfoy's bedroom door shut and locked with an audible click.
Lastly, how long is this stupid glow supposed last?
"And as soon as I quit, I'll lose it all," Malfoy interrupted, sounding bitter and defeated. "Until someday I have to choose between living out my miserable days strapped to a wheelchair with the house-elves spoon feeding me puréed meals or hoping I can get my hands on a proper poison because Salazar knows I won't be able to brew one at that point."
Score two for Harry.
*****
Malfoy rolled his eyes but it was with a suppressed chuckle.
******
With him sitting on the high table and Draco slouching a little, their faces were almost level. He threaded his fingers through the hair at the back of Draco's head and pulled him down for a deep, sloppy snog. (Bleg. He could taste himself in Draco's mouth--he didn't find the flavour any less unpleasant than when it belonged to someone else. Too bad.) While they kissed, he palmed Draco's prick and gave it a light tug and then a firm one, sliding his foreskin over his crown.
I would be happy to save you from your verbal stumbling if I might be so persuaded. After all, if your mouth is occupied by my tongue, you couldn't possibly fit your foot in there, as well. It is a rather ingenious method of problem solving, if I may say so myself.
Draco's face twisted, agonized. His legs spasmed and shook, his feet curled, his core flexed, prick bouncing against his stomach as he fucked himself mercilessly, looking straight at Harry whenever his eyes were open. It set a new standard for erotic stimulation. Merlin, it set a whole new category. In Harry's mind there was now a space for everything else, and one just for Draco. (Not only was he possibly ruined for other men, Harry feared he might be ruined for anyone else ever; he'd better hope things worked out between them or his sex life would take a serious downturn when they broke them off.)
They were fortunate Hermione hadn't decided to become an Unspeakable. When he said as much to her, she replied, "How do you know I'm not?" and Harry resolved to change all his pass-wards (little good that would do if Hermione was determined to crack them).
Draco accepted the glass as he set the binoculars aside. He wouldn't need them if it was a musical show (magical theaters often had great visuals to accompany music, and he supposed that muggles hadn't thought of such a concept yet.) He traded the flute into his left hand after giving Harry's glass a small tap, his now free right hand slipping casually onto Harry's thigh and squeezing.
He stepped away from Draco just long enough to kick off his shoes and shove his trousers aside (revealing he did indeed wear nothing underneath). Once that task was accomplished and Harry was totally naked, he moved back to his place against Draco--this time hooking both hands under the tall blonde's lean thighs and hoisting him up until his feet were off the ground. He grinned wide.
," Harry answered on an exhale.
Oh that's another one--your grades! So impressive. I think you'll make top boy this year.
"In that case," Potter replied, grinning, touching his forefinger to Draco's paw, "pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Ferret."
Potter set Draco on the bed before going to rummage through his drawers for clothes. When his back was turned, Draco gave in to the irresistible temptation to coat himself in the Gryffindor's musk, hating himself for it even as he was doing it.
He caught his rebellious eyes trying to wander over Malfoy's... unusual... outfit and coughed into his fist to cover it.
Damn the man--it was true.
"That was brilliant... Merlin."
Malfoy,
At first Harry wasn't sure who Lucius could have meant by someone he'd lost--unless old Snakeface was all that precious to him--but then he remembered the uncomfortable fact he'd done a good job of forgetting: that Lucius and Severus had had some kind of thing before Draco was born.
Vanity won out.
me, but that is neither here nor there--though maybe later."
"If you think I'm going to complain about being given the privilege of that sweet arse of yours, you're sorely mistaken," he replied easily, propping himself up on one arm to pull the covers back and determine the best approach for getting Draco out of his clothes as fast as possible. "I am up for the challenge."
Potter could have done worse, to be sure, but targeting Draco's hair two times in a row was ill-advised. His retribution would be meted out with extreme prejudice. First, however, Draco needed to spell his hair again, and he was most displeased by it because doing so was liable to result in split ends.
"..." Draco rolled again, a little more quickly this time. The blankets didn't loosen. "Harry, if you're still there... I believe I am stuck." His voice was muffled.
"About that confession from before... Any chance the cute smile you threw me really meant something?"
******
With its sleek white wall and curvy sign,
Harry beamed, trusting Draco to keep his word (how 'bout that?). With his hands now freed, he looped them behind Draco's neck to pull him down for a snog. They couldn't quite reach, but they could lap at each other's tongues and did so eagerly. He knotted the fingers of one hand into the silky hair at Draco's nape and trailed the other down his back and around his trim waist. Draco wasn't as thin as he used to be--he was still rangy, of course, but he'd filled out a bit, developed some muscle doing Merlin knows what down in the Department of Mysteries. It suited him.
"This is fucking
*****
"You're not even looking out for her, Draco," he hissed; Draco's heavy-lidded eyes were fixed firmly on the bulge in his trousers. He couldn't bring himself to unseat him, though--Draco was too damn sexy for either of their good.
Feeling guilty for snooping, however unintentionally, he slunk across the floor to Potter's lumpy, brown sofa and clambered onto it. The whole room was decorated with an emphasis on comfort over fashion, no surprise there. Draco intended to burrow beneath one of the mismatched pillows to give Potter at least a modicum of privacy--a man was entitled to an afternoon wank in his own home, was he not?--but then he heard something that made his ears swivel sharply in the direction of the bedroom and his neck twist to follow.
The ligaments in Harry's neck stood out, his head craning against his will as everything in his body tensed, primed for that final, delicious breaking point. "Merlin," he choked. "Draco!"
*****
, thus disposed, it was time to deal with the snake.
"You mentioned that before." Draco meant back in the sitting room when Potter had tossed the book at him. His cheeks heated once more at the confession, though the frown he was trying his best to sport was an obvious (and failed) attempt to hide his embarrassment. His eyes were staring down at the counter.
Draco,
Harry barked a laugh. He considered watching Draco roll helplessly in his tangle of blankets a while longer--it was really quite amusing--but took pity and came to his rescue. It took a concerted effort from both of them to finally free Draco from the mess.
Malfoy was a victim. Malfoy was intoxicated. Malfoy was fucking
*****
******
"... Greasy," he grimaced flatly. "Joy."
What looked suspiciously like the hint of a smile tugged at the corners of Malfoy's lips before he stiffened them. Something fluttered in Harry's chest. (Indigestion probably--he'd had Thai for lunch.)
"That's fine," Malfoy muttered, probably as relieved as Harry at the promise of a diversion. “But I will need to change first. I wasn’t expecting to work up a sweat this morning.”
Draco produced a bottle of something and made a cryptic allusion to it. No matter how Harry may have felt about blueberries in the past, he had the strong impression they were about to become his favourite fruit.
Harry tried a taste of the proffered ice cream. It was...not to his liking. (It was sort of sweet-bland, with an almost bitter aftertaste; he would have preferred something chocolate.) But that was quite all right. Draco could enjoy the whole thing.
******
For once, he was quiet.
*****
"Third year," he answered honestly. "Mostly short stories. Some of it was based on real life while others were just random ideas. No one ever knew or read any of it, though; not even Pansy."
"What will the neighbors think?" Harry exclaimed, mock scandalized, swatting Draco's hands away (yet again) so he could get the door open and take their foreplay out of the ruddy street.
Just get better soon. I would happily suffer even the bludgeoned mess you call a face again if only to do
He jogged to catch up and stopped his irate dinner companion with a hand on his arm. "Just listen to me, okay?"
******
He'd spent the better portion of the afternoon making preparations for Potter's imminent arrival. The house-elves were putting the finishing touches on a lavish four-course meal, Gieves was due at 6:30 sharp for the fitting, and the borrowed gown (Pansy's, from one of Blaise's ridiculous themed parties) was prominently displayed on a transfigured dress form by the hearth--like an out-of-season Christmas tree. He could hardly believe that what he'd first taken for a cruel prank--which had caused him to miss three entire days of work and resulted in no small measure of emotional distress--had concluded with his new partner, Harry-bloody-
The wards signaled Gieves arrival and Draco noted he'd evicted Potter not a moment too soon.
Harry rolled his eyes (oddly charmed).
"How long 'til dinner?" he asked (rather desperately) when Draco seated himself across from him.
He pushed back from the table with a harsh scrape of chair legs and stalked out of the room, putting distance between them for Draco's safety. The glasses in the cupboard vibrated noisily as he passed.
Fizzy anticipation licked up his spine and made his fingers curl against the smooth tiled surface. He held his breath awaiting Draco's touch.
"Come for me, Harry," Draco murmured before diving onto his cock once more.
"Why, Potter! Who knew you could be so... roguish?" There was a breathless quality to his voice as he replied. He wrapped his arms around the Auror's neck. "Well, lead on."
*****

Harry
Either way, prudence won out. He hurried from the room while Potter caught his breath, eyes still closed the last he checked. He'd give the man several minutes to compose himself before attempting wizard-ferret negotiations; time he could use to figure out just what he was going to do with this wholly unexpected revelation.
Dear Harry,
While he was neither a Healer nor a doctor, Harry had enough experience in both fields to know that Malfoy's symptomatology was not unlike that of an individual with Parkinson's disease. The prognosis was similarly bleak, though in this case, at least, it wasn't likely to worsen much beyond where it was presently, provided Malfoy made an effort to build and maintain his flexibility and muscle control.
Dear Malfoy,
snog looked like.
Hey Potter,

He walked unsteadily back to his chair and dropped into it, using the table as a protective barrier between them.
Draco
"Bastard," Harry growled, but there was no real heat behind the words. He liked that Draco had some fight in him. (Ian, on the other hand, had acted meek and accommodating while secretly playing him for the fool; not that he expected him and Draco to date or anything.)
I don't know how many different ways I can say it. If I didn't want it, I wouldn't have offered. (Which I have done. Repeatedly.)

"Any form of heavy activity is bad for the flu, but if you're going to be so insistent I suppose there is no point in trying to dissuade you." Draco barely suppressed a smile as he playfully turned his head so that his chin was properly up. "You seem to be 'well enough' to do most of the work, so you can do the fucking."
I had no clue
Who was Harry to stop him?

*****
Your genius astounds.
Sincerely,
"Fuck, Harry...!"
“What now?” Harry asked. He didn’t want to stop but he also wasn’t convinced they should continue. What would Hermione do?
Ask Ginny.
? ...I drink. Read. Drink. Write letters, drink, garden every other day, design furniture, drink, smoke, and drink.
"Hang on a minute," Harry replied, urging Draco to stay. "I'm nearly done here. I just need to make the hand off to Savage when he arrives and then we can go together."
He took a breath and steeled himself for the next one. They'd hardly ever talked about it and he knew it had to be significant...he just hadn't wanted to ask before. "How are you doing with everything with...um..."
He shrugged off Harry's accusation. "Okay, you caught me. But I bet we could do it of we tried. And used a bottle of that Triple-O potion."
"You said something about... Auror escorts?" he leaned toward Harry as his voice deepened. "Does that mean you'll be following me around everywhere, all day and night?"
"Mother and father moved out a year or two after the war," Draco assured as he closed and locked his floo (so no one could get in, not so they couldn't leave.) "They reside in France. Now, did you want to continue this ever-so interesting conversation about the parentals while we both stand nude, or shall we go upstairs where the instruments of torture are?"
"Fine. But I had better at least be a pretty princess or I will withhold other things far more satisfying than your dessert."
Harry barked a laugh. (The man was funny, as well? He was learning all kinds of new and interesting things about Draco Malfoy.) His arse was leaking onto his desk and felt empty and underused; his spent cock lay limp across his hip in a shiny puddle of semen.
People
At the present, Potter was holding him suspended a scant few inches from his face, babbling at him about how he'd love to keep him but that would be unfair to his owner who was probably distraught over losing him, and that he really should put some clothes on and go looking for that person but that Draco was just too adorable to leave, even for a short while.

He meant that truly but he hoped Draco would opt to head back. (That blowjob sounded better by the moment...)

"Nevermind. I assumed you'd understand what a big deal it is for Mother to approve of you, even though there is certainly no way you could know, so I should not have expected any response beyond dismissal. As for anything else, I shouldn't have been so sensitive. What did you buy for dinner? I didn't get much time to see what it was before you stuffed it down like a rabid wolf."
"Right. And I'm the Queen."

"That was fast," he dryly remarked.
Besides food, they had continued experimenting until very few things were left from their sexual repertoire, including actual penetration. In between ruts, their conversations grew increasingly intimate (and Harry had even convinced him to read his smut out loud, which turned into another kink). No one would have to worry about the health of their sex drives for a long time, it seemed.

Draco patiently kept his hand outstretched in invitation. His grin widened at the look of shock on the Auror's handsome face. Without the glasses, not only were his eyes no longer obscured (and they were quite a brilliant green), but his cheekbones were also visible. They added to the realization that Harry Potter was, indeed, a full grown man now. A blush threatened.

It was rather sudden, but none the less intense. Draco's balls constricted and his head fell back again with a cry. His own hands gripped the Auror's ass tight enough to cause his knuckles to turn white. He breathed out a moan as he emptied--slumping backward into Harry.
However, he knew why it mattered to Potter: because it was Potter. Mentioning the needle may have been a mistake, and now the Slytherin wondered why he had mentioned it at all.

Harry shrugged. "I follow the evidence where it leads. And I learned a long time ago not to discount or underestimate anyone. For good or for ill." He thought of Snape, Pettigrew, Neville, even Malfoy. So many times his assumptions, and those of others, were catastrophically off the mark.

Erring, for once, on the better side of caution, Harry resisted forcing himself inside. But only just. He wondered if and when the door would be opened again and how he would make good on his threat if Malfoy called his bluff. Somewhere around the time he started eyeing a nearby trellis to assess its viability as a ladder, the door opened once more, this time by the "Master" in question.
Malfoy did not snog like a novice.
I'm wearing it now, in fact.
Draco stirred the potion carefully, noting its colour and consistency. The viscous liquid shifted subtly from pale turquoise to aquamarine and gave off an aroma not unlike wet dog. He was getting close--he could feel it. He might even have the recipe perfected before the students returned from winter hols.
"Right," Granger nodded (very much like Potter in the mannerism) and examined an entry closely, absently chewing a stubby thumbnail as she worked.
Hell, his lover looked about ready to black-out.

Draco let his hands drop from Harry's shoulders to his hands and led him to the dining room. The table was laid out like an expensive seafood buffet, which it technically was. The blonde Slytherin handed Harry his plate.
Harry awoke before Draco (which wasn't all that surprising seeing as it was still morning). They'd tossed and turned through the night and ended up spooning, with Harry on Draco's back. His arm was cast possessively over Draco's waist and Draco's ticklish nape was a scant inch away from his face. Try as he might, Harry couldn't resist the temptation to rub his nose in the soft hairs there.
"Come on," Harry urged. "Everything's ready and our guests are waiting." He rubbed the small of Draco's back and added, tone softer, "You look great."
Harry grinned down at the adorably pouting man below him, arms braced on either side of his head. "You might like it better when I tell you my plan was for

Taking the parchment it bore in exchange for a bit of rice, he settled back in his chair and looked over Malfoy's reply. He was surprised Malfoy had agreed to come to the Ministry, though of course he had a long list of terms and conditions to do so.
"Oh, right." Potter gave a self-depreciating grin and dropped the towel to step into a loose pair of faded denims. "Um...bark once if this was on purpose and twice if not."
Draco saucily replied (because Potter didn't understand him so he could).
I will have you buried to your throat in cursed objects and litigation that will leave you incapicitated for months," he snapped, narrowing his silver eyes dangerously.
cause a scene? Or mine for that matter? Just being in the same room causes a stir, so why not?"
Shit. What if it was someone trying to hurt Draco? The same attacker from before, even.
"You know," Draco practically purred, "I always feel so randy after writing... certain scenes. I even ended on something particularly naughty, thinking of you."
"Harry," Draco breathed in surprise as he flashed him a smile, "What happened to your rule about not spoiling me or I might start expecting it all the time?"
