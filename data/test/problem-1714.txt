He eventually finds himself on his back in the grass by the lake. His eyes are shiny, fragments of golden light caught in the beads of water that form at their corners as the sun starts to massage the horizon. Draco wishes he felt different than he did before, wishes that rationalizing everything would make it better. But as much as he tries to deal with the things that plagued his conscience, he knows that there is external work to be done.
“Actually, the link can’t break,” Hermione cuts in. “It’s blood magic, Ron. They’re bonded at a biological level.”
Harry sighs through his nose. “No, I suppose not. Look, Draco, I think I owe you something of an apology for the way I spoke to you last week. I’ll admit that it was uncalled for. However—” he says, holding a finger up before Draco can speak, “if you think this means I’m not still angry with you for what you said, you would be wrong.”
He lowers his eyes again. “Draco and I went down into the dungeons.”
Is it possible? Could he be…gay? Or bisexual, maybe? He thinks back to his experiences with girls. Of course there had been ups and downs, especially with Ginny. But he’ll be damned if he can think of a single up that was as good as simply feeling Leon’s hand in his. A single moment where sparks had crackled up his spine and every nerve in his body had lit ablaze. No, he doesn’t think bisexual is it, if he’s being honest. But the idea of being gay? There’s something that feels almost…correct about that. Like a puzzle piece that’s been in the right place the whole time, but has finally been rotated to fit with the rest of the picture. And it scares him. After everything he’s been through and everything he’s done, it feels like the whole world knows him. To think that all this time, he might not have even known
Potter stops talking and grabs Draco’s free hand, drawing his wand across it. Draco hardly even notices that his hand splits open, more precious drops of his pure blood crashing to the floor. Potter does the same, wincing.
“And you’re sure your being here won’t effect the trial at all.”
And right Blaise is. There’s a certain tension in the Great Hall caused by the small cluster of Slytherins sitting at their table, joined by (to Draco’s surprise) three first years, bringing the House total to nine. Draco attempts to ignore the pointed looks tossed in their direction, but it does rather feel like being in a zoo enclosure. Once the headmistress makes sure the Sorting Hat finds a safe place, she turns to the room and addresses the buzzing crowd, holding her hands up for silence.
“I feel you should change that,” Draco says carefully. “Though I have virtually no relationship experience, I can only imagine that having something like that hanging over your head can’t be good when attempting to forge a new connection. I’m just a bit worried. You’ve moved on so quickly.”
There’s a knock at the door and McGonagall calls “Come in!”
The article goes on to warn against approaching his father or trying to capture him, but instead suggests submitting a tip to the Auror Office. It goes into a further consideration of why the Ministry hadn’t revealed his absence sooner, as well as questions regarding what other Death Eaters or other criminals might be loose. It ends with another discussion of Narcissa’s and Draco’s complacence in all of it, but Draco is unable to read beyond the first few sentences of that paragraph.
“Harry? Are you almost done?” comes Leon’s voice from the doorway. “Oh, I’m sorry, am I interrupting something?”
something going on!” Ron says accusingly.
“So, shall we play first to fifty points, then switch off so we all get a chance to play?”
The two boys exit her office in silence, mulling over this new dark development.
“That was all really impressive, you know. The flying, and the catch. And being made captain.”
bend, or you’ll break. There’s nothing more to it. Not when the lives of your loved ones are at stake. Matter of fact—Pamela, go and fetch him.”
“I meant me, yeah.”
Mari nods. “I know what I’ve heard from the papers and by word of mouth, but I know nothing about who you really are. We’ve only just met, after all.”
for him.
“You’re sure?”
“As you’re aware, the Autumn Ball is next Saturday. Myself and some of the other members of the faculty are worried that having so many people gathered in one location is a recipe for a much larger disaster. So, my question is, do you plan on attending?”
Leon stops reaching for his shirt and comes close again. “Maybe we’ll both cry today,” he says. His eyes do look misty, now that he’s closer. “I feel the same way. I…I see now that your hurting me was never intentional. I figured as much, but it seems so obvious now.”
Draco looks up. “You think so?”
Disarray doesn’t quite cover the spectacle. Not only is the actual structure of the first corridor crumbling, but demolished statues, damaged paintings, and dented suits of armor have been relocated to the space along the walls. Large holes of stone are missing completely, dirt and rock spilling into the hallway from the other side. A thin layer of scummy water coats the floor beneath them, causing their feet to slip as they walk. A few inhabitants of the paintings are wailing. A suit of armor creaks and attempts to salute as the pair passes.
“Maybe it’s just because of the extent of my injuries. She didn’t want to risk anything happening out with the rest of the people being treated.”
“There is, actually. Um.”
“That’s right.”
“Wow.”
“You can tell me the truth, Harry.”
Leon grins. “Ron is going to help me start collecting the cards.”
“Anything you need to talk about?”
in my life…”
“Ron, do you remember when Draco was almost killed towards the beginning of the string of strange accidents?”
She looks down at her hands and takes a deep breath. “You’re sure? And what about the classes you’re missing?”
Draco snorts. “Harry said the same thing.”
Because isn’t it the case that life really happens in the moments
Potter starts muttering to himself, swearing intermittently as he works through a plan.
“That I’ve had a boyfriend before you? Yes, that’s true, but that relationship didn’t last very long, and it didn’t feel the way this does. It’s the only other experience I have.”
one he’s prepared to face.
“Right. Those.”
. I know that can be difficult, maybe even impossible to believe, but I’ve seen him become an entirely different person. His father is trying to drag him down in order to reduce his own punishment. He’s innocent,” Harry repeats.
“A-ha! So that

carried the hurt and the fear. But never had it taken hold of him like this. And never with another to bear witness.
“Has it occurred to you that maybe she wasn’t completely truthful?”
“No. I agree. So that’s why, for me. I want to get my parents back, and then I want to make sure nobody is ever stolen from themself again. Memories, even though they can be so painful and impossible to deal with…They’re what make us
“I’m sorry, did I say something wrong?”
And Harry thought he couldn’t get any redder.
Blaise clears his throat and Draco gasps, dropping his quill. He’d completely forgotten that he’d volunteered to stay for a while, he’s been so quiet.
“My father will be bloody pleased,” Ron had said with a roll of his eyes.
There’s a pop and a whoosh—that might actually just be the sound of oxygen rushing back into his lungs. He spins in a circle and looks down at this body; all of his limbs are still there. A drop of blood hits the floor and he swears. One of his fingernails didn’t survive the journey. A small price to pay. Like it had before, the house seems to come alive with his presence, and a sound like distant chimes sings from the walls as his blood seeps down into the carpet.
“She’s right,” McGonagall says. “A slap on the wrist is likely all that’s warranted for interest in this kind of information. After all, it’s available in our very own library.”
His pulse jumps again. Today. Leon is returning
Harry can’t help but feel a tad ashamed of himself for all of the years he’s taken Hogwarts for granted, every time he cursed the trick step on the staircase outside the Great Hall, all of the times he’s grumbled when he couldn’t find a classroom. There’s something about seeing Leon experience it for his first time that pulls upward at the corner of Harry’s mouth.
The same grounded nature that Harry admired about Leon burgeons from his lips like roses. He can tell this boy likes him because he’s
Harry rolls his eyes. “Now I’m not so sure.”
Harry almost falls over when he sees that, just beyond Draco, Ginny is giving him a death stare. He almost wishes it would actually kill him.
he blushes, looking away. “i have no idea what you’re talking about.” draco sits up a bit, biting lightly at harry’s bottom lip. “is that really what you think of me, potter?”
is what it means.
going to do anything for him.
there’s a pause, and draco runs his eyes over his friends - blaise and goyle slumped in their chairs disinterestedly, and pansy with both of her elbows propped on the table, staring across at draco. his eyes stray to the overturned lube bottle, and he reaches out, picking it up and turning it about.
he was forgetting something. “well, you and achilles can bond while i go back out and get it!”
“fuck you,” he chokes, his eyes watering more now. inexplicably, tears threaten to escape, and he forces them back. “fuck you.”
he had dedicated the last year and a half to making sure his home was something he could be proud of and comfortable in - and he had lovingly filled very inch of it with objects and furniture that made him feel at ease. he loved the wide windows, and the stained wood furnitures, and the eclectic patterns he had picked by hand from small craft shops in muggle london. draco's cat, briseis, tended to shred anything at ankle-height and leave her toys everywhere, and there were abandoned mugs littering the coffee table and fireplace and almost every other horizontal surface. candles and incense sticks littered the shelves, and there was a distant tinkle of an unseen windchime. the place looked a bit zany - but it was home.
the familiar euphoria ashes over him even now as he navigates the unfamiliar suv of the dursleys - larger and cheaper than what he was used to but still passable. once he figured out how to work the gadgets and buttons they were off, with the windows down and the stereo tuned to some station that played fuzzy old music that draco hummed along to even though he definitely didn’t know the tunes. he drove as if he had been born to do it - one had on the wheel and the other on the console, his and harry’s fingers lightly intertwined.
“pansy!” draco protests, and then pulls the phone down to his lips. “i’ll call you later,” he adds quietly.
harry, never one to half-commit to anything, pushes his finger completely inside, pressing lightly against draco’s prostate. when he lets out a scream of pleasure, harry quickly pulls out, chuckling lightly. and so it goes, with harry applying exactly the right amount of pressure but for never enough time, while draco bucks wildly, curses dripping from his mouth like saliva.
“wait, adam, just - wait a moment. i’ll call you back.” hermione quickly hung up, rushing after the wizards in lime robes. “excuse me!” she shouted, breaking into a run. one of the healers turned around, her eyes scanning hermione’s face as realization dawned over her.
“sorry about that,” he muttered, practically leaping from bed and rushing out of the door.
harry seemed to be attempting to write something, and was dragging his feet through the sand methodolically, staring down at the ground hard. he had already finished what looked like a large “i”, and jumped to another point in the sand before starting a curve. he hadn’t noticed draco yet, and seemed to be muttering to himself. as he finished a haphazard heart, he jumped again, starting on what was presumably a “u”.
“just to everyone else,” draco says quickly, because a small part of him still
on the last day of their vacation, they woke late in the day. sunlight was already streaming through the windows, casting patterns across their white duvet. they chatted idly for a while - lamenting the idea of returning to london and having to go back to work and normalcy. france had been a dream - and neither was ready to wake. when harry pulled the small box from beneath his pillow, draco blinked at it for a few long moments, wondering silently if his eyes were deceiving him.
“i bed to differ.” draco spat, the pitch of his voice rising. he looked an uncomfortable mixture of constipation and fear, and in any other circumstance harry would’ve laughed.
harry doesn’t respond. instead, he stands and turns away from the table, walking away without a second glance at draco. distantly aware that he had just been left with the task of footing the bill for all of the abandoned drinks. draco fished out a few coins and dropped them onto the table before standing and stumbling after potter.
changed. draco stares into his eyes - they’re clear, clearer than draco had seen them in a very long time. he looks healthy and fit, as if he started working out more, and perhaps doing yoga after draco had left. he’s clean shaven, and his hair is longer, brushing his neck attractively. his shoulders are relaxed - and the stark difference between the harry that stands before him and the harry he had seen last, the hard shoulders and back, is jarring. harry looks good, like the man draco fell in love with, all those years ago, and it pains him like nothing else.
he sighed, looking down at his mother with a sad smile. “mum, i need something completely new. it’ll be good for me... i’ll be able to move on. beside, it’s not forever. i have to come back home someday.” he doesn’t add the fact that he thinks it’ll be a very long time before he feels
he finally tapers off, looking at draco expectantly.
“no, harry!” draco says loudly, his voice raw and far more desperate than he had intended. he wants to fall to the ground beside him, to cry and shake and completely fall apart as hurt slices open his insides, spilling out everything he had kept inside for so long. “stop,” he pleads, shaking his head. he doesn’t want to -
draco burst from the lift as soon as the doors opened, his hands trembling as he felt himself drawing closer to harry. he passed the head auror’s office - storming past a few friendly faces who waved or greeted him. he kept walking, eventually reaching a room he knew to be the auror debriefing room, if only from description alone.
. draco had seen him before, in real life. he was one of the interns in the auror office, and frequently ran errands for harry. the boy was small, and waifish, and looked distinctly like an elf with his curly brown hair and comically blue eyes. the idea of harry actually seeing, or worse, interacting with simon today made draco gulp painfully, completely abandoning his cold tea and half finished slice of toast.
“why do you have them?” pansy asks quietly, putting a hand at draco’s back and moving him towards a quieter corner. it doesn’t make a difference - people have already noticed them and are watching as draco shakes visibly, glancing around and curling and uncurling his fists as if he’s gone mad.
most witches and wizards opted to use them - it could be written into a will that following the death or prolonged absence of a magical signature, a notice of their death would be sent out to all friends and family the following morning, hence the name. this was yet another one of the concepts in wizarding society that harry had been ignorant about. draco, on the other hand, was very familiar.
“harry, darling,” draco whispers, taking another drag. “you know i’d face any fear for you.”
“you’re going to wear a bloody hole in the floor,” draco commented, closing his book and looking up at harry with twinkling eyes. harry ignores him and ventures into the study anyways - despite having left it only an hour prior. “stop the pacing, you’re making me anxious.”
“what do you mean by someone who deserves me?” harry interrupts, pressing a gentle kiss to the spot behind draco’s ear. “i’m not an object to be won!”
“it’s a mourning bird,” draco whispered, drying his slightly shaking hands on a towel. “someone’s died…”
“oh, merlin,” harry laughed, cocking an eyebrow and taking a small sip from his own snifter. “go on,”
“so, what’ve you been up to, malfoy?” potter tried again, turning his body towards draco this time. draco groaned inwardly - the last thing he needed was potter trying to strike up conversation tonight. he didn’t want to end up on the front of the prophet with some inflammatory headline proclaiming his intentions to seduce potter to the dark side, or some other rubbish.
he’s already half hard - a result of draco’s lingering touches and vulgar words. however, he had no intentions of acting on his arousal. after all -
“ron, there’s no service on this floor, i’m gonna go down for a bit. i’ll be right back,” she pokes her head back into the doorway, but ron doesn’t even glance up at her. he’s always been this way - supportive of her ambition and in awe of her drive. ron had always been more family-minded, but it was a dynamic that worked. ron, with his job at the joke shop, was able to take as many days off as he wanted to spend time with rosie, while hermione was required to report to the ministry nearly every day.
“what are you doing?” draco called, considering getting up and following him but deciding against it.
“oh,” draco says, looking down. “how did you find me?” it had been a fear of his for a long time - the idea that harry would show up to wherever he was, tearing down wards or breaking through doors, just to get through to draco. and here he was, standing on draco’s doorstep as if he had a right to be there.
“wasn’t planning on it.”
he doesn’t finish the sentence, doesn’t know how to. there are too many variables, too many different things that can fit on the end and still work. so much that he can no longer do - not without harry’s warmth and his smile by draco’s side..
draco was decidedly in his element, wrapped in a thick blanket and curled up with some novel. he hadn’t moved in the last few hours, except to push his reading glasses up his nose or tot urn the page. he loved snow days, and was perfectly content to spend the day curled in front of the fireplace like a cat, drinking up the warmth and occasionally padding into the kitchen to nibble at something.
draco winces as harry flicks his wand once more, changing the channel on the television once again. he had been switching between about three different films and watching short scenes of each, although he kept flicking to the next film just as draco had started to grow interested in any of them.
, he gets to pretend to grieve, as if he didn’t
“at least they’re not as bad as harry and malfoy,” ron groaned, his eyes flickering over to the dance floor.
“i wanted to see you,” harry says softly. “so that you can know i’m better now. that i’ve changed.”
draco sighed and turned away.
and then the floo roars again, and hermione tumbles out. she doesn’t say anything, just immediately whips out her wand and begins to cast rapidly, sealing the floo and throwing up wards around the house. draco can recognize a few repelling and protection charms, and doesn’t know how he feels about the fact that she’s putting them up against her best friend, in protection of someone who once sneered at her and called her a
pansy stood to leave, but draco pulled her back down, staring at her with pleading eyes.
, he thinks bitterly.
“draco,” lucius said stiffly, he hesitates for a moment before opening his arms, pulling draco into a hug. draco goes into his arms easily, inhaling his fathers scent of lemongrass and bergamot and savoring the moment. “take care of yourself, son” it’s not a declaration of love, but it touches draco like one. he blinks hard as he pulls away from his father, smiling tightly.
with one final dark look at pansy, draco began to recount his dream. his friends listened dutifully, gasping and sighing at all the right moments, bless their hearts.
after what felt like hours, the healer stepped away, frowning beneath his bushy mustache. he closed his eyes for a moment and bowed his head - folding his hands before him.
once the plates had emptied for the final time and they were all pleasantly full, the music grew louder once more and harry and hermione stood from their seats.
“i do,” draco whispers. “i love you so much that it fills me up and makes me cry.”
harry didn’t feel the same way, as draco was sure he wouldn’t. he had been a fling, something fun for harry to do over the last few months, a body to keep his bed warm on the colder, lonlier nights. would he laugh in draco’s face at this confession? would he tell his auror friends over drinks at the pub tomorrow night - starting the anecdote with a ‘
me to watch you do this to yourself.” tears surface in his eyes, but draco doesn’t bother wiping them away. his voice remains steady, even as the first tears fall to the surface of the table. harry’s eyes follow the path of one down draco’s cheek and chin, and onto a spot on the table beside draco’s spilled coffee. “i love you, harry. so much, that it honestly scares me sometimes. but i live everyday in fear that you might overdose, or take the wrong thing, or do something that’s laced… i don’t even know where you’re getting it from -”
“so, malfoy, pray tell: what exactly is your plan here? you do realize you live together, right? what are you going to do when he comes home tonight? and every day after that? ignore him until he breaks up with you?” blaise sneered at draco, his lip curling cruelly. draco bit down the desire to draw his wand.
touching, for them, had always been something mutually treasured. it wasn’t uncommon to find them wrapped around each other - whether that be curled together in an armchair at the burrow during a sunday dinner, or in their own kitchen, with harry leaning over draco’s shoulder as he stirred the contents of a pot. however, public events often called for them to limit their touching to nothing more than occasional hand-holding if the moment called for it. rarely, they even got the opportunity to share a kiss outside of the confines of their own home. it’s a special kind of torture, harry thought, designed specifically to make him hate holding office even more.
they go again and again and again, making up for lost time and reintroducing themselves to each other, until it’s dark outside, and the idea of moving seems impossible. now, they move together, harry throwing an arm around draco and pulling him close. his eyes are heavy and he feels his body easing into unconsciousness, so he leans up and brushes his lips against harry’s harry, although awake, doesn’t make an effort to deepen the kiss, instead allowing their lips to brush each others delicately - and somehow, this is more intimate than anything they had done all night, even when inside and all around each other.
subject himself to that all-encompassing hopelessness. not again.
“i missed you,” harry says softly, matter-of-factly, as if this is just a thing that he is allowed to say, after walking back into draco’s life after two years. “i've missed you so much, this entire time that you’ve been away. i wanted to reach out, just to see how you were doing… but nobody would tell me where you had gone. i've been trying to find you since last year. i finally got your address about a month ago... i've been working up the courage since then.”
“don’t worry about it, draco,” ron had said gruffly. “we’re sorry. for not noticing something earlier.”
after all, he was the worst offender - he still loved harry deeply, and would probably continue to love him. he often thought about what he would do if harry appeared before him, apologetic and with open arms. draco was sure he would crawl right into them, drawn into harry’s magnetism like a forgetful moth.
malfoy manor hadn’t had any close neighbors - neither had any of the wizarding homes he had visited, ever. each house was unique in design and personality, and perfectly suited to the needs of each family. the houses lining privet drive lacked any sort of personality or flair, and it looked, frankly, depressing.
“i’m acting like a prick?” draco asks incredulously. he turns back to their friends, who are all in various stages of sobriety. “finnegan is dancing on the bloody table, but i’m acting like a prick?”
“he’s not cheating,” pansy said matter of factly. “your relationship seems so perfect, why would he risk that?”
“no,” harry murmurs. reaching across, he takes draco’s chin is his hands, running a clean finger across his lip. not breaking eye contact, draco runs his tongue across the tip of harry’s finger. in his pants, harry feel his cock twitch with interest. draco and his damn mouth always seemed to have that effect on him.
draco woke with a start, his heart pounding wildly in his chest. he felt hot and overwhelmed, and suddenly had the desire to stand outside and scream into the open air. he was still pressed tightly to harry’s chest, one arm thrown around his waist and the other supporting his head. slowly, he removed harry’s arm and stood from their bed, his legs still feeling shaky.
the fight leaked from draco’s body like a deflated ballon. his fire faded rapidly, transforming into a dim candle before quickly extinguishing completely. he slumped forward, sprawling onto the ground beside the circle of pebbles - beside harry’s final resting place. as he pressed his cheek tot he soft earth, draco swore he could feel the familiar caress of harry’s magic, warm and playful and welcoming.
“i know you must think i’m foolish,”
flustered, hermione reached into her pocket and pulled out her ministry badge, flipping it open and pushing it towards the healer. she absolutely hated having to use her name or position to get what she wanted, but she was willing to put that aside for harry’s sake.
at eight, harry stumbles down the steps clumsily, rubbing at his eyes sleepily and yawning quietly. even hungover, harry always rises early. “hey,” he murmurs as he passes draco, pausing for a moment to press a chaste kiss to draco’s forehead. he tries not to cringe away. “good morning. ‘s there any more coffee?”
,” he snorted softly as he murmured their ridiculous nickname - it had been coined years ago, and was still used in the papers each time the three were spotted together.
“you’re overthinking this, draco.” said pansy. “and I’m pretty sure that was racist, blaise.”
the colorful swears harry dropped signified that he had injured himself, draco took this as an opportunity to escape.
“it’s the hufflepuff’s you have to watch out for,” theo interjected. “they’re a bit too friendly for my liking.”
goyle stared down at the table, looking as though he’d rather be anywhere else, doing anything else.
sometimes, he’d find himself wrapped around ron and hermione, much like that very first morning. hermione would sit beside him on the couch in the mornings, offering a mug of tea and sipping in silence with him for a few minutes. her hand would find his, lacing together gently and serving as a bit of an anchor for both of them. ron would often bend over the couch, brushing draco’s hair away from his face and patting his head affectionately. he would sit at the head of the couch, and allow draco to sleep with his head in his lap - these occasions were the only time draco could truly rest, but he refused to let this slip - or ron would very well station himself on the couch with draco for at least eight hours everyday.
“so says you,” draco said to her softly, reaching out and squeezing her hand. they left the bathroom together - moving through the open door and into the bedroom, where harry was still patting himself down, obviously running a mental checklist of the wards of the house and his own personal effects, much like during his days as an auror.
“dragon,” draco said, pushing harry back onto the bed. “i’m a dragon.”
“potter says that he doesn’t want anything with me.” he says softly, looking directly at her. he watches as confusion passes over her face, and he bites back a smile. “except, he does. he always does. he's a liar.”
- earning harry a seat at the table, not only as a close friend but as a partner.
“are you sober?” harry asked, beginning to shuck off his own clothing.
“fuck, draco” harry moaned softly as draco lapped at the head of his cock, almost affectionately. he swallowed harry completely once more, running his tongue along the vein on the underside of
for a while, they don’t move. they sit in silence, with their heads still tucked into each other’s necks, chests heaving, and arms wrapped around each other.
“what is it, pans?”
he lands in hermione’s living room, stumbling as he does. he looks around - he’s been here a handful of times, but never without harry at his side, a firm grip on his waist. on the sofa, ron dozes lightly, and blinks up at draco, puzzled. he looks like he’s about to say something, likely ask draco to get out and allow him to continue his napping,
“i’m not upset, draco,” harry responded. he raises a hand to stroke draco’s cheek lightly, before retracting it. “i’m just confused. am i - are things between us not as good as i thought they were?”
the first time that potter kissed him, draco had quickly thrown up all over his shoes. he had been three or four sheets to the wind - after stupidly accepting a dare from longbottom to match finnegan shot for shot. he had stumbled to the bathroom and took a piss, and then bumped into potter on the way out. he had only glanced at potter for a second before he had lunged forward, assaulting draco with a deliciously sloppy kiss. it had lasted for a few moments, before draco pulled away and proceeded to empty the contents of his stomach onto the floor in front of potter's feet.
, and ron attempting to reason with her, until they remember that draco is in their home, sequestered away in their guest bedroom, and then a noticeable silencing charm renders the rest of their conversation inaccessible.
“So? What are you waiting for?”
“It’s really not that big a deal Ron, I don’t mind losing.”
“Oh. Erm. Well, we were talking about Diagon Alley earlier and when we might go back there, and I’ve just been thinking a lot about...the future.”
“Narcissa, I must assure you we’re doing everything in our power to locate your son,” says the other voice. Now that they’re closer there’s something familiar about it, but Draco can’t quite put a face to the deep rumble.
“Good save, by the way,” he says as he sits, grinning at her.
“Me? Or you?”
year, remember?”
Another round of laughter. People return to their own attempts.
It’s during his walk back up to the castle that he remembers why he’d been sleeping in the first place. Everybody hates him again. He wishes ‘hate’ were too strong a word for the situation, but it does feel like the most appropriate one. It’s not the kind of hate he’s used to, either.
“Agreed. That’s why this is so important. It’s like…our foundation. Or, it could be, I guess. I don’t really know what I’m talking about,” he says with a laugh.
. He made it so I didn’t have a choice, and I was never strong enough to fight him. He almost destroyed my whole life, Harry. My family is in shambles, and I have no idea who I am anymore because my worthless father was grooming me to take his place in whatever twisted world they were planning. None of the friends I had are back, and they weren’t real friends to begin with, and I’m just grasping for
Alright. So she hadn’t been told the
,” he screams, over and over. Like a child, he tries to make himself heavy as possible as the Aurors drag him away. He’s vaguely aware of McGonagall crying in the doorway, ushering a stray Ravenclaw away from the scene.
and then harry leans forward and presses their lips together,
draco’s stomach began to twist uncomfortably as he mulled over this possibility. deciding that the best course of action would be to go back home and hope that harry’s neighbors wouldn’t tell him about the mad blonde that had hung around his home for hours while he had been at work, draco stood. just as he made to turn, the front door swung open.
“i’ll do it,” harry says evenly, rubbing a gentle circle into draco’s back. “you go ahead, love. i’ll find you when i’m done.”
“i just needed a little bit, draco,” he murmurs, shaking his head. he raises an arm half-heartedly as if attempting to push draco away, but aborts the movement halfway through. his arm flops bonelessly back down at his side, and draco looks away. “just a bit to tide me over.”
draco could only hope that harry entertained himself with things that kept him busy, and safe, if not a bit tired.
“more arse kissing to do?” draco asked with a grin - harry met his eye and winked.
instead, harry is surprisingly affectionate with ginny today, brushing her hair away from her face and staring at her all night, even when she’s not looking back at him. they hold hands and she leans into his chest - they share a drink and even order a basket of chips that they pick at and feed each other. the entire thing is disgustingly performative and heterosexual, and it makes draco feel sick to his stomach.
harry stares out the window as they go, resting his chin in the palm of his hand and taking in th endless miles of grass and field that they pass. draco finds himself frequently looking over at harry, admirming the line of his jaw, the stormy look in his eyes. he’s beautiful - the most beautiful man draco has ever seen, and he’d do anything for him.
in the bed, petunia sits upright, her eyes wide with fear. beside her, vernon snores on.
he pads to the door, licking the excess chocolate from his fingers as he does. at his feet, lucy, their puppy trots beside him, always pleased with any activity that has to do with opening the door.
they stand there for a few long moments, with harry trembling in draco’s arms and draco pressing gentle kisses to his shoulder. when harry pulls away, draco nods, murmuring about finishing his job. he transfigures dudley’s body back to normal, closing the wound in his throat and vanishing all of the blood on his body and on the ground. he seems to be sleeping, aside from his deathly pallor. draco levitates him simply into the backseat of the car, not bothering to play any games with the body. once he slams the door, he moves back across the street, and harry follows closely behind him. for a moment, they simply stand in silence, staring at the car.
“it’s not long at all,” draco returns, running a hand through harry’s hair.
about to be ganged up on.
his robes had been custom-made by his favorite tailor in italy - they were a deep blue, made up of a lightweight fabric that swirled around his legs alluringly when he walked and gave off a faint impression of the midnight sky, alight with stars and constellations. the cut of the robes was flattering - accentuating his broad shoulders and lightly muscled arms and cinching at his waist, before flowing out in a wave of soft fabric. he had ordered them specifically for this event and had been properly pleased when he had gone to pick them up and been greeted with a masterpiece.
“i have to,” draco sniffs, his tears resurfacing and threatening to come faster than ever. “i can’t do this.”
and then potter laughed - a loud, barking sound that startled draco so much that he jumped and his drink sloshed over the rim of his glass, spilling over his fingers. finally, draco turned to glance at potter, and found his heart doubling in speed immediately.
“it’s because of me,” draco whispered, his tears subsiding slightly. “she kept speaking to me - even after he cast me aside… she went against his orders with every letter. god, she risked her life for me!”
“dreams can be very telling,” draco breathed, feeling his cock begin to harden in his joggers.
“draco…” he says softly, turning to look down at him. his eyes swim with worry, and draco’s breath catches. there’s love, and the desire to protect in andrew’s eyes. andrew, who draco lives with. andrew, who will only be a few feet away, should draco need him.
“you sounded like you were in distress over the phone,” pansy reasoned, smiling around at the table, “so i bought reinforcements! they’ll provide alternate, erm, perspectives. think of it as a slytherin support group.”
they end the call as harry finishes completely, jumping once more to stand away from his creation, admiring his work with his hands on his hips and a proud smile on his face.
hermione smiled as ron pulled another face, resulting in another round of raucous laughter from rosie. the sound of her daughters laugh calmed her immensely - she had been under the weather for the last few days and spent most of the time crying or sleeping as she fought off a fever. in her pocket, hermione’s mobile rang loudly, startling the infant on the examination bed. she looked over at hermione for a moment, her eyes wide and already welling with tears.
“don’t be stupid, draco,” harry says dryly, turning to wrap his arms around draco’s waist. he pulls him close, pressing their foreheads together and looking up and over into draco’s eyes. they stand like that for a long moment, their breath mingling in the space between them. the moonlight shines through their bathroom window, casting a faint glow over them. right now, in the early hours of the morning, the rest of the world is asleep - but they are wide awake, and entirely alive. harry leans forward, catching draco’s lips in a sweet, slow kiss. draco whimpers softly, already melting and losing himself in the kiss, the way that he does every single time, without exception. “i’m not letting you go alone.”
and then a triumphant grin crosses lucius’ face, and he flicks his wand at draco with hardly a whisper. draco sinks to the floor, dropping his own wand as his hands claw at his throat, gasping desperately for breath. horrified, harry steps forward and sends lucius flying backward, into a bookshelf, before binding and stunning him on the ground. he turns to draco, who is already struggling to his feet, still breathing heavily.
?” he pulls him close, partly so that he doesn’t have to look into his piercing eyes, and partly because he needs to feel harry’s warmth against him, and the gentle pound of his heartbeat against draco’s own - because he needs to be reminded that he’s alive, that harry is alive, that he hasn’t descended into some twisted version of hell, where he’s stuck reliving his fears over and over again.
“draco,” harry called at one point, “i’m leaving now,”
“mamas,” harry corrected.
“harry,” draco says brokenly, his eyes welling with tears. harry’s mood swings and sudden depression hadn’t been easy to deal with, but draco was more worried about his fiance’s well-being over his own. seeing harry, who was rountinely so strong and cheerful, seemingly crushed was jarring, and it frightened draco more than he cared to admit.
“oh, darling,” pansy said lowly, her sudden presence startling draco. she looked him up and down like a hungry cat, a warm grin spreading across her red-tinted lips. “you look ravishing.” she moved forward, pressing a gentle kiss to his cheek. her perfume - citrusy and overwhelming - flooded draco’s senses. as she moved away, he turned to take a proper glance at her and was promptly floored. she looked stunning, as per usual. she wore a long, figure-hugging dress made of a shimmery, smooth black material. hanging open around her shoulders was the signature red auror uniform - and a shiny badge at her lapel boasting the deputy head auror insignia.
him so desperately that it made his hands shake again.
“time of death,” he murmured, glancing at the clock. “6:34 pm.”
“you’re lying,” ginny says, her voice sounding all terrible and forced. draco turns back to face her - her face is contorted with anger and frustration, and her face is all red, like a cherry. her skin clashes horribly with her hair, and draco bites down the urge to laugh. “fuck you, malfoy.”
he tells draco about his first weasley family dinner since that night, about the forgiveness they’ve shown him, and about how he’s still not sure if he deserves it.
“drew,” draco says softly, touching the small of his back. he stops abruptly and sighs before turning and moving out of the way. he fixes draco with a long, hard look, and draco tips his chin up so that drew can catch him in a gentle kiss.
dead.
but now, harry is smiling up at draco as if he hung the moon and the stars with his bare hands, just for him. now, that void closes - and draco feels somewhat complete for the first time in a very long time.
it feels right. it feels like kismet… like magnetism… like magic. it feels like their entire lives have culminated into this singular moment: here, in harry’s bed, tangled together and holding each other.
“what’s wrong?” ron said, drawing himself up to his full height. “‘mione?”
draco allows harry to lead them towards the house, although he distinctly remembers the exact address from the time harry had told him about the horrid muggles, and would have been able to locate it himself. he looks around as they stroll down the sidewalk, wondering how exactly the muggles that lived here were able to distinguish their home from the others on the street. everything looked exactly the same, from the meager gardens in the front to the conservative suv’s sitting in the carparks. it made draco’s skin crawl, seeing the way these houses lined up beside each other like soldiers, indistinguishable from each other.
instead, draco stood beside the circle, with his hands trembling and his eyes watering. he didn’t want to cry - he had been crying nearly every day for three months. he had cried his way through the funeral, and the dozens of memorial services, and the tributes, and every godforsaken event he had been forced to sit through as part of his duty as grieving widower.
and draco sees red. potter’s words hit him like a ton of bricks, immediately sobering him up and sending him back in time, back to hogwarts. he wants to reach out, to wrap his fingers around potter’s throat and squeeze. he hasn’t felt this angry in years - the sort of anger that makes him want to burn down the world around him.
“bloody hell,” he whimpered, fighting the urge to crawl into bed and never come back out.
harry kisses him, and draco swears that he hears the unspoken
when his legs tire of standing, they simply give out beneath him, and draco crashes to the ground. the smooth tile presses against his cheek, and he finds comfort in it. in a strange way, it feels a bit like being held. like being caressed, with an unforgiving hand. with harry’s cold, dead hands.
“this is very unfair. you just get to lay back and relax, lazy sod.”
“i was going to wear a coat,” harry grumbled, slumping down into the couch beside draco. he crossed his arms over his chest, glaring down at the ground.
“obviously.” she scoffs. “i think i’ll treat myself to a mani-pedi today… i deserve it.”
pansy nodded absently, reaching over and squeezing his thigh comfortingly, but downed her drink in one go. “yes, of course, dear. watch my purse for me, will you?” with that, she was pulled off to the dance floor by a giggling ginny and luna. they quickly carved out a space for themselves and began to dance against each other in a strange tangle.
“yes!” draco interrupted, bursting forward and pulling harry into a kiss. “yes, yes, a thousand times, yes.”
luna gazes serenely at draco as he unbuttons his top and throws it over a chair. there’s a small smile on her face, but she allows him to keep talking. the room is just a bit colder than what would make him comfortable, but the candles and incense burning from nearly every horizontal surface and the quiet whimsical music playing soothed his nerves slightly.
draco looks up at him, probably embarrassingly pink and with wet eyes and quivering lips. harry stares back, his expression so painfully open. draco can read him like a book - whether it’s because potter is just that accessible, or because draco knows him inside and out, and better than anyone else. he thinks draco is beautiful - and draco is falling apart right now.
“i - i hadn’t seen my friends in a while,” draco stammered, his hips bucking at harry’s touch.
the looks they shared now were familiar and good, and lacking in passion but never warmth. surprising harry - whether it involved sneaking up behind him and covering his eyes, or peeling off his robes to reveal inches of lacy fabric and miles of soft skin - always made that original awe return, if only for a second. today had already been wonderful - having harry look at him like he had hung the sun for just a few moments would only be the frosting on the cake.
sick of staring out the same window, harry turned on his heel to head for draco’s study. perhaps the view would be different there. as he passed draco on the couch, he sighed loudly - and perhaps a bit petulantly.
and then draco was home, staring blankly at his empty living room and wondering where he was supposed to go from that point. he hadn’t eaten yet, and his steak and kidney pie remained on the kitchen counter beneath a hasty warming charm. there was so much of it - more than he would ever be able to eat on his own.
“h.a potter, sir,” thalia said, her cheeks flushed a light pink. “if you’d like to step out, i can finish the debriefing.”
awful… the cupboard, and -”
“enough, malfoy!” granger slams a hand on the table, her voice trembling. for the first time all night (these gryffindors are horrendously predictable), draco is somewhat surprised. hermione had been the first to insist that they all call each other by their first names, for the sake of inter-house unity or post-war cooperation or some other progressive bullshit. her eyes are damp and disbelieving, and draco doesn’t understand why. it’s not as if it’s her relationship that’s just imploded - evidenced by the shiny rock on her ring finger. the first thing weasley had done after receiving his cash prize and order of merlin was use half of it to buy granger an impressive ring. “harry,” she continues, pleading. “tell me he’s lying. tell me you didn’t.”
“fuck you!” he shouted, picking up one of the smooth stones and hurling it into a nearby clearing. he wasn’t sure who he was cursing, or why - but he knew that it felt good to destroy this singular patch of earth - so well decorated and cozy compared to the rest of the treacherous forest. draco grabbed another stone and threw it in the other direction. it fell short, landing only a few meters before him. “damn it!”
the first time they fucked, potter had shown up to his house in the middle of the night, his eyes shining familiarly and his grin wicked. draco had hardly opened the door before potter was pushing in, his fingers fumbling for draco’s waist and his lips hungrily devouring draco’s own.
“no, here.” draco answered, “wanna ride you now.”
with that, draco spun on his heel and marched up the stairs, still grumbling to himself. the gesture was supposed to be intimidating, harry was sure, but it lost a bit of it’s fire, seeing as draco was wearing bright green bottoms decorated with snitches, bunny slippers, and a faded weasley sweater.
the night that everything falls apart starts like any other - except today, ginny weasley is on harry's arm. draco takes a seat across from potter instead of beside him, nursing a pint and talking absently to pansy about his week. harry doesn’t catch his eye, like he normally does, to cock his eyebrow and smirk or run his tongue over his bottom lip - his way of saying yes i remember last week, no you didn’t hallucinate it, yes i can’t wait to do it again.
draco stared over at him blankly, his mouth slightly open. as the moment grew longer, harry began to fidget in his seat. the only sound that could be heard throughout the entire house was the faint ticking of the wall clock.
“want a peppermint?”
and then pockets her wand when their home is declared safe. the ensuing transition from stoic deputy head auror to a friend is instantaneous - pansy pulls off her robes, once again displaying her gorgeous gown, and kicks off her strappy heels before sweeping from the sitting room and into the kitchen. they find her sat on one of the stools, sipping from a glass of wine and gesturing with one finger to the two identical glasses sat on the other side of the island.
but he can’t do any of these things, because he can’t move. he stands stock still while lucy sniffs at his feet and pants excitedly at the new stranger, while andrew appears behind him, wrapping a familiar arm around his waist.
but today, draco had gone before a review board, and finally been approved to begin his first round of experimental trials. he had immediately shut down his lab for the day and rushed home, eager to finally share the secret he had been keeping for months now.
“bullshit,” harry spat, “you saw pansy last week,”
“call me harry,” potter said, kindly and warmly and terribly. “and you’re welcome, draco.”
“thank you for your contribution, councilman mylincar.” draco said politely, smiling diplomatically and standing. “köszönöm, grazie, mulțumesc, gracias, y obrigado” he shook the hand of each of the consults individually, thanking them in their respective languages, before gesturing to his assistant to follow behind him as they made their exit.
and then she invited him to her home in france for a week.
“he is gone, but only from this realm. harry potter lives on forever with all those who were lost before him.” the centaur says quietly. the image of harry, dressed in white and walking with an easy grace, surrounded by all of those he had loved and lost appeared in draco’s mind. his parents, sirius, remus, tonks, dumbledore, and even snape - welcoming him into the afterlife, or the second realm, or wherever it was that spirits went, filled draco with a strange warmth. “you will heal, draco malfoy,”
“you don’t have to worry about getting back to me, because i’m going to shut this line off.” draco starts, his voice already thick with emotion. he takes a shaky breath and pauses for a moment, blinking back the tears that are already welling in his eyes. “i’ve tried to distance myself from everything, so that i can come to terms with it and all that. 3,459 miles of distance to be exact.
“i mean…” harry starts, but is quickly interrupted by draco, who licks a long stripe up harry’s neck, ending at his jaw. there, he places a gentle kiss, his teeth grazing against the skin of harry’s cheek. “oh,” he ends softly, feeling his resolve deflate.
had also let harry die
they found lucius in his study, nursing a snifter of some dark liquid and looking generally malevolent. he seemed to have been expecting them, based on the lazy way he cocked an eyebrow and looked up at them through his eyelashes .
harry stares up at him, shaking his head slowly. “if,” he begins, his brow furrowing. “if you loved me -”
“the sex rule-maker!” goyle burst, looking proud of himself. when silence followed, he grumbled. “it was funny,”
“i - i don’t know, i’ll check.” with one hand, draco began to fumble with the thong wrapped around the foot of the bird, and absently fed it a strip of bacon with the other.
but harry didn’t respond.
draco didn’t know what that was, or why he was in it, but he was suddenly very concerned with destroying it as soon as possible. however, did it even matter anymore? harry had already found him. when he doesn’t say anything for a while, harry continues speaking.
“time.”
“lucius,” harry murmured, simply because he didn’t know what else to say. “why wouldn’t he say anything - god, draco, i’m sorry, baby. i’m so sorry.”
in response, draco screamed something back at him that sounded a bit like rapid fire french, and slammed their bedroom door.
“oh?” draco cocks an eyebrow and purses his lips. “why not?”
all eyes are on them, and all conversation has quieted significantly. there hasn’t been a malfoy-potter showdown in years, but one is very obviously brewing in this pub tonight. their friends pay rapt attention - looking between harry and draco as if observing a tennis match.
draco had read a book by dostoevsky at some point during the war - when he hadn't been trembling in fear in the dining room, he had spent a fair amount of time curled in his bed, slowly making his way through piles of old books that he had pilfered from the manor library. the brothers karamasov had been, by far, one of his favorites - he had filled the book with annotations and highlights over all of his favorite quotes, and to this day, still had the same copy in his study at home, tucked away but never forgotten. there had been a particular quote that had stuck with him for weeks after reading it - a paragraph on the difference between active love and the love of dreams. active love, according to fyodor (as draco liked to call him in his head. privately, he liked to think of fyodor as a friend - even if he was a long-dead muggle russian writer.), was a labor and something all-encompassing, incorrigible, and almost harsh in nature. love in the dreams was whimsical and gentle, and tender - it was a mother’s hand on a bassinet, gently rocking her baby to sleep. when draco sees harry - sees the scars that litter his body, the grey streaking his thick hair, the determination in his eyes after a long day of arguing or campaigning for some cause or the other. he thinks about harry’s hand against his cheek, always gentle, of the soft, playful smile on his lips when he listens to teddy’s long-winded stories about his days at hogwarts and his adventures with the other hufflepuffs, of his eyes, striking and familiar but never unkind - and he marvels at the walking paradox that is harry potter. no man, especially not one that had been through so much at such a young age, should have the capacity to hold that much love - to have been wronged so many times by the world yet still wake every morning with the passion to save it. but harry does. he cares deeply, limitlessly, for everyone he comes into contact with, and has been hurt time and time again by those tasked with the easiest thing of all - loving him, and caring for him. yet, he remains soft and open, and able to love.
“draco,” hermione said as a greeting, only glancing up slightly. “it’s nice to see you. and you too, jackson.”
“malfoy,” ron choked as he got closer. hermione looked up, her eyes bloodshot and her hair disheveled.
“draco, darling,” she murmured after a long while. draco was leaning into her side heavily, although his sobs had quieted to gentle sniffles punctuated with hearty swigs. “what’s wrong?”
draco’s fingers brushed something at the very bottom of his pocket - and he froze. the rest of the world turned to a vacuum - and suddenly, all he could hear and feel was the brush of his fingers against crinkling plastic, deep in his robe pocket. before he could stop himself, he grabbed at the plastic with his thumb and forefinger, slowly dragging out what he knew he would find.
he thinks about andrew - with his dark skin and crooked smile and gentle voice and large hands, about the way that draco can still hear him pacing the kitchen right now, shaking with anger. he’s always been this way about draco - protective, and willing to go to bat for him. andrew is kind, and loving, and smart, and accepting. he loves draco, wholeheartedly, even on the days when he is impossible to love. andrew looks over at him when he’s at his worst, and smiles and says
granger and weasley, although kind, were still very obviously torn about harry. draco had often felt weasley staring at him when he wasn’t looking, his eyebrows furrowed and eyes dark, as if blaming draco for turning his best friend into an abusive prick. granger often mentioned harry’s name before squeaking softly and looking away, blinking rapidly as tears flooded her eyes. neither had ever voiced their thoughts on the matter, but draco didn’t blame them.
when draco enters, he finds that harry is not in the kitchen. their cat curls on the windowsill, lazily grooming herself and basking in the slowly setting afternoon sun. she opens one eye as draco approaches, her tail flicking half heartedly in his direction.
“he would love it, too,” luna says softly, coming to stand beside him in the mirror. she smiles serenely, her eyes twinkling as if she knows something that draco doesn’t.
the rest of their friends disappear in similar fashions, making whispered excuses about why they suddenly need to be anywhere but this table right now. draco doesn’t pay much attention to them - instead, focusing on finishing as many drinks as he can. his options are essentially limitless - they had ordered a new round just a few moments before draco had decided to ruin everyone’s night. as he drinks, potter stares at him. there’s no emotion on his face - not anger, or hurt, or frustration. he's blank, annoyingly so, and shows no awareness of the fact that his fiance and best friends have just both walked away from him, metaphorically and physically.
when ron and hermione stepped through the floo for tuesday night dinner, they promptly dropped to their knees and covered their heads. clothing, furniture, and other objects flew around the room in all directions, organizing themselves in random piles. in the middle of the chaos stood draco malfoy, pink cheeked and frantically flicking his wand back and forth.
first, one of pansy’s subordinates goes through the floo - she has a kind face and rosy cheeks, but is surprisingly quick with her wand, and is adept in hand-to-hand, muggle-based combat. draco had gotten the pleasure of watching her take down a random wizard who had run at harry a few years prior - it had been hilarious watching her push the burly stranger to the ground and stand on his back without losing her signature smile. draco goes behind her, his robes flying around him entrancingly, and a secret smile on his face as he made eye contact with harry before disappearing in a flash of green flame. the two remaining junior aurors go next, one right after the other - leaving only harry and pansy.
“to have sex,” pansy snorts.
“i’m…. i don’t know,” draco replied quietly, biting into a potato.
potter takes a few more sips, looking around at draco’s home and nodding pleasantly and tapping his foot. he looks at peace, and natural, and (although draco’s loathe to admit it) at home in draco’s small cottage, surrounding by all of his things. and then potter starts talking, and everything goes terribly wrong.
with a deep breath, draco launched into an explanation of his dream, without preamble. harry listened stoically, his brow furrowing as draco recounted the tale. when draco mentioned simon, harry’s mouth opens in protest - although one look at draco’s resigned expression causes him to go silent again.
“so you’re a bloody fairy as well! always knew something wasn’t right about you, you
“our healers had been unable to detect a pulse, but they’re attempting to revive him now. we were paged to make sure that there are enough healers on hand in case something goes wrong.”
“what?”
“he killed her,” draco spat, inhaling shakily. “i know he did.”
harry murmurs something in response, but draco had already fallen asleep. he dresses quickly and silently and slips from the room with one final glance at draco’s sleeping form.
“thank you, darling,” draco says with a quiet smile. he peels off his own outer robes and drops them to the floor, where they will inevitably form wrinkles, about which draco will inevitably complain tomorrow morning. harry will inevitably laugh about it and cast an ironing charm, and they’ll repeat the same routine again the next night. “you’re lucky you married me and i don’t need constant wooing. otherwise, you’d be in a world of trouble, minister.” he presses his palm to harry’s cheek. “i love you, too.” harry relaxes into his touch, and his eyes flutter shut once more. even in the dim lighting, draco can see the exhaustion, the stress, and the toll that it’s begun to take on his husband. he stares hard at the lines on his forehead and around his eyes, at the barest hints of grey at his temple. “just think,” draco whispers, stroking his thumb across harry’s soft skin. “just four more years, and then the cottage.”
draco stares out the window all the while, his tea growing cold before him. he listens avidly, although he won’t look at harry and let it show. privately, he loves this - loves hearing about harry’s life, about what he’s been doing over the last two years. before everything had fallen apart, they had often had conversations like these. after sex, they would lie in bed, still tangled together, and harry would talk. even if there was nothing to say, he would ramble on about his life, about who he had seen and what he had done in the time since he had seen draco last. he had never expected draco to respond - just to listen quietly until they drifted asleep, or until it was time for draco to disappear through the floo.
“no,” he had muttered, pushing harry away from him as they stood in the dark of the pub. “i will not be your mistress.”
on one of the many occasions that they had lain face to face, almost touching - but not quite post-coitus, harry had whispered something to draco.
when draco returned from his reverie, the sky had grown almost completely dark.
“draco?” harry called as he shouldered open the front door. beneath his jacket, the puppy squirmed excitedly. lowering his voice, harry addressed the dog. “just another second, buddy.”
draco envied harry of the way that he wasn’t selfish or shy with his love. he both told and showed draco constantly how much he loved him, and also made sure that their kids knew how much they were adored and treasured. it extended past their immediate family as well - harry didn’t hesitate to pull hermione into his arms and press a kiss to the top of her head whenever they saw each other, nor to clap ron on the back or ruffle his hair.
harry can already see what it has been doing to draco - the way guilt and frustration hang over him daily. watching his mother waste away in real time while being unable to do anything to save her was slowly killing him. he blamed himself, harry knew, for not recognizing the symptoms earlier, and for having not pushed harden when his mother had declined his offers to get her the best treatment possible. he had been more than willing to sacrifice everything to save her - offering to quit his job to stay home with her, or pay for transportation to top mind healers all around the world, ranging from an ancient wizarding village somewhere in malawi to a specialist in middle america. when she had still been mostly the same, narcissa had declined all treatment, instead asking that draco continue acting as if nothing was wrong, and to only come and see her once a week, the way they always had. now, draco was almost always sullen and quiet. he would duck away to the bathroom and return with swollen eyes, or come home from the manor itching for a fight or for harry to be aggressive and have his way with him.
“are you ready to go?”
“for leaving, i mean. i can’t say that i understand why - i wish you would’ve felt like you could’ve talked to me. or anyone, really. but it’s okay. and i also wanted to say that i’m sorry. for so long, i - i felt like i failed you. you were hurting, and i didn’t do anything to help you… if there was something i could’ve done… i would’ve done it harry, i promise. i would’ve done anything just to have you here with me again. i’m sorry, baby. i love you. i really, really love you. so much. but i have to let you go now, because it’s killing me. but i think that i’ll be okay. i’m finally starting to feel like myself again. it was a bit touch and go last year. especially for the first few months… but you know how it is. or, maybe you don’t.
at that moment, hermione returns to the table, her arms laden with different cocktails. as she sets them down in front of their owners, she looks around.
“but uh - right now i’m sitting on my balcony. briseis is out here with me. it’s a little chilly, but i don’t mind. i’m having a glass of wine and smoking a bit. it’s quite beautiful here. i think you would’ve loved new york. there’s so many people here - it never really slows down. i know how much you hated having all of the attention on you. we could’ve just disappeared here. it would’ve been perfect for you. for us.
when harry doesn’t answer, draco sinks to floor on the steps, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. for a while, although draco isn’t sure if it’s five minutes or five hours, he stares blankly at the park across the street from harry’s house, his mind racing.
“this is getting a bit long now... suppose i should wrap it up. so, i guess this is goodbye. for now. i’ll see you on the otherside, yeah? save a seat for me, love. bye, now.”
“i’m sure you do,” draco says, quiet and bashful. he’s already slowly returning to his snarky self - the idea makes harry laugh to himself. draco crawls away, grabbing for the rest of his clothes and throwing harry his own. they dress quickly and silently, before returning to the couch. the scent of sex lingers over them, but they both ignore it as draco pulls the blanket over the both of their bodies. he returns to his former position, with his head on harry’s shoulder and their fingers laced together.
“so you think i’m cheating on you?” harry asked quietly, after a moment. he stared blankly ahead towards the floor, his eyes unseeing.
harry scoffed as he entered the living room, taking in the sight. even without his glasses - he could clearly see what was happening. draco was lying on the couch, with achilles sat on his chest. after only a year, the dog had grown rapidly and was now nearly 40 kgs, in comparison to the 3 kg he had been when harry had first bought him home. however, none of this seemed to matter to draco, who grinned up at the dog as if he was weightless.
“right,” he says, nodding stiffly. “i suppose that’s about right, then.” draco wants to get up in arms, to shout in harry’s face about how draco doesn’t need his approval before getting into another relationship, and that six long years of feeling unlovable is long enough of a punishment, that he deserves real, true love, finally. he wants to rage at harry, now that he’s able to. he could scream in his face, could probably even reach forward and slap him - andrew is just a few feet away and he might actually stab harry if he dares to lay a finger on draco. but, before draco can get a word in, harry continues. “draco, i’m sorry. there’s no excuse for what i did to you… what i put you through. i was so fucked up, and i took it out on you… it wasn’t right. but i’ve gone to therapy, gotten help. i’ve changed now.”
my body. letting a man tell me what to do with my appearance based on his personal tastes would be very anti-feminist of me, wouldn’t you say so?”
“you go, draco,” luna whispers, shaking his hand in hers and stroking his hair. “go on. let the blinking flutterfleas guide you to the other side.”
lucius, as expected, doesn’t struggle when harry presses the pillow over his face.
“draco?” hermione says, her voice ragged.
“tomorrow,” he choked, his nails digging painfully into harry’s arms as he leaned heavily into him, staggering under the weight of his own grief. “tomorrow, we’ll go.”
as he passes the couch, draco pulls off his glasses and catches harry’s eye, fixing him with a glare so deadly that he stops in his tracks.
the tears come for what feels like hours, forcing themselves out with each hulking gasp draco takes. a part of draco feels as if he’s dying, as if he’ll hyperventilate and keel over from the force of it. the grief settles around him like a heavy cloak - weighing his body down and making doing anything other than letting it swallow him completely feel impossible. the embarrassment he knows he should feel evades him - giving the illusion that all sense of normalcy and decorum had left draco’s life along with harry.
“fuck,” draco chokes, pressing his palms to his eyes in an attempt to stop the flow of tears. instead, they come harder than ever - the grief pulling at him until he’s bending in two with the force of it, clutching himself as he cries his eyes out, right in the middle of diagon alley. pansy rubs his back gently, tutting affectionately and saying quietly, again and again,
when they’re both finally clean, harry collapses into the bed beside draco once more, pulling him into his arms. draco laces his fingers with harry’s, squeezing gently. for a long moment, there’s silence.
“well,” draco thought about how he had fallen asleep in harry’s arms the night before, of how harry sometimes floo’ed home during his lunch to spend it with draco, of how he had taken draco to italy for a weekend last month at the spur of the moment, and proceeded to fuck his brains out over the balcony, all the while showering draco with praise and adoration. “no. but maybe i’m a Seer.”
harry stared at him, hard. for a moment, draco thinks that this it. he’ll realize that this is more trouble than it’s worth, and pack his bags and leave draco alone in their big, quiet house. he doesn’t. instead, he sighed, before shaking his head and turning on his heel, disappearing up the stairs and slamming the bedroom door shut behind him.
Draco opens his mouth to say something, then closes it. “Thank you?”
“Correct. Do you have any career aspirations yet? Because I would like to recommend the healing profession.”
“But if it does come up, it makes everything so much harder. You can’t vouch for me if they discover you’ve been to see my mother.”
Please don’t get too down on yourself for the Patronus business. People will forget about it as soon as something else interesting happens. Are Quidditch practices open to the public? I’d love to come and watch how it all goes down, especially because you have two Beauxbatons students on your team, including my friend Bella. If not, maybe you could sneak me in! (I’m only about 30% joking about that).
“Go right ahead, dearie.”
“Oh, I will. As soon as your friend here agrees to my terms.”
“Literally don’t mention it.”
“No. I’d like you to be Leon’s.”
“Actually,” Harry says, “he did. He was grateful to be alive at all, which definitely softened the blow.”
“I do,” Harry says with a dopey grin. “I really do. I’m just making sure you know what you’re getting into. As much as I’ve tried to reach some kind of normal, it’s become pretty clear to me that normal is not in the cards for me.”
“Yeah. I am.”
Draco swallows down a scream and grabs Harry’s shoulders. “
He opens his mouth to respond, then closes it. He then points at Harry. “You really think anybody would turn him down a job?”
“Of course, just checking. My point is, this year Quidditch is wildly different but we still manage to get teamed up anyway, and I don’t want anything to come between us and that fucking winner’s seat, alright? Just, you know, full disclosure and all that. And now that you’ve confirmed that you’re definitely over us and all of that…it helps. It does. So thanks, I guess.”
“Starting point for what?”
“Same to you!”
Beauxbatons, aside from Denise’s team, which is missing a Slytherin. The balancing out of skill and age is also pretty well done. Harry is suddenly eager to find out when the first match is. He imagines it’ll have to be soon if the league is to be done by the end of the term.
A few other people come into the corridor as she works, and in under a minute there’s a glint in her eye and a wave of her wand. The vines freeze, then shudder and retract back into the wall.
Harry shrugs and sits down at the table. He reaches for the plate but Draco smacks his hand away. “I’ve only made enough for me.”
“I’d imagine so. And if you ever want to talk about something and work it through, I’d be more than willing to listen.”
Draco sighs and takes a sip of his tea. It’s hot but refreshing, burns his throat going down. “I think you’re right.”
—has him reeling a bit.
They look at each other.
“Really, though,” Draco says, the energy in the room shifting slightly. “Have we gone absolutely mad? Is this really a good time to…I don’t know, start something like this?
Draco almost chokes on a piece of dinner roll. Blaise gives him a lackluster pat on the back as Draco coughs the bread out of his system.
“And what might those interests be?” Leon asks, still playing indignant.
“But it might ruin everything.”
“The first kiss felt like a hello. The second one felt like goodbye.”
He must have slept through the night; he blinks even as mild sun sneaks in through curtains. He turns over. Harry is back in his own bed—Hermione and Ron are sitting with their backs to Draco. Hermione leans with her elbows on the comforter. Ron sits back, nodding fervently at something Harry says.
“The Cannons!”
“Am I in trouble?” he asks immediately as he deposits his cup and plate back onto the desk, not hungry anymore.
“And Mum didn’t throttle you?”
Ignoring his own tears, Harry slams a fist down on McGonagall’s desk. “Because he
Draco gestures to Ron with a flip of his hand. “Exactly. I know we’re not enemies anymore, but Ron and I aren’t exactly best mates. I don’t want to make things worse by being there.”
“Are you actually taking his side right now?”
The Hall erupts into madness, shrieks and bodies and every student running to the opposite end of the chamber. Hermione tries to pull Harry along but he’s disoriented, a strange, high-pitched whine in his head, everything tilting. Her hand is suddenly gone from Harry’s arm; someone else has dragged her away, he thinks she’s screaming his name but it’s impossible to tell over the cacophony. Still, Dementors are swooping in through the main entrance, dozens of them, and the first one has reached Harry, a rattle from beneath its hood.
With unsteady hands, Draco draws his wand and tries to force the vines to release their grasp. He doesn’t know the right spells to undo whatever this is, and if he does anything more he’ll only hurt her in the process.
“Oh, well… We were planning to go to Diagon Alley and just walk around for a bit,” Hermione says, extracting Harry’s Invisibility Cloak from one of her pockets.
“I won’t apologize for—”
an accident.”
It hurts. It feels like he’s ingested a poison to test it, and he knows the antidote is standing three feet from him but he can’t reach out and drink it. Before he can say anything else, Harry exhales sharply and whips around to return to his friends. Draco now sees that Ron and Hermione are with Leon, all of them looking shellshocked.
think he just did it because...because he could,” he says, his voice heavy.
“That’s quite alright! I’m glad I caught you, I was actually about to head out for the day.”
Draco wants to sink into his bed and go somewhere else,
happiness?
“This is still a quiet space!”
He’s stunned. Draco has always known Hermione to be intelligent, but this level of emotional depth—especially showing it to
He stares at her for a second, then sticks his hand out. She gives it a weird look.
have to apologize for? Harry was the one who initiated this in the first place. “I got a little carried away. It’s just. You know. We’re in your private bedroom where nobody will accidentally walk in on us, and I suppose that got me too excited.”
about you. I didn’t believe them for myself. I’m still not sure I do. You must understand that. But…I don’t know. You do seem vastly different from the person you used to be. At least on the surface.”
Draco looks at Harry, the color back in his skin, his mouth slightly open in his slumber. A stray splash of moonlight spills in through an arched window and stains his raven hair, droplets of silver scattered across Harry’s chest, rising and falling rhythmically. Harry, his key, the raft that rushed him off the desolate island inside himself he fled to.
“Fine,” Harry says with a shrug. “Anyway, she’s a really excellent Beater. And it’s good that we have her to be a language bridge for Eva, too. I didn’t realize until today that she isn’t fully fluent in English.”
He comes to the staircases in the midst of motion, eyes scanning the maze above him for the boy. Draco scowls when he doesn’t find him and concedes, not sure what his purpose was in following him in the first place. It’s with a mild itch at the back of his mind that he instead treks to his own room, dreading whatever blasted riddle he’ll have to answer simply to enter the common room. He’d asked the Ravenclaw Prefects if perhaps that specific bar might be lifted for the Slytherins, which was met with a question of his intellectual capability. Any outward complaining from Draco has since ceased.
“Oh, come on. You’re not fooling anybody. Of course you’re doing it.”
Draco swallows a sigh as all conversation screeches to a silence. Might as well hang up a banner that says “No, we certainly weren’t talking about you.”
Harry approaches Draco, who’s rather patiently listening to one of his Beaters. Harry is shocked to see that he’s incredibly young—he’s a Hufflepuff, no older than second or third year.
too, if you want to get anywhere. Don’t be so hard on yourself, okay?”
“As for practice times, we’ll keep things regular and do it this time every week. If something recurring comes up, let me know and we can try to get it switched. We’ll probably do an extra practice on weeks before we have games as well. Are there any questions?”
“Oh, I know exactly how to find it.” Draco takes Harry’s hand and sets off into the maze, objects familiar and brand new alike flashing in his vision.
somewhere?”
Harry nods, looking unsurprised, but not patronizing. “It’s better than some, I’ll say that.”
“So we’re pretty much covered in terms of knowledge, wouldn’t you say?”
They both wince at that, because, well…yes.
Harry picks up the trunk of Quidditch balls and is about to return it when he hears Leon’s voice behind him.
“Because I know exactly how you feel. Like the whole world already has its mind made up about you. Like there’s no way you could ever change, because people would think it’s an act, or that you’re up to something. Or that people simply wouldn’t believe you. You feel trapped. Like the past still has its claws in you. Is that right?” He could go on. Maybe he should. But the point’s been made.
McGonagall stands, he chair scraping against the floor. “Where are you going?”
Draco makes his return to the Great Hall feeling proud of himself. His own feelings of absolute isolation are still not far into the past, and hearing Pansy struggle with the same nearly tore his heart out. To think that he was able to provide any help for her at all puts an added bounce in his step.
A stone of dread sinks into his stomach.
“Oh. Right, of course.”
“You’re awake,” she whispers as she closes the door behind her and glances at Draco.
That may be true, but Harry has never needed him more. Leon is a poison, one Harry thinks himself immune to. Their proximity has him fooled, but Draco sees the boy for what he truly is.
“Harry and I are…how do I put this?” he says with a nervous laugh. “We’re together.”
It feels rather personal, but then Draco remembers that Harry is on a first-name basis with the headmistress. And he remembers Harry, and his stomach twists, so he answers the question anyway.
Then: “What were you saying about talent, Potter?” Draco says as he zips past. Harry snaps out of his stupor and tries to relocate the Snitch. He sees that Draco has started to dive for it and chases after, pushing himself and his broom to the limit, the roar of rushing wind in his ears.
“When you describe it as ‘saving the world’ it really evokes someone gallant and majestic, and that’s just not me.”
“Harry, would you like to dance?” Luna asks almost as soon as they’ve sat.
“Do you really think anybody wants to be in this bloody House after we basically left everyone else to fight the Dark Lord without us? They’re not just going to forgive and forget, I’ll tell you that.”
The song stops and Harry watches couples all around them kiss, pull each other in. Others who are there with friends clap and cheer, urging the band to go back to something uptempo.
Wow, I really decided to write another small fic in the end notes, huh? As always, hope y'all enjoy, and thank you for dealing with me even when I am inconsistent or messy hehehe :) <333
“I’ve seen the things you can do with a cauldron, and I believe you’d make an excellent medical researcher. You have the patience, the technicality, the natural inclination. Oh, yes, yes, that would be a fine profession for you. Wish I’d thought of it myself.”
, and what can Draco do but be his son? No matter what he does, the association is there: their hair, their faces, their eyes. That particular, Malfonic way they enunciate when they speak. All things directly programmed into Draco by Lucius himself. Is there any way to separate himself from the bastard, especially given his blind loyalty to him in the past? He aches for an end of the scared glances and stilted conversations with professors and peers. He’s tired,
He scratches his head, trying not to crack a smile. “Er, right, then,” he says, handing his sheet to her. “I’ll see you,” he says, fighting the urge to ask what a “Rollitocker” is as he makes his way down the center of the hall, suddenly aware that there are dozens of pairs of eyes on him.
“Well, that’s adorable,” Ron says as he starts to serve himself. Hermione swats his arm and he cries out in protest. “I wasn’t trying to take the piss, I meant that!”
“Right, quite the mess, isn’t it?” Slughorn is saying as he pours Draco a steaming cup of green tea. “I don’t believe a word of it, of course. That man wouldn’t be caught dead around Hogwarts, nor would he be stupid enough to have communication going in or coming out. No, this is a nasty injustice, Mister Malfoy.”
“I know, it’s entirely out of the ordinary.”
. Harry’s stomach turns, thankful that Draco won’t be able to see it.
Draco hadn’t told anyone what his plans were for this morning. First of all, is that anybody’s business anyway? But second of all, he can’t help but feel a deep-rooted sense of shame about going to talk to some wishy-washy therapist bloke about his damn feelings. The only reason he’s even standing outside a classroom in a typically unused wing of the third floor is because he’s sure McGonagall would find out if he didn’t show up. McGonagall is maybe the last woman Draco would want to cross these days.
“Because you’re straight.”
Draco throws his fork down, groaning. “I swear to Merlin, if one more bloody person brings this up. I don’t really care that Potter’s a professor now! Good for him!”
“You do
“I know, but I thought we’d worked through it.”
. I feel more myself now than I ever did.”
Harry stands, again glancing in the direction of the exit. No sign of Leon. He huffs and attempts to reorient himself. He has Charms first with Ron and Hermione, which will be a good place to decompress and not have to think too hard. He can’t imagine Flitwick will have them doing anything difficult for the first class session.
Leon sighs. “I know you are, Harry. I’ve already told you that I’ve forgiven you.”
A stunned silence falls as her words sink in. Harry adjusts himself in his seat and Draco frowns down into the dregs of his tea.
“We think the battle last year really did her in,” says another—Anthony, maybe?
“I just…don’t know how I can ever make this up to you. I already felt like I had to jump through hoops just to say that I’m sorry about my entire past, and then you add this on top, and—”
Draco scoffs. “For someone so clever, you can be quite thick.”
Ginny glares at him and he wonders if she has her wand on her. He’s left his in his room, so if she really flies off the handle…
can come out of it? Why should I turn away from that possibility?”
He’s surprised to find that there isn’t a house-elf employed. Though his mother never did love the creatures, he finds it odd that she doesn’t have any help keeping up with the manor.
“Do you know where my parents are, Draco?”
“It’s going to sound crazy, but you have to believe me.”
“Oh yes, you’re as strange as they come!”
Harry grins. “Thanks. Er.
“Sounds like a plan,” Harry says and they walk back to the table together.
Harry elbows Draco in the ribs; he rolls his eyes in response. Nothing about this is
Leon pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket. “It says here my room is the second from the top. Is that a good one?”
“I. Don’t. Know. Just get me out,” Draco says, shocked that his words come out even, if desperate.
and hops to his feet, all smiles. “Harry! So good too see you,” he says and crosses the tiny kitchen, throwing his arms around Harry’s shoulders. Harry returns the embrace as Bill thumps him on the back, then pulls away. “You doing all right?”
“I don’t know. Obviously people will think that it’s our fault for not alerting the Ministry about his disappearance. They’ll think we’re singularly complacent in it. But the Ministry also neglected to notify the public when he didn’t show for his trial. Then they came round and questioned us about it and once they were sure we had nothing to do with it, they were on their way. We had some sort of unspoken agreement not to speak about it, mostly for my mother’s safety I suppose. And my own. But of course a third party had to come in and fuck us all over anyway.”
In the distance beyond the blockade, the sound of trickling water cuts through the silence that is only marred by the occasional cry from a painted victim.
“Some people live perfectly happy lives without ever finding a romantic partner.”
. Thoughts? You’ve always been rather skilled at potions, no?”
She smiles, wiping her eyes on her sleeve. “I think I might like this new Draco.”
“He did?”
He’s laying on his back in bed, and while the sheets are the familiar, scratchy ones from the beds in the Hospital Wing, Draco is confused to find himself in a smaller room, completely by himself.
Draco blinks. “You mean, right now? Just go for it?”
“How can we be sure we’ll end up in the same place?” Ron asks, still grumpy from the revelation that the blood magic was kept from him.
“I know. We agreed that we would keep things quiet until we were ready. Until you’re ready,” Leon corrects. Harry tries to push away the guilt that blooms when he hears the frustration in Leon’s voice.
“And you’re ready to go?” Harry says, trying not to sound as nervous as he feels.
In fact, he finds himself sitting on the couch, his vision swimming. Tears hit the floor and disappear, sinking right into the rug beneath him. He hears a faint tinkling noise, like wind chimes, as if the house is acknowledging his presence.
Harry looks her in the eye again. “You. And Ron. You were both…”
thinks, too. All of the places he wouldn’t let himself go before, he approaches and asks
Ginny raises an eyebrow but says nothing.
Molly tuts from the stove. “I’m
Harry rushes back over to his friends, who spare Draco a parting glance of confusion before being dragged away. Draco can do nothing but watch as they get smaller and smaller; it might be a trick of the distance, but Draco swears he can see Harry and Leon brushing their fingers together as they walk, and suddenly all of the progress he’s made has been snatched away by clawed hands.
“Are you sure you want the whole story?”
“Not a very good one, I guess.” Draco rolls his eyes as he turns, and then almost bites off the tip of his tongue. He’s been rather focused on the emotional aspect of this connection, honestly. Not that he hasn’t noticed how attractive Harry is. Of course he has. At his core, he’s a hormonal teenager like any other. But seeing Harry without a shirt is like an awakening. He’s thin but solid, tanned skin stretched over the vague shapes of muscles. Something about it makes Draco sad; it’s like looking at a malnourished animal that’s been nursed back to health. He doesn’t know what gives it away, but Harry’s skin looks so fragile, clings so tight to him.
Draco’s heart trips up a bit. She was trying to compliment Potter, and he completely brushed it off. Not exactly behavior of someone with an oversized ego.
Harry shakes his head. “She seems pretty serious about this rule. She'll tell me that I should be trying to follow it and set a good example. Head Boy, remember?”
They move through the living room and into the kitchen. Like the rest of the house, it’s quaint, lived-in. Draco can practically smell the aroma of food heating up on the range, spice and laughter peppered in.
“Fine. Yes. Teach me, master.”
“I really don’t know what this is about, but—”
Draco huffs a laugh through his nose, shaky with nerves. “While we’re admitting things, I suppose I have one of my own. My Patronus…I was only able to summon it because I thought of you.”
“Long as they’ll let us,” Ron says. “Once we hit the Burrow, chaos is unavoidable. Might be good to give Ginny some time to rest, too, before Mum is losing her mind over having us back.”
Hermione laughs through her nose. “You don’t always
“I want to ask you about Healing.”
The seven players are standing in a loose circle in the middle of the pitch, a nervous energy hanging in the air. Despite apparently not being close, the two Beauxbatons girls have grouped off. Ginny is standing with Harry, but everybody else is an island.
Harry
Ron groans. “Just the idea of someone walking around the halls with that damn mark on his arm…”
“No visitors right now. She’s in a lot of pain.”
“Harry?”
“How long has he been up?” she asks, an almost conspiratorial note in her voice.
Draco smiles into the kiss. “I didn’t realize how much taller than you I am.”
In a no-odds stroke of luck, the common room is almost completely vacant. Harry and Leon sit on one couch with Luna and Ginny on the other, a fire crackling jovially beside to them.
think that should stop you from trying. If you really do have feelings for him, it might be worth exploring.”
“What I’m getting at is that he might want to know
Tension hangs in the room as he glances back and forth between the sides of the room.
“I…have a lot to think about, I suppose.”
I know you just left today, but for some reason I’ve just had this urge to talk to you. I suppose that’s why I’m awake at 2 in the morning writing to you. It feels like there’s so much more that still needs to be said. Funny, because I have no idea what that is. Sorry again, first of all, I suppose. I don’t know if I’ll ever stop saying sorry for the way I treated you. There’s no excuse for how I acted, especially when you were nothing but kind. In any case, I hope things are well at home and that your family can be at peace for a while. For forever, really. I wish that for you. Peace forever. You’ve been through too much for anything else.
“I…what did you just say?”
“But I don’t want that. I can’t be there and know you’re off in the shadows somewhere, it’s just…wrong. I know the circumstances are unprecedented and things are happening rather quickly, but I really do think she’ll be pleased that you’re there. She’ll
“Alright,” Harry says, barely a whisper. He throws Draco’s bag over his shoulder. “May I?” he asks, pointing to Draco’s arm. He understands and allows Harry to drape his arm around his shoulders, guiding Draco out of the room and into the fray of Hogwarts.
about it?”
“I’m serious. Reading anything interesting?”
“All I saw was you,” he says to the room, to Draco. “My eyes were closed but all I saw was you. But it’s really you, now.” He takes Draco’s hand, grabs pointer and middle finger, and guides them to his eyes. Draco’s breath catches in his throat as Harry uses the pads of Draco’s fingers to slide his eyelids shut. He then brings the hand to his own chest, where Draco can feel his heart, strong and steady. “All I see is you,” Harry whispers. “All I see is you.”
The anger in Leon’s eyes melts away, oddly, and he takes a minute step forward. “Look, can we talk about—”
In some ways, it’s a triumph. Sure, Harry has eyes for someone else, but that someone else is male. Plus, what are the differences, really, between Draco and Leon? What does Leon have that Draco doesn’t? An accent? Draco is taller, his hair is blonder, and he won’t inevitably leave. It doesn’t seem fair that Harry has chosen someone else, really.
Ron smiles triumphantly, shooting up out of his chair and preparing his wand.
Harry almost falls backward, both because of the relative faintness and the implications of her statement. “You?”
He looks around, seeing lots of people nodding along furiously. He puts his head in his hands for a second, sighing.
Leon nods in return, then reaches for Harry’s right hand, which lands on Leon’s chest. The hair there
“Hi,” Harry says.
He does sigh now, a great release of angst and tension that had previously resided in his shoulders. “He’s not that bad. You said yourself, way back before term started, that things might not be what they seem. He’s changed. I’ve seen it for myself.”
“But I almost fell apart entirely. I managed to pick myself up, but only after you put your literal body between me and the threat. That snapped me back to reality.”
“Why does it matter to you? I thought maybe he could be a friend, but I was wrong, alright?”
. When the bloody sky is falling, time doesn’t seem to matter.”
” Draco is shocked to find his own hands shaking madly, like dead leaves hanging on to dried up branches.
A crash resounds from behind them as an immense lump of stone lands on top of the pile. It completely blocks off the Great Hall, and still the pile creeps forward, the entire room flooding with the castle’s innards.
He starts to feel panicked himself. And then. The flames don’t die down, but they do start to change color, from black, too white, to blue, to orange. McGonagall whips out her wand and screams “
Harry’s face goes hot. “You were right,” he admits. “I briefly thought maybe I liked boys in addition to girls, but due to a very recent event I see how wrong I was.”
Draco stands, allowing himself a moment to stretch. Most of his joints pop obnoxiously. Supposedly a temporary side effect of the Skele-Gro, and one that he’d rather like to be rid of.
“Basically, therapy is based solely on personal experience. At least, that’s the way
“Hey, you remember how many older brothers I have? It’s not my fault that bartering was a natural part of my upbringing,” Ron protests, nostalgia like honey in his voice. “If you can’t smell a bad deal when it’s smoking in front of you, that’s on you, mate,” he says, but he’s grinning and it’s impossible for anything to ruin their day.
“Harry? You alright, mate?” Ron asks as Harry approaches. “Looks like you’re trying to swallow a Snitch.”
“Oh. All right,” Harry says. He wasn’t even aware that she was doing further research on it. “Bad?”
, for that matter—through the ringer like that.
“We?” Draco says.
“Back to the matter at hand,” Molly says with a pointed look in Bill’s direction. “What exactly are you planning to do next, Harry?”
“draco, you have to come with me, please -” she whispers, tugging on his arm with a ferocity that reminds him of pansy parkinson. he misses pansy. maybe he’ll get to see her again before he dies. “i’m afraid for you, we don’t have the time.” tears fall from her eyes freely as she yanks him towards the fireplace, grappling for the container filled with floo powder. “go, draco, please!”
after a few long moments, during which draco fought back tears and reminded himself that it was just a dream, harry’s alarm charm went off, the same way that it did every morning. draco remained awake, his eyes shut tightly.
“i’m always a prat,” draco said lowly, hoping potter wouldn’t notice the slight tremor in his voice. “it’s my trademark.”
“you’re going to america?” ron asked, the shock evident in his voice. there’s something else there too - worry, and a hint of affection. it makes draco feel oddly warm inside - his friendship with weasley was one he would never quite understand, but would eternally be grateful for. “are you sure?”
as she held up her hands in a shrug, draco felt himself drawn to his feet. absently, he obeyed his subconscious and stood.
her -”
dutifully, harry began to undress draco, pulling off his loafers first and then his socks.
“harry,” draco says, looking over at him. “are you ready? can i -”
his amortentia had smelled like harry. harry potter, the saviour of the wizarding world and patron saint of orphans and gryffindors, who draco still privately believed to be much too virtuous and good and deserving to pursue draco - shared a scent with draco’s amortentia. the...
“what are you, the cock commander?” draco snapped.
he lies beneath a white sheet, covered up to his chest, but draco pulls it away with shaking hands. he runs his fingers over every inch of harry’s body, wanting to recoil from the unfamiliar coolness that reaches back to him, yet still so desperate to hold on to even one last piece of harry, if he can.
harry laughed loudly at something on the telly, and draco couldn’t hold back his annoyed exhale. harry noticed, and flicked his wand again, muting the television. draco’s headache slightened marginally, and he suddenly felt guilty about releasing his frustration.
“i think you have us confused with hufflepuffs,” theo said dryly.
he had slumped one day, defeated, outside of a bakery, tearing at a chocolate muffin when the idea had struck. he asked the young till worker for the manager, a friendly old wizard with a shiny bald head - and had left two hours later with an apron and a new job.
when harry potter shows up on his doorstep, draco does an impressive job of hiding his shock.
the idea comes to him sporadically, itching at the back of his mind as he added the mandrake root into his cauldron. he has everything he needs - the rose thorns, the ashwinder eggs, and the bloody peppermint. he could just throw it all in a cauldron together, and no one would ever be any wiser. he scolds himself quietly, worrying over the possibilities of going through with this. he doesn’t know what scares him more: the idea of the results confirming his suspicions, or disproving them. he continues to mull it over as he stirs the pepper-up potion before setting it back on the burner to simmer for a bit.
he sees two mugs  - one, fire engine red and the other pale blue, with a single crack running down the side, a scar acquired during the move from draco’s small flat to the home they share. his small saucer with his slice of toast sits beside his mug, gone cold and dry and missing a small bite. the small puddles of draco’s coffee form abstract patterns, almost like the markings of a cow. yesterdays edition of the prophet sits folded near the edge of the table, in the place where nobody sits. these are marks on the table, notches and scratches either irreversible by magic or too insignificant to be fixed, gathered from years of use. there are places where the wood is naturally burnt, or discolored. it is their table. they have argued, and made up, and cried, and kissed, and fucked, and lived at this table. and on top of the table, there are two mugs, one chipped and one whole, both full of coffee. there is an old newspaper, and a small plate with a slice of toast, and nothing else at all.
he doesn’t see harry. ron and hermione do, at least a handful of times. a week after hermione rescues him, she knocks on his bedroom door, clutching a shrunken box filled with his things. they don’t talk about harry to him, or around him. occasionally, they’ll have an argument about him, with hermione shouting and crying about how
“none of that,” pansy tuts softly, patting his cheek.  “let’s get you home, darling.”
his face was wet - whether from perspiration or tears he didn’t know. he felt the urge to scream again, and so he did - tipping his head back and releasing a bloodcurdling screen towards the sky, much like a werewolf.
“i’m not done with you,” harry says, pulling draco towards him. he pushes his knees to his chest, eyeing his glistening hole. he slides in easily, draco moaning loudly simultaneously. his eyes flutter shut and his mouth falls open, full pink lips curling back against perfect white teeth. “like that, do you?”
“gentlemen,” draco says, tugging on his tattered old sweater and suddenly regretting pulling on harry’s old rags. “what can i do for you?”
when the lift finally opened, a handful of witches and wizards poured out. draco bounced politely to the side until it was empty before bounding in and jabbing the button for level two. the witch who had been waiting with him looked pointedly away and draco rolled his eyes, slamming the grate shut and setting the lift off.
“harry, what are you doing?” draco asked, baffled. it seemed as if the bubble they had been floating in for the past week was preparing to pop. “what’s wrong?”
“are you always this eloquent?” draco snorted, kissing harry’s finger as it dragged across his lips.
“that is our couch lube,” draco sneered, snatching it from goyle’s hand. “sometimes we can’t wait. now, if we could focus on what’s actually important -“
draco sighed contentedly as a breeze passed, carrying the sweet scent of the flowers. he flexed his fingers and toes, smiling as the soft grass scratched at his skin. the moment felt perfect - and reminded him much of his childhood. he had spent many days in the gardens of the manor with his mother - rolling in the grass and helping her tend to the garden as much as his small, clumsy fingers could handle.
. andrew visits draco at his bakery as often as he can, always ordering that same croissant, and leaning across the counter for a gentle kiss and a whispered
“hmm, you pretty much named everything,” draco murmured into harry’s neck. he pulled harry’s mug from his hand and placed it on the coffee table next to his own - they could finish their drinks later. “although there is one other thing.”
harry winces, but nods. “but not to you. never to you. everything was real, draco. i told you i loved you, and you didn’t say anything back, i panicked and -”
“draco,” she says softly, “what’s going on?”
“now who doesn’t sound enthusiastic,” harry teased. he grabbed the lube bottle, pouring some on his fingers and leaning forward to reach draco’s hole again. he pushed two fingers in easily, scissoring them slowly. draco opened around him easily, his hips bearing down subtly into harry’s fingers.
not stopping his constant thrusts, harry waves his hand ad sends a cleaning charm over himself, followed by his preferred lubrication charm. draco takes advantage of this eagerly, running a finger around harry’s hole quickly before pushing in. harry responds instantaneously, a loud groan falling from his lips as he fucks forward into draco’s bath and backwards onto his fingers. draco eases another finger in beside the first - giving harry a moment to adjust before he begins to scissor his digits slowly.
draco tuned back into the conversation, and realized belatedly that he had probably missed something important. the man seemed to be still speaking, gesticulating in a manner that reminded draco of an excited ron weasley. after a while, he slowed down, took a deep breath, and relaxed back into his seat.
“draco, don’t you think you’re being a bit dramatic?” harry tried, his hands trembling with the effort of holding in his laughter.
“harry,” draco sobbed, his hands trembling. “i need you,”
she froze in her tracks, staring with wide eyes. “a suicide attempt? that doesn’t make any sense. harry wasn’t suicidal. he - he’s engaged to be married, for merlin’s sake. he’s not…” she stopped and glanced up at at healer, who looked very uncomfortable. hermione continued to follow behind the healer in a stunned silence, her hands trembling. as they reached the hallway, the healers moved aside, allowing her to see inside of the room.
“draco, they
“harry,” ginny says firmly, one hand on his shoulder. she shakes him. “harry.”
“harry,” he gasps lightly, his eyes welling with tears inexplicably. “oh, harry.”
harry smiled, pulling out a chair for draco to sink into before his plate. he pressed a gentle kiss to his forehead as he poured two glasses of wine.
a small movement breaks harry’s attention - which he quickly refocuses back at draco’s hole. he’s stretched slightly from his fingers, and remains of the lube circle the outside of the rim. he places a gentle kiss there - giving draco time to react, before pointing his tongue and lapping at his hole.
a voice in the back of his head, one that sounded suspiciously like harry, gently prodded at him until he turned around and walked away slowly and steadily, without a backwards glance.
. “i never told you about the bloody potion. i kept it a surprise, because i wanted you to be proud of me. you don’t even know what i’m
draco opened his mouth to respond, but stopped when his eyes welled with tears and he felt himself become overwhelmed with emotion. he had expected the tentative friendship he had built with ron and hermione during his and harry’s relationship to crumble upon his death. they no longer had reason to tolerate his presence, or treat him with kindness. yet, they had taken him in, and taken care of him when he needed it the most.
harry was lying on the bed, with his eyes closed and his wild hair splayed across the pillow. he looked like he could be sleeping, except for the unnatural stillness of his chest.
ginny stands from the table, her chair scraping loudly against the floor. she glares down at both of them, her lip quivering minutely. she’s about to cry, that much is obvious - but seems to not want to give them the satisfaction of knowing that they’ve upset her. draco takes it anyways. when she reaches across the table and slaps him, he’s half expecting it. he doesn’t flinch, simply stares up at her with a blank expression. he looks stupid, he knows, with the bright pink handprint that must be on the side of his face. but, his pride trumps all. draco reaches forward and grabs a full shot from the table, knocking it back and settling into his seat, looking every inch the cocky bastard they all think he is.
harry doesn’t respond, but he allows draco to wrap his arms around him and pull him into his chest. he begins to sob loudly, his fingers grappling at draco’s as he trembles in his arms. with each wracking cry, draco’s heart clenches uncomfortably. it was rare and uncomfortable to see harry cry - and he had never cried this hard, for this long.
“don’t - don’t fucking call me that, stop calling me that,” draco sobs, his chest wracking with each breath. he feels as if he’ll be sick with the force of his anguish, as if he’ll hyperventilate and pass out, or die. “you always call me draco. i’m draco.”
they had hugged, and kissed, and touched less than 24 hours ago - and now he was supposedly…
“well, maybe i can still go.” harry said suddenly, effectively destroying draco’s peace. “a little bit of snow never hurt anyone. would just soften the ground if anything.” suddenly much happier than he had been all morning, harry turned away from the window, practically skipping towards the stairs.
“are you okay?” harry asked, his fingers stroking at draco’s hip afterward.
when draco wakes the next morning, his head pounds, his throat is raw, and his memory is hazy. he’s somehow in his bed, although he doesn’t remember ever making the trek from his front door to his room. he’s not wearing the tight trousers and silky top he had worn to the bar yesterday - instead, he’s dressed in soft flannel trousers and a worn sweater. he’s wearing socks, fuzzy ones with purple and orange spots. on his bedside table sits a glass of water and a vial of hangover potion.
dudley’s face softens as he listens - he looks almost hopeful now. a wobbly smile spreads across his face and he looks up at draco. “oh, yeah?”
“hah, did you hear that? i’m even using customary units now. i’m practically a native new yorker! anyways, i just wanted to let you know that i’ve been going to therapy lately and i’ve been learning alot. they’ve been teaching me about coping mechanisms, and moving on, and things of that nature. so i just wanted to let you know that… i forgive you.
and then, as soon as it had began, the pain stopped.
as draco returned to the living room, he slumped onto the sofa, and fished out the cellphone hermione had made them all buy. he only had four contacts in it, and mostly used it to play muggle games - however he had recently figured out how to sext with harry, and frequently sent explicit paragraphs in the middle of the day, just to keep things interesting.
“i know,” harry says quietly. “i know, draco.”
his headache, which had started shortly after breakfast and had stubbornly persistd into the afternoon, was only growing as his irritance festered. harry hadn’t necessarily done anything to make him angry - in fact, he had woken draco up with an earth-shattering blow-job and then prepared a large breakfast for them both, before pulling draco onto the couch for an overlong cuddling session, with small breaks for making out or groping each other.
“and what is that?” harry asked, his hands coming to rest on draco’s waist as draco crawled over him, effectively straddling his hips. they kissed fleetingly, staring into each others eyes.
“pot, kettle.” he murmurs, catching draco’s lips in another kiss. he reaches down between them, cupping draco and giving his cock a slight squeeze through the fabric. the angle is awkward, but even the smallest amount of pressure is enough to make draco hiss quietly, his hips bucking into harry’s hand.
“let’s go home, love.”
luna nods and turns away, busying herself with something on a small table behind her while draco stares up at the ceiling, attempting to steady his breathing. it’s not as if he’s afraid of the pain - the dark mark on his arm and the crucio’s he had experienced during the war had been more physically painful. emotionally, well - draco could handle anything that luna had for him. he watches as she pulls out the tattoo gun and her wand and presumably sanitizes them, before turning back to him. when she first puts the needle to his skin, he winces simply out of instinct. in reality, he feels only a slight pressure in the general area as she works.
“i’ll change,” harry says shakily. he buries his face in draco’s neck, his warm breath ghosting across draco’s exposed collarbones. “i’ll be different.”
hermione gasped shakily, her hand coming to cover her mouth. what had harry been doing in the forbidden forest? had he been attacked by a creature?
“i want you to pick,” he says steadily, raising his chin into the air and forcing his tears from his voice. “pick me… and yourself, and your family, and your friends.” he finally catches harry’s eye - green and silver meet - and he holds the contact, attempting to pour everything he feels into the glance. he tries to tell harry wordlessly how much he loves him, how much he cares, how badly he wants for him to get better, how desperately he craves the future together that they had once planned upstairs in their bed, pressed nose to nose and still drunk with new love. he tells harry that he wants to support him, and help him, and that he can only do so if harry himself decides to take the first step. he reaches into his pocket and fishes out the small green bag and throws it on the table. he ignores the pang in his chest when harry breaks eye contact with him, immediately fixating on the bag and it’s small white contents. “or pick this,” draco says quietly, gesturing to the bag. “because i’m not sticking around to watch you kill yourself, harry. i love you, so very much… but i can’t love you more than i love myself.”
“you’re not my bloody mistress,” harry had slurred, his hands still fumbling with draco’s coat. “ginny and i are keeping it casual.”
“you,” draco whispers, and then falters. his heart thuds ridiculously in his chest, and he genuinely fears that it’ll fall out of his chest and he’ll die here, in harry’s arms. “you taste of peppermint.”
“eleven,” draco mutters. at eleven, he had just received his own wing in malfoy manor, and his own personal house elf. he had slept in a large, fluffy bed with lots of space, and had been doted on. at eleven, he had been happy. “yes - yes,” he refocuses, and makes a conscious effort to calm his rage into a slow, controlled burn, rather than the wildfire that threatens to consume him now. “right. follow me.”
he slides the ring onto his finger with a barely-suppressed sob.
harry nodded, and the procession began.
“no!” harry had insisted, pulling a flattened aluminum can out of his pocket. “we’re going on a trip! this is our portkey!”
draco listed them off, punctuating his sentence with a customary glare at jackson, which meant that anything said in his presence was to be repeated only under the strongest of crucios. the more people that knew about their maturing bond, the more dangerous things were for draco, but especially harry. if the word were to get out that he wasn’t at 100% magical capability… draco shuddered at the implications.
“except for you,” harry had mused after a moment. “a cottage.”
harry, who stands on his doorstep, claiming to be changed, with his hand outstretched. his hand, the hand that had wrapped around draco’s throat and
he and harry had been arguing - or, more appropriately, harry had been roaring at draco and draco had been sobbing pathetically as harry berated him, truly cruel words rolling off of his tongue incessantly.
“but the quiet is just so….” draco closed his eyes and moaned softly. “wonderful.”
“it’s not necessarily what i want to know,” she says, looking a bit put out. “i just think it would help you begin to heal. although, i am curious, naturally. seeing harry like that was… shocking. i can’t imagine what it was like for you.” she looks up at draco now, her eyes already beginning to water. he didn’t remember harry ever mentioning just how much hermione seemed to cry. “i’m here to listen, but only if you feel ready to share.”
“your bloody scars, even the ones that i made on your skin, they’re all so mesmerizing. i know you hate them, but merlin they're beautiful - they’re magnificent. i still remember the way they feel, remember every single curve and arch. and your eyes, christ draco, your eyes. i’ve missed your eyes. all i wanted, all this time, was for you to look at me. the last time you looked at me you hated me so much, and it killed me because i don’t want you to hate me,”
“draco,” harry started, sitting up slowly. “i -“
“harry!” draco grits out, his thighs trembling.
“i’m fine,” harry pants, wiping the back of his mouth. “it’s just - dudley…
her tears never stop - each sob a heartbreaking display of her agony. but she works through them consistently, even pausing occasionally to gently wipe at draco’s own tears. she pushes him through the floo, and deposits him on their sofa, placing a gentle kiss on his forehead.
“i wish you were here, harry. i miss you, and i wish things could be different. but - i need you to know that i love you and i miss you.
harry, who had reliably always come home by six pm, suddenly began to stumble through the door near midnight - reeking of alcohol and covered in his own sick.
after a few moments, draco stands from the table, partly to give harry time to pull himself together, and partly because he knows that there’s something he must do. he finds the letter quickly, because it’s in the same place it’s been since he had first moved into this house. it’s still in its envelope, tucked away in the farthest corner of his sock drawer. he holds it against his chest for a moment before sighing and going back into the kitchen. his hand shakes as he places the letter before harry, knowing that he’s preparing to open a proverbial can of worms.
harry takes draco’s face in his hands, stroking his cheek and then his lips with his thumb. he stares at draco for a moment longer before smiling, leaning in and placing a gentle kiss on draco’s lips. it’s short and chaste, and quickly followed by another on the very corner of draco’s mouth, and then another on his chin, his nose, his cheeks, his eyes, and on and on until draco smiles, despite his teary eyes.
but this - the anger that burned in the pit of his stomach - was red and hot like fiendfyre, and threatened to consume him completely. it had him gag, the force of the anger - hitting him like a reducto. his entire body warmed, and he suddenly was filled with the desire to tug off his sweater and throw it to the ground, and perhaps tear it to shreds like a savage.
“harry?” he calls, furrowing his brow. usually, harry could be found in the kitchen, toying with some recipe or baking something that he would ultimately end up giving away. he had always been adept in the kitchen, but had recently started spending even more time in their kitchen. a distraction, his therapist had suggested.
they had agreed that a wedding could wait until they were both secure. for now, being engaged and infatuated with each other was more than enough. the future seemed bright - complete with the idea of a family, successful careers, and the happy ending that they both felt they deserved.
as everyone fawns over weasley’s ring and titters over possible details for potter and she-weasel’s impending nuptials, draco gets steadily sloshed, until his usual precaution melts away and he finds himself murmuring into theodore nott’s ear, one hand on his shoulder and the other stroking lightly at his neck.
“what?” draco whimpered, arousal already building in his stomach.
when he pushed open the door, he found harry lying in their bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. draco crawled onto the bed beside him, and takes it as a good sign when harry looks at him and doesn’t tell him to fuck off.
dudley whimpers.
it had been fairly easy to find the spot. there were wildflowers growing in one lone circle, as if the forest spirits had enchanted it. other gifts of nature were also in the pile - polished rocks and sparkling leafs and smooth sticks. the sunlight seemed to filter through the tall trees and shine directly on the small patch, dancing across the grass and creating strange shapes.
for an hour, draco busied himself with cleaning the living room and kitchen by hand and sobering up. he fluffed pillows, washed glasses, and folded throw blankets repeatedly, all the while listening carefully up the stairs. harry doesn’t reappear down the steps, or show any signs that he’s actually in the house - and so, after an hour, draco takes a deep breath and climbs the stairs slowly, his hands trembling by his side.
harry groaned loudly as his pleasure retreated, opening his eyes and blinking hazily. “turn around then, you prick.” he commands, sitting up on his elbows.
“oh,” she chortled, leaning forward conspiratorially. “i myself was a hufflepuff, but i had a… male friend who was a gryffindor. you can imagine i spent a fair bit of time up in the towers myself. that was ages ago, and long before i met dear old richard, as i’m sure you can tell,”
“that bad, am i?”
she drops the privacy charm, wrapping an arm around his waist and guiding him gently to the apparition point. if people are looking at them, he doesn’t notice - completely grounded by the solid warmth of pansy against his side.
“you,” he snaps, jerking his head at vernon. “when was harry born?”
at one point, he had loved this house. every inch of it was covered in memories of his and harry’s time together - a chaste kiss here, a quick hook up there. they had lived and laughed and fought and fucked over nearly every surface - and now, even looking at a certain corner or room made draco’s stomach twist painfully.
he’s also not sure of how this thing started with potter.
“please direct all questions to auror williams,” harry said gruffly gesturing to thalia. “i have business to attend to elsewhere.”
harry’s eyes flutter open slowly as he takes in draco’s presence, his lips curling down into a frown. “draco,” harry says slowly, stumbling over the name as if it’s foreign - as if he hasn’t said it thousands of times over, as if he hasn’t laughed and whispered and cried and screamed his name. “i thought… i thought you had work?”
“oh, harry, no,” draco said, standing and rushing over to harry. the alcohol and gillyweed are still in his system, and his eyes well with tears. “you haven’t done anything wrong, i - this is all my fault,”
harry sits on the floor beside draco, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him into his chest. draco’s surprised - but too wrapped up in his own grief to consider this much. instead, he continues to cry into harry's chest - loud, terrible noises that rip from his throat violently. as he cries, he pushes and punches at harry, actively fighting him but unwilling to let him go. harry remains strong, holding draco close and rubbing his back, as if draco hasn’t just destroyed nearly everything he holds dear. as if there’s anything else for him to go back to in the real world. no - instead, he holds him closer - as if they’re the only people left in the world.
“draco,” harry interrupts. now, he says his name calmly and familarily, his slur from the night before absent. “i -”
hermione tuned out the rest of his sentence as she made her way to the front of the crowd once more with ron by her side. the healers who had been working on harry before had stepped to the side - only the old man in white robes remained - both of his hands pressed to harry’s chest as he murmured under his breath. everyone in the room seemed to be holding their breath - and several of the healers were clutching each other.
later, harry would learn that these particular owls were as dark an omen as the grim itself. they had many names in wizarding society - morning birds, mourning birds, couriers of death, and so on and so forth.
draco blushed, and looked down at the table. “it didn’t come up,” he murmured.
draco grabs his drink and tips it back, downing it and allowing the roar in his ears and throat to drown out potter’s announcement - his proud proclalamtion of this stupid fucking decision. around draco, the table bursts into applause, loud cheering and toasting and hugging and kissing all around. ginny takes the opportunity to flash her ring now, the one she had somehow managed to hide inconspicuously thus far into the evening.
“oh, i’ll show you what i think of you,” harry teases, dropping down to lie directly on top of draco. he bursts into loud laughter, his arms wrapping around harry’s neck and holding him close as he is quickly quieted with a kiss.
narcissa’s death had turned up inconclusive - and the magical examiners hadn’t detected any signs of foul play, even when harry had requested that they run all of the scans multiple times. her cause of death had been classified as natural causes, despite being a generally healthy woman, and her case had been closed. the department, and the rest of the world, had moved on to the next interesting thing.
draco wears sweatpants -
harry looks away, towards the car.
“oh, even better! so you’re going to ignore him until he marries you. very realistic. flawless logic, draco. it’s a wonder you weren’t sorted into ravenclaw.” blaise relaxed back into his seat, smiling lazily at draco. he wasn’t even actually upset, the bastard, he just seemed to enjoy baiting draco.
in the week between narcissa’s death and her funeral, draco mostly sleeps around the house. occasionally, harry would also catch him staring out of a window blankly, his eyes bloodshot and damp. he never seemed to want to talk much, but he still clung to harry like a koala when he was home, always pressing his face into his neck, or wrapping his arms around his waist.
harry stood there, his arms folded across his chest. his black booted toe taps against the floor as he stares down at draco, hard. draco, who had suddenly developed an interest in a piece of lint on his trousers, could feel his heart pounding in his chest.
“mmm,” draco murmured when the pain had finally crossed the threshold and turned to pleasure. “‘m okay,”
“i’ve just never had a dream like this,” he said to the remaining trio. “i’ve slept next to him nearly every night, for two years and then this randomly happens. what if my ancestors are trying to warn me?”
“harry,” draco murmurs, and then says nothing else. he hopes that harry understands, that he hears the unspoken ‘
“they’re not dead,” draco says. “not yet, at least.”
“draco, you know you could always just go to the château in france... it’’s much closer, and you can still have the fresh start that you need. new york city is just so far away… we’ll never see you!” narcissa clung to his arm, her voice wavering only in the slightest.
draco steps forward, into the floo. he catches one last glimpse of harry, curled on the ground before the fireplace, his eyes vacant and one hand reaching in draco’s direction, the other hovering over the pocket of his trousers.
nothing he hadn’t heard before.
blaise’s eyebrow shoots up at this, and he runs his hands down his front, as if straightening his clothing. “draco, darling,” he practically purred, adopting a tone draco hadn’t had directed at himself in years, “forget about boy-wonder. let’s go away together. i can take you anywhere you’d like. milan, greece, new york city…” he reaches out to take draco’s hand, and was rewarded with a pert slap on the wrist.
that night, they make love.
“what is it?” harry asked, sitting up and looking over at draco. “you’re more irritated than usual.”
as the song came to an end, the lights came up in the club, revealing the sweaty mess of bodies that had been writhing against each other. in a thick jamaican accent, the dj announced that he would be taking a short break, prompting a disappointed groan from all corners of the room.
“draco,” harry interrupts again, his lips pursed and distress written over his face. “it’s not that easy to just stop. i’ve tried.”
usually, they would wake with draco curled under harry’s arm, or somewhat pressed against his body. the excuse draco often gave was that harry was a walking furnace, and due to his inbreeding-induced anemia, he required some of his body heat. in reality, draco simply loved touching harry, whenever possible.
harry looks over at him, his eyes bright and clear and open and terribly endearing.
in london again. just like their home, the city is littered with memories of the time he and harry had had together. since the idea of relocating had come to him, he had been anxiously counting down the days until he could finally leave all of this behind.
the man was ridiculously predictable - it wasn’t feasible that he’d randomly pick up a mistress. it would disrupt his entire daily routine. however, he was also wealthy, powerful, and bloody attractive... it was entirely possible for someone to have wormed their way into his heart (and pants), the same way draco had.
doing here?” he demands, jabbing a finger in harry’s direction.
“i’ve got alot on my mind, draco” he whispered, before releasing the contents of his stomach into the tub. he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, before turning back to draco, his eyes watering. when draco opened his arms, harry pressed his face into his stomach, taking quick, shallow breaths.
“you love me,” harry finishes, a stupid grin spreading across his face. draco can’t decide if he wants to collapse with relief or kiss him. “you love me?”
“not bloody likely,” draco spat. “i’m limiting the amount of magic i use everyday so that his stores aren’t tampered with - but i’m a pureblood wizard… i’ve grown up around magic constantly, and both restricting myself and having him draw from my stores is exhausting, to say the least.”
“your ancestors were racist, and would probably be trying to warn you about harry’s ethnicity rather than the status of his fidelity.” blaise commented, “any curry related dreams recently?”
when draco finished, harry sat in silence, stunned.
it was one of harry’s favorite movies, and he had been particularly adamant that they watched it now. draco hadn’t cared very much - the telly fascinated him despite what was on it.
“besides,” lucius continues, an evil smile spreading across his face. “your aunt bellatrix was wrong about many things… but she was very, very right about the importance of unity in a family. personally, i’d rather have no family than a disloyal one. surely you’ve learned that by now, draco? or must i continue to teach you the same lesson - the one that i’ve been trying to teach you since you were a child?
draco takes the box with shaky hands, glancing down at it and feeling his heart shrivel up and die completely. folded at the bottom of the box was a grey jumper that draco had gotten him during their first christmas together. there are a few photo frames, containing photos of ron and hermione, teddy, draco, and some of them all standing and smiling together. there are also a few knick-knacks of harry’s - a small dragon figurine and a spinning broomstick. and there, nestled in between it all - a small crystal jar, filled with peppermints.
draco finds himself gasping shakily, his hand coming up to cover his mouth.
“yea,” harry rushes out of the door, before backpedaling and moving back to draco’s bedside. he leaned over the bed, gently grasping draco’s chin and pulling him into a light kiss. “love you,”
,” draco murmured so that only harry could hear him. he glanced around the room - most of the junior aurors were staring fixedly down at the table before them, although a few caught each other's eyes with knowing smirks.
