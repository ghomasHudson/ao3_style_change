,” Potter murmured, and in the blink of an eye, the flames were licking the wooden boat all over. “Okay, the wards shouldn’t extend this far. Hold on tight to me.”
Harry gulped. In a way, he knew Sirius was right. Harry may have put too much weight on being able to speak parseltongue and being an orphan while he hadn’t appreciated enough the things he had now in his life. Hogwarts as a place to call home, magic, his friends, the Weasleys, Sirius, Draco… Harry couldn’t think of a way to leave that all behind and turn to evil all of a sudden. If you didn’t take Voldemort, the possibility of war, and the gossiping Prophet and other Hogwarts’s students into account, Harry was actually quite happy with his life. He snorted inwardly. Well, not that Voldemort and the possibility of war would be some tiny matters to get over with, but on the other hand, Harry nowadays recognized much better the things he was grateful for in his life.
Harry’s friends continued complaining about Malfoy being a prefect as Harry sank back into his own thoughts. He couldn’t forget about the expression he was quite sure he had seen on Malfoy’s face for a fleeting moment. The bare anxiety and despair had made Malfoy look so vulnerable and exposed that it had caught Harry’s attention. Harry had seen many expressions on Malfoy’s face, but these were some new ones Harry couldn’t really place into the picture he had created of the Slytherin during their school years. Malfoy was always so aware of himself and what he gave out. The most typical expression, Malfoy’s trademark smirk, was the one Harry was most familiar with. In addition to that, Harry could recognize angriness when the git ranted about a lost Quidditch match, impatience when he snapped at Grabbe or Goyle, haughtiness when Muggle-borns or Half-bloods bypassed him on the corridors and fear when he confronted magical creatures he didn’t know how to respect. Just like Hippogriffs, for instance. But anxiety and despair? They were expressions beyond Malfoy’s normal scale. Having seen them made Harry feel somehow strange, even a bit queasy. To be able to see Malfoy vulnerable, if even just for a second, made Harry see Malfoy in a somewhat new light. The bastard had seemed to be… human. At first, Harry thought it might have been because Harry had caught Malfoy off guard by attacking him, but Harry abandoned the thought quite quickly. He couldn’t even count the times he had grabbed the git’s robes, and vice versa, but the reaction had never been like this. Malfoy would never drop his mask, not if there weren’t some really grave reasons behind it.
They laid there for a while, waiting for their breathing to become even. Malfoy’s hair was tickling Harry’s nose, and he could hear the birds singing again and feel the cool, moist grass under him.
“You hadn’t,” Harry said, closing his eyes as he felt Draco’s finger tracing his face. “May I kiss you now?”
“So, shall we see what the house-elf friend of yours has prepared for us this time?” Blaise asked, seizing the basket and sitting down on the armchair that was next to Ginny’s.
“That’s not true,” Harry said. “There’s no guidebook to the situation you were in. But you’ve survived and you’re here now. It’s all that really matters.”
When they had eaten, Arthur went to the shed on the garden that was reserved only for his Muggle items, meanwhile, Ron and George went to the living room to play Wizard’s Chess. As not the most eager chess player, Harry decided to stay with Molly and help her to clean the kitchen as Molly made them some tea.
“Maybe not to you. But I’d bet Malfoy hasn’t said ‘I love you’ that many times in his life. Maybe he wanted to say it out loud but in a way you wouldn’t be able to understand. Confessing your feelings makes you vulnerable.”
“Honestly, I don’t know,” Harry said, sitting down next to her. “At first I thought his battery must be getting low but I’m not sure if that’s the case. I mean, he sounded really anxious when he called me even though he tried to hide it.”
“Nothing,” Draco said, and Harry raised his eyebrow questioningly. “Pansy’s still mad at me, Greg and Vince don’t even notice I’m gone as soon as they reach Honeydukes, and Blaise knows I’m with you anyway.”
“Fine, I’ll see you two later, then,” Harry said, nodding to Blaise and Ginny before exiting the room.
When the train arrived at Hogsmeade, Harry could guess Draco had noticed him coming into the compartment as he made sure he was the last one left in the compartment.
For a moment, neither Harry nor Draco said anything as they both just concentrated on feeling the autumn sun making their skin tingle rather pleasantly and looking at the birds flying high up in the sky, probably heading south for the winter.
“Erm, yes,” Draco said, taking a long breath in. “Well, as I told you, they didn’t pay much attention to me back then, but it kind of changed soon after that.”
“Yeah. Ron and Hermione must’ve solved their little disagreement by now,” Ginny said, putting her arm through Harry’s again.
Harry felt horrified. He had never even heard of such a tradition, and it still sounded completely bizarre Draco's parents had been able to organize something like that. “But this doesn’t make any sense! Why on earth would they do that to him?” he asked, looking at both Ron and Hermione.
Harry snaked his arm tightly around Draco and pulled him as close to him as he could. He kissed Draco’s forehead fondly, a small smile on his face, before letting his body fall asleep.
“You haven’t shaved. Your stubble is frozen,” Draco said, taking off his mitten and touching gently Harry’s chin with his fingers. “It glistens.”
“So you don’t trust them?” Draco said, not really understanding what he tried to achieve with this conversation.
“Harry,” Draco said with a hoarse voice and bolted up from the floor so fast his still sleepy limbs started to ache. “I’m so sorry about the quarrel we had and how I treated you after that, could we just –” he said, words streaming out of his mouth until he noticed the appearance of the other boy.
“Well, if your boyfriend’s identity was still a mystery to me, I’d say he was confessing his love to you,” Ginny said. “But now that I know it’s Draco Malfoy who we’re talking about, I’m not that sure anymore.”
“But… What about you both snickering at me in the Great Hall the other day?” Malfoy asked, still seemingly suspicious. He looked Harry straight in the eye as if trying to find some answers in Harry’s eyes.
Potter pulled the Invisibility Cloak off of himself, looking surprised. Draco smirked to himself. He had been following the boy more or less intensively for the past seven years, the Gryffindor simply had no chance to surprise him anymore. He should have known this by now.
“My sentence is carried out starting officially in August. Besides, they can’t forbid anyone to visit their family member, especially in a case like yours,” Narcissa said. “How are you feeling, darling?”
Harry pulled a book from his bag. It was an old, Muggle children’s book that looked like it had been read thousands and thousands of times.
Harry knew better than to answer Snape’s accusation. Instead, he put his bag on the floor and sat down on the chair Snape had placed for him beforehand.
Harry’s happiness for his friends’ reactions didn’t last long in a world where being gay was only one of his numerous problems. The detentions with Umbridge had already become a routine, but Harry hadn’t really foreseen they could become worse and worse after every time. Harry’s wound didn’t have time to heal itself after the previous session before Umbridge’s cursed quill pierced his skin again, making the wound deeper and more painful every time.
“Are you still wondering if Malfoy’s doing something for Voldemort? Harry, please, you said it yourself last year. Voldemort wouldn’t recruit underage wizards,” Hermione said, frustrated.
“I still don’t get why people just don’t leave,” Harry said, frustrated. “I mean, anybody can tell love and acceptance that is dependent on your acts isn’t healthy.”
Harry sighed and laid down on his bed. Even though Dudley did get on his nerves, Harry felt also oddly… happy? Or content? Or perhaps normal? It felt luxurious in the middle of everything to get to worry about something as mundane as your cousin teasing you about your boyfriend, even though the name had gone all wrong. And speaking with Draco on the phone had made Harry feel like he was in a Muggle movie where teenagers were calling to their boy- or girlfriends, speaking for hours about basically nothing at all. Harry could definitely see himself getting used to that feeling.
“It’s getting cold, isn’t it?” Ginny asked, rubbing her hands together, cheeks glowing red. “Need to take my gloves with me next time.”
“It’s quite obvious, isn’t it?” Harry asked, nonplussed. “He chose his family over me, chose to stay on Voldemort’s side.”
“I’m not sure, that’s actually what I wanted to ask you. He’s sending me very mixed signals, it’s like he doesn’t like me at all, but at the same time it seems like there’s also something else going on inside his head,” Harry explained, feeling himself relax a little.
“Exactly. You got chosen to the team for a reason,” Hermione stated firmly. Ron still said nothing, but a small hint of a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.
Three weeks. That was how long a human being could survive without food. At least he was still given water every now and then, so if he died for some reason before the day of his execution, it would surely be because of the hunger. At first, Draco had tried to count the days when he didn’t get food, but he had given up trying quite quickly as the darkness of the cell had made him lose the sense of time already during the first couple of days. Hours, days, and weeks melted happily into each other, and he hadn’t had a clue for a long time when it was supposed to be day and when night. One of the few signs that somehow told him about the time passing was his stomach that had rambled and cramped because of hunger at first, and that had gradually got used to the lack of food so that he had nowadays difficulties to keep in the rare meals that the oh-so-noble and benevolent new Ministry allowed him to have in all its mercy.
“Don’t be an idiot. You take me as a twelve-year-old?” Draco asked but accepted the card as Blaise handed it to him. Both Draco and Harry turned bright red as they noticed it was a picture of Harry.
Harry halted abruptly. His dizziness had worsened making his body feel numb, and for a moment he could see nothing else but stars.
“Yeah, I remember only the Parkinson case,” Ron said. “Though now that I recall it, I don’t remember Malfoy being with anyone else at school, and he was with Parkinson only for like two weeks or something.”
Draco turned his gaze quickly to his parents. His father’s face was as serious and cold as ever, not letting anything show. Draco wasn’t even sure if there was anything to show, it was probably more likely his father’s face was actually showing his purest emotions when he was regarding Draco with cold eyes and a slight sneer on his face.
“Do you want to talk about it? You know you’ve always the right to be yourself, no matter what,” Hermione said, making Harry feel relieved as she took the responsibility of carrying on their conversation.
“Just being a Slytherin and Malfoy’s good mate is enough of an insult to me,” Ron said sullenly and turned his eyes to Harry. “What I don’t understand is how you too can hang out with the ferret nowadays."
“Oh, for goodness sake, Harry, you’re both only eighteen. It’s not like you should just run away to Vegas and get married, swearing eternal love to each other,” Hermione said. “You can take it as slowly as you want. Week by week, day by day, hour by hour. As long as you tell each other about your feelings and fears, I’m sure you’ll do just fine.”
“Oh,” Harry said, not knowing what one should say in a situation like this. “I’m sorry? I mean, if you’re feeling sad or something.”
“And don’t shut us out. We want to have you in our lives,” Ginny said firmly. “The family aren’t always the people you grow up with. The family are the people who choose you, care about you, accept you and love you just the way you are.”
“Thanks,” Harry said and put the package quickly on the floor. He didn’t want to open it in front of his friends.
Harry felt really bad for his friend. He took Hermione’s hand between his own hands and looked straight into Hermione’s eyes. “I know you know their opinions are utter nonsense, but I still want to emphasize how amazing you are. You’re one of the best people in my life, I couldn’t make it without you,” Harry said, meaning every word. “You’ve said to me hundreds of times I can always talk to you when I feel like it. I want you to do the same. I wish I had known about all this much earlier.”
“Oh fine, oh fine,” Harry snapped. He knew his friends were right, he just didn’t like to admit himself what a jerk he had been last night. “He’s in your room, right?” he asked, getting up.
“I read a lot as you may have noticed. The human mind is quite fascinating,” Hermione said, shrugging. “Now we’ve got to do something lighter. Is there anything nice and easy to watch on your telly?” she asked, starting to flip the channels on tv.
?” Ron snorted, smirking. “Ugh, Merlin, if their wrestling on the Quidditch pitch was any indication of how they got along during the fifth and –
Harry huffed, feeling his head starting to throb slightly as it always did nowadays when he felt somehow helpless or useless. Suddenly, Harry saw movement in his peripheral vision, and he turned his gaze quickly to the window. The sight made his heart jump uncomfortably even though he had known all along this moment would come. And, after all, this was what he had been waiting for impatiently during the whole sleepless night and restless morning, but apparently, he could never get used to this sight on Sundays.
Harry was silent for a moment, lost in his own thoughts. “Where do you think we go after we die?” he asked quietly.
“Oh Jesus, I forgot my Transfiguration essay,” Hermione said, searching it fervently in her bag. “I must go get it.”
They both fell into silence. Harry could see that Malfoy was still tense and restless as if there was some kind of a storm going on inside his head. Harry was nonplussed by how Malfoy didn’t seem to want to, or even not be able to, hide his emotions from Harry. Fear and anxiousness were definitely that sorts of emotions that Malfoy considered as a sign of weakness, and something that Harry might use against him in the future. Malfoy’s openness made Harry feel somehow warm inside. He had a strange urge to touch the Slytherin’s face, to make his frown smooth and to hug him for as long as Malfoy’s worries would disappear and the tenseness would melt away. After a long moment, Harry sighed.
“I don’t know if I should take that as a compliment or not,” Draco muttered, acting annoyed but sounding quite pleased instead. “So, what would you like to have? We have turkey, cheese and salmon sandwiches.”
And when it came to the comfort level of the cell, it didn’t exactly help Draco’s body to relax, either. Not to mention that he was now supposed to sleep on the cold, bare floor. ‘
“Harry,” Draco said, surprised. “Didn’t know you’d come here. Thought you were celebrating Weasley’s birthday.”
When Draco had finally been able to leave from the Great Hall, he had darted through the crowd, trying to make his way straight to the Hospital Wing. He hadn’t managed to get far, though, before Umbridge had appeared from around the corner and ordered him to some additional Inquisitorial Squad duties.
“Actually, thought we could go together,” Harry said and pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of his robe pocket.
“No, I meant more like… Slytherin kind of pureblood system. You know, huge manors, blood purity, ancient traditions, that kind of stuff.”
“It was horrible what they did to you, or rather what they’ve done to you for your whole life, but it’s still only natural to miss them,” Andromeda said. “I missed my parents and sisters horribly when I left. I knew I couldn’t go back because they didn’t accept me, my values nor my choice of husband, but it didn’t stop me from thinking if I had made the right decision or not. A few times I actually considered going back for real.”
Draco turned his blazing gaze to Harry. “I don’t fucking know. Do you think I haven’t thought about this? I can’t tell them, if that’s what you’re asking,” Draco said, sounding angry and anxious at the same time.
Slowly, Draco changed the dirty and wrinkled clothes he had had in the Ministry cell to the perfectly clean and even unnaturally white robes. The robes fitted him perfectly and it was clear they had been really expensive, but he felt immediately restless and uncomfortable when he regarded himself in the mirror and felt the silk-like material all over against his skin. The robes could be just a present, a nice gesture to welcome Draco back home, but he couldn’t suppress the feeling there was something that didn’t add up.
“Oh yeah,” Harry snorted, rolling his eyes. When his friends had gotten together, their constant bickering had turned into almost sickeningly harmonious coexistence, and Harry didn’t know which one he preferred. “There’s just the tiny little matter he tried to kill you and didn’t do anything while Bellatrix tortured Hermione. Not turning us into Voldemort is the only thing I can come up with how he helped us. It doesn’t count for much.”
“Yes, Draco,” Sirius said, nodding. “I’m actually quite sad for them, Narcissa and Draco. Narcissa was on the verge of coming to our side for a long time, but she was too loyal to her husband and the Black family. She couldn’t stand the fear of getting abandoned by them.”
“I don’t know. We just noticed we get along quite well, and one thing led to another and, well,” Harry said, not wanting to tell the whole story about their rather bumpy start from last autumn.
The spring is proceeding really fast compared to the other semesters in this story, mainly because both Harry and Draco are just brooding, heh.
“I trusted you!” Harry cried, grabbing Draco’s robes and pushing him against the wall. “I fucking trusted you! I should’ve known you wouldn’t ever be able to change. I should’ve known I could never trust you. I really cared for you, I fucking told you I love you, and all the time you’ve been on
So, the seventh year followed basically the book's storyline with some slight modifications that are mentioned in this story. And Ginny and Harry never happened.
Harry sat down on the table by the window and looked out. Ginny and Draco were sitting on the grass and they both seemed to be cooing to Teddy who was now on Ginny’s lap.
Leaving Harry behind had been probably the most difficult thing Draco had ever done. No matter how hard he tried to lure his mind to think about something else, it still kept replaying the last glance he had cast at Harry. Harry, who had looked so devastated, sad, and betrayed. Harry, who instead of only one person had lost two people that night.
“Compared to you I very well might be,” Molly said, smiling. “The War is over, Harry, you’ve got your whole life ahead of you. Now go and live it.”
As Harry was still talking with Ron and Hermione, Draco was on the seventh floor in front of the Room of Requirement, trying desperately to come up with how to get in. The weekend had been, well, trying, to put it mildly. Draco didn’t actually know at all what to think about Harry and about all the mixed signals Harry was sending to him. On the one hand, Draco didn’t remember the last time when he had felt so utterly happy and relaxed as when he had been laying on Harry’s lap, feeling the warmth of Harry’s body and Harry’s fingers buried in his hair. But on the other hand, Draco knew, or actually had known all along, that Harry didn’t want anything more than friendship to do with him. And that had hurt so much, especially when Harry had left from Andromeda’s and Draco had had more time to think about the whole situation. He knew he was being stupid, and he shouldn’t be just crying his life away, pining for Harry. He needed some sort of closure so that his mind could finally start letting go.
As they arrived at the Quidditch pitch after fetching their brooms from the broom cupboard, Harry, Ron, Ginny and Draco discussed shortly the rules meanwhile Hermione and Blaise walked to the stands, deep in the conversation and showing very little interest in the game.
Soon Malfoy’s mouth left Harry’s, and he started kissing Harry’s neck instead. Harry let out a strangled voice and tilted his head automatically to give Malfoy better access.
“They don’t know or understand magic, so it’s quite natural they’re afraid of it. When it comes to the purebloods, they tend to despise Muggles and Muggle-borns without any logical reason.”
“C’mon, we’ll just get the bottle and come back here. Not a big deal,” Harry said, nudging the hem of Draco’s shirt insistently.
Later that night, back in their hotel room, Harry and Draco laid on the bed, Harry already almost asleep whereas Draco was staring at the ceiling, caressing Harry’s bare stomach absentmindedly.
As Harry’s eyes found Teddy, he noticed the baby had apparently tried to mimic his kind-of-cousin’s appearance as he, too, had now a blonde and slightly wavy hair and twinkling, grey eyes.
his death, and he had to grudgingly admit that what Potter was saying made sense. “A pretty Slytherin move from you to make me agree to your plan by drawing my mother into this,” Draco said slowly. “So, what do you suggest?”
Draco considered Harry for a long while, and, to Harry’s relief, decided to accept Harry’s request by joining Harry under the Cloak and wrapping his arm around Harry’s waist to be able to stand as close to Harry as possible to make them both fit there.
“Well, then there’s probably something wrong with his phone,” Ginny said firmly. “Aren’t you going to open his present?”
At first, Harry flew as far away from the school as the Hogwarts’ wards let him. Usually flying reduced his stress as soon as he could feel the speed and see the ground get smaller and smaller as he flew higher up. Though that time his fury didn’t seem to let go that easily. He had to fly for a good while before he felt the tenseness to ease a fraction.
“Well, my stuttering isn’t really anything new, so I think everybody came prepared,” Harry said, grinning. “Though that Smith, or whatever his name was, didn’t seem that eager. I don’t even know why he bothered to come. Could have just asked me about Voldemort and Cedric at school,” Harry said, his voice turning a bit grumpy.
“That,” Draco said as he started kissing Harry along the jawline. “I, unfortunately, have to let you do all alone.”
“My father wanted to send me to Durmstrang so he made me study it during my homeschooling before Hogwarts. My mother didn’t want me to go that far away, so I came to Hogwarts instead,” Draco said, shrugging. “Don’t look that shocked, Norwegian isn’t that difficult. It’s a Germanic language so it’s a rather easy one to learn for English speakers.”
“Shh,” Draco shushed Harry, putting his forefinger against Harry’s lips. “You haven’t done anything wrong. You don’t have to be sorry for the things my father has done.”
Because he could feel someone’s warm breath tingling on his face and a pair of strong arms wrapped around him tightly. That felt nice, actually even nicer than floating. That made him feel safe.
Harry’s life was going a little better otherwise, too. He kept still on avoiding going to the wizarding places as much as possible, but instead of locking himself inside his home, he had started to visit different Muggle places with his friends. He had never learned to know the Muggle London that well, so he felt like a tourist there most of the time as they went to the movies, different restaurants, cafes, bars, and even museums. At first, Harry and Ron hadn’t been too thrilled when Hermione had proposed they would visit some of the most famous museums in London, but in the end, it had been worth it as seeing Ron and Ginny reacting to all kinds of Muggle things had been just so hilarious.
“Okay, that’s enough, I have to finish my Potions essay,” Hermione said, pulling back and wiping her tears.
“Malfoy? Oh, for fuck’s sake Malfoy you fucking idiot, what have you done?” Draco heard Potter crying alarmed from somewhere far away. “Malfoy, stay awake, okay? You stupid twat, just keep your eyes open,” Potter said, slapping Draco’s cheeks gently.
Hermione looked pleased. “I didn’t want to forget the Muggle schooling totally when I started at Hogwarts, so I’ve read quite a lot about history, different cultures and psychology in my free time. They’re really fascinating subjects, actually. There’re so many reminiscent patterns in the Muggle and Wizarding world, and no matter if you’re a Muggle or a Wizard, our brains function similarly.”
! And I still agree with you. There’re many cases like this in history, and, trust me, this way won’t lead to anything good. Instead, the gap between people will quite certainly become even wider, you just
Harry was indeed feeling quite happy. The previous day in Hogsmeade had gone better he had anticipated, and he had still a whole Sunday ahead, hopefully full of flying.
Draco snapped his eyes open and turned his gaze at Harry, looking suspicious. He considered Harry for a while and, without saying a word, lifted his head, moved it onto Harry’s lap and closed his eyes again.
The worry for Draco had affected Harry’s concentration during their last DA meeting before Christmas, but Harry knew he couldn’t blame it alone for what had happened. During the autumn many of his friends had hinted Cho might’ve some kind of feelings for Harry, but he had determinedly ignored those comments. His mind had been so full of Draco he had actually forgotten all about them. Now that he looked back, he felt himself a bit dumb.
“Hey, I forgot to tell you! I think I might’ve a place for us to practise Defense,” Harry said, desperate to change the subject.
The paperwork ended up taking three whole days as the Ministry seemed to be in no hurry with letting Draco go. He didn’t know how many times he had counted the grey stones on the wall before he was freed, but he was sure the number of them had imprinted in his mind for the rest of his life; there had been 127 of them.
“That was… really good. Amazing. I don’t even know how to call it,” Harry sighed when he felt like he could breathe again. He grabbed his wand and cleaned them both.
“I don’t think I know him,” Ginny said and sighed. “I’ll come. But I’m still really, really worried about you. This doesn’t sound like you at all, hanging out with Slytherins all of a sudden.”
“Let’s just stay here for the whole day,” Draco said as he slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth and slid his hands under the waistband of Harry’s trousers.
“Thank you,” Harry said sharply, cutting Molly short. “I really appreciate it, I do, but it’s in the past now. Not I nor Draco can change the decisions we made back then, so it’s better not to think too much about how things could’ve turned out. We’re here now, both alive. I’d rather concentrate on that.”
During one of Dumbledore’s lessons, Dumbledore had given Harry a homework of sorts: a task to get a crucially important memory from Slughorn. One could have thought it would be an easy task as Harry happened to be one of Slughorn’s favourite students of all times, but when Slughorn had realized what Harry was up to, he had become cold towards Harry and started to avoid him almost like a plague. Harry had tried to come up with different kinds of excuses to pass time with Slughorn, but the more he tried, the further away Slughorn seemed to slip away with his memory.
“Don’t you fancy her back?” Ginny asked, squinting her eyes at Harry. “At the Yule Ball, you seemed to be interested, asked her to be your date and all.”
Slowly, the worst peak of anxiety started to fade, leaving behind a heavy feeling of grief and exhaustion. Harry was so tired he couldn’t even find himself feeling angry anymore.
“You should give him a chance, Ron,” Hermione said, pointing at Ron with her fork. “What has he even ever done to you?”
“A bit shitty weather, otherwise fine,” Ron said, slumping on an armchair as Hermione sat down next to Harry on the couch. “Found some French Quidditch magazines with long articles about new Keeper moves. I must show them to you later, they look really cool!”
They ate and drank in silence, only Narcissa’s occasional and quiet sniffling and cutlery clinking against the plates breaking the otherwise death-quiet atmosphere. Draco felt like he couldn’t think or speak; the only thing he could concentrate on was eating the cake, drinking the coffee, and waiting for the moment to be over. But time had seemed to slow down, and Draco felt like they had sat there for hours now, every minute feeling longer than the last.
Harry raised his gaze to Malfoy’s face, just to see the Slytherin was watching him intently. Malfoy’s usually stormy grey eyes seemed to be much calmer now, as if there was a hint of warmth in them.
“Mm, yeah,” Harry muttered, pulled his wand out of the pocket, and cast a quick Warming Charm on both of them.
“Maybe it’s for the best if I get straight to the point,” Blaise said firmly. “I know about you and Draco.”
“So, shall we see if there’s been any progress? Which I, personally, doubt,” Snape snarled, without really expecting Harry to answer his question. “
“You must be an absolute horror. Or, well, that I knew already. But honestly Potter, the autumn has hardly started,” Malfoy said, still in a light and carefree voice.
When Draco had tossed Harry’s shirt aside and pulled him into a heated kiss, the doorbell rang all of a sudden.
Snape studied Draco for a moment, looking deeply into his eyes. “If you weren’t going to save yourself, I had to do it,” he said, squeezing Draco’s shoulder quickly and leaving from the balcony, black robes fluttering behind him.
“Min elskede,” Draco muttered into Harry’s mouth, still smiling. For the first time in months, it felt like everything might turn out to be okay after all. Draco knew that what they were planning was dangerous, but he couldn’t help but feel relieved as he knew he had made the right choice, and he’d finally be on the right side.
“I just came from outside, Potter. You must come up with something else,” Malfoy said, finding his usual, haughty voice.
When the tea was ready, Draco sat down on the table and looked out of the window into the darkness. Even though the days were still quite long, it was all too early to see even the break of dawn.
“What if my parents get to know? This is so fucked up, I don’t –,” Draco started rambling, sounding a bit panicked.
“No, nothing’s wrong. Did I interrupt something? What were you doing here?” Harry asked as he came to stand in front of Draco, making Draco feel like there were suddenly a thousand butterflies in his stomach.
Their movements became soon fast and erratic, and even Malfoy seemed to lose control over himself as he was now panting against Harry’s neck, mumbling gibberish, and thrusting wildly their cocks together in Harry’s lap.
“No, thanks, it’s fine. Maybe we could –” Ginny began but Andromeda cut her off, rushing downstairs and carrying Teddy in her arms.
“I mean it. Nobody really paid any attention to me, I was basically in my room or taking a walk somewhere nearby,” Draco said, confirming. “I’d prefer to hear more about
could have survived the place at all if the current conditions in the prison were supposed to be much better and more humane than before. The absence of Dementors helped possibly marginally but there were still so many other reasons to go nuts in a place like that.
“Yes. Malfoy’s going to live with us for a while, and no one else must know about it. Only the three of us are supposed to know he’s here,” Potter said strictly. “And could you be so kind and cook for Malfoy and obey him if he asks for something while he’s here?”
Actually, being able to think anything else than mortal danger felt still weird. Draco had become so used to think only about the survival, both his and his parents’ as well as Harry’s in the small ways he had tried to help him during the War, and it felt impossible to comprehend there was now a future ahead of him. A future full of common things, like studying and thinking about what kind of career he’d like to have and where he’d like to live. If he was completely honest, that kind of future still scared the hell out of him. Not because he wouldn’t want it; he hadn’t just realized it would ever be possible to happen for real.
,” Draco whined. “Don’t mind her, she’s always like this when we’ve got a guest with us,” he said, placing his hand on Harry’s thigh and squeezing it lightly.
“Should I be worried he looks like such a fan of yours already? Based on his appearance he could be your brother,” Harry said as he came to stand next to the blanket.
“Yes. It said a lot about how rotten this family is when she got kicked out. I just left voluntarily so no surprise I got burned from the tree but her? They made her choose between the man she loves and her own family. ‘Toujours Pur’, so she practically committed a sacrilege when she got married with a Muggle-born.”
He was used to seeing all kinds of dreams and nightmares. Even though the War had ended, the bad dreams didn’t seem to leave him alone. It was actually boringly common for Harry to wake up at some point during the night, sweating, screaming so loud his throat became sore, and his heart beating so fast it felt as if it was pounding out of his chest.
“Er, are you expecting me to say some sort of opinion about that?” Harry asked, watching the bottle with a raised eyebrow.
“Lily and James? Of course they’d have. Harry, you must believe me when I tell you the thing they wanted the most was you to be happy and loved. They wouldn’t have cared if it was a boy or a girl who made you happy as long as the person in question treated you well,” Sirius said, looking softly into Harry’s eyes. “So, do I know this boy?”
their best and Harry had simply no idea, what he could do anymore. He had definitely not wanted things to go this way. He hadn’t wanted the executions, he hadn’t wished for anybody’s death.
“Er, I think I should tell you something,” Harry murmured, turning crimson. “Could we go to the garden?”
There had still been a small photograph and a letter inside the gift. Harry grabbed them from the floor and sat down on the bed. He regarded first the photo, studiously. In the photo there were two small, maybe four or five months old babies, laying on a blue rag next to each other. One of the babies had a white-blond, beautifully wavy hair, while the other had a raven-black, utterly messy hair. The babies were apparently trying to pull each other’s hair as they giggled helplessly. Harry felt dumbfounded. The babies couldn’t be who he thought them to be.
“I know, but I’m just sure there’s still something going on. He wasn’t just having a nice little walk through Knockturn Alley,” Harry snapped.
“No problem at all, glad you finally got your Prince Charming,” Zabini said, grinning. “Well, I’m off now. It was a pleasure to chat with you. Draco. Potter,” Zabini said and left Harry and Malfoy.
“No, I’m sure he likes it,” Harry said. “Could you hold Teddy for a while? I’ll see that he’s doing alright,” he continued, giving Teddy to Molly and following Draco to the kitchen.
“We’ve already talked about how scary it must be to leave your family and the most of other social contacts you’ve got in your life. Otherwise, it’s just pure psychology.”
“No, Malfoy, of course I’m not…” Potter started, impatient. “Whatever. Come on, we don’t have much time.”
“Er, sure,” Harry said awkwardly, looking at his friends as though pleading them to say ‘no, Harry can’t, we’ve already got plans’, but everybody kept quiet. Harry wasn’t too eager to talk with Blaise as he was sure he knew what the Slytherin wanted to discuss.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “Seriously, Harry, you can’t keep it there if you don’t want everyone to get to know. It’s too massive.”
The next day Harry spent having his head in the clouds, and he barely noticed as his legs followed Ron and Hermione from one class to another. He hadn’t been able to sleep at all at night as his body had been all too awake and restless and his mind had kept coming back to the thoughts of Malfoy. He couldn’t believe the previous day had really happened, but when Malfoy had smiled at him quickly at lunch, he had become relatively sure it all hadn’t been just a dream or his imagination.
Ginny started to look a bit grim. She was definitely not content with how their side had handled things after the War, suspecting basically everyone who had as much as been at the same social gathering with a Death Eater
“I’d definitely hope so,” Draco muttered, placed his cup on the sofa table, and laid down on the couch, curling up into a ball, his head next to Harry’s thigh.
“To me it sounds like you made him choose between you and his family, and didn’t give him any other options,” Ron explained. “Mate, that’s a bit shit thing to do, you can’t just make people choose between you and their family.”
As Harry entered the room, he noticed Draco was leaning on the kitchen countertop, his shoulders shaking a little.
Oh well, so maybe Draco really had feelings for Harry on some level, but so what. They hadn’t clearly been enough because Draco had still been able to take the Dark Mark, even though he had known how much Harry hated Voldemort and how Voldemort’s side tried to kill Harry constantly. Nothing, absolutely nothing would ever make Harry accept taking the Dark Mark, and there was no way he could ever be with someone who was bearing it.
As soon as Harry and Ron managed to come through the fireplace, Molly pulled them both into a warm, tight hug.
He and Harry hadn’t talked to each other in many weeks now. After their argument about Draco choosing Voldemort’s side, Harry had kept his threat and given Draco exaggeratively much time and space to make up his mind. He had started ignoring Draco completely, not even glancing in his direction when passing by him on the corridors, eating at the Great Hall at the same time or sitting in the shared classes. He didn’t even appear in the Room of Requirement where Draco spent all his evenings, hoping for Harry to come and tell him how sorry he was and how he hadn’t meant a word he had said. Instead, Harry had seemed to have the time of his life without Draco around. It had been painful to see the Gryffindor boy babbling and laughing with his friends all around the school as if Draco had never been a part of his life. Only once had Draco managed to catch Harry’s eye, but instead of seeing the familiar playfulness and warmth glinting in his endlessly green eyes, he had met only coldness and emptiness.
“That’s quite understandable,” Hermione said, nodding. “He’s grown up with magic all around him since he was born; magic is such a huge part of his whole identity. But on the other hand, we don’t have to be exactly alike to feel connected to other people, that’s not how it works. People are so complex beings, we all are rather our own jigsaw puzzles. Some of our pieces resonate with people who have similar pieces in their puzzle, even though those people might seem completely different otherwise. And that’s the whole point with support groups, to find people you can feel connected with and with who you feel comfortable to share your story.”
“Firewhisky, obviously. But I think there isn’t left any,” Draco said, looking at the Muggle spirits suspiciously.
Harry stopped and turned around one more time. He gave Ron a tired but wide smile, the first real one for days. “I’m really happy for you, for real. We’ve got to celebrate this tomorrow.”
“I hate this, I hate all of this so much. I hate that I can’t tell you everything, I hate that I can’t disobey the Dark Lord and I
To Harry’s relief, someone knocked on the door before Harry had a chance to answer Sirius’s question.
Draco was running behind the Death Eaters, bringing up the rear. Snape glanced at him over his shoulder every now and then, but otherwise no one seemed to remember he was there with them as a part of their gang. Draco could have simply stopped and turned around. Only if his brain functioned properly because now it felt like there was room for only one thought: follow the others, follow Snape, do as the others say.
Draco hadn't even paid attention to his breath that had become too fast and shallow at some point. Slowly but surely Draco's breath became more even as he continued staring at Blaise's serene eyes and concentrating on Blaise's warm but strong hand on his shoulder.
Sirius studied Harry for a while before he said anything. “Are you worried I wouldn’t be okay with you seeing another boy?”
“Wow, Potter, really. Such sharp observation skills,” Draco said. “Tell me, Potter, is everything all right between you three?”
Malfoy snorted. “Oh please, as if you already weren’t drunk,” he said, sneering. “I was planning on tasting this another way.”
Before Harry even noticed, it wasn’t anymore Malfoy who was flying after him. Instead, they were both chasing each other in turns, doing more and more reckless moves as they dared the other one to follow suit.
That year the Christmas holidays were a much more pleasant experience than a year ago, as this Christmas no one was in immediate danger of dying. In spite of the war, this year Harry and his friends’ holidays consisted mainly of Celestina Warbeck’s newest hits, some relationship drama, and meeting various Weasley family and Order members, which definitely made a nice change to school and all the war-related conversations. The only thing that Harry didn’t enjoy too much was Scrimgeour’s visit to the Burrow as he had decided to ask if Harry could show publicly his support for the Ministry. Harry was so full of the Ministry and had no trust in it after everything that had happened last year, so he had refused straightaway and just walked away, fuming.
Harry watched as Malfoy held Harry’s hand with one hand and cleaned his small wound carefully with the other. Harry couldn’t make himself breathe, Malfoy was so gentle with his procedures and his fingers tingled on Harry’s skin as if there was some kind of magic flowing between them.
“They’re like, erm, a Muggle version of Aurors. You see, there are quite many careers in Wizarding World that have a Muggle equivalent,” Harry said, showing pictures of musicians, doctors, lawyers and shopkeepers. “And here are the firefighters,” Harry said, pointing at the picture of a man and a woman in bright red uniforms and a fire truck in the background.
“Er,” Harry said, blushing, while Draco snorted next to him, pretending to be annoyed but ending up sounding rather amused.
Harry felt Draco getting tensed immediately. “What do you mean by accidentally?” he asked, a pained look in his eyes.
“That doesn’t help much,” Harry muttered. He wished someone could just tell him what to do because he most definitely didn’t know what felt right and what he would be comfortable with.
“Oh, well. Frankly, there must’ve been something more to it. I think he was actually most likely trying to seduce you. A
“And you must be Ginevra Weasley,” Blaise said, taking Ginny’s hand and kissing the back of her hand elegantly. “Blaise Zabini, Draco’s friend. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Harry! Mate, come here!” Seamus yelled at Harry cheerily as he noticed him entering the room. “We’ve got firewhisky, vodka, tequila, rum… What would you prefer?” he asked, wrapping his arm around Harry’s shoulder and steering him towards a small table next to the hearth.
“That’s alright,” Harry said, putting his hand on top of Draco’s and interlacing their fingers together. “But no, nothing that weird. I guess the Medievalish school must be my weirdest experience.”
Maybe it wasn’t too late yet, maybe he could just turn to his side and dive back into the dream. None of his dreams had been particularly pleasant in recent years, or… well. Frankly said all of them had been just nightmares one after another, but maybe he would this time be able to see one that would be at least slightly more… tolerable. It wasn’t much to ask. Actually, he asked for nothing else but that there wouldn’t be Azkaban in his dream in any form. Maybe he could see one of his wartime dreams as they had already started to feel so familiar to him. Almost even safe and reliable, as if an old friend had just popped up to greet him. Not that Draco would have particularly enjoyed the wartime dreams but despite all the fear, agony, and despair, every single one of them was multiple times better than his current reality. In those dreams, he was still with his family. He was still at home.
“Well, I just started to study like two hours ago. You can’t expect me to be totally fluent by now,” Ron said, shrugging. “’Mione promised to help me to translate the magazines. And you can learn quite a lot just by watching, they’ve some really clear slow-motion pictures.”
?” Ginny cried, nonplussed, and Draco told Ginny and Blaise the whole story about Sirius and Narcissa meeting occasionally in secret.
Apparently, Draco was also feeling something as he had fallen into silence and had suddenly started breathing faster. Neither of them said anything as they didn’t seem to know how to be with each other when there was no third person with them.
Harry gave a short laugh and blushed slightly. He wasn’t sure whether or not he should be embarrassed by how dependent his daily routines were on his house-elf at this age. “Kreacher has really improved in cooking,” he muttered.
used to Ron’s snoring after all the shared years in the same dormitory, and even though it was sometimes quite nerve-wracking, Harry had noticed it had started to make him feel somehow warm and safe at some point. Like there were some things in the world that never changed.
The voice was now louder, more impatient, and maybe even a bit commanding, but Harry still couldn’t recognise its owner. Although, it
Snape glared at Harry, but Harry didn’t turn his gaze away. “You’re so much like your father, so arrogant, so full of yourself. He also cared only for himself and look what happened to him.”
?” Malfoy asked, bewildered as he finally let go of Harry’s hand. Malfoy looked worriedly around the classroom as if only now realizing that anybody could have seen him and Harry holding hands and gazing at each other in the eye like some lovesick teenage couple. Luckily, brewing the Strengthening Potion happened to cause a lot of steam and require sharp concentration, so no one could really see anything more but their own potion and their partner.
Harry came quietly to stand in front of Draco and pulled him into a tight hug. It was first then Draco realized he was shaking, too, and feeling actually so dizzy it was a miracle he was still standing.
“Thanks. See you in the common room, if there’s still something left of me after an hour,” Harry said, waving his hand and smiling gloomily at his friends before exiting the library.
Because Harry could now remember perfectly well how the night had ended, too. He could remember the anxiety taking over him all of a sudden and him pushing Draco away from him and telling him to leave. He could also remember how hurt and devastated Draco had looked like, his eyes storming as if in agony.
Draco nodded and beckoned Harry to sit down next to him as he started to hug his knees, looking apprehensive.
Harry’s face went bright red. “Shut up you wanker and sit down,” Harry snapped, sitting down on the rug and starting to slice the shepherd’s pie quite violently. “And I’m not a sap,” he continued as he handed Draco a plate with a slice of the pie.
Draco did as Harry asked, putting his mitten back on and giving the glasses back to Harry. Then Draco came to stand behind him, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and resting his jaw on Harry’s shoulder, his cheek against Harry's. Harry could hear Draco breathing and feel his frozen hair ends tickling the side of his neck.
“Harry, you can’t do like that!” Ginny said sharply. “Do you have any idea how Draco is feeling right now?”
Draco Malfoy appeared in the doorway of their compartment with a wide smirk on his face. Malfoy’s most loyal cronies, Grabbe and Goyle, were standing and sniggering beside him like two dumbheads that were frightening only because of their physical appearance. Harry had seen this encounter coming, but it didn’t make it any easier.
Harry took a couple of deep breaths and forced a casual look on his face before heading to the Great Hall.
“Er, I think I’d better head back to Gryffindor. Ron’s already quite mad at me as it is,” Harry said reluctantly and starting towards the staircase.
December evenings were cold and dark, and there was a thin layer of glistening snow on the ground. Sun had already set, so Harry could have taken the Cloak off of them, but he preferred to have it on to have an excuse to walk so close to Draco.
“No, I mean, yes, but I stayed behind. Tried to eavesdrop on Malfoy and his gang but he spotted me.”
“When exactly have you two become, like, best friends or something?” Harry asked, chuckling a little as he tried to make Draco stop feeding him.
Harry walked to stand next to Sirius and tried to follow his gaze. “Andromeda?” he asked when he noticed Sirius was looking at a burnt spot in the middle of Bellatrix and Narcissa.
Hermione threw the Prophet on the table so that Harry, Molly and Ron could see it. “Malfoy’s been disowned,” she said bluntly.
Harry gulped, feeling all too many emotions at the same time to be able to control them. “I think I love you,” he blurted out.
“Thanks, Gin,” Harry said, feeling truly thankful to her. “Should we go back inside?” he asked, shivering slightly as the sun had almost disappeared behind the horizon.
“I know, I know. Sorry Draco,” Anne said, giving Draco a small, apologetic smile. “But you’ve also gone to that same, odd boarding school as Draco, right? The one where people live like in the Middle Ages?” she continued, turning her eyes back to Harry.
that had changed. For one, they didn’t try to avoid each other as much as they had done earlier, which was quite relieving as now besides Ginny, Hermione also had started to hang out quite often with Draco. Harry didn’t usually join their company willingly, but on the other hand, he didn’t run away either if he accidentally found himself in the same group as Draco.
. Even Seamus had decided to take the Prophet’s side, so Harry couldn’t really calm down even in his own dormitory.
“Are you kidding? Of course I’d want to get back together with you. That should be quite obvious,” Draco said. “But how? How could you want me back after everything I’ve done? I’m not perfect, Harry. I’m still a complete mess.”
When Harry arrived at the Room, Draco wasn’t there yet. Harry stepped slowly around the Room, taking in all the small details from the light-grey-coloured curtains to the exact number of the pillows on the bed he had almost forgotten during the holidays. It was odd how a few weeks could feel like a lifetime, as if the last time Harry and Draco had been in the Room was months ago instead of weeks. So much had happened, so it felt a relief to notice that at least the Room had stayed comfortably the same.
Harry snorted. “We’ll see about that. Having private lessons with Snape doesn’t sound like a good start for the year.”
“Just wondering how to hex the git. Bet it was him who was the mastermind behind today’s episode,” Harry muttered, turning his gaze to his plate.
“Merlin, Potter, you’re unbelievable,” Draco said, giggling un-Malfoyishly. “So, do you want your Christmas gift or not?”
Draco gulped. “Merlin, you’re all ruining me. I had never felt this emotional before I learned to know you,” he muttered, making the others laugh.
Soon, however, Harry stopped dead when he noticed what Hermione’s face looked like as she came nearer. Her hair was a mess, her eyes were red and swollen, and there was a stream of tears glistening on her face.
“Hm, when we noticed we might’ve some similar, well, interests,” Draco said, putting the plate and spoon away and pushing Harry to lay down underneath him.
Draco froze as though he could feel Harry staring at him. He lifted his gaze, and for a split-second, their eyes met. Draco’s eyes seemed to be full of agony and worry, and he looked at Harry as if trying to tell him he was sorry and pleading for… What? Forgiveness?
“You’d better go now. You’ve done enough for one day,” Harry snarled, and this time, Draco didn’t follow him.
“Don’t be stupid, of course not,” Draco snapped and covered his mouth quickly with his hand, looking like he had already revealed too much information.
“Hey,” Harry said, taking Draco’s face between his hands and making him look Harry in the eye. “You’ve never been his and you’ll never be, Mark or not. You are your own unit in this utterly messed up universe. And no matter how and where this is going, I’ll stand by you, okay?”
“Wait, wait! I want to see too what the Golden Boy has bought to you,” Blaise said and came to sit on the other side of Draco. Harry rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything. Maybe he should ask Zabini if they could try the first-name basis, too.
“I know,” Draco said in a low voice, sounding guilty. “I’m not planning on doing something like that again.”
“Of course I am,” Draco snapped as if it was stupid of Harry to even suspect he wasn’t. “I can’t say the Dark Lord would’ve been happy about what happened at the Ministry, but he’s not paying any attention to me. He’s rather disappointed at my father, that’s what worries me the most.”
“Um, I can’t say I like it. But it isn’t your fault,” Harry said. “Is that why you stopped texting me?”
“Yeah, but I hadn’t really thought about that. I mean, when you told me I still thought you were seeing some nice Hufflepuff bloke.”
“I don’t think I can sleep anymore,” Harry said, sighing. “I’ll visit the Weasleys in a few hours, so you don’t have to cook me anything today.”
“I know. And I’m happy I’ve gotten the chance to get to know you now,” Andromeda said, giving Draco a small smile. “I think I’m off to bed. You can stay up as long as you like but turn off the lights when you go to bed, alright?” she went on, getting up from the armchair.
“You git! Now this is unfair!” Harry cried out as Draco managed to change their positions so that Harry was now laying under him.
“Of course I did,” Draco snapped. “My mother didn’t want me to take it either, but then the Dark Lord started to threaten my family.”
“No, you git. It’s just better to drink caffeine-free tea before going to bed or you’ll end up having another sleepless night,” Draco said, rolling his eyes.
“Seems like you are Harry’s biggest fan nowadays, Ferret. Can’t clearly keep your hands away from him,” Ron snapped at Malfoy.
” the voice continued, and now Harry felt someone shaking him lightly by his shoulders as he was still running in the greyness.
“If your so-called friends don’t want to be your friends anymore after what your parents did to you, they weren’t real friends to begin with,” Andromeda said. “What about the Weasley girl, Ginny? You seem to get along with her quite well.”
And then, suddenly, it hit him. All that had happened yesterday came flooding back to his mind; Umbridge, the Department of Mysteries, the Death Eaters, Voldemort, and Sirius. Sirius, who was no longer in this world.
When he felt like he was in control of his own body again, he opened his eyes slowly, just to meet Potter’s glinting, green eyes only a few centimetres from his own.
“I didn’t want to kill them! I never wanted anything to happen to Weasley or the Bell girl!” Draco cried, devastated, trying to take Harry’s hand, but Harry snatched it away.
“Well, from what I’ve gathered, the word Death Eater means someone who’s Voldemort’s follower and who bears the Dark Mark. It’s not like you take the Mark for fun, like a tattoo or something,” Harry said gloomily.
Granger entered the room, and looked around, hesitating. “Is it okay if I –” she asked, pointing loosely at the chair by Draco’s desk.
“Almost a whole week,” Harry said as his hands found to Draco’s hair. “Look, I wanted to ask you if you’d like to see me in the evening.”
Draco snorted. “And what exactly would you do if I told you I needed your help? Ride here on your broomstick like Prince Charming and get me out of here?”
“Right,” Harry muttered. He wasn’t sure what he thought about Ginny knowing. Somehow it made him feel as if
“Oh, right, I had almost forgotten you’re still ranting about these Death Eater executions,” Ginny said grimly. “Do you understand you’re defending Fred’s murderers at the same time? And Lupin’s and Tonk’s and who knows whose else? I don’t have a
The last day of June was definitely one of the worst days Draco had ever had. Maybe even the worst along with the day he had been forced to take the Dark Mark. He had known all along this day would come inevitably but he had still, maybe even a bit childishly, stuck to the hope that someone would save him. But no one had been able to do that, not even Harry or Dumbledore. Both of them had tried, making it sound so light and easy as they had repeated ‘let’s go and see Dumbledore, he can solve this’ and ‘come to the right side, Draco, we can save you and your family’. It had sounded so good, so tempting, and Draco had almost started to believe them. Almost. Because in the end, Draco knew there simply was no way to escape and hide from the Dark Lord, especially not as his mother was at the Manor full of Death Eaters and his father in Azkaban that hadn’t been under the real authority of the Ministry for a long time.
There was a small, brown owl hovering behind the window and carrying the Sunday’s Daily Prophet in its claws, looking at three of them curiously and hooting at them innocently.
That was until both Harry and Draco came violently crashing down, rolling over one another as they both had apparently forgotten how close to the ground the snitch had actually been.
Harry’s words remained hovering eerily in the air, meeting this time only an endless void. He suddenly got a feeling he was now very, very alone.
Apparently, Malfoy felt their gazes on him, and he lifted his own gaze to stare back at them. As he saw Ron and Harry smirking at him, he went pale and looked frightened. Malfoy seemed to be frozen to the spot until his fork fell from his hand making some of the food on his plate to fly right into Parkinson’s lap. Parkinson started to shout something at Malfoy, but he barely noticed. Malfoy got up hastily and fled the Great Hall without saying a word to his puzzled-looking friends. Harry frowned. Malfoy was acting utterly strangely, as if his and Harry’s mutual taunting was suddenly something totally new and alien to him.
“I just… I think it’s not cool to imply someone, you know, a teenager in our age could be a Death Eater. Not even Malfoy,” Harry muttered, avoiding his friends’ gazes.
Harry grimaced. “Wouldn’t really call them my family. They’re just people I’ve had to live with, we don’t really get along.”
When Draco opened the door, he froze on the spot, amazed. Of course, he had seen house-elves before as his family, and all the other proper pureblood families, owned a couple of them, but never had he seen this many in the same place.
Ron snapped his head up to look at his friend animatedly. It was stupid really how Harry hadn’t thought how easy it would be to cheer Ron up by making a simple phrase with the words
And then, with the last hard thrust, Harry came into his pants, Malfoy soon following him. Harry laid down, and Malfoy collapsed painfully on him.
“Of course. I had also thought about how I could be in contact with you during the holidays, but I couldn’t come up with anything. It’d be too dangerous to send owls as my father’s friends are practically living in the Manor nowadays. This is a perfect solution once I learn to use it.”
“I miss you too. But it won’t be long until we can be together again,” Draco said softly. “When are you going to the Weasleys?”
the Christmas holidays if it feels more appropriate then,” Ginny said as if reading Harry’s mind. “Just think about it. I’d be happy to help.”
Draco studied the picture carefully. “I bet this isn’t the picture that made you question your sexuality.”
“It’s all well and good, but could you please refrain from talking about me like I wasn’t present,” Draco groaned.
“Until someone’s going to give me a rational answer. I don’t understand Ginny at all, where have they even met?”
“Harry, would you have some time to talk?” Ginny asked as she was picking up the dirty dishes from the table, making Harry feel suddenly utterly nervous. He had indeed prepared himself mentally for Ginny most likely wanting to talk with him, but the day had gone so smoothly so far Harry had already lulled himself into the belief he maybe wouldn’t need to talk about anything difficult or awkward that day after all.
Before heading to the Room of Requirement Harry had decided to pop in the kitchens and ask if Dobby could fix him another picnic basket. Dobby’s face had lightened up and he had practically jumped from foot to foot of excitement to be able to make ‘the great mister Harry Potter’s’ Friday more enjoyable. Although, this time Harry promised to return the basket himself.
Draco’s gaze turned to pensive. “I don’t know, Harry,” Draco said. “But it’s not good to get mixed up with Muggles or Muggle-borns. They don’t know our culture or our ways of living. Besides, Muggles did try to persecute and kill us, especially during the 16th century.”
Zabini’s eyes widened. “Of courses I remember him, your father went, aa, a little mad after that episode,” Zabini said, turning his eyes to Harry. “That, I must say, was a positively slytherin thing to do. Can’t believe you weren’t sorted into Slytherin.”
“Yes, we took a walk, talked a bit. He’s not too bad as you said,” Ginny said, acting nonchalant but still having a rather pretty pink colour on her cheeks. “Have you talked to him after yesterday?”
“Hey, mate, nobody’s trying to say you haven’t done enough,” Ron said firmly, trying to make both of his friends calm down a little. “We just don’t get why you were okay with testifying in Narcissa’s trial, but Malfoy’s has been out of the question ever since it was first mentioned.”
?” Harry cried, feeling his head starting to buzz. This couldn’t be true, Hermione must have understood something wrong.
But why then had the dream felt like Malfoy really had been there, whispering into his ear and asking Harry to save him?
bad, he’s a teacher and wants only what’s best for you,” Hermione said, trying to comfort Harry, but making both Harry and Ron glare at her in disbelief instead. “Okey, well, maybe normal rules don’t apply to him.”
The rest of the holidays passed in bliss. The worry about Draco grew day by day, even though Harry was surrounded by people all the time. Ginny made her best to keep Harry busy at the Burrow, and he played a lot of Quidditch with the Weasleys and had a countless number of walks in the meadows. The daytime wasn’t too bad, but when the night fell, Harry found it extremely hard to get any sleep at all. There hadn’t been a single new message from Draco, and Harry couldn’t believe it would be because of the possibly broken phone or a dead battery. Ginny still tried to tell him everything always seemed to be much worse in a dead of night, but he couldn’t let go of an odd feeling there must be something else, something that had gone seriously wrong.
Harry squirmed a little guiltily. “Actually, I’ve already told Ginny about us. Or she kind of guessed I’m seeing someone, and I didn’t deny it.”
It was again one of those nights when Draco could not sleep. He was sweating and rolling hours around in bed, trying to make himself relax, but in vain. Finally, he gave up, sighing and pulling his wand from under the pillow to cast Tempus; it was only 3:23 am.
“Oh yes. They both got married to decent, pureblooded men, and Narcissa produced even an offspring.”
“All the more reason to seduce you. He’s obviously trying to bond with you over your similar experiences,” Ron said, still grinning teasingly. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch, you know.”
Draco's friends had commented a couple of times on his constant need to embarrass Potter and to get a reaction out of the Gryffindor, and Pansy and Blaise had gone even as far as to call it an obsession of sorts. Though of course there was no way Draco would be obsessed. Potter was just so utterly annoying and arrogant and basically just begging for problems all the time, so Draco couldn't help but continuously bring the git back down to earth. Someone had to do it.
Right after it, it hadn’t felt so funny, though. Harry had had a hard time concentrating on the classes after lunch, and his friends had been shooting worried glances at him the whole afternoon. However, by dinner time, he had finally felt almost like himself as the excitement of seeing Draco in the evening had hit him, making butterflies fly all around in his stomach. He had even been able to laugh genuinely and take part in the conversation at the Gryffindor table, which had made at least Hermione look relieved.
“You haven’t eaten anything today,” Harry tried again, but the expression on Draco’s face didn’t show the slightest change.
“Right,” Hermione said, giving Harry a calculating look. “Should we go to dinner? I can’t get anything more done today anyway.”
As soon as Harry had made it back to Hogwarts, he rushed to the Room of Requirement, but Draco wasn’t there yet.
“Yeah. It’s like… A group with really strict rules and traditions you have to follow. You can’t be different, do anything differently nor express different opinions if you want to remain as a member of the group. If you don’t follow those rules and traditions, you might be kicked out of the group. That’s usually a really traumatic experience because the group may be your whole world. I mean like your whole family, all your friends and everything you’re familiar with may be in it. But if you decide to stay in the group, you may have to act that you’re something you’re not or that you think exactly like them even if you didn’t, and it’s usually even more traumatic in a long run than leaving the group.”
“Besides, you two picking fights with Malfoy and his gang wouldn’t really help you to get permission to play Quidditch if Umbridge got to know about that.”
. Harry knew he had a lot of people who liked him, but he had never experienced someone caring about him on such a deep level as Draco did. Actually, he hadn’t known that kind of caring even existed. Draco was being so gentle with him, always telling him how wonderful he was and making sure Harry was okay and liked what they were doing. He let Harry see him in a totally new light, showing how much he wanted to be near Harry and how much he enjoyed Harry touching him. He let Harry see also his agonizing moments when the fear of other people’s thoughts about them and what they meant to each other pulled him into the darkness. Draco didn’t flee anymore, but Harry could see the pain and the fear creeping onto Draco’s face, making his body tremble slightly and his breathing getting ragged. When that happened, Harry used to wrap Draco tightly in his arms and whisper comforting words into Draco’s ear until he calmed down and melted into Harry’s embrace.
“No, I’m fine. Met Tonks on my way here and she fixed my nose,” Harry said, annoyed. “It looks alright, doesn’t it?”
“Yes, of course, Dobby would be honoured to keep Harry Potter’s secret. But is Harry Potter sure he is safe in master Malfoy’s company?” Dobby asked, looking at Draco with worried eyes.
“This must be the time of my life, I’ve never gotten this much attention before,” Blaise said, pensive. “Don’t worry, Mad-Eye’s not working here anymore and no one else has the ability to see where your hands are wandering under the table.
For Harry the last lesson of the day, and actually of the whole semester, was Potions. After the previous day’s incident at the Christmas party, Slughorn seemed to feel pity for Draco and pay more attention to him than usual. Similar to the other subjects, Draco was lagging seriously behind on Potions as well, which was highly abnormal to him. As Harry was now the class’s top student, Slughorn seemed to think it wouldn’t cause any harm to pair the two of them together.
“Erm, okay?” Potter said, sounding confused. “I mean, there’s a bathroom in your room,” he went on, pointing at the dark mahogany door on the left side of the door that led outside of the room.
Harry looked down at Draco who was already staring at him with a determined glint in his eyes. “I do believe you.”
adorable, don’t even try to deny it,” Draco said, smirking. “Have you tasted the treacle tart yet?” he asked Harry.
“Well, that’s the least I can do for her. She has helped me so much,” Draco said, shrugging. “And I do like being with Teddy, even though he’s a bit of a monster,” he said, grinning at the child who was giggling in Harry’s arms now. “How did it go with the Weasleys?”
Harry didn’t say anything. He had already complained so much about not being informed properly about anything last summer. He agreed with Ron, obviously, but somehow he was getting used to Dumbledore ignoring him and almost all the other Order members treating him as a child.
“Oh,” Harry said, confused. He didn’t take it badly anymore every time someone new got to know about him and Draco or about him preferring blokes in general, but he wasn’t completely comfortable with that either. At least not yet. “Well, it was a bit of a surprise when he came to open the door.”
, Harry thought and snorted. What stupid could Harry even do? A couple of beers wouldn’t surely make him lose control over himself. As proof, he started walking towards the drinking table as casually as he could. Which probably wasn’t casually at all, taking into account the curved path he took even though he was sure he was walking straight.
“Thanks, I s’pose,” Harry mumbled, eyes still fixated on his cup, but Seamus had already disappeared into the crowd.
“Harry, I can see there’s something bothering you. Spit it out,” Hermione said firmly with her all-knowing look.
“Hi,” Harry whispered, touching lightly Draco’s thigh under the table when Draco came to sit next to him.
They fell soon into silence, both concentrating on their own tasks. Harry couldn’t help glancing at Malfoy from time to time, studying the Slytherin now that they sat so near one another. He noticed that Malfoy was still seemingly stiff and the Slytherin’s shoulders were high up. Though that didn’t apparently affect Malfoy’s potions skills because their potion looked precisely as it was supposed to look at this point. Gradually, Malfoy’s shoulders lowered and the frown between his eyebrows eased. Harry was surprised to remark how much easiness soothed Malfoy’s sharp features. One could say Malfoy looked even kind of benevolent then. Harry wondered how much more it’d soothe Malfoy’s features if he just let his white-blonde hair fall loosely around his face. Maybe his hair had even waves.
“Ah, but Draco, is this how you greet your father? I’ve certainly taught you better than this,” Lucius said, clicking his tongue disapprovingly. “Did you honestly believe the Dark Lord would have left us there? I’ve been out for days now. And as for what I’m doing here…,” he said, giving Harry a cold and calculating look. “I came to ensure my son doesn’t do anything… imprudent.”
“You might be right,” Hermione said, pensive. “Did you know, Ginny? You passed quite a lot of time with him when you started dating Blaise.”
“The Dark Lord wasn’t happy with my father as he had screwed up his plan and landed himself in Azkaban, so he wanted me to become some kind of a replacement for my father.”
When the Second Wizarding War was still going on, the world seemed to be divided into two parties: there were good and bad, light and dark, right and wrong. There was no grey area or middle ground, everybody had to choose their side. One side of the War was the dark side, represented by people whose souls were so black they would never be able to see or do anything good in their lives. And then there was the light side that practically bathed in goodness and justice. They overflowed with faith in fairness, human rights, peace, and democracy. They chanted empty phrases that were meant to strengthen the light side’s faith in their cause. They were the goodness, they were the justice. They wanted equality, and only they knew how the Wizarding community should be led.
I don't know if anybody agrees with me on this, but swimming in cold water really is super relaxing. Haven't done it in a couple of years now, but when I used to do it more regularly, it always made me more relaxed than yoga or meditation. :D
“Thought last night was just another dream,” Draco said, opening his eyes again and staring Harry into his eyes.
“But there’s always a risk. I can’t risk my parents’ lives, I just can’t,” Draco said, looking devastated.
Draco sat down on the edge of Harry’s bed, his posture relaxing a little. “So, what kind of a roommate is Weasley? Snores a lot?”
They began to move extremely slowly forward. First out of Draco's cell into a narrow, dimly lit corridor. Then to the right, then to the left, then up the stairs and to the right again… After a moment, Draco had no longer the slightest idea where Potter was leading him as all his energy went into trying to stay conscious. If only his father could see him right now, trusting blindly Harry Potter, leaning on the goddamned Saviour as if his life depended on him. Well, it kind of did depend on the prat, to be honest. Lucius Malfoy would probably turn in his grave.
“I’ll visit the Owlery, I want to see how Hedwig’s doing,” Harry said quickly, stepping towards the front doors after dinner.
And Harry was scared, too. It almost hurt to let someone come that close, knowing how much Draco could hurt him if he wanted. Draco had always had the skill to be able to crawl under Harry’s skin, but the way he did it now was something Harry didn’t know how to handle anymore, and it made him fear more than he even wanted to admit to himself. If he was honest, he would have wanted to be near to the other boy almost constantly, and the classrooms, the corridors and the Great Hall felt like such a bittersweet contrast to Harry and Draco’s time together as Harry wasn’t allowed to touch Draco at all, let alone show any other feelings towards him than hatred and disgust.
The sensation ended always as quickly as it had begun, and Draco's feet would probably have slipped as they arrived at their new destination if Potter hadn't held him so tightly.
After his weekend getaway, Harry started acting like a bloody lovesick teenager again. He found it hard to sleep and eat, and now not only because of the war memories but also because he felt just too excited, restless, and giddy all the time. All he wanted was to be with Draco but when he was with him, he felt like his tongue got twisted and he was suddenly feeling too warm and his heart was beating too hard in his chest. And being with Draco was never enough, anyway, because Harry wanted to touch him so badly, to play with his hair, to run his finger on his face, to pull him into his arms, to kiss him, tasting how he tasted like… But Harry couldn’t do any of those things because they were supposed to be friends. Just friends.
Or was there? Harry took the ring Draco had given to him from under his shirt and started to spin it on the necklace. Now that he thought about it, it wouldn’t be so stupid after all to think Draco could actually care about him. How they had spent so much time together, sharing their lives, touching one another and discussing everything between heaven and earth, it couldn’t be only an act or a very elaborate plot. Besides, they had also hung out a lot with Blaise and Ginny, so this couldn’t be anything Harry would’ve only imagined inside his head.
“Not so fast, Draco,” Snape snapped. “You must have already heard from Potter what we’re doing here anyway. He actually just showed me some rather interesting images of you two.”
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, enjoying the feeling of Malfoy’s finger moving lightly around his lips.
Harry had pondered a lot about what there could be wrong with Draco. He knew Draco knew something about the cursed necklace, although he didn’t know what exactly, and how active role Draco had played in the whole case. What was more, Harry had noticed Draco spent a ridiculously huge amount of time probably in the Room of Requirement as he disappeared from the Map quite often, and Harry was rather sure Draco wasn’t only in his and Harry’s room when he was there. Harry couldn’t just come up with any ideas of what Draco might be doing there, and there was no way he could ask Draco about it. He was already feeling somewhat guilty of spying on Draco behind his back, but he had rationalized that if Draco couldn’t tell him what he was up to, maybe it would be okay if Harry found out by himself. Then Draco wouldn’t have to break his promise not to tell, so Voldemort wouldn’t harm Draco nor his parents, right?
“Oh, rubbish. We all deserve a chance to loosen up a little,” Seamus said, waving his hand dismissively before he seized a cup. “So, we’ve got Ogden’s, Absolut, Russian Standard, Brugal –”
Draco's breath became quickly faster and more shallow, and he felt suddenly as if an invisible hand had come to squeeze his throat. Merlin, if he just could get rid of the Mark somehow.
Draco shook his head slightly, trying to come back to the present moment. He glanced at the frozen lake once more with new determination in his gaze before he started to head back to the castle. Now Draco had a plan to follow, and he knew he was capable of doing it.
“I think so,” Harry said. There was at least something good about being at the Dursleys for the beginning of the summer as there was no magic disrupting the mobile phone signal.
“I don’t know where that absurd idea of yours comes from, but he was most certainly not trying to, erm, seduce me,” Draco said quite stiffly. “He was just trying to be nice. We’ve got quite a lot in common.”
By the end of September, Harry could honestly say he felt rather happy with his life. Or at least much happier than he had anticipated he could feel, all things considered.
“Nothing, it’s all fine,” Draco said, avoiding Harry’s gaze and starting to fiddle nervously with his left sleeve. Harry vaguely remembered it was the same arm Draco had jerked away from Madam Malkin’s hands when she had touched it.
“Bullshit. You do know mum, she’s only happy when she gets to feed you,” Ron said, grinning. “I think I should go, I promised to help George at the shop,” he went on, getting up from the chair. “See you tomorrow!” he said, waving his hand as he started to walk towards the front door.
“That’s a really beautiful idea,” Ginny said, giving the letter back to Harry. “Should I put it on your neck?”
“What are you doing?” Ginny asked and jumped on the couch next to Harry. “Oh, mobile phones!” Ginny cried out eagerly before Harry had time to hide them.
Suddenly, Draco felt the tears pricking his eyes. Fuck. The last thing he wanted was to start weeping for losing his parents; he had already done that a lot during the days when he had wandered lost and aimlessly along the streets in the Muggle London. Draco felt just so angry with himself. Why did he have to cry for people who had just ditched him on the street using the most humiliating manner one could think of?
Harry felt his face blushing, and not only because of the alcohol. “What are you doing here anyway?” he blurted out.
If Draco had to try to find something positive in the whole situation, he thought the War had made at least something shift inside his head. He couldn’t put his finger on what exactly had caused the change during the War; probably it was the War itself and the constant fear of death, or maybe it was his whole family surviving and not needing to fear for them anymore, but what was sure was that he knew something had made him see his own life differently. He had hidden for his whole life, lived only some sort of half-life, and he didn’t want to do it any longer. He had gotten another chance as he had not died during the War, and he wanted to seize that chance and try to start finally living as a more complete version of himself. Draco didn’t know
Eventually, they couldn’t ignore the slowly creeping cold anymore as they both were shivering wildly.
“Erm, well,” Harry said, feeling uneasy. “It was just a dream as I said, and I don’t actually even remember that much about it,” he lied. The dream had been so distressing he didn’t feel at all like talking about it with anyone right now. “Er, what time is it?”
“Please, don’t call him that. He may have not lost his surname but it’s still a sore spot to him,” Andromeda said, hustling around the kitchen. “Sit down.”
“Thank you,” Blaise said simply as Harry gave the package to him. He opened the package, took one of the Chocolate Frog boxes and put the Frog instantly into his mouth. “It’s been ages since I ate these the last time. Didn’t remember these taste this good.”
I'm sorry my updating has been quite sporadic with this story. I hadn't realized how busy this autumn would turn out to be so I haven't had nearly as much time for writing as I would've wanted. Right now updating once a month seems like a realistic pace for me, maybe even twice at some point. Thanks for bearing with me :)
Draco Malfoy was walking towards the Slytherin table, Pansy Parkinson clinging tightly to his arm. As they sat down next to each other, Parkinson took Malfoy’s plate giggling and started filling it. When she put the plate back in front of Malfoy, she kissed him eagerly on the mouth, putting her hands on his cheeks. Malfoy didn’t pull back. Instead, he seemed to be kissing Parkinson as eagerly as Parkinson was kissing him.
in Azkaban. His father would have obviously been supposed to end up there for years but as he had been physically so sick and weak after the War, Wizengamot had decided to send him to carry out his sentence at the Manor instead, on the condition that he would have no guests, no servants, and he would not get to go out of the Manor grounds. The new Ministry might be suspicious and prejudiced, yes, but not cruel.
“I told him,” Ginny said before Blaise had time to answer. “I hope that’s okay, I mean, it’s hardly a secret anymore.”
Harry felt like floating in the air, free and weightless. It was a good feeling, as if he never had to feel anxious or worried or sad again. As if nothing could ever touch him or hurt him.
“Don’t bother, Draco,” Lucius said, speaking over Draco and raising his hand to quieten him. “I already know all about your proclivities and your illicit, little romance. Did you really think you could hide this from us?”
“Please, don’t call him Weasel,” Harry groaned. “But yes, I told Ron the next day after telling ‘Mione.”
“Nah, I think I’m sticking with lover as long as I don’t know his real name,” Ginny said, grinning. “Are you worried?”
Harry turned his face towards the Slytherin table. He saw Malfoy poking absently at his food, while Parkinson and Zabini were talking excitedly, probably about the Gryffindor’s nightmarish Quidditch practise. Parkinson tried to get Malfoy’s attention by waving a hand in front of his face, but the git just stared and snapped something, looking annoyed. Harry thought it was strange since Malfoy had been quite obviously enjoying himself just a moment ago on the Quidditch pitch. The git’s mood seemed to change like day and night in a matter of minutes.
“Well, I actually didn’t have to use money at all as a friend of mine from the group, Chris, demanded to buy me drinks when he heard I had never tasted any of the stuff they were selling there. And it wasn’t that bad! Not at all as bad as the stuff that Finnegan made us drink,” Draco said, grimacing.
When the War ended, all the surviving Death Eaters were locked in Azkaban to wait for the trials. The trials, that never came. It was only a week since the War had ended when the Wizengamot decided, both on its members’ as well as almost the whole light side’s behalf, that every single person who bore the Dark Mark would be sentenced straight to death without trials as
“Thank you,” Harry said and took Draco’s hand tentatively. “I think we should make some ground rules, though.”
Harry couldn’t say anything as he was suddenly feeling all too guilty and so, so selfish. Snape had been right all along; he really
“That’s alright,” Hermione said calmly. “Well, I don’t know this person, so I can’t say for sure, but I think he might be trying to protect himself by being nasty towards you. It’s quite natural, actually. When a human being feels they are in danger, they usually act based purely on their instincts, and one common way to act instinctively is to attack. When you’re gay, let alone a teen-aged gay, you may feel really exposed and vulnerable, and you might not be able to control how you vent your feelings. It doesn’t mean it’s okay if he’s being mean to you, but it may explain it somewhat. Maybe he’s afraid of letting people know who he really is, so he might be trying to hide his feelings.”
But the thing that had helped Harry the most had probably been seeing Teddy. It was actually quite bittersweet to see him as he reminded Harry a lot of his own past, which is why he wanted to make sure Teddy would get as good a childhood as he could with a lot of loving people around him. Besides, even despite Teddy’s background as an orphan, it felt still so good and refreshing to regularly see someone who was so full of energy and completely unaware of all the horrors that had taken place during the past few years. Seeing Teddy getting excited about basically everything he saw around him made also Harry feel like maybe there still was something beautiful and good in the world.
“Let’s have a walk, shall we?” Blaise said and they stepped out of the front doors into the courtyard.
As Harry had guessed, Hermione and Ron had interrogated him about his last night’s whereabouts as soon as Harry had stepped into the common room. To Harry’s surprise, they seemed to buy Harry’s explanation of him going late to bed and waking up early as both Ron and Hermione had, apparently, gone to sleep before midnight. And once Ron fell asleep, not even a pack of wild Hippogriffs running through their dorm would make him wake up. Harry had sighed of relief, although he knew he should be much more careful in future if he wanted to make the thing between him and Draco work out.
Hermione let out a strangled voice and pulled Harry into a hug. Neither of them said anything for a long while as they sat still, Hermione sobbing on Harry’s shoulder and Harry patting her head a bit clumsily.
“Yeah, yeah, right, thanks,” Ron said, blushing violently. “See you soon, mate. Don’t do anything stupid,” he said and started walking zigzag towards the apple trees.
After dinner, Harry had gone to the common room, packed his bag and told Ron and Hermione he had planned to hang out with Ginny for the whole evening, and Ginny, to his relief, had been eager to cover up for him after she had got to tease him for a while about his ‘tryst’, as she had called it.
The next morning Draco woke up startled, his body cold sweaty and trembling all over. He took a few deep breaths in and out, trying to make his too rapidly beating heart calm down and his somewhere completely elsewhere wandering mind come back to this moment and this place. The white canopy of the four-poster bed, clean, dark blue sheets, a warm and soft blanket, and a window that let the morning sun shine into the room, lighting the room with its soft and warm rays.
Harry gulped. “But you said you weren’t worried about Voldemort getting to know about us, you said so last year,” he said stubbornly.
They laid down, Draco’s head resting on Harry’s chest and Harry’s arm snaking around Draco’s chest while his other hand started stroking Draco’s hair. Neither of them said anything for a while, Harry just enjoyed the feeling of having Draco close to him again, smelling his familiar scent and hearing him breathing serenely.
“So did I. I meant it when I said I couldn’t stand a moment longer in that rat hole. Can’t believe Sirius has been there for months without going out.”
heard about the electricity before. I just didn’t know how it works,” Draco grunted, looking a bit sour.
“It was my fault,” Draco said before Harry had time to answer. “I made him take the troll for a moment.”
“Ginny’s right,” Blaise said calmly. “You can’t just kiss people and then push them away. You owe Draco an explanation.”
Harry knew he couldn’t go on like this, not for long or he would burst out. But there was too much on his mind as it was, and it felt impossible and scary even to consider letting his emotions loose
“Morning,” Potter said and stepped into the room. “Did you manage to get some sleep?” he sounded so mechanical, as if he had had to plan and practise exactly what he’d say to Draco and in which tone.
Harry had never been a big fan of clichés, but right that moment the only thought in his mind was that Draco looked like an angel, fallen straight from the sky. His slightly wavy hair was spread out on the pillow, glistening in the morning sun, and the look on his face was emanating serenity. Harry wanted to touch him so badly he started to ghost his forefinger over Draco’s rose-coloured lips, not wanting to wake him up.
Blaise looked like he didn’t know if he should be more astounded by Harry using his first name or Harry giving him something as a Christmas gift.
He didn’t even care when someone threw a few pebbles towards him, probably because they thought he was looking ridiculous in his white, not-very-Muggle-like clothes.
“Yeah, yeah. Keep telling that to yourself,” Zabini said. “But honestly, I wish you could be yourselves around me.”
Harry took his phone from the pocket and regarded the screen. There were, indeed, eleven new messages, all from Draco. As if Harry had anyone else’s number on the phone.
Harry felt like his body was totally paralyzed, and he obeyed the other boy without blinking twice. Malfoy tilted the bottle and poured a little bit of wine into Harry’s mouth. Then he closed Harry’s mouth gently with his elegant fingers, the grey eyes not leaving Harry’s gaze even for a second.
“Gin, would you like to take a walk with me?” Harry asked as soon as he found her sitting in the common room with sour-faced Ron and Hermione. “Oh. Sorry. Did I interrupt something?”
The idea of Molly giving Draco a Weasley sweater is borrowed from alizarincrims0n's fic 'Temptation on the Warfront'.
But they had both been wrong. Draco knew that for the most part of his life he really had been weak and a coward who had just tried to create a mask or a disguise that would tell a story about him as a confident, strong, and brave wizard. But eventually, his mask had cracked and broken completely in the final stages of the War, revealing the scared, weak, and insecure teenage boy who had been hiding behind it the whole time. He was still weak, now both mentally and physically, but he wasn’t a coward. Not anymore. He knew he was going to die tomorrow but to his own surprise, he didn’t feel fear. He felt bitter about how everything had turned out and he was sad because he had to give up his life before it had properly begun, but despite all that he had been able to make peace with his destiny.
Harry was laying on the couch in the Room of Requirement, eyes closed and a pillow on his face. He didn’t know why he had wanted to come here of all places. Maybe because he wanted to have a moment of peace, which was obviously an unrealistic wish to even consider when combined with the idea of the Gryffindor common room. Or maybe because he hoped, somewhere deep inside, that Draco would appear here after his inquisitorial duties. For what, that Harry didn’t know yet.
Even so, he couldn’t ignore the slowly growing fear that had started to invade his body, cell by cell. If Harry could, he would’ve loved to take hold of the naïve belief that everything was fine, but he knew better by now. Nothing was, and nothing would be, as it used to be.
“Just let it out, it’ll help,” Andromeda said, patting his arm comfortingly. “Would you like to have some more tea?”
“Yes, it’s lovely in here,” Harry agreed, taking a few steps to the terrace and knocked on the door.
“Er, yeah, Potter is right, no need to bow,” Draco said, and Dobby straightened his position right away.
“Harry!” Hermione’s voice cut him short, and both Harry and Ginny turned their gazes quickly to the girl who was half-running towards them.
“You are seriously okay with this?” Harry asked, still incredulous. He had thought it’d take some time for Draco to get used to the idea, but he had apparently already had his time.
Draco felt almost amused. Of course they’d get caught and Potter and his great escape plan would come to an end before it had properly even started, only a couple of pitiful corridors and one staircase from Draco's cell.
“Maybe a little gay,” Harry said, and Malfoy returned his hand on Harry’s achingly throbbing cock. “Oh, yeah, definitely a little gay.”
Harry let go of Malfoy’s robes stepping backwards, and he felt immediately strangely cold as the git’s body wasn’t pressed against his own anymore. Harry glanced at Malfoy once more and saw the Malfoy mask back in its place.
Harry sighed and kissed Draco’s cheek. “I know you didn’t want to hurt me,” Harry said. It was strange how fast things could change. It was only two months ago Harry would have been sure the Slytherin stood firmly behind his words, wanting to hurt Harry as badly as possible.
This summer was somewhat better than the previous one also because Harry didn’t feel completely cut off the Wizarding world, which was mostly thanks to him and Draco being able to be in contact with each other. Usually, they only texted to one another, but one evening Draco surprised Harry by trying to call him.
“You know, Kreacher isn’t really the same as he used to be a few years ago, Mum. He actually seems to
“You’ve read the Daily Prophet already?” Hermione asked, eyes flaming as she waved the day’s Prophet in her hand.
But Draco had been wrong. Now that Harry thought about it, Draco had probably been making false promises to himself as well.
Potter glared at Draco, eyes shooting daggers. “Fuck you, Malfoy,” he said through gritted teeth, turned on his heels and slammed the door shut right in front of Draco’s nose. Draco held his breath for a while and listened to Potter stomp down the stairs and slam the front door shut as violently as Draco’s bedroom door ten seconds before.
“What’s going on?” Harry whispered as soon as they had found a secluded corridor that was far enough from all the students rushing here and there.
good reason for this,” Draco snapped angrily, breaking the kiss. “Here,” he said, throwing the shirt back at Harry. “I’ll go and tell the whoever there is to sod off. You come when you’re dressed.”
Unwillingly, Draco took his pastry fork with a shaking hand and started to eat. The cake was probably as delicious as it looked like, but he couldn’t taste it at all. He felt like eating paper; he was just opening his mouth, chewing, and swallowing, not really realizing or caring about what he was putting into his mouth.
“Harry, you don't know how much I’ve missed you,” Draco murmured as he kissed Harry. “How much I’ve missed this,” he went on, grabbing Harry’s collar and pulling him closer.
“Hey Ginny,” Harry said as he abruptly remembered something that had bothered him for some time now. “Can you speak any Norwegian?”
Potter turned his gaze to the sky as well. “They’re searching too high up. It’s too foggy and cloudy, they can’t see clearly what’s happening down here.”
“This feels like too stark of a contrast to last weekend,” Ginny said, closing her book with a silent thud. “Hey Harry, did you manage to talk to Draco?”
“Merlin, Potter, stop sneaking around like that,” Draco said, startling a little. “Sit down, it’s your turn to hold this beast.”
Hermione sent a murderous look in Ron’s direction. “Don’t listen to him, Harry. I think you were really brave and a great example of the House unity.”
“Do you want to add something to Blaise’s story, then?” Ginny asked curtly, but the look in her eyes had softened quite a lot.
“Harry, you’re surely well aware it’s not even December yet?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow as he sat up.
“Sounds tempting,” Harry murmured, breaking the kiss. “But I really must go now before Ron and Hermione come looking for me.”
“Luna, Gin, and Ollivander are going to testify for him, and you guys are going to be there, too. You were there every time I saw Malfoy last year, you know just as much as I do,” Harry said, putting his glass of Molly’s homemade strawberry juice on the table rather violently.
Andromeda gave Draco a small smile, her eyes glinting with tears. “The best way to thank me would be if you just let yourself be happy and accepted the kindness people are showing to you. Don’t let your past determine your future, Draco.”
“Yes, this is her old house. I could show you your room?” Potter said, sounding somewhat impatient and tired as he started to steer Draco towards the staircase.
“Shh,” Harry said, putting his forefinger against Draco’s lips. “This isn’t fucked up, and you know it. Those thoughts come from other people, but it doesn’t mean they’d be the truth. The only thing that matters is our truth. What happens between us is no one else’s business. Besides, your parents aren’t going to get to know. No one is.”
. Let me handle this myself, please,” Draco snapped. “But Harry’s right. I’m not coming back into your life. I’m not coming back to the Manor nor to the pureblood society. If you want me to be part of your life, you’ve got to come into
“But you had used electricity before at least, hadn’t you?” Anne asked and Harry nodded, confused. “I mean, let me tell you how priceless Draco’s face was when I mentioned it for the first time. His expression was a pure mix of fascination and fear.”
When Harry woke up, it took him a while to orientate himself. He didn’t know if he had ever felt so light and calm when waking up, as if he had been flying or laying under the stars for the whole night. When he realized he could hear Draco breathing peacefully next to him, smell his applely scent all around him, and feel Draco curled up with him, radiating warmth, he smiled.
“Please, just Draco,” Draco said awkwardly and crouched to the same level as the elf. “Do you happen to know anything about Harry?” Draco asked with a low voice. He didn’t really believe the house-elves would gossip, but one could never be too cautious.
Being back with Draco wasn’t all the time a bed of roses. Some days both Harry and Draco felt a bit tense or grumpy and therefore didn’t know how to act around each other. Some days they were both in such a bad mood they snapped at each other over the smallest things. And some days they even had quite heated and intense arguments, which made them feel like not wanting to talk to each other for the rest of the day.
Teddy’s hair hadn’t changed the colour at all, but it looked a bit messier, as some sort of a mix of Harry’s and Draco’s hair, whereas the colour of his eyes had turned from twinkling grey to deep bright green.
Harry explaining about Muggle professions to confused-looking Draco, and Draco telling him how he’d like to become an astronaut and run away to the Moon with Harry.
“Draco, wait!” Blaise’s voice echoed on the fifth floor’s corridor. Draco stopped and turned around to wait for Blaise. “What the hell has happened? Where’s Ginny? Or Harry?”
?” Ginny asked, eyes widening as she snatched the paper from the table. “God,” she mumbled, covering her mouth with her hand as her eyes scanned the front page.
“They work just perfect,” Ginny said, giving the other one to Harry. “You know you can’t send messages or call at Hogwarts?”
“Let him rant, he’ll calm down eventually,” Draco said lightly. “I’m more surprised about my mother. Couldn’t have thought that of her, sounds like she was some kind of a rebel or something.”
"You know, according to proper etiquette, you should let your date be in front of you, not behind you trying to get a crappy glimpse of the scene behind your shoulders,” Pansy whined, jabbing Draco harshly in the middle of the back.
Harry hadn’t really prepared himself for this, so he hadn’t packed the pyjamas in his bag, and now he didn’t know what to wear. In any case, he supposed he wasn’t expected to sleep with all his clothes on, so he settled for his pants and a t-shirt he had been wearing under his robes.
Harry chuckled, feeling suddenly hot all over despite the coldness. “Your fingers will fall off if you don’t put your mitten back on,” he said. “And give me my glasses back, I want to be able to see the Northern Lights.”
“From the start? What happened after you called me when I was still at the Dursleys? I only remember you telling me Voldemort and a bunch of Death Eaters were visiting occasionally at the Manor.”
“Bloody hell, Harry,” Ron said, eyes wide. “Every time you told us you were hanging out with Ginny, you were shagging Malfoy instead. For two bloody years.”
If Harry had to find something positive out of the whole situation, at least he didn’t have to go to the Occlumency lessons anymore. Although he didn’t have a clue how he could survive the remaining Potions lessons from now on.
Draco swallowed and felt for the first time during their meeting that he had no proper argument to say to Potter. He hadn’t come to think at all about what would happen
Draco looked deep into Harry’s eyes, his whole posture looking much more relaxed now. “Why are you trying to understand me?”
“I take your word for it,” Harry said, smiling a little. “You wanted to explain why you took the Dark Mark? I think I’m better prepared to listen now.”
“Yes, I’ve got Occlumency with Snape,” Harry said, groaning. He had already come to the conclusion he’d rather fight with a Basilisk or two than endure one more Occlumency session alone with Snape.
“Er, yes? I mean, I don’t know how much Draco has told you, but it wasn’t, erm, too easy at first,” Harry said, tapping the back of Draco’s hand nervously with his finger as Draco squeezed his thigh again, reassuring.
Harry felt amazed at how much his friend knew, and now even Harry felt like he understood at least slightly better what Zabini had tried to explain to him earlier that day. “But, ‘Mione, how do you know all this? Or, I mean,
As Ginny realized Draco wasn’t going to answer her, she pulled back a little and turned her eyes to his, but Draco’s eyes were completely locked on Harry’s.
“No, but it’s a high-control group with various similar elements with sects and other conservative religious groups.”
Harry rolled his eyes but refrained from saying anything else. He was bursting to tell Ron and Hermione how they were wrong, how Draco actually had the Dark Mark imprinted on his skin and how he had been on Voldemort’s side all along. But he couldn’t tell, at least not yet. His head was so full of thoughts he hadn’t had time to register yet, and he wanted to get them in order by himself first. Besides, he knew that
feel happy, but he knew that if they were to keep on going, Harry would want more at some point. Not now, maybe not even in a year, but at some point, he’d get fed up with hiding and secrecy. There were already too many secrets in his life and keeping them felt all-consuming.
Draco stared at Harry disapprovingly, shrugged, and, to Harry’s surprise, dipped his head in the water as well.
“It didn’t last long. Even Parkinson can’t stand the Ferret longer than this. How long were they together? For a week?” Ron continued happily as Hermione rolled her eyes. “What? I refuse to have a guilty conscience just because I enjoy seeing the Ferret suffer. Harry, what’re you thinking?”
“Why are you holding your hand like that? You didn’t cut that hand on Potions,” Malfoy said, grabbing Harry’s arm before Harry had time to snatch it away.
Harry opened a slightly creaking door. He had never been in that classroom before and based on the disorder, cobwebs and dust in the room, it wasn’t used very often.
“They’d kill him in Slytherin if they knew. Not only for being a homosexual but also for being the Chosen One’s sweetheart. The Dark Lord and his opinions have quite a lot of support in our House,” Zabini said. “Anyway, as I already said, I wish you could be yourselves around me. I’m on Draco’s side, and therefore I’m on your side as well, Potter.”
Harry barely had time to blink his eyes before Ginny said she was ready with the phones. She turned them on, showing Harry how to do it.
“God, ‘Mione, I didn’t know any of this. How can everybody still be okay with this? Why doesn’t the Ministry do something?”
Anyway, I hope you’ve enjoyed this story. I didn’t think anyone would actually read the whole story, so I feel a bit, dunno, surprised or somerhing that there actually are people who’ve read this. It has meant a lot to me. Thank you so, so much for reading and leaving kudos and so lovely and encouraging comments along the way, they’ve always brightened my day and made me smile.
“Only three beers and two vodka shots,” Harry said, lifting four, slightly shaking fingers up in the air. He counted slowly again and raised one extra finger as he looked Ron determinedly into the eyes.
“Relax, only you, I and Blaise know,” Ginny said reassuringly, as though reading Harry’s thoughts. “But I must agree with Blaise. The Mark doesn’t make Draco a Death Eater, so don’t worry about it too much.”
“So,” Blaise said, handing the glasses to Harry, Draco and Ginny. “To Sirius,” he said, raising his glass.
“Erm, I think she understands you needed a second,” Harry said. “But she might’ve thought you didn’t like her present.”
“Yeah, it’s almost too hot for even flying,” Ginny said, emptying her first glass in seconds and pouring another one right after.
“The mystery boy, the one who kissed you!” Hermione said and gasped. “I should’ve realized, you told me someone kissed you and then you started to ask about the pureblood culture all of a sudden and all.”
Malfoy – and Gregory Goyle. But the Wizengamot couldn’t possibly sentence to death also those who had done their punishable deeds when they had been underage or just barely legal adults? They had both still been only students, practically just kids.
Draco stood up, too, and snaked his arms around Harry’s waist, pulling Harry in a slow kiss. “Hope to see you soon again, darling.”
“Let go of me,” Draco snapped, pushing Potter feebly away. It resulted to be a really bad idea because as soon as Potter had let go of him, Draco was about to fall on the ground. Potter took quickly hold of Draco again, this time staying cautiously a bit farther away and wrapping only one arm around Draco’s waist.
“Erm, yeah. Still felt a bit awkward, though,” Harry said. “Have you thought about telling anyone else?”
“Mum, stop worrying. Harry’s an adult man, he already knows how to take care of himself,” George said, slightly amused, and Harry glanced at him quickly, giving him a thankful smile.
“I’m going to taste the wine,” Malfoy whispered and put his forefinger and thumb on Harry’s lips. “Open your mouth.”
Harry waved at Ginny and left hastily, not wanting to be called back by anyone. As soon as Harry was out of the Burrow’s wards, he Apparated to his own living room and slumped straight on the couch.
Hermione patted Harry’s hand and smiled. “So, do you have plans for today?” she asked both Ron and Harry, changing the topic to a safer one.
The Auror turned on his heels and set out to walk along the corridor in the direction he had just come from. Draco and Potter started to follow him cautiously, Potter still squeezing Draco protectively against himself.
“So, how has your weekend been? You went out with the group?” Harry asked, trying to change the subject.
“Is this how much trust you have in me?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow and acting hurt. “No, I didn’t have to use magic at all. I actually think I did rather well, all things considered.”
When Friday finally came, Harry got a chance to meet Draco properly for the first time after the holidays. Before that, they had only managed to share a couple of glances and nervous smiles in the Great Hall and shared lessons, which had only made Harry want to grab Draco from his stupid Slytherin tie, push him against a wall and snog him senseless in front of everyone. Of course, Harry knew better and did none of those things. Instead, he waited calmly until Friday’s last lessons were over, said his hasty I’m-going-to-hang-out-with-Ginny excuses to Ron and Hermione and rushed to the Room of Requirement.
“I got it, I won,” Draco said, grinning and raising weekly his hand that was tightly closed around the snitch, as he was laying under Harry who had ended up being on top of him after their rolling.
Abruptly, Draco stopped laughing and got tense under Harry. “Move off me, would you?” he said to Harry in a stiff voice.
“Could you show yourself, please?” Harry asked, feeling anxious as he still tried to grope the spot where he believed the voice came from, but every time his fingers just ran through the mist.
“Come here,” Draco said, reaching out to take Harry’s hand. Harry took his hand and let Draco pull him to sit down next to him. “We just wanted to surprise you, nothing more peculiar than that.”
“Mm-hm,” Draco mumbled for an answer. He wished Potter would leave already. He wanted to be left alone.
When Harry and Ron finally made it to the dinner, they both were exhausted and annoyed. Especially Ron was grim, thanks to the Slytherins, and he was just rolling his food around the plate without even tasting it, which was really uncharacteristic to him.
The one day at a time, one hour at a time, one minute at a time thing is quite straight borrowed from the TV series 'Skam'.
Sirius hesitated. “I’ve never told this to anyone else but Andromeda. I kept in touch with Narcissa even during wartime, when she and her family were on Voldemort’s side. I thought I could’ve saved Narcissa and her son, thought I could’ve been able to persuade them to change sides. But I lost the contact when I got sent to Azkaban, and Narcissa’s already too deep, anyway,” Sirius said, voice full of sadness. “And now Draco has to suffer from the poor choices his parents have made. I know you two don’t get along very well, but he’s still just a kid. And he was an adorable baby.”
“It should be clean now,” Malfoy said softly, pulling the rag away but still not letting go of Harry’s hand.
,” Draco stated firmly. “Merlin knows I’d be a wreck by now if I didn’t have you,” he continued more softly this time, coming back close to Harry.
Draco pulled back a little, turning his gaze to Harry. “That was fucking scary. I’ve never seen Severus like that.”
“I think I agree with ‘Mione. I’m not saying I like the git or that he wouldn’t deserve some sort of punishment but c’mon, he shouldn’t have to go to Azkaban,” Ron said. “He did a lot of stupid stuff, but in the end he didn’t kill anyone. He actually tried to even help us a bit.”
Soon Harry’s eyes found the other boy, who was now sitting at the Slytherin table with his friends, looking anxious and poking his food absentmindedly. Draco was a good actor, Harry would give him that, although he didn’t know for what purpose Draco was still acting as if he regretted hitting Harry. Shouldn’t he be laughing and bragging loudly about breaking Harry’s nose?
Harry gulped, feeling suddenly horrified. “Didn’t you hear what happened to Dobby?” he asked, and Draco shook his head. “Bellatrix’s knife wounded Dobby when he helped us to Disapparate from the Manor. He didn’t survive.”
As they arrived at the room, Draco fell straight away to the huge four-poster bed and closed his eyes, feeling grateful that Potter had Apparated them next to the bed as Draco would have probably passed out otherwise.
“So you’ve said,” Snape said. “I tried to tell you last year how dangerous your arrangement with Potter is, but did you listen to me? No. You do realize you’re as good as dead if the Dark Lord gets to know about you and Potter
had stuck up in Harry’s head making him feel somewhat confused. Now that Harry had started thinking about this, it wasn’t even the first time this subject came up in his head. For example, Harry knew that for some reason he had always noticed how other blokes looked like: what colour their eyes were, how their features were sharper and harsher than the girls’ and how the robes fit their flat chest and broad shoulders. On the contrary, Harry had hardly paid any attention to the girls, and his friends in the dormitory found him utterly oblivious every time they were having a long chat about everyone’s current crush. But Harry was pretty sure he hadn’t ever fancied Cedric or any other bloke, for that matter. Harry might have been… curious about some blokes, but definitely nothing more. And Cho was such a nice girl and Harry kind of fancied her, right? At least he hoped so, he didn’t really want his life to get any more complicated from that what it already was, thank you very much. Nevertheless, Harry didn’t really have time to concentrate on some kind of a love life when Voldemort was constantly looming in the background. Harry huffed bitterly at that thought. As if he had ever had a chance to enjoy something so mundane as being just a normal teenaged boy with a stormy hormone system.
“Yes, I wasn’t planning on using them here,” Harry said as he tried to remember how to use a phone. After a while, he managed to find messages, the contact list and the settings. He and Ginny listened to different ring tones and chose the most bizarre ones for both phones.
“Very well,” Snape drawled. “Potter, stay here, we shall return to your lesson as soon as I’m back.”
“It’s complicated,” Harry said, sighing. “Besides, I don’t want the Prophet to know or hear the other students gossiping, so I’m alright with this as it is, at least for now.”
“That’s true. No offence, Harry, but you’re quite slow at typing messages,” Blaise said matter-of-factly as Ginny started to giggle.
Although now that Draco came to think of it, the trio, and Potter in particular, had always tried to save him despite all the hatred. During the Battle of Hogwarts, they had done it even twice when he had been about to end up dead thanks to his so-called own side. Maybe that was their truth, the world they believed in. A place where even the criminals would be worth saving and getting another chance.
“I think I’ve never done anything this weird,” Draco said softly, coming to stand beside Harry and pulling him tightly into his arms.
Harry was silent for a moment. No matter how much he hated Lucius Malfoy and wanted him to suffer, Lucius was still Draco’s dad. “Well, I’m happy that you’re okay. Just let me know if there’s anything I can help you with.”
“No, nothing in particular,” Harry said and noticed Malfoy leaving from the Great Hall. “I think I’m going to take a walk, need some fresh air.”
He didn't understand what in Salazar’s name got into him every time he had to communicate with Potter. He did understand that Potter was probably trying his best and apparently wished him only well at this point, but it was still hard for Draco to let go of old, familiar, and safe ways. It was as if he could keep Potter at arm’s length if he acted like a complete prat towards him.
“Haven’t heard much of him since I left the Dursleys,” Harry said. After their phone call, Harry had received only a couple of text messages from Draco. He hadn’t thought anything about it at first as he believed Draco’s battery must have drained, but now the clear anxiety he had heard in Draco’s voice during their phone call was haunting him.
Neither Harry nor Malfoy said anything. Zabini just sighed heavily, stood up, walked between Harry and Malfoy, took Harry’s right hand, and put it over Malfoy’s left.
Harry petted Draco’s hair, comforting, as he bit his lip to be able to refrain from laughing. He had to admit that the whole situation had started to seem a little hilarious a couple of hours after the episode.
“There's no such thing as perfect, and I don’t want it, anyway. All I know is that I want you, with your past, your present, your future. With your flaws and pointiness and, erm, occasional insufferability. I want all that, Draco. I want all of you,” Harry said, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and pulling him closer. “You know, I never stopped loving you. Even though I tried to show you the quite opposite.”
. He broke up with Pansy, probably because of you. Their relationship wasn’t even remotely real, to begin with,” Zabini explained. “Potter, you don’t know anything about pureblood culture, do you?”
“They’re astronauts. They travel to Space, using that kind of a space rocket,” Harry said, referring to the picture of the rocket.
Harry found Sirius in the drawing room, regarding the Black family tree Harry had studied already last summer. Sirius turned his gaze to Harry when he heard him approaching.
to you. And based on all I’ve heard of them, they loved you more than anything,” Draco said and kissed Harry’s lips lightly. “They even wanted you to learn about these ridiculous Muggle careers.”
“Oh, for your secret lover?” Ginny asked, eyes glinting as she gave Harry a mischievous smile. Harry’s face turned bright red.
“Oh, you’ve got the picture with you, Harry? Could I see it?” Ginny asked, excited, after Draco had told them about the Christmas gift he had given to Harry.
And then, Harry kissed him back. At first, the kiss was gentle, maybe cautious even, as their lips met each other after having been apart for weeks. The kiss felt something so natural and easy, as if the movements of their lips were in perfect sync, and slowly the kiss became more passionate as Draco’s tongue slipped into Harry’s mouth, making Harry moan and turn around to straddle him.
Draco smiled and turned to his side to be able to see the calm expression on Harry’s face. Slowly, he moved his fingers from Harry’s stomach to Harry’s side. Both Draco and Harry had taken a phoenix tattoo at the beginning of the Christmas holidays, Harry because he had finally been able to talk about him having been Voldemort’s Horcrux with his therapist and Draco because his parents had disowned him. It had felt a bit of a cliché but they both had loved the symbolism there as they both had died in a way and then been born again from the ashes. Getting a chance to start over, stronger and more complete than before.
His head was buzzing. He couldn’t focus on anything other but the sodding Mark and the invisible hand around his throat. He had to get rid of the invisible hand, he needed to be able to breathe again.
“Quiet!” Snape snapped. “Do you have any idea how dangerous this arrangement of yours is? You’re playing with things you know nothing about. What if the Dark Lord gets to know about your sweet, little teen romance?” Snape went on ranting. “Or your parents, Draco?”
“Mm-hm,” Draco mumbled, keeping his eyes tightly shut to make his head stop spinning. He inhaled and exhaled deeply a couple of times, trying to concentrate on how he could feel his feet firmly on the ground and how Potter’s arms were still around his waist, holding him upright.
“And Ginny, she loves Teddy,” Draco said. “Merlin, will I have to stand to see him redheaded the whole Christmas?” he continued, whining.
“I’m glad to hear that, but that’s not what I meant. To me it sounds like what there was between you two wasn’t just a passing teenage romance,” Molly said. “Do you still love him?”
“Aren’t we two a bit sad cases,” Draco said, sighing. “It’s summer and we’re having holidays but still both of us would prefer about a hundred times more being at school instead.”
“Of course not. But Malfoy would’ve needed help and support, not someone making his situation even more difficult,” Hermione snapped. “Sorry, that was inappropriate of me. You
“You’re absolutely sure? You think none of the other house-elves has seen him either? He’s been missing for a couple of hours now.”
“Harry, are you sure you can trust Dobby?” Hermione asked, biting her lower lip suspiciously. “Don’t take me wrong, I do like Dobby, but you remember what happened last time he tried to help you.”
Slowly, Draco turned to face the house-elf as well, and Dobby’s eyes became huge of astound. “Young master Malfoy!” Dobby cried out and bowed so deep his nose touched the floor.
When the lesson was finally over and all the students started to march to the Great Hall for dinner, Harry made a split-second decision to take his Cloak out of his pocket, put it on and dart to follow Draco, who had apparently decided to skip the dinner altogether as he, unlike all the other people, walked towards the Slytherin common room instead of heading to the upper floors.
“Wanted to make my parents believe I’m as straight as one can be. Thought they might buy it if I dated someone openly.”
“The thing is, pureblood culture is still a little… old-fashioned. Homosexuality simply doesn’t exist, that’s what all the pureblood children get to learn as fast as they learn to understand speech. When it comes to Draco’s family, Draco has huge pressure on his shoulders as the only son and heir of the Malfoy name. He is scared of his family abandoning him if he doesn’t meet his parents’ expectations. That, I’d assume, is the main reason his behaviour towards you has been quite hostile earlier and now rather contradictory. He has tried to hide his feelings even from himself by distancing himself from you, but I don’t think he can do it anymore. And I sure hope he can’t go on like this, otherwise, he’s going to destroy himself in the end. It’s not healthy to pretend to be something you’re not.”
Harry started to stomp up the stairs but he came soon to a sudden halt as he felt someone grabbing his arm. He turned around, only to come to realize that Draco had decided to follow him.
Hearing Draco fall, Potter turned quickly around, came up to him, and raised him gently up. He placed Draco’s arm on his shoulder and wrapped his own arm tightly around Draco’s waist so that Draco’s whole weight rested practically on him. Luckily, Potter knew better than to say anything about Draco’s state of degradation.
“If you want to do that, you do that. It won’t probably be the easiest way, though,” Andromeda said. “Anyway, it doesn’t matter what I or your friends suggest you do, you’ve got to listen to yourself and do only things you’re comfortable with, at a pace that feels right for you.”
Draco patted Ginny’s back absentmindedly, looking at Harry over her shoulder. As their eyes met, Harry could feel the confusion and anxiousness radiating from Draco, as if he couldn’t quite believe his eyes. Harry’s face was probably reflecting Draco’s feelings as he suddenly felt short of breath, and all the thoughts left his mind. All he wanted was to flee but he couldn’t; it felt like his feet weren’t really his as the message his brain tried to send them didn’t seem to reach them at all.
“Look, I haven’t told you, but we have a kind of secret club where we practise Defense this year –” Harry began.
“It was me, actually,” Ginny said as Blaise started to pour Firewhisky into four, small glasses. “Or I didn’t practically smuggle it in, I just happened to find it from Fred and George’s things they left behind when they left.”
When Harry arrived at he and Malfoy’s usual spot, he was surprised to see Zabini sitting there, next to Malfoy.
“Harry,” Blaise said suddenly in a serious tone, a half-eaten sandwich in his hands. “I’m sorry for your loss, I truly am.”
Malfoy started to draw lines along Harry’s face with his finger. “I wouldn’t do that again. I want to be with you,” he said softly.
“I’m starving,” Ron announced, stalking into the compartment and slumping onto the seat next to Harry. “So, what’s up here?” Ron asked, grabbing one of Harry’s Chocolate Frogs.
Harry found Draco’s mouth again and they started kissing fervently, panting and moaning on each other’s mouths.
Before their trip or going to the Burrow for Christmas, Draco had still one pub night left with his Muggle friends. This time Draco had asked if Harry wanted to join them, if only to show how knowledgeable about Muggle things he was these days, and thus, Harry had surprisingly found himself sitting at a table in a rather crowded Muggle pub in London the day before Christmas Eve, surrounded by Draco and six curious-looking Muggles.
Harry avoided Malfoy’s gaze. Zabini had asked not to tell Malfoy he knew about them, but Harry didn’t know how to answer Malfoy’s question without lying.
Draco tried to stretch his numb limbs a little, but both his hands and feet met the cold stone wall before he was able to stretch himself to his full length. The cell where he had spent his whole imprisonment time was an extremely small, windowless room where the only source of light was one single torch whenever someone had bothered to light it for him. There had been so cold and damp in the cell for the whole time that Draco could swear the coldness had become a new, permanent part of him, and it was so hard to believe summer was supposed to be at its best outside of the prison walls right now. Even though there had been no Dementors sucking out people’s happy memories in Azkaban for quite a long time, Draco still found it almost impossible to try to remember how it felt like to listen to the birds singing or to smell blooming flowers in the summer wind. Or to lay eyes closed on the fresh, green grass at the Manor, feeling the sun warming him with its every ray.
Draco came inside cautiously and turned his grey eyes instantly to Harry. Harry’s breath hitched as his eyes met Draco’s. Just like the Room, Draco, too, looked the same, with his soft, slightly wavy and blond hair, pale skin and sharp features. He looked absolutely gorgeous.
“Of course, it would be such a great honour for Kreacher,” the elf said, bowing so deeply his nose almost touched the floor. “Kreacher is going to make supper now, there must be a proper feast for the guest of honour,” he went on, Disapparating from the hallway with a loud bang.
“Your Gryffindors are not keeping you busy today?” Malfoy asked, starting to give light kisses along Harry’s jaw.
“Why can’t you be more than that?” Ron asked. “I’ve already gotten used to the thought of you shagging the ferret,” he said, turning crimson. “Or maybe not quite just yet. But it’s not like any of your friends would really have a problem with that. Or would have a say in that, to begin with.”
“Nonsense,” Andromeda said, waving her hand nonchalantly. “What did I just say about this place being your home now? Besides, I’ve got more than enough money to provide you with the school supplies. You’ve got your N.E.W.Ts this year and all.”
That was until Ginny burst into the common room from the corridor where the dormitories were, Blaise following right after her.
Harry blinked his eyes, confused. “Er, Zabini?” Harry asked, trying to remember the name of the long, dark-skinned Slytherin boy.
Granger gave him an unreadable look before answering. “He’s doing alright. Well, all things considered.”
“Yeah. It’s supposed to introduce different careers,” Harry said, showing Draco the cover with the title ‘When I Grow Up’.
should have realized. I’m sorry, I do really am,” Draco said firmly. “But you had at least your Muggle family, right?”
“No, no, I mean, it was just unrequited. From my side. Haven’t thanked Dobby for helping us to find a perfect place to practise, so I thought I could see if I find him in the kitchens.”
“Fine. Christmas feast with the Dark Lord, couldn’t have come up with anything better,” Draco said gloomily.
Everything went quite smoothly until in one Potions class Snape thought it’d be an entertaining idea to pair Harry with Malfoy.
Harry chuckled. “If you had told me four years ago I’d willingly be travelling to Norway with you, I would’ve said the same.”
Potter pretended not to have heard Draco mutter and first helped him to sit down in the bow before pushing the boat into the water and jumping aboard as well.
Harry started stroking Draco’s hair as he studied the other boy’s face. He was sure he had never seen Draco this serene and exposed at the same time, as if Draco trusted himself completely in Harry’s arms.
Harry chuckled. “I don’t think so, he won’t probably give up the blonde hair as long as you’re there.”
Draco wrapped the Cloak tightly around himself, even though he knew it wouldn't really help as Potter and the boat were still clearly visible. But if nothing else, the Cloak at least warmed him up a bit and protected him from the biting wind.
But when the War ended, nothing was that simple anymore. The word ‘justice’ began slowly change its meaning when the winning side started discussing the Death Eater trials they had planned already during the War. Even though they were happy and relieved they had won, they still couldn’t forget the cruelty and the injustices the opponent side had done. Instead of mercy, fairness, and forgiveness, the end of the War brought to the surface feelings of bitterness and bottomless thirst for revenge. If you tortured and killed my loved ones, I have the right to torture and kill you. Talks about justice and equality started to turn into thoughts about eliminating evil, once and for all. Actually, the light side wanted to forget the War and the evilness completely by destroying the haunting memories and remnants of them and wiping them out from the world, pretending they had never even existed.
“Did you even consider Draco might’ve had some other reason to take the Mark than choosing his side?”
Harry looked at Malfoy unbelievingly. The git did have the nerve. The only thing he seemed to care about was that Harry still agreed to keep his dirty little secret. And how could Harry even answer to that?
Draco gulped. “I’d like that. Very much,” he said weakly, trying not to get too hopeful as he suddenly felt his heart hammering in his chest.
“Umbridge makes me write lines, and she has a special quill for that. Look, this isn’t really a big deal.”
He had already lost everything he had had. The future held nothing for him, no one wanted him here anymore.
“Fine. Let’s talk more about this a bit closer to Christmas, alright?” Harry said, giving Ginny a small smile. “I think I should actually go now, thought I’d, um, check everything’s okay at Grimmauld Place. Could you say bye to Ron and Hermione for me?”
“Malfoy,” Harry whimpered, bucking his hips up to create more friction, but Malfoy took his hand away.
Harry’s head was aching as he, Ron and Hermione were walking to their first lesson of Care of Magical Creatures. The headache had become so familiar to him that he didn’t really pay any attention to it anymore. As Harry, Ron and Hermione came to Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, they got abruptly reminded of the worry for Hagrid when they saw Professor Grubbly-Plank instead of their friend. They had wondered where Hagrid had gone without saying a word to them, and not even the new Professor was willing to tell them when Harry tried to ask.
“Draco, please,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hand and interlacing their fingers together, and this time Draco didn’t jerk his hand away.
“Not endlessly. What do you think the Wizarding World will think when they get to know that their favourite hero has helped a notorious Death Eater to escape?”
“Harry, calm down,” Draco said softly, starting to rub Harry’s lower back soothingly. “Why are you here, mother?”
Harry’s breath hitched in his throat. Whatever he had thought he would be doing that weekend, he had definitely not been prepared for talking about his love life with Molly Weasley. “Er, I don’t know. I mean, yes, I think so, but I don’t know if that’s enough.”
“Probably not,” Ginny said, grinning. “Just kidding. Blaise asked Draco if he could tell me, and Draco was fine with it.”
So it hadn’t been just another nightmare from which he would have just woken up at home, in his huge four-poster bed, wrapped comfortably in his silk sheets as the morning sun played lightly on his face.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Potter snapped as he scrutinised Draco’s changed appearance from head to toe, looking downright horrified. Draco suddenly felt extremely vulnerable and naked. How ironic it was that he had thirsted for Potter’s attention for almost his entire life and done everything he could have thought of to get it, but now that Potter was finally paying his undivided attention to him, he would have wanted to be anywhere else but under the intense stare of another boy’s green eyes. He hadn’t wanted Potter to come to witness how successfully the current Ministry had managed to destroy him. He didn’t want to share his last moments in this world with the git.
“I take that as a yes then?” Harry asked, breathless, when they had broken the kiss. He started running his hand gently in the other boy’s hair. Draco’s hair was full of glistening snowflakes by now, and Harry was amazed by how breathtakingly beautiful they made Draco look. He looked somehow ethereal, as if he wasn’t from this world at all.
Malfoy stiffened immediately. His face flushed and his expression became a strange mix of angriness and fear. Now that Harry looked at Malfoy more closely, he noticed that the Slytherin looked really exhausted. His whole posture radiated animosity towards anyone who dared to come too close, and by the dark circles under his eyes, it was obvious he hadn’t been sleeping well for some time.
“Of course it's not you! I could never do that to you,” Draco said, pleading and wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and pulling Harry flush against him. “Harry, please, you’ve got to believe me. I never wanted anyone to die. I still don’t want to. But there’s no way I could get myself out.”
“Erm, Molly asked if you, Andromeda and Teddy would like to celebrate Christmas with us,” Harry said apropos of nothing. “What do you think?”
“I didn’t come here to yell at you if you’re worried about that,” Harry said, sighing. “I’m sorry I didn’t listen to you. I know now I acted like a dick.”
“No, you don’t really –” Harry started at the same time as Kreacher Disapparated from his bedroom with a loud bang, “have to,” he muttered into the empty room.
Even though Katie hadn’t died or anything and the necklace hadn’t caused any more damage, Harry felt like the war wasn’t anymore something abstract and distant, something that took place only outside of Hogwarts’s grounds. And what was worse, Harry
made? You’re nowhere near me and I can hear you as if you were right next to me, though your voice sounds a bit weird, to be honest. And where does my voice even go?”
For a moment, there were vague clicking and squeaking noises before the cell’s heavy wooden door began to open very, very slowly, as if the intruder had hesitated whether they really wanted to come in or not.
The week continued grey and gloomy, and Harry could swear he had never felt so tired before. On Thursday, Harry was on his way back to the common room after dinner, alone, as Ron and Hermione had eaten all too fast, looking like they had been in a hurry to have some couple time. Merlin, Harry was so done for that day. He wouldn’t speak to anyone in the common room, he would just walk straight into his and Ron’s room and –
“C’mon, they’ll survive without the birthday boy for a moment,” Ginny whispered, poking Harry at the side. “Fetch your present and the phone, we’ll take a walk.”
“Some days I question myself and my decisions a lot and want to go back to my parents, even though I’m rather sure it wouldn’t be good for me,” Draco said grimly. “But I’m not sure. I don’t know, maybe I would be happy, following my parents’ expectations. Eventually. Or happier than now. I don’t know.”
“I won’t, or I’ll at least try not to,” Harry tried to say confidently, even though he still felt quite insecure about everything that was somehow related to Malfoy. “Thanks ‘Mione, truly. I think I’d better head to bed now or I won’t make it to the morning lessons.”
There were some advantages of being a wizard as after a sleepless night one didn’t have to survive only with the help of coffee. As soon as Harry had made it to the breakfast table, yawning and almost unable to keep his eyes open, Molly had fetched a bottle of Pepper-Up Potion from the kitchen drawers and given it to Harry.
At first, Harry was quite proud of how well he stomached seeing Malfoy and Parkinson clinging to each other. They were snogging on the corridors, walking hand in hand in the courtyard, and Parkinson kept on feeding Malfoy as if the git was incapable of eating on his own. However, as the days passed by, Harry could no more ignore the nasty feeling coiling in his stomach with a straight face. He became quite withdrawn around his friends, but he was pretty sure he managed to keep up appearances, at least on some level. He knew he was now doing precisely the opposite than what Hermione had warned him not to do; he was getting led by Malfoy. Or was he? Malfoy hadn’t exactly promised anything, on the contrary, he had said quite clearly to Harry he couldn’t be with him. On the other hand, the git had let Harry kiss and touch him, sending Harry signals that maybe there truly could be something between them. Besides, Harry knew now he shouldn’t have kissed Malfoy. He didn’t care too much for Parkinson, but he still didn’t want anyone to get hurt, not even Parkinson.
The joy of being able to see Draco more often wasn’t, unsurprisingly, long-lasting. Draco had been continuously warning Harry that Umbridge and her subordinates, including Draco, were after DA, and they were getting closer and closer all the time. With Draco’s help, DA had managed to avoid a couple of close calls, but even Draco’s abilities had their limits. The whole DA had gotten caught, and now Dumbledore was gone.
“Definitely. He’ll say yes as soon as I tell him your redheaded female friend is part of the plan. He loves redheads,” Draco said, grinning. “Oh, don’t worry, Harry, I’m only joking. Blaise will act decently,” he added as he saw Harry’s face turning suspicious.
Until now he had trusted blindly that Voldemort wouldn’t get to know about them, but now that he thought about it, there were no guarantees. It was only pure luck Voldemort hadn’t seen a glimpse of Draco in Harry’s mind.
“Yes, ‘Mione. I really wasn’t hungry anymore, and I probably just needed some time alone,” Harry said, sighing. “Look, it’s nice of you to worry for me, but there’s really no need to. I promise I’ll tell you if there’s something you can help me with.”
“No need to thank Dobby, Dobby is always happy to help mister Harry Potter and his friends,” Dobby said and grabbed the empty basket.
discreet, I can give him that. Harry, you should check your gaydar if even you didn’t realize,” he went on, laughing.
Before Harry, who felt like he was sort of rooted to the spot, had time to even stand up, Ron had bolted to the window, opened it and snatched the paper from the owl’s claws, putting simultaneously sloppily a few sickles into the small pouch that was tied to its leg. Before leaving, the owl gave Ron a rather offended look, which Ron didn’t seem to notice at all as he slammed the window shut right in front of its beak. As Ron started to scan through the paper, Hermione came hurriedly to stand next to him, trying to get a peek of the paper, too. After a while, Ron’s hands stopped abruptly turning the pages as he had apparently found the page he had been looking for. If the situation hadn’t been serious, Harry would have probably laughed at his friends whose eyes widened comically and mouths snapped open as they stared at the paper, looking like they had just read the aliens had landed in London and were now about to conquer the Earth.
“Oh, right, sorry, my bad. How could I forget I should be okay with you snogging with your girlfriend all around the castle
“Think about your mother. What would she think if you betrayed her like this?” Lucius asked, making Draco feel sick. He couldn’t do this; he couldn’t leave his parents. But he couldn’t leave Harry, either. “Come,” Lucius said imperatively, beckoning Draco to follow him.
“Mother, please,” Draco said, feeling the tears starting to stream down his face. But Narcissa didn’t say anything, although this time she turned to look Draco in the eye.
“Tell me what’s wrong! I could help you!” Myrtle said in a high-pitched voice, hovering over the cubicles.
“Should we consider Zabini’s idea?” Harry asked as he took Malfoy’s cold hands between his own and started rubbing them.
Harry snapped his mouth shut and held his breath for a moment. “Fuck, I never wanted anyone to die,” he started almost whispering. “I never wanted our side to abandon the idea of the trials. Malfoy, we’ve really done everything I can think of,” he went on desperately, trying to reassure the other boy. And maybe even himself, too, to some extent.
Dobby had really outdone himself. Harry had only asked for some toasts and fruits, but instead, he had got still warm shepherd’s pie, treacle tart, butterbeer, chocolate pralines, and, to his horror, a couple of bright red roses.
“Even after everything I’ve done?” Draco said, looking like he didn’t take a word of what she was saying.
Harry rolled his eyes and smacked Draco’s head lightly. “No, you git. I just…” Harry gulped, feeling somewhat nervous. “Er, what do you think about Ginny?”
“Alright,” Blaise said, trying to stay calm. “Alright. So, where have you already been searching for them?”
Malfoy didn’t look happy as he narrowed his eyes. “Tell me, Potter, how does it feel being second-best to Weasel?” When he saw Harry’s face turning bright red, he continued, smirking again. “Poor Potty, did I touch a nerve? Just watch yourself because I’ll be dogging your every footstep this year.”
Harry had no intention to stop or slow down, though, so instead, he sped up and turned sharp left, trying to elude Malfoy by misleading him.
“So do your eyebrows,” Draco whispered, moving his fingers from Harry’s stubble to his brows. “And your eyelashes,” he continued, taking off Harry’s glasses to kiss his eyelids in turns.
“Maybe the stupid friend of yours has got himself badly injured,” Malfoy whispered to Harry’s left ear so that only Harry was able to hear him.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked out in silence, and Harry could sense the confusion and excitement radiating from his friends as if they were bursting to ask what was going on, but they managed to refrain from saying anything before they all had sat
“It was Blaise, actually,” Harry said, his face turning a bit red. “And I wasn’t ready to talk about this earlier. I think I needed a few days to, erm, cool down a bit.”
“You’re feeling nervous? Or you’re insinuating I’m feeling nervous?” Harry asked, raising his eyebrow.
“That’s beside the point. I’m worried about Hagrid. What could Malfoy mean with stuff that is too big to him? Although I’m sure Dumbledore would know if something had happened to him,” Hermione said, and Harry could see her thinking furiously.
“Oh, please, as if Draco has ever managed to be discreet when it comes to you. He has tried, I can give him that, but with really poor success.”
Andromeda sighed heavily. “I know you two have your history,” she began, and Harry’s eyes snapped at her, alarmed. “Yes, I know about you two. Draco told me when he tried to explain why he thought it wouldn’t be a good idea you two would be in my house at the same time.”
“Come with me, I’ve got a place where I can hide you. If you escape now, it’d draw the Ministry’s attention elsewhere, and they wouldn’t have the time or the energy to start planning how to continue executions.”
Just for a fun fact, the whole idea with the phones came from the joke of Nokia 3310 being a Horcrux. Then I realized 3310 wasn't even a thing back in the '90s, so I had to find another, even older model for the story purposes. I imagine the older model wasn't that different, but it still had an antenna and probably no games :D
“That sounds more like it,” Ginny said, smiling widely. “Answer him. He must be heartbroken, not hearing from you for days.”
“You could go to Diagon Alley and buy everything you need for the next year. Your book lists came days ago,” Molly said, making something coil in Harry’s stomach. He’d rather do almost anything else than go to Diagon Alley, to the middle of the crowd that definitely wouldn’t let Harry just go and do his shopping in peace. He had felt like a sight already before the War, and not to mention now, when Voldemort was finally completely defeated.
“Exactly, thank you,” Draco said. “But then again, I’ve never felt anyone understanding my background on such a deep level. I mean, when someone in the group tells me about their experiences or I about mine, it feels like we need to say only one word to be able to understand each other. It’s odd but… I dunno. Just feels good to know I’m not alone with this kind of issues.”
“Shouldn’t it be quite obvious? People who’re sentenced to death are not exactly priority number one in places like this,” Draco hissed.
“Yes,” Harry said, his eyes still watering a bit because of the alcohol. “Though I didn’t get to know about it before I was thirteen.”
The days following the kiss made Harry’s confusion about Malfoy and his swinging moods turn into grumpiness. To Harry’s misfortune, he happened to vent off his frustration by snapping too often at Ron and Hermione without any valid reason, which made Harry feel even worse. He had tried to explain to them that he was just so tired and angry at Umbridge and her bloody quill, but Harry could see his friends remained suspicious. What was worse, both Ron and Hermione started acting extremely cautiously around Harry, as if Harry was a ticking timebomb that could explode at any minute. But Harry knew there was no way he could tell his friends what was really bothering him. He was pretty sure Ron and Hermione would be okay with everyone else, but not with Malfoy. Besides, Harry didn’t even know what to think about the situation, and even though he was angry with the git, he didn’t want to tell anyone about the situation without at least talking to Malfoy first.
Harry and Ginny had made it a habit to take a walk once a day to a small and quite unpopular playground nearby. It was a win-win situation for both of them; Harry got to send some messages to Draco while Ginny, being desperate to get out, got to take a break from Grimmauld Place. A couple of times Harry and Draco had even managed to agree to use their phones at the same time, which had, in the end, been much more fun than ten monologue-like text messages from one of them in a row.
Draco felt his cheeks flaming with embarrassment. “I’m sorry, you know, for everything I did. For what it’s worth,” he muttered, not being able to meet the Gryffindor’s eyes.
This year it seemed like Harry wouldn’t be able to relax anywhere in the castle. Thanks to Prophet, Ministry and Umbridge, Hogwarts students were sharply divided into ones who believed Harry and supported his story, and to the others who believed Prophet’s articles and thought Harry had gone nuts. Wherever Harry went, he could feel the eyes on him and hear fierce whispering that consisted most likely his name and the words
“I know,” Harry said slowly. “I get it now why you can’t tell me everything, and I understand why you had to take the Mark. But it doesn’t make you belong to him, to Voldemort.”
In reality, Draco knew he would still have his moments of hesitation, though hopefully, they would be less and less as time passed. And now Draco knew he had people in his life whose love he didn’t have to earn because they already loved and accepted him completely as he was. Accepted him holding a boy’s hand and kissing a boy in a broad daylight. Kissing Harry.
“What a fucking gossiper,” Draco mumbled. “And as if you were any better at Transfiguration than me. It’s not that,” he said coolly.
Harry felt something coiling uncomfortably in his stomach. He had a bit bad conscience for having postponed and postponed his visit to the Weasleys simply because he was afraid of Ginny wanting to talk with him about their… relationship. Or about the lack of it. Or about the…
Ginny laughed light-heartedly and patted Harry’s arm. “Don’t be. There weren’t really that much feelings involved.”
“Never,” Snape started, baring his teeth. “Never in my life have I had to witness this level of stupidity.”
When the door had closed after Draco, Harry stood up, slumped into his bed without even changing his clothes and curled up into a ball, shaking. What the hell was wrong with him?
It was weird to see Draco there. He seemed to have his Malfoy mask on as his voice and gestures emanated haughtiness and coldness when he talked with his friends. It made Harry get goosebumps; it felt as if it was a lifetime ago he had seen Draco like that, without any indication of humanlike emotions. But Harry could still recognize him under all the layers. There he still was, his Draco.
“Really? Even though her only significant move during the whole War was to show her loyalty to our side at the end in order to save you?” Potter said, crossing his arms. “Besides, I didn't mean that. Even you can’t be so naive and think that the current Ministry would stop killing people when you’re dead. Once they’ve gotten you out of the way, they’ll start digging out everyone who has ever had anything to do with Voldemort or the Death Eaters. They want to get rid of the War memories completely, and I’d bet your mother is the next one in the queue.”
Harry sat as Draco sat down next to him. Draco tried to take Harry’s hand, but Harry snapped it away.
“You maniac, your brain will freeze!” Draco yelled as Harry appeared back above the surface, laughing.
But trying to fall back to sleep was a long lost battle, Draco already knew that. Uncertainty and anxiety had become stable and loyal companions to him, which was why his body had been in a sort of constant, hyperactive state already for quite a long time. He couldn’t even remember when was the last time he had been able to sleep more than ten minutes at once.
Kissing Draco was weird. At first, it felt like they were tiptoeing around each other, as though they were both feeling somehow scared or threatened. Soon the kiss turned into frantic and desperate with tongues and teeth and gasps and with definitely no finesse at all. Draco’s body felt somehow strange under Harry’s fingertips and against his body as Draco was clearly bonier and maybe even a bit taller than before. But still, Draco’s body felt so familiar, as if Harry knew every angle and every curve on it. And every little spot that made Draco gasp and groan with lust and pleasure.
“Yes. In many conservative religious groups, as well as in strict pureblood families, children learn really early how they should act to be accepted, so their brain cells create chains according to what people around them teach them. It’s really effective if all the people around you agree on what they teach you and if they’re showing you some sort of love and fondness; then it gets really manipulative. Children and teenagers are extremely vulnerable as they don’t usually have other models of thinking and they can’t criticize yet very well what other people tell them.”
What happened with Narcissa is a bit open ending here. I’d love to think she could eventually break free from the pureblood society and reunite with her son and sister, but it would have been so long process I decided to leave it out from this story.
Draco considered Harry’s words. Maybe Harry was right, maybe the Order really could save his family. It would be risky, yes, but there were still plenty of other powerful people left on their side. The war was definitely not over yet. Besides, his family wasn’t safe on the Dark Lord’s side, either, as no one could ever know what he would come up with next. It was perfectly possible he would kill them all merely because Draco hadn’t been able to kill Dumbledore. Or only because he was in a mood. Actually, it might be even safer to change sides at this point. And then Draco would be able to be with Harry.
Harry explained Draco everything: the love potion spiked Chocolate Cauldrons, asking Slughorn for an antidote, Slughorn wanting to raise a toast with the gift mead, Ron writhing on the floor after drinking his glass, and Ron surviving thanks to the bezoar.
“Yes, I do remember perfectly well you told me she might have a crush on me, thank you very much,” Harry said, cutting her short. “I’m going to talk to her as soon as I figure out what to say to her.”
That finally seemed to make Draco snap out of his coma-like state. He pulled back from Harry’s touch, taking a few steps backwards.
“Er, turkey sounds good, thanks,” Harry said, and Draco handed him one, taking a salmon one for himself.
“I don’t know, something about handling stuff that is too big to him. I didn’t catch it that well, Malfoy was acting somehow, er, weirdly.”
“Yes, this is,” Harry said, feeling himself getting angry now. “Can’t you really see it? You’re actively choosing Voldemort’s side.”
“Yes,” Harry said as he sat down on the couch. He was feeling so anxious now that even his hands were sweating.
“And you had all the reason,” Ron said grimly, probably thinking about all the mocking and name-calling that had been directed at Hermione ever since she was eleven.
And there Harry had been, caught by Umbridge in her office, Salazar only knows doing what. Draco had tried to think furiously about all the possible ways to get Harry and his Gryffindors out of the situation, but he hadn’t been able to come up with anything that wouldn’t make him reveal himself.
Ginny was silent for a moment. “I’m not,” she said curtly after a while. “I’m merely stating what I’ve seen.”
“What is this?” Harry whispered, holding Malfoy’s wrist, and doing small, soothing circles with his thumb.
“About school and stuff,” Andromeda repeated slowly. “Are you nervous about going back to Hogwarts?”
to let Potter get any closer. If being completely objective about the overall picture of the situation, Draco was still just a simple pawn to Potter who tried to get his will through, no matter how nice and concerned Potter acted towards him. And even being in a better place than Azkaban didn’t really matter in the end, because Draco was still very much a prisoner. He couldn’t leave the house or he’d certainly end up dead in a matter of minutes, and he wasn’t sure if there could ever be a normal life for him, a life without hiding. Everything seemed so uncertain, foggy, and messy that Draco couldn’t tell if the escape from Azkaban had truly brought any new hope to his future. Probably not, at least not as long as the Dark Mark slithered on his skin.
“Right,” Potter muttered, sounding irritated. “Here, I brought you some food,” he said and slammed a big silver tray on Draco’s bedside table.
“So,” Lucius said finally in a cold, formal voice as he placed his pastry fork on his plate. “You are hereby disowned, and you are no longer our son. However, you can keep the Malfoy name, but otherwise, you are not entitled to an inheritance from the Malfoy family. Now, pack everything you want to take with you and leave.”
“You shouldn’t have said that, now he’ll be sure to take you tequila,” Dean said, grinning. “Spirits seem to make him devious.”
“Er, just the minor that fact I’ve always been horrible to their whole family and I let the Death Eaters into the school and one of their children got hurt because of that,” Draco said, strained.
Andromeda looked at Draco with sad eyes. “I know it’s extremely hard for you right now. I just wish you could confide with the friends you have and talk to them when you feel sad or anxious,” she said. “Talk with Ginny at least. She seems to care for you genuinely, and as far as I know her, she’s a good person with whom you can be yourself.”
only for four months and she was not to leave the country for five years. In addition to that their whole family was ordered to pay a great amount of money as war reparations, and that added to the absence of any kind of servants would definitely make sure the Manor was not going to be the same as it was before the War. As if it even could be, after all the horrors that had taken place in there.
Malfoy snapped his eyes at Harry. “Oh, for fuck’s sake, Potter,” Malfoy said, grabbing Harry’s hand and trying to get it far enough from the ingredients. “Let me see it.”
