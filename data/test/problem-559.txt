Draco stared, stunned " How come it's my fault." and Harry continued "YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT ME. I HAD BURRIED EVERYTHING IN MY HEART. THESE NIGHTMARES STARTED WHEN YOU LEFT."
"I loved you, Draco. I still love you. I always have. Perhaps I did not know how much until you left. I- I have missed you so much." He spoke and Draco looked at him with eyes that were sad and Harry's heart ached to take him in his arms but he knew that it would break whatever spell Draco was in and he did not want that.
"It's okay. I forgive you, aunt Petunia. You must calm down. Shhh." The words escaped his mouth and he was surprised because he had not known that he had the heart to forgive them.
Sirius nodded and leaned back, his shoulders relaxed. He tried hard to hide his relief but his eyes betrayed him. Draco chose to ignore it though.
Nothing of that sort happened. She got up and took a quick shower and opened her wardrobe. It was - everything seemed so old - as if she hadn't bought anything new for the past some years. She took out a green skirt and a light yellow shirt and got dressed. Then, she walked out of the room. The house - it was also different. She was on the ground floor of course and there were no stairs that went to the first floor. There was a dining room and a kitchen and a door that led to a sitting room and another door on the left side of the sitting room that led to another room - probably Dudley's. Her home had had the first floor too.
In the matter of minutes, the water was boiling and Draco cried in pain. He wanted to die, to end his worthless life. He wanted to feel clean. He knew that the hot water would eventually burn him and he would die a slow and agonising death and then Harry's face came into his mind. Harry would be devastated.
All right to the Harry Potter world go to J.K. Rowling. I just like writing fanfic about Harry Potter. Enjoy
"Thank you, Sir Salazar." She bowed deeply, as the ghost nodded, and charged Voldemort, Asteria reached into the sorting hat in Neville's hand, pulling out a long broadsword and charged the large snake, quickly swiping the head off, watching as the creature burst into dust, and Voldemort screamed as the ghost surrounded him and vanished as a spell flew and Voldemort screamed again as it hit his shield. She glanced up and watch Harry Potter throw himself out of Hagrid's arms and disappear and she felt a weight vanish from her shoulders as she threw herself into battle, dropping the sword in favor of her wand, flinging curses and spells in all directions. She felt revigorated and full of energy as she fought Death Eaters who didn't seem to be in the fight any longer, Voldemort had vanished, probably in search of Harry, who had somehow survived. She couldn't dwell on the thought long enough to think it over, and she froze as she faced her only opponent. He stood tall, but was dirty and looked tired. Dark circles were under familiar grey eyes, and his once perfectly straight pale hair was dirty and unwashed, and she stood poised, her wand hand trembling as he faced her, unarmed.
How are things? How are your classes? The teachers? How are your friends? Listen, I need to tell you things, but it's sensitive information. We'll talk about that later. How are the head common rooms, still overly posh? Does it still have some gaudy fireplace in both rooms? James had hated his, but it had many uses.
Asteria stepped out of the fireplace at St. Mungo's and followed Molly up towards Arthur's room, who by all accounts was as cheery as ever. Sitting up in bed, looking a little pale, was chatting with Charlie, who kept shaking his head amused, but his head snapped up and connected to hers, before focusing on his mother. He stood, and placed a kiss on his mothers cheek, before letting everyone closer to talk to Arthur, before tugging on her arm and pulling her from the room.
Draco had sat in the same spot for 9 hours, his backside was numb, and he was tired enough to crash exactly where he was, but had resisted the impulse. His eyes had long since adjusted to the darkness in the windowless room, and he had kept the disillusionment charm on his person, and let himself become slightly distracted by his thoughts. Shunpike obviously had a second location, as his sister wasn't here. And there was no guarantee that Stunpike hadn't already killed her. Draco hated the dark area of his thoughts that knew he'd kill Stunpike for hurting his sister. And he wondered if Harry would understand that. Probably not, Harry was all that was good and pure in the world, just by being himself. He was kind and gentle, even when the world wasn't kind to him. Draco was fully aware that Harry deserved someone better than him.
"At some point, during his school years, the Riddle family was killed. While Muggle authorities were baffled by the deaths, I knew it was magical. I couldn't prove my suspicions about Tom, but I knew he killed his father, and paternal grandparents."
"Do you know of the prophecy concerning Potter and Voldemort?" She asked, and once again, the Headmaster nodded.
"You think I'll let you go after what you've done." Draco looked down and leaned in close, putting his wand to Dolohov's neck, "anyone who had a hand in hurting my sister will meet a fate worse than death." He said, searching his own memory for the curse. "Custodia." He whispered and watched Dolohov's eyes widen and stick the way. The curse was meant to imprison the criminal's in their own body, but their mind fully awake,  and the only person who could break the spell was the caster. Draco took a quill from the desk and ripped Dolohov's shirt open, rage fueling his actions as he stabbed a small hole in Dolohov's arm and using the blood as ink signed his name across the chest.
"Then why am I here?" He asked, squaring his tied up shoulders, "Hoping to get in good with the Dark Lord?"Draco barked out a laugh, shocking his captive.
"Yes. It saved my life against Voldemort during the Last Task. Sia?" He asked, looking at her and she nodded, stepping a few feet from him and pulled her wand out and pointed it at Potter.
“I use this room to study. No one bothers me in here.” Draco explained gesturing to his backpack that had fallen near the door. Harry frowned and pulled him close.
Harry was phenomenally confused by whatever Ron was trying to say but he could tell he was trying to be a good friend so he just accepted it.
“Thank you. It would certainly put me at ease with him returning.” Harry could only nod in response. When it was time for Harry to leave Narcissa walked him to the door and thanked him for stopping by and returning the wand in person. She hesitated a moment and then actually pulled Harry into a light hug. He felt his face heat at the contact. He really wasn’t used to physical affection from anyone he wasn’t close to and even then it was still vaguely uncomfortable unless it was Ron or Hermione. He awkwardly patted her back and then she released him and seemed slightly amused at his discomfort as he walked away.
“God, Harry.” He breathed, and that absolutely set Harry off all over again. Harry whirled them around so he had Draco pressed against the wall next to the door. He kissed him hard and pulled Draco’s hips against his own desperately needing the contact and gasped at the stiffness he felt press against him. When he pulled his face back Draco was beautifully flushed but wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“Two of those three were from your own house. What if they’re waiting for you back at the dorms?” Draco didn’t immediately respond to that. Harry wished he could see his face to try to gauge what he was thinking.
“We’re not quite sure how his return will be received, but his education must be completed.” Harry frowned at that. He knew things would not be as they were before, but he had hoped that the ones on the light side of the war would be able to see the hypocrisy in harming anyone who had been pardoned.
“Either way we’ll manage. I don’t plan to get into any fights this year.” Harry took a bite of chicken before he realized there was something he needed to take care of.
“Normally I wouldn’t be caught dead in those rags you call clothes, but it seems I have little choice.” Draco conceded. Harry was surprised. Draco moved to stand next to Harry and he jolted slightly when Draco’s shoulder made contact with his through the cloak.
He immediately went up to the dorms and smiled as he picked up the clothes. He would still need to get some others, but this was a big start. For some reason the clothes made him feel new. Like he was a step closer to separating himself from his old life. Further from his miserable childhood, further from the war. He quickly changed into a set of new clothes. He pulled on a pair of dark jeans and tried to decide between the two sweaters. The color choices made him grin. One was green and the other was red. In the end he pulled on the green one and decided he would wear the red one tomorrow. He never really planned what he was going to wear ahead of time and the thought only had him smiling wider. He looked at his old clothes in his trunk and decided to sort through them. He pulled out all of his clothes, though there weren’t very many, and put aside anything with too many holes or stains. By the end of it aside from his school clothes he had two shirts, the jumpers Molly made him, and one pair of jeans. He tossed the rest in the bin for the house elves to dispose of and packed away his new clothes. He would have to thank Draco, if he could ever track him down that is. When Harry returned to the common room Ron and Hermione seemed to be waiting for him.
“No one in the 8th year dorms will lay a finger on you.” Harry assured him sounding determined and certain of his words before his voice softened. “Which is more than I can say for those other students, so I would appreciate it if you’d move your things in.”
“Lucius made his own choices in the first war and they carried over to this one. There is nowhere to place blame except with him. I’m certain your speaking on our behalf was the sole reason he was given a reduced sentence rather than a life sentence and that is much more than we expected.” When Harry looked up next Narcissa was giving him a light smile. “I believe it is best to put the past behind us and try to continue on. It won’t be easy, but I’m sure we’ll manage.”
“Oh, Harry you look lovely.” Hermione told him and Harry flushed at the praise. He’d never felt like he was very good looking, but the clothes had given him some confidence in his appearance. Ron slung his arm around Harry’s shoulders.
"Not really. Just checking on things." Harry tried to sound casual. Ron snorted then tried to stifle his laughter.
“You don’t have to be certain of what you want in order to finish your studies.” She replied calmly, almost motherly. “Take the year to finish your education and think about what you want. The time to decide can come later and there are many withes and wizards who change their path later in life if you should want to.”
“Ugh. It is.” The middle one answered, a girl with short brown hair looking to be about the same age except she wore Ravenclaw robes.
He was forming an idea to go find out when a parcel was dropped in front of him by a large screech owl. Harry frowned, worried it was another gift from a crazed witch or wizard. He’d been getting them a lot at the beginning of the year, but McGonagall had helped him sort out how to block those packages from getting through. With that in mind he decided to at least open the card attached to figure out if the package was malicious or not.
“We love you Harry.” Hermione told him as they broke apart. She kept her hand on his back and Ron kept his arm around Harry’s shoulders.
He must have sounded as helpless as he felt because Narcissa suddenly had a concerned frown on her face.
Harry turned around and had to bite back a laugh as he found Malfoy holding up the pants around his waist looking triple his size. The shirt was so baggy it made him look even skinnier than normal. It was comical seeing the prim and proper Draco Malfoy wearing his over sized hand me downs. Harry pulled out his wand and pointed it at the clothes. He saw Malfoy tense but continued anyway.
“Why would you need hand me downs? Surely your relatives were better off. Your father came from a rather well-off pure blood family after all.” Harry shrugged, his smile tight.
“Impressive.” Draco said simply, looking quite surprised. Harry didn’t know what to say next and ended up just awkwardly standing in front of Malfoy. He seemed to be waiting for something, but when nothing happened he huffed.
“Why is that?” she asked, not pressing, but at least sounding like she cared about his answer and maybe that’s why he told her what had been on his mind.
“You’ll never know unless you do something about it.” Hermione told him. Leave it to her to make sense. Harry sighed.
“You can call me Harry.” He said instead of the ‘you’re welcome’ he thought he was going to say. Draco looked stunned for half a second before composing himself again.
Harry reached the dorms and thought about how all of the 8th year boys shared the dorm, except one. Draco Malfoy had spoken to McGonagall after the welcoming feast and had apparently asked to stay in the Slytherin dorms. Harry wasn’t sure what was said, but McGonagall had agreed and made the arrangements for him to stay with the other Slytherins. He had hoped they would have been able to put the old rivalry behind them after everything that happened in the war, but was decidedly disappointed when he realized Malfoy was steadfastly ignoring him at every turn. Harry tried not to let it bother him, but it was no use. Every time he saw Malfoy he expected a snarky remark or some form of recognition at least, a sneer even, but he only received stony silence. It was odd to think about, but one of the only reasons he even returned to Hogwarts was because of Malfoy himself.
Once back at the common room he saw no sign of Ron or Hermione and headed up to the dorms. Draco was the only one in the room so far. He looked mildly nervous when the door opened but relaxed a little when he realized it was Harry. Harry held up the box of food and went to hand it to Draco.
Harry had never been the best with words, so he made a quick decision and leaned forward. He paused when his lips were millimeters from Draco’s, giving him the chance to pull away. Instead of pulling back Draco closed the gap and sealed his lips on Harry’s. Relief washed through Harry and he deepened the kiss. His brain was short circuiting, he couldn’t believe this was really happening. He leaned forward and one of his hands slid from Draco’s hip to his back. Draco stumbled back a little, but Harry was holding onto him. One of Draco’s hands went to cup his face, the other sliding into his hair at the nape of his neck. Harry shivered at the sensation and swiped his tongue over Draco’s. Draco moaned and that lit a fire in Harry’s chest.
“You can have it.” Draco told him. Harry smiled and leaned in again laying softer kisses on Draco’s lips. Draco’s hands found their way up Harry’s shirt and when they ran out of air they broke apart, breathing heavily. Harry continued dropping kisses on Draco’s neck and ground his hips against the blonde’s again. The moan Draco let out was better than anything Harry had ever imagined in his late-night fantasies and he desperately wanted more so he did it again. And again. And again. Slowly speeding up until Draco was saying his name like a mantra, begging for more contact.
“Doesn’t really matter. You can borrow my trainers to get back to the dorms.” Harry was bothered by the thought of Draco going back to the Slytherin dorms when his own housemates were so antagonistic. Truth be told he was bothered by Malfoy being anywhere that he couldn’t keep an eye on him. He had promised to keep an eye on things to Narcissa after all.
“Why would I be dating Draco?” Harry asked sounding slightly frantic. Ron gave Hermione a pleading look.
"Wouldn't surprise me." Ron supplied. Hermione frowned at him and gave him a meaningful look. When Ron still looked clueless Hermione jerked her head in Harry's direction. Ron seemed to catch onto something. "Er, we'll be fine though. I'm sure we can get on without actually fighting. It shouldn't be a problem"  Harry was surprised by Ron's words.
“No. Just- Why don’t you- er come to the 8th year dorms and you can borrow a set of clothes to get back to your dorm. That way if they’re waiting you’re not dueling them in the buff.” Harry had absolutely no idea why he offered. He really needed to learn to think about what he said before he said it.
Harry stood nervously outside of the classroom on the 3rd floor. He was trying to muster up the nerve to knock, but his arm didn’t seem to want to move. ‘He may not even be in there.’ Harry reasoned with himself.
Harry merely hummed noncommittally and continued walking. Draco grumbled the rest of the way to the common room and once they arrived Harry waited patiently for Draco to open the door. Draco threw an irritated look at Harry before giving the password and leading them inside. Immediately heads turned to stare at golden boy Harry Potter walking into the Slytherin common room. Harry was thankful most of the students were still at dinner or this would be even worse.
Harry tightened his arms around Draco. It wouldn’t be easy, but they would be okay and for the first time since the war ended Harry knew what he wanted.
"Don't, Asteria!" Remus shouted, pleaded, and she paused, fury rolling inside her as she looked at her father. Lucius flinched, and she raised her wand, noise barely made its way into her head.
"She's been made the High Inquisitor, which gives her power to make rules, and hand out appropriate punishment," Potter grumbled, before giving Draco a look. "You tell her the rest."
"I didn't know if you'd ever come back, I thought I'd lost you." He whispered against her legs, and she felt the tears in her eyes.
"Bone of the father, unknowingly given; flesh of the servant, willingly given; blood from the enemy, forcibly taken." Dumbledore supplied, leaning back in his chair, "The venom from his snake was used in a potion to give him a temporary body."
"I can't leave those children to fight alone, especially Harry and Draco." She added, almost like she hadn't heard him. "They are still kids, Charlie and they've taken so much on. Draco was right that day, about Albus."
"I am very sorry to inform you, but my associates just located Alice Jones, and she is gone," Dumbledore spoke, and Mrs. Jones let out a loud, broken sob, and Asteria couldn't stand it, and she turned on her heel and fled. Her feet barely carrying her down the stairs as she ran, she ran past many students, including Umbridge who cried detention, but Asteria didn't stop as she bust through the front doors to Hogwarts, she didn't stop there, she couldn't, and she tripped on her feet just next to the Black Lake, and couldn't control the flurry of emotion's coursing through her, and she screamed, her voice carrying into the morning sky. The pain in her chest was tearing at her, was beating at her, was killing her. She couldn't breathe, as the hot tears ran down her cheeks, and the wind whipped around her. She couldn't control her reactions, as her magic poured out of her in fury and pain, the water reacting, smashing against the ledge, the wind blew harder and Asteria simply scream.
"Because I have to prove myself worthy of the Malfoy name, little brother." She responded with a sigh. He was old enough to understand now, after all this time, she couldn't keep avoiding the truth from him.
She watched the young boy stand as a frail older woman sat down, Asteria once again, didn't pay much attention, just focused on Potter's body language, and stood, keeping a lock on her charm, as she silently stepped up behind him, and placed an invisible hand on his shoulder, lending him her strength, and he visible released a breath, comforted by her presence, and she fully realized what she was going to do next, what her next plan was, because she would lay down her life for Potter, like he was her blood, because he didn't deserve any of this. He stepped forward, to sit back in the metal chair, her hand falling to her side, and she let out a desperate breath and stepped back. When she heard a clear voice, ask the one question that really mattered.
"Fine then, together," Asteria said, and they both reached out and touched the cup, and she felt a searing feeling as she was sucked into a portkey, and they both landed undignified on a patch of grass.
"Asteria, please, stop shouting." Molly answered exasperated. The doting mother didn't fully understand why Asteria didn't want to be Head Girl, Potter did, as did Sirius. It pulled her into the light, and put her in an authoritative position. She had never wanted to be Head Girl, or Prefect or anything like that. She wanted to keep her head down, and get through her last year, with gathering as much information on defensive magic, and the HOW Voldemort was back. She knew that some privileges that came with her position was she could get into the restricted section. But it pulled her into the light, which wasn't good.
"Well, I'm afraid, I have to make some amendments to include a fourth champion," Crouch said, and quickly left, followed by the others from the other school. And Moody came inside.
"I think I know the spell. Back when we were in school, Snape used a nonverbal against James, cutting his cheek, we were ever able to get rid of that scar." Remus supplied in shock.
She brushed the thought away, refusing to let herself think of her time there. She'd been so happy, and now, she was bruised, tired, and just fed up with everything. She barely listened to the Headmaster announcing information about the Tri-Wizard tournament. She already knew what she needed to know, and she still had time to weight her own options, even though she knew she would do it, not to please her father but to keep her mother safe, and have a chance to be known as someone other than the unwanted Malfoy.
"I always disliked Albus for his blatant favoritism towards Gryffindor, but I hate him even more now for his disregard towards Harry's fucking life and happiness, and safety." Draco finished, and let out a breath.
The biggest Quidditch match of the year and Asteria was currently sporting a busted lip, and a black eye, with Madam Pomphrey bustling over her injuries. She probably shouldn't have jumped into a middle of a fight between Potter, George, Draco, Goyle, and Crabbe that had broken out moments after Potter had won the match. She knew Draco had to keep up appearances, and she also knew he had pushed the very thin line the two boys had drawn. Her eye had swollen shut, and her shoulder hurt like it had taken Blogger straight to it, even though her injuries were mostly from Crabbe and Goyle, it didn't make her feel any better. She had watched Umbridge drag Potter and George away, while Draco had been carted off to the Hospital wing with her, he still laid unconscious in the bed next to her, his face healed, but still bloody. She let out a sigh, and winced as the healer cast a spell on her eye, the swelling immediately going down, and she could see again.
"I just wish I could get him away from this, I don't want him to have to be a part of this fight, it isn't his responsibility." She whispered.
Charlie found her one night, while Draco was out hunting Snatchers, sitting in the large chair on the porch. She had taken to sitting out there, staring at the ocean, listening to the waves, and he sat next to her, afraid to speak.
"Sia?" Potter's voice was clear, and she looked past Charlie's shoulder to see Potter, shove Draco's feet off him, jerking her brother away, who looked up and saw her. They both walked to her bedside, and Draco took the chair and Potter took a spot on the bed, near Charlie. "I'm so sorry about Alice." He said, his voice sad.
"You wonder why everyone hates you at Hogwarts, that is why!" She finally said, her voice angry, as her brother looked on.
"Plenty of people looking for someone." He replied, leaning against the rail. "Needs to be worth it."
"Mum and Remus will be at it for a while. You are filthy, shivering and wet." Bill added, and only then did Draco realize how wet he'd come to be from the snow, and that Bill wasn't wrong, he was shivering as all he wore were black slacks and a black button-down, since he had given his warm cloak to his sister.
"And Mr. Weasley, I've heard many things about you and your family," she supplied, turning to face the group, "It is a pleasure to finally meet you and the others who have given my spoiled brother such a hard time. She said with a laugh, before turning to face her very angry father, amused mother, and offended brother. "Now, father, may we get to our seats, it looks like the match is ready to begin." She began to walk away, towards where their seats were, giving no room for arguments.
"Snape wants us to write in detail how to brew the perfect Girding potion, but we can't find it in this book," Potter muttered.
"You are the Weasley twins, my brother's mentioned you." She responded with a smirk. And the twins hesitated, tensing up.
A week later, and Asteria was still hiding in the Gryffindor common room, with Granger and Ginny sneaking her food and information. Aurors were out looking for her, assuming she had left Hogwarts since they hadn't found her on the grounds. Umbridge was furious, losing a student was one thing, losing a student who threatened her was even worse. But Asteria didn't know what else to do, but once curfew hit, she'd slip out and return to the library, resuming her search for information and the spell-development. It wasn't easy creating a charm to access different languages, especially one as old and selective as Parseltongue. She couldn't just hide out and do nothing, so instead she snuck around a dark, empty school library, trying not to alert Mrs. Norris or anyone to her presence. But she thought she'd finally done when it came to the spell. She gathered her notes and using the shadows to slip to fourth floors bathroom. Upon entering she searched the sinks, finding the right one, with a snake carved into the metal. Pausing she flicked her wand and prayed to Merlin it worked. A hissing sound came from her wand, and the sinks began to move, moving outward, until the one in front of her sank into the ground, revealing a hole.
It took a week for her cousin to approach her in a serious manner. She had been upstairs brushing Buckbeak, enjoying the peace after Christmas, and the return of Arthur, Asteria took to spending time watching the sunset through the windows in Buckbeak's room. He had entered it silently but stood in the corner watching her quietly before speaking.
"Expecto Patronum!" He shouted and a blue, wispy stag appeared, and Asteria grinned and the gasps of amazement on everyone' faces. She watch the stag as it trotted around, and came to stand next to her, and with a flick of her wand, her charm vanished, and everyone gasped as well.
Asteria yanked her head back above the water, shutting the egg as she brought it back up. Taking a deep breath, attempting to catch her breath. She pushed her wet hair back and leaned against the door, with a deep breath.
"I had hope, that maybe the rumors were wrong about you, that you just wanted to keep wizard-kind safe, but now I'm just talking to wizard whose been dead for centuries while the people I love to fight and die for wizard-kind." She grumbled, uncrossing her arms, and broke out in a run, returning to the bathroom in record time, and running towards a window, she could make out the dark shapes leaving the forest headed to the school, they were coming.
Asteria stared after her mother long after she had been gone, confusing thoughts running through her head. Her mother was usually blunt and to the point, never vague and spaced out like just then. Asteria rolled her shoulders again and shut her door, finally feeling some semblance of peace, locked in her own room. Her walls were a deep purple, matched with black furniture. Since her transfer to America, the house she had been sorted into wasn't a big deal. When she was sorted at Hogwarts, back when she was eleven, she had been sorted into Slytherin, she wondered if she would stay with that house or be resorted. As her thoughts circled around the possibility of being resorted, she moved her trunks down to the floor, off her bed, deciding against unpacking, since she'd have to pack it all in a few days anyway. She kicked off her black shoes and rested her head against her headboard, letting her eyes flutter shut.
"I can't return to Hogwarts anymore than you can. And I can't just hide out here, I need to find her and while you are off, destroying Horcoxes, I will find my sister." Draco responded and looked at his boyfriend.
It wasn't long after, when the Headmaster dismissed the chattering students to their common rooms, and Asteria flinched inwardly, she had hated the Slytherin Common Rooms in her first year, and she doubted that had changed, her old dorms had been welcoming in the sunlight. She followed behind her housemates, ignoring her brother's ranting ahead of her. He put on a good face in public, living up to the Malfoy name. But she knew what he really wanted, and it was the same as her...They both wanted freedom. Once inside the common room, she retired quickly to her room, changing quickly, and laying down, staring at the canopy of her bed. Silk sheets felt cool on her skin, and she wanted to scream, she could see her fathers hand in that. Probably gave them to every bed in the Slytherin common room, and she once again felt the rage at her father boil her blood, but she shut her eyes, attempting at shutting down the thoughts. Tomorrow was a new day, she'd receive her schedule, and be on her way to blending into the background until it came time to put her name in for the tournament.
Once behind closed doors, Asteria slid down against the door, and let out a breath she didn't know she'd been holding, and she felt a pain in her chest, in the realization that she had meant every word she had said to Molly. She really was envious of the Weasley's children, they had two parents who loved them so unconditionally, while Asteria sat there, wondering if her father had ever cared, or if her mother had either. They had never shown love like Molly or Arthur, and it hurt, deep down. Asteria gasped in pain as the tears began to fall down her face, quickly covering her mouth. It explained so much, about how kind and gentle Charlie was for a dragon tamer, how the Twins were never threatening just joking, how Ron was so loyal and how Ginny was so brave, they had unconditional support. Asteria functioned as she did out of pure spite, and desperation to find something better. And here she was, stepping on a dedicated mother's feet, and she held back a sob, the pain growing in her chest, and the tears flowing desperately down her face. She tried to catch her breath, but it wouldn't come and she struggled, but finally caught a breath, but it made the pain worse. Asteria dropped her head on her knees as she silently sobbed, and felt the pain of her last 17 years, the abuse, neglect, self-loathing, anger and the worst feeling of them all, the purest for of fear, and it welled up in her eyes and fell down her face, as her heart throbbed, and her lungs struggled for breath. She couldn't stand, but she held back the worst of the sobs, as it all coursed through her, breaking her, breaking her walls, her icy exterior, revealing the raw and damaged insides of herself, and she hated herself for even this weakness.
"Ridiculous. She had us read the textbook, we won't be doing any practicals in her classroom, as there are no real dangers in the world." Asteria responded taking a seat. "I fully understand she refuses to accept Voldemort's return, but that doesn't mean there can't be a new dark wizard, which could come up in our lifetime. How in Merlin's name does she expect us to pass our exams, which if we don't, it looks bad on her?" Asteria asked her head of house.
Slipping her wand up her sleeve, she exited the bathroom, just as the other girls began to wake. She eyed her robe, and grabbed it and her bag, tossing the robe on top it, not willing to deal with the thick coat in the still summer heat or England, and made her way up to the Great Hall, sitting at the edge, and grabbing toast when a deliberate shadow fell over her. She glanced up into the face of Professor Snape, as he held out a piece of paper for her. She grabbed it with a polite nod, and looked it over;
"Sorry about unloading all this on you, Bill," Harry whispered, and the older Weasley just shook his head.
Harry was very happy. He was content that Vernon had finally been punished for what he did to Harry. He had hugged Draco tightly after exiting from the police station and his eyes had been wet, for which he was not ashamed at all. Draco had wrapped his arms around Harry and stroked his hair soothingly.
Hermione has always been the most perceptive one and Harry is sure that she has made the connection.
"Why do you want to get marked by that monster?" She asks. Draco ignores her and pushes his hands deep inside his pockets.
"I'm going now." Draco groaned. He checked his pocket and gave a flick of his wand, vanishing from sight, and reappearing in the woods, where his sister's house had been last.
"We are in Bill and Fleur's cottage, they got married in July. The Ministry has fallen. Harry, Ronald, and Granger have been on the run, hunting Horcruxes. I've been hunting you down." He explained.
"Shh, I know love," Draco whispered and continued rubbing his back until the crying slowed and Harry leaned back, his dirty face streaked with tear tracks.
"Your father's choices, don't make it your fault either." Remus supplied, catching her response before she made it.
"We need to go to Hogwarts now, it's time." His voice wavered, but they moved. Asteria quick on her feet slammed her boots on her feet and gathered with everyone.
The week before the first task had just sent her emotions on a whirlwind. Draco had irritated her beyond anything when he came complaining about Moody transfiguring him into a ferret. He'd been incredibly offended when she burst into laughter. After her brother had taken off, she had found Potter waiting for her in the library, wringing his hands. Asteria had simply walked past him, and he had diligently followed her to her usual table, sitting next to her with a worried look.
"You know you aren't half bad, Malfoy," George added as his laughter died down, clapping the thin Slytherin on the back, before leaning against the counter.
"He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden." Potter had pleaded, but even Asteria wondered if that would do any good, she knew very well the animosity between the two. Asteria seemed lost in her thoughts wondering if Snape was actually going to do anything about it as he back out of the room. Seconds bled into minutes as Umbridge said something to Potter, and Granger reacted with a shout, drawing Asteria's attention back.
"You okay, Malfoy?" Ginny asked in her knowing voice. There had always been something about the youngest Weasley that spoke to Draco, she had already experienced so much, and she was so brave as she always stood with her head held high.
Now he had her back in a way Lucius never could, and she smiled inwardly, until something in the air changed, the ground beneath her began to shake as did the castle. The fighting paused as even the Death Eaters watched in fascination, she shook her head and regained herself, sending stunning spells flying, knocking out the enemy closest to her.
"Because you wouldn't have believed me, and Sia has made it very clear, that underneath that pompous behavior, you aren't that bad; and I wanted to see it for myself." Potter replied, "And she wasn't wrong." He finished.
"I haven't noticed much, Ali. Maybe you should go exploring and find someone to entertain yourself while you are here." Asteria said with a wave of her hand . "You know I only attend school to focus on my actual education, unlike you." She smiled at the look of mock sadness on her friend.
"Well, I didn't expect to survive this long, so I have no idea." Harry supplied nonchalantly, and she watched Draco's eyes darken for a moment, before disappearing.
"You will learn all that in your textbooks; and I advise you to raise your hand before speaking, Mr. Weasley." She sneered, and turned away, just as he was about to throw his hand up again, but Asteria stopped him, he glanced at her and she shook her head. He sighed and dropped his hand, and opened his textbook, and she followed suit. The entire class went like that, Asteria read four chapters ahead, and when the class was over she was out of the room in an instant, and after a nod, she was on her way to the dungeon for Potions, she arrived early and stepped into the dark classroom.
"You have failed." The ghost responded and Voldemort's step faltered. "You have taken my name and forsaken my teachings."
"Well, we should announce ourselves." Asteria supplied when she heard the emergency alert. Everyone began passing out robes as they quickly disappeared from the room, using multiple doors. The trek from the 7th floor to the Great Hall was quiet as everyone combined with the other students. Asteria broke off, casting her disillusioned charm, and sneaking up to the front, where Snape stood with the Carrows. She drew her wand and waited.
"Well, she definitely made some moves, hasn't she?" Asteria grumbled, "Now she cant stunt our learning as well as issue barbaric punishments."
"I am fully aware of that, Potter." Asteria replied, "However, she is a muggle-born, and that's who those freaks are after."
"Thank you, Sirius." Was all she could get out, as she hugged him. She knew her cousin had suffered, but she always failed to remember just how similar their lives are. They both had already lost so much, but they still had each other and the others, but it still didn't ease the loss they already felt. He pulled away and after giving her a soft smile, he left the room, leaving her alone. She took a deep breath, centering herself before turning to Buckbeak who looked at her with eyes that seemed to see all things, that seemed to understand all things.
"I won't let him do that to you, Sia." He growled, suddenly angry. "I won't let him take your choices away."
"Thank you, George," Draco whispered taking the parchment. Finally, Draco could get back to finding his sister, to saving her and bringing her home. Draco snagged a sandwich and hastily ate it as he waved his wand over his appearance, allowing his magic to transform him.
"Ms. Black, what in Merlin's name happened?" The healer asked, and Asteria couldn't resist letting out a desperate laugh.
"The Dark Lord wanted her or you to use for information, but you were too hard to catch, and she knew Shane and didn't question his appearance, even though he finished school when she did." Yaxley coughed violently.
Harry took the package, holding it gently, it wasn't large, but Harry handled it as it weighed more than anything, as his calloused hands delicately unwrapped it, and opening the box. Draco felt his heart slamming against his chest, his breath stuck in his throat.
"Oh, my sweet, young Harry Potter." She murmured as she ran her hand in his unruly, black hair. She rubbed his back as he cried in her lap. Asteria looked down at the young boy in her lap, feeling the pain in his body. He had lost so much, too much for someone of his age. Not even 18 years old, and tossed into a war that shouldn't be his problem. She could understand Draco's anger from earlier.
"Like that's much better. Sirius Black is a death eater." The plump witch replied, trying to intimidate her.
"I'll be okay." She responded, looking at him, his red hair, the light brushing of freckles and bright blue eyes, the square set of his jaw and full lips, he was everything she'd ever wanted in a person, and he cared about her, just her. "Charlie, thank you for always being here. But I need a favor before they wake up."
"And I you, my sweet boy." She responded as she pulled away. She looked at Draco and smiled at him. "And you as well." She took a hand of Harry, and touched Draco's face as well, wiping a stray tear off his pale face.
"Oh," he squeaked and sank lower into his chair. Asteria shook her head and began prepping breakfast with Sirius, who patted her shoulder and began helping her with breakfast.
"Are you ready, love?" Harry's voice broke through his thoughts and Draco sighed, looking at Harry. Or Barry, as was his name for the night.
Narcissa Malfoy, you are being cleared of all charges, please follow Auror Duggan so he can return your wand and personal property." Kingsley supplied, before facing the front. "Auror Smith, please bring in the next one." Asteria stood, she didn't need to see any more convictions. Lucius was convicted at the beginning of the day. Sentenced to life in Azkaban, not chance at freedom. The old wizard took his punishment with a bow of his head and didn't struggle or fight as they carted him off. Neither her nor Draco reacted with the sentencing. Her exit was followed by her brother and Harry, she stood outside the large room and watched as Harry and Draco whispered to each other.
"Sia, come inside please." Charlie's voice broke through the silence and she looked at him, tears clear in her eyes, his eyes widen as he came forward, pulling her into his arms. She buried her face into his neck and let him hold her.
"I don't want to hear it, Lucius." She began, her grey eyes connecting with his. "You beat me constantly throughout my childhood, you shipped me off to hide me from everyone, you forced me into a tournament I wanted nothing to do with, that also almost killed me. You worshipped the creature who did try to kill me, who, mind you, almost succeeded." She tried to stop, even when she felt Harry's calm presence on her arm, but she was on a role.
"Well, this is going to end well." Asteria spoke up, and smiled as she dropped in arm over Potter's shoulders. "Don't worry, I'll make sure he survives." She smiled at the Professor and lead the younger boy out of the backroom.
She had gotten a new wand from Ollivander, she had barely even mentioned it when he summoned one from his shop and handed it to her with a wink. She'd sat on the front porch testing the new wand, it was different from her old one, stronger and her magic seemed to be even more powerful than before and she had to readjust her force when using simple spells.
“Have at it.” He said and gestured at the trunk so that Draco could pick a set of clothes and they could be through with this very awkward situation. Draco’s head popped out from the cloak rather comically. His hair stood up in one place from being rumpled by the fabric. Harry had noticed that he wasn’t gelling his hair back anymore and it looked rather nice. Harry was thrown from his musings when Draco picked up a pair of boxers and held them up.
He thought about the interaction every so often and used it as his excuse to feel no guilt about pulling out the map and looking it over to find the dot that read Draco Malfoy, which is exactly what he did that night before going to bed. He did it most nights now that he thought about it.
“Um. Well.” He couldn’t really think of much else to say. He felt a little helpless and decided to just go for honesty. “I’m not really sure.”
“If I cannot be seen like this, don’t you think it would be best if only I were under the cloak?” Draco asked once again spelling it out.
“You always wanted me to come to you if anything was wrong, right?” He asked getting right to the point.
“Er right.” Harry replied as he turned around to face the back of the room. He heard rustling for a minute and then another frustrated huff.
“um.” Harry said intelligently doing his very best to not let his eyes wander. He may have caught sight of thin white scars on Malfoy’s chest and then a black shape on his left wrist before Malfoy turned his wrist towards himself effectively blocking it from view. He forced himself to drag his eyes back up to meet Malfoy’s icy ones. He found it equally hard to maintain eye contact and decided it was a losing battle no matter where he looked.
“No.” Harry decided. “We’re both going back to the Slytherin dorms so you’ll have some backup in case they decide to try to jump you again.” Harry shot back, still walking and leading them both out of the 8th year dorm. Draco spluttered indignantly behind him. Harry had a hard time not laughing.
“You can’t follow me around all the time.” Draco pointed out. “I’ll be alone in the dorm with them eventually.”
When they finally had a handle on their breathing Draco pulled Harry’s head off his shoulder and met his eyes. He searched Harry’s face and must have found whatever he was looking for because he pulled him into another soft kiss. When they separated this time Harry pulled Draco into a tight embrace. He used the wall to hold them up and relaxed against the blonde. Draco let out a slow breath and buried his head in Harry’s shoulder.
Harry thought about that. He supposed he could just decide later and it would be better to have the full education that everyone else got. Besides it would also keep him away from the rest of the wizarding world for a bit and maybe he could feel a little normal for a while.
Harry walked quickly and planned out how he would broach the topic as he stopped in front of the gargoyle statue. He gave the password and took the revolving staircase to the Headmistresses office.
“If anyone is giving thanks it should be me. I don’t know why you did it, but thank you for speaking at our trials. I believe it is the only thing that kept me and Draco from being sentenced to Azkaban.”
“I wasn’t very hungry.” Draco answered still not taking the box. Harry shrugged and set the box down on top of Draco’s trunk.
“Look, I wasn’t sure how well an ex-death eater would be received, and I felt it was best to just remove myself from the situation. I would have only put people on edge.” Draco’s voice had changed. He sounded sincere and he wasn’t being snarky. He looked mildly uncomfortable, but there was a modicum of pleading in his voice asking Harry to understand.
He glanced over to the couch that he was laying in front of. ‘Well, maybe not too alone.’ he thought as he subtly observed Ron and Hermione cuddling on the couch. It wasn’t uncommon for his two best friends to show affection in public like this seeing as they were a couple. It also wasn’t uncommon for Harry to feel a little lonely when he saw it. He was immensely happy for them of course, but sometimes he wondered of he would ever achieve that level of intimacy with someone else. He wondered if anyone would be able to see past the scar on his forehead and treat him like a normal person. That he could be a person someone else loved just for the pure fact that he was Harry, not the savior of the Wizarding world. Just Harry. He let out a slow breath and cast a quick tempus. It was nearly eleven. He took another moment to take in the warmth of the fire before he heaved himself up.
Harry lay sprawled on the floor in front of the roaring fire in the common room fireplace. He was trying to relax after a long day of classes and avoiding the hero worship from the younger students. It actually hadn’t been as bad as he thought as most of the other students had been suffering the same war. It was mostly the new first years and a handful of second years who still gawked and tried to dredge up the nerve to thank him. Harry didn’t want their thanks or recognition, he just wanted to be left alone.
“I- It would be wrong of them to do anything. He’s been pardoned. If other people can’t see that then I’ll speak with them.” Harry felt he would do that for anyone he saw being mistreated because of which side they were on in the war.
“Will you be returning to Hogwarts this fall to complete your studies?” Narcissa asked. Harry felt himself frown. That really was the million galleon question. He wasn’t sure of what he wanted right now. After the war he was so tired of fighting he wasn’t sure he could follow the auror path he had originally set out for. He still wanted to help with the efforts to get the wizarding world back to normal and he wanted to help eliminate the discrimination against muggleborns and werewolves, but he wasn’t sure he could handle the stress of getting wrapped up with more dark wizards.
“You can do it.” Hermione encouraged. Harry slouched his shoulders defeatedly and, tossing one last betrayed look at his friends, left the common room. Hopefully Draco wouldn’t be in the room anymore by the time Harry got there.
“Guess you’re not a briefs guy.” He quipped. Harry snatched the underpants from Draco’s hand. His face flushing. ‘This was really all very backwards. Shouldn’t Malfoy be the one blushing? He’s the one naked after all.’ Harry thought irritably.
“I think I’ll stay here for now.” Draco said politely sounding stiff. Harry nodded in response and turned to his trunk. He grabbed out his transfiguration book and some parchment and quills. When he looked up he spotted his cloths neatly folded on the end of his bed. His lips twitched into a small smile before a thought struck him. Draco Malfoy had worn his clothes. Without underpants. He felt his face flame and decided he needed to get downstairs as quickly as possible. He turned and hurried to the door. Just as he was about he walk through the doorway Draco called after him.
Harry thought back to the summer leading up to this year. He had gone to Malfoy manner to return the wand he stole and Narcissa had invited him in for tea. He hadn’t felt capable of refusing so he found himself in the sitting room of Malfoy manner, back rigid in a chair sipping tea with his childhood nemesis’ mother. She asked after his health politely and he stuttered out an answer that he was fine and he hoped she was as well. There was a minute of awkward silence before Harry couldn’t come up with anymore polite conversation and said what was on his mind.
“It doesn’t matter why.” Because truthfully Harry himself wasn’t entirely sure. “We’ll move your things in, or I’ll write your mum about what happened today.”
Draco took a deep breath and reached forward. He tugged Harry’s jeans open and hurriedly wrapped his hands around him. He timed his strokes with the brunette’s and Harry let out a shaky moan. This encouraged Draco to move a little faster with firmer strokes. Harry sped up his movements and Draco followed suite. It didn’t take much longer to bring them both to the edge. Just as Harry was toppling over into his climax he leaned forward and captured Draco’s mouth in a hungry kiss. He felt Draco shudder against him and moaned into the kiss. They pulled apart and their labored breath ghosted against each other’s pink faces. Harry felt boneless and tipped his head forward to lean on Draco’s shoulder.
“That’s very sweet of him.” Hermione commented. Harry could only nod. He glanced down at the school uniform he was wearing. It was Saturday and he could wear whatever he wanted, but he usually wore his uniform to avoid wearing the old clothes from his ‘relatives’. He had the sudden desire to go change into these new clothes.
Actually, that gave him an idea. Harry’s eyes slid to the extra bed next to his that still stood in the room. The one that was supposed to belong to Malfoy. After another moment of thought Harry made up his mind and started heading for the door as Draco finished pulling on the pair of trainers.
“They don’t really fit I suppose I just haven’t gotten around to going shopping.” Harry said feeling a bit embarrassed. He didn’t really care what he was wearing when he was on the run from Voldemort, but he supposed he should try to dress a little nicer since he could actually go out and shop for himself now. Draco made a frustrated noise and finally settled on an over sized black t-shirt that was a little wrinkled, but didn’t have any holes and a pair of jeans that only had one hole in the knee.
“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this.” Harry told him. Draco’s eyes snapped open and searched his face for any sign of a lie. When he found none he swallowed hard.
“Do you like him?” She asked quietly. Harry frowned and hesitated. He wanted to deny it right away, but there was a part of him that he’d been squashing down for weeks, months. If he thought hard enough he may be able to trace the feeling back by years, but he really wasn’t ready for that level of introspection.
"Whatever, Lupin," Draco muttered as he focused. "It was a dark curse, Mrs. Weasley, I'm not sure there is anything we can do, to grow back his ear, but we should be able to heal it."
Silence, the absence of sound. Seemed to be even worse than being without light. You'd never know if someone was coming up behind you or not.
"I owed you one, kid." She responded, as the Minister bustled into the room, and she turned, expecting questions, but instead got anger, and she was taken back. He dropped the Cup down, filled to the brim with Gallons, and crossed his shoulders.
"McGonagall offered me a teaching position." Asteria supplied, thinking back to an hour ago when the new Headmistress offered her the position as the new DADA position or even Potions, as Professor Slughorn decided to return to his retirement.
"Unrecognizable," George said in a mock aristocratic voice.  And Draco chuckled, before grabbing his thick cloak and heading outside, he paused and looked back.
The third task was a maze, hedge's had been grown over the Quidditch pitch after the second task, and the maze itself would be filled with dangerous creatures and riddles, for each champion to face. Asteria had grown worried at this point. She was a capable witch, but even she had her limits. With her classes and stress from the tournament, she had grown irritable, she hadn't been sleeping much, and it didn't help that she was told that her mother and father were supposed to be at Hogwarts for the final task. Asteria had decided to concede during the maze, if she reached the center first, she would give the win to whoever got there second. Just to spite her father at this point. He hadn't checked in on her, or even Draco at this point.
With trembling hands, he had a look at the photographs. Draco had never spoken to him about his past and he had always wondered about the reason. When he looked at the photographs, he realized why.
He turned around to find Petunia Dursley looking at him with horrified eyes and Dudley looking at the ceiling, ashamed. Tessa was simply sitting on the sofa, her eyes on her lap, her shoulders shaking a little. She was crying soundlessly again. This gesture infused a spark of cold fury inside him. A small girl should not have to hide her pain like this. She should not hide her fear just because others would feel that she is dirty or week.
"Don't you know how to go back," she asked and Dumbledore looked at her from his half moon spectacles. His eyes still didn't give anything away.
It was Longbottom who broke the silence "Malfoy. Did they force themselves on you." Draco shrugged and looked upon his lap, completely changing the topic "So, they paid me and –"
"Off with you Potter. You mustn't be late." Potter smiles at Severus. Severus doesn't. He is too conflicted. He knows that Potter is doing this for Draco but it will not bode well for Potter and he doesn't like it.
Harry stared at him "What are you-" He never got complete his sentence because Draco punched him straight on his nose.
Harry tried to control his breathe. It would be useless if he panicked when Draco needed him to be strong for him.
"What happened? Why are you crying?" Harry realizes that his eyes are burning and there are dry tear tracks on his cheeks.
A voice said inside her mind. The voice sounded eerily like Lily who was apparently alive. This was unbelievable. The sofa and table in the drawing-room were in disarray. So was the dining room. The chairs were half-broken as if someone had picked them up and thrown them on the floor. The smell grew stronger as she neared the cupboard. It was dark. The curtains were drawn and she felt that she had suddenly transformed her boring life into a horror movie. Vernon had disappeared. Petunia stopped walking and looked around. It was so silent and then from nowhere a bat flew over her head and settled over the fan. She stared at the creature.
"Damnit. Got to lose weight- can't even run properly- he is in so much pain." Harry would have stared at the man in shock if he were able to.
"Let's go to our bedroom." He whispered and bent down to pick Draco in his lap. He took hold of his legs and Draco placed his hands on Harry's shoulders. Harry licked Draco's belly button and noticed the way Draco closed his eyes and sweat became even more profound on his cheeks.
"This isn't an answer Severus." Draco starts and sits up before placing a pillow behind his back, "What're we going to do about Burbage. It's like he has put the entire wizarding world under a spell. It's like 'the dark lord's era' all over again."
"Draco, one of these days, he'll catch you red-handed and you'll lose him." Says Pansy out of the blue and before Draco can snap at her, she has already gone to talk to Daphne.
His eyes were glued firmly on Draco who was looking at the scattered broken bottles and old pizza boxes and dirty dishes. When he turned back towards him, his eyes were full of restrained fury.
Petunia opens her mouth to say something but nothing escapes from it. A sob wracks her frame when she realizes that this child will never meet his mother. Petunia was supposed to protect Lily like she had promised she will.
Draco's voice was clear and his face was wet and his hands were still trembling but he kept on looking at Harry and Harry stayed silent for as long as he could.
"Draco. I am opening the door." Still, Draco did not answer and Harry cast a wandless spell to open the door and his heart clenched when he saw Draco curled in a ball on the corner of his bed, trying to rub his body all over with his hands.
"Have your breakfast and do not disturb me," Granger answered in a monotone. Her head, once more, was bent upon the papers and so Draco could not see her expression. But, judging from her voice, she was angry.
"We have company, Harry." Draco spoke in a voice that could barely conceal his desire, completely distracted from the fact that he had just wanted to kill their unexpected visitors.
This time no one would be able to stop the inevitable from happening and he would leave Harry in peace. With these thoughts in his mind, he unlocked his door. Surprisingly, their were no tears in his eyes. He went inside the kitchen and decided to do it the muggle way. But first, first he wanted to remember Harry and his eyes, his smile, his innocence and his beauty, his honesty.
"It does not concern you." Draco said and his eyes were a bit hurt. Harry knew that Draco was under a misconception that Harry did not care so he decided to clear his doubts "There are other ways to find Draco. I could have already tried but I did not, not because I don't care, but because I do not want you to be compelled to do anything at all. Mark my words and remember them, the moment I realize the identity of this person and his friends, I will destroy them and I will find everything, no matter you want or not. I have a hunch as to who the writer is. I will give you time to tell me. If you don't, I will have to take steps."
This decided, he apparated. He wanted to return to his own manor, he did. Unfortunately, his mind decided to apparate right in front of the Malfoy manor. He started walking towards the gate of the manor. It opened when he touched the handle. He went inside and the door closed behind him. Voldemort just could not get those scratches out of his mind.
By the time Potter's voice reaches her ears, her hands are trembling badly. He is staring at her, his soup only half finished.
"Head auror Potter." Scorpius murmurs softly. Harry looks up to find him closing the door behind him.
"Okay. If you don't know the address, take it from Severus." Draco murmured and without listening another word the man said, he walked away although he couldn't help but hear a softly whispered, "Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. Thank you so-"
Harry removed the shirt and vest and Draco stood in front of him in his trousers, his eyes desperate.
Draco found himself looking at Black, waiting for him to meet Draco's eyes so that Draco could communicate his surprise and confusion. Potter looked back at the wall and Black turned his eyes back at Draco.
"WHY CAN'T I EVER BE ENOUGH FOR YOU? WHY MUST I ALWAYS HIDE THINGS IN THE FEAR THAT YOU WILL LEAVE ME?" Draco stopped and a lone tear fell from his left eye. Perhaps, he had restrained it for long. Harry did not speak anything because he wanted Draco to speak out. He wanted to know. "Why do you always calm me down? Why can't you understand that his presence tortures me? He was one of them. He took everything away from me, my dignity, my self respect, my confidence, everything and because of what- because I had teased his family when I was a silly kid. He could just have spoken to me and I would have – would have apologised. Why did he punish me by- by- he took everything from me, he and his bloody wife and his-. They were the reason we always quarrelled, always snatching you away from me. I tried to tell you but you never understood me."
Harry stares at both of them while sitting back. He is truly at a loss. What are they on about. Okay, maybe he asks his elf and Albus about her sometimes. But he is certainly not obsessed. He didn't have any crush on her.
They land in the seating room and Draco flicks his fingers. A soft music starts playing and Draco places his hands on Harry's shoulders.
Soft sunlight was streaming through the windows when Petunia woke. It was warm today. Slowly, she opened her eyes and yawned, placing her palm on her mouth. The other side of the bed was empty. It surprised her because it was Saturday and so Vernon should be sleeping right now. He slept in on Saturdays and anyways he woke Petunia up for breakfast. She sat up and rubbed her eyes.
Hermione had completed the check up and was now sitting on the opposite chair "You can visit a mind healer for this and if you don't want to tell a third person about it, you can have sessions with Harry, that is if you feel comfortable with him. It is possible that you scream, or cry or break things to let it out so just let yourself be. Know that we understand. Your injuries are extensive. I can only imagine the extent of trauma you are in."
"Professor, I understand your reluctance, but I can lay all the protection charms, as well as the Keepers one, I know who'd I give the honor too as well, and near the ending of summer we will all go to the Weasley's, which mind you is more publicly known than my own home, he'll be safe and I think he'd prefer it as well."
Asteria stood in the compartment with the Prefects, shocked to see her brother and Parkinson, but listened to the Head Boy bark out orders, and she just sighed, she was still tired, and Granger was eyeing her suspiciously. Asteria had a sinking thought that Granger might have heard her breaking down last night, but she shook off the thought, and focused, as the Prefects as they began to file out, she didn't react when her little brother grabbed her hand and squeezed it, mostly because he didn't acknowledge it in his face, and Asteria felt a breath leave her at the contact. In all of this, her biggest worry was Draco and Potter. They were all she could emotionally focus on. She let out a sigh as he left and nodded at Granger. This is where things got tricky, she'd have to sit with her House mates, before retiring to the Head common room, but she let out a breath and sat in the compartment, and ignored her counterpart, and leaned her head back when a cough drew her attention. The Ravenclaw Head Boy was looking at her.
"Detention already?!?" She asked, barely shocked. "Blimey, Potter, starting this year off with a plan, eh?" She smiled and shoved him in front of her, and they exited the library, only to slip off separately once the library doors closed behind them. She walked to the Great Hall, slipping in unnoticed and sat down, grabbing a plate and filling, sitting down away from the others. She had patrols after dinner, and still had loads of homework to do and she was simply tired at this point. The altercation with Draco, her stressing out over Umbridge and spending in some time in the restricted section had exhausted her.  Focusing on trying to eat her fill, she almost didn't noticed the eyes watching her from various part of her table, but she wasn't so clueless not to feel the stares, glancing up she picked up on the various looks across the table, some were pure mean; stares from people who had labeled her a traitor; but a few, were envious of something, it wasn't her name, she didn't have that anymore, nor was it her wealth because it was unknown to most how much she actually had; maybe it was envy to her ability to actually think for herself, unlike so many others in her House.
"He'll be okay, they won't let anything happen to him." Ginny supplied, but the sentiment didn't reach her eyes, she knew as well as he did, the dangers her own family was taking.
"I honestly don't know, we'll find out more once the St. Mungo's healers get here. But Ms. Black, I don't know if you will be safe here." She finally said, and Asteria nodded.
Asteria stood back to back with Arthur Weasley near the Black Lake, she had so far tossed six Death Eaters into the freezing waters and hadn't flinched when the merpeople had disposed of those individuals, nor when the Giant Squid had reached its tentacles out and snatched two more that had stepped too close to the edge of the water. Arthur dueled like a seasoned pro behind her, and she had lost track of Percy as the fight wore on. But George was fighting as expertly as his father, next to Dean Thomas. She felt the ground shuddered and glanced at the forest for a second, not seeing anything, she returned to the fight, she knew unfortunately that some had gotten into the castle, using other entrances and windows out of their line of sight. She had found pride in her selected family as Arthur had wrestled one out of a window when the fight began.
"I didn't come home, because I couldn't. Draco, I was there, I saw everything. I watched our father grovel at Voldemort's feet, and it was disgusting. And then what Voldemort did to Potter?"
"Please, let's move past your inability to accept that I'm not mother or Draco." She replied, sitting across from him.
"You'll just have to learn on your own, Ms. Black. I'm sure you are capable, though I'm sure you know much about the subject matter." His response didn't shock her, but she still grew slightly irritated.
But when darkness fell, and she was left alone to her thoughts, Draco and Charlie sleeping peacefully on two transfigured couches, a distorted voice would replay her own prophecy and her mind would wander to the Slytherin's tomb under the school. She'd wonder what it would all mean, how it would play out in the final battle that she had accepted would happen at Hogwarts. Maybe someway she could use the chamber.
Hesitation wasn't part of Asteria's usual behavior, but something about jumping into a hole, caused just that, but before she could reason with herself, she jumped, going down a slide into a pile of bones, if the light from her wand alerted her to anything that was it. And she almost shrieked at the sight of a large snake skin. She knew it was the Basilisk's skin, she wondered how long it took a snake that large to shed its skin. The larger the snake, the longer the process. Inching her way around the skin, she found fallen rocks, and with a flick of her wand began moving them out of her way, before moving forward into the dark hall. Coming upon another door, she flicked her wand, and hissing sounds appeared again, opening the new door.
Snape, Bellatrix, Greyback, and Alecto Carrow had been in the Astronomy tower with Dumbledore and Harry, so they hadn't done it. Gibbin was dead, and Amycus Carrow wasn't smart enough. But Yaxley and Selwyn were capable, as were his previous friends, who would've kidnapped her just to earn Voldemort's favor. But where would one of them hide her? Malfoy Manor wasn't an option, no matter her faults, his mother wouldn't allow it. Despite most belief's Crabbe and Goyle weren't as stupid as everyone thought, but if his old friends had done it, it would've been Zabini who had done it. But something about the entire situation was still bugging him. Asteria was a trained duelist, an expert battle strategist, and wouldn't have let her guard down for anything, especially during battle. So either she had let herself be taken, which was highly unlikely, or she hadn't viewed whoever it had been as an enemy. Who could've been involved, but not seen by the Order, and not viewed as a threat by Asteria, who viewed everyone as a threat, unless she knew them?
Asteria stumbled into the classroom holding the Goblet, in her rumpled clothes and a piece of toast in her mouth. Students were surrounding the glowing circle around the Goblet. She watched as the identical Weasley boys made their attempt to enter, and nearly dropped her toast, as they were flung past her, grazing her and hitting the ground. Her eyes wide, the toast hanging from her lips, watching as their identical red hair fade into grey and long beards sprouted from their faces. They looked at each other with astonishing looks on their faces and the room was deafeningly silent. When a shocked sound exploded from her lips, and her toast dropped to the floor, and laughter bubbled out. Her knees caved, as she hit the ground, laughing at the Weasley twins, and as they stared at her, they busted out laughing as well, and it was followed by the rest of the students in the room.
"Apologies, Professor McGonagall." Asteria supplied, watching the fugitive closely. He was rumored to be in league with Voldemort, but he hadn't been at the meeting, and the look of pure concern for Potter on his face spoke to her. The entire room was stunned into silence. "I'm guessing the prophet has been lying about you and your loyalty, Sirius Black." She spoke up, and all eyes jumped to her.
"Yes, Draco." She replied and chuckled. "It was a simple spell, mostly used for parting sand and mountains. I've only ever tested in on small bodies of water, like ponds. But I figured it would work, as long as I moved fast." She explained as they reached the castle.
"Oh," Draco muttered under his breath, she knew her attacker, which could've been obvious, but it also meant she didn't view that particular person as a threat. Maybe a Slytherin he had known but didn't realize was involved in Voldemort's plans. Possibly Nott, but Draco doubted that. Theo Nott had been raised by his mother after his father's arrest years ago, and even Theo hated his father. Parkinson, maybe? No, Asteria didn't trust her in any sense and knew better than to underestimate the Slytherin female. Unless it wasn't a Slytherin.
Going left, he found a living room, and a dining room, cutting out he went back to the entryway and went right, finding a sitting room and a kitchen, and finding a simple door and Draco pushed it forward, stumbling on a steep set of stairs, using his wand Draco inched his way down, and found the most spectacular sight, a large four-poster bed sat in the middle of the room, and the sheets were fresh and clean but messy on one side which supplied that someone slept here, which meant that someone was sleeping here, but probably just apparating in and out of this room and going nowhere else in the house. Draco wasn't sure exactly how to go about using this to his advantage, but cast a disillusionment charm and sat in a corner of the room, hoping for a sign that what he was doing was right.
This was always his plan, check to see if she even lived, but it was hard to tell. He was almost positive his sister wouldn't spill any secrets, but a part of him had hoped because it would reveal she was at least alive. Draco took a deep breath and rolled his shoulders, deciding to release his facial transfigurations. He let out a sigh of relief as he pulled a top strand down and recognized his platinum hair. He pushed himself up the stairs and went to his sister's room, looking it over as he found a seat on her bed. When a light appeared.
"Stupify, incarcous" she shouted at the nearest Carrow, who dropped as ropes covered them, and the other vanished with Snape. The hall erupted in voices, as Asteria stepped out of the shadows to the front of the hall, walking back to Harry. Everyone began separating as McGonagall ushered students out of the hall and out of the school, and Asteria stood in the Hall, staring at the proceedings before following the Gryffindor Head to the front of the school. She offered no comfort just cold determination, as she began instructing everyone to put up protection charms, and Asteria followed suit, her wand raised to the sky as she watched the charms take hold. She stepped back, and watched the others do the same, she didn't listen to McGonagall as she gave orders to a handful of students but wasn't surprised to see Seamus smile darkly as he took off, and she turned and disappeared, slipping up the stairs to find the unused girls restroom, she pointed her wand at the sink and instantly threw herself down the old hole, rolling to her feet once she hit the floor.
"I am, but only because I want you to be safe. But I also know you, and you wouldn't be Sia if you hid from this all." He grasped her hand as he spoke, and kissed the back of it. "I love you." He whispered against her skin, and her heart jumped, her eyes wide as she looked at him.
"Asteria?" Molly's voice was already angry, and Asteria squared her shoulders, and set her bag down, turning to face the woman, who stood her arms on her hips, but her children, including Potter and Granger, stood behind her, and Asteria grabbed the bag and plastered a smile on her face.
"I need to fight, Charlie." She whispered, she'd seen his apprehension as she had begun retraining her body and magic.
"Loathed as I am to say this, but she isn't wrong, mum," Ron spoke out before his mother could blow. Asteria looked at Alice and then Charlie, and sighed.
"It isn't safe anymore. I know that they didn't get in my mind, but I also know that until it's over. And it's not the same anymore." She replied, and pulled away from him. She waved her wand so her trunk and Harry's vanished, and began trekking down the stairs, her heart heavy.
"Listen, we'll come and get you from the showers if anything happens, but it won't do her any good if you catch a cold." Ron supplied, flinching at Draco's leveled stare. "Don't look at me like that, I already feel like a git, I just don't know how to find them."
Once at the large doors of the school, her facade nearly slipped, but she straightened her shoulders and took a delicate spot at the end of the Slytherin table. She didn't really want to deal with this, the tournament would start taking names just after she turned 17, all the transferring had affected her schooling. She didn't particularly want to participate, though a chance to win that much money that was purely hers and not connected to her family was almost worth it, even though she had, over the summer, removed her 'allowance' from the family vault, opening one of her own, taking the first steps to distance herself from the Malfoy name. She wasn't the Heir, Draco was.
"Angry, and protective, as usual. I told him about why father wanted to me to enter the tournament so badly, and he didn't react well." Asteria shrugged.
"This is a Malfoy heirloom, the only thing I had on me when I moved into Asteria's. It's Goblin-made and embodied with Elf magic." Draco pushed the box to the trio, "This should give you a better connection, with a larger signal strength."
"Ah, and this is where things change, Mr. Potter was working under my orders," Dumbledore spoke, and Asteria nearly laughed out loud at his claim, it was reasonable enough but shocking enough.
"Think you are so clever." His whispered, standing to his feet. He didn't speak until he was parallel with her, heading towards his room with mother. "But yes, daughter, I had a blast."
"If...If something happens to my baby girl, I don't blame you, Sia." She choked, "Ali made her choices, and I know you denounced your father. No choice he makes or made, effects the fact that you are like a daughter to me as well." She stuttered out, and Asteria couldn't breathe, she couldn't be here, she went to stand when a bird flew into the office window, dropping a letter in Dumbledore's hand. He quickly read it, and she could see it in his face. She could feel it in her very soul. There was no way Ali wouldn't have responded to her letter.
Her eyes took in the sight of Draco and Charlie, staring at her in shock, and then laughing hysterically. Her brother looked tired, his black jeans and shirt were wrinkled and he had dark circles under his grey eyes, his pale hair fell around his face. He looked haggard, but the light in his eyes was still there. Charlie looked much the same, his smile lighting up his tired face. While the two of them laughed, she gently pushed herself up and felt her muscles protest but she sat up, the room tilted slightly, but she did it, sat up, and leaned against the bed frame as the men in front of her finally stopped laughing and looked at her.
