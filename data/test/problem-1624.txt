sorry for the delay ,  christmas is a nightmare
“Honestly? No, I trust that my sister won’t hurt me, but my trust in her has always been misplaced” She confessed. As the baby of the family Narcissa had always been the subject of cruelty from her sister Bella and sometimes even Andromeda. Of course, Andy had always been a little more kind, her jokes had been that, but the madness in Bella had started young. “But we do what we must for our children. Do you have children, Kingsley?”
“Is that a good idea?”
“Excuse me, in case you haven’t noticed Potter you are a man, you can’t produce a child no matter how much we try...” Draco wiggled his eybrows and Harryy flushed hitting him on the shoulder as he growled;
“Such a sweet boy, but we both know that its not true. But I will make it up to you! I can get your aunt and uncle to let me borrow you, I will say that I need your help sorting out my house” She suggested brightly and Harry felt hope bubble up inside of him. He knew that he couldn’t keep his books and gifts from Draco hidden all the time and he was scared what would happen if they found out. Maybe she would let him keep them here until he went to school. “You will just have to pretend that’s what you’re doing. You will get away from that bully of a cousin of yours as well”
“So, Harry the first thing you need to do is mount your broom, the way Draco has, very good, are you left-handed or right handed?”
“Um…I…Banana…Please, dad”
“Beautiful, what does it mean?”
*-*-*-*
“No! It’s amazing! Your magic wants to stay with me! I bet if I did the same spell my magic would want to be with you!” Draco’s thin pale arm landed around his waist pulling him up into a lazy hug as he lay his chin on his head before saying “What did you think of Professor Flitwick? He seems fun! His face when his father made him promise to floo his mother!”
“No, this is your room” Draco announced sitting up as well and Harry’s mouth dropped open a hiss escaping from his nose and mouth as his head whipped around to look at him again.
“Fuck off you fag! I ain’t no fucking pansy…” Blackmore threw himself at Diggory but the Hufflepuff was faster, and the boy stumbled over his own feet soon ending up in a heap on his nose without Diggory having to do anything. The students that were lingering in the hall watching laughed.
“Ex hodie pater pueri”
“Harry dear, you are looking pale” She said letting go of the long fingers and coming to kneel in front of him her hands moving over his leg as he whispered;
“May I just have a sweet green tea please?” Narcissa asked and Jinx nodded setting to work “How are you Harry dear? I’m sorry that you were stressed out”
“Are you okay?” Draco asked as he always did when Harry had been having his mind healing and Harry nodded giving a smile as he jerked his head in the direction of the violin. The tiny teacher was packing away the sheets of music.
“Yup! And they all have their own personalities! It’s fun! Though the lion head is the main one. I will introduce you properly! Are you ready to go in?”
“Whatsit?”
“Come on Harry, let’s get going”
“What are you apologising for?” Severus asked, his eyebrow lifted slowly up his pale forehead vanishing into his fringe. Harry shrugged and then collected himself knowing that Severus liked him to be more direct.
“You smell…Like…The ocean and the sun…You smell like my Omega.” Draco hissed unbelieving as he clutched at Severus’ hand and brought his nose to the fingers. Severus clearly didn’t approve but he stayed still as the young prince breathed in the scent he had been craving. “Where is he?” Draco almost whined as he rubbed his nose against the sleeve that held most of the scent knowing that it would soon be faded. “Severus, where is he?”
“You will find, Hadrian, that there is little that I don’t find out about here in school.”
“I think all parents are like that”
“Of course, I will check the lunar cycle” Narcissa informed him with a wave of the hand “And we will have to arrange it around school, the boys will both be in Hogwarts by then”
Boris the brave was a bedtime story I wrote for my nephews based on his pet hamster xD
“Harry, while I am speaking with your aunt why don’t you show Draco your room?” Lucius asked carefully and although he frowned Harry started walking to his cupboard.
“Yes, it’s very nice to meet you” Draco smiled holding out his hand in a greeting. Harry nervously lapped at his lips and then he moved forward and took his hand giving it a tentative shake.
“Don’t argue, Harry, you are not forcing us, we want you to…” His father said almost sternly but there was a soft look in his eyes. He checked his pocket watch and then sighed softly putting on his outer robe preparing to head back to Hogwarts. Harry was upset that he was leaving already, he had gotten used to having both his father’s around over Christmas and it was upsetting that Severus was hardly here during the week as they were preparing for exams. “Now, why don’t you and Draco come to Hogwarts with me for an hour or two, you could join me for dinner with Remus and allow Narcissa and Lucius some time alone”
“Two sons, one magical the other not. They both went to fight in the second war, neither came home”
“Master Draco is a flatterer Little Master Harry!” Jinx squeaked happily grinning as she poured out the drinks and handed them to them “Would little Masters like something from the kitchens? Chocolate or...”
“I liked it” The snake hissed from around his throat and Harry was about to respond when he heard a shuffling of feet from the door to the bedroom. Looking up he saw two of his new roommates, Albright and Pointer, standing there. He had no idea how long they had been there, but he felt a wave of self-conscious panic wash over him as he tried to quickly put his guitar away.

“Thank-you, Pansy”
Oh my god! I am so very sorry! I never meant to be away as long as I have been. I had the surgery, and it went well but I just started feeling sorry for myself all I wanted was my dad and that sparked a major depressive episode that I am only just managing to fight my way out of. I’ve been doing nothing but play on video games, I have no idea how many times I’ve gone through Mass Effect and Dragon age…I’m on Skyrim again now! But I wanted to find my way back and I am,
“Fred! George! You look amazing!” Harry said tugging Draco down the last few steps his green eyes looking them over and Fred startled realising something.
Draco turned to the double doors of the ballroom trying his best not to scowl when he saw the advisor dressed in garish orange robes complete with cap that had a deep red tassel. Dumbledore’s eyes were twinkling more than ever in the lights of the ballroom and he looked for all the world like a triumphant king rather than court advisor. Draco couldn’t see his betrothed at all but he could tell that he was there from the way people were whispering and bowing. Dumbledore stopped in front of him, bowing low before stepping to the side his arm outstretched
When he had gotten back from the hospital he had tried to make the dinner but it was difficult with only one hand and he had spilt the hot water from the potatoes down his leg. Petunia had smacked him with the wooden spoon and he had been put in his cupboard.

“Nothing of import.” Severus answered his eyes following Harry’s to the journal he had been reading a few moments before. “Theodore Martin, a potion master in Germany, has some interesting ideas but I doubt any of them would have practical applications outside joke shops and the like. Though Madam Greta from Finland has some rather promising steps forward into the use of Frog spleens for repairing curse damage. Hardly anything that you would find overly interesting.”
“But not you?”
“Harry! Draco!” Twin voices shouted, loudly, as the doors to the potion classroom were thrown open. Harry looked up with a smile seeing his ginger haired friends coming in the room followed by other students from both Slytherin and Gryffindor. The twins dumped their bags onto a table at the front and then raced to them squeezing their shoulders. “What are you doing here?”
Seamus was fun. Rough around the edges like the twins and had a habit of swearing rather loudly while his mother kept hitting him gently with spells from her wand as she talked to Nino and Sho.
“Of course, we are only here to look after the best interests of Mr Potter” Her tone reminded Harry of his teachers at school who would tell him that he was just an ungrateful brat before hitting him on the back of his head.
The buzz of happiness that had come from the defence against the dark arts faded pretty quickly as Ravenclaw and Slytherin were forced to spend an hour in the greenhouses with Professor Sprout. The dumpy jovial looking teacher was outright cold whenever she looked at him or Draco. Her brown eyes cutting into them as though she wanted to flay them on the spot. It didn’t help that she seemed to give Ron house points for just breathing and took away five points each when Draco and Harry were talking about the work they were doing. She even threatened them both with detention although they had simply answered her question. Ron had copied their answer and had gotten five points. Harry didn’t argue with her treatment of him, he was used to it from his old school, but it was harder to stop Draco from speaking out. He had to hold the blonde down more than once while shaking his head. Chao-Xiang and Alice made up the points lost but Harry couldn’t help but be thankful when they were allowed to leave the stuffy greenhouse. It was a shame since he had been looking forward to the lessons after helping Narcissa in her own garden and greenhouses.
“There isn’t a lot that we can gain from a single letter Draco, talk to him more coax out more information be a friend to him and then we shall see what might be done. It might be more interesting for you than reading about Pansy’s trips to all of the cafes in Italy” Narcissa smiled pushing his hair out of his face and Draco nodded, he had already decided that he would write back to Harry without his mother telling him so but he had wanted her opinion on what he had read. “But  suspect you already intended on writing to him”
“I forgive you, please forgive yourself, don’t let Dumbledore manipulate you because of this. You deserve better...”
Harry had decided against moving into Grimwald place when moving back to the UK. He had had nothing but bad memories of the place and instead had had the whole thing torn down and everything inside had been destroyed. Although he hadn’t been there to witness it he had been happy with the memory provided by Hermione most satisfying had been the screams that Mrs Blacks picture had made. If he had been there, Harry was positive, that he would have danced around the flames.
Harry sat eating the chocolate Jinx had given him while still unable to believe that this was his room. It was so big it had a wall separating an area that held a writing desk with an arch way between and a three steps leading up to the area. He was almost certain that he was dreaming but he had pinched himself several times and the pain he had gotten proved that it was real and that he wasn’t going to wake up in his cupboard covered in blood like he had before. A soft knock sounded on the more ornate door and after a few moments it opened to reveal Narcissa and Lucius. The witch looked at the bed for a moment before looking to the chairs a smile forming on her beautiful face as she came over to them.
Harry felt his eyes prickle with a few tears as he thought about people he didn’t know doing something so kind for him. He wasn’t used to it and he doubted that he would ever be able to thank them enough.
After scraping their books back into their bags, the class bustled out of the room chattering away to themselves. Harry overheard Hermione lecturing another Gryffindor girl about the correct pronunciation of the spell, but he tuned her out for the most part focusing instead on the conversation his friends were having.
“I had given that some thought, if we were to go through with this option, if that was what Harry wanted, I thought that I would adopt him by blood and then sign him over to you as guardians. I would make for a terrible parent I am happy enough to be uncle and godfather, but it would make sure that Dumbledore would not be able to get his hands on him”
“Thank-you sir, I am really very happy that you thought about doing this but...I can’t ask you to show me your memories like this. Not when you don’t really know me, even if they are memories of my mum...” Harry whispered shyly his cheeks glowing a warm red. “Honestly I am genuinely happy and I would like to know about her but...If you would like you could tell me about her yourself, or...Maybe when we’ve gotten to know each other better you could show me them yourself? I don’t know how it works but...”
“Green is reptiles. Snakes, Lizards, Dragons…
Boy was a servant from the village beyond the Forbidden forest Draco had met him by chance one summers day when his horse had thrown a shoe and he had taken a tumble in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.
?” Agnus asked moving closer to him so the bum on the female Chimera was facing him. Harry looked nervously at Masaki, but he was teaching Draco to pet Brutus and he nodded slowly and whispered
“I’m working on dark creatures, Sevvie” Remus laughed and although Severus scowled at the nickname, he didn’t say anything, and he even managed to give a thin smile. Harry’s own smile was broad as he listened to the playful bickering realising that they were walking away from the map and he was once again feeling a lot more comfortable. “There are kelpies here as well, now them I do know about”
“I believe you. I am surprised you told me, most adults like to keep secrets”
“Nothing. I am sure you would just ignore it anyway, Draco, I wish you joy” Lucius answered in a painfully false bright voice that was as icy as the north pole. Draco counted the seconds only getting to three before the older Malfoy spoke again. “But if you will ask my advice I would urge you to reconsider. Potter has nothing to gain by stringing you along for fun however you have much to lose. You have only just started to build your reputation as a wandmaker. When Potter eventually grows tired of his little game the fault will not be with him. You can’t possibly believe that Potter is truly interested. You will be a laughing stock! …”
“Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?” The girl from the train with the bushy hair asked in a nasally tone which Draco knew would soon grate on his nerves. It was the sort of tone that said quite clearly ‘I’m better at anything than you’. Draco knew the tone well, it was the same one that he himself used, however, he hated hearing it on other people. Nick’s top lip curled and then he slowly pulled on of his ears saying,
“And now you’ve ruined it, wolf” He said knowing it wasn’t true. Remus laughed again the warm sound filling the room and Severus found himself laughing along.
“How did you get so good at this?”
“I’m sure Uncle Lucius will do that” Harry said through a mouthful of toothpaste. It was different to the one the Dursley’s brought. It tingled on his tongue and around his gums and tasted not just of mint but also cloves.
“For being so…So, cruel to you…” Harry muttered almost hating the tears that were slipping down his face. Both men looked confused, Severus more than Remus and the potion master shook his head saying
“like I would trust you in a Joke shop with Potter’s son” Severus muttered dryly and Remus gave a smile feeling suddenly like he was a teen again as he darted inside calling out;
“It’s a courtship mate!” Ron spluttered showering him with bacon before Hermione could even speak and Harry noticed that that didn’t please their female friend. Surprisingly though Ron seemed to know a lot about the subject. “It’s a pure blood thing, mate, an heir will get it in his head that he likes some girl he sees and then thinks he can’t go up and talk to her like a normal bloke so instead he gives her presents. You know, twelve presents for the twelve days of Yule. It’s an ancient thing, not been done in years...”
“Good evening, Harry, Draco, how has your first day treated you?”
Draco had the feeling that his father was talking about him. Narcissa had tried time and time again to get him interested in them but it just wasn’t his kind of thing. Harry didn’t say anything but a glance to his side told Draco that he was pleased. Nobody said anything further until they reached the pitch and then Harry let out a long loud gasp of;
“Nino is a great teacher; she was mine and Draco’s tutor last year.” Harry informed her looking over at the Japanese teacher who seemed to be reluctantly talking with Quirrell while at the same time trying not to breathe too deeply. Harry gave her an almost sympathetic smile and then turned to the last package Hedwig had brought. It was a care package, the same as Draco’s though his included a letter from Remus on the top.
“Hey guys! Wow! I can’t believe Snape has a kid, but you look like him!” Lee said nodding before falling silent as Severus moved towards his board where his neat following handwriting appeared showing instructions for the sleeping draught potion. Harry had made the potion a few times with Severus and already knew the ingredients by heart, just as he also knew that the textbook had several errors meaning that nobody that didn’t adjust for them wouldn’t get a perfect potion.
“Dray, we’re gonna be roommates for seven years. I can’t stand them hating you for that long…I put up with the Dursley’s whispering and calling me behind my back for years, I won’t let it happen again, not to you…” Harry growled glaring at Albright who had gone a little pale and silent. Francis looked shocked and Jake was confused and half asleep in his bed. The air in the dorm crackled for a moment and then Albright cleared his throat.
“I know you care, Father, and worry, but I am an adult now…”
“Yeah, we had it this morning. I’ve got a teacher! Chuck Shurley, he’s probably going to start next week”
Was this a total let down? Again, with the self-doubt but I feel like I built it up so much…Okay…I’ll stop.
“Go have a shower, Dray, you are getting your wand today.”
“Yes, my uncle…He used to threaten me if I did anything freakish”
(See the end of the chapter for
“But! I am just a drain! A waste of space, I don’t deserve new clothes, I could...I could wear your old ones, I know I’m a little bit smaller than you...But I don’t want to waste your money!”
“...” Harry couldn’t make any sound leave his mouth as he was too choked up by Lucius’ speech and he wondered yet again what it was about him that made the Dursley’s hate him so much. The stairs they were walking down were simple wood with the walls simply painted in a beige with wooden beams running through them. In the light of the Lantern he saw graffiti etched into the plaster. Many of them went back to the 1600’s.
“You are welcome, Harry” Severus gave him a thin lipped smile and Harry flushed turning the vial in his hand noting that it looked like liquid silver as it caught the light of the sun that was coming in from the stained glass window. It was beautiful and he couldn’t stop moving it back and forth in the vial.
“Thanks, is Seamus here yet?” Harry asked looking around for the missing member of their little group. Both twins thought it was strange that they were such close friends with people younger than them, but it somehow worked out well.
“Oh my poor dear, I knew it was bad but I never imagined it was so bad”
“I’m...Okay...” Harry lied through tightly gritted teeth while the healer waved his wand making gentle adjustments to the tightness around him. The feeling seemed to move out in waves around him his legs grew tighter but his hips softened.
“Nice to meet you” Harry said again clutching tightly at Draco’s hand, so much so he had to be squeezing his fingers to almost breaking point. “This is my friend, Draco Malfoy”
“She told me things that I would not repeat to you son” Narcissa answered before opening an iron gate which creaked dramatically. Draco followed her up the overgrown path towards a door that had peeling paint and a rusty doorknocker in the shape of a cat’s head. Narcissa was just about to knock when the door opened and a tiny boy with black messy hair and large black framed ugly glasses appeared. He stared at them with wide emerald green eyes fear filling his face before Narcissa smiled and said in a happy voice. “Hello, I’m looking for Mrs Arabella Figg”
“So, I see, never did I know I had found such a childish husband for myself” Narcissa laughed the sound like a bell high but pleasing to the ear as her blue eyes shone with warmth to her husband who smiled a graceful but natural smile and moved to her pressing a kiss to her temple.
Thank you so much for the comments yesterday. I'm happy to be back.
“So?” Francis grumbled clearly not a morning person as he soon let out a loud yawn. “It’s probably a comfort thing, just leave it…”
“Oh? Don’t worry about him, he’s my pet…He does whatever I tell him, don’t you Kingsley?” She said softly and the Auror leapt to attention.
“Shut up, I was asleep, what’s up Draco?”
“You can tell your parents.”
“My dear older sister was on the side of the Dark Lord, Harry, and the acts that she committed against both muggle and wizard are not ones we care to speak of. She is in prison for those crimes, and that is where she will stay” Narcissa said firmly while Draco stepped to one side. She came over to him and held his shoulders as gently as she had been doing her fingers coming to cup his chin to tilt his face upward so she could look him in the eye. Harry fought the action he not used to looking people in the eye but Narcissa’s face was extremely gentle, her eyes kind. “But this is not about Bella, this is about you. You worry about things that you need not worry about, money is no object to us Malfoy’s Harry and it gives me pleasure to buy these things for you, as it gives me pleasure to buy them for Draco, and I hope that you that you will accept them happily. If you feel as if you should repay me, smile a little more”
“It is? It doesn’t make me a freak?”
“He was a little nervous, but I think he will be a good teacher”
“It is used to treat most poisons” Harry answered instantly determined to prove that he had been reading the potions book Severus had given him. It was something he devoured each night before bed even when Draco told him he was crazy. Severus rewarded him with another thin smile his dark eyes almost shining as he nodded;
“There is a chance you could make matters worse. I have seen a few cases of malnutrition and a course of potions is the best answer. I have not had medical training however and could not say but any potions that are needed send word, I will be happy to make them, I don’t trust the mass produced ones in Saint Mungo’s and they always make them bitter” Severus hummed wrinkling his long crooked nose like a child. “Thank-you for breakfast, Lucius, Narcissa, and thank-you for accepting my apology, Harry, but I must return to Hogwarts I have lessons. I will await your owl Harry”
“I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to make you sad” Harry whispered his fingers trembling as he stroked the folds of the book. His uncle had always told him that he asked too many questions. She half expected the old woman to send him away but she simply pulled a locket out from under her top and opened it to reveal two photos. Stiff backed and black and white. The first was of an obviously much younger Mrs Figg in a white lace gown. Her hair looked almost as black as Harry’s with a mass of curls under a veil standing next to a plump happy looking man with thin circular glasses perched on the end of is nose. The second photo was two young men in uniform one appearing to be blond while the other had his mothers hair.
“For sure”
“Hedwig St Dumount created the first pepper up potion. It is a good name, Harry, and it suits your bird greatly” Severus gave him a thin-lipped smile adding the chopped ingredients to the cauldron that was bubbling nicely. Harry relaxed and smiled his cheeks flushing a little pink. “What is the use of a bezoar?”
The elder blonde was sitting at his desk as they got to their feet and he let out an amused chuckle spelling the soot away from their clothes. Draco flushed clearly embarrassed at the ungraceful landing while Harry rubbed his bruised bottom.
If the balls failed, and they would, he would have to confess his problem to his parents, and they would have no choice but to exile him. It would be a comfortable life he supposed but not the one he was used to. He would never see his dear Mother or Father again, nor even his godfather who was also an alpha, though one without a mate. Severus wouldn’t attack first like his father, but Draco would, and the older shifter would have no choice but to defend himself and Draco would find himself beaten and broken, perhaps even dead if Severus’ shifter took over. The young alpha shuddered at the thought of having his Godfather turn violent with him.
“Mbali” Narcissa hummed lightly stroking the photo. “She is a beautiful girl; you should be extremely proud, and I imagine that one day she will be a strong witch”
“Ms Nightingale to the manor if you please, Jinx” “Yes mistress Malfoy, Jinx is doing that right away” Jinx said excitedly and Draco rolled his eyes at her though it was with a great fondness. She had been his nanny elf as a baby and she was fiercely loyal to the Malfoy’s though she was always happy to show off the manor. “Little Master Harry, youse is to be holden tightly to Master Draco! Jinx will take care of you! No need to worry!”
“But what about all those that don’t use one in Japan?”
“You should have thought about that before you snuck out of school and attacked a child” He sneered gripping them a little tighter forcing them up the long drive towards Hogwarts. He would love to know how they managed to get out of the school, perhaps he should enquire to Lupin he was a part of Potter’s company and he knew for sure that they managed to get out of the school a few times.
“Good morning” Harry sat in the chair that he had quickly decided was his own which was next to Severus. The owl moved from his shoulder to sit on the bird stand over in the far corner of the room where she tucked her head under her wing.
“It is said that Salazar Slytherin used a spell to be able to talk to snakes, he made it so that all of his family line could do it to mark them as special” Draco answered remembering his tutors History lessons. Professor Ninomiya wasn’t really a master of British wizarding history but she did know about the four founders. “It is amazing, I would have to ask mother or father if you are a direct descendant but you should be extremely proud, Harry, it is an amazing thing”
So, So long…Sorry…My delay this time was Joyous! My niece was born! Rinoa. She is the most perfectly beautiful little girl. But I was left looking after my nephews and they are draining >.< Classmate will be up soon…I hope that this was enjoyable….
“Yup, but you have to pay attention to the boring bit first” Nino winked at them both “Mahotokoro is the oldest of the eleven wizarding schools but it is also one of the smallest. Turn to page 34” Harry and Draco flipped open their books and found the correct page. The whole page was taken over by the ink painted picture of a woman.  Or at least Harry thought it was a woman, the picture was so badly faded that it was impossible to get any real features of her face. From what he could see she looked stern and had large eyebrows and a long spindly stick in her hand that could have been a wand.
“True, but he will no doubt be a perfect little gryffindor” Pansy muttered mournfully and Narcissa thankfully cut off the conversation by saying firmly;
“...There...” Draco huffed pleased continuing to angle to hit that spot over and over while Draco’s hand slipped around his body and pumped him in time with the frantic thrusting. A white haze came over his mind everything but the pleasure he was feeling slipped away until he was chanting Draco’s name over and over. “I’ve always wanted to hear you shouting my name Potter...Always thought you’d do it well”
Her cats were in lines down the main stair case and very often he almost trod on their tails. Eventually he found himself back in the kitchen. Mrs Figg gave him another Jammie Dodger before leading him back outside. Thankfully Dudley’s gang wasn’t there and he was able to make back to the Dursley’s home in good time. As always he had to go round to the back as he was not allowed through the front door. He slipped inside and already his aunt appeared to be on the war path.
“Told you!” Draco snorted with laughter, playfully shoving Harry as they made their way to Nino’s summerhouse for their first lesson. Harry growled his cheeks a deep red as he thought back to the breakfast they had just had. It wasn’t uncommon for Severus to join the family for a meal, but it was uncomfortably obvious that something had happened between the two men. They were sitting much closer than normal and they kept giving each other secret smiles when they thought nobody was looking and Harry was positive that they kept accidently brushing each other’s hands under the table.
“Harry, I hear that you have become friends with the Weasley twins. The very best of families the Weasley’s” Dumbledore mused talking over Lucius as though he was an annoying bug he could swat away with the back of his hand. To Harry’s astonishment Lucius’ mouth snapped closed and he realised that something wasn’t right. His eyes moved to Narcissa and Severus and saw that they had the same glassy expressions “Honest, hardworking, a true light family. They have another son your age, Ronald I believe, maybe you would like to write to him? Perhaps, make friends with him before school starts. It will be good for you to have friends before you attend Hogwarts. I’m sure your parents would approve…”
“Harry, we only do what any loving family should do” Narcissa whispered as though that should be obvious as she moved quickly and pulled both him and Draco into a hug. “You are a child; you deserve to be able to live free and happy. I wouldn’t have told you this but if somebody was listening and you heard it. I was afraid that you would believe it. The last thing I would want is to hurt you”
“...Mr Potter...” The man’s top lip curled revealing yellowed teeth and Harry shrank under the stare his hand about to go to his neck but Narcissa caught it this time and gave it a squeeze. Her hand was so soft, smooth, and warm that Harry found him staring at it rather like an abandoned puppy that had been shown kindness for the first time.
“But how do we fight Horcruxes? And how do we know what they are?”
The potions master let out a warm velveteen laugh his eyes crinkling in the corners making his sallow face a lot less scary and even somewhat attractive and Harry found himself smiling along more so when the door opened a few moments later and all of the Malfoys seemed a little flushed.
*-*-*
“Draco? Are you okay?”
“Very well, this is my godson Draco Malfoy, the son of Lord Malfoy and this is my son, Hadrian. Draco, Hadrian, this is Minerva McGonagall, deputy headmistress and transfiguration professor”. Severus said smoothly “You already know Lupin. He was once your student after all.”
“You’re an idiot Potter, are you a wizard or not? Since when does that matter...?” Draco scoffed as they sat together in a wine bar after having a rather pleasant lunch. Although he didn’t keep a tally Harry knew that he had been spending more time with the blonde since returning to the UK than he had Ron and Hermione. Which wasn’t all that strange given that his friends had just had their first child and he and Draco were both single with more free time. He knew that the press had noticed, and more and more reports were showing up, but Harry ignored them. He refused to feel bad about his friendship with Draco. Spending time with him had proven to be both fun and relaxing. Draco had a dry, biting personality much like Snape and his commentary of people they saw always had Harry having to fight to hold in an ugly snort of laughter. “You’re a wizard you have magic...Make it bigger on the inside than it is on the inside.”
“Are we going to get through this maze or not?” He huffed taking Harry’s hand in his and marching forward ignoring the laughter from his friends. Last year he never would have imagined that he would be friends with not one but two Weasley’s and a half-blood, then he had wished a happy birthday to Harry Potter and his life had changed direction dramatically and he was glad of it.
The room itself was filled with flowers in long garlands that draped over wooden cupboards and the fireplace. The table was set for four but there were six high backed chairs with stuffed silk cushions. Intricate carvings ran up the legs and over the backs with the same swirling crest he had seen before throughout the house. China plates were laid out with pretty paintings over them and the table was covered with silver serving dishes filled with foods that Harry had only seen in the good housekeeping magazines that his aunt Petunia brought and spread around to impress the neighbours that she dragged in for coffee on a Tuesday morning. It was the kind of food that she tried to get him to recreate when they had guests. She had always gotten angry when he hadn’t been able to achieve it.
Happy new year! I hope it's a good one for you all!
“I have always enjoyed wolves or foxes” Severus admitted, and Harry was positive that Remus let out a squeak. He knew for certain that the werewolf’s cheeks flushed just a little while he kept his eyes on the kelpie “There are some Dire wolves in the zoo, I believe…”
Fluff and then angst…Did you like the sort of nod to canon with Draco and Harry thinking of the other world? XD I had fun writing that part and the pillow fight XD also I am a huge Jason Isaacs fan so I think my Lucius is more him but younger and more Mr Darcy-ish with Narcissa being Lizzy Bennet-ish
The snake opened its mouth revealing sharp fangs its head darting forward only to be stopped by the glass. Severus hurried forward and grabbed Harry’s shoulder pulling him back as the snake laughed. “
“I know, how would you suggest I make amends?”
“So you...You are telling me...That my one true love is a pure blood who is gonna send me crazy gifts like this for 12 days? Can’t I just tell him no?
“You…You used wandless magic”
“Yo, Harry! You ready…Woah you’re looking beautiful” George and Fred said together as they came into his room. The twins had been his guard since that first day he had met them, and he found them both delightfully mischievous. They loved to play pranks, but it was always harmless fun. “Are you sure you want to marry the prince? Old Mouldy shorts is dead now! Why don’t you marry us instead?”
“Both Mr Weasley’s since your potion is finished and I have no doubt it will be acceptable why don’t you show Hadrian and Draco around instead of distracting my class any further? Please refrain from causing mischief and have my son and god son in the great hall in say an hour?” Severus suggested lightly his face not half as scary as it could have been.
“Hurt? I barely touched him!”
“Excuse me sir, but what’s curious?” Harry asked as Remus and Severus checked him over. Ollivander took the broken wand and put it down on the counter amongst the open boxes and papers.
“Excuse me, but if you’re not going in could you move out of the way?” A crisp voice asked pulling him from his thoughts with a bump and Harry turned to see a pale blonde standing behind him. He was wearing a dove grey suit and robes and his hair was cut just above his shoulders the majority of it tied back at his neck. His grey eyes widened as he recognised him and Harry held out a hand without even thinking spluttering;
“Of course, you are my son…Our son…It is natural I would want you to stand with me when I marry Remus” Severus informed the stunned boy who looked so much younger than he was in his large Christmas hat with Hedwig perched on top. Remus moved away, slightly, blinking away his tears as he grinned at Harry and then Draco
“Harry! Look!”
“Thank-you”
No words can express the feelings of gratitude that I have for you in taking in my son Harry.
“No, I think it best if I do it now, Brat” Severus answered summoning the package to his hands and slowly lifting the lid. Harry wasn’t sure if he should look or not but when he peered inside, he was surprised by the odd mixture of items. The largest being a photo in a picture frame of two children. One a boy in all black and the other a girl, sitting side by side on a swing eating ice-cream. The picture didn’t move telling Harry that it was a muggle photograph and the writing on the frame declared ‘Best Friends for Ever’. “I made your mother the frame, I had no idea she had kept it...” Severus whispered in wonder as he stroked a finger over the picture before moving onto the other items. An acorn, pinecone, and dried leaves were under the picture along with a pencil with a rubber topper shaped like a rabbit. “Your mother she was fond of the topper in the corner shop next to the store. I bought it her for her birthday we passed it back and forth between ourselves when we had exams. When we fell out...I never saw it again, I assumed she had gotten rid of it...”
“What did she tell you mother? It must have been bad...” Draco said as he and his mother made their way through the back alley. All of the houses looked the same except for one. Smoke was pouring out of the chimney and the curtains were drawn. Cats, many of them, were sitting watchfully in the garden and Draco realised that they were at least half kneazle and it was likely that they acted as spies for the squib living in the home.
“Dad, Moony? Can I come in?” Harry asked rapping his knuckles on Moony’s bedroom door. The pair knew that he was coming but he was half-hoping that they wouldn’t answer. The door opened almost immediately, and Severus was standing there in only his black trousers and shirt. It was still strange seeing his dad out of his robe even though he was seeing it often these days.
Harry watched as the greasy haired potions master lifted a short black wand, which seemed less ornate than Lucius’ or Narcissa’s, and pointed it at the blondes’ head. He muttered an incantation and a bright light shot from the end of the wand. Lucius stayed calm and relaxed. His eyes were fixed onto Severus’. Harry looked up at Narcissa who was still holding his hand her thumb moving lightly over the knuckles. She looked at him with her bright blue eyes warm as she smiled.
“But less than you did last time. You are getting better Harry, and your voice is improving…”
“I’m sorry”
“Thank you very much" Harry smiled gratefully surprised that she was giving him anything at all. As he took the plate and glass Mrs Figh picked up his book and hummed:
“You know what this is?” He asked showing her the clear liquid that flowed up and down in the small crystal bottle and the transfiguration teacher nodded her eyes narrowing.
“Boy?!” Draco gasped his eyes widening as he saw his betrothed for the first time. The first thing he saw was messy hair and then when Boy looked up, he saw bright green eyes that looked like leaves in summer sun. He was dressed in almost the same clothes as Draco but instead of green and silver he was in blood red and gold. Draco moved forward in disbelief and Boy smiled at him shyly his cheek growing pink. “You’re Harry?”
“Ugmm...” The man spluttered trying to speak as he shuffled on his knees towards his wife. His body wobbled as he moved and Draco took a step away from him taking the now shaking Harry with him. Before anyone could say anything else there was a loud crack and Narcissa appeared looking like an avenging angel. Her eyes were blazing with fire her eyes. Magic was radiating from around her like a cape. Draco had never seen his mother so angry and he had to admit he could see why his own father didn’t want to be on her bad side when she was angered.
“Father, are you not going into work today?”
Draco hadn’t been lying. The breakfast that was laid out on the table when they entered the breakfast room was unlike any of those, he had had at Malfoy manor thus far. Cinnamon rolls dripping with lightly spiced cream, maple syrup coated bacon and pumpkin spice hot chocolate. The centre piece on the table was a garland with fairies dancing around large red flowers that Harry didn’t know the names of. Candles were floating above the table with more garlands while in the corner there was a smaller Christmas tree. There were crackers set out on the table, not the cheap kind with plastic toys but large ones with their names on them and Draco was soon getting him to pull on a cracker and it exploded with a bang. A hat fell out, a copy of the one worn by the leader singer of the Wyrd sisters and Draco was soon wearing it while he gathered up the miniature toy quidditch set that had fallen out.
“Lucius, I’m sure it was all a misunderstanding”
“Harry? Are you okay? You are flushing a little” Remus asked softly from the corner of his mouth and Harry quickly explained the poems that he was hearing, and the werewolf let out a loud laugh “Dirty bugger! At least he’s having fun”
“What yer looking at?” A deeper than expected voice grumbled “You the boy? I’m Ernest, you get one year…”
“Language Draco, miss Parkinson is a young lady"
” It hissed cryptically its body pressing against the glass. The pointed tail, the most colourful part of the snake shifted pointing in the direction of the stairs. “
“We really did. Your chocolate just keeps getting better and better!” Draco hummed licking foam from his top lip as the elf ushered them towards the crackling fire as the adults finally came in.
“I overslept, how are you?”
“You should watch yourself, Malfoy, slumming with blood traitors and half-bloods” The one addressed as Grub snarled pointing to the twins and Seamus.
“I’m gonna have a farm by the end of this aren’t I?”
“Come now, Harry, there is no need for rudeness, I’m not the enemy and whatever you believe I don’t want to hurt you” He said smoothly and Draco let out a barking scoffing laugh his hand tightening around Harry’s hand. “This tension between us only serves to hurt us both”
“No, the one in France was a private collection. The tower zoo is much larger. There has been a zoo here since it was built and has the largest collection of rescued animals in the wizarding world in partnership with the Osaka zoo in Japan. I believe that the rescue and breeding programme was started by Newt Scamander a British Magi-Zoologist”
“Enjoying the chocolate, Harry dear?” She asked gently and Harry almost flew out of the chair his hand shaking so much chocolate fell to the floor around his feet. His face coloured his eyes filling with fear his body shrinking in a defensive way that was reminiscent of Dobby when he was about to start his dramatics only with Harry it looked very real. He dropped to the floor and started wiping it with the hem of his oversized t-shirt apologising loudly.
“Your majesty may I present…”
“Yes, I was inflicted with the curse when I was very young” Lupin managed to rip the brand name of the bottle while the two ten year olds started at him with open mouths while Severus stayed impassive sipping his bitter coffee while watching the scene play out in front of him.
“Wow! Woah!” Harry and Draco gasped together their eyes and mouths wide. “Do it again!”
“Dumbledork tried to keep it pretty well hidden. Refused to let it be read. When father requested Harry’s key because the ministry wanted to check if there was a will he said that he had lost Harry’s key. The Goblins were very angry, which only got worse when Dumble-dweeb said that the will had been tampered with because Lily said that Dumble-dunce wasn’t allowed anywhere near Harry” Draco told Lupin happily his eyes sparkling as he used three stupid nicknames for Dumbledore. The names made Harry giggle ever so slightly but he was watching Lupin’s face waiting for his reaction surprised when he let out a laugh and whispered;
They worked steadily for three hours, Rolf coming in shortly after they’d started to take care of the twins and provide them both with tea and more biscuits and then feeling satisfied Harry stretched out his back popping his muscles while Luna gave a happy nod.
“Of course, Harry will be staying here. This is his home. Along with Lupin. Now sit and turn your books to page 57” Lucius said swiftly sweeping into the room in the same silent way Severus did, without the same dramatic flare of bellowing robes, and Harry grinned again, the happy bubble of family and love washing over him and he silently counted the days in his mind till the weekend. Only three left.
“You expect me to know Dumbledore’s mind?”
“Excuse me? Oh…The tea, yes…Thank-you” Remus smiled secretively at the nervous splutter Severus let out and poured the tea into the fine bone china cup that had delicate paintings of blue birds around the rim.
“Yes. It is more common than not in Japan, she taught Harry and myself to cast spells wandlessly last year” Draco hummed with a shrug waving his own hand and making his books, quills, and ink float to the table. Harry smiled and copied, embarrassed when his ink very nearly dropped onto the table instead of floating gracefully down like Draco’s.
“Good morning, Harry” Severus said smoothly cutting into a mushroom “I trust you slept well?”
“Your father would call him Dumble-dick when he thought he could get away with it and Bummedonfloor”
“I’m okay...”
“My family has a cat, mum says I might be able to get an owl for Christmas but they are expensive. What about you?”
“You knew his parents, his mother more favourably than his father perhaps you can tell him about her, share your memories allow him to know her through you”
“I blew up my mothers greenhouse in a fit of accidental Magic, I didn’t mean to but one of father’s albino peacocks had been chasing me because Pant’s had tried to take one of the Peachicks. I tried to stop her but the peacock got the wrong idea. I was about five I believe. I ran to mother only to find that she wasn’t where I expected her to be. The peacock guarded the door to the greenhouse and I only wanted to shoo it away but I ended up destroying the greenhouse. The poor peacock had its tail singed in the blast and mother lost some of her award winning roses. Father was terrified that I had harmed myself, I hadn’t of course my magic protected me from the blast, but once he had calmed down he was delighted that I had shown such a powerful display of magic. Barring that incident I have only made toys fly around and once caused father to be locked in my play room. He had to go to work and I didn’t want him to leave because I wanted him to play with me”
“Lady Malfoy? Are you okay?”
Harry had spent a lot of time with the dotty old lady in his time with the Dursley’s mostly when they went on family trips and didn’t want him around and although she wasn't as bad as his aunt and uncle she wasn't his favourite person in the world either. Walking through the doors and into her house was like walking into an oven. She had an open fire burning in the grate even though it was summer and all her windows were closed covered with thick curtains. Many of her cats were sitting on the stairs watching him through the gaps in the banister. Their eyes shone in the dull lights and Harry wondered if maybe she was a witch like in the book.
Draco took Harry’s hand and then tugged him from the kitchen. It was warm outside and the scent of his mother’s flowers washed over him like the sweetest perfumes. There was a small out house against the kitchen wall and Draco stopped reaching in and grabbing three of the brooms that were inside.
“Ickle Cissy is better than I thought…” Bella laughed rocking back and forth in the chair her arms pulling against the restraints as she bit the inside of her mouth hard enough to draw blood.
“Harry, you know that you can tell us anything and we won’t be angry. But we can’t help if you don’t tell us”
“Yup! We saw a kelpie and kappa…Did you have fun?”
“Well, I wouldn’t imagine him having a girlfriend either. He’s always been…Well, Severus…” Draco said waving his free hand around as his blonde eyebrows drew together in a frown. “Does it bother you?”
“Prison?” Harry repeated the word slowly and carefully his mouth suddenly feeling very dry while Narcissa played around with one of her curls that had escaped from the hairstyle she had put it in. She seemed to be distracted and Harry thought she must be thinking about losing her head and having boils.
“I see no practicing is needed, very well! To the game!” Lucius announced with what could be described as a happy laugh and Harry saw that his face seemed to become more serious but he was still clearly having fun. They tossed the ball back and forth for what felt like an age sometimes Harry ended up in the middle and sometimes Draco but no matter what it was fun and it was disappointing when Jinx announced;
“Yes father” He said stepping into the flames and calling out the name of his office still blushing as his face turned green before he vanished. There fire filled the room with a crackling sound for a moment before Tormuld smiled rubbing his knuckles.
“Dragon, I wish you luck and your father wishes for your happiness too, inside. He is not a man to wear his emotions on his sleeve.” Narcissa gave him another little smile before talking about other safer things. Draco stayed with her for half an hour before going to find his father. Thankfully there were not as many rooms or places that he could be given that the new home wasn’t as big as the manor but it still took him a while to find him in the small central courtyard with one of his peachicks. The original Peacocks at Malfoy manor had all been eaten or killed for sport but Lucius was fond of the regal birds and now had one all white bird and one all black. The had finally had their first clutch of chicks and Lucius was proud of them. Draco stood beside his father watching his graceful fingers move over the neck of the peachick in silence until Lucius started speaking.
“Agreed, we will send him an owl in the morning. This weekend we may travel to muggle London and purchase you what you will need”
“I accept Hadrien Junius Peverell as my child” Remus said with as much confidence as Severus had taking the knife from Nino now and slicing his own palm. Three drops of blood later the potion once again slurped and bubbled becoming a golden colour in the goblet.
“Dray is my best friend” Harry said quickly not wanting Remus to think badly of him when he knew that Remus didn’t trust the Malfoys’.
“I don’t know. I can’t remember. Isn’t that strange?”
The story of the Winter Witch, Summer King, Spring Bride, and Autumn Knight is the story of Paganism my group follows with the addition of the Child of Magic beginning the origin of Witches and Wizards. It is a beautiful story really, I only gave a quick rundown of the story here. All Pagan groups have their own legends, this is my groups 😊 Sorry for the long delay I haven’t forgotten this story but I got caught up in painting again and watching Supernatural from the start again but I promise that I will upload more quickly in future.
“Family. The Malfoy’s aren’t your family…You poor deluded boy, they are manipulating you…” Dumbledore growled standing up and whipping out a knobbly wand. Before anyone could react, he started muttering a spell. A red light spread out around him and Harry felt a tingle breakout over his skin. All at once he heard Lucius and Severus shout running towards Dumbledore who was looking red in the face. “So, not a manipulation spell, it is of no matter I will find out what they have done to you and I will break it…”
“Harry, you know it’s not normal for a boy to sleep in a cupboard right? Haven’t you told anybody before?”
“What are you doing boy? Pull yourself together…”
Thank-you for all your good lucks! I made it through my test xD Now I should be able to relax a little >.<
“Yes! But knowing you anything might have happened!” Pansy insisted moving to the other side of Harry and linking her arm through his. “I was so happy that Nino invited me to come, she is so darling! But I didn’t know that she would be inviting the brothers ginger. Weasleys’ Draco? Your father is okay with it?”
“I…You are a gift, I love you and I will be giving you a name…A different name…Malfoy…You will marry me, right? Not because we are betrothed or meant to destroy Voldemort…” Draco stumbled awkwardly over his words his body still very aware of the hand over his heart.
“You are awake early this morning” Lucius hummed lightly from behind him casting a warming charm on them both, so they didn’t freeze as he stood with his early morning paper tucked under his arm. “You and Draco are normally abed for a good hour or more”
“Father is looking for the fullest sentence possible and mother will have it. If not they will remember that she is a Black and sister to Bellatrix Lestrange”
“Madam Sinistra is an extremely talented witch and will be an unbiased head mistress, I’m sure” Severus Snape hummed looking positively terrifying dressed up as Salazar Slytherin all be it with more hair. It was the most colour the twins had ever seen their professor in, and he was only wearing a muted green colour robe with silver accents. “Remember you have to be back at Hogwarts for nine. Hello, Harry, you suit the Fae Child character extremely well”
“I thought I would come and hang out with the cool kids. Everyone else is just too…Uptight?” Nino leaned into the twins whispering softly as she gave a wink. “Have you seen Harry and Draco yet?”
“I know you! You are nearly headless Nick! My brothers told me about you!” Ronald said and Draco could see the ghosts pale face become a few shades paler as he gave a disappointed huff.
“Second year! You will be all little firsties together!”
“I am three days from taking the son of a man I have thought of as my greatest enemy as my own, perhaps I can take time to truly allow myself to be happy with you. You must be patient with me, Remus, I have no good role models for men in courtship”
“Harry? Are you okay?” Draco asked reaching out to touch his shoulder recoiling when Harry let out a whimper and flinched away from him. “Sorry, how are you feeling? I am unsure what Severus made you see but I assure you he won’t get away with it”
“Annoying to be honest” Harry answered with a shrug though he had to admit he did rather like the Doves. They were like alarm clocks that morning waking him up exactly the time he had said he wanted to get up and the song they sang was beautiful much better than Ron singing off key when he showered.
“I really can’t believe he thinks of Malfoy’s as family!” A sharp voice snipped and snarled, and Harry stiffened seeing Ron walking down the hallway towards them. His face, normally pale in contrast to his hair was puffy and red and his lips were curled into a familiar, unpleasant grimace.
“A great many things that are destructive are”
“Would you fetch Harry and Draco a butter beer please?”
“Harry...Are there any partridges on that tree?” Hermione asked softly sounding very close to squeaking with excitement like she would in class when she knew an answer to a question and nobody else did.
“What your parents meant when they said that I was the reason the dark lord was after them” Severus whispered and Harry felt something niggling in his stomach at the words. He was curious, he had to admit that but if it was too much for Severus then he didn’t want to hear it now. “I was in Hogsmeade one night when I happened upon Dumbledore in one of the pubs” Severus said quickly before Harry could tell him that it could wait “He was interviewing a new divination teacher. I was so far gone with my belief in the dark lord that I listened. Most of it was absolute rubbish, I was pretty sure she couldn’t foresee snow in the artic but then, matters changed. Her voice changed and she spoke of one that would bring about the fall of the Dark Lord. I went to him, I told him what I had heard. He determined that it would be the Potters. You see Harry I am the reason you don’t have your parents...” Harry felt tears running down his face. Pain like nothing he had experience before was stabbing at his heart. His grip around the man stiffened and Severus felt it his voice low and broken as he gasped out “How they can say they forgive me...Recoil in horror Harry, hate me as I deserve...”
“Yes, Madame” Draco said with a bow taking his violin and Harry’s hand before pulling him out of the room. They made their way to Remus’ rooms where they would be studying history of British magic with the werewolf. Severus had recommended it as the teacher of History of magic was a dull ghost, but Severus considered the subject to be important if only because it would help them understand more about where their traditions and customs came from. Harry was enjoying it, there was something calming about the way his father taught and it was always nice to spend the two hours with him after his sessions. He suspected that that was why they were arranged that way.
“I’m sorry”
“You make it sound as though I never visit, Mother.”
“And where have you been? My Duddykins has been looking for you all afternoon! He and his little friends wanted to play a game with you!” She raged and Harry caught sight of his cousin smirking through the doorway to the living room. They all knew what kind of game Dudley wanted to play with him, it was called Harry hunting and he almost always ended up with bruises all over his body or broken glasses. His glasses had been broken that many times that Harry was sure they were only held together by magic these days. He looked away from Dudley looking down at the floor.
His need for a wash losing out to his need to find the source of the scent Draco followed it sighing with happiness as it got stronger until eventually, he was presented by a boy-Omega, not much younger than he, sitting on a tree stump with a book in hand. His lips were moving as his finger dragged over the page carefully and Draco found himself smiling at the sight. The boys’ face was filthy with soot but even so Draco could see that he had a face as sweet as his scent. The omega’s nose twitched once and then twice, and Draco thought for sure that he had been found out spying but then the omega let out the cutest sneeze before continuing to read.
“Silence! You know nothing of the boy you have just met. Listen well for I shall tell you this only once and you may learn something” He spat stopping and releasing them so suddenly they jerked forward and almost fell on their faces. “That boy you have just upset is my godson” He said knowing that although it wasn’t official he had the same level of responsibility to Harry that he had to Draco. Fred and George stared at each other with wide eyes their faces paling even more. “The upbringing he has had would be enough to even take the shade out of your hair. You can not assume that you can go through the world believing that everyone in it has had the same happy upbringing you have had. You are a pair of bumbling apes but your hearts, for the most part, are in the right place and I believe that you would never do anything intentionally that would cause serious harm or injury but injury is not always of a physical kind”
“It is possible that Minerva checked in on you, however she would have done a better job of blending in.” Remus told him his mouth thinning with anger at the mention of his cupboard and Harry felt bad for saying it. The werewolf already looked so tired that he hated adding to his stress. Remus gave him a smile his amber eyes flashing just a little showing how close his wolf was to the service. “Come on, Harry, eat your dinner” While Harry had been thinking food had appeared on the table like it did at the Malfoy’s home. “Would you care for some potatoes?”
“Oi! Wait up!” Seamus shouted appearing at the door with a man Harry had only met once before following pushing a trolley with his things on it. “Hey, Draco, Harry, Pans”
A voice that wasn’t his own was in his head telling him that Dumbledore was right. He did need other friends. Draco wasn’t a very good friend after all. Draco is the best friend! Harry’s voice snarled back at the intruder. You need other friends, being here with this wealth isn’t good for you Harry. You need to be humbled, a humble hero…Broken…No! Harry roared inside his head drowning out the voice that was telling him to leave Draco and the Malfoy’s that they only wanted to hurt him. Whatever was in his head jerked back in surprise at the force of his mental shout.
“I’m fine, it just feels a little strange” Harry admitted breathlessly trying to walk but it was too much. Draco, in a fit of accidental magic summoned a chair and had him sit down. “Draco...”
“I believe that we should separate. Severus, Remus, and Harry and myself, Narcissa, and Draco. Spend an hour or two and then meet up at the Chimera enclosure, I’m sure Ninomiya would enjoy some time with her friend” Lucius said softly and although Harry didn’t want to separate from Draco he did want to spend some time with Remus and Severus. He looked at Draco who smiled and nodded squeezing his hand.
“Well yer all class, Pants.”
“Please, just call me Nino, everyone else does” Nino smiled shaking his hand again before bowing a little more politely at Lucius. “Lord Malfoy, thank-you for hiring me to teach Draco again this year”
“You shall be okay, Harry dear, we will look after you”  She said lightly laying her arm around his shoulders and drawing him into her body. The action seemed to be so natural on her part that Harry allowed himself to be held noting that the woman’s skin was as perfumed as the flowers in her garden only it was a warmer scent having been on her skin.
“I like to read, Harry, the antler of a Peryton is used in some advanced potions and as they fall off each year naturally it makes them very interesting to potion makers” Severus answered looking a touch embarrassed as he pulled his gaze away from the Peryton. “Come there is still much to see. I believe Remus is wanting to see the Kelpie next”
“My father”
I really hope you like Pansy though she, like everyone else, is totally OOC >.<
“I wasss trying to ssleep” The grass snake hissed in displeasure shooting him angry looks as it curled its way up his arm. The yellow eyes unnerved him for just a moment and then he apologised having completely forgotten about the snake he had brought with him.
“Why thank-you, Draco! If you don’t apologise, I will give you a reason to have a real false leg!” Pansy huffed out with a playful pout their friendship built on years of playful ribbing back and forth. “You have no idea what I am do you?”
“Bleedin Ell” Seamus whistled as he stepped into the main reception hall followed closely by his mother Bridget. Harry, Draco, Pansy and the twins were awaiting his arrival and Harry gave an extremely nervous smile as Bridget stared at him. It had been a week since the Hummingbirds had played the legion and that their lives had shifted around, and it had been four days since Seamus had written and asked if he could come and play. The Malfoy’s had agreed and had suggested the twins and Pansy join and make a day of it. Harry knew that the Malfoy’s and his parents were trying to make things as calm as possible, but he also knew about the people constantly coming in and out in the dead of night. How Sho and Remus spent almost all waking hours in the library pouring over the books and how Nino had shifted in to teaching them defensive spells and Severus had stepped up teaching him how to close his mind from outside attacks. “Yer sure this is yer ‘ome and not a bleeding museum?”
“Shame not everyone is blown over by your mere presence, Potter” A voice grumbled from behind their backs and Harry didn’t even have to turn around to know that it was Ron. The boy had been outcast from Slytherin house during lesson, even getting points for them had done little to stop the scowls he was getting but Ron didn’t seem to care. The Slytherin emblem on his robes had been picked at until it was frayed, how that had happened in only a night Harry couldn’t understand, and his tie looked scorched. “Guess even your name can’t make people like you Malfoy.”
So, short Sev, Minnie chapter….I hope you liked it! There was no way Minerva wasn’t going to be on their side. I frigging love her! Ahem…
“Yes, causing me many headaches trying to find flavours that don’t ruin the potions and make them useless. However it is a small price to pay to see you recovering, brat, would anyone care for another drink? You can have a fruit juice and nothing more” Severus rose from his seat and grabbed his empty coffee cup. Remus agreed asking for a coffee himself this time while Draco asked for a fruit juice as well refusing to have another butterbeer if Harry couldn’t. It was one of the many ways Draco showed him how much he cared following the same diet plan as him and making sure that he was there at all of his healers appointments to make sure he knew what was needed.
“Yes, it has been a long time since I have seen my sister and I never thought that I would have to see her again” Narcissa nodded running her tongue over her lips. “I am ready”
“Yes, you bloody prat, I love you and I will happily have a child with you, and you can even give them a weird astrological name...Ugh...” Harry’s rant was cut off by Draco jumping him his mouth pressing hotly against his. It took him a moment to come to his senses but when he did Draco was pulling away from him and jumping off the bed. He vanished from the bedroom and then Harry heard footsteps on the stairs leading to their small attic where they kept their owls. A few minutes later the blonde was back holding up a small present wrapped in silver and green paper.
“In the bathroom” Harry answered flushing as she placed a kiss to the top of his head.
“Yeah, your pops sure knows more about chocolate than I ever thought was possible.”
“You must learn to only apologise for things that are your fault. This is not your fault and you should not be down-hearted, many fully grown wizards cannot perform wandless magic” Lucius said and before he could stop himself Harry let out a snort saying in a depressed voice
“Thank-you” Harry said shyly again and Draco cleared his throat determined to change the subject and get Harry to enjoy himself again.
“I am, what am I meant to say? We will be dead, shuffled off the mortal plane, it’s not gonna bother us...”
“I’m not a witch, I’m a squib, my parents were magical but I didn’t inherit it. Now where did you get that book from?”
“We are going for lunch! You will all join us to celebrate our victory?” CC asked and Harry looked at his tutor who gave a nod and a smile looking to the baffled looking Auror who had been roped into taking the photos.
“Sorry, just can’t sleep, I didn’t mean to wake you”
“You played great” Fred and George said happily, and Conner looked at them with a small blink his eyebrow lifting as he asked.
“Indeed! We are all happy! You will allow me to arrange it? Have you thought of Dates?”
“What’s the ritual?”
“Thanks, Har’. Same with you…And Draco…”
Although not directly about the game the book did mention the schools Quidditch teams and mentioned all of the famous players and what houses they had been in. The book had told him that the toy broom he had gotten was a model racing broom used by the England Quidditch team and again it spoke as though brooms could really fly. Eventually though he knew that some, or all, of what the book was saying had to be real because the pictures were moving, some of them even waved at him and one particular looking old man gave him a huge thumbs up whenever he tried to read a difficult word and got it right.
There was also the odd things that happened around him. The way he had turned his teacher’s wig a different colour and how he had found himself on the roof of the school when being chased by Dudley and his gang. If his parents were magic though how would they have died in a car crash? It was one of the things Vernon delighted in telling him. His parents had been drunk and had died in a car crash.
“I threw his letter into the fire, as I am sure he did the majority of mine when I tried to tell him how Harry had been suffering. Shall I go in and see where they are?”
“Sometimes, last one to try was Dumbledore” Harry looked calm as he spoke but Draco could see that his shoulders had grown tense and his fingers were itching to claw at their normal spot on the back of his neck. Seamus didn’t know any of the tells however and he asked in a half whisper
“Where’s Rolf?”
“Yes, we decorate a log with evergreens and charm it before laying it on the fire. It will have to be kept burning until the new year when it will be doused by a dark-haired man” Draco shrugged, and Harry tried to remember the Dursley’s or any muggles doing anything like that.
“When I first came to the wizarding world, I couldn’t take it all in either, Harry” Severus chuckled his hand on his shoulder guiding him forwards so he wouldn’t trip as he stared about. As Remus had said it was nothing like the zoo he had seen in France. Everywhere he looked there was something new to see only a few feet away there seemed to be a mountain range surrounded by an almost invisible wall that shimmered in the light. “My mother was a witch, but my father was muggle. We lived on a tiny street with the houses so close together you could hear your neighbour six doors away sneeze on the dust from her carpet. Father didn’t care for magic and we had no many to spare for luxuries, so I never came to places like this until I was in Hogwarts. Even though my mother had told me stories, they never did it justice”
“It’s okay! It was his own fault he was doing a handstand and Masaki is completely fine now and back to terrorising the wildlife of Asia” Nino smirked just a little but Harry had a feeling that she was in part telling the truth. “He is a magizoologist and I think part time clown and full time idiot. But I remember how much pain he was in, you are a brave kid, Harry” She reached out and ruffled his hair causing the curls to stick up at odd angles.
“My heartiest of congratulations, Severus, and you Remus” Flitwick said brightly after they had all toasted the adoption with a glass of champagne. Even Harry and Draco had been allowed a sip, but Harry hadn’t really liked it and he was sure that Draco was pretending.
“I…I would like…Ice cream…Please…” Harry nodded seeing the concerned and confused expression that was coming over both their faces. “Just…Um…I called you…Dad…I’m sorry, if that’s weird…”
“The aurors? I admit I am surprised they are taking that route”
“I went to get drinks and when I turned around you were gone. Hey boys” Sho smiled handing over the goblet of fruit punch. The twins, still grateful that they had not only been able to go to a game but hang out with the team, grinned at the reporter bobbing their heads in greeting.
“God father” Draco responded softly though his eyes were harsh and his face stiff. The boy was just as his father had been and he would be no less intimidating when he was the same age as his father was now. Knowing full well had earned the anger of the Malfoy’s he turned his attention to the boy he had hurt the day before. It hadn’t been a physical hurt but he knew better than most that not all hurt was the physical kind. He was not a man known for his soft nature though he did care for those that were put into his house.
“I know” Remus smirked stretching out his back before looking around in some confusion “Where are the boys?”
“Horcruxes? Plural?” Severus whispered weakly sinking into the love seat beside Remus who was just as shellshocked by what Narcissa and Kingsley had revealed. He didn’t want to believe it, making one Horcrux was horrifying but more than one? It was sickening.
“Yes, where are Aunt Cissi and Uncle Luci?” He asked knowing that Remus still looked beyond surprised and repeated ‘Luci’ under his breath every time he said it.
“You were always a show off” Remus muttered fondly a tear rolling down his cheek.
“Not an overly unpleasant day, I thought” Draco said throwing himself down and staring up at the blue tapestry that hung from deep wooden posts. Harry gave a hum of agreement and then moved over to the window where two desks, with their names on, were situated. He stroked the carving and then reached for the book Chuck had sent him. He read through the older man’s notes first before turning a page and folding the paper back with a finger down the seam before taking his Guitar from its case. He felt a tremble of excitement as he touched the shiny wood. He loved his guitar even if it wasn’t the most expensive. It was acoustic made of red wood with shiny brass fixtures. He strummed a few chords and then gasped in horror as something slithered out from behind the strings.
“I’m Martha Rose! Boys! You know nothing! She was my great-grandmother! She started the flapper movement!”
“I see, I shouldn’t have thought changing the title would make much of a difference. It is all about intent, however you were correct not to risk it. Now, I should be returning to Hogwarts, Harry my boy…I have a gift for you” Flitwick said brightly reaching into the pocket of his robe and pulling out a gift around the same size of a matchbox. Once it was in his palm however it grew to the size of a large book wrapped in purple paper with dark blue bow. “For allowing me to witness this adoption. It is nothing much, merely a trifle, it is a history of the lady of my house, Rowena Ravenclaw. Your family, including your new father, is sure you have a high chance of being in my house”
“I know, you do, I feel very safe here” As Harry spoke the door between his room and Draco’s opened and Draco came in in his PJ’s with Narcissa following. The pair had been out for the evening at a gala they had forgotten until the last minute. Draco had stubbornly refused to go, never quite reaching the stomping his feet stage Dudley would often use, but it had been no good. “Welcome back! Did you have fun?”
“Good…”
“You are here now”
“I am still allowed a little fun, my heart”
“If it will do any good you are free to do as you please”
“Yes, you dithering fool! That’s exactly what I’m saying! I would swear to it! I have letters! The ones he sent back to me” Mrs Figg reached into her large carpet bag and pulled out dozens of letters all written in an emerald green ink by the same spidery hand.
“Ah, okay, are you sure you wouldn’t be happier alone?” Harry whispered pulling the box and letter from his pocket where they had been sitting all day. Severus tapped them with his wand and slowly they resized themselves taking up most of the space on the table. The potions master slowly dragged his tongue against his lips as he shook his head his hand reaching out nervously for the letter.
“I still have it!” Harry announced patting the inside of his jumper where a bulge stuck out. “But…I think we are gonna have to split up. As a distraction…You go one way with the flag, and I go the other. They think I have it after all”
“I’m sorry”
“How can you be so forgiving Harry?”
“Was Emperor Hashimoto a wizard?” Harry wondered out loud looking at the woman in the picture. The painting really wasn’t very helpful in giving an impression of the woman but the more he looked at her the more he could pick out features of her face. Like her eyes and her mouth.
“...Are my eyes freaky?”
“Yes, but we are not in Japan nor are we Japanese. It is a cultural difference between us. We are European, our ancestors have always used a wand to manifest their magic, I suppose one could say that we have grown lazy in harnessing our magic without the aid of a wand. You should never be upset for it, Harry” The older man said, and Harry almost felt better, but then he remembered that Draco had managed it easily. He wasn’t jealous of his friend, but it did make him think that it was just another thing that was wrong with him. Like he was a freak in the wizarding world the same as he was in the Muggle.
“Harry Potter-Snape…Pleased to meet you…”
“I believe that it is a brownie, Harry” Remus said in wonder peering into the box at the grumpy creature that was still looking thoroughly pissed off. “Brownie’s are sort of like House Elves, like cousins? Only they live in secret in the home and in exchange for gifts of milk and honey they will do chores. Fix shoes, and such…”
“And it is clear they are, even from what little I saw of you together I could see he adores you, and Remus, he has always looked at you as though you hung the moon.”
So! This chapter went in a completely different direction to what I thought it would. I wasn’t expecting Ginny and Victor but that was the way it flowed! I hope you enjoyed!
“I see, it’s nice, not may see father as I see him. Pants is a little afraid of him truth be told and the other heirs all treat him with respect but are just as afraid. Oh well, its good...Are you done I guess uncle Severus is here with your potions”
“I remember flashes of my mum. She was singing...And telling me stories...But I don’t know if they are memories or dreams” Harry said softly knowing that it was silly to even think of them as memories. “They must be dreams. I was only a baby when they died I couldn’t remember them”
“Yes, well, I can call a spade a spade and he will always be an idiot. He is however my father and, although I know you might not believe it, he was a good father to me…” Draco hummed softly, and Harry murmured in agreement. The understanding in his eyes was unfathomable and Draco wanted to lose himself in them.
“To the beach. I saw a postcard with a beach on it once, with Donkeys and a pier that stretched out into the water” Harry whispered his cheek gaining the two adorable spots of pink at his humble wish and Narcissa almost took the boys to the beach right then and there but instead she made a note of it knowing that more serious things needed to be done.
“Father accepts that the twins cannot be blamed for the actions of their ancestors”
“Yeah, I’m continuing my guitar lessons on Saturdays” Harry answered turning his attention to the letter he had been given. It was written in neat copperplate handwriting and he immediately recognised it as being from Gringotts. It wasn’t his monthly statement however as that came at the end of the month, so he tore it open carefully to find a typed letter inside.
“You are helping, you silly boy, you think I did not see it today? You held his hand, shielded him from the crowds, even talking to him helps him...” She declared honestly knowing her son wouldn’t fully believe her, not yet. “The road of recovery Harry is on is a long one Dragon, but he is not on it alone. He has you and I believe he could ask for no better companion, but remember Dragon, you are a child too and if you need support I am here for you, now and always”
“How do I look?” Harry asked Moony and Severus nervously playing around with the wedding suit. It was both his birthday and the day he was to marry Draco. His stomach was fluttering with nerves, but he knew that they would vanish when he was finally in front of Draco. Moony lifted his head from his paws his amber eyes giving him a slow look over before he huffed out a breath his tongue lolling out of the corner of his mouth. The residents of Hogwarts had been surprised when their new consort came with a wolf and a crow but they had become a common enough sight in the palace now and though most people didn’t like getting too close they would watch fondly when Lord Harry was barefoot in the garden throwing a stick for the lumbering wolf while a disgruntled crow sat nearby pretending not to be interested. Harry shook his head and then brushed out his hair knowing nothing he could do would get it to lay flat on his head.
I actually don’t mind Ron in canon, he isn’t my favourite but I don’t hate him, I always wanted more Seamus…However I could easily imagine Ron becoming spiteful and jealous if Harry had never been his friend so that’s how we end up here!
“Nino gave us some, but nothing else yet.” Harry answered genuinely looking forward to the homework Nino had set. She had given all the groups different dark creatures to study. Sigma had been given Kelpies and Harry was looking forward to studying them.

“Then you would do better to speak with my wife, I was born and brought up in England, Harry, I attended Hogwarts and was taught European magic. My wife is Nigerian and brought up there until she moved here. I will ask her for you if you like!” The large man promised smacking him once more on the shoulder and Harry nodded happily. Growing up believing that Magic was the stuff of fairytales and fantasy made him hungry to learn as much as he could from as many different places as he could. He had already asked Tormuld if he could learn more about the Goblins and had spoken to Jinx about house elves. Draco had teased him about being a nerd, but Severus and Remus encouraged his learning.
“He seems nice” Harry put out and Nino nodded again grinning as they caught up with Masaki who had stopped outside a door that led to another enclosure.
“Harry, dear? Is there something you forgot?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Perks of dating a sports reporter, kid” Nino laughed and Harry marvelled at how different this woman was to anybody he had ever met. She was not the kind of person the Dursley’s would have liked, in fact she was the kind of person they would cross the street to avoid, she was foreign for a start, and she was down to earth in all the best ways.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The Goblins are a lot smarter than you are, James! Look we have to get this done; Harry will wake up at any minute”
I hope this part is okay xD
“I did, very much, as soon as I knew that the prince I was meant to marry was you I stopped fighting it and tried to learn as much as possible so I won’t embarrass you as your consort” Draco gave a smile but shook his head. He didn’t need him to be anything but his Boy from the forest. He had fallen in love with him covered in dirt and carrying loads of washing.
“If I am allowed to stay” Harry muttered. He was not a boy that had ever allowed himself to hope, when he was young he had wished and wished that some mysterious family member would turn up and take him but that wish had been beaten out of him. He wanted to stay here with Draco, Narcissa and Lucius but he knew better than to hope for it. He didn’t trust the toad faced woman or Dumbledore, the man wanted him back with his aunt and uncle.
“We thought you were too busy with your new friend. Potter? The paper would have us believe that you and he are forever in company with one another.” Lucius huffed his tone flat not giving away anything about how he felt. The paper was moved aside so the former head of the Malfoy line could fix him with an icy grey stare. Draco ignored it the best he could. He had learned that his father was flawed in many ways, however Lucius was still his father and wanted him to think well of him.
I hope you can forgive me!
“You may go first, Minerva.”
“Masters Harrys…You haven to helps us!” Dobby cried sobbing onto his bare feet “Theys are taken us aways!”
“Uncle Luci, he is using legilimency” Harry whispered to the older blonde. Lucius’ hand tightened on his shoulder and he turned to stare at Dumbledore with his back straight and his expression unreadable.
“Master Dumbly-dore! Youse will helps Dobby? Youse is as kind as they says!” Dobby squeaked his eyes shining with adoration and Dumbledore nodded taking out his wand.
“Harry? Are you okay? You have been quiet tonight” Draco whispered slipping into bed beside him and Harry turned onto his side to look at his friend. Draco looked even more pale in the moonlight while his eyes were warm with concern. He was dressed in his light grey pyjamas and his hair was unnaturally straight from brushing it with his magical hairbrush. Harry gave him a very small smile that he knew didn’t reach his eyes before humming;
“Perhaps you should speak to Pants, she has suggested introducing them to Aunt Bella”
Sorry for the shorter chapter, I was at uni all day yesterday
“They might do, at the moment though Dumbledore is doing everything he can to convince people that they have kidnapped the boy and are manipulating him”
“And you’re not equally as excited?”

“Harry, are you sure?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Lucius saw him off at about 7:20 this morning and told him to make an appointment at a reasonable hour” Narcissa answered her lips twitching into a smile and Harry realised that meant that they had let him stay out in the rain for twenty minutes. Even with spells that had to be annoying and uncomfortable. “Now, I expect you both downstairs in the breakfast room in fifteen minutes”
“She has been informed and accepted the position”
“The books here are for the use of Ravenclaw students only. They are not to be taken outside of our dorm; they contain many of Lady Ravenclaw’s private volumes.” The male Prefect standing beside Penelope told them sounding stuffy as he did so. His chest puffed up proudly as though he himself owned the books and they didn’t belong to the whole house. Harry was impressed though and he was itching to read some of the books which seemed to be even older than the ones in the manor library.
“No, another time I was hiding in Mrs’ Figgs bush from Dudley and another little adder was in there, I just started talking and it seemed to nod in agreement. I said that it would be fun if Petunia could see it cause she hated them. The next day Petunia screamed cause the snake had gotten into the bedroom” Harry explained and although he was amused Draco gave a hum and then looked at the snake in the enclosure. It was looking at them its beady eyes unblinking as its black tongue poked out of its mouth flicking up into the air. “She thinks you smell nice”
“Of course not, but I suppose you have some questions, I will tell you what I can. I’ve never been to Hogwarts though”
“Yes, sir, still have it to this day.” Remus answered tapping his wand that was carefully stored in his wand pocket on his robe.
“Yes, Mistress Malfoy”
“To give you a name. You name every creature you have but you never name yourself. Why is that?”
Severus woke to the odd feeling of having another body next to his. He hadn’t been a virgin, however the concept of having a partner staying with him through the night was new and he stalled in the sheets unsure for a moment as to how to react. Remus was sleeping with his head on his arm his fingers pressed against the faded dark mark on his forearm. He looked peaceful with his light eyelashes splayed over his cheeks night-time stubble dusting his chin and top lip. Severus pushed his long bangs from his face with his free hand and then settled into the bed forcing himself to relax and just enjoy the moment. It appeared to be the right idea as soon he felt Remus’ lips lightly press to his arm as he woke slowly. A breathy whine pulled its way lazily out of his mouth as his limbs woke slowly shifting until their legs were tangled under the covers.
“I am not one to share my memories with others, but a simple apology would not be adequate very well. You do surprise me though, this protective nature you have found for Harry”
I have to go, Harry is waking, I have left things for you, some things that you left with me, and some things that a godfather should have of his godson because no matter what you are the god father of my son, Sevy. Live your life to the fullest and be happy. Your sister Lily-Rose Evans-Potter” The letter jerked for a moment and Harry thought it was going to change back into a letter again but then his father’s voice came out through the lips. It sounded rushed and whispering;
He had overslept once again it seemed, dreaming of black dogs and a giant man with a bushy beard, and the Dursley’s would punish him if they knew. Thankfully, his earliest chore was to fetch water from the well in the centre of the village and he could always use the excuse that the line was busy, as it often was. He grabbed the iron bucket from the side of the house and then ran down the lane as quickly as his bare feet could carry him. It was long since the feel of the stones hurt him but sometimes his heel would be caught by prickles from the blackberry trees that lined the road, today was such a day and he let out a cry as a large, sharp pain stabbed into the bottom of his foot. He hobbled for a moment looking for something that he may lean on to pull out the prickle but instead a strong hand grabbed his arm. For one wild moment he thought it might be his uncle or one of the twins but then his senses caught the warm scent of spice, honey, and warm milk.
“Mbali” Kingsley answered and Narcissa gave a smile looking up at the imposing man who seemed a little less imposing when speaking of his daughter.
“How romantic, I never would have thought you had it in you!”
“Kingsley helped. He took a potion that would make him seem to be under a compulsion spell and I…I said things…I told her that Harry was with us and that we had tricked him to believing that we were friends. I am so sorry Harry. It was a lie and I hated saying such things, but I assure you it was needed…”
“How dare you both!” Severus snapped dragging the errant Weasley twins through the village of Hogsmeade anger burning like a hot flame in his stomach. Everything had been going so well, Harry had been enjoying himself and there had been a flicker of something with Lupin, he was sure of it, the way the other man had looked when he had darted into Zonkos was something that he would perhaps allow himself to remember fondly later. Then everything had come crashing down around his ears, the terror he had seen in his Harry’s face and the anger in Draco’s. His godson had been like a fierce lion staring down both boys and Severus was sure Lucius would be proud but it shouldn’t  have happened “300 points from both of you”
“Will you return later?” Remus asked somewhat shyly as he held him back from the floo sometime later. He was returning the twins to the school and had intended to do some marking but the look in the wolf’s face had him giving a nod his fingers brushing against the back of his hand.
He also spent a lot of time telling him about his parents and the high jinx they had gotten themselves into. How James had fallen for Lily in their first week of Hogwarts, but the fiery red-haired girl had hated his antics. It was nice to have people talk about them, but he also liked to hear about Severus as a student and Remus.
“Lucius, forgive me, I had to see for myself”
“Correct, and what would happen if you added mint instead of Nutmeg?”
I hope you enjoy
“can...can Jinx be there too?”
“We will see you at Yule, Harry, enjoy yourself and take care of each other” She said as Harry breathed in her perfume. She gave him another kiss and then handed him off to Lucius who smiled and gave him a one armed hug.
“Oh, Harry! Don’t worry about that! Mother...”
“Yes, Mr Shurley’s mother Loretta-Amara Shurley is from a long line of seers. It was what helped the family on the stock market. It was well known that Carver Edlund’s son inherited the gift. For a man like Mr Shurley I can easily imagine that he was disturbed by such visions”
“I have asked you not to use that nickname” He said knowing there was no heat in his words as he crossed the room to his sparse drinks cabinet taking out two of his finest glasses, gifts from Lucius one Yule, and set about pouring them both a half measure making sure it wouldn’t be enough to mess with the potion Remus needed to take later.
“I go wherever you go and Pants will no doubt join us even if she is more Slytherin than Salazar himself” Draco muttered his arms wrapping around him snuggling him tightly as Harry snorted in his sleep his head pressed against the thin chest of his friend. It might be strange to some that even after so many months together they still shared a bed, but Harry couldn’t imagine not having Draco with him and it seemed that Draco felt the same.
“Your magic chose me Harry! I am not going to let it regret that! I will take care of you!”
“Youse letter is not from Miss Parkinson, master Draco, sirs"
“Harry dear, are you quite well? Do you feel warm?” Narcissa asked moving in her chair to put a gentle hand on his forehead her ruby lips pursed in worry. “We can postpone our trip to Paris if you are feeling unwell”
“Um, yeah, that would be great”
“Because all children find thinking about their parents having intimate relations strange and even disturbing regardless of gender” Severus sighed wincing just a little “I am horrified at the thought of my parents in such an intimate position”
“Good morning” The replied together bobbing their heads the way they had been taught. Nino sat on the desk tapping her forefinger against the large mole on her chin her head cocking ever so gently to one side.
“Catch it Harry!” Draco shouted moving his broom before throwing the ball and Harry moved with ease swooping and grabbing it away from Lucius before immediately throwing it back.
If anyone had told him a little over a year ago that he would have a photo of James Potter in his rooms, much less be honoured to have it, he would have shipped them off to Mungos without even the time it would take to sneer and yet there it was and he would often hold a glass of whiskey to the photo and thank the once bane of his existence whole heartedly. He nodded to the photo now, he knew that it wasn’t the same as a portrait, but he often felt the two in the photo responded and were perhaps pleased.
“I am aware of that Draco and they have agreed to take Harry into protective custody until more evidence is gathered” Lucius said turning from the window to look at them and Hestia seemed to get the feeling that as an Auror she was included in what had upset the lord. Draco on the other hand grew hopeful asking;
The outfit wasn’t a robe or a dress but something in between and when he investigated the mirror, he found that he liked it very much. A wand was in the box and he smiled as he picked it up laughing with delight when it shot sparks from the tip.
“Mr Dumbledore, please stay silent or I shall have the guards remove you, the Goblins of Gringotts are not simple fools that will standby as you act as though the sun only raises and sets because of your bidding” Tormuld snapped clicking his long gnarled fingers together and binding Dumbledore to the chair that he had transfigured. “We are aware of the events of the last war of wizards, and we   know more of the deeds than many would like to be known, but we also remember the war that came before and what happened then...” Narcissa felt her curiosity increase as the Goblin seemed to smirk at Dumbledore who had stopped his frantic pulling at the invisible ropes about him. She knew only some of what had happened during the wizarding war with Grindlewald, her parents had actually stood against him seeing the insanity in his actions, but whatever it was the Goblins had seemed juicy as Dumbledore had paled until he was almost the same shade as his beard. “But we do not care to remember the past mistakes of our clients. You have a right to call for an independent to test this spell. Who would you have me call?”
“That’s a dung bomb”
“But yer don’t even like me?”
“I don’t want to get you into trouble, sir”
“Okay”
The great hall was exactly like his Dad had described with the ceiling showing the sky outside. It was not a particularly interesting sight today as there was only dark grey clouds swirling around, but the thousands of twinkling candles was a sight and Harry was glad that he knew enough about magic that he didn’t wonder why droplets of wax weren’t raining down on them. A few students were already sitting at the four long tables and teachers were sat at the head table including Professor Flitwick who was talking happily to a beautiful black-haired woman with pale skin. Thankfully, Severus and Remus were already there, though Harry clung to Draco’s hand as he dragged him to the top table uncomfortably aware that the students that were there were whispering in confusion.
He truly hadn’t expected to find himself in a quiet gay bar one Friday night. He hadn’t intended his feet to lead him there, he had just wanted a drink and that had been the only bar open. He had sat at the bar and ordered his drink before realising but as the evening had worn on and he had relaxed a great deal with the help of the alcohol he had realised quite slowly that perhaps he wasn’t as straight as he had thought.
“Okay, it’s okay, Harry. I will just need to rethink, but I knew a guy like you when I was at school. Though his magic would only appear when he was happy. If he had the smallest upset, he couldn’t do magic…”
“Hey Dray, sorry if this is early, I was up at Luna and Rolf’s first thing and I thought I remembered you saying you woke early to do your thing with wands. I wanted to let you know that I will pick you up for the theatre at 6.30 it’s the muggle one in London, Le nozze di Figaro…” “An Opera? How…Surprising…” Draco whispered aloud to the empty room laughing as he read Harry’s next line. “Yes, I know, surprising right? Me and opera? I can just picture your face. But honestly, I got to really like them, who would have thought it? So, yeah, another reason I’m writing you so early is because I am meeting Ginny this afternoon, I haven’t seen her since the breakup so I’m gonna meet her near Mungo’s so if she hexes me, I will get treated straight away, thought I should tell you in case it ends up on the front of the Prophet or something and you get the wrong idea. Okay! My godchildren are awake, so I must be Hippogriff for a while. Speak to you latter, H.P”
“I really am sorry, I didn’t…Know…Until that night I mean. I didn’t even really know it was an option to be gay. Then I found myself in that bar and it all just…Made sense.” He shrugged helplessly the conversation being completely different to every scenario he had gone over in his head. Although he wasn’t arrogant enough to believe she would still be in love with him he had been worried that she would still be angry with him. Instead, Ginny reached out across the table and gave his hand a squeeze.
“Severus Snape’s private office, Hogwarts” Severus called out in a deep and calm voice and then threw the powder down around them. There was a woosh and Harry closed his eyes as they were pulled through the fireplace. He was glad of Severus’ protective arm around him, but it did little to ease the sickly feeling that collected in his stomach and he was glad when he was thrown out the other side. Severus kept him standing and moved him away from the fireplace while stroking his back gently. “Still not a fan of floo travel Harry?”
“Yes, indeed, you look just like him. He was a good student, very polite when I saw him in the halls. Now, aren’t you a little young for Hogwarts? I don’t recall seeing you at the sorting. What house are you in?”
Thank you for all sticking with me throughout this time. There are days when I feel like not bothering with anything but the idea of you waiting for the next chapter gives me the boost I need ❤️❤️
“Remember boys the promises made to the Yule log are to be kept” Lucius hummed “So I resolve to be the best father and uncle I can be, as well as the best husband”
“Good. Now go and enjoy your first lesson with Professor Ninomiya, I will floo the healer” She gently pushed them to the door and Draco took a hold of his hand saying primly;
Standing in Mrs Figg’s cluttered kitchen Harry stared at the boy who had been writing to him and giving him gifts. He was nothing like he had pictured in his mind while reading the letters and Harry felt uncomfortably nervous feeling almost as though he was being stared at by one of Dudley’s friends though none of Dudley’s gang were as beautiful as the boy in front of him. Draco looked like one of the angels from Aunt Petunia’s Christmas decorations with hair so blonde it was almost white. His eyebrows were also blonde while his eyes were a steel grey. He was dressed in clothes that seemed to be more expensive than anything the Dursley’s owned and Harry pulled at his over sized t-shirt feeling almost like he was about to be called a tramp.
“Greenfield?”
“Then I will have achieved more than my grandfather believed I would” He said with a shudder remembering the bitter twisted old wizard who had denounced him rather thoroughly whenever he had the chance. He had been forbidden any recognition from the Prince line but his heir would still be entitled to it. There was no money, the old man had drunk it all away but there was a title and a seat on the council. “But this is all a matter for another time, for now I will look into the other matter, the prophecy...I can’t believe I never questioned by the meeting would be taking place there of all places”
“You look very cute” Draco said ruffling his hair with his fingers and Harry felt shy his stomach doing strange fluttering things. “Come on, prepare yourself, if you think Pants is bad wait till you meet her father he is beyond anything she is”
I hope everyone had a great Christmas no matter how you spent it
“Mr Weasley and Mr Weasley, how unexpected to see you both here, during a weekday...” Severus’ voice was music to his ears and a balm to his heart. He could tell that the Weasley twins had different feelings. Their faces had grown white and their eyes were bulged out of their heads. “I am almost certain that you should both be in a history of magic right now, not terrorising children”
“I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be as bad as your father”
“Hagrid, my old man! As absolutely spiffing as this all is, we have been entrusted with Harry and Draco on a tour around the castle so if you don’t mind” They said together their tones suggesting that they were prepared to do something if he did mind. “Right! Off we go, come on boys!” Harry allowed himself to be steered away from Hagrid and the alcove his skin still prickling with fear while Draco was clutching at his hand.
“Lord Potter! How nice it is to see you again!”
At the feeling on him relaxing Draco started to move pulling out before pushing in again. It was slow at first, almost torturous but then he started moving faster and harder and Harry ignored everything but the feeling of it. They spoke, he was sure of that, but it was babbles, incoherent and unimportant. Draco fucked with the power and passion he fought with and Harry loved every movement and moment of it. When the blond angled his hips in a certain way he hit something inside that was both numbing and so pleasurable that he couldn’t stop himself from letting out an almost scream.
“Scared? My dear boy! You have no reason to be scared! I only want what’s best for you, no matter how it seems” Dumbledore said and the expression on his face was almost completely genuine. He looked like an overly  indulgent grandfather looking at his favourite grandchild and if he had never met the Malfoy’s and seen how they cared for him he might have believed it. Instead he looked at the pale blue eyes hidden behind the half moon glasses and saw that they were hard. He felt a pressure at his mind, almost like when Severus or his mind healer read his mind, and he quickly looked away.
“Yeah, why is Theo working there? Out of all you lot...He was the least...I dunno...Slytherin” He shrugged pouring some more of the wine into his glass and Draco hummed in a graceful way before sipping the last of his wine. The colour stained his pale lips and Harry blinked quickly trying to ignore the heat in his stomach imagining leaning forward and kissing the drink away wondering if it would taste any better from Draco’s lips.
“Good people of Privet, I come with a decree from the palace, Prince Draco is to take a mate, all unmated omega are to attend a series of balls to honour his birthday. I have a list of names when I call your name you are to come to the carriage and take the invitation letter…Fox…” The speech was short and to the point and Harry watched as Michael Fox, a portly baker with two omega daughters stepped forward and took his letter. Harry bit on his lip and then made his way to the fountain glad that it was emptier than normal it would affect him, he thought with a shrug turning to the large metal pump and wincing as he looked at it. It truly was heavy, and his body already ached so much but still he lifted the handle and then pushed it down getting the water to flow. “Potter!” The advisor snapped and Harry almost tripped over the bucket. He hadn’t known his own name till Remus had told him and nobody in the village said it so he was surprised when the man with the onyx eyes was soon standing in front of him. His lip was curled and his eyes almost eerie as he scowled down at him. “What ever is the matter Potter? Too good for a decree from the palace?”
“Lucius, thank you, however you have already done so much…”
“Thank-you, mama” Draco’s hand darted forward taking his Godfather’s letter first as it was the slimmest of the two. Inside he found a single sheet of parchment saying;
“No, it’s not from Pants, Harry wrote back to thank me for the presents”
“Because I am in love with Draco” Harry answered with a laugh. Nobody knew how it had happened but the last of Voldemort’s spirit that resided in the Forest had exploded when Harry and Draco had kissed that night of the third ball. Dumbledore had led a party into the forest and found a twisted lump of bark in the centre of the forest. It could have been mistaken for a dead tree if it hadn’t been for the disgusting face. “And you shouldn’t joke about that in front of Severus. He is fond of Draco and not as fond of you since you tried to dress him as a bat” Harry chuckled looking at the bird who looked as though he wanted nothing more than to peck out the eyes of the twins. Fred and George looked nervously at the bird and then smiled.
“Yes. Lord Potter. This is all arranged Draco; it cannot be undone” Lucius was colder to his son than he had ever been before and Narcissa sent him a glare before gently squeezing her son’s hand saying softly
The scene changed with a swirl his eyes fogging over. He was older now but he was still hurting. Dudley had twisted his arm playing in the garden. He had felt something pop and there had been nothing but white hot pain. Dudley had panicked at his screaming, the Dursley’s hated anything that meant he would have to go to the hospital. He had looked at him for a moment before running for Aunt Petunia telling her that Harry had been climbing the apple tree in Mr Jenkins back garden and had fallen. It was the excuse that Aunt Petunia had used when he had gone to the hospital. His arm was stripped to his side and chest now. The doctor had been kind at first but then Aunt Petunia had told him what a bad boy he was, how much trouble he caused her. Always wanting attention, never happy. The doctor had changed after that telling him that it wasn’t good to do things that would waste time.
Harry had a lot of questions but he had always been told by the Dursleys’ not to ask questions. The answers were always ‘because I said so’ or ‘Boy go to your cupboard’ so when Mrs Figg had offered to answer questions that he did have he wound up sitting across from her in a dusty old attic that smelt vaguely like a bird cage. The seat he was sat on was comfortable however an the attic wasn’t as warm as it had been downstairs. The old lady tied his letter to Draco on the leg of an old barn owl that had watched him with curious bright yellow eyes and then had flown off though the small window.
“Alright, I’ll head out, you cover me” Harry said pushing his head out of the igloo and looking around. Slowly he moved his way further out and then Draco followed quickly grabbing some of the snowballs they had pilled together. There were no signs of his parents, but he knew better than to be complacent. Harry looked around a few times and then ran forward and Draco had to admit that he was fast, even on the soft snow but he didn’t have time to admire him as he soon had to start pelting snowballs at his mother and father who had appeared from behind the hedges.
“Nino said that it was because I was happy and safe here” Harry mumbled knowing that it was the truth. He had never been happier than he had been with the Malfoy’s and he hoped that they would never want him to leave.
“M-M-Mr P-P-Potter…How…How nice to s-ssee you…” The man stuttered nervous beady eyes searching his forehead and Harry found himself shying away from the man.
The room inside was painting free however the walls were made almost completely of glass offering views of a beautiful garden with trees and grass behind. The room itself was filled with sweetly smelling flowers and there were butterflies and tiny colourful birds flying about. He had never seen anything so beautiful and he gave a gasp as a pretty purple coloured bird swooped down and landed on his and Draco’s joined hands. It was so light and almost ticklish as it fluttered its wings its head cocking ever so slight to one side before it chirped and flew off to join those that were playing in the trees.
“Surprising, huh? About Uncle Sev’ and Lupin. I never would have imagined that Severus would have had a boyfriend”
“They are going to kill me! Uncle Vernon will shut me away and never let me out again!”
“Ready to be students at Hogwarts, Harry?” He asked as the train came to a stop. Movement was heard as all the students clambered to get off the train and Harry and friends joined them seeing Hagrid standing on the platform with a lantern in hand calling out for first years. He tried to catch Harry's eye a few times but Harry pointedly ignored him. Remus and Severus had told him that first years travelled by boat over the black lake and Harry hoped the ride would be smooth not wanting to lose the Pumpkin pasties overboard.
“Should we? You’re Harry. You’re our friend just the coolest one we’ve ever had”
“Dear Harry, you are very welcome and it’s a pleasure to have told you something about your parents, I’m sorry it was not more however, my God father was in the same year as them at school so he would be able to give more information about their time there by the time you have received this I will have written to him. The Scorching Herons are an amazing team, my parents shall be taking me to Japan later in the year and I am hoping to see them play.
“What is Alchemy? I think I heard Muggles talking about it” Harry wondered aloud, his green eyes fixed on the painting of the Chimera which seemed to have gotten bored and was now scratching at its back with a paw the goat head yawning before laying down on the head of a lion.
“Am I allowed to eat that Uncle Sev’?”
“I imagine not, he sent an owl this morning. I haven’t read it yet but I suppose that I must if only to save myself from receiving a dozen more” Lucius sighed heavily sitting back in his large chair while Draco came to stand in front of Harry.
“Wow, its...Beautiful, and old”
“This will has been tampered with! Lily would never...”
“Head up, Harry, we’re with you” He said and Harry nodded but he kept looking at the cobbled streets as they walked to the palace grounds. There was a long line at the main entrance but Narcissa was soon turning sharply to the left and slipping down a small alley that led to another gate that was guarded by two men in matching blue and yellow robes. Their wands came out as they approached and Narcissa gave a sweet smile presenting her own wand. “This is the private entrance for family and friends” Draco whispered as Narcissa spoke to the guards in flawless French. The two men looked at each other in surprise for a moment and then examined a ring Narcissa presented to them by placing their wands to it. Whatever they did seemed to work as they both bowed and stepped aside letting them through a gate, which looked like the gate to the town, which opened without them touching it. “Come on Harry”
“I’ll remind you that I am younger than you are Sevvie” Remus snorted, and Harry had to hide his own laugh by his hand.
“Why don’t you crawl back to your mummy, Grub and leave us alone?” Pansy growled darkly looking even more fierce than the boys. Her eyes were narrowed her snub nose turned up in disgust. “We were having fun”
If there is something you are putting off for better times just do it tomorrow isn’t promised ne.
“Come in, Harry” He said with a tense smile and Harry swallowed tugging nervously on his dove grey jumper. Remus’ room was more like his own separate apartment within the Malfoy home. He had a separate living area, mini-kitchen, bathroom, and even small study and that was where Severus led him. Remus was sitting at his desk scribbling away on a roll of parchment and when he turned round Harry smiled when he saw a smear of ink along his nose and over his right cheek. “I swear, Lupin, why do I put up with you?” Severus sighed taking out a neatly pressed handkerchief from the pocket of his trousers and proceeding to clean the other man’s face. “Are you adult or a child?”
“Excuse me! I am a Malfoy”
“Me?”
“Severus”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey Harry! Hope you’re well, it’s been arranged with your dads that you will be continuing your music lessons on Saturdays in your dad’s office. So, I have a little extra homework for you, I want you to try writing some music. Doesn’t have to be a masterpiece, just something you can play me when I see you on Saturday and I want you to practice the sheet I already wrote for you. Have a great first week of school kid and remember, Keep rocking! C.S”
“Yes, with Slytherin. We have potions with them as well. Do you have any homework?”
“You’re very welcome Harry, merry Yule” Narcissa moved their hats and pressed kisses to both their heads before taking her seat at the table immediately getting Lucius to pull her cracker with her. Lucius gave her a fond look and held up his own and soon both Malfoy’s were wearing what could only be described as crowns. Narcissa’s was more ornate than her husband with shining jewels and her beloved butterflies. Her prize was a small box and she gasped with happiness when she saw earrings inside that were also shaped like butterflies but were etched on the bodies with Harry and Draco’s names. “Thank you, my love, I will treasure them…” She said lifting Lucius’ hand to her lips and kissing his fingers.
Soon they were all settled in front of the fire and Draco felt himself feeling warm and fluffy, more so when Harry’s head came to rest on his shoulder. He laid his head on top of Harry’s a warm fuzzy feeling bubbling around inside his stomach. The winter festival really was the best that he had ever head and when it came to presents in a few days it would only be the icing on the cake.
“Did you see that?!” The girls gasped brightly in unison “She can do wandless magic!”
“Thank you.” Harry said flipping the book open surprised when a photo slipped from the pages. It was a faded Muggle photograph showing Chuck with a woman dressed in a flowing flowery dress with a headband in her hair. Chuck looked a few years younger and was smiling as he held a small boy with a serious expression in his arms. On his back with arms wrapped around his neck was another boy with a goofy grin and a lollipop. Two other boys were standing next to the woman while a third and final was standing a little way off with his back slightly towards the camera.
“I’ve always loved the manor at night, the moonlight coming in through the windows, the peaceful silence of it”
“Tea is fine” Severus pulled the visitors chair from Lucius desk and set it before him, and Remus almost laughed at the strangeness of it all. Here he was, a former member of the order of the phoenix sitting in Lucius Malfoy’s home drinking tea with Severus Snape, both of whom had been deep supporters of Lord Voldemort. Through the window of the study he could see Harry and Draco practicing on Broomsticks under the watchful eyes of both Narcissa and Lucius.
“Anything for the dark lord, Kingsley, Bella is cold, give her your robe” Narcissa ordered and still hoping Kingsley shrugged himself out of his robe and brought it over to Bella draping it around her shoulders. The cackling intensified but Narcissa could tell that her sister believed her. She inched closer her hand reaching out to Bella’s knee. It was almost skeletal under the filthy torn dress she wore. “We will return the Dark Lord and get you out of here Bella. I promise, but we have tried everything we know and failed, the ways of the Dark Lord were beyond us. You were his closest, his most admired, do you have anything that might help us find a way to get him back?”
“They do all the time in Japan”
“Will they be officially adopting Harry?”
“You forced him to relive the painful parts of his life. Without asking him, or even telling him what would happen? He is naught but a boy! A terrified boy. Many have called you cold and unfeeling, I denied those claims as I know them to be unfounded for the most part but this”
“You’re welcome, we haven’t been properly introduced. I’m Nino and you are Fred and George?” Nino introduced herself politely to the twins both flushing a deep red which clashed horribly with their hair as they fell over themselves to point at each other.
“Very well I will write to Lupin, if Harry approves, and suggest a meeting” Lucius sent his grey eyes over to Harry who was being almost force fed an entire pack of bacon. “Draco, you have your mother’s mother hen nature. You should perhaps let Harry feed himself”
“It is. Same family of the Unicorn but much friendlier to men”
“Very well, I will sstay here, for now, sso you don’t forget me again…”
“You don’t think I’m a freak?” Harry asked tension leaving his shoulders that he had not realised he had had. A tight lump also eased from the back of his throat and he gave an exceedingly small smile. Severus had looked so grave and pale that he had been sure the man was regretting adopting him but did not know how to tell him. Severus moved swiftly his arms around him in a small hug his eyes narrowing at the people around them that sent more than brief glances their way.
On another note! Thank you all for sticking with me and all the kudos! I can’t believe that little story of mine as so many likes! It makes me so very happy that people are liking it 😊
If you can, tell him of us, tell him that the best day of our lives was the day he came into it. Tell him that we never stopped loving him. Tell him I cried when he first called me Dadda and I didn’t believe that I could have made something that perfect. Tell him that I was an idiot but he was the very best part of me, the part that made me realise how much of an idiot I had been. Tell him that he is never alone, and that his mother and father loved him enough for a thousand lifetimes. And then, tell him that you love him, that you are glad that he came into your lives and that no matter what happens you will love him.
“Always happy to help, your guardian will need to sign a few papers as you are not yet of age” Tormuld motioned to Lucius who took out his wand and placed it against the paper the Goblin was pointing to. It glowed red hot and then an elegant signature appeared on the paper glowing in a steel grey. “Thank-you Lord Malfoy, here are the items. I will send a copy of the records of the Potter and Black vaults”
“Um…Why do you call him Ai-baka?”
I really hope that you will enjoy this part
“Can we go to the Quidditch pitch? Harry expressed an interest...”
“Are you planning on running off and becoming a Pirate, Dray?” Harry asked with a chuckle and Draco shook his head his place face becoming a bright pink.
“Your Granda wouldn’t happen to want a pair of Turtle doves’ would he?” Harry asked hopefully and Seamus almost looked eager before shaking his head and rubbing the back of his neck with a sad frown saying;
“They might, they have a much better keeper now, but the Devils in Amber have better beaters” Draco answered with a nod and Harry bit on his lip looking down at the table only just realising that his plates had been vanished away. Pansy sucked on her top lip for a moment before saying in an uncertain way;
“Good show old girl!” The man in the portrait said in a voice that sounded almost identical to Lucius’s.
“I’m sure I will” Harry chuckled at the man’s excitement while Draco continued to tell him about Blackbeard or rather Edward Teach.
“You have such a high opinion of me uncle!” Draco pouted from the doorway jerked his head to look at his friend who had a mock hurt expression creasing his handsome face. “Actually I’m here with a message from father. The Goblins have finally gotten the key to Harry’s vault from Dumbledore”
Diggory appears…I always thought he would have been mentioned more in cannon, he seemed popular and he was a quidditch player but hey-ho!
“You…Choose Black over me…In school…” The potion master said so softly Remus thought he might have misheard him if not for his wolf senses. His smile faded quickly remembering that night as though it was yesterday. Severus coming bursting through the hidden door of the shack his face alight with delight before turning to absolute horror as he saw the monster he truly was.
“Harry doesn’t want them knowing yet, he shouldn’t worry, his true friends will be happy for him.” Luna assured him but, in spite of how much he trusted her, he couldn’t shake the feeling that it was going to go badly. Ron had never really forgiven him for not marrying Ginny, Harry was sure he was going to blow his top knowing he was actually dating their former school rival. “You should speak to Ginny first. You haven’t seen her since you’ve been back, have you?”
“I dunno, I’ve never seen a fairy, I wouldn’t know what they looked like. Plus, you have a pet wolf enchanted”

“Come on Harry! We should go dress if we are to go to Paris today! I can loan you some of my clothes again though mother will have to shrink them to fit”
“I’m not your house elf potter!”
“You didn’t manage to knock it down, but I’m impressed. Keep practicing…Harry, can I have a word?” Nino asked and Harry swallowed nervously his smile slipping away as his mind was filled with images of his former teachers who had berated him for his poor grasp of subjects and lack of homework. Nino was smiling as she led him a little further away. “Harry, what were you thinking about?”
“And you sir” Harry replied very softly trying to  look up from the floor like Lucius had told him but he was too nervous. He did take the hand offered however and he notice that it was roughened and calloused not like a doctors hand more like a gardener. The back was also hairy but there was a warmth to it and a gentleness like that he would imagine in a grandfather. He flicked his eyes upwards to see that the grandfatherly man was smiling.
“We cannot take his past, Remus, however we are doing everything we can to ensure he is happy and healthy. I would feel better if I spoke with his mind healer, I have a strong suspicion that this is not something he has revealed but it is something that he should speak about”
“I should say so” He hummed sniffing the aged whisky before continuing “The greater wizarding population will be on Dumbledore’s side. He is a hero still for what he did to Grindlewald”
“Severus…” Remus didn’t manage to get out another word, but he slipped on the ring and stared at it with such wonder that nobody was left in any doubt as to what his answer was.
“You clumsy boy! Clean this up right now!”
“Lady Malfoy, I am grateful for the offer, but I wouldn’t want to impose”
Wow! Over 500 kudos I cant believe it xD
“Sounds, familiar” Severus hummed, thinking of his own youth. He had always been good at magic with a wand and potions but for the life of him wandless had always escaped him unless he was protecting himself from the brutal attacks of his own father.
The Ravenclaw table was silent as Harry and Draco sat down and Harry could feel the overwhelming pressure of peoples’ eyes on him. He smiled weakly at a few of the people closest to him and then looked over at the head table. Severus was looking over at him his eyes warm and a faint smile playing around on his thin lips as Nino chatted happily away on his left and the man in the turban sat pale faced and silent on his right.
“And the Malfoy’s, they are my family as well, and you Pans. You’re like the sister I never knew I wanted.”
“We do not know yet, but again we will find out. Things are moving forward, and we will make sure that whatever happens we will be one step ahead. Dumbledore is out of Hogwarts; his replacement will soon be chosen” Lucius spoke with a confidence that calmed the hearts of all those that were listening to him and even Severus found himself believing that everything would be okay. “The current defence teacher has handed in his notice, Dumbledore had accepted a young wizard barely out of Hogwarts, but I have convinced the board to change tactic and hire somebody else. Somebody we can trust”
“Skegness? I...I see, then very well we will go to Skegness” She said softly hoping her Husband would know where that was in the world. It seemed like a muggle place but if that was where Harry wanted to go she would happily take him.
“I...What? How could I do that? I was only a baby”
“Potion lessons with the imbeciles is never fun Harry, as you have missed your lessons for today, I wish for you both to write an essay on the YingLang plant and which potions it is best used in”
“Close to it” Narcissa said looking around with a disapproving sniff and Draco followed suit very nearly scowling at the neat rows of houses that all looked identical with neat little gardens and houses with net curtains. “How depressing, come Draco, Mrs Figg lives over here on Wisteria Drive., she gave me her address in her letter”
“…No…I mean, how can I? Oh…You guys are having sex, do you know that’s gross?” Harry whined making sure his voice didn’t carry as he watched Remus and Nino teach Seamus to mount the broom correctly.
“Oh, I wouldn’t say that, I just like them from a distance rather than having them running towards me honking like a demon banshee. Are you okay? You seemed a little...Earlier...Your neck...” Draco hummed carefully his grey eyes moving to the spot on his neck that he always scratched and immediately Harry’s hand went to the spot clawing at it as he remembered what had happened in his aunt and uncles home.
“Who better than Ninomiya? She is highly skilled, and the board agreed that it would be good to have a change from a European witch or Wizard. She knows Harry and what he has suffered” Severus found himself agreeing. The little Japanese witch might not be somebody he would have picked, Lupin would be an excellent teacher, but she was fond of Harry and Draco and both boys trusted her. He had been doubtful when he had found that Quirrell had been offered the job finding him to be too nervous by half. He had been the muggle studies teacher before being offered the role but was currently travelling about the world to try and get experience. The last he had heard he was in Albania.
Draco didn’t know how long he stood there watching, it could have been hours or minutes, but it was too soon when the boy got up and put his book into a hole in the stump before moving away in the opposite direction leaving Draco alone in the woods with a fading scent and a bitter realisation that he should have spoken to the boy. His fox was howling at him for not doing so. He had vowed to come back again the next day and he had but there was no sign of the omega, nor the day after and on the third he had left the country estate to return to the city palace.
The stairs to the press box were blissfully empty as the mismatched party made their way slowly up wards. Around them Harry could feel the happy buzz of excitement from the fans and it was buzzing inside of him as well. Nino, Draco and the twins were all talking about the upcoming game, the twins announcing that they were on the Gryffindor team at Hogwarts as beaters, and were happy to discuss their favourite players in both teams they were about to watch but Harry was looking at the various people in the different boxes. He had never seen so many Wizard and witches all together and he was amazed at the various fashions that they were wearing. Thankfully, none of them were as elaborate as Dumbledore but they would easily be seen if they were walking down a muggle street.
Ginny looked up at him and Harry swallowed as he saw how much of a woman she truly was now. The years had been kind to her, her once long ginger hair was now cut into a bob and highlighted making it have more of a true red and not the orange red of her youth. She had about eight piercings in one ear while the other only had one. She had always been pretty but now she was beautiful, and she walked with the grace of a dancer as she came over to him. Her blue eyes shone as she broke into a genuinely happy smile.
“I’m sorry, Father, that having friends is such a foreign thing for you that you feel that you must make childish barbs and jibes. However, you cannot make me feel guilty for my friendship with Harry or anything else that may come of it…”
“Forgive me, Professor but...I don’t think you are a man who would willing share memories” Harry whispered holding the small vial in his hands delicately as though he was holding a treasure and he knew that for the man in front of him he knew that he was. He had seen the way Severus had looked when he had spoken of Lily. It made him happy that his mother was so well thought of when the Dursley’s had always just insulted her memory.
Any supernatural fans will find the name Chuck Shurley familiar and that is not a coincidence. Harry’s music teacher will be Chuck because I am obsessed with his character and I know he is pretty much dark side but…Rob Benedict is probably the sweetest human being I have had the pleasure of talking to so yup he will be a lovable dork who teaches Harry guitar I guess you could say my Chuck is probably more Rob...
“Good evening first years, I am Professor McGonagall, deputy headmistress of Hogwarts and head of Gryffindor, in just a few moments you will be led through these doors and be sorted into your houses” Draco flashed the teacher a smile as she turned to look at him and Harry and she returned it very briefly before continuing “The houses are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. While you are here your houses will be your family, good grades and behaviour will earn you points while rule breaking will lose you points. Each house as a head, Ravenclaw is Professor Flitwick, Hufflepuff is Professor Sprout, Slytherin is Professor Snape. However, any and all of the teachers here at Hogwarts are available if you have any difficulties. Headmistress Sinistra is available day or night. Any questions?”
“Yes, unfortunately the muggles he was with didn’t take care of him. Pansy, I ask you as my oldest friend never to say a word of this to anyone, mostly Harry, he has had enough pain in his life”
“Remus John Lupin, you have been entrusted with the son of James Fleamont Potter and Lily Jane Potter nee Evans, will you add your blood to the potion to make Hadrien Junius Peverell your child”
“Eeep! If youse is sures! Thank-you Master Lucius!” Jinx beamed happily her nose almost brushing against the floor as she bobbed a bow.
“Of course, I don’t mind you touching me” Harry answered and Draco hugged him tightly while Jinx patted him on the hand with her long fingers. Remus stood in the background looking a little awkward.
“Didn’t really have much time for...Hook-ups...” He admitted and then yelled as Draco’s mouth swallowed the head of his cock. His thin very pale cheeks hallowed out and Harry was almost positive that there was a real chance that Draco might manage to do what Voldemort had been trying for years and that feeling only grew when, with his eyes still fixed on him, he started moving his head slowly back and forth taking in more of his cock before working it back out and just sucking on the end again his tongue dragging up and down the sensitive slit in the head. He had fantasied about this in the forests of dean, the locket had whispered it to him while he slept coaxing him with promises of delights.
“Don’t worry, ‘Arry, I don’t understand ‘Ow it works either but Hogwarts is full of them and they always help you go where you need to be if you ask them nicely” Hestia said from were she was walking behind them her hands in the pockets of her robes. Knowing that an adult didn’t know how they worked made Harry feel better and he was glad when Draco pulled him to one last door and pushed it open.
“The report claims that it makes it possible that the sufferer keeps his mind during full moons. I have looked into it myself and the theory is sound, he believes that he will have such a potion ready in ten years”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Oh? So I shouldn't ask you to lunch then, Draco?" Harry asked with a smirk and a lifted eyebrow and although he looked stunned for a moment Draco quickly recovered.
“What...Were their names?”
“Very good, Mr Malfoy.” She said before once again moving around the classroom. All in all, it wasn’t an overly taxing lesson, but it wasn’t as fun as Nino’s had been. There were given some homework on the principles of Transfiguration and then dismissed. They headed to the Ravenclaw dorm alone, Alice and Chao-Xiang having gone to speak with some girls from Hufflepuff. The common room was fuller than it had been the night before, but nobody paid them attention as they made their way to their room to dump their bags on their beds or rather, bed.
“Why apologise? You have no control over your dreams Harry, dreams are a reflection of all your life experiences up until this point. You have reason to suffer nightmares, Harry, just as I do” Lucius hummed carefully his tone light and soft as he stared into the flickering candle. Harry was surprised to know that the older man had nightmares, he had always believed that adults didn’t have bad dreams and he gasped;
“It will be okay, Harry, I promise” Draco whispered before going to the stool and sitting down. The hat slid over his eyes and Draco heard its voice in his mind.
He followed her to a messy kitchen and was directed to sit down at the table while she pottered around pouring a dark brown liquid into a glass that was slightly dusty but otherwise clean. Harry moved aside a pile of clothes disturbing another of the cats before putting his book down and looking at the woman’s hunched back as she muddled around looking through some cake and biscuit tins.
“Really? I played with him at school. He could have gone pro-man! What’s he up to now?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“They’ve gone now Harry, why don't you come in?” Mrs Figg said lightly and jerking his heard around Harry peered through the branches of the trees and saw her standing on her doorstep one of her dozen cats wrapped around her leg. “come on, more comfortable than the dirt and it wont be long before they come back again, I’ve just made some dandelion and burdock"
(See the end of the chapter for
“I see, very well, now you boys go have fun I will send an elf for you” Narcissa rose gracefully and then moved around the table kissing Draco on the forehead before hesitating for only a second before doing the same with Harry her fingers running through his hair. “Go, enjoy yourselves”
“As well as can be expected, they don’t like me because I am a Malfoy, and I am controlling Harry somehow and forcing him to do as I say. Which is strange since I thought we were turning Harry into the next Dark Lord, shouldn’t I be listening to everything he says?” Draco pulled a face looking as flippant as ever while Harry bristled as he remembered the cruel words thrown out last night and this morning. “We can deal with them though, right Harry?”
“Bella is insane, my love, but I am still her baby sister she will not hurt me. I will word it so she will think I am trying to bring back the dark lord. If she knows anything, she will tell me” Narcissa sounded certain and confident but Severus wasn’t so sure. He was positive that the loyal who had served the Dark lord wouldn’t be too happy with those that had gotten away with it. Lucius continued to stare at his wife in silence his eyes seemingly searching her soul before he brought her hand to his lips and kissed it gently.
“I wouldn’t have been as happy as I am with you, Dray” Harry said with so much feeling it felt as though the words had been punched out of him. Even talking about a world were he and Draco were anything other than friends was enough to choke him.
“If you keep saying things like that, I will tell mother about what you were doing in the painting of the nuns. She will lock you in the basement” Draco huffed amused when the Knight put his helmet back on very quickly and then went back to his pose of holding his banner high in the air. “Sorry about that, even as a painting Horologium is full of hot air, but he’s mostly harmless, except when he’s had a drink”
“Thanks for coming professor and for being a witness”
“Wow! It’s so beautiful!” Harry whispered and it seemed that the Auror agreed as she was soon walking around looking at the pixie birds and butterflies while Draco led Harry to a set of wicker chairs behind a glass table. The chairs were set to look out onto the garden and Harry let out an excited cry as he saw a white peacock fluffing out his tail feathers. “It’s a peacock! A white peacock”
“You wish for me to see my sister?”
“Yup!” Pansy let out a happy sigh her head resting on his shoulder. “I can’t wait to go to Hogwarts, but you have to promise me, even if we are in different houses, we will be friends, Harry.”
“We will have a great many holidays! You will come with us to Japan, won’t he mother? And wherever else you would like to go...Is there anywhere you have ever dreamed of going?”
“I lived in a cupboard until a few months ago” Harry stated unable to look at the werewolf positive that his heart had entered the back of his throat. “Just saying you care about me is all I needed”
“Yes, the door is open mother” Draco answered his arms still tight around Harry. The door to the changing room opened partially and Narcissa stepped inside. There was the now familiar smile on her face and Harry wanted to bask in it but instead he shrunk back ashamed of how he was feeling and how much trouble he was causing.
“Parents must always embarrass their children,  no matter how old they get...Tormuld clearly loves  him”
“I will just grow more nervous while we wait” Harry whispered honestly reaching to push his glasses up his nose. He couldn’t wait to be able to go through the process of having his eyes fixed but he knew that it was going to take a while. His progress with his current set of medications was slow and he was only just adjusting to life with the brace. Every day he grew a little more used to it but he did have to take his pain potions. The doctor had given him the all clear to have the spell on all day but so far Harry was positive his legs were still bowed and his hip was constantly sore  though Narcissa had taken to learning massages that helped even if he felt embarrassed.
“Treacle tart with vanilla ice cream...” He said knowing that it was a boring choice when he had had lots of amazing food with the Malfoy’s but he would never forget the treacle tart he’d had one night when he was about 6 years old. It was the only time he had tried to run away from the Dursley’s, he hadn’t made it further than the street three across as he was afraid of crossing the road by himself. It had gotten late and he hadn’t been wearing shoes or a coat when a young couple with a baby, who had just come home from a church service had spotted him. They had been kind, the first people who ever had been, and the wife Margaret had invited him in and given him some freshly made treacle tart and ice cream. He hadn’t had it again until he had been with the Malfoy’s but the thought of the tart had kept him going some nights.
“I deserve an award. Did you know that Granger didn’t shut up? It was two before she finally stopped talking last night. She kept warbling about Dumbledore and how it wasn’t fair that he was no longer headmaster.” Pansy speared a tomato with a fork with such anger that Harry could only imagine she was thinking about Hermione or perhaps Dumbledore. The mention of the old man made Harry’s insides squirm a little and he was thankful when the topic changed to the break in at Gringotts. The twins were convinced that it was Dobby, who still hadn’t been found after escaping the hospital, and Harry listened with only half an ear looking up at the top table where his dad was talking to Quirrell in a low voice. His expression was unreadable from here and probably even if he was closer but when the man looked up and saw him staring, he gave him a smile. Harry was immediately surprised when pain flashed through his forehead. It was short but sharp causing him to gasp out loudly and almost double over at the force of it.
“Thank-you.” Harry mumbled back in response hurrying down the stairs and back out of the Ravenclaw dorm. They were halfway down the moving staircase when he saw Francis and the Hufflepuff he, Albright and Pointer had joined to form their group of four for DADA, Neville Longbottom. After a brief hello, which only Francis replied to while Neville stared intently at his shoes, they carried on down the stairs and into the main corridor. The front doors were open, and Harry decided to let the snake out now while it was still light and she could find herself somewhere safe and warm.
“Yes, this way” Harry moved through Mrs Figg’s garden and out onto Wisteria Drive. He could see the lace curtains twitching as the strange trio made their way to the alley that ran all the way to Privet Drive. Vernon still wasn’t back yet as his car wasn’t in the drive but Petunia was standing in the doorway with Dudley and his gang around her. Her arms were folded over her skinny chest and her beak like lips were drawn into a thin line.
Ive started posting another draco/harry  story the twelve days of Christmas if you would like to read it
“True, my heart, which is why I need you to do something I would never dream of asking” Severus own breathing stalled at the words of his friend knowing what was going to be asked of her, but Narcissa gave a smile saying easily and confidently
“I think that maybe we should invite the Malfoys and Severus back into the room and talk about it” Remus sounded just as overcome as Harry and the ten-year-old nodded clearing his throat before weakly calling for Jinx. The house elf came immediately her large gnarled hand coming to rest on his as she gave him a smile.
“We showed them around the school, as promised” Both twins answered quickly before lowering their voices and inching towards the professor “We had a mild run in with Hagrid in the halls.”
“It has to be magic” Draco chuckled while Harry grinned with a nod. His skin was prickling with excitement his brain still struggling to believe that after this weekend he would have a father who cared about him. “Harry, you okay?”
“That was fucking amazing” He moaned and Harry let out a laugh his legs feeling like jelly as he moved to turn around only to find himself sinking to the floor Draco following behind his arms wrapped around him. For long minutes never of them spoke but eventually Draco muttered “As nice as that was Potter, what happens now?”
“A favourite colour? I haven’t thought about it, but I think I like purple”
“Well, there is a belief that if you want good luck for the coming year then the first visitor in your home has to be a dark-haired man carrying coal and bread. Uncle Sev’ is always our first visitor, though if he’s staying here then we will have to ask somebody else. Don’t muggles do anything like that?”
“Oh…Interesting…A Malfoy, you should be in Slytherin, yes, in another time, another place…So easy…You still have that cunning, that drive for power…Slytherin would be your true…”
“You don’t sound happy with that idea Draco, have I done something to displease you?” Lucius asked and although his tone was dry anyone that knew the Malfoy lord would see the humour in his grey eyes. Draco gave a smile shaking his head, his father was considered cold by some families but he had never been in doubt that he loved him. He was a busy man however and was often stretched thin trying to redeem his name after the war. “I will be going in later, however I wanted to talk with you. Severus floo called me last night, he said that you have been asking about the Potters, when I spoke with your mother she said that you had started a correspondence with the young Potter heir”
“Dare I ask?”
“I would also tell you something of your father but my memories of him are not the best. There is one that you should perhaps seek out however. He was friend to your father and the only one around in a fit state that can tell you about him in a more favourable light. Remus Lupin. In fact, Lucius it would be a good idea for you to reach out to him yourself, before Dumbledore has a mind to”
“It was interesting Lord...Mr...Lucius, sir, Pansy was really nice and the Parkinsons” Harry answered quickly moving out of the way as the floo flared and Narcissa stepped through as though she had just walked in from another room.
“Cissy?” Bella hissed her eyes going to Kingsley who was standing in the corner as still as a statue. Narcissa let out the meanest laugh she could manage.
“As am I, but enough of this...Narcissa perhaps Harry should be put to bed and Draco you should go with him. Perhaps not to sleep but to be at his side should he wake. Jinx, will you be with him also? He finds comfort in you”
“We never reveal our sources, Harry…”
“My father. One of my father’s is a werewolf”
“Hello and welcome to your first Defence against the dark arts lesson. As the head mistress told you yesterday my name is Kazuko Ninomiya, but please call me Nino. I graduated three years ago from the Japanese academy of magic as a Gold Robe user and my passion has always been spell work, history, mysteries and the combination of all those.” Nino smiled in the friendly way she did when she had been teaching just Harry and Draco and Harry was glad to realise that her lessons were going to be as friendly and relaxed as they had been then. Behind the small Japanese teacher, a piece of chalk was floating against a blackboard copying down everything she was saying and Harry allowed his gaze to drift around the rest of the classroom. Like Nino herself, her teaching space was much the same as it had been in Malfoy manor, though now there were shelves with large arcane looking scrolls sealed with large lumps of aged wax. Decorating the walls were pictures and diagrams, some of various dark creatures, including a werewolf, and of people that seemed to be under the effects of dark magic with notes telling what to look out for. On her large wooden desk at the front of the class was a globe but it didn’t look like any globe Harry had seen before. “I hope to learn each and all of your names over the coming lessons but first things first....I would like you to sort yourselves into groups of four. I don’t care if you mix houses just so long as are four and you are all standing together, please.”
“And Draco lives in Hogsmeade now” Luna said knowingly tucking a strand of loose dirty blonde hair behind her ear and showing off a baby carrot earing.  Harry let out a laugh, his friend had been encouraging his relationship with Draco for years now and Harry could tell that she knew what he had asked Draco already. “You and he will make a good pairing, Harry.  You have always been drawn to each other and all your lovers have always been blonde. I’m glad you’ve asked him out.”
Seriously lupin will appear soon
“Pants I have no idea what drivel you are spouting...”
“No, but you are keeping yourself awake and I doubt that is good for your head” Draco turned his head his eyes narrowing on his scar for a moment before he moved back to stare at the ornate plaster work.
“Are you ready to go down? The gifts for the eleven days are all practical things but those we get on the twelfth are all games and fun things!” Draco hummed happily, his grey blue eyes shone with childish glee and Harry smiled widely, but he could still feel a strange ball of nerves in his stomach. He had never gotten excited by Christmas. At the Dursley’s it had always just meant extra work. Vernon’s sister would come to stay with one or more of her awful ugly dogs. He would start making dinner on Christmas eve and then watch through the hole in his door as the Dursley’s would sneak around putting presents from Santa under the tree. There was always so many that most of the fake garish tree was hidden and Dudley still wanted more. Nothing had been there for Harry, of course, he didn’t even get a thank-you for all the cooking he did. Christmas had always been just another, busier day. “You’re thinking too hard again, Harry, come on! The elves always make a super breakfast today”
“Just let her do this for a while Harry and then we will complain and she will let us do something fun, there is a magical zoo inside the palace grounds we could go and see it, couldn’t we mother?”
On a completely different side note, my oldest nephew has made a youtube channel where he is teaching how to build houses and such he has promised me to build the four Hogwarts common rooms and he showed me how to build a sweet fantasy witches cottage….so if anyone would like to go over and support his channel (Maybe as an extra way to kudos my story?) it can be found here:
“Into the forest. Boris rode slowly to the edge of a dark forest. A hag was said to live within, a fearsome hag with long black hair and skin so dirty it looked green. Her fingers were as long as a mans arms they said tipped with black nails that were more like the claws of a beast. Boris the brave had always been afraid of the woods and dared not enter them even when his huntsman travelled into them to fetch wild boar. “I am Boris the brave” Boris said standing at the edge of the wood not feeling very brave at all. “I will go and fight the hag and take one of her nails back! It will prove I am brave” He said still standing at the opening of the woods not attempting to move forward. Suddenly movement to his left had him jumping with a shout that sounded so high pitched it might have come from a mouse. “”Who goes...Who goes there? Speak quickly for I am Boris the brave...” Boris called feeling as far from brave as he could possibly be but determined to be so. “Come out! Come out or I shall...” As he spoke a small mouse ran from the bushes and stared up at him with beady black eyes. The creature twitched his nose and waved his ears before scurrying off again leaving the knight bemused, embarrassed and shaken, glad that nobody had witnessed his fear he took a deep breath and marched into the forest...”
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you” Harry said as Lucius came to the bed a lantern floating a his side causing a deep orange light to flow over one side of his face. He was dressed in a grey dressing gown, a pair of black pyjama bottoms and some slippers on his feet. His hair was tied into a side ponytail and was resting on his shoulder fitted with a silk black ribbon to hold it into place. He didn’t seem to have been woken from sleep but Harry couldn’t help but feel as though he had disturbed the man.
“Is that so? If that is the case, I will look forward to welcoming you to Ravenclaw with open arms” The professor was positively gleaming as he seemed to bounce up and down on the spot and Harry found himself liking the man who clearly seemed to love his job and those he taught. He had met one other teacher like that.
“Very well, Chuck” Lucius winced as though it was painful to say the nickname. “We are grateful that you could come, my nephew Harry has been wanting to learn the guitar for some time however it is not an instrument that is common in British pureblood circles”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I got six. Mine is still in my pocket and I owled one to Pansy already. I thought perhaps you might want to invite the Weasley twins”
“I never touched him, nor would I throw mud. Your...Child, threw mud at young Mr Potter, it is hardly my fault if instead he hit himself. Now madam, as I am assuming you are Mr Potter's aunt you are unfortunately the woman I want to speak with. We can do so here on the street or we can step inside" As Lucius spoke Harry saw him sliding out the smaller ornate looking stick from his cane. Petunia saw it as well and her irate face paled and fear filled her eyes. It told Harry that his aunt knew that he was a wizard and that he was also. Anger bubbled inside of him but he squished it down waiting to see what would happen next.
“Seamus Finnigan and me mam, Bridget Finnigan…You all going to Hogwarts next year?” Seamus asked as they trailed down from the boxes and Harry gave a nod pointing to himself and his friends.
“Thank-you, but the potion master Severus Snape has said he will make the potions needed” Lucius answered and Tobias gave a pleased nod waving his wand towards a funny feather which seemed to spring into life and start writing on a piece of parchment. The scratching filled the sitting room as the doctor set his pale blue eyes onto Lucius. There was some surprise in them but he was happy when he said;
