As though Draco has to make sure of that, his hand finds Harry’s own, and he squeezes, holding onto Harry with a firm pressure. The way Draco sometimes touches him is new and happens only ever since Harry told him that he died on the night of the battle and that, had Narcissa been by his side only a minute before, she would have found him very dead indeed.
. Harry’s gaze drifts down Hermione’s middle several times, and eventually she laughs a little and says, “Yes, I’m pregnant.” They already know it’s a boy, and Harry learns that his best friends have a two-year-old daughter named Rose. Ron works half-time at the Wheezes, he quit the Aurors when ‘Mione was pregnant. Right now, Molly and Arthur are watching Rosy while her daddy is working, and Mummy will need to cut back some hours very soon.
Anyway, Harry went on about how rare wizard pregnancies are and inquired after St Mungo’s appointments which I don’t have. He looked a bit panicky when I said that I wasn’t sure whether St Mungo’s could even help me. “We ought to try,” he insisted. He generally slipped into saying “we” which gave me more than a little hope. And a ludicrous amount of Wrackspurts fluttering about in my belly.
Their conversations didn’t amount to much, and Harry didn’t expect Draco to be clever or witty or amusing. That was a blessing. Occasionally, Harry would bring Muggle take-out or he’d cook for them both. Potter was a surprisingly good cook, but not of the fancy, avant-garde foods that Draco had gotten used to eating. Harry cooked heavy, stodgy foods of the sort that Draco hadn’t eaten since Hogwarts. Harry cooked Shepherd’s pie, Toad-in-the-Hole and fish and chips, hot filling heavy foods.
We sat together way into the night after that. He looked at me a little funny when I refused the beer he had stored away in a cupboard, but he didn’t pry. It feels like he reads me so well. He knows that something is up.
The ceremony and the party were intimate and simple. Harry felt bad for not inviting Nick who talked to Harry on the phone occasionally, only once or twice a year, but whenever they did, they did for hours on end. But Harry had no wish to introduce him to magic. Despite that, Harry would’ve liked to keep the ceremony even smaller, but he couldn’t cut off half the Weasley’s because they were his family and Molly still had a hard time forgiving him for spending years and years away. For the sake of harmony, he invited them all. For the same sake, he reminds himself to visit them at least once a month even though their company often feels oppressive. “
Christmas Day and finally seeing Draco came quickly. Fortunately, I had finished MoonStar the previous evening – yes, I was well aware that I’d cut it rather fine, but that didn’t really matter. All that mattered was that the broom was wrapped and waiting under the tree for when Teddy awoke. My little godson was overjoyed by it. Draco’s idea was a great one, and the moment that I strode through the Fireplace into Andi’s cottage Teddy launched into me, a small, brightly haired bundle of joy, entirely awash with exhilaration and thrill.
They shift higher on the bed until their heads are resting on the soft pillows, facing each other, both shirtless with their jeans on. Harry’s eyes are locked on Draco’s own.
Harry pushes closer until Draco relents, unfolding his arms and wrapping them around Harry together with the blanket that’s still draped over his bony shoulders. Harry hugs him close, breathing in the scent below Draco’s ear that’s so unmistakably him, familiar and never enough; finding the safety of Draco’s body heat. A frisson of relief washes over Harry as he feels Draco’s tension thaw away, their bodies slack against the railing. “I’d never leave you,” Harry murmurs into Draco’s air, holding him through a shudder. “It’s only us. Forever. I’m not going anywhere.”
Harry looked around the sparkling restaurant and back at his fiancé. He couldn’t imagine a more magical night.  A future shared with Draco was the only one he wanted.
It was these circumstances, however, that had Harry standing under the stream of the shower that he got installed right next to the tub into the outdated bathroom of Grimmauld Place only three-or-so years ago. Eyes closed. His soaped-up hands washing his crotch and,
Harry looked aghast. “That wasn’t what I was saying! I’d never disparage another wizard for how he chose to live his life. Fuck knows there were enough headlines about me when I was younger.” He shook his head again. “Look, I don’t care who the father is, Draco, but shouldn’t he be looking after you? I’ve never seen anyone more in need of a friend than you are right now.”
Harry shrugs, but then he feels guilty. It’s not like he doesn’t care. Quite the opposite. He cares very much. “Sorry, yes. Yes, please.”
I took Draco’s word for it. Soon I’d built up a nice rhythm and our bodies were bouncing together. The water was cascading over us, and I clasped hard to Draco’s sides, holding him tight. My cock slid across Draco’s perineum and bumped the underside of his balls, and he pressed his thighs together, tight as he could manage to build up some friction.
Harry smiles, grateful for ‘Mione and her unerring understanding of others. Harry’s smile grows wider when he looks at Draco at his side, clad only in his swim trunks. His delicate pallor is reddened on his cheek bones and the thin bridge of his nose. His shoulders almost gleam in an angry hue of red.
,” Draco said. “Maybe have a drink and a dance? You don’t have to sit there like a block of bloody wood,” Draco joked flippantly. "You used to be quite the catch, Potter.
Another thing that I have never heard from a client. “I want you to touch me,” I told him. I shrugged out of my suit jacket and pulled my shirt out of my trousers. With his hands clasped in mine, I shoved his fingers under my shirt, over my skin, very much the way I enjoy it.
Draco poked his finger on the front of the newspaper and parroted the words that Cormac had used so many weeks ago. “She was asking for it,” Draco said. “Looking for attention. Drunk and promiscuous. She shouldn’t have gone back to his hotel if she didn’t want sex.”
A shudder jolts through Harry’s body as he leans on the balustrade, ice-cold on his forearms, and lets his head lull forward, closing his eyes against the sadness that slowly buds inside his chest. The feeling sprouts, tightening his throat and inevitably stinging his eyes. He needs to change everything. The coke, the risky sex with complete strangers, the heroin—definitely the heroin—and when he’s being really honest with himself, even the drinking. He recognises the symptoms; the insomnia, the tremor that sometimes seizes his whole body and makes him unsteady on his feet, the disorientation and paranoia and memory loss and potency disorder and-
The fight lost Harry’s voice when he mutters, “What are you even looking for, Draco? What do you hope to get out of this?”
“It’s about showing affection,” he goes on, locking eyes with Harry, and Harry finds that he couldn’t agree more. “It’s that they don’t take their time to actually listen to me. See, when I was fourteen, complaining-“ He stops, giving a staccato of hoarse, mirthless laughter. “I was fourteen.
Draco felt off-kilter. He hadn’t touched a drop of alcohol since the party, but the room was spinning. The world that he’d known had shifted, and he was running,
Harry shifted his hands swiftly and dropped Draco like he was aflame. He took two steps backwards and raised his hands up in a gesture of sincerity. Draco narrowed his eyes, assessing the threat.
“Look, I don’t mean to be rude, but I’d rather be left alone tonight,” he finally manages to mutter.
And Harry remembers the year after that, one year on the day, and how utterly speechless he was to find Malfoy at the low buzz of the Wards bordering the Hogwarts grounds in the dead of night, his cheeks hollow and his sunken eyes like bruises. Even something about his hair didn’t look quite right, and it took Harry several years to understand that Malfoy’s wandlessness due to his probation probably meant that he could not have Apparated there into the middle of the Highlands; that the tremor in his body was probably because he couldn’t cast a Warming Charm, and, back then, Harry hadn’t even spent a single thought to where Malfoy might live with both parents imprisoned and the Manor still confiscated.
I didn’t care a single Sickle though. I was only happy to see that his appetite had returned. We had a small, sweet moment when I noticed him Vanishing the crumbs off his jumper, and - you’ll never believe it – Draco actually blushed. Such an event is rarer than Hallie’s Comet passing in the sky. Even Draco’s ears turned pink. “You look great,” I told him. “I can’t get over how much healthier you look since November.”
There's still food in his mouth but, for the life of him, he simply cannot chew it. He presses it against his teeth, sickened by the texture. He’s sickened by himself, too.
Andi pressed my gifts onto me – new socks and a well-reviewed biography of Godric Gryffindor – and set about finishing dinner. It smelt delicious and my belly rumbled in appreciation. I’d spent the previous night with Ron and Hemione, and the three of us had slept in much too late to make anything serious for breakfast.
, Draco pointed out—starting a dance whenever the observer concentrates hard enough on the box. Or that’s what’s supposed to happen anyway, because only one of the figurines is actually moving, dancing all by herself with a heartbreakingly yearnful glance at her dance partner who doesn’t spring into his little charmed life.
Three days later Harry accompanied Draco once again, but this time it was to Harry’s workplace, to the grey offices of the DMLE.
Harry moaned, eyes glued on my own as I started jerking his pulsing prick, alternating between ghosting my fingertips over his prick and a tight grip that made Harry gasp every time. I went on, “You wouldn’t ever feel this aroused by someone else’s pleasure, would you? Gods, but you don’t know what you’re doing to me, Harry, when your prick is at full attention for me.”
Draco wrote about shoplifted potions, and he wrote about underage magic. He wrote about breaches of the Statute, and about the misuse of magical objects. None of the crimes that Draco wrote about would have gotten a person sentenced to Azkaban for longer than a month or so. Indeed, on most occasions the defendants didn’t seem particularly worried. All Draco had to do was sit at the back of the back of the courtroom, dressed in anonymous black robes and hide away.
With his eyes darkening and a smirk growing on his lips, Draco looked much more self-confident than at the beginning of their evening. “Toys? I wouldn’t have thought you to be so adventurous. Tell me about it.”
I pulled off my usual charms. I nibbled at his ear, dropped my voice lower and told him how handsome he was and that I wanted to suck his prick. James, however, seemed as nervous as he did at the start of our date. Which had me reconsidering the virgin theory.
“Don’t you swat me, beast,” Pansy cried out, her brown eyes shining with delight. “I think it has a nice ring to it, Draco Malfoy-Potter. Mmm. I can only imagine the number of parties that Potty and pals get invited to. I mean, you’ll have to make friendly with the gruesome-twosome that is Granger and Weasley, but that’s a small price to pay for getting to be tête-à-tête with the love of your life.” The witch leant forward in her chair, obviously seized by an idea. “I know! Invite Harry over here for dinner. Don’t worry about Nott here. I’ve ways and means of making him behave that would offend your delicate sensibilities, Draco. Don’t worry. I’ll have mummy’s elves cook up something delicious for the occasion.”
Harry had brought his broomstick to give Teddy a few little flying tips. The boy has hardly done anything else between the holidays, according to Aunty. I watched the two of them, sat under Andromeda’s thorough warming spells on the patio, drinking away my tea. I had ginger and lemon tea – Andi already started giving me quizzical looks, I ought to tell her soon.
“Well, but they are,” George chimes in, his eyebrows raised at his dad. “Their purchase is cheap because they usually use cheap wood. And often enough, it’s neither hand-carved nor are the charms applied very expertly. Quality does cost money sometimes, dad.”
—Draco can’t fight them. Too visceral are his affections for that gaunt git, whether he likes it or not.
One of these days, the perch will be inhabited by the actual phoenix that Draco managed to buy behind Harry’s back; they already visited her, but she will need to befriend them or else she will leave at the first best chance. Phoenixes bond rather strongly with the persons they stay with. It made Harry think about Fawkes and how he left after Dumbledore’s death.
The bite slips down his throat, slimy and slick. Draco pushes away Harry’s plate. Relief washes though him.
Put the journal aside for a while – we’re back in Shell Cottage now, and Harry helps with the cooking. My Gryffindor-comment from before had sparked a discussion about our sexual experiences, still sitting on the bench, but with some Cushioning Charms applied, and we both had to confess that we had left Hogwarts as virgins. Potter hadn't even considered that he was gay until he heavily crushed on a bloke who he got to know on his first ever vacation.
Harry has never seen such a bright, genuine smile on the other man’s face. “If you want to, you may call me Draco.”
“Alright,” Draco murmured, nodding his consent. He cast his eyes across at the Manor and looked at it a last time. “Let’s go.”
“There’s somebody here you’ll be very pleased to see,” Ginny hissed in a noisy stage whisper. “A certain wizard who
Potter said that he hadn’t ever known somebody as confident about sex as I am. He told me that Muggles have this thing called sex therapy, and I snorted at the idea that wizarding kind hadn’t come up with something like that.
“I hope,” Petunia Dursley speaks up, her mien solemn. “That you are at peace with yourself,” she says. Draco feels sick. “And that you don’t hold any grudges. You were a complicated boy. We were not prepared to deal with this, this-“
It’s bonkers, actually. Only a few days ago I was dreading tonight with a passion. Going to the Weasley’s bonfire and arranging my face into an acceptable smile didn’t feel at all appealing. Don’t get me wrong: I love Ron with all my heart. The wizard is literally my brother that I never had… But me living a life outside of his own conventional wife-and-baby existence with Hermione and Rose is too much of a leap.
Narrowing perfectly arched eyebrows, she slowly sipped her Manhattan with charmed cherry-red lips. “Harry Potter?” she repeated. “Considering that you’ve spent nearly half your life telling me about his dreamy green eyes and how pert his arse is, frankly, I’m stunned you’ve been able to keep this a secret. I’d have thought you’d have sent an owl winging its way over to me ten minutes after your first snog. You’re dating Harry Potter? Boy Who Lived and all around bothersome Griffindor git?”
will have a fucking field day with me… And that’s almost inevitable if I don’t plan on locking myself away for the remainder of the pregnancy. I told Harry that, and he looked rather conflicted about it all. I know for certain that he’s trying hard not to overstep, but I find myself pondering whether I ought to go to St Mungo’s just to make him happy. It’d be easier if he came along, but that would make it look like he’s the other father. I can’t, in good conscience, do that to him.
He thinks about Disapparating, but he doesn’t want to leave. He wants to get high with Draco and talk about fun stories and get to know about his childhood or his ex-husband or his favourite Muggle lyrics.
Draco’s palm is warm and steady on his back, unmoving, much like he doesn’t say anything for a while. When Harry finally musters up the courage to look up, their eyes lock onto each other’s. Draco gives him a reassuring smile, an almost unnoticeable upside-twist of his mouth corners.
“But of course.” Her voice sounds composed again. “As the last survivors of our respective lines, it’s a matter of decorum to support each other, Lord Malfoy. I shall hope that there’s a Lady Malfoy to be? You must be past the proper age to bond.”
“I mean in fifth year. There was this incident in the Ministry, in the Department of Mysteries,” Draco says. “Where you and . . . well, my father, too, tried to get your hands on your and You-Know-Who’s prophecy.”
“What?” Draco asks, smiling and playfully shoving at Harry. In lieu of replying, he only shoves back, steps heavy in the uneven sand, and they end up walking arms around each other. Harry presses a careful kiss to Draco’s burnt skin.
We talked about how utterly brilliant it was to see the plum. Neither of us mentioned anything about the Healer again. Instead, I looked down on my belly where Harry’s hand stroked me at an idle pace, and I felt tears well up again which, in turn, made Potter weep as well. We’re officially turning into Hufflepuffs, the both of us.
When he finds him, completely consumed by the music, Harry greets him by crashing into him in an accidentally too-forceful hug. Tarquin immediately pulls him into a toothy kiss, both of them more grinning against each other’s mouths than really kissing, but they end it abruptly, going back to moving to the beat, facing each other instead of dancing alone together now. They aren’t in a queer club, and they aren't looking for trouble. Harry is used to being subtle, or subtle enough until he’s behind closed doors.
And that, dear diary, is exactly what I’ve tried to do, in the weeks ever since. I’ve really worked hard to be a better man and go forward with a better attitude. Things between me and Draco aren’t perfect yet, but for the first time since I found Draco unconscious at the hotel, I can see a future where the two of us are a couple, bringing up our little plum together.
“Something worse is very accurate,” Draco answered, pouting. “Look at what you and the plum have done to my once-flawless stomach. A stretch mark! It’s unsightly, and I’m sure that a dozen more will wish to join the fray before I’m done.”
Judith's turns around in her armchair where she is texting on her phone, giving Nick a pointed lock. "Nah, absolutely not. I hate that shithole. It's just so-" she gestures vaguely with her free hand. "It's cold and ugly with all this . . . floor. Yeah, that's it- There are never enough people there for all that
The moment the door closed behind Ron and Hermione, both of them with a kid in their arms, Draco blurted out, “Harry, I want to fuck. Please.”
“I think Mrs Zabini was starting to tire of me anyway,” he said, his hands trembling around the mug. “The witch is exceedingly fond of younger men and though I’m not waving my own wand, I do believe that she had aims of adding me to her coterie of lovers. Of course, as the years have passed it became more and more obvious to all and sundry that my preferences lay with a different gender. The plum is absolutely the perfect excuse for her to get rid of me. Her elves found an empty phial of anti-nausea medicine in the bathroom bin, and she’s had her suspicions ever since. Merlin’s bloody eyes. She cast a
. Images claw their way to the surface. The sight of bloody, little hands and the smell of detergent. The dull sound of a pan connecting with the back of a head. Two small fingers trapped between the door and its wooden frame. The baying of both a dog and the terse snarls of the uncle. The sound means darkness and starving and the stale stench of urine.
On one wall, Harry finds a few photographs, and in a burst of bravery, he takes a close look at a brown-haired boy, grinning and waving both his arms at him, and he knows that there’s no way that it’s not Teddy Lupin. Harry’s mood doesn’t shift as harshly as he anticipated. Instead, he breathes calmly and moves his face even closer to watch the way Teddy’s eye colour changes while he waves his arms excitedly. From a deep warm brown to something pale. Harry wonders whether Draco took the photo and if Teddy‘s eyes match Draco’s in the end.
I feel so worthless. I owe him more and more – my life, my freedom, money, I’ll have a baby thanks to him! – while all I dare dream of is to be his equal.
Upstairs, Harry thinks about getting the kettle on, but he abstains, feeling like it’s not worth the effort. He looks out the kitchen window into the garden where some trees and shrubs are in bloom. He goes for a walk.
, and located his shoes. Draco’s home, Twenty-two St Swithins Crescent, wasn’t too far away and he walked, unaccosted, through the still-warm August night.
He tells Draco that when they visit Voldemort’s bedchamber which is lodged in a dark corridor with royal blue carpets leading the way.
Inspiration hit him. Draco tried to roll out from beneath the other wizard. If he could only get on top, then maybe he could switch things up a bit. Sex should be a pleasure and a joy, and right now, Draco felt like nothing better than a fuck toy. That wouldn’t do at all. He tried to writhe and fight out from beneath Fitzgerald’s grasp.
"Why would you think that?" I asked him, moving my arm a little on the backrest to touch his back. I love how he always leans into my touch.
“I just need a spot to eat,” Draco confessed, before admitting that his appetite had been up and down more often than a cursed broomstick. “Every single time is the same,” Draco said, as he slowly sipped a Butterbeer. “I think that I’m hungry, but then when the food is on the plate, the look of it makes me feel as sick as a Crup.” He frowned. “Likely it’s some awful germ I caught up in the Azkaban Hospital Wing, visiting my father. The cleanliness spells in that place are a thousand miles below par. It’s a wonder that
The two of them accidentally trapped a breeze inside the charms and it’s gently wafting about, occasionally catching in Harry’s hair. Sitting outside with the rather large family feels less crowded, the conversations freer. Teddy, Draco and Harry are sitting together at a round table with a multi-coloured tablecloth. Harry know he will never tire of the way Teddy seems to love Draco. He always seeks him out, engaging him into conversation instead of hanging around with the Weasley kids.
“Pansy is here,” Harry said, his voice clipped. “She says that she wants to talk to you, love. Says that she wants to meet Daisy. You don’t have to see her though. I can tell her to go, and I can change the Wards. I don’t want her ruining your first birthday with Daisy.”
They’re interrupted by a voice on top of the stairs. “Vernon, darling? Who is it?” Then a shriek, fear, panic. And the thoughts drift to a closing door, a crying child and the sound evokes disgust. A perfect family on the settee, watching the telly. Just as it ought to be. Disrupted by the intruder, asking for water because it’s too hot to pick weeds in the sun. And perhaps a plaster because his knee is bleeding and full of dirt, dirt that’s coming off the wobbly little knee and ruins the freshly cleaned carpet.
“Except that’s where you’re wrong Mr Malfoy,” the wizard answered, impassive and unimpressed. He picked up a quill, and fiddled with the feather, taking his sweet time before speaking again. “You, by yourself, won’t be anywhere
Draco grinned, and he swished his wand, charming their water to the perfect temperature and pressure.
Draco squats back down to plant the final two garlic bulbs. “Have you ever been to a Samhain bonfire? You were raised Muggle, right?”
Sometimes I’ve fucked into Draco’s new, plushy arse cheeks, my hands gripping his belly as I buried myself, deep as I could.
and his alone. A sadness seizes Harry deep inside, one which he doesn’t fully understand but lets his head spin to all sorts of things that used to belong to him or perhaps still do. The Invisibility Cloak, a few things safely stored away in his mokeskin pouch, Grimmauld Place-
The next website was better. The men were all very sexy and most looked to be about my age on the tiny thumbnail pictures. I made the decision to sign up, using the name James Evans. It wasn’t really a fake name, I decided. It was simply an added layer of protection.
for his authentication. When he looks into the mirror this time, he sees a grinning Harry with green eyes and a carded-back fringe. He does 2 milligrams and casts the glamour and a Notice Me Not, feeling exuberant and delighted that nothing was amiss, that they just wanted to check back with him about several vast amounts of money that had left his vault. Now he’s a free man, ready to leave without any consequences from his delay.
“You sure you don’t want to spend the night in your bed? Have a nice tea, watch some telly, catch up on some sleep?”
“Firewhisky?” Harry asked, nodding to the glass. “I wouldn’t have thought you’d be a whisky drinker. I’d have had you down for drinking Champagne or a glass of expensive plonk in some posh wine bar, not getting sloshed with the plebs.”
Malfoy rushes out of the kitchen, down the corridor towards the guest room in which Harry was meant to sleep last night before doing the few grams of cocaine he had on him, and venturing about to find Malfoy’s bedroom, crashing on the cold side of his double bed. There is the sound of a door opening and closing, muffled footsteps receding down a staircase.
Unable to speak, I nodded my agreement. I gave the coin a tap with my wand. I’d cast a clever bit of magic onto it, stolen from Hermione, and I felt myself flung through space immediately.
His new life as a Wizengamot court reporter began that same afternoon. Every day was as humdrum, and foreseeable as the one before it, and that suited Draco perfectly. Each day was a parade of the same petty crimes and misdemeanours.
“It really wasn’t that bad,” Harry reassures him, not sure whether it’s true. But it doesn’t matter when Draco nods—maybe agreeing to the broom ride, maybe letting go of the rotten words they had for each other a few hours ago,—his eyes endlessly fond in the dim light, and Harry falls in love anew. The feeling perfuses his whole body, rendering his features earnest and his heartbeat skittish and fluttery like a young bird’s first flight as they kiss under starless skies like it was the first and the last time.
Well, but when I saw Harry this time, he was polishing a finished broomstick to perfection, and I managed to watch him do it without any innuendos.
Draco chortled at the cheesy chat up line, but he felt complimented nevertheless. He could smell the posh scent of Fitzgerald’s aftershave, and his muscles beneath his palms were as hard as iron. Bloody hell, but Draco was half-erect already. He hadn’t wanted a man as much as this in quite a while.
The music box turned into his own little project. The charms were perfectly in place—the third time Harry held the thing in hand, he discovered that there was a pearl stuck in the mechanism which put the whole thing out of operation. But what he does is clean, and polish, and paint the whole thing back into a state of splendid, untouched beauty, or that’s what he tries.
They climb up a set of stairs and another door leads into the hallway that Harry recognizes from the last time at Malfoy’s place. There is the door to the bathroom and to the guest room and off to the side, there’s another set of stairs that would bring them to Malfoy’s bedroom.
, Carol means that she researched his name within all the peerage and gentry records she could get her hands on.
So, this is the story as it currently stands. Mrs Zabini cottoned on very quickly to Draco’s expectant state. The older woman’s senses are very attuned to the magic of the people surrounding her – I think she may have some degree of Veela inheritance – and she very quickly turned against Draco. I don’t doubt it would have been a different issue had he been courting, and worn a handsome diamond on his finger, but he could neither name the other father, nor explain the circumstances of his pregnancy.
When Draco’s breathing changes again, and his moans suddenly quiet into a concentrated silence, Harry feels his muscles clench around him. He pulls Draco up on his knees, still impaling him with his cock, and he loops his hand around Draco’s hips to jerk him through his orgasm in quick, forceful movements. Draco seizes his arm tightly, hips jerking back against Harry’s cock and forth into his fist. “Keep going,” he pleads, and Harry tries his best to comply and concentrate on moving hands and hips, pushing deeper into Draco because Draco’s back arches beautifully when he does, and then Draco freezes. His twitching prick and arsehole are the only things in motion about Draco while he comes in hot streaks over Harry’s hands.
Harry listened intently, and I was tempted to go into all the details, but I broke it down to, “Yes, I’m safe, and I’m taking care of us.”
“Er- I’m not-” Harry realises that he has hardly had anything all day. “We should eat something, right?”
After that a myriad of questions followed. How long have you known, what have you been eating, have you taken vitamins, do you get enough sleep, and so on and so forth. I didn’t even need to ask for her to tell me about the teas that helped her when she was pregnant with me, and how ginger had made her feel less nauseous.
Draco wasn’t sure why he’d decided to make an official complaint, only that he was ready to. More than that, he wanted to. Draco was angry. He was furious.
“Of course.” When Harry glimpses at Draco, he averts his gaze, narrowing his eyes against the afternoon sun despite sitting in the shaded area. He wears a long-sleeved shirt, the navy blue almost black in the shadows, and in his hands, he shelters a glass of water, periodically, almost dutifully taking a few sips.
“I’ll look forward to it,” Draco answered, his voice shot through with confidence, not dropping Fitzgerald’s eyes for an instant.
Potter had put a hand on my growing bump before (not without asking, polite lad that he is), but he put his hands under my shirt when we were back home, and I really, really should stop thinking about that if I don’t intend to wank after ending this journal entry. It felt so, so good, even under Granger’s scrutiny. I hope that we will try that again sometime soon…
) but what else can I possibly do? I can’t force him to visit a Healer, even though my natural inclination is to Side-Along him there and demand that he be examined.
The two of them kissed soundly and the rest of the world fell away. They could have been the only two wizards on the face of the earth. They were interrupted by the delicate cough of an Elf-Waiter. “It is time for the mains to be served,” he said, eyes twinkling. “And may I present a bottle of Elven Champagne, compliments of The Chimaera’s Den. We wish you every happiness.”
Harry nods. He fancies that he sees Draco’s expression change, that he sees the way the idea seizes him with a bleak gravity. After a breath, it’s straightened out of the set of his shoulders and from his features. "I'm not talking about life plans though,” Draco says, levelled. “I mean
,” Malfoy draws the word out in a long syllable, pursing his lips. “You obviously were out of your mind, Potter. Very far out.”
There wasn’t much to be said after that. Draco made his excuses not long afterwards, and Flooed back to St Swithins Crescent. That night he took a double dose of sleeping elixir and wished, fervently, that he might never wake up.
“Gods, but you are so infuriatingly decent," Draco answered, sliding the slippery cheek of his backside against my prick. “It’s fine,” Draco assured me “The only thing I want to do in bed is sleep. Right now? I’m enjoying myself. I've been so randy for you for days.”
“Well, obviously,” Malfoy says, incredulous. He sounds very much the same, his posh voice raising an annoyingly haughty, judgmental air of self-importance about him that, ludicrously, makes Harry feel insecure, however less spiteful this almost thirty-years-old version of Malfoy is. Which might have to do with the fact that they are not insulting each other at the moment but rather have taken mephedrone together. Harry would have taken him for the cocaine type if anything But then he would have taken Malfoy to be exactly the kind of poser that goes to parties with a huge, fancy coke buffet, pretending to be all important and sophisticated, on first-name basis with all the beautiful people,
In a few days the Muggles will be celebrating Bonfire Night. The sky will fill with sparkling lights and dense smoky scent will fill the air. It’s always been a busy week on Diagon. Wizards take the opportunity to set off a few fireworks of their own, not worrying for once that they’ll be breaking the Statute and telling the Muggles about their existence. I’m invited to the Weasleys, as per the usual.
down on the kitchen table and smooths his hand over the paper, feeling the odd texture of the ink under his calloused fingertips. Draco had his elbow on the table, his head propped on his knuckles. He watches Harry apprehensively.
“Forgot that we’re wizards?” Draco says, running a tender hand through Harry’s hair, fixing his fringe by sweeping it backwards.
“Owl me the details,” Harry said as he pushed his glass away and stood up, straightened his clothes, and adjusted himself. “And I’ll meet you there. Don't worry, I won't be late.” He leant over and gave Draco’s bicep the briefest and most gentle of squeezes. “And don’t look so gloomy! I know it’s only make-believe. I won't try snogging you in the kitchen.”
Salazar, my nausea is starting to get rather appalling. I’ve lost a few pounds and my chest is already looking way too skinny. It can hardly be entirely stress- and anxiety-related.
The cold of night clutches his club-damp skin, and Harry gives an uninvited shiver before having more whisky and leaving the club to an almost silent street, closed in by tall buildings and tiring gold-glowing streetlights.
Would he enjoy Quidditch with Greg perhaps? Some physical activity would do them both good. But being friends with Greg is an… acquired taste.
Harry shifts closer in response, finding the same position as before with his head tucked under Draco’s chin, arms wrapped around each other’s bodies, and he revels in the odd safety he feels, wondering how another man’s chest can make him feel that rather than turned on. For a fraction of a second, Tarquin springs into his mind, and how lazing in bed together felt similar to this moment. Different though. Tarquin never faced the weight of any knowledge about his past.
Harry kisses down towards Draco’s neck and his clavicles, sucking at a few spots of the pristine skin which evokes a soft chuckle from Draco. He lets himself slide down on his knees, past all the lines and past the remnants of the Dark Mark which he spots in his peripheral vision. He concentrates on undoing the buttons and the fly on Draco’s trousers, only feeling that he knows what he’s doing when Draco’s tented bulge is in view, covered only by the sleek fabric of his thin boxer shorts.
“Harry!” Draco said, turning to face me, his voice full of dismay. “You got me in this condition, Harry, so really you ought to be a
Caught up in the moment, I wiped away that one tear from Potter’s cheek that had escaped his eyes. He looked at me with that intense gaze of his and for a moment, I thought he wanted to kiss me. It would have been so easy to just close that distance between us. I could even have argued that I was out of my mind. I should kiss him and tell him it’s my hormones acting up. Let’s see whether I gather the courage.
I dared to hold James closer and after two or three songs, I suggested taking our evening upstairs into our room. This was mainly because of my odd desire to kiss him, but also because I'd grown more and more curious about what we’d do together. I still believed that he might have had some sort of surprise in petto, and I finally wanted to know what his deal was.
“I’m good,” Draco says casually, and then he promptly draws his wand and summons a bottle of Hendrick’s Gin and two bulbous glasses to the table. With another waft of magic, the glasses suck the clear liquid from the black bottle. An ice cube added to the glass emits a dulcet succession of chimes. “Lemon, cucumber, thyme?”
The beginning that I’m going to talk about was two weeks ago. Draco came to visit Phoenix, wanting to spend time with me, a prospect that pleased me no end. In fact, had he not come when he did, I would have been ready to knock on Lady Zabini’s door and enquire after Draco’s person. I had gotten genuinely concerned that my friend had succumbed to some dreadful malady, one that he didn’t want to tell anyone about. Either that, or the single kiss that we shared was so awful that Draco never wanted to lay eyes on me again. Luckily, that didn’t seem to be the case.
Draco liked my answer. He brought a hand up to brush my untidy fringe away, and then he closed the space between us, pressing a kiss onto my forehead. “I still need my shower,” Draco said. “Care to join me?”
When they run into each other the second time, Harry has a Muggle mobile, and the first thing he does is exchange numbers with John. Then they try to find beanie-bloke somewhere close to the bar. They leave the ear-splitting dance floor to stand in the hallway close to the cloakroom where it’s easier to understand each other. They are trying to be fugitive with their smokes, and the hip flask beanie-bloke—Tarquin—bootlegged into the club. On that night, Harry learns that his last blackout wasn’t only from too much alcohol, but rather from mixing said alcohol with mollies. Harry concludes that this must be some kind of drug, but he has no clue about what they might consist of.
Fitzgerald pushed inside of him and after that, Draco didn’t speak anymore. He didn’t want to fight, and he didn’t want to move. Draco let his body go limp as Fitzgerald pounded into him, let his own consciousness drift around the room like a spectre.
“The Samhain bonfires will be held next week,” Draco says, and Harry’s heartbeat quickens, “and I thought we could go. I usually . . .” Draco stands and spells his hands clean with a quick waft of magic. He looks at Harry appraisingly for a moment, before pulling him him closer, crossing his arms in the small of his back and locking eyes on eyes. “I usually go with Aunt Andromeda. And I'm sure she’d be delighted to see you.”
Reality dawned on me, and I felt the tick of my pulse start to pick up. The idea had occurred to me the month before, and I’d paid off the small debt with a Gringotts transfer. It’d taken me less than a morning to complete, and I’d immediately forgotten about it afterwards.
Draco stopped visiting the pub with his colleagues on a Friday. He stopped eating his lunches in the
That evening, Draco examined himself in his bedroom before getting into his bed. He frowned at his reflection, disgusted with the hardly-there swell of his belly below his navel.
“You should do it,” Harry said when I questioned the lack of such a thing, recalling the ignorance of that first Mediwizard I had seen in St Mungo’s in February. “You’d be a brilliant sex coach or whatever it is that they do exactly.”
Harry laughed rather heartily at that, and he commented, “You can be the judge of that when the plum arrives. You haven’t seen Teds before he was a crafty little toddler. I have an inkling that you’re about to change your mind in just a few months’ time.”
The wizard nodded. “As you like,” Tom responded, bringing over the Ogden’s bottle and placing it with a firm click on the bar alongside a fresh glass. “Pace yourselves fellas,” Tom warned and Harry nodded his agreement.
Harry agrees and continues scrutinising the antique, following Draco’s instructions to make himself familiar with it before he tries even one spell on it.
With a groan, Harry sinks deeper into the settee and concentrates on the sounds against the windows, watching the clouds rush past.
Was Draco offended? Did the group of us come across as sneering fools? I imagine that we might have. Sex work is Draco’s secret, kept a million miles away from the wizarding world. What were the chances of another gay wizard sifting through his website, looking for a date? Draco must have figured they would be miniscule.
“This is bloody brilliant,” Harry says in lack of a better word, staring in wonder as the parchment starts extending itself on the sides in order to portrait every family member. Casting his eyes back to Andromeda, Harry notes that most other Blacks and Malfoys have a small symbol next to them, an S, but Andromeda doesn’t. “What’s the S mean?”
Hermione who is dressed in navy-blue Ministry robes, her hair shorter than she used to wear it but just as curly, her eyes brown and warm like a doe’s but also almost too sharp and wise for her age. Familiar like the back of his hand.
When Harry wakes sometime before the morning is greying, his stomach and his thoughts are a mess. Their little after-sex conversation pops up in his mind instantaneously; perhaps he’s been dreaming about it. His heart beats away in a stampede of panic as he looks at Draco beside him. But Harry drapes his arm over Draco’s back instead of running away. He tries with logic, arguing with himself that he doesn’t really live anywhere because a hotel suite where he's partied so hard several times that he had to refurnish two rooms once- that can hardly count as a home.
This year’s birthday is hardly different from others. He had hid away at home for the last two weeks, avoiding company like Dragon Pox. On the very day of his birthday, however, not even Draco lets him spend the day secluded. Instead, he’s served a huge pile of pancakes and is then shoved into the shower whilst he hears Draco rummaging through their bedroom.
I didn’t have a clue what Draco was talking about. I placed my book on the table, and I tried my damnedest to answer him. I couldn’t though. Not knowing what I was being accused of, I couldn’t form a reply. All I could do was shake my head, but that seemed to enrage Draco ever more. He grabbed hold of the edge of the table, the knuckles of his hands white and strained.
Harry is starting to ponder whether to ask someone despite his trepidations or simply Disapparate when he finds it; an unobtrusive sign that reads
Daisy was content and cuddly, fast asleep in his arms, and the wizard didn’t think anything of it when he heard the Floo chime inside of the house. It was probably Teddy. The little wizard adored Daisy, and he’d likely fussed Andi into letting him come over early. Well, that didn't matter. Teddy could help Harry in the kitchen and then they could break open and share the box of Cauldron Cakes.
This meal had been a sham and a fabrication, and seemed to be growing bigger and more monstrous with every second. Not even a scrap of Draco’s pride remained, but, at least, he could cut his losses. With any luck he’d be able to show his face again in a decade or so.
, pliable and responsive to his touch. Harry’s eyelids stay closed to savour the feeling of the touch and the humid heat of their mouths. But when he blinks, an odd, numbed realisation dawns in him that it is indeed Draco Malfoy he’s kissing, and it’s both funny and just-
Draco gives a small laugh. “Potter, we already started making this our home. We’ve hardly done anything else the past few weeks.”
When the leaves change colour and start to fall from the maple tree in the back garden, a beautiful red through the browns and greys of mid-October through the kitchen window, Harry brings himself to say, “I’ll pay the suite today and check out,” to which Draco nods over his tea, sucking in his lips. He’s wearing that expression that tells Harry if he speaks, it'll sound rushed and nervous. But just before Draco tries to find his voice, just before Harry Disapparates, Harry pushes Draco up against the wall in the hallway and kisses him, rough and thorough.
Poor Draco was suffering a little, though, and wasn't having the most wonderful time. I noticed that he wasn’t eating much of the cherry and cloudberry ice-cream that he normally craves. His lower back was knotty and achingly painful, and even though we took several turns around the garden, nothing alleviated it.
I started writing not long after that because I was far too excited to sleep. If this is my second chance, then I won’t make any mistakes this time. I'm going to do my best. Draco and the plum are my family, and come what may, I want them to be a part of my life. I’ll do whatever it takes to make things right with Draco.
I should stop rambling. My little plum is making themselves seen and I shall tell friends and family soon enough. Seeing Harry every other day is giving me the necessary strength.
But how beautiful it was. Perhaps only because, at the time, Harry couldn’t remember the last time that he was just stood there without a place to be, without a quest to fulfil. Just gazing up into the stars, the all-encompassing nothingness with its drawing pretence of immobility spanning above them, around them once they left the dim-lit cobble streets. He remembers thinking how different the actual sky looked from the charmed ceiling in the Great Hall, naught but a snippet, a mockery of framing something that’s meant to be infinite.
When they are seated at the table, Malfoy’s fancy china gets to work brewing tea and pouring it, offering Harry a variety of different sugars and milk and cream which he all denies. It feels unfamiliar to interact with charmed teapots or charmed
that Draco knows what he’s doing. Harry can’t imagine how he got here, and even more to the point, how Malfoy got here, consuming Muggle drugs in a not-cosy-but-not-overtly-posh living room. Harry would like to know how Draco came to know how to do that, how he got his hands on them in the first place, legal drug or not.
“I won’t be able to keep your secret Mr Potter,” he said curtly. “Witches and wizards swear the Hippocratic Oath, exactly the same as Muggle doctors.
Draco rolled his eyes at me, his cheeks pink. “It’s hardly fair,” he groused in my direction, “I’ve rubbed a skin hydration potion all over myself, long before I began to show. I’ve drank plenty of water and taken excellent care of myself. I suppose that there’ll be many more where that came from before the plum arrives. My torso will be perfectly
Draco is visibly pregnant now, and so the sight of him elicits gossip everywhere he goes. It’s easier for him to Apparate whenever he meets clients and to spend the rest of his time lazing inside the library and the gardens of Grimmauld Place. That’s usually where I find him, napping or leafing through some ancient spell book. Of course, the moment that I see him, I can’t resist him. I wrap my hands around his middle, feeling for the swell of his belly and his smooth, silky skin beneath my palm.
A flash and rude words. Make-up sex in the spa of a fancy hotel and another round in an alley, nothing but Harry’s pale arse bared for me to claim, and I recognise the area as the one close to Teddy’s university.
In the kitchen Harry finds the bloke whose name was John, brooding over a newspaper, but smiling amiably when Harry comes in. He gets coffee and even a sandwich, is offered an aspirin, and Harry feels a bit like John might actually be a wizard and very well aware of who he was talking to, courteous as he is.
The rest of his friendships had collapsed like a house of cards. It was hard, Draco supposed, to maintain attachments when you felt anxious about leaving the house. There were so many places that Draco couldn’t go anymore. Not to Diagon Alley, or to the pub, or to watch Quidditch. Fitzgerald might have been lurking those places, so Draco couldn’t visit any of them. Greg and Cormac had visited, and they had sent owls, but Draco’s increasingly petulant refusals had put them off. The invites had lessened, and then they had stopped entirely.
“Perfect bloody Potter,” Draco spat out, his eyes wide and a red flush on his cheeks. “Saint Potter! You really think you’re a cut above the rest of us, don’t you? You think you’re a cut above me, think you’re better than the filthy vessel that you conned into carrying your spawn. I- I…"
Narcissa flicked her eyes to the photograph that lay between them and then brought them back up to Draco’s own. “I don’t believe that,” she said. “This child wouldn’t be- they wouldn’t
As summer slipped into Autumn, the idea of remaining a Quidditch journalist became increasingly untenable to Draco.
“Oh,” Harry says again, this time with a huge grin plastered across his face. “I had no idea that gays could marry
I have no idea how much time had passed when I heard Harry’s steps on the stairs and his knock a moment later.
There was only one thing to do in situations as dire as this one, and that was get drunk. Perhaps once he’d swallowed a few shots of Ogden’s Finest he’d be able to Floo back to Parkinson and announce that it'd been some sort of lark. A practical joke to keep the lovebirds on their toes.
Harry took a sip from his glass, his eyes impossibly gentle. “That doesn’t sound too terrible,” Harry answered. “Seems to me that if these two people care as much about you as you do about them, then they won’t make you feel that bad about the whole thing.” He shrugged. “Well, that’s what
That was until Harry heard the door click shut, the one he deliberately left open, knowing full well that Draco had probably entered without Harry noticing, and sneaked right back out again. Which now marked the third time during the last few weeks that he’s been caught.
which might be those puppy eyes of yours. There’s an innocent sadness in them. And the way you hold yourself—world-weary and hopeful all the same. You’d sell like-” she snaps her fingers, “hot cakes, hun.”
Draco uses a house-elf service that comes to clean the house once a week. He learnt how to cook in the Netherlands together with his then-husband—Ambroos, a half-blood wizard who, on pictures, has a friendly round face, a brown beard and fancy-looking brand-name clothes—who, one year, nursed the idea of growing vegetables in the shared garden behind their apartment building and eat nothing but home-cooked meals. It’s a habit that Draco is happy to keep and for Harry, that means stir-fries every day of the week now, and he even starts helping out by slicing the vegetables which, Draco insists, is better done by hand, just like it’s the way with potion ingredients.
They end up writing a short letter in which Harry apologises for being absent. He asks a few questions about school and Quidditch, and he also tells Teddy that, if he liked, they could see each other in his Christmas holidays.
he is, and maybe Malfoy cursed him into another dimension or made him the prisoner of his own imagination or-
Teddy was bewildered, but he was far too interested in eating to delve into Draco’s words. Andi cautiously changed the subject, talking about the Ministry, and how it was high time that the various elf reforms they were debating were passed. I tuned out. Hermione was the driving force behind these new laws, and though I approved of them wholeheartedly, I’d already repeatedly heard about them in forensic detail. All I could bring myself to do was puzzle over Draco’s enigmatic words. I wished, fervently, that he’d confide in me.
. There’s this heartfelt rock-ballad that Harry fancies to recall as a song that used to play on the Muggle radio when he was a child. And as he watches Tarquin and John croon along with abandon, he could cry from the odd mix of emotions that stir inside his chest. For a second, Harry is astonished about feeling so overwhelmed, thinking that he hasn’t felt anything at all in quite some time without realising it—okay, he thought about it, but he didn’t
“It’s stigmatised,” Draco agrees, pensive. Then his head perks up. “But I think I’ve seen Amanda Parker tonight.”
Daisy had been kind enough to give the two of them a morning lay-in, and Harry had gifted Draco a box of his favourite Cauldron Cakes and a gorgeous new jumper. Draco had beamed, delighted with his treat, and he pulled it straight over his head.
“Ready for this?” I asked Draco, trying to elicit a smile from his beautiful, nervous face. “You’re going to see the plum! This is a good day! It’s exciting.” There was so much more I wanted to add. I wanted to tell Draco how proud I was of him, and how well he was looking after my baby – how well he was looking after our baby – but I didn’t dare.
I laid him on his back and felt up his crotch, his tightened balls. “Look at you,” I said, opening his fly and starting to undress him. “Look how hard you’ve gotten for me. For my pleasure. How good you feel for making me feel good.”
Draco didn’t object to my intimacy, and he moved his hand so that it rested on top of my own. Together we felt the small shifting movements of our plum, their movements obvious under the tight skin of Draco’s bump. I didn’t speak, and I hardly dared to breathe. Draco hadn’t been this free with me in weeks, and I didn’t want to say or do the wrong thing. Draco says that the plum is most active when the two of us are standing close. I curled my palm around the swell.
“Shut it, you idiot,” Draco says, affectionately. He wrenched himself free only to get both his hands on Harry’s face again. He gives Harry a kiss before he tilts Harry’s face in all directions to assess his work. “Love you too,” he says, low and concentrated.
"Right." His brows are furrowed and for a moment, he looks down into his tea. While he takes out the mesh strainer, darkened with the black leaves, he asks, "What do you
“My Saviour,” Draco whispered. “There’s never been a man as good to me as you are, Harry. Sometimes I think I could tell you anything, and you wouldn’t judge me.”
feels special to him. When he lies in bed at night, reading one of Draco’s Muggle novels about a group of boys who survive a plane crash and form a democracy on a secluded island, Harry thinks that this will be the rest of his life. Be with Draco, mend a thing or two, and see a friend every once in a while- it sounds underwhelming when he tries to see it from a distance. But love fills his every fibre, occupies his every thought. It doesn’t feel like there’s room for anything else but Draco. If there’s such a thing as true love, whatever that might exactly entail, Harry has found his.
When Harry Apparates back home, he makes his way downstairs towards the atelier, giddy with excitement that he can’t wait to share with Draco because his appointment is over and it wasn’t nearly as bad as he had thought. But on the bottom of the staircase, hand on the handle of the door, he hears Draco’s voice and stops dead in his tracks because it means there’s a customer.
His fingers are pinching the key, tucked into the lock to their apartment building. It’s tall and nondescript, flats occupied by students of this medium sized university town in Sweden. It’s busy, sometimes loud, and both blissfully anonymous and friendly greetings in the corridor all at once.
Draco walked out then, and the silence that he left in his wake was more deafening than his shouting or the sound of the plate breaking. The pain of knowing that Draco would leave, if he only could, is exquisitely sharp.
.” The laughter might as well be a sob, but it sounds so heartfelt that something in Harry’s chest clenches.
I didn’t though. I was fascinated by what I’d discovered. Draco says that he is a man of leisure, who spends his days reading novels and listening to the wireless in his suite in the Zabini Estate. Draco was a sex worker? I wanted to be shocked, but I wasn’t. My friend always has money and is always willing to stand you for a drink. He wasn’t reduced by this work. If anything, the Draco I knew was thriving.
When Draco goes on explaining how, precisely, charms are embedded into woods and metals, and what a huge difference such materials make—
It was Muggle, one of Teddy’s hand-downs with illustrations of different types of vehicles. She looked into the opened book, studying the thick cardboard page intently, before she turned around and toddled over to her dad, bright eyes still glued on the page. She fell along the way, causing Draco to jolt, but Daisy was completely unimpressed by his panic, and just got back up to continue the last steps of her little journey.
Andromeda’s home is similar enough that Harry recognises the drawing room, but the seating has changed and there’s a wall with a multitude of picture frames hanging upon it. Many of them depict Teddy, some of them show Tonks and Remus, others are with Draco. On three of them Harry finds himself with shorter hair, looking oddly young.
And in this case, it’s hard to tell. If looks are anything to go by, Draco does look a lot like he used to, back at  school. He’s still ridiculously young in appearance, eyes, skin, and hair pale against his black clothes; if Harry didn’t know that they are born the same year, he would guess that he has a couple years on Draco. His shoulders are broad and taper down to his narrow waist and hips, incredibly skinny in tight jeans. Does he look or dress or talk like he could be gay? Harry can’t tell. But in his experience, most disinterested would have firmly, politely lost the touch had he laid a hand on their shoulder.
Draco’s breathing changes, and Harry wants to prolong this pause they have, so Draco would have a moment to adjust to the feeling. But the wizard gets down on his arms and knees again, moving his arse back against Harry, spurring him on to keep going. Harry rocks his hips in short movements, feeling himself get deeper and deeper behind the tight ring of muscles with each careful thrust. They angle their hips, their legs until it’s
Draco swallows hard, his eyes travel up to the ceiling as he lies there beneath Harry, looking a bit like he’s under medical examination. “That’s very intimate,” Draco says. “To know that you cast such powerful spells with my wand.”
—Harry thinks that he'd like to listen to him forever. He can’t help but compare the Draco he gets to know now to the Malfoy he used to know and again, he wonders whether Draco had had such vivid interests, such a vivid personality, back in the war or whether that facet had thrived only after, perhaps
That’s the reason I Polyjuiced my face with an illegal extra-strength potion that I brought under the counter in Knockturn Alley, and the reason that I stole hair from the coat of a good-looking Muggle in the supermarket. I so very much wanted to fuck Drake the rent boy but not enough to lose the fond affection of Draco Malfoy.
But Potter is almost convincing with his fervent gazes and appreciative words. I know that he thinks I’m the hottest thing in the universe while I’m pregnant with his child. I’d love to hear all the racy things on his mind whenever he looks at me, completely unfiltered.
When we were still in his office, smiling at the picture we got of our perfect baby, I fibbed, “Another mark you leave on me, Potter. Curse scars, stretch marks, surgical scars – I must hope you’re quite done now.”
“It was two months after that,” Harry says. The sun is setting, reminding Harry how short the days are getting. The sun rises outside the bedroom window, leaving the room dark and blue even earlier in the afternoon. Draco is a shadow against the headboard of the bed, occasionally making little noises while Harry talks, gravely saddened
The bass pulses through the ceiling in a low thrum. The terrace is deserted to the late November rain. The city in front of him is too-stark contrasts; wet-black asphalt and dazzling yellow lights. Harry finds himself unable to move as his gaze drifts across the city.
is paying for and where he can’t be left the fuck alone when he’s retching into the toilet. Maybe new people would be more like the friends he used to have, all of which turned his back on him, those bloody fuckers. Perhaps he’d meet someone to save him from this misery. Someone who’s bloody brilliant to talk to and fun to be around. And if not that, he’ll at least have a good high, music pulsing through his body, feeling tenfold as meaningful and relatable, rendering him a responsive and gentle person; someone with emotions and appropriate reaction, someone who’s laughing, laughing, laughing, like he ought to instead of being this pathetic excuse of a human being.
That night was as much of an emotional rollercoaster as the night of the battle. He’d come to leave and leave he did, only that he became
“I’m not so sure,” George says. “It’s the same cock-up with many joke items. I tried ordering from China once. Was a good deal
“Wait,” Malfoy says, rushed. “I . . . Well, I have something for you. Wait a second. Just- I’ll be back in a minute.”
He had a definite and very fixed plan of how he was going to spend the rest of his Sunday. Draco intended to eat his body weight in Salt ‘n’ Vinegar crisps, Chocolate Frogs and Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream and cry whilst pretending to watch films on his Muggle television. The whole endeavour would ruin his complexion and make him feel as sick as Crup, but Draco simply didn’t care. He didn’t intend ever to leave his home, not ever again, so he could be as ugly as sin, and it wouldn’t matter a whit.
Another laugh. “Well, yes, but I meant that day in particular. When you came back at five in the morning with the words,
Potter’s owls kept tapping on Draco’s window with notes asking him to drink awful tea in Muggle establishments. The two of them went for walks around Muggle parks, and gazed at the Christmas lights hung up in their high streets. Draco never spoke much on their outings, and Harry didn’t push him. Instead, Harry would tell tedious stories of the bike rides that he and Teddy had taken, or the criminal cases he was investigating, and Draco would listen.
“You are?” Hermione asks, but somehow Harry can’t shake the feeling that she already knew. “How did that happen?” And Harry goes on to explain, realising that he has never actually told Hermione that he likes men because, back in the day, he was too afraid that she’d judge his weekend-escapades. Because, back then, sex was something that only happened drunk and, more often than not, not even in a bed.
“Time to go, I believe,” Draco responded hastily. “Mother will have my hide if I’m late for her soirée. You know how she gets, Pans. There’d be Howlers flying down the chimney before we knew where we were.”
I’ve got a lot to tell you, and I’m a little – maybe quite a lot – pissed, so I’m going to jot as much as I can down before I hit my sheets. To tell the truth, the room is swaying a little. Mixing my potent fruit punch with Ron’s Firewhiskey was never going to be one of my more brilliant ideas.
It was time to be the brave Gryffindor that I’m supposed to be, and so I gathered together all the rough ends of my courage. “That’s the night of the Weasley bonfire,” I said, “but I’d love it if you were there, Draco. It’s a proper giggle. Booze, fireworks, and all the food you can eat.”
Harry sucks in a breath at the sudden sensation of Draco, clasping his prick and giving him a few tugs. He pulls Draco close, licking over his lips when they part for him and into the heat of his mouth, feeling smooth teeth and soft lips and the wet of his tongue. Harry can’t help but moan into the kiss, and Draco’s grip on his prick seizes tighter in response, his strokes quicker before the touch suddenly leaves Harry. Draco’s arms wrap around his body, and he rolls Harry over to lie on his back, deepening the kiss by pushing his tongue into Harry’s mouth, who can’t do much but surrender to him. Kissing Draco feels nice, much nicer than with most people. It feels like Draco powers all his being into it, rendering Harry breathless and very much mesmerised.
“Yes, finally,” Draco agreed. He wiggled his hand free and moved it up Harry’s arm until it rested on his shoulders. Gently, he started to rub away a few knots that had tensed up there sometime during the day.
Pansy raised a perfect eyebrow, and sat forward in her seat. “And that, by itself, hardly warrants the
On the bright side, reading Harry’s words has opened my eyes. I did assume that Harry had some issues with his self-esteem but reading all these thoughts… Especially about the bloke he Polyjuiced himself into.
I set to work. My first choice was Brian, but he was covered in freckles. I clicked off his profile. Freckles remind me of Weasleys, so I knew I’d never be able to relax. My second choice was a man called Eric. He was dark haired, but a little too muscular for my taste. He was altogether too much like the bodybuilders down at the gym that I avoid like Spattergroit. Clicking off Eric, I scrolled downward.
But I know how to cast that blasted charm! I watched Pansy and Daphne practise it a gazillion times back at Hogwarts, and I even watched when they taught Astoria. Circe, I had to cast it with them because they are an impossible bunch of witches, insisting that I’d never know when I’d finally decide to lay aside my pureblood conservatism!
It was true. Draco felt shamefaced but he still took Harry’s wand from him. He made him sleep above the quilt as well. Just like he’d promised, Harry never touched him. Harry snored, and he mumbled in his sleep, but he never betrayed his promise.
Hermione whispers something into Ron’s ear, and he looks over to Harry then, giving him a smile as well. Harry thinks that he looks so happy. His eyes gleam and his cheeks are a scarlet colour. When he looks away, he loops his arm around Hermione. Rose is playing with something on the ground. Fleur and Percy’s wife sit with her, limbs and toys sprawled across the busy pattern of the brown carpet. Molly watches them from her wingback chair, a somewhat wistful smile on her face.
It was one of these moments in which I realised that I would be thinking about these things and ideals not only on behalf of my cousin but for my very own child as well if things turn out as well as I hope. So I found myself agreeing with him. Wholeheartedly. Last year, I was one of those who packed heaps of sweets and books, some of which Teddy was possibly way too young to read. Thanks to Andi and Harry, Teddy will hardly be raised as a spoiled child, but I need to be better with these things. I’ll have to make up my mind about the implications these small acts have in the long run of bringing up a human being.
, then she pressed the book into Draco’s hands, her brown eyes expectant and curious. “Do you want me to read to you, Daisy?” Draco asked her, and she nodded with a happy gurgle. But despite her nod, Daisy took the book back from her dad and toddled back to the shelf with it. Draco and Harry both chuckled at the sight of her concentrated face as she started to inspect the board on the shelf rather than look for another book.
Draco hums contemplatively. “To me neither. It was tainted. I still can’t believe that you persuaded me into moving back here.” He nudges Harry until Harry averts his gaze from the sight before him; an opulent mirror above the mantelpiece of a marble fireplace, large paintings to either side, a jungle that stretches over the confines of the painting into actual plants greening the light furniture of the room. Harry slants his head to kiss Draco.
Harry would doubtlessly attend in Muggle attire so Draco had dressed likewise in order to compliment him. A grey Vivienne Westwood shirt glided handsomely across his pecs, and he’d tucked it into his favourite pair of black Versace trousers. He’d even taken extra special care to style his hair and moisturise his skin. Had this been the authentic date that Draco was pretending it was, then he’d have been confident of his boyfriend’s undivided and very ardent attention.
Everything was all planned and prearranged for the twenty-sixth of June. The bags were packed, and waiting by the door, the film was waiting in the camera, and Andromeda had made sure to pack a dozen pumpkin-flavoured energy bars to keep Draco’s strength up. Yesterday was a very quiet, sedate day. Astoria and Blaise came over with ice-cream, and the four of us lazed in the garden, enjoying the early summer sun.
Harry locked his gaze on me, looking very young and vulnerable with his beautiful green eyes. "I'm not sure if I know that. You loved me?"
But he shook his head instantly, scattering more kisses across the strained skin. “You’re so handsome,” he said. “And you’ve practically been glowing since you became pregnant. You look beautiful.”
Harry was there, of course. Didn’t take a minute until I heard the crack of his Apparition while there was a war raging in my mind about calling a Muggle ambulance. And he kept a cool head, of course, and got me into safety. Same old story. Malfoy can’t look after himself and needs Potter’s grandeur to be saved. The Saviour strikes again. Bloody brilliant.
Disgust gurgled in Draco’s belly. He ought to have expected the question, but it’d still come as a surprise. He and Fitzgerald, linked indelibly for the rest of their lives.
Harry feels panic rise in his chest. He doesn’t want to think about any of that- Bloody Malfoy. He stands.
I told him that whenever I need his magic, I expect him to come into my room. That I’ll undress my shirt, taking my sweet time. That he will lay his hands on my skin and we will both feel this intimate, sensual, arousing prickle of our combining magic, and that he can pine after my prick and my arse all he wants.
“Like for us,” Tarquin goes on, still catching his breath. “Like- Tonight was just . . . so good. Absolutely evocative—inspiring!” Harry agrees, recalling the unexpectedly soft vocals, a crescendo of sounds that carried him away, eyes glued to the stage of a few long-haired blokes, powering their souls into distorted guitars, choir-like harmonies alternating with heart-clenching screams.
” Like it still sometimes happens, Harry saying Draco’s given name made Draco’s eyes big and wet with vulnerability.
Draco nods along and laughs in disbelief. “Harry Potter, an actual petty crook. The-“ Draco makes himself stop speaking, eyes flickering over Harry. “And you’re an Auror as well.”
, but it’s also equipped with nifty charms that are hardly in use today, at least not in this old-fashioned way. The charms are almost similar to house magic and provide the simple habitat with a certain warmth and humidity, depending on the intricate needs of a phoenix. The birds thrive in different temperatures and prefer different air moistures depending on their Burn Day cycle. And on their Burn Day, the copper is charmed to keep the ashes scorching hot which is the best temperature for phoenix fledglings.
One of Fitzgerald’s hands was holding his left arm, and he was using the rest of his weight to pin Draco to the bed, and fucking,
like to be him at the time, Harry has no clue anymore. It’s all a blur of classes, searching for the remaining Death Eaters, and trial after trial, interview after interview after interview . . .
The Beater unscrewed it, and took a swig, drinking straight from the neck. Merlin, but Fitzgerald could put the booze away. He offered Draco the bottle, but he refused. He’d drank a lot that evening already; more cocktails that he’d counted, and his head felt a little woozy.
Harry planned and prepared everything thoroughly; his reward for when he’ll get back later. The minibar is filled to the brim with beer and a good bottle of whisky, the Japanese one, Yamazaki, that this obnoxiously loud acting agent, everyone calls him Blue David, gifted Harry in a burst of bonhomie. Lazily hidden in the cupboard is a tray with a few baggies of coke; in his satchel, hidden in the cupboard as well, are a few grams of H, and on the coffee table sit these very fancy looking Russian black-and-gold cigarettes, Sobranie.
Theo levitated the plates and cutlery to the table, and, before long, the four of them were tucking in. Draco lapsed into silence as he picked at his Truffle Tofu and Potato Gratin. His mind registered the fact that the food was scrumptious, but it tasted like ash on his tongue. His stupid, foolish lie had placed him in this purgatory, and now he had to endure it as Harry gave him the loveliest flickering side-glances. Each made Draco’s belly flip over, and it wasn’t fair. None of this was real, and it simply wasn’t fair.
“It won’t be many months before she is released,” Draco told me, hiding yet another yawn behind his hand. “I think Mother will find the world much changed. Society is so very different to what it was like before her conviction. I don’t know where she’ll live, though I can’t see it being with myself. The louche existence I’m accustomed to doesn’t sit well with having Mother asking me what time I expect to be home.”
Harry stares at him. Malfoy looks twitchy and indecisive, but then, in one calculated looking motion, he pours more white powder onto the back of his hand, perhaps about 100mg, Harry has a good eye for that, and then Malfoy crosses the few steps that separate them. His impossibly pale hand is held out to Harry, veins meandering away in blue elevations that shouldn’t look so intriguing. Harry bows his head down to snort the mephedrone, ignoring the familiar stench that reminds him of stale urine in the loo of basically every nightclub. He barely resists the temptation to lick the dusty residue off of Malfoy’s skin.
“Draco, it’s alright.” He ponders whether he can tell Draco about the morphine he’s taking—not injecting!—and thinks, what the fuck, why not. Draco listens intently when Harry talks about how much easier his days start on two pills, and how he gets the stuff from a Muggle apothecary, copying prescriptions with as little as a tap of his wand and, when in doubt, using a quick charm that makes the pharmacist just a  little more trusting. The only thing he avoids mentioning is how unexpectedly hard the two weeks in summer had been that he spent tossing and turning in bed, sweaty and quivering and nauseous like he's never been before in his life.
“Merlin,” Harry muttered, closing his eyes and drawing in too-big breaths. “I think I’m- I won’t last long,” he ground out, unwillingly shoving his hips towards Draco’s grip. It took only a matter of seconds for him to come, and part of him was afraid that Draco would pull his hand away before he did, but the firm touch stayed tight around his prick as he spurted across Draco’s hands. Harry’s legs and arms felt sore from playing sport, from holding himself up, and from restraining his desperate want to brace himself on Draco.
"Let me help you heal," Draco whispers, his hand a tender touch on Harry's side that makes him lean closer to Draco. “The past has been nothing but cruel to you.” He swallows. “To both of us. I want you to be with me, here and now, and to allow yourself to trust the calm. Be with me if you want me. I won’t go away, Potter, I promise.” Draco holds him as though he might vanish on the spot, close and with all his body. “The world would be quite a bleak place without you.”
“You want to say something,” she pointed out, sounding like she had braced herself to hear something horrible.
“I just don’t understand why we can’t meet her there. She’s a capable woman, I’m sure she’ll manage to Apparate.”
“You’re a bloody mess, Potter.” The drawl is as unnervingly laconic and as coolly spoken as one might imagine.
Harry leant out of the embrace. His eyes were filled with tears in the dim light of the patio. He looked very overwhelmed with everything, a bit like he was more invested in my life than I sometimes am myself. “Thanks for trusting me so much that you told me,” he said.
Draco went after his conquests like a Seeker chasing down the Snitch, or a Niffler hunting gold. Maybe he wasn’t subtle, but Draco’s techniques usually worked. He wasn’t coy about getting what he wanted.
“I've gotten through life without a chaperone so far,” Harry mutters. He has hardly any recollection of the past day . . . perhaps the last two days . . . But he certainly can’t imagine a scenario in which he needed rescuing by Draco sodding Malfoy. He’s well behaved on drugs. The memory loss must have been due to- Harry can’t really remember. Downers and alcohol sometimes had weird interactions.
, for having been outside of the wizarding world for years, or for jutting down the address he shares with Draco Malfoy- well, he’ll gladly come back for his next check-up in six months.
Draco wasn’t sure of the truth of that. “I don’t know,” he admitted, his voice breaking. He felt fragmented, inside and out. “What if I’m not enough? What if I don’t have enough love to give? I’m not sure I can do this or even if I want to. I didn’t ask for this,” he said. “The bump – the
“It’s just past the Equinox,” he whispers, sounding as though he’s deep in thought, and Harry wonders why Draco says that.
“Plans you haven’t shared with me,” Draco said, hating how stupid and slurred his words sounded. “We haven’t even talked about who is going to top, Stuart! Sex… It- It
There’s a frown on Harry’s face, accentuating his severe, weary appearance. “I told you it wouldn’t be very . . . interesting.”
“Ever tell you how sexy you are?” I murmured, my voice rough with arousal. I didn’t think that Draco knew how wonderful he looked, shining with health and radiance. Even if I lived another hundred years, I doubted I’d ever see a vision so perfect again.
“But I wasn’t lying,” Harry replied. “Not when I said you’d not been far from my thoughts. Not when I said that I’d missed you.” Moving closer, he raised his hand to cup Draco’s jaw, “and I wasn’t lying when I kissed you.”
Fucking whilst on you knees sometimes tends to get exhausting on your thighs after a while. And ever since I’m pregnant, it sometimes feels weird to have this jolt go through your body with each thrust. The feeling usually wants to make me curl my hands over my belly even if the movements are not that hard.
Pansy was dressed to the nines in a striking crushed velvet number and was frantically arranging, and subsequently rearranging, the various plates of nibbles that the Parkinson elves had prepared for the occasion. Pansy’s pretty face broke into a wide happy smile as she took in Draco’s appearance.
“And it’s precious, isn’t it?” After a short silence, the melody from the music box plays; a delightfully simple melody that never fails to send a waft of nostalgia over Harry, a yearning for a time and memories he hasn’t lived to see. With the song, the figurines are dancing before Harry’s mind’s eye. When the melody stops, Harry hears a sniff. Mrs Crabbe sounds brittle when she speaks again. “How my Barthy would be delighted to see it repaired,” she says. “It belonged to his mother before he gave it to me the day I told him I was pregnant with our first. Salazar bless her.”
the reaction Harry had expected. Especially not combined with an odd, rueful smile that makes him look all closed off and distant.
“Let’s take it slow, okay?” Draco suggests, softly, but not managing to keep the quiver out of his voice.
. My dates have gone most of the way towards me paying my dues to the Ministry.” He made a snort of laughter. “As well as leaving me with a little memento to remember him by, the wonderful Mr Evans was the best paying customer that I’ve ever had.” Draco said, breaking off his words with a yawn. I could see how tired he was. “My only wish is that he’d come and find me again.”
I’ve got Galleons in Gringotts. I’ll use them to pay privately for magi-medical care for both him and the plum. I’ll ask Hemione to help me search somebody out. She’s a wily witch. I’m sure she’ll know what to do.
Harry dropped his head, but thankfully he didn’t answer. Pansy was the next to speak. “But why did you lie?” she asked, baffled. “And then to partake in this
Draco had always lived his life as he saw fit, and assumed that he would be respected for that. He hadn’t needed to worry about being touched, or about people listening to him because they always had done. That had been a given. Draco supposed that was what Fitzgerald had stolen from him. His self-assurance.
Draco goes on to explain about the copper and which types of spells provide information on the time the copper was crafted—apparently with the rise of Muggle electricity in the nineteenth century, mass mining and mass production led to new smelting techniques which made it hard to for the wizarding world to get their hands on the unprocessed metal. But it’s not only about the material of the basin, which is certainly forged under magical fires,
“So that’s how I earn my money,” I told him. I paused for a moment, giving him a chance to comment on my line of work. He didn’t look scandalised or judgemental. I briefly wondered whether he has ever paid for sex, seeing that he can’t seem to find a boyfriend nor a quick shag in wizarding Britain. It’s not that simple for him.
I imagined scooting even closer until I felt the tingle of his Warming Charm mixing with my own. And we would have entangled our arms, would have let our temples rest against each other. We would have watched the scintillating fireworks together in a reverent silence.
Wood’s party didn’t disappoint in the slightest. The cocktails were potent, and numerous, and Draco soon felt wonderfully loose and tipsy. The music was a low pulsing base that seemed to get inside of his skin, and charmed lights were strung over the walls, intimate and informal.
“And I told him to fuck off,” Draco snapped, cutting Pansy off before she launched into an unwelcome diatribe. “And he did.” Draco breathed out slowly, trying to calm himself. “But it wasn’t like that with Fitzgerald. He didn’t- he didn’t respect my boundaries and…” Draco paused. He was cold and shivery, and there was the tell-tale pressure at the back of his eyes that signified a migraine was getting close. “Fitzgerald didn’t respect my boundaries, and Pans, I think- I think he might have raped me-“
After I was okay to leave the hospital this morning, we had breakfast together. Merlin, but Potter cried before we even finished the tea. He confessed it all, the whole sorry take, and I told him that everything will proceed under my terms and conditions now. That he can bloody pay for everything – St Mungo’s, everything we will need for the baby – and that he better look after himself so that he’ll be strong enough to provide the much needed magic.
Something about what I said seemed to awaken something in Draco, and he lifted his head, his grey eyes flashing with pure wrath.
Fuck, but he won’t make it. He will let them all down; Ron and Hermione, and Narcissa Malfoy, and Dumbledore, and Remus. He can see their eyes, disappointed and worried. But now he’ll have to go back to the Dursleys, won’t he? There’s no way that Hogwarts will keep him after having messed up his mission.
Wrackspurts fluttered in Draco’s chest as he peered at his reflection. His cheeks were pinker than he’d have liked but there was nothing to be done about that, and a quick flick of his wand set his hair straight where it was curling a little at his nape. He charmed his teeth clean and straightened out the small crumples from his shirt. Tonight was shaping up to be everything he’d hoped it would be.
“Thanks,” Harry replies, feeling somehow rude and not as invested as he maybe should be. “Er, I think I need to get home sometime soon. No idea where we are though.”
Draco laughs quietly, rubbing his thumb over the inside of Harry’s wrist without averting his gaze from Percy who is talking at the moment.
Draco watched as Pansy gave Theo a kiss. Circe, but they really were nauseatingly in love. That had been half the reason Draco had fibbed. Everyone he knew was paring off and finding happiness, and all Draco had wanted was a little slice of that for himself. He knew he’d made some bad choices in the past, but was that really too much to ask for?
“We don’t have to do anything you don’t like,” Harry said, searching Draco’s gaze. “You don’t need to combust. We can just-“
That made a lot of sense. I leant forward in my chair. Listening to Mike was hard, but these were words that I needed to hear. I’d struggled with boyfriends before Draco.
A gentle pull from Draco, and Harry lies down on top of him. “Harry, it’s been so many years, and I’ve never held it against you. I appreciate it that you're sorry, but whatever it is that you’re feeling right now—it’s about something that’s in the past.”
The old wizard’s word jangled through Draco’s head as he Flooed home, showered, and crawled under his sheets. How could he have been so foolish to have fibbed to Pansy and then to have dragged Harry into his idiocy? Tomorrow would be an unmitigated disaster. What would Harry say when Pansy asked how they’d met? Or when Theo proved whether they had plans for the future? Embarrassment spiralled though Draco. Nott would
I breathed out a sigh of relief, half-randy and half-pleased that there wasn’t a bigger issue to worry about. The last thing I wanted to do was diminish Draco’s emotional state. The stretch mark was there, and it had upset him. Taking three steps, I crossed the bathroom so that I was standing, face to face with the other father of my baby. Hesitantly, I traced a line over the small mark with tender, reverent fingers. “Hardly unsightly,” I said. “More
Draco couldn’t understand how he’d ever been attracted to this slimy, nasty specimen. His tongue felt like a tentacle trying to choke him, and Draco gagged a little. He was done being nice. It was time to sit up, and fuck off. He might have a Dark Mark, and a dad rotting in Azkaban, but he still had a modicum of self-respect.
When they are back home, Harry Firecalls the Burrow and invents something about a nasty case of the Mufflemumps he’s supposedly starting, arguing with Draco that the day has been stressful enough.
“And what if you work in the evenings?” he said as we both sat on the floor in the freshly green-painted nursery. “What if I work in the days, you’re gone in the evenings, and all we have of each other are Sundays?”
I wouldn’t have thought that the Bonfire Incident would knock me as off kilter as it has, but here I am, hugging my pillow after I’ve hugged the toilet seat for the last half an hour.
Feeling slightly overwhelmed, because Harry had just watched his daughter leave for the first time for the entirety of a night, Harry gulped in air and raised his hands in a quest for Draco to take them, which he did. “I want to have sex,” he went on, as they were both of them stood there in the hallway at the bottom of the kid-safe-charmed stairs. “I think I’ll combust if we don’t.”
“Draco!” Pansy exclaimed, leaning in to kiss his forehead before batting non-existent dust from his shoulders, “don’t you look an absolute peach! Potter will absolutely die a thousand deaths when he claps eyes on you! And knows where to come, doesn’t he? Merlin, but I expect the chap’s brain almost
They moved into the dining room not long afterwards where Harry continued to play the role of boyfriend without fault. He held out Draco’s chair for him to sit down, poured out half a glass of wine for him to drink, and never once let his warm, protective hand stray far from Draco’s own. The whole experience was heady and didn’t feel far removed from the time at school when somebody had spiked his morning tea with love potion.
When Harry falls into the lap of a stranger that night that leads him to his knees in the grimy confines of a graffiti-lined bathroom stall, in between
hasn’t done anything wrong. But he can’t lose the feeling that Tarquin and John didn’t only fight about Tarquin dropping out of his master’s programme, but that it might also had to do something with Harry himself.
“Draco, darling,” Harry tries, running a hand through Draco’s hair that comes to rest in his nape. “We had a fight, it’s no big deal.”
“Bloody hell,” he pronounced, grinning incredulously. “I’m exhausted just thinking about your life, Potter. You’re always on the go! So, did the two get together on one of your adventures? Let’s hear all the ghastly romantic clichés and don’t spare the details. Malfoy will only blab them when he’s had a few too many glasses of booze anyway. He’s always been the worst sort of lightweight-”
Draco had an afternoon date with Kayden, one of his regulars, and I had a long day at Phoenix to endure before we could spend our evening together. I’d already planned out our dinner of pasta and sun-dried tomatoes, and I was enthusiastic about making something that I knew my lover would enjoy for our one-month anniversary.
With a huff, Draco asked Tom for a second double shot. What did it matter if he were drunk and a liar, destined to remain a boring bachelor for the rest of his days? Harry would never want him, not with the dreadful Mark that ruined his arm and his shoddy family name. The two of them moved in different circles, and Draco was wrong in every sense. Harry would never, not in a million lifetimes, look his way.
They are quiet while horizontal. Draco guides Harry’s head to his own, and for a while, all they do is kiss to the tunes of 00’s pop-rock, beats thrice the tempo of their languorous kisses.
I went on about how I started seeking out guys who looked like they’d pay, and how that job became far more convenient and lucrative when I found out about the internet two years later.
I had this little hope that my pregnancy would miraculously turn out fine, and that the circumstances that led me directly under Potter’s roof established enough chances that ultimately led to the two of us falling for each other. And I know how much Potter adores children. If it’s not the pregnancy kink, it’s certainly his wish for a family with children as a gay man that would have made me a very reasonable choice to stay with. I suppose that’s a chance Harry was happy enough to take, even if it meant being with the tosser who poisoned his best friend, and whose father wanted him dead and whose aunt tortured his other best friend.
Fitzgerald actually seemed to find Draco’s pathetic escape attempt a bit of a turn on. He covered Draco’s mouth with his own and stuck in his tongue. The taste of Firewhisky flooded Draco’s mouth, cloying and sickly-sweet.
Malfoy taps his wand on one Lucius Armand Malfoy and next to his son, Arimanius Lucius, a daughter pops into life. A woman presenting herself from the front, her chin angled slightly. She looks witty and prudent; her cheeks look more than a little well-nourished and she wears a hat on her head that exceeds the width of her shoulders by far. She’s born in 1850 in Malfoy Manor.
I’ve sent his two owls this week, and both were returned to me with short, almost brusque notes attached to their legs. Bloody hell, but I do hope Draco is feeling alright. I remember what he said to me, before we left for The Burrow, that his appetite was all over the place. I have to admit that I’m worried. Draco is normally healthier than a hippogriff. His wanting to stay in and not come to the Phoenix Christmas party is entirely out of character. Maybe he really
The way Malfoy says it, sincere and factual, eyes on Harry, and his hands folded in his lap as though he’s nervous- it annoys Harry. “Well, yes. You’d be bloody dead without me,” he says, trying not to look at him because he’d see how insecure Malfoy looks.
away. A look of confusion washed over the Healer’s face, followed rapidly by a look of anger. “I was the wizard that Draco slept with,” I explained, feeling more sordid with every word. “I used an adulterated Polyjuice potion that I brought under the counter in Knockturn Alley and hair that I stole from a Muggle stranger.”
When he came back, he was holding a plate of chocolate digestives. The biscuits were terribly Muggle, but so delicious, and Draco felt a wave of affection for Potter. He opened his mouth to both thank Harry, and to chide him for fattening him up, but the words that fell out of his mouth weren’t the ones that Draco expected to say.
Draco glanced around, trying to work out whom Potter wanted to speak to. There wasn't anyone else though, and before he had time to make a sharp exit, Harry sat down beside him.
to know you’re feeling poorly. Fuck, it quite frankly pains me whenever you’re not feeling on top of the world, you git.”
The two of them were taking things slowly, but every day Draco found himself falling for Harry just a little bit more. There hadn’t been any love confessions yet or any epic romantic gestures, but such things weren’t very easy with a new-born taking up all their energy and time.
Harry takes the empty glass out of Draco’s hands and puts it down on a table behind him, a soft noise of glass on wood interrupting the quiet, muffled sounds of their neighbours that Harry had already grown too familiar with to hear them most of the time.
“It is,” Draco replies. He draws a big phial from the inside pocket of his Muggle-esque travel robes; the Muggles become uneasy the moment his hand vanishes behind the fabric. He takes his wand too, holding it out before him into the open room of the small confines that once housed a little boy. A jolt goes through his wand, zooming up his arm with such a powerful force that, for the fraction of a second, it feels like his arm burns up from the inside. The pain is replaced with a pleasant thrum as soon as he starts murmuring an incantation to conceal the magic.
Bartsch set to work behind the dignity curtain, but all I could focus on was your father’s face. There were so many emotions visible, Cassiopeia. Fear, excitement, and so much wonder. I felt nothing but genuine, complete privilege that I stood there beside him. “There’s pressure,” he muttered, “pressure on the top of my bump, and I feel a tugging-“
James looked at me every so often. He has quite an observing, intent gaze somehow. I think I must’ve watched a few couples on a small dance floor near the bar for a little too long, because he asked, “Want to dance after I’ve finished this?” meaning his tiramisu. I almost choked on my wine because I honestly wasn’t sure if the hotel personnel would be too chuffed about two men dancing to slow music. However, I was adamant that I'd give James the date that he wanted. And even though he had asked me, I sensed a bit of longing when his eyes flickered between me and the swaying couples.
Harry visits Gringotts as was instructed in the owl he received a few weeks prior. He didn’t react in time which led to his vault being frozen. He realised when the lady at the reception asked him to pay his monthly bills for food, spa as well as other pleasantries, and again when he went out with a few people and offered to pay the next few rounds, only to reach into his wallet and find nothing but air.
Harry chortled, forcing his hand away from Draco’s pulsing cock. He pulled him into an embrace, and he confessed, “I mean that I'm very much out of, er- practice. I used to use toys, but you can probably tell that I’ve not been . . . active in that department.”
As we watched Rose build a tower out of little blocks and Hermione proudly announced that she stacked it higher two more blocks than was average for her age, I began to wonder about my future. Whether I would have friends coming over to visit me and the plum, renouncing flashy parties and fun company just to spend a quiet evening in a small circle of close intimates. I would actually love that. More than I had imagined possible. And it’s so different from the way I grew up. Potter even handles Rose as though she was his own, much like he’s always done with Teddy.
When Harry is high off his face with his second trip of the night, he tells Tarquin how awful it is that John abandoned them. How he feels that he really, honestly thought that the three of them had a special friendship, and that he can’t understand how John could decide to walk away like he did. Harry has Tarquin tell him the story of one of his last talks with John for the umpteenth time, shaking his head in disappointment at John’s comment, three years or so ago, that partying every weekend was too much, that he was too tempted to get high with them when they stayed at John’s place.
“That. Is. Not. What. I. Meant.” Harry’s jaw starts to hurt from clenching it so hard, but it helps him restraining himself from jostling Draco again. His fingernails dig into the flesh of his palms. Harry tries to concentrate on that.
Before Harry leaves, he decides to pack a baggie of coke. Just in case that he gets nervous or shaky. Then he looks into the mirror one last time, finding not his own reflection, but that of nondescript bloke with spectacles, but no scar, no wild hair, slightly rounder build. After a breath, he Disapparates.
, if even just for the night. He could tell this bloke—John—anything that came to mind, and he would either believe him or not, and it wouldn’t even matter a Sickle. Before he can start grinding his gears about what Muggle subjects even exist, he goes for something entirely outside of his experience. “Art.”
“It feels like-“ Draco gestures with his hands in front of him, eyes blank. “Like someone sucked the life out of that place. I have no idea whether it’s just me or . . . The place is rotten to the core. And, frankly, every other room holds a memory of
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, hugging Draco closer. Draco’s shaky hands fist the back of Harry’s shirt. “I didn’t mean to . . . You’re doing an amazing job. You’re good at it, and you repair things that mean a lot to people for all different kinds of reasons. It’s a good job, Draco.”
have thought you to enjoy karaoke night,” Malfoy muses before eating the second half of the praline.
The idea has passed through my mind many times, but Draco’s enthusiasm was infectious. Draco was of the opinion that it was high time Teddy was learning broomstick skills and told me how he had mastered a full size Firebolt before he’d ever got to Hogwarts. “I’m not suggesting anything quite so potent for my cousin,” Draco said swiftly. “Just something to get him in the air. If you’ve made it with your two fair hands, then I don’t think Andi has cause for complaint.”
Harry handed me the broomstick once he was done, and it was perfectly polished and light as a feather. I even sat astride it to hover above the ground in the middle of the workshop for a moment to try it, and it felt great. We spoke about the acceleration and such. Harry confessed that it would hardly compete with the faster and more expensive Firebolt models. But when I told him that the haptic of the handle was sleek and perfect, just the way I like it, and that I enjoyed the surprisingly light weight, he looked very pleased and perhaps a bit flattered.
“You’ve got a gorgeous cock Stuart,” Draco said, trying to inject a bit of erotic tension into their liaison. “Fancy letting me go down on you?”
“No, but you didn’t seem like someone who was confident when others laughed about him. You didn’t like to be made fun of,” Malfoy says.
It’s been a good couple years since he last had a smoke, and he only rarely thinks about it. But right now, it’s all his mind can focus on. Of the feeling of closing his lips around the thin, dry paper, and a harsh inhale. When he draws in a drag of the nondescript air in the room, he can almost taste the sharpness of a cigarette. Jesus, he wants one so badly.
Listen to me. I can’t even get to the point when I’m writing in my own sodding diary. I’m beating around the proverbial bush. A Mind Healer told me once, years ago that when your conscience is troubling you, the best thing you can do is write about it. Make the page the friend that you’re brutally honest with. When it is on the page in black ink it might not look as bad.
“Harry,” he introduces himself. He fists his hand in his coat pocket, feeling torn between shaking this bloke’s hand and just nodding at him. He goes for the latter, naturally feeling stupid right after.
The first website was a bust. Granted, the men there were gorgeous, but many were tied up in complicated knots or wore leather bondage gear. That wasn’t what I wanted, not with a man I didn’t know from Adam. Casting my eyes up at the clock I was surprised to see that nearly a quarter of my time had already passed.
Work was as busy and chaotic as ever. Jules wanted as many brooms finished as possible before the Hogwarts Easter hols and time was running out to meet his ambitious target. Still, as always, I aimed to please. By the time mid-afternoon rolled around, I was happily sanding away a gorgeous piece of oak, my attention wholly focused on my task. Draco and Kayden had left my mind entirely.
the pharmacist, thinking that, after confiding all kinds of embarrassing shit in Draco and after sneaking off in the twilight of dawn like he had, panicking in the morning upon the sight of pebbled scars across a nipple- He can’t ever go back. Never.
“No,” Harry concedes, shaking his head. Harry feels like the bloke sees right through him and also like he owes him a truthful answer, catching himself arguing whether he could get away telling a Muggle about magic.
"No, I thought you'd hate me for that try. I couldn't have borne the embarrassment when you had rejected me."
When he glimpses at Draco, his eyebrows are arched and he nods his head pensively, mouth corners pulled earthwards and eyes blankly fixated somewhere on the table between them. “Very dead.”
“You look just like your father, dear boy,” a voice says, undeniably that of an anciently old lady. Harry leans against the wall, listening closely. “But the honest work you do! None of that wheeling and dealing young Lucius was entertaining. May Salazar bless him.”
Harry flips away the end of his cigarette and chugs the last of his beer, feeling the grumble of his empty stomach. Behind him, the others are more or less passed out, only Tarquin is still up, sitting on the ground, leant over a shallow table where he's frantically scribbling away in his black notebook. He only notices Harry when he reaches for his cup of coffee with trembling fingers, only to find it empty, and taking a bewildered look into the cup and then through the room. His eyes are red-rimmed, and his hair stands in odd directions. There's a bruise blooming on his forehead, and Harry wonders when and how that got there.
On the bright side, I’m not endangered to face such a fate. All I have to fear are disdainful gazes of purebloods and perhaps some folks on Diagon spitting at me or something equally vile. That will hardly matter, knowing that at least Harry will be there. Aunty won’t forsake me either. I hope that Pans, Blaise and Greg will understand… I won’t explain to them how I got myself pregnant, but…
Nowadays though? What a let-down. Harry wore odd, battered clothes and he didn’t appear to have cut his hair for a year. He was singularly the drabbest man of Draco’s acquaintance.
After the Apparition, Harry can still feel Draco’s shudder under his fingertips, can still feel where Draco’s fingertips dug too hard into his ribs.
No doubt Fitzgerald had told all the other Arrows about his conquest by now. Draco imagined them slapping Fitzgerald on the back and shaking his hand. Draco felt his body shiver, and his chest grow tight. Perhaps Fitzgerald had told all his teammates he’d given Draco the fucking of his life.
My heart jumped to my mouth, and I thought for sure that Draco was going to mention his profession or even James Evans. I thought for sure that he was going to tell me that he knew what I'd done, and how I'd tricked him.
I couldn’t help it. My temper had been bubbling very close to the surface ever since the Mediwizard had begun his little diatribe, but threatening to take Draco’s baby away over some trumped-up nonsense? That was beyond the pale.
. Will you be willing to share your magic for several hours each day? It mightn’t be for the whole pregnancy. It’ll just be for those periods where baby Malfoy is having a growth spurt. Your magic will be the most effective, because you share the familial bond.”
Draco was breathing heavily, his taut abdomen, lined with beautifully pale stretch marks, pulsing as he shoved his hips into Harry’s hands. “We want to,” he agreed, fervently.
But none of that was the case with Harry. Circe, but he was so close to me. His arms were wrapped around me very tightly, his groin met my arse and lingered there for a moment with each glide. I felt Harry’s head on my back, hot and wet breaths, and kisses. All I could think about was that I didn’t want this moment ever to end. I was so close to suggesting getting my cock rings out and just keep going for the whole afternoon, but I didn’t want to interrupt us either.
There’s too much wet in his mouth all of a sudden and a lump that makes his breath hitch. Draco is already next to him when Harry understands that he’s about to cry, startled by the sob that escapes his mouth. And with the first tears welling and overflowing, a stream of long-repressed thoughts effervesces from his lips, chaotic and desperate to be said out loud.
“Boy,” the man bellows, voice stricken with pretence bravery. It takes Draco a moment to understand that with
Harry understands only later that Draco was packing a bag for them, when Hermione hands him a small box for his birthday. In it he finds a battered tin soldier of all things (well, she can’t know, he never told her about the cupboard), and it takes him a shocked moment to realise that it’s a Portkey, not some sort of twisted plot to make Harry talk about repressed trauma.
And then Harry starts to understand what he’s doing and that there’s the Dark Mark under the arm he’s so tenderly holding.
Harry isn’t sure whether he could abide having Teddy work as an Auror, but he too wonders whether said anything wrong or spoke too harshly. And when he thinks about it, he wonders how Hermione can stay in the Ministry with everything going on. If things are still as infuriatingly intricate and unproductive and just full of red-tape as they always used to be . . . It’s easier to shut these thoughts out with Draco’s body heat against his skin.
Several minutes pass with deliberately controlled breathing and too-warm palms on thighs. No words, no hexes. The earlier paranoia wore off. Malfoy didn’t appear to be any sort of threat despite his reluctance to explain what the fuck is going on. But then, Harry didn’t ask, so-
It was late in January when Harry first slept over. The night was frigid and there was a deep layer of snow on the ground. Harry and he had been lazing on the settee, listening to his record player when Draco had realised that he didn’t want to be alone. The idea of Harry Disapparating away felt terribly upsetting – his stupid hormones were all over the place – so Draco asked Harry to stay overnight.
Harry frowns at Draco’s words, trying to imagine a younger version of Draco; a sneering boy, a skeletal spectre in sixth year, hardly any better when Harry saw him again at Malfoy Manor . . . and in the courtroom. “It’s unfair, the way you got involved in this.”
Bonfire Night – already a month ago – still fills every one of my daydreams. Sometimes I convince myself that I dreamt the whole thing. That Draco actually kissed me – not gorgeous, muscley James Evans but
insisted on trailing along, Auror Potter.” He can feel Potter’s eyes on him, only briefly, but it’s enough to make him regret speaking with him with such a cold professionalism. It’s his sacrosanct rule on the job, and Draco has a hard time letting go of his self-imposed rites.
Crouching next to him, Harry inspects the little horn that has formed there. He pushes firmly against the spot, causing Tarquin to hiss and flinch away from his fingers. "Sorry, sorry" Harry mutters sympathetically, smiling at himself for the successful distraction of his whispered Healing Charm. He presses a kiss against Tarquin’s neck before letting him go back to his writing.
“Draco, you’ve made my day,” Harry answered as soon as he’d gotten a reasonable hold over himself. He grinned as he brought his glass of whisky up to his lips. “In fact, scratch that previous sentence. You’ve made my whole week. So, you’ve told Nott and Parkinson that we’re an item? I’ll give you one thing, Draco Malfoy. You certainly know how to capture a bloke’s attention! Many people have asked me out in lots of ways, but I think you’ve won the House Cup. Alright. You’ve tickled my interest. I'll do it. I’ve done far worse things in my life than pretend to be a fellow’s boyfriend for a couple of hours.”
I’m glad that Mother had never encountered the depth of Azkaban. I can’t believe that her sentence will be served in about ten months’ time. As happy as I am about the prospect of having her out of prison – it will change my whole life all over again. I would talk to her about several organisational matters before the turn of the year, to see where she might want to live. I love her, but I don’t know if I have the strength and patience to move in with her.
“Nott, you uncouth arse!” Draco gasped, wishing the ground would open up and suck him beneath the surface. “You can’t just come out with statements like that!”
But Harry doesn't run when it gets too much. Or when he does, it's with Draco's fingers entangled with his own between the chairs at the Burrow or pushing their way through crowded venues. Harry took Draco to Gorgoroth and told him that the vocalist is gay. After the first few minutes of shock about the music and, “
“Yes, of course,” Harry says, keeping the amusement out of his voice. “I’m not your bloody house-elf, you know?”
Draco shifts until his hand is at Harry’s nape, fingers caressing the back of his head. “You gave me more than just a few chances in my life. And whatever you do, no matter how often you decide to leave—I’ll be happy when you come back. Every time. When I found you in that hotel, I Side-Alonged you because I felt like I owe you. And I also mended your grandmother’s heirloom because it felt like some small form of reconciliation. But if I did something for you now, I’d do it because I’d hope it’d make you happy. Because it feels nice, spending time with you.”
loved ones are like. For all I know yours might deck you out like a house-elf and parade you across Diagon Alley-”
Harry was surprised to feel different. There was not one fibre of him that thought sex important enough to change a relationship. But the truth was, that it somehow did. Remembering the hand job in the shower, and remembering the several times that Draco had watched him masturbate, and had lately started to touch himself while doing so- it sometimes added so far unknown nuances to their life.
“What does it matter? It’s he-said-she-said and I’ll bet there’s not a smidgen of proof.” Cormac stood up. “Come on. Let’s go across to The Leaky. Fancy a pint?”
“May I,” Harry asked with a smile, and Draco wiped a tear from the corner of his eye, nodded, and let Harry rest his head on his chest.
Harry concentrates on breathing properly and shrugs. Draco goes very quiet after that. He takes tiny sips from the water bottle, obviously lost in thoughts. He leans against Harry’s hand on the back rest.
Diary. It’s been a long couple of weeks, hasn’t it since I last wrote? I’ve used the time well, at least I hope I have. I spoke to Hermione a while ago, over a bottle of wine, and I told her everything. I swore her to secrecy and made her swear that she wouldn’t ever tell Ron. My friend gave me some excellent advice. She’s always been the wisest person I’ve ever known, ever since I was a child.
“Indeed, phoenixes. They successfully bred a phoenix. Which is quite rare and- Apologies, you surely know that; you’re not an imbecile. I didn’t mean to be-“ Malfoy clears his throat. “Well, actually-
They have both been surprised how the vast stretch of the land tugs at the bond that is woven into their wedding bands whenever Harry is in the garden and Draco in the atelier. It’s not a strong bond; they don’t feel pain when they’re apart, but the rings pull towards each other inevitably. When they first noticed that it happened within the borders of their new home, Harry had Apparated to Draco, laughing but also close to weeping for a feeling that he didn’t dare investigate further. They kissed and kissed and kissed until they ended up christening the workshop and after that the not-yet-finished terrace below the drawing room, just outside the kitchens, because it was a warm day and Draco pointed out that the whole estate is for only them to use in whichever way they want.
It was a stupid, pathetic fantasy, and as stupid and pathetic as he was. He was nothing but a stupid, pathetic cockslut, with a reputation that he’d done nothing but live up to.
“Oh, don’t be ridiculous, Potter.” Draco smiles. “I’m in hopes that you’re planning on making up for that later.” Their smirks find one another for a playful peck that ends much too quickly. With their faces so close to one another, both their smiles seem to fade within a breath. Draco’s eyes look like molten lead in the flickering candlelight, intense and dark. “Or perhaps now,” he says, his voice so low that Harry’s balls tighten in direct response.
Harry is unsure of what to say and suddenly aware that it’s early in the afternoon and that Malfoy probably has work to do. He follows the idea he subconsciously had anyway, and reaches into his pocket, retrieving the two bags of coke and mephedrone. “I still owe you,” he says. “Thought we could . . . I don’t know, repeat last time?”
. You might have paid for me once, but now it’s your turn, Harry. You’ll give me your magic, and you’ll keep
Still a bit confused, Harry propped himself up, giving me a deep kiss before he dived lower. He scattered kisses all across my big bump, and I watched him. His dark green eyes which look familiar and yet so different without his spectacles, finding mine. His ebony hair that always makes me want to comb my fingers through it. Circe, but he’s handsome. I’m so in love with him, and I love the sight of him going down on me.
Into the night they went in mutual, non-spoken agreement. All that existed was dewy grass catching on ankles, the earthy scent mixing with the last streaks of sulphur and blood wafting over from the castle in the distance, a few towers prominent only with the absence of stars. Harry remembers thinking that, actually, on principle, he ought to have been pissed at Malfoy, annoyed that, somehow, he’s always there. But he wasn’t. Not annoyed, not angry, not happy. He didn’t feel a thing while walking with the bloke who, historically, had the capability of making Harry be livid with a single look or the cadence of his voice. He also remembers thinking that, perhaps, he had really died that morning. Perhaps that’s what it feels like to be a ghost, though why he would have decided to stay for such a life, Harry wasn’t sure. Did he misunderstand his options?
Harry can’t help but smile, mesmerised by the view and the feel of magic washing over the table. “I'll have it like you’d take it,” Harry says, eager.
The guilt and shame he feels don’t seem to wane so far, and it’s almost unfair that I know exactly how that feels. I still wonder, though, why he Polyjuiced himself and even more importantly, why he kept it secret for so long. I feel less angry about it by now, but no less disappointed in him. I don’t know how to forgive him. Perhaps I ought to ask him how he forgave me.
Draco smiled wryly at the rest of us. “Alas Teddy,” he answered, taking a swallow of his water glass, “Much as I would love it to, I’m not certain a Groat will be quite enough to save the day on this occasion.”
“And so far, I don’t feel any Dark magic lurking somewhere,” Harry observes. “May I?” he asks, pulling his wand out of his woollen coat, one that he brought with Draco at a fancy tailor. Draco told him that he looks so scrumptious in it that he’ll buy it as his Yule present.
“I prayed that you’d make it. The prophecy—I always knew it was about you, and that if anyone on this earth would make it,” Draco whispers against Harry’s hair, “that it could only be you, Potter.” And then he breathes, “Harry,” like a secret.
to that vile individual. They’d be your own! Yours to love and cherish, and to raise better than Lucius and I managed.” A tear rolled down her face. “You’d raise them to be kind and gentle, and to respect other people. You’d raise them in love.”
“They’re fine,” the Healer cut in. “Their heartbeat is stable and they’re moving exactly as I’d wish for them too. We’ve replenished Mr Malfoy’s magic artificially and given him a sleeping potion to help him rest. As you can imagine, he was very upset, and we needed to get his blood pressure under control. He’s unconscious at the moment and will remain so for the next few hours.” The Healer paused, frowning into the middle distance. “I don’t know if you’re aware, but Mr Malfoy wrote your name as his next of kin in his medical notes, which means I can be frank with you about his condition. I’m afraid this is a very serious matter. The file says that the father of the baby is an unknown person. Do you have any clue whatsoever whom it might be? A mutual friend, or-“
But eventually, Harry Apparates right into the drawing room and paces through the house to find Draco in the study, sitting in the cosy armchair by the fire, right next to Harry’s phoenix perch with a book in his lap. Harry replaces it with himself.
Maybe it’s wishful thinking – I hope it isn’t – but Draco is happier as well. At first, Draco was very strict with me, and very practical. He told me that he was staying here for the plum’s benefit, and theirs only. He told me that we were housemates, living together for strict level-headed, businesslike reasons. Draco needed a place to live, and I had one. Draco needed looking after, and I was willing to do it.
Now, the thought of his words sprouts heat in Harry’s clammy neck because it feels like too much. But he reminds himself that Draco didn’t look at him funny or say anything odd afterwards. He’s in the souterrain of his house, talking to a customer for whom he mended a set of magicked quills that didn’t work properly anymore, but were too much of a precious family heirloom. And once Draco is done, he’ll probably take a short break from whatever charm he’s mending at the moment to have tea with Harry and to divert his thoughts from the coke in the locked cabinet under the stairs and the non-existent cigarette Harry keeps fantasising about.
“Don’t worry, she’ll come here and get it herself. I’m not going to send your precious, restored antique via owl.”
“You’ve got a lot of nerve,” was one of the things that Harry shouted. “Undo your nonsense,” was another. A moment later the patio doors swung open, and Harry strode out. His cheeks wore a red flush of anger, something that Draco rarely ever saw.
“Oh, er-“ Harry thinks that he must’ve gotten completely rotten at glamours or that Malfoy is extremely sensitive to such magic. “See, I’m-
“That’s a bit potent for me,” Harry said, tilting his head in the direction of the drink. “I’ve got work first thing tomorrow. Don’t want to go in with a sore head, Draco. Thanks, but no thanks.”
It was bizarre, really. Once the idea of buying sex had entered my head, I knew that I had to follow through with it.
But when they are in the bedroom, and Draco turns around to pull Harry towards him, his gaze is dark again, his lips slightly parted. “And now it’s even thrice,” Draco says, tugging at the hem of Harry’s shirt. Harry takes it off, and just like the last time, he watches Draco’s eyes travel over every inch of exposed skin, his fingers running over his stomach and up in his chest hair, starting to massage his shoulders and the crook of his neck when his hands reach the top of his torso. The look in Draco’s eyes is almost as arousing as his firm touch.
Harry shrugs, eyes and thoughts on Draco’s collar. Harry’s hands follow his gaze, stroking fabric and the delicate skin of Draco’s neck.
It might have been the wrong thing to say, but I replied that there’s no one I trust more. “Trust you with my life,” I added, giving a wry little smile. If I had been drunk, I would have spilled all these sappy things that ran through my mind. About Potter being such a great friend and a good person in general and all that… I wish I could vanish these thoughts, they make me feel ridiculous and weak.
, hotel suite. He recalls the elegant spine the moment the guy turns tail and flees, and the thought is even more absurd and infuriating than this whole bloody morning or whatever time of the day it might be.
I should probably write a few sentences about seeing Mother and Father. After all, it’s why I started writing a journal in the first place. Was sort of the next best thing to seeing a Mind Healer.
Harry stares at it, not understanding anything but grandmother and phoenix. “Phoenixes?” Harry realises that the crossed sticks do look a bit like a perch for a huge bird.
I’m begging to all the deities above and below that he will be just like that with my child. That he will pick them up and call them silly names and- there’s so much more he does. He helped Rose stack some peas on her spoon (which she didn’t like because she wanted to do it by herself), but it’s just… Journal, I’m officially out of words for this. Potter has never failed to turn me into an ineloquent idiot.
It was weird to eat in the morning; usually Harry didn't. And despite the food being perfectly delicious and smelling like heaven, Harry panicked when the plate was put in front of him because his stomach churned at the idea of eating, and retching at the table with Malfoy was the last thing he wanted to do.
, God damn it—it’s not like they were notorious meth junkies. And it’s not even like they were drunk. People do all kinds of aggressive shit when they are drunk, but not on bloody happy pills. Bloody police with their biased opinions about drugs. And fuck the media as well for making it sound like everyone harmed on drugs is so
It’s in the middle of the night, and after the better part of a bottle of whisky that Harry Apparates, into the middle of a club, instantaneously overwhelmed with the nausea from the jump, the oppressive, industrial sounds of the music, the crowded dance floor and people shoving at him because of his unexpected presence in between them. He knows that he’s on the verge of a panic attack, struggling to gulp in air, his heart hammering along to the blasting percussions and ear-splitting synths. It’s exactly what he needs, the thrill of danger, even if it’s only an illusion, his bodily functions stretched to their limits with the stress of perceptions and ethanol as the only thing that keeps him on his feet are the undulating masses encompassing him.
Draco seemed to emerge after that, more and more. He didn’t like the wine – apparently it was “too tart” – and so we moved onto a different vintage when our main courses arrived. I adored that Draco wasn’t docile or weak in his character. Even though he was here at the behest of James Evans, he was still very much his own man. I shivered when he brushed his hand over mine, and the two of us held hands. Merlin, but it felt so natural. If it was an act, I could scarcely accept it as true. I can hardly remember now what we talked about, but we laughed a lot.
“You lucky git,” she mutters, but her voice dies out in between sudden screams that instantly put Harry on high alert. Despite himself, he moves, dragging Carol with him while looking for the source and reason for the shrieking voices. Then he sees it. A guy on his back, holding his throat and croaking without drawing a single breath. After the initial few screams, the room seems to be frozen now. Everyone’s eyes are glued to the bloke on the ground, his body constricting under the tablecloth and food that he must have pulled with him when he went down.
The moon looks other-worldly the way it’s huge and pale, illuminating the clouds that coil around the orb. Harry stops for a moment just to watch that beautiful scenery, chasing away a few stray thoughts about the influence of the moon on magical plants—he’ll think none of that. He just wants to watch the moon. It reminds him to pay attention to himself, to dwell in this contented rapture he’s experiencing right now. His heart feels light and happy in anticipation of talking through the whole night with two amazing people, his body limp and stimulated from the exertions of dancing.
We sat sideways after that, exchanging deep kisses and had our eyes only on each other. Not even the beautiful view we had up there on that cliff was more worth seeing. Harry said that he loves me too. That he enjoyed yesterday, and he asked, "Does it mean that you can forgive me? That I'll get a second chance?"
Dudley would be upstairs, playing with his new toys, and that meant I could have time to myself. I’d eat a couple of slices of Christmas cake and give myself a belly ache. It was entirely worth it. I swear to Merlin, never in my life has any cake tasted sweeter.
“I didn’t mean to make you worry, Harry. Nothing’s the matter,” Draco said quickly. “Daisy is with Teddy and Andi. She said it’d be alright if she watched after the two on her own for an hour or two.”
It’s silent for a long moment. Before Harry can do anything for or against it, Draco is right there, a careful hand on Harry’s back that sneaks up his spine until it rests in his nape. “You look so tired,” Draco whispers. “So, so tired.” Harry doesn’t defy Draco’s ministrations. He’s turned towards Draco, his head gently guided closer, arms wrapping around him in a tender embrace. After a tense moment, Harry exhales and succumbs into the touch, the warm, firm body against his own, lets his weary head lull forward to come to a rest on Draco’s shoulder. Draco’s soft shirt smells freshly laundered and so like him.
Gods below, when the fireworks went off, I had this feeling that seized me on such a visceral level that my chest is still aching with it. For just a split second, I imagined staying and getting what I so dearly wished for.
“Don’t even think about it,” he answers with a soft kiss, his heart sinking a bit. If the queasy feeling has to do with the reminder of the Sectumsempra scars or with the thought that Draco even suggests that—Harry isn’t sure. But he won’t allow his antics to get in the way this time because he wants sex, now. And more than that—he wants Draco.
Harry hummed affirmatively, sitting down on the settee behind his family. But Godric, the sight never failed to warm his heart.
Harry agrees, but points out how Tarquin used to make fun of him for that, for picking the safe e road, and not having the balls to find a work that truly fulfils him; something that isn’t just elusive numbers and presentations about profit, but something with an actual effect on himself or other human beings.
why the other wizard’s answer didn’t make sense. “I should have known you’d live up to your reputation.”
It takes Harry a long moment to understand what Malfoy is saying. “Oh, oh! That wasn’t them.” He gives a laugh at the thought. “We don’t hang out as much as we used to.”
Draco knew what Harry was getting at, but he couldn’t go there. There were wizarding families that would take in the bump and look after them. Families that would love them like their very own child. That was very important to him. The bump hadn’t asked to exist and Draco didn’t want them sullied by the violence that had made them.
"It scares me when you say things like that. You told me about these dreams you have about being dead."
“I never would have thought that it’d be fun talking to you,” Harry says. “Like- it’s so nice and easy. And there’s just so much we don’t know about each other. I mean, it’s been . . . over a decade that . . . well, it’s been a long time since school is what I’m saying, and you-“ Harry gestures to Malfoy who nods with his big, attentive eyes glued on Harry. “You seem to be a decent bloke, mate.”
“That’s not why we went out. I wouldn’t have minded spending the day in bed with our curtains drawn closed. I just thought you’d enjoy the beach more than you imagined you would.” Draco turns his head, only slightly to glimpse at Harry. The awe-stricken look in his eyes doesn’t falter. “Love you,” he mumbles, almost a whisper.
Draco laughed at my plan. “Oh, love,” he said, watching as I caught the jar and then unscrewed the lid. “I’ve been using that since the day I found out I was expecting. Must have slathered on three tubs of the stuff. It hasn’t made a whit of difference. I’ve still got a stretch mark.”
Harry realises that he must’ve closed his eyes when he feels the table wiggle. A woman sits across him, back against the wall, face to the room. She looks slightly overdressed, even for this kind of lounge, and she’s wearing thick round glasses that give her a scholarly air.
St Swithin’s Crescent wasn’t any place for a baby, whereas Grimmauld had a big garden, and plenty of room to play. It would be a family home, full of laughter, and that was everything that Draco wanted for Daisy. A family, to raise her in love and happiness.
you?” Cormac shook his head. “I spoke to him last night, Malfoy! He's devastated! He told me everything. You disgust me.”
“So I take in many very mundane things. Like magicked tea services, quills, household utensils, instruments. But sometimes I get the interesting stuff like family jewellery or looking glasses, enhanced with sometimes the most wonderous spellwork. You see, these things are often inherited over generations on end, and charms have changed over time. Not only which ones are used, but also
One night, Draco was adamant while he was talking to Ron and Hermione who had come over to have dinner with them; adamant that Rosy and Daisy would be great friends and that there wasn’t a too soon for a sleep-over between besties, and while Draco told Hermione all about Daisy’s habits and her predilection for morning cuddles, Ron wiggled his eyebrows at Harry, and Harry felt his cheeks heating in response.
,” Draco answered, pushing a droplet of condensation across the bar with the pad of his finger. “And I’m not their biggest fan, simply the one with the deepest pockets.” In spite of himself, Draco made a self-deprecating snort. “And shouldn’t you be somewhere signing autographs or posing for a solid-gold statue? Isn’t that what Saviours are supposed to do with their time?”
"Oh, hell. It's hideous. My singing voice is completely embarrassing. It's fun to watch though. I've been to karaoke bars several times."
They prepare breakfast together and they work in the atelier or the house. They sometimes get lazy or distracted with each other up to the point that Draco has to rise early in the morning to get his commissions finished in time. They read together, and they listen to music and talk about every subject under the sun while doing so. They sometimes end up making out on the settee or dancing together in the drawing room and, sometimes, Harry would faintly think how their fun could be enhanced by a few grams of snow-white powder. They make a habit out of using Draco’s sex toy. Harry has never felt more wanted than in those moments Draco looks at him with dilated pupils, his movements slow and idle as though he wants to slow Harry down and never in his life do anything else again than have Harry orgasm for him.Draco himself often stays utterly untouched until Harry begs him to get one of their pricks into the other one’s arse.
to her in his unmusical voice and he’d warm her bottle of milk with a magic spell. He’d rub her back with little circles, and let her sleep across his chest.
Malfoy’s eyebrows rise. The gears grind behind tufts of silken, white hair, swept back from his forehead, draped over his temples towards his ear in a beautiful wave. Harry hates feeling so bloody nervous, but he sometimes gets like that shortly after the first line. He didn’t keep track of time, but the cocaine should take by now.
But Draco wouldn’t be Draco if he didn’t research the charms embedded within the tray. After trying and to his chastisement failing to understand how exactly the embedded charms and transfigurations work, he contacted a few colleagues via owl, mentioned that he can’t wait for these iPhone-things to really become a thing in the wizarding world for the sheer convenience of real-time communication, and finally, he found a professor who has seen such a charmed tray before.
“Perce needs a Dom,” Ron has joked, miming the crack of a whip to our hoots of laughter. “That’d loosen the bugger up a bit.”
It was the first time Father didn’t recognise me. Or at least I think he didn’t. He looked at me with a rather stern, lordly gaze when I came in, and the expression was a cruel juxtaposition to the way he sat at that small table in his room, sweaty, unkempt hair, with more grey stubble than I have ever seen on him. And he didn’t speak first, no matter what I said. Frankly, it was hard to find anything to talk about. My past weeks had been quite dire, and I didn’t want to talk about anything negative.
Ironically, the only thing that took my mind off my gloomy thoughts ever since the check-up was Potter. Of course! It’s always stupid Potter with his golden prick and his cooking dinner and cajoling me.
I think he enjoyed it just as much as I did. He came before I did, hands shooting to my hips to pause my movements as he was pumping his release into me with his forehead on my shoulder, panting and repeating my name in that mellifluous timbre of his voice. I was jerking off to the feeling, delaying and delaying as long as I could bear it. “Hold me,” I told him, just in time, a second before I spurted, and he hugged me fiercely, almost restraining me with a tight grip around my chest and middle while I climaxed, a repetition of
“Look, there’s a tit,” Harry says, full of wonder as he watches the little bird perch on a delicate branch of the hedge Harry spent the last hour trimming.
