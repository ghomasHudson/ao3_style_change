Clark is quoting William Penn re: popularity.
“Dad!” someone shouted. One of the girls was crying in great, racking sobs and footsteps pattered down the corridor, until all the children burst into the dining room. Draco turned to see the children all clustered before him, Rose at the front of the pack with her hand outstretched, an odd stepped shape to her wrist. It was clearly broken.
“Hm,” Professor Malfoy agreed. “The powdered hooves lend their strength, and also, more practically, give a pleasing consistency to the potion so that it can more easily be applied. Unfortunately, Moilygags are difficult to find and harder still to kill, so the poultice is not easily created, especially in any sort of abundance.”
“Oh,” Harry said carefully. “I’m glad she's been a good friend to you.”
“I take back every remark I made about your intuition, you’re as oblivious as a stone,” Draco growled into Harry’s neck. “It’s insufferable being near you, sometimes. I had fucking plans to get you alone and then bloody Weasley had to show up.”
Clark was angry, though. His face was pinched and he wouldn’t look at anyone, and wouldn’t wear his colourful Christmas cracker crown or even read Jared the joke. Jared wished he was in Year One, so that he could read it himself. He could only make out a few words on the whole thing: ‘
“No, that’s the thing! I
Harry sighed, relaxing his grip so he could run a soothing palm down Draco’s back. He felt fucking helpless.
Footsteps echoed and Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and they turned to run. Hermione and Ron must have come to the same conclusion because they hurried down the stairs also. They tore through the hallways, Ron and Hermione earning confused looks from startled students.
Ri had the decency to look alarmed. “Don’t be daft. Having to organize a great lot of sniveling
charm to lube up his cock and Draco's hole. He eased the head between Draco’s fiery cheeks.
Harry was taken aback, it all suddenly felt less like a game and more like something important. Something he needed to do for the other boy, and what's more he wanted to. It felt like an inseverable tether between them.
“Oh,” Jamie considered. “I suppose you do.”
When Hops circled back with the Slytherin boys, who were looking slightly more confident, Harry set up a simple quaffle-only scrimmage, sending Hops and Rundle off to practice with a bludger.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s perfectly alright,” Scorpius insisted, even though they both knew it wasn’t. He sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed, attempting to look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
“Well, it can.”
“Just so long as you keep cooperating,” Harry replied.
CWs: references to sex and a D/s dynamic (all prior to the first ***). Reference to a canonical homicide.
“Well,” Harry exhaled at last, running a nervous hand through his hair. “There’s some war stories for you, I suppose.” He gave an unsteady smile. “Do you wish I’d told you earlier?”
like it. I find it...satisfying. Oh, Merlin, that sounds filthy, I don’t mean anything like that. It’s like...emotionally speaking. I just...really like it. Fuck, I don’t know what I mean.”
Harry pulled back, resting his face on the back of his hand. He looked up at Draco, chewing his lip. “You really think it will be like that?”
"I agree," Harry responded and Malfoy's features smoothed with relief, "You are. And I can do anything I want with you, but I'd rather only do things to our mutual enjoyment."
as well as studying today, oops. Also realized I went more than 50 chapters spelling apparition wrong, how embarrassing! Apologies to the purists out there!
Draco forced himself to take a small bite of the crumble. The fresh blueberries were warm and tinged with the tartness of early harvest. The dessert felt heavy as he swallowed it down.
Harry felt a warm swell in his belly, Draco much preferred to receive affectionate terms than to use them, and Harry didn’t think he’d ever been on this end of things. He found he rather liked it. He wondered how he could get Draco to do it again.
“Off how?” He demanded shortly. “Potter was instructed to give the boy a potion—”
Scorpius felt mildly guilty for throwing mousy Bingham under the bus like that, especially when the boy didn’t even snore, but it felt like a better alternative than admitting weakness in front of James Potter, who seemed so effortlessly capable.
“Why not? Owls aren’t magic, they’re birds.”
Well. He knew where they
“Well, I guess everyone does stupid things,” Jamie offered. “I definitely wouldn’t want to be remembered for the idiotic things I believed in primary school, that’s for sure. What was it like, though—having everything you ever wanted? I don’t know why my dad opted out of that part of being rich and famous.”
“Yes, you’re real,” he agreed, nuzzling close. Draco gave him the quick, grounding kiss Harry hadn’t known he’d been seeking, and rose. Harry gave a little shudder at the loss of contact, so Draco sat down beside him, a warm arm settling on his back, thumb purposefully moving against the bare skin at the back of his neck.
Being taken care of was a foreign experience, Draco realised. After checking in on Lily and Remy, Harry had poured the tea and found some fresh biscuits left by Molly Weasley and brought them to the drawing room on a chipped saucer. Draco didn’t have much of an appetite, but Harry coaxed him into having a few sips and nibbling at a biscuit.
Percy looked caught between cowed and irate.
“I said no hands,” Harry scolded.
“And you really forgave him?”
Malfoy gave a blasé wave of his hand. “This is exactly why we’re doing this. Might as well get the first exposure treatment over with.”
“You’re such an arse,” Harry grumbled.
’ And Harry would be all accepting and open and warm, like he always was, and would likely say considerate, helpful things. Draco knew this, he did, but he couldn’t force the words past his lips. Harry had enough on his plate. He was only just finding his feet again, and he didn’t need Draco’s problems heaped atop his own. Besides, Draco took care of things. He was good at it. That’s what he’d done since he’d been virtually orphaned at eighteen and that was what he would do now. The last thing he needed was Harry thinking he wasn’t capable.

“As I said,” he began, “Astoria and I keeping separate lives suited us, but perhaps adhering to that tack was an error in judgment. Scorpius’ birth changed Astoria. It was a difficult labour and went on far too long. He was born hypoxic, and he couldn’t breathe unassisted for his first weeks of life. This was, of course, very frightening, and things didn’t get easier for quite some time. He was not a robust child, and it was made worse by the healers never seeming to be able to offer a satisfactory explanation of what exactly was the matter.”
“Stop, Harry, please,” he heard and immediately let off, looking at Draco in surprise.
“Thank you,” Harry muttered. “Truly, Ron, I appreciate it.” He squeezed his friend’s shoulder and Ron allowed the gesture. It was a start, Harry supposed. “Now, can I get you all something to drink?”
“You have been good, sweetheart, so good. I’m so proud of you. All I want is this last thing. Just once. Show me your dedication, show me you mean it, show me now, Draco.” He waited for Draco's words, the ones that would change his actions, but they didn't come and Harry didn't expect they would. He grinned against the shoulder of his stubborn Skytherin. Merlin, he loved him. And then, Harry’s orgasm slammed into him and he emptied brutally into Draco’s arse.
“Fair point,” Ron agreed congenially and then they got back to figuring out the badges and chatting and it was almost enough for Harry to forget the sinking feeling he felt every time he thought about Draco.
“Oh,” he murmured, his eyes wide and his self-possession abandoning him. “Thank you.”
“You cold, babe?” Potter’s words were heavy with sleep as he kicked down the duvet low enough so that he could yank it back up and cover their bodies. Draco bit his lip at the wholly
“Yeah, mate, I see what you mean, but couldn’t you make that decision after this damn blue moon? When you’re less stressed? Maybe if you just sleep on it for a few more nights then you’ll feel differently!” It was late in the evening the day before the second full moon in April, and really they should be going to bed early so they could be up at dawn, rather than watching the fire and getting drunk on Firewhisky.
“Of course, darling.”
Harry sprinted towards Malfoy, anger and concern battling for primacy within him.
"You couldn't have done it earlier?" Harry didn’t know why he being argumentative when he should be showing some gratitude for the reprieve. It really was an excellent idea. Maybe it was the other man's efficient resourcefulness that chafed, as if it were directly juxtaposed with Harry’s own foolish.
“Of course, sweetpea. I’ll just see Auntie Hermione and the kids off, how about, and then I’ll pop back to say goodnight properly.”
“Yes, Harry. I will.”
“Weasley,” Draco began, the words measured and said with more kindness than he usually bothered to muster, “I think Harry’s a bit done talking about it for now. But he knows you’re there if he needs you, yeah?”
doesn’t exactly sell papers,” he pointed out.
Ron and Hermione appeared at the side of the bed then, and if Draco was embarrassed to be found cradling Harry and speaking so tenderly, he didn’t show it. Harry could only shake his head, emotions still rattling through him. He couldn’t catch his breath.
Draco transfigured one of the empty grocery bags to look like his collection kit so Daphne wouldn’t ask questions.
“Doubtful.”
Clark’s hand clamped down on Harry’s sleeve, his face a storm of anger and anxiety.
Jamie’s room was dank, stinking of teenager, unwashed sheets and not enough airflow. The boy himself was sprawled face down on his rumpled comforter. A poster of the Harpies—Ginny’s favourite team and a dream Harry wondered if she wished she’d pursued—had been torn down and was shredded into pieces on Jamie’s desk.
“Please tell me we’re all friends again,” she said, standing beside them and sliding her arm around Ron’s shoulder.
“You’d better not be attempting to spare my feelings, Potter,” Draco said. “I don’t much mind either way, I’m simply curious.”
There was a large click and a puff of purple smoke as some photographer went for the picture.
Draco cried out, thin legs reeling up and then in, heels finding purchase on the edge of the table. His hands flew out as if looking for something to grasp.
“Why would he stay?” Al demanded, his mouth full of apple. Scorpius stood beside him, examining an apple of his own.
Draco’s familiar fingers wrapped around his mug and his unfaltering gaze met Harry’s. “The thing is, Potter, I suspect we already are.”
curse is because I’m so resentful of being controlled.”
“Oh, keep your shirt on,” Charlie smirked, “things like that are just more fluid in the desert. No time for British prudery.”
“Alright there?” Draco asked gently.
“I swear we tried to stop him, mate,” Ron assured him, “but the obsession, it was all-consuming when it came to you. I mean I suppose there was the incident with the mead and me almost dying and you being the cause of that, so he was kind of right." Hermione put both hands to her face in a gesture that cearly said all her hard work was being unraveled.  So Ron barreled on, “But, you know, post-war Ron is all about burying the hatchet and working towards interhouse unity. After all, what’s a little near-death experience if it brought us three closer as friends?” Ron forced a grimace and shot a desperate, approval-seeking look at Hermione.
“Hey,” Ron reminded him, “you’re family, mate.”
“I'm aware.”
“I didn’t think it would be so hard, being home." Draco replied, after a moment, "I lived there this summer, I thought I’d pushed all the bad memories aside. We'd cleaned up, redecorated. Mum put her own touches on things. I thought it could maybe be a home for me still. Little things, though, they're hard to shake. A lot of
“And you’ll let us know if you need anything?” Harry reiterated for what was probably the twentieth time that morning.
“Hey,” James said gruffly, smoothing a bit of his dark hair over a spot forming on his forehead. Merlin, Draco was glad those days were behind him.
"No, it's Christmas, and this is your family. You should be here."
“Do you want to be hurt, or do you want to be disciplined?”
“I’m going to sleep, I think,” Draco told him.
“Are you going to be okay?” Harry asked.
James harrumphed.
“Here,” the boy said.
Clark perched on the side of his bed, eyes fixed on the rug which covered the maple hardwood of his floor. He looked like he was grinding his molars to dust.
“Morning, Malfoy,” Harry said, aiming for the pleasantness Hermione had been on about.
“Magical life isn’t like Muggle life,” Clark continued. “Ron says he grew up poorer than poor, but they all had a lovely big house and a garden and as much food as they could ever want! It’s not like that for Muggle kids, is it? Jared and me, we lived in crowded tenements, and our heat sometimes got shut off if Mum wasn’t on top of things, and whether there was food in the house depended on whether she was holding down a job, and I didn’t dare go to the food bank in case they called the Family Services people on us, so instead we’d nick things from the corner store. It wasn’t always like that, sure, but sometimes it was, and that’s a different kind of poor, you know? It wasn’t about kits for sports, or fancy jackets and shiny new school supplies! It was about getting by, and if I’d not been magic, it still would be like that, and there’s no reason why I got lucky when millions of other kids didn’t, and no one is doing anything about
“What is it?” Harry demanded. Hermione was both in the boys’ dormitory
“Right,” Harry pushed on. “And did Lavender give any indication of where she might be going?”
The boys settled, except Hugo who took the opportunity to blow a raspberry onto the back of his arm. Harry suspected the boy was hoping to make the other children laugh, but the gesture fell flat and Rose smacked her brother on the arm,  leaving him momentarily crestfallen.
Hermione shifted her attention back to her daughter. “Yes, alright. I’ll prepare a cold compress. Come on, Rosie,” she said, taking her daughter by the hand which had not suffered the injury. “The blueberry crumble should be just about ready, and I think Uncle Harry has some ice cream to go with it. And you can tell me all about what happened.”
“Yes,” Draco murmured solemnly, “That’s what I want.”
Malfoy complied, stripping off the bit of white fabric and tossing it onto the old wicker chair in the corner.
“This suddenly explains so much,” he mused, “like why you could always fucking find me in sixth year.”
“What god did I appease enough to draw you out of your lair?” Pansy Parkinson murmured in Draco’s ear. He’d been more focused on his martini than on the rest of the pub, and he startled. Pansy laughed: a tinkling sound that seemed out of place in her rather robust chest. It looked even more robust than usual. Draco rose to kiss her cheek, and shifted around to the other side of the table to pull out her chair.
Harry awoke with a start some time later, with the dreadful realization he hadn’t set any sort of alarm. He cast
Harry felt a weird flip-flop of his heart and suddenly he was tagged again and frozen on the ground, just watching.
“Lose the shirt and jumper,” Harry instructed. It gave him such a rush just to watch Draco obey, shivering slightly in the damp of the cold.
upon her. The spell took hold at once. Harry pulled at a glancing memory and followed it. A young Rowena Ravenclaw—Harry recognized her from her portrait—was striding through a copse of young birches, her daughter by her side and a basket suspended from her forearm. The two appeared to be harvesting herbs, although Harry could not understand the Gaelic-sounding language passing between the two. The Ravenclaw founder crouched to pluck a leaf from a bilberry shrub, rolling it between her fingers and lecturing the bright-eyed, dark haired girl beside her. She passed the pilled greenery to Helena, who examined it thoughtfully. Her mother smiled, watching her.
CWs: alcohol use, intoxication, canon-typical violence, ableist language.
“I know. I wasn’t exactly thrilled with how my damn libido reacted to seeing you again, either.”
When the production at last came to an end, Harry applauded loudly, whole-heartedly commending his daughter and niece for their performances.
“What is an idiosyncrasy of yours?”
“I know,” Scorpius said. “Al and I figured it out. You would have been in the same year, yeah?”
“They’ll be along later. You were passed out with your legs sticking out from under Ginny’s bed, so I offered to bring you home.” Jared thought Ginny might be one of the not-a-kid-but-not-a-grown-up types.
Draco ignored him, cupping Harry’s dick through his trousers, kissing along the fabric, lips parted.
“Perhaps he had better magical control then. It’s not like you’ve been honing your skills.” Harry bristled at Draco's words. It wasn't as though anyone had taught him how to do this; he was flying a bit blind and it wasn't helpful for Draco to point fingers.
and Harry couldn’t place him.
“A git!” Harry choked. “He nearly murdered Ron, and Katie Bell, and Dumbledore! That’s hardly nothing!”
“Yes, yes, alright, point taken,” Harry agreed. “You’re hardly subtle, you know.”
"Hrm," Draco muttered, firing a freezing hex at the portrait. It had no effect.
It took Harry and Ron quite some time to reach the great hall. Harry had to stop every dozen steps to catch breath that wouldn’t be caught. When they did arrive, Madam Pomfrey had things well in hand. The whole hall was transformed into a field hospital: ordered cots occupied by first and second year boys still cocooned in their bubbles took the place of tables and benches. There a queue of older Slytherins and other students who had helped with combating the fiendfyre forming to be checked over.
He looked ahead only to see Malfoy hurtling towards him, coursing the the air in an elegant arch, green and scarlet stick in his hands, determination writ large on his features.
“I think she might be right,” Harry explained, “Draco’s still a target.”
“I’m making the decisions right now,” Harry informed him, “not you.”
Harry wandered off, presumably to put Remy in his cot. Draco couldn’t help but fire off a couple of Mrs. Warble’s miraculous cleaning charms on Potter’s crumb-covered counters.
“You said I owed you a war story, that I’d said something that made you curious, only I can’t sort out what you were talking about.”
The two older boys chaperoned Clark back to the entrance to the Slytherin dorm, Draco insisting they take common routes.  “Good, you've now been seen with Harry,” he explained, “When people ask, just shrug and say he’s helping you with some more advanced spells. Then change the subject, play it cool. Don’t answer follow-up questions.”
“Come on,” Potter ordered, turning.
“Yes. Well. We did.”
Clark sucked one corner of his lip into his mouth, sinking his teeth into it, considering. “I guess I didn’t think of it that way. But what if...what if there ought to be a change, a revolution?”
Harry couldn’t have resisted if he tried.
to keep her eye on the mock snitches though, and missed far more than she caught. The contemplative Magnolia Sitthi, however, was sharp as a hawk, and didn’t miss a beat. Harry was right pleased with her skills.
“Yeah, alright—oh wait, no, I can’t! I’m assisting Professor Malfoy with Potions prep tonight, as his new assistant and all.”
Charlie entered the living room and sat down on the sofa across from Harry. He had two pints in hand and slid one over. The movement startled Constance and she flapped her massive wings, resuming her perch atop the clock.
“Thanks,” he told Ron instead. “Truly. I appreciate it.”
“I know,” Harry ground out, gesturing Draco away as he tried to step in. These parallel realities were unsteadying, it was all Harry could do to hang onto one. “You think I don’t know that? You think I don’t think about everyone who died for me every single day that I am alive?”
“Shit, babe, are you alright?” Harry implored, instantly dropping his swaggering play act. His hand flew up to cup Draco’s face. He was an instant away from recalling his magic and cradling the man to him when Draco emitted a huff of irritation.
“Leave it,” Malfoy snarled, voice low.
“A couple of Ron's older brothers, I think. I just didn’t really figure it out until Christmas. And not so much now that I am older and know them better. Just, when I was kid, I thought they were so cool and fit and I didn’t really put it together.”
“Sirius,” Harry said, “but he’s been expunged from the tree, I doubt he’s in there.”
“Not that she was violent or vindictive like this in life,” Hermione was quick to correct him, “but it was a bit of her essence so I can sort of, er, see it, I suppose.”
The little verbal tic was clearly adopted from Potter’s boys, and Draco tried not to be irritated by it.
Draco cleared his throat and Weasley looked his way. His congenial face shuttered, cold professionalism taking its place.
“Why’s that?”
Draco eyed it, warily. “I don’t like being tied up,” he reminded Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Perhaps,” Father replied. “Perhaps not. It’s important to have...friends, Scorpius. I think I’d forgotten that.”
“I’ll write my own spell books eventually,” Ri surmised. “And then I’ll accept bi-monthly post praising my intellect.”
“Not going to be an issue, no one talks to me,” was Clark’s glum reply.
Harry went for Malfoy’s throat. The movement was instinctive, thoughtless. There was nothing but the need to drag his teeth along the faint trace of bruising. As he did, Malfoy’s breath rasped in Harry’s ear. Malfoy extended his neck, granting access, and pressed forward until their bodies were flush. Harry soothed the reddening skin beneath his teeth with his lips, desperately wanting to leave sucking kisses in his wake, but knowing Malfoy’s sensibilities would never allow something as gauche or juvenile as love bites—at least not where they could so easily be seen. Harry shifted instead, finding the underside of Malfoy’s jaw, then, finally, his mouth.
Professor Malfoy laughed: a quiet rumble that Jamie hadn’t heard often. “Didn’t your father teach you it’s rude to ask such questions?”
Draco, unsurprisingly, did not keep his feelings about the Tube to himself.
“I should ask what’s bothering you, but I suspect I already know.”
Harry’s words were quiet and earnest when he replied: “No, I don't suppose it was. I suspect that what you were expecting was to be shamed and degraded and told horrible, demeaning lies about yourself.” Draco didn’t answer, just hid his face in Harry’s chest. “You’re not those things,” Harry promised, easing his arms around Draco.“Whatever you were telling yourself, whatever you were expecting to hear. Yes, you hurt me, you lied and were deceitful, injured my trust. Because that’s what you knew. That’s what you thought you had to work with. It’s not because you're fundamentally flawed or morally corrupt, or a coward or a disappointment. It’s because no one ever gave you a chance to fucking be anything else. But I know better. I know you can be clever and crafty, certainly, but you can also be strong and courageous and forbearing. You can be loving and generous and considerate and kind—”
“Am I?” Draco demanded, confused.
There was another long moment and Draco wondered what on earth he was supposed to say. Thankfully, Clark spoke again before he had to come up with something.
“Merlin, he told you that as a child?”
“So much, babe,” Harry promised him, squeezing his neck, kissing his shoulders, “Sometimes I want your orgasms all to myself. I think about not even letting you get yourself off. Making you entirely dependent on me for your pleasure.” Draco shuddered against him.
“Yes?” Draco said, sweeping around majestically, as if he had very important places to be and very little time.
“Are the first years bearing up alright?” Harry asked.
“It fills a need.”
sorry,” Scorpius said saccharinely. “How clumsy of me. I’m sure it’s fine, but Fife, I would keep an eye on your tongue for the next few days, if I were you.”
!” Jamie demanded. Everything was always such a production with these two.
It had been two weeks. Draco’s quidditch team was down to only seven players, but his star player, Viola McCracken, was still diligently attending practices and the Occamies were winning game after game. Rumour had it the Ravenclaw team had offered her a spot and she’d turned them down in favour of the rec league. Only Claire had walked from Harry’s team, and he suspected she might make an excuse for returning, from the way she always happened to be walking the grounds during practices.
“You’ve got a dopey look on your face,” Clark informed him.
Draco handed him a mattress protector and white sheet with small, grey stars printed on it.
Harry didn’t suppose there was any good in lying. “Probably,” he shrugged. “A bloke likes to know he’s missed.”
“Think I might fuck your mouth, with you here, just like this,” Harry considered, “completely trapped. What do you think, would you be good for me?”
“Happy?”
“I’m sorry!” Ron sighed, scrubbing a palm over his reddening face. “I’d had a beer too many and what I said was fucking inexcusable. You must know I didn’t mean it, it was hot air, Wizard’s honour. All I wanted was to piss you off, make you back down. I’d never harm a kid, Malfoy, not ever. I’m all talk, ask Harry.”
“I’m alright, you don’t have to worry,” he offered, trying to calm him.
“And hiding.”
“Were you there?” Hermione demanded in a hushed voice when she and Ron found Harry and Draco at what seemed to have become their regular table in the back corner of the room, “I thought I heard you, but, my word, Harry, your disillusionment charm has gotten excellent.”
“It’s a simple problem with a simple solution,” Draco advised, “there are few of those in life; enjoy them when you can.”
“Don’t get service like this at the ASDA,” Clark marveled.
“Sure,” James replied warily, clearly not convinced. “So what are you doing here?”
“Er,” Harry said, honestly not knowing how many days he’d been going at this whole family thing alone. “Late June? Just after the kids came home for the break. I guess she wanted to say goodbye.”
“Just promise you won’t answer the door naked,” Clark grumbled.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Harry asked, like he actually wanted to know.
Harry felt he had lived a hundred days without sleep by the time he collapsed onto his bed. He didn’t sleep in the master bedroom, it felt too weird. He chose instead a corner room that looked out onto the street. It wasn’t too big or intimidating but it still had a bed large enough to fit him and Draco comfortably. He had set Clark up in a room a few doors down.
“Rightfully so!” asserted Megan Jones, the ever-ingratiating former Hufflepuff, "Didn't see you single-handedly winning any wars, Malfoy."
Harry truly hadn’t
Thankfully, Bingham seemed unable to keep the news to himself.
“That’s how the rumour of our whereabouts got out, I suppose?”
(See the end of the chapter for
She ushered them to a small side office which, shockingly, had adequate lighting. The lot of them blinked and squinted while the witch, who Harry supposed was the
“I was here for an appointment myself,” Harry explained, “So it made sense.”
“I know that,” Draco states firmly. “You’re very considerate; we both think so.”
He shoved his books back into his bag and got to his feet, making for the door.
“Thank you, Weasley,” Draco said graciously. “Having used a slur or two in my lifetime, I understand the impetus.”
“And the other thing?” Harry asked, mostly just to let Ron off the hook. “You know, you choosing Neville or…” He trailed off, not sure how much Ginny had shared.
“I thought about what you said,” Draco mentioned softly, still not looking at him, “and I suppose you’re right. It would help things along if people weren’t arseholes without reason. Even if Clark’s hair is truly horrible, I don’t want anyone giving him shit, for that or anything else.”
Harry laughed, “Oh, Merlin, what’s he done?”
With a put-upon sigh, Draco allowed his muscles to release minutely, tucking his head against Harry’s collarbone and trying hard not to think about the absurdity of the position.
?" Atwal sputtered, "My dad said there were barely any left! But I guess he'd have to be to teach you in the first place. Merlin, I still can’t believe you got those lessons. I'm older and near top of my class besides. It's hardly fair you should get preferred treatment."
“We do,” Draco conceded. “You would rather we didn’t?”
“I should hope,” Harry replied coolly, “that I would have protected anyone like that.”
Clark sat there for a long few minutes, watching Draco reading over Jared’s shoulder, muttering, “Turn,” every once in a while.
Hermione shifted beside him, dropping her head on his shoulder. Harry pressed his cheek to her hair as the last of his melancholy ripened into hope.
Clark made a horrified noise and everyone turned to look at him. “You can’t intend to just leave her in there,” he exclaimed.
!” called out Hermione, and the jinx was snapped out of the air by the shielding spell.
“You can now. And I see,” Draco drawled. “So you’re worried that I will somehow be upset with you for not suddenly lusting after men, do I have this right?”
“Yes! First a student tried to
“I’m simply desperate to see you set up with the most glorious collection of well fitted jumpers," Draco confessed, "Solely for my own aesthetic gratification.”
“Enough, Potter,” Malfoy hissed. He made a sudden, irregular movement, increasing his pace to escape Harry or the conversation or both, but his knee gave way and he started to pitch forward, towards the final steps.
are strangers who fail to realise that recognising and knowing are two very different things. I would imagine it is a great deal more unnerving.”
“Everything alright?” Draco murmured, groggily.
“Harry, check on the other children, will you? Make sure they’re not too stirred up by all the commotion?”
“You will?” Jamie inquired, surprised. Ri was usually unwilling to stick his neck out for anything.
He stepped in, Draco at his back.
“I want to be hurt.”
and then pressed Malfoy down into the bed rolling him onto his side and curling around him. He was so hard it hurt. The anticipation was blisteringly intense.
upwards, scanning his environment, senses piqued for any sights or sounds of movement.
“Alright. So. You’ve been attracted to blokes. You’ve fucked one—many, many times, I might add—and unless I’m totally delusional, it certainly seems to get you off. I think those things alone more than fulfill any requirements when it comes to you being queer. And even if they didn't, there's no secret auror force coming for you to dub you lacking in flamboyance. Clueless, jock queers are just as acceptable as the Tennyson types, right? Look at Finnegan and Thomas.”
“I said I would, didn’t I?”
Draco stirred the olives in his martini. “There’s not much to tell, really,” he admitted. “Scorpius and one of Potter’s boys are friendly; Potter’s wife said he was welcome to come stay while I’m in Brazil.”
“I can’t believe I’m dirtying my clothes like this,” he whinged, dropping them on the dusty floor.
They arrived at the stairway to the tower. A flood of memories threatened to overwhelm him, but Harry had been carefully pushing those back since the beginning of term, not allowing himself to summon any images that might lead to thoughts of the war. The first week had been difficult, but Draco had been right: One could adjust. Sometimes the final battle felt very far away, and sometimes it felt entirely too recent. Harry didn’t think he had it in him to glimpse the entrance to the Gryffindor common room, though, not tonight.
“You have a home with us, Tiering,” Draco said. “Even if Potter and I went our separate ways, which we’re not going to do, then you’d just have two homes. We promised, and Harry’s never gone back on his word in his entire life, and I’m trying my best to follow his example. I know we’re hardly your Mum, but you have us nonetheless.”
Harry was sure he’d not even known you could buy that in regular shops. Then again, Malfoy probably avoided regular shops in favour of specialty butchers’ and cheesemongers’ or something equally pretentious.
“I usually am,” he agreed.
McGonagall smiled indulgently at him, “This is unfortunately not an anomaly; every year many students from each house struggle to make the transition. It is only October; I’m sure by the holiday break we will have far fewer lonely souls. And your Quidditch idea is a strong one, I think. I will allow first years to fly outside of lessons if accompanied by a sixth year or higher, and,” she said, passing a large brass key across her desk to Ron, “Here’s a key to the broom storage and Quidditch equipment shed, for your use only, Mr. Weasley—you will be held responsible for the dispersing and collecting of supplies to those without their own.”
“That she was mad at.”
“Harry!” He said, “They said someone would be round to get me.”
Harry remembered the silly experiment they'd dreamt up one of those long afternoons in bed a few days prior. "Tomorrow at midnight?”
, in a way which was more appealing than it ought to have been. Bloody hell, Draco liked the sheer breadth of him, the square shoulders and those solid, powerful thighs, the evidence of all that physical strength Harry never used for harm. Draco wanted nothing more but to be overwhelmed by it all. “More than fine actually.”
It didn’t come. Potter chuckled good-naturedly instead. “Is anyone around you?”
“Fine,” Malfoy muttered. “Maybe I did. I’ve allowed myself to become quite isolated in the past few years. I suppose it was nice to...not do that.”
Harry trailed his hand over the back of Draco’s head, his neck, following the curves and ridges of his spine until they disappeared. Sweat soaked through Draco’s shirt in little patches. Draco sank further, onto his elbows, his head hanging between his arms. Harry pressed his palm against the small of his back, rubbing small circles.
“Why don’t you go get showered and dressed, Potter? I’m sure I can entertain myself well enough in the meantime.”
They approached the counter and the same shopkeeper tallied up Harry’s items.
Harry slid his gaze along Draco's jaw to the bony chin. It gave him a swell of affection which helped blot out the noise. “A bit, yeah.”
“I...thought they were just mates.”
“Did what again?” Harry asked, unable to comprehend just what the boy was speaking of.
“I know what you’re trying to do,” Weasley declared from across the table. He was a big man, finally having grown into his gangly limbs, and he had a few inches on Harry. His arms were crossed over his broad chest, firm Auror muscles visible below the short sleeves of his T-shirt. It was a revolting display of aggressive masculinity, Draco determined.
“Boys, that’s enough,” Harry said sternly. He was relieved he was able to keep from shouting again. “A bottle. Please.”
“Oh, Harry,” she said. “That was beautiful.”
“No,” Draco muttered, “No, it’s not that that, it’s...it’s fucked up."
before beginning instruction, first teaching the word, and then showing the accompanying wand action. He described helpful visualisation tactics: rushing waterfalls, ocean depths, heavy rains, and then set the students to practicing. He and Harry then strolled the lines, examining and correcting technique.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Draco said, his jaw set.
“Huh?” Harry asked, not fully registering the words.
The following morning brought a
Draco went to complain, but before he could, Harry had him gripped firmly by the jaw.
“Right,” Harry said, “that happen often?”
Draco didn’t let him finish, stepping in close and fitting their mouths together with an urgency that had been mounting in him all morning. Gripping Harry’s shirt, he forced him backwards, until his back was pressed against the mantle. Harry’s hands came to his waist with a gratifying weight, and he returned the kiss with enthusiasm.
"Nothing at all about my vampirism, I'm afraid," Scorpius told him.
“Enormously,” Ri responded, a prim smile forming on his delicate features. Instead of getting to it, however, Ri took a long moment to position himself on the non-shredded end of the chesterfield, tucking his legs beneath him. Fort followed suit, kicking off her trainers and sprawling out with her back against the tattered end. She wriggled her toes under Ri’s thigh, which earnt her another glare that she easily ignored. Jamie only rolled his eyes. The kneazle in the sculpture flicked its tail impatiently.
“I suppose that checks out. You and him always did have a little
“And school begins in two days. Won’t hurt to get used to early nights and early mornings,” Draco said firmly.
“Aye, Harry Potter, Breety knows,” she again smiled that toothless smile at him, “Little Clark Tiering is a newly sorted Slytherin.” She lowered her voice and beckoned him closer, “Sometimes needs his sheets changed more than others, poor lad, Breety thinks he’s having a hard time of things.”
And then he took off, fleeing through the classroom door.
“Sorry,” Harry said to Malfoy. “You were saying?” He repositioned Remy and looked up. Merlin, how long had it been? There’d been the brief sighting at the Hogwarts Express in the autumn, but Harry hadn’t had a chance to really observe the man then. He was still lean, still pale and blond, and somehow less ferrety, which felt like an injustice. Harry knew he had worcestershire sauce and baby vomit on his shirt, that he’d not showered in maybe three days, and he couldn’t actually remember how long ago he’d bought this particular pair of trousers, but they were certainly fitting more snugly now than they did when he had. Malfoy looked perfectly put together: his clothing smartly pressed, his face an immovable mask of poise, save for the amused quirk of one eyebrow.
“If you’re sure,” he agreed. “Oh, and Lily can have a new book or two. She always feels left out this time of year.
“I’m sure you have,” Lavender replied. “I’m quite cross with you, you know.”
Draco didn’t respond, his icy eyes only skimmed Harry’s face, assessingly.
“I don't suppose my uncle Vernon would have been thrilled with me either," Harry reflected slowly, “not that he was ever thrilled with me. I just never gave blokes with blokes much thought, and...I think there are a lot of things I don’t know when it comes to all this.”
The pale blond boy shriveled impossibly backwards. “Leave me alone,” he whispered. His face was towards Harry now, but he still didn’t seem to quite see him. “I’ll not tell you anything.”
“Sorry,” Harry muttered, relaxing the tight grip he had on the other boy’s bicep, “alright?”
“Better than I wanted to,” Harry admitted, “part of me wanted to lash out or interrogate them, find out if they are connected to all this Slytherin business.”
“It’s nothing unsafe, though, right?” Harry said, voice serious. “I don’t want you putting Scorpius at risk.”
“Yes, well, I got over it rather quickly, or perhaps I directed that energy towards tormenting Weasley,” Draco admitted. “Thus proving it a myth that we become flawless, reason-driven machines upon achieving a certain age.”
The assignment was an interesting one, at least. Connection Cordial,
“By all means.”
“Why Professor,” Draco murmured facetiously, keeping his voice low enough that Harry would have to lean in to catch the words, “am I in for a scolding?”
“It helps?” Harry pushed, gently slotting his mouth against Draco’s.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed, “What do you mean? You love school. You’ve so much to look forward to: Quidditch and all your friends and assisting Professor Malfoy…”
“No,” Draco replied coolly, his unimpressed gaze alighting on Harry. “I was under the impression I was invited for dinner.”
“Why I want you around. But I do. These past couple of days, sorting through the house, I wanted to talk to you, get your perspective on things, you know? The house was quiet, I just wanted to sit in the drawing room after dinner and have a bit of a chat.”
“Shut up!” Al hurled back.
, Fort,” Jamie reminded her.
The girl’s brown skin was pink in the cold air, and she grinned up at him, the first unbridled emotion he’d ever seen grace her usually reserved features. He patted her shoulder while they all circled round.
“Mm,” Harry acknowledged, “I’m sure it does. Not too late to change your mind.”
“He was lovely,” Fischel assured Harry. “They stayed up whispering until far too late, so my apologies if he crashes later.”
“I know you didn’t,” Harry said kindly, “Draco’s just being protective.”
“Very well done,” Granger agreed from the bed. “Brilliant! Stunning! Such commitment!”
Harry cleared his throat. “It’s no problem. Well,” Harry began, but was at once interrupted by Remy’s shrieks from his playmat beside the dining room table.
“Pansy and I have been through the post you picked up from Hogsmeade last time,” Hermione told Harry that evening, handing him a slim stack of letters, “I think these are the ones you might want to see.”
“Don’t be coy, Granger,” Draco said. “Potter’s right.”
"Well, nice thing about words. You can say them over and over again as much as you like. Until they stick."
Harry felt cool, slender fingers cup his burning face. “Bloody hell, Harry. You really ought to just let me go.”
?” Fife demanded, with an irritatingly practiced accent. He sounded jealous. Al suddenly very much wanted that to have been the carnival Scorpius had attended.
“We think a cwalus is threatening the school,” he admitted, “And all the information we can find preaches avoidance. Since we can't move Hogwarts, we need another way to stop her.”
It was reassuring to hear, Harry admitted. “Thanks, love,” he said, sinking back against the sofa cushions, and digging out a comic from under his thigh and tossing it aside. “Here, I can take Remy if you want to go say hello to the boys. Albus is forever scarpering off with Scorpius Malfoy, whispering madly and writing things in his notebook, but Jamie should be around. With any luck he’ll be a bit more pleasant with you than he is me.”
“I’m sorry,” he said again. “I’m sorry you’ve had to watch us live on, to get to do all the things you never will. I hate it. Every day, I hate it. I hate it and I don’t understand it and I don’t think I’ll ever come to terms with it. I think it always hurts. And if you carry on in this way, if you pursue your anger and revenge, you’ll just spread that hurt, amplify it, and for what? I’ve gotten my revenge: Voldemort’s dead and I’m still living, but that’s not what spurs me forward. We needed him gone, yes, but the simple fact of his death adds nothing to the richness of my life, just as I doubt hurting dozens of kids will give meaning to your death.”
Again, he led Harry and Clark through a cursory meditation and then Harry went to it, hopping into Clark’s thoughts. Clark immediately cast the counterspell,  and Harry found himself, for the first time with Tiering, in a completely black void.
“Fuck,” Harry murmured again into Draco’s chest, but when he looked up, he was grinning sheepishly. “That sounds pretty perfect, actually.”
“I doubt there’s anything Harry wouldn’t do for that ridiculous bird,” Draco murmured fondly. “Or for you.”
“Oh, ah…” Harry grimaced as his mind went blank and he started rummaging through his pockets for the letter from Headmistress Clearwater.
Professor Haberdash-Pewter blinked slowly, a smile forming on her lips like an uncurling vine.
“I haven’t seen or spoken to Lucius Malfoy since his sentencing, and neither has Draco,” Harry reminded her. “But that isn’t what I’m here to discuss. Clark’s missing, he’s a first year Slytherin and it’s the full moon. If you see him, please would you tell him I’m looking for him?”
“It’s hard for anyone, and for adults particularly, to admit their mistakes and their shortcomings,” Draco explains gently. “Sometimes it feels easier not to face them at all.”
“No,” Harry answered. “I know she’s safe, Ron’s told me so. I don’t know where she is, I don’t need to know, but there's no foul play." He didn't admit that he almost wished there was, because that would mean she hadn't meant it, hadn't just up and gone and left them all devastated. "She just...couldn’t do all this, I suppose.”
Jamie felt as though he’d had a bellyful of cold lead. He’d never properly thought about what being a Vates could mean for Scorpius.
“No. I don’t want our room associated with punishment.”
“You may,” Harry agreed, and for a second Draco’s heart skittered, half in excitement, half in disappointment that this all would be ending so soon. It was a paltry bit of begging, after all. “But you can’t use your hands to do so. You’ll have to rut against me like an animal.”
A hint of panic sparked in Draco. Fuck, that was not what he was intending to convey. He repressed the reaction, convincing himself this was just another manifestation of Harry's anxieties. “I don’t think seduction is the typical method of atonement,” he pointed out, forcing a calm sort of amusement. “I can assure you that my motives were much more selfish.”
“Why not?” Lily asked. Harry could tell it was going to be a longer conversation than he’d been hoping for. “Because you’re pure of heart?”
“Listen, love,” Harry tried, hoping to broker some peace between them. Jamie’s gaze became impossibly icier, his shoulders tensing.
Potter was once again in need of rescuing.
“What?” Draco demanded. He was annoyed with her evaluation, but also more drawn in than he cared to admit.
Edward had never been one for telling tales, and Draco had a difficult time believing him to be dishonest now, even in the name of protecting his godfather.
“I’ll tell you some of the adventures another time,” Harry promised. “Like how we broke into Gringotts and escaped on the back of a dragon.”
Crookshanks’ tail thwapped one way then the other, landing on the astronomy tower.
Draco’s arm tightened around his middle. “What’re you doing?” He murmured into Harry’s neck.
. He always says crap things like it is ‘just me wishing I was important when really I’m nobody and I’m always going to be nobody’.”
Thanks for your comments and your luck for exams. I'll need it because I did this
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shook his head, “I wish I knew, maybe she did just forget the dates, she does come across as a bit scattered. My guess is she is having an episode of sorts, but I don’t know enough about it. If we can’t reach her tomorrow, we’ll have to call social services, they should at least look into the welfare of his brother. But what if then Clark has to spend Christmas in some sort of muggle foster situation? Merlin, it would be better for him to just go back to school than that.”
Harry spent a long time in the shower late that night, hot water streaming over him. He wore his soap down to a little sliver. All those unwanted hugs, the pressure of bodies, his own ingratitude. It was all slathered across him, heavy as tar: their stories, their tears, their expectations. He wasn’t sure he’d ever be able to scrub their grief off of him.
But he wasn’t about to confess to something like that.
“She’s been doing well, this term,” Draco reminds him from his favourite wingback chair. He's as certain and unshakeable as a monarch on a throne. “We’ve received regular post from her; she’s gotten used to sending and receiving messages via Metatron.”
"Thanks," Hermione agreed. "Good idea."
“Yes, yes, well, leave me the volume you had. I don't trust your abilities to glean much from it anyway.”
Draco gave a great, loud sigh and crossed the distance between them. He took Harry’s collar loosely in his hands and fussed with it. “Oh, don’t you dare, Potter. I’m not blaming you for your reaction, you know that’s not what I meant. I certainly don’t want an apology.”
“It’s not—”
They’d won. And even if it wasn't the damn quarterfinals, and it was only rec league, and it didn't at all matter, it felt glorious.
in all the kissing. And then Harry had thrown the scraps of his dignity to the wind and begged Malfoy to stay the night. In Harry’s bed. No, in Harry and Ginny’s bed. Staying the night was the least of it, Harry had to admit to himself, because in reality, Malfoy had
Just as quickly as they had descended, the owls departed.
Draco shook his head at the bizarre exchange. He was well aware that things had changed since the Emancipation Agreement that Granger-Weasley had pushed through during her time sitting on the post-war Emergency Council, but Pansy and Floriandra's dichotomy still felt a bit surreal.
“I’ll have the tomato basil bisque,” Draco determined.
Hermione was silent for a long moment, examining a slender crow’s feather quill.
Thanks for your patience, everyone! This chapter is extra long to make up for the wait!
and he wasn't even at Hogwarts right now anyway. But he could swear he could still taste ash in his mouth and singed air in his lungs and being alone in his bed was the last thing he could stand just now.
“I’m just not sure I want to take care of anyone right now,” Ginny was saying, “maybe not ever. It will take a lot of work to train Neville out of those expectations. I just know I’ll be constantly having to remind him to pick up after himself. His Gran was strict, but she still did everything for you, him know? I doubt he’ll do things without me having to ask. It feels like a lot of work. Daphne has no such ideas. She’s been raised with house elves, so she’ll go that route, or hire help; she’s not interested in domesticity. She’s brilliant with maths and charms and makes such clever little inventions. I feel like I could live a life alongside hers, that we could be independent in a way I’m not sure Neville and I could. I don’t even think Daphne would be fussed if I saw other people.”
The path was overlaid across a series of duller ones, like little pools of gold dotting a sandscape. It led towards the dungeons.
“If she doesn’t, she’ll know who to ask. I’ll send a note with Metatron when he returns. Don’t suppose that phoenix of yours does post?”
“Because he’s a bloke?”
with it?” Teased Teddy.
“We’re not apparating into Surrey in the middle of the day, especially during the holidays when half the neighbourhood will be peering out their windows instead of going to work,” Harry reminded him. “Besides, I told you you would hate it and that you didn’t have to come with me.”
“You know, I first met Draco right where you are standing now,” Harry told Clark.
is a very advanced spell, surely you didn’t teach yourself that?”
Harry shrugged, “It was. But I’m feeling loads better now. Just a little embarrassed for putting everyone through that and wasting your time. So, er, sorry.”
“That's who I spent the night with. Potter.”
“Bloody lot of good it did,” Draco murmured bitterly.
“Why, Draco,” Harry murmured as he slid his hand into Malfoy’s beneath the table, “that was practically civil.”
Hermione appeared then, sliding in between Ron and Ginny.
How was he supposed to proceed with this damnable clever child? Too much potential was a dangerous thing, Scorpius’ gift—or, rather, his curse—reminded Draco of that daily. And what if Albus’ magic expanded and his power grew to match that of his father’s? Such a thing wasn’t typical, thankfully. One’s magical aptitude was fairly concrete from birth, honed with practice but not augmented. Nevertheless, Potters had a way of defying expectations. Merlin, Draco would have to have a conversation with Harry about all this, and sooner, rather than later. Albus was a Slytherin, after all, and ambition, power, and skill could be deadly, as Draco well knew.
“They must have forgotten about this book. He’s one of the last entries, him and Regulus,” Clark said the unusual name slowly. “Here, is this him? Your godfather, I mean?”
“Yeah,” he replied, “I start tomorrow.”
at protective magic, and hurricanes are a spot of poor weather. Any other trivialising you’d care to engage in?”
Malfoy’s hand relaxed ever so slightly in his. Harry traced the fine bones of Malfoy’s thumb with the pad of his own.
“You’ll do nothing,” Harry clipped, voice cool and firm. “Gibbens, I appreciate that you presume to be looking out for me, but let me assure you that
“Maybe we could take a walk?” Ron asked.
Harry chuckled into Draco’s neck before pulling back, tracing a finger along the scar on Malfoy’s chest.
McGonagall reached out and gave Harry’s forearm a squeeze, “I’m so glad you all decided to return to Hogwarts for a final year, it has been a real pleasure to have so many returning eighth years. I suspect I’m going to miss the lot of you more than I realise.”
Harry smiled at her, “Oh, brilliant,” he remarked, reaching for and then unfurling it.
Draco bit his lip, nuzzling into Harry’s palm, eyes closed. He seemed to force his breathing to slow a bit. “Sorry, Harry,” he murmured. Fucking hell, he had to know how getting all demure like that went right to Harry’s cock.
He went to speak but Ron smacked him, “Oi, not you,
Harry’s heart sank. Draco always took these things on himself, as though if he only worked harder, studied longer, he could prevent the onslaught of death and disease single-handedly.
“I want to be with you,” Harry blurted out, his urgency to be understood bubbling over, his bounding affection suddenly too big to simply contain. “I know I said it could be casual and we’d play it by ear, and it was just a thing we were doing, but I think that’s shit, actually? It was just me hedging because I was scared, I am scared. But the truth is I want you. Just you. Is that alright? Can we do...that? Be together?”
“Harry,” Malfoy said after another pause.
“No!” Harry interrupted, too harshly. Al jumped. “Sorry. Sorry, I know you’re trying to help, Al. I...I’m just not sure I want you to never feel pain. I mean, I’m your dad, of course I don’t want you to hurt, only it’s not real life, is it? To cut away the bits you don’t want?” Al’s lip began to tremble. “Not that I’m not terribly proud of you—altering a spell at your age shows just how clever you are—but I do wish you could have talked to me about it first.”
“Good,” Harry nodded, “well, then my next question is do you want to continue with Occlumency? I think you’re doing really well, showing a lot of promise, but I know it’s uncomfortable for you, so I wanted to give you the choice.”
"You alright, acushla?" Seamus asked Dean,  who appeared a bit shaken.
“No,” Al agreed. “I can’t quite get a handle on it, especially not for other people. But I could understand it enough that I could turn it into something else. So I made a, oh, I don’t know, some sort of thought-editing spell. Any time I thought about Mum I would just snip away my next five seconds of thought. I’d skip ahead, and if I was still thinking of her, I’d do it again and again until I wasn’t. And if I was dwelling on a certain memory of her, I’d snip that away, too. So it didn’t hurt so badly.”
“Oh, yeah, that’s lovely, Harry, shut us out of things, we couldn’t possibly help,” she retorted, coldly.
“You do a bit, though,” Hermione laughed. “Especially when you’re looking at Harry, like ‘he’s the answer to a question you didn’t even need to ask.’ Isn’t that what the article said?”
“Take my cock out,” he instructed, and Malfoy did. Harry was aching for him, brutally hard.
“What’s happened?” Harry asked, as he and Draco met with Hermione and Ron in the sitting room. They’d arrived by Floo and Kreacher had already set them up with tea. Clark was evidently still asleep.
“The news ones,” Hiram gasped, desperately. His owlish face was even more pale and distraught than usual. “I forget my charms book and Marvin here went back with me to the dorms to get it, only there was a bunch of smoke billowing out into the hallways, so we raced back here, oh, Merlin, I didn’t know what to do!”
Malfoy shot off an incendiary spell from across the room and the letter scattered into a heap of ashes.
“He has just always been on me for liking
go, but part of him still blanched at the idea of having someone else’s cock in his hand. It didn’t turn him off, it just...made him nervous. He didn’t want to look like a total berk, if he could avoid it.
“Nice try, Tiering,” Draco replied briskly. “Not with your inclination to try and be clever.”
“No,” Malfoy shook his head, “but I’ll stay where you put me.”
“What would the second option look like?” Draco asked tentatively.
to, fix it.
“Oh, my love,” Draco tutted, pulling Scorpius close. “I’m so sorry. That was a bit too much for one day, I know.”
“He did not,” Draco replied, honestly.
“And we are very fortunate to have you here, Professor,” the headmistress continued, cordially. “The second order of business is somewhat less pleasant. It has been brought to my attention that certain attacks, gestures and pranks have been leveled towards the students of particular houses. These actions distress me a great deal. May I take this opportunity to remind you that Hogwarts houses are simply to encourage some friendly interhouse competition and collegiality, and should not be taken with any more gravity than a game of wizards’ chess between friends. To address this, I have encouraged professors to grant house points to students demonstrating acts of interhouse good faith and friendship. It is my hope that this shall stem any petty, nonsensical assumptions we may level at one another. Should this remain a problem, and students be unable to identify and address their own prejudices, I shall do away with the house system altogether.”
“Shit,” Ron exhaled.
Harry kissed her cheek, incredibly relieved at the warm reception. Perhaps he'd been expecting the opposite more than he'd realised.
“Sorry,” Harry gulped bashfully, rubbing his eyes and exhaling hard, “I really shouldn’t drink, makes me horrible company, I let the melancholy take over.”
He didn’t know what he felt. He bundled the Invisibility Cloak into a ball and tossed it in the closet before hurtling himself back under Al’s comforter and pulling it over his head, pressing one palm to his chest where he could feel the shallow rise and fall of his breathing.
“And Mum didn’t leave because of me, yeah, yeah. You’ve said.”
“Is it
“Yes, but can you help?” Harry demanded.
?” Scorpius offered. He whispered the  curse word as if it was dangerous to utter aloud, and it made Jamie suspect it was the first one he’d ever said.
“You’re fine,” Harry said, squeezing Clark’s shoulder.
“I see,” Ilka pondered, tapping her chin with a finger nail painted a bright coral. “Well, in my line of work, honesty is rarely the best policy, but I say definitely stick to the mostly authentic, except the bit about Mr. Malfoy’s deceit. That part remains between the two of you, am I understood? So far as your peers are concerned, he is as honest as the day is long and has been since the end of the war. Lesson number one, gentlemen, never trust the public with nuance, or shades of morality, either. They like their heroes and their villains well packaged and easy to digest. So, we’ll have to keep progressing Mr. Malfoy along the hero trajectory. Let's make a plan.”
“You’ll mind when I trade you my ancient Nimbus Fleet X for a Needletail!” Jamie told him.
“Because of them,” Draco agreed, “and because it was the ‘90s, and then because I was a Death Eater and everyone already hated me and I didn’t want another mark against my name.”
“Alright, alright,” Harry said, unable to resist a final kiss before dragging himself out of the stall, “I’m using your towel.”
“Ingenious, I’m sure,” Draco assured her.
Harry blushed, “I had to keep him safe,” he objected, but it sounded weak, even to him.
“I know, darling, I do,” Draco's tone was kind and direct. “But eat first, please. You need a clear head about you.”
“I burn.”
“Well?” demanded Draco, when Harry and Clark hurtled out of the hearth in the sitting room.
Harry obliged.
CWs: PWP, kink, D/s, kink negotiation, insufficient kink negotiation, face slapping, rough oral sex.
“Mm,” Draco nodded.
“No,” Draco assured him. “The crying and the pain do, and when the pain is finally relieved, they are able to sleep.”
“I told you,” Draco muttered through clenched teeth. “It’s humiliating.”
If Scorpius wanted to get back to school and to convince Al to forgive him and maybe try to broker some peace between the two brothers, this whole Invisibility Cloak plan was his only option. He wasn’t
Draco pulled back, waiting for his answer. Harry sighed, looking down at their hands, then forced himself to meet Draco’s eyes.
in the lake with my mate the squid,” Al quipped, just to be difficult.
“Harry!” Draco groaned, “Oh, Merlin, fuck, I think—”
The photo of Draco and Harry was not nearly as unbearable, this time. It was a candid shot. Harry’s focus was directed towards something off camera, likely someone shouting instructions that Harry couldn’t follow. The miniature reproduction of himself kept wrinkling his nose and tilting his chin, as if trying to make sense of what he was hearing. For a moment, Harry couldn’t think why they’d selected this shot.
“Ah,” Harry acknowledged. He personally preferred the coddling approach, if he was being honest with himself. “And what did he tell you?”
Harry enlarged his trunk, dug out a quill, and wrote down the address for Clark and Draco to see, and then watched their startled expressions as the front of the dingy house seemed to spring up before their eyes.
“Merlin, I don’t remember!” Jones whinged. “A week ago maybe, likely just in the bin in the common room.”
“To dinner, on Friday. You and Scorpius.”
“Of course not.”
Without anything that could be described as grace, they shuffled upwards until they found the pillows at the head of the bed. Harry slung an arm around Draco’s waist and curled into him. Draco wriggled closer, seeking Harry’s heat. Harry wondered if he ought to say something more, but instead with his lips pressed to Draco’s shoulder, he drifted off.
“It was only a suggestion,” Draco said. “Of course if the children are needed at home, I should hate to interfere.”
Just a heads up: I've decided this story will be ending soon and will be turned into the first in a series instead. The next leg of the story will be set at Hogwarts and it felt like too big of a shift, especially since so many new characters will be introduced. There are a few more chapters to go in this fic, but just wanted to give you all a heads up since I know there are still a lot of loose threads! Also, I don't think there will be any delay between finishing this one and starting the next, so if you're interested in continuing reading (and I really, really hope you are!), please keep an eye out/subscribe to my user account to make sure you don't miss the next story in the series!
“No,” allowed Harry.
“It is when you consume half the bottle,” Draco pointed out.
“Hurry up, you lot!” Seamus urged the others.
“We don’t know for certain,” Hermione conceded, “her aim could have been off and they were standing fairly close together, but it seemed headed for Malfoy until Harry pushed him out of the way.”
“Not at all, I was simply immersed in my writing. They have had breakfast and I did mention packing up, but if that actually happened, who's to say. Boys!” He called out.
“Oh peachy, clearly,” Clark huffed. “Can you just tell me where I can find more sheets and forget this ever happened?”
that Draco wasn’t sure he was able to give.
Fortitude Jordan had been a friend of Jamie’s since first year. They’d joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team together this past year with Jamie as Seeker and Fort as one of the Beaters. Harry hadn’t realised, however, that they were so close.
Harry thought about what Ginny had said over the holidays, about Daphne, but he hadn’t noticed the two girls together more than usual. He thought perhaps the quiet Slytherin girl more opened a door, than anything.
“Remy, then,” Draco said, hoping that was the best way to sidestep it. Privately, though, he was a little surprised. How was it that Potter’s children were all so ignorant of the man's own experiences? Draco would have expected the Potter children to have been raised on war stories. The little redheaded baby squirmed in Draco's arms, so he readjusted and began to bounce Remus, or Remy, rather, gently.
“You’re not a thing, Scor,” Jamie said gently. “You’re a person.”
Draco’s arms came around the little boy, and he dropped a kiss to the tangle of golden curls.
“Yes,” Harry said very plainly, “I do.” He swept his arm around Draco’s back, drawing him nearer, "And if you like, I'll keep telling you that until you believe it, too."
“Tighter,” ordered Malfoy.
“Grey,” Harry offered.
“I thought you’d like that,” Harry purred, unzipping his flies and taking his cock in hand. “Here you go. Hand on my thigh. Let me know if it’s too much.”
family,” she insisted, more steady this time. “You don’t choose between family and family. You find a way.”
sorry to have assaulted your precious eyes, Potter, I’ll be sure to cast a glamour faster next time.”
“I did have a matter I wished to discuss with you, Draco,” Narcissa said, “perhaps after you and Harry find what you need at the shops you could meet me for supper.”
“You’re a talented man, Potter,” Draco announced.
“Right,” Draco stood up, speaking loudly, “I think they get the point, Tanya. And that’s not the sort of thing to bring up at public forums. Perhaps you should do some work on empathy, yourself.”
“I still can’t believe you told Weasley about that,” Draco grumbled.
“Yeah,” Harry breathed, the knot of anxiety finally beginning to unravel. “Sorry, I—” he didn’t know how to finish.
“We use Muggle ones,” James explained.
“Very well,” Harry consented, but turned to Draco, concern rising, “Does that work for you? You’ll be the most-likely target.”
Harry felt a light touch on his fringe. He looked up. Malfoy swept his bangs to one side, holding them there while he ran the pad of his thumb ever so faintly along the scar on Harry’s forehead. Harry had barely thought about his scar in months. He didn’t know what to make of Malfoy’s focused gaze.
“Pity no one did,” Malfoy informed her, testily, apparently out of patience.
Malfoy’s face flickered with disapproval, but he simply kissed him, first on the forehead and then on the mouth.
Harry gave a low laugh and shook his head, then rolled them both so he was above Draco, pinning him to the bed. He loved how those slender hips fit between his thighs, how he was just large enough to know Draco wasn’t totally comfortable under his weight, that Draco liked it like that. “I can’t believe you manufactured this from the start. You really are the most Slytherin fucking Slytherin," he said, caught between admiration and despair. "And you were so canny. You were even a guarded, vicious little wasp at the beginning, lashing out if I got too close.”
Harry felt as though he stood now where Lavender had lain dying, watching himself from the outside like a scene from a play. Draco and Hermione were approaching, timidly, as though he could startle like a spotted fawn. Didn’t they know they couldn’t reach him? He was all the way over here, and that was only his body. Draco’s hesitant touch jarred Harry back into himself with a violent gasp. The other boy leaped back in surprise.
Before Harry could answer, the rest of the players had gathered. He looked at his ever-serious little team: broad-chested, enthusiastic Fitz, wan and stringy-haired Marcia Awling, Mathieu from Bristol, quiet, dedicated Magnolia, and Clark and Hiram who stood with Karanjeet and David, talking tactics.
The professor’s voice was scratchy as ever, and the students silent, focused. Harry felt the pressure of Draco’s thigh and bicep against his. He was sitting too close for plausible deniability. And Harry didn’t care. He was tired of caring. He wanted Draco close, wanted the solid, reassuring physicality of him. He wanted to take Draco’s hand in his, or wrap and arm around him like other couples could, fuck the onlookers, fuck the consequences.
“I’ll not force you to go forward,” Potter said carefully. “But I’d like it if we did. You know, if we could just keep seeing each other, find out what happens. And I think you might like it, too.”
“No, no,” Harry shook his head distractedly. “I’ll be fine.”
Harry shook his head with a chuckle. Draco put a companionable hand on Harry’s arm to steer him round a corner and even though no one was looking, Harry felt suddenly as though they were standing under a glaring spotlight. Surely everyone would
“While I’ve enjoyed playing for the Wyverns a great deal, I can no longer in good conscience remain on the team, at least until you’ve sought help and separated yourself from that boy.”
Hermione shook her head, “I just don’t think punitive measures will be effective, I think we have to lead by example.”
was helping you out with the kids?” Ron demanded, when he finally found his tongue. “They’re
But Harry was done with waiting. He took one deliberate step forward. Malfoy’s arms relaxed and he leant back, his palms finding purchase on the wooden surface behind him. The posture was uncharacteristically unguarded, which made it all the more magnetic. It drove Harry mad. One step closer and Harry was right there. He reached out, bracketing the other man, gripping the counter ledge behind him. Their bodies were close: close enough that Harry could feel the radiating heat, but they didn’t touch. Harry’s eyes sought out Malfoy’s, issuing a plea or a challenge, Harry could hardly say. Malfoy’s pupils were wide, deep pits as he gave Harry a single permissive nod.
“You could make me,” Malfoy offered with an inviting smile.
He looked to his right and there was Narcissa Malfoy, a solitary slender pillar being carefully watched by several small groups and couples. He couldn’t fuck this up.
Happy Halloween 🎃 🎃 🎃!!!
“Nearly curfew,” Jamie said. “Come on, get your things, I’ll walk you.”
“What are you doing now?” he heard himself asking.
Potter?”
“Ready?”
“But you got along alright at the hospital this morning and when you dropped me off,” Scorpius puzzled.
“I know that," Harry reassured him. "It seems to just be the really troubling memories that do it.”
Without warning, Harry ended the spell which kept the other man suspended. Draco collapsed in a heap before scrambling to his knees, he looked up then, a vicious need glinting in his ice grey eyes.
“Will keep it simple this round: Slytherins versus Ravenclaws,” Professor Potter continued. “Ravenclaws: You’re on the offensive. Slytherins, you’ll be on the defensive. Remember, approved hexes only when attacking. No straying from that list, or there will be truly regrettable consequences.”
Al shook his head as he followed the corridor from the deserted common room into the dormitory. He felt an ugly mix of persistent anger and worse, shame. He oughtn’t to have talked about Scor like that. His friend wouldn’t have liked it and Al sometimes thought he would do anything to keep Scor’s friendship. Scorpius was never irritated when Al changed focus from one project to the next, he was always game for an adventure, but would stop Al from doing anything truly foolish, and, well Scor
“When I was a boy, Albus Dumbledore was my headmaster. During the war, the Dark Lord took up residence inside my family home. I couldn’t read magical capacity as clearly then as I can now, but suffice to say, James, your father’s power dwarfs them both.”
“Indeed,” Draco replied. “And so, the sooner we can come up with a workable solution, the sooner we can ensure that, should such a mishap occur, it could be easily remedied. Now, I suggest we return to the Restoration Spell,
Draco, for his part, raised his eyebrows. “A bit upscale for the student crowd, wouldn’t you say, Granger?”
“Potter,” Draco said entreatingly. He nudged his forehead against Harry’s. “I’d much rather you tell me what’s buzzing around in there.”
“Little Clark Tiering.”
Malfoy eyed him as he entered, "Not your colour, Potter," he apprised.
“Oh?” Father’s face didn’t give anything away, but it was perhaps just a shade less stony than it had been moments before.
“Please,” Draco murmured, rocking and shaking, “Please, Harry, please let me go, let me go.”
“Al, shut up, Dad’s making his announcement!” Jamie commanded.
As if remembering suddenly the rules of the game, Clark unsteadily wend his way towards the large purple hoops. He didn’t get far before the talented McCracken made a successful grab for it.
Late that night, feeling worn and raw, Harry climbed up to the attic to look for Meat Pie, his antisocial owl. Jamie had named the great tawny beast as a young child, and Meat Pie had seemingly never forgiven anyone in the family for the indignity. He was too independent to even properly be called Harry’s...he was more just a cantankerous, feathered mop who occasionally roosted in the rafters of Eiderdown End.
“What if I don’t want that sort of power?” Draco whispered, lifting his face away from his hands. Harry’s body stilled, and he didn’t reply, so Draco continued, words tripping out of him: “What if I don’t want to be able to stop you? What if I want those decisions left to you? I trust you. I know you won’t overdo it. I just...I don’t—”
“Yeah, sorry, of course,” Potter said. He led Draco down the hallway dotted with doors and into a small sort of sunroom. It was chilly, despite the time of year. The sky had clouded over, and the room was hardly sunny.  Mismatched patio furniture occupied much of the space, along with some sort of Muggle tabletop game with a net and little rackets. It was coated in dust, its novelty having worn off some years ago. A round-bellied clay chiminea in a friendly, muted coral sat in the corner. Potter lit a fire in it with a wave of his wand. Draco eyed the casual slope of the striped canvas deck chairs coolly. Potter apologised again and transfigured them into stately wingbacks. Although unsuitable for the setting, they did seem somewhat more appropriate for the ensuing conversation than sunloungers. Draco lowered himself into one with all the grace he could muster, and Potter did the same, looking at him expectantly.
Draco chuckled, taking in the cedar scent of Potter’s soap. He thought about Potter as a boy, so ready to jump into action, so easily baited. Fatherhood had mellowed the man some, and grief seemed to have edged out the majority of his anger. Draco wondered now if Potter had ever been as insufferably proud as Draco had believed him to be when they were at Hogwarts together. Such pride certainly wasn’t detectable now. Despite Potter’s own misgivings, he was clearly a competent father. Albus and Lily obviously adored him and so did James, underneath the layers of sullen attitude. Potter might seem scattered, but Draco could hardly blame him. When the situation with Astoria had devolved as it did, Draco had all but locked Scorpius away in the Manor and flung himself into finding a cure, to the neglect of everything, including his son.
Thanks to everyone for their patience and for the incredibly kind and sincere comments. I appreciate you an unbelievable amount.
“Oh,” Harry said, stupidly, “Er, wow, Kreacher, that’s great. Thanks, truly.”
The matron gave Harry a pointed look and Harry apologised, leaving Malfoy to her care.
Harry saw them then, the jagged white scars slashing across Malfoy’s chest and abdomen. Harry could almost remember the frantic pattern of his wand as he’d hurled the spell from the bathroom floor that afternoon long ago.
Harry shrugged. “Couldn’t say.”
Draco could tell the boy thought he was pretty clever to come up with this theory, and that stating it aloud made him feel bold and brave. Draco chuckled quietly.
“Not the goal,” Harry reminded him with a playful elbow to the ribs.
“Good evening, Aunt,” Draco addressed her.
The question clearly caught Al off guard. His back straightened slightly and his fingers tightened around the edge of his mattress.
“You’re welcome to do a case study or what have you,” Harry agreed. “Not sure how anyone will replicate it, though. Not unless someone else can do that trick of Clark’s: locking them in his mind and bloody befriending them. Merlin, I can’t believe this is what you’re thinking about, after everything.”
“I’ve redeemed it on my own, thanks very much,” Draco fired back.
“So you know where he is then?” Fife prodded. “He run off with a fitter bloke?”
despite his best efforts.”
"Er, I'll see what I can do," Scorpius evaded.
“Feeling abandoned, are we?” Harry tutted, as he changed and dressed the fussing baby.
The Gryffindors and Slytherins rallied around Draco’s petrified body, hoisting it into the air, “Well done, Draco!” Bellowed Goyle and more rowdy hoorays chorused out.
Draco’s hand was shaking with adrenaline but he reached down and gripped his unflagging cock, stroking it.
Harry laughed. “Draco’s just put out because they aren’t as stuffy in their communication as the Arrows.”
“So she, ah, left.”
Harry grumbled his agreement. Malfoy was hardly wrong.
Malfoy fixed his pale eyes on Harry, his lips a grim line, “You of all people should know I’ve had worse.”
“I was...Merlin,” Harry ran a frazzled hand through his hair, then self-consciously smoothed it down again. It was a futile effort. “I was thinking about Ginny. Is that weird to tell you?”
, Harry was reading. Why history of magic was going back in time instead of closer to modern times, Harry was unclear. Why he was even still taking History of Magic was even more unclear.
Thanks so much for reading!!!!
“Oh, love. I do regret it. I...I don't like knowing I am capable of that much violence,” Harry said, stroking Malfoy’s hair like he was something precious.
Malfoy shifted his knees apart, wrapping his hand around himself. Harry found that spot within him again and Malfoy yelped.
Harry unfurled the Marauder’s Map.
“Well, I’ll let you two get some sleep; seems as though you could both use it,” Molly told them. She stepped in to embrace Harry and to plant a kiss on his cheek. “Now don’t you forget what I said:” she reminded him, “If you need child minding, at any time, you tell me. If I’m not free I’ll track down Lucy or Fleur or Victoire or one of the cousins, don’t think I won’t! You’re not alone in this Harry, you hear me? You’ve a whole family on your side.”
“But I’m not going to, so…” The arm still looped around Draco’s back tightened suggestively.
“It’s fine,” Harry interrupted, “Lots of people are hurting, I know it’s still fresh.”
“Found him!” Clark shouted. “We’re up here!”
Draco opened his mouth to answer the question. Of course he knew what he’d had, he’d only just been thinking about it. But it was gone. He couldn’t remember a moment of it: not the taste or smell wafting off his plate, words he’d exchanged with Scorpius, or even the cleaning up. It was simply gone. “Merlin,” Draco breathed. “Extraordinary.”
“Please be truthful with me, Albus,” Harry said solemnly. “Did you tell him he wasn’t important? That he’d never make something of himself?”
“Mm,” Harry agreed. A lift arrived and he ushered Clark into it. There were pastel-coloured paper airplanes bobbing about their heads and a solemn faced old witch in ministry robes.
“Not always,” Hermione agreed, “but sometimes.”
Draco gripped his hand tightly and Myrtle gave an asinine giggle.
Once all the students were settled, Professor Haberdash-Pewter lowered herself carefully into a violet wing back, sliding a matching cushion behind her lower back. She always moved like her body was more rods than bones. Harry wondered just what she had seen.
“Nothing,” Bingham promised solemnly.  “My aunt would
“Nor did he think about anyone but himself. I’ve been there, Harry, and it took me a long time to climb out of that particular hole. I don’t want him to go through the same. A bit of understanding now, even if it was painful, will help him avoid the same in future.”
It was too late.
Draco could stop all this. He knew if he shoved Harry’s hand out of his mouth and told him to piss off, Harry would, in an instant, but Draco didn’t dare, and worse, he found he didn’t want to. What he
Harry cringed. He could think of few things less romantic than Kreacher in his tea towel toga serving him up beans on toast in the drab little room that looked even more bedraggled in the light of day.
“Give me a hand with this, love,” he coaxed.
“I think so too,” Zerk said. “I can’t help but notice that the idea that Draco may have manipulated you somehow seems to especially bother you.”
It was a dreadfully low rate for an owl; Harry wondered what was wrong with her.
Harry ejected himself at once, feeling like an arse, he should have jumped out as soon as Clark lost control.
Jamie only laughed. “Sorry, I forgot that social niceties are so unbearably tedious.”
Al considered that. “I’m not sure we do,” he pondered. “It’s more that it’s just something we do. I guess because Jamie’s always wanted to be everyone’s favourite, and I came along and messed that all up.”
They all looked at Clark blankly.
“You’re not serious.”
Ron stared at Draco’s hand as though it might sprout fangs, but with some hesitation, he clasped it in his own.
my body—”
When his eyes stopped watering long enough for him to look around, he saw the bright blond head of Malfoy seated beside a cot near the professors’ usual table. Draco’s eyes were intent on an unconscious Clark and he was holding a limp hand in a death grip between his own. His face was pale, even for him, and he looked young and maybe even terrified. Harry wanted to go to them, but he didn't have the strength at the moment. A healer approached Clark, blocking Harry’s view, and he felt relieved knowing the boy was getting care.
“Come on, Harry,” Draco whispered, hitching his legs up around Harry’s waist, “I want to do it. Please.”
“Forget it. I’m being stupid.”
Bernard Ojo whistled under his breath. “Not cheap, that,” he pointed out.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Hermione argued, but Harry could tell she was pleased.
Harry snorted. “Well, that hardly surprises me.”
“He’s not here,” Harry pointed out.
he called out.
Ginny threw the card down the table:
(See the end of the chapter for
“If you’ll let me,” Draco’s voice was little more than a whisper.
“What’s up, Harry?” asked Hermione.
“Harry, he’s currently burping your bloody baby. This is clearly not nothing. Merlin, I had no idea. When did you realise you were...what? Gay? Bisexual?”
“Is Mum coming?” Jared asked. Even though Clark and Jared were staying at Number 12, Grimmauld Place (Harry had made him memorise it and say it back often) for the holidays, their mum had been here, too, for a few days, sleeping in the bed Jared was currently hiding under. She kept saying how things were easier now that Jared was in school, and how grateful she was that Harry and Draco could help out for a few days.
“I never doubted that,” Draco soothed. “Even then, I’m sure you were admirable.”
Lily looked pleased. “Thank you,” she told him. “I think so too. What happened to your neck?”
Clark looked up finally, his eyebrows furrowed. “You’re kind of bad at this,” he commented.
“Well,” he said instead. “Can’t I come?”
Draco sank into the sofa beside Harry, then stretched out, his head in Harry’s lap and his ankles crossed up on the armrest.
on his wand as Draco switched off Rivers' charm on the hoops.
“It’s pulling teeth to get my children to help me,” Harry remarked, as Al rifled through the large, walk-in pantry. “And yet they trip over themselves to do things for you.”
Malfoy’s features twitched into a rather sour expression, “Saviour of the wizarding world and you still don’t know how to dress yourself.”
Harry read the brush-off for the third time, then crumpled it in his pocket. The note had come via Metatron that morning and Harry felt a deep burning shame knowing that Raulo had read it before him. At least the hex breaker had had the decency to forward it without any Appleby Arrows blue stationery, so Harry had been able to keep the news to himself, at least for now. Not that he’d been particularly successful at shielding his emotions. He snapped at Ron for accidentally trodding on the back of his foot on the way to Transfiguration and he’d barely spoken to Draco. Professor McGonagall had had to call on him three times just to get his attention.
The sight that greeted them made little sense to Harry. A faint white figure stood before a pudgy little girl in checked pajamas. Around them on the floor, were several pups, barking and chasing their tails, only the pups were made of golden fire. Upon seeing them, the white figure faded, like it had risen with the smoke, and left was only Ada Lum—the hapless first year who’d
really is infuriatingly opaque, you know," Albus informed his friend.
Scorpius tore off a strip of parchment from his own notes.
“Shut it, Potter,” Draco growled.
Draco couldn’t imagine Potter’s Boggart would appear as anything but the Dark Lord, so he was surprised by the question.
“You shouldn’t have that,” Harry deflected, motioning to Draco’s glass. “Your head.” The swelling had gone down somewhat, thanks to Hermione’s cold compress, but it still looked painful enough to make Harry grimace.
Draco just shrugged, "I didn't have much of a defense."
“I suppose not,” Clark said glumly.
Albus beamed up at him. The sight of him gave Draco pause. He’d avoided really
“Back in position,” Harry directed. “Hands behind your back. I didn’t tell you to move.”
“Of course they are,” Draco agreed. “But as much as it pains me to admit it, I’m sure your off-the-cuff classes will be every bit as effective as my painstakingly planned ones. That’s rather your style, isn’t it?”
“You desperate for it?” Harry asked.
Harry simply snorted and poured the water into the teapot. “Just give the receipts to Hermione and she’ll reimburse you from the M.C.E.F.”
Harry looked around the room. Parvati and Seamus were sitting together sorting letters, and Harry imagined Lavender there with her, laughing and chatting with her friends. He wondered if they felt her absence, and how such grief could suck the joy out of a moment as suddenly as a dementor. All at once, Harry felt as hollow as he did visiting Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley and seeing only George behind the counter. Everything was broken and he couldn’t put it together again.
“We’re not supposed to call him that,” Jamie reminded her.
“Hullo, Harry!” The large bloke called out, reaching out to shake Harry’s hand, “Fitz Hops, such a pleasure, really.” He was so affable that Harry felt himself smiling at once, returning the greeting.
“I know,” Draco agreed solemnly. “Nor do I.”
“When will you learn that I’m always sure, Potter?” Draco responded, pressing a quick nip of a kiss to Potter’s bottom lip, just because he could. “Go.”
Harry felt his sudden anger dissipate and his untamed magic burst forth triumphantly at the sound of his name in that husky, rasping voice, as though Malfoy’s throat was already raw from the pain. It formed thick, invisible vines which twisted insistently around Malfoy’s pale arms.
Her lips twitched towards a smile, "Something to that effect, yes. Thank you for bringing Clark here. I do worry about his not fitting in. He's a clever boy, but that chip on his shoulder isn't making him any friends."
Weasley was just saying what every decent citizen was always thinking. Everyone, except perhaps Potter. Potter, who had sacrificed the most, who had sacrificed, if the whispered rumours were to be believed, part of his own soul, who had the most reason to despise him, had instead accepted Draco’s growth at face-value and believed him. And Harry’s belief in Draco seemed nearly contagious, since Granger was now following suit, and together their confidence felt like a first gasp of fresh air after a dust storm.
, it fit, somehow. Lucius was an aberration of everything a father should be, and purposefully so: he chose that path, chose cruelty, and reigned as tyrant over his wife and son. There was nothing natural about it.
“I know that,” Draco assured him. “I would like to talk to you more about your proposed solution sometime soon, however.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well,” Ron said, sounding a bit guilty, “I think we were all a bit surprised, so there were a few of us…”
something a condition, even, he wondered? As a Vates, a rare kind of Seer, Scorpius was plagued with prophecies, beginning at the brink of puberty. Scorpius had come into his unwelcome powers the summer before his first year at Hogwarts. Initially, the condition was so all-consuming that he could speak very little other than what his Sight showed him. His father had thankfully learnt of a potion that kept the soothsaying at bay, but some experiments Scorpius had allowed Al to conduct over the summer showed that a bunch of sugar or a greatly increased heart rate, could induce it. Of course Professor Potter was just being considerate.
“Well,” Harry said again hurriedly. “I’ve been offered a position teaching Defence at Hogwarts. And, er, I’ve accepted.”
“Can’t say I blame you,” Malfoy replied thoughtfully.
“I guess you wouldn’t have,” Scorpius allowed. “So you fought?”
Draco’s mouth pressed into a flat line. “Yes. As am I.”
It was Ginny’s turn to nod and they flew swiftly onwards for several more minutes in silence.
The serious Ravenclaw had her sheet of shining black hair tied in a neat topknot. She nodded and gave Harry a shy, pleased smile. Claire blushed miserably and pursed her lips, looking away.
“Either way, I think we ought to take it to McGonagall,” Harry decided.
“Merlin, Draco, you promised to be reasonable and not terrorise him too much.”
“That was Hermione’s doing, for the most part,” Harry told her, feeling it important that his friend get her due.
“Potter,” He stated coldly, and Harry replied simply, “Malfoy,” in turn. Harry didn’t suppose it was encouraging that they could barely force civility, at best.
“Interesting,” Main remarked, his grin remaining, but his eyes narrowing coldly. “Because word has it from Mulligan’s little sister, that you got some sort of special treatment in Defence class today. Didn’t have to practice like everyone else.”
“Pie and hash will do me,” Harry said. “Thanks.”
Silently, Scorpius cursed dratted Francine Mulligan and her sneaky, snitchy ways. She was every bit as much as a tattler as Rose Weasley, but at least Weasley was obvious about it.
Malfoy didn't respond at once. Harry wondered if he was going to be ignored entirely.
Malfoy cursed then squeezed his eyes tight.
Harry wrapped her in a bear hug. “You’re really something, Hermione Granger-Weasley, you know that?”
“Not for me,” Draco countered. “I’ll never forget.”
“You can’t just keep her in your mind all day,” Draco said sharply. "It's a blue moon, she's more powerful than she was."
“It bears repeating,” Harry pointed out.
As far as plans went, Harry thought that was a pretty good one.
Potter groaned miserably. “Touché. Al, this time.”
Fife’s lip curled. “Won’t your little boyfriend get jealous? Where is darling Scorpius, anyway? It’s past his bedtime,” he goaded.
“That,” Draco gasped breathlessly between kisses, tugging at Harry’s shirt, “was the most brilliant fucking thing I’ve ever seen.”
“We’re trying to figure out if there is anything to the DADA curse rumour,” Jamie explained. “And if there is, we want to know how to break it.”
“Shit, sorry,” Draco muttered. Something about the unfairness of the rule left him awash in equal parts frustration and arousal. It highlighted the power differential so precisely. Harry got to set the terms, and here, in this headspace, Draco didn’t get to argue. The injustice of it was infuriating and enthralling, all at once.
“Being able to fly on a broom does not automatically equate to being ‘not so bad,’ Potter.”
a child!” Harry said.
“I’m sorry,” Draco replied, his voice a thin, agonised whine.
“Would you allow me to accompany you to St. Mungo’s, Harry?” McGonagall asked. “Discreetly, of course.”
Harry nodded.
“It’s alright. You’ll make up, you always do. Now, do you want to come back and at least get to taste the meal you worked so hard on, or do you want to escape to your room for a bit?”
Harry felt Ron and Hermione behind him. Merlin, what had he done? He stepped back.
“Get her dry!” Someone shouted, “She’s freezing! I think she’s hit her head, oh, Merlin, is that blood?”
Clark isn’t listening, the sick feel of regret swelling in his chest and thrumming horribly against his sternum. “Or why couldn’t she just have invited me to her place? Why doesn’t she ever want me there? Even last summer, when things were good, I felt like she wanted me gone almost as soon as I arrived. I don’t fucking get it. I don’t act up, I take care of things, I look after Jared, I don’t argue. I try to make things easier for her.”
“Tea,” Draco agreed.
Draco handed off the baby and then went to brush his teeth and wash his face in the little en suite still littered with Ginevra Weasley’s things.
"Are you mine?" Harry asked, tilting his head.
“Thank you for today,” he said, ‘It meant a lot to me, and to Clark.”
Draco was torn between losing his balance and actually having to touch the handrail above him. Another lurch, and he settled unhappily for the latter and Harry reluctantly let his hand fall away. “Never again,” Malfoy vowed, “your cousin better be an absolutely fucking delight.”
“Mr. Potter!” Andrews protested, “We’ve only got your best interests at heart; the boy was a Death Eater, after all.”
“Shit, sorry, you go,” Harry prompted quickly, wincing at how awkward he sounded.
“Come along, James,” Draco said. “I’m certain we can fix us all up something significantly more appetising.”
The only problem was, once he was in the corridor, he didn’t have a single idea of where to go, not with Al busy.
“Just going to miss this,” Harry admitted, “waking up with you.”
“Alright,” Harry reflected, still at a loss. “And was there, I don’t know, something specific you were curious about? A, er, particular event or what have you?”
Harry felt the anger condense inside him, taking shape. “You obviously do, or you wouldn’t be ordering me not to try this out. It could work, and if it did, it would be worth any emotional fallout.”
“Speak for yourself,” groused Draco from under the bedspread, “I’m going back to sleep until I forget this entire exchange ever happened.”
Those grey-blue eyes met his, “That you,” Draco swallowed and repeated himself, “that you can do what you want with me, because I’m...I’m yours.”
Harry dropped his head onto his folded arms, “I know. I know, I’m off my head.”
“What if he hurt himself to get my attention? What if our whole relationship is founded on a lie? Do I have to just walk away and learn to get on without him?”
“Hey, Dad–” his son started, then left off looking conflicted.
“Hello, you two,” Harry greeted them with a friendly grin, “Anyone know the rest of the players? I’m afraid I don’t know who to look for.” Before they could respond, Harry felt a tap on his shoulder and turned to see a vaguely familiar face in a Ravenclaw scarf.
Draco glanced at one blush-coloured floral cuff. It turned out couture was the least of his concerns this evening. He considered not answering her, but he doubted his ability to dupe a member of the wizarding intelligence—diplomat, like hell—especially with a damned head injury.
“Not ours?”
“Perhaps,” Scorpius replied thoughtfully, “that means Harry and I are onto something.”
Harry shrugged, “Can’t miss what you never had, I guess.” He knew he was diverting but he couldn’t sit with that heavy, mournful feeling any longer, not without cracking open. “But I guess I thought Draco saw me as a person. Like, we joke about him only being around for the status but it’s always been a joke, I’ve never believed it.”
“Yes, alright,” Professor Potter agreed. “Just promise you’ll rein yourself in if necessary, or you’ll come to me immediately if you start feeling
Clark draws a breath, chipping away at the constriction still lingering there, and, for the first time in a long time, lets himself believe that everything really might come out alright in the end.
“She had plenty of spite to go round,” Harry replied, darkly.
Clark scoffed, “Bit rich coming from you. All you do is order Harry around and I don’t think I’ve ever heard you once say please. Get the tea, Potter. Get the door, Potter. Carry my bag, Potter.”
Draco stooped to pick it up. Upon rising, he peeked over Harry’s shoulder for any sign of Lily, and, when he didn’t see her, dared to press a quick kiss to the other man’s unshaven cheek.
“It’s fine,” Harry said. Clark was hardly the first younger student to approach him about his childhood in the last few days. Even the sweeping success of Tennyson’s article couldn’t obfuscate the flurry of articles speculating on the extent of the abuse. Harry was still having a hard time calling that, even though Zerk assured him that is what it was. It felt self-aggrandizing some days, and too heavy to bear on others. For his part, Harry stuck to euphemisms: 'life with the Dursleys', 'growing up', 'how it was then'. It made it feel a little more contained. He looked down at Clark’s serious little face, freckles darker now, from training in the spring sunshine. “It did, yes.”
Harry returned to Grimmauld Place later that afternoon. He found Draco at the dining room table, studying, his head resting on the knuckles of one hand.
“Not quite, sweetheart.” Harry responded, relentlessly sweet and patient. “Lean back, try again.”
“And who are your other clients?” Draco inquired, “So that I may judge your work.”
“We could probably stay for a little while longer, if you like,” Draco offered, glancing at his pocket watch.
“Pass!” he cried out with a strangled sound.
Harry’s heart froze, then plummeted like he was on some muggle tower of terror. “He what?”
“Say, ‘Yes, please.’”
“Hm,” Malfoy assented. “I don’t usually go for bondage or what have you,” he informed Harry, “but–”
The cat had a squashed sort of face and matted fur, but Jared thought it was a very whatsit,
When he came out, Potter stood up from where he was leaning over Remy’s bassinet. His face fell. “Shit,” he said. “Fuck, I forgot to make up a spare room.”
“Thank you, Mr. Potter, that will be all,” the matron dismissed Harry, smartly.
“I’ve never known a child with quite so many hobbies and aspirations,” Draco remarked.
“This is Clark,” Harry introduced.
“Meaning?”
“Dad?” James said quietly.
When he returned to the sitting room, he found Malfoy sitting across from Clark in a brocaded wing-back chair, one long leg neatly crossed over the other. He was wearing a bottle green smoking jacket over some linen trousers, and there were fine dragon-hide slippers on his bare feet. He looked like something out of a yachting magazine. All he needed was a pipe.
“Nah, I don’t want things like that filling their heads,” was Harry’s casual response.
“S’alright, Harry, you’ve made it, and look, the healers are here, they’ll take care of you. Now, take a seat and don’t try to talk.”
“Harry?” he looked around, catching McGonagall’s sharp eyes on him.
This has come up in the comments a few times now, so I just want to give readers a heads up: I'm definitely guilty of being a Draco Malfoy apologist. While I appreciate a good redemption arc, this is definitely more of just a forgiveness arc. If that's not your bag (totally understandable!), this might not be the right story for you! Thanks for your understanding!
the text— Historia Medieval Magica by Balbina Bloodstone— continued,
“Right-o,” Ron said, his voice big and friendly, “sorry about that.”
“Yes,” Draco replied ardently, voice hushed, because yes, that was what he wanted exactly: to prove himself, to show Harry how strong and capable he was, to remind them both that tonight was an anomaly.
Thank you to everyone who read and commented on the last chapter, your kindness continues to give me the dopamine I crave.
Harry went to argue but Draco pressed stern fingers to his lips. "Go to sleep, Potter. Your decision-making rights have been revoked until further notice.”
Hermione returned shortly with folded parchment in hand. “I found Draco’s letters,” she said, “but nothing of your dad’s. I’m sorry, Harry.”
“If you get as many Os as you possibly can and you find a healer willing to take you on as an apprentice for a few years. Then you complete your healers’ examinations and if you pass that, you’re qualified.”
for him, poor kid.”
And that was how Harry and Clark ended up at the Ministry of Magic.
“Oh fuck, oh fuck,” Draco wailed.
“Don’t come any closer!” Scorpius demanded, his voice shrill and high in a way that set the hairs on Harry’s arm on end. Harry held up his palms and lowered himself onto Al’s bed, a good distance away from Scorpius. Merlin, he thought, had he forgotten to give the child his medicine? But no, he'd administered it, he was sure of it. This wasn’t illness, it was just a nightmare. Harry’s own kids had always been rather solid sleepers, but he knew Rosie had given Ron and Hermione hell with night terrors for a while.
actively helping out, so Harry decided he didn’t care. He felt at a bit of a loss. He began to make his way to the drawing room, passing by Al’s closed door. Oh, Merlin, Harry thought. Scorpius was in there. If Al thought now would be a good idea for more scientific investigation, then Harry had more of a problem on his hands than he’d initially thought. He opened the door without knocking.
“No,” Dudley agreed. “They shouldn’t have been. I’m so sorry, Harry.”
Draco exhaled, sounding wrung out. “Seems awfully unfair that all your father figures die off while mine persists like a blasted vampire,” he commented darkly.
“It was easier for people to stay neutral during the war,” Draco ventured. “Many witches and wizards kept their heads down, and their mouths shut; it was what they felt had to be done. But the Weasleys didn’t do that. They did what they had to do to avoid being disappeared, certainly, but beneath all that—your family made up a significant force within the resistance. Many people, myself included, were too scared to do what they knew was right. We chose what we pretended was security, even when we knew it was nothing of the sort. You grandparents, they fought for something so much better. Their behaviour was admirable indeed.”
“Fine,” the boy agreed, “but you’ll have to convince him to let me use it whenever I want. I can’t fucking enjoy the music if I’m just watching the battery drain away.”
“That...would be good,” Harry ventured. “I don’t like guessing.”
The boy’s eyes grew round and large as he recognised Harry, “Oh wow,” he said, staring like a malnourished little owl in a green and silver tie, “H-H-Mr. Potter? Oh wow, oh wow, my Dad says you’re the greatest wizard who’s ever lived—”
Harry scoffed. “We’re hardly friends! We tolerate each other for the sake of the kids. That’s all.”
Hiram shook his head, “Sorry, Harry. I just assumed he had to use the toilet or something. Is everything alright?” Hiram’s eyes grew impossibly larger.
Draco scoffed lightly. That was Harry, always ready to talk things through. It was likely Granger’s influence, although clearly her own husband hadn’t learnt those lessons as fastidiously as Harry had. “I let myself get carried away,” Draco decided firmly. “I’m perfectly alright. It’s late. We ought to get some sleep.”
“Hardly a compliment so much as a statement of fact,” Malfoy responded and Harry saw heat rising to Malfoy’s pale cheeks as well. It stirred up something within him, something base and wanting. “Well, this is me,” Malfoy said, stopping and motioning to an open classroom door, “I’ll see you here at half past.”
“James,” Malfoy instructed, handing the boy a small coin purse, “take Scorpius and your brother to the apothecary and bring me back some Soothing Salve. Potter, the infant.”
Harry led Draco to the garden, just somewhere they could have a minute alone. He’d lent Malfoy some trousers and socks and shoes. They were too big, and he looked more slender and fragile than usual wearing them.
“You...you will?” Potter’s voice was strained and he was tugging on the back of his neck again.
“He always does this,” Lily informed Draco. “Don’t worry, I know how to wake him up.” She brought an elbow forward, as if winding up to dig it into her father's ribs.
article was released. Harry cringed nearly as violently as Ron did when Hermione dropped the issue in front of their breakfast plates. Harry had felt terribly awkward during the photoshoot, but the editorial staff had somehow managed to disguise that. In the photo, he and Draco were clasping hands and giving one another tender looks. They were dressed in non-threatening jumpers of Gryffindor scarlet and Slytherin green. It looked very much like a sequence from a holiday made-for-television film.
Thanks to everyone for sharing their thoughts in the comments! You're far too good to me!!!
. Instead he gave them a watery smile and let them walk away.
“I’m afraid of what will happen when I arrive.”
A cacophony of hexes and delighted shrieks sounded from the wooden structure, and Scorpius felt a twinge at being excluded, even if he was also a touch relieved.
“It's fine, I mean it's not, but I’m not trying to get your sympathy, I’m just trying to explain. You see, I think...I think I grew up believing I was only worth what I could do for others. Not that I got anything for it, not from my aunt and uncle or even from Dudley, at the time. But it was what I was good for. Unfortunately, I think maybe I bought into it until I actually believed I wasn’t worth anything at all.  I wonder if maybe it is just a bit easier for me to risk my safety, to sacrifice myself because of that. Like maybe I could prove I was worth something if I was just good enough, just noble enough.”
“Fuck,” Malfoy hissed.
“Holy shit, did you just—” Harry gasped, and then he was coming too, emptying himself deep and violent within Draco’s throat with a loud, unfettered cry. He didn’t linger, thank goodness, because Draco’s vision was blurring and the world was spinning and he was starved for air, gasping it in with ferocious urgency when Harry finally let him. He was panting still when Harry sank to his knees before sprawling out on the rug and pulling Draco down with him.
“Not my intention,” Malfoy groused.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Who knew muggle schools were so...enlightened.”
“That was just a warning,” Harry determined.
“Unfortunately, Mr. Malfoy. If you could accompany me to my office, please?”
Scorpius screwed his pursed lips to one side of his face. The story may have been familiar, but it clearly still made him uneasy.
Harry followed his gaze. The tiny golden hand had spun round and landed somewhere new:
“What does the boy who ended the reign of darkness require from a girl long dead?”
“Does that usually happen, then?” Malfoy inquired suspiciously, arms crossed. “Your magic trussing up your partner?”
Only once they were aloft did Ginny fix him with a steady gaze and say, “Harry, you’re in love with Draco Malfoy, aren’t you?”
“Where were you, Potter?” Fife demanded pompously, casting his dark, nearly feline gaze at Al.  Fife always acted as though he had a right to everyone else’s business. Probably because he was good-looking with a long glossy braid that he tied with a narrow velvet ribbon that was so pretentious it was all Al could do to keep from rolling his eyes every time he saw it. Secretly, he hoped that puberty would wreak absolute havoc on the boy; it seemed only karmic.
Main and Mulligan flashed him matching white smiles.
“I’m ready,” Draco insisted, embarrassed to hear a note of petulance in his voice.
“Right-o,” Harry nodded and returned to his task of sorting out the various cleaning potions and tonics below the kitchen sink. It was his mission for the day to tackle the dual nightmares that were the hall bathroom and the en suite. If he was feeling particularly brave, he might chance Jamie’s bathroom in the basement, as well.
“I was unfortunately not in much of a position to act upon these revelations. Or if I was, I hadn’t the disposition to put myself at risk.”
“Yes, Weasley, I’m sure a being composed of concentrated rage will be open to a quick chat. We’ll simply show her the error of her ways and she’ll retire to the seaside,” Malfoy replied.
Potter looked half-surprised at the dismissal. What, did the man think he would be invited to listen in on private matters? The presumption pricked at Draco’s nerves.
“You know, I may have done just that,” she told the little boy. He was too big to be carried about like a toddler, but Mother momentarily insisted on doing just that, standing to give him another big squeeze before letting him slide to the floor and offering him her hand, which he immediately took. The two walked off together, leaving Draco and Clark to deal with the luggage.
“I thought Harry was doing that,” Ginny said, dropping her satchel on the grass beside them. She crossed her ankles and leaned back on her palms, closing her eyes to take in the sun. She was beautiful, Harry acknowledged. He could remember the hurt she’d caused when she’d ended things between them, but he could no longer feel it.
Nodding, his dad
She took his hand and squeezed it with her bony fingers. “God, you really are nice, aren’t you. I mean, I knew you were, but then I thought you being a celebrity it must all go to your head, and maybe I just hadn’t noticed it last time because I was so nervous about making a good impression.”
“There’s a clothes cauldron in the basement,” Draco said. “Come on, I’ll show you.”
Draco considered the proposition. He rarely kissed and he certainly never spent the night. But Potter looked so miserable, so anguished and disconsolate in his uncertainty, and Draco could fix that, with his very presence he could fix that. What’s more, he wanted to.
Once he was clean and dry, Draco eased under the quilt, mindful not to wake Harry. He felt much more in control of himself now, the flare of self-consciousness and anxiety from earlier had receded. He could acknowledge he’d been off kilter as a result of the events from the day, and perhaps he’d spiraled out. Also, he was finding that, when it came to Harry, giving voice to his concerns actually tended to bring on a rapid resolution. It was not a phenomenon to which he was accustomed.
Harry resented the other students milling about the library which prevented him from kissing Malfoy sweetly and solidly like he wanted. Merlin, he hoped Draco didn't think he was ashamed of him or something. It wasn't that at all, hell, half the time Harry dreamed of being able to just kiss the boy whenever he wanted, in front of whoever cared to look. It was just complicated. Too many things were complicated.
Clark beamed. “Next week, you won’t get in at all, I swear.”
“Your love is pure as morning dew...and filthy as a tar pit.”
“Ronald, did you miss the part about his bloody father
“Is it still there, then, where I marked you up?” Potter inquired. “Of course it is, I saw it this morning. You put a glamour over it? I can’t believe I didn’t notice. Or I can, rather, I’m so bloody distracted these days.”
“Oh!” Scor said brightly. “That sounds familiar, yes, that’s it.”
“Harry,” prompted Jared, absently wriggling half onto Harry's lap. “Why’ve you stopped?”
“Geroff—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Kiss my neck again.”
Harry gawked, “What do you mean what’s in it for you? Hopefully some physical safety!”
“Yeah,” Harry said quietly, studying Draco’s face as though he were looking for something. “Well, thanks, then. Sorry Lily stole your broom.”
didn’t spin it into something nasty. Sensing the sentiment in the room currently, however, he got the feeling it would say what he needed it to. This crowd still wanted to celebrate him as a hero, to take solace in the idea that the loss of their loved ones meant something. The newspaper would be foolish to try and deprive the public of that.
“Not likely,” Harry grumbled.
It was Harry’s turn to flush with embarrassment. It had somehow been easier thinking Draco wasn’t watching him.
“You son’s right,” Malfoy concluded softly. The previous anger had been replaced with a tentative consideration. “I’m sure we can settle this matter like adults. I cannot begrudge you your concern for my child’s welfare, Potter, but I assure you: you are quite mistaken as to my intentions.”
“Yeah, but what are you going to
The meditation that Draco led them through was surprisingly effective. Harry felt focused and sharp coming out of it. His lungs felt bigger, his back expanded...possibly from the amount of times Draco had shouted “Posture, Potter, attend to the body!” at him while he breathed. Harry wondered if they should be presenting more of a united front to the boy, but he supposed that was unlikely to happen with Malfoy, anyway, so no point in being fussed about it.
“Coldwell, Grimwood, with me!” Owens shouted, as though he were on a battlefield, and not having a go at a simple Defence exercise. In a tunnel somewhere, Scorpius knew Al would be rolling his eyes.
“Alright there, Potter?” Malfoy inquired, a pale, perfectly sculpted eyebrow raised.
Just a quick little chapter, I know! More to come soon, promise.
Malfoy’s own palms came to rest along Harry’s ribs. The gesture was almost timid, and Harry wondered all at once if maybe he had assumed Malfoy’s experience to be greater than what it actually was. The man had been with other men, certainly, but maybe not quite like this. That Harry’s touch could reduce the otherwise prickly, particular Malfoy to the needy, pliant creature currently in his arms was unexpectedly electrifying. It felt like a secret to which only Harry was privy.
“Well, you know, now he’s back on the market…” Fort gave an exaggerated wiggle of her dark eyebrows, then seemed to realise what she’d just admitted and cringed guiltily.
“Alright?” Harry asked him.
Harry shoved down his pants, taking his cock in his hand in earnest, “Touch yourself. Keep yourself desperate,” he ordered.
“You didn’t?” Draco asked, trying to examine his fingernails in a blasé sort of way, but composure was difficult to maintain while being hauled down the corridor. “Shame.”
Seamus wandered up to the table, then, “Gentlemen,” he greeted, stealing Dean’s mug from the table and taking a sip. “Merlin, babe,” he whined, “ever heard of sugar, what’s wrong with you?”
Potter cocked his head to one side, tapping his finger against the surface of the table. “No,” he said, “it isn’t.”
“Better than I was, thanks,” he replied.
After the younger students filed out, Harry approached the group of witches at the front of the room.
“Yeah, well, just because it wasn’t the absolute worst case scenario doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to have feelings about it,” Harry pointed out.
was telling him, was a unique potion in that to be effective, two parties had to imbibe it at the same moment.
’ed the lamp, walking towards the door.
Harry jabbed his wand into Draco’s ribs, subtly. Malfoy clenched his jaw.
“It’s certainly inventive,” Draco allowed.
“Fucking right, I did. You’re not my fucking protector,” Malfoy snarled.
At least that was true. After a practice, Harry would often consume the entire pantry, just to make up for the energy deficit that came with training with the Falcons.
“Sit down, Potter,” that was Draco, but Draco hadn’t been there that night. Was it that night? Harry’s memories overlapped sickeningly. “Now.” It was definitely Draco’s voice. Clipped and insistent with none of his usual drawl. Instead there was a certainty and a confidence to which Harry clung. Nothing to worry about, he tried to tell himself. Draco wasn't worried. He would take this in hand, he always did. Harry braved a shallow breath; it came easier now. A hand on his shoulder directed him backwards until he felt something solid behind the back of his knees. It was a bed, his brain supplied, and Harry let himself drop, leaning forward, head in hands, waiting for things to slow down, to consolidate into reality. Draco was before him, perched on one knee, a cool hand on Harry’s cheek.
For a wild, charged moment, Draco thought Weasley was going to lunge across the dinner table at him, scattering plates and silverware onto the scuffed hardwood. The moment was interrupted, however, when a glass shattered in the next room, startling them both. Draco was the first to compose himself.
It was an empty threat. No Slytherin, not even Fife, would ever sink low enough to snitch, and Professor Longbottom’s detentions were notoriously pleasant. Nevertheless, the words rankled. Fife was the only person Scorpius knew who still thought jokes like that were funny, or even acceptable, and after Scorpius’ revelation that morning, the jab felt particularly objectionable.
Constance gave him an affronted look. His sin of missing breakfast had not gone unnoticed.
“Do you want to know what I think?” Draco asked.
After classes had finished for the day, Harry headed down to the kitchens to meet with Winky and Breety. Breety, it turned out, was a toothless, wizened old elf who nodded and smiled endlessly as she spoke, her voice warm and creaky with age.
a Legilimens? I thought they were awfully rare.”
“Yeah," Al agreed glumly. "I guess that's alright."
“I’d rather you told me now,” Draco said quietly.
“No,” Ron said firmly. “I’ll work with George at the shop. It’s doing well and he’ll pay me decent wages.”
“I could tell,” Harry replied. “You’re so stubborn sometimes—not giving in when you need to, even when it will do you some good.”
gay,” Draco observed, taking a languid sip of his tea.
“So many warnings,” she sighed. “Some wizards and witches see a banshee as a harbinger of death, allowing people to prepare for a loss. They consider them more agents of good, and suppose ridding yourself of one will shackle you with decades of bad luck.”
“Nothing deters you, hm?” he commented assessingly.
“Manners, Lily,” Potter interjected.
“Where’re my glasses?” Harry asked.
“Draco, stop,” Harry cut him off. He covered Draco’s free hand with his. The man didn’t pull away. “I know it’s too much too soon and seeing me everyday is more than we bargained for. But for my sake, it’s not something I can just turn off. I still want it, still want you.”
“Clark,” Harry explained. “She tried to get me to kill Draco, just before you arrived.”
Harry was torn between pushing the Draco off him, and pulling him close. Draco’s touch always made him feel better, even now, when everything else about him frustrated Harry to no end.
“Just her Patronus. They also work as messengers. Not a common Death Eater form of communication, sounds like?” Harry asked, chuckling at Draco's expression.
He thought again about Clark’s limp body in his arms and shuddered.
Harry had almost forgotten what civil conversation sounded like. “Oh!” He said, his gaze flicking to Jamie to see if the boy would once again be on the offensive, but he seemed placated enough, for now. “Er, I just didn’t know much of what else I would be good at, after the war. Didn’t quite reckon on there being quite so much paperwork.” Harry was on a parental leave for the time being, and he’d not really had time to miss his work. While his career had started out with boots on the ground, infiltrating and raiding underground Death Eater meetings, Ginny had talked him into something more mild when the kids arrived. He’d ended up in the Corruption of Magical Components branch of the department, and he felt more like a shipping clerk a lot of the time: fielding complaints about mismanaged or damaged goods. A great majority of the time, he simply settled disputes: there was very little law enforcement to be carried out at all. If he were honest with himself, it had been a long time since he truly enjoyed his work or even felt all that useful. For the most part, it was just interesting enough to keep him occupied, and paid well enough for them not to be too fastidious with the budget. It had felt comfortable, although not exactly compelling.
An extra special thanks to my superlative beta, Mimbelwimbel for her wise observations and willingness to discuss fic with me endlessly!
“Except I do, apparently.” Despite Harry’s blush, Draco didn’t desist. “Shall I try something else? I find you very appealing,” he continued matter-of-factly.
and it turns out that spell is already used at salons. So I opted for
“No. On another matter altogether. We’ll speak on it after dinner.”
“How long is this behaviour going to continue?” Harry asked them.
“About earlier, I’m sorry,” Potter said. Well, rather he gulped, looking like he’d swallowed something unexpectedly bulky. He cleared his throat again. “I shouldn’t have assumed you would...I overreacted.”
As if summoned by his words, a broad-faced, blond witch appeared. She wore clothes Harry could barely begin to describe: black trousers that appeared loose and billowing from thigh to mid-calf, where they sharply tapered and clung tightly down to her ankles. Her spotless white top was more geometry than attire, a stark inverted triangle from shoulders to navel, her tanned sides exposed. On her feet were aggressively yellow deck shoes.
“I know it's new, but I'd like to try. I want to feel that close. I don't want you to hide from me, sweetheart. May I?" Harry tried to keep his tone measured. He felt like Draco was more self-conscious than disinterested and his suspicions were confirmed when, with a pathetic, anxious chirrup, Draco parted his knees, granting Harry access.
scar under his touch. Malfoy shuddered.
“Just faffing about,” Al admitted. “It wasn’t any fun without you, though. I came by earlier but I didn’t see you. You weren’t in the library either.”
“Bird...Hiram?” Fischel asked.
Potter held his gaze for a moment longer, then gave a disarming smile. “Yeah, alright,” he said. “Be back in a bit.”
“Ginny hated that tendency,” he continued. “She was always on about the silent treatment being an emotionally manipulative and small minded tactic and no substitute for open communication and all that. When we were first married, she was very frank about things, chiding me and being a good sport even when I was forgetful or distracted or untidy.”
Another gag, harder this time. Harry didn’t pull back. “Swallow, baby, don’t fight it.”
"You've met my Da, you knew what you were getting into," the Irish boy grinned, non-apologetically.
“Stay,” Malfoy demanded, “just for a few hours.”
“I love Neville,” Ginny said, miserably, taking a long gulp of cider, “but I’m also seventeen. I don’t know why everyone thinks I have to commit to a fucking lifetime of someone right now. I’m not you or Hermione, alright? I’m still sorting it out.”
“I guess that's why I came here. I was hoping I could maybe just keep busy, drown it out with school and studying and quidditch, but it must not be enough. ”
“If anyone would let me within fifty miles of St. Mungo’s, I think I’d enjoy healing. Every patient is a puzzle that you get to sort out. I’ve always been quite quick with puzzles. Sparing that, perhaps I could at least work in medicinal potions. More likely though, I’ll end up in industry, brewing and bottling in a back room somewhere, where my name can’t poison anyone’s good reputation.”
Harry couldn’t think of anything he’d like to do less than sit in a snooty restaurant letting others make their judgments about his relationship and putting Draco at risk like that.
“Merlin!” He cried out, reaching out to accept the map, “You found it! How on earth—?”
He regretted it the moment he knocked. Jesus, he wished he could take that knock back, because what on earth was he supposed to say?
“You just had dinner,” Potter pointed out.
“Hello, love,” Draco said smoothly, stepping in to kiss Harry’s cheek. He took that opportunity to murmur “For Merlin’s sake, relax, it’s lunch, not a breaking wheel,” in Harry’s ear.
Harry looked to each group as they entered, hoping to see the gangly first year among them, but his hopes were dashed by group after empty-handed group.
Thanks as always to everyone who took the time to read/kudos and especially comment. Nothing so motivating as external validation, honestly 😂 ❤︎
“It doesn’t bother me,” Harry shrugged, passing the potatoes.
“I could, but I shan’t,” Ri informed him.
“Whoa,” said Harry.
“I'm just...scared,” Harry admitted, “More than that, I’m fucking paralyzed. Every damn day I keep thinking, just go. Just get to where you can apparate, just use the Floo, fuck it, take your damn
“Draco!” Harry laughed, “That’s horrid advice!”
“Well, yes, obviously,” Draco pushed onward, “I haven’t either, exactly, except on my own.”
“You’ve had your fun,” growled Harry, “it’s my turn now. Clothes off, please. Do not make me ask again.”
“As I’m sure you expected by now, Ada Lum appears to have been influenced by a similar mechanism to Clark Tiering,” Professor McGonagall revealed to Harry, Ron and Hermione a few days later, in her office, “She awoke from her coma last week and I spoke with her myself. Thankfully, the—was it seven?—stunning spells have caused no permanent damage, and if anything, Miss Lum seems rather excited to have a story to tell. Of course, I have encouraged her very strongly to keep that story to herself...but I am prepared for rumours to circulate amongst the younger student body.”
“You’re aware that there are spells for such things?”
Harry sipped his beer.
Thank you SO much for your patience. Everything is an exhausting mess right now, but so it goes. Thanks for reading and commenting and being so generous with your time and enthusiasm.
“There was a woman...in my head, she tried to speak to me.”
Draco grimaced, watching Harry’s sweat evaporate in the frigid night air, “You’re a bit ripe, Potter.”
Scorpius was still a little in shock over the whole thing, he thought, and he was clearly staring when Father turned back towards him.
think they have a right to you, that you somehow owe the public a detailed account of your romantic entanglements or personal connections.” He planted another kiss and Harry leaned into it this time. Draco pulled back, and gave Harry a condescending pat to his cheek. “You don’t. You owe them nothing, except perhaps a vicious libel suit.”
Potter looked up, surprised. “Is that really how you see your mother and father?”
“Yeah, but still. Can’t they give you something to counteract the exhaustion? Coffee or the like?”
“It’s...it’s humiliating. Undignified,” Draco spluttered.
any spectators."
“It’s not great for purebloods from old wizarding families, either,” Draco said, darkly.
“Harry!” Ron bellowed, drawing glances from the students filing in for lunch. He grabbed Harry into an exuberant hug, “Alright?”
Harry wasn’t having any more success; Hermione’s
“You are such a bossy git,” Harry laughed, wrapping a hand around the back of Malfoy’s neck and drawing him in for a kiss. Draco kissed back with a furtive energy and Harry realised that the other boy was nervous. Good, Harry thought, because he was nervous, too. Somehow he knew it would be easier for Draco if he pretended not to be. He grabbed a rough handful of Malfoy’s arse, kissing him harder and pressing into him. Draco practically purred against him, as predicted, he knew how much the slighter boy liked being man-handled. He gave Draco a shove, not so much hard as unexpected, causing him to trip backwards onto the bed. Harry was on him in an instant like a predator, teeth against his neck.
“I’m so sorry. That sounds horrid."
“Say, you’re rather chummy with one of the Potter boys, aren’t you?” Main asked, even though he most certainly knew that Scorpius was.
“No,” Draco replied softly. “I can do it.”
“Was it something you don’t want me to know?”
still have classes today, you know.”
The fine-boned, austere woman in the painting glared at him, “How dare you call me that? Catamite blood traitor, you’re no family of mine, I would burn you from the tree myself if I could.”
on me, I didn’t find it too terrible, I was able to deflect her fairly easily. She was a bit mad, I think, jealous. She’d wanted another way to make me, and by proxy my father, look bad. At the end of the day, it didn't make much of a difference, though. Voldemort and even Dumbledore always could see right through me.”
“Yes, alright,” Draco allowed, transferring him the infant. Harry sat back down on the bed, propped up by the headboard, his legs crossed in front of him. Draco tucked himself under the warm covers.
“Me?” Al sat up, quirking his head to the side curiously. “I’m fine, why wouldn’t I be?”
Draco gave him a thin smile, and said “Well done, Potter.” Harry immediately regretted not telling him alone. Hermione had just got him all excited about it again and then they ran into Ron and Draco playing Wizard's Chess and she was nodding encouragingly and it had burst out of him. Draco liberated the basket of pastries from him and buttered a scone.
Clark gave a tiny nod.
“You lied?” Clark demanded.
Harry looked down at the item in his hands. ‘
Clark gave a determined nod.
to be your representation in a civil dispute.”
“I didn’t need it.”
“I have,” he said.
Harry smiled, shifting upwards so his face was in the crook between Draco’s chest and neck. “Keep it that way,” he insisted.
“Let me take a look,” Hermione insisted, stepping close. She smiled calmly at the little lad, and he gurgled back at her. “I don’t know,” she sighed. “He seems fine, and crying is a good sign, but best not to risk it with babies. You should probably take him to St. Mungo’s just to be safe.”
Harry put away his quill and gathered his school books for the day. He then poked his head inside his own bed curtains.
“And we can’t wait to leap about like Coozits for the rest of the day,” Malfoy replied, brown-nosing grin still intact, “Potter, gather our supplies, would you?” He opened the potions textbook to the appropriate page and slid it across the table.
“Do you want to cum?” Harry asked nonchalantly.
for good measure, then shoved Malfoy against the stone shelving, kissing him ferociously.
In other news, I have a bit of a cache of (lengthier) chapters saved up that I'm still editing, but I suspect I will be updating weekly for the next couple of weeks at least. Thanks so much!
Clark stuffed his hands in his pockets, his freckled nose wrinkling. “If anyone can take care of themselves, you’d think it would be him.”
The mass of eighth years scampered down the hall towards the staircase, Harry grabbing Draco by the forearm as the
“Yeah?” Harry asked.
"You are safe here, you know. We wouldn't let anything happen to you."
. On weekends, he spikes it all upright!”
“Yes?” he replied instead, doing his best to sound long-suffering.
Something grim and incandescent flashed inside Draco. It felt a lot like anger.
Kreacher looked offended, “Sit, Master,” he insisted, “Kreacher will see to tea and heat a steak and kidney pie he has prepared for this occasion.”
“‘Course we do,” Harry echoes.
“If you like,” Draco replied.
Draco rested his forehead on the cool wood of a cabinet. He tried not to think about Potter’s skin under his teeth, about the flare of Potter’s pupils and the unwitting hitch in his breath, how for just a moment, he had convinced himself that Potter wanted him, too.
“Good evening,” Draco replied smoothly, in his most cut-glass accent. “I’m sure I can’t imagine what this is about.”
“Intriguing,” Draco mused, evaluating this new information. It certainly illuminated his conversation with Scorpius. He’d wondered about inciting events himself, but he’d not wanted to make a guinea pig out of his child. He wasn’t surprised he hadn’t come across these particular triggers himself. He didn’t allow a great deal of sweets in the home, and Scorpius had never been much interested in athletics. “And did he say what his intentions were, your terrible child? What were his plans for the prophecies he accumulated?”
“Ronald, that is enough,” Hermione admonished. “And yes, Professor, you would think so, but really, it’s a lot of sitting in meetings and massaging egos.”
“Dad?” Lily prompted.
He whiled away the hours doing not much of anything, just sitting on a window ledge in one of the flanking turrets and watching the stars. He looked south, automatically seeking out the familiar collection of stars which together formed Scorpius. He’d done just this many nights with his friend. Scor was clever with Astronomy, rattling of facts and pointing out planets, falling silent only if he thought he heard footfalls on the stairs, then shooting Al a guilty grin when he realised it was nothing.
For Harry, the bitter words stirred up a maelstrom of anger and despair. There was a bright surge of cold fury within him, because Ginny, fucking Ginny, how could she? This was the night before the boys headed back to school, and she was nowhere to be found. No one had said anything, but surely they’d all been thinking it. Her absence was a commitment to spending another three months without laying eyes on Jamie and Al and that was nothing short of egregious. Whatever her reasons, whatever Harry had done to make her run, or however he’d had taken her for granted, he was finding himself less and less able to forgive or excuse her decision.
“Harry!” Claire Gibbens cornered Harry in the hall after Transfiguration. It was his own fault, really. He’d told Ron and Hermione to go ahead while he apologised to an uncharacteristically understanding McGonagall.
“Ms. Provincel?” The minister deferred.
“I was having a dream,” Draco repeated, and Merlin if he couldn’t quite rid himself of that snobbish drawl. Harry gritted his teeth. Malfoy certainly wasn’t doing himself any favours. “My best guess is that I cast a spell in my sleep. It brought me here.”
Malfoy nodded, “Lott, Milton. I need to speak with Mr. Potter, if you don’t mind.”
“Oh. Oh yes of course, Mr. Potter, such a pleasure to meet you. I’m Georgina Provincel, a case worker here.” She extended a hand and Harry shook it, motioning for Clark to sit.
“Think about it. The dormitories, the dungeons, she can’t reach the students due to the amulets, so she’s controlling the ghosts. I didn’t even know they were susceptible to Legimens, but maybe with this blasted blue moon—”
“Good,” Hermione remarked, approvingly. She always did like to teach. “Well. That was quite the story, Harry. Never thought I’d see you willingly seeking out Draco Malfoy’s company, Merlin.”

Includes: anal, spanking, rimming, possessive language, stress positions, D/s dynamics, denial, ruined orgasm, could be interpreted as consensual non-consent ("no" is ignored but safe word is not used, not intended/interpreted by either party as dubious consent, just part of the dynamic).
“I’m an excellent snogger, I couldn’t possibly fuck it up,” Draco assured him.
Draco shrugged, “Even when he does, I can’t believe him. He’s always said what he has needed to say to get his way. I don’t suspect he has a grain of anything other than self-preservation left. And the letters he writes to me, Merlin. Brimful of all the stuff I longed to hear him say for most of my life. All the stuff he denied me. But it’s meaningless now, isn’t it? It mattered when I thought his respect was worth something. Now I know him and his opinions are shit.” A shudder ran through him that Harry felt it in his body, too.
“He knows the warning signs. If he feels an attack coming on, he will let you know. The paediatric healers at St. Mungo’s know his history, should you need to take him there. I will, unfortunately, be difficult to contact for the duration. I spend much of August gathering supplies for the school year.”
The question burbled forth eventually: “Why did Mr. Weasley think you’d hurt Rose?”
“Yes, you may, thank you.”
Harry shouted back that everything was fine, and Draco returned to observing Weasley’s glowering aspect.
“Alright. Well. Er, thanks, Malfoy,” Potter dug around and held out a small bag of coins.
Harry kissed him again, once, just quickly. “You could have just done it,” he groused.
“I guess you know what it’s like to be noticed, then,” Harry reasoned.
“It’s alright,” Dudley said quickly, “Tanya knows about all that.”
He yanked his hands off Malfoy like he’d been burned.
“This...with Potter and I…We...” The false starts clogged Draco’s throat and he tried to clear them away with a swallow of hot tea. When he did speak, the words came out in a humiliating rush: “I’ll admit it feels like it could be something. But beyond that I couldn’t tell you,” Draco informed her, cursing the flush he felt bloom high on his cheeks. “Because I don’t rightly know myself. I am, however,
"No," Harry shook his head, "I'll be fine." His eyes flicked back to the other boys. "You're both alright? Unharmed?"
Harry kissed him. “I love you,” he said. “Thank you for this.”
Harry was relieved that only silence followed his words. It gave him time to decide how far to skip ahead. There was the business with the Philosopher’s Stone and Sirius, but there would be time for that another day. Today, he would try to be concise.
Draco had nearly forgotten how grotesquely absurd the entire ordeal was, as well as the breadth of his own sickening devastation at the time. It felt somehow reaffirming to have an outsider remind him that it really was as terrible as he remembered.
“Classic,” Ginny sighed, “Honestly, Harry. If Hermione’s not cleaning up after Ron, she’s certainly not going to spend her life cleaning up after you, either! You ought to be paying her a retainer.”
“Saying this stuff. Like I say I kind of want you around and you come in with a chilling ‘I see’. Not exactly reciprocity, is it?”
to be. Scorpius swallowed down a heap of guilt and stole down the corridor as silently as he possibly could.
“Will you be able to get some sleep?”
“I am. I sent an owl when I arrived home last night.”
“Daddy, no!” Lily said crossly. “You haven’t even sung yet, it’s still my turn!”
Harry kissed shushing noises to Draco’s neck, stroking his cock slowly.
At last, Headmistress McGonagall raised her hand “Not to devalue Mr. Potter and his allies' significant achievements, nor Mr. Finnegan’s effusiveness, but we have finite time before classes, and so I would like to encourage everyone to take the time to finish their breakfasts.”
It is also from a kids' book called
“I don’t want to start a war, not really,” Clark noted.
“What do you mean?” He prompted.
“Well, I’m terribly grateful, and I know Father is, too,” Scorpius said graciously, then froze as if just thinking of something for the first time. He looked suddenly horrified.
“Usually, yes. Why, is there something you would like to discuss?”
Across the pitch, Harry watched Malfoy pace back and forth in front of his team, lecturing. He bit back a grin because it was just so classically Draco.
All of the sudden, Harry became brutally aware of the bulk of his body, the cramped space, the necessity of limbs. In the entrance hall, that had all bled away, but then again they’d been standing. They hadn’t had Malfoy’s knees up between them like an awkward median. He wanted to push his own knee up alongside Draco’s body, press into him, contain him, but he didn’t know what he was allowed.
want someone else to see. And I didn’t help matters, telling you not to like that. Besides, now you know the basics, and you know what it’s like. Next time will be easier, and then the time after that and then the time after that. You already know the meditation piece, and you were getting there, I could see it. You’ll get there, I know you will. You’ll make your brain a fortress.”
“Since you went and left him on his own!” Jamie fired back.
"Back at me, Harry," Draco prompted gently. Harry dropped his gaze as directed. "You see me now?"
Harry and Draco stood outside the phone box waiting for Clark to make the call. They both knew before he exited that it wasn’t good news. Or, rather, it wasn’t any news at all.
“Well?” Draco prompted, sipping his Firewhisky.
“Oi!” Ron objected, “I am not!” He was glaring at where Harry’s hand gripped Draco’s jumper as though even the barest contact was a betrayal. Draco shifted away, and Harry felt a rush of helpless hurt. This wasn’t supposed to be so hard.
Harry was surprised at the intensity of the other boy’s words.
“Malfoy,” Harry said suddenly, interrupting Ron’s counterpoint, “Would you like to come to the DA meeting tonight?”
“I’m sure like any group, the goblins are not homogenous in their politics,” Draco informed him, smartly, "Haven't you been listening to Professor Haberdash-Pewter?"
Ginny blew her whistle, “Enough berating your team, Malfoy! We’ve got to do an equipment trade off so the next two teams can get started!”
“What?”
Draco closed his eyes, focusing on the two points of pressure on the fine bone of his mandible. He pictured his bones as ripe for the snapping. He didn’t want an interrogation, he wanted violence. He wanted to suffer at Potter’s hands.
Harry swallowed before bending the limb upwards as Madam Pomfrey had demonstrated, trying not to move too quickly. Malfoy closed his eyes and exhaled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh,” Harry said, “er, yeah, alright then.”
“This isn’t how I’d hoped the night would end,” Harry admitted. “Will you stay anyway?”
He pictured Malfoy naked and writhing, being brought to the brink by some nameless man in an upscale hotel. The vision brought with it a vicious streak of icy, unearned jealousy which cut Harry through. “Is this what you do,” he accused, “when you find your men? You let them put their hands and mouths on the marks I left on you?” He sounded unhinged, and he knew it, but Malfoy inspired a possessiveness Harry could barely comprehend.
On one of the beds, Karanjeet Atwal was lying, body rigid in what Harry recognised immediately to be a body bind. On another, was Clark: tossing his head and blinking and checking his watch.
“Bird Hiram’s actually an incredibly clever owl, Hi, you’re just jealous,” Clark corrected. The nickname was new, Harry thought, and Merlin, he really was glad the kid had made a friend.
“It’s a Patronus. Mostly used for shielding one from dementors, but you’re unlikely to run into them any time soon. Still, handy for sending messages, if you don’t mind being a bit showy about it.”
“I don’t think you’re weak; that’s not what I said.” Draco matched Harry’s huffy tone.
“Not the time, Malfoy,” he muttered, trying desperately not to picture Draco writhing beneath him, hands braced against Harry’s unrelenting thighs. The image made Harry breathless and the momentary distraction left him overcome. The fuchsia pearls were coming too fast and numerous, he had no hope of catching them all now. They splattered across him like rain and Harry grunted in irritation.
“Doesn’t sound like you’ve had things easy,” Harry reflected, “I’m sorry.”
“You sure?”
Their session ended. Draco was outside the room, waiting and perusing an Arithmancy textbook. He stood when he saw Harry.
The sandy-haired boy only laughed, “Sorry, Potter,” he said, not sounding sorry at all, “couldn’t help myself.”
“Er, I didn’t have any. Didn’t know Draco particularly needed a day to be fussed over and adored.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry, lovey,” his mother was saying between sobs, “I won’t do it again, I’m such a terrible mother, I’m so sorry, you’ll forgive me, won’t you? I just forgot, it was just a little mistake. He’ll be okay.”
“Shut up,” Potter muttered.  They lay there silently, their breaths coming in tandem.
“Because everything’s easy for him and he’s still fucking whinges all the bloody time,” Al blurted out, then bit down on his bottom lip, as though he’d said too much.
“Now, Draco,” Harry said, letting a sharp note of control colour his words.
“I can change a nappy, Potter,” Draco informed the man. “Just point me in the right direction.”
“Yes?”
“There will be no shagging!” Draco insisted.
“Dad has it,” Jamie muttered.
Draco took Scorpius’ upper arms in his hands, giving them a comforting squeeze. He tried to peer under the boy’s fringe to capture his expression. Scorpius raised his chin a fraction of an inch, and Draco saw tears drop to the rug below.
“Sure,” Scorpius managed to agree.
“What’s this?” Harry asked, nonplussed.
“Well, far be it for me to stand in the way of your masculine bonding rituals.” Draco remarked, wrapping an arm around Harry’s waist to steady him while Ron saw to rinsing out the tumblers. “Night, Weasley.”
“But you were just angry, you were just talking!” Scorpius snuffled wetly into his cheek. “You weren’t going to hurt Al, I know you weren’t!”
“I’ll be damned if I’m going to turn a blind eye to this,” Harry assured him. “I’ll keep Scorpius here all day if I deem it necessary. I will not see him hurt.”
Harry looked up from his soup.
They meandered through the usual chitchat—Draco seemed particularly interested in the Grangers’ explanations of muggle dentistry—and then they were all summoned by Mrs. Weasley to the dining room table.
“No,” Harry determined, looking torn. He stepped closer, stroking Draco’s hair. “I’m not saying not ever, we can talk about it, work up to it, but...I’m sorry, sweetheart. I want to help, to give you what you need, but, I’m sorry, I...I’m not ready for something like that. I couldn’t bear it if I took things too far. I can’t do this if I don’t know you’ll stop me if you have to.”
“Poor kid? Poor me. That was a completely unnecessary and unprovoked attack,” Draco whinged haughtily.
Scorpius felt Al bump shoulders with him. Glancing over, Scorpius saw his friend eyeing the wooden structure before them with shrewd excitement. Professor Potter had conjured a fantastic open-air series of ramps, ladders, platforms, tunnels, and slides, and Slytherins and Ravenclaws alike had been impatiently waiting for the go ahead to try it out. They’d not been allowed until they’d practiced their
The ghost searched about the room, helplessly.
“What?” Draco asked.
happen. If we don’t work, I’ll walk away, I will, just...don’t discount me yet.”
Panic clutched at Draco’s heart, but he didn’t have time to heed it. An episode hadn’t occurred in public in years. The dosing by all accounts should be working, and he’d given Scorpius his medicine the evening before, he was certain. Damn Albus Potter and his dangerous meddling. They needed to get out of here this very instant.
“It’s just a potion,” he muttered, “it wouldn’t kill you to relax.”
“Right…” Scorpius hazarded. How did he always get tangled up in every mad idea a Potter ever had? “Can your assistant use the toilet first, please?”
“Sorry, Harry,” Hermione said. “I’ve got to go and check in with everyone, make sure nothing else has happened. McGonagall will make an announcement, I’m sure.”
“Thanks,” Harry accepted, then sighed. “I wish you didn’t have to go,” he admitted.
“You’re old enough to understand that creating a spell and putting it out into the world without a method of reversing it is beyond irresponsible: It is reckless,” Draco explained, his tone professorial and direct. Jamie had said once that Professor Malfoy spoke to him like a grown-up, and Harry understood what he meant, now. Draco didn’t coddle and he didn’t sugarcoat. He expected a certain level of maturity from his students, and they, in turn, sought to meet that expectation, Al included—perhaps Al especially.
Harry was helping the small boy to his feet when the shouting began,
Harry could hear the cold, jealous edge to Al’s voice, and he could draw a conclusion easily enough. “And are you sure that your current poor opinion of him has nothing to do with him and Scorpius sharing an interest and you having feelings about it?”
"Fuck, Harry," Malfoy cried out, which only made Harry more attentive. taking the perfect bud between the edges of his teeth, threateningly. He ran his palms along Draco's trim waist, and hips, the curve of his thighs; there was nowhere he didn't want to touch him. He treated himself to a firm grope of Malfoy's skinny arse, then pressed soft kisses along his inner thighs.
And yet, for a breathtaking second, Harry wondered—if it weren’t for the children and Ron and the rest of the Weasleys, and how they deserved to hear about this first, and hear about it properly—if he would even care. The realisation was as sudden as it was firm: He wouldn’t. Not a jot. He’d be bloody proud to be seen hand-in-hand with Draco Malfoy who was so clever, so accomplished and, when he wanted to be, considerate.
“I hardly know,” Potter admitted. “Scorpius said he reckoned he needed to come here and so we did.”
“I hear you’ve started going with Harry!”
“Look at me,” Draco said, voice low and tinged with
“I’m looking forward to getting to know her better,” Harry stated. “Her father was good friends with your Uncle George, and Merlin, they made everyone laugh.”
Harry nodded.
Malfoy didn’t respond as the matron pressed her fingers to his wrist.
“Hm, maybe,” Harry considered, forcing his voice to remain nonchalant and measured, belying his desire. “Open yourself up for me and then I’ll decide.”
“Pleasure to meet you, Lily Potter,” Draco said, trying for cordial.
“I suspect it was more the accurate completion of the procedure than the results. He can be meticulous, when he gets something into his head.”
“Ah, Sir Nicholas,” Luna greeted him, as dreamily as ever, “thank you so much for your willingness to help us out.” Luna turned to address the students. “I’ve assembled the castle ghosts here so as to make sure we don’t make any errors in entrapment,” she explained. “We don’t know if the cwalus, or whatever the offending spirit may be, will even assume a ghostly or corporeal form, but it has done in the past. Please take a careful look before casting. The spell is reversible, but it would hardly be comfortable for phantom friends.”
“Had to make things convincing," Draco explained primly, "Besides, didn’t want you falling for a sweet, soft, version of me that I had no interest in upholding.”
“And I’m not offering it! Not exactly.”
“I’m sorry,” Clark muttered, instead of answering.
Finally, Draco seemed to put aside his tumultuous thoughts and he returned his gaze to Harry’s face. “Well, are you going to tell me what you’re doing here?” Draco asked finally.
“I did it!” He marveled, “I mean, I think I did it.”
? Whatever she may tell you, I do hope you realise that she certainly doesn’t
“I cannot dictate your principles,” Draco shrugged reluctantly. “You must pursue what you feel you must pursue, no matter what I think about it. You’ve always got a home with us. Whether you want it or not, your Nan will put aside money for you and it is yours to do with as you wish. If you want to donate it or import illegal arms, well. I can only hope you choose wisely.”
Ron adopted an unconvincing expression of nonchalance. Hermione gave him a curious look, but didn’t press the issue.
“What exactly was that?” Malfoy demanded, attempting in vain to shovel scrolls and envelopes off his breakfast plate.
Harry shrugged, looking away. His intention hadn't been to boast so much as ensure Zerk knew he was in his right mind about this. “I can be pig-headed. Don’t like being told what to do. Well. Typically. It’s a bit different with Draco. Oh Merlin, that probably sounded like innuendo but that's really not what I meant.”
Clark sought him out before lunch that Friday, all but shoving him into an empty classroom. His bony arms were crossed and he was glowering, but Harry had a feeling the boy was more scared than anything.
Hermione took a sip of her whisky. “Well, I can’t say I approve, exactly, but I guess I understand.”
“Alright,” Harry agreed, not  really knowing what else to say.
, he simply felt nothing but unease at the thought of his mother being nearby again. This was one thing he had never revealed to anyone, not to Father, not even to Al, who loved his own mother so much he couldn’t stand to think of her: Scorpius felt nothing but a crawling
Pansy stared at him, her full lips parting. She licked them. “Come again?” she asked carefully.
“Draco not here?” Harry asked.
“Doesn’t hurt that he’s a bit fit, either,” Fort said thoughtfully, snagging an apple from a fruit bowl and taking a large bite.
“Practice went that poorly, then?” Harry chuckled, sliding into a seat next to his boyfriend and digging out some charms homework.
“I’m sorry,” Harry repeated. “I don’t know what I was thinking, not telling them.”
Clark took a step forward and stumbled and Malfoy swept in, catching him easily, his hands bracing against the boy’s shoulders.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, I don’t know,” Hermione sighed, pulling on the silver chain around her neck. “Ron and Draco’s ridiculous one-up-manship over you has him looking like the cat that’s got the cream. Proprietorial. And like he wants to devour you whole, but also smug, as though he knows something we don’t.”
“Have you seen a Boggart?” she asked.
of the gesture, but he smoothed his features into a faint, polite smile.
Harry wasn’t convinced. What if he got up in front of his first class and couldn’t think of a single thing to say? Worse, what if he embarrassed Al and James? It was not a problem he could ever imagine Draco encountering. “I bet your lesson plans are immaculate.”
“Am I a shitty person if I like it better here?” Clark blurts the question out before he can stop himself. “I don’t want to, it feels like I’m betraying Mum, and I like seeing her, I do, it’s just...simpler here.”
“Maybe whoever it is stopped trying after being blocked by the amulets for so long. Then she just happened to try again.”
Harry heard a grumble of acknowledgement from the crowd, then plowed onward before they could get distracted. “I appreciate your concern in this matter,” he said trying his best to sound sincere, even though he didn’t appreciate it at all. He supposed, however, that he could understand it. “It is so touching to know so many of you are concerned for my well-being. And if such claims were true, then of course, they would be very appalling indeed.”
It seemed as though the restaurant had prepared for such a request. The closest candlelit table appeared nearly three meters away, and Harry could not make out the occupants, if there were any at all.
“You’re a good kid,” Harry said, stepping up behind Clark and putting his hands on his shoulders. He gave a comforting little squeeze. “You know that?”
The clerk scratched his nose. “He’s not in, but I could try the Floo, see if he's around. Suspect he’d come in for you.”
“Deal,” Harry agreed.
“Fuck,” Draco moaned, sliding his fingers throw Harry’s unruly hair. Harry smiled around the lovely cock, then sucked harder. He reached between the lean muscles of Draco’s parted thighs, stroking a light fingertip along Draco’s arsehole. Draco made a greedy little noise and spread further, shifting to allow Harry easier access. Harry teased the entrance idly for a while, running the pad of his finger back and forth, tracing little circles, and making Draco squirm.
try to tell me you were careful. But for Clark's sake, I’m glad you did. I’m somewhat attached to our odd little family, you know.”
It felt somehow momentous, that promise, made just then. Something grave and important swelled inside of him and Al became suddenly resolute. He’d get on with Jamie even if it killed him.
and I resent the fucking publicity team at the Arrows and I resent my relentless nightmares for wrecking this for me in the first place. And I resent Lavender’s bloody ghost and her spineless mother, and I resent Fenrir Greyback and Voldemort and the whole damn war.”
“You made fast work of it. Well, have you got reservations somewhere lush?”
“Fine,” Malfoy stated after a long moment, “I’ll be there.”
Zerk looked poised to speak but Harry’s anxiety was hitting its stride now, and he didn’t let him, barreling on instead: “But he’s not my kid, and I don’t want to do something unwelcome or that would make him uncomfortable, especially if he’s feeling insecure and like he should put up with it so I don't kick him out. And I don’t know how to be affectionate except with Draco, but that’s a different thing, isn’t it? And what if I accidentally lead Clark on? Not that I know what Clark’s sexuality is, or if he even knows. But he’s just a kid, and I’m, well, not really a kid, but not really an adult either, so things are trickier, aren't they? I don’t want to deprive him, but I don’t want to misstep either, and I’m just lost. No one ever fucking touched me as a kid so far back as I can remember, except to smack me upside the head or punch my nose in, so I just don’t know. And what if I have my own kids one day, I need to be able to touch them, right? Like, lovingly? I don't want to fuck them up, either! I just need you to, you know, help. Mind heal. Please.”
“Wait,” Jamie whispered. He sat up then, tucking his knees up to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. Harry perched on the side of the bed without speaking, not wanting to interrupt this tenuous trust his son was extending. Jamie chewed his lip for a minute, his cheeks colouring with an emotion Harry couldn’t place, not yet. “I thought it was you,” he said, finally. He looked down, his front teeth once again spearing his lip so hard it turned white around the indentation.
“Remind me again why we’re doing this?” Malfoy muttered darkly as he, Harry, Goyle and Ron traipsed their way down to the newly rebuilt quidditch pitch that evening.
“Yes.”
“We’re just playing it by ear,” Harry said, keeping his voice casual. He didn't want Clark to feel any more alienated by the situation than he already did. “We’ll see how Clark’s mum is come summer and go from there. I’m sure it will be fine, though.”
“Alright, Clark,” Harry said, “Say your goodbyes and we’ll be off.”
Clark nodded and crawled under the covers. Harry stood and
“How so?” There was genuine concern in Draco’s voice. It was as understated as the china, but concrete. Jamie was his student, and Harry’s son, and Draco cared about him. Harry knew he did. The knowledge ignited something soft and glowing in Harry’s core. He took a breath and summarised his talk with Jamie as best he could: how Jamie hadn’t wanted to return to school, his fears about Harry leaving him, how closely he’d clung to Harry’s side ever since.
Harry had to grin, not bloody likely. Well, pearls, maybe. Harry had a vision of a single pearl droplet on Draco’s perfect earlobe and gulped. That certainly
“Where is the line between letting yourself off the hook and refusing to acknowledge stupid mistakes?” he wondered. “Like, how do you know if you are being disciplined and being cognizant of your flaws and trying to make much needed changes or if you are just mercilessly berating yourself and making things worse?”
, for all she does.
"I'll decide what gets touched and when, thanks very much," he murmured, and Draco whined helplessly. Harry loved it.
“Right,” said Claire, a blush creeping along her cheeks and the bridge of her nose, “Well then. I guess I...won’t see you at practice this weekend.”
“Not terribly,” Draco retorted dryly. “So let’s stop asking, shall we?”
Malfoy was fastening the buttons on his shirt sleeve. The man was all lean lines and cut angles and even in yesterday’s clothes he appeared neatly pressed and striking. Because apparently Harry found men striking now.
“You think you would have chosen me?” Harry probed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nah, mate, really wasn’t,” Fort retorted unhelpfully, opening a package of crisps.
He followed the DADA instructor back towards the common room, scanning the space for any recurrences of fiendfyre. A throng of professors and older students was there, shepherding pajama-clad Slytherins out of the scorched area.
“Of course,” was all Draco said, then turned to Harry, “Have you seen anything of my Aunt Andromeda and Teddy over the break?”
“Nothing,” Draco answered quickly. “I’m just overthinking. It ought not to disturb both of our rests.”
Harry cracked a smile, “Poor kid.”
Harry laughed, then his face fell more solemn, “A lot of the post that’s been coming in has been going on about Harry Potter the auror, Harry Potter the politician, the spokesman. I wonder if I’m walking away from my responsibility by doing something as frivolous as sport.”
Curse the man and his accurate assessment of Jamie. “Fine,” Harry conceded. “Where to then? My bedroom?”
He can hear the faint echoes of Harry and Draco having a hushed conversation a floor below him. They’ll be deciding how effectively to tackle tomorrow, how best to care for him and Jared, and navigate the mess that can sometimes be their mum.
“Me?” Harry asked, flustered, “Oh, I’m well enough. Just…” He trailed off, looking into her eyes which were shaded by her hood. Her wide pupils made it difficult to read her expression. She wasn’t smiling, but her head was tilted to the side, listening. “How do you change someone?” He burst out, surprising himself.
