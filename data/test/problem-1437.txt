"Okay," he said resignedly, unballing his fists and forcing himself to breathe. "I will owl Malfoy. If you could have those files sent to my office as soon as you get authorization, I would really appreciate it. I will be in the field all day tomorrow so I won't be able to pick them up myself." That wasn't strictly speaking true, but Harry hoped against hope he'd paid his dues enough for the Universe to be satisfied.
He wanted to roll around in that smell. To fill his fur with it so he could carry it with him always.
"You're not bloody fine, Malfoy!" he shouted, taking an angry step closer to the blonde. "That's why you're here!"
Draco chuckled before closing the distance between their mouths to take Potter's lips in a heated kiss. There was something to be said for the man's enthusiasm, at least.
I should also point out that ONE post from Playout is missing. One. Let's see if anyone could tell where it was?
Draco eyed the way Harry immediately spooned his ice cream and plunged it in with the soufflé with a curious quirk of his brow. He had eaten ice cream (including strange and exotic flavors he was certain Harry'd never tried) and soufflés (baked by master chefs), but he never thought to mix the two at once. It seemed a bit plebeian, but...
Harry snorted. "Where's the poetry, Draco? Your characters speak so romantically to one another and all I get is weirdly violent come ons. I'm feeling deprived."
Harry furrowed his brow in confusion. Morias went to school with them? Why didn't he know him, then? It must be a penname. And Malfoy said it was a clue.
Malfoy led Harry through the labyrinthine interior of the Manor to one of many large and lavishly decorated rooms within the ancient house. A huge unlit fireplace dominated one wall, with pink and cream marble for both the mantelpiece and the hearth. An oriental rug the size of a cave troll covered most of the floor, which was a polished stone of indeterminate origin (and extraordinary cost, he was sure). A dark pink velvet settee, rose-papered walls, delicate gold filigree on the oil lamps, and a series of watercolour paintings depicting idyllic gardens in full bloom lent the space a decidedly feminine air.
He tilted his head to capture Draco's lips in a kiss and began walking him backwards in the direction of the stairs.
It was understandable. Having spent years apart, of course all Harry knew was who Draco had been. He hadn't had a lot of time with him as he was now. Still, Draco had hoped...
He charmed the scrub brush to clean the dishes and the washrag to dry them and put the kettle on the hob for tea. He didn't know if Draco planned on staying long enough to want it but it was no trouble to get it started just in case.
"Only hold my hand if you want to, I like most vegetables, I doubt you'll use any deadly hexes so I won't bother, and how did you even know I fancy her music? Not enough to attend a concert on my own dime, mind, but yes."
P.S. There had been plans for an epilogue (detailed plans) that I could do alone, but would anyone want that? I'm not as good as Playout--not by a mile. She was once an Editor, sooo....
That was kind of unexpected--to be perused in such a way. Potter's lovely green eyes seemed glued to his body for a few seconds too long, and what a delightful surprise that was. He quirked a brow and stood aside to allow the Auror room to move past his door. He closed it with a quiet click after and locked it with a basic charm. Normally, he would have cast enough locking charms to prevent even the Hogwarts teachers entrance...
...and that was the last semi-rational thought he was capable of having after Draco slotted their hips together and ground against him.
He slid the fingers that had been gripping Potter's prick into the neatly manicured patch of curls at the base and eased his mouth down the entirely of Potter's erection until it pressed against the back of his throat, continuing to tug and stroke his bollocks as he went. After a beat, he pulled back with a slow, sucking drag that hollowed his cheeks and made saliva pool where his lips were sealed around the silky skin.
It took a solid minute for Draco to regain his footing. He took a long, though quiet, breath and closed his eyes--counting to ten as patiently as he could. Once composed, he swiveled on the spot to face Potter again.
"How noble," Draco replied dryly. When he had talked about being carried, he didn't mean bridal style (though he hadn't really meant it at all... Even of it did leave butterflies in his stomach.) "Just don't be a prick and drop me somewhere hard, Harry. I mean it! Bruised arses are not sexy!"
As I write this letter, I am gazing longingly at a photo of you clipped from a recent issue of the Prophet. Your eyes are truly captivating, my dearest. I could drown in them. I would love to.
Harry needed a new best mate, he decided irritably as he stomped downstairs to Gladys's lair. Maybe Seamus was available. He was always good for a laugh and would do almost anything on a dare...including snogging Harry once, but they were both completely pissed at the time. (Harry only knew it had happened because Dean would never let either of them forget it; fortunately, what happens between Gryffindors stays between Gryffindors).
A wide grin nearly threatened, but Draco kept it at bay with great difficulty and a deep, discrete breath.
Pausing here and there to hide in the shadows when he thought he heard voices or sensed the presence of wandering ghosts, Draco ascended the dungeon stairway. His little nose quivered frantically at the many smells that accosted his senses when he passed the kitchens. Undeterred, he crossed the grand entrance, slunk beneath the gaze of slumbering portraits, and made his way into enemy territory. He sighed in resignation (the puff of air making his whiskers oddly tingly) and, steeling himself for the worst, wormed his too-malleable body beneath Potter's wooden door.
Hermione, bless her heart, had offered to come with him, leaving Ron at home with Rosie for the evening. But Harry hadn't wanted to expose her to this crowd--even if the word mudblood never crossed their lips, it would be clear as day in their disdainful sneers and limp-wristed, reluctant handshakes.
He kicked Malfoy's stance wider with the edge of his shoe and pulled him forward--nearly causing him to stumble--until their chests were flush. He then placed a possessive hand on either side of Malfoy's narrow hips and leaned to whisper in his ear, "Is this
"I'm going to go check on Ron and the rest," Hermione announced primly, standing and retrieving her heavy patchwork bag from where it slumped against a table leg. She rifled through it, displacing books and loose sheafs of notes in the process, to produce a neatly wrapped gift. "Happy birthday," she said (rather unhappily). She shoved it at him and stomped out of the room.
The dizzy, chaotic feelings of the afternoon coalesced into pure and simple want. It pooled hot and heavy in his gut.
He warmed at the realization that he was exactly where he had never dared hope to be, and that the boy he had been so hopelessly in love with all those years ago...
Gieves inclined his head in a minuscule bow. "Very well, Master Malfoy," he replied evenly. "I shall locate a house-elf to see me out."
He fisted one hand in Draco's jumper, knotted the other in his long hair, slotted their legs together, and crashed his mouth onto Draco's.
Malfoy's posture stiffened, this time for something other than his faulty synapses. Seconds passed in which he stared unblinkingly, chest rising and falling with his own laboured breathing (a combination of exertion and dismay the most likely cause).
I lumped Hermione in with the Weasleys--she and Ron aren't married yet but they will be soon. I see them most of all (mostly because Hermione worries if she doesn't check in on me at least once a week).
That would be most appreciated, since I would hate to say no. As for after, my home is plotless so they can't find it, at least. My job, on the other hand, I'm certain Kingsley can handle the press on my behalf if necessary. At least to get the reporters to leave during work hours.
he thought as he took a generous swig and leaned back against the ivory column just to the left of the drinks. It was covered in swirls of white and silver ivy that coincidentally matched his suit.
"Ready," he answered after clearing his throat. Focusing on Draco's masculine features, he reminded himself of the many things that differentiated mother and son, not the least of which was the fact Draco was the only one he wanted to have sex with...
"I set my recovery back at least three months because of my stupid pride," Harry answered frankly, holding Malfoy's thoughtful gaze. "I hope you can learn from my mistakes and not repeat them. I guarantee it'll save you some hardship. And if your medical professional tells you to do something," here he pointed unabashedly at himself, "you should do it."
"Stay here," he ordered Draco brusquely, locking down the adrenaline demanding he respond to the threat downstairs with swift and indiscriminate violence.
Draco fell back against the table, but before he had a chance to make any smart quips about their situation the Gryffindor was on him again--roughly driving his cock into Draco's own hardened member. He gasped aloud, his hands gripping Harry's waist tight.
The long walk up to the Manor proper gave Harry the perfect opportunity for a covert assessment. He noted absently that the fat little robin that had been keeping him company flew in ahead of them. Had the wards kept him out, as well? Harry wondered if they were set to prevent common wildlife from entering (and thereby sullying) the Manor's hallowed grounds and decided not to tell Malfoy about this other unwelcome visitor. He rather liked the cheeky bird.
"He's interesting," he explained hesitantly. "He makes me...interested. I mean, all the witches I've dated have just been so boring. They agree with everything I say and laugh at all my jokes and stare at me like I'm some kind of fucking living-legend and just lay there in bed letting me do whatever I want without actually participating and I'm bloody sick of it!" He gained steam as he spoke, leaning forward and gesturing wildly. "Malfoy actually listens to me and doesn't just do what I say and he challenges me and, Merlin, he's half daft and he drives me up the wall, but he
“Yeah, of course,” Harry replied quickly, earnestly (balancing a thick slice of toast on top of his food mountain and dousing the whole thing in rich brown gravy, his mouth watering at the almost erotic sight—Merlin’s tits he was
"This better be important, Draco," Pansy snapped, glaring murderously through the flames and looking perfectly demonic. "You've got five minutes before I hang up. I'm
As if he could sense the direction of Harry's thoughts, Malfoy scrutinized his reflection in the mirror with a pinched frown, arms outstretched. "I still feel as though you and the shopgirl are having me on," he said. "This can't possibly be how Muggles dress for sport."
You're the seeker? No offense, but you're not a "celebrity". How are you playing in this? Unless you kind of decided you have the right to or something, like you did in school. Not that I'm opposed to seeing you in Quidditch leathers again.
to get him out of his jumper if push came to shove. Plus he was eager to get his hands on that lovely, pale cock.
"Must be big if it's got you in a snit," the red-haired Auror added with a hint of hope. "Care to share with your partner?"
Harry leaned backwards to make it easier for Draco to lower the seat. Once they had a nice flat surface to work with, he rid Draco of his shirt and shoved him prone. Straddling Draco's thighs, he stripped off his own shirt and undid his flies (for which his newly-freed prick thanked him). Even though he knew Draco's assorted wards were thick enough to keep anyone outside from noticing them, there was still a small thrill at exposing himself out in the open like that. He palmed his prick and gave it a lazy tug. Draco's eyes watched the gesture hungrily and he flicked out his tongue to wet his lips.
He was out of breath by the time they made it to his room (but that had more to do with his anticipation than his exertion). He vanished Draco's clothes--having decided ahead of time that was entirely fair--and herded him with nudges and kisses until he tumbled backwards onto the bed.
Harry quietly scoffed. "It was Hermione throwing punches, not me," he countered, unsure as to what he even had to be mad about.
He meant that truly but he hoped Draco would opt to head back. (That blowjob sounded better by the moment...)
Sorry to be difficult. If you really do want to try having a go at this, that's something you'll have to deal with a lot, I'm afraid.
I haven't completely grown out of my reckless impulsiveness. I'm trying to be better, but it's everything I can do to keep from apparating to your doorstep right now. Has been since you told me you were gay (which was a revelation to me, as well, though I had wondered in school). That's why I said what I did. I was testing the waters and you surprised me by responding, but you've been surprising me since your first letter so at some point I should probably just expect it, shouldn't I?
Malfoy was telling the truth. That much was obvious. It was also obvious, despite his cavalier tone and careless shrugs, how badly the attack had shaken him.
"With your progressive attitude and so much, uh, opportunity around you, what stopped you from sleeping with anyone before now?"
"Did you have any doubt?" Draco said, in a way that implied that if Harry hadn't Draco certainly had. He leaned into the embrace to steal a kiss off his lover's lips, suckling the pink flesh gently. He pulled away before Weasley or Granger could notice. "Too bad I don't have any friends to test
They sank together into the wisps of his memory. It had been a while since Draco last went diving into a pensieve, and the odd feeling of drowning as his consciousness slipped away was no different. He blinked at the bright, flashing lights of the club. They stood near the edge of what was practically a mosh pit (with more hip gyrating); not far from three familiar faces.
Draco wrenched the door open, dragged Harry inside, and slammed his door--hard--before locking it back up.
Because there hadn't been an official start to their relationship--and least not one he was willing to tell people about--Harry had yet to figure out how to announce it. It had been a long time since the war, but those hurts ran deep. And the people he cared most about had been among those hurt most of all. He honestly didn't know how receptive they would be to the idea, even though Draco was a very different person these days.
And this just proves my point! Nothing can happen between us that wouldn't lead to disaster considering our pasts and personalities. It was a nice thought, and physical attraction is certainly not an issue (you are unquestionably fit), but we can't even have a conversation without conflict via
Since my job is apparently as your nursemaid, oh Vaunted One, I have taken it upon myself to clean out the disaster-zone you call a workspace.
But he could resonate with the impulse to just stay inside and avoid the public. He did that often enough himself. How Malfoy spoke so flippantly about such matters was disconcerting, though.
Harry didn't let up. With Draco now facing him, he placed a hand on each side of the blonde--fingers splayed against the pale skin of Draco's hips. He leaned forward, just barely touching their lips together as he spoke.
"And I'm glad you're looking forward to the rest of the evening," he smiled after another sip of champagne. "I wish I could take full credit, but a lot of this was Hermione's idea." He was unwilling to pretend otherwise; it wasn't honest. "She told me I needed to take you on at least one date that communicated to you how much I think you're worth. So here we are," he gestured with his glass at the opulent expanse of the Hall. "I had the big picture idea--a nice dinner, music, dressing up. She found the venue."
"I like this… I really do," he panted minutes later when he came up for air, "but if I don't eat right now, I might pass out. I haven't had anything today except four biscuits, two cups of tea, and a chocolate frog."
food because we had a gentleman's agreement to share groceries along with rent. As for your wand, it was sitting out on the counter--I didn't think you would miss it for the five minutes it took me
Draco smirked at the Auror and winked, meeting Potter's sarcasm with coquettish teasing. "I think I could get used to waking up with you as the first thing I see," he noted wryly. He took a nice, deep breath and slung his legs over the couch.
Harry rapidly filed away information to sift through later--the shifting of Malfoy's gaze (up and to the right, recalling rather than fabricating), the way he plucked at the fabric of his pyjamas (anxious), the admission of his sexual interest in the (male) assailant and his level of intoxication, the name of the club (
Draco fell with Harry to the tub. He didn't bother with concern for personal space or care if the Auror happened to be too hot as he sprawled on top of him--his head on Harry's shoulder and his legs curled up where he sat between his lover's legs. The water was still going strong, washing away what was left of the mess. He chuckled warmly.
Harry chewed the edge of his thumbnail to a ragged mess as he pondered the unpleasant possibility, Adrian's file left forgotten before him.
Lucius stared at the Auror in total silence for a few long seconds. Just as it seemed Potter's impatience was rearing its ugly head again, that was when he chose to shift and speak.
"How am I not surprised my new wand likes you?" Draco chuckled with a sardonic smirk as Harry used it to conjure without any resistance.
"I better not see any details of this in the papers, mind," he warned, "or there won't be a second time."
"You know what they say," he replied, panting still and peppering the side of Draco's face with kisses. "The best way to overcome a fear is to face it head on. We'll have to do this again. More than once, probably, if you're as traumatized as you say."
I'm glad to see the slinky on your desk. Here is something to keep it company: a miniature Flutterby bush. It would do best with partial sun and watering twice a week, but I have been assured it is quite hardy.
Composing himself for the serious business of fucking his partner into the mattress, Harry pressed forward, gently but inexorably, until his cock was fully hilted. "That better?" he asked cheekily, giving Draco but a moment to adjust before he pulled back to thrust in again.
Some 30 minutes later, a sad, soggy owl landed on his desk with a wet plop and a baleful glare. He gave it an extra treat for the trouble of being sent out in the rain and scanned the parchment it bore to discover that Malfoy had agreed to the visit but sounded to be in a right snit over being awakened so early (which was patently ridiculous because Harry had sent the owl at 10:30 that morning).
Outside, the sun was low in the sky and the light filtering in through the open window was the warm orange of late afternoon. Harry was surrounded by the leftovers of his tea, crumpled up balls of parchment, and the notepad on which he'd been jotting notes and guesses. The time had been good for his mental clarity, as he assumed--or hoped--it was for Malfoy's. (The man had not been exaggerating when he said that calming draughts hit him hard.)
"Such a brat," Harry grumbled, rubbing out the smudge with a spit-wetted thumb. No wonder his friends had looked at him funny.
They couldn't quite get their tempo together with Draco moving to meet Potter's brutal thrusts, so he stiffened his arms and flexed his core and focused on holding steady under the glorious assault. Each trust forced out a small gasp; he couldn't catch a breath to tell his dress-clad partner it was perfect. Even with the table's edge biting into his naked thighs and his chest rubbing hard against its surface, stinging sweat dripping into his half-closed eyes, and a cramp forming in his right calf, the impossible heat and delicious friction in his arse and on his prick more than made up for it.
at following directions, do you know that?" Harry grumbled, raising a pointed brow at Draco. "Honestly." It was a bloody miracle Draco had survived Voldemort's brief reign. (Thing 3,172 not to think during sex.) "People think I'm bad."
, and your last missive isn't cutting it (though it does have a certain appeal). This whole ridiculous affair has cost me a great deal of pride. How are you going to make it up to me?
Without knocking, the blonde waved the doors open with his wand and walked inside the little office shared between Harry and Weasley.
Harry laughed and then gasped at Draco's retaliation for the stolen fish. He attached himself to Harry's neck as if he were a vampire, peppering him with kisses that were sure to leave marks.
The note was short and to the point and the piece of parchment was much longer than necessary, so the blonde merely decided to pen his reply just below on the same piece.
"Worship later," he countered, a pathetically needy whine to his voice. "Tonight. Tomorrow. I don't care. Just not right now." He interrupted himself with a pleasured grunt because he'd finally gotten his prick angled well enough to rut in the tight, hot space between Draco's inner thigh and his pelvis. If the devilish Slytherin tease would just stay still for 30 seconds, that would be enough for Harry, but he feared it was too much to hope for.
don’t require such barbaric practices, so if you have been subjected to such a gown, that is your own fault for ignoring the superior medicinal practices that magic affords. Secondly, you are in my
He pulled the files out of Ron's hand and tossed them onto his desk, demanding his partner's undivided attention. "Look," he said seriously, intent on setting the record straight, "Malfoy is interested in me. He told me so himself. Your sources were right about it being a longstanding crush, but the rest of that is bollocks. He's not like he was in school." (He
Harry snorted. "Just remember what happened to your clothes the last time you ruined mine," he warned, ruffling Draco's hair for the fun of it (and because he could). "I'll be home by half five unless something comes up at work, which I'll firecall to warn you about if I can."
"A: You're still a princess," he smirked. "It's much more about your attitude than your appearance. B: I will keep you safe. It's my job and I have a vested interest in your well being." He gave Draco a quick, sweet kiss, ignoring the slight embarrassment that accompanied the mushy display. "And C: Godrick, no. I am quite certain I don't want to know anything more about it. But if you're adventurous enough for freaky sex toys, I'm sure you'll be up for street food. Since you're starving, let's go now and we can come back here after."
The manager ignored Draco completely (the bastard!) and focused entirely on the commanding presence of the Hero. He nodded, bowed, and practically sobbed--far too dramatically for it to be sincere--his apologies. By the end of it, nearly a half-hour later, Draco was rolling his eyes and huffing angrily, as if he could breathe fire like his namesake.
I'll tell you who I am, but I'd like to continue the letters if that's all right with you. I have a tendency to put my foot in my mouth when I'm on the spot. This way lets me gather my thoughts better... especially when Hermione helps me compose my replies.
Harry scoffed. "No wonder your sleep schedule is so barmy if you think 11pm is nap time," he remarked fondly (due, in no small part, to the flood of endorphins in his system). "I, for one, will be going to
My Secret Santa has given me some rather excellent gifts--I hope that mine to you have been as well received. I've put a lot of thought into them, you know.
Draco gasped, lurching forward as his body reshaped itself--muscle, sinew, and skin stretching, tearing, and reforming; bones grinding into new alignment.
We're talking the entire Malfoy library, legal and illegal texts both. I know we didn't go there under the best of circumstances last time, but they have an insanely large collection and Draco's actually sort of nice these days.
I must also thank you for your efforts in finding the culprit, but they are unnecessary. Apparently, darling Pansy thought it would be a lark to dose me herself in order to coax me into voicing my longstanding infatuation with you, after years of hearing me lament the matter for its ultimate impossibility. (Rest assured, she will be itching for
Dean leaned forward, brown eyes flashing. "How long have you been...'dating'?" he asked, the word pregnant with suggestion.
Harry hummed, arms looped around Draco's waist and lips still stretched by his smile, as Draco did his best impression of a lamprey. (It was awfully nice coming home to dinner and an eager lover, especially after the day he'd had.)
Harry tried not to look too enthusiastic about Draco's offer but it was hard--those crisps were calling his name.
The girl is safe. She is home with her mother who wisely turned the lout out on his ear. They, too, will be seeing Mind Healers to deal with the trauma. I think they will be all right, though. They both send their thanks to you for your heroic assistance.
Before Draco could answer, he whisked them to the apparation point for The Royal Albert Hall. The itinerary for the evening was a private box viewing of Mozart's selected works, with dinner provided by the Coda. It had cost a pretty penny but Harry thought the investment worthwhile after Draco'd been such a good sport about all their cheap dates.
He babbled senseless encouragement through it ("Yesss...so good...Draco...Godrick") and slowed his thrusting when Draco was finished, unsure how he would feel about continuing after coming.
"You're not as loose as I almost expected," Draco mentioned off-handedly as he began to thrust and grind his hands on Potter's insides--scooping and jabbing as he looked for the man's prostate. "I am going to enjoy this."
"Shit, Draco, slow down!" Harry exclaimed, slightly panicked by the unexpected turn the one-sided conversation had taken. He was processing as quickly as his adrenalin-and-anger fueled brain could manage. So far he was sticking on the fact Draco had somehow gotten it into his head that Harry might want to break up with him and his strong desire to apparate back to the restaurant to kick Zabini square in the balls. (Apparently resorting to violence was a Gryffindor trait, after all.)
Wondering where Ron was, Harry acknowledged Malfoy's heckling with a wave of his hand and hovered by the basin of the pensieve.
, Draco huffed, only realizing after the fact Potter had called him by his first name. It wasn't even in the throes of passion this time!
Harry snickered. "You're not supposed to let go," he teased with a pinch to Draco's cheek before diving back in for more.
--to make a dinner reservation without first checking with him. It so happened that he was free and interested in seeing the man again, but still.
Once in the living room, he conjured the biggest, brightest fireball he could manage, pouring all of his anger into its creation to empty it from himself. The heat from it felt like it might singe his eyebrows; it dried his eyeballs to the point they felt tacky and burned the inside of his nostrils as he practiced the controlled breathing his Mindhealer had taught him.
As he was somewhat of a Spartan bather, Harry had expected to be waiting on Malfoy but was pleasantly surprised to find the other man already seated. Malfoy greeted him with an almost imperceptible smile and a nod, silver eyes flicking quickly over Harry’s body in appraisal. He gave no indication if what he saw it was to his liking but he gestured for Harry to sit next to him all the same. Harry’s stomach clenched with more than simple hunger. He hadn’t felt this nervous since… Well, probably something else having to do with Malfoy and his proximity. But he was no coward. Gryffindor and all that. Swallowing the lump in his throat, he put on his brave face and went to the place setting arranged for him.
Though you are correct that I could, I won't be making any bribes to keep you there. I have been all but grounded in the office without you. Apparently the higher ups don't trust ex-Death Eaters in the community without an armed escort.
"It was," Draco breathed as if he were trying to find some silver lining in his cloud of snark, but then smiled, "surprisingly edible."
He went to walk out the door, slowing his steps only a little and counting down from 10 in his head.
Feeling emboldened, Harry nipped the carrot from his fingers, but he turned quickly back to the chicken as his cheeks began to heat from embarrassment. He used the excuse of food prep to cover his self-consciousness, dumping the chicken and a splash of olive oil into the sizzling skillet. He began setting the table while the meat was browning.
He took the snowflakes out to inspect them up close. Their fractal patterns were visible through whatever Draco had crystallized them in. The smooth disc fit in the middle of his palm and he rubbed his thumb over its surface wonderingly.
Potter's living room was empty, but the fact that he was present was absolutely unmistakable with Draco's heightened senses.
Harry put his musings aside when Draco resurfaced. He guided him to sit upright and then set to work on the tension in his shoulders and back, aided by the slippery water and the oils it contained.
, because apparently Hermione was right about Harry being a masochist--and Harry used both hands to steady him, reflexes faster than his thought processes.
"Can't we change the subject? Maybe to what our relationship should be?" he said with a seductive, if slightly slurred, chuckle. He sat up carefully and leaned his hands into the cushions of he couch.
Once a good gulp or two of the potion was slithering down to his gullet, Draco set the bottle aside and sighed--smacking his lips and tongue at the weird taste. After a second, his nerves seemed to calm (though not as completely as they would have with the full dose) and he nodded.
He couldn't help but wonder why he'd been invited back into the man's rooms, especially after his unwelcome intrusion earlier in the day, but he wasn't about to look a gift Gryffindor in the mouth. If he was doomed to continue this infernal entrapment, at least he could benefit from Potter's odd penchant for weasels and their ilk.
"You can stay," Harry repeated. "If you want." He tugged nervously on the edge of his robes. "Don't open the door or unlock the Floo for anyone, and remember that if you leave, it'll be a one way trip. Otherwise, help yourself to anything you find in the kitchen and feel free snoop all you like," he offered cheekily. "I don't think I've left any more deep, dark secrets laying about," he added with a wink, feeling less unsure of the decision in the face of Draco's sweet, awed expression.
'Boring' was the last word Harry would use to describe Draco, in bed or otherwise. And if this was new for him, he was certainly game. (But then, Harry had always appreciated Draco's competitive spirit.)
"I have to change," he sighed dejectedly. "Should only take a minute." (There was no way that was true.)
"Oi! What's all this fuss about?" Ron strolled into the room, a brown paper bag in one hand and a flaky, half-eaten croissant in the other dropping crumbs on both his magenta robes and the floor. He wore a look of cautious curiosity--he was understandably weary to pick a side whenever his best friend and wife were going at it.
"I'll tell you one thing," Draco declared, panting slightly in his effort to keep up with Harry, "the management is getting an earful. There is only one way Devil's Snare could have gotten past their security measures and that's through the staff."
"They're married," he answered simply, picking the least loaded question out of the bunch. "And they have a baby. My goddaughter, Rose." He smiled briefly at the thought of the wee, chubby thing. "Hermione works as a legal assistant to the Wizengamot and Ron's my partner, but I think you knew that."
A knock sounded at the door and Harry felt the flutter of excitement that always accompanied Draco's arrival these days.
“You haven’t even tried,” he countered, the words delivered gently to mitigate the sting. Malfoy‘s frustration was understandable, even without Harry’s first hand experience with disability. Malfoy had dropped the wand three times and been unsuccessful in casting even a basic
Also enclosed is another letter from Parkinson with a naked picture of you in it. I thought you'd want it back.
on top of it," he said cheekily. "But I'm versatile. We can do this however you fancy if you'll just let me run a couple of diagnostic spells first to make sure you are in your right mind." Merlin forbid they do the deed, only afterward does Draco come to his senses.
"I don't know who let you in here," he said tightly when the enormous wanker seemed quite finished (it was terribly against protocol to let a civilian stroll unaccompanied through Level Two, especially a dangerous parolee like the Death Eater), "and I intend to have words with whoever's responsible, but I have nothing more to say to you. I thought my owl made that abundantly clear."
"Oh, no need to worry... I wasn't planning to," Draco said as he flashed Potter a predatory smirk and lazily spread the lube between his fingers and moved it down to slick the clear gel over his cock (thoroughly) before finally pressing the first two fingers against Potter's hole. He rubbed around the ring once before pressing both tips at once into the ring of muscle--not bothering to pause once he breached it until he was buried to the third knuckle.
After, they enjoyed dessert, or everyone but Weasley did. Though he said he was full that was just another excuse Draco was certain was a lie. Considering their history, Weasley probably suspected poison.
Harry counted to ten. He clenched and unclenched his hands and practiced breathing through his nose and reminded himself that Ron was his first and best friend. And then he did it all again, until his magic had settled to the point that nothing in the office might spontaneously burst into flames. Particularly his arsehole partner.
"Happy to oblige," Draco half-groaned as he twisted his hips and rolled them over and off slightly so that Potter's back was on the (thankfully long) desk while Draco's feet were planted on the ground. He slid his hands from Potter's hips to under his thighs where he held on firmly to support the other man. He rolled his hips forward again--their clothed cocks brushing once more.
He pushed his free hand under Draco's jumper to find one of his nipples. When he did, he gave it a hard pinch.
Harry couldn't help but chuckle. "I had some practice what with all those letters I tried sending you this past week," he replied.
"I don't compliment other blokes on their outfits or invite them to fancy French restaurants, you know."
"I am not stalling," he replied tersely, folding his arms over his chest. "I am reminding you why you don't deserve a say in Draco's life." His stare was pure ice, but Lucius met it unflinchingly and Harry was ever so slightly moved. "For his sake, not for yours, I will tell you this much," he relented (thinking Draco would rather they come to some sort of an understanding, if he could pick the outcome), "I wouldn't be with him if I didn't think there was long-term potential in it."
As he disengaged the cables on the IFC machine following Adrian's session (performing the complicated task by muscle memory alone since his mind was otherwise engaged), he imagined Malfoy holed up in the Manor with no one but house-elves for company, gradually losing the strength and control he'd worked so hard to gain. Harry knew firsthand what that experience was like and he wouldn't wish it on anyone. Not even the blighter who'd ratted him out to the Press.
"They have a limited dessert selection here," he informed his date. He'd studied the menu carefully beforehand. "Of the options, I think you'd like either the chocolate torte with blood-orange sorbet or the mango and passion fruit cheesecake best. Both sound good to me. I'll skip the black olive ice cream," he added with a grimace.
, Harry groused internally, annoyed both at himself for setting Draco off and Draco for being so sensitive. He worked hard to keep that annoyance off his face, however; Draco was watching him closely.
?" Pansy laughed. A cold, mirthless-sounding thing. Whether it was spiteful or she was just being silly (as she was at times) was hard to tell, but it stung all the same. Draco's eyelid twitched.
He held Draco at arm's length and inspected the damage. It was hard to believe all that had come from a bout with writer's block. "'Mione and Ron are going to be here in an hour," he informed him. "Why don't you go get cleaned up and I'll start in on dinner."
Although the number and variety of levers and switches therein was daunting, Harry was eventually able to get the water on and set to the highest pressure and temperature and billowing steam soon filled the room. He fiddled with another knob and the refreshing scent of jasmine began to mask his own unpleasant odour. He stepped inside, sucking in a hissing breath as the needle-like droplets stung his skin, but he relished in the feeling. Unlike the others, this was a pain that he chose. It was one of the only things that reliably allowed him to clear his mind. With all his chaotic thoughts stilled for the moment, he methodically scrubbed the layers of sweat and grime from his person. He’d remember soon enough that he was washing up for dinner with Malfoy.
wasn't a whore, but there was no way Harry could explain how he knew that without telling secrets that weren't his to tell.) "He's all right."
case, he'd jumped to an awful conclusion based entirely on the way Malfoy had treated him a decade ago, with no thought given to how Malfoy had been since then.
Enclosed is a letter sent to me by your friend Parkinson. To summarize: apparently you pine for me often and she thinks that because the papers speculate I am bi-curious, we should shag.
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin when he heard the knock. The wards surrounding his house hadn't shimmered so he knew the person at the door was someone he had deemed safe--Harry, most likely. He cleared his throat, ran a hand over his hair, and with all the Malfoy confidence he could muster (without all the Malfoy
"You tell me, since you seemed to have kept up with my lack of appearance--or so you indicated at the wedding. I was almost touched! So, exactly how long have I been out of the constant lime light?"
?" Ron met Harry's sarcasm with sarcasm. "You mean before or after that Wendy girl with the crazy eyes who stalked you at work after sleeping with her (despite my warnings)? You're kind of blind where sex is concerned, mate."
Draco produced a bottle of something and made a cryptic allusion to it. No matter how Harry may have felt about blueberries in the past, he had the strong impression they were about to become his favourite fruit.
"Did you ever stop to think that maybe it wasn't you they were looking for? Or are you too self-centred for the thought even to have occurred to you?"
Lucius sighed and stood up from the chair, without panic or rush. He settled both hand on the head of his cane after adjusting his clothes and hair. With a nod, he turned to leave for the door--his shoes' hard heels clacking against the old wood.
"I can only imagine," he opined. There was something almost like fondness beneath the words. Harry warmed at the sound of it.
Draco quirked a brow and bit his lip as Harry left. The grin on his face felt huge and possibly permanent. There was a great surge of happiness swelling within the blonde and he didn't even try to suppress or control it. Instead, he nibbled at his toast and shook his head.
"Wasn't me," Ron maintained, holding his hands up in a show of innocence (and popping the last piece of croissant into his mouth while it was close).
Harry was floored. It must be worse than he realized for Malfoy to stop even carrying his wand. After having had it taken against his will (ahem...thanks to Harry) and been so overjoyed at its return (also thanks to Harry), he couldn’t imagine that Malfoy would ever willingly part with it again.
I hope you don't think I'm overdoing it with the treats here. I know you've got a sweet tooth and it's hard to shop for someone who not only has everything already, but has rather exacting tastes to boot.
Nevertheless, the gift is not for me so I hope you will continue to like it and (if needed) the anti-emetic potion in the accompanying package.
"Right. So that means I can rule out hexes and curses." He leaned forward, spearing Draco with his glittering emerald gaze. "I'm thinking potions accident."
The ropes might have been too tight. Harry may also have felt some unease about being bound while Draco possessed his wand. He didn't know one way or another because everything in his head became white noise when Draco slid against his prick.
Draco was still as a statue except for the wild pulse fluttering in the hollow of his throat. Harry wanted to taste it but he waited, a niggle of doubt suggesting he'd made another catastrophic error in judgement at the hunted look in those slate grey eyes.
On the one hand, it was just sex. It wasn't a big deal. He'd done it before and he and Draco had done everything but. It was simply a matter of slotting their bodies together in a slightly different configuration.
, and Draco knew it, the sly devil. Merlin forbid someone like Kingsley walk in on him in a compromising position. He would never live it down!
Harry was vaguely offended at Malfoy calling him weak and scrawny earlier. He was small, sure, but he wasn't weak. Malfoy had been able to disarm his attacker so easily because the person moved with the characteristic lack of coordination of someone with a drastically different body type than the polyjuiced individual. If Harry had to guess, he'd say the assailant was a tall, broad, and burly male. He also knew Malfoy very well, or had paid off someone who did, given that he knew where Malfoy's unexpected interests laid.
We are flatmates. And you know the Ministry likes this arrangement because they secretly (not-so-secretly) want me keeping tabs on you while you're still on probation. And as far as I've ever been aware, you can hardly stand me most days. And sex is a big deal!
That was as much of a personal admission as Malfoy would get from him. Tit for tat. Hopefully it would be enough for him to retract his claws.
," he broke away to reply, "as long as you understand that I will be judging your efforts most critically. A sub-par performance almost guarantees there will not be another."
Draco's body bent like a bow as his orgasm tore through him. Harry's movements lost their rhythm in the face of it. He kept going as best he could but he was rather distracted by the sight. Not to mention the feeling of Draco's interior muscles gripping him tighter still...then pulsing in time with the hot stripes of come that soon painted his chest and abdomen.
"Nevermind. I assumed you'd understand what a big deal it is for Mother to approve of you, even though there is certainly no way you could know, so I should not have expected any response beyond dismissal. As for anything else, I shouldn't have been so sensitive. What did you buy for dinner? I didn't get much time to see what it was before you stuffed it down like a rabid wolf."
Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco, silently asking if he had an opinion on how the loaded question should be answered. Draco merely inclined his head, giving him the floor.
Goyle's trial, at least, had been straightforward and quick. With his detailed confession and lack of defense, there was no contesting his sentence of six months in Azkaban followed by a lengthy probation and court-ordered Mind Healing.
Now to change the subject (and I won't be discussing the last one any longer), I am curious to know which classes you seem to be struggling in. If one is Potions you certainly cannot blame that on me! We have earned full marks on every assignment thus far.
Potter followed behind, assessing the scene with a practiced eye. After a minute, he stooped to pick up Draco's robes and wand, the latter of which he stowed in his back pocket. Despite the way his own clothing had been strewn about his living quarters, he carefully folded Draco's and found a clean place to put them.
It was after midnight when Harry finally dragged himself out of his Floo. He'd be sleeping in the guest room that night--he was too exhausted to climb the stairs to his own room.
The rules are simple: each department will receive a visit from a hat with the names of all unmatched Ministry workers inside. Whatever name you pick is the employee you must give (legal, non-threatening, prankless, well-intentioned) gifts to--one a day until our Christmas party, when you may reveal yourself and exchange the final gift! Until then each gift must be sent anonymously by inter-office owls. Whether you choose to give the last one in person or not is up to you, but no sneak peeks before then!
Janine cocked an eyebrow. "Why." It was delivered as a statement so Harry didn't bother answering. He could tell Janine was busy coming up with her own explanation anyway. "It must have been an accident," she decided, attitude toward him softening upon determining his presumed innocence.
Draco's eyes widened in surprise and sudden pain as he was tackled nearly backward on his chair. He instinctively wrapped one arm around the man's neck and returned his enthusiastic, bruising kisses with his own--sucking on the Auror's tongue wetly.  His free hand clasped his lover's firm ass through his jeans and squeezed tight. Harry's ass was planted on Draco's hardening cock, which prompted the blonde to buck up roughly.
Draco nodded in response, though the growing feeling of trepidation wouldn't leave him. Everything seemed like it could be the beginning of the end, and suddenly he regretted not asking to have dinner at some muggle place that would be more toward Harry's tastes. He shook his head as they turned a corner and stood before the doors of the Garden Room.
"Would it have been so bad just to do it? It's just sex. I'm sure it wouldn't have been so bad, and that would have at least fixed Blaise. Pansy I imagine I would have had to marry or at least bribe for the rest of my life, so perhaps not her... But she always told me she wanted me to be her first and I always told her I couldn't. I even made out with her during the Yule Ball and it just did nothing for me, except make me uncomfortable. But if I had just used Occlumency then and made myself want it, perhaps she'd be... And if I were nicer to Greg and Vince..."
He ran a hand through his hair to collect himself and left the other on Draco's foot (lest he start grinding on Harry's overly sensitive prick).
Potter continued to hesitate so Draco rolled onto his back and presented his belly (electing to think of the degrading act as a perfectly Slytherin tactic to achieve his goals).
Draco ran his hands through his hair to straighten his locks from his face as he reemerged and leaned back against the tub. He couldn't remember the last time he felt so relaxed (his last massage was when he had still been going to Hogwarts) and somehow he knew quite well how rare an occurrence such a thing would be from Harry. He smirked and turned his head to kiss Harry's hand as it roamed the pressure points of his shoulder.
"Not that we need it, but oysters are supposed to be an aphrodisiac. I also have grilled salmon and lobster cannelloni. For sides there is salad with a delicious orange sauce I made myself, grilled squash with lemon pepper, and a treacle tart the size of your head for afters."
Draco sensed something was off about Harry's apology (perhaps it was the twitch in Harry's brow that usually indicated annoyance), but he chose not to mention it. Even if he didn't feel it was fair to have to ask for a little respect after being treated not-so-well by someone who was supposed to be "fond" of him. But Harry didn't love him. Maybe there really was a difference between "love" and "fond" besides an intensity of feelings? Or maybe Draco was just being unrealistic? Or unreasonable? Or too sensitive? Was it his fault? Was it even
"I'm okay," Draco said, though his voice was nearly a whole octave higher. "Or rather, I will be... Okay, that is. I
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Harry's attempts at owl-correspondence with Malfoy were returned unopened. And he failed to show for a single appointment that week.
Malfoy looked like he was seriously considering slamming the door in Harry's face. Harry, for his part, was certain he could force his way inside if he had to, as long as he could do it before Malfoy got the wards back up. A whole team of Aurors hadn’t been able to crack them when they’d gone to arrest the Manor’s occupants in the aftermath of the War; fortunately for them, Narcissa and her son persuaded Lucius to surrender for the sake of their impending trials. In the end, it didn’t curry him any favour, but it helped the cause of the other two plenty.
Harry quirked a surprised brow as Draco fell to his knees and immediately lifted the hem of the dress. It took a second, but when it registered exactly what his partner planned, he grinned and leaned forward to grip the fireplace behind Draco, spreading his legs for better access.
Draco replied, chest puffed up with smug self-congratulation. He curled himself around Potter's fingers, nipping at them playfully.
He steadied them both on his hearth on the other side. "New rule," he said tightly, striding into the middle of the sitting room to put distance between him and Malfoy (who he was now picturing in his pants, staring solemnly at nothing in particular, the way Neville had done), "no more talking until after you've slept. There's the couch," he indicated with a firm point, "make yourself comfortable. I'm going to go start some tea."
"Oh I was bluffing," Harry said with a shameless grin, earning a single dry chuckle for his honesty.
"Forgive me then?" Harry asked with a hopeful, lopsided grin that he knew many people found charming (he wasn't above using all the weapons in his arsenal; not for this) and ignoring the sound of someone climaxing a few feet away from them.
"Your optimism is refreshing," Draco said, tone dry, after being released. With the short nod to each, he bid 'Mr. Longbottom' and 'Ms. Lovegood' goodnight.
Harry knew Malfoy didn’t like to look at it if it could be helped and was self-conscious about others seeing it. For his part, Harry could care less about how the thing looked, he simply wanted to help Malfoy—like any of his patients—regain as much capability and confidence as possible. He had a sudden, crazy urge to seek out and grasp the offending extremity. But seeing as he didn’t have a death-wish (several stern lectures from Hermione on the subject notwithstanding) and the fact there had been rather a lot of hand holding already, he thought better of it.
"You do look rather... Delightful in your uniform. Perhaps when we've done this a few times and my body gets used to it we can try for a quickie sometime?" The blonde winked at his partner. "So, bacon?"
Draco had left for one simple reason: he felt like he was rushing Harry by being around all the time. That, and by now his already far too independent barn owl might have decided to just live in the woods and then where would he be? A shut-in with no owl was asking for trouble. He arrived late that evening after Apparating from Harry's and immediately walked into his empty apartment, locking the door thoroughly behind him. The whole place felt very foreign now, even though he had only been gone about a week.
Harry seethed. "Yeah, well, he's got it," he answered tightly. He hadn't been expecting company, either, had he? That was rather the reason for his visit. "Tell your
... He only knew that because Gladys was a dirty old lady and often left her copy of the glossy magazine open on her desk, which he unfortunately visited several times a week to request files from the records room and had to put up with her creepy flirtation and borderline sexual harassment (she only released the files to him if he went for them in person so she could leer at him with her gap-toothed smile).
With Draco's cock now easily accessible, Harry circled his tongue around the pucker once more as his hands shifted from Draco's hips--at this angle he didn't mind if the man bucked on him while he played. One hand went to firmly grip Draco's cock and squeeze while the other he used to quickly conjure lube before joining the first. He drove his tongue inside Draco, thrusting it to its limit and wanking firmly as he did.
"If there are more plants, we will deal with them. For now, let's focus on getting out of here." He gave Draco's shoulders a squeeze and dropped his hands to his sides (never releasing his wand, of course).
Arthur frowned gravely and Harry wished the ground would open up and swallow him whole. He'd take detention with Umbrage over this.
Harry groaned, shifting anxiously in the chair. He was torn between spreading his legs for Draco and crossing them primly.
“What? Oh right! Yeah. Sorry! My brain isn’t working at full capacity,” he shook his head as if rattling it around in there. “I think I just need to get a bite in me.”
It was apparent how much of the world Malfoy missed as a shut in, though. He kept up with the major goings on through the papers, but he was perceptibly out-of-touch to Harry (now that he'd keyed in to that fact). He hoped that Malfoy would feel safe enough to begin venturing out again once his attacker was behind bars. All the more reason to solve the case quickly.
"You good?" he asked solicitously, holding Draco's hip with one hand and rubbing his flank with the other.
Blaise is suffering his sentence in Italy with distant family and Pansy is angry with me over calling her new shoes ugly. (Coral, though, really? Her feet are not an ocean ecosystem.) My father is in jail, my mother in another country, and that means all I have left is the house-elves, so forgive me if I want to grasp this opportunity with both hands.
The summer had finally come to an end. A perfect meeting had dragged his friends away, so currently Harry Potter was sitting alone in a compartment. Completely lost in thought he was thinking about this summer. It was one of the worst summers yet. When arriving at the Dursleys, Vernon had immediately put all his things away in his cupboard. He was also constantly plagued by nightmares. Waking up screaming at night after seeing Cedric get killed or Voldemort rising out of the cauldron. But those were not the worst. This worst were the ones about his parents and/or Cedric blaming him for their deaths. So as you can see it was not such a good summer. He was lucky enough to stay at the Weasleys for the final 2 weeks, which allowed him to finish his homework. Mrs. Weasley had already bought all he needed, saying going to Diagon Alley was not safe.
“Youngest first,” ordered Ryan with a smile, already making his way to the mountain of presents. Taking out all presents with his name on he started ripping into them. Harry was very happy that Ryan loved the gift he had gotten him. He had ordered him a live-action Quidditch book. It worked like the muggle computer games, only this time you were in the game. This one specifically allowed Ryan to practice playing Quidditch without needing a broom.
Not waiting for an answer he started waving his wand around in what looked like a complicated pattern. While professor Snape was doing this Harry could feel something slightly pulling on his magic.
“It does not matter what her position in your life was. It was not like she was in any danger, so you should make a scene. And if you went to talk to her you should have taken Miss Patil with you, so she felt included.”
If anything that was mentioned in this chapter (what happened to Harry at the Dursleys) seems familiar to you, or any of this, even if just a little bit, is happening to you, do not fear to seek out help. Every country has special chat boxes or phone numbers for these issues, or you can just tell someone you trust, whatever you feel comfortable with. What I am describing is not normal behavior from adult to child and should never happen. And seeking help does not mean you will be taken away from your home, but they will be able to make the behavior stop.
“While you are not able to permanently live in these places till you reach your majority, you can visit them or take a holiday there with parental permission,” Severus continued.
This let Harry to wonder about the adoption proposal he had received from Severus and Serena. He loved staying at the Snape’s and he got along quite well with both Ryan and Ethan. The difficult relationship between Severus and Harry had also almost completely disappeared. Severus had been a huge help on several different aspects. Harry had been receiving extra lessons to help him with potions. Who knew that he was doing the cutting, slicing, dicing, and so on wrong? Apparently, muggle raised students should have received an introductory book on wizarding basics, which should have explained this. It would have also mentioned some basic potions and the main interactions between herbs and potion ingredients. It was only after one hour of trying to teach Harry that Severus found out that Harry never received anything. This resulted in a mix of emotions, Severus was mad at Dumbledore for not providing this material to Harry, but also at himself for never realizing. Once Severus sat down with him to explain everything he should have known, his potion skills improved drastically. One thing was for sure; he would be able to get at least a decent score on his OWLs.
There will be another section on properties, in Britain and abroad. For each property, it will also state what the current state of the property is. This includes how many house-elves, the state of the wards, magical creatures that can be found, the size and state of the property, and so on.
“Harry, we want you, and you will never be a burden. Ethan and Ryan love hanging out with you when they can and Selena and I have come to love you.”
“Why do people keep asking that?” said Ethan almost to himself. “He is like any other dad. I mean, he plays games with us, takes us flying, helps if we have any problems.”
Severus had told him that child abuse was almost non-existent in the wizarding world. Since having many children was often hard due to magic restraints children were very precious. As the parents share magic with the child during pregnancy, the more children the fewer magic available for the next children. That’s why the oldest is preferably male, as they normally have the strongest magic and are the heir.
“He had this game called “Harry Hunting”. He and his friends would chase me around the neighborhood and beat me up when they caught me”
“Maybe you don’t know, but me and Draco Malfoy hate each other. He can’t go one minute without insulting me,” said Harry. “I thought that maybe you didn’t get along because I never saw him at the dinners we had with your parents”
“As you know Ron, I decided to stick to Ancient Runes and Arithmancy. I wish I could also take it but it falls at the same time as another class and time turners are no longer allowed.”
The morning of the 24th of December found a very nervous Harry at the breakfast table. After reading the paper the day before, he was surprised that he had yet to receive any mail from the Order. He had suspected the Weasleys and Dumbledore to at least send him an owl asking where he was. On the other hand, maybe they suspected that Harry was staying with Neville for the holidays. One thing Harry was sure of, is that he would probably be called to Dumbledore’s office when he arrived back at Hogwarts.
"All private business of my professors concerns me" Albus said, getting angrier that no one was telling him what he wanted to know.
By now Harry had blocked out the sorting ceremony, until suddenly professor McGonagall called: “Snape, Ryan”
Seeing the defeated look on Ethan’s face, he continued, “But your mother and I will be sending you off for a visit on Christmas day. We will of course need to find an excuse to tell Harry, but that is how it needs to be for now. We can’t risk Dumbledore finding out.”
It was almost 15 minutes later when Harry finally entered the room again. The goblin escorting Harry inside quickly handed over some documents to Ripclaw before leaving. Seating himself between Mdm. Longbottom and Neville Harry did feel a lot lighter than before. It was almost like a pressure had been relieved of his shoulders and his magic also felt more alive than before.
“If I’m honest, I don’t remember that night much. And it’s just talking, I swear,” Draco insisted. “We can do it in public if you like. Hell, we could Apparate to the middle of Auror headquarters right now so if I try to hex you they’ll arrest me. I don’t really care where it happens, just that it does.”
He’d not really been interested in becoming an Auror after their eighth year at Hogwarts, but that didn’t mean he would let something like this slide. He was determined to discover what happened in what he thought would be one of the safest places someone could be, full of long lost memories and decades worth of protective magic. Though, logically, he conceded, some of those spells most likely disappeared when their owners died, much like Dumbledore’s had released him when he’d fallen from the Astronomy Tower. Still, curiosity got the best of him and he was determined to know.
Before he made contact, Potter shot up. “I have to go,” he said simply, without emotion. He stood up and found his pants, tugging them on without grace.
“So-” Draco started at the same time, facing Harry when he heard him speak as well. Harry gave him a smile to signal he could speak first. “I wanted to let you know that my mother has been my best friend for my whole life and I have never kept a secret from her, and I do not want to start. With your permission, I’d like to tell her about us.” He sounded incredibly formal, as if he were speaking to a colleague about some files that needed transferred.
“I’m great,” Draco responded. Silence followed. Stupid, awkwardly silent silence. Draco was generally pretty good at avoiding this kind of thing, but Potter was different from all the others. Draco couldn’t pinpoint what it was, and resigned himself to watching the man next to him in search for answers.
“Care for another?” Draco offered, standing for just long enough to switch to the empty barstool next to him, leaving an empty seat right where Potter was standing.
Draco’s hair was unkempt, sticking up at odd angles that didn’t suit his face very well. Harry briefly remembered tangling his fingers in that hair and tugging on it while they snogged heavily the night before. The blonde’s shirt was untucked, wrinkled beyond belief, and his eyes were tired, but alight with something Harry couldn’t quite place. Maybe it had just been a trick of the light. He only had one sock on, which seemed pretty odd considering he definitely had two last night. Harry couldn’t think of where the other might have gone, but the thought of Draco leaving something behind made him slightly giddy. If he found it, he had a reason to visit. An excuse to show up at Draco’s house or work and possibly get another snogging session in before he had to leave. Harry told himself he’d look for it later.
Harry reached out, gripping Draco’s elbow and pulling him closer. Backing himself up against the fence, he continued to reduce the space between them until he could feel Draco’s breath ghosting across his face. He looked up into the blonde’s eyes and then down to his mouth before finally, gently pressing his lips to the other man’s. After a moment, first their lips parted and then their bodies did.
Draco stared at him incredulously, seeming to search for something in Harry’s earnest expression, and finally stood up from his chair. Harry offered him his arm, hoping that he’d take it. Draco’s fingers felt soft and rigid at the same time as they wrapped around his elbow. Harry gripped his wand and apparated them.
“I think we’ve earned it,” Draco justified as they walked down the path back towards that gate. Harry had trouble pulling it closed; not because the gate wouldn’t close, but because part of him was certain that he couldn’t open it back up again. After a little convincing from Draco, they apparated to the Leaky Cauldron.
Draco watched him, waiting until Harry was a mere inches away from him to respond. When he finally spoke, his voice was soft and slightly vulnerable, though he’d never admit it. “Thank you.”
Most of the ones he’d had were fine with one fuck, never trying to score a second round, never sticking around long enough for a pot of water to boil. And never asking questions.
Harry groaned and threw an arm over his eyes, letting himself fall back into the couch cushions. “Did Ron tell you?”
There were three people left in the lobby when he returned, one of which Draco knew and didn’t expect to see. Potter was chatting amicably with a goblin, who did not seem to want to continue the conversation. Draco, still not fully recovered from the night he’d spent with Thomas several weeks ago, had every intention of walking by without making eye contact, without speaking. But then the bloke had to go and address Draco himself.
He pressed his back to the gate and slid down into a sit at its base, setting the basket of tea next to him. He took a moment to just feel the air around the grounds. He sensed a sadness, but could not decipher whether it was the house or himself.
“I’ve never—I mean, who does it—uh…where?” Harry asks stupidly, utterly flabbergasted by Malfoy’s piercing gaze. Something unnerved him about the blonde, but he couldn’t tell if it was something as a result of their going-on-twelve-years animosity or something completely different.
Harry nodded and stood, delicately placing his chair back in the corner where he dragged it from. “Thanks.”
“I thought it would read my signature, so I just kind of tapped my wand against it. Then I tried a number of spells and even jumping the gate, but it just threw me back on the wrong side.”
Potter’s behaviour was very interesting, as Draco could generally pinpoint which type of socialiser one was just by observing them at a bar. Potter, however, didn’t fit into any category. He kept to himself a majority of the time, spinning his tumbler on the counter as if by nervous habit. He looked around a lot, as if wishing someone would talk to him or wishing he could join conversations, but he never made a move. Draco couldn’t help but wonder why Potter was here, if not meeting friends. Unlike Draco, who considered himself a solo artist at the bar, Potter changed over the course of the night. A couple next to him pulled him into a conversation and his entire face lit up, like he’d been waiting all night for someone to speak to him.
Somehow Draco was doing this. He booked a harp player, set up tables and stations, and even went to one of those Muggle party stores to pick up sickly sweet decorations. Through all of this, we still wondered why Weasley was having them celebrate Valentine’s of all holidays. Only a few of the aurors had partners or were even dating. The job is too time consuming to have any sort of romantic personal life.
“We have to reset it,” she informed him. He had tried to reply, had tried to ask what that would entail and how much it would hurt, but she jerked his arm up and back into the socket before he could. “Fuck!” He shouted, glaring at the healer for putting him through this. Though he knew he really had done this to himself. She placed an ice pack on his shoulder and told him to stay put for ten minutes.
“How can I help you, Mister Potter?” Malfoy began. Harry held himself back from snorting. Never in his life did he imagine Draco Malfoy calling him
“Master is gracious,” Bippy said at last in a shaking voice. She composed herself and proclaimed, “Bippy will make biscuits!” and popped out of the foyer once more.
At the end of the night, Harry shook hands with Arthur and kissed Molly on the cheek before apparating back home with yet another promise to himself that he’d talk to Draco soon, and hopefully about the nature of their relationship.
When he’d heard Hermione enter, he adjusted his posture, pulling his leg off the back of the couch and sitting up. “Hey,” he greeted her as she bustled around, setting down her bag and taking off her traveling cloak. “Did you just get off shift?”
Harry wasn’t sure who exactly was the man Neville was sitting next to, engaging in conversation with, but he figured he might as well wave his fellow Gryffindor over. Neville’s head perked up and he waved back at Harry, but raised his eyebrows and stared pointedly at Draco when Harry beckoned him to join them. Harry just rolled his eyes and jerked his head to indicate that Neville better get over here soon or else.
Draco really didn’t want to continue this conversation, not with the direction it was heading. He pursed his lips, trying to think of something to say, anything. He wondered if this was worth it, worth the pain of thinking about his past, his mistakes. Every other Gryffindor he’d been with had pointedly ignored having this conversation, avoiding addressing Draco’s role in their suffering.
That Friday, Harry had been putting the finishing touches on the bathroom on the fourth floor, setting up a couple shelves to hold towels and such, when he heard a familiar woosh from several floors below.
The wait wasn’t long, but he was growing more and more impatient by the minute. He tapped the tube of paper he was carrying against the wall in a rhythmic pattern out of boredom. After ten minutes, he’d resigned himself to just go to his meeting with Neville and he’d write Draco a letter explaining why he left. And, he thought, next time I’ll make an appointment. He checked his watch once again and sighed, pushing himself off the wall and beginning the walk back to the lobby. Halfway down, he heard the door open and both Draco and his client emerged. The woman hustled down the hallway, throwing Harry a sultry grin as she passed him. Harry eyed her warily and cleared his throat, gaze finally locking with Draco’s at the end of the hall.
Twenty minutes later their plates were cleared and Harry had just finished scrubbing the last fork, setting it delicately on a towel next to the sink to dry. Wiping his hands off on a separate towel, he turned back to the table to find Draco watching him with a small smile, head resting on the palm of one of his hands. Harry hung the towel up without breaking eye contact and then asked, “What?”
Harry gave his jogger-clad arse a purposeful wiggle in Draco’s lap and the blonde responded by growling into the kiss, taking Harry’s bottom lip between his teeth lightly. He pulled away for no more than a second to say, “Don’t-- fuck, I’m going to be late…” They reestablished their kiss and Harry did it again, smirking with Draco’s breath hitched. Draco’s fingers, tangled in Harry’s hair, tightened their hold and Harry pressed further against him, not willing to let go just yet. In a perfect world Draco could skive off work and they could spend the day on the couch, snogging until their jaws went slack or rutting against each other until oversensitivity forced them to stop.
As they packed up to leave, Harry took another long glance at the house in the distance and whispered, “I’ll be back tomorrow.”
Draco distractedly followed suit, taking a delicate sip. He’d never noticed the way Potter’s eyes shined so bright when he smiled. It was almost intoxicating. Potter was attractive, Draco had already admitted that to himself earlier in the night, but the thought kept repeating in his mind. He’d had a mild, fleeting crush on the bloke in school, but once the war began he could no longer allow himself to think about it. Liking the one person Voldemort was after was too risky, too dangerous. Over time, those feelings had faded out and Draco had only thought about Potter when he was in the news, or in this case, on the list.
Harry could feel his grin go sappy and part of him wanted to kick himself for it, but he couldn’t really help that Draco basically turned him into a huge caldron of Elixir to Induce Euphoria every time he so much as smiled at him. It was all Draco’s fault really. Harry wasn’t sure why, but he had never been this affected by anyone he’d dated before. He’d been attracted to them, sure, but never had he felt so undone by a single facial expression until Draco came into the picture.
His eyes traveled around the neat office, lingering on a few framed photographs hung on the wall behind the desk. Harry could only make out one of the photos. Malfoy stood between his parents, all three of them looking quite put out as the wind seemed to whip through their pale hair, before the photograph reset.
He apparated just outside the front door, tucking the large, wrapped present under one arm before knocking. The door creaked open seemingly on its own and Harry peered around it. “Hello?” His voice echoed through the foyer, but no one replied. He slipped inside and shut the door with an audible click. After standing there for a minute waiting for someone to greet him like usual, he ventured further into the house. He glanced into several rooms but found them all empty. Starting to feel rather embarrassed, he slinked into the kitchen.
Another hour and a half of work went by and Draco’s cubicle mate, Charles, got up. “Lunch?” He asked, grabbing his jacket and slipping it on.
Draco hesitated. He rather liked his bollocks where they were, thank you very much. But Potter was walking out and Draco was running out of time to think. Did he even have a chance at this point? Was Potter only going to yell at him some more? Should he just cut his losses and Apparate back to his flat?
“I’m going to hex him, you know,” and he plunged his hand into the depths of the couch and found his wand, giving it a useless wave. “He’s worse than the Prophet.”
“How’s the training program?” Draco blurted out, startling Potter and himself in the process. Potter looked at him as if he’d grown a few more heads, not bothering to answer Draco’s question.
But then, he thought, visibly deflating, how is it possible that his parents came out of Voldemort’s wand, back in fourth year? How were they resurrected by the stone during the Battle? Harry wanted to yell out in frustration and pain, but only shot the ground a glare and, with one last look at the dark building beyond the iron bars, he apparated home.
Harry gave her a peck on the cheek and a hug before grabbing his basket. “I’ll floo you with any updates,” he said as he made his way to the front door.
Harry heard Draco scoff next to him, and when he looked, Draco only said, “Of course the door is red. Bloody Gryffindors.” Harry laughed and gave the blonde a friendly shove, catching him when he almost fell backwards down the front steps. Harry’s hand slid to the knob, fingers circling the brass and feeling the shape of it in his palm.
of drinks,” he pointedly emphasised, “but there’s too much in our past that I just can’t set aside. We don’t like each other, and we never have.”
Draco nodded. “We haven’t exactly avoided being seen together, yet somehow the Prophet hasn’t gotten wind of it. Still, I would rather my mother find out from me than a newspaper.” Harry had to use all the muscles in his face to keep his expression casual instead of grinning like a loon. After studying his face for a moment, Draco seemed to force himself to continue, “She deserves to know what’s happening. I would feel a lot better if I could-”
Hermione sighed and plopped on the sofa by Harry’s feet. “More than ever. And I don’t know why considering I’m less than qualified for it.”
“Don’t fall asleep on me next time,” she warned. “When are you going to tell Malfoy that you’re in love with him?”
The next day he went back to the gate and did the same thing, only this time he decided to try talking to the house.
He weaved between tables and out the door. Potter was rounding on him before he even had a chance to blink, pointing a solid finger in his face. “You haven’t changed at all,” Potter declared, his eyes bright with fury and something Draco wanted to say was attraction, but couldn’t be certain.
He leaned over the banister and shouted, “Fourth floor!” He waited until he heard the creak of footsteps on the first flight of stairs and then continued his work in the loo. Only a moment passed before Ron was joining him, leaning against the doorway. Harry nodded in greeting and hammered a nail into the wall, precisely where he wanted it.
Hermione, however, has taken no time in moving up within the Ministry. She began as a secretary in the Muggle-Worthy Excuses division of the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, and her muggleborn status quickly became a tool for her to use and she became part of the committee within months of starting the job. Less than a year later she was already moving up to the DMLE, acting as a liaison for the Improper Use of Magic office. She spent a year and a half there, before applying for a position as part of Minister Shacklebolt’s support staff. Shacklebolt, knowing how hardworking and intelligent Hermione was, hired her without an interview. She now works closely with Shacklebolt and his team.
Harry slid a hand through his hair several times. He wanted to run, run as fast and far as he could until his lungs were fighting for air and he couldn’t go any further. But Harry had never really been that kind of person. Gryffindor blood rushed through his veins and kept him rooted to the spot, awaiting a house elf he’d never met before.
“Only when you’re around,” was his verbal reply. It was said in the same jesting tone as before, but had some sort of finality to it as well. Seriousness. They didn’t dwell like that, however, as Harry quickly spoke again, “I’ll go to practice if you have lunch.”
— he could’ve had if he’d only thought about it the way Wood had framed it. The Gryffindors, Wood had said Draco
Ron gave him a wary look, then patted Harry’s shoulder a couple of times before resting his hand there briefly. “You don’t have to stay, mate.”
“You invited me,” was Malfoy’s reply, “and I wanted to come.” On a whim, Harry grabbed his wrist and pulled him behind a tree.
The toe of his shoe hit a slab of concrete and he finally looked away from the scenery around him to see the beginning of a short staircase, leading up to a front door. Without thinking, he took the step, and the next and the next, until he was pressing his palm against the front doors.
Potter didn’t seem interested in him in the least, despite Draco’s attempts to not only flirt, but also make Potter jealous. Draco had to do the only thing he could think of to get Potter to look at him as something more than just the bullying kid he used to be. Merlin, did he really have to do this?
“Interesting,” Malfoy simply said, giving Harry a calculated look. “Did you try asking it to let you in?”
Harry was beginning to feel lost and hopeless. He’d been there for more than two weeks straight and the gate hadn’t loosened up at all. He was trying not to doubt Malfoy, against his better judgement, mainly because he was one of the only people he knew who had a manor to take care of. He could use someone with experience.
“Are you having me on?” Harry asked finally, lips turning up into a smile. His serious voice faltered when he said, “because I would like to get into my house, if you’d be so kind as to help me.”
He placed a hand on the table, experimentally giving it a shake. The tower of glass wobbled dangerously, almost tipping over, and Draco backed away instinctively.
Harry hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to say it. Whether he should explain first or go with his gut. Explaining would be the reasonable thing to do, but then there’s the opportunity for rejection that Harry doesn’t think he could handle. He figured it was best to beg for forgiveness if it doesn’t work out. What’s life without a little risk?
Ginny nudged Harry’s arm and he forced his eyes open. “Hmm?” he asked, watching as she pushed at his arm again.
“Hello, Potter,” Draco said politely. “I was hoping I’m not too late to place an order for Valentine’s day.”
Gringotts was nearly empty by the time Draco arrived. It was late on a Friday afternoon, the bank closing in a mere ten minutes or so. Most of the employees were gone, leaving a few scattered across the lobby, conducting last-minute business before the week was out. Draco was escorted down to his vaults, where he filled a few pouches with Galleons.
Fresh drink in hand, Draco wandered over to the group. The stack of glasses was dangerously close to toppling over at this point. No one was touching the table any longer, most likely in fear it would do just that. He stood behind Thomas, off to the side, and cleared his throat. “May I join?”
In response, Draco changed as much as he was required to not be hexed constantly while walking down the street. He donated a good portion of his inheritance to Muggle-born charities, Muggle organisations, and even Granger’s house-elf foundation. All in all, he hadn’t changed that much. He still preferred the company of pure-bloods, though Slytherin background was no longer required for his friendship. His biggest change, however, was that he had become an excellent actor.
“Let’s go back,” Draco suggested, pulling Harry into his side and turning away from the doors.  “We can grab a pint if you’d like.”
He sighed and looked up at the sky. “Sometimes I think it’s best I let my parents go, but all I knew of them for so long is what other people had told me. I wish I could discover things for myself.” He sat in silence for long moments, watching the clouds roll by in the sky.
Harry couldn’t resist. He leaned back in for another kiss and Draco complied, though only for a couple seconds before pulling away. “Come back tonight,” Harry whispered, voice deeper than he expected it to sound, “I’ll make it up to you.”
The party was in full swing and his coworkers, even the Head Auror, seemed to be having a good time. Draco was thankful this didn’t end up like that secret birthday party he tried to throw for Pansy a few years back. This one actually seemed to be going over well and he was pleasantly surprised. The harpist in the corner was playing beautiful music that really set the friendly mood, and Draco didn’t think he’d talked to this many of his coworkers in one day before this. He did hope that the success of this party didn’t automatically qualify him to plan the rest of them, however.
“It won’t work, Malfoy,” and before Draco had a chance for rebuttal, Potter continued, “Look, I can’t deny I’ve thought about it before when I’d had a few drinks. A
“Can we talk about something else?” Harry grumbled, laying the blueprints he’d been fidgeting with on the desk.
Draco shot him a little glare and apologized to his client, then turned his attention back to Harry. “I’ll be with you in just a moment, Mister Potter.”
Harry had gone back to Malfoy’s office several more times over the last fortnight, despite there really being nothing that the blonde could do for him. Harry always found an excuse to pop in, whether it be because the gate moved a millimeter, or because Harry thought he might have seen something move past the gates.
It’s fine, he told himself. He could do this. He was skilled at balancing on a broom, he’d handled priceless vintage vases before. He could balance a measly glass, no problem.
“On Monday,” Harry replied as he stepped onto the path and continued further onto the property, Ron following in awe. Halfway to the mansion, Harry veered to the left and pushed through a line of trees to find an open meadow.
He swung a leg over his broom and took off into the air, muttering a quick spell to attach his glasses to his face so they wouldn’t fall. He flew around the pitch a few times before hovering near the stands. He heard Mrs. Weasley shout, “Be careful Harry!” Ginny, sat next to her, rolled her eyes and mouthed what looked like the word “buzzkill”. Harry just laughed and winked at Ginny before taking off around the pitch again.
The group cheered after Thomas spoke, watching Draco. Thomas placed Draco’s glass back in his hands and grabbed onto Draco’s shoulders, giving him a light shake. “Listen, mate. Listen, you can do this. You were—” Thomas paused to belch off to the side, laughing. “You were a great Quidditch player, just don’t knock it down. That’s the rule.”
Wordlessly, Harry wandered out the French doors to the backyard. It was rather easy picking Teddy out of the crowd of pre-schoolers and parents. Harry silently wished Teddy’s muggle friends weren’t around, so that his hair could flash every color imaginable. He always loved seeing his godson so happy and excited.
After the war, Harry decided to return for his last year of school with Hermione and Ron, but ended up spending much of it helping Headmistress McGonagall rebuild. He still had no idea what kind of job he wanted, and several tea times with the Headmistress only served to confuse him more. Since the end of that year, McGonagall had asked him back several times as a guest speaker, and once as a substitute teacher for a week. He’d be lying if he said he didn’t like those times. Being back at the school was difficult, but teaching reminded him of fifth year when all his friends stood by his side against Umbridge and the only death had been Cedric.
Everything was the same. The gate opened at his touch, the trees and plants lit up, the sun shone down on the long, narrow pathway to the front door, and that feeling of glee returned in Harry’s chest. He felt like his heart grew three sizes every time he walked through that gate.
He had repainted the entire house in white. Despite having very few windows, it felt much brighter in each room. The dungeon-like kitchen now felt like a normal kitchen, with new cabinets and even a muggle refrigerator.  Sometimes Harry felt he had replaced the whole house, that there were no longer any memories lingering from his youth in this house, but other times Harry thought he needed to make this house the complete opposite of what it used to be. Maybe it was just for his peace of mind.
Neville shook his head. “Absolutely not. Can you imagine how awful it would look if I made Harry Potter, the boy who literally saved the entire universe, pay for something? The whole shop would be abandoned!”
Draco allowed him a few seconds to recover, then returned to his brutal pace. Sweat dripped down the side of his face as he fucked into Potter repeatedly, Potter mouthing at his neck. Draco’s release took him by surprise. He buried his face in Potter’s chest, letting out a deep groan as the pleasure peaked.
Harry also spent over a year on a muggle construction crew. Being able to build something, even just a wall, from the ground up without the use of magic helped him relax. He built up his strength and made quite a few friends along the way. He didn’t do it much lately. He wanted to focus on Grimmauld Place. He had made quite a few changes already, like getting rid of those horrid house elf heads and that noisy portrait of Sirius’ mother. He had opened a new vault in Gringott’s for the Black family heirlooms that he found. He didn’t necessarily want to keep them, but the thought of the latest generation of Blacks coming at him for destroying their family history made him shiver.
Harry was sick of the suspense. He wanted this and he would deal with any consequences later. His unoccupied hand flew up to cup Malfoy’s jaw, and even though that was his hurt shoulder and pain began radiating down his arm again, he could barely feel it. Malfoy’s hand, which he had wrapped around Harry’s elbow, felt white hot.
“Mm,” he grumbled, muffled by the chair in his face, “soft.” Harry barked out a laugh in response, probably too loud for the situation and pretty much unwarranted as what Draco had said wasn’t even funny. He lightly wrapped his hand around Draco’s ankle, not pulling or gripping, just feeling. The soft hairs caressed his fingers as his thumb moved to trace circles around Draco’s ankle bone.
, Harry supposed, sat behind his desk, perfectly postured while he furiously scribbled on a piece of parchment. When Harry walked in, Draco didn’t react, which made him think the worst. Was he regretful of their almost-kiss? Did he hate Harry for getting them caught? It wasn’t really his fault that the Weasley’s snuck up on them. He hoped the blonde wasn’t embarrassed to be seen with him. Though it wasn’t as if the reaction would be overwhelmingly positive if the two of them
When he arrived on the landing outside the kitchen, Kreacher was lingering by the doorway, muttering about ungrateful Malfoys. This made Harry smile and he walked straight in to see a mug of hot tea floating towards his head. He grabbed it out of the air and took a tentative sip. “So you just came for breakfast?” He asked casually, taking a seat at the table. Draco didn’t reply, and didn’t seem as if he intended to, yet Harry waited for it all the same. After several silent minutes, Harry pulled the book he’d been reading over breakfast for the last month closer. It was just some fictitious wizarding novel with a predictable plot, but it still entertained him nonetheless.
He wasn’t sure how long he should stay, or whether he should try the gate again before he left. He knew it wasn’t an exact science, that this was the first time he’d spent more than ten minutes here and this time he wasn’t angry or frustrated at all. For all he knew, the gate may choose to open by itself when it trusts him.
The next day he returned to Gringott’s, walking straight past the goblins and down the left corridor. He cursed himself for wearing the same, squeaky shoes. As he neared the door at the end, he silently rehearsed what he would say to Malfoy. After one swift knock, the door swung open just as it had last time. Malfoy set his wand to the side.
“Woah,” exclaimed Ron as he took in the scenery around him. The open field full of soft, beautiful grass and dotted with flowers and trees was truly a sight to behold, Harry could admit. This was his fourth day in a row having lunch in this field because he loved how cushiony the grass was under a blanket. He could honestly spend forever out here watching the clouds and then the stars after the sunset.
It had been more than twenty years since anyone had set foot on that property. When he did this afternoon, he didn’t really expect so much to change, and it gave him a fleeting hope that just stepping into the foyer or the kitchens would allow the house to restore itself to its former glory. But there was also the possibility of losing those memories, those connections to his parents that were tied to the manor.
Malfoy waved his wand and a file shot itself out of a cabinet behind him. He gingerly opened it and laid it flat against his desk. “9 Milford Lane, Weybridge, Surrey.” He handed Harry a piece of parchment with the address written in a fancy script.
There was a momentary silence before Harry asked Neville about his business, which launched him into an interesting conversation over the possibility of opening another location of his shop. After Hogwarts, Neville had become quite the entrepreneur, launching first his massive new garden complete with new hybrid species on the grounds of his manor, and then his retail shop which included not only flowers and plants for any special occasion one could imagine, but certain rare plants and herbs that may be needed for potion brewing and remedies for healing as well. Harry had gone to visit his shop numerous times, specifically because the man makes the best bruise reducer in the country, at least in Harry’s opinion. Quidditch is no match for Longbottom’s Revitalizing Remedy for Bruises and Burns.
Several Gryffindors took up a table meant for two, surrounding the surface in a wide circle. Empty glasses were piled up in the middle, a cheer emanating from that direction every time one of them added another glass to the top of the pile. Potter was absent from that group. In fact, the only one Draco could name was Dean Thomas; the rest he recognised as Gryffindors from years below him.
“What happens if I do?” Draco questioned, the glass almost slipping out of his fingers. His reflexes were fucked, he could tell that easily. He wandered closer to the table, swaying with the weight of several strong drinks in his system.
Thomas was seated on the edge of the bed, tugging pants on so slowly Draco thought he may have still been asleep. Draco heard a gag and then a sigh, watched Thomas lower his head into his hands, the planes of his back on full display. He was lean and not so muscular, like Draco.
He gave Draco’s bottom lip one last nip and forced himself to pull away. “Thanks ever so,” Draco said after they caught their breath, a lilt of annoyance present in his voice. Harry pressed one last kiss to Draco’s red and swollen lips before getting off Draco, pulling the blonde to his feet in the same motion. Draco adjusted his trousers before giving Harry a withering look that he didn’t mean.
Draco was a collector of sorts. His specialities included vintage crystal vases, keys to unknown locks, trips abroad, and, most recently, Gryffindor men. He’d had most of them in his bed, the queer ones anyway, but there was one he hadn’t quite gathered the courage to pursue yet. And, unsurprisingly, it happened to be the lead Gryffindor: Harry Potter.
It was in this condition he decided to stop by Gringott’s, a decision he regretted as soon as he stepped into the lobby. Witches and wizards turned to look at him and goblins sneered when he walked through the lobby to the corridor. Surprisingly, his shoes did not squeak the whole way down to Malfoy’s office. He stopped just short of the door and tried to
This was a date, right? He had asked Draco out for dinner after they’d made out in his office for quite some time, so that was the assumption. He’d specifically chosen this semi-fancy muggle restaurant so they wouldn’t be recognized and they could dine in peace, but with every ticking minute gone by, it seemed to be falling apart.
Harry went back the next day. And the next day, and the next. Ron and Hermione tagged along for another day, then his friend Luna had come. Harry had asked all his friends to come, despite it sounding like an odd way to spend a couple of hours. Neville had passed, too busy with his flourishing business, but told Harry once he gets in he’ll gladly do some landscaping if Harry would like. Dean and Seamus were on their honeymoon currently and could not come. Molly, Arthur, Charlie, George, Ron, and Ginny came with him one day, and they spent several hours chatting and chowing down on the sandwiches Molly had brought for the crowd.
Somehow Harry got roped into playing football with Teddy and his friends. Him, Teddy, and a little girl were on one team, much to Teddy’s pleasure considering it was his birthday. Harry was making his way down the makeshift field in the yard, dribbling the ball between his feet, getting so close to the goal when three of his opposing team ganged up on him. His foot slipped over the ball and he landed flat on his back, quickly covered in five- and six-year-olds.
“Clearly everything that happened when we were children still bothers you, considering how little you can stand to look me in the eye, so why don’t we just talk about it so we can both move on?” Draco had given Potter a wide berth when he was trying to leave, and he closed that distance, now only standing a few feet away.
Hogwarts had changed, as well. Draco had reinstated his parent’s position on the Board of Governors, though he frankly thought himself too young to be a part of it. Muggle Studies was now a required course. The four houses remained, but all competition between them ceased. No more House Cup, no more point system, et cetera. The Quidditch teams were now voluntary, that is — students could pick the team they were on. The castle was still being repaired now, even several years later, but the structure never seemed stronger. Draco had been wary of returning for his eighth year at first, expecting people to point fingers, hex him, or even intentionally get him expelled. But most of the returning students and professors seemed too tired to place the blame on anyone but Voldemort. Most would rather focus on recovery.
Harry apparated to the Burrow the next evening. Despite his newfound home full of memories from his parents, grandparents, and beyond, he wasn’t going to give up on the family he’d had since he was eleven. It just wasn’t done. Plus he could never give up Molly’s treacle tart. He was weak.
“Gonna fuck you,” Draco whispered hotly, teeth scraping against Potter’s earlobe. Potter spread his legs in response, allowing Draco’s body to fall between them. Potter muttered a lubrication charm, aimed at Draco’s hand, and the pad of Draco’s middle finger swiped against Potter’s hole. His finger slid in easily, Potter shuddering underneath him, and he wasted no time in adding another digit. Potter whined, pressing his arse down against Draco’s fingers.
Draco’s foot stopped shaking from impatience immediately and his hand gripped Harry’s just as tight. Harry, who had barely looked away in the past five minutes, watched a small smile form on Draco’s lips and pledged himself right there to make Draco smile all the time until the end of history and forever. It was beautiful and contagious.
What the hell happened last night? He couldn’t remember ever being this hungover. The last thing he remembered was Thomas’ hands wrapping around his waist, lifting him up. Oh, he thought. The tower. Draco hadn’t knocked it over. Thomas had kissed him in celebration, Potter had looked disappointed. Was that due to Draco’s success or Thomas’ kiss? He couldn’t tell. Flashes of the rest of the night went through his head. Another bottle of Firewhisky was purchased. Someone knocked over the tower, the sound of shattering glass still loud in Draco’s brain. Thomas brought him out to dance, the band replaced by a DJ playing Muggle party music. Draco could almost still feel the bass thumping in his chest. Then Potter had shown up again, whispering to Thomas. Thomas shaking his head, Potter leaving. Thomas’ hands on his arse, their hips grinding together on the dance floor. Potter again, angry this time, trying to talk to Draco over the music. Draco couldn’t remember what was said.
When he arrived back at Grimmauld Place, he barely had time to set down the basket and grab the blueprints he made for Neville before he was apparating again, this time to Diagon Alley. Friday lunchtime seemed to be coming to an end, as the heels of businesswomen clacked down the paved alley hurriedly, followed by the thick steps from their male counterparts. Harry headed in the opposite direction of the flow of people, further in rather than out. He checked his watch again as he was passing Gringott’s. Sometimes apparating took longer than expected and he couldn’t be late. Well, he probably could, but he thought that rather rude.
“What are you doing here?” Potter said in an accusing voice, the sound echoing throughout the lobby.
He turned on the tub to its hottest setting and stared at himself in the mirror until it was so fogged over he couldn’t distinguish himself from the wall behind him.
The elf grumbled and began his slow descent down the stairs, gripping onto the handrail to keep himself upright. He could be heard whispering and grunting to himself as he passed the interlocked couple- were they a couple?- but the two men paid no mind, returning to their moment together.
He squeezed it lightly before letting go, but found that he missed the physical contact. Harry found himself leaning closer and decided to place his hand on Malfoy’s outer arm, close to his shoulder, for balance. At least that’s what he told himself.
“Can I open my presents now?” Teddy pleaded, his bottom lip protruding dramatically. Harry nearly rolled his eyes.
They made their way up the path, taking their time and admiring the views. Harry was grateful for his best friends, allowing him to take it slow. The closer they got to the front door, the more his palms sweat, the harder his jaw clenched. Before he knew it, they were standing there, on the stoop, and he was reaching for the handle. He gripped it firmly and turned his wrist.
Draco’s eyes darkened critically, fingers tightening around Harry’s wrist. “He couldn’t if he tried. He’d have to go through the entirety of wizarding Britain to get to you. And he’d have to go through me.”
Harry glanced past the gate onto the grounds. It was quite foggy, and he could barely make out the shape of the mansion in the distance. He’d hoped bringing his friends for tea would help the house trust him, but he didn’t notice any changes in it. He sighed and sipped his tea as it grew colder, tuning back into the conversation.
He compromised with himself and hoisted Draco into his arms, depositing him on the couch before he made the long trek up to his bedroom.
Potter finished setting up and took a glance around the rest of the room. “It looks nice, Malfoy. You might have that party planning gene after all.”
“You’re going to have tea at your manor?” Harry nodded and finished packing his basket. “It’s an interesting idea. Mind if I join?”
“Thanks, mate,” he said, slipping the canister into his pocket. “Maybe one day you’ll let me pay for it.”
Harry definitely thought he needed to find a way to make the gate move faster, rather than spending a whole minute each time waiting for it to open wide enough for someone to slip through. He supposed some oil on the hinges might do the trick. Ron waved his goodbye before apparating and Harry followed suit short after, picnic basket in hand.
“Shit, Harry!” Ron exclaimed, throwing his shirt over Hermione to cover her top. Harry hadn’t even noticed, too far in his head, and had just collapsed on the couch with a long, loud sigh.
Draco, having watched this scene dozens of times before, suggested, “Living room? I don’t know. Look, Potter, you don’t have to rush—”
Harry pecked him on the cheek and wished him a good rest of the day at work, and then apparated on the spot.
Morning came and nearly passed before Harry was prodded awake by a gruesome face. Kreacher was standing over him on his bed, face inches from Harry’s. He merely groaned, too used to the elf’s strange actions.
“-think Kingsley is beginning to hate his position as Minister,” Hermione had been saying. “He’s been coming by my cube for the past week. He never used to do that.” She poured herself another half cup of tea and wrapped her hands around the mug to stay warm. “And he’s been giving me tips, too. Like the other day he said, ‘the best way to get a promotion is to ask for one’. Isn’t that odd? I just had a promotion a month ago.”
The restaurant was packed, to put it simply. Harry had put their name in a half hour ago and they were still waiting for their table, shoulders pressed together as they squeezed into the only free space on the bench. Draco was becoming increasingly more impatient as he crossed his legs and sighed several times in the span of two minutes. Harry was rather relaxed, but he was steadily getting more worried that his date would end up bursting at the seams before they were even sat.
“What are you doing?” Potter asked, setting his glass, heavy with Firewhisky, down with an audible thump and turning to look at Draco expectantly.
Harry was busy pressing his forehead into the gate like he’d done on numerous occasions in the last few weeks when Draco urged him to turn around. When he did, he was met with another pair of lips on him. Those soft, familiar ones that he’d imagined so many times in the past month. The ones he had just kissed moments before. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and tilted his head to slot their lips together, trying not to smile or laugh in excitement. He finally had to break the kiss, unable to contain his wide grin.
The gates looked unchanged, the same black, heavy iron that had kept him out for the past week. Harry was determined. He needed to find out what was inside. His parents had been gone for over twenty years and every piece of evidence from their lives that he had found so far had been a blessing and a curse. He loved his parents with every fiber of his being, loved finding out new things that no one had told him of them, and he loved discovering the similarities between himself and his parents. But with every new shred of information, the fact that he would never actually see his parents alive and in the flesh sunk lower in his stomach until it felt like an anvil weighing him down.
Draco took a step forward and the first word of his reply was halfway out of his mouth when something miraculous happened. A loud scraping sound erupted from the gate and Harry jerked in surprise, his head turning so fast he felt dizzy. Or maybe that had been the effect of the kiss and the--
“Well I think it’s wonderful that you’re putting yourself out there Harry darling,” she replied with finality, shocking Harry into silence by her easy acceptance. She hadn’t exactly been pleased when he told her he was gay, probably holding onto some hope that he and Ginny would end up together, but it only took her a day or two to come around. He was grateful as the conversation veered in another direction now.
Harry turned towards his friend, a small smile playing on his lips. He pressed his hand against the gate and it immediately unlocked and began to swing inward. Ron’s mouth flew open.
“Look, I…like you, alright? I don’t see the point in skipping around the fact anymore. Of course I felt like you may like me too since we almost kissed the other day, but let’s be honest, I’m not the most observant person. If you don’t like me though that’s fine and I’m sorry for kissing you without talking about it first but I’m on my last leg with this house. I’ve been here everyday, I’ve tried everything you said, and that was the only thing I could think of that might convince it that I intend to stay. Those
Draco kept a list — several, in fact — in a little blue pocketbook that kept him company throughout his days as a… Well, he didn’t exactly have a job. He’d inherited the Malfoy fortune, after all. Manor, peacocks, history, and all. The house-elves took care of that, while Draco lived in a penthouse flat in downtown London amongst the Muggles.
Harry flushed and broke eye contact with George. “He’s fine,” he mumbled, not really ashamed but not exactly thrilled to have his love life broadcast to the entirety of the Weasley family, though he had to admit they hadn’t exactly been hiding the fact that they had been spending quite a bit of time together in the last few weeks. He knew the Weasleys loved him but he was sure they had some residual qualms about the Malfoy family. He just hoped he could convince them that Draco wasn’t like his father. Not that Harry even knew that much about Draco’s family life of late.
The response was instantaneous. Potter’s fingers tightened themselves, clutching onto Draco’s shirt and no doubt wrinkling the fabric. His head tilted, slotting their lips together just right so that his tongue met Draco’s when their lips parted. Draco’s hand drifted lower, grabbing hold of Potter’s arse and turning them, so Potter was now the one pressed against the wall. And then they were off, Potter’s nails scratching against Draco’s skin in his effort to unbutton the fabric. Draco’s fingers followed the waistband of Potter’s jeans until he reached the button, undoing it with a flick of his wrist. His hand drifted lower, pressing his palm against Potter’s groin through his pants.
When he finished the tea, he repacked the basket and stood. He considered tugging on the gate once, just to check, but instead decided to merely rest his forehead against it for a moment before apparating away.
Draco rolled his eyes and watched the top of the sheet slide from Harry’s chest down to pool in his lap. Harry suddenly felt self-conscious, cursing himself for deciding to sleep naked last night and was tempted to cover himself back up, not that anything particularly indecent was on display. Draco stared for several long seconds before schooling his face as though there wasn’t a hungry blaze in his eye. “Get dressed, I’m making breakfast.”
“I figure I should start,” Draco said in a firm voice, though a hint of question came through. He wasn’t normally this nervous; generally, the men he pursued were already half-drunk and up for most things. But this was different, almost intimate. Draco realised he hadn’t been on a date in over a year; hadn’t even been out to eat with friends for nearly that long.
“Just wanted to say thanks for the drink,” Potter said to him, before turning to the girl and seeming to size her up.
Harry scoffed and pulled the ice pack off his shoulder. He thanked the healer and apologized for his bad language while she was fixing his arm. “I don’t think I care much about winning,” he started as the two walked out of the pitch and towards the apparition spot nearby, “I like to play and I like being on a broom in the air. And it’s the minors anyway, so a lot of us are here just for fun.”
Draco started to turn back in protest, but Thomas just turned him back and the rest of the crowd cheered again, leaning forward in their respective seats. And Draco understood. This was like a sport to them, a game to play when they got together. Draco could hear a quick wager being made between a few people beside him.
Harry nearly jumped out of his skin, instinctively grabbing his wand from under his pillow and throwing the blanket back off his face. He squinted in the darkness of the room, only general shapes visible without his glasses.
Draco nodded, looking down as Harry faced him. He couldn’t help but smile when he saw the way Harry was looking at him. As if in awe, although Draco didn’t think he’d done anything quite worthy of that reaction. He cleared his throat and gently unlocked their arms. “I’ll write you then,” he said politely, unsure of what to say.
“Just put your fucking prick inside me,” Potter insisted, his fingers curling in the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck and tugging sharply. Draco didn’t hesitate. He sat back up and coated his prick in the remaining lube, tugging Potter’s hips closer and lining himself up. Potter’s hand slid up Draco’s thigh, nails digging in when Draco began pushing into him. “Yessss, Merlin,” Potter hissed.
The couple finally bid goodbye and Potter, in turn, ordered another drink for himself, eyes once again travelling around the bar and landing on Draco. Draco, luckily, had still been watching Potter out of the corner of his eye and was absentmindedly chatting with the woman next to him. Her name was Rebecca, or Rachel, or… something. Draco had been letting her do the majority of the talking, considering she hadn’t even stopped to allow him a response anyway. Potter watched him until a fresh drink was placed in front of him, then seemed to revert back to his previous loner state.
The first thing Harry saw was the pale blonde hair, combed into a neat, respectable style just as it had been in their 8th year at Hogwarts. Malfoy sat behind a large wooden desk, leaning back in his chair but not lounging by any means. He beckoned Harry to come in and he did, standing awkwardly. To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy barely looked shocked to see him standing in front of him. It had been several years since the last time they saw each other at Hogwarts. Though the Wizengamot was not particular to throwing Draco Malfoy in Azkaban, they were rather hopeful they could secure house arrest for him and his mother. For four hours he had argued with the court, insistent that they let Draco and Narcissa Malfoy go free. The former because he was merely a teen at the time, still heavily influenced by his father’s political views, and the latter because she had saved his life in the forest. After those tiresome hours, in which Harry had drank so much water to clear his dry throat that by the end he desperately needed to relieve his bladder but refused to on principle, they had finally cut a deal. Draco Malfoy would return to Hogwarts for his eighth year, after which he would be off scot-free, and Narcissa would be placed on a loose probation. All things considered, Harry assumed that was the best he would get so he agreed.
Practice was utterly boring that day. The coach, a portly man that huffed and puffed just to get to center pitch, instructed them to run laps to “keep their figures”. Harry zoned out while doing so, thoroughly missing Draco and wishing he could run straight out of the pitch to the nearest apparition point. Instead, he finished off his laps after every other member of his team, hit the showers, and went back home.
Harry was struck by the sheer politeness in Malfoy’s voice. He eagerly handed the document over, taking a seat across the desk from the blonde and wringing his hands together. Harry had had no idea Malfoy had gotten a job at Gringott’s, though, he admitted, he hadn’t really kept tabs on the bloke after they were free from the shared dorm at Hogwarts. Harry and Malfoy went their separate ways and had barely crossed paths since. Harry recalled only one or two times where he saw that white blonde hair disappearing behind a corner in Diagon Alley, but other than that he’d practically been a ghost in society.
Harry’s cheeks burned, and he felt a wave of embarrassment wash over him as he slowly nodded. He couldn’t believe he was twenty-three and still couldn’t make any big steps without his best friends by his side. He was scared of what he’d find at the property. Maybe he’d find portraits of his relatives. Maybe his dad still had a bedroom there, littered with quidditch magazines and school supplies. Or maybe it’d be empty. Harry couldn’t tell which he feared more—finding bits and pieces of his parents and other relatives’ lives, or finding nothing.
They walked into ruin. The grand entryway was littered with shards of glass, which seemed to be due to the ceiling cracking, sending the chandelier falling to the floor below. Half of it still hung from one long chain. The staircase was missing several planks of wood, and the paint was so chipped and faded that it honestly looked rotted through. Despite his contracting experience, Harry walked over and set his foot on the first stair; however, when he leaned forward to take the next stair, he heard a deep crack and his foot fell through the first. He pulled his foot out of the stair and brushed the splinters off his pant leg. Windows on either side of the room were cracked or shattered, and one window was completely gone, frame and everything. Harry felt a soft breeze hit him when he approached the window, and he sneezed. A thick layer of dust covered the place. The fireplace was a disaster. It looked as though bricks had been pried from the wall, compromising the structure so much that the rest of it collapsed in on itself. Harry walked over to it and prodded at a few of the broken pieces, crouching down. A large cabinet leaned dangerously on an angle, one of the legs having broken off. The floorboards creaked under his weight as he made his way back to Ron and Hermione.
“Merlin, what’s got into those people?” he inquired while taking the seat opposite Neville’s desk. The other man was looking quite frazzled himself, typing away on a muggle calculator.
Harry felt a shiver climbing slowly up his spine, as if it possessed legs that propelled itself using every bone as another step. He didn’t like when people vowed to protect him. Especially considering many of those that did died at some point in the war, and considering a vicious enemy had been looming over their heads, overpowering them for years and it seemed as if only Dumbledore’s protection was effective enough. Though that hadn’t lasted nearly long enough. But something about Draco’s words made him feel more safe than he ever had, even when he’d been staying at the Burrow.
The bottle that sat next to Harry was slowly drained into each of their glasses until there wasn’t a single drop left. The two men were quite drunk. Draco couldn’t stop rubbing the velvet fabric of the chair he was sitting in and finally leaned over to rest his cheek against it.
But they weren’t dating, technically, so Harry had to admit it was rude of him to appear so often and expect Draco to immediately be available. Draco had a job. A
“Tell who? What?” Harry said, confused and half asleep. He pulled the covers back up to his shoulder, giving Ginny some, but not all, of them.
“Kreacher,” Harry started, turning his head to peer at the elf who was unabashedly staring at them with his large black eyes from the top of the staircase. “Could you start lunch?”
George took a long sip of his wine and then leaned forward, enunciating clearly as if he had slurred his words the first time. “I said, ‘So, Harry, how’s Malfoy?’”
, he told himself. Harry tried not to stare at him the whole time, awkwardly looking around the office again until Malfoy had finished.
Harry could tell something was up. He wasn’t sure what was coming, but he hoped it wasn’t as serious as the negative thoughts that had immediately sprung to his head. What if Draco didn’t want to spend time with him anymore? Nothing was really official yet, but Harry could already feel the disappointment that would come from it. But if Draco had intended on not-quite breaking up with him, why would he kiss his cheek and make him breakfast? Or maybe Harry just wasn’t good enough for him. He hadn’t exactly chose the best place for their dates- a pub and a restaurant with terrible service and worse wine. Maybe he was fucking all of this up. It’s not as if he had much dating experience to begin with, just that one disastrous one with Cho in fifth year, a couple with Ginny before they decided they should remain friends, and the one with that Muggle bloke on his construction crew a couple of years ago. All of which weren’t exactly his best, most romantic moments. Yet he could already feel despite their terrible dates that Draco was different than all the rest of them. He just felt different about where they were going.
A waiter came by with a bottle of wine, making a point to show the label to Potter, who just nodded without really taking the time to look, before uncorking it and pouring them both a tasting. Potter, the heathen, didn’t even wait for the waiter to walk away before grabbing the bottle and dumping enough wine in to fill his glass to the brim. Draco watched in fascination (and disgust) as Potter downed half the glass without a word, or even the barest glance at Draco, and then proceeded to peruse the menu for the next several minutes.
After sitting for an hour, unable to sleep despite the rhythmic sound of Draco’s breathing, Harry stood up. The alcohol was still coursing through his system, but he was slightly more stable than he had been and he debated whether he wanted to carry Draco to the bed in the guest room or just crash on the couch across from him.
“Yours is there, of course,” Neville told him, “you think I’d let them sell out and not save one for my number one customer?”
“Uncle Harry!” Harry suddenly found himself with an armful of excited, wriggling six year old. Teddy clung to his leg, until Harry finally stooped down to lift him up. Teddy placed a great big, slobbery kiss on Harry’s cheek.
He pulled open the basket and pulled out the thermos of tea and a baggie of biscuits. He also grabbed a small plate and a teacup before turning the basket over and using the top as a makeshift table. He wanted this to be as formal as possible. He poured the tea, added a cube of sugar, and stirred.
“I kidnapped Draco and kissed him by the gate,” Harry replied in a deadpan voice. He could feel Ron’s stare on the side of his face, almost like it was another sun.
He gathered his clothes, startling when something thumped to the floor. His little blue book had slipped from his pocket, lying open on the shag carpet. Draco tossed his clothes in the laundry, scooped up the book, and deposited it in the bin.
“Do you think you’ll stay? I mean… If you’ve got other deliveries, it’s okay, but…I’d like it if you stayed.” Draco didn’t face Potter when he said this, his cheeks exponentially heating up with each word out of his mouth.
He finally came to a stop outside the last office. There was a large sign on the door declaring, “MAGICAL DEEDS AND REALTY” and, in a slightly less offending size, “Draco Malfoy – Director.” Harry only had a few seconds to panic about seeing his longtime school nemesis before the door swung open sharply.
“Yes, obviously.” Though Draco wanted to point out the last two times they’d seen each other, it was Potter who had “shown up”.
Not many, he discovered. Pansy was in the corner, a man on either side of her, right where Draco knew she wanted to be. He watched as one of the men leaned in to whisper in her ear, her lips curving up in a silent laugh. The other man was brushing kisses and licks down the slope of her neck and shoulder. Draco would have to owl her tomorrow to see how that went.
The man below him squirmed, only releasing whimpering or choked-off moans when he couldn’t hold his breath any longer. He understood them, their desires. Most of them just wanted the experience; to be fucked by Draco Malfoy, the most prominent Slytherin they knew. They didn’t want word to spread around, even though it was whispered in private conversations, under silencing spells, and written on parchment attached to an owl’s leg. He didn’t mind. He knew he was a good shag. If word spread, it only helped him.
“It…worked. It worked!” He laughed, grabbing onto Draco’s shoulder and pulling him in for a hug. It was so quick that Draco didn’t even get a chance to hug back before Harry let go and started excitedly bouncing on his toes. The concrete path to the house was now visible, but was still covered in overgrowth from the lawn.
It was over and one quick look at Draco’s face made Harry panic. He ran his hand through his hair a grand total of four times just in the thirty second silence that followed their kiss. His eyes darted from Draco to the gate behind him and back again. He eventually stepped closer and grabbed Draco’s wrist.
“These look quite delicious,” Draco said politely, shooting Potter a small smile. “Thank you for letting me place the order.”
After nearly a half hour, Draco set two plates on the table, one in front of Harry. Harry responded by laying down his book and smiling gratefully up at Draco. “Thanks.” Draco stood for a moment longer, staring at Harry’s face and seemed to be considering something. He finally leaned down and pressed a light kiss to Harry’s cheek before sitting in front of his own plate.
Harry laughed as he reached for the canister, slightly embarrassed. He twisted open the cap and took a whiff, fully expecting it to be a slightly rancid smell like he’d known bubotuber pus to be. Instead, he got a very pleasant mix of citrus and floral scents that didn’t burn his nostrils like he’d thought it would.
He wordlessly handed her the glowing deed, deeply wishing that if he leaned back far enough, the couch would swallow him whole. Hermione scanned the page quickly before her eyes shot up to his and she sank down on the sofa next to him. “Oh, Harry…” Her hand reached out to grip his forearm, nothing more than a comforting gesture that he appreciated. “Did you go see it?”
“Usually only me,” Potter replied, pulling out a folder and slipping the order form in. “There’s not a big audience most of the time.”
“Are you sure he… er, won’t come after me when he finds out you’re not destined to marry the pureblood woman they’ve chosen for you?”
“Says the man who had twice the pints as me and even stole my last one,” Draco quipped, turning his hand so they could press their palms together. They strode out of the Leaky, leaving behind a few galleons for the barkeep, and towards Gringott’s. Draco casually let go of Harry’s hand, only to have the green-eyed wizard link arms with him.
Harry spelled a large circle of dust away and sat heavily on the floor, leaning forward to pour the tea. Hermione and Ron joined him and drank in silence. The biscuits came and went as did his thoughts. He wondered how much effort it would take to redo the place, as it clearly has seen enough destruction that even ancient household magic couldn’t fix it as soon as Harry walked in the door. And it did not go unnoticed by Harry that all the damage could not possibly be simply because of a lack of dusting. Something happened there. And Bippy was the key.
