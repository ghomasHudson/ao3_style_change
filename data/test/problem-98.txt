, you know," he said smugly. "And I know perfectly well the... depth... of the requirements to successfully bind someone else to your protection."
Mrs. Weasley definitely shared Harry's over-enthusiasm that morning, and their breakfast gave the impression that something was definitely being celebrated, albeit implicitly. Harry didn't mind. He was still on a high, and he went through his sausages still with a huge smile on his face.
They were in the midst of a story based on one of the Weird Sisters' songs about a dancing hippogriff when Harry heard the Floo alarm from downstairs. Excusing himself (and leaving Teddy to conscientiously continue reading where they had left off), he leapt back to the lower level, all the while wondering what the call could be about. Long weekends were usually unbothered, especially this particular one when everyone was away and busy.
"Hey, mate," Harry said, trying to sound casual. "I'm feeling a bit knackered stuck in this office. It's almost 5 already anyway, we can literally just walk out already. In fact, I think I need a pint. Or six. Fancy coming with?"
The house itself seemed awfully familiar, though he couldn't for the life of him think when he could have gotten a glimpse of Potter's home before.
"That we would eventually be dating other people?"
"Merlin, Hermione!" Draco's eyes were wide. "I'm not sure if you were told by the Healers, but mental stress for wizards are a more serious matter than it probably is for Muggles!"
Draco found his mother in her chambers.
He knew that Hermione had done all she could to help him, and at such short notice, at that. But he couldn't help but grasp at the splinters of doubt that told him it was all mistaken, that the muggle methods had failed to provide any real information.
Draco actually barked out a laugh. "Sorry, it's just that even in my head, I have a hard time calling you by your first name."
There he was, bloody war hero, saying nice things about the Malfoys to the Wizengamot. Narcissa remained still while he gave his testimony, but Draco shamelessly dropped his jaw, unable to hide his shock at what Potter had said. He learned about his mother's dangerous game of lying to the Dark Lord in the Forbidden Forest, which she had chosen to omit in her own testimony, merely saying that she thought him dead. Now, to hear that she had risked her life by protecting Harry, in order to get safely to her son.. well, Draco had to admit his respect for his mother definitely shot up.
"No, no," Astoria cut her off. "I was talking with-" she stopped herself, which made Draco wonder.
"Please," Harry insisted somewhat desperately, "do everything that you can... just... just keep them safe." He turned back to Ginny, shifting his hold on her so that he could embrace her. "Stay safe, Gin. I'll have to be away from you but you know I'll do anything to get to your side if need be."
Which was why Draco found it troubling that she had sought him out now.
"It was alright," she said brightly, "I was able to play Chaser in three mock games, and they usually only rotate you once."
"Sorry?"
James was slapping his fisted hands on the top of his high chair, so Ginny took his wrists and gently admonished him until the baby relented and put his attention elsewhere. No one around them batted an eyelash. Today, Harry had decided to make the three of them unrecognizable to anyone, so that they could have a lunch out together as a family without any pressure. No one in the wizarding world even knew about James, so the three of them were just an average picture of a happy family dining out.
There, so blatant and obvious, displayed obscenely in front of them, was a mind map that was so clearly influenced by a certain substance called Persephone's Poison.
"What's so amusing?" he finally asked, curious.
"Wha-" Draco tried to catch up to everything he was being told. Was it a trick? To Confund him? Surely Harry and Ron had been tailing the right person…
Ron had rolled his eyes good-naturedly after reading his missive, while Harry kept reading his own again and again. He realized that Malfoy had written him a slightly different letter than Ron's.
But now that reality had sunken in, Draco finally felt what it really meant to have the kind of presence in someone's life wherein you mattered much more than what you could offer to an alliance. Just the constant check ins from Hermione and Pansy, as well as the occasional call from Weasley or Blaise were enough reminders to Draco that he would always have others behind him, people who would never abandon him.
Hi, everyone! So this is the start of my first Drarry Fanfic ever, and I'm hoping some of you will like it as much as I have loved other awesome works here on Ao3  :) You should know that the entire plot is already laid out and complete, so I will be updating by chapter every week or every two weeks :) Enjoy!
Draco ground his teeth in frustration. How did she even come up with such conclusions? "Mother," he managed to force out as calmly as he could. "I did as you asked. I admitted that you were right. I am addressing my shortcomings as a husband. Now, you are going the complete opposite direction with your reasoning? Forgive me if I cannot take you so seriously."
"This from Tracking?" the redhead asked without looking at Ella, not that he waited for her to answer anyway. He lay down the papers and leaned back, rubbing his eyes.
Ron nodded but continued to choke on his words. "I just thought, y'know? I thought I'd ask tonight, i-it felt right to me, y'know?"
"Okay," said Harry, "I'll keep an open mind about that, but I can't deny that I'm not curious. You have to understand," he said imploringly, "I really didn't mean to be rude or whatever, it's just very different from what I've grown up with."
"Hours and hours."
"Thanks," he muttered. "Er, would you like anything? A drink?"
Harry gulped. "Oh Merlin…
"They is at the Family Sitting Room, sir," the elf replied.
And this counted as pretty bad.
The only odd thing that had marred an otherwise successful venture happened the day after their fifth event.
"Don't you talk to me that way, Harry Potter!" she said, matching his tone. "You know I've been doing my best to do both, and it's fucking tiring but I accept that it's something I'll have to do-"
Draco nodded, knowing full well that being an Auror was really a full-time job, and he was glad that he was a consultant. At least he had more control of his work hours.
Malfoy never judged him. He kept his tongue sharp and his wits even sharper, but Harry could now appreciate that it all was part and parcel of his entire personality. And it was entertaining anyway. If he had spent this time with Ron or Hermione, they would have smothered him to an early death with all the coddling and over-involvement. His words would always be taken literally, or taken too seriously. Ron understood dark humor sometimes, but Hermione had always insisted that her husband was 'enabling' Harry's self-deprecating moods, and therefore not helping. In contrast, Harry could rely on Malfoy's bittersweet perspective on their life as war survivors from opposite ends of the battle. He could depend on him to call him out of his dark moods without sounding like a nagging, coddling mother hen.
"Yes, I did. I held two posts then, one full time and the other a freelance consultancy. I managed alright, but I did get an earful from Harry..."
. We’ve got other things to deal with immediately, anyway. And to answer your question, I think this house is big enough for the both of us, and then some."
Malfoy laughed. "Is that what you call it then?"
Weasley shook his head in apparent annoyance. "Yeah, apparently to keep a record of ability to do our job. Load of rubbish. It even includes any others pulled in for the recent year's special cases. It's given everyone in the Auror Corps a headache. Who wants to have to go in and get their mind investigated? I mean, sure it's a short cut version of Harry's full mind mapping process for real criminal investigations, but seriously. Do they expect us all to be happy that we're being spied on?"
It didn't take much for Draco to note the somber expression on Potter's face, or the sad droop of his smile, or the steely sharpness in his green eyes. "Come through," he said without hesitation.
Molly seemed to see that they had come to the same conclusions. "You see, Harry," she said. "My daughter knows what she wants, and how to reach it, but she also understands herself to know how to make it her source of happiness, of achievement. I'm afraid," and she dropped her voice to a whisper here, "I'm afraid that Hermione is pushing herself too hard for all the wrong reasons, and it's poisoning everything and everyone around her. I believe she knows what she wants... but she's not sure why she wants it, or why it isn't making her as happy as she'd thought..."
"Now this," Harry sighed. "Are we ready for another kid, Gin?"
Draco and Narcissa looked surprised. It looked like everyone else was too, as they all thought the last witness (biased, of course) had already been cross examined. Then the biggest shock of his life hit him like a well-aimed Confundus.
"What do you mean - the Dark Lord's memories?"
"Harryyyyyyyy!" the little boy cried out, running to him. Harry instinctively took him up in his arms. "Quick, Gran is right behind me! She says it's a 'mergency-"
"Then…" Harry mentally went through everything he and Ron had just brought up. "If they're one and the same, then we would be right in assuming that the person wants Astoria, and therefore wants to get rid of Draco."
Hermione was at a loss for words. "I just meant - I mean, at least James has you, and she comes to stay with you, right?"
Sure enough, Kingsley gave a curt nod, schooled his features into what Harry called his 'official face', and addressed the assembly in his deep, booming voice.
Harry sighed. The notions of blood purity and clashing cultures had never really bothered him so much. In fact, his private musings had only emerged after his reluctant association with Malfoy had begun. Having grown up from his rather limited perspective in the magical community, Harry was only now seeing the fundamental differences between traditional and modern, pureblood and otherwise.
"She has been acting different after Scorpius' birth," Narcissa pondered. "Perhaps she was not ready for this stage in your life?"
: (laughs) I take it that wasn't a serious question?
The shock on Harry's face took five seconds to synchronize with the shock on his brain. When it did, he shook his head. He hadn't expected her to make this grand gesture so suddenly, after all the arguments they had had over the years. "You'll stay more often?" he asked tentatively.
, Draco mused with a little smile. He wouldn't admit it to either Potter or Weasley, but a part of him greatly missed the challenge of working with the MMI. Sure, he was now better acquainted with his old enemies, and secured a higher position (albeit highly secret) in the DOM, but he realized that nothing could ever replace the rush of adrenaline as they put their heads together and raced against time to save lives. Having constant correspondence with Potter wasn't as bad as he had thought, either.
"No need to feel shy about it, Potter," he said gently. Then he remembered himself and went back to the usual Malfoy-speak in an effort to get to Potter better. "You merely require ample distraction," he started haughtily, "I'm sure if you asked any of the mediwitches here, they'd regale you with the wonderful story of my absolute calm and level-headedness during Scorpius' birth."
"They're fine," Draco replied. "The Fidelius makes it a bit difficult for Astoria to conduct her social life as normally as mine, but she's making do. Being threatened can do that to you."
"Well?" Ginny asked, looking concerned at all the conjured colored swirls floating in the air that were apparently signs of her health, and of the baby's condition.
, he thought as he strode towards his study.
"It was just a very good night, Mother," he said, suddenly wanting to reassure her while also staying true to his word to Potter. "Highly unexpected, and absolutely unbelievable as it was improbable, but I believe Potter and I have agreed to disregard our past discord and develop our professional and personal relations."
"She'll be fine, Harry," Hermione assured him. "I asked Helen about the magical theory behind the spells they're casting, and she said that it really takes this long to properly invoke the magic they need to safely sever the cores of Ginny and the baby."
meant that he was above acquaintance? He knew about James, for Merlin's sake.
"Yes!" Harry slapped himself on the head. "It was stupid of me to forget to mention it!:"
"Draco," he enunciated, tasting the foreign name on his tongue. "Draco, Draco, Draco."
The witch released him from her death grip and punched him on the arm. Ron walked into the kitchen, sniffing. "Is that Harry's Shepherd's Pie?" he asked enthusiastically.
"I haven't," Harry said, his attention focused more on the coffee than the conversation at hand. He still liked it done the Muggle way. "I've only ever written to my cousin, but that's pretty much it. I meant before Hogwarts."
Harry shrugged one shoulder, turning away from the pan and beginning to make coffee. "I got enough practice, seeing as I cooked every meal for my Muggle family."
"Me, name my child?" The very idea was so ludicrous to Draco. "Oh, I see, you're not familiar with this particular tradition either, are you?"
Harry knew that she was already questioning so many facts - first of which was why in the hell would Malfoy ever be in their sitting room close to midnight?
Also, now I can put a new Author's Note to say that the Present picks up from Chapter 9, just so future readers know what to expect :) Thanks again for reading, and hope you enjoy :)

"Stay only within the Ministry. At least you can be protected there while you are away."
"Your mother?" Potter seemed to be confused. "Why not you?"
One of my readers, Jack_Dawkins, asked about details regarding the nature of contraception in the story, and it made me realize that I hadn't thought to include that (for fear of putting too much technical details into a story).
"That's actually a pretty good idea," said Ron. Harry knew his best mate was the best strategist in the entire Corps, so he was pretty sure the redhead's gears were already turning since the first time he mentioned the case to him. "If we make sure that Malfoy doesn't act suspicious or threatened in the public eye, the suspect might be frustrated and continue his harassment."
"I will owl Lady Greengrass immediately," she finally said. "Perhaps this match is what we have been waiting for."
Harry was shocked. He hadn't expected such a reaction from Malfoy.
, and he knew that only a handful of people were allowed. He realized that he hadn't been able to open up to anyone else aside from Blaise and Pansy, and that doing so with Potter had been so easy.
"Ron!" he exclaimed out of concern. He looked terrible, and the sudden call must have meant that there was a big problem.
Harry thought back to the time last year, when he and Ron had met Malfoy at Viridian the first time. Despite the bindings around them, the blond had, in fact, been able to notice them after Ron's outburst. To be fair, Harry had ensured that the
"I aim to please," was the reply.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well that wasn't too hard," Hermione said, trying to lighten the mood. This time, she waved her own wand and threw the second batch of shimmery powder into the flames. "Draco Malfoy!" she announced clearly.
Signs? Draco was confused. As far as he knew, he and his wife had had a great relationship since they had begun courting. They were about to have their first child. Nothing was amiss, and everything was playing out to his ultimate designs. Well, except for the unlikely friendship with Potter. But that was neither here nor there.
"It's too much trouble, Potter," Malfoy sighed. "It's not worth it, I assure you."
"Harry, dear," she whispered, eager to keep Hugo sleeping in peace. "Andromeda Floo'd me just last night, asking if either of us could watch Teddy for a couple of days.
"Let's go back to the beginning, shall we?" His captor pretended to think deeply while tapping a finger on his chin. "It didn't start with the first letter of course. Oh no, it was way back. You see, we'd met several times before."
"No cake for you, then."
Ginny immediately held her hands up in defense. "No!" she cried. "No I'm not! But about where the kids stay… I think it's better for them to stay in one home until they're much older and can understand our family situation…"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I - I didn't-" Hermione stammered. "The Healers just told me to stay home, bed rest and everything, but they never really explained why."
She glowed at his praise. "I've always known," she replied with an air of amusement, before pushing her son forwards while keeping the rest of their private conversation out of earshot.
"Harry's new status, of course!" Percy said exasperatedly. "Honestly, Ron, how thick can you get? Harry here is the number one Hero and recognized in all magical communities around the world, he's one of the reasons some gossip rags are even running despite the trash they print, and suddenly he's called up the invocation that will prevent outsiders,
As promised, Hermione's friend had come through and promptly sent out the results of the so-called DNA test. Draco couldn't think of a more nerve-wracking day, as he was feeling both highly relieved and severely anxious at the same time.
He missed the rooftop of his flat, but he didn't think he had the courage to go back there just yet.
"I did, of course. Didn't need changing. And he wasn't hungry either when I tried to give him his bottle." She carefully handed the baby to Harry, who automatically tucked him onto his side.
"Sorry," Harry said meekly. "Er, please continue."
"Not really, no. Mostly we fought about our differing priorities. I'm not the kind of person to leave my work behind when I know that it's within my capabilities to excel. Being offered the position of Legal consultant to the Minister in addition to my job at the Ministry was a prize that I felt I had earned. I never saw it as a burden."
"Harry?" Ron asked worriedly.
Hermione looked back and forth between her husband and best friend. She couldn't help it, she was interested in their tricky cases because she felt that it gave her grey matter some exercise. "You have no idea what the ingredients are?" she asked Harry. It sounded dubious that the top Aurors couldn't even identify a list of ingredients.
Neither was expecting much fanfare that morning, which was why both Harry and Draco were startled to consciousness by the shrill yell from someone running down the stairs.
"I'd like to cover all bases."
"Evening, Potter," he greeted casually. "Auror business?"
How Draco Malfoy could ever provide such a solid sense emotional comfort, no one would ever know. But Harry had learned never to question it - gift horse and all that jazz. They still spent around ninety percent of their time together just on competitive and insulting banter, and they both thrived in it. It was really part of who they were.
"I hate this," the Auror whispered, which to Draco sounded as if he were admitting defeat. "I hate just...just sitting here, not knowing whatever's going on... I hate being useless, unable to even do anything..."
Could he have been holding onto something invisible? That would explain why he could hold the position for so long.
"Exactly!" Ginny said, and the crack in her voice suddenly made it clear to Harry that she was crying. He was immediately by her side, hands on her shoulders."
"Er, yeah," Harry said, turning beet red. "Those have been more... controlled."
"That is Potter's department, yes?" the woman asked.
"As Kingsley Shacklebolt, and not as the Minister," Kingsley continued, and Harry detected a change in his tone. "As myself, I personally witnessed the many hardships that Mr. Potter underwent to secure the safety and freedom of the wizarding community. I was his comrade within the Order of the Phoenix. I knew him when a great responsibility was thrust upon him, at such a young age, and he took it upon himself to see it through to the end. In only a few years, he had no choice to become the selfless man that he has become, and he was never the dangerous, careless, misguided child that many were inclined to believe with so much conviction." Harry finally realized the strange new tone the Minister used – it was a voice full of sincere affection. He immediately felt a rush of gratitude for the man.
It was Harry who broke the silence. His voice had changed. His demeanor had reduced to that of a huddled old man, full of tired resignation. "I don't know what we're doing here, Ginny," he said morosely, staring at the floor. "Is this-do you even want this? Do you even want to be with me? What have we been doing wrong, Gin? Why aren't we working it out?"
"Alright. Goodbye... Draco."
He stared at the tiny figure in Ginny's arms, focused on the gentle curves of the face, lingered on the dark tufts of hair, touched a finger to the tiny little balled up fists.
Harry thought about that. "So, if one were really a vampire...?"
"What, Ginny? What?" Harry demanded. "I don't know about you, but I didn't envision my future to include two children who barely see their mum because she's off representing the country. Oh, I'm sure they'll be proud of you," he added when her expression turned hard, "but honestly, is that the future you saw for yourself? To have kids and be away from them most of the time?"
Draco didn't realize that he had his eyes closed while trying to think of the right words to say. Which was why he was surprised when he felt Potter's hand on his shoulder. He hadn't heard the man move, probably thanks to his Auror stealth skills.
"Okay, what stipulations do you keep mentioning?" Harry asked them both. "Muggle-raised wizard, here."
"The contracts depend on magic. Before a marriage, the families can cancel betrothal contracts at any time. Traditionally though, a child changes things, because breaking a contract can mess up a lot things for the heirs and their hierarchy."
Harry's breath seemed to stop flowing. He was too shocked by what they had just uncovered by chance. It was something, a bigger picture, that only the most trained could process at a glance. Of course Harry and Ron were right at the top of that list - they had invented the process after all. That made it feel even worse.
That was it. He wanted structure in his life, because he hadn't had a drop of it in his entire existence. He didn't think his stay at the Dursley's was bad enough, because he had a daily routine and he stuck to it. He liked his job because it gave him a list of things to do, and at the end of the day he got to cross all of it out and go to bed and start again in the morning. Perhaps the Auror career was a bit more exhausting, but for now it had served its purposes. Going on a consultancy felt like being lazy to him. It was giving up responsibility, it was going back to being lost and pretty much useless.
Narcissa's smile warmed even more, and she eagerly put down her watering can and pulled her son out of the room and towards her wing.
Ginny sat up in a panic,. "Ohhhh,
Draco couldn't help but snort in amusement as he threw a handful of powder into the fire and watched the flames turn green.
"I want to stay here. With you."
get one thing he wanted for himself.
Ginny just gave him a huge grin. "Don't' underestimate me, Harry, I can handle anything."
The beautiful couple, who will continue to reside in the family Manor at Wiltshire, have had an unusual history, which had all eyes on them since the announcement of their courtship in 2000. Their curiously long engagement, which is not expected or practiced within traditional wizarding families, drew in the interest of the public. With both being part of the Sacred Twenty Eight (which of course, is considered now as nothing more than an outdated chapter of wizarding history), their highly publicized story has become the model of the successful renaissance of the old Pureblood customs in today's restructured society.
"Well?" Harry prompted again. He was slightly nervous since her opinion mattered very much to him. Getting his own place had been a priority, since he didn't fancy living alone just yet in Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. When he and Ginny had kids, maybe then they would probably use that as the family home. For now, however, Harry was ecstatic to have a place to call his own.
Then he realized that the Potter he knew at school hated attention. He hated when people gave him any notice, and he hated when everything he did was reported to the rest of the world. Of course, back at Hogwarts, Draco had no idea, but the acquaintance he kept with Potter over the years was sufficient to break his school-time assumptions about the Golden Boy. And he probably guessed right that Potter would have wanted to keep his Golden Babies away from such attention.
"No," Draco said, shaking his head. "I always called Potter an idiot, but we're talking about Auror Potter here. He's not about to randomly owl a man he'd met for drinks one time, a year ago, and write him a letter that makes absolutely no logical sense. He's not that stupid. That's got to be it. They need my help and can't ask properly without being suspicious."
She had explained to Harry via that first Floo call that she had been feeling sick and nauseous for a at least a couple weeks, and had seen a Healer in Montreal for food poisoning. She had invoked her privacy wards as had become habit for her and Harry, but since her wards apparently failed, she was seen finally walking out of the Maternity department of the local healing center. It explained her harrassed look, trying to get away from the reporters and photographers. Harry had explained to her later on why her wards might have failed, which only made her feel worse.
Draco laughed as well. He knew exactly what he meant. "One thing you got right, Potter."
Draco could practically feel the waves of anxiety radiating from his mother. He shook his head in response, trying not to disturb the boy still clutched to his chest. "As many enemies as we used to have after the war, most if not all have been locked away in Azkaban, and the rest have followed suit with the wizarding public and accepted us with the respect we have rightfully earned when we rehabilitated the Malfoy name." He turned to his wife in question.
"D'you think - that this is too weird?" Harry blurted out.
And he still meant it when he finally left after the weekend, having spent two and a half days in the company of the Chosen One.
"She's your sister!" Hermione cried, turning on her husband. "You know perfectly well that she's always wanted to be in the big leagues, how can you take it against her?"
He knew nothing of Kingsley Shacklebolt, except that he had been an Auror, as well as stuck to Potter like glue. The man would have become a Muggle for Potter. But he was also a formidable person, and someone you wouldn't like to oppose. He was actually the best kind of wizard to become the Minister for Magic. Facing him one on one would be unnerving, Draco was sure. But he had been raised to withstand immense amounts of pressure without breaking a sweat, so he dutifully answered the summons, left a note for his mother, and Flooed straight into the Atrium of the Ministry of Magic.
"It's not what you think," he finally said, taking a deep breath. "I mean, you were right about Teddy, but- but there's something else. I wasn't exactly prepared for this but..."
Harry nodded absently, worrying the tip of his quill with his teeth. He was trying to put things together in his head, as was his habit. Ron was more about taking down notes, something Hermione had pretty much trained him to do.
"Hang on. So..." Potter's brows came together as a show of his intellectual capacity. Obviously very little. "So your parents didn't name you?"
"It sounds stupid when you first read it," he said. "But when I went through it again, well, here-"
This time, Draco felt ashamed. "I'm here, though," he said, trying not to sound too disappointed in case Harry decided to kick him out or something. "Don't mean to intrude or anything…"
Draco sighed. "The Tonks family still has no idea, do they?"
"Er, thanks, Potter," Draco murmured behind his cup, relishing the feeling of having something familiar after a night full of shock and surprises.
"James doesn't like it when it's all stuffy," Harry explained.
Harry laughed. "We're not going anywhere, little man, I'm just going up to change his nappies!"
"He's serious?!"
Harry snorted. "I just think it's time we've grown up."
"At least you have one to practice with," Harry joked. "I've already got two, and twice the pressure to be the perfect dad. Which I highly doubt, to be honest. Not for lack of trying, though."
Harry huffed quietly. Winning the war had been great, but now he and the rest of the members of the DA were stuck in some godforsaken tour around the country for the rest of the year
Narcissa hummed while watering the plants in her Tea room, obviously in high spirits. Astoria lounged leisurely on one of the settees, while Draco watched his mother with growing curiosity.
"Speaking of which, holy Merlin, it's late!" Draco suddenly said, setting down his empty glass and walking gracefully towards the fire. "Thank you for having me over. I know it's a bit of a rush, but we really mustn't make it a habit to stay over too long." He smiled warmly at Harry, which made the latter flush slightly. "I'll tell Mother and Astoria about the updates and get back to you. Or the team. Whoever will be available."
Ginny cozied up to him enthusiastically and let him pull her away from her overbearing mother. "You have great timing, Mr. Potter," she said with a big smile, melting in his arms.
Ginny shrugged. "A long engagement isn't that big of a deal in our family anyway. Not like in traditional pureblood families where they basically sell you off to the family with the best assets."
"Within?!" Harry repeated skeptically, exchanging a significant look with Ron. The redhead frowned. "How is that possible?"
and have it mess up."
"Well, what?" he asked impatiently.
Draco nodded at him gratefully before disappearing up the stairwell. Harry let out a soft laugh of amusement at seeing his friend being pushed around by a little kid. With a wordless spell, he urged on the floating bassinet carefully to settle the sleeping baby with his sons. He renewed the Monitoring charms in the room and checked in with Kreacher, before turning back towards Teddy's room.
"How's the trail on Howe?" Draco inquired. "Are you getting closer to apprehending him?"
"What else must be done?" Narcissa asked impassively. "The three of us have provided our blood and a reading of our magical aura. You have also taken the same from Scorpius," she said, gesturing towards her sleeping grandson.
"The South East Asian and Austronesian delegates."
Potter snorted. "Officially, they say it's to ensure that the Auror Corps are mentally fit for duty and maximized to the fullest of our abilities. Unofficially, it's just another way for them to keep us in control."
The blond smiled, which made something stir in the depths of Harry's stomach. He ignored it.
“Just enter boy, I can’t wait all night.”
Harry nodded, his fingers grazing Draco’s, slowly intertwining, “But you are lonely. I know that. I know how that feels. To have thousands of people around you, to have a family, and still feel so lonely. Like you might as well be alone with how suffocating it feels to be around them. You are being fed wrong. You have what you want, but not what you need.”
If you came here through notifications, or whatever, this is the second chapter I post in less than 10 minutes. Make sure you've read chapter 8.
It took two hours and two fights between Ron and Ginny about whether they should go back or not when finally Mr. Weasley arrived to pick them up. It took twenty more minutes before Harry realized he was wand-less. Mr. Weasley prohibited them from searching for it, sending Harry home with the rest of the Weasleys too early and without a say in the matter. It was hours later when Arthur arrived with his wand and a tired looking expression.
Harry only had a quick glance -to not make it obvious he was looking for him- at Malfoy to see that though he did have his cloak, but he wasn’t wearing it, if the redness on his nose, lips, and the tip of his fingertips were any evidence.
I wanted to address how stupid it was that Harry, who already had a pretty traumatizing childhood, would then pursue a triggering career. I believe that dumb Harry would not seek the mental help he needs and Draco would pay the price. And... I hinted about it a few times before if you guys are interested in doing re-reads.
I apologize for the delay... I graduated! I finished my huge year long senior project. I have not had even a semblance of closure due to my graduating being cancelled and us graduates not even having been acknowledge in any way, 5 years of college for this, but hey. It's over. I can now dedicate some time to mindless work and fun hobbies like writing and drawing.
Draco looked down, seeing both of his own wrists in Harry’s hand, no name visible. Two names visible. Draco shook his head, “Tom Riddle?” Draco looked up to see Harry staring at him, “And you made the bold assumption that I’m your soulmate? What if it’s this Tom guy?”
“But we’re sneaky about it. You find out afterwards. Not before the ruling!”
Another chuckle escaped him and he shook his head, “I don’t want to laugh tonight. I want to address some very serious matters.”
Ron nodded, catching up and realizing the picture did not look good, regardless of how happy Hermione was to have at least gotten the picture, “But if he’s your soulmate, and Lu- Lefty Senior is with You-Know-Who, you being Lefty’s soulmate is… basically the most inconvenient thing for him.”
“I… get it. I will be careful to not do anything to him that I wouldn’t want done to me.”
“They already do Pansy. This changes nothing, they just hate him more-”
“I’m not about to go tell anyone if that’s what you’re worried about, but…” Ron groaned, leaning against the door, “Fuck mate, it was easier to hate him when I didn’t know this.”
He turned to look at Ron who was now staring at Draco, analyzing him, and then muttered under his breath, “... It is odd… his behavior. You would think he would be bragging, or… I don’t know, be annoying like he always is when he’s trying to get your atten- Oh! That’s what he’s doing… It’s still a dumb way to do it, I mean-”
Ron nodded, patronizing Harry, before standing up and dusting off his pajama bottoms, “Do I want to hear about it?”
By supper the student body was confused. Or better said, disappointed. They were expecting a good fight, with the way Draco and Harry had been glancing at each other all day, but all they got was two huffs from Ron and Draco and a shrug from Harry. But definitely better than them thinking that there was some romantic tension between the blond and the brunette. They would be right, but Harry didn’t want them to be.
“And it doesn’t bother you?”
Ron and Hermione looked confused, before Harry shoved his left wrist towards them and a look of horror replaced confusion.
“Be a bit more specific. Anything. Just talk to me about one of your worries and maybe I can help you … get rid of it.”
Harry nodded and she shrugged, “Don’t worry. I don’t care about the rumours. They are better than the ones that came from accepting being your date, which included me sleeping my way to the top and betraying Luna. This is better and funnier.”
Ron bit his lip, nodding before quietly adding, “You do remember that name he’s called you, right?”
Ron sighed and whispered, “Try and sleep.”
Harry took three quick bites and left, not saying anything to Ron or Hermione, just looking in his bag for the Marauders map.
Harry blinked, confused at where that question came from. But to be fair, he had been curious for a while about whether or not he had damaged this relationship for good. So when Draco turned to look at him, he pretended that was what he intended to ask from the beginning.
Harry did everything to not smirk, finally finding the question to break him. He was impressed with his poker face skills.
Ron smiled brightly, “That’s good!- That’s good right? It’s reciprocated?”
“Can you tell me why?”
2. I'm currently writing two fics, this one and an unnamed Reylo fic (Can you tell what kind of couples I ship?), while also doing some graphic design work for my mom, while also learning how to web design, while also doing acrylic paintings (practicing), while also painting the new rooms in the house, while also sparking up my imagination by building an entire village in minecraft, while also indulging in extra sleep because I don't have a real job... so you can see why it takes a while. I might have a mild case of ADHD...
Ron sighed and shook his head, “I’m not looking for any excuse to drop him, but anyone who’s ashamed to be seen in public with you is not good for you-”
Harry turned to where Malfoy had been staring at to find Lucius Malfoy, glaring at him, looking disgusted by Harry’s mere presence. And that’s when he realized how close to Malfoy he was standing. He moved away.
This chapter is a bit of a roller coaster, so I hope you're ready for the loops.
“You dismissed the conversation and pretended to go back to paying attention to class.”
Harry wanted to punch Ron, and then go on to punch those surrounded Draco. Harry shook his head.
He didn’t want to lose them.
Harry sighed, going back to his hunt. Maybe he should wait for Hermione.
“No.”
Ron huffed at Hermione, “Do we even know what would happen if we put our name-”
Walking out of class he found himself trying to focus on the loud banter of every student in the midst of class change, and ignore the loud whispers from Ron and Hermione who were trying to save what was left of his dignity.
… “I feel like the murder of your parents is enough trauma to create vivid memories, regardless of age.”
“What do you mean?” Harry whispered.
“Was it supposed to?”
Soon the Weasleys were going to pick him up to take him to the Quidditch World Cup, and he would be able to rid himself of one of the bandages. The only one they knew about.
“Oh, you’re a fucking idiot!” Hermione sat up and rested on her knees on top of the bed, fist clenching her skirt as though that was the only thing holding her back from pouncing on Harry and punching some sense into him.
It was faint, it was blurry, it was long over, but he could hear it. The last moments of his parent's life, the green glow, the ruined nursery. Harry should’ve listened to his gut.
But Harry hated knowing he might be the reason why.
(wow, she did that.)  Yes...
Harry was not so prideful as to deny that Hermione and Ron were basically his impulse control. But they weren’t there right now. And so when he noticed he lacked impulse control as he quietly followed the Malfoys a good distance away, he started digging for something else inside of him that would stop him from doing whatever he planned on doing.
“He should be waking up soon, when he does inform him that he’s been dismissed of both classes and here and that I expect him back here next year when quidditch starts up again. And not sooner.”
Ron seemed unsure, but Hermione piped in, “Put one for me too, for the work I’m putting in as your matchmaker.”
She mulled over it, looking divided between joining the school party and something else. Finally she sighed, “I already made plans with Luna.”
He took a few bites of food, picked up his invisibility cloak and the map and left the dorm, needing space for the million thoughts racing through his head. Now awake Harry wondered once again if it was real, or if he just had a very active imagination. And halfway to the Astronomy Tower he remembered the second question. When did I ask you to the Yule ball? How did it go like? When did Lucius beat you?
“What are the odds even that anyone from our house is chosen? Maybe it will be a Hufflepuff. I’ll put my chips on a Hufflepuff.”
“I won’t ask how you found me. How you knew I was here.”
Harry had never been one to wear jewelry, accessories weren’t his thing.
“Why are you so desperate to gain my trust? You’ve hated me for years-”
An hour of silence let Harry’s mind wander and come up with answers as to why Draco’s lip is bruised, and out of the million probably reasons he came up with, his guilt kept pushing one to the front lines, “Someone saw us while we were talking outside of the dungeons, right?”
“What?! She’s the- What!?”
ENJOY!!
I'm finally back. And I'm gonna finish this.
Ron woke Harry up an hour before class with a few questions regarding his sleep, most of which Harry could not answer because he could not recall when he fell asleep, if he slept, or if he dreamt. It felt like Harry blinked and it was morning. But Harry did not feel rested.
“Hogwarts: A History?”
“Why don’t you ever show your wrists?”
Harry nodded, looking at Draco, watching how the shadows moved on his face, “I don’t think we’re going there with or without greed.”
Draco looked down at his left wrist, and Harry smiled, knowing he deserved it, “You hide one of yours.”
“Your father beating you is a big deal, Draco.” Draco glared at him, “Malfoy?” Draco nodded, and Harry sighed, “I can make sure she keeps it under wraps. Only those that need to know get to know.” He smiled at Draco, “Need-to-know basis until the Yule Ball?”
“Stop… saying nice things.”
Draco sighed, shaking the pain away and looking out into the night sky. “You still have mood swings.” Harry nodded, hoping that that was the real answer.
Ron shook his head, “Harry is not a th-”
“I trust her.” Ron smirked, happy with his security blanket.
Harry sighed, staying quiet for a few minutes as he figured out something that both he and Ron could understand, “So err… Left?” He said pointing at the left arm no one else would be able to see, “Left, err… on the day that I passed out I uh, I left early to try and find something to keep me awake-”
Draco looked confused but open to talk, “The task? The dragon was a million times bigger than you, so you often were out of sight. No one could see you. And it felt like that would be it, but then you’d emerge. And the Slytherins would boo-”
“... Why are you telling me this?”
And that’s why he was out, in the middle of the night, taking a walk on the bottom floor.
Ron didn’t say anything more, looking almost like Hermione when she was struggling to solve something, and motioned for he and Harry to go to the box. Their problem was solved, their new silence had to do with something else.
Imagine meeting them and it all going wrong.
Ron handed him the bundle, “And Mione told me to get your clothes, just in case.”
Ron looked a bit proud as he turned to Hermione and announced, “I figured out why Harry’s so stingy about Malfoy.”
Draco didn’t reply, but the way his eyes looked at the ground, shame filling them…
And don’t get him wrong, is not that he’s ashamed. Is just that after the very traumatizing experience with the Dursleys, Harry was scared of how the Weasleys would react to there being a guy on his other wrist, much more who it was.
Basically Harry wanted to know if there was a way to change that. What if he delayed him asking. What if Harry asked differently.
Harry turned to Draco, confused but tamed enough to be reluctant about asking, “Why is that not in Hogwarts: A History?”
Ron raised a hand with an amused look on his face, “You’re going to come a little strong if you drop all of that on them. Also,” Ron turned to Harry and shrugged, “We have DADA today. We get to meet… the new teacher.”
“Lucius would keep him hostage just to hurt you and manipulate you.”
“He was being a prick!”
It’s probably that he’s tired the reason for him finding Ron’s caring whispered voice irritating, “Awake because my life sucks and soon I’ll have to compete in some deadly competition and deatheaters are back, so maybe Voldemort is back and I don’t know how that will affect other aspects of my life and whenever I do fall to happy slumber someone interrupts it.”
He once again wondered why he’d name his son after him in the future. “He knew.”
Hermione rolled her eyes, “I still don’t know what spell or charm Dumbledore used on the goblet, and we can’t cheat our way into a tournament we’re already in. You meant ‘through this tournament’.”
But someone had hit Malfoy. Malfoy’s face. And Harry had never felt rage like this.
Harry paused, “You think he’s telling Lucius?”
Harry pushed Draco’s hands out of sight, emphasizing again how much he was willing to respect his privacy, however ridiculous it may be at this point, and leaned forward, his nose grazing the nervous boy in front of him, “I will not waste time with little words with big meaning. They scare me as much as they scare you, to know that that could be a reality, that someone could feel that for me, for you. Feeling worthless and having someone remind you that you’re not…” Harry nodded, “It feels wrong. I understand that. But I beg of you to give me an opportunity to show you that-” Harry shook his head, looking around for words, for meaning, for metaphors to explain how much he needed him in his life, “that-” he swallowed, “That it gets better. That loneliness is not all there is to life-”
Draco glared at the ground before looking up and staring at Moody in the eyes with an edge of indifference. They stared at each other until finally, “The Imperious Curse.”
Malfoy looked apprehensive, staring off to the side, but continued nodding like he wanted this conversation to end now.
That was a healing bruise. On Draco’s face. Harry didn’t know how Draco had hidden it, but whatever Draco had used was fading, and the purple edges around his left eye had become clearer with another rub of Draco in panic. Makeup? Probably.
1. This is for lovelyoons who sent that comment that put me under pressure to finish this chapter, despite the fact that they said 'no pressure'... next time, say 'full pressure'. Because apparently I work under pressure.
“Hmm?” She didn’t even look up from her porridge, and Harry didn’t look away from the snow that began to fall out the window.
Draco scoffed, “First year-”
“And then what? You’ll scream at everyone that my father beats me?”
Tom stood proudly at his theatrical revelation, while Harry ferociously stared back and forth between his wrists and the man in front of him.
Harry nodded, “Can I ask-” Harry had started walking towards Draco, stopping when he saw Draco quickly shuffle backwards, away from Harry. Scared. “Why are you scared of me?”
Harry didn’t wait for their response, pulling Draco away, by the loops of his trousers, figuring that would be more inconspicuous than pulling his arm. It wasn’t, not while Harry was speed walking away.
Harry watched profusely as Draco’s eyes took everything in. His lips, his hair, his chin, his scar, his eyes. He really liked his eyes. Draco’s finger grazed his cheek again, slowly reaching up to the permanent reminder on Harry’s face of just how not easy it is. “My father doesn’t like you.” Draco’s voice sounded like an angelic whisper.
Ron smiled as though Harry was a little child, “I will be real honest with you-”
Future Draco already told him it was a fluke, a trap, so why is he still going? Sirius dies because he goes there… ‘I will not go to the Ministry, I will not go to the Ministry, I will not go to the Ministry…’
Harry shook his head, “Babies create emotional and muscle memories, not visual memories… It feels like it doesn’t belong to me, even though…”
ENJOY!
“Why did you ask him to, Potter?” Harry became aware that Draco was stalking him now, leading him backwards, maybe to intimidate him, or maybe to make it easier for him to run away if Harry was far away from the stairs, “Why do you want me to be your... “ Draco looking around dramatically, before mockingly ending it with, “Friend?”
Harry scoffed and shook his head, “You are ridiculous.”
I could spend some time re-reading and re-writing this chapter, and remove the self-insert from it. But I feel is stupid Harry barely ever reacted to things like a normal teenager. Harry has plenty of excuses and reasons for him to have various mental illnesses, including Stockholm Syndrome, anxiety, among others.
Ron grimaced, “Well, Lefty senior definitely does not inspire joy.”
Finally Hermione sighed, “Anyway, the first task is in two days… How do you feel?”
Ron smiled, “Try and focus on class. Not on the tournament, not on Malfoy, not on the possibility that there’s someone out there trying to kill you. We’ll worry about those things for you.”
Harry paused, turning around to find Draco still frozen, staring at the spot Harry had just been in.
He shrugged, “He doesn’t want to be paraded in, he has enough going on in his life. I need a decoy. Just for the annoying first part. And from my understanding, third years can’t go to the ball.”
His faint smile flickered and he whispered, “I don’t really have a choice.”
“Couldn’t sleep.”
“I am paying attention.”
Malfoy was in his room. Now he regretted dumping Ron and Hermione. But his pride didn’t allow him to go back in. So he waited outside, pulling them aside immediately when he saw them, “Was Lefty in class today?”
Harry rushed towards Draco, pulling him to look at him.
Harry smiled, “You believe me? When I say I didn’t put my name in?”
Harry sighed, frustrated and threw the orange away, his foiled gloves following the orange, storming off to Divination class with an amused Ron following him, asking him if he wanted to borrow at least one of his gloves.
“Were you defending Malfoy?”
“Why are you protec-” It felt like Hermione slapped his memory and every question had one answer. “Your father.”
Harry paused, mouth open, as his first instinct was not a nice one, “You exaggerated.”
Harry eyed him wearily, baffled that someone like Draco would sit in the rain… then again, someone as dramatic as Draco might have seeked the opportunity just for the theatrical effect of it. “In the rain?”
“But like Ron said, ‘Mione, you’re part of the group-”
After begging Draco to throw his shyness away and dance that stupid dance with him, to no avail, all Harry remembers is having heated discussions on who else could Harry take to that stupid ball. The consensus being the no-mates Padma Patil and Daphne Greengrass and maybe Ginny. Actually by the end Draco seemed to be favoring Ginny. Patil and Greengrass were wild cards, while everyone knew where Ginny stood, and that was in cloud nine with her favorite blond. Both her and Lovegood were too young to go to the ball. It seemed like the gents would do them a favor and all but sneak them in, for their own selfish reasons.
Harry shrugged. "Ron and I have come here before, though not for a while. Are you always here, then?" He hadn't seen Malfoy out much, though he always saw him in the papers. The last time they had actually spoken was at some Ministry event last year, and they had barely exchanged more than a few pleasantries.
Harry snorted. "Don't go preaching to me what I've just taught you," he said. "Anyway, you know what I mean."
The more Draco read about it, the more he discovered that much of the marriages within the older Eilert Family had been arranged, and that most of those were influenced by Persephone's Poison. He hypothesized that the elder Eilerts had sought to build a formidable clan of Pureblood witches and wizards, and the family tree from hundreds of years ago proved that the marriages into the family were from highly affluent and distinguished families. The unwilling husbands and wives never knew better, as the Potion's effects were impossible to completely reverse, changing the way the victim thought and acted without truly affecting their entire personality. They probably even learned to be happily married to the Eilerts, ignorant of the nefarious scheme.
The tension was so palpable that Draco was sure they both held their breaths for too long.
Mr. Weasley nodded enthusiastically. "I'm sure it will be a wonderful change in your life, m'boy."
Draco tried to break down the situation from a pureblood's point of view, in hopes of determining if the problem was rooted in a difference in cultural traditions, but he came up with nil. He and Astoria had spent much time away from each other during their long engagement, but they hadn't had a child during that. They had also had a clear list of expectations and limitations on their contract, which had so far ensured that they were both contented.
He didn't bother doing anything other than to collapse on their bed. He stared up at the canopy of the four-poster and let his thoughts wander.
"What do you want?"
He knew that ranting and rambling were getting them nowhere, but he had no idea how that tracking charm would activate, nor how long it would take for the Aurors to find him. He knew though, that as long as Astoria gave her permission, everything would be fine.
"Get to the point."
"How are Narcissa and Astoria?" Harry ventured. He wasn't too close to either, since he only saw them at the few social events he actually attended. They were nice, and they'd had some good conversations, but the connection would not have held the
"Of course. We had to wait for the Healers to give her the all-clear, but yes, she must attend an event at Belgium. I'm unable to accompany her because I've got several business meetings here. Whatever is the matter, Potter?"
"How long?"
Malfoy looked him straight in the eye.
"Mother f-found an old Black ward but it won't work! We've - we've tried the ritual twice now but it just won't attach to Scorpius' magic! I don't know what to do, Harry! What if he's been cursed?!"
"Fucker." Harry went through the pages. "I swear, if he weren't our boss... d'you think we can Floo them both and just have them sign? Send him back his bloody owl as soon as it's all done."
Ron and Hermione had finally gone late into the afternoon, and Harry now found himself very much alone with Ginny, whose blazing eyes matched the sharpness of her tone.
"I don't know what happened to us, Harry," she cried, tears soaking into his shirt. "Why do you think this happened? I thought we would be so happy together! We used to be so happy!"
Oddly enough, he felt no regret.
"I will allow it. But I will have you officially grounded for medical reasons after your fourth month, and request for a maternity leave after the sixth month, as I've mentioned earlier."
Truth be told, Draco was actually doing his best to rile up his ex-nemesis again to try and get him out of his passive-aggression, but it was to no avail. Hearing such self-deprecation from someone he had once hated was more painful and pathetic than he had expected. And he hated it, hated hearing such weakness from someone he had once resented and admired at the same time.
"No, not married," Harry answered in the same practiced tone he had used for everyone who had inquired. "Engaged, though."
"Albus Severus," he whispered back reverently, moving closer to be able to hold them all in his arms.
"Fine, fine," said Draco with a little snicker. "So when would you like to fu-"
"Are you having me on?" he said. "You
"Finally realized that?" Harry couldn't help but ask. Ginny just looked even more remorseful.
"Sirius died when-" Potter seemed to be trying to control his voice, which made Draco feel slightly guilty. He had only been curious about the house, not the family drama. He seemed to want to go on, though. "It was in fifth year, during the Ministry break in that I told you about before. We had broken into the Department of Mysteries, and- and Bellatrix killed him."
"Anything in mind?" he asked.
"As long as they can be trusted with our lives," his mother answered coolly.
, and you still have no idea how much power I have over you."
"For this," Potter replied calmly.
"Why of course you may be excused, dear boy!" cried Lady Greengrass, as if she was the one who had just taken a long trip Draco nodded, bowed again, then turned and left. As he walked away, he could hear her continue her ramblings. "Such a fine boy, Narcissa, oh! They will have such lovely children..."
"And?"
"I mean, Pansy, that Astoria's been acting a bit... flighty."
His sharp tone was broken by the sudden and unexpected hug from Hermione.
"Malfoy was here on our invitation. Though it was made while under the influence, we all had a pretty good time."
"And I meant what I said, too," Draco countered lightly. "I repeat. No need for thanks of any kind. Anyway, you were the one who bloody drilled all these ridiculous friend rules into my head."
"I'm not sure," Potter said, looking pensive. Draco noticed his green eyes turned upwards at the ceiling as if he were trying to see his thoughts. "I was raised by Muggles, but it's not as if I was exposed to the culture, you know? And among the wizards and witches I've met, I guess the subject of naming hasn't really come up. Though I know Ron was named for one of his great uncles, and Hermione got hers because her parents were fans of mythology. I've no idea if I'm named after someone, but Sirius did mention once that my parents had argued about naming me. To be honest, I think my mother won that with her 'Muggle sentiments'," he said with a bit of a grin.
Harry grinned and nodded. "Seeing as you and Ron are probably zombies this week, I thought I'd make you some so you have a little less to worry about-" his words were cut short by a mouthful of hair. He spat out most of the frizz before saying "Geez, Mione, a little warning next time before you attack me, okay?"
on Harry's modified entertainment system.
The only sound then were Ron's choking sobs, while Harry took in his words and his panic melted away, replaced by immense sympathy for his mate.
This case was driving everyone in MMI mental. The amount of guilt running around the department was also increasing, since they hadn't been able to put a stop to the string of murders. The suspect that they had apprehended had had a complicated Memory Charm worked into his mind, which made it difficult for Harry's team to construct a decent profile. All that they had to work on was a recovered list of ingredients, whose final product could not be found in the suspect's head, but was presumably sinister in nature, and probably used to commit the horrid crimes.
thing he needs is-"
For a fleeting second, Harry met Malfoy's eyes. So much had gone on between the two of them and Harry was afraid that he had put faith in the wrong person.
Hermione was silent, absorbing this new tidbit about the culture that she had thought she already knew. After another comfortable silence, she finally decided to return Hugo to his crib. Then, she led Malfoy back into the kitchen, where their tea had gone cold. She quickly Charmed the kettle to heat more water.
Something caught in his throat, and he was afraid that if he opened his mouth to speak, he would break down right in front of her. Nothing more embarrassing than a Malfoy revealing his innermost self-doubts about parenthood to a Muggleborn.
"Is it?" Harry knew they needed to address the elephant in the room, otherwise she might never get better. "I think you've become too overinvolved and unnecessarily attached to your jobs," he said finally. Might as well get straight to the heart of it. He mentally prepared for a backlash.
within him, adding to his growing sense of safety.
Out of nowhere, an idea sparked in Harry's mind. He straightened up suddenly, startling his team.
He had been gobsmacked by the front page news that day, though he hadn't had the nerve to mention it to the Auror in case it was a much more sensitive issue. Draco couldn't deny, however, that he was very worried what it might mean to his new friend. For once, he understood what the Trio had meant about being supportive in times of emotional upheavals. He wanted to be supportive, but he didn't know how.
Overall, the entire mind mapping business was a pain in the arse, which of course meant that almost every single Auror went out for drinks immediately once it was over. Harry himself couldn't be more grateful. He hadn't expected it to be so hard to be away from home for a month worth of office-time, and it was the first instance of him being away from the kids during the day. Granted, his actual hours were half (since he only had to be present to sign off paperwork for the mind maps) but it still left him restless. Luckily, Ginny had asked Odair for a two-month long reprieve from training. Of course, it meant more time with the team in preparation for their run in South Africa, but it was heaven for both Harry and Ginny that the arrangement had worked out to their favor.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "Sure, anything in particular you wanted to do or try out?"
Ginny hugged him. "Okay, I guess your suggestion of having our own floors to ourselves is a good one for now. And yeah, it might not be in a while but…" She whispered conspiratorially in his ear, "When you
The odd exchange brought Draco out of his mental stupor. "
Draco grinned. "Happy birthday, Potter."
For the first time in his life, Draco felt so happy that he was sure he could produce a Patronus as bright as the stars he was named for.
Harry felt that happy jolt in his stomach again at the mention of their child.
By the time June came around, the Office of Malicious Magical Intent, despite being one of the youngest departments within the Auror Corps, had successfully apprehended twice as many guilty wizards in the last year alone as the previous system had in the last ten years. As such, the Minister awarded Harry with a larger space, as well as more Aurors on his team.
When Kreacher disappeared, Ginny took James and placed him on her lap. He cooed at her and grabbed at the lock of hair that was hanging in front of her shoulder. "Why don't we go out for lunch?" she asked. Harry shrugged. "It's going to be less trouble, and you won't have to clean up anything."
"Harry Potter!" he called into the emerald flames. A disembodied voice rang from the hearth.
Harry, who knew Ron well enough to know his habit of letting his mouth run free without thinking, tried to calm her down. "'Mione," he said with a bit of a laugh, "forget about it. He didn't mean any of it. How could he think women in power are a joke when he's dating you?!"
The conversation went over Draco's head, his thoughts still centered on the fact that Scorpius had not been his own child. In the past years, he had taken pride in having his own kin. He had showered his son with everything he would ever need, both in material and in affection. He had loved little Scorpius with all he had, offering his heart and soul… he had even Named him! Scorpius… Scorpius…
But their grins could not outshine the one on Potter's face, Draco was sure - he looked absolutely pleased with himself. The Auror gleefully stepped towards Astoria, bowed, and kissed her hand.
"It's great," Potter said with a laugh. Then the expression faded a little. "I'll survive."
"It's more than okay!" Draco couldn't help but smile back in relief. "Thank you so much, Hermione. This means a lot."
"Thanks, Malfoy," Potter said, still smiling. "Have a good night." With that, the connection closed, and Draco moved away from the hearth.
Draco perused the list. "You're correct," he said, "this does resemble a typical potion recipe, though the names...hold on." He took a moment to gather his thoughts, since the Slytherin in his had been taught to visit all angles and possibilities immediately. "Has it occurred to your team that this may have been left intact in his memory in the first place? On purpose?"
Malfoy stared incredulously at the stranger in front of him. What did he even mean?
Hermione and Ginny both sputtered. "Excuse you?" Hermione said, "what do you mean, 'thing'?" at the same time that Ginny asked, "ridiculous?!"
His host seemed to notice something pained from his expression. "You alright?" he asked mildly. "Was the potion not enough?"
Fuck.
Harry warmed at the compliment. He had told himself that the house had needed a little life in it, so he liked that Malfoy had used those words to describe how he saw it.
It seemed it was Malfoy's turn to turn pink, but Harry decided not to comment on it. It was still too early to think of such things, after all.
It was the tone that made him believe that he could do no right.
Their conversation was interrupted by the tapping of an owl by the window. Ron recognized it as one of their official owls, so he immediately took the letter it delivered. His face scrunched as he read it.
"I won't let it get to that, you know," Harry said, bristling a bit at the thought of any harm befalling Draco.
"Well, you're at least good company," the brunet said, still smiling, "so maybe we can just indulge Teddy with that cake he wants, and while away the rest of the day and see what we get up to. What do you think?"
: (writing notes) Yes, thank you, Ms. Granger. Is it just you now, staying here at the Burrow?
"Offering my support as a friend, of course," the blond answered.
Ron slapped his best mate on the back. Harry's eyes snapped open and he looked sheepishly at the red head to his right. He had fallen asleep at a most inopportune time, right in the middle of a speech being made by some local ministry official that Harry had, from early on, decided he didn't care about.
When he thought about it though, a part of him, (which had made its presence more obvious as the days went by) had begun to yearn for the only missing piece to his life - an heir. What he couldn't admit even to his wife, however, was that he very much wanted more than just an heir - he wanted a son. Or a daughter. Either way, he suddenly had grown the desire to become someone's father. In hindsight, it was probably just a repressed part of him wanting to completely negate his own father's shortcomings by being the kind of father he never knew he wanted to his own child.
un-Malfoy, but he couldn't care less.
And oddly, he still felt no regret.
"You still retained your career, though, right?" He wasn't exactly up to date with the Trio gossip these past few years, and only remembered snippets from conversations with Potter and Weasley.
When the intern left, Harry couldn't help his curiosity.
"Under the what?" Ron asked.
"It will be fine," she assured him, her words a blanket of comfort on his anxiety-ridden mind. "I'll stay with her now, you should go and get rest."
"Harry, Harry! Can we, now?"
"You work with the Ministry now, too, don't you?" Harry inquired.
"Nevermind!" Potter huffed, which made Draco laugh out loud at his expense.
"You're one all the time."
"How could the threat break through the wards, then? They'd have to come from blood relations, or someone specifically keyed into the wards."
It took a while for the blonde to gather his thoughts, but when he did, he gave a bright smile and Harry felt the glow from his host. "It was absolutely brilliant!" Malfoy all but exclaimed. "I blame YOU, by the way, for poisoning my thoughts. I was lucky enough that my mother is apparently a rebel and allowed our little secret to happen behind everyone else's backs."
Harry would find him, he knew it.
"Hello, Potter," the disembodied head in the flames said, somewhat sheepishly. Since when did Slytherins ever allow themselves to sound even remotely sheepish?
"That bad?" Ron asked with a grimace.
PS: I uploaded this via mobile, so sorry for any weird formatting. I'll fix it the next time I'm online on my laptop. X
"And who might you be?" he asked in a lighter tone, full of curiosity.
"You just don't talk about it," Draco finished for him. He was already starting to see just how much Potter might be hiding. "I reacted badly as well."
Harry couldn't think.
as Harry had promised. James was happily playing with a magical set of blocks in front of them, while an enlarged play pen held the tottering pair of Albus and Scorpius.
"Hopefully it'll be analyzed superficially," Potter said. "They'll have the general idea of how our minds run, and they'll realize that we're just doing our job and they can just go on and focus on actually doing theirs."
That night, Draco went through his usual routine. He wished Narcissa a good night. He bid all the house elves to rest. He cleared out his desk and prepared the documents he needed for the next morning. Then, he went to up to his and Astoria's bedroom, and Floo-called his wife (who was staying in Vienna for the weekend). Finally, after his somewhat complicated bathroom ritual, he settled himself into bed and waited for sleep to take him.
Macmillan tapped his fingers on the conference table. "What about protection?"
Harry looked up in shock. "They're... they're okay?" he asked meekly.
Ron shook his head, laughing. "Yeah but now you've got the Order of Merlin. That's pretty bad arse, mate."
"Other people…" It took a while before Harry understood what she meant. "Like…
Perhaps the pureblood wizarding culture had really affected the man's expectations in life. Being reclusive yet celebrated socialites, he and Astoria no doubt had grown up within the similar bubble that was the exact opposite of the environment that Harry and his friends were used to. It was only now that he realized to what extent the Weasleys were removed from 'pure' wizarding society, if their ways were more similar to Harry's and Hermione's, both of whom were raised by Muggles.
"You had your reasons, Harry. Not everyone will understand. Hell, even I was a bit surprised when you told me your plan to appear in court, but again, no one can say anything about it because you chose to do it."
Truth be told, Draco did feel the same. "It does feel right, doesn't it?" he agreed. "It's a bit of a relief for me to hear that I'm not alone in that regard."
And they spent the rest of the night and part of the morning watching
As if the situation hadn't already been awkward, it escalated when Lady Greengrass bluntly announced, "I hope our negotiations do push through, Narcissa." She gave a squawky laugh. "I'm quite sure your son and my daughter would make such a lovely couple!"
"More importantly," said Potter, "do you actually think following this angle will add to the investigation?"
Ron was pensive for a moment. "You know, Harry," he mused, "it's only just beginning to sink in. Now that you've got that magical binding around you, there's nothing anyone can do! No stolen photos, no embarrassing articles without your permission..."
"There you are, dear!" Narcissa exclaimed with relief as Draco stepped out of the fireplace. He walked over to where she was sitting and bent down to give her a perfunctory kiss on the cheek. She gave him such a lovely smile that he couldn't help but return it.
"No, I'm not a vampire," Harry said laughing, earning another warm smile from the blond. "You're providing me with an appropriate diet, so no worries about being a terrible host or whatnot."
Harry chuckled and settled himself in the armchair across the room. "You wait till he or she is born. From what I've heard from Bill and Fleur, we'll never get a good night's sleep again until we ship them off to Hogwarts. What did Molly say to you anyway?"
Narcissa chuckled. "It's for magical reasons, love," she said soothingly. "The child's birth room cannot be tainted by magic other than Astoria's. The Healers help her through the process, but their spells have special nullifying properties to ensure that Astoria's is the strongest magical presence there."
For another thing, Harry couldn't quite get his head around the fact that he had actually enjoyed the entire process.
: Well, I know she's all famous and stuff now, travelling around the world and giving out autographs and meeting fans, making a mark on those Quidditch records. But at the end of the day, it's just her and boring old me,
Harry took the time to take another bite before speaking again. "So, how's little Scorp?"
In any case, starting the morning with an exchange of verbal abuse was fast becoming a comfort blanket for the two of them. Now halfway through their full English and after much biting banter, Harry felt much more at ease with Malfoy.
The Lady Black's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Astoria?"
Narcissa looked at Draco with curiosity. "Was there any particular reason you had to track me down here yourself?"
Draco opened one eye and saw Potter pointing dramatically to where Weasley was still snoring, tangled limbs trying (and failing) to squeeze themselves haphazardly into the constraints of the couch. He gave a snort and then looked back at his tea, before finally taking a sip. The taste startled him, however, and this time he trained both of his eyes towards the Auror sitting across from him.
Harry nodded his acquiescence. "We've agreed to be more responsible about it, and truth be told, we've both been busy anyway, so any... er..."
"Much better, thanks," she replied while stowing away the pie into the fridge. It had been a week since the mad rush to St. Mungo's, but at least she was visually looking better. Even her mood was much more positive than the usual angry haze that surrounded her before and after work (a.k.a. All the time). The bed rest and work leave seemed to be a good combination for her stress levels. That also meant that she and Ron got along much better again, which meant that Ron was also in a good mood.
While deep in thought, his Floo changed color, indicating an incoming call. He waved his hand to open the connection, only to find himself facing none other than-
"Sirius Black was my godfather," Potter said, finally explaining everything. "He left me everything he owned, which included this house." Potter gestured around them with his arms. "I used to hate this place, you know. Even when I finally fixed it up, I still got my own flat, which is where I usually live. I missed this house though, so I came back here with- I came back here for a while."
Draco nodded. He appreciated that he at least didn't have to spell every single thing out for Hermione to understand.
It took a while for Draco's imagination to stop ruminating, and he eventually fell into an uneasy sleep.
"I was wrong."
"Your mother is a strong woman," Potter said with a hint of awe. Draco acquiesced with a nod. "Hermione used her cleverness around my panic attacks, she didn't tell me till later that she'd gone through all the books she could about Muggle Psychology and helped me get through my PTSD without me really knowing it."
"I don't like being away from you," she all but sobbed into his shirt.
Sure she had been away during the day, but she always came home at night. Sure, they barely even met up because she was home late and gone early, but she always come home at night.
"Because you take care of 'beauty' while I take charge of the 'brains' part of this marriage," Draco teased, kissing her forehead before getting back on his feet. "Tell me if there's anything else you'll need today, since I'll be out after dinner."
"The next one will be sooner," Weasley pronounced with confidence. "We'll just have to keep an eye out for it."
Well, Draco found it hard not to smile whenever he thought about those things. Not that he was aware of the expression on his face, of course. Or maybe he was, but at this point, he was too happily distracted to actually give a damn.
When he was in bed that night, Harry found himself tossing and turning. Ginny, used to his nightmares, carefully moved him to a safer position and cast the usual set of Cushioning Charms before falling asleep again.
Weasley clapped him on the back. "Remember when this happened to me and Mione?" he asked. "Well, I'm returning the favor and telling you that Ginny is a strong horse and she'll make it out of this just fine."
Draco shook his head. "Yes, I know you've been popping out your offspring, and living to tell the tale," he said, making sure his tone was light enough so as not to offend his friend. He liked to think they were past that, anyway. "It's not a walk in the park, I know. I've don't my share of reading, Pansy."
"What? It's the truth," the mystery man interrupted, casually tapping his finger repeatedly on the back of his chair. "How you never discovered it is still beyond me. But like I said, I don't think you're every bit as clever as you believe. Let me spell it out for you. That. Brat. Is. Mine."
"Is that why you thought to call tonight?" Harry finally thought it appropriate to get to the bottom of Malfoy's odd call.
"Do you really have to put your arms up in that ridiculous manner, Potter?" Draco insisted. "It's rather distracting."
"Potter!" he cried, alarmed by the sudden appearance.
She walked into the room, still with a slight flush tinting her freckled cheeks. She dropped her Quidditch bag onto one of the chairs and sidled up to where Harry was seated, hugging him gently from behind. "Hi."
Ginny remained silent, so he went on as if to make the conversation much easier for her.
"Does that mean we get to play with Cousin Draco again?" the little metamorphmagus asked excitedly. He was still at the age where he couldn't quite understand repetitive patterns in the long term, but knew enough that he was always worked up whenever he realized it was a Sunday, because Sundays were special.
"I don't see the problem," Harry said, raising an eyebrow. "We fulfill all three. So what's our point?"
Harry felt a pang of something as he had a moment of reminiscing. It had been a while since he, Ron and Malfoy had gone for their boy's night. If he were honest with himself, he missed it a bit.
"Ginny!"
Narcissa tried to soften her expression, but failed. "How would he have gotten into the wards?"
He was sure that both Ron and Hermione had received his frantic message through his Patronus, but he had the common sense to realize that both of them would probably need at least a few minutes before they could drop their current responsibilities and visit. As for Malfoy, Harry had sent Hedwig with a quick note since, unlike with Ron and Hermione, he wasn't sure the blond would be open to the sudden barging of a silver stag into his privacy. Nor did he think he would appreciate any sort of urgency - as far as Harry knew, Malfoy wouldn't care so much about his personal problems.
In a way, Harry already knew what was coming next, and he didn't know if it was a good thing that he was calmly prepared for it.
"Hmmm…" Harry could feel his brows scrunching together beyond the limits of anatomy, he was just so frustrated. Hearing the news about Scorpius really made him more determined.
"I wonder if you just need to dip your toes into the dating pool again," Draco suggested nonchalantly. The brunette smirked.
"I try."
"It's in your nature. I married you for more than your money, you know," she replied. "You have your cold, hard, Malfoy intellect and your unquenchable sense of self-preservation. Putting all of that together, I trust that you will find a way out of this before any of us end up in real danger."
Draco couldn't process what he was hearing. It was too incredible. This was a dream. It had to be a bad dream. How could Scorpius be…
"No, Mother is busy with her research on certain blood wards, and Astoria has several of her political circle visiting, which is why I thought to have some time with Scorpius."
As they all tried to control their loud laughter, Kreacher appeared. "Afternoon tea and cakes, Master Harry," he announced before popping away again, leaving the coffee table now full of small confections and a nice hot pot.
Harry had no idea what to say. This was too unbelievable. "I don't want to."
: Nah, I don't think so, not really. I mean, it's Hermione we're talking about. She wouldn't be herself if she didn't get all into her job. It's just like SPEW all over, it's just who she is, and that's what makes her amazing.
"Er," Potter said, realizing that they had been silent. "Anyways, that's about it. We'll see you when you feel ready to get back on stage."
The unwarranted action made Draco's lip curl up just a bit, and he slowly took the cup with as little trepidation as he could manage. Truthfully though, just the bit of perfectly made tea made him more relaxed despite being in the home of his new "friend", and in his dressing gown, no less.
"You're so melodramatic sometimes," Harry teased.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. "I took him this morning for a walk around the garden. I would have taken him in earlier but I had some... business calls to attend to."
"Perhaps I have been reading too much into it, but I have been watching over you and even the slightest changes in your behavior are cause for my concern."
Potter laughed, perhaps one of the first genuine laughs that Draco had ever witnessed on Potter's face. "Yes, it would have been inconvenient, but almost everyone at the Ministry does it whenever they go on holiday. So I thought it was appropriate to thank you in person."
Harry nodded. "Plus tomorrow. Ginny won't be able to stay with the kids and Arthur and Molly have gone back to France, so I'll have my hands full. If things go well on her end, she might have to go iron out some contract formalities with her team. So if ever, I'll probably work from home again for the next week or two."
Draco nodded, turning away and focusing on the way Scorpius was playing with his slender fingers. "I don't want to waste my time cozying up to whoever is gracing Portugal with their holy presence -"
Malfoy gave a non-committal sound. Harry knew the man was already quite familiar with the interesting system that he and Ginny had established. "If you need me, you know where to find me," he added.
"But you work there, don't you think -"
"The motive doesn't have to be just money. It could have been family name, or heritage, or magical lineage. It could be some obsession. A crush gone wrong. I mean, before we apprehended the Eilerts, can you imagine how many Purebloods must have gotten their paws on this potion just to be able to get someone to marry them? Wizarding history is chock full of really sketchy weddings. Bet you the Eilerts have been cashing in on the demand for their special brand of potion."
Potter handed over another sheet of parchment over to Draco. "Here's a map of Pince's mind. After our particular brand of interrogation, which includes much more thorough analyses and cross-referencing, we concluded that his personality resembles that of someone who is at fault, and obviously guilty, but also showing more fear and intimidation than can be found from our working model of a typical mastermind."
How very un-Malfoy they had both become.
"I know," Harry said. "But it could've gone on for longer and just made us even more miserable."
"I've said it before, Gin. We can all stick with this house for as long as we need," Harry said tiredly. "The flat isn't enough space, so this is the obvious choice. And we have our own rooms and everything, so I don't see a problem."
it's relevant," Harry snapped, glaring at Ron.
: (laughs) You asked, I answered. Next question?
For some reason, he thought of Potter.
But Malfoy seemed to be different now, Harry reflected. He observed the potions master talking with Teddy, who seemed to have been excited to find out that he had a cousin. While they talked animatedly, Harry had an internal debate with himself. Andromeda took the chance to talk to him while Malfoy was preoccupied with her grandson.
"Master Draco," the elf bowed low with respect. "You is having a special delivery."
Hermione blushed. "Fine," she said. "but it's not something you should joke about."
"Well..." Ginny thought about it for a bit. "I definitely hope to get out of training with a recommendation to play professionally. It's the least they could do after all the effort I've given."
"It might be," Ella replied gently. "I used to work with Tracking before moving to MMI, so I know how thorough their process can be. All I've been able to submit for their analysis were the two cards and the envelopes they came in, but at least we now have a narrower frame of reference."
"Can you..." Since when did Draco ever run out of words to say?! "Can you tell me about... about my childhood?"
"Hard habit to break, I guess," Draco said with a signature smirk. "I did spend most, if not all of my formative years using your last name as the most insulting expletive, and you've got to admit, saying 'Harry' just doesn't give as much satisfaction as spitting out 'Potter' with the proper amount of spite." He made sure to enunciate his P's as forcefully as he could, just like he always used to.
"How's Gin?" he asked, eyebrows scrunched in obvious apprehension. "How's -"
"Shut it," Potter said suddenly, expression still blank but voice matching the sharpness in Draco's. "It wasn't like that at all. I don't even know why I said that, so just forget it."
"We need your help with research into the old magical ward, find the reasons why it might have failed for Scorpius. Three of us have already scoured the library, and we've come up with nothing new to add to what Mother has already found before attempting it. You are the only one I know who can help this time…"
It's not what? Harry resumed his internal debate furiously. A part of him wanted to keep his walls up, keep James away from everyone but those who mattered. But the other side of him was tired of the charade, tired of hiding behind wards, tired of keeping secrets.
He couldn't seem to decide on his words, but he could tell that Ginny was trying to defuse his nerves by smiling encouragingly at him and gently taking his hand in hers.
He decided to take a break and went to the corner of his study, where James was playing quite happily with blocks in his play pen. Harry took his son in his arms and playfully bounced him up and down, sometimes throwing him up in the air and catching him again. The baby was ecstatic, and Harry had the feeling they would have another Quidditch player in the family, it was practically inevitable.
When Scorpius laughed again, much more exuberantly, his father's expression morphed once more into a bright grin, making Astoria roll her eyes dramatically as she left.
"Distraction is completely legal in Quidditch, as you very well know as former Captain."
"You're off today?"
"Are you expecting anyone tonight, darling?" Draco asked his wife.
"I've realized..." Malfoy took a breath before he could keep going. "I've realized that you, of all people, could probably understand me."
"You're not yourself here, you know."
Harry laughed at the shock on Malfoy's face. "Fifth Year. Break In at the Ministry. Long story."
As for the raising of children, Harry and Ginny agreed to balance work and home time, with Harry still working from his home office and Ginny coming home every night instead of staying with the rest of the Harpies on their training grounds. The weekends, they both put their full attention to James and Albus. Any unplanned situations were helped along by Molly, Arthur, or Andromeda.
Carved into the highly complicated and dramatic life story of Harry Potter was a tiny little corner dedicated to a vain and pretentious blond, wherein he could feel comfortable enough to discuss his fears, insecurities and pretty much every other thing that could have been potentially embarrassing to mention to other people.
It was quiet again, the boys sleeping and no visitor to annoy him.
"Yes?" Ron asked, scowling. He hated being interrupted by the 'ickle interns'.
And Potter. Harry. Bless him and his impish grin and awkward strut, always there to save the day. Not so long ago, it would have been a hard pill for Draco to swallow if he had to admit to being dependent on the Boy Who Lived.
Ron jumped at hearing his name. "Yes?"
When Harry and Ginny both nodded, she continued carefully. "I believe that a similar situation occurred. What I mean to say is, it appears that your magic, Ms. Weasley, has been reacting unfavorably perhaps due to extreme stress and extended states of emotional distress. Does this seem consistent so far with your current lifestyle?"
"So..."
He would have gone to bed already, but for the whirl of disorganized thoughts now going through his head at an alarmingly distracting manner. Once again, his new "friend" had unwittingly succeeded at making rethink everything he used to believe.
Draco took a deep breath. (Did it seem exaggerated? No, not for this. He needed enough wind for this). "Well... as you already know, the wards are powered by the magical core and magical intent of the focus..."
"No, no, you just startled me, is all." Harry laughed to himself when he thought about all those arguments he used to have with Ginny over the proper temperature. "I do have a similar Charm attached to that snow globe over there, actually." He pointed to the knick-knack on the coffee table. "Must have forgotten to reset it last night. But it's nice to see that you're on the same page."
"I understand your career plans, the importance you put in ambition," he said. After all, Astoria and I had gone against tradition by pursuing our own interests and not merely living from our inheritance. Even after giving birth, my wife plans on going about her so-called diplomatic missions here and abroad, because it's who she is," Draco shrugged. "In any case, I'm glad you've ironed it out with Weasley. It must have been difficult, having such opposing ideals. But at least he understands your goals, and now you understand that wizards, Pureblood or no, place great value in children, even if the conception was, shall we say, accidental. No matter the circumstance, every magical child is celebrated."
Like the fact that Malfoy so needed control in his life that even just ordering at a deli took so much consideration (Harry just picked one of his favorite ready-made ones). Or that his initial expectations of married life were very different in terms of closeness and intimacy (Harry shuddered to imagine what it must be like for an unfortunate traditional pureblood to sleep with their spouses without the intimacy of romantic love. Lie back and think of England, indeed).
Trivia time!: "Solum Sanctuarii" is literally Latin for "Sole Sanctuary". This will be elaborated in later Chapters. If you think it has bad grammar or syntax, kindly blame Google Translate :)
"I'm glad you're up for the long engagement, too" he admitted. "Not that I'm scared or anything, it's just that there's so much that we both can do, and I think we'd be happier if we'd done everything we wanted before having a family."
Harry laughed. "My room."
been responsible for the well-being of someone else, whether it be the Dursleys, his best friends, or the entire world. Caring for his own son was a very welcome addition to Harry's list of responsibilities; for Ginny, it was a first.
Astoria laughed. "I think he's finally broken you," she said teasingly. Draco scowled.
"So," Harry said quickly, turning to Hermione once again. "How is everything at the DMLE?"
Draco marveled how Potter always managed to look into his past, full of hurt and pain, and still find something good to take from it. "The Potters were Pureblood, so if your parents got to name you, then I'm sure your mother did indeed twist your father's arm somehow."
"I can't believe we're having this conversation," Draco finally said. He wasn't feeling so agitated anymore, just annoyed. "I don't like feeling like you are still trying to control my life."
Harry shook his head though. He had way too much to deal with at the moment. "I'm sorry, Teddy, but it's past your bedtime already! You can play with- you can play tomorrow, alright? Go up to your room first and I'll follow you soon enough."
"Perhaps... I can't get over my surprise that you would actually invite me to cross into your Floo..."
"Will you write him back?" Astoria queried, using the tone usually reserved for when she was giving him the benefit of the doubt.
Harry almost moved towards Draco to grab his hand, but caught himself early enough. He cleared his throat consciously. "Dray, I'm sure there's a reason behind this. The last thing I want is for you to start losing your head and panicking. We're going to catch this guy before he even gets his paws on you, alright?"
"I did promise you that we could if you helped me tuck the boys in. And you did a great job!"
Narcissa glanced in pure curiosity at him. Her eyes, which were usually half-lidded in the haughty manner of the wealthy, were suddenly wide as saucers as she regarded the odd request of her only son. "And why, may I ask, would you choose to break tradition?"
love him. That he did not come from me will never discount the fact that I myself have been his father! And no one can ever take that away!"
"She'll be away from you again," Hermione pretty much bawled out at this point. "It's sad! It's not meant to be like this!"
"What now?" he asked with an already defeated sigh when he saw the expression on Ella's face. Hell, even Ron knew things would have to go bad where Harry was concerned before they could ever get to the brighter side.
As he and Ginny settled themselves in the pristinely white examination room of their Healer and awaited for her arrival, he couldn't help but fidget with the loop of his jeans. After the brief talk with Ginny over the Floo the other night, he convinced her to arrange an emergency leave from the Harpies (and Ginny had thankfully remained silent about it and went immediately to the managers) so that she could be granted an immediate international Portkey back to London.
"Harry, you've been on tenterhooks since you came by with the pie that I'm starting to think it was some form of bribery. What do you want?"
, he had thought to himself. He didn't even know what he had been worried about, since he still couldn't believe she's said no.
"You're a glutton, Ronald," Hermione admonished, before serving everyone else a portion of the dessert.
he silently assessed,
The two Aurors split the parchment between them and began to rifle through the reports they had already begun to forget.
PPS: Edited formatting as promised :)
"It's still not fair how you beat me," he accused. "That should have been a foul."
"Again! One more lap, boys! Go on, you lazy louts!"
It was immediately obvious to Draco that the warmer climate of France was more agreeable to his wife, whose temperament seemed to mellow out the moment they stepped away from the Portkey Terminal.
When Draco enlisted the help of Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley, he expected them to do their job as thoroughly as they always had.
And anyway, it just felt natural, or at least Harry thought it did. And he wasn't about to give up one of the few things that he could count on to lift his mood on bad days.
"Er," he said uncomfortably, "Ihaventaskedheryetbutmaybealitlelater"
With a barking laugh, Harry agreed enthusiastically. "Of course! This might actually be one of my better birthdays, you know. Just the kids, no nosy strangers and stuffy people to impress. No noisy fanfare. Just cake. Oh, and Lord of the Rings. Perfect."
"Breathe, Malfoy," Macmillan sniggered. "It's the best precautions we've come up with, and suffice to say, it's really the only thing stronger than Malfoy wards. And Harry's told us how the suspect might get through even those."
way.”
"Wow," Ginny breathed out. "wow..."
"I like Botany. I brew my own tea leaves from our garden," she said, her eyes defiant.
"Relax, Golden Boy, no need to get your knickers in a twist," he chided, trying to keep his tone lighter and a tad more pleasant than if he had been joking with a Slytherin. One thing he had learned over the last year was that Gryffindors always took things at face value. "I was trying to rile you up, of course, and you responded beautifully. And anyway, there isn't really a need to thank me for anything, no matter what you think. I haven't done you any real favors today."
"Well," Draco began slowly, "our relationship had always been more formal and… strict. I've told you before about my own upbringing, and Father was…" his brows furrowed, "he played his role as best he could."
"Ronald Weasley!" Hermione admonished, "if I ever hear you talk about women with a tone like that, as if it's a joke! I swear to Merlin..."
Gerard grinned - lopsided, almost sneering. "Do not fret," he said calmly to her, wand twitching in his hand. "I
He used his free hand to touch his fingertip gingerly to one of the envelope's corners, expecting some sort of explosion or spark of a magical attack, but he was disappointed. All that happened was the flap unsealing itself after reading his magical signature.
After using a few household cleansing and refreshing charms around the house, and ordering a decent lunch from Kreacher (who was perhaps the only one possibly more excited than Teddy at the prospect of preparing large meals again), he found himself in front of the fire waiting patiently.
"Hey," Harry found himself saying with a sigh. "I'm honestly getting tired of hearing that from you. This game of ours has gone on for too long I think."
"You're the brightest witch of the age, and no one will ever, ever doubt that. I'll put my entire fortune on you becoming Minister if ever you pursue that."
"Is it true, what this man claims?" he demanded. "About you - about Scorpius - everything! Is it true!"
Turning his attention back to his companion, he asked, "Feeling any better yet?"
Harry saw Malfoy glance at the little boy in his arms. Teddy was obviously curious.
"That's why I'm comfortable talking like this with you," Harry said lightly. "If I had these conversations with anyone else, it'd be so different. At least I can talk with you properly."
Harry couldn't help but snort in derision.
"Yes, but that was about Ginny leaving," Hermione countered. "Not of the nature of their actual relationship."
Draco worried his bottom lip. "The Malfoy wards have been failing, so I'm hoping we can rely on Black wards until Howe is secured. I… Please decide which one is the best, and… use it to protect Scorpius. "
After having Albus, the two of them had finally laid out their plans to the entire Weasley clan. Harry and Ginny had long agreed that he preferred to be more hands on with the children, but wanted to keep working as an Auror. Meanwhile, Ginny herself also appreciated time with them, though admittedly couldn't yet give up on her dream of representing England again in 2010 (her having to miss the 2006 World Cup due to the pregnancy). They decided first, between themselves, that while Albus was under two years old, they would maintain the same living arrangements, though Ginny would have her own separate room in Grimmauld Place. Harry kept his flat, though hadn't yet thought to move back in. Actually, if he were honest with himself, the move back to Grimmauld Place, (though done for particularly melancholic reasons), was perhaps the best decision he had made for his family. The space seemed so much more perfect for the sudden extension of his life.
"Oh shut it, Ron!" cried Ginny good naturedly, smiling from beside Harry. "Let him go loony all he wants, it's not every day that he can finally go mental without the entire world whingeing about it."
Harry fell back on the bed with a growl and pulled the covers up childishly over his head.
Hopefully that wasn't a bad thing.
"Seriously, Hermione," he said, his tone now laden with his serious concern. "How's the pregnancy?"
Draco raised an eyebrow at that. It had taken a while but Hermione had finally talked to him about the way that he and Potter kept at each other's throats all the time, and admitted that it probably did more good than she had thought before.
He didn't realize that he hadn't responded until he felt Draco poking him in the arm.
Teddy nodded sagely, which Harry beamed at. In a second though, he remembered his guests. "Shall we head into the playroom?" he asked. The blond nodded and they made their way to the extra room down the hallway which Harry had converted into a child-safe playroom.
Apologies for the long wait! Had sooo much going on (both good and bad) over the last couple months. I hope the break hasn't discouraged you from continuing! Anyway, here's more Drarry! :)
"I am happy with my wife, mother. I chose her, remember?"
"If that idiot of a Mediwizard would tell me, I'd know by now," Draco spat venomously, glaring at the man who had nervously jogged away from them.
"Harry," Ron said, grasping Harry's arm to get his attention. "Are you and Ginny really okay?"
"They'll be fine," he whispered, grabbing Potter's hand and squeezing it briefly for a second before letting go again. The change in Potter was almost instantaneous, the tension leaving his stiff shoulders. "Now sit still."
"So it could still be William Howe. As a spurned ex-suitor, it all makes sense."
It was late when Harry received a very unexpected call from Malfoy Manor, but he knew in a heartbeat that it wasn't Draco. (Ron, who was having dinner at Grimmauld Place with Hermione and their children, never bothered to ask how he knew, but of course Harry never expected Malfoy to call any time before eleven).
"We're taking this very personally," Harry interjected somewhat fiercely. "Draco is our friend, and we would do anything to keep him out of harm. His family included."
Harry shrugged his shoulders before hugging her tightly. "I can control the extent of the wards around us. All that'll change is us actually giving permission. Like personal information. Maybe even photos."
Harry chuckled. "Point. Embarrassingly big wedding it is, then."
He had no idea why this was affecting him so much, but he felt as if the rug was roughly pulled from under his feet, and he had found out that he was fifty feet in the air. He had no idea what to even think. He could handle the Potter that he thought he used to know. He didn't know exactly how to handle this new person standing in front of him, calmly fixing up the table with three steaming cups of coffee.
"Right you are, my sweet."
"I'm tempted to file these away now just so I can pretend that we've moved forward on something." As he began sifting through the sheets of simplified mind maps that he had become so proficient at reading, Ron came up beside him, sharing his interest.
Harry smiled somewhat shyly. "Never better," he said.
"Sorry, it's just... I don't know, it feels odd having so much down time after the Pince case. We were all on tenterhooks for months, and now, it's back to parchment work. I'm even lucky because I at least get to do it from home with you and James near me. I imagine Ron's having a slow week at the office."
"I hope she gets over it eventually," Harry said, pouring himself a shot of Firewhiskey once they reached the bar. "D'you need to get away for a bit?" When Ginny nodded, Harry brought her to their bedroom and closed the door. The noise level immediately lowered and his fiancee let out a sigh of relief.
There was silence for a while, during which they both paid a lot of attention to their mugs. It seemed to both that they had exhausted their capacity to express their emotions. Harry threw around his thoughts then, wondering if this was all just a part of life. It seemed too much that he and Ron were basically in the same boat. On the other hand, it relieved him a bit since he knew deep down that they would probably get over this pathetic period in their lives, maybe even laugh about it. That didn't mean he couldn't hate it while it lasted.
He stepped out of the lift and into the hall that led to the Minister's Office. While walking towards the double doors at the end of the hall, flanked by two uniformed guards, Draco thought about how the Solum Sanctuarii must have changed Potter's life. He wouldn't have all the attention, first of all.
"We're to expect the next threat soon, after the lull," he said slowly, hoping that he didn't worsen the current mood. They needed to address these issues so that everyone was on the same page. "We're not to show any reactions regardless of what they might send us. The Aurors are confident that the next one will be careless, and will provide enough information for them to track down the criminal."
Realizing that she was speaking to the kidnapper, Draco felt his heart clench. As if a dam inside him had broken, he felt every kind of negative emotion toward the woman before him.
"Chasing for the Harpies. Going to the World Cup. Winning," she replied sadly, guiltily. "I know we used to talk about this before, Harry, even when we were back at Hogwarts. Before our engagement-"
"Will you be alright here, without me?" he asked her, voice layered with concern.
"Well, what I want to say is that... I love the privacy, but I would also love for the whole world to know how much I.. er, well, for them to know about us."
While the women exchanged their version of pleasantries (which was mostly high-pitched sounds and some squealing and jumping in between, as far as Harry could tell), the three men stood awkwardly near the Floo.
Now, they had those late night fire calls, the many times they had each succumbed to crossing over to the other's hearth for several hours - not that anyone else really knew - the owls, the nudges and the two seconds wherein they could have an entire conversation with just a glare...
Weasley sighed. "Not sure. The researchers over at Tracking got some information from the cross comparison of the two letters."
"I know that I'm not exactly in the running to be mother-of-the-year," Ginny said sadly, "but I really do want to be here for them, but I don't know what else I can do."
They hadn't yet taken Scorpius to France, though they did have a family villa there - they both agreed that having such a young child would merely be troublesome to attend to when their concentration needed to be on something else. It was why Draco left his wife to those events that he no longer had the patience for after having Scorpius. Now that they were to go on a publicized diplomatic visit to another country as a family, they had to adjust and reassess how they would go about it. Playing the high society husband and wife would not be enough in this circumstance. They needed to devise the best manner of portraying themselves in the limelight, in order to gain approval and support within their social circle. So much work always went behind keeping up within the hierarchy.
around him would permit trustworthy family and friends. This probably meant that Malfoy himself was unwittingly included in the list, being a former schoolmate, current acquaintance and now a confidential colleague. It also meant, Harry realized, that he was trustworthy.
Hermione scrunched her brows and bit her lip, an expression that Draco knew from Harry meant she was going through information in her head at the speed of light.
"Damn it, I forgot!" Draco heard Harry mutter to himself.
"It's true, she has," Harry agreed. "I mean, we barely got to see each other sometimes, but she did try her best. I'd sometimes wake up with her gone, but with James taken care of and breakfast prepared for me." He met eyes with Ron. "But sometimes I think that it's become a bit lopsided. Like I've had to take over much of Jamie's care because Ginny has a lot of other stuff to manage first, and I don't want the kid growing up in such an environment. And I can't always depend on Andy or Molly, seeing as they all have their hands full with their own grandchildren."
"I want so much more for us, Gin," Harry whispered. "We can have so much now! Without any of the public scrutiny, without the stupid Ministry in the way, we can finally have a real future together."
Harry had looked back on that day so many times, analyzing it the same way he dissected Pensieve memories on the job. He used every angle and perspective, turned the scene around a million times in his head, and he still couldn't decide how he felt about it all.
The first thing Draco noticed that morning was that he was definitely not at the Manor.
Honestly, Draco could barely pay any attention to his Mother's enchantment because he was too ecstatic once she had said the name out loud. None of her other words mattered after that.
"Oh, darling, I thought something had happened to you!" He pulled her away, hands still clutching her arms, so that they were facing each other. "Tell me, is everything alright? Are you feeling alright?"
"Yeah," George piped up, "if only you had thought of this back when you were at Hogwarts, eh?"
Stunned, Draco couldn't prevent himself from gaping uncouthly. "What?"
Draco felt his heart stop. Maybe they finally had enough to move forward and find out the identity of the person harassing him. "Is it a lead?"
Ginny laughed and carefully guided Hermione towards the nearest couch. When they settled, she sauntered over to Harry and hugged him. Harry welcomed the affection - Merlin knew how much he missed actually having her around again. What was the whole point of being engaged if he couldn't bask in the affection of his intended?
Harry beamed. "I realized that I needed more bedrooms, since Teddy stays with me often enough, and I wanted a spare bedroom for when someone else has to kip here, probably Ron and Hermione."
Sadly, Hugo had been a completely different case. Harry's eyes flicked across the room, looking at Molly, who was handling a tiny bundle in her arms. Hugo, fast asleep, was at least much better now, but had been in critical condition when he had been born. The Healers had to put him in a magical incubation charm for several weeks until he became stable enough to be brought home. Ron and Hermione had stayed in a private ward at St. Mungo's the entire time, and were glad when they were finally given clearance to take their baby home.
. Ron had long since given up, pulling Ernie up to cover for him as they did the final cataloguing of all 77 active Aurors, 45 reserves, 29 cross-department consultants and 13 independent consultants, with the non-Aurors taking up an additional three weeks.
A second later, they were gracefully stepping into the ballroom of the Ministry.
This time, there were some in the audience who shuffled uncomfortably. Many present were loyal subscribers to the Daily Prophet, of course, and had believed the rumors.
"I'll handle this quickly, Scorp," he said to his son, (ignoring the inner voice that was reminding him how much Potter would make fun of him if he found out). He shifted the child to his other hip in case he might become uncomfortable after being held in one position for so long. "Then we can go back to looking at all the lovely birds like we planned, alright?"
Harry thought.
It had taken months of toil, of winning her with the right kind of thoughtful gifts, of exchanging witty banter. Of lowering his pride sometimes, of impressing her family, and gaining her trust. More importantly, it took most of that time to properly negotiate the possible future with her, to ensure that they both had a clear goal in mind. If they were to be allies, as was the desired point of view amongst traditional purebloods, they needed to establish their connection and project it into the future. The strongest marriages were the ones that developed from a steadfast alliance and grew into a deeper understanding. Draco saw that in his parents when he was young, and he desired it for himself.
with them, and want to take them home. What then?"
: (writes notes) And he just thought of offering you a new office out of nowhere?
"But?"
The second thing that immediately caught his attention was Potter's amused expression as he handed him a steaming cup of tea.
Draco had stayed true to his word; the moment he had gone home, he went straight to the Manor's library, which was home to the vast collection of rare and antique tomes collected and treasured by his ancestors over the centuries. His Mastery of Potions was not just because of his industrious academic and professional endeavors, but also highly dependent on the amazing store of knowledge his family had provided him with at his very home. It was one of the reasons that he was able to exceed the expectations of any potioneer. While many more practitioners now relied on the newest and most updated information for innovation, Draco had appreciated early in life that there was a lot of old theory to be found in older works, which to him opened up even more possibilities for Potions to be learned and relearned, understood and reworked, straight from the oldest masters and their personal notes. He never divulged this secret of his that Severus had taught him well - progress could always be gained by looking back and looking at the roots. That's how he elected to approach Potter's mystery recipe.
Harry gaped at the blond.
"Because… Astoria Malfoy's gone too, sir. Ms. Black just alerted us."
Harry realized too late that he had had only Quidditch to keep him in shape, and even that depended largely on the make of his broom rather than the fitness level of his own body. With an internal cringe, the brunet decided his endurance would fare better if they had hand to hand combat training - he spent nearly ten years being someone's else's punching bag, after all.
Harry sighed into the wooden surface of the table. "I just hope Astoria doesn't mind giving her magical consent. Every second counts."
"What difference would that make?" Astoria asked worriedly, turning her large, teary eyes to her mother in law.
Draco eyed him furtively. "Pardon?"
Harry shook his head. "I don’t really fancy any big parties, actually. I'm fucking relieved that Ron and Hermione and Ginny and everyone are away right now, which means I can spend the day how I want to, for a change," he said with a smile.
"And how would that make you exponentially happier than you usually are?" Narcissa queried with curiosity. "You go out on such endeavors with Blaise and Pansy, though without the same results. Or perhaps there was something different about Misters Potter and Weasley?"           It was then that Draco realized that Potter's wards would not allow him to share what was the most probable reason for his inexplicable happiness. Not that he would have betrayed the trust, of course. He was a man of his word, and he felt like it was something he would have to prove to his new friends, if that was what they were now. Surely being invited into the
"Thank you," Potter offered suddenly.
"Darling!" Astoria called out. "Please, would you handle those for me?"
Hermione was confused. She frowned at Draco, as if it were his fault that she had never heard this before. "What do you mean?"
Draco told her all about the chance meeting at Flourish and Blotts, and with a slight flush, related to her his frustrations at not being able to make an impression on her before she had disappeared. He saw her eyes soften as his story unfolded, and that was when he knew that his own face had betrayed his emotions, his desperate need to find Astoria.
Gerard's laugh reverberated above Draco's voice. "This man has lost his mind! You played him well, Astoria!"
: And this new approach of yours, has it worked successfully, in practice?
Draco leant further into the armchair he had chosen, and thought about what he wanted to know most. He felt so lost, since Potter had once again given him too much to think about (the prat!) but everything he had said about raising children had struck a chord in Draco's heart.
had materialized in front of him.
Her hands grazed his chest and continued downwards, where she felt his growing bulge. Harry looked her in the eye and saw the fire in them. "I've missed you," she said, as if in answer to a silent question. The kisses continued then, alternating between soft and sweet to hard and deep, making Harry almost forget that they were in his chair, cramped behind his desk, with a sleeping baby just a few feet away.
"I'm sure Hermione will figure it out," Harry said soothingly, patting the blonde softly on the arm. Being in the same couch made it a lot easier for them to comfort each other more efficiently.
Malfoy didn't seem to notice anything strange about Harry having James almost all of the time, and if he did, he never pointed it out, to Harry's immense relief. By the time James had fallen asleep once more, exhausted from being manhandled by an overeager Slytherin, Harry had tucked him into bed and both he and Malfoy had pretty much passed out.
"Out with it!" Weasley exclaimed with impatience. "Why?"
Harry shook his head. "No. Odair called, said she'd been away for long enough."
"That's what I mean, dear. Hermione has always been quite the lively girl. She hadn't been exposed to rigorous and tiring activities, she only went between the home and the Ministry. But the difference was that she went ahead and put most of herself in her work- Oh, it's not a bad thing, Harry!" she said when he had been about to defend Hermione. "I fully support her career ambitions, of course! But the way she involves herself in her work affects her in such a negative way. Ron tells me that she tends to bring home whatever foul mood she picked up throughout the day. That kind of stress was bound to have affected Hugo, because she was exhausting herself in every way.
"We'll leave your mother to handle those big, bad, boring bureaucrats," Draco whispered conspiratorially to his son, who merely giggled. "And we can have all the fun we want!"
: Er... I'm hoping this qualifies within your privacy allocation, but our readers wish to ask more about your relationship to Ms. Weasley.
"I know this is also personal, and I would not deign to impose on your privacy, but we are all intent on keeping your baby perfectly healthy and to deliver him or her with the least amount of complications. I need both of you to be more careful."
He let out a drawn out sigh and melted into the couch. Teddy climbed up onto the cushions and tugged on Harry's arm with the insistence of children his age.
It was for this reason that Harry had been relieved that Ginny could be home the entire time that he had to go to the Ministry for seven weeks. It was a refreshing change (and quite an eye opener) for both of them, which only added to the improved dynamic between the two former lovers.
"Ginny, honestly, I don't see that happening anymore."
He shook his head, “What is your greed? We all have suffered those emotions, those feelings at one point or another. No one is free of them. What is your greed?”
Their quiet talk was interrupted by an increasing amount of screams and the sight of thousands of wizards and witches running away from the campsite, towards them, away from the ever increasing fire.
“Can you, very calmly, explain that to her, and very strongly explain that she can’t freak out and make it a scandal otherwise it will get worse? Can you convince her to go and convince Narcissa to leave Lucius, for the safety of them both?” Harry remembered the second timeline, remembered what happened to him when Draco died and nodded, “For the safety of all of us.”
He knew of the Ravenclaw girl with the weird earrings because Ginny had introduced her to her brothers as the girl on her wrist. They made fun of it for a while before taking a good look at them and realizing that Luna Lovegood was perfect for Ginny Weasley. Lovegood had some 30-year-old reporter that her father was in a feud on her opposing wrist, and Ginny had someone named Cain, or so he believed.
Harry read the note,
“I knew he was controlling me. Manipulating me…” He sighed, seeming irritated with the next words, “Conditioning me… But I kept telling myself the same lie mum tells herself.”
Harry was almost gone from Malfoy’s sight when he yelled, not aggressively, purely confused, “Did you do it?”
He sighed internally, finishing the knot and looking at the door between them, “How much did you see?”
“I never said he freaked out, he just looked at me like I was less than dirt and dragged Lefty away.”
“And?”
Draco didn’t reply.
“Harry, breathe.”
“He faked his death to blame it on Sirius and get everyone off his trail. He’s the one who gave my parents' location to V- You-know-who. And Sirius was the only one who knew the truth, so,” Harry shrugged like the actions of Petigrew were an obvious turn of events, “Fake your death and blame it on the only one who can call you out for the death of the Potters.”
My mother sent me to my room as soon as he burst in bitching about how I was making him look bad. Didn’t stop him from coming to my room later, dragging me to the bathroom and fruitlessly trying to ‘clean’ away his name from my skin… Sometimes the way he looks at me is like he’d wished I’d never been born. Sometimes the way he looks at mum is like he hates her for failing to give him the magnificent son he’d wanted. Sometimes the way he looks at me… is like he’s contemplated cutting off my arms, but the only thing stopping him is the lack of alibi or excuse as to why.”
“What if he were like that with Hermione?” Harry retorted, not looking away from the menace.
Harry opened his mouth but nothing came out, though the quirk in his eyebrows let Draco know he was confused.
“Because I asked him to.”
Before entering Ron paused, “Are we going to tell Hermione?”
“You two need to tell her to knock before coming in.” Dean warned, pointing a threatening finger at the both of them.
“If life was that easy… Ugh.” Harry didn’t know how to finish that sentence, he didn’t know if he would ever know how to finish that sentence. He doesn’t know what easy is.
“One class. You can’t keep yourself controlled for one class. It’s just an hour Harry!”
Harry nodded, picking up his cloak, “You shouldn’t let anyone damage your face. It’s too pretty for that.”
“What does that note say?”
“Nothing. What do you want to eat? If you want I could go downstairs and ask for a proper meal for you.”
“I couldn’t sleep.”
Hermione waved her hand, dismissing his dismissal, “You need to figure out the egg. So instead of seething with rage at the realization that other people find… Lefty attractive, how about you figure out the egg?”
Ron laughed in his face, not sugar-coating how ridiculous what Harry was saying sounded like to him, “What makes you think that?”
Should I change the rating to mature?
It’s been hours and Draco probably doesn’t remember what they said prior to him falling asleep. But Harry hasn’t slept just thinking about it.
Harry was now determined to fix that. Next year. Now he had to go to the Dursleys and have a god awful summer by their side.
“I found a book, last year, in the library in my… in the Manor. The history of Hogwarts and how it came to be.”
Harry paused confused, before remembering not everybody knows, “Tom Riddle is Voldemort’s birth name. His real name.” Harry saw the realization and embarrassment in Draco’s face and he faintly smiled, “It wasn’t a bold assumption. It was a very well educated, if not a little too late, guess.” Harry paused, “When you said two stairs below someone could be liste-”
The trio continued walking until they reached the edge of the campsite, far away from any gossiping ears, where Harry’s secret could remain safe.
Meanwhile when Draco peaked out of his walls to meet that one ray of hope that was his promised soulmate… he found more disappointment. Harry himself would have made those walls thicker after that.
Harry has not actively done anything to change it either, all he’s done is convince himself that he won’t do something. But Harry still doesn’t know if there’s something else he does that could harm Draco, Harry doesn’t know the consequences of all these changes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded, “Anyway, err, when I got down to the main floor I encountered Left...ty? Lefty, and, err, we traded a few words. Lefty asked if I’d put my name in, I said I didn’t, h- Lefty seemed to believe, and… I can’t understand why that makes me happy.”
“I’m not going to enter screaming ‘look, I’m dancing with Draco Malfoy. Everyone look’. We’ll just do our own thing.”
By the time Hagrid’s class came along Harry had given Draco enough sideway glances and barely-there smiles that his roommates had noticed. And when Dean asked Harry if there was something up with Draco, and Seamus asked him if they had or were going to fight, Harry wanted to let Draco actually beat him up. If his roommates noticed, others are bound to have noticed which could lead to Lucius having questions. And that… not good.
“The original idea was to train Helena to take the place as the first Headmistress of Hogwarts. Out of the four heirs of the founders-”
By the time supper came most of the school knew not to address a single one of the Gryffindors for either they were irritated with teaching or being thought for hours or, were looking for any ear to goad about how great of a dancer they were and how quickly they learned. Plus two rumours had made quick work through the halls of Hogwarts and tables in the Great Hall;
“Can you make an effort?”
The trio had to rush breakfast and barely made it to class. Barely. Hermione would have murdered them both if they hadn’t.
"The one you're wearing now, even as we speak. And it appears you don't even realize."
He began to read the Prophet's front headline, and his lip curved up into half a smirk. Despite the call for more Potter news, the fickle public had decided to shed the spotlight on the most anticipated engagement of Draco Malfoy and Astoria Greengrass.
Finally, he heard Ron leaving the lockers and Harry immediately forgot his unprompted reflections because he noticed the time. "Fuck!" he cried. "You certainly took your time!" They hurried quickly out of the Ministry's Atrium, almost ran into the overlarge Floos, and simultaneously called out, "The Leaky Cauldron!" before vanishing in a puff of green smoke. In their hurry to leave, Ron and Harry didn't notice a pair of grey eyes watching them with curious amusement.
(See the end of the chapter for
Little Scorpius. That boy was going to be the death of him, he was absolutely sure of it.
"It's my fault, Harry!" Ginny cried out, face scrunched up. "I admit that, I know this is mostly my fault and I'm so sorry that I've fucked us up so badly without even knowing. I know that we've both sacrificed to make everything good for James, but you've been having to compromise more than I have, and only because you let me have the chance at my dreams. It's so stupid, I know," she was rambling now, "I keep chasing after what I want, but then I look back and realize that I've left everyone behind and I'm not part of the picture here anymore."
Hermione seemed to agree. "Wise move," she said. "This issue has already taken the magical community by storm, but so far, I'm sure the public will be treating this as more of gossip and hearsay than actual news."
Neither said anything about it, and they felt the magic dissolve between them. The fact that the invocation had even settled threw Draco off. Because it meant that they really fulfilled the requirements, most significantly the emotional connection and the intent to protect. It all felt so... intimate.
Harry couldn't help but groan again, and throw his arms upwards in defeat. "This, Harry," he told himself,
"Damn it, Potter, do I have to spell it out for you?! It doesn't matter how far away or for how long your Weaselette is gone. The wards only fail in two conditions, and worse if it's both: if the emotional connections of your magical cores aren't in sync anymore, or... if one's magic is unstable and fluctuating, such as during a very stressful pregnancy..."
"How could you be sure though?" Harry insisted.
"It's just the magic drain," she said, perhaps knowing where Harry's thoughts had taken him. He bowed his head in embarrassment, but she continued. "They're ready to see you now."
"No worries, your dad would probably kill me, too, so at least we'd still be proper mates in the afterlife, probably have a nice conversation while waiting for the train to come."
: Well, I did have some help from Ron and Harry-
But he still didn't say anything, of course. He just hoped that she changed her mind very soon. Apparently, Narcissa was not the only one to feel the fluttery sense of excitement at the thought of expecting a child into the Malfoy clan.
"This ‘thing' that you speak of is my child," Draco said smugly, "future Malfoy heir and new Prince of Slytherin, so show him the respect he is due."
The thought of holding back wasn't even an option. For the rest of the night, he allowed himself to lay everything out to his old enemy.
"I didn't
After the welcome lull over the weekend, Harry thought it was both invigorating and vexing to be around everyone else again. Granted, he had a lot of years to get used to the non-committal chatter expected from Ron and Hermione; the stifling yet warm coddling from Molly and Arthur; and the entertaining talks with Ginny whenever she had something to rant about.
He was still in the middle of deciding if he would prefer being called 'Father' or allow a more informal 'Daddy' when his train of thought was interrupted by the sound of the conversation between his wife and mother as they tried to negotiate and change each other's opinions. With a pang, he remembered that Astoria had just openly said no.
"What can I do to get rid of your irrational fears?" he finally asked, weary of the discussion already.
At that very second, Molly met his gaze and started. She motioned for him to come closer, so he crossed the room and settled himself next to her.
Harry sighed. "Look, I don't want to have either of you feel like you need to take sides, but.. I just wanted to talk to you first. I haven't even thought much about... everything that's happened."
"Oh," Draco said. "Well, it would have been highly irresponsible for me to leave you all hanging with nothing to work with while I was away."
"So, Ron and Hermione couldn't get here immediately... and they sent you to cover for them and keep me company?"
"Enough, Gerard," Astoria scolded, finally turning toward her partner. "I still do not understand why you had to go this far. Everything was fine until you started sending the threats."
Harry chuckled. "Yeah, didn't think we'd ever have it in us to be all… domestic and shit. Pardon the French."
As he straightened out the collar of his dress robes for the fifty sixth time that hour, he glanced at Astoria, who had been looking at him with a patronizing look on her face. He rolled his eyes. "Yes, yes, I'm ready, darling. Shall we?"
"Thanks, I guess?"
Ron was the first to come back to his senses after the surprise arrival of his sister, jumping up to welcome her. "Bloody hell! What the fuck are you doing here?!" She eagerly walked into his embrace, eyes still trained on Harry, who seemed to get over his shock as well.
"You are an amazing woman," he told her sincerely.
"I am allowed to have a vested interest regardless of whether I am a Potions master or not."
"You're not even half as clever as you've led other wizards to believe, eh?" the man said with a smirk.
"Sorry, Ernie," Harry shouted from where he was. "Business matters. Auror Stone needs you to sign this. There are three copies. Mind doing it now, and as quick as you can?"
It bothered him though, that both the Potty and the Weasel had looked absolutely miserable. Draco had realized that the moment he saw them, which was a big part of why he had approached at all. Sly old Slytherin in him, he was drawn in by his curiosity, and his need to gain information from any and every source. Malfoy training and all. But he couldn't shake the feeling that he felt terrible for his former enemies.
"What are you, twelve?"
The man - Gerard, apparently - scoffed. To Draco, he seemed like a child being admonished by the headmistress.
He still had Malfoy's letter clutched in his hand. He had no idea why the blond's happiness had caused him to think of such painful thoughts, but he nevertheless reminded himself not to focus on the negative. Ginny was coming home in two weeks, and he couldn't wait until they could be with each other again. He felt like a piece of him had gone with her, and he ached for its return.
"Potter used Voldemort's memories... to save us?"
Ginny laughed weakly. "I'm sure you could break down all the walls but let's hope it doesn't come to that. I'll be fine, and so will he," she gently slid her free hand across her belly. "We'll be fine. We're in good hands," she added with emphasis, indicating Rosewood.
it works," Ron warned. "Key word here is
Hermione bit her lip at Harry's expression. "I - I can't -"
"It's the Pureblood version of a marriage contract," Ron explained. "It's very different from the one between me and Mione. Our family doesn't follow those old traditions, see."
The girl at the till recognized him, despite his being absent for the last half year. She immediately flicked her wand, casting what Draco already knew to be a special Summoning Charm. Within seconds, a small mountain of books had assembled themselves on the nearest table for Draco's perusal. The service never failed to impress him, and he gave her a quick nod before burying his nose in the topmost tome.
. It was all very personal, a delicate twining of magical cores, initially reserved only for the closest of family.
"Nonsense, dear!" Mrs. Weasley admonished. "Don't take it the wrong way, I simply meant to say how horrid some people had been to you over the years!" She continued to grumble about reporters sticking their nose in his business as she fussed over the breakfast being served. Harry shook his head and let her go on her tirade. It was true that the Weasleys were the most harangued for "keeping the Chosen One from the rest of the world". In a way, Harry thought, this day was also for them to celebrate.
Harry gave Ron the entire week off to take care of Hermione while she remained at St. Mungo's. To her immense displeasure, the Healers had crossly explained to her that this pregnancy could be more difficult than Hugo's had been, and that they wanted her to be more careful this time around. Careful, of course, meant that she had to take a leave from work, and had to stay home as much as possible. Harry figured his friends needed that extra week just to get all of that sorted.
Draco snorted. "Just a bit, wouldn't you say? Although I did appreciate hearing your rather violent rant. I've never felt more special to anyone before."
Hermione looked ready to straight up sue the school, piling on them how illegal this was and how they should not let Harry compete.
Harry looked down from the balcony he was standing on, waiting for the stairs, finding Malfoy glaring up at him, “I could ask the same about you.”
Harry shrugged, “Making an effort?”
“You’re asking Harry to manipulate and guilt Diggory into giving him the answer?”
Lucius ignored him, nodding to Mal-... Draco and walking away.
Harry groaned feeling his neck crack and reposition each bone as he properly sat up from the hunched down position he had fallen asleep in. He looked down and saw Draco had been smarter than him and at some point during the night had repositioned himself with his head resting on Harry’s lap. Maybe that was the reason why Harry never really laid down on the floor, the selfless yet selfish idiot that he is.
“People are not ready for the truth.”
Harry sighed, internally whining as he dropped the warm afghan and shuffled into his boots, the cold outside making the space outside his bed too cold. His socks were not warm enough to warm the cold shoes and every step felt like a wake-up call. He tried to return a favor, going to Dean and pushing him properly on his bed and pulling the blanket on him before closing the curtain, and as he turned around he saw Seamus giving him a sleepy smile and a droopy thumbs up before dropping his arm and going back to sleep. He’d never noticed before Seamus and Dean slept with the curtains half open, at least the ones facing one another, so he turned back to Dean and opened his a bit before leaving the room.
Malfoy shuffled allowing Harry to see a bit of his face, enough to see him nodding, “I was actually going to ask why are you still with them. Why are you with them in the first place.”
Harry nodded, “What time is it?”
“Isn’t it a little early to be sneaking around?”
Harry turned back to Draco as Ron whispered, “The bruised lip was probably a too aggressive slap. His cane would’ve broken his lip and it would be hard to aim for such a place. And a punch would’ve bruised it worse.”
Becoming easily irritable, frustrated or moody. Insomnia. Increase or decrease in desires to eat. Feeling bad about yourself. Inability to focus. Poor judgment. Being pessimistic. Avoiding responsibilities.
Ron scoffed, baffled, “He’s embarrassed? Shy? I didn’t know Malfoys could feel those emotions.”
Everyone stopped, no one ignorant to the evident anger in Harry’s voice.
“I then asked him to leave his… Family.”
Harry nodded, “Ice. It should help with the pain. And believe me or not, pineapples. A great snack that will help ease the bruising.”
“It never is.”
He stopped and turned around, the weight of his sleepless night falling on him too quickly and too hard. Why did it bother him so much that Malfoy was asking him this? He shook his head, “I know you’ll never do it, but you can ask Hermione or Ron. I never left their side since the goblet came out, so they can vouch for me. I didn’t put my name in the goblet of fire.”
In truth, he never slept, and got up to try and get some information of where the kitchen was and if maybe there was something that could wake him up. The other two options were go to Snape and ask him for a potion; no, or go to Pomfrey, ask her for a potion and sit there for two hours as she scolded him for his bad sleeping habit; hard no.
Diggory nodded, “Good luck.”
Hermione huffed at Ron, “Malfoy is like a deer if this past few weeks are any proof of it. You need to approach it slowly and apprehensively or you scare it away. And that’s exactly what you did Harry. You scared him away. Now how am I gonna fix this fuck up?”
“Why?” Arthur asked, turning to look at Ron, confused.
Well… that could have gone… Nope, went as well as it could with both their personalities to consider.
Harry nodded. “I-...” Harry looked around, noticing the nausea never left, just shifted in intensity depending on the situation, “I also thought I was gonna die.”
Harry knew he said that too aggressively, he knew that Ron did not mean to anger him, he was just worried. He thought about apologizing, but then Ron pulled a piece of paper from his pocket, covered front and back with words Harry could not understand at this angle, and smiled at Harry, nodding in understanding. And then Harry decided, ‘fuck him’.
Harry looked at the paper, it’s not a long list, it should be easy to find in the cupboard, and considering Hermione was probably gonna drag him around with this potion, it's only fair he got the ingredients.
He sighed, “Peter was a coward.”
ENJOY!
Harry shook his head. Ron nodded, “Breakfast then?”
He tried to turn to look only to find Ron blocking his view, glaring at him.
“My name is Moody. Alastor Moody. I’m not here to make friends or to make you feel better, I’m here because Dumbledore asked me to.”
Draco is quiet.
“You told Diggory about the dragon.”
“Crouch- what?”
Well, not really jewelry. To be honest, they were just scrappy wrists wraps made from some of Dudley’s very large clothes. There was material to spare and he could still wear those shirts, as long as he ripped them from the bottom.
“Alright, so following the departure of Salazar the founders agreed to establish a singular head of the school, and after much discussion agreed that Helena was the most prepared out of all of the heirs to take the role. But in the bastardization of the Romeo and Juliet story, Agnelious Whitaker, one of Salazar’s ex-students and a follower of his beliefs in purity, fell in love with Helena Ravenclaw. Unfortunately for her, they had each other on their wrists, so he believed it had been prophesied for them to be together and attempted to force it when she rejected him due to his beliefs.”
Draco didn’t appear to believe Harry, but he allowed Harry’s fingers to reach his cheek. Just from the graze of a touch Harry could feel the hot blood that had accumulated on his cheek and was slowly leaving the impact zone. He could feel the sharp bones underneath the tense and slightly swollen muscles. Muscle memory told Harry to be softer, that even it being yellow and almost gone, it still hurt. Much more considering it’s close impact to his eyes.
Harry paused, and took a step back.
Voldemort was his enemy.
When Draco replied his tone was quiet, like he realized he was overreacting and wanted to prove he was in control, “What does that have to do with anything?”
Harry was now quiet as he looked back, trying to find a ray of light so he wouldn’t have to tell a boy who’s been told his entire life muggles are bad that muggles… are bad, because they’re not… But it’s hard. “I… can’t remember ever feeling happy with them. I maybe smiled and felt joy for a few seconds with them, but they… they would take it away quickly. I think they believed I was not worthy of being happy. I was beneath them.”
Harry shrugged, “Lefty said that h-... that Lefty had guessed as much. That someone sabotaged it. And everything seemed to be going well, we were having a normal conversation, but then…” Harry sighed, realizing that he’d simply had had a mood swing at the worst time possible, “I got irrational and asked Lefty if h- fuck, if Lefty’s father had anything to do with it.”
Harry looked up and half his pride left him. He was a few inches too short to reach the jar, and if he attempted to do it by jumping, odds were that he would knock others down, and he really did not want a fight with Snape.
Draco nodded and changed the subject back to debating how much of an asset or a liability Harry would’ve been if he had been in Slytherin. Harry was debating liability. Draco was trying to convince him otherwise as though he could talk to Dumbledore now and change houses.
Draco huffed, sort of laughing but not seeming to want to put an effort to do so, “Church, the worst book club.”
Draco shrugged.
Harry stared, unsure of how to react, a frown on his face as he looked from Ron to Hermione who was frozen by the door, mouth hanging open. “O-... Ok.”
Harry sighed and dropped dramatically on Neville’s bed, needing some space to think and talk about this. Harry smiled emphatically at the pages of notes adorning the ceiling of Neville’s bed, mixes of Herbology notes and scribbles of encouragement. He should give Neville a few more. “I don’t know. I asked him if he trusted me like ten times, each time he interrupted me, each one being better than the last. He saw my wrists, I respected him and didn’t see his. He rewarded me for that.” Harry sighed, a smile bruising his cheeks, “I don’t know.”
Harry stumbled on air, startled out of his unconscious angry trance, as he glared at the boys walking ahead. He looked to his side to see Ginny and Hermione, both looking confused at his anger. He guessed he hasn’t really done that much work really to defuse the hatred on this side either. So they don’t understand why he’s bothered by the shit-talk.
“I’ve gotten nothing out of hiding it. Nothing bad!” Harry smiled, “But nothing good. Just a limbo of nothingness where I never taken step forward or backwards- No, I’ve taken a few steps backwards. But never forward.”
Silence followed as Harry had nothing to add. Draco did.
After a sigh Hermione shrugged, “It’s her life Ron, if she says it's okay, then don’t impose your discomfort on her.”
