“You do think he’s changed, then? You think he’s different than his father? That he’s not a Death Eater?”
And Tonks had sought him out in the club. Why? She’d befriended him, she’d seduced him—he remembered, with a flash, the oily man she’d met in Hogsmeade—the way Draco had taunted that he thought he had everyone pegged—
'You mean, before you see my father,' Malfoy snipes, but after a moment, his arm creeps around Harry.  Immediately, Harry thinks of what Ron would say, finding the two of them spooned together under a heap of blankets, and starts shaking with silent laughter.
“Just let him try,” Ginny said fiercely, before anyone else could reply. There was a murmur of agreement, and Jack slapped Natalie a bit too heartily on the shoulder.
“Um,” Harry said, “Tonks, I’m not sure I—" and then there were footsteps and a sudden flaring of the gloomy lights along the hall, and he was being smothered in Hermione’s hair. She smelled like dust and lilacs and sniffed a little when she pulled away from him, saying like a copy of Mrs. Weasley, “Oh, Harry, you feel thin, haven’t you been eating?” Behind her, Ron was standing with his hands in his trouser pockets, lanky and uncomfortable, and when Harry looked up at him, he flashed Harry such a familiar grin that all the knots in Harry’s stomach pooled and dissolved.
Malfoy's face goes pale; Harry can almost see his muscles tense up, and with them, the whole kitchen atmosphere.  'I don't know where—'
'Yeah,' Harry says, 'it is.  You know what happens in November?'  Malfoy is staring at him as if he's gone mad, so he answers his own question.  'The first Quidditch match of the year.  Typically Gryffindor versus Slytherin, isn't it?'
'What's the matter with that?' Ron demanded, finally distracted from the magazine Seamus was showing him under the table. 'Who needs more of them, anyway?'
'I look hideous,' Malfoy continues, 'and now you're making me trudge in the cold so I can sit on a cliff while you go to Azkaban, which you also didn't tell me.  There I was, believing that I could go on in with you, and see my father, and of course you neglect to mention that I have to wait on the other side until about ten minutes ago—'
Maybe Hermione was right. Because Harry had the feeling, as he sat there in the middle of a noisy common room and thought about the boy he had once hated so simply, that whatever this was, it had the potential to hurt him more than any jibe about his mother ever had.
Outside the tent, it's not windy, just chilly; Harry stands there with one hand in his pocket, gnawing on the piece of bread he's holding.  He'd planned on getting to Azkaban that night and camping at the transfer point, then crossing to the prison in the morning.  Now, it's at least another hour's walk, if not more, if Hermione's calculations are right.
Draco rolled his eyes. "I'm not friendless, you know. I've got owls of my own. Sit down, Potter. You're up, I'm up, so you might as well."
When Hermione finally gets Malfoy into the kitchen, with a combination of force and flattery, the result is nothing any of them, least of all Malfoy, can stomach.  It smells a bit like boiled cabbage, but has the appearance of sawdust floating in water, and after tossing his portion out the window, Harry makes himself a plate of toast and carries it upstairs.
"Thanks a lot, Potter," he sneered, whirling to see Harry poised at the entrance. "You threw me off."
But before she could leave the table, Professor McGonagall came down the aisle towards them, seizing Seamus Finnigan's dirty magazine and Vanishing it without slowing her pace at all. She stopped beside Hermione.
'I hope you don't mind,' Andromeda said, gesturing to her cigarette. 'It's a newly acquired habit. Ted's fault, really. I used to scold him for it, so he had packs hidden all over the house. I've been finding them everywhere. I took it up and now I can't quit. Strange justice, I suppose.'
“A friend?” Hermione echoed again, alarmed. “Hagrid, I’m not so sure it’s the best idea to bring another giant here, especially not—well, you said yourself, they’re not exactly friendly, are they?”
'Yeah, yeah,' Harry grumbled; he knew how well Ginny flew and had been looking forward to working with her again. He would also be lying if he said he didn't have thoughts of Ginny and Dean winding up on opposing teams and breaking up in the ensuing rivalry. 'Go on, then, Malfoy.'
In the cell opposite Lucius, with his hands around the bars as if the very sight of Harry is akin to freedom, is the squat, dirty wizard Harry recognizes as Mundungus Fletcher.
Ron, however, had got a hold of it, and ignored Hermione’s protesting as he flattened out the paper. “Look here, Harry,” he exclaimed, “it says you were ‘betrayed by Granger’s fickle longings,’ ha ha! Here, d’you reckon . . . oh, yeah, right here! ‘Granger has taken up with Hogwarts student Anthony Goldstein, a chubby Ravenclaw. “She’s certainly not with him for his looks,” one Hogwarts student told me, sniggering. Many speculate that Hermione Granger’s own stellar marks are a direct result of her new associations with the House known for its wit—'"
'We were just talking about him, you know,' Pansy said, her tone a fraction warmer. 'Vince. He had this hopeless crush on Tracey, remember? Everyone knew about it, he always carried her books for her and cut up her Potions ingredients.'
'Potter,' Malfoy repeated icily, 'I don't know what your head is doing in my fireplace, but if you know what's good for you, you'll get it out. Now.'
“I’m not the one who thinks everything revolves around me!” Malfoy shouted. “You keep reciting all these names like you’re personally responsible when there’s nothing you could have done! You’re not responsible for every single person in the world, Potter, and if you’re big-headed enough to think so—"
'I know, but it belongs to the goblins.' Harry sighed: he had received a ten-page letter from Hermione during her time in Australia, her cramped scribble arguing fervently that he needed to return the sword at once. 'I told Griphook—he's a goblin—I told him he could have it. I think I ought to give it over willingly.'
Harry's mouth dropped open. 'He started it!' he exclaimed. 'I never—I'm not using him!' He struggled to recall Malfoy's words. 'It's a mutually beneficial arrangement.'
“Are you just going to stand there?” Draco said irritably, after a moment, and Harry reddened and started to undo his own trousers. His cock was painfully hard and he moaned under his breath when his wrist brushed against it as he pushed down the waistband of his pants.
'Hermione!' Harry yelped, sure his face was now bright red. 'Malfoy was just asking me about, um, the restorative properties of, of armadillo bile!'
Flitwick, who had apparently been appointed Deputy Headmaster, tottered up to the stool with the Sorting Hat in hand; the Hat, while still intact, was charred from Voldemort's fire and as it had already been dirty and patched, it looked very much the worse for wear. Meanwhile, Flitwick was so short that he had to use a charm to levitate the Hat onto the stool. This done, he stood back and beamed, and a moment later, the Hat's brim split open and it began to sing.
Remus looked thoughtful but not entirely surprised. “Quite a bit, I’d say,” he said at last. “You’ve certainly got her temper. And Lily could never stand for anything being unjust; she’d like Hermione a lot, I think. She was very—" He seemed to be struggling. “Alive. Vivid. I’m sorry, Harry, I don’t know how to put it better.”
It was an odd kind of outing; they didn't speak once, just circled the pitch together, until the threat of clouds became a cloud-cover, and it began to rain too hard for flying. At last, Harry shouted, 'Enough, I'm going in!'
Harry leaned his head back, rubbing his thumb over the slit in a smear of precome and then worked his fist around his cock, lapsing into a rhythm. His jaw felt sore, his mouth still strange and sticky though he'd backed off before Malfoy had come. He had his gaze trained on his knees, but out of the corner of his eye he could still see Malfoy's expensive shoes and the cuff of his trousers. When he could not help the huff of breath he let out as he jerked his fist faster, Malfoy chuckled.
“No,” Harry admitted, though he was more worried about what Snape had seen of his memory of Tonks. What was it she had said to him? No one could get in trouble if they didn’t get caught? Well, if Snape saw any more, they were both in danger of getting caught, and Snape would not be one to allow Harry Potter to get out of trouble.
'Oh?' Harry said, prodding a clump of grass with the toe of his trainer. It was oddly unsurprising that Luna paid attention to Binns in her dreamlike way, snatching up bits of information here and there. He wondered if Hermione would be impressed or irritated.
"I'm not trying to take anything from you," Harry said, patiently, as if he were coaxing a spitting cat or a child in the middle of a tantrum. "I didn't know. I'm sorry all your stuff's been taken—"
'Where are we?' he demanded again. His mind was rapidly conjuring images of Blibbering Humdingers and Crumple-Horned Snorkacks, or whatever else might cause such a noise.
The word niggled at him through his frantically scrambling thoughts, something familiar, something he remembered . . . He couldn’t go to Grimmauld Place; he would bet Bellatrix knew it inside and out. And the Ministry was out of the question. Perhaps he should go to Dumbledore, after all . . .
“It’s just a little fun,” she said, eyes twinkling, sliding up to him and putting her arms around his neck.
'And that's what you came here for,' Malfoy continued, his voice rising in pitch as he kept on. 'You're asking me to return to Hogwarts so I can be the only Slytherin in Slytherin House? Aside from three eleven year olds who are deserting to Hufflepuff?'
'I'm going to the shore,' Harry said, though this information had been unsolicited. 'I've never been, not properly. It's in Tinworth, in Cornwall, which Hermione says is a place where wizarding families congregate.'
He did not know if it was any comfort that Malfoy had not died for Harry, had not died for anything close. It was worse, perhaps, that Harry had thought he could protect Malfoy, only to find that he couldn't.
Ginny and Dean came back then, and Ron’s full attention was absorbed by watching Dean with suspicion, so Harry didn’t think of it again until he stepped into the Great Hall and saw Malfoy at the Slytherin table, reclined like a king. From the way he was smirking and carrying on, he certainly didn’t look like somebody who’d been having a “bad deal of it.” In fact, apart from his grossly exaggerated injuries, Harry had never seen him suffering in his life.
Just as he was about to go back to Gryffindor and send him an owl, the gargoyle slid back to reveal the open door. “I can assure you, Potter,” Professor McGonagall said dryly, standing there, “the password is not ‘Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum.’ However, I suppose you’d like to see the Headmaster . . . yes, yes, here you are.”
And they had not been friends, really. Malfoy had not seen fit to tell Harry about his trial. Harry did not even know his favorite color, or if he had truly flown into a helicopter when he was young, or whom else he had kissed.
? You've got to have something or it won't work. Didn't I tell you that? Don't tell me you've been practicing without even focusing on anything!"
'I almost got eaten by a giant snake that was hiding in somebody's dead body,' he said flatly. 'And I saw my parents' graves, and I broke my wand. You're right, it was awful.'
“She’s being held at the Ministry,” Remus interrupted, putting an awkward hand on Harry’s shoulder. “There will be a thorough investigation, of course. There is always the possibility of Imperius, and perhaps her relationship to the Black family was—"
'Good.  So, well, we have a place we're sort of using as headquarters, and from now on, we can meet there.  We'll change your Galleons to tell you where to go.  Oh, and if you mention the headquarter locations to anyone,' Hermione adds, voice steely, 'well, you remember Marietta.  It'll be worse.'
She trailed off, glancing at the doors to the castle, almost as if she expected Dumbledore to burst through them with a foolproof solution.
He had been joking, but Malfoy actually flushed. 'I may have,' he admitted, 'taken a bath with chocolate-scented shampoo. And eaten several . . . er, lots of it. I had Kreacher bring it to me, he checks up on me from time to time.'
The Ministry should have expected it, really, what with all the candles. There has been an influx of tapestries, new portraits settling in who gape at Harry and Draco as if they are rare specimens, and on the twentieth anniversary of the war's end, a line of people to light their own candles and nurse their own memories of their dead.
Tonks’s eyes were twinkling. “Oh, but if Oliver Wood of Puddlemere United Reserves thinks it’s a big deal, that’s quite a big deal indeed,” she said. “Anyway, I was out with Kirley the other night, and he seemed to think it was a good story—"
Harry leans down and trades the moonlight with Draco's lips, as cold as the heat that seared the edges of their paintings, and Draco's mouth is just as hot, as desperate, as the licking flames. Harry feels their edges, more real than anything in this painted, blurring world; their heat challenges his half-life existence, threatens the foundations of his world of canvas, and he doesn't mind because he is
said we had to do research!  And now you have a better plan?  What do you want us to do, charge around the countryside shouting Voldemort's name?'
'To my office?'  She frowns and blinks several times.  'Oh, I'm not using the Headmaster's office.  I'm in my room on the first floor, as usual.'
“I don’t doubt you see some side of Malfoy he’s never shown to us,” Hermione told him. Her voice was patient, but even she sounded skeptical. “I trust your judgment. I know you wouldn’t go chasing after Malfoy if he hadn’t done something to merit your attention. But I wonder if he could be hiding something. He
After a second, he can make out the words: it is Bill, who's saying quietly, 'I know you wanted a chapel in France, mermaids singing, fairy lights—I'm sorry you got chickens and my horrible brothers and whole months with Mum instead, not to mention all these scars—'
'They're the fake ones, Ron,' Hermione answers calmly, her eyes still flickering between the pile of coins and her small book.  'Anyway, where's Malfoy got to?  He was telling me about his family's Portkeys last week and I need to ask him a couple more questions.'
“Well, yeh never know,” Hagrid said, shrugging an enormous shoulder, “he gets lonely, Grawpy does, he’s always pleased ter see me. Livin’ in the forest like an animal, though’ maybe he’d like a friend.”
'I—' Harry begins, then glances down and sees Malfoy's book.  'What are you doing, reading about yourself?'
'Then you ought to owl Kingsley,' Hermione concluded. 'Let him know that this was a special case, and you don't want to know anything about the rest of the trials. Professor McGonagall can probably arrange to have your mail blocked as well, just in case. It's a simple Sorting spell.'
When Harry's head stopped spinning, he found himself staring at the wall opposite the fireplace, which was papered a fading green. The room was not one he recognized, and it was more empty than he expected: the wallpaper was paler in some places and not in others, as if large paintings had been only recently removed, and in the corner, a bookcase stood half-empty, the remaining tomes toppled over on one another.
, which sent his wand flying into the midst of Katie, Ginny, and Dean. His partners continued fighting without him as he scrambled to get it.
For once, Harry was inclined to agree. With the exception of Seamus’s dirty magazines, he’d never seen quite so much skin, especially not on someone he’d seen flinging spells with the best of them. She was dancing with somebody with a shaved head, shimmying in his arms, and something about it seemed so obscene that Harry had to tear his eyes away. When he looked back to Ron, he saw an unfamiliar girl leaning against the bar taking a sip from Ron’s Butterbeer, and Ron making frantic eyes at him that said, in no uncertain terms,
'So,' Hermione says tentatively, 'that's all, really, except—are we part of the Order now, or what do we call ourselves?'
Tonks shrugged a shoulder. “It’s all right. Yeah. He wrote to me every week I was at Hogwarts, you know? I’m closer with my mum, but she gets a little vague, sometimes, she tends to forget time passing – the war was hard on her. Anyway, he was the one I’d tell about all my mischief, and the hearts I’d broken, and all of it. He always said he was proud of me.”
'Us either,' Angelina says.  She gives him a wicked grin.  'Hey, Alicia, he's grown up nicely, hasn't he?'
Harry thought about entering Gringotts for the first time, and the way his mouth had dropped open at the sight. He had never even heard of a goblin, much less a Wizarding bank, and the lobby of Gringotts had bowled him over.
They sat up with him for as long as they could, more or less in silence. Hermione dropped off first, her bushy head pillowed on her arms, and less than half an hour later, Ron murmured sleepily, 'Only for a minute,' and dropped off as well.
'Who?' Harry said, baffled. His gaze flew to where Hermione was standing, chatting with Professor Flitwick. He found it incomprehensible that Ron could be jealous of Flitwick; apart from that moment, Harry hadn't seen Hermione speak to him outside of class since the beginning of the year. 'You can't mean—'
“We’ll start out rather simply,” Tonks said, drawing Harry’s attention back to the front of the room. “I want you all to cast a simple jinx on your partner—nothing advanced, mind you—and he or she will block it. Use any method you want, even
Later, after they cleaned up the mess and Draco irritably Vanished the broken glass in the corner of the room, Harry leaned up on one elbow and gazed down at Draco, who was beginning to look slightly drowsy. “Your hip is too bony,” Harry started to say, because it was digging into his thigh, only what really came out was, “I have to tell you something,” and he blinked.
When Lupin's eyes stop watering—'Dratted Floo powder,' he mutters—Harry changes the subject.  'Why'd you owl me about talking, anyway?  Do you have something on Zacharias?'
'How's—how's practices?' he asked after a long moment in which Cho did nothing but stare at their entwined fingers. On the back of Harry's hand, the faint scars of
'Oh,' says Harry, who may judge people too harshly once in awhile, but certainly doesn't want to admit it.  'Well, can we trust you?'
'No time like the present,' Ron says.  Neither he nor Harry point out that the time they are wasting now is even more precious than an extra hour of revision.  They just let her Apparate to get the food and slouch downstairs to wait, past the portrait of Mrs. Black, who never shrieks anymore.
'House lore?' Ron echoes.  'When've we ever sat around the fire telling bedtime stories about Godric Gryffindor?'
'Only Potter,' someone echoed with a derisive snort, and Harry smiled despite himself; Pansy was the only one who laughed like that. 'What have we become? Why, in my day, Harry Potter was the last person who could cross through that door.'
“Tea would be nice, thank you,” Hermione said, and Ron and Harry agreed, though all of them eyed Hagrid’s plate of rock-like lumps suspiciously. While he was putting his copper kettle on the fire, Harry took a rock-biscuit and gnawed on it, hoping he wouldn’t break a tooth, and said innocently,
“Have a happy Christmas yourself,” Harry added, “and the rest of your family. From Remus too, I mean. I hope Ginny likes the Puffskein.“
It was odd, and not all that welcome, the way that Pansy seemed to have appointed herself as the guardian of Malfoy's relationships. (Not that, Harry added privately, he was in some kind of relationship with Malfoy, because that certainly wasn't the case.) She found him after classes and in the halls just to slip him the Slytherin password, she began delivering messages from Malfoy, and oddest of all, she always seemed about to tell him something, when she would shake her head and just say, 'You'd better be there, Potter.'
'Because of me and Snape and your mum,' Harry retorted. 'Real smart, Malfoy. Take some initiative for once, won't you? You're better than somebody's pawn.'
"Well, you’re doing a splendid job of it," Malfoy shot back. "What do you think, you could defeat the Dark Lord by having a crying fit over everybody he'd killed?"
Harry nodded; he did not feel much like discussing it. 'Yeah, I did. Though Neville says it'll probably just pop out of the hat if someone needs it, but don't tell Hermione that. Hey, did you hear that Neville's going back to Hogwarts too?'
“Here,” Harry said, before he realized the words were leaving his lips, “ring them up, I’ll get them,” and he dug in his pocket for the coins he knew were there. The shop owner gave him a relieved look and immediately set about making change.
Harry glances behind him, where Malfoy is flicking peanut shells at Ron's head without Ron noticing.  In his hand, the package is warm and heavy, and he curls his fingers around it without thinking.  'Yeah,' he says, turning back to Aberforth.  'Yeah, I know.'
'I see.'  Scrimgeour has a thin, pale scar running down his neck, and Harry focuses on it despite himself.  It disappears into his collar, and Harry wonders how long it is, and who gave it to him.
, a porn magazine that catered largely to werewolves, Harry choked and had to be thumped on the back by Ron.
His wandering eventually brought him to Scrivenshaft’s, and remembering that Hermione planned to visit, he climbed the stone steps and pushed into the shop, letting the smooth, heavy door click shut behind him. A tiny bell rang above his head, and he thought he heard the low burble of some kind of bird from the back of the shop. Everything was old wood and dust. He could see immediately why Hermione liked it; after all, the shop felt just like a library.
Across the dormitory, he heard Neville mumble to himself, “Erumpent fluid, erumpent fluid . . . Bundimun secretion . . . got to remember that,” as he paged through his notes. Harry shook off the image of Malfoy and sighed. He was getting nowhere with this. He might as well just clear his mind and attempt to sleep. If he dreamt of Voldemort, so be it.
,” Ron groaned, hands shielding his face from the light, “what’s going on,” and she threw the newspaper at his head.
What Harry wanted most was a quiet birthday with the Weasleys, but after an afternoon of Exploding Snap with Hermione, Ron, and Ginny, Ron nudged him eagerly on the shoulder. “Wait’ll you see where we’re going tonight,” he whispered, purposely pitching his voice low. “Mum thinks we’re visiting the twins, she’d never let us even go there ordinarily, but it’s your first wizarding birthday, you know.”
wanted him, I think,' Hermione said, still sounding apologetic for some reason. 'Maybe they had a kid here when he let the Death Eaters in, I don't know. Oh, Harry, it's like I said, Doge is out for blood. And nobody wants to stick up for anyone who might have been a Death Eater, or even a Slytherin really, you know the climate right now, no one wants to be seen associating with them in case people think they're guilty too.'
By the time they reached the ground, the pitch had turned to mud and they slogged up to Hogwarts together, too preoccupied with the mud to speak. It was only when they reached the entrance that they looked at one another, both splattered with dirt and rain-soaked, panting in the sudden quiet.
Harry rolled his eyes. 'And you're paranoid. Look, Ron and Hermione are snogging, and Ginny's off with Dean.'
“At least Tonks will be straight with us,” Ron said staunchly, reminding Harry suddenly how much he’d kept from Ron. The prophecy, the club, last night, Malfoy. Harry felt suddenly guilty. “None of this babying Mum does,” Ron continued on, oblivious. “You reckon she has to leave?”
Natalie MacDonald looked about as green as Ron had during his first match, while Ron looked profoundly grateful that he wasn’t the one who had never played before. “But Malcolm Baddock said he’ll break both my arms if we win,” Natalie said faintly. The very mention of it made her look more ill.
'They're just kids,' Harry said, wondering how he had become Slytherin's staunchest defender over night. It was a thankless sort of task, as Malfoy conveniently reminded him at every opportunity.
Neville shrugged. His hair was getting long, and he had a few scars remaining, ones no magic would quite take away. They all had them. 'Yeah,' Neville said. 'I suppose so.'
She spun around. 'Don't try and lie, I know you were talking about Malfoy! Why couldn't you tell me?'
“Odd man, Aberforth,” Tonks mused. “Sad to see him go, though. He always said the strangest things—"
! and felt ashamed. Wouldn’t he ever learn? The knowledge that Moody, too, had been fooled was little comfort.
Ginny kissed Dean goodbye on the corner and they Flooed back to Grimmauld Place from Fred and George’s, Harry hushing Ron all the way from the fireplace up the creaky stairs and into their room. Hermione was ignoring them on purpose and Ginny was trying not to giggle at Ron’s repeated attempts to whisper loudly, “Harry, you have something on your mouth. Harry, were you kissing a girl? Harry, tell me!”
They went to the Burrow for Christmas Eve. The house was a-bustle with Teddy shouting, George's explosions ('It was Fred's idea, Mum, I swear'), and a very pregnant and very bossy Fleur. In one room, Arthur and Andromeda were talking about Ministry politics, while Hermione looked on. Ron and Bill were playing chess by the fire, while Ginny was curled up beside them with Crookshanks on her lap. Everyone seemed cozy and content, until Harry went into the kitchen for a glass of water and found all the counters covered with busy pots and pans, but no Mrs. Weasley.
But Harry was not looking for Sirius; he stared, instead, at the chubby face of Peter Pettigrew, which was smiling up at him. This was the boy who would grow up to betray Harry’s parents. To serve Voldemort. To face Harry in the graveyard, just after Cedric died.
She strode off in the opposite direction. Harry went down the Charms corridor, took the stairs to the second floor—which began to move just as he was nearly there, leaving him to jump the last three—and moved towards the empty corridor with the familiar stone gargoyle. It flexed its stone wings at him, but let him inside, and Harry rode the moving staircase upwards with trepidation. He wondered if there had been another attack. He wondered if more people had died because of him.
'Yeah,' Harry said. 'Besides, Sirius would have approved. He always said you were his favorite cousin.'
'Love is trust, too,' Ginny said, as if she had read his mind. 'And, and equality, okay, I don't want to be my mum. Well, maybe someday, but I'd like to play professional Quidditch, and I'm not going to keep changing everything just for you, Harry.'
'Don't call them that,' Harry says automatically.  After a moment of silence, where Malfoy neither apologizes nor argues with him, Harry adds, 'Anyway, I suppose you wouldn't miss Quidditch; you hardly even played last year.'
Shouldering his broom, Harry marched out of the changing room just after Ron, followed by the string of Chasers: Ginny and Katie gave Natalie’s arm a quick squeeze before she went and she looked slightly bolstered, though her eyes were still wide and scared.
“I know,” Hermione echoed him, watching him calmly over the top of her book. “I just think that maybe someone else should know, too.”
Harry fully expected him to hold forth on the brilliance of Slughorn, but when the door shut, he just leaned against the wall, heaving a sigh.
“I never agreed to that,” said Malfoy sharply, though there may have been a glint of admiration in his eyes. “Well, what is it, Potter, want me to fix the next Quidditch game? Want the answers to the next Potions exam? Maybe an apology for your little Mudblood friend—"
Harry kicked at chair again. "Look,” he muttered, sullen. “I didn't want him to die, all right? Well, and you've got your mum, that's better than I've got."
But just then, Malfoy got out of his seat, whispered something to Astoria, and sauntered over in their direction.
“You’ve really done it now, Potter,” Draco hissed, something like terror in the edges of his voice. “You’ve lost it. You belong in St. Mungo’s. You’re crazy.”
“Heard you screaming about Cedric in your sleep again,” Dudley said, giving him a piggy grin. “Who’s Cedric, your boyfriend? Don’t tell Malfoy, he’ll be mad . . .”
“We want Hermione to be happy,” Lisa said scornfully, as if that should be obvious. “Anthony’s liked her since fourth year. But I think he always knew—you know, about Ron."
'C'mere,' Harry whispered, and hauled Malfoy closer to him, brought their mouths together. They were both warm and sleepy and it was easy then, Malfoy's tongue pulling his into a lazy sort of kiss, Harry's left hand curled round the nape of Malfoy's neck, rubbing slow circles there. Malfoy sighed into his mouth and Harry pulled him closer.
Ron looked scornful at the mention of Anthony. “Did Harry tell you, we saw her on Harry’s birthday, she was dancing with—"
Harry stops next to him, a step or so away; he stands there, hands in his pockets, and waits.  The sunlight spills over them, the sky painfully blue.  After a time, Harry realizes that Malfoy is not going to do anything, and they are just standing there, staring at each other.
“Bit warm, isn’t it?” he said distractedly. “Anyway, Harry, look, we’ve just got word—Mundungus was keeping an eye on you like he was supposed to, and then—"
'Well-known to who?' Harry demanded. 'Hermione, the rest of us don't read these obscure books on law, I don't even know who the Chief Warlock is!'
When Harry stepped through into the Room of Requirement, he found Remus and Ron rearranging cushions for that evening’s lesson, but Hermione seemed to have been waiting by the door, and she immediately pounced on him. “Oh, Harry,” she said, looking oddly worried. “You didn’t.”
“Ah,” Remus said. He took a sip from his mug. “And how did you know Harry would be in trouble? You didn’t have, let’s say, any prior knowledge to what might be happening tonight?”
'Harry, Harry, you must understand,' wheezed Doge, and for that moment, pajamas or no pajamas, he reminded Harry of no one so much as Cornelius Fudge. 'Young Draco was a Death Eater, a killer—'
He knew that Draco had been hurt by his father’s absence, perhaps more than he could admit. He knew that there were things that Draco believed in that weren’t merely Pureblood principles. He knew that being civil with Draco in a few short months had taught him more than he’d ever expected.
“It means,” Harry continued doggedly, “that I’m the only one with the power to defeat him. Either he kills me or I kill him. There’s no other way.”
“Feel that, Potter?” she screeched. “You can watch your little friends take that much pain twenty times over! I’ll torture them until they’ll scream! Oh no, Potter, no easy death for you—you’ll watch them die, you’ll hear their screams for days and days—"
'Yeah, after all the fun we had at the Yule Ball together,' Harry snorted. 'It's fine, Hermione, I'm just going to go by myself.'
'I'm not trying to make you,' Harry said exasperatedly. 'Malfoy, I'm not marching you back to Hogwarts at wandpoint, I'm just trying to convince you that you'd be helping out your House.'
Harry had seen Malfoy’s so-called charity: upon receiving sweets from his mother, he’d dole out a select few morsels to a handful of other Slytherins, then hoard the rest for himself. Once Harry had overheard him snap at Goyle, “If you touch my chocolates again, I’ll tell your mother you still wet the bed,” upon which Goyle had reddened and thrown Malfoy a guilty, apologetic look. Harry and Ron had laughed over that gem for days.
'Hey, speaking of Slytherin,' Harry interrupted, ignoring Malfoy's splutter at being cut off. 'I was thinking. Why don't you owl your friends? Talk to them, tell them it's not so bad—' He hesitated as Malfoy snorted. 'Fine, that it wouldn't be so bad if you were all here together. I'll owl them, if you want. Promise that we're—'
Malfoy looked at him for a moment, his lips pressed together, and then he exhaled. 'I know you were there,' he muttered. 'On the tower that night he died. Snape told me. He saw both broomsticks and he knew about your Invisibility Cloak, and then you were chasing us, it only made sense.'
'She looked a bloody lot like Madam Pince, too,' Ron adds.  'You know, shrieking about the sanctity of knowledge and depraved schoolchildren.'  He does a very accurate imitation of Madam Pince swooping down on them, flailing her batty arms, and imagining Hermione doing the very same, Harry can't help but laugh.
With one last tired smile, he Disapparated, and Harry was left alone with Stan Shunpike’s pimply grin and Tonks’s virulently purple hair. “Better hurry,” she shouted, and he followed her up the steps while she stuffed his luggage out of the way. He settled in the first seat available, next to a dozing older woman with a hat not unlike Neville’s grandmother’s, which left Tonks to sit several rows behind him. He felt a bit cruel, avoiding her, but he was in no mood for the chatter he knew would come with the young Auror’s company.
Harry rolled his eyes. If Malfoy stopped speaking in code one day, he thought he'd drop dead of shock.
“Have been for a couple of years, yeah,” Tonks said, shrugging. “Got tired of the food at the Ministry, though.” She gave them a grin. “Not to worry, not everybody from the Ministry’s like your last professor. Or the fake Mad-Eye.”
Harry and Ron exchanged glances; both of them had been offered Hagrid's cakes on multiple occasions, and once Harry was sure he had come close to losing a tooth.
It's past noon on a Sunday when Lupin's tired head pops up in the midst of green flames and Harry kneels down to meet him.  'How are you holding up?' Lupin asks immediately.  'How are Hermione and Ron?'
“You can’t stop me,” Harry snarled. “I’ll bet he’s forgotten about you already, bet he thinks you’re just a pathetic little crybaby—"
“I’ll show you,” Malfoy hissed, his face red and sharp. “You’ll get yours, Potter.” And turning away, he added venomously, “Say hello to the new professor for me, won’t you?”
“I haven’t seen her in months,” Draco said, shifting uncomfortably. “She’s, well, wanted by the Ministry, you know.”
“Come on,” Ron said impatiently, “come downstairs, Mum’ll have made you a real breakfast.” He jiggled his leg anxiously while Harry rummaged about for a shirt, then dragged him to the staircase and down the steps two at a time.
'Malfoy,' Hermione says.  She is the last one Harry expects to speak, and he glances up at her; she is watching him, not Malfoy, her brow furrowed.  'You've got to tell us.  Or we'll.  We'll have to do something—'
There is silence, and Harry's harsh breathing, and then Malfoy says, his eyes on the floor, 'I can give you Snape.'
“I don’t care,” Harry said honestly, and he folded his arms. “I need to know, and I’m trusting you to answer.”
Ginny touches his face, one day, when he’s sitting in their garden watching Al toddle around, and there must be something in his expression because she says, ‘Are you—do you still think about him?’
'And, aside from the fact that you'd be rubbish at it, how are you going to become Minister of Magic when everyone thinks you're dead?'
“Over his father, what do you think?” Harry muttered, annoyed. “I don’t want to talk about it. It’s late, anyway, and I’ve got to read for Transfiguration.”
'Don't,' Harry groaned, by which he first meant, don't mention it, and then further, 'Malfoy, don't move, I mean it.'
"Some horrible owl is trying to bite me," he muttered. "Got packages for you. I expect it’s because your room has no windows. They're on my bed."
Dumbledore looked at him from behind his half-moon glasses. His expression was solemn. “I think, Harry,” he said, “that by now, you have seen how untrustworthy dreams can be. With the knowledge that he can access your mind, Voldemort can trick you into believing anything he wants. Just as he did this past June, when he lured you to the Department of Mysteries.”
“I didn’t know that’s what she was going to do,” Draco snapped. At his wording, both Remus and Dumbledore straightened significantly, and Harry stared at him.
Mad-Eye Moody continued on as if he hadn’t heard either of them. “The boy’s a waste of time,” he said. “Still, Dumbledore knows to keep an eye on him. Been checking his post. We’ll keep watching him, just in case.”
'Whatever you need to do,' Griphook repeated, in a slow tone that Harry didn't like. 'You have already broken one promise you made to a goblin, Harry Potter, and here you are offering another? Your word is as good as leprechaun gold to me.'
Harry tried not to look like he had been planning on leaving. 'Er, I stopped by to make sure you're all right.'
Malfoy, always easy to set off, narrowed his eyes. 'Where's your Mudblood?' he taunted. 'I thought there was something different. Of course, you're probably used to the stench of dirty blood by now, Weasel.' He made a suggestive hand gesture that nearly had Ron leaping out of his seat.
“I don’t trust anyone anymore,” Harry snapped, but he took the paper that Dumbledore handed to him. It was folded several times over and creased in strange places, as if it had once been a paper airplane like the memos Harry had seen on his visit to the Ministry. He glanced down at it disinterestedly, fuming inside.
Malfoy is confused for a second, then blushes all the way up to his hair. If Harry thought Malfoy was fit before, the sight of someone so poised and self-assured, all flushed and embarrassed is simply marvelous. It does things to his cock it shouldn’t be doing.
Nights are the hardest, when he's alone and the flat is dark and silent. He goes to sleep in a cold empty bed, even if he knows he won't close his eyes. When Draco… When he was not alone, the nightmares were kept at bay most of the time.
They all take their seat and Head Auror Potter casts a few protective spells around them. Sam frowns, Malfoy is a witness, right?
. Then two calloused fingers probe at Draco's hole and enter him swiftly. It burns a little but it doesn't register with Draco, all he can feel is Harry's strong body pining him down and the way he uses all his body's strength to fuck into him with his fingers. Each of Draco's exhales ends with a cry. The fact that Harry's still completely dressed behind him only heightening his arousal. It's barely a minute before Draco hears the tell tale sound of a fly opening. Harry's not even going to undress is he? Sure enough, Draco feels the blunt head of Harry's large cock catching his rim and the scratchy fabric of Harry's trousers on his arse.
”. The way the word makes his lips touch and part feels like he’s kissing Draco already. He lifts his free hand - the other still clutching Draco’s bicep - and traces Draco’s bottom lip with one finger. He looks at Draco interrogatively.
The stag starts galloping away, leading them to where Potter and Malfoy are. They arrive in a blur of hexes and shouts. Scorpius is kneeling in the dirt, protected by a strong shield charm. Potter and Malfoy are trying to capture the two remaining vigilantes. Weasley jumps in easily whereas Sam lingers on the sideline. He’s never been part of an actual fight before. He tries to remember what he learnt in training but his mind is blank. He’s starting to panic a little when Potter’s voice booms next to him.
You asked before if I pictured myself with a child. I never used to, to be honest. First, it would be … difficult given my preferences; and I always worried about passing on my family’s expectations and troubled past.
It's the endearment that does it. Harry turns Draco around and pushes him face first on the bed. He runs his tongue all the way from Draco's neck to the dimple above his left cheek. Draco's trembling underneath him, making Harry's cock leak against his stomach. Without further teasing, he mouths at Draco's balls, taking one in his mouth then the other. He moves up a little and finally licks around Draco's tight hole. Draco moans and desperate whimpers fill the room, Harry revels in them. He could come just from the sound of Draco's pleasure, he's so high on it.
Harry definitely hears reluctance in his voice, so without really thinking about it, he offers: “Or, maybe you could just join us?”
my reputation, but I have had a solid clientele for a few years now. I converted one of our drawing rooms into a classroom.
They look at each other above the kitchen counter. Draco is leaning against the fridge, in a seemingly relaxed stance. Harry knows better though. He sees the tension in his shoulders, the wariness in his eyes. They probably should try to talk. It’s been several months already and they share the same group of friends. They’re bound to run into each other and Harry’s so sick of not talking to Draco. He misses him more than he could ever express, even if his heart still breaks each morning he wakes up alone.
When they finish the last of the preparation, Harry nervously starts getting ready to leave. Draco looks at him confused.
Draco grabs the cookbook and searches for something. He finds it quickly and pushes the book at Harry’s face.
Potter is almost vibrating with impatience and barely concealed anger. He has been bouncing his leg consistently since they started before getting up to pace around his office.
“What’s that?” Harry asks. He’s usually not a picky eater but the thought of snails or frogs sort of grosses him out. He says so to Draco who laughs,
“Not sure, I’ve never been around any babies, Muggles or otherwise, except Teddy, and he was born in the middle of a war so…”
about how he spent his first three years in Hogwarts freezing to death because of the harsh Scottish weather. Harry has half a mind to apparate them there right this instant.
Off to Fortescue’s they go, Harry a mix of nerve and anticipation. They sit at a table and debate ice cream flavours. “
(portkey), they decide to call it a night. Harry’s reluctant to leave, Malfoy’s the best company he’s had in years - except for Ron and Hermione of course. So he lingers in Malfoy’s kitchen, hoping for a last cup of tea.
Mifty found it while shopping. She says it’s a good parenting guide for single parents. Please forgive her if you find it offensive.
off of his spoon, ignoring - or pretending to ignore - Harry’s reaction to the gesture. Harry’s not sure how, but somehow they manage to brush their hands together several times, each time with more intent than the previous one. Harry’s whole body is electrified, butterflies roaming free in his belly. He’s never felt like this, he's sure.
What is that?” Harry asks a little dumbly. Most of his blood flow is directed to southern regions, his brain is seriously under irrigated.
The recruits start whispering amongst themselves. Sam doesn't. He observes the way Potter prepares his wand, his cloak and a little pouch with unidentified objects. Sam entered the DMLE hoping he would get to work closely with the Head Auror. He's not a star struck fool, he just wants to learn from the best and Potter's records and medals unequivocally mark him as the best.
I've known you almost all your life and I couldn't be happier about it. You bring your father so much joy, you have no idea. No matter what happens with us (Harry and I), please trust that you can always count on me, okay? No condition, no time limit, nothing.
"Harry, you're everything I need and want okay. This thing, I don't need it, I want it sometimes but it's very much okay if we don't. I love you."
I didn't know you had become a tutor. Though I suppose you would know all about that, you probably had tons of tutors growing up. It would explain how you were always so good at potions. Does this mean you’re still living at the Manor?
Harry's staring into Draco's eyes. The fear and confusion are still there, but something's lurking behind Harry's green eyes. Something intense, something like heat? Draco feels his pulse race. He shouldn't get his hopes up but he knows Harry too well to not recognize what's slowly rising.
I saw the announcement of the birth of your child in the Prophet. Please accept my utmost congratulations.
“You didn’t really give me any time to explain. You just Apparated back home and sealed the wards to keep me out.”
Draco moves around in order to watch Harry's face. He seems a little embarrassed all of sudden, and Harry fears for the worst.
The past four years have been amazing. You and James are my family, the only one I have and will ever have. I don’t care that he’s not yours legally, he’s yours, ours. He loves you like a father and you love him like a son. I never had that, so I would know how much it means. I knew you felt this way the day he fell, remember? I told you not to come to St Mungos and yet you showed up all panicked and disheveled. You had left right in the middle of a class the minute you got my owl. I knew then.
It’s 11pm when they get the call. They're all gathered in Head Auror Potter's office. The department meeting ended only a few minutes ago but the Head Auror has insisted on receiving the new recruits separately to welcome them. Sam is about to introduce himself when a Jack Russel Terrier comes through the door and starts talking in Deputy Head Auror Weasley's voice.
Where there was animosity and scorn a few days ago, Sam sees vulnerability and concern. Potter has a hand on Malfoy’s arm, and speaks in a low voice. They have a hushed conversation, while Marcus scowls at Malfoy and Weasley observes in silence.
They finally reach their destination and Harry throws caution to the wind. He leans in toward Draco and takes hold of his bicep. Very briefly, their lips meet and Draco gasps his surprise at Harry’s boldness.
“I love you”, he finally whispers, feelings just tumbling out of him, “I love you so much. I’ll never love anyone like I love you.”
I reckon you should be really happy your child is finally sleeping, no? Congratulations to you both on this achievement (and no I’m not being sarcastic, I’ve come to understand that this is an important step).
Italy is amazing. The weather is so nice already, Jamie is enjoying it very much. I admit it's rather nice not to be bundled in coats and scarves like we are in London.
.” Harry answers shyly. He’s not too sure about what to do with his limbs. Should he sit? Should he greet Draco with another kiss on his cheek? He hasn’t mustered the courage to do so since the first time he did, and he’s been dying from the desire to feel Draco’s skin under his lips once more.
Teddy’s beaming in his kitchen, and Harry’s heart swells. The domesticity of it all is so overwhelming. It’s something he’s never felt outside of Molly’s kitchen, and even there he’s always been apart, hair too dark and eyes too green to completely fit in.
Harry is lost, what is Draco talking about? The confusion must show on his face, because Draco promptly explains. “We’re going shopping, Potter. Surely, you’ve done this before?” The way Draco says ‘Potter’ now isn’t infuriating, quite the opposite. It makes Harry’s blood boil for entirely different reasons than before.
Draco doesn’t sound angry anymore, he sounds miserable, on the verge of tears. But Harry’s too far gone to stop now.
he kisses your picture. Is there really no way for you to join us? Even a little bit? I promise Ginny's fine with it. I'd like you to meet her properly.
I wish you the best of birthdays! I’m so honoured to have blown that first candle with you this morning.
I actually had to research what diapers were. You do know you’re a wizard, right? Why would you use such outdated contraptions is beyond me! Just in case you really are ignorant, I asked Mifty for a list of basic childcare charms you should use. Mifty took care of me all my life so I trust her for these things. I reckon you should too.
Thank you for the picture, he is indeed quite lovely. Honestly, I don’t really get how people can tell who an infant looks like. His hair seems definitely wild enough to be yours.
Indeed, my birthday was on July 31st. Jamie and I shared a piece of cake. I’ve attached a picture of us blowing the candles - well he mostly just spat on them, I did the blowing.
Two hours have gone by and Harry has never felt more enthralled by a lesson before - with the exception of Third Year DADA with Remus. It turns out, Malfoy is nothing like the pretentious git Harry always thought he was. Sure, he’s very knowledgeable and isn’t afraid to show it, but he’s also very funny and, judging by his commitment to getting Harry to speak French, very generous. On top of that, well, he’s gorgeous. Harry knew he was fit, but now that he’s seen Malfoy joke and laugh and blush -
I don't need to remind you that this day is for Muggle parents who need to be reassured that their children will be in good hands. I will then ask you to refrain from causing any troubles like the ones you got into during your time with us.
"It's just that - you love me. You touch me with love and care and I love you for it, I do. Sometimes though, I just would like you to not be so in control of your desire. As if you couldn't help yourself, you know? Just take what you want."
The day of their ninth lesson, Harry receives an owl from Andromeda. She’s needed at some event, and asks Harry to take care of Teddy. Harry always jumps at the opportunity to spend time with his godson, but today he’s a little reluctant. It’s not that he doesn’t want to, it’s just that he really wants to see Draco. Their schedule has prevented them from having a lesson in more than five days now and Harry’s just missed him, as crazy as that sounds.
They don't mention it again until three weeks later when Draco comes home and finds himself pinned against a wall.
“Draco, I’m so sorry, I have Teddy with me, it was totally last minute, I’m sorry I didn’t warn you.”
Harry groans and drops his head on the small of Draco's back. He breathes deeply a few times, trying to rein in his arousal. When he feels a bit more settled, he straightens up. Draco is looking at him above his shoulder. The look of pure want and adoration in his eyes finishes mending Harry's heart. Tired of waiting for Harry to get a move on, Draco wriggles his toned ass in the air. Harry spanks him again, a sharper blow this time that leaves Draco's arse slightly pink. Draco's starting to protest against the wait but he's cut off by Harry's cock plunging inside him in one brutal thrust of his hips.
Draco doesn't have to wait long, a hand soon grabs at his jaw. Harry uses it to guide Draco into a deep filthy kiss, all tongue and teeth. Draco moans into it shamelessly. Harry needs all the reassurance he can get.
“Yes, like a date.” Something in Draco’s eyes tells Harry that they are indeed on the same page. Pretending that all the time they spend together is about the French lessons, when it’s actually because they like each other’s company more and more.
. The thing is, Malfoy’s fit, sure, but what really makes Harry stare when he’s in a room is the way he carries himself. One would think that after the War, Malfoy would have been trying to make himself scarce. Well, not at all. When Malfoy enters a room, it’s with head held high, shoulders rolled back and a charming smirk on his face. He’s also as snarky as ever, although in a funny way, less mean than before. And now, Malfoy is helping him when clearly he has no obligations to. This is all very confusing to Harry.
They mean well, they do, but Harry just wants to sit at home in his pants, trying again and again to figure out what went wrong with Draco. He doesn’t want to be told that
Harry walks around the counter still separating them. With each step he takes toward Draco, Draco’s eyes widen a little more.
Until one day, the Head Auror comes barging in the bullpen, robes barely fastened, face showing his lack of sleep.
“Give this message to Draco : you were right, we found them. I’ll bring Scorpius back soon, hang in there.”
The thought has been running through Harry’s mind since he took one step into Luna and Ginny’s living room, only to find himself face to face with Draco. From the ‘deer in headlights’ look on Draco’s face, he wasn’t aware Harry had been invited either.
“I’d rather ask her who’s going to fuck whom tonight. There’s no way I’m losing against Weasley again.” The stubborn look on Draco's face briefly reminds Harry of their school days.
Who would have thought when we first met all these years ago, that we would be here today? I certainly didn’t. Even when my heart - and my body - were telling me that maybe there was something there, my life has always felt too temporary to even think about that sort of thing.
He installs Teddy in his booster seat. The kid is now able to sit on a normal chair but Harry's learnt the hard way that food gets everywhere when Teddy's not at the exact right height of the table.
Marcus begrudgingly nods and starts skulking in the corner. Potter focuses back on Malfoy, there’s something different in his demeanour though. Something almost tentative.
The line is long enough for Harry to change his mind a dozen times. A few people are still ahead of them when Draco finally cracks and asks what’s going on.
With a sharp thrust of his hips Harry enters Draco making them both moan in unison. Merlin, Harry feels huge with barely any prep, Draco loves it so much. One of Harry's hands stays on his hip to hold him in place, the other grasps Draco's hair in a makeshift ponytail and pulls so that Draco's back is bowed and his face is right next to Harry's. Draco feels the prickle on his scalp and a shiver runs through his whole body. The sensation never gets the opportunity to stop because Harry starts whispering filthy things in his ear. He talks about how tight Draco is, how he's taking it so beautifully, how Harry's just gonna come in his ass and leave him ravished and unsatisfied. Draco knows bruises are forming on his side where Harry's holding him, he already can feel the love bites on his neck. Pleasure is pooling fast in his lower belly and he knows he's going to come untouched. Harry only has to bite down hard in the space between his neck and his shoulder and Draco comes, harder than ever, spraying the couch with thick ropes of white sticky come. He's full on yelling now and Harry's hand flies to Draco's mouth to shut him up - he probably forgot about silencing charms - and
“The spirits can’t say. It’s dangerous to mess with the future.” She’s looking straight at Harry when she says that, it makes him really uncomfortable, like maybe she knows how he sometimes bent the rules of time in the past. She can’t though, can she? She’s a fake, just spouting platitudes to gullible tourists.
“We have a lead! A group of vigilantes tried to abduct Pansy Parkinson’s daughter. We found Scorpius’s wand in their hidden base. Conley,” he says addressing Sam “you’re with Weasley, you’re interrogating the three suspects we caught. Marcus, you’re with me, we’re going back to the lair to look for clues as to where they’re keeping Scorpius.”
Once in the study, Harry can see the extent of Malfoy’s preparation. The walls are covered in pictures of all sorts of magical objects. Harry looks around, awed at the amount of effort it must have taken Malfoy to do all this in barely twenty-four hours.
"Ngh", Harry moans, "wait, wait. I want, I want…". He's panting in Draco's mouth, brain completely overloading.
The desperation in Draco's declaration makes Harry's cock twitch in his arsehole, pushing it a little deeper. Harry's hips lose all rhythm, just chasing pleasure. Then, Harry's coming, so deep inside Draco, he can't breathe for a second. Draco convulses beneath him, body shaken by his own orgasm and they collapse on the bed, a pile of sweaty limbs and mended hearts.
Malfoy: prat, bully, wannabe Death Eater, fit. He never thought too much about it. Then the War happened and life took its course, and Harry never spent too much time thinking about Draco at all. When Draco reappeared in Harry’s life through Hermione and the Ministry, Harry avoided reassessing his views on him. Now though, he saw him every two days, spent time with him and
It’s been thirty minutes and Harry already wants to leave. Ron is looking at him like Harry’s going to burst in tears any minute, Hermione keeps patting his shoulder in obvious pity and Luna is just being
When the interview is finally over, they are all exhausted and agree to call it a day. Except Potter locks himself in his office with the content of the case file and Sam’s notes. The case really is complex, no clues were left at the scene, and Scorpius seems like a good kid. Even Malfoy, once he relaxed a little, looks like he’s living a very quiet, almost recluse life. He’s sharp, witty and so damn sarcastic but nothing that would warrant getting his son kidnapped.
Also, you didn’t need to apologize, you know. It was all a long time ago, and we were so young. Now that I have Jamie, I think I have more perspective on the war and the years leading up to it. I mean, your parents, they didn’t leave you any choice did they? Just like mine in a way. In the end, in crucial moments, you did do the right thing.
Mr Malfoy has asked me to extend an invitation to Hogwarts's Open Day on the 24th to you and young James Arthur Potter.
“Well mostly I’ll talk and you’ll repeat. As our first topic, I chose the world of magic.” Malfoy seems to be waiting for something then. “Well, is that okay for you?”
It’s dark when they leave. Harry’s almost sure Draco is as sad as he is that they have to part. Once at the Apparition Point, they stop and shuffle on their feet for a minute.
Harry risks a glance in Draco’s direction, he’s looking for a reaction on the blond’s face. Does the thought of having a family with Harry scare him? Excite him? Harry’s equally afraid and impatient to find out.
It is, for me. When we started exchanging - sometimes heated - letters, I thought I had everything I would ever have. My family, my job, a few acquaintances. Then, you and James barrelled into my life and it was as if I never had anything to begin with.
I won’t be able to make it to the Weasleys. Please send my apologies to Molly and don’t forget to bring her that embroidery my mother sent for her.
A knock on his cubicle wall startles Sam. He’s surprised to see Head Auror Potter when he raises his head.
"Can you feel how much I want you Draco? Gods, you drive me mad." Then after a beat. "I'm going to fuck you so hard."
Your letter was such a pleasant surprise. Of course, the answer is yes. How could I not give you my blessing? I have never seen Draco as happy as he is with you and young James. I would want nothing more than for you to officially join our family.
"Harry, let's forget about this. We don't have to, it's perfectly fine," Draco says, ignoring Harry's last question completely.
It has been a year since our first kiss. You have no idea - or maybe a little by now - how long I had wanted to kiss you by then.
"Oh I am?" Draco smirks, pleased. Gone is the hesitant man that offered to leave not fifteen minutes ago.
” Harry groans. If he thought Draco speaking French was hot, Draco talking dirty to him in French is almost enough to make him come in his pants like a fucking virgin.
“Harry, I - “, Draco starts. Then, just when the wheel starts moving again and begins its descent, he whispers in a broken voice “No.”
Sorry I didn’t answer your letter earlier. Although to be fair I haven’t slept in over a week and your congratulations were more than unexpected.
"Don't know, don't care.", Draco replies, right before Apparating them on the front steps of their flat.
I hope I’ll be a Slytherin like you. Did you know Dad almost got sorted out Slytherin too? That would have been wicked if the three of us had been in the same House.
this makes Draco comes even longer. His asshole is clenching like crazy around Harry's fat cock and he never wants it to end. He's still shaking with aftershocks when Harry flips him around once more. Draco then realizes that Harry still hasn't come. It's not unusual, the man has the stamina of a hippogriff. Draco's in a daze, unsure of what's going on. The next thing is aware of is Harry nudging his mouth open with his hard leaking cock. Draco opens up in a heartbeat and sucks Harry off immediately. This time, Harry finds the right grip on Draco's hair - the one that makes him tingle all over and his flaccid cock twitch - and slowly starts fucking his face. Draco raises his eyes to Harry's face to find the brunet already looking at him with a question in his eyes. Draco nods as best as he can in his position. Harry, reassured, thrusts deeper into Draco's throat, accompanying the gesture with a pull and push of his head to avoid earlier catastrophe.
"Sorry, I just thought I'd - Sorry. I'll buy you a new one." Then he flees the room, face red from embarrassment.
Things are a blur after this, Draco is crying with laughter and Harry wants to dig a hole and die. It’s a while before things settle down enough for Draco to carry on with their lesson. Turns out
James and everything. I’m sorry I missed the wedding announcement by the way, it’s probably too late to congratulate you for it.
“Okay. I’m sorry I didn’t listen to what you had to say before today. I’m sorry you thought I didn’t love you.”
. He loves the music box you got for him. He made me rewind it all morning to see the little dragons flying around. I've taken a thousand pictures so you'll see it for yourself.
"Sorry sorry," Harry mumbles, still kissing Draco's neck. The snogging continues for a bit and Draco gets back into it. But suddenly, Harry is violently pulling on his clothes - like he can't wait another minute before touching skin - and Draco hears the painful noise of expensive fabric tearing.
You bring me so much joy, the both of you. I know he’s not mine in the way of science and law, but in all the other ways … Ginny is his mother of course but I like to think that I’m a third parent to him? Whether that’s true or not, in my heart he’s mine Harry, and ours. I hope it’s okay.
Draco mimes licking an ice cream and Harry’s mind blanks. Gods. Is Draco trying to kill him? Is that what this is all about?
They share dessert in a near silence that could have been uncomfortable but is not. Draco shamelessly licks the
Harry’s reduced to a blubbering mess. Did Draco really just say they would eat cock? Not that Harry’s opposed to it of course, it’s just they haven’t even kissed yet. Draco sure is moving fast.
Hugo said you weren’t even my father. I know you’re not really but I would like you to be. I like Ginny but you’re the one tucking me in at night, and teaching me how to brew and speak French. Would it be okay if I asked to be your son? Legally I mean? Dad says if you agree we could work something out.
"Salazar fuck!", Draco exclaims. These are the last actual words he pronounces. Soon, he's pushed face down into the mattress and Harry's pounding into him relentlessly. Harry's been on the verge of coming since they kissed in Luna and Ginny's kitchen, he can't take it slow. Draco seems to appreciate it, if the muffled cries coming from him are any indication.
"No, no, it's me. I just don't - I thought you liked me cherishing you, caressing you. Now you're saying… What are you saying exactly? You want me to force myself on you?"
Draco nods. There’s nothing much to say to that anyway. Teddy’s turning ten this year, but the hole in Harry’s heart where Remus used to be, is still gaping wide open.
I hope everything is going well in London. Has Alex managed to finally control his outbursts? Don't forget your protection charms with this one, I'd like to find you unscathed when I get back.
Do you ever think about having one of your own? Sorry, that’s probably way too personal, you don’t have to answer.
Tomorrow, I’ll say the official words but tonight, let me promise you to love you, to cherish you, to always say I’m sorry first, to keep my frozen feet away from you from October to March and mostly I promise you that our son and I will always be here for you.
In any case, please find attached instructions given by my house-elf Mifty to remove body fluids from your clothes.
“No, young man", the old lady scolds, "I'm not talking about the past. I’m talking about the future. Dark days are coming. Ones that won’t require your bodies to fight, but your hearts.”
Draco’s cheeks redden slightly under Harry’s intensity. Harry knows he can be overwhelming, the way he doesn’t shy away from his feelings compared to how Draco is used to keeping them hidden. But he can’t stop now, he has to go through with it.
Soon after that, Draco finds himself pressed into the couch once again. Harry's demeanour is changing slowly into a commanding self-assured man. He looks taller somehow and it makes Draco whimper. He goes to put his hands in Harry's hair, when a rush of magic pins both his arms above his head.
But he thought again of Dumbledore and the betrayal he had felt just after Christmas, sitting in the too-empty tent with only Hermione at his side, the heavy weight of Rita Skeeter's book on his lap.
'We'll be waiting in the same spot we landed,' a different Auror says; perhaps it is meant as reassurance, but it sounds far from it.  'After two hours,' the Auror adds, his expression souring further, 'we'll return to the mainland, come back at half past to check again, and then leave for good.  Understand?'
was Malfoy, the same bigoted, small-minded little ferret he had hated for years, the one who taunted Ron and paraded around with Umbridge and reported to his father. And who had looked at Harry so knowingly in his dream, knelt before him, and—
'YES HE WAS,' Harry shouts.  'Hermione, I was there!  I saw him, I saw how hateful he was, how he looked at Dumbledore with—with disgust—Hermione, I know he's evil!  I know he's working for Voldemort, we've known that since we were first-years, we just never had the proof!'
Five minutes later, she was sitting on a nearby desk, dabbing at her face with a handkerchief. 'I can't work,' she wailed, glaring at Hermione in between each sniff. 'I can't do anything, it's terrible! I'm writing an advice column for the Prophet under the name Sylvia Saturn, but I can only come here at night, the others don't like to look at me or they tease me for covering up my face!'
“Nothing so exciting,” Tonks said, pushing off the wall to walk beside him. She sounded almost bitter about any lack of progress. “Little meeting with Dumbledore, that’s all.”
'What, she knew,' Daphne said. 'I always thought she'd have gone for him, too, if not for her own stupid crush on Draco.'
Harry let the wooden staircase spiral him back to the door, mind blank: clearing his mind of thoughts was a habit now, but for once, he didn’t care if Snape would be pleased. He had told Dumbledore all he knew, but somehow, the weight on his shoulders felt heavier than it had when he entered.
Mrs. Black only stares blankly at the wall beside Hermione's head.  After a minute of waiting, Hermione throws up her hands.
Remus had showed Harry the motorbike before school had started, and he found it in the exact same place, in a dim little shed that opened into the outdoors. Spellbound, he ran a finger across the seat.
'Haven't seen you about so much, little brother,' Charlie said; he was rocking his chair on its back two legs, feet propped up on the table, actually gnawing on one of Hagrid's pastries. 'Been busy, have you?'
'I'll be fine tomorrow,' she said firmly, blinking back tears, and then turned away and hurried up the stairs before he could say another word.
“He doesn’t think the public can handle it without panicking,” Hermione said, looking disapproving. “But Professor Lupin said that was a huge problem with the last war, that nobody but the Order knew what was going on, the media was full of lies. I suppose Fudge hasn’t learned his lesson.”
And then he felt a familiar, aching tugging around his navel, as if someone had wrapped a hook around his insides and yanked, and the world blurred around him.
for your sixth birthday,' Hermione retorts, looking a bit tired of Malfoy's insufferable company.  'Hi, Harry.  Did you get everything from Fred and George?'
Hermione blushes.  'Sometime, I will,' she says.  'Right now, I think we ought to work on things that will actually protect us, or stop an enemy from attacking—'
The next morning, the rain rolls in, finally making good on the threat of heavy clouds that have been hanging around for the past week.  It's a cold, foggy humidity that makes Harry think of Dementors and the air feel like soup.  Sometimes, Harry wonders how exactly Dementors breed, but he doesn't want to know badly enough to ask Hermione.
“You’re home,” Remus said, giving him a mild smile. “I was beginning to get worried. But Draco assured me that I was being a paranoid old man, so I decided not to chase after you immediately.”
'Yeah, yeah, I get it, you pity me,' Harry said, rolling his eyes. 'Sit down, Malfoy. You're right, I'm bored and wide awake.'
“And I’m not him!” Malfoy snapped. It shocked Harry so much to hear Malfoy willingly admit that he was, or could be, different from his father, that he simply stared at him. “Look,” Malfoy said, taking his silence for impatience, “so I just wanted to know if we could . . . well . . .”
“. . . well, I don’t mean to say everybody, of course,” Ron was saying, gesticulating with his roll, “because Harry, if you want to fancy Lisa Turpin, it’s all right with me . . .”
For his part, Ron mutters, 'Well, don't expect me to share a room with him.  Or to be nice to him.  Or to help him out if anybody comes after him, because I'm not risking my life for his scrawny—'
It was the most silent game of chess Harry had ever played, but it wasn't awful. Malfoy won and lorded it over Harry for at least ten minutes, until Harry pointed out that he'd won every Quidditch match to date, and Malfoy fell into an indignant silence.
“Harry,” Remus said, and waited until Harry looked up at him. “None of us are perfect. Do you know how many mistakes we all made when the war began? People were killed, whole operations lost, because Aurors—trained Aurors, Harry, not sixteen year old boys—made mistakes. You’ve saved people’s lives, Harry, you haven’t given up, you’ve done everything you could do. And that is why you are so like your dad.”
Number twelve Grimmauld Place had come alive again; Kreacher had even gone so far as to polish the plaques of house-elf heads until they gleamed in the guttering light. More often than not, Harry found a steaming cup of tea waiting for him when he ventured into the kitchen, and he scarcely had to think of a warm bath before Kreacher had drawn it for him. This was nothing in comparison to Andromeda, however; the House of Black had taken to her immediately, like a wand returned to its master.
“Come on, Ron, we don’t want to be late. Professor McGonagall says we’re to meet the third-years at the front doors. Sorry, Harry. We’ll see you there, I’m sure.”
“Go with Tonks,” Mr. Weasley instructed. “I’ve got to get back right away. Don’t worry about your relatives. You can owl them later, if you’d like.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said quickly. At least the picture in the paper had been grainy and Tonks had had her back to the camera; it was difficult even for Harry to recognize her, and he was fairly sure no one else had. No one but Malfoy, that is. “It could have been somebody else, Ron.”
“Tonks?” Harry said, every bit of his anger and arousal vanishing, so overcome was he by surprise. His heart was racing at how close they’d come to being caught. “What are—what are you doing here?”
Two days later, on a cool, still-light evening, Harry was restlessly reading his Transfiguration textbook when the late sun glinted off the mirror shard on his nightstand. He picked it up. After a minute of debating, he looked in the mirror and said, 'Draco Malfoy?'
'And that makes it okay?' Ginny demanded. 'I think, I think it's terrible. I thought I knew what kind of person you were, Harry, but maybe I didn't after all.'
Silence ruled until finally, his shame turning slowly into frustration, Harry snapped, “Months ago you would’ve been talking about it for days. You would’ve thought it was brilliant. You hate Malfoy.”
Remus put a hand on his shoulder. “As loath as I may be to admit it, Snape knows what he is doing. He’s very skilled. If Dumbledore isn’t concerned about the pace of your progress, I wouldn’t be.”
'Neville, I saw him.  The night that Dumbledore died.  He couldn't kill him, he was trying and he couldn't bring himself to say the words.  He was even about to surrender and take Dumbledore's protection when the Death Eaters came—'
'Well,' said Griphook, a speculative and rather unpleasant smile twisting his face as he gazed up at Harry. 'We meet again, Harry Potter. I was wondering when you would appear.'
It was easier this time, more familiar, even. He had forgotten how smooth Draco’s skin was under his fingertips, and the way his breath hitched when Harry touched him. He’d forgotten the way it felt, Draco’s hand skimming hard up his back, hips jerking under him.
'Here,' Harry says, yanking Malfoy into a corner once they're out of the kitchen.  'Malfoy, it's about your dad.'  He looks down at the stained floorboards rather than at Malfoy's face.  'He doesn't, er, want to be helped—says he's going to stick by Voldemort, and—'
'Penelope Clearwater, of course,' Hermione said without a pause. 'She was Percy's girlfriend at Hogwarts, but they split up when Percy started work at the Ministry. She must be the replacement Transfiguration teacher.'
He leaned over and slipped the parchment to Hermione and Ron; down the table, Ginny frowned at her porridge but did not look at him.
“What did I say?” Ron looked startled, but not entirely displeased, as Hermione seized him without warning and kissed him on the cheek.
Andromeda and Narcissa were in the drawing room with all the windows open, snow blustering in over the sill. From the looks of it, Andromeda was teaching her sister how to smoke. Over Narcissa's coughs, she exclaimed, 'You're doing it all wrong . . .'
It took him a moment to even decipher what Malfoy was talking about; so much had happened in the past twenty-four hours that he could barely recall it all. Bewildered, he said at last, 'You never told me to be! I had no idea the trial was happening. You deliberately cursed Hermione just to keep me from knowing! What do you expect, of course I didn't come!'
Harry had to stand up to see over the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Once he did, his mouth dropped open.
Sirius. Sometimes he seemed very far away, as if Harry had scarcely known him, as if he were a memory left over from some distant life before. And sometimes, in the middle of poking at Aunt Petunia’s meager dinners or on his way home from the park in the blue-dark evening, the loss felt so immediate that he froze for a moment, stunned by his godfather’s last arcing fall.
“All right.” Harry glanced over his shoulder again. He thought he heard footsteps. “I ought to go—told Remus I’d look over some, um, some of Sirius’s stuff with him—"
'I'm just saying, it's a good thing I never switched to your side,' Malfoy added, sounding more than a little delirious from the pain. 'Never could produce a Patronus. Wouldn't have made the cut.'
'I love you despite ze cheekens,' Fleur says and Harry, embarrassed, decides it is time to rejoin the party after all.
'Research for Charlie,' Hermione replied, beaming. 'I've been helping him plan lessons. Haven't you noticed how much better they've been? I went to talk to him at the beginning of the year and he asked for my help—'
'Oh, gross.'  Ginny makes a face at him.  'I do not need to know that about my brother.  Really.  Do you want to take a walk?'
Though never the best at deflecting when fully prepared, Malfoy had been caught entirely off guard, and his legs jerked wildly in place. “I hate you,” he hissed at Harry, body twisting out of his control, twin points of red fury on his face. He was staring at Harry with a look of venomous rage. “I’ll kill you, Potter, I’ll—"
'Night, Hermione,' Harry said. Malfoy elbowed him sharply in that region just below his underarm, where it hurt so much he almost shouted, but he did manage to knee Malfoy in the stomach before rolling over with his back to Malfoy again.
At that moment, a thin, raggedy-looking wizard sits down on the other side of Ron, still mid-conversation with Madam Rosmerta, who takes the seat next to him.  Ron's face falls noticeably, and Harry is sure that he's wishing Rosmerta had been the one to sit beside him.
“Yeh can’ do anythin’ abou’ it,” Hagrid grumbled, and then looked at Harry in sudden alarm. “Yeh aren’t plannin’ on goin’ ter Wales, are yeh? O’ all the foolhardy things ter do—"
Ginny and Dean came down to breakfast, then, and stopped cold at the sight of Harry. After a second, Ginny offered Harry a small smile, and then followed Dean over to a seat at the other end of the table.
'I do mean it,' Malfoy said irritably as he retrieved his wand. 'Why would I be doing the spell if I didn't mean it?'
“Oh, Dean, I’m so sorry,” Ginny exclaimed, dropping Pig’s cage and sinking onto the seat beside him. “Let me see. Ouch. Here, come to the loo, I’ve got some salve.”
Harry exchanged looks with Ron. He did not understand how Hermione managed to keep track of all her knowledge and simultaneously recall all the gossip Hogwarts had seen for the past eight years. She did not seem in the mood to hold her breadth of knowledge over their heads, however; all her attention was focused on Slytherin, with an occasional glance to Professor McGonagall at the head table.
"I'm supposed to be self absorbed," Draco said, as if it were painfully obvious. "But you're Harry Potter. You're supposed to smile at everybody and kiss babies. And Hufflepuffs."
After dinner, he spent a restless hour poring over Hermione’s Transfiguration notes before leaving to meet Malfoy. Luckily, Ron and Hermione were at a Gyffindor Prefects meeting, and neither were present to notice him leaving. He wasn’t sure if he was ready to spill about whom, exactly, he was going to see.
Harry gets up from the hearth to let Malfoy take his place.  When Lupin's head vanishes and the pale blonde tresses of Malfoy's mum appear, Harry retreats to the door of the room, but stands there, arms folded, watching.  He can't hear what either of the Malfoys are saying, but he can see the tears streaming down Narcissa Malfoy's face, and Malfoy reaching out to brush them away into the hissing green flames.
That seemed to do the trick, because it was only seconds before Draco settled on behind him, his knees bumping the sides of Harry’s thighs. “Potter,” he said, his breath hot in Harry’s ear, “you do know how to fly this ridiculous apparatus, don’t you?”
'What are you doing here?' Harry demanded, heart going triple-time. 'I thought you were, I don't know!'
'Get off me!' he yells, realizing only afterwards that his words come out in Parseltongue; the tendril, almost guiltily, recoils.
The goblin nodded, unimpressed. 'At least twelve vaults were heavily damaged, with minor damage to thirty others. The reconstruction to the tunnels was substantial, not to mention the cost of the dragon you stole, and the value of the treasure taken.'
“I’m fine, I’ve got Potions,” he said desperately and dashed away down the hall before she could even say goodbye. He imagined her staring after him, probably thinking he’d gone absolutely barking mad, but he wasn’t about to turn around, even to look.
But before they can get into a real row, Harry heads them off.  'Speaking of the Order, I've got a postcard from Lupin.'  He holds up the piece of cardboard sporting a picture of the Arc de Triomphe; it looks as if it has been through at least one rainstorm.  Luckily, Harry notices, Lupin had the sense to use waterproof ink.
“Oh, shut up,” Harry said good-naturedly, leaning against the wall. “It’s a Pureblood house, you know. Your mum’s family lived there.”
They passed away up towards the school, voices fading, and Harry realized with a panicked glance at his watch that he was almost late. He tore down through the school grounds until he reached the gate, and then he Apparated off to London.
“Isn’t Veritaserum a last resort?” Hermione said, with some concern. “Did Dumbledore know about this?”
The day seemed to drag on excruciatingly after they had gotten through breakfast, as Harry’s thoughts remained solidly on the feel of Draco’s lips on his own, his fingers brushing against Harry’s hip. He relived it while playing chess with Remus; while talking through the fire to Ron and Hermione, who flushed when he asked about why she’d left Anthony’s; while watching Draco read an owl from his mother, sneer, and crumple it up. He thought about it so much that, by the time they both climbed the stairs and stood there in the darkness, he was nearly paralyzed by what to do next.
Hagrid looked guilty at the mention of Sirius’s name, which in turn made Harry feel guilty, as he’d only used it for that very reason. “I don’ know much o’ anythin’,” Hagrid began miserably, but luckily he was saved by the tea kettle, and lumbered about pouring them tea before he could finish his story. When he sat back down, he looked as if he weren’t going to say another word.
'Well, it's nice to see that someone's feeling happier around here,' Hermione says delicately, after being chased from the room by Mrs. Black's ear-splitting screams for the second day in a row.  She is making a pot of porridge, filling the kitchen with the smell of warm honey as Malfoy comes thumping down the stairs.
“Think about it,” Remus told him quietly. “Being around you is good for Draco. It makes him think twice about things.” He stood up, stretching. “But it’s late, and I’m not as young as I used to be. I believe my bed is calling. Good night, Harry.”
It's at that moment that Malfoy chooses to come down the stairs, looking bored.  'What is this, a convention?' he says.  'Are you having a party without me?'
spell, and the ropes slither off Malfoy and dissolve.  'No second chances, Malfoy,' Harry says then.  'You've got this one, and that's it.  You back out, forget it.  You sell us out, it's over.  I shouldn't even be helping you now, you know.  When Dumbledore offered you help, you refused.'
“I’m pleased to hear you aren’t set on curing Mr. Malfoy of his personality,” Dumbledore elaborated, eyes twinkling. “For that would be almost as foolhardy as caring only about one part of someone and ignoring the rest. In a void, perhaps that could work. In the real world, it never does.”
"You're all just scared of death." Harry is murmuring his words more to Draco's shoulder than Draco himself, but he is sure that Draco hears him. He expects a pause before the answer, but Draco's reply is light.
On the last morning of their exams, Harry was sitting at breakfast with Ron and Hermione when the post came. The Daily Prophet nearly landed in his porridge—he'd taken out a subscription again, after what he had missed the last time—and then his own small brown owl came fluttering down to his plate, hooting happily as Harry offered him the crusts from his toast.
Tonks was grinning. “Kirley and I go way back. It’s a bit of a long story. But anyway, of course we talked about you. He was quite interested when he heard I met you, you know. Owled me straightaway.”
. If I am to waste my time attempting to school you in Occlumency, you will practice emptying your mind of emotion. Unless, of course,” and his eyes glittered, “you want to join your godfather in the ranks of the dead.”
“I have better things to do with my time than remember what Malfoy was wearing,” Ron said disgustedly.
When Ron finally calmed down, he gave a heavy sigh. 'Bloody git, I don't even know why he came back. Where is Hermione, anyway? She said she'd meet us here half an hour ago.'
Thankfully, Harry was saved from another bickering session as Ron exclaimed, “Bollocks, I left my Transfiguration essay in the common room.” He dashed off to get it before class, leaving Hermione shaking her head.
Gryffindor was rowdy that night, and Harry found himself slipping out of the room without a second thought, welcoming the cool silence of the corridor. It wasn't until he was halfway to Slytherin that he realized he'd left his cloak behind.
Harry and Ron stared at her. After a minute, Harry offered, 'Unity, something about working together.'
Harry glances over to him. His vision of Draco is skewed, as he is on the wall beside him. He says, "Would you like me to count how many ways you betrayed me?"
Harry looked at Draco, who was slumped pale and weary in the shadows. He didn’t look up, and eventually, Harry looked away.
“I reckon it’ll be a while before I get used to the four of us,” Ron said quietly, changing into his pyjamas. “It’s just not the same without him, is it?”
“Oh,” Harry said, and glanced over his shoulder, as if Draco were about to materialize from the shadows. “Where is he?”
After a dazed moment, Harry glanced at the Marauder's Map still lying recklessly open on the ground. From the look of it, Malfoy was in a toilet only two corridors away, and his little dot was not moving much at all. Something squirmed in Harry's chest at the thought of Malfoy, trousers around his knees, desperately fisting his cock in a stall so close by. Though if that were the case, he couldn't see why Malfoy had not let Harry return the favor.
It's the fourteenth of August and Harry can hear the rain from where he sits, cross-legged, at the bottom of Ron's bed.  The duvet is thrown back, the sheets full of crumbs, and Ron is half-propped against his headboard, one hand still inside a packet of crisps, snoring.  This scene might be amusing if it weren't for the fact that Harry has spent the past eight days this way, and that the rain is starting to give him a headache.
For an instant, Harry was truly bewildered, and then he shook his head. “Occlumency. With Dumbledore.”
“If you want.” He felt, somehow, absolutely empty of hate. There was something pathetic about Malfoy, furious and futile, gripping a handful of quills in the door of a dusty shop. “Oh, by the way, aren’t you supposed to be watching the third-years?”
Malfoy is pale, arms crossed over his chest.  'But she—she's going to read the article and think I'm dead!'
Harry looked up. Malfoy was, indeed, absorbed in the article, but he seemed to be just as anxious as Harry and his friends. His face, from Harry’s distant perspective, looked sharp and worried. He certainly wasn’t smirking with ill-concealed glee, as Harry had expected.
“No!” Harry yelled, sitting upright in a flash. Across the room, Seamus gave a snort of surprise, but after a moment, it seemed he was still asleep. Breathing heavily, Harry lay back. It was still the middle of the night.
Harry frowned. 'I hope not.' He could not think of anything worse than having his memory manipulated; it was more terrible than Legilimency, the thought of someone messing about in his head. For a brief second, Harry wondered if Occlumency could be employed against memory charms, and he was so pleased with himself for thinking up a Hermione-level question that he did not hear what Ron said.
'I did!' Charlie exclaimed; it was obvious that he liked nothing better than to talk about them. 'They're magnificent. I help train them. All of you probably remember the Triwizard Tournament, don't you? I helped bring in the four dragons for the first task. Job's a bit rough, sometimes, you've got to be quick on your feet and handy with some burn salve, but they're brilliant, really. My favorites are the Chinese Fireballs. Gryffindor colors, you know!'
Harry strode more quickly at Ron’s side. In the past twenty four hours, life had got altogether more complicated than he’d expected.
He was starving. But he looked at his friends’ beaming faces and said, a little more coldly than he meant, “I’m a bit tired, actually,” and took his trunk from Ron with a jerk. Realizing by the startled look on Ron’s face that he may have been too harsh, he added quickly, “Been a long day, you know, and the Knight Bus, bangs you all around . . .”
Tonks was at the bar of The Three Broomsticks when Harry entered; she was chatting pleasantly with Madam Rosmerta, who was giggling at something Tonks had said. Tonks was wearing a skirt over outrageously striped tights, which were cut off mid-calf by large boots. When she turned around to see him, he saw the word SPELLSHOCK emblazoned on her shirt, presumably a band, from the moving silhouette of a drummer banging silently on a drum set above the words. For an instant, when she turned towards him, she looked utterly exhausted, but then her face cleared and he wondered if he’d been imagining things. “Wotcher, Harry,” she said cheerfully, and gave Madam Rosmerta a parting smile before sauntering over to him.
“The Slytherins are really in for something, I reckon,” Ron said with a mouthful of food. Several crumbs flew at Harry as he spoke, and Hermione made a face beside him. “Tonks likes us all right, I bet she’ll really favor us! Serves ‘em right, they’ve got Snape on their side.”
“Oh, am I?” Harry challenged back. “You know what I think? I think you’re scared to fight me, that’s why you don’t want to practice Defense. Because you’re scared. And now you don’t have your precious father or Umbridge to back you up.”
Ron grinned at him. “Bloody well better be.” And then, he added, still grinning at the absurdity of the idea, “Anyway, it’s not like he’s staying for the hols with you, or anything.”
There were moments when he missed the clarity of the war, the single-minded purpose he’d awoken with every day. Times before sleep when he recalled how sweet the grass in the Forbidden Forest smelled, as he walked to his death between birdsong and budding trees, certain and sure. Nothing had smelled quite as sweet since.
“Oy,” Ron bellowed after them, “watch where you’re going next time!” Turning to Harry, he muttered, “I’m not even at Hogwarts, and I can’t escape them. It’s like I’ve got Prefect tattooed permanently on my forehead.”
“We haven’t done Potions in a week,” Harry insisted. “Besides, you know I’m not going to tell anyone about you using the Cruciatus Curse.”
When the Gryffindor Quidditch team assembled in the changing room on the morning of the match, Jack was already there, pacing agitatedly from one end to the other. As they crowded around him for last minute instructions, Harry noticed just how manic he looked, as if he were equally likely to run laps around the pitch or burst into tears any minute.
“Yeah,” Harry said, though he thought it sounded rather halfhearted. What Dumbledore had said about dreams had sobered him; if Harry hadn’t been so foolish and eager to believe what he saw in his head, Sirius would be alive. If not for his “saving-people thing,” as Hermione had said, if not for his belief that he knew where Sirius was, nothing in June would have happened. But Voldemort had suspected that Harry would believe his dreams without question, and Harry had fallen right into the trap. He said, hollowly, “I’ll tell them.”
'I don't know.  I don't know!  It just depends, all right?'  Harry sits still for a cold few seconds while Malfoy looks away from him, then abruptly lies down with his back to Harry.  'I'm,' Harry says.  'I thought you would know that.'
'Yeah, well, McGonagall wanted Bill,' he shrugged, removing both Ginny and his cloak. 'He was Head Boy and all, got all the N.E.W.T.s, you know. But with Fleur and the baby on the way, he couldn't. I'd planned on heading straight back to Romania, but she made a good case—do it for Hogwarts, only a year, good pay, all that. I'm closer to Mum and Dad this way, too, and can look out for you lot.'
'Harry,' she whispered; she smelled like soap and clean laundry and the flowery scent of her shampoo. At once—he could only feel relieved—it was easy again, and he was kissing her, hands on her hips, her red hair falling down around them—
“Oh.” Malfoy paused, then narrowed his eyes at him. “Does this mean I’m supposed to call you Harry?” He said Harry’s name as if it were a dripping piece of sewage.
“But I helped!” Harry protested. “If I’d been really great at Occlumency, we wouldn’t know now, and Voldemort—"
'I ate that rancid chocolate bar you shoved at me the last time we stopped,' Malfoy snaps.  'Shut up, Potter, I'm tired and I have blisters and I'm going to sleep, all right?'
"Then think about him yourself! I don't particularly like your father, if you haven't noticed. Just concentrate."
Malfoy said nothing at all; his mouth was gaping as if he were about to speak, but no words were coming out. Harry's anger was flooding out of him, and he felt the heat rise in his cheeks. "I do mean it—" he began rather irritably, but Malfoy interrupted him.
“Steady on, Potter,” Moody said gruffly. His eye spun in a dizzying whirl of blue. “We’ll straighten it out soon enough. Kingsley’s at the Ministry now, he’s got a team covering the case.”
He had never seen Hermione uncertain about anything, for when she was right, she was always right. She looked so pale and terrible, the way she always got when her parents forgot something or someone mentioned what had happened when Bellatrix had kept her in the drawing room at Malfoy Manor.
'How should I know?' Hermione says waspishly.  'Though come to think of it, Cho might be a big help.  We should really talk to one of the Ravenclaws, they might know something about Rowena that we can't find out from books.  House lore, you know.'
'Professor—' Harry begins, overcome with questions, but before he can even get the first one out, the room erupts in voices.  From every wall, portraits are calling out, 'Dumbledore!' and 'Welcome, welcome!  You're awake!'  Several former headmasters and headmistresses even rush from their frames towards Dumbledore's, to shake his hand themselves.
'Well, o' course we all wan' ter see yeh back, Harry,' Hagrid boomed, 'an' you, Hermione, an' Ron too! Professor McGonagall told me straightaway.'
'It's none of your business, Potter. Besides, we've arrived, so excuse me, I'm off to forget the pleasant memories you've just stirred.'
Dumbledore looked quietly appalled; a shocked expression came into his blue eyes. "Not feel? But Harry, how else can we reach out to the world? How would we manage, day to day, to be satisfied with our existence?"
Harry opened his mouth and shut it again. While he had never flaunted or misused the money his parents left for him, he had always taken it for granted. Sirius, too, had left him a good deal, but Harry wasn't sure it would pay for a dragon, much less for Gringotts.
He caught up with her just before the grounds sloped down towards the lake and they wrestled in the snow for a minute before Ginny panted, breathless for laughing, 'I'll let you win if we can sneak up on Ron together,' and Harry said,
'I can't imagine why,' Malfoy drawls.  'Get in the kitchen, Mudblood and Mudblood-lovers.  I'll handle this.'
Everyone is silent.  Then Hermione says, in that tentative voice that means she knows Harry will disagree, 'Maybe because Snape isn't—isn't actually working for Voldemort?'
Malfoy made a noncommittal noise. 'Help my mother redecorate, I suppose. Get my portrait done. I'd like to visit France. Maybe I'll buy a Quidditch team.'
“He jus’ gets lonely,” Hagrid said, almost mournfully. “Yeh go in the forest an’ yeh can hear ‘im bellowin’, like he’s lookin’ for a mate—"
Harry wasn’t aware he was flushing in horror. He had turned towards the door, luckily, and Ron was too busy brushing his teeth to notice anything.
“It could be that you wanted to get me in trouble,” Harry mused, “but then, I’m not doing anything wrong. In fact, it’s hours until curfew. So maybe you wanted to get me alone so you could get me back for what happened with your dad, is that it?” He saw a glint of fury in Malfoy’s eyes and pressed onward. “Bet you were furious about having him gone, huh? The Ministry taking your stuff, all your money taken. Did you have a rotten summer, Malfoy? Want to make me pay for it? Because you can try, if you want, but we’ve all seen what rubbish you are at Defense.”
“There wasn’t anything going on!” Harry snapped, his voice rising. Ignoring the fact that he was fighting with Draco and still sticking up for him, he pushed on, “Look, at least he didn’t go off to the Manor and meet Voldemort, all right?”
'Yeah, Luna and Dean came with us, they're just outside,' Bill said. 'Here, let's go into the kitchen. You can open our present there.'
It wasn’t that he didn’t like it. Granted, he’d come almost immediately, but Tonks had only laughed and patted him on the head, as if he was—well, as if he was a sixteen year old boy in her Defense class. “All right, Harry?” she’d said, and he thought he’d nodded, and somehow he had ended up in the corridor headed for Gryffindor Tower, scarcely able to remember if she’d done up his trousers for him or not. (She had.)
Caught entirely unprepared, wand still in his pocket, Harry’s mind swam. His thoughts raced with images, flashing by him . . . he was in the hall of the house on Privet Drive and Dudley was shoving him backwards . . . he was at the club in Diagon Alley and Malfoy was sneering at him . . . the Knight Bus was pulling up beside him . . . Tonks was grinding up against him in a blur of neon shapes and pulsing lights . . . Sirius’s laughter was fading to shock as he arced backwards, out of sight . . .
Malfoy looks at Katie like she might be one of Hagrid's more disgusting creatures and mutters, 'I sent that necklace that cursed you.'  After a long pause, and a hard poke in the back from Harry, he adds unrepentantly, 'Sorry.'
“Shows how much you know,” Draco spat. “You think you’re such a hero, Potter, you think you’ve got everybody pegged, don’t you? You and your fucking simple answers—"
They trooped up to Gryffindor together, marveling at how changed the castle was from the time they saw it last. Ginny seemed delighted with the repair, pointing out places where there had been holes or where the ceiling had caved in, but to Harry it was a strange sort of amnesia, as if the battle had never been. Hermione seemed to think so too, for she frowned the whole walk up.
