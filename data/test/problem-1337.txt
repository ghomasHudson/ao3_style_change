“So?” Draco said, straightening.
“Funny,” said Pansy flatly. “The way you said it just now, I don’t think you do.”
them, and if that wasn’t enough, you’ve had Dobby watching him, too!”
“I wonder what would happen if I were to…target memories, rather than letting them surface on their own,” he said one night. On the shelf behind him, the Pensieve rippled wildly; this was nothing new, nor was the silvery light it gave off, but that night, both seemed almost threatening. “There have been several instances where you have spoken aloud, or moved slightly, to protect yourself from my attacks, but these have been irregular and completely external. Perhaps raising the proverbial stakes will get us the results we’re looking for: an
Mr Malfoy whirled around and raised his walking cane. The silver snake on top caught the light as he gestured with it, saying, “Watch your tongue. I
Draco opened his eyes and Professor Snape’s sallow face came back into focus. The man’s lips ticked upward into a smile so slight, someone less familiar with him would not have described it as such. “A great first start, Draco,” he said.
The morning of the Malfoys’ trip to Diagon Alley dawned slowly. Draco, having long decided that sleep was going to elude him once again, had spent most of the night stretched out on his window seat, pouring over more books. As the sun started to peek over the tall hedges surrounding the back gardens, Draco stopped reading, fixing his gaze on the brightening sky to see if that alone could make morning come quicker.
“I think practical experience will do you well. Magical theory can only get you so far. Now.” Professor Snape moved to stand in front of him. “I want you to understand what is about to happen before it does. I will utter a spell to enter your mind. There, I will be able to glimpse your memories and thoughts, and it is your job to…kick me out, as it were. Using your wand if you wish, but I do not want you using that as a crutch. You have the power to stop a mental invasion with just your thoughts, and it will be less suspicious if you do so when it becomes necessary.
“Yeah.” said Potter. He gave Draco a sly grin. “Yours?”
“Never mind,” said Potter.
Ron bent close. “Blimey, you look just like him,” he said, looking at Harry like he was something he had stepped in.
“You would choose to lie, right after I’ve seen evidence to the contrary?”
,” she added, making Hermione and Ron’s smiles droop, “make your visit quick. I’m expecting the Headmaster and your heads of houses, and I won’t tolerate a crowded ward.”
Draco seized his water glass and took a large gulp, but he was shaking so much that he ended up spilling half of it onto himself. Cursing, he leapt out of bed to change.
She backed away. “What’s
“…and of course,” Pansy was saying, “I know you didn’t mean to ignore me the whole time, but conversation doesn’t flow as easily with Crabbe and Goyle when you don’t say anything. I don’t know how you talk to them, the thick sods…” to which Draco nodded absently.
“Hullo, Pansy,” he said. “Doing all right?”
“All right, all right, don’t get your knickers in a twist. Follow my lead.” He winked at Potter and then shoved him, hard, into a couple of the passing students. “Ugh, I don’t have time for this, Malfoy! I need to get to class.” Draco started down the corridor, hoping Potter would follow him.
“I’d call that mildly successful,” Draco said cheerfully, to no one in particular. Next to him, Pansy giggled.
she was thinking. She was in public!”
Draco stood. “Okay, sir,” he said, and for the first time since their meetings had begun, left Professor Snape’s office feeling confident in his abilities.
Draco pulled gently on a couple strands to point out their disarray. “Under what circumstances would Draco Malfoy ever leave his room looking like this, hmm?”
“Of course I am. Obviously I want to figure out what’s going on, who’s cursed us and why, but right now I’m more concerned about whether we’re done.” Draco dropped his voice to a whisper. “What if we’re not?”
“No-ho-ho!” said Potter. “It’s Harry. Just Harry.”
Weasley bent forward, putting his hands on his knees. “Don’t you get it?” he said quietly. “He’s doing what you do to
“Keep in mind, though, that the memories you choose would have to be things you don’t
“Really.” There was a dangerous gleam in Pansy’s eye now. “Even before we met Potter, you were already talking about him — what he might look like, what you were going to say when you met him, what House he would end up in, whether he knew anything about the Wizarding world, whether he would be good at Quidditch — and after you officially met him, you only got worse! You bring him up constantly,” she said, reaching for her tea again. “
Potter’s eyes widened as he realised who had spoken. “
. His skin was very wrinkly even though he was fairly young, and he stood only about two feet tall, which made his overly large eyes and ears even more prominent. He was, as usual, dressed in a dingy pillowcase.
“And he loves attention, if you hadn’t guessed.” Pansy’s eyes locked intently onto Harry’s, like she expected him to pick up on information she’d hidden in her words. “Specifically yours,” she added.
“Dobby,” he called.
“Draco,” Professor Snape said, bringing him back to the present, “you didn’t do as I asked. You
Draco turned to look at her. Pansy’s hand was beneath her head and her straight-across bangs had fallen to one side; her brown eyes were kind, but Draco couldn’t find the words to tell her anything. He rolled his head so he was facing the ceiling. In the corner of his vision, he saw Pansy do the same.
, when he discovered Draco was finally starting to understand him. That Draco’s resentment was starting to fade.
“You wants
So it was. There were suddenly students in the corridor, and through the window steam billowed, obscuring everything but the slightest hint of brick. After what had seemed like mere minutes to Draco, they had arrived at platform nine and three-quarters.
“Yes,” Draco said, feeling very drained. He ducked his head; the desktop shook beneath his forming tears. He didn’t want to cry; he didn't want to look weak.
Both bits of dialogue I used this chapter are from Chamber of Secrets. The Borgin and Bukes scene is from chapter 4, "Flourish and Blotts" pp. 51-53, and the infamous Flourish and Blotts scene dialogue comes from pp. 58, 60-63
is happening,” he said, scowling as he gestured at the bars.
“There’s something else I’d like, actually,” said Draco. “The diary Father was hiding all summer— I’d like to know if it’s on the train. Summon it for me, won’t you?”
, and entered a fantasy he hadn’t let himself fully create: Potter’s winning smile being directed at him, instead of at unworthy
“The same applies to you,” said Potter.
“Draco,” his mother called. She stood in front of the desk, tired but grinning, and motioned for Draco to join her. “There’s something here.”
“I think that’s enough for the night,” said Professor Snape. He set his wand down on his desk. “Take a week off; practice clearing your mind. You were thinking of other things when you came here tonight, and now you know the danger that presents. When you have mastered Occlumency, those changes in mood will be less of a problem, but in the early stages, they interrupt your focus.
“Are you saying we’ve switched
“I think I want to leave for King’s Cross early today, if that’s all right,” said Draco on the first of September. He was in the process of melting a pat of butter into his waffles.
get the information he wanted. It was only a matter of time before Granger let something slip about Potter— something Draco didn’t already know…
“This looks right,” he said, finally. The tiredness that had left his face crept over it again. “All of this looks right.”
Big, big thanks to everyone who supported me, both on and offline, during my hiatus. You're all so sweet and I appreciate you immensely <3 <3
Draco landed heavily on his bedroom floor. “Take me back!” He scrambled up and seized the front of Dobby’s pillowcase. “Take me back THIS INSTANT!”
Potter shook his head in exasperation. “Oh, come on, we all know you were faking—”
“Sit, Draco,” Professor Snape instructed, gesturing vaguely toward the wooden chair in front of his office desk. It was the second day of the new term, during a break from classes he and Professor Snape shared.
“How am I supposed to answer that, Malfoy?”
Draco blinked. There was something on the ceiling, but…wait, that wasn’t right. He swivelled on the bench until he was facing the other direction. He didn’t know how he could have missed it, but while he’d been playing, a tree had grown behind him— a large, but delicate thing with silvery leaves and long branches weighed down by strings of golden flowers. Yellow acacia.
He had never intended to be Potter’s enemy. He wanted to be so much more than that.
Potter shifted beneath his sheets. “Er, I’d say about three minutes?”
Professor Snape sighed. “Do not blame me for this.”
A bell clanged as Draco and his father entered the shop. The dim room was filled with all sorts of dark artefacts: jewelry and precious gems, bones of indeterminate species, masks with changing faces, jars filled with suspicious liquids, metal hooks that threatened to fall from the ceiling, and a large black cabinet that swung shut right as they entered the building.
Pansy was barking. She had been there with him through each failed attempt, why else would she…
“You put up a decent defense, but the memories you used to block my search were no less damning than the one you intended to conceal.”
“It’s not my fault,” Draco defended, “The teachers all have favourites, that Hermione Granger—”
“Hm?” Draco said, drawn back to himself by the urgency of Potter’s voice. His grey eyes were intense when Draco met them.
“And if I don’t want to go to Borgin and Burkes?” Draco asked, testing his father’s temper.
Draco smacked his arm. “Cheeky. The correct answer is never. You
“What,” Draco asked, “is
“Thank you, Draco,” said the Dark Lord in his cold voice. The force of it stirred the back of Draco’s hair weakly. “This has been highly instructive.”
Well I didn’t make my self-assigned deadline, but that’s all right. I was really having a rough go of it, trying to balance Snape being a good teacher while keeping him in character, so I spent a bit longer than I’d originally wanted ironing out the issues. I hope it’s worth the wait; I’m much happier with it now.
“Is that a
“Suspicions confirmed. Honestly, Potter, a little hair potion, like this one” — Draco grabbed a jar off the desk — “could tame even Granger’s tangle. But you don’t want to use too much. Only two fingers’ worth of product, or it’ll look greasy.”
“Shall we get started, then?” said Lockhart, to the sound of cheers and applause. He chuckled. “All right.”
They Disapparated, leaving in their wake a patch of shrivelling bulrushes.
I must not tell lies
It seemed he was safe— or at least, as safe as he could be. Professor Snape had taught him well.
“Well, well, well,” said Mr Malfoy, coming from nowhere and putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Arthur Weasley.”
Draco stretched to pick up the bottle of wine. Its label read:
“You didn’t either.” Blaise looked at Pansy. “Told him finally, have you?”
“Of course,” Draco said, bowing his head. He didn’t ask what the Dark Lord had seen, he knew exactly what he’d shown the man: only the things that would corroborate his family’s memories of the events. Draco also didn’t ask what would come of their letting Potter go; Draco was sure to find out eventually, and didn’t dare bring punishment on himself early.
“You wouldn’t like me to be normal,” Draco spat, and turned resolutely in the opposite direction. “It would be very boring. Since I’m your enemy, that wouldn’t be very good of me, would it? Being boring?”
“Good lord, you’re thick,” Draco responded. “And Potter, you could look a little less surprised yourself. What did you think, that this was going to stop here? Who would curse us so that only—?” He cut himself off. Potter’s hair had begun streaking itself with blonde. The effect made him appear as though he was rapidly aging. “See for yourself. I imagine my hair’s got black in it now.”
“How did you manage it, by the way?” Potter continued, “I’ve been struggling for so long, I’ve given up.”
Draco scowled at him. “No, you boulder, I don’t. Though I can’t say I’m surprised
“Right,” said Draco for the fifth time, and lazily flicked his wand at a grasshopper, sending it up into the air. He watched as it kicked out its legs, trying to bound forward, not understanding that it was no longer on the ground.
It was nice, being that much taller than Malfoy for a change. Granted, it was only about a two-inch height difference, but that, combined with Pansy’s Draco Malfoy lessons, gave Harry a strange sort of confidence. It made him less concerned about the stares he and Malfoy were getting from this exchange.
Pansy sighed. “I will be.”
would be affected. The Muggle-borns were even more important, how could Draco have forgotten?
“What was different this time,” Professor Snape said delicately, changing tack, “that caused you to push against me, rather than give me another memory as you have done in the past?”
“I'm so sorry, Draco,” she said, looking genuinely upset. “I wanted you to spend more time understanding Potter, rather than abusing him all the time. It’s quite taxing on us all. Me especially.”
“You can’t be serious, Lucius?” said a thin voice Draco didn’t recognise. “I don’t imagine a mere Act would allow them into our homes. They would need some indication, some tip-off, that we even have what they’re looking for, no?”
Dobby lowered his head. “Sir, Mistress had Dobby try the same thing many times— it has not worked any time Dobby has tried.”
Mr Malfoy sighed. “You did not answer my question. How are your friends? Blaise, Pansy?”
“—This plan the Dark Lord has entrusted to your father…” Mrs Malfoy was saying, “I have a plan in case He is unhappy with the results.”
Dobby grinned. “Too, sir?”
“Did it work?” Draco asked, when he saw no change, no blast of colour from his mother’s wand.
, or you’ll be receiving a hefty bill when this is all over.”
“But I’m not
Draco grabbed Potter’s arm and strode over to the far side of the bathroom. This, strangely, made Potter laugh even harder— No, now it was more like he was giggling…
Professor Snape ignored him. “I am more concerned that you let me see so much of the fantasy before trying to break away.”
The “Trip Jix, Potter!” quote comes from book 5, pp. 609 (chapter 27, “The Centaur and the Sneak”); the Witch Weekly excerpt is from book 4, pp. 511-512 (chapter 27, “Padfoot Returns”); the McGonagall quote from the Yule Ball is from book 4, pp. 413 (chapter 23, “The Yule Ball”); the dementors quote is from book 3, pp. 159 (chapter 8, “Flight of the Fat Lady”); and the quotes from the final section are from book 7, pp. 458-459 and 474 (chapter 23, “Malfoy Manor”).
She smoothed Draco’s hair, then gasped a bit, pulled him closer, and kissed him again.
by Miranda Goshawk. Try to be quick, Draco,” he said, with yet another glance at his watch.
“And you, Mr Malfoy?” she asked.
In the days leading up to the Malfoys’ trip to London, Draco spent even more time in their library. On the whole, the lack of concrete details authors could provide about the Chamber, and the use of the same sort of phrases over and over again, was frustrating. Aside from the suspicious death of a Hogwarts student in 1943, there was no real proof it existed, but if Draco’s father believed it was real, Draco thought he should assume the same.
But now really wasn’t the time to wax poetic about how pretty Potter was. The icy hand was in this memory, too…
Draco sighed, rested his hands on the back of the chair, then contorted his face into a smile with way too many teeth. “Hello…” He paused, thinking, “Haribold, lovely day, isn't it?”
“Nothing. Just, erm… We need to get you out of here before everyone wakes up,” Potter said.
Mr Malfoy’s eyes creased with a hidden smile, but he said nothing. Draco’s mother had a similar expression.
“He’s making it very difficult to exist in public,” Draco said one night, after being accosted by Potter outside the toilet.
Malfoy, who was already sitting up in bed, also seemed to have noticed the issue. He waved an overlong green sleeve at Harry, saying, “Take off your clothes.”
“Yes, sir.”
Harry glanced over his shoulder to find Malfoy standing only in his pants and looking thoughtfully at Harry’s. Harry covered as much of himself as he could. “Turn your back!”
After a long while, Draco said, “I’m ready.” And he was. The memories he’d chosen might not work the way Professor Snape had intended, but he felt much better about starting there, and then moving into more dangerous territory if it was necessary. Merlin, but he hoped it wouldn’t be.
“Never thought I’d hear you say that,” Potter teased, shaking Draco’s hand.
But was he ready to go back in yet? The memory of last time was very fresh… Draco swayed where he stood in the entry, and braced a hand against the doorframe. Tears threatened behind his blinking eyes.
*******
“What’s that?” Pansy asked, glimpsing the photograph of Potter in the top drawer.
“It’s a lot nicer than I r- than I thought it would be,” said Harry, deciding not to let on that he’d been there before.
“Yes, fine. Been keeping busy,” she said shortly.
“Dobby,” he said roughly, “Get me out of here. One more moment and I’ll set the place on fire.”
“True,” said Pansy. “Maybe I shouldn’t be surprised, Draco thinks you’re hilarious.”
Freezing with one foot above the next step, Draco looked down at himself. His excitement dulled. “Why, what’s wrong with this?”
“Any more recent changes? (“No.”) Temperature fluctuations? (“No.”) Dizziness? (“No.”) Do you think you’ve fully transformed? I see you’ve switched clothes.”
“My family are fine where we are—”
“Wow, Harry— that must’ve been fifty feet!”
been doing such a poor job, it’s a wonder we haven’t been discovered yet.”
The force of Pansy’s howling made her lean over; she clutched at the bathroom counter to keep from falling off. “Keep- keep going.”
“There’s one way we could figure it out, Malfoy,” said Potter. He said it softly, like he was afraid of upsetting Draco.
“‘Course I can,” Potter said with a pert smile. “It’s more whether I care to do anything about it.”
“Last year… Is your…
stop thinking of Potter, it isn’t helping you to do so.”
“However,” he added, turning towards Draco, “I do not wish for our holiday to interfere with your studies, so when we leave will depend on you.”
Draco’s eyes ticked between Professor Snape’s black ones, but he couldn’t read any emotion there— there were no clues as to what he was thinking: no hint of amusement in the lines of his mouth, no disapproval between his eyebrows.
Professor Snape gave a curt nod.
“Tell me what you meant by that,” Draco ordered.
“If you are indeed correct, Malfoy,” said Madam Pomfrey seriously, “you have a long night ahead of you. And if Potter’s…discomfort is anything like yours, a painful night.”
It came to that.
“Yeah, well it feels wrong.”
“Yeah.” Draco was grateful Potter had gotten that far, but it didn’t make his next words easier… “According to the book the curse came from,” he said, pulling Pansy’s book out and motioning for Potter to take it, “we— We have to…kiss.”
At this, Mrs Malfoy’s hands clenched around her cutlery.
Draco shrugged. “Sounds good to me, sir.” At this point, he was confident he could distract Professor Snape from anything…unsavoury that might pop into his head.
would have teased him for the smile that kept touching his lips.
He hadn’t, actually — not explicitly — but Draco figured now wasn’t the time to bring that up. “What’s the good if I’m not on the House team?” he said with a glance at the cabinet on the far wall. “Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. He’s not even that good, it’s just because he’s
The pair approached the counter and Mr Malfoy dinged another bell. There was a thump from the back room.
“What?” Potter said distractedly.
“Not really,” Draco admitted.
“Happy to be of service,” Draco said through his teeth.
“Hang on,” said Potter, dropping his school bag onto the floor with a thump. “I was just trying to do what
,” said Granger, her eyes flashing, “did I.”
“Draco and I are busy,” Pansy announced. “Go find somewhere else to lurk.”
Professor Snape slowly twisted his wand, guiding Draco’s thoughts back to the first scene:
“He does,” said Pansy, turning to examine herself in the mirror. She ruffled her dark bangs and then spread them more evenly across her forehead.
TRIGGER WARNING: mention of canonical abuse of Dobby. It's not shown "on-screen," but Draco doesn't handle it very gracefully or thoughtfully. More discussion of this in the end notes, which is where I've also put my Victorian flower language info/resource.
Also exceptional were Mr Potter’s actions inside Hogwarts: it is rumoured he defeated a fully grown mountain troll
“Taken in?”
He hated Potter. He hated him, of course he did. Draco had decided so, and that, he supposed, made it real enough.
Pansy tutted, then said, airily, “You mean you gave up.”
“Taken in,” Pansy said again, and Harry thought he might finally understand what she was implying.
“I know, I know,” Potter replied, smirking in a way that looked like he was trying to fight it. He sat on the edge of Draco’s bed. “You going to help me fix it, or what?”

*******
“Draco, leave us!” said Mr Malfoy, turning away from his wife.
Draco clasped the back of his neck. All of a sudden, he didn’t know where to look. Potter’s smile was sure to disappear the moment Draco told him, he was convinced of it. “You're not going to like it…”
“You need help getting there, or are you good?”
“Very much so. Eventually, we will move on to keeping your mind sealed entirely, but we’ll work up to that. What I hope to accomplish next — forcing someone out of your head — involves two things: one, recognising that they’re there with you, and two, using that knowledge to ground yourself. And very often the first leads to the second. Awareness that you’re not alone can ground you, giving you the necessary desire and force to eject the intruder. Do you understand?”
“Not yet,” Draco admitted. “Nothing more than, sometimes, a sort of…vague notion that I want to escape, or hide, or something— but that’s probably what I was feeling the first time I went through those things, not anything new I’m feeling there, in the moment.”
“Today I will begin by targeting a specific memory,” Professor Snape said, when their meeting began. “Sometime over the holidays, your mother spoke to you about getting Occlumency lessons from me, am I correct?”
Draco blinked his tears away. “Right.”
Mrs Malfoy gave him a kind smile. “If you do as I ask, neither will the Dark Lord.”
“Our son,” said Mr Malfoy shortly, “I might remind you, is a pureblood.”
“No! I stopped trying to keep him away from Hogwarts a while ago.”
“No? What about the other students? Half-bloods and Muggle-borns, all potential victims.” Mrs Malfoy stood, her chair scraping from the movement. “But I suppose those are your targets, aren’t they? They’re other people’s
Pushing aside his covers, Draco padded over to his desk, where he spent the next hour carefully resealing each letter. He had never used a Re-Sealing Charm before and it was really quite tedious, drawing his wand steadily over the uneven paper, healing the rips. Ultimately though, Draco was proud of his work. The letters looked as if they had never been opened. Potter wouldn’t suspect a thing.
The letters.
“Come, Draco,” Mr Malfoy called. “Good day to you, Mr Borgin. I’ll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.”
She looked to Draco. “For now,” he said.
Draco scowled. Ginny Weasley, now staring brazenly at Potter, had made herself an enemy. She was lucky they were in a Muggle train station, or she might have been jinxed.
“Here,” said Hermione, holding Harry’s robes out to him. Then she seemed to think better of it. “Actually, I guess they’re for Malfoy now? Since they’ll fit?” She handed them to the other boy.
“Yes, sir,” Draco said, pulling out his own wand. He turned it nervously in his palm. He hoped the memories he’d picked would work the way Professor Snape intended them to. The man had been nothing but supportive, yet Draco knew he could do better. He needed to do better.
stop it, somehow. I’ll go write to a couple of friends over at St Mungo’s, see if anything like this has ever been reported.
“Agreed,” said Harry, who had just discovered the same thing. He shuddered. “I'd have to burn them later.”
Life as Harry Potter proved far more difficult than Draco thought it would be. Everywhere he went, people stared at him, or got in his way, or in the case of that little Creevey boy, took pictures of him at inopportune moments. And Potter’s friends were, impossibly, more annoying than they seemed on the surface level. The worst offence was that they never really listened to him when he complained about Potter. Even when Pansy was tired of hearing about him, Draco always had Crabbe and Goyle.
“Upstairs.”
Professor Snape nodded sagely. “Your protective instincts are strong, as we have established. And you’ve already understood how to distract from memories you do not wish intruders to see— despite what you may believe, that is a fairly advanced skill. With a little more grace, you will have mastered that one aspect of Occlumency. So what we must do is give those distractions more…purpose, more conscious thought.”
Professor Snape said something else after that, but Draco didn’t hear it. The darkness of his eyelids gave way to streaks of colour and light, which quickly turned into less abstract images…it was like slipping into a dream—
. It was hard to believe.
have high expectations for his future and wish Mr Potter the best in all his endeavours.
to learn a spell that called even more attention to himself.
“Hmph. You’ll take me back tomorrow, understood?” Draco ordered. “I’ll behave.”
“Yes,” he said, feeling rather guilty. He should have thought of reaching out to his mother for help, rather than waiting for her to say something. She had already proven, many times over, that she was on his side. “We should do that. How long have you been looking for it?”
“Come in.”
“Do you think Father will fail?” Draco asked flatly, trying not to sound like he was making an accusation.
A new memory began; something Draco didn’t draw forward himself, but allowed to surface:
Crabbe frowned in confusion, and his eyebrows lowered so that they were visible beneath his horrendous bowl haircut. “But…if you don’t want them dead, what do you want?”
“You’re against his plan, then,” said Pansy. It wasn’t a question.
“Yes.”
The elf materialised, a soapy sponge clutched loosely in his hand. “Sir?”
Harry Potter, at the bright young age of eleven, has already accomplished a great deal. Our sources inform us of the shocking tale of Mr Potter’s busy first year at Hogwarts— a tale full of broken records, an encounter with a troll, and the recovery of a legendary artefact.
“Not explicitly.”
up to me, Father. You know full well she’s only top of the class because all the professors love her.” He set down the salad fork with a heavy clang. He was no longer hungry. “If they graded fairly, I’d be top of the class. I’m much smarter than she is.”
“You idiots!” Pansy cried. “
fine, but Draco Malfoy has higher standards.”
Daily Prophet
“…doesn’t
“I didn’t let you win, no,” Draco said with a chuckle. “As far as I’m concerned, nothing has changed between us.”
There was a sort of pressure on the back of Draco’s neck— it was cold, exactly like what Professor Snape had described years ago, back in his office…
follow them down to their very tips, far into the dark, then pick one root and follow that. Picture a seed at the very end, cracked wide open, and picture that root coiled tightly against the seed’s smooth inner wall.
Dobby opened his mouth in protest, but Draco spoke faster: “Get rid of it and fix this mess,” he said, and stormed out.
“All right then,” Draco said, doing as he’d been asked. “But I don’t see how this will—”
Draco chuckled, then reached out to comb the final strands of Potter’s hair into place. “There,” he said when he was satisfied.
As they entered the shop, Draco was reminded again of how much he liked Flourish and Blotts. It was one of the oldest buildings in Diagon Alley, and it showed. The ceilings sloped and none of the floors were entirely level. The whole place smelled of new and ancient books alike, which were shoved in every available slot on every shelf and piled upon every available surface, threatening to fall from their tippy stacks. Everything appeared as it always had, save for some photographs of Gilderoy Lockhart that were arranged on a table at the back of the shop.
As always, my Victorian flower language resource is "The Project Gutenberg eBook, Language of Flowers" by Kate Greenaway, which is accessible at http://www.gutenberg.org/files/31591/31591-h/31591-h.htm.
Potter chuckled brightly. “That’s the best thing I’ve heard you say, ever.”
“What were you doing, then? I’m sure you don’t want me to keep this forever.”
Draco faltered. “You knew?”
"At the end of the root, there is an open seed pod. Reach for it, weigh it in your hand— take note of how light it truly is, how small. Look inside and see the tiny brown root coiled tightly against the wall of the seed. With your empty hand, call the tree to you; watch as it contracts and simplifies, rushing toward you and reducing itself to a tiny sapling in your palm. Tuck the sapling into the seed, minding the papery leaves and thin stem, and shut the seed. It will click. Then bend down one final time; tuck the seed in the damp dirt and smooth it over.

“Malfoy…” Potter started.
“Well
“Do you have it, then?”
“Yes. We’ll see if it stops there. Your glasses?" Draco demanded, holding out a hand for them. “I refuse to spend another moment squinting. It’s undignified.”
Draco pushed his face into the sheets. Had he wasted his life worshipping his father? It had never amounted to much, anyway. What did it matter to Mr Malfoy that Draco excelled in school when there was one person above him as head of the class? What did it matter to Mr Malfoy that Draco was an excellent Quidditch player when Harry Potter had become the youngest Seeker in over a century, when Potter had stolen the attention with a single, skillful dive?
“Painful?” Pansy repeated.
“I'm fine, Blaise,” Draco said primly, more out of frustration than truth. “Go back to bed.”
them— you’ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes,” he heard Weasley say. Seconds later, he sent a screaming gnome flying over the hedge and into the field behind it.
Draco examined the photograph of Potter more closely. Someone had taken a candid shot of him smiling at Granger and Weasley in King’s Cross Station, right before he left with his family. Potter really needed to brush his hair, or cut it, or
to end up in Azkaban?”
“That's not what we're talking about right now.” Draco and Granger locked eyes. “But yes. He is.”
It was unfair that Potter could forge such strong bonds with people he’d barely known when Draco had to work so hard to keep the friendships he’d had since birth. Potter didn’t have to follow the same unwritten rules; he had Granger and Weasley. Potter, somehow, had “Love.”
The hospital wing was dark, save for a lonely light over a single bed. The occupant was shrouded by two figures that Draco could not make out, even when squinting. They turned at the sound of someone entering the room. Madam Pomfrey and Weasley’s faces took shape as Draco approached, but they were still somewhat out of focus. On his way to the hospital wing, Draco’s other eye had become as blurry as the left. Though he didn’t have a mirror, Draco figured they were both green now.
Pansy sighed and resettled herself against the tree. In the distance, one of the peafowls cried. “I suppose that means you were thinking about him on the train, too?” she said.
Harry choked. “What?”
“But did you want it to be about that?” Potter said hesitantly.
. It was infuriating.

Draco cast the parchment aside to stare out of the window, his lip curling at the horribly intimate view of the neighbours Potter had been stuck with for the past four days.
Hope y'all are staying safe in all aspects of the word (emotionally, physically, etc.); if safety's not something you can currently find, I hope your situation changes for the better very soon. Sending you my love <33
“And what if this gets worse?” said Malfoy softly.
“Great,” said Draco. He grabbed Dobby’s arm. “Take me to Potter’s.”
“Why I said it out loud, Malfoy.”
Potter locked the door— a sound that thundered against the stone walls. Draco’s heart echoed in his chest at what seemed like the same level as he realised: Potter was staring at him for the first time that morning.
Incendio
. The memory you chose was unremarkable, yes, but it quickly devolved into other, more incriminating ones, and even fantasies. Now, I gave you a good chance to take back control, but when it became clear to me that you would not, I had to end the spell. The Dark Lord would not do the same; He would press you harder for the information.
Again.
“Oh,” Draco said. “Yes, I am. Er… Good night, then, Professor.” He stood slowly, and shoved his wand into his pocket.
Pansy folded her arms. “Just now.”
“I do, though. Don’t pretend I’m stupid just because I’m saying things you don’t want to hear.”
“What good would come of hexing the Dursleys?”
Mr Borgin took the list. “The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?”
— plenty of information to write a sufficient essay, as Draco had (though he supposed he had relied more on previous knowledge of Uric the Oddball, which Granger wouldn’t have had, but that was beside the point). And the essay was, after all, only meant to demonstrate how much they remembered from the past year. Granger was clearly trying to go beyond what was expected of them to show him up, like always.
Granger clarified: “Harry’s always going on about you, like, ‘Malfoy looks tired, do you think he’s sleeping enough? Should I ask him? I should ask him.’ ‘I think Malfoy’s plotting something; I’m going to follow him; why aren't you guys helping me watch him?’ ‘No, of course I’m not obsessed with Malfoy.’ That sort of thing.”
“You aren’t serious?” Mrs Malfoy asked from across the long table.
She hit him waggishly. “No, you weren’t supposed to say that. You were supposed to say—” she put on a high, squeaky voice— “
Quotes from the de-gnoming scene are from Chamber of Secrets, chapter 3 "The Burrow," pp. 37.

“And, I might add, you have no right to tell me how to insult you. You’re even worse at that than you are at flying.”
There was someone watching. Draco was sure of that now.
oblivious. These searches will be conducted in homes whose owners are, or have been, suspicious. As one or both of those apply to our majority, I would advise extreme caution, and either concealing very well your illicit items or getting rid of them entirely.”
“Right,” said Potter. He followed Draco into the adjoining room.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said sarcastically, “was I distracting you from something important? By all means, we can sit here in silence if that’s what you want.”
“Yes, Father,” Draco said, before turning on his heel to go back to his bedroom.
caught Draco’s eye. He was forced to wait an agonising twenty minutes before Mr Malfoy finally set the paper down. Its pages barely touched the tablecloth before Draco snatched it up. He flipped straight to the centre page and, under his father’s disapproving stare, began to read the accompanying article.
Draco turned back to the letter.
The boy sighed and then dramatically flung his sheets aside. “Both of you, utterly useless. What would you have done if I hadn’t been awake?”
“I don't remember there being a section on the transformations being painful… Of course, I never got many details from that night. Blaise only remembered you leaving, and Potter didn’t want to talk about it… Ah, here we are,” said Pansy, finally landing on the right page.
“Less fair.”
“No, but you did something very interesting at the end there, that’s why I pulled you out. You altered the memory. Do you remember doing so?”
*******
Merlin, but Draco wished he had gone with them. They might have taken him, had things worked out differently— had the Dark Lord not been on the way, had Draco been given longer to consider Dumbledore’s deal, had Draco for once said what he actually meant and told Potter everything before it was too late… But Draco knew enough and had practiced enough to keep those thoughts buried deeply in metaphysical dirt…
Draco pressed the side of his face more firmly into his pillow. “I don’t know what you mean. If I’m to become Harry Potter, it’s in body only— I haven’t gotten access to your thoughts. Though if I had, I bet they’d be really mundane — you aren’t very interesting, you know — so maybe I’m better off…”
He threw open his closet doors and started inspecting his clothes. His appearance had to be carefully crafted; he sought to find something that effortlessly drew the eye to him, but wasn’t too garish or unflattering. Of course, Draco didn’t really have anything like that in his closet, but today he was pickier than usual. He was
appeared on the parchment.) He shared some of the blame, after all. If Draco hadn’t written his father so many times last year about everything Hogwarts had done wrong, his father might not have taken action to “improve” the school. Maybe if he knew more about the Chamber, he could keep it from opening and Potter would be safe— Draco would get to see him again, see him happy…
, per se — it’s not like we’ve got to murder someone or anything—”
“Be careful,” said Granger, “or you’ll lose your whole hand next.”
Normalcy was shattered, however, when some new, startling information emerged. There was a plot to remove all the Muggle-borns from Hogwarts, which meant the Chamber of Secrets would be opened for the first time in fifty years.
“Pansy!”
The first big test came Wednesday night at dinner.
Every time he glanced at his school books, he felt a pang of remembrance that Potter had no access whatsoever to his own. Every time he climbed onto his broomstick to practice for the Slytherin Quidditch team tryouts, he recalled that Potter’s was locked away. Every time he smelled the rich, decadent food Dobby always prepared, it turned his stomach to imagine the scraps Potter was eating, or to wonder if he had been allowed to eat at all that day. Because Potter could starve and no one would know, apart from Draco, Dobby, the Dursleys, and probably the Ministry.
Thankfully, none of the portraits said anything as he made his stuttering walk past, but regardless, Draco waited until he was on the second floor to start running, and didn’t stop until he reached his bedroom on the third.
Also I did a bit of direct quoting from the books this chapter. See the end notes for page numbers.
Draco’s scowl deepened when he caught sight of Weasley smirking. “Think this is funny, do you, Weasley? I’d curb that amusement if I were you. If I’m right, your best mate’s about to turn into me, for who knows how long.”
“You think…?” Draco gasped. “
“I think I’ve found it, Draco!” she said, eyes bright. “The diary! It’s in your father’s study, I saw him carry it in.”
“Yes,” Draco said. “Pansy’s already yelled at me for it, as you heard. Can’t we move on?”
Draco’s green eyes found the ceiling. “Of course I do. I’m sure I speak for the both of us when I say I’m very eager to get back into my own body, but short of repeating myself again, I’ll just ask: are you, or are you not, ready to turn back into yourself?”
Draco leapt up and pulled on his dressing robe. “Let’s go.”
“That bad, huh?” Potter asked.
“I suppose we could keep trying this, but I don’t want to make either of you uncomfortable,” said Madam Pomfrey. “I’ll keep you under observation for a day or so, but there’s nothing physically wrong with you, apart from…well.
Wordlessly, Potter held them out. Draco snatched them up, unfolded them, and held them up in the light, peering warily through the glass.
“Yeah, but it was only the first thing that came to mind…” Potter’s head tilted to one side. “I wasn’t really asking for it back. You know that, right?”
Good. Let them think the Dursleys were behind it.
Draco ran to his desk and tore through the top drawer. He pulled out Potter’s letters and started rifling through them madly. When he found the one he wanted, he ripped it open and skimmed, his finger trailing along after his eyes. “‘Also, I’m considering kidnapping you. Just so you aren’t surprised if I show up.'
“And,” said Draco, who couldn’t believe the words he was about to say, “it wasn’t an awful place to start. I’ll just—” He gestured for Pansy to scoot over. “Dobby?”
Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips. “Hmm. Well, we’ll do another examination, make sure nothing’s wrong with your insides.”
“But it’s not as simple as doing a countercurse.” Potter frowned as he connected the few bits of information Draco had provided. “It’s something we have to do, then. Was Madam Pomfrey right? Does it involve…more contact?”
“It’s not my intention; the memories I see are mainly those you choose to show me.”
talking. Do what you want with everyone else.”
that he would be getting much, much more than my book,
Draco froze. “This is different,” he said, unwilling to admit that Pansy was right. Because she was. Somehow, Draco had gotten far, far too involved in Potter’s private life. There was no other explanation for why he suddenly cared so much.
“Excuse me?”
“I can’t just
A peculiar sensation began in Draco’s chest, like his ribs were vibrating against each other. Was he visible in the picture? He had been right there, after all. Draco scanned the station’s columns for a flash of an elbow, evidence of shuffling feet, shifting shadows, fingers that curled around the stone and into frame — anything that betrayed him as an eavesdropper —  and was pleased to note that the picture had been taken at just the right angle to obscure him from view. When Draco’s parents weren’t looking, he slid the entire page up his shirt.
“What, all your talent?” Draco shouted. Several of the students around them snickered, and Potter very obviously tried not to join them.
The man seemed shocked that she had addressed him. He struggled for a moment, clearly deciding whether or not he was going to respond, before saying, “In a manner of speaking.” He then turned to Potter and spat, “Hurry up, boy. We haven’t got all day.”
“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.”
screech
On the fourth day, Draco and Dobby found the Dursleys’ house much worse for wear. It looked as though it had gotten into a fight and earned a black eye for it: Potter’s bedroom window, and really, most of the siding surrounding it, had been completely torn away, leaving a great hole on the second floor.
Something twinged horribly in Draco’s chest. “You…what?”
“Fine,” Draco said, throwing his hands up. “It’s all
“Lucius,” Mr Weasley said.
Harry screamed.
Regardless, Draco slowed the motion of the comb through the other boy’s hair. He could allow himself that much. “If you say so, Potter,” he said quietly.
“No one can know, understand? Can you imagine if Father found out? Lord knows what he’d say.”
will ensure no harm comes to anyone with pure blood.”
Only this time, Draco was more disturbed by it. This time, he had made the conscious — or at least, semi-conscious — choice to kiss Potter. Before, he had been able to excuse his actions as part of his dreams — they weren’t real and didn’t signify anything — but it was a lot harder to fall back on that explanation now.
Then there was the way Potter smiled in the photo, clearly drawing on shared knowledge between him and Granger and Weasley, information Draco did not have. A smile that wouldn’t have existed had Draco gotten his last jibes in before the summer.
The matron stepped aside, and Ron and Hermione rushed over to Harry’s bed.
pain. I dread the interactions I’m going to have with your fans, and worse, your friends.”
Draco puffed his cheeks angrily. There had to be something in here somewhere, some instructions or a scribbled incantation…but no amount of hoping could make the diary do what he wanted.
Draco whirled around to see Potter some ways back, pushing his way through the mob of students. After motioning to Weasley to continue on without him, Draco yelled back, “What is it
“Disgusting. If I didn’t know better, I’d have thought rubbish came out of your mouth just then,” said Pansy sarcastically. She took her trunk from him. “Since when does Draco Malfoy get sentimental?”
Draco mumbled something incoherently as he stared at the windows of the building. He hadn’t quite heard his father— he was busy looking for Potter, hoping that he hadn’t bought his books already.
“It was of a different quality than the others, did you notice? Fantasies make a point to set themselves apart; in your case, they appear brighter. Almost…shiny, and especially where Potter is standing. You’ve put him in an almost saintly light—”
My schedule is very strange atm, so I'm not sure yet what day of the week I'll be able to publish new chapters. I will say that these nine chapters are completely finished, I just want to make sure I'm at least 95% happy with them when it's their time to go out into the world. Posting on a week-by-week basis gives Inspiration that much more time to gift me with rewrites for stuff I think could be improved. Because I'm a perfectionist who goes back and edits the hell out of everything I write, even after posting. Thankfully, y'all don't get updated every time I go back in ;)
“You do realise, Draco, that this is not news to me? I am your teacher, and in many ways another caregiver for you. Do you truly believe that I haven’t seen the way you look at Potter? That I haven’t understood, very clearly, the content of what I've seen?”
Madam Pomfrey, to her credit, saw through the lies and relocated Draco and Potter to a different, more private room at the back of the hospital wing. Draco was sure it hadn’t existed before then, but he wasn’t about to complain. The only attention he wanted was from Potter, and a space meant for the two of them was the perfect opportunity to get that.
“Salazar,” Draco muttered to himself, wiping a hand across his forehead. He couldn’t afford to have another dream like that. It made him think things, things he desperately hoped were wrong.
Draco dropped his notebook back into his bag. “With all due respect, sir, what is it we’ll be doing, then?”
“Oh no, I’m not telling.” Pansy put a finger to her lips. “That’s privileged information.”
A beat. “That’s forward,” Harry said.
Draco shook out his shoulders and sat up straighter in his chair. “Yes, sir.”
“Now, I want you to promise to visit me,” Pansy was saying as she smoothed the wrinkles of her skirt, “I don’t want us to grow apart because you grew tired of seeing me every day at school.”
So they did. But several meetings passed without much headway. Professor Snape was determined it was his fault— that his teaching methods were the reason Draco hadn’t been successful yet.
bad. However much he wanted to believe in the virtue of his father’s plan, Draco knew it was wrong. If Draco said nothing, did nothing, he would be bad too.
“Thank you, sir,” Draco said. He wiped under his eyes.
instead. Put them on my desk, Mother and Father mustn’t see.
in Potter the reason you haven’t been able to get him expelled? Were you actually trying, or were you putting on a show?”
“I’d like to see them Mudbloods gone for good,” said Crabbe, and Goyle nodded eagerly. “Shouldn’t never have allowed them in in the first place, y’ask me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Opening his dinner jacket, Mr Malfoy withdrew a black book from the inner pocket. He waved it as he spoke. “
Then his ribs decided to unfurl. He let out a ragged scream as he felt them scrape menacingly against the inside of his skin.

Hermione and Ron blushed at that.
anything,” Draco said, “they’re just showing up—”
Pansy crossed her legs. “To a degree, yes, I believe that. But there’s something else you’re not telling me, which is fine — we’re allowed to keep things from each other — but you’re hiding it from yourself too, which really isn’t healthy.”
What was that supposed to mean? Had they guessed Draco was behind the stolen letters? Had Dobby said something he shouldn’t have?
“Draco—”
Draco blinked. “I’d
“All right,” said Malfoy, facing the curtains.
have that stupid school putting foolish ideas into your head. There are no ‘good’ Mudbloods. Those who believe otherwise are no better than them.
“Okay,” Draco heard himself say, somewhat distantly. He was disappointed, yes, but not surprised. Potter hadn’t exactly been enthusiastic at the news. “I wasn’t really expecting… Of course. We should both take some time and um, think it over…”
“As good as,” Draco said.
“So did you,” Draco pointed out. He pulled Potter to him by the hips. “What was that you said about not minding kissing Draco Malfoy? Did I hear that right?”
“Look, Mum! I can see—”
“Those,” said Pansy, “are more or less direct quotes.”
Potter must have finally stepped off the train. Draco twisted to get a glimpse of him, but there was too much steam and the guard was waving him through the gateway, so he was forced to walk forward. In the train station, he leapt behind a nearby column and started planning what he was going to say to Potter. Something snide, with a bit of bite. Something that would make Potter think about him all through the summer.
distressed. Sometimes he dreaded coming down to Professor Snape’s office, which then made him feel insurmountably guilty, because Professor Snape was only trying to help him. He was doing his best to make sure Draco was comfortable, too, even as they expanded that definition of comfort…
Draco was almost proud. “That’s more like it.”
He wanted to enjoy his time with Pansy, truly, but could not stop circling back to the interaction he had witnessed in the train station. It was bizarre enough, even, to distract him from his recent dreams, though it was a near thing. No matter which way Draco tried to explain it, he couldn’t understand the Dursleys’ behaviour. The way they had spoken to Potter… It wasn’t with the admiration Draco had been expecting, that was for sure. Surely the great Harry Potter had grown up as famous as he was in the Wizarding world? How else could he have turned out the way he had, expecting praise and affection from everyone who laid eyes on him?
Out on the platform, the queue of students waiting to enter the train station was so thick that, no matter how small Draco tried to make his body, every few seconds someone would
“Oo, clever,” Potter said sarcastically. He stepped so close to Draco that he was forced backward. “Finally grown some brains, have you? Only took you six years.”
*******
What did Weasley mean, “Are they feeding you?” What sort of question was that? Did the Dursleys really not feed Potter, on top of everything else? Dobby hadn’t mentioned— Of course, now Draco had to ask—
“Stop,” Harry said, cutting him off. “I know what you’re doing, and just…stop it. I’m already uncomfortable enough as it is, I don’t need you trying to make me feel worse.”
Mrs Malfoy started up one of the staircases. “And you’re sure he didn’t leave Flourish and Blotts, or give the diary to someone there?”
“I said I would buy you a racing broom,” Mr Malfoy corrected, drumming his fingers on the counter impatiently.
Defeated, Draco threw himself onto his bed. He wondered how Dobby was faring. He had been gone for ages…
“I’ll come visit you tomorrow,” Weasley called. The doors shut loudly behind him.
Gillyflowers mean "bonds of affection" and catchflies mean "youthful love, I fall victim" ;D
All the same, he was having a hard time figuring out which monster would be released on his classmates next September. He read countless anthologies and made a list of the most dangerous magical creatures, but without more information — more evidence — the monster could be anything on his list, or even none at all. It was possible that whatever lurked in the Chamber of Secrets was something no one had studied before. The monster was likely very old, as well — it was placed in the Chamber in the tenth century —  but then what had it been eating? Or did it not have to eat? Did it hibernate until it was called? Could it, perhaps, reproduce on its own, or did it live with other monsters, creating offspring through some means? Was it possible there were thousands of monsters in the Chamber?
Blaise shrugged. “I want to watch the transformation.”
“Clearly,” said Mr Malfoy, looking askance at a couple who could only be Granger’s Muggle parents: the man had Granger’s long front teeth, and the woman had Granger’s bushy hair and dark skin. “The company you keep, Weasley…and I thought your family could sink no lower—”
? Sounds like you want to bunk off together.”
*******
Mrs Malfoy nodded, then followed Draco’s gaze. “I trust you have made your goodbyes?”
? And why wasn’t I told that she knew?”
“No,” Draco growled. “And don’t go anywhere near that light.”
“I never said that,” Draco said quickly. “Is everyone out of your changing rooms?”
“No. I’m sorry, sir, but no exceptions will be made. You’ll have to wait until 12:30 like the rest of these people.”
Potter sighed and stood, brushing himself off violently. “Fine.” He strode to his bed and jerked his sheets aside, crawled beneath them, then faced the opposite direction. “If you want to be childish about this, fine.”
“And I would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of Harry Potter,” continued Mr Malfoy, “not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear— ah, Mr Borgin.”
Draco crossed his ankles under the chair and took a deep breath. “Okay. Okay, I’ll find something else…”
“I hate you,” said Draco.
What was worse, he couldn’t stop staring at Potter, which he knew might draw unnecessary attention to them both. So he tried all manner of things to keep himself otherwise occupied — mapping the grain of the wooden table, drinking a ridiculous amount of water, forming a face in his scrambled eggs with his fork, talking with Granger about Transfiguration — but still, he found his eyes veering toward Potter, who, by some miracle, never seemed to be looking back at him.
But it was more complicated than that. It had always been more complicated than that. Even before reading those letters, Draco had felt…connected to Potter, somehow. He couldn’t explain why, but the connection had been there, regardless. His hatred for Potter had never been as straightforward as he liked to say.
“Have you touched since?” said Madam Pomfrey.
“Very gentlemanly of you,” said Blaise, which set him and Pansy off cackling.
“Don’t send him away,” said Mrs Malfoy, “he has every right to be here!”
“Master Draco,” said Dobby. Draco glanced up to see him gesturing at the door, which hung crookedly on its hinges. Draco stepped closer. Someone had carved a square hole into the wood, and installed a cat flap over it. The Dursleys didn't have a cat. They didn't like animals. There was also a lock affixed to the wrong side of the door, and by the handle, the wood had warped in several places, like it had been shouldered open. It was impossible to tell if those were the marks of the Dursleys trying to keep Potter from escaping, or someone breaking Potter out. Either way, Potter had been trapped in here, and now he was gone.
*******
Draco went down the entire length of the Hogwarts Express, receiving some scornful looks as he peered into every single compartment. He didn’t care about the others, really. It wasn’t as if they ever looked at him any differently, and anyway, they didn’t matter. There was only one face Draco wanted to see, and he had a horrible feeling he wasn’t about to find it.
“You don’t think Father would—” Draco broke off. All his anger left him. He sat on his bed.
“Enough. And the feelings of shame, of regret, were more powerful than the images themselves. I do not need to see the full memories to understand how painful they are for you.”
Harry continued to saunter toward him. “You need a good example of what to do— I could help you, you know. If you were interested.”
Draco repositioned himself in his chair and straightened his back. He closed his eyes. “Okay.”
Professor Snape nodded. “Things that I have thus far tried to avoid— in this case…things centred around Potter.”
“Like this?” said Harry, trying his best to mimic her.
your memories with a great deal of anxiety. Extend that natural boundary beyond that which you do not want others to see.”
There was that word again. “Love.” In the letters Draco sent to his friends, he always ended with his name. Just his name. Anything more, anything that signified affection, felt wrong. And Draco didn’t blame himself for that. How could he? Allies were hard to come by when you were associated with the Dark Lord, and it was even more perilous to turn your back on those allies, so he put up with Pansy’s teasing, Crabbe and Goyle’s stupidity, and Blaise’s tendency to be several steps beyond offensive.
“Okay,” said Potter. He shut the book. “Thank you for being honest with me. It makes for a nice change.”
After deciding that her attempts to describe Malfoy’s walk were “useless without a good mirror,” Pansy had led Harry through Malfoy’s empty dormitory and into the bathroom attached to it. There, she coached him on the various characteristics of Malfoy’s gait.
It didn’t work.
“Doesn't mean I can't try it again.” Draco took a bite and tried to look like he didn’t enjoy the lemony flavour or the tenderness of the meat. The house elves had done an excellent job, as always. “Not bad, I guess,” he mustered.
“Didn’t your father tell you more?” Pansy said.
Professor Snape considered him, making Draco feel even more self-conscious. “Was that wandless magic?” he asked Draco. “In the forest?”
Harry rejecting Draco is from Sorcerer’s Stone on pp. 108-9 in my book, or more generally, chapter 6, “The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.” And I stole quotes from pp. 102-3 in Goblet of Fire for the veela bit (chapter 8, “The Quidditch World Cup”). You know, we never see Draco lose control of himself there in canon, even though he’s in the box, so…it def could’ve happened this way :3
Big thanks to grovyrosegirl for reading this over!
Woke before he could kiss Potter.
“All right, all right, that’s enough,” said Draco, clutching his stomach, which was now sore.

He turned to his mother, who had watched with growing concern as he riffled through the book. “There’s got to be a spell of some sort, right?” he said earnestly. “To make words appear?”
without making the front page.”
“Then I failed,” Draco said, scowling.
“There will be no accidents.”
don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home,” Potter continued in a low voice, gesturing at the Muggles behind him, “I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer.”
“You’re welcome, Mother,” said Draco. She gestured for him to sit in her desk chair, which he pulled beside the bed. He poured tea into the teacups, adding liberal amounts of honey to both and stirring so it would dissolve. Feverfew, though excellent for curing migraines, was very bitter.
“You must not harm those Muggles,” said Dobby seriously.
“Don't encourage him, Neville,” said Granger.
“Good job it’s a weekend, then,” Harry said brightly. “And besides, depending on when Madam Pomfrey lets us go and when we get sorted, you might not ever have to put on Gryffindor robes. I can see it pains you to have even touched them at all.”
Something was off. Pansy seemed almost…distracted. Nervous. Draco leaned forward. “Do you, or do you not, know who’s cursed us?”
The conversation Draco overhears in the train station is from pp. 308-9 in Sorcerer's Stone, from chapter seventeen, "The Man with Two Faces"
He needed to get rid of this one. It was ginormous, and its roots had thoroughly destroyed the floor— about half the wooden panels had been completely jackknifed, creating a wide, jagged circle around the tree. There was no way he would be able to dispose of it neatly with his hands, and he wasn’t yet skilled enough with magic to simply vanish it.
scowling at you again,” said Weasley at the Gryffindor table. He looked thrilled that Potter was doing such a good impression.
“Hi,” Draco said simply, hoping to convey the jumble of emotions he felt through that single word. It came out as a half-whisper.
“I do,” said Draco. He could barely keep himself from dancing in his chair.
“You did,” Potter said, and tugged him down for a kiss that was far, far better than their first one, and not only because they were in the proper bodies this time. Potter’s lips were soft and warm and open slightly; his hands were insistent on messing up Draco’s hair, and the one thought Draco kept coming back to, besides
Dobby merely stared down at the floor. He brought a stack of parchment out of his pillowcase.
“What are you thinking about?” he said warily.
Draco cursed his pale complexion as he started to blush for the second time that morning. He had gone too far.
Mr Malfoy wrinkled his nose. “In that case, perhaps we can return to my list. I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today…”
“But I don't like it,” Harry complained just as quietly.
“You had better lie down, Malfoy. Here,” Madam Pomfrey gestured to the next bed, and Draco sat on it. She started examining him with her wand. “This doesn’t appear to be Polyjuice; it’s too slow-acting. It seems the process is staggered, as well. One eye and then the next, rather than at the same time. Very peculiar. Have you drunk anything in the past several hours?”
“Of course you don’t. That’s why it’s more important than ever for us to find that diary. And we will,” Mrs Malfoy added, putting a soothing hand on Draco’s. “There are only so many places it can be. We’ll find it, don’t worry.”
“See you later,” Potter whispered.
Pansy leaned against the doorframe and crossed her arms. “Just girly things, you wouldn’t understand.”
*******
“—you here to discuss a new Act in the works at the Ministry,” came his father’s voice. “If it passes, that means they will be making house calls. Be certain that will include anyone with ties to the Dark Lord. They will scour our homes for anything that, should they at some point fall into non-magical hands, would cause harm.”
“—unbelievable. Completely outrageous,” Draco told Pansy the next time he visited her. He was angry even now. How could the Dursleys possibly be allowed to carry on like that?
This, too, upset Draco. He pulled on his sheets so that Potter’s elbows skidded out from underneath himself. “I guess we’ll have to wait until tomorrow, then,” he said nastily.
Not exactly for the first time, Draco found himself wishing he could have been in the photograph— not hiding behind a column, but standing in place of Granger and Weasley. In the loop, they looked at Potter like he was bordering on mad, then exchanged worried glances with each other. Draco folded the photo so they were hidden round back.
Hey everyone! This chapter got kinda long, so I've decided to split it into two. Look out for the wrap up about a week from now :)
“THEY DESERVE IT!” Draco roared, trying to pry Dobby’s hands off him.
“Draw your attention back to the full tree. Imagine that tree aging backward through time: height shrinking, bark smoothing, limbs drawing back into the trunk. Hold the seed in your palm as the roots contract and grow thinner and whiter until they are nearly translucent. Imagine the tree now as a sapling, which bows its head as it joins the root in the seed. Then close the seed and seal it; bury it in the dirt.”
“Rather, you must protect
The water seemed to help for a moment, but then the pain was back, and this time it felt as if the optic nerve had been severed and was thrashing around helplessly, looking for a connection that was no longer there. Draco knew no amount of water could fix a problem like that. He knew of no spells to fix it, either, and if he
Draco was able to move again, but he remained on the floor. He could not meet Pansy’s searching gaze.
life would be at risk; every second he was in Hogwarts would be dangerous.
It was still bizarre, seeing someone else manipulate Draco’s body. Like watching a photograph of himself, but without the repeated loop of actions. But Potter was far less predictable than a photograph. He proved it by reaching up to touch the bangs Draco had just finished arranging to one side.
“You must dig deeper, Draco,” said Professor Snape. “Find something stronger.”
, so I don’t get found out.
“Where do we even start?” Draco whispered, sweeping the study with light from his wand. “The diary could be anywhere.”
“Draco, would you care to tell me what happened in there?” Professor Snape said, lowering his wand.
“Good.” Professor Snape pointed his wand lazily at Draco. “Close your eyes and picture the same tree…”
The door of the cabinet opened slightly, as if nudged accidentally from someone inside. There was only one conclusion: someone, or something, was hiding in there. But that didn’t mean it had to be Potter. Draco stepped closer, moving as fast as he dared, pretending to examine various objects as he did so. He smirked as he discreetly reached for his wand; he knew some unpleasant spells, spells for dirty eavesdroppers…
And because I stole some direct dialogue in the Forbidden Forest from the books, see pp. 248-259 in Sorcerer’s Stone. Or, if your book is different from mine, the end of chapter 15, “The Forbidden Forest.”
“With hope, we’ll have you fixed soon enough.”
“What picture?” Goyle asked.
flattering. Annoyed, Draco took a great breath, held it for a moment, then started shoving.
It took everything Draco had in him not to storm downstairs and attack the Dursleys for everything they had done. A lifetime of atrocities and still they found a way to be even worse to Potter. Shaking with barely-concealed rage, Draco moved to examine the window, but as he did so, he felt something crush beneath his foot. He froze, frightened for a moment that it might be flowers, but it was only a crumpled piece of parchment— the letter Potter must have gotten the night of his birthday. Potter hadn’t been expelled, after all. Which meant that everything Draco had done was even more useless than he’d thought.
“I need to talk to you,” Potter said quietly.
“Is it true? Do the Dursleys really not feed Potter?”
“No, not really,” said Potter, taking the cloak and stashing it in his old bag. “I thought you might have taken it as a hint that I was ready to, erm… Change back.”
“Doesn’t matter, I want to see it,” she said, pulling her wand from nowhere and pointing it at him. “
Draco ignored them and drew the invisibility cloak over the rest of himself, hiding his body entirely from view. He could still see his knees and legs and arms under the fabric, which was a relief, as he wasn’t sure how he’d be able to navigate quietly if he didn’t know where his body ended. Potter was right though, his shoes and ankles were visible where they peeked out from under the cloak.
After one last look at the cabinet, Draco reluctantly followed his father out of Borgin and Burkes. The pair travelled up the dusty path, passing shops selling dark books, unstable and unorthodox potions ingredients, poisonous candles, and one that looked full of illegal creatures. The couple from earlier were nowhere to be seen, and Draco didn’t know how to feel about that.
*******
Draco reached into his cloak and handed his father the piece of parchment. “Most of them are by Lockhart, and you heard the shopkeeper, we have to wait until 12:30.”
Draco and his friends howled with laughter as the owners scrambled to control their luggage, failing quite spectacularly to do so. One of the boys somehow ended up on top of his for a brief moment before getting bucked off; another tried to pull his back by the handle, which snapped cleanly, launching him back into his seat; yet another, who had been trying to push a book back into his open bag, was slammed bodily against the door.
Unfortunately, the secret was kept for all of one day. Or rather, part of it was. Once the other students noticed Draco and Potter were absent from classes that Monday, the natural assumption was that they had tried to finish each other off for good, and had ended up in the hospital wing. People started pouring in, complaining about fake injuries or illnesses to try and catch a glimpse of the two— though it was clear they mostly came to get a look at Potter.
know. Blaise and his stupid ideas. The memory of their last conversation swelled around Draco:
And admittedly, Draco hadn’t thought that far ahead. “The bathroom,” Draco said, naming the first place he could think of.
?” Potter’s were very large.
Professor Snape put his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “Yes.
“Oh, not very long.” His mother took a sip of tea. “What have you discovered in your research?”
“Not in this case. I believe they expect us to cooperate with them, to
Draco wasn’t quite sure how to interpret that. Despite his words, it looked as if Potter was enjoying this, but it was impossible to tell for sure. And Draco wasn’t about to ask, for fear of being accused of the same thing. He didn’t think he’d be able to lie convincingly.
“I don’t know,” Draco said again.
“Yeah,” Ginny said slowly, sounding more like she was talking to a child than to someone with more authority.
But at least
“What will happen to the half-bloods, though?” said Pansy.
“Draco,” said Professor Snape, bending so that he could look directly at Draco, rather than down at him, as he had been. His black eyes were intense. “I understand your discomfort. I know, intimately, the secrecy you wish to preserve…I know, too, that that secrecy has largely revolved around Potter. Targeting that might give you enough cause to throw me from your mind.”
“How much,” Draco said, more loudly than before, “did you see?”
Everyone but Potter gasped.
! I need to be there! I need to see him!”
Mr Malfoy sniffed loftily. “I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam.”
This was the wrong thing to say. At those words, Mrs Malfoy seemed to swell in anger; she stood at her full height, chest full of air. Her mouth tightened and her dark lipstick nearly disappeared. “If you think Draco’s
“You will not be seen — or heard — by him or his family. That goes for neighbours as well. And you mustn’t damage the owls, either; Potter can’t be suspicious that he’s missing his post. He has to believe his friends have forgotten about him.”
As Draco walked the dark corridors, he felt a dull weight settle onto his limbs and chest and eyelids, growing heavier the longer he kept moving. His meetings with Professor Snape always drained him a great deal, not only because he was practicing throwing someone from his mind— something he didn’t yet fully understand how to do. No, he was also worried about what, exactly, Professor Snape could see, had seen, or might see, as he dug around in Draco’s mind. Because, as Professor Snape had astutely pointed out, there were many incriminating things to uncover.
“I happen to be very proud of my job,” said Mr Weasley, raising his chin. His hands curled into fists at his side and his knuckles went white.
“Fine,” Malfoy spat, facing the curtains that still surrounded their beds.
Draco was silent for several moments as he did so, and then said, “Okay.”
Draco shook his head and lurched backward as if struck. “What are you doing with those?” he asked, almost accusing. “Did he not want them?”
Draco looked up at the golden constellations painted on his dark ceiling. His father had commissioned them when Draco failed a primary school Astronomy test, to teach him the stars and planets he had missed. It had worked; Draco could now identify everything his father deemed most important to learn. And, like the Great Hall of Hogwarts, the painted stars on Draco’s ceiling were spelled to shift as real stars did, almost imperceptibly. Sometimes, when he couldn’t sleep, he would lie on his back and watch them twinkle. They were a pleasant reminder that the universe far exceeded his small bedroom, that his troubles were equally small.
“About an hour or so,” Draco said. He reached for the syrup.
“On the contrary.” Professor Snape sat on his desk, knees about a foot from Draco’s. His usually-severe face softened a tick. “Occlumency is not only about preventing others from entering your mind, it is more often about protecting things you do not wish them to see. I did not pry very deeply into your memories, yet nothing incriminating pushed itself to the surface. I would call that successful, and besides, are we not here to practice?”
son.”
After staring into the drawer for what felt like ten whole minutes, Pansy slowly reached in and picked up the photograph. She held it gently in both hands, not saying anything and not turning around. Then she noticed the crease in the picture. She carefully unfolded the right half and, when she uncovered Granger and Weasley, made a small noise in the back of her throat.
“Trying to cheat off her, are you?” said Ron.
There were some excited grumblings at that.
“After you’ve just gotten a shower?” said Potter, raising a light eyebrow.
Marigolds signify grief, despair, and/or jealousy.
Draco scowled, wrapped himself tightly in his dressing gown, and left the dungeons.
“Whozat?” Potter slurred.
were worried about him. Make him think you’ve been working alone.”
Draco rubbed a hand over his cheek. “I don’t know. Like I’ve said, Father and I were separated for a while—”
The Malfoys were one of the first families to arrive at King’s Cross. Mrs Malfoy pulled Draco in for a tight hug and kissed the top of his head.
Draco pushed Blaise aside to stand directly in front of Potter. “Ignore Blaise, he thinks he’s being clever.”
Draco folded his arms. “Great, now we’re using euphemisms. Look, Potter, I meant what I said earlier. I don’t want to pressure you, and I certainly didn’t want to assume your harassing me had anything to do with righting things.”
The alley materialised before Draco, dust swirling as he and his father landed on the dry dirt. Mr Malfoy strode down the alley, scattering the few people who had been in his way. He didn’t so much as glance backward, an assumption that Draco would follow without a second thought. Instead, Draco lingered on a pair of twenty-something men as they ducked into a darkened side alley, giggling. They folded themselves against the old brick, all arms and necks and lips, and as Draco watched them, something in his chest expanded—
, you sound nothing like me. You've got to say it like you really hate me.”
“Yeah, well right now
“Oh good,” he said, focussing once more on the parchment in front of him. He began scribbling on it. “Come to change back, Draco?”
the school? That wasn’t public knowledge. Yes, there had been many speculations about how Potter had found the Philosopher’s Stone, but there had never been mention of the Dark Lord’s presence in the school. Surely if he had been there, Draco’s father would have said something.
“YOU THINK I DON’T KNOW THAT?” Draco barked, leaning into her space.
“Do you have another suggestion?” Professor Snape said, his nostrils flaring. “Something you feel as strongly about keeping to yourself?”
“High-maintenance prat,” said Potter. He leaned back further into Draco’s touch, eyelids closing halfway.
“Oh, Pansy, I—”
“You know,” said Potter, tilting his head back so Draco could start combing, “being rude to me won’t make me want to listen to you.”
“I would like to try again, if you’re comfortable. I want to see if the same happens this time, applying the same pressure as before.”
Draco gathered the weave of his blanket and started working it between his fingers. “You’re talking like you think his anger is inevitable, Mother.”
“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” Granger added.
that?” Potter countered, still kneeling at Draco’s bedside. “Why did it all suddenly get faster? Was it brought on by contact, or proximity, or—”
“Yes,” said Draco, “I’m sure.”

“Try your arms,” said Madam Pomfrey, whose thin eyebrows had come together somewhat.
“What does it even mean? It sounds like you and Malfoy do them regularly?”
disagreeable; his scar was, in its own way, beautiful, thin pinkish lines arcing down his forehead like real lightning; his eyes were large, almond-shaped, and an unmistakable green; his round glasses, though somewhat big on his face, suited him; his top lip was slightly bigger than the bottom, and both curved naturally upward at the corners, like they were made for smiling.
“You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids. I have a few — ah — items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call…” said Mr Malfoy, unfurling a piece of parchment with a list of those items for Mr Borgin to see.
“Who says I am?” Malfoy reached up and tousled his own hair, making it even larger and fluffier than normal. He then crossed his arms and looked defiantly up at Harry, who was now standing two feet away.
“Tsk tsk. What
“Well, you keep talking about him, is it really any wonder that my mind continues to go where it does?” Draco said.
“Him to be ready…” said Draco. In the opposite corner of the greenhouse, Potter, Pansy, and Blaise were laughing at Crabbe, who’d somehow lost his shears to their Venomous Tentacula, which brandished them aggressively at the boy.
And anyway, who was she to put words in Potter’s mouth? For all she knew, Potter missed their conversations. They had to be more enlightening than any with her or Weasley. At the very least, Draco was honest.
Pansy went straight to the summer garden and plopped down underneath Draco’s favourite oak tree. She launched into a discussion of the recent dragon scandal in Brazil (“I mean,
Pansy heaved a large sigh and came back inside. “You’re no fun,” she said, giving him a massive grin. “Where to?”
“I thought we were,” said Draco, lifting his chin.
Figuring he should try to help, Draco started with the bookcase. It seemed as likely a hiding place as any; his father might have thought the other books would stash the diary in plain sight. Beginning from the left, Draco pulled out one volume at a time, glancing through each and shining his wand at the back of the bookcase, occasionally testing the backboard with his knuckles before shoving the books back in their places. Shelf by wide shelf Draco looked, dragging his father’s desk chair over so he could reach the topmost level, all with no results. Perhaps it was too obvious a hiding spot— it had, after all, been the first place Draco thought to check.
have no say in how they behave — they can’t help it, it’s in their blood — but for a pureblooded wizard to act like that…what shame he brings upon the Wizarding world. On us, even.”
Madam Pomfrey ignored that. “Is there anything else you can tell me about the whole process? How long did the transformations last?”
Crossing back into his bedroom, Draco grabbed some tissues and set about cleaning himself up. He breathed deeply, stared at himself in the mirror, watched the space around his irises turn slowly from red to pink to white. When he was satisfied he looked relatively normal, he crossed to the balcony and shut the doors, making sure to adjust the sheer curtains to block as much of the flowers from view as he could. Then he called for Dobby.
There were several other similar attempts with similar results before Professor Snape insisted that Draco let him poke around in his mind, choose different memories than the ones Draco had been showing him. Draco didn’t think he could say no anymore, not if they were really going to make progress. At the rate they were going, Professor Snape would probably see entire years of Draco’s life before Draco managed to produce a good defense.
“Bluebells…” Professor Snape said thoughtfully. “Constancy. What were you thinking about during that time? I only got flashes— you were frightened…by what?”
,” said Draco. He and Pansy crossed to Blaise’s bed so they could talk more quietly. Thankfully, Crabbe, Goyle, and Nott were heavy sleepers, but Potter was an unknown. For all Draco knew, he’d scream and wake the rest of the Slytherins.
Draco nodded.
Each morning for the next three days, Dobby took Draco to Potter’s house. Each morning, without fail, Draco would stand on the Dursley’s neatly trimmed front lawn, hoping to catch a glimpse of Potter. But he was always disappointed. Potter never once came to the window. And it was difficult, being so close to Potter without Draco feeling like he could do anything to help. Draco hoped the Ministry would handle it the way he thought they would; surely they must know what was going on.
“I heard that.”
Draco paused, teacup halfway to his mouth.
“Good. I’d give you something for your pain, but I’m not sure how that will react with whatever’s going on with you. I’m afraid all we can do right now is wait this out.” Her face softened. “I…realise that’s not the most encouraging thing, but we
Draco nudged Potter’s neck back around. “One atrocity at a time,” he said, and was pleased to note that, even though his face felt warm, no colour was visible in the mirror. “Your normal bird’s nest might suit
when I think I have everything under control, Weasley ruins it for me! I suppose he’d think it funny, if he knew…”
“So,” she said softly. “What do you want to know about Draco? I assume he only gave you the most basic information about himself, but I’ve been there for the greatest hits— I can enlighten you.”
reasonable. Funny your mind should go there.”
slights away.”
Dobby snapped again. For a moment all was quiet, and then there was more thumping as students ran around the train, desperately trying to reclaim their diaries.
There were some shrill screams of delight as Gilderoy Lockhart emerged from a back room. He was dressed in periwinkle blue robes that were as incandescent as his smile, which he directed at everything that moved (including, amusingly, several photographs of himself, which smiled back). A short, balding photographer scurried about with a large camera, taking pictures wildly. The bright flashes had a strange strobing effect against the purplish smoke his camera gave off.
“Dobby supposes so, sir, but—”
Draco was silent for a long moment. He wasn’t sure he had anything that would satisfy both requirements, but he struggled to find
“I’d rather not say,” said Draco, watching her cut off another leaf to keep his gaze from wandering to Potter again.
“How—?” He gulped. “How much did you see?”

click.
“Over the summer,” Draco said, blinking rapidly.
In less than a second, Potter had whirled around and, kneeling, had begun attacking Draco’s hair. By the time Draco successfully detached himself from the other boy, the damage had been done.
Pansy looked out the window for a long moment.
“It’s…” She looked at the ceiling, seeming to steel herself. “I had a thought while you and your father were out… What if the book we found doesn’t need words to do its job? What if simply having it on your person is enough to open the Chamber of Secrets?”
Draco didn’t want to kiss Potter. He didn’t even
“Yeah,” Potter said softly. When next he spoke, he did so to Draco’s left arm. “I don’t think I can do this now.”
“Merlin!” Goyle shouted gruffly.
“Oh, have they, now?” said Draco, reaching for the door handle.
Not that Draco had made a difference, anyway. Potter had still ended up at Weasley’s house.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s possible,” Mrs Malfoy conceded, but she didn’t look convinced either. “We’ll have to keep checking.”
After passing over roughly ninety-five percent of his clothes, Draco ended up choosing one of his favourite sets of robes: light grey, well-fitting, and long enough that they swished dramatically when he walked. Minutes later, he descended the grand staircase, hand moving carelessly along the railing and robes sweeping behind him. He was several steps from the ground floor when his father turned at the noise.
“I was also,” his father added, “planning to go to Quality Quidditch Supplies. You’ll remember that second years are allowed to try out for their House’s Quidditch team…”
“Not really. I just happen to be very gifted at logic.” Granger gave him a small smile. She turned back to the plant between them and flawlessly cut off one of the leaves. Scooping it into their container, she said, “Now that you know what to do, what are you waiting for?”

“The Dursleys, sir!”
She nodded to the other occupants. “Crabbe, Goyle.” They grunted in reply, and she breezed out into the corridor.

He had never waited so long for anything in his life.
“I'm minding my business!” said Longbottom.
“That sounds about right,” Granger said.
“Of- of course not,” said Draco. Then, more softly, he added, “I didn’t mean anything by it, it was just a question.”
“I don’t!” Draco said fiercely.
“I will not sit here and listen to threats, Malfoy—” began a fourth person.
“Is that wise? Your temper—”
Ron furrowed his eyebrows. “What, ‘literally?’ I can’t use it even though it’s correct there? What should I have said, then?”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “
Dobby nodded and opened his mouth to talk, but Draco made a silencing gesture. “Do not, under any circumstances, tell him anything. If he sees you, make him believe that you were just a figment of his imagination. And if you’re called by my parents while you’re away, only come back
“Come on, Pansy,” Harry said, “tell me. It’ll help with my impression of Malfoy, won’t it?”
She sat and touched one of the white blooms. “How long have you been…growing flowers?”
Draco looked hesitantly at Crabbe. He hadn’t shown any enthusiasm at keeping the Chamber closed…but then again, the only things the boy really expressed were puzzlement and a dull glint in his eyes that might have been satisfaction. It was possible he didn’t have the capacity to give Draco nonverbal confirmation.
“Better than last night,” said Harry. He could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him, but he continued to look at Madam Pomfrey.

“Right,” Draco said, pushing his hair off his forehead with a palm. “Well, with the way things are going, he wouldn’t have to push very hard… How- how do I stop making it worse for myself?”
“Point proven,” said Harry, eyeing Malfoy’s mussed hair with delight. Malfoy didn’t seem to understand that the action would never bother Harry the way it bothered him.
,” a compartment in the centre of the desktop lifted, then quickly expanded outward in triangular segments, like unravelling wooden origami, until it created a rather plain brown box. There was a hiss and its lid opened to reveal a dark book sitting inside.
The anger dropped from her face. “He’s not? But how will he get to Hogwarts?” She inclined her head. “Have you, you know…done something?”
“Hmph. Well,” Draco said, ankling up to him, “lucky for you, once was enough.” He grabbed the front of Potter’s robes with both hands. “Come here.”

“I’ve been meaning to tell you something,” said Mrs Malfoy, accepting the cup Draco offered her. “I’ve…noticed you are spending more and more time shut up in our library. The books and newspapers you’ve selected have a common theme: Salazar Slytherin and his Chamber of Secrets.”
“Amazing,” Draco said anyway.
“Actually, I quite thought I pulled it off,” said Malfoy, pulling the curtains aside so they could see the rest of the hospital wing. “Harry Potter doesn’t look half bad in silk. Granted, you would need to get the proper size—”
Draco’s smirk dropped. “There’s no need to bring
“Dobby was ordered to, sir,” Dobby said quickly, his gaze darting around the room before landing on Draco’s shoes. He fiddled with the pillowcase he wore. “And he was strictly forbidden to let anything slip before Master told you himself.”
“Oh,” said Harry. He wasn’t sure what else there was to say.
His hand hesitated briefly on the handle before he opened the door. In the night, the dark wooden floors reflected the light of the moon. The walls, covered in purple damask wallpaper, formed a circle around the piano, drawing the eye to where it sat dead centre. There was only one other piece of furniture in the room— a desk tucked right next to the door. Were Draco to open it, he was sure to find sheet music, inkwells, and Tuning Spell instructions, all the way he had left them.
Professor Snape returned the smile, though it was a more reserved version. It was perhaps the most pleased Draco had ever seen him. “I think you’re ready to move on to what is, possibly, the most important tool of Occlumency: protecting yourself against mental intruders. This also happens to be the most
Potter shook his head in amusement, then bent to grab his bag. “Let’s go.”
. On the parchment, Potter mouthed a couple words before smiling and gesturing to the Dursleys, who were out of frame.
“And of course,” said Madam Pomfrey, “without knowing how this came about, I can only predict how long this will last, how it can be fixed, or even
“What is that?” Draco asked, pointing to the basin.
“There’s one final technique we could try, if you’re willing,” said Professor Snape. “It’s something that very few wizards, even those skilled in other areas of the field, have ever done: create false memories. Often it is very obvious to the Legilimens that the person is, in fact, tricking them. But with your success in everything we’ve practiced, I think you could do it.”
And they did. But each time they snuck into Mr Malfoy’s office, the compartment was still empty. Eventually, even that disappeared, leaving only the flat top of the desk, so they turned their attention to the rest of the manor. As they searched, Draco and his mother went over the Diagon Alley trip in great detail.
Draco closed the door and when he turned, was surprised to find Potter smiling at him. “What is it?” Draco asked him.
“Really?” Harry asked. He had never heard of anything like that before.
“No offence, sir, no offence meant—”
“I do hate him.”

“Lovely to see that you’re still working on yours,” said Draco.
“I suppose you would be. You live in filth, no wonder you don’t mind working with it—”

Nothing happened for either attempt.

Draco sat there amongst the flowers for a long while, letting his anger and fear loose in a great torrent of tears and snot. Normally he never allowed himself to become so distraught, but his parents were several floors down, fighting. They would never have to learn of his weakness; he was alone on his balcony and in his grief.
“I command you to stop laughing— Well, it’s screeching, isn’t it? At this point?” He put the voice back on: “Stop
Professor Snape regarded him; his face seemed to darken as he did so. “Yes, Draco, I want you to lie.”
“I need to speak with you. Do you know who cursed me and Potter?”
, you know. And I figured it out on my own. Thanks, by the way,” she said to Granger and Weasley. “But that’s not the point. I came over to tell you: Quidditch tryouts start this weekend, traditionally, and as Harry’s the captain—”
“Anything this time?” Professor Snape asked.
“Yes, I do have eyes…Ron,” Draco replied.
But that was beside the point. Granger had been too vague about things Draco wanted to know more about, and too specific about the boring things. It was like she knew who was actually going to read the letter, and wrote something so dull to prevent him from reading future ones. But Draco was more persistent than that. He
“Then stop talking,” Draco said in Potter’s voice. He sounded less threatening that way. He didn’t care for it.
“You’re the one who owled. Doesn’t that mean
He started crying again. No matter how many people he fooled into believing otherwise, he could never convince himself, or his magic, that he truly hated Harry Potter. The proof towered over him, signalling its meaning like a flashing beacon. Worst of all, it was nothing new. Draco had tried so hard to pretend he didn’t like Potter — come up with all sorts of small, meaningless reasons to dismiss him — but what had that cost? A wasted year, a wasted summer. Tears. Distrust toward his father. More tears. Magic he couldn’t begin to understand.
“Yes,” said Mrs Malfoy, “the one we found could be the true diary.”
Professor Snape raised an eyebrow and added more pressure to the spell, pushing past Draco’s opposing mental force…
today 12:30 P.M. to 4:30 P.M.
Draco shut his eyes. He swatted at Potter, wordlessly trying to get the boy to go back to his own bed before the same thing happened to him, too. He knew that he wouldn’t want to feel his ribs rearrange themselves while he was left stranded on the cold stone floor.
“I was agreeing with you, not contradicting you. Don’t make this out to be bigger than it is.”
Draco’s eyes dropped. His head jerked up and down. His chest suddenly felt too small for his beating heart, and his lungs too small for the air he wanted to pull into them; he pushed back from Professor Snape, who was standing too close, and his breaths came shallower and quicker…
*******
Blaise was the only reason Draco was dreaming about, thinking about, kissing Harry Potter. Draco’s mind had clearly latched on to Blaise’s words and turned insinuations into pictures.
Mr Malfoy cleared his throat. “I have asked Dobby to prepare a three-course meal from the country to which we will be travelling on holiday. If said country is not already obvious, it will be by course number two. Eat,” he said, gesturing stiffly to their plates.
“Oh, come now,” she crooned, and patted his knee. “I was only teasing.”
“Yes, but—” Still, Draco did not look at Professor Snape; his breathing continued to quicken, and now his head was feeling light… “I tried so hard to- to hide it.”
“Narcissa—”
“No!” Draco cried, and his body moved of its own accord— or, at least, he thought it did.
What was more, Draco was increasingly convinced that his plan was far crueller than he thought— far crueller than he had ever intended to be. How could he take away Potter’s freedom, knowing what he did about the life Potter would escape by attending Hogwarts?
After he heard the loud
true, anyway, which made his hands feel heavier, his mind work slower. As Draco fought against his listless body, words pulsed over and over through his head like a heartbeat:
you’ve taken his post. Fail to do so, and the consequences will be far more severe than your simply being late to a summons. Understand?”
Harry sat next to her on the cool stone floor. “This wasn’t all that productive, was it?”
Draco tugged Dobby forward to get a better look, but even on his toes he couldn’t see into Potter’s room. “Take me up there,” he said.
When Weasley’s fourth letter came, right after the Malfoys returned from France, Draco left it unopened as well. He had made a decision: somehow, he was going to give every single letter back to Potter, and he would make sure Potter returned to Hogwarts for his second year. Draco owed him that much.
“You may be excused,” said Mrs Malfoy.
last year. This will be good for you.”
“Maybe both your hands or arms at the same time?”
“Oh, I will,” Potter said, and then he smiled; Draco could have sworn the train station grew brighter for it— one big flash of light that hit Draco like he’d been Stunned. Trust precious
It took several moments longer than usual for Dobby to arrive, and when he did, his eyes were closed and he swayed slightly.
The man blinked. “I see. Well. Do your best to avoid Potter during your break. Try not to think about him, too.”
She reclined and crossed her legs, turning serious. “Do you have a plan, then? To stop the Chamber from being opened?”
“Alone, Blaise,” said Draco when the other boy tried to come in as well.
“Break it up there, gents, break it up—” came a new voice. Plowing through the crowd came Hagrid, who pulled the two men apart as easily as if they were children.

Draco balled his fists and tried to look cross. “So help me, Pansy, I will hex you—”
“Keep looking,” his mother urged him, “I’m sure something will turn up. We can buy more books when we go to London for your school things, too. And if, for some reason, we can’t find the diary before you leave for Hogwarts, you should be prepared. I doubt your father could be convinced to send you somewhere else for your second year; the whole reason he’s trying to get rid of the Muggle-borns is so you don’t have to go to school with them.”
knew that, so why didn’t his father? Draco couldn’t believe the man was willing to risk his own son’s life just to make good on an eleven-year-old promise to the Dark Lord who, his mother had helpfully reminded, was gone. (Although, if Granger had been telling the truth in her letters, the Dark Lord was
Potter scoffed and stretched out his legs. “Why don't you practise on me?”
At the desk, Draco flipped through countless stacks of parchment, looked under a planner, and rifled through his father’s in-tray, again with no luck. The drawers, which did not seem to have false bottoms, contained only inkwells, quills, old calendars, and other useless junk.
No one
. Not only because he had never gotten used to seeing another person’s reflection, but because he had never figured out how Potter got that levity in his eyes, or how he held himself: somehow shy and proud at the same time.
“You’re sure you don’t remember him giving anything to Mr Borgin but a list?” Mrs Malfoy asked Draco for the third time, when they were combing through the library.
There was a great roar and Ginny’s cauldron hit the floor with a loud clang. Mr Weasley had charged Mr Malfoy, propelling them backward into a shelf; there were more screams as the men fought, Mr Malfoy using the book he had taken from Ginny Weasley first as a shield, then a weapon; other books flew and hit several of the surrounding people; the harried shopkeeper pleaded for the men to stop, to no avail: “Gentlemen, please— please!”
“I don’t… It’s not that it’s
“Sir? Sir!”
“Yes, but you surely wants to tell Mast—”
The elf’s eyes narrowed with uncertainty. “Yes, sir,” he said, and then, after a pause, “Would you like Dobby to clear these too?”
The next morning, Draco woke with his hand shut in a particularly heavy book and his head resting on a surprisingly soft one. He opened the one with his hand in, suspecting that that page might be important, and shook out his arm to get some of the feeling back. Last night, he had spent more time finding information than sorting through it, and now had a massive collection of books and newspapers in front of him, so large that it took several tables to support their weight. Thinking about going through them all was impossibly daunting, but it was much less so now that he had narrowed it down to those stacks.

The elf smiled meekly and gave Draco the stack of envelopes, saying, “Is there anything else Dobby can do?”
“All right,” said Potter, calming somewhat, though there was still a very annoying, I-know-something-you-don’t smirk on his lips. “So, what’s so important that you risked coming here?”
, that’s not something you do when you hate someone! You’re obsessed, there’s no way around it.”
Tentatively, Dobby glanced up at Draco to see his reaction.
His face grew hotter as he crossed into the dormitory, where he was met with the conflicting sight of Potter, shirtless, bending down to rummage through Draco’s trunk. Immediately, Draco faced the wall and tried not to think about what it meant that he’d found that attractive— no matter that it had been Potter in that body, he still looked like Draco Malfoy.
“They’ve stopped the train. It’s time to go.”

Because Potter
Harry shook his head, not really getting it. “What does that mean?”
“There’s a chance he’ll connect your visit to me anyway; I want you to pretend you’re there against orders, just in case.”
“Good. I expect you to start collecting his post tomorrow.” Draco squinted at him. “Dismissed.”

“Nothing abnormal. Draco, what were you up to yesterday?”
can’t do it,” Pansy said quietly, “I haven’t been coming in as often as I usually do, Potter isn’t used to that.”
“I love you too, Mother,” Draco said, squeezing her hands before heading for the train. He didn’t look at his father.
Mrs Malfoy smiled. “He’s gone to bed, he’s fast asleep.”
Blaise bent over Potter and prodded his shoulder in the same way one might a dead animal. Potter mumbled something incoherently into his pillow.
Heads of marigold sprang up in a low circle around Draco, pushing against his legs and ankles like they wanted to support him, but that only made him feel worse at his lack of control. Their amber blossoms blurred together as he gave in to frustrated tears.
“No.” She glanced backward into the common room. “Come in, everyone else is—” she yawned— “asleep. Where is this coming from? You seem really desperate all of a sudden.”
After a quick breakfast, Draco and his father set down their long gravel drive. Due to the protection charms in place around the manor, they waited until they had gone through the wrought-iron gates to Disapparate. Usually, they’d have taken their black and gold stagecoach into London, but their trip to Knockturn Alley demanded discretion.
“Not much, I guess,” Draco lied.
Mr Malfoy’s study was a large room on the ground floor. Its walls were an expansive indigo that, in the night, melded with the dark wooden flooring. Standing in the entryway, the room looked to be a great hole in the manor, with strange shapes jutting out to form Mr Malfoy’s desk, bookshelf, filing cabinets, and end tables.
His bedroom doors had barely closed before Draco flung open the ones leading to his balcony. He bent over the stone balustrade, his knuckles turning white from how tightly he gripped it. He didn’t know whether to cry or laugh or scream. Before today, he had thought the Chamber of Secrets a myth — its existence had been contested since the moment Salazar Slytherin claimed its creation — but to find out that it was indeed real, and that a girl had died the last time it opened? That was incontestable.
“I can’t listen to another minute of this buffoonery.” Draco held out his arm. “Let’s be off. Mother promised me Belgian waffles this morning, and you need to be back soon to cook them.”
Pansy was shaking with suppressed laughter. “Merlin, you’re ridiculous.”
Potter gave a breathy laugh. “I stand corrected.
So he said yes.
Harry leaned his head against the counter. “He…doesn’t really say those sorts of things about me, does he?”
“See you, Potter!”
“France,” he said. He glanced at his mother; she motioned for him to be more specific.
to have your full support!”
Draco’s mouth reverted back into a frown. “Is it something else? Harrith? Harrison?”
“If your excellency would rise, you have guests,” said Blaise.
Later, when he was safely back in his bedroom, Draco pulled out the newspaper and cut out the whole article. Then he separated Potter’s picture, fully intending to drop it in his bin, but
. Before Draco could figure out which, the train pulled out of King’s Cross and he lost sight of them altogether.
When Potter came back, Blaise and Pansy were at his elbows. They were staring at an object in his arms— a bundle of fabric that rippled like silk and shone like molten silver.
“You are to accompany me there, regardless,” said Mr Malfoy, his hands tightening on his cane. “Do not forget your cloak. Knockturn Alley is the last place to attract attention, better to wear something dark there.”
“Brilliant!” Draco said. Heart thumping wildly, he sat up, pushed the covers off of himself, and threw his legs carelessly over the side of the bed. “Where is he now?”
Draco whirled around. “What do you expect me to do? I can’t leave him in there!” He made another attempt to look inside the window. “Not when I know
“Your fantasy— Seeing how much time you devote to watching Potter, I’m surprised it wasn’t more accurate… Though perhaps you do more watching than you do listening?”
“But who’s going to protect you?” said Draco, covering her hand with his. “Aren’t you in danger too?”
Minor warning bc there’s a short, relatively vague (but still spicy) Drarry scene later on in this chapter. I didn’t think it was enough to change the rating to teen though.
Harry and Malfoy exchanged glances.
“Oh, same,” said Pansy, briefly grasping Potter’s forearm. “Wait for me; we’ll go together.”
“You’re not the only one who wanted it to work,” said Harry, frowning down at his body.
Draco was silent for a moment as he processed that. Then he felt a tap on his shoulder. He flinched as he turned to see Weasley’s sister standing there.
“Tut tut. I never said anything about betraying him, darling, only that Draco’s a little… Let’s say…blind sometimes, especially when it comes to his personality. I can be a bit more objective. If, of course, you’re at all interested in portraying him accurately. We can’t have another veal incident; Nott was definitely suspicious.”
“Lucius...” Mrs Malfoy looked to her husband. “Tell Draco about the new items you procured for me.”
“No?”
“Now,” Madam Pomfrey said, turning around. She huffed. “Let’s see if I can’t stop this.” And she began examining the pair of them, every so often trying spells to stop the changes. It was only after their noses and chins had switched that she decided to call it a night.
*******
Mr Malfoy, looking thunderous, wrested himself from Hagrid’s grip. “Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your father can give you,” he said, depositing it in Ginny’s cauldron. He motioned jerkily for Draco to follow him from the shop.
Anyway. Thank you to everyone who's read this so far and left kudos!
“A wise choice.” Professor Snape lifted his wand. When he spoke again, he used his familiar monotone voice, the one he put on to help Draco focus. “Close your eyes and imagine your tree, stretching upward and outward in a beautiful mass of branches and limbs. Place your hand on its wide trunk; feel the roughness of the bark, the small ridges and lines that age the surface; find the gnarls and lumps under your fingertips. Press your weight further against the trunk and take note of its sturdiness, the way it pushes back against you.
Pansy’s eyes grew large, but not like she was shocked, more…proud that she had finally gotten Draco to say something she’d known all along. “Who said anything about you
Mrs Malfoy glanced at Draco before replying. “Last time the chamber was opened, a girl died. She
Over the next week, Draco took note of the parts of his day that he thought would be most uninteresting to an observer, and things that didn’t normally include Potter— the route from the dungeons to Arithmancy, trying to fall asleep with Goyle foghorning it up in the next bed, opening packages of sweets from his mother, studying by the lake, listening to Blaise and Pansy prattle on about the latest gossip, sitting through History of Magic, looking over his notes from History of Magic… The list went on, though it was still a shockingly
But that was starting to sound a bit too much like obsession. Draco decided to stop thinking now, or he would sit there for hours trying to puzzle it out. Potter was Daedalus, constructing an inescapable labyrinth that continued to grow and twist beyond his knowledge, trapping Draco — the Minotaur, too beastly to work through the cycles of illogic — at the centre.
Potter obsessed with me?”
“Doing what?”
And suddenly it was over.
“Not everything is so dramatic, Pansy,” said Draco, a bit more harshly than he had intended. “Of course I still want him gone. I’ve just been…unsuccessful. Potter is annoyingly resilient. Like a weed in a garden.”
“Let’s get back to work,” said Granger from behind her Astronomy book.
“Oh, that's right…” Potter tried on a sneer for the next word, “Potter.”

“If you insist.” Blaise tugged his sheets up past his ears.
Other diaries were more successful— they zoomed down the corridor and smacked repeatedly into the glass of Draco’s compartment. Their owners blundered after them, embarrassedly trying to capture the slick books.
Two mornings later, a colour photograph in the
“I haven’t got one for you.”
“Aren’t I?” said her husband.
She pressed on: “Didn’t you think to ask?”
Mercifully, Potter finished dressing quickly enough. He cleared his throat and held an expectant hand out to the air, about waist height. Draco took it and allowed Potter to lead him out of the Slytherin common room, which had filled somewhat since Draco had entered it. They, Blaise, Pansy, and a couple other Slytherins headed toward the Great Hall together for breakfast.
“Do I have to worry about him?” said Harry, flipping a page in his book without having read anything inside.
Draco awoke breathless and confused. He surged forward and searched around himself, wondering what had woken him up, but his bedroom looked the same as it had several hours prior: dark and empty. So why did he feel like there was something he was meant to do?
“What have I said about using that word, Ron?” Hermione scolded.
Pansy scrunched her face and said, “All right, you’re doing it again. You must pay attention when people are talking to you.” She waved a hand dismissively. “Or, at least, pay special attention when
“Do you have more information about it? What the monster is? How Father’s going to control it?”
Over at the Slytherin table, Pansy was torturing Harry. “Come on,” she said under her breath, “Draco loves veal. It'll be suspicious if you don't eat it.”
motivation for hiding them…” Professor Snape stopped in front of Draco. “Does that sound any better?”
“It means,” said Pansy, crossing her ankles, “
Shut up
“Obligation?” Pansy guessed. There was a soft scrape of china as she picked up her teacup. She held it round the widest part, ignoring the handle. “It must’ve come as quite a shock to you that Potter isn’t worshipped everywhere he goes.”
“It’s difficult, sir,” Draco replied. He pushed his blonde bangs to the side again, off his forehead.
It was only then that Draco finally let himself ask a very important question: what use could a blank diary be in opening the Chamber of Secrets?
“Fine.” Professor Snape rolled his shoulders and pointed his wand at Draco once more. “Let’s try again. Keep a lookout for anything that seems out of place…”
“I’ll say it again,” Mr Malfoy said darkly, “the Weasleys are of the lowest possible class of wizard— far lower, in some ways, than even Mudbloods.
“It looks like a photograph.” She opened it back up. “Who’s it of?”
“Okay in there, Draco?” That was Crabbe, had to be. Goyle had a much deeper voice. “Pansy’s not…doing things to you again, is she?”

“You’re going to have to miss it again, because you
Draco arched his head upward, then squinted in the brightness of his bedroom. “Who is?”
“I don’t know, Mother, twenty minutes? Half an hour?” Draco reached out for the next book on the shelf in front of him. “But he could have passed it on to anyone at any time.”
*******
“Make Pansy do it,” came the other boy’s reply.
His mother was right, setting a monster loose in Hogwarts would have catastrophic results. True, Draco might have liked to go to a Muggle-born-free school, but that was mainly because Granger was, impossibly, top of their class. His jealousy, he knew, was not a good enough reason to get rid of anyone, no matter the purity of their blood, and certainly murder was not the answer.
“No,” Draco said firmly. He stood. “I need to go tell him.”
, what was that Cachoral fellow thinking, bringing an Antipodean Opaleye into the country? They’re not even native!”) that somehow turned into a rant about Draco’s inattention on the train ride to King’s Cross.
“My…” Draco brought his foot back up. “I don’t understand.”
,” Mr Malfoy replied.
to save a fellow classmate from mortal peril, and that after learning the Philosopher’s Stone was in danger of falling into the wrong hands, Mr Potter himself went through all manner of obstacles to make sure the Stone was safe, in so doing revealing the evil intentions of former professor Quirinus Quirrell.
“Don’t,” said Draco, tiredness washing over him. He had regretted the words as soon as he’d spoken them. “I’ve changed my mind, I need— Potter needs to know. About the Chamber. About what’s coming. He needs to be given the choice. I don’t think Hogwarts would be safe for him either, but I can’t force him to stay home, I don’t have that kind of power…” Draco squared his shoulders. “Go to him, tell him what you’ve told me. Try and convince him to stay home, for what little good that might do.”
, when he had even more on his mind — he went to their library, a gigantic room that rivalled the one at Hogwarts.
“Have you never taken Polyjuice Potion before?” said Draco, feigning boredom to keep the anxiety at bay. “It’d be suspicious to turn into someone else in every way but their voice.”
“I’m not,” said Potter, despite the obvious. “Something Pansy— Never mind.”
“You are not the only one who uses the library, dear,” said his mother, “but I bring this up because I thought you should know: I plan to find the diary your father showed us. I want to destroy it before the start of term. I have no intention of sending you to a school with a dangerous creature roaming its halls, and if I understand correctly, you feel the same way. I ask, simply, if you would be willing to help me find the diary.”
“There…was a- a presence there… A shadow without a person attached. I’ve seen it before, but I never paid much attention to it, not until today. It…” Draco sat in his chair again. “It mattered more today.”
, was
“No,” Draco said, not aware that he was speaking out loud. He made no attempt to use his wand, which he held in a slack hand.
A couple minutes later, the door carved itself into the wall and swung open, revealing a very tired, very confused Pansy. “Draco,” she said, “what are you doing here?”
Hi again, everyone! I'm BACK and feeling much better :D
Then, on the other, equally unpleasant side, Draco could hardly force Potter to stay home with the Dursleys— not after everything he had learned about them… So what could he do? Or should he do nothing at all?
“Ha!” Pansy shook her head again, sending her short hair flying. “Merlin, you’re both awful at this.”
“When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography — which I will now be happy to present him now, free of charge—” he paused for more applause— “he had
I feel it's important to say that Draco Malfoy is a flawed, and at times, incredibly problematic, character. In this chapter, he doesn't acknowledge or have any real reaction to Dobby's injuries, which is unfortunately true to his canonic depiction. I don't think Draco would have any reason to think Dobby's treatment (which is horrible and completely inhumane) was something to take note of. Certainly, I don't see Draco finding any reason to change the Malfoys' behaviour toward Dobby, either. Draco's lived his whole life with both parents abusing Dobby to the point where it's a totally normal thing, and it's even something Draco does too, in this chapter. Despite this, I do think that hearing how poorly Harry's treated by the Dursleys might eventually help Draco make the connection to the Malfoys' ill treatment of Dobby...but I'm still not really sure about that. The Wizarding World doesn't treat house-elves like humans, so Draco may never make that connection. Still, I don't see Draco having a ton of sympathy for Dobby at this stage in his life. And I know this is a lot, but I did feel it important to talk about. This fic is from his perspective, after all. I don't want his views to be mistaken for mine.
Sleep that night, it turned out, did not come easily. There were about a million things tangling together in Draco's mind, especially after finding Potter at the Weasleys’. And lying in bed, wasting hours rumpling his sheets, wouldn’t do him any good. So Draco decided to get up and wander the silent manor. Following no particular path, he eventually found himself facing a familiar door. Tension twisted itself around his muscles. It had been almost a year since he last entered the piano room.
Draco faltered, and the distance between his feet and his father’s grew. “But if there are bad purebloods, doesn’t that mean there can be good Mudbloods?”
The keys slid beneath Draco’s fingers as he finished the piece on the tonic of D sharp minor. The notes charged off into the air. Everything about his life had been upended when he had foolishly decided to ruin Potter’s.
“Master intends to use the diary to open the Chamber and control the monster, but Dobby isn’t sure how. He thinks Master may not know either because every time Dobby asks, Master’s only answer is to punish him,” said the elf, displaying bruises up and down his skinny arms.
The first Quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor came soon enough, and Draco wasn’t upset when Potter won, catching the Snitch right out from under Draco’s reaching hand as he always seemed to do.
There was a loud thumping sound on all sides.
signifying Dobby’s departure, Draco closed his eyes. He had always thought Potter looked underfed — in fact, it was common speculation among his fellow Slytherins that Potter was a picky eater, that none of the Hogwarts meals were good enough for him — but to find out that wasn’t an illusion created by clothing far too large for him…it was completely different. It was
With those two momentarily distracted, Granger fixed her attention on Draco. “You’ve been staring at him all morning,” she said under her breath, “which I assume means you’ve found something? That or you suddenly find your own body very attractive, and I don’t think that’s the case here. You look more anxious than anything else.”
Malfoy muttered something angrily to himself, but did as she asked anyway.
“He sways his hips a bit when he walks. Slower, Potter,” Pansy commented, watching Harry as he shuffled awkwardly across the stone floor. “Try it again, but focus on where you’re putting your weight. Here.”
invisibility cloak, then?” said Blaise, eyeing it with clear envy. “It looks different than the ones I’ve seen in the shops. Where did you get it? How long have you had it?”
“I do, but there were also some things I was hoping to find while we’re here. I don’t know the names of some of them…more the general type of information I’m looking for.”
Through the crack of the door Draco glimpsed an eye. An eye that, even in the darkness, even with the pupil overtaking most of the iris, looked green…
Dobby nodded. After a whirl of disorientation, they were standing in Potter’s empty bedroom. The novelty of the idea was lost on Draco, though. He was more concerned by the sheer mess of the tiny room. The bed was unmade, sheets rumpled and touching the floor; an empty inkwell lay cracked on the carpet; and the calendar fixed to the wall was crooked. The clothes were gone from the closet, Potter’s pillow was missing, and several of the drawers Draco opened were empty. Whatever had happened, Potter had left in a hurry. But had he gone willingly?
...right?
“You may not like it, sir,” said Dobby, startling Draco, who had quite forgotten he was there, “but Harry Potter will do better here. They is not the Dursleys.”
“Not quite what you were expecting, eh?” Pansy said.
“Harry Potter is determined to return, sir,” Dobby squeaked, before quickly adding, “but Dobby cast a Hover Charm. Harry Potter will be expelled! He will have no choice but to stay with his family, where he will be safe.”
“Ask no more,” said Mr Malfoy, and he began walking again, even faster than he had before. This time, Draco did not try so hard to catch up.
“Do your best,” she said, before giving her son a significant, if somewhat drawn, look.
If anyone would like to translate this into another language, feel free! Just please let me know and credit me as the author of the original English version.
Suddenly, the hospital wing doors banged open and Hermione and Ron rushed inside.
Just like that, Draco forgot his anger. His hand loosened on his spoon. “Did you get snapdragons? Tell me you got snapdragons.”
This fic is inspired by Kat Cunning’s song “Birds” and Jamie Drake’s “To My Love.”
Malfoy tutted. “You had better not treat my clothes the way you do yours,
“Is that…?” Pansy asked.
Before Draco could say anything in his defence, Madam Pomfrey said, “I’ll ask you not to assume anything about my patients, Weasley. Malfoy and Potter are both suffering, and I kindly ask you to leave so that I may deal with them.” She started moving toward him, flapping her hands to shoo him from the bed. “Goodness knows I’ve let you stay much longer than I’d have liked already. Good night.” With that, she ushered him the last couple steps toward the corridor.
Mr Malfoy’s smile remained, but it no longer reached his eyes. “I see.” He rested a hand on Draco’s shoulder and steered him in the direction of the staircase, away from the people clustered right at the entrance. “Do you have your booklist?”
squinting dramatically. He turned the light back off.
“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,” replied Mr Weasley.
“I don’t know,” said Draco, dropping his bag next to Potter’s on the floor, “but that latter one tells me I’m right about you: you
“Of course he does,” said Weasley.
Potter, Draco was sure of it. Draco knew Potter nearly better than anyone else; he couldn’t possibly spend all that time staring without being able to identify Potter, even marred by a Stinging Hex as he was. His eyes were that uncommon, beautiful shade of green, which draped like verdant fabric over Draco's dreams and fantasies— and they had always been incredibly emotive, too. Potter could convey entire soliloquies without uttering a word, and that day, Potter’s eyes were plainly asking Draco not to give him up.
from the music desk, where it swayed back and forth as it fell. He didn’t care to find a piece of music that matched his burgeoning mess of emotion, he just wanted to play.
“Thank Merlin we don't have to switch pants,” Malfoy said suddenly, “I don't think I could handle you in mine.”
children, dear,” said Madam Pomfrey, smiling at him.
that had compelled him to separate the article from the rest of the newspaper— no clear motivation, only want.
*******
It seemed to take ages for Potter to find the right page. His hands were shaking somewhat, and Draco wasn’t sure whether to interpret that as nervousness or reluctance to find the words that confirmed what Draco had told him. It took even longer for Potter to skim the passage, and when he finished, he frowned even harder at the bottom of the page.
Fear.
From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter turn toward him. “Everything's always an insult with you, isn't it? Can’t you be normal, for once?”
“Mm. I wouldn’t trust them with that,” Malfoy said. “Your best bet would be if Snape’s told Blaise or Pansy to do it. But even then,” he continued, tilting his head, “they’re not always reliable, either.”
“No… No reason?” Draco asked, incredulous. “NO REASON?!” He pushed Professor Snape away from him. “You- you— I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE ASHAMED—”
incorrect,” said Draco, not looking directly at him. “But this is the last place I wanted him to end up. Well, nearly, anyway. If Potter stays here, he won’t have anything preventing him from going back, and you know how bad that would be.”
After hesitating for a moment, Pansy said, “Oh, all right. But stay behind me.”
With an effortless sweeping arpeggio, Draco quickened his pace, and the ballade turned loud and rich and anxious— a byproduct of shifting to D sharp minor. The parchment dutifully recorded the rapidly-descending notes, ink flying neatly from an old pot to form the notation of the music.
“I was wondering if you’d let me stay and watch next time. Since you two clearly didn’t do the deed.”
“Good night,” said Professor Snape, nodding him out of the office.
“Surely you want a better education for our son!”
barely
“Good,” said Professor Snape. “I do not know the precise content of that conversation, yet I am aware of it. That makes it dangerous. If we, for a moment, pretend I am the Dark Lord, testing your mind for disloyalty, that memory will likely surface on its own. You must do your best to distract me from it. Now.” Professor Snape took his wand from his black robes. “Have you done as I asked?”
He bent to look at a shelf of skulls. “Everyone thinks he’s so
“Sorry?”
“But Harry Potter has escaped, sir! He escaped!”
great,
“Yes, all right.” Harry got up and stood in front of Malfoy, crossing his arms as well. “But you’ve got to turn your back.”
Draco gripped the sides of his desk to keep from rising. “And you didn’t think to tell me this sooner?”
Suddenly, Pansy went limp; Draco caught her. “You’re clearly hiding something,” she said, sliding out of his grasp, “and I’m going to find out what.”
would have, in that situation. Tell me, what would have looked more suspicious: Draco Malfoy harassing Harry Potter on his way to class, or the pair of us trying to sneak off somewhere, with neither of us saying a word?”
The answer was obvious, though disheartening: it was a decoy. They had to keep searching elsewhere.
GILDEROY LOCKHART
Mr Malfoy nodded for them to go, and pushed the books they had bought into Dobby’s waiting arms.
Harry and Malfoy pushed up a sleeve, then held their forearms together. Again, nothing happened.
Or something to that effect. I’ll just leave, shall I, and we’ll try this again.” She stepped backward. “All right. Close the door.”
“But… There wasn't supposed to be—” She stood suddenly and raced out of the room. Just as Draco was deciding whether or not he should follow her, she came back with a thick purple book, which she slammed onto the table between them. She started rifling through the pages.
Potter’s mouth, which was a great deal redder than it had been before, dropped open. “Right. That’s smart. Erm, but…what’ll we tell Madam Pomfrey about how we changed back?”
“I’m not buying today, Mr Borgin, but selling,” said Mr Malfoy firmly.
“Fine,” said Professor Snape, the corners of his mouth lifting slightly, “
“But he didn’t tell you hardly anything!” Pansy said.
“Where is it then?” she demanded, clasping her hands together. “My present?”
Draco looked around for something, anything, to keep Mr Borgin there. When he got his chance to open the cabinet, he didn’t want to be alone with his father. Facing away from the cabinet to draw attention from it, Draco focussed on the first thing he saw: a glass case with a withered hand inside, perched atop a velvet cushion. He pointed at the hand and asked, “Can I have

Next week looks to be very busy for me, so since this chapter is already written and I wanted y'all to get some gay Draco, I'm posting this now too. Enjoy!
It was the third week of June, which meant the students of Hogwarts were en route to King’s Cross Station. Most talked excitedly about the events leading up to their final exams (“I wish I’d gotten to see McGonagall’s giant chess set!”) or their plans for summer break (“Australia, would you believe?”), but Draco Malfoy was not most students. His eyes were closed, and his head, which rested against the back of his seat, rocked as the train chugged steadily on. Though to Pansy, Crabbe, and Goyle, he may have looked asleep, Draco was thinking about his enemy: Harry Potter.
“Honestly, Malfoy, at this point, there’s very few things I wouldn't consider doing to get back to my own body. How bad could it be?”
“Would you stop that?” said Potter. “It’s annoying.”
“Picture your mind — your thoughts, feelings, and memories — as a tree…”
“I do hate you.”
On the opposite end of the train, Draco found the compartment where Potter should have been. Inside, the Patil twins were talking animatedly with Ginny Weasley, while Granger looked out the window and worried her bottom lip.
Pansy threw him an amused look. “So shout.”
“I will,” he replied.
But maybe Draco was looking at things wrong. Potter was kind and warm and caring, all despite his awful upbringing. And he was brave and determined, or he would have died the previous year, protecting the Sorcerer’s Stone. Potter tended to do well in perilous situations. If Granger had been right — if the Dark Lord was indeed alive — then Potter was a symbol of hope, not someone in need of protection. Maybe he could handle this too.

“I passed Potter on my way here,” Draco said, addressing the wall next to Professor Snape’s head.
Draco eyed them with confusion. Surely
As if he needed another reminder of what was coming. Of his failures. Draco had only wanted to leave early so he could see Potter arrive at the station— so there’d be something
Little dots of colour appeared along the edges of Draco’s window, slowly expanding until they bloomed, in a squared arch, into close-set bundles of violet flowers— Peruvian heliotrope. Devotion. Draco leaned forward to smell them, getting a vague, though pleasant, vanilla scent. Today, he didn’t mind the flowers. Worrying about the near future made this newest bout of wandless magic seem almost tame.
“Look,” said Draco, pointing across the corridor, where many of the students’ bags had fallen off their shelves. They hovered briefly in the air and then started battering at the closed door.
“Bollocks,” he muttered to himself. He knew that green. He knew it all too well.
was what he had been waiting for, he wanted to be able to defend himself more completely. Using distractions was well good, but Draco didn’t want to depend on someone else lifting the spell for it to end. He wanted to do that himself.
Harry was shocked. He thought Malfoy would have been much nastier about the request, that he would have stripped off his pants and paraded himself through the hospital wing or something. “Thank you,” he said, somewhat breathlessly.

Up close, there were no signs the piano had ever been damaged: no grooves in the wood that didn’t belong, no dust when Draco ran a hand over it. It was as if no time had passed at all.

When Longbottom chuckled into his peas, Draco smirked. So he could get away with mild teasing. Excellent. He filed that knowledge away for later.
Draco blinked. “Something like that, yeah.”
Unfortunately for both of them, things didn’t happen quite like Draco had been expecting. Rather than falling to the floor, Potter fell to his knees. In the process, their bare forearms touched and the scraping sensation immediately dulled to mild discomfort. Their ribs started meshing back together, and within a matter of seconds, the rest of their bodies decided to start changing as well.
, the same way he didn’t belong to the Dursleys or to the Wizarding world. Draco couldn’t go around deciding things for him. The decision had to be Potter’s. Draco needed to give him the facts.
Draco paused.
For the rest of the day and well into the next, they continued training to be each other— with some degree of success. It was difficult, thinking up all your mannerisms and trying to replicate them when you weren’t in your own body. What was more, the pair oscillated between friendliness and hostility, which was its own mess. But if they had thought it hard to absorb a list of behaviours in the relative safety of their shared room, it was far more difficult to pretend once they’d been released from the hospital wing.
Draco turned down what he hoped would be a less crowded corridor, and was happy to note that there were only a couple students there. He began walking backward so he could watch Potter’s face as he said, “What are you suggesting we do, eh,
“I think he’d like it,” Pansy said with a sly grin.
“Isn’t that the
A beat. “You
“Yeah? And how do you suggest we do that?” Potter said hoarsely. “Turn on the light and hold hands?”
Harry and Pansy proceeded to have a very long, very animated conversation about Malfoy. Harry never thought he’d ever get on so well with a Slytherin, but it made a nice change, not being cut off by Ron or Hermione, who typically never even wanted to hear Malfoy’s name. Interestingly enough, Pansy seemed as passionate, if not more so, as Harry was about the topic. And she proved to be very insightful about Malfoy’s personality and habits, which Harry knew would be far more useful than merely working off of what Malfoy had offered.
“No, our dear Minister has thus far been oblivious to our…shall we say, more discreet activities,” Mr Malfoy continued, “but we must take steps to ensure he
“We did,” Draco said roughly. His bread, too heavy with soup, broke off at the crust and plopped into his bowl. He jabbed at it with his spoon.
It soon became clear that Harry Potter was not worshipped at home as he was by his friends and the Wizarding world. According to Dobby, Potter’s books and school things had been locked away in a cupboard, so he couldn’t do his homework or ride his broom; his owl, Hedwig, had been shut in her small cage, unable to exercise; Potter had hours worth of chores to do every day, while his cousin Dudley wasted his in front of what Dobby had called a “hellovision;” and Dudley beat Potter regularly, too, something the Dursleys never commented on or stopped. The discovery was—

Acacia, specifically yellow acacia, signified secret love.
Draco thought for a moment. Now was his chance to make good on warning the others…but Potter hadn’t believed Dobby, and Draco wasn’t sure what else he could tell him… “Just- just keep checking on him. In secret, like you were before.”
“‘Most?’” she repeated.
The shelves and jars and dimness of Professor Snape’s office took shape again. “Did you notice anything that seemed…out of place while you were under the spell?” he asked Draco.
“You’ve known for months?

have somewhere to be, you know.”
With Dobby gone, Draco set about getting rid of the marigolds. Unfortunately, no matter how many he plucked from between the stones of the balcony, or burned, or soaked in herbicide, more round blooms sprouted up, quickly spreading so far into his bedroom that it looked as if he had amber carpeting.
“Maybe,” she said, brown eyes glinting mischievously. “You know Draco likes to have company, it wouldn't be out of the question.”
THIS IS A PART ONE OF (possibly) THREE because I don’t know when I’ll finish the whole rewrite, or how long this will end up being. Rest assured that I have plenty of ideas, I just need to find the time and motivation to get the chapters out and get to a point where I’m happy with that section.

“It’s not being rude if I’m giving you good advice,” said Draco.
Pansy cackled. “Oh, that’s almost
Granger blinked. “Of course. Erm, why don’t you let me read it, and I’ll tell you if I think it’s missing anything.” In a lower voice, she added, “I do that all the time for Harry.”
Draco didn’t know if he had the strength to open one more of those letters. He knew what they were going to say. He had always thought Potter chose his friends because they worshipped him like everyone else did, but after reading their letters, Draco knew that wasn’t true. Yes, maybe they were desperate for Potter to respond, but that didn’t come from a place of inferiority— rather, it was from concern, something Draco now shared.
“Ah, Potter,” Draco said. “Good. You’re here. Give me your glasses.”
Mr Malfoy smiled encouragingly at his son, no doubt expecting him to be overjoyed at the prospect. All Draco could manage was a weak return of his father’s expression.
Harry took a bite, and to mask his distaste, glared at Malfoy across the room.
“Yes, sir?” said the elf in his squeaky voice. “How can Dobby be of service?”
After slipping into a new set of trousers, Draco sat on the edge of his bed, his mind moving too quickly to lie back down. Merlin, but he felt there was something off about the dream. But was that because he had almost kissed

Draco scoffed. This was no great secret, the school board had been alerted the moment Lockhart accepted the position at Hogwarts. Draco had known months ago, thanks to his father, who was a governor on the board. None of them had been sworn to secrecy, yet all of Flourish and Blotts seemed to be shocked and excited at the news.
“So you’re not done trying to get rid of him, then.”
“Quiet, Draco,” Professor Snape said. His voice became monotone and almost lazy when he spoke again: “Envision all your thoughts and feelings as a tree, the oldest you can think of. Draw your attention to the roots— see how they tangle together and grow from each other, how they sit weightily in the grass. Follow the roots that extend beneath the soil
Draco’s body seized up and he fell toward Pansy. She lowered him to the floor. “It’s for your own good, darling,” she sang, patting his cheek before sliding the drawer open again, completely unimpeded.
Eons later, Dobby returned. Energy exploded inside Draco and he raced over to the elf, grabbing his tiny shoulders perhaps too harshly, but he didn’t care because he needed to know “What happened? How did it go? What did Potter say?”

Not again.
“Okay…” Something quite evil drew Pansy’s lips upward. “Maybe you don’t have to tell him at all. Maybe you grab him next you see him—” she mimed taking hold of someone’s shoulders—  “and then—” she slammed the table, pinning the imaginary person beneath her.
“Are you still in here, Draco?” Blaise asked one of the sinks.
She sighed. “It was me.”
“Who do you think would keep the lost fingers, though?” said Weasley, who was trying to snip the leaves off one vine without getting snipped himself. “You know, once you’re back to normal? You or Harry?”
Draco arched an eyebrow. “You mean you

“I suppose,” said Draco, not entirely sure about that. Before Hogwarts, he had done loads of research on the other boy… In any case, he closed his eyes and searched his mind for something he could use. Moments later, he was ready and they went again…
It terrified Draco that he knew so little of his father’s plan. His parents had been fighting over the Chamber of Secrets since the thirty-first of July, and Draco hadn’t felt comfortable voicing his own opinions— he feared his father might set the monster on him, too, for being…insubordinate. It certainly didn’t feel too out of character these days.
“Is it?” said Malfoy. He threw his sheets aside and stepped out of bed. He crossed his arms and stared expectantly at Harry. “Up.”

Enjoy the last chapter of this fic and stay safe!
Harry chuckled at that.
“If touch was important the first time around, it would be foolish not to explore that again now.”
“Good night, Potter,” Draco teased.
Startled at the proximity of the girl’s voice, (she was standing in front of the next column!) Draco tripped over his things. Talos, his eagle owl, awoke and nipped angrily at the bars of his cage.
,” Professor Snape murmured.
Draco froze, knife stopping mid-cut. He and Potter hadn’t discussed food preferences. Of course, now that seemed a rather large oversight.
It seemed to take forever for her to do something, like she was moving through water. Draco’s heart thumped quickly. He couldn’t decide whether he wanted his eyes to be open or closed when Pansy saw who was in the picture.
“We can’t not talk about how weird this is,” Potter said.
“Are you ready?” Professor Snape asked when Draco came back.
“When you are successful, and it seems we are getting much closer to that, you will no longer have to share these thoughts with anyone else,” Professor Snape assured him. He knelt before Draco. “They will be yours alone.”
Draco barely had time to register what she said before the fire turned green and a pair of pointed black shoes popped through the flames. He leapt aside as the rest of Pansy materialised and she stepped out onto the hearthrug.
Raziel sprung up onto the arm of Draco’s chair, turned, and settled heavily across Draco’s lap. He pushed his long, naturally-serious face into Draco’s hand. Absent-mindedly, Draco scratched under the cat’s chin.
“Have we decided, then?” said Pansy. “What would you like to know about Draco?”
As they reached their last destination, Draco felt less and less sure he’d run into Potter again, but seeing the lines of people funnelling into Flourish and Blotts gave him some semblance of hope. A large banner draped above the front entrance of the building announced:
Several days after their return from Hogwarts, Pansy came over. She gave Draco a warm hug when she waltzed into the entryway.
“Yes,” Dobby said thoughtfully.
Pansy pulled herself up onto the counter and dangled her pale legs over the side. She smoothed down her skirt. “You've got to whine a bit more when you speak. Draco never would have told you that himself, seeing as he always complains when I tell him he whines. Doesn’t stop it from being true.”
“Try your best,” Professor Snape repeated firmly, “and we will see where you are in two weeks.”
“Of course,” Draco said, his smile dropping. He sat, then started rummaging in his bag for a piece of parchment.
“You just said you think he likes you too. Why would he say no?”
“I know. But Ron already knew, and of course he was going to tell me… And look,” said Hermione, holding up a set of robes, “we also came to give these to Harry. You’ll let us at least do that, won’t you?”
“Stupid Potter,” he said quietly. His eyes stung. He looked up at the ceiling, breathing deeply as he willed the forming tears to stop. They rolled down his cheeks anyway.
Harry woke up in another person’s body. Frankly, aside from a couple of new things — longer limbs and fingers, blonder hair, eyes that worked on their own — he didn’t really feel much different. Of course, being in a taller person’s body meant that his pyjamas didn’t quite fit him the way they normally did. There was now a significant gap between where the striped fabric ended and his wrists and ankles began.
“I know,” Professor Snape said, his eyes softening. “I know you wanted those memories to work. Still, I must ask you to make a small sacrifice for the sake of the larger picture.”
Then shame crashed over him, fast and heavy, like walking under a waterfall. He had completely forgotten to tell Dobby about warning the Muggle-borns off Hogwarts. No, he had been too busy thinking about how

“Did I end the spell?” Draco asked him.
“I wonder how that feels,” Weasley said sarcastically.

Draco breathed deeply and rolled his shoulders. He tested a couple keys to ensure the piano was in tune. It was.
be Harry Potter!”
There was more applause from the crowd as Potter was given what looked like a very heavy, very cumbersome stack of books. Draco took this as his chance to start making his way downstairs. Potter would probably want to escape the spotlight after that horrible encounter, it was the perfect time to run “accidentally” into him. Draco pushed past the many people who had squeezed themselves onto the balcony, holding his breath so he could make himself that much smaller…
care; don’t forget, I can easily make all your friends turn against you. This body,” he said, looking down at himself, “could do a lot of damage.”
“Not going to do it here, obviously,” said Draco thinly, moving to Potter’s bed. Gently, he opened the curtains.
But that couldn’t be right. The Dursleys hadn’t seemed to care about Potter at all. It certainly hadn’t been love that Draco saw in their eyes. Picking Potter up seemed a chore to them. Taking
The diary had an unassuming black leather cover, plain but for the year 1943 printed on it in faded golden ink. Draco held it in one hand, testing its weight. It was reasonably light. He turned it over; the back cover had the location from which it had been purchased. Vauxhall Road in London…he didn’t recognise the street name… Maybe it was a Muggle shop. Odd, considering its purpose, its link to Salazar Slytherin, who loathed Muggles…

Mr Malfoy checked the time again. “Better be quick about it, wouldn’t want to be stuck in this infernal place for too long,” he said with a sneer, eyeing a nearby stack of mouldering papers with great disdain. “Give me your list, I’ll find those books while you look for the others.”
“Okay,” Potter said. Then, to approximately where Draco was standing, he added, “Keep the cloak on, I think I hear Nott getting up,” and left the bathroom after Pansy.

complain about things that you actually, secretly like.”
“You see, Draco, the things blood traitors resort to so that they can alleviate their tempers…” said Mr Malfoy as he stalked toward the Leaky Cauldron. To keep up with him, Draco followed at a near run.
“I’m worried about you, if you’ll believe it. You don’t laugh at my jokes nearly as often as you used to, and you’ve spent most of your time thinking about Potter. Watching him, too.”
“Comes with the territory,” said Harry gesturing to his body. “If you hadn’t noticed, Malfoy’s very dramatic.”
They sat at one of the tables near the windows. “I do,” said Draco, “but not on these terms.
Supper at Malfoy Manor took place promptly at seven o’clock after the clang of a bell, which was magically magnified to reach every corner of the grounds, and that evening began no differently. Mr Malfoy discussed his day at the Ministry of Magic, Draco and his mother listened patiently, they ate a three-course meal prepared by Dobby.
“Blasted elf,” said Mr Malfoy under his breath. He reached for the wine bottle. “I made it clear that Dobby was not to—” He shook his head, setting the bottle aside. “But that is an issue I will deal with later. We will be travelling to Burgundy.
In two quick motions, Professor Snape pulled his sleeves up to his forearms. He pointed his wand at Draco. “Let’s begin.”
“Good.”
The problem lingered through Herbology— at Draco’s peril. That day, they were dealing with Venomous Tentacula, and thankfully Granger had been watching, or Draco would have lost a few fingers to the grabby plant.
“They is putting bars on Harry Potter’s window!”
This is tolerable
“How can I not, when you refuse to acknowledge the dangers you’ll be sending him into? And, might I remind you, you brought this up over dinner! What did you expect, to laugh together over drinks while we decided the fate of innocent children?”
“I never said anything about it being
He hadn’t even considered looking for the diary. Of course, now that his mother had suggested it, he was surprised that he hadn’t connected that himself. It was so obvious, of course they should try to find it! Somehow, that diary would set everything into motion, and if he and his mother could destroy it before the start of term, Potter wouldn’t need protection from whatever the monster was, because it wouldn’t be loose.
And Harry still got to see some of Hermione and Ron, too. They met up almost every day to comb through the library for a book that might give them more answers about what had happened to Harry and Malfoy. Even with Madam Pince’s recommendations (ignoring her brusqueness, of course), they didn’t have any luck.
Draco should have celebrated. This was what he’d wanted all those months ago, wasn’t it? Potter gone? But the Weasleys never would have let Potter stay at home while they sent their children to Hogwarts. And Ron was missing, too. Frustration twisted nastily with fear in Draco’s stomach. Something was very, very wrong. Something had happened to Potter. Turning away, Draco headed back toward his own compartment.
Draco ducked his head. “I gathered as much from Granger and Weasley.”
of it, and definitely not the bits at the—” Draco shut his mouth. Even referencing the end of the fantasy was too much for him. He was grateful for the perpetual chill of the dungeons; he felt his face was nearly on fire for the intensity of his blush.
“Very,” said Potter. “Thanks for the fudge and the jumper, Mrs Weasley.”
“Well how was I to know that the curse — or spell, whatever this is — would transform you completely?” Ron countered. “There are a couple curses that involve switching eyes, or feet, or something, usually between enemies or people who don’t get along.”
Professor Snape stared at him for a long moment. “I don’t believe that interaction would go that way,” he said. “Frankly, that didn’t even sound like Potter.”
“Yes,” the boys chorused.
“Yes. Let’s try this a couple more times, favouring your tactile senses over the others, but we’ll let the spell last longer.”
— chest, and instead kept his gaze on the white ceiling. But when he got to his trousers, Harry forgot himself somewhat. As he pushed them down, he noticed that Malfoy’s knees were significantly less knobby than his own, and that, while both of them were thin, Malfoy seemed less runty, more lean.

“You have told me this at least a dozen times already,” said Mr Malfoy.
Draco hated who his father was becoming. Had become? Had been all this time? It was impossible to tell.
“I don’t—” Draco set his tea down carelessly on the table in front of him, startling Raziel. He tore from the room in a monochrome blur. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“It is, isn’t it? Here you are,” said Pansy, pulling Harry toward a chair near the fire. She sat in the one next to his, then handed him a book from the table between them. She reached for a different one, opened it to a random page, then pretended to read.
“Oh…” Draco’s heart thudded heavily. “Maybe he’s putting it back now,” he said, not really believing it.
good.”
“That wouldn't be the worst thing, yours look terribly ratty. How old are they?”
For the first time since collecting Potter’s letters, Draco felt a strong compulsion to write one in response. He wouldn’t want to see Granger either, and felt the childish need to tell her that. Among other things. Like how boring she was, or that her intelligence really meant nothing if all she did was repeat things she read in books. True knowledge was incorporating your own views and ideas into what was given, and thus far, Draco hadn't seen any signs she was capable of doing that. No one liked a parrot.

.’” Draco whispered the words as Potter mouthed them. He had stared at the photograph so many times, he’d unintentionally memorised the fragment. Then, transfixed, Draco watched Potter’s mouth grow wider, his eyes crease and become smaller. Seeing Potter smile was no rare thing, but this one was special— this one belonged to Draco and Draco alone.
“Don’t read too much into it, Potter, it’s a lot easier to listen to you like that. You sound so reasonable when you're wearing my face and speaking with my voice. And my arse,” said Malfoy, voice dipping into a strange octave, “well…I never realised it looked that good.”
