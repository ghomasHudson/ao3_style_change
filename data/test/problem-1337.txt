“There’re going to be more times?” Draco said, letting his fingers drift over Harry’s prick through the thin fabric of his briefs.
“I wonder how much money strippers make in general. It’s probably a decent amount, if they’re good at it,” said Luna. “I would love being a stripper, I think. It seems like it would be so fufilling, making people happy simply by revealing your body to them, by becoming vulnerable for them.”
Another question: three weeks after Charlie left, why did Harry wind up having sex with Seamus? Answer: because apparently, between the two of them, Seamus and Harry hardly had two brain cells to rub together, and they both drank way too much.
Pansy narrowed her eyes. Thank Merlin, Draco thought. Something besides fluttery lashes and compliments. “What’s going on, Draco?” she asked.
Fucking hell, Harry was going to come in his pajama trousers. Surely Malfoy could feel how hard he was. His cock was directly against Malfoy’s head, for Merlin’s sake.
It wasn’t as though Draco had expected him to drop everything to celebrate. Or, well, okay, he had expected that, a bit, but he had been trying to be understanding. He knew Harry was under a lot of stress. But the git hadn’t even
On Thursday, Harry and Hermione met for drinks and she talked about Blaise. They had a date on Saturday, and they were going to a fancy muggle restaurant and Hermione was nervous. “We’ve only been with each other at parties and clubs. What if we have nothing to talk about?”
He let out his breath and realized he was the only one left in the Common Room besides Professor Mehta. “Draco Malfoy, right? Do you know where you’re going?” she asked.
Draco sucked in a breath to ask about Harry, but Berold was pulling him and Frankie towards William’s quarters. “We’ll ask details there,” he said. “They’ll know more.”
Short of that, Astoria had several backup plans. But there was no need to resort to those yet. Better to see Draco and Potter in action this evening at Potter’s birthday party, see how the next week or so unfolded, and then take stock of the situation.
And then by the end of that night, Draco had gotten and given oral sex for the first time. It was a revelation, and wonderful, and Draco wanted to do it all the time until he died. And it was so lovely, and so distracting, that sleep had come quick and easy afterwards. Draco felt some of the fog lift that next day, and more and more as the encounters went on.
Harry took Draco's face in his hands. “No, I’m saying that because it’s true,” he said, kissing Draco’s mouth softly.
Harry smiled back, and soon they were walking out the doors and through the tiny town that housed the tavern. It was a twenty-minute walk to the cottages, and the night was warm and lush, crickets chirping everywhere. There were no streetlights, just lights from some of the houses. A round of laughter carried out from an open window, and Charlie took Harry’s hand.
“I’m not dating her. We broke up months ago. Right after…” Harry felt himself blush at the memory. “Right after that night in the kitchen.” Their first time having sex had been in the kitchen, simply because that’s where they started kissing, and they didn’t pause long enough to relocate. Harry had been perched on the counter, and it had been bloody
Potter was quiet but Draco could feel the heat of his gaze. “And now you aren’t like that? Is that what you’re saying?”
“Well, we know a bit more now,” said Potter. “We know there’s a Queen and people who are on her side and people who aren’t. We know that you run the risk of getting kidnapped, apparently.”
Draco closed his eyes and nodded, and Harry, unable to help himself, pulled hihm close and kissed his forehead. He felt, suddenly, like crying, although he didn’t know why, exactly. He thought that maybe it was the delicacy of this thing, how it felt fragile as spun glass, and so, so precious.
“I would think so,” William said. He looked thoughtful for a moment. “I wonder if you’d encounter Ethereans in all of them, or whether there are some they never reached?”
And then Sunday, he’d been so weird, hardly meeting Harry’s eyes, refusing to be around him until supper.
Harry and the kids played Marco Polo in the shallow part of the pond, and then Harry spelled some round stones so that they glowed faintly, tossed them into the water, and dared the children to go diving for them. They raced back and forth for a while after that, and then Harry taught them all how to do a breaststroke, which he’d had to learn at the muggle school he’d attended before Hogwarts. None of them knew how to do it; it seemed that swimming was not a popular wizarding sport. Harry resolved to talk to Ginny about swim lessons. It seemed like a good thing to know how to do, for safety reasons, and because it was an excellent way to stay healthy. He wondered if Malfoy would let Scorpius take lessons, too.
“What is it, Harry?” asked Hermione, shutting her eyes and rubbing her temples. “Sorry my eyes are closed. The sun seems especially bright today.”
, for Merlin’s sake. He just wanted to be with someone who made him happy. Preferably forever. “Harry with you?”
“What in the world are you doing in here with this creature?” McGonagall asked, her voice a bit shrill. “You are supposed to be in your dormitories!”
What the hell was he doing in here? And no, obviously Weasley was not awake – Weasley snored like a fucking walrus with a sinus infection, and the sound was echoing throughout the dorm room at this very moment.
“Go on,” Hermione said. “Take this; his class gets out at eight and he’ll be coming home to wash up, and then who knows where in the world he’ll be. You only have a small window before he'll be gone again. Not to mention, it’ll take me forever to get a new Portkey set up, and this one’s going off in ten minutes.”
Draco turned around to where Harry had suddenly appeared in the middle of the darkened room, clad in shorts and short-sleeved linen shirt and flip flops, clutching a suitcase and a hairbrush.
He felt himself waver, so much Sen having been spent. He hadn’t been careful to keep a little inside; he’d used all of it. He collapsed beside Harry, feeling the world waver in and out, and settled into Harry’s still-warm body, and closed his eyes.
“Florida…” Draco mulled the word over. He couldn’t remember if that was the place where all the film stars lived. Honestly, he knew two things about America: one, that it had small, scattered wizarding communities, and two, that New York City was home to his mother’s favorite clothing store outside of Paris, called Amortentia. She traveled there every other year just to shop, and had things delivered to the Manor the rest of the time.
Instead of thinking of Evenwood, he decided to think of the waterfall. It was so close, only at the bottom of the hill. He would probably have been able to hear the crash of it from here if it wasn’t drowned out by the sound of waves hitting the shore. He thought about the feel of the water slapping down on his skin, then imagined it hitting the smooth rocks beneath. He thought about the chill of it, and the way the warm rocks felt so good on his feet after he’d finished cleaning himself. He thought about the waves and the smell of salt, of the way the hills looked overhead. He thought of it, and then he imagined
But then he cheered up, because as they descended the concrete stairs, the thumping of the bass got louder and louder. And it was difficult to feel too sad when everything in him was telling him to start shaking his arse.
“Mm, yes, lofty goal indeed,” Draco said, pouring it into two shining crystal glasses and adding a big square of ice to each. “Here you are, sir.” He handed Harry a glass. “To many more days of dancing not terribly.”
for Draco, then perhaps he did. If Draco just happened to make his way to the waterfall while Potter was there, if he accidentally encountered him, then perhaps one thing would lead to another, and who knew how it might all turn out.
“I’ve got to go,” he said, realizing Ernie would be at his place any minute. “I’m going to be late for the final stage of my revenge plan. Can’t have
Better to think about the day ahead. After work, he had a meeting with the bloke who wanted to open up a franchise in Minneapolis. That was promising. He would be Harry’s fifth franchisee, and his financials were excellent.
“You could help me look, maybe,” Draco said, then immediately wished he could take it back. Harry probably felt weird about it, because it was weird of Draco, to ask.
?” she said, kissing his cheek. “I was worried sick! I was two seconds away from owling your father.”
Draco didn’t want to parse through how that made him feel. “Ugh, you ought to be coming with me, you cow,” Draco said, not for the first time.
“Michael Corner became a burlesque performance artist. Yeah, nobody else saw that one coming either, but he was always sort of weirdly hot, with a very distinct sort of vibe. Everyone went to go see him when he performed at Chez Michou in Paris. It was fantastic.
“Well. Um. No? Because Tuesdays and Thursdays I’ve been running with Ginevra. And we go a lot further than you and I go, and I don’t know if you’d manage it. And also, because it’d be awkward as hell with you there.”
“No. Don’t listen to Quidditch much anymore,” he says, pushing the white-blond hair from his forehead. He’s wearing a tight black t-shirt today and he looks so good it should be illegal. You wonder what he’d do if you told him he was under arrest for being too sexy. If you literally cuffed him right now. You try not to giggle out loud; Merlin, your brain is a fucking liability. You should be arresting
“Not really. Or…” Harry thought about it. Ron hadn’t seemed upset, had he? He thought back to the aftermath of everything. Ron hadn’t said much. He’d sort of just rolled over and passed out. Harry could hardly remember; sleep had taken him so quickly. “I don’t think he was, anyway.”
Draco was curled up on the floor, a dusty tapestry covering him, fast asleep. His blond hair was shining in the gloom, his face peaceful, his pointy, stubborn chin relaxed into softness. Harry knelt by his side and watched his chest move up and down, watched his curled fingers twitch once and then become still again. “Draco,” he whispered, reaching out to touch his pale brow. “Draco.”
She looked at him and sighed. “I suppose that’s true.” They watched as a great stag came to the edge of the lake and dipped his head, only to recoil and run away into the trees.
“Hey, so I want to tell you something,” Harry said, leaning over to pick a sausage off Malfoy’s plate. Malfoy slapped at his hand, but Harry managed to take it, and quickly took a bite.
Monday morning, Draco was tired. He hadn’t slept well since Friday. Thoughts of Potter’s face in that alley had been keeping him up, unease creeping through him even as he wanked again and again until his cock was sore from it. He’d tried to keep himself busy – catching up on some research in the lab and meeting up with Blaise and Theo at a pub and seeing his mother on Sunday. But Potter hadn’t been far from his thoughts, not even as he laughed at Blaise’s latest adventures in dating, not even as he listened to his mother talk about how the weather had been perfect for the roses, and how lovely they would be that year.
“Pans would wear a dress that costs as much as a house. And it would probably be black. She obviously can’t wear white.”
“We didn’t shag,” Harry said. “We got each other off in the alley. Nothing particularly memorable about it. it took all of five minutes and we were done.”
He was woefully behind on his twenty inches for Potions, mostly because of last week’s Charms essay (how had that only been last week; it seemed like it was a century ago) and all his SASS obligations. And, also, because he had spent yesterday in emotional turmoil and hadn’t been able to get a single thing done.
Everyone went silent. Draco turned to look at Harry, who was staring resolutely at the ceiling. “What the fuck does that mean?” Draco asked.
“Internet,” Pansy said, whispering and looking around. “Is a kind of muggle magic. I found out about it this summer, when I stayed with my cousin Florina in Paris. You can talk to people on it, and ask questions, and do all sorts of things.”
“Absolutely-fucking-not, you wanker. Get in the damn shower and do something about your hair and make sure to give your cock-n-balls a good scrub, because I am taking you
“Goodness, no!” she said, laughing. “You’re the catalyst. The warrior. You are here to make it possible.”
“Apparently, Harry, your reputation is more than enough to wipe my slate clean,” he said to Harry when they had pulled away into an antechamber of the ballroom to kiss and gossip.
Ginny was watching him, and he noticed that her eyes were a little shiny. She blinked rapidly and cleared her throat. “I never thought I’d feel bad for Lucius Malfoy, but…”
Draco bristled. Only because this was supposed to be Slytherins and Potter, not a great big party. It had nothing to do with not wanting to see Blaise cuddled up with Padma. Nothing at all. “Oh, wonderful.”
“Yes, because I’d come back by then. But I was dead, for a while. It was an Avada Kedavra, Draco. You don’t live through those.”
“Not going to have that conversation with him via owl,” Draco said. He’d thought long and hard about it, and it didn’t seem right. Charlie would be home in a few weeks and Draco would talk to him then. “And it’s just lunch. With
“Fuck!” Zabini cried, stumbling away from the bed and clutching his nose, which had begun to bleed. Harry seized the opportunity by jumping up and clocking him on one side of the head and then the other, and then Zabini’s elbow hit Harry right in the eye.
Draco smiled, or at least tried to, before setting the shirt down on the counter. He took another sip of his pink drink.
to them. All of the kids were perfectly capable of reading it to themselves, but Harry’d always read to his kids at night and they still hadn’t broken the habit. Even James didn’t protest, which was a miracle. Scorpius didn’t seem to mind, either, listening avidly and giggling at the silly bits as he snuggled down into his comforter. Malfoy listened at the doorway for a while, arms folded over his chest and a faint smile on his face, before coming inside to kiss Scorpius and say goodnight to everyone, after which he drifted away.
It wasn’t even that far away, he realized. He wasn’t sure of the exact date, but it had to be April, by now. Then it hit him.
Slowly, like he was unwrapping a gift, Harry untied the belt of his robe, and let it fall open, and placed a lingering, soft kiss right below his belly button. Draco’s cock was fully hard – proximity to Harry tended to do that to him, as did hearing Harry talk like this – as Harry kissed over his stomach and his hips and trailed his fingertips softly up and down his thighs and his arse.  And then he felt wet heat wrapping tightly around his prick as Harry sucked him down, moaning softly.
“Rebounds can work sometimes!” she protested, sounding so convinced that Draco sat back up and looked at her, just out of curiosity. “My mother was a rebound, and she and my father are
He glared. “Lia is a self-righteous bitch who used me. She led me on and then discarded me when she didn’t need me anymore. And you…you were the worst thing that ever happened to me. You ruined my life. Of
“Fish pie and eel stew,” she said. “Same things we’ve been serving for forever. And the finest ale in Gogg.”
“You broke up?” asked Draco, raising his head. That was the best news. The absolute best news. He smiled.
Harry grabbed Draco’s wand from his shaking hand and cast a hot air charm over him, and he felt the blanket of heat smack into him and dry his sopping wet clothes. He was still shivering afterward, but not nearly so much.
The next day, Draco left Lia with Hermione and made visits to his friends and his parents. No one knew any of the details of his disappearance, except that he’d gone through one of the now-infamous portals. His father fumed about the incompetency of the Ministry, sending him there without any safety precautions in place. His mother kept kissing his cheeks and telling him she was so relieved he was safe.
Harry Potter was not the only fish in the sea. There were plenty of other men out there. Attractive men who might like Draco and enjoy spending time with him. Men who might accept him for who he was now, rather than continuing to judge him for things he’d done a decade earlier.
“Well…” said Tony. “You need to be keeping up on media, first of all. Hannah’s been giving you a press roundup every day.”
The days trudged by in that way, and in the evenings, Harry watered his garden and pulled out stubborn weeds, puttered around in his woodshop, and went for a few broom rides along the edges of his property.
“You know what, Ron?” Draco said. “Fuck you. I’ve been punched in the face by your sister and didn’t put up a fight. I just got punched in the face by you, and I’m not trying to hit you back. You’ve had a shot at me, so why don’t you just lay the fuck off?”
“Let’s stay one night. One night, okay? They won’t be working in the dark anyway. If nothing happens, we’ll go back in the morning.”
, could he? But no, there it was again -- fingers were twitching once more, lips pressing together, and Draco was sure, now, that he wasn’t imagining it.
Their feet were barely moving as they gazed at one another. Harry was rubbing Draco’s palm with his thumb, and Draco could feel that small touch ricochet all down his arm and along his spine. “I want to kiss you,” Harry whispered.
emanating from this one. It might be nothing but the hill, he reasoned. Or it might be the dark, swirling, frightening place.
Draco stared at her, his mouth hanging open. He was stunned into silence for a moment, and then he realized she was bluffing. Once, it would have worked; he’d have backed down, embarrassed that he’d doubted her in the first place. Once, not too long ago, he wouldn’t have believed her capable of any of this at all. He
He sighed. “I know. We’ve tried. There are too many purebloods in the Assembly at the moment.” He leaned back in his leather chair and put his hands behind his head. “If I can win this fucking thing, I’ll make it a priority. If we can get the public to pay attention, they can put some pressure on their reps. But the Prophet’s only so willing to give me a platform on things like that when I’m just another member of the Assembly.”
Harry shrugged. “I can cast a cleaning charm. It’ll take thirty seconds. Everything else can wait.” He wrapped a hand in Malfoy’s soft hair and brought his face down towards his own. He kissed him, and Malfoy tasted like toothpaste.
He could speak with Harry later, in private. And he ought to tell him not to share anything personal over text or email.
“I thought as much,” said Laurel. “You've been focusing solely on directing your power outward, yes?" Draco nodded. "Let us forget that part of the process. For now, you will not be directing Sen anywhere. I want you to focus on collecting it instead.”
he wanted. He was positively frozen in his indecision. So he sat, and thought, and kicked at the wall a bit.
Malfoy smiled again. It was almost a sweet smile. Pleased. It made Harry happy. Malfoy suddenly moved, then, crowding Harry up against the wall and looking up at him from under his darkened lashes. “You sure you don’t want a dance? You did pay, after all.” Malfoy took Harry’s hand and touched it to his chest, the bare part between the two sides of his shirt. Harry, feeling rather helpless, let Malfoy pull his hand down to the waistband of his trousers.
He’d been waiting on that all night. He’d just found out a week or two ago that Theodosia wrote erotica after
“What’s this?” asked Draco, pointing to the bottom of the map. There was a blackened line across it, maybe an inch from the edge.
For the first few weeks, Draco managed to avoid Potter almost entirely. He stayed in the Common Room with Pansy and Blaise until late in the evenings, and by the time he reached his own room room, Potter was already asleep, sprawled out, usually having kicked the covers off. Sometimes he kicked the covers off the bed entirely. Honestly, Draco’d never seen such a violent sleeper. It just figured. Potter was a brute even when he wasn’t awake.
It was plenty cool inside, though, and Harry soon found himself returning to a normal temperature. Pansy’s place was every bit as luxe as he’d imagined, very modern and flashy, with bold prints and colors and lots of gorgeous paintings of nude models. There were at least seven sets of tits that Harry could see hanging on the walls, and that was just in this room. At least three cocks as well.
Ernie and Daphne came around the corner, and his arm was thrown around her, and they were laughing together. Daphne looked up and saw him, and Draco wondered what his face must look like right now. “Hey, Draco,” Daphne began, her brow furrowing. “Are you --”
Harry grabbed Draco by the shirt and pulled him close and kissed him, and Draco saw Theo shoot them a strange look. Draco ignored it. Who the fuck was Theo to judge, when he himself wasn’t entirely straight? And Draco should know, considering he’d gotten him off a time or two.
Two days later, they emerged from the forest rather suddenly. The mammoth trees began to thin, then thin more. Then they were replaced by different trees, ones that were, in comparison, rather unimpressive, common-looking things. The grasses began to grow thicker and longer, and then, suddenly, they were looking down a hill at a town, and behind it, an endless sea.
Her grin slowly faded and she examined him. “What are you playing at, exactly? Are you joking? Or is there some other reason you’re announcing your proclivities to your long-term beard?”
“Body rolls? Very basic move. The most important thing, you might say, in stripping, at least for men. For women, it’s all different, of course.”
Draco sucked in a breath. He felt like they were suspended in time, like his whole life had been rushing to this point, and now everything was still and waiting. “It does,” he said. “It makes sense. I felt like that too.”
“Yes, I think so,” she said carefully, making the puzzle-solving face again before looking back up at him, her eyes bright. “Is it strange that beyond the awful consequences of all this, I’m fascinated by it? I can’t wait to learn more. Dig further into theories of time, and the magic behind the turners, and everything.”
He found Ron attractive, yes. He’d liked what they’d done yesterday, even though Ron clearly hadn’t. Or, he had, rather, but not enough to stop him from freaking the hell out.
Harry felt an electric thrill along his spine at the thought of Draco in a muggle club. He’d been to pubs last summer, with Ron, but there weren’t
He got off the couch and pulled Ginny up by the hand, and then he hugged her tight, and she clung to him, her head buried in his chest.
Draco looked down at the baby. “He’s got quite a smile, with those teeth.” Teddy had two tiny teeth jutting up from the center of his bottom gumline, and was trying his best to get things in his mouth, to rub against his gums.
Harry pulled his legs up onto the couch and hugged them to his chest. The sky was lighting up more, now, glowing almost turquoise at the edge, the stars disappearing. The world was quiet, hushed, on this too-early Sunday morning. There were no horns, no sirens, just peaceful silence.
“Draco,” Kerrick said before he could take his leave. “You could come with me now. You have a great deal of power. I could teach you how to use it. You could see what it is like to be among your own kind.”
He wasn’t surprised this time when Harry appeared beside him, scrawny and small, hair everywhere. Draco braced himself, and then plastered on the arrogant sneer that he’d worn for most of his life. He began talking, the words spewing out of his mouth like bile. His parents, Quidditch, Harry’s dead parents – were they the right sort?, making fun of Hagrid. He hit on all the basics, and watched, sickened, as Harry’s face grew more and more distant. By the end, Harry looked positively disgusted. The witch pinning Draco’s robes and Madam Malkin didn’t look too impressed, either. How had he not noticed any of this the first time? Had he been so oblivious, or had their reactions simply not mattered to him? He couldn’t even remember anymore.
“Yeah, right. I’ll go.” Ernie walked towards the floo, and turned towards Draco once more, looking agonized. “I’m sorry.” And then he threw in his powder and said an address. Draco was pretty sure it was Justin’s. So, Ernie hadn’t bothered to buy his own place, at least not yet. Interesting.
“How interesting,” he said, as though it were anything but. “And you went to school with Draco, is that right?”
“I don’t want him to feel like we’re ganging up on him,” Hermione said gently. “This needs to be a discussion between the two of you. He’d be
Harry saw the bob of an Adam’s apple as he swallowed, and then watched as he moved his gaze downward to Harry’s face. His hand came to Harry’s hair, gently tangling in it, as Harry's mouth bobbed up and down along his pretty pink cock. It tasted so good, and there was come on it already, and it was Harry’s, and that was somehow really hot. Harry felt his soft cock perk back up just a little at the thought.
“You might’ve died, too,” Draco said, able to joke now that Pike was healed. “Let’s not forget about that.”
Malfoy stood behind maybe-Tessa, dragging his hand over his own chest and sliding left and then right, then spinning, all while looking at maybe-Tessa like she was dessert. He ran his hands down her arms and over her tits. She squealed, looking delighted and Harry could see her friends down below snapping pictures.
Scorpius led him straight through the house rather than in the direction of the room where he’d had tea with Pansy, and soon they were passing through another set of ornate doors that led to the back yard, if you could call it that. It looked more like a palatial estate than anything else. There were several vast, winding hedge mazes and expansive flower gardens. There was a greenhouse off to the left and what looked like an orchard off to the right. And further back, beyond the groomed spaces, there was a large pond and an expanse of meadow, replete with a riot of wildflowers. There were a couple of barn-looking buildings, and a fenced in area with horses. Then beyond that, off in the distance, he could see the start of a wood.
in the middle of this campaign, and he does tend to let guilt rule his life, and so…he hasn’t. But that’s not because of some wishy-washy feelings on his part. He wants Harry, no doubt about it. I think he just couldn’t see how to make it happen any faster without jeopardizing everything else. But it wasn’t because he was unsure about how he felt.”
She’d been looking down at her mug, but now her head jerked up, her eyes wide. They were a terribly soft brown, like doe eyes, ringed by thick, dark lashes. “What?”
“Because I’m just not ready, okay? It’s a big fucking deal, Euri. My kids are everything to me. I don’t want to do anything to confuse them or hurt them or…you just don’t understand. You don’t have kids of your own, and you don’t understand.”
And at the same time, he hated every day that passed, because it meant he was further from Harry, further from their last encounter together, further from their last kiss and their last fuck and the last time they’d said ‘I love you’. Further from the night that Harry’d said, with utmost sincerity, ‘I want that. I love you. I’ll wait.” Draco hated every second, every minute that went by, because he knew that after some unknowable number of them, he would begin to forget.
to do one of their spotlight articles on him, you know, with a photo spread. Play up the sexy bachelor thing.”
Harry was nervous as hell by the afternoon. His palms were sweaty and he was having trouble standing still. “Harry, you’re being strange,” said Scorpius, raising a blond eyebrow at him. He was his father’s son, to be sure, and had inherited the (judgmental, in Harry’s opinion) Malfoy eyebrows.
“You think psychiatric drugs are a better solution, is that it?” He sounded tired and annoyed, both.
Draco thought Farley might have muttered ‘traitor’ under his breath as he recorded the vote of his fellow Gryffindor. Draco was just waiting now, because he knew how the rest of the votes would go.
“One, I don’t talk to him, and two, I would never,”  said Harry, feeling cold all over as he looked back at the untouched wing.
Pansy chuckled and ran the back of her hand over Sarah’s freckled cheek. “You smell sweet. Like cupcakes.”
And then she’d climbed on top of him, and he’d looked at her small, perfect breasts, and at her taut stomach with its constellations of freckles, and he’d loved her so much he thought he might die. And then she’d slid over his cock, and he’d felt the slickness of her against him, back and forth, and then she’d shifted upwards, her eyes locked onto his, and started to push him inside of her. He’d wanted it, he’d wanted it so much, but they’d already been having some problems, and he wanted to work through them before they had sex. Because to him, for whatever reason, sex felt like a big deal.
“But I really do like him. He’s incredibly sweet, and he’s handsome, and he likes me and I never have to worry about whether he does. He wants to be with me.”
Oh, hell. Harry felt tears pricking his eyes. “Well. If anything were to come of it, you’d be the first to know. Okay?”
So when she woke up, they talked about how crazy the night before had been, and then they used their hands and fingers to make each other come again, and then they went down to breakfast in the Great Hall.
Lia, who was, in Draco’s experience, endlessly brave, seemed wholly freaked out. She noticed him watching her and scowled. “It’s just that I haven’t been around very much magic in my life. My father was the only one who had any, and he just used it to –”
Berold and the few other advisors who were familiar with the tunnel system that wound its way under the palace grounds sketched them out as best they could on parchment, scribbling out a rough map, and then coming up with a route that might bring them from the sea passage to the dungeons.
After a while, Harry was able to let go and enjoy the feeling of another person in his bed, enjoy the feeling of Ari, of his long, strong limbs, which were just now warm with sleep. Ari, who liked Harry and wanted to be with him. Ari, who was happy to meet all his friends and who had mentioned that maybe Harry could meet his brother and sister if they ever went back to the U.S. together.
“Good evening, dear minders of the child army,” he said as he approached. “And how have we fared today?” He shielded his eyes to scout for Scorpius and gave him a wave.
Hermione let out another great sigh, like the world would just not stop disappointing her. “I didn’t realize he was gay. I thought he was bi, like you. I mean, they’ve had a child together.”
It was only about a foot and a half tall, which was much smaller than many of the pieces, but Harry thought it was beautiful. It was a nude man, but it wasn’t especially risqué or anything – all the bits were so small, and not entirely distinct (his form was less and less specific the further down his body you got, so that his face was incredibly detailed, while his feet didn’t even have toes). He was standing suspended in what looked like a beam of light coming up from the ground in a broad, flat, sheet, half his body behind the sheet and half in front, like it was slicing him in two. His feet were pointed, almost like he was hanging there, or was doing ballet, and his arms were stretched to the sides gracefully, again, almost like he was dancing. The tiny wrists were angled delicately, and something about them made Harry’s chest feel tight. The sheet of light, or whatever, came up to his shoulders, and then above, his head was free, and loose, his expression rapturous. The piece was in gradient shades of color, from a deep, leather brown at the feet, to a clean white marble at the head.
Instead of dessert, they opted for little glasses of Green Chartreuse, which Euri said he liked to drink after dinner. It was smooth and gently sweet. “So, there are only three French monks who know how this is made. Literally. It’s a five-hundred year old recipe, and it’s never gotten out, because they guard it so carefully. Supposedly, they use 130 different herbs and plants to distill this stuff, and the green color is from something they macerate, some additional herbs or something. It’s all natural, the only green-colored liquor that is. Kind of neat.”
“I could actually stand to stop by my place,” Harry said. “I haven’t been there, and I probably won’t be able to tomorrow, what with Sar waking up.”
“Bloody hell if I know!" Draco replied, possibly a little too shrilly. "Maybe doing a little experimenting after his split from the Weasley girl?” Draco worked in the Department of Potions Regulations at the Ministry, which consulted with the Auror Department often enough that he tended to hear things. And also, Potter’s partner, Lavender Brown, was a gossip and a half. It certainly wasn’t that he had been keeping tabs on Potter’s life, no, absolutely not.
Harry smiled at him for a moment before facing the ceiling again. “Well, thank Merlin we’re alright. We fought a mountain troll and won. Kind of impressive, really.”
He curled his fist over the tip of his cock and stroked down once, twice, and had to bite back a moan. Merlin, he was a mess. He was a bloody pent-up, perverted mess. He let his thumb slide over his slit, picking up the slick that had collected there already, and swirled it over the head of his cock, letting out another shaky breath. Fuck, but he could come with a few good pulls, couldn’t he? His body was aching for release, his nerves on fire.
beautiful shirt, you arsehole,” Draco said, laughing, and then unlocked the door with slightly trembling fingers.
Draco tutted and looked irritated and then kissed him until he stopped laughing. He prepped him so gently and lovingly that Harry could only close his eyes and sigh at the soft pressure building when Draco rubbed up against a spot that seemed to set his body ablaze. It didn’t hurt at all, even though Harry was a little worried it would. It only felt good, as Draco stretched him and kissed him and licked him adoringly, like he was worshipping his body.
“Charlie!” cried Ginny, running over to him and tackling him. “You’re here! I thought you weren’t coming until next week!”
And he wanted to do this – and everything else – with Harry, who had run across that first threshold without hesitation. Harry, who had saved him and been saved by him in return. Harry, who had, unfathomably, been able to look beyond the boy he’d been to the man he’d become, and even further, to the man he wanted to be.
begun falling in love with Potter, then maybe now, he was incapable of feeling anything for anyone else, and Potter had ruined him. One fucking drug-induced kiss had ruined him for good, and now he was never going to be able to be with anyone else without feeling like he was faking it.
He moved on to the next bed, where a tall brunette named Clover was shivering and clutching at her head. He tried not to grimace when he saw the wound there.
, and he found himself stealing glances at Ginny and noticing how shiny her hair was, and how pretty her smile was, and how fun she was. She had always been fun, even in bed. She’d laughed a lot.
He shamefacedly made his way to the showers. Everyone would know, probably. They’d know that he’d just wanked thinking of Malfoy, and they’d judge him, and look at him in disgust, and all their (ridiculous) assumptions about Harry being so good and so upstanding would immediately dissolve and they’d see Harry for who he really was, which was, apparently, a deviant. A deviant who got off thinking of Draco Malfoy getting sucked off by another bloke while Harry watched.
“Awful, just like the last two. It’s quite difficult to find a good man these days, Draco. Speaking of, have you seen any more of Liam?”
“So, I’ve been thinking of other questions to ask you,” Harry said, turning towards Draco. Draco wished he would take off his dark sunglasses so he could see his eyes. “And I want to know why you’re doing this. I mean, I think I know which issues you’re passionate about. But why this position? Why now? It’s going to consume your life, you realize. Why are you doing it? And don't give me the usual bullshit; I want the truth.”
“Here,” said a voice, and Draco looked up to see William’s face, looking soft in the firelight. He settled his blue cloak over Draco’s shivering body.
Harry stepped towards him and put a hand on his cheek, let his thumb swipe over the bit of stubble there. “I’m going to talk to her,” Harry said. “Today.”
“Actually, I thought there might be something else you could help me with. What’s your name, by the way?” Draco said, letting his voice go low and sultry and meeting the man’s eyes, which were a soft, golden brown.
Draco stared at Potter’s profile for a moment, his dragonhide boots losing their regular, rhythmic clacking as he suddenly halted. “What is it I
“I missed you, too,” Harry said, feeling tears prick the back of his closed eyelids. It wasn’t fair, that they shouldn’t get to have this. How could anything this perfect be wrong? Why had this not worked? It should’ve worked. “God, Draco,” he breathed, wrapping his legs around Draco’s hips and capturing Draco’s mouth with his once again. “It’s never been like this with anyone else. It’s never felt like this.”
“Did you two need a place to sleep?” asked the woman. “We rent rooms, you know. I have one available.”
Hermione returned later that day from her tour of an ancient Etherean temple on the outskirts of the city, and joined Draco and Harry in the orchard. Draco said another round of goodbyes, this one faster and less personal than others he’d had over the past few days, and then he gathered Sen.
It had been so good, too. It was some sort of special torture to have had that time with Draco right before the bomb detonated. The way Draco felt in his arms, the things he’d said. The way Harry felt, like the world was shimmering and full of magic and so beautiful he could hardly stand it, and like nothing else existed, or had ever existed, outside of the curtains of his bed, outside of Draco and Harry, outside of their words and their skin and hearts and their hands.
“Fuck’s sake, do you tell her every time you go to the loo, too?” asked Draco. “This isn’t a big deal.”
Corner was coming from the back, heading towards him with his hands in his pockets and a sheepish expression on his face. Harry nodded and grabbed a cigarette, handing it over, lighting it with his wand. Corner leaned against the wall next to him, inhaling and frowning at the bright orange tip. “Haven’t done this in a year, probably.”
“I know. I’ll explain it to him. But I don’t think you should be by yourself tonight. I’m a bit worried. And Pansy’s in no state to take care of you.”
He heard Malfoy mutter a cleaning spell, then move around. Harry stayed still for a long time, and then finally chanced opening his eyes again. Malfoy was facing the wall and seemed to be fast asleep.
“The body folded in on itself, shrinking. Winter and Thera hurtled down the disappearing body of the beast. Thera’s body was scraped against several sets of teeth, and she was bloody and nearly unconscious by the time they reached the ground.
“A little, maybe, but you’ve also tied yourself in knots trying not to be, and you’re so angry with yourself I can practically taste it.”
“Malfoy, I hate to break this to you, but my opinions might be shit. I think I might be a judgmental wanker and a hypocrite. I basically murdered my own cat, I’ve been a right prick to all my friends, I’ve been sullen and moody as a teenager, and I’ve had to buy all new pillows because I keep setting mine on fire.”
Then they drove even further away from civilization, past sea-bleached rocks and white clapboard houses with laundry hanging from the lines. They heard gulls crying out overhead and everything smelled like salt. It was June, so the wildflowers were out in full force, a riot of blue and purple and pink and white and yellow, decorating every conceivable spot that wasn’t taken up by massive, random boulders. They drove through thick, moss-covered pine forests, further and further until Linda thought maybe Greg really had lost his mind and had purchased a house that was literally in the ocean.
She swiped at her face with her fingertips, wiping away some stray tears, and laughing raggedly. “That’s a stupid idea. You’re a moron,” she said without conviction.
“It’s not goodbye. I’ll still see you all the time. And after…maybe down the road…” Harry knew he was lying through his teeth. This
“Do I --? No, of course not. I’m really mad at you, though. And also, what about Charlie? You know he likes you, and you’ve been flirting with him.”
Then Harry was suddenly standing there, his boots kicking at the ground, his arms folded across his chest. “You’d better come back safe, Malfoy,” he said, giving him a shy smile. His eyes were bright as new leaves in the morning sunlight, his inky black eyelashes casting shadows over his face.
Draco sat down on the edge of the bed – his bed, Harry remembered, wondering if he ought to feel embarrassed for coming in here. It had made sense last night, when he was half asleep and the world was dark, but now, in the light of morning, he felt uncertain.
! Draco’s current mood was nonetheless noteworthy, because he’d never been this angry for a non-Potter-related reason before.
“I’m sure that had something to do with it,” Astoria said. “Losing my sister was a bit of a wakeup call. I want to live a life she’d be proud of, and part of that was coming clean about things, you know, living more authentically.”
“They’re not going to be taking on this monstrous, hyphenated name, so they shouldn’t have a vote, and besides, your children outnumber mine.”
,” said Malfoy, in a tone that was probably supposed to be a warning but wasn’t, not really. It sounded too breathless to be stern.
Harry pulled him to his feet, gently, and, still holding his hand, led him to the dance floor. When they reached it, Harry stopped to face him. “I’m a terrible dancer,” he said. His face was so close, his eyes wide and uncertain behind his glasses, and his hand was still warm around Draco’s.
“How can I help you?” asked the one with the hammer, looking up with a bland expression. The moment he saw Frankie’s face, he blanched, and then bolted upright and took off. Draco, who didn’t know exactly what was going on, knew enough to grab him by the shoulder and yank him back, and then put himself in front of the back door of the shop. He drew his sword, pointing it towards the man, who backed up slowly, hands raised. Thank Merlin he’d had some practice with the bloody thing, and thank Circe these men weren’t armed.
Aunt Bella looked at Draco and curled her lip. “Draco deserved it, you know,” she said. “That and worse. He betrayed
“Prophet’s going to run an Op Ed on Potter’s return. And I don’t know that it’s going to be a positive one.”
“I…shit, Harry, I dunno. Give me a while to think about it. We can’t all make life-changing decisions as quickly as you.”
Ginny looked up at her mum and her face screwed up like she was going to cry. “Oh, poor Harry,” she said.
“Malfoy. If he’s to be your boyfriend, I want to get to know him. I don’t want him avoiding me forever, because then you’ll be avoiding me, too. You and I are still going to be friends after this, Harry. We
Daphne stepped away from Blaise and stood, quaking a little, and nodded . “I don’t know the address or the coordinates. But I can apparate us there.”
He cast another warming spell over himself and then cast one over Potter as well. He squeezed his eyes shut and willed his body to relax, which, of course, only served to make it even more alert. If he could just sleep, it would be morning soon, and then he could get up and move. But his body wanted to move right now, wanted to look around, to explore. At least his brain had more sense than that.
“I had it done after my divorce. I realized I’d spent my whole life acting according to what was, supposedly, my ‘destiny’, and that I’d hated all of it. I decided I wasn’t going to do what was expected of me anymore. That I was going to live my life the way I wanted or some such rubbish. Hasn’t changed much of anything, honestly, except maybe how I look at things.”
Ron, who’d already asked Harry this question but was exceedingly concerned about it, asked a question about how Quidditch teams would be formed. They’d not found a perfect solution for this, honestly. Harry explained some of the options, such as a lottery system, or open tryouts. “And one thing we’ve concluded is that Hogwarts should have a school-wide team that competes against other schools. On the continent, they have the WSL, or the Wizarding School League, and we are looking into the possibility of joining." He saw people's skepticism turn to excitement here. It
“No, I do. I want this so much,” he said, feeling it everywhere, filling up his chest, making his head spin and his knees go weak.
Potter leapt off his chair and tugged at Draco’s hand, dragging him over to where the girls were piled up. They spread out, sticking their heads close to Mandy and Hermione’s heads, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh at Hermione, who was still giggling helplessly.
Hermione was quiet for a second, and then he heard her take a breath, clearly gearing up for a lecture. “That was ten years ago. He’s been married for nine. You’ve had god only knows how many boyfriends and girlfriends since. Surely you can get past all that and work together.”
Wednesday after work, he and Potter decided to go to the Leaky. It was the place where they were most likely to be seen, and it was casual enough that it wouldn’t automatically be interpreted as a date. But they would be there alone, and would sit at one of the little two-person tables to make it clear that they were there
Slowly, his sword at the ready, Berold turned the doorknob. Draco saw Dormond taking both his knives in hand, saw Frankie’s hand curl around her pommel. Draco gathered Sen again, which, he decided, was a much deadlier weapon – for him, at least.
“Oh, fuck,” he gasped, as he slid the dildo into himself. He let himself adjust and then fucked himself slowly and firmly, imagining Potter sneering down at him, calling him a whore, calling him a pervert, a desperate slut. “Yes,” he gasped.
“Yes, but you’re not eye-fucking me every time you talk to me. I’m not furiously jerking myself off the moment you walk out the door.”
Pansy and Draco selected a bottle of pink stuff – wine? mead? – that smelled like strawberries. They each took a sip and sighed. “Oh, this is delicious,” Draco said.
Another face, this one rather difficult to interpret. “He might’ve done. I went to Chicago to pitch the idea of running to him and ended up spending the day there.”
Potter grabbed his hips tightly. “Keep still, yeah?” He said, kissing over Draco’s hip and up to his stomach. Draco was having trouble understanding how Potter could be like this, so affectionate, adoring, even. He’d never pictured it like this, before it had happened. Not ever. But it was always like this. Soft, gentle, careful: the complete antithesis of everything else between them. “Just let me.”
“Yeah. Of course we were.” They had been, too. Never just friends, not really, but there was friendship between them, in addition to everything else. Harry genuinely liked Draco, liked his company. They’d become unthinkably close, so that Harry suspected Draco knew more about him than even Ron and Hermione.
on their faces. It was bright blue and smelled a bit like berries. “You have to wear this. It’s tradition,” Frankie said, stern-faced. “It’s sacred. It’s been blessed.”
It had been years – a decade – since she’d said more than a handful of polite words to him. Strange, that they’d once been so close. Even before they’d started shagging, they’d been friends – close friends. Her earliest childhood memories included Draco and Blaise. Vince and Greg had joined them later, and then Daphne and Millie in first year.  But at the start, it had been Draco and Blaise. And while Draco was still her closest friend, she felt like she didn’t know Blaise at all anymore. He was a stranger to her.
“That you need me to stay. That you want me to stay here with you, that you see this thing with us becoming something more.”
Draco had assumed that Granger would behave the same way as Potter, seeing as though they were bosom buddies, but she had been much more cordial. She was almost…pleasant, in fact, which was unnerving. But it also proved that this was Potter's problem, and not a general one. Really, Granger had more reason to hate him than Potter did, and if she could get over it, then surely he should’ve been able to.
Draco’d assigned nicknames to the most colorful characters aboard the yacht, all of them inappropriate (another thing he used to always do when they were young and on the campaign trail -- dole out nicknames left and right). Then he and Harry started making up stories about what they were saying to one another, about who was going to sleep with whom, things like that. And then, when they actually wound up talking to these people, and some of them happened to fall right in line with the stories they’d made up about them, it was endlessly funny. Draco and Harry had split up a bit at the end of the afternoon, chatting with different groups, and then on the walk back to Harry’s, they’d filled one another in on the rest of the gossip they’d collected.
Harry was teetering on the brink, ready to fall over the edge and holding himself back by pure force of will. His balls were so tight, his pleasure so overwhelming, he thought he might go mad. “Draco, I —,” he whispered, his hips shuddering as he tried to stave off his climax.
But when he poked his head into Draco’s office, it was empty. Harry walked inside with a sigh and closed the door behind him, collapsing into Draco’s chair. It smelled like Draco in here, that heady, expensive scent of bergamot and sage. Harry ran his hands over the supple leather of the armrests, up and over the smooth bronze nail heads that accented the piece.
Harry reached up and ripped off the locket, setting it on a large rock. “Ron, I’m going to open it, and when I do, you’ve got to hit it with the sword.”
“You still looked handsome enough like that,” she said, giving him a smirk. “But I must admit this is better.”
Draco was quiet for a moment, lost in memory. A terrible memory, of the day Edwin attacked him. “You couldn’t have known,” he said. “And anyway, what could you have done? Once you were there with him? There was nothing you could have done.”
He apparated to the edge of Diagon, which was only a few blocks away from the muggle hotel, and walked briskly to the closest muggle street. He felt eyes on his back, which was paranoid as fuck and probably a result of the unsettling memory, but he still glanced around behind him and took an indirect route to the hotel, weaving an extra block this way and that, entering a shop and exiting out the back entrance and circling back around.
A head of bright red hair poked around the corner. A lip curled. “Malfoy?” Ginevra Weasley began. “What in the fuck are you doing down here?”
Then he was taking Draco’s hand, and they twisted nauseatingly and were standing back at the gates of the school. Harry loved Hogwarts, had loved it since the first moment he’d seen it from across the lake, mysterious and beautiful, like something out of myth. But just now, he didn’t want to be there. He didn’t want to have this talk with Ginny (was rather dreading it). He didn’t want the presence of everyone else to ruin whatever it was that had grown between him and Draco over the last couple of days. He had no desire at all, really, to see any of them, not even Ron and Hermione. He only wanted to be back at the townhouse, or maybe strolling anonymous muggle streets with Draco. He sighed.
Draco was certain he reeked of mead and sweat, and he wasn’t sure about his breath at all. But he kissed Harry on the mouth anyway, just a peck. “Come on, then, you git. I need to cool off.” He stood and started walking towards the sea, aware that Harry’s eyes were on his bare arse.
“Stop,” Harry said, stepping close to him and grasping his wrist before he could reach for the t-shirt.
“We think it was maybe Dreamless Sleep?” said Millie. “Like maybe a lot? We’re not sure. He was unresponsive. Ron and Hermione called for Madam Pomfrey and she flooed him over to Mungo’s. He’s there now, still. We’re not allowed to see him yet, and we haven’t heard anything. So we don’t know…we don’t know.”
“Okay, that was a lie. I take back the refusing to kiss you part; your pout’s actually really cute, too,” Charlie said, kissing him again, and soon, Harry found he couldn’t think about Hermione or Ron anymore, because all he could think about was the feeling of Charlie’s mouth on his, and the thrill of desire low in his belly.
“I – “ Harry had never hooked up with a stranger. He’d never hooked up with any man besides Seamus, for Merlin’s sake. He didn’t know how he felt about it. In the past, he’d been of the opinion that feelings ought to be involved when it came to sex, but was that still his feeling about it? He’d had sex with Seamus, after all.
“Yes, I’m aware. You’ve only been ditching me on Fridays for five years,” she said, rolling her eyes. “Merlin forbid you skip one fucking pub night, but anyway. I was talking about
“This was a really fun weekend,” Harry said. “Can we maybe do this every weekend? Or will your mum kick me out on my arse?”
. That was the understatement of the century. Being possessed by a fucking demon was a bit more than a flaw.
This whole system was stupid, Draco decided. The sorting. The houses in general. They ought to all just be together. Everything would be so much easier. It was so stupid, and he was about to lose the fragile, tentative friendship he’d formed with Potter because some moron decided it was a good idea to let a bloody
Seamus looked at Harry for a moment before collapsing into a fit of laughter. “Sure, Harry,” he said.
Being William’s unofficial ambassador to the Ethereans (and to many of the noble houses as well) meant that Draco had to pick his battles, and arguing semantics with Kerrick wasn’t a worthwhile one.
Harry quickly unbuckled it and tossed it aside. What kind of absolute monster had laid claim to Stormy and called her
He walked to the window and looked out onto the busy, sun-drenched street below, fighting the urge to be sick. Today’s hangover potion must’ve been expired, he told himself. He’d have to get some fresh bottles.
Gelou Castle was something out of a fairytale. Horror story. Whatever. It was up in the mountains, perched on a cliffside like a hawk waiting to strike. It was hidden from muggles and had been owned by wizards continually since it’s construction: a single family had lived there from the time it was built until the 1600’s, when it changed hands, and then a second family had owned it until the early part of the 20
That was in February. From February until June, Cassius got into the habit of finding Draco alone and pushing him into a toilet or a quiet hallway or his own room, when it was empty. They rarely spoke, and they didn’t ever kiss. Draco tried once, and Cassius pushed him away. “I’m not a fucking pouf,” he remembered Cassius saying in his low, precise voice. They did, however, graduate from hand jobs to blowjobs, and then from blowjobs to fucking.
Harry gulped. He supposed on some level, he knew that. He’d known that’s where Voldemort’s reign of terror was leading. But things like eliminating exemptions to the Statute of Secrecy seemed so
“Ugh, that cow. She’s the one who got you into this mess, don’t you dare compare me to her.” Pansy put her hands on Draco’s cheeks and kissed him quickly on the nose. “It’s because your face is so gorgeous. Makes it fun to play with.”
As they were leaving, Harry realized Draco probably didn’t have anything to pay with if they were going to a muggle area. “I have some muggle bank notes up in my suitcase,” Harry said. “I can get them before we go.”
That night, as Draco was making spaghetti sauce on his stovetop, the Barred Owl tapped on his window. Draco hurried over to let it in and untied the message from its leg.
Pansy was whispering into his ear, and then suddenly, there was a hand on his hip, and the guy was there, taking up his space, looking him over hungrily. They didn’t try to speak over the loud music, just began to move together. Draco had done this dance – in the literal and figurative sense – so many times before that it was a bit like getting onto a bicycle after not having ridden in a couple of years. He knew how this went, and if he wanted to, he could be balls-deep in this bloke in the loo in mere minutes.
“That’s a load of bollocks,” Ron said. “You can’t possibly have anything to do that’s so urgent you can’t do it next week. And I
He looked back down at Draco, who had his eyes closed now, one hand on Charlie’s shaft and the other palming his own hard cock. He was kneeling between Charlie’s legs, his lovely arse up in the air. Harry crawled over to him and tugged at him for a moment, and his mouth made a pop as he pulled it off Charlie’s cock to kiss Harry wetly, and then Harry brought his own mouth down to suck Charlie for a moment and Charlie cried out, and then Harry kissed Draco again, messy, the taste of Charlie’s precome on both their tongues.
“Give me your hand,” Draco said, making his voice as authoritative as possible. He wanted to do it fast before Potter could ask any questions.
“Yes, I do believe it’s the first. Unless you count the time you refused to shake my hand on the train, or that detention in the Forbidden Forest.”
Harry wound up kissing Cian near the fire escape. Cian was an excellent kisser, in Harry’s opinion anyway, and Merlin knew he was aching to be touched at this point in the evening. Only, he found that, despite Cian’s soft lips and eager hands, his thoughts kept returning to Draco. If Harry’d kept his stupid mouth shut, they might’ve kissed, and then…and then…
“Well, Harry’s approval ratings have been high all along, but this seems to have given him a bump. I’ve been looking at the comments on the Prophet’s website, as well as some discussion boards and the few think pieces that people have written about it, and the general consensus is that Harry is a hero and a very eligible bachelor, and people are happy to see him, how should I put it…sowing his wild oats.”
Draco probably wouldn't believe, excpet this was Hermione. Of course she'd done it. "That’s really so impressive. I hope the rest of Mysteries knows what you’ve done. You’ll probably be promoted for this. They’ll probably let you out of the Pen,” he said, grinning at her. For once, he didn’t feel jealous. He felt proud of her, for what she’d managed with only books and the usual magical ability. She really was the cleverest witch he knew. And he couldn’t hold that against her, especially not when it had brought her and Harry here.
know that. No matter what you do, I'll always love you with all my heart. I'll always be rooting for you.”
“Sure,” he said, kissing her. She grinned and collected some pajamas and walked back with him, holding his hand. And then they’d opened the door, and there was Draco, sitting on the floor against his bed, and he turned, smiling tightly, and then saw Ginny and Harry. Harry knew the exact moment Draco saw their joined hands, because all the color drained from his face.
Draco felt his chest tighten. Oh, fuck, that sounded awful. Heights were not his forte, nor was bravery for that matter. But Charlie had taunted him, and that could not stand.
Finally, Draco was moving, and then Harry felt the tip of his cock at his entrance and he wanted it so badly. Draco began to push in slow, but Harry pushed back hungrily, and Draco groaned behind him and stilled for a moment. “Fuck,” Draco hissed. “Hang on. Fucking hell, Harry.”
Well, that was probably a lie. He had a hair-trigger temper, according to his mother, and, according to Pansy, he was the king of strop-throwing. He was sure they were exaggerating, but he could, admittedly, get worked up about certain things.
He felt an urge to glance up then, to look at the lovely figures of light. The music was still all around him, calling to him, but he knew, somehow, that if he looked at them, it was all over.
. He didn’t tell me anything about this. And even if he had, we’d already had our talk when he saw Cassius, so it wouldn’t have mattered.”
“Stop looking so afraid, Lucius. It’s not him I’m interested in at the moment. Where is Harry Potter?”
“Potter, yes. And you. This thing between us hasn’t been healthy, has it? And what you’re offering me isn’t all that healthy either. I don’t know what to think.”
He made a sandwich for lunch and took a little nap out on the back patio, his body feeling deliciously warm and languorous in the sunlight. When he woke, he decided to go for a walk down the lane that led to his house. There were only a couple other houses nearby, and he knew his neighbors a bit, although not well. Well enough to chat with them for a couple minutes, though, which, for some reason, he felt like doing today. He was in a weirdly good mood and had the urge to be friendly. But nobody was outside, so he looked up at the drifting white clouds and thought about Euri.
Suddenly, there was an explosion. Draco was thrown backwards down the stairs, and he watched in shock as the house shook and creaked and the sound of things falling and shattering filled the air. Plaster rained down from the ceiling onto his face. “Oh, Merlin,” he whispered, scrambling to get to his feet. He went and stood in front of the stairs, afraid that they might not be sturdy anymore. He glanced up; the stairs seemed to be intact. He cautiously stepped onto the bottom one.
A little grin, a spark burning behind those gray eyes. “Why not? I like their clothes and their internet cafes. Might as well try their food, too.”
“Oh, I’m aware. I’ve been on the receiving end of plenty of not-so-complimentary observations from you.”
Harry almost blurted out that Malfoy was gay, because he desperately wanted to ask if Seamus thought Malfoy was fit, or whether it was just Harry who thought so, but thankfully, he remembered in time that it was not his secret to tell. “Yeah, I know.” Harry was quiet for a moment and then said, “Hey, maybe you and I should date.”
Charlie settled back down and pulled Harry over towards him so that Harry’s head was on his chest, right by the Hebridean Black’s snout. He kissed Harry’s hair. “Honestly, I never thought it’d be
“What the hell?” Harry asked. “You went through the same war I did. Why wasn’t that too close to home for you?”
Thankfully, by interrogating Yuri and Nott and some of the other key players, the Aurors were able to stop most of the planned attacks on muggles. Two dozen witches and wizards were in Auror custody, and the Auror force was hunting down dozens more. The plans had been large-scale ones, and many, many people were implicated in one way or another, including Draco’s father. Harry had no idea whether Lucius had really been involved or not, but it wouldn’t surprise him in the least. None of this ought to surprise him. He felt stupid for not having expected it from the beginning.
Draco's determined to get to the bottom of things. He also needs to focus on his campaign. It's totally possible to do both, right?
He took a deep breath and rubbed at the nape of his neck. He ought to tell Astoria he was home. He didn’t much want to see her, but he didn’t want to surprise the hell out of her, either.
The crowd was still massive, mothers and fathers and little siblings and familiars everywhere. Draco spotted a gaggle of Weasleys further down the platform. He squinted, and there, in their midst, was a familiar, disheveled dark head. Shit, they’d already got to him. How was that possible? Had Weasley put a tracker on him?
Pansy returned with coffee and Draco took a long, fortifying sip of his, and then a took deep breath and set out all the information he’d uncovered so far. Pansy, who hardly ever took anything seriously, surprised Harry by pulling out a notebook and scribbling down multiple pages of notes. When she finished, Draco took it and looked it over, Harry peering over his shoulder.
Potter looked at her wide-eyed for a moment before glancing around the room. “Alright, ah. Padma. Truth or dare.”
"Get off of there, you wanker! You’re going to get yourself killed!” Draco yelled. Mustering every ounce of courage he had, which wasn’t all that much, Draco charged. He had no real plan and ended up bouncing off of the troll’s sticky body, but before he fell, he managed to kick hard as he could at the troll's knees (where the knees ought to be, anyway; it was sort of hard to tell).
Harry had moved his arm up to the back of the couch after touching Malfoy’s tattoo, just because it had felt like a little too much, maybe, to have Malfoy’s bare skin under his fingertips, and his arm was still resting up there. Suddenly Malfoy grabbed it and took Harry’s hand in both of his and looked at his palm. “Fuck’s sake, you have callouses for days, Potter.”
Lawrence talked business with Harry before launching into a blatant romantic proposition, which seemed like it was not a new occurrence, given Harry’s laughter and insistence that Lawrence fuck off.
Unfortunately, there was problem number two. If he danced Harry down the primrose path that led to his pants, Harry would probably go willingly, but he would be upset afterward. Because whatever Harry might feel for Draco, he was
Potter was already waiting for him when he stepped through. “I didn’t know where you were,” he said. “But I warmed up one of the meals the house elf left. If you’re hungry.”
Draco was stomping, not paying attention to where he was going. Not that it mattered. It wasn’t like they had a map or anything useful that could tell them how to get out of this godforsaken forest. He was going to die here, alone, and furious at Potter. Wonderful. Just wonderful.
Charlie poured them all a glass of tuica and they sat down around the kitchen table and told Harry all about their day. Draco was in a ridiculously good mood, all smiles, chatty with not only Harry, but Charlie, too. Harry reached under the table and squeezed Charlie’s leg in a silent ‘thank you’ and Charlie patted his hand and kept talking to Draco.
“No, I know,” Pansy said. She glanced at her watch. “Well, I’ve got to get to work. And I’m sure you’ve got to get going, kiss more babies and shake more hands, and whatever it is you do all day. But let’s think about Blaise and Daphne, okay? Let’s see if we can’t figure out who wanted them to get married, and why.”
“There was no other option for me,” he said. “There was never going to be any other outcome. It’s Harry, Pans. It’s always been Harry.”
Then they’d sort of passed out in a naked, sticky heap, and Harry had woken up with a banging headache, holding her. “Fuck,” he’d whispered under his breath, because he had
“No. Can’t,” Harry said. He could almost feel his armor slipping into place, little hard pieces of protection growing over his skin. “I’ve got a lot to do today.” That was sort of true. He had plans, but nothing he couldn’t cancel. But Draco didn’t need to know that.
him, he was going to hand himself over. It wasn’t even a question of whether he would; it was more a question of degree. Because the more of himself he gave, the more this was going to come and bite him in the arse when all was said and done.
He felt like he was falling, slipping, losing control. It felt awful, sickening. He needed something to grab hold of.
With one more glare, the best he could manage, he yanked open one of the double doors that led back into the Manor and let it slam behind him and stomped through to the front.
Draco let him lift off his jumper and t-shirt, and then let him take off his shoes and socks and slide down his trousers. “Oh,” Harry said.
He grabbed his bedside bin just in time and heaved into it until there was nothing left in his stomach. He wiped his mouth and sat there, staring at the moon that had settled right at the center of his window. It was a pale sliver, a new moon, and its color reminded him of the hand on his chest.
“So where are the goats?” Draco asked, looking around as though they might materialize. The town was nicer than Gogg had been, the houses well-maintained and made mostly out of stone and brick. And there was a distinct lack of animal pens and smells.
“Dunno,” Harry said, leaning towards him and skimming his hand along the front of the sheer shirt, making Draco shiver a little. “You might have to ply me with free shots first.”
“It’s okay,” Harry said, petting his hair and talking to him like he would a scared animal. “It’s fine. Nobody else was here, this was…it’s okay. It wasn’t your fault. It’s – Celestina Warbeck’s fault.”
When Pansy started sticking her tongue down some poor bloke’s throat, Draco and Hermione decided it was time for a water break.
It was in this way that he came to have seven cats by the time he realized the extent of his cat problem, although, in his defense,  they were ‘his’ to varying degrees.
It was a blur then, for a while, Draco nearly taking a sword to the head, the chest, the waist. There were so many close calls, and he wasn’t getting in any good swings. He was too busy defending himself from the onslaught.  The man was strong, and relentless, but he wasn’t very quick. Draco was quick; that was a good thing. Maybe he could use that. And he was clever, while this man seemed a bit like Greg Goyle, or maybe Pike: determined and strong, but not exactly the brightest.
He stuck his hands in his pockets and tried not to scrunch. “Is Draco in there? I just wanted to wish him luck, see if he needs anything.”
“I want you so much,” he whispered, kissing along Harry’s jaw. There was stubble there, much thicker than his own, and he was certain his face was going to be an irritated mess afterward, but he didn’t care in the slightest.
“Understandable,” said Ari, sitting back down. He was an incredibly attractive guy, probably in his late twenties or early thirties, but he did not look like the typical campaign consultant. He was wearing a black and white plaid suit over a black shirt, and had black loafers on his feet, no socks. He had head of light blond hair, almost as light as Draco’s, but it was incredibly curly instead of stick-straight. He had a high-cheekboned face and dark blue eyes. Overall, he was quite a snack. If you were into men, which, obviously, Draco, being faithfully married to a woman for ten years, was not.
Draco considered this. Let his mind go to a place he’d never allowed it to go before. What if, all those years ago, Potter had shaken his hand on the train? What if they
He watched as Malfoy explored, the end of his wand lit up, illuminating all the dark corners of the room. “It’s like a crypt in here, Potter,” he huffed, stopping to open some of the heavy brocade curtains to let in the last vestiges of evening light.
of control, because that kind of confidence was sexy as hell and it was turning him on more than a little bit.
Everyone around him seemed so slow, and he felt so very, very quick, and, as he opened himself to them, and watched their eyes, he knew what they were going to do before they did it. He could sense it and see it and he simply
At half past two, there was a knock on his door. Unspeakable Lewis, most likely, checking on Draco’s progress.
He could hardly breathe as Potter lined up his cock, teasing. Draco shuddered every time it passed over his hole, and he could feel himself fluttering in anticipation, already so loose and wet from Potter’s fingers and his tongue. “Do it,” he hissed.
, hm? I can just picture it now, the two of us, actual functioning people, living lives that we don’t despise! If I’d have known a few rounds with a Mind Healer and abstention from fucking would do it, then I would have –”
“You can stay here for now,” Draco whispered as he walked Michael into one of the crypts. Strangely, it wasn’t frightening to be here. This was his family, his heritage. This was where he would be someday, where his bones would rest when the brief flash of his life was done.
“False!” Draco cried, shoving at Potter’s shoulder and then immediately grabbing him lest he topple over. “If there is a tease among us, it’s you.”
“I know my opinion doesn’t count for much. Seeing as I’m a Death Eater and all. But I wouldn’t think it was weird.”
“Berold, old friend, well met,” Kerrick said, his unnerving eyes flickering over Frankie and Draco. The rings of his eyes weren’t subtle like Lia’s, but starkly defined and strange-looking. “I see you have brought me one of my own.”
“Wow,” said Pansy. “Harry Potter, my god. Never knew you had it in you. Or at least, I never knew you’d had so
Merlin knew Harry’d tried. He’d tried to corner Draco after meetings, tried to get him to grab drinks in the evenings, even sought him out one day in Woad Hall, only to have Draco’s assistant tell him that Draco was out of the office for a lunch meeting. Draco’d scared Harry off of sending any texts besides those related strictly to the campaign, and he’d never really emailed Draco much anyway.
“You always were a moody little bastard,” Charlie said fondly. He patted Harry’s arm. “Seriously, you okay?”
During negroni number four, Pansy confided in Harry that Ronald had nearly kissed her in May. Harry had a heart attack or two and then asked her what the fuck she was talking about, and Pansy said nothing had happened, they both backed off in time. Harry said he needed to talk to ‘Ronald’ and maybe punch him in the face. Pansy said not to punch Ronald. She said it was her fault, because she regularly did this, because she was a horrible, dirty homewrecker and chased after married men. Harry told her that was fucked up and she agreed. He then told her it took two to tango, and he was definitely punching Ron. Probably.
Evan laughed. “So, like, after that, I was thinking maybe you guys could take turns on me? Like, fucking me? That would be so hot. I’d really like that. Or, you know, I could –”
Draco closed his eyes again and tried to relax and clear his mind and focus on the words. He murmured them in a soft but decisive voice, taking pains to emphasize the proper syllables. There was a sudden pain at his temples, a burst of headache, but he continued to speak in the same tone.
Ron shrugged, his thumb still moving. Harry was getting hard now, despite his advanced levels of intoxication, and his mind was scrambling, but it felt like it was moving underwater. Thoughts came with difficulty, and much too slowly.
“Considering Ron had his tongue down Pansy Parkinson’s throat when I came outside, I think he won’t even notice. She’s a stone-cold fox, isn’t she? Pansy, I mean. Don’t know what she’s doing kissing Ron. But
To get to it, you had to slip into a little alley that looked like it dead-ended immediately, and walk through the wall at the end, much like the wall that led to Platform 9 3/4 . On the other side, you’d find yourself staring at the hostess stand.
. They might like you, or they might just think you have a nice arse. Hell, they might just be bored. And even if they start fucking you regularly, you still don’t know. And they never bloody talk about it, either. If you want to have a conversation about what’s going on, you have to bring it up. And half of them are completely afraid of commitment.”
“What did a happy ending even mean in real life, anyway? In stories you simply said, 'They lived happily ever after,' and that was it. But in real life people had to keep on living, day after day, year after year.”
Blaise sneered. Draco didn’t like that look. It meant Blaise was about to say something dickish. “You think Harry Potter’s going to be your forever-boyfriend? You think he’ll love you and settle down with you? Please, Draco. Take some advice from someone in his position – it’s
new, and then thinking how strange it was that Ginny didn’t know everything about his life anymore. There had been a time when she knew every little thing he did, from switching toothpastes to scraping his elbow. Now she didn’t even know he had four new cats.
Charlie pushed Harry's hair away from his face and settled his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Come back inside, then. Stop moping.”
He looked first at the Auror table; he couldn’t help it. Potter didn’t seem to be there and Draco didn’t know if that made him feel relieved or not. “Hermione,” he whispered. “Is Ron coming tonight?”
Charlie came soon after, and as he came he dug his nails into Harry’s scalp a little, and Harry shivered in the aftermath of his own climax at that small, sharp pressure, and he pulled Charlie against him when it was over, holding him close, their damp chests pressed together, their breathing gradually becoming steadier.
Pike blinked at it for a minute before sitting up and pulling Draco into a tight embrace. “Thank you. Truly, thank you,” he said, sounding emotional. “Thought I would never pick up a sword again.”
But then, one evening, Draco’d arrived on her parents’ doorstep, looking like he’d just won a billion Galleons, and told her that Potter had called it off with Ginevra. That he’d actually called it off with her several months earlier, and had assumed Draco had known, only Draco hadn’t known until earlier that day, when they’d talked.
Draco looked a little nervous and started doing the things he’d done at his apartment: running his hands over Dominic and speaking softly into his ear, smiling too much, and generally behaving in a non-Draco-ish manner. Even Hermione looked puzzled by this display. Luna was gone already, dancing with a few girls close to the D.J.
She swiped at her eyes. “Right,” she said, shaking herself as if to clear her head before heading towards the girls’ stairwell. “Goodnight,” she called.
, and Draco felt himself flushing and aching in response. “Touch me, Harry,” he whispered. Merlin, he needed to be touched so badly, wanted Harry’s hands on him so much it hurt.
Draco grinned at Harry for a moment before lifting up his bowl of Coco Puffs and moving to sit next to Hermione at one of the crowded, circular tables.
Harry walked in and looked around, appearing as nervous as Draco felt. He ran a hand through his already messy hair, and afterward, it looked a bit like he’d been electrocuted. “Can we talk?” he asked.
Harry had always spent Easter hols at school. They’d always had plenty of studying to do around that time, not to mention Quidditch to practice. But this year, he didn’t have to worry about Quidditch, and he didn’t have final exams in his courses this year, either. Instead, they would be preparing for their NEWTs all spring, which took place in the summer. “Not sure,” he said. “Probably.”
His thoughts were interrupted by a jingle at the door. “Hogwarts, dear?” he heard Madam Malkin say. “Got the lot here – another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”
Alexander stayed for four days, all of them spent by William’s side. By the time the third evening rolled around he and William were sipping from one another’s cups and Alexander was pressing little pieces of fruit to William’s lips and William was biting down on them carefully, his eyes on Alexander’s dark, liquid ones.
Finally, when Draco’s breathing had returned to normal, he peeked back around towards the waterfall. Potter was gone, the spot empty.
“No,” he said, shaking his head even as he felt a fresh rush of anxiety sweeping over him. He wanted to do this. He wanted to look Astoria in the eye when the truth finally came spilling from her lips, no matter how much it might hurt. “I’ll do it.”
Harry tried to get his laughter under control and pay attention. Draco was a good teacher, of course, and soon he had the basic steps down. The song ended and Draco flicked his wand towards the Wireless and it started over. It made Harry feel warm inside, because it was something Molly Weasley always did when Celestina came on. “You’re just like Molly Weasley,” Harry said.
Harry looked at him like he had three heads, but then Snape was up at the front giving a brief lecture on Shrinking Solution. Afterwards, they all went about organizing and preparing their ingredients, and the hum of quietly murmured conversation began to fill the room.
Harry shook his head. “Not about the recent stuff. They’re friends with Astoria. I think…I don’t know how they’d take it. They’d probably be all disappointed in me. Hermione definitely would be. Ron, maybe. I dunno.”
Draco hadn’t noticed, but it made sense. The enemy’s victories were bad for morale. “Are you able to help me?” he asked, realizing that they’d gone on several tangents, none of which addressed the reason he was actually here. “Can you teach me how to create a Sacred Door?”
“I know, I know.” The man looked at Draco again and grinned. Draco could see the flash of a gold tooth in the semi-darkness. “Not bad to look at, is he. Let’s see the rear.” He ran a hand down Draco’s arse and Draco fixed him with a glare that only made the man’s smile widen. Salazar, he hated being powerless. It felt like being at the Manor during the war all over again. He had no wand, and although he wasn’t skinny and noodley anymore, he wasn’t exactly a body builder. He considered trying to fight his way out of the man's grip and decided immediately against it. There were three of them and only one of him. It would never work.
Harry’s hands immediately flew to the buttons of Malfoy’s white dress shirt, which was now see-through, pink nipples clearly visible through wet fabric. He would bite them when the shirt was off. He would bite them and suck them and clench them in his teeth until they bled, until they popped right off into Harry’s mouth…
“She’s lovely.” Draco ran a finger along the bars of the cage. Draco liked owls in general, but this one really was gorgeous, full of fluffy, snow-white feathers. “Come on, we’re this way.”
Draco’s mouth was on his again for a moment, slow and lingering, his tongue hot and wet in Harry’s mouth. He tasted so good, and he felt so good, and it was Draco kissing him, Draco naked on top of him, Draco asking to be fucked. Harry wanted him so much it hurt.
“Okay, that was a lie,” Harry said quietly. “But fuck you. You can’t act sad. You can’t act like this now, after everything.”
“Yes, Majesty,” Berold said, standing and making his way to Harry and Hermione. He gave Harry a pat on the back and took a bag from Hermione and led them out of the room.
“Harry, Draco, come on,” Frankie said from behind him. They turned and saw that she was panting and bloody, her eyes fierce.
Draco reeled in the sensation, the relentless drag of Harry’s lips and his tongue and his cheeks as he hollowed them out. Soon, Draco found himself writhing and groaning beneath him, felt tension begin to gather in his groin, felt his balls tighten. “Harry,” he managed. “I want to kiss you.” He did, and also, he didn’t want to come already, not when he hadn’t gotten to touch Harry yet.
Before he could say anything else, Harry was opening his robes and pulling at his flies. “Harry!” he whispered frantically. “Anybody could catch us!”
Charlie helped Draco up (he seemed okay now, and Harry suspected he was likely milking this for all it was worth) and they all walked to the kitchen and ate a subdued supper.
“Alright, brilliant. Yeah. Thanks,” he said, taking it. He pulled it on over his head. “Good?” he asked.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at the way he didn’t even respond to Harry’s insult. “Fucking hell, Malfoy, you’re such a twat.” Malfoy chuckled too, briefly, and then they looked at each other for a long, expectant moment. “Are you having a nice birthday, then?”
Harry was alive, or at least, he seemed alive. He was warm-ish. Not all that warm, but not ice cold. And his limbs were soft, malleable.
Harry could use a cup of tea this time. Something, anything, to calm his nerves. “Thanks,” he said, as Draco hurried off.
That night before bed, he searched over the entire property with his wand again for Stormy. She had been there at lunch, he knew that, but he didn’t know that he’d seen her since. Where on earth did she get off to when she was away? He thought of how she might get attacked by a fox or even an owl (although not Malfoy’s owl, because it was so ridiculously small). He decided to take a walk down the lane that led to his house, but it was dark even in the moonlight, and he didn’t want to be waving his wand around in front of muggles. As it was, he saw nothing, no flash of her golden eyes anywhere.
Just then, the front door burst open. “Xenophilius!” came a gruff voice that Draco immediately recognized.
Daphne gave him a look. “I’m not all that close to Euri, but I’m quite close to Lyris and Ari, and neither of them is especially forthright. They tell lots of half-lies, at least, and the occasional actual lie. The Fastbrooks are all Slytherins, Harry. Don’t forget that.”
Harry took his hand and brought it to his mouth and kissed his palm with his soft lips. Fuck, this certainly felt like love. Didn’t it? It didn’t just feel like lust, or some silly fling.
sorry about Harry,” she said softly. “I really thought that he…” She shook her head. “Never expected him to behave like he did, that’s for certain.”
. I couldn’t stay there while they plotted against you. And I couldn’t stomach the thought of you going off on your own. You would have been all alone…”
Then Harry was on top of Malfoy, pressed against him. And he realized that was where he wanted to be all along.
The Greengrass girls were so alike, Draco thought, looking at them together. Exepting the color of their hair – Daphne was blond while Astoria was a brunette – they were remarkably similar. Same shine and thickness to their hair, despite the different colors; same wide blue eyes; same heart-shaped faces; same expressions; same way of speaking; same tinkling laugh; same slender builds; same long legs and small ankles.
“At first, I really did want to, because you’re great in bed, Harry. But then, I was mostly just checking, to see where your head was, regarding Draco.”
Sunday night, Harry went to bed thinking about Draco, thinking of all the things that had happened over the weekend.
“What’s wrong, then?” Now that Astoria thought about it, Daphne had seemed rather off lately. Astoria had been too overwhelmed by her own problems to think too much about it, but she
“When you didn’t want to sleep in here,” Harry said, understanding washing over his face. “That’s why you didn’t want to sleep in here.”
. James says they’re just friends, but oh my gosh, they so clearly like each other. It’s quite cute. You ought to ask him about her.”
Pansy’s door was unlocked so Harry let himself in, and was quite surprised when Blaise Zabini was the first person to greet him. “Oh, hey, Blaise. I didn’t realize you were still here, too.”
He drank his Dreamless and fell into bed, his ears filling up with static. As he drifted off, he felt it nearby, felt its breath on his neck.
He was sweating by the time that cage came down, and he ran over to Harry, spelling open the door to the cage, threading his arms around Harry’s waist and pulling him out to look at him, while Berold ran to William.
The man smiled. “Yeah, he is, I think. Free. The thing that’s holding him, he wants it to be there. He wants to be trapped. The thing, by the way, is meant to represent Achilles.”
Draco’s mouth caught his, hot and demanding, and Harry let himself be kissed, let himself be pushed down onto the rug behind the loveseat, where they didn’t have to deal with Stormy blinking at them the whole time.
Harry was wearing his old work jeans and a flannel shirt and gardening shoes. “Sorry I didn’t dress for the occasion, Malfoy, but I happened to be in the garden when your son popped into my yard. Apparating without a license and using an illegal map, from the sound of things.”
He was in the secret room below the drawing room, the place where prisoners were kept, and he was sitting in half an inch of cold water, and everything hurt. He looked down and saw shackles around his ankles, heavy chains wrapped around a stone pillar. He was clutching the Time-Turner in one trembling, white hand.
Draco really did love the prat to an embarrassing degree. He was just so…ugh. Irritating and wonderful, sweet and feisty, and sexy as fuck, too. Even now, just lying beside him, feeling his warmth, looking at his dark eyelashes against his cheeks, at his soft, pink mouth…Draco half wished he could wake him right back up with a mouth on his cock (which was every bit as drool worthy as Draco’d told Pansy).
“Ugh, leave me alone. I already have enough people hounding me about being single. I don’t need it from you, too,” said Malfoy.
Draco donned his tuxedo and fixed his hair, spelling it to stay out once he had it where he wanted it. He made a point to specify on the invites every year that attire was to be black-tie and non-mag. This wasn’t his parents’ Christmas party, after all.
He made his way to the Slytherin Common Room and tried to relax. Pansy was there, and she begged him to play a round of chess with her. She was very good; usually one of his favorite people to play with. But he couldn’t focus, and she beat him much too quickly.
Their hands shifted slightly, the grip softening, and Draco let go of one so that he could touch Potter’s cheek. Gently, the way that Potter had been touching him when he’d thought Draco was asleep. Potter closed his eyes and leaned into it. “Look at me,” Draco said, his voice low and rough. “Please.”
Draco found himself yawning. “Yeah, sure,” he said. He still didn’t know if he could sleep or not. But when he curled up against Harry, he felt exhaustion kicking in. Harry began to rub slow circles across his back, and his thoughts began to wander and chase themselves. Just before sleep took him, he felt Harry press a soft kiss to his forehead.
The door swung open again and a familiar, handsome face appeared. “Hello Ronniekins, hello Gin-Gin. Hello Malfoy-Person.”
Harry gave a little, low growl and nipped at Ari’s bottom lip before turning away towards the bar. He could feel Ari’s eyes on him, and it felt good. Being wanted always felt
It was late when the group arrived back at Hogwarts. Draco and Harry unpacked and showered – Draco insisted that they were filthy from travel and forced Harry to take one, and not with him, either, much to Harry’s disappointment – and climbed into Harry’s bed. They were so exhausted that, for the first time since that initial night together in New York, they simply snuggled up (Harry was the big spoon) and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
Soon they were both slowly making their way down a set of stairs. Draco tightened his grip on his man’s wrists. He and the woman eyed each other warily. Every single cell in Draco’s body was coiled tight, waiting for something to happen, for the woman or the man to strike. He wished to fuck he could do some wandless magic, so he could show them a taste of power, get them good and intimidated so they’d stay still. The woman’s eyes kept darting around the room and it was unsettling him. Draco took one hand off the man’s wrist to grip the pommel of his sword where it was sheathed at his waist. At least he was armed, and at least he sort of knew what to do with the bloody thing.
Potter pulled off his button-up shirt, leaving him in a white t-shirt that clung to his chest and arms. Draco tried not to stare. He took the button-up and tied it up around his head so it protected his ears. He probably looked like a complete wanker, but there was nothing to be done for it.
“Not a problem. Much better than lying there listening to you trying to wake up Weasel, which would’ve taken for-fucking-ever. You can’t imagine – or, you probably can, I guess – how many times that git hits the snooze on his alarm in the mornings.”
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s back, and pulled him close. They were kissing softly now, and Harry seemed to be trembling. Draco pulled back slightly to look at him, to ask, again, what had happened, but Harry brought their lips back together immediately.
Potter let out a long breath, and Draco realized he had been nervous to ask. “Worried about propriety now, Potter? After you invaded my house twice and kicked out my date?”
But he couldn’t think that far ahead, not for long, or he’d start to feel sick. For now, they had to focus on getting to the sea without being detected by Queensguard.
The stable boy, who looked to be fairly in awe of William, cleared his throat. “Out on the fields, Lord Commander. A mock battle began a while ago.”
He’d told Potter that tomorrow he was planning to sleep alone because he wanted to see if he could. And that was partially true. Draco had stopped to worry, every now and then, about what would happen if Potter up and decided to get a girlfriend (or boyfriend). Would Draco simply never sleep again? It was dangerous to depend on someone this way; you were just setting yourself up to get hurt. So it had occurred to him that he should try sleeping alone periodically to make sure he didn’t get
Maybe they could see Teddy again, too. It was clear that Harry missed him. Maybe it would be a nice weekend, and not tense and uncomfortable. Maybe…
“Why were you so adamant about it, though?” asked Hermione. “Why not set a time for Euri to meet them? You could have scheduled it out a month or so, that probably would’ve been fine. It sounds like he just didn’t like that it hadn’t even been talked about.”
You lean against the sink and try not to cry. Honestly, fuck him. He’s an arsehole, and all your friends are wrong. He’s not changed. He’s just gotten
“Wait, stop,” Draco huffed when they got to the top of the hill. One of many, many hills. He got off his bike and bent over, gasping. “I need a break. Oh my god, I hate you so much, Harry.”
Harry knew he didn’t have a posh accent like Draco. He knew he didn’t carry himself or sound like a boarding-school brat. “Yeah,” he said, standing up straighter, challenging Dominic to say anything more about it.
It was just that the things Draco was saying were things he never thought he’d hear. He couldn’t actually believe he
Harry crossed his arms over his chest and looked around, spotting Pansy and Sarah behind him. They waved, and he shot them a questioning look. Pansy shrugged, looking as confused as he felt. He wished he could go sit with them, but staff and family was supposed to be sitting towards the front.
In the barracks, Frankie and a couple of the other girls were working through the mass of men and putting…
“I wasn’t going to sleep in wool trousers, for fuck’s sake,” Draco said, facing away from him. It was even harder to get warm now than it had been earlier. He was chilled to the bone, thanks to his romp through the lake. He sighed, and tried to still his shivering limbs.
Ron seemed exceptionally pleased by this turn of events, although Hermione looked worried, which worried Harry, because Hermione had much better sense than Ron. All the former Gryffindors, including Dean, seemed happy to see them sitting together, and all of them had always loved Ginny, so it seemed so simple, all of it clicking back into place.
, the sun rose and he fell asleep for a short while. When he woke up, probably an hour later, he slipped past Blaise’s closed curtains, and went for a walk around the frozen lake, and it had cleared his head a bit, and the sun made everything seem a little less horrible.
Which begged the question: what was Draco doing feeling so tender and vulnerable over Harry Potter, who had clearly moved on? Potter had at least three stunningly attractive partners and an enviable life as some sort of wealthy playboy. He spent his days on boats and meeting his beautiful friends out for dinner and going clubbing, for Salazar’s sake. He probably looked at Draco and thought him old and staid. Just look at how the two of them had behaved all morning: Potter was lounging around comfortably in a t-shirt and shorts, gorgeous golden skin on display, not a care in the world, while Draco was buttoned up into a fucking suit on a Saturday, feeling like he could hardly breathe around his anxiety.
Sometimes she thought about how things had changed as they’d gotten older, as they’d settled into their own lives and their own families. And yet, seeing Daphne never failed to make Astoria feel like a girl again, whispering and giggling and silly. It had always managed to fill her with hope, to make her feel like everything was possible once more.
“Oh, Salem, your accents!” the witch exclaimed. “I could listen to you boys talk forever! I mean, holy shit,” She fanned herself.
“Here you are, dears. I’ll fetch you a glass of my night wine. I make it myself. It’s lovely for sleeping.”
Harry meant to make another funny comment, something asinine about cocks, but then he was swept up in Draco’s kiss, and in the moment, and in the slide of Draco atop him, and he forgot.
“Thanks for coming out with me tonight,” Harry said. It occurred to him that Draco was leaving, and that when they saw one another again, it would be different. They would be working together, not just having a wild adventure for one day. The real world would be there, pressing in on them.
Theo said five years. Daphne gave them five years, too, although she apologized for it. “Sorry, boys, but I’ve seen how you drive each other mad, and it’s not always in a good way.” Greg Goyle, who was living in Munich, sent his money along with a note that simply read,
“I don’t know what the fuck’s wrong with me,” Harry said. He was such a wanker, good lord. “I did this yesterday, too. I just…fuck, it’s a lot.”
They were both still in the aftermath, breathing hard. “Draco,” Harry said quietly. Draco was looking away, not at him, and somehow he knew that wasn’t a good thing.
