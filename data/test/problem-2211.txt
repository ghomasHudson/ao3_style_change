They had reached the labyrinth, which quickly shifted from threatening to open and welcoming as soon as Draco stepped in.
Draco stayed were he stood, while the boys –scowling and glaring- were herded away by a furious Flitwick.
“Hold up, hold up,” Scorpius managed to say through his giggles. “Why have you warded the labyrinth with your magical core?”
It only took ten minutes before a Slytherin stormed into the Great Hall, enthusiastically whispering to every Slytherin present. A seventh year called Draco as well, so they moved in an organised group towards the Slytherin common room.
“Lucia? Why would you think that?” Harry asked, while James bent over to Aquila to ask her who they meant.
“Your son came up to me this morning. Ophiuchus. He wanted to be doing something today, but didn’t know what he was allowed to do. Did you have ideas?”
He shouldn’t have said that, he knew it, but confrontation was the only way. The only way to lure a Ravenclaw out of their cave of safety.
“Oh, trust me, I’m sure they have snogged,” Albus snorted. “Have you seen the way they look at each other?”
He started with the song he wrote himself, to loosen the knot of emotions and thoughts he once had, and then added verses to it as his children were born. He remembered singing this song for his children somewhere in the past schoolyear, a week after the duel with Potter, and even sining the very last verse he had written, which referred to his past with Potter and how he felt about him now.
And so, it was decided. Although there would have to be a lot to be salvaged, since Draco and Potter were very stubborn human beings.
“Hmm, perhaps. I rather had something else in mind. Is it all right if I take you out for dinner this evening?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Blaise agreed. “Like, if he knows you can’t eat chocolate, or you don’t like it, or you’re trying to lose weight, he won’t offer it. But he will offer something else. If he thinks you’re worth it. So, if he knows you don’t eat chocolate for whatever reason, he’ll have something else for you, instead of the chocolate, he’ll do a lot of research and puts in a lot of effort to be able to offer you something else. Something you do like and you can eat. You know.”

And everyone who left kudos! And a special thank you to the commenters! I will endeavour to reply to all comments in the future!
Yet somehow Draco had managed to for a good amount of time. Another reason Harry has no business befriending the blonde.
"Hey, look at me." The hand pulls, applying the smallest amount of pressure, and Draco doesn't have the mental nor physical strength to be disobedient.
How do we feel about Harry's POV? I'm thinking of dropping a couple chapters of his in there somewhere. Of course this will be predominantly from Draco's POV, but it seemed like a fun idea to throw in Harry! Tell me what you think by commenting! Love it, hate it, let me know!
They're silent again, then, the sound of their breathing filling up the empty space. "Thank you." Draco says.
But it doesn't take a genius, or even someone intelligent really, to see that there's something going on between Harry and Draco.
Harry's voice cuts through, making him focus and ground himself. He notices with a start that they're cruising quite far from the courtyard- and high up too. He hadn't realised how quick they travelled, it seemed like decades to him.
at the praise, too caught up in the feel of Harry's hand against his skin to feel ashamed. "Kiss me." He intends to say it like a command, but his voice betrays him and he sounds suspiciously like he's begging.
"No, really. That's alright. She said she'd meet me at a ... certain spot, I should get going." He scratches the back of his neck, and the rather bleak eureka moment hits Draco suddenly.
A blonde girl Draco recognises as Luna Lovegood sits on the other side of Hermione. She tilts her head when she sees him, as though she's trying to make sense of some impossible problem. Maybe she is; Luna's always been in a world of her own.
His day is only made worse when Slughorn, in all his infinite wisdom, decides it would be a good idea to randomly pair up students for the practical.
"I didn't mean it like that, Harry." He says, shaking his head, but a small voice in his mind isn't sure if that's the truth. Maybe there is a part of him that's unsure if Harry really did, wholly and unequivocally, pick him over Ginny.
Harry grabs his hand suddenly, pulling him up jerkily. "Harry!" Draco protests with strong disdain at being manhandled.
Get going they do. Or at least, they try. He understands why Hermione looked so frazzled when she opened the door; Harry's absolutely impossible to work with. He's some sort of hoarder, surely, because he flat out rejects the idea of throwing
Also just wanted to make absouloutely clear that this is FICTIONAL. No, I don't believe  hugging and loving someone is going to fix any issues you're struggling with. Please see someone to get help, a relationship can support but not clear such issues. H and D's relationship is idealised and embellished to make it cutsey. It's an unfair standard and shouldn't be emulated in certain aspects.
But really then, he can't blame Harry for playing the middle, not when he's doing the same damn thing.
But Harry's hand accidentally dips lower, and Draco's pyjama sleeve is hiked up and he's running the pads of his fingers over the bumpy skin over his wrist where smooth skin should lie.
Other than that, Harry's room is basically indistinguishable from his own. Or it would be, if Harry wasn't so messy. The small kitchenette is overflowing with clutter, and almost every surface in the room is covered with nicknacks, or photos.
Harry, lying in his bed. Harry, his hands all over him. Harry, fingers tugging at blonde, almost white hair, nails running down tan skin, breath filling up empty space -
"No, I don't. Just say it Harry." Draco's pushing, far too hard, and he knows he has a bad track record of missing out on the moon because he wants the stars, but he can't help it. He's got to know.
He wakes again, drenched in sweat like last night. But it's worth it, because, even if just for a fleeting, fabricated moment, the world stilled, time froze, and Draco touched heaven for the first time in his life.
"That's the problem." Harry says. "I'm going to sound like a prat saying this, but there's too many choices. Too many people want me to do too many things. Everyone's expecting me to be amazing, live some extraordinary life. I don't want to be boring, but I don't want to be
"I know. It's how I know you won't miss another one again." He smiles at the blonde boy. "Hey, do you want a cup of tea or something?"
It's not tentative and careful like before; Harry's thrown all caution to the wind, his mouth assertive and possessive against his.
Draco studies the ground. It's dumb, absolutely idiotic, but the little discomfort Draco had felt needs to be quelled before anything else can happen. "Harry I ... I'm not second choice. I'm not someone you can kiss because you can't kiss her. I can't be that for you."
I have no words for how sorry I am for the late update! Thank you to all the commenters and readers who've put up with my late ass.
"And what you said about what that Gryffindor kid did to you. That a hex like that is too strong to fight non verbally."
Draco feels the shame inch into his cheeks. He's humiliated. Harry must think he's pathetic, insecure, and a host of other qualities he's most certainly not.
Draco's heart slows, not daring to even beat too loudly in case it distracts him from the surreal scene unfolding in front of his eyes.
"I don't think Professor Shrike has a choice." He says, as a way to divert his attention from the gut-wrenching scene. "There's a large number of students taking Defence against the Dark Arts this year ; too many to fit into one class, i'd imagine."
Don't travel late at night, don't look at people the wrong way, don't walk down empty corridors. Maybe he can't fault Potter for treating him like a child, or some sort of precious porcelain doll, but he sure as hell can feel like one.
Draco has to bite his lip to hide the amused grin threatening to light up his face. Sometimes Harry's disregard for social niceties can be a good thing.
Shaking, he shrugs off his suddenly too heavy bedclothes, and slides his way out of bed. His feet hit the cold floorboards instead of his slippers, but it jolts him into awareness that little bit more, so he bares with the icy feeling.
Draco pulls the blankets over his head again, stopping the light from reaching him and calling him out on his lies. One day. Just one day, and he'll be okay. He'll get over it,
Harry. Foolish, righteous, unbelievably considerate Harry. He genuinely thought he'd be helping Draco by bringing Ginny; it's moronic, but kind in it's own misguided way.
if Harry asked him to? He's a man possessed; Harry's got him wound as tight as a coil round his little finger, and Draco's not letting go anytime soon.
. His jealousy of Ginny, his nervousness around Harry, the overwhelming hurt that threatens to consume him sometimes- it's all so much more palpable now.
He actually laughs at this, an odd, hearty sound, reaching Draco's ears and winding through his body, sending shivers down his spine and a fluffy feeling in his stomach. He likes hearing people laugh. It creates the illusion that he's laughing with them. That he's feeling the happiness they are.
"Well, i'm rather happy you're here, Draco. I thought you were quite terrible before, but I hear you're perfectly wonderful now. I do hope we become good friends." Luna says, nodding.
They're both technically missing a day today. But neither Draco nor Harry really feels guilty about it.
"Merlin, Draco, you big baby." Harry rolls his eyes, and before Draco knows it, a heavy coat is being dropped into his lap.
No, Potter's leniency can't possibly extend to Draco. He should despise him, even more than he already does.
He hadn't realised, but the closer they grew, the more and more Draco seemed to rely on Harry. Rely on his touch, his kind eyes, his soft words.
The sound of a branch cracking from behind him makes him quickly stagger to his feet, drawing his useless wand that's mostly for show, anyway.
"You're bleeding-" Harry says, frowning. He cups his jaw, twisting his head to either side to inspect his ears.
Harry looks confused, so Draco elaborates. "I think you still wish to help people, just not in the way the world's expecting you to. Not in such a ... public way. There's nothing inherently wrong with that."
Harry groans yet again, and resolves to shelf his troubles, right next to the dark space in his drawer he pushes the map towards - out of sight, out of mind.
Draco sneers at the younger boy, for a moment reminding himself of someone he's not anymore. Is this what Potter and his friends saw of him? Is this what they perceived him to be?
She's got to have the answer for Harry, even if it's an answer she wishes she didn't have to give. She doesn't speak it for a long time, but the silence gets too much for her to bear. She really shouldn't bite her tongue any longer.
"Draco, don't-" Harry starts, eyes flashing a warning and a reminder of their unspoken agreement that he'd do the talking.
"I like this, Draco. Meeting here, I mean. But we've never talked about stuff like this before. I want to be able to."
The apology rapidly dulls the fire that had been burning so intensely within Draco, sobering him and bringing him back to his senses.
She waves him off. "Don't apologise. It's in the past. Really, if someone had told me i'd be getting along with
"I'm glad I did. But Draco, please, take the well lit corridors from now on." He says, looking Draco in the eyes imploringly.
Harry's gone and buggered that up too, though. He knows Draco's not an idiot, he was bound to find out why Harry's so nervous around him outside of the tranquility of thier little 'spot.'
Potter's there at the lake again when Draco finally arrives. He can't seem to decide whether this excites or disappoints him.
Draco knows all too well how much the truth can hurt, so he'll keep fuelling his forged fantasy- he'd rather loose touch with veracity than confront his demons.
"Draco, we're not friends, and god knows I hate the things you've done, but ... please, just talk to Harry."
Hey guys! Thanks for all the reads and comments and kudos as usual. I just wanted to check in and apologise for the long long long delay. I've no excuse for how long I waited to upload this. Truth be told, I had started to wonder if this did was worth finishing, my passion had completely dwindled to nothing. But I'm doing better now, and I hope to keep writing and continue with my plan of making this story into a 3 part series. Oop, announcement alert, I'm making this into a three part series!
"Draco, wait just-" He walks closer, and Draco instinctually backs away. "I'm trying to make it better."
And now, she knows for sure as she sees Harry walking back towards the castle from her bedroom window. She hurries out of her room to confront him before he can disappear into his misery and his own private thoughts.
Draco can hear Hermione's voice faintly, muffled by the door. He wishes it could muffle the thoughts zapping around his head as well.
Draco turns back towards the castle with a sigh of defeat, as his heart once again overrules his more sensible conciousness, already mapping out a time for his next visit.
But if he wants to play pretend, Draco's willing to do his part. "What if I really had been looking for a book, Harry?"
"Tea break?" Harry asks, and both Hermione and Draco enthusiastically agree. It's fulfilling work, Draco feels as though he's accomplished something, but tiring all the same.
Draco can do little more than nod numbly and shiver. There's something about the way Harry said it; informal as it is authoritative, that sends tingles down Draco's spine.
Thank you once again to all the people who left kudos, commented and read! Please, Please leave comments, they're very very encouraging to see. Commenters (especially one special one amongst you, you know who you are😋) thank you to the moon and back! Cookies to all the people who subscribed and bookmarked and left kudos too! All you other lovely readers are awesome too!
tree they sit against. It's not nearly enough, but it's enough. For Draco, if Harry's there with him, it's always enough, even if he does get hypothermia and ends up in the hospital wing, as long as Harry's there to visit him, it's
Harry's never felt this light in his entire life! Well, maybe that's not entirely true, but it sure is a good feeling to finally close the chapter on this stupid, stupid fight.
anymore. He'd been thinking the wrong thing about Harry; envious of how loved, how respected he is. But he's also watched incessantly, criticised, paraded about like a spectacle. They're more alike than Draco thought.
- Regarding three months passing - terms start 1rst September. So realistically, a little over three months has passed
he doesn't get to act like people should know, or even take notice really. Harry can't understand why
Harry nods ever so slightly, mechanically, unthinkingly. Hermione's seen Harry drunk before, but this is somehow worse, despite him not having a drop of alcohol in his system. "Draco. I kissed Draco."
His affection for Harry is just unprecedented enough for it to be fascinating; Draco never thought he'd fall for him, not in a lifetime and a half. Not after spending years upon years hating him. But, apart from being easy on the eyes, Harry's everything Draco could ever want.
Draco rolls his eyes almost to the back of his head. It's ridiculous. If anything, he's the one trying to start something.
It's strange in a way; Draco was raised with having the best of the best, expensive, luxurious spreads of toys and entertainment, and yet, nothing can compare with the joy he feels, just sitting by the lake, staring at the glistening water stare back up at him.
But all he does is step back, gesturing for Draco to enter. Draco inwardly exhales in relief, stepping into the room,
Draco's chest is heaving deep breaths by the end of the speech, and his eyes are, for once, fixed directly onto Harry's.
"Damn, out of milk. I think Ginny's got some." Harry says, placing the mugs - finally cleaned and polished- back onto the counter. "She's got Quidditch training, but i'm sure I left her key here somewhere ..."
"We're not hiding it from you, Hermione." Harry says carefully, glancing at Draco. "We're just trying to make it more..."
It's a trivial victory, but a victory nonetheless, so it still puts a smug smile on Draco's face. "Anything sweet. Scones, cakes, chocolates."
Draco nods. He can understand missing it. But unfortunately for him, he hasn't had the courage to step onto a broom after what happened in the Room of Requirement. Every time he comes close, he's too cowardly to follow through, fearful of the flames just licking his robes, the drop just inches below the broom, his death mere seconds away ...
"It is, isn't it? I know I kind of sprung it on you, but I thought it would be good, you know? I really don't think she meant anything by what she said, if that's what you're upset about." He breathes out heavily, and Draco can feel his cool breath on the back of his neck, making him shiver. "I dunno what I was trying to do ... I just - maybe meeting like this ... it'll help things between you two."
In fact, they're both so respectful towards the solidity of the arrangement that they've yet to miss a day; every time Draco's there, Harry is too. So much so that Draco's retrospective thought that
The moon's still visible behind the curtains of misty clouds, it's shrouded light falling onto the two boys, and illuminating them to none but themselves. They've got a spotlight, but there's no act to put on, no audience to please.
Draco turns to set his eyes on the line where the sea meets the sky, afraid of falling into the hypnosis he always seems to succumb to when looking at Potter for too long.
But, after an hour or two, they manage to wear him down enough to clear away a large portion of the clutter. Draco couldn't be happier, the mess was starting to suffocate him. Not that he was planning on making appearances at Harry's dorm a habit. No, he hadn't dreamt about spending extended amounts of time here, really. What a ridiculous accusation.
He looks away, at the ground beneath his feet, studying the earth more intensely than he ever did in Herbology. "I don't want to talk about it."
I can't express how greatful I am to all those who commented and left kudos. You guys are amazing! Also to the people who subscribed, and the people who bookmarked my work, thank you so much. I feel so blessed to be receiving so much love.
The water is glistening as always, the chilly breeze rippling the surface and distorting the moon's reflection into wavering pieces of bright, white, light.
But not for Harry -no, for his words, his guestures. For the kindness he surrenders so willingly, even when it is undeserved.
Perhaps he is a dead man. Life isn't just the simple fact of being alive - it's more than that. Much more. Draco's never lived for the more.
He's not wrong; apparently seeing Harry Potter finally jinx former arch enemy Draco Malfoy in public draws quite the crowd.
"Your hand-"  Harry starts, and Draco automatically tugs his sleeve lower over his left arm, but it's the neatly wrapped bandages on his right that is his point of concern. "What happened?"
However, something in him keeps forcing the uncomfortable truth that his wounds matter as much as Harry's.
"I'm fine, like I said before. It barely hurts." He lies fluently, it's like a second language to him.
"What?" Draco's lips move minutely, and his voice comes out just as hesitant as he expects. He's too close to Harry's eyes - he can see his own tentative expression in them.
And anyway, he's got the Weasley, right? Why on earth would Harry choose Draco over Ginny? Or Draco over anyone for that matter. No, it's better this way. He should just dismiss these ridiculous feelings; go back to focussing on his work and the N.E.W.Ts.
Heyyo! I probably sound like a broken record, but I love all of you readers and commenters and subscribers and bookmarkers and - let's just say I just love you all <3
No. No matter how angry, how tense Harry gets, it would be unfair for Draco to think of him the way he's thinking now.
So, it's not certain that he likes Harry. Maybe he's just confused. That's got to be it. He's confused and he's latched on to Harry because he provides a rare sense of comfort to Draco. That's all it is, surely.
Once upon a time, Draco had wanted to be a healer, before his father had stepped in, demanding a less 'cowardly' and 'common' career path. Because being a Deatheater was
"Oh." Draco says, because he has to reply, yet he can't think of a single thing to say. He's still processing
Draco shakes his head. "The Aurors will most certainly detain me immediately if I attempt to enter the manor. And mother's on house arrest, of course, so we can't meet anywhere else, either." It's freshly painful, talking about it. And that's how he realises he hasn't talked about it- not to Harry, not to anyone. Nobody knows his living situation. And he's suddenly not in the mood to discuss it.
It never did. In 6th year, try as he may to explain it away under the guise of 'suspicious behaviour', his actions were still, ultimately unjustified.
Three, there's hands on his shoulders, and on his chin too, getting him to look up into, of course, Harry's eyes.
"Let's not do this right here." Hermione tries again, and finally, Ron looks around, taking notice of all the eyes on them. His grip falters slightly, having the good sense to look at least a little chagrined.
She clears her throat to get the focus back on her. "Well. Good thing you're here. Here-" She hands him a wand, which he frowns at.
"Potter!" Draco hisses quietly, glaring holes into the side of Harry's head. How can he be so carefree? He can't be that unaffected by it all, surely. Does he have no shame?
is unsure of himself doesn't really instil hope into Draco. "You're Harry Potter. Anybody would want you working for them."
Draco nods once, somehow finding it within himself to overcome his gripes about the uneasy situation. He busies himself with arranging the equipment, but he still manages to catch the baleful look Ron throws his way.
"Ron, he's lost everything! His family, his friends, his reputation. I really don't think plotting to take me down is high on his to do list."
Ron opens the door promptly, but upon seeing Harry, goes to slam it in his face. Harry's anticipating the reaction, so he quickly jams his foot between the door and the frame, stopping Ron from closing it fully. He winces at the contact; it's a lot more painful than movies make it look.
"Sportsmanship! There's never been a better time to make new friends, you know." He says, far too cheery for Draco's taste.
He was supposed to be working on a Defence Against the dark Arts assignment. He'd never let anything distract him from schoolwork before (apart from the looming threat of the Dark Lord, obviously). It's another reason he and Harry would never work out. Harry's far too distracting. With his square jaw, and slight stubble, and messy hair Draco's dying to run his fingers through ... no, they'd surely make a poor match.
He doesn't even react, just stills, head hung as low as it was when he entered. His eyes seem to stretch on into infinity, like he knows all, but nothing at the same time.
Harry barely acknowledges him - just a small smile after walking in and that's it. He's too wrapped up with talking with her to even care about conversating with Draco.
Sometimes, Draco misses Harry, his touch, his concern, his friendship. Other times, he wants to stick pins into the boy. How is it that Harry can be so selectively obtuse? So he can keep his mouth shut when Draco's upset with him, but not now, huh?
"There's talk of making me the next Minister of Magic, after a couple years. Can you imagine that? It's insane!"
Perhaps it's wrong, to allude to the war like he did, but it seems to trigger a reaction from Ron, so Harry doesn't let himself feel too bad.
The former reason is why he finds himself in old Slughorn's potion class first thing in the morning. If it were any other lesson, Draco would have moaned and groaned on to no end about how no class has any business being so early, but the potions class, despite the very tangible lack of a certain Slytherin professor, never fails to bring comfort to the youngest Malfoy.
Luna would be a welcome distraction, a helpful mediator, but she's disappeared somewhere Draco doesn't care to follow, and he's left fumbling in the dark.
"Cold, Distant. A bigot. Someone who'd rather be feared than loved." Draco's saying too much, he's being too vulnerable. But Harry's looking at him with those warm eyes, and Draco lets himself get lost in their comforts. "I don't want to be feared, or hated."
"No, Harry. It's my fault. I shouldn't have ... if I wasn't there, Ginny would still be, and i'm sorry for that. I didn't mean for this to happen."
"So," Hermione says, rolling her eyes as though Ron was being intentionally witless. "He cares about Harry. A lot. Why else would he jump to make sure he was alright?"
"It's not her's, either." Draco mumbles, eyes transfixed onto Harry's. He could fall into them, could easily be trapped in their blissful world that promises wonder and joy and
He misses it, he realises with a start. Misses the feeling of being cared for, being checked up on, being listened to. Though he's loathesome to admit it, he likes being
The latter rolls his eyes irritably. "Give me the blasted rock." He snaps, marching forward to the edge of the river bank, hand outstretched.
Watching Harry trying to fumble his way around a good excuse as to why Draco's eardrums are perforated is amusing to say the least.
Maybe he calls after him like he did with Ron, but he can't hear it. He can't see much either; tears fill his eyes and blur his vision.
Draco can't, he's fixated on him. The way he smiles easily at the people who greet him happily, like being loved is second nature to him. Well, it is, isn't it?
Harry's one of the first, and only people to believe that, and Draco's unable to think straight long enough to apply his regular cynicism and prove him to be a liar.
He changes his mind when the broom shoots up into the night after a quick warning from Harry. Immediately his heart is in his throat, eyes clammed shut so tight he can see stars, and arms tangled around Harry's waist in a vice-like grip. He's back there again, and the cool night air does nothing to dull the heat of the flames reaching, and reaching, and ...
What reasonable explanation is there to justify his hammering heart, his fickle head, his complete willingness to damn everything and just
Draco's lips are red and bruised when he pulls away, resting his forehead on Harry's. They breathe together, once, twice, until Harry lets out a ragged  laugh.
"There's no more Ginny, Hermione!" He snaps, coming back to life in front of her eyes. The ridgid form leaves his body and places itself in his mouth, drawing it into a tight, angry line.  "We're over. We've been over for months now, can't you see?"
Draco thought his days of hurting people were far behind him, he thought he'd never have to witness that kind of torture again. Yet here he is, watching history repeat itself rather awfully.
If Pansy were here, she'd tell him he's being petty. She'd be right. It's understandable that Potter wouldn't want his friends to know about them just yet. Understandable that he wants to spend time with his girlfriend. Understandable that he doesn't want people to see them together.
The walk from his room to Harry's isn't too far; and most of the 8th years are in classes at this time anyway. Draco's DADA class had been cancelled- something about some fifth years accidentally setting a Boggart loose. So he arrives outside Harry's door with little trouble. However, getting into Harry's room may be another task entirely.
He's laughing. He's laughing and he can't stop. He laughs until his throat hurts, and the scratchiness is something to rival the sharp stone that left the still-bleeding scrape on his hand.
Draco wishes this revelation wouldn't make him mad - he really does. But something about feeling like the dirty little secret Potter doesn't want to talk about turns his stomach.
perceptive. It's her shrewdness that infuriated him so before; he could only ever come second to her first.
It's strange, really, because all the other years have houses. It's specifically the 8th years- no prizes for guessing why that is.
-" But Draco knows it's futile to try and block out the answer that's coming. Why does he have to say it, when Draco's been aware this whole time?
There's a rustle behind the door, and way too soon, the handle is turning and the door swings inwards with a squeak.
It will take them time, time they don't have and won't have until the break is over. So Draco and Harry had come to an agreement.
Draco has always been ghost-like ; in a way. Be it the shockingly white hair, stoney eyes, or perpetually sneering expression, something about him seemed supernatually charged.
"Harry!" Ron's voice this time, followed by a harsh banging on the door. "What's taking you so bloody long?"
He likes Shrike, though, strange as he is. He doesn't treat Draco like a ticking bomb; waiting for him to explode and ruin everything again. Draco tells himself it's because he's just a good person, and not because he wasn't there to personally witness any of Draco's crimes.
His lips are soft and meld perfectly together with Draco's, almost like they were made to be his, made to be pressed against him so gently but so confidently. It's a slow kiss, Harry's cautious but assured- he wants this, surely.
"It looks a lot better, doesn't it?" Hermione says, and it takes a second for Draco to realise she's talking to him.
It's hard, to do what's right, not what's easy. Maybe too hard, because the prospect of Harry being just as infatuated with Draco as Draco is with him ... it's too thrilling to give up. Exciting, but scary. Safe, but dangerous. It's too much conflict for Draco.
"We broke up. " Harry says shortly, and the hurt tone of his voice makes Draco regret bringing her up.
fresh in his memory, don't you worry. But it's different this time. Hermione's his kind-of friend, and Ron won't curse him on sight so that's a definite improvement.
Yet sitting in his room silently for the rest of the night would rustle him even more, so he pulls on his trousers and a coat over his night shirt, and slips quietly out of his dorm, aimlessly making his way through the never-ending corridors of the school.
Somehow, they'd ended up in Draco's bed. They'd been talking, and Draco's knees started to threaten to give up on him so he'd sat on the side of the bed and Harry had followed suit. They wound up with Draco's head against Harry's chest, fingers tracing patterns onto his arm, like ink marking an invisible tattoo.
Malfoy lets out a breath. “Arsehole.” He then sets about taking the pictures out of Harry’s hands and placing the stack on the nightstand.
Hermione comes with him, voice rising into a scream as she does. Her pussy spasms hot and tight around his cock, and Harry is practically floating. He’d never imagine sex could be quite like this, and now he’s not sure how he’ll be able to cope when these two are ready to move on. After this, how could he?
“Suppose we can check number eight off, hm?” Malfoy asks, quill in hand. When Harry doesn’t rush to agree, he turns. “The incident after Potions?” he clarifies, as if there was any possibility Harry had forgotten.
Harry complains loudly about Malfoy signing up for a Friday class, but Malfoy’s only response is the pleased look he wears as he dresses and finally leaves.
She stops off at her own room to change out of her school uniform, and shows up at their door a few minutes later wearing a simple, clingy black dress. Its sleeves end at her braceleted wrists and its skirt ends at her black fuzzy slippers. Harry eyes her figure greedily, and Malfoy looks about ready to pounce, but she climbs onto Harry’s bed and makes herself comfortable sitting against his pillows.
Undeterred, Harry talks over him. “Sorry, I just had the most amazing dream, and I really need- that is, I want, if you’re willing…”
“What do you need, Potter?” Malfoy asks, one last time, but Harry can’t answer, not with Malfoy’s fingers pressing against his prostate like this. He’s going to- he’s-
They sit side by side on Malfoy’s bed, and Malfoy pulls out a stack of photographs. “I’ve contracted some renovations on one of my properties in London. The Wizarding Corner of Chelsea, of course.”
He moans loudly around Malfoy's fingers, sucking greedily and pumping his hand over his prick. He's going to come, really,
Surprisingly, Ron elects to sit with them at dinner. Unsurprisingly, it is the most awkward meal of Harry’s entire life. All things considered, that’s saying a lot.
She looks at it hungrily and whips out her wand. First she mutters a Silencing Charm that Harry would not have remembered to cast. Then, she flicks it and a single black latex glove comes sailing out of Harry’s bed and fits itself smoothly on Hermione’s outstretched hand.
Hermione folds her arms imperiously and gives Ron her most impatient look. Ron fumbles to finish chewing and bring up their modified privacy charm, with about as much grace as he is capable of.
The room is quiet as Harry’s mind runs wild, wondering what rumors Gin has spread about him this time. He doubts Ginny was being malicious; more likely than not she’s been spreading word of his (as yet undiscovered) sexual prowess, and perhaps a few more preposterous tattoos.
And Malfoy is there, having silently parted Harry's curtains. He stands, already dressed in his pressed white shirt and trousers, looking down at Harry with his mouth open and his cheeks pink. As Harry watches, he licks his lips and tugs the blankets down more for a better view.
Hermione and Malfoy peek at him over the edge of the bed, laughing uproariously, and Harry is considering whether Timbuktu would be far enough to escape this humiliating episode, but then Hermione brandishes her wand. “
spilled anything. He’s torn between admiration of the clever little plan, and irritation at such Slytherin tactics, but ultimately, he can’t be mad. This is exactly the sort of tutorial he’d had in mind.
Harry does exactly as she says, rubbing his prick between her legs, loving the feeling himself. Then he pulls back and, with her help, pulls her lacy blue panties down and tosses them behind him. He looks down at her, her silky brown thighs parting under his gaze, her inner lips parting too, wet and so very inviting. He wants- so much, but he suspects a good lover is more in the business of asking, rather than just taking. He can’t resist sliding a hand up a soft leg, stroking his thumb over her clit. “You’re beautiful,” he says without quite meaning too. “What do you- Hermione, gorgeous, tell me what you want.” He knows he’s stumbling over his words, but she’s
Mostly, though, the picture tour of Malfoy’s home is making Harry feel a bit forlorn. He himself has no idea where he’ll live after Hogwarts, and the thought of Malfoy living here alone, or worse, with someone new, is severely hampering his ability to enjoy this.
Harry grimaces, and sits at the foot of his bed to receive the anticipated lecture about shirking his responsibilities. Hermione tells him off, but it lacks the urgency that her lectures have always had in the past. It’s almost as if she’s only doing it because they’re both expecting her to.
, I am not seeking your advice as a man of distinguished aesthetic tastes. I want to know if you like it. If, maybe… that is, if you’d perhaps like to live there. With me.”
Looking more disturbed than ever, Hermione turns the book over in her hands. “Harry, this isn’t a textbook. Have you been...
Hermione abandons them early on Sunday, off to the library. She encourages Malfoy to join her, but he adamantly refuses to get up.
“I suppose,” she allows. “Perhaps I ought to get my hands on a hero of my own?” She and Zabini go back and forth for a minute, naming names in a blasé fashion, debating the pros and cons of using their classmates for their own personal gain.
Draco smirks and does as he’s told, settling on his hands and knees on the bed, giving Harry the most magnificent close up view.
Harry sighs quietly, wondering how the hell he’s supposed to get any work done with his prick hard and leaking in his trousers.
“Yesssss,” she hisses, planting her feet on the bed and rolling her hips up against the thrust of her own fingers.
Surprisingly, it’s Malfoy who fails to be casual. "Potter, what...?” he whispers, something horrified lurking in his gaze. He reaches, hesitantly, and traces the circle of braided skin in the center of his chest.
“I’m more interested to know how!” She says with a dirty grin, and then her eyes grow wide. “Oooh, Ron must HATE this!!” She’s got that evil little sister glee thing going on.
He wants to go on, to lap at her cunt some more, maybe until she comes again, but just then his stomach grumbles quite loudly. Then Hermione is giggling instead of moaning, and Harry laughs too, but it’s too weird in this position, so he falls aside, and Hermione rolls onto her side.
“The Malfoy Heir offering himself up for the pleasure of some less than virtuous Gryffindor heroes: what would people say?” Malfoy continues airily.
“Brilliant!” Harry shoves back the covers, and wrestles Draco out of his pajamas impatiently. He’s expecting Draco to mock his clumsiness, but when he looks up at his face, Draco just looks back, wide-eyed and silent. Odd, but Harry will take it. Draco’s prick is filling quickly, and Harry holds it in his hand, gives it a stroke, marvels at its beauty. He leans in, tries to remember what Draco had done to him a couple of days ago. He kisses the tip, feeling hot and lewd already. Harry sticks his tongue out, laps around the head of Draco’s prick as it starts to protrude from its foreskin. His mouth is quite literally watering, so this seems as good a moment as any to open wide and suck the tip into his mouth. It’s quite the mouthful, and for a second, he’s not sure what to do.
Harry opens his mouth to reassure her, but Malfoy speaks first, “Oh, were you the slutty one yesterday? Could have sworn it was me.” His tone is flippant, almost bored.
Maybe not forever, he acknowledges silently as Draco crawls up to collapse next to Harry. But he’s pretty stubborn. He won’t be letting this go without a fight. He smiles tiredly at Draco, runs a hand through his messy blonde hair, kisses his wet, delectable lips. Once he’s licked up every taste of Hermione, he looks to see Hermione on her hands and knees, digging around the bed, presumably in search of her knickers. Harry knows the polite thing would be to help, but he catches a glimpse of her glistening pussy under her skirt and has to touch it. Her hips wriggle in delight at the firm stroke he gives her.
Months – years? – of fantasizing have done nothing to prepare Harry for the reality of Draco bloody Malfoy on his knees for Harry, holding his prick and smirking up at him. Malfoy gives him a long, slow stroke and drags his lips across Harry’s cock, and Harry squeezes his eyes shut and hopes desperately that he won’t come before he’s even inside Malfoy’s mouth. Malfoy tongues his way up Harry’s prick enthusiastically, back down again.
“Oh,” Harry says when he finally gets the chance. He reaches for the stack of photos again. “Hermione’s room?” he asks, holding up the gorgeous little room full of books and a fluffy looking bed.
It takes a second for his brain to catch on, and another second for him to break off their kiss and remove his hands, but he manages to let her know someone is coming in time for her to walk further up the aisle and pretend to be browsing the shelves. Luckily, the 6th year Hufflepuff who strolls by catches only a glimpse of a flushed Harry Potter standing around with fists stuffed in his trouser pockets before she smirks and moves on.
Ron raises his eyebrows at Harry. “Your chances with Hermione.” When Harry begins to bluster out an utterly unconvincing denial, Ron cuts him off. “Please don’t claim you aren’t interested. I know you, Harry.”
Harry isn’t exactly looking forward to another painfully awkward meal with just Malfoy and Ron for company, so he’s more than a little relieved when Hermione sits down next to him.
He’s only about two steps into the room when Malfoy launches at Harry out of seemingly nowhere. Malfoy shoves him against the wall, bumping Harry’s head against the stone painfully. He considers protesting, but. Malfoy’s body is pressed all along his front, slim and hard and lean, and he’d quite like to see where this is headed, first.
Harry watches Draco touch himself, and tells him how good he looks, how brilliant it feels, and ruts up to meet every downward thrust. Amazingly, Draco comes first, splashing come on Harry’s shirt and tie, hole spasming hard round Harry’s prick, and that’s much more than Harry can endure. He yanks Draco’s jerking hips down in his lap, buries himself completely inside and lets his orgasm wash over him like a tidal wave.
“If you thought, even for a moment, that you’d be getting in the way of Potter’s happiness, you would have never made yourself available to either of us. We both know that, and even Potter might understand that on some level.” Harry would object, but it’s a pretty fair assessment of him. “So why don’t you tell us where this sudden uncertainty is coming from?” His tone is bored, but somewhere along the way, they learned how to tell when Draco is sincere.
He hops out of bed as well, hungry for the sight of Malfoy’shot body, slippery and wet and flushed pink.
“You, of all people, will survive. You’re big on rising from the proverbial and sometimes literal ashes, are you not?” Ginny wraps an arm around his shoulders. “Totally jealous, by the way. Hermione’s looking particularly fetching these days.”
bit wet, but he definitely does not want to talk about it right now. Hermione hardly seems to mind the distraction, and obliges him with gusto. Malfoy makes his way to suck Harry’s right nipple at the same moment Hermione sucks Harry’s bottom lip into her mouth, and muffled moans begin to spill out.
It’s only a few hours later that Harry wakes. The room is dark, cool, and quiet. He’d had hazy dreams, and can’t even really remember what they’d been about, only that they’d left him rock hard and positively desperate for an orgasm. Suddenly, the folly of having offered Hermione his bed is quite clear. Seems a bit rude to wank in Malfoy’s bed whilst the other boy is trying to sleep, so there’s little he can do if he doesn’t want to sneak off to the bathroom for a furtive midnight jerk.
Draco takes only a few minutes of this, and finally wraps a hand round the head of his prick. He mostly seems to just be holding it, barely stroking at all, but Harry can tell by the way his body moves, by the ‘ah! Ah!’ noises he keeps making, that he’s about to come.
By the time Harry has calmed down enough to join Hermione in the library proper, she is deep into her studies. Since this is technically his study period, Harry really
Eventually, Ron speaks. “I was working my way towards giving you my blessing. I was going to tell you not to wait too long, because a girl like Hermione isn’t going to sit on the shelf for very long... guess that’s unnecessary now.”
“To plow your arse while Harry fucks your delectable little cunt, slow and sweet.” At this, Harry’s prick gives a tired jerk. Does Malfoy never tire of dirty talk?
A bouncy, strawberry blonde Seventh Year Hufflepuff sends Ron a sweet little smile before she turns and heads for the Hufflepuff table to join her friends. It is immediately clear to Harry that she has detoured to the Eighth Year table for the explicit purpose of saying hello to Ron, as it is not by any route on the way to her destination.
On the other hand, the mere thought of people seeing that bruise he’d left on Malfoy’s throat this morning gives him a stiffy.
Malfoy complains throughout the entire walk down to the Great Hall, expensive boots clipping against the stone in an angry staccato. His school robes billow behind him with almost Snape-like drama. His scathing tirade covers a breadth of topics including but not limited to: Harry’s Gryffindor tie, Harry’s hopelessly messy hair, Harry’s scuffed trainers, and Harry’s poor time-management skills. Mostly, though, he complains that they will likely miss all the good breakfast foods.
“Did you only come once?” he asks. Harry is perfectly fine with his one explosive orgasm deep inside Draco’s arse, but he’d be more than happy to get Hermione off before she heads off for the night.
That's when it gets much better than Harry's fantasies, because Malfoy swiftly stuffs two fingers into Harry's open mouth, pushing deep. "Suck," Malfoy commands, and hearing the obscene word in Malfoy's crisp tones has Harry's eyes squeezing shut.
Draco slings his arms round Harry’s neck, and Harry can’t help but arch his neck for a filthy kiss, tongues tangling. He’s so- they’re so
Hermione sighs. “Yeah. I want it,” she says with a slight pout, and apparently that’s all the permission Malfoy needs.
Harry’s throat is full of denials, of prideful claims that this unsolicited cuddling (and coddling) is entirely unnecessary. But even he is aware that this feels fucking good, if a bit weird. What comes out instead is a request to borrow Hermione’s wand. She hands it over without a blink, and he swishes, flicks, and incants the modified levitation charm he’d recently mastered. The charm is intended to hold a book in place, within the reader’s view, hands-free.
Is Harry meant to stop? That's generally what one does when caught wanking after all, but this isn't anything like that time Neville had caught Harry in the bathroom in the middle of the night 6th year, trousers around his ankles and a finger up his own bum. Malfoy's literally eaten Harry's come, and-
His worries are in vain, though, because once he's finally ready, Malfoy just picks up his book bag and silently follows Harry out the door and down the stairs. More silent coexistence, then. Harry finds this comforting, in light of what he'll likely have to deal with today.
Harry looked at Hermione, who was looking between the two of them, her eyes amused. “It’s high time I mingle. Say goodbye to me when you go.”
“You think she is campaigning for the Minister of Magic position?” Draco asked as they walked through the crowd.
Maybe it was a big secret. They both had problems letting people in, really in. To allow them to see what lay at the bottom of their souls, what they desperately wished for, and what they desired.
Draco’s arrival at Godric's Hollow was heralded by thunder and lightning. When Draco stepped out of the hearth, not a speck of dust on him, a deafening boom shook the house. Harry mouthed, “Drama queen,” and Draco rolled his eyes.
“You wish, Potter.” Then Draco hesitated. Harry looked at him more closely; the shadows were painting lines around his eyes and mouth. “No, I wanted to say it in person, and I was unsure of my welcome in your home.”
As an answer, Draco surged up and twisted them around. “Typical Potter, letting others do the actual work.”
“Oh.” Harry hadn’t expected that. Then he shrugged. “It’s not your fault. I’m not sure how much you could’ve interfered, and to be honest,” he plunged on as he saw Draco open his mouth, “it’s kind of a relief, you know? To have it out in the open. Even if now the marriage proposals have doubled.” Harry chuckled. Draco didn’t react at first, then he shook his head. “But why tell me here and now? Feared I would start throwing curses?” Harry asked, still amused.
Harry hummed. “I had wondered when you apologized for the pictures.” It hadn’t been only that, but the last three years while reporters still flocked to him the coverage in the papers had been drastically reduced.
Until Draco had shut him out one day, verbally and physically. Harry’s letter of apology had been returned unopened. They didn’t talk to each other for two years. Later Draco kept his distance, which Harry reluctantly accepted.
When Harry woke hours later to still rolling storm clouds, there was a split second of panic. Would Draco behave like then? Regret everything they’d shared? Throw him out after screaming at him that Harry had taken advantage of him? That he’d never wanted something like that to happen? That he wasn’t a poofter?
“It’s in the past. You were grieving.” Harry shrugged. It had hurt, but it had never been entirely black and white between them. “We already had seen enough death when we were teens. Losing someone you love makes one do strange things.”
“No, you have every right to still be angry with me. I behaved abysmally.” Yeah, Draco looked as if he had lost some grand battle.
“‘Mione,” Harry said mildly. Hermione shifted from one foot to the other. She stepped next to Harry, leaning her own back against the wall. She shuddered as the skin of her back made contact with the cold stone. All the magic in the world, and no one had the idea to warm the rocks even a bit.
,” he hissed in a low whisper, mindful of his surroundings. He had chosen a spot at the end of the ballroom, his back leaning against the stone. He never learned to feel comfortable in the middle of the room. He always needed something solid against his back, something that wouldn’t throw a curse at him.
Harry knew. Despite how overwhelming the family could be Ron loved them all dearly. After the war, he was even more protective of them.
“Please call me Hermione,” she replied simply. Harry side-eyed her suspiciously. But Hermione kept a pleasant smile on her face.
“No,” Draco burst out and then more muted as if he was admitting to some big secret. “I missed you.” His eyes were still concentrated on a point far away.
Outward he appeared calm, but his heart was hammering and his hands trembled. Something inside him had broken open.
They kept the topic light while eating, in stark contrast to the rolling thunder outside. Talking like that should’ve been complicated with their shared history, but as before, like then, it flowed between the two. Harry only became aware that they had moved when he sat down on the couch, Draco carefully settling next to him.
All Harry could do was lower his voice. Hermione looked less impressed with all the secrecy. She was also currently not embroiled in any scandal. Harry hadn’t wanted to come, but Hermione was done with his moping and dragged him out.
, had crossed paths over the years. Being thrown into adult-social interactions had changed their once school hood rivalry into something more amicable. It hadn’t cleared all the hurt away, but at least they could stay in the same room and talk about the weather without breaking out their wands. Hermione would say they had finally grown up.
“It helps that the whole topic is buried under so much red tape that we aren't sure what is going on,” Draco remarked while he sat down.
And because Harry could and because it felt right, he stepped close to Draco and kissed him on the cheek. “Come by tomorrow, and we will talk.”
Harry tracked the wizards and witches in the room. They all smiled and laughed. It was like watching the buzzing of a beehive, busy and distracting. He wondered what he could’ve done differently. But he had waited one and a half years after the separation before he found the courage to take this next step: dating a man. The kids had long left school, so he could do what he wanted. At least he had thought so.
When Draco’s wife Astoria had died a few years back, Albus vanished from Godric's Hollow for a few months. Harry felt obliged to send his own condolences. A week later, a terse reply was delivered, followed by an invitation to Malfoy Manor. Out of curiosity, Harry had accepted, and then—pain jostled him out of that particular memory. Hermione had pinched him in the hand.
Instead of answering outright, Harry released Draco’s hand and cradled the back of his head, pressing their foreheads together. He let himself feel for a moment Draco’s heat and smell, his breath ghosting over Harry’s lips.
It was unlucky that he was photographed kissing a guy four months later. The press, which still held an unhealthy interest in his private life, had a field day. It scared the poor guy away.
Maybe. Harry knew that his own son Albus Severus and Malfoy’s son Scorpius were the best of friends. And, as Harry suspected, also something more. But Albus had been very tight-lipped the last time Harry broached the topic, and so he decided to let them be. When the time was right, his youngest would come to him.
The fresh, crisp air was a blessing. It chased the first tendrils of Harry’s headache away, cooling his overheated cheeks. He leaned back against the balustrade, watching Draco with crossed arms. “What’s on your mind?”
“Draco, if this is you letting me down, it’s okay. You can just say no. We can also only be friends.” He put his hand over Draco’s that was resting between them. It was ice cold.
“The Medi witch has still not cleared me. And I guess, at the rate it's going, I never will. Boss is dropping hints.” A well-placed curse had put him out of Auror fieldwork for months now. Apparently, the side effects would stay with him for the rest of his life. Harry didn’t look forward to random knee pains and migraines. The healers had warned him there would be days, when he wouldn’t be able to get out of the bed at all.
“You really have no clue?” Harry raised an eyebrow. Draco was the closest he had been in the last three years. Harry felt the heat radiating from the other man. And it took all willpower to not reach out and ravage him.
Harry had thought that he'd considered all of the possible reactions to his ongoing campaign to Draw Malfoy's Attention to His Cock, but last night hadn't once crossed his mind. These days, Draco Malfoy rarely does anything without proper planning, so Harry can only conclude that Malfoy had been considering showing Harry his arse for some time now. Does that mean Malfoy wants him to
Malfoy turns his head to peer at Harry. He looks somewhat astonished to be asked such an inane question about his day, and Harry can hardly blame him.
Harry frantically tries not to remember how it had felt to gag on Malfoy's fingers not two hours ago. He’s also valiantly trying not to think about having another go with Hermione. They're rounding the corner to the classroom and the thought of McGonagall catching sight of his erection...
Malfoy pauses, takes a sip of his water, and considers Harry’s question. “Potter, how do aeroplanes fly?”
Harry is not to be deterred though. Actually, the more he thinks about Malfoy’s illicit meetings with other students, the more he wants to go. It takes quite a bit of convincing, and Malfoy still doesn’t understand why, but later that night they set out for Greenhouse Three. Harry hides under his cloak, and Malfoy manages to cast a very impressive Disillusionment Charm. It’s after 9, and there aren’t many people in the halls. Actually, they don’t run into anyone until they’re nearly out of the castle entirely. Harry is just marveling at just how easy this has been, when Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson round the corner up ahead.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Studying on a Friday afternoon, honestly,” he says dismissively, but reaches for the requested book.
his little ravenous noises of approval, and that might just be worse. He braces himself, opens his eyes, looks down. Malfoy has his hand wrapped around Harry’s prick, and is angling it towards his delicious little mouth.
Harry huffs a tiny laugh, but dutifully obeys. He experiments with much softer, flickering licks, and finds Hermione is much more responsive to those. She moans, and rolls her hips, and tell him just how good it feels. Harry’s starting to get the hang of it, possibly, when Malfoy nudges him. He turns, spots Malfoy standing there completely bare and loses focus.
Ron goggles at him speechlessly for at least a minute. “What?” Harry is relatively certain he need not repeat himself though. “But you just said…”
Malfoy slaps Harry’s hand away from his own dick, and Harry screams at him, a tear slipping from the corner of his eye. The urge to climax slowly recedes while Harry thinks about how very much he despises Draco bloody Malfoy, and then he jumps. Draco bloody Malfoy’s hand is on his cock, stroking it once and then aiming it up-
It seems Draco gets the same feeling. “Or don’t,” he suggests nonchalantly. “You must know Potter and I love to have you around.”
“Yes, thank you, that’s all very well and good,” Draco replies with a laugh. “Would you mind terribly if I rode your cock now?”
When the world comes back into focus, he’s got Hermione’s pants in his left hand and come all over his shirt and tie. Hermione is lying in exactly the same spot, but she’s looking up at Malfoy. He’s emerged from the bathroom dripping wet, prick thick and pointed skyward. Malfoy, unlike Harry, can see exactly what Hermione is doing between her legs and is staring, transfixed.
“Hmmm,” Hermione hums, kicking off her shoes and drawing her socked feet up on to the bed, knees bent. Her plaid skirt slides up, revealing much more of her smooth brown legs than Harry is accustomed to seeing.
Hermione beats him to the portrait, but only because she shoves him aside at the last moment. She gloats a bit as she stops to catch her breath and pat down her hair, caramel skin flushed. Harry, struck by the strongest urge to get her all disheveled and out of breath all over again, eyes her appreciatively.
After, Draco is still fingering him, and Harry’s panting and sighing with his face buried in Hermione’s perfect tits. He kisses them, licks them, suckles at them. He thinks, when he’s thinking again, that it’s probably time to pull out, but she stops him with legs wrapped around his waist.
It’s taking every ounce of Harry’s self-control not to stroke himself through his trousers, and Malfoy is not exactly helping his efforts. He smirks lazily as he unbuckles and removes his belt. Malfoy unbuttons his trousers and boldly turns around, giving Harry a full view of his arse through his royal blue boxer briefs as he bends down to fully remove said trousers. He stands, shooting Harry a burning look over his shoulder, and then repeats the same process with his pants.
“All right,” Ron replies, at the same times as Hermione says: “Never better!” They’re all three grinning at each other, so it’s only right that Malfoy break the silence.
His prick spurts out salty pre-come on Harry’s tongue, and Harry licks it up heartily before ducking down to suck harder. He’s just starting to get the hang of it when Draco seems to grow bigger, somehow, hotter.
"Good morning, Harry!" she greets as always, closing the book she'd been reading. The reassuring normalcy fades again, though, as she turns to look at Malfoy behind them. "Good morning, Malfoy," she says, voice slightly deeper, slightly more mischievous.
“You’re quite good at that, Harry,” she says conversationally, tugging him to lie fully on top of her. His hard cock brushes her thigh, and he kisses his way up to her neck and slides his hands up her sweet thighs to lift her skirt out of his way. Immediately, Hermione wraps her legs around him and starts rutting against his cock. He pushes back, rolling his hips against hers while she eggs him on. “Yes, Harry. Feels so good. Tease me a little more, then take my knickers off.”
“I’m glad you came back,” Hermione says in a rush, and Harry is suddenly certain that that’s why she’s really here.
Harry is busy staring at Malfoy, looking sort of ethereal in the golden pink light of the setting sun, so it takes him a while to notice that the silence isn’t tense. They have things to say to one another. Harry in particular has rather a lot on his mind, but. This, like so many of their shared moments this term, is unhurried. It’s not a busy moment that they need to fill with talk.
Normally, when one of them is changing in the room, the other turns away out of courtesy. But, what with the state of Harry’s cock (fully hard) and mind (full of images of sassy Hermione and the well-shaped Pansy Parkinson rolling around partially naked, moaning and grinding), well, turning away doesn’t even occur to him.
Malfoy looks at Harry, all uncertain eyes and flushed cheeks, and Harry doesn’t want to discuss anything at all. He wants to take Malfoy to the Greenhouse and positively devour him. He wants Malfoy to forget he’d ever taken anyone else there. He wants Malfoy to never be able to look at a plant again without thinking of Harry.
Neville, much further down the table and in the midst of a discussion with Blaise Zabini, gives Harry little more than a nod of acknowledgment.
It also sounds patently absurd. They look at each other for a moment before they both burst into laughter. Ron is guffawing, stuttering breathlessly about ‘accidental sex’. Harry’s belly laughter is a bit at himself, but primarily born of relief. Surely if he and Ron can still laugh together, they'll be able to get past this.
“We don’t have to, Harry. Not if you’re not comfortable.” She gives him the most understanding look, not the least bit tinged with disappointment, and he loves her as much as her ever has.
Malfoy’s very best Disillusionment Charm isn’t quite good enough to fool friends who’ve known him his entire life, it seems.
Blaise, still leaning against the wall and not even attempting to disguise the telling bulge in his trousers, raises his hand. Other hands go up around the room, including two Slytherin 7
“So!” Blaise pipes up 15 minutes later, clapping his hands together. “Potter, what’s the deal with Granger?”
Malfoy’s ready to give up after about 15 minutes of this. “This isn’t leaving us with many options, Potter. Trelawney keeps rather odd hours, so the Divinations classroom isn’t a very good idea. The Greenhouses are too much of a cliché, but the Clock Tower is a somewhat viable option…” He trails off at the look Harry is giving him. “What?”
“Accio wand,” he says, but the wand that smacks into his other palm is definitely not his own. “Sorry, Nev!” He calls with a laugh in his voice, and then quickly aims a hefty Silencing Charm at the wall separating their rooms. He really hopes Malfoy doesn’t notice Harry’s just used his wand.
He doesn’t need, or even want, to possess Hermione. He wants what they have now, wants to love her just like this. Freely, warm and familiar, and hot, and sweet. He tells her this, kissing down her neck. He slides down the bed to kiss her tits just the way she likes.
Abruptly, Malfoy pulls out and pushes Hermione further up the bed. He climbs on after her, kneeling between her spread legs and yanking her hips toward him again. Malfoy looks up, catches Harry’s eye, and says a little breathlessly, “Salazar, Potter, are you still dressed?” And then he pushes his cock right back into Hermione’s pussy. From this new angle, Harry is able to see just about everything.
“Goes both ways, of course,” Blaise adds slyly. “For example, if you were curious about any of our Draco’s sensitive spots…”
Draco waits until Hermione’s hips stop twitching, gives her pussy a few more open-mouthed kisses, and stands. He’s still holding onto her hips, and uses his grip to lift her up, laying her out on her own workstation. He kicks her chair aside in his typical entitled fashion and begins to impatiently unbutton and discard his shirt – but leaves his Slytherin tie in place.
Ron holds up a hand to stop Harry from going on, which is just as well; Harry hadn’t a clue what to say next anyway. “Nope. Don’t want to know.”
Harry gives up trying to observe Draco’s elite oral skills and lays down next to Hermione’s hot, squirming body. She turns and gives him a little smile, and he can’t help but reach out and touch her all over. He runs a hand down her flank, across her soft, heaving belly, up between the peaks of her delicious brown tits. “God, Hermione,” he murmurs. “You’re gorgeous.”
Within the context of the Wizarding World in general, and the British Wizarding education system in particular, it’s a bit late for Harry to be selecting a field of specialized study. Harry privately gives himself a pass on this, though: when deciding to be an Auror, he’d been 15 years old, angry and already embroiled in a battle of wills with the corrupt Ministry of Magic, and that’s not even mentioning the whole ‘fates entwined with a genocidal maniac’ business. He’s pretty sure he can be forgiven for making a few short-sighted decisions back then.
