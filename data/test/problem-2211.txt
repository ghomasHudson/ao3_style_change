“Bloody lucky for Harry, is what it is, ‘Mione.” Ron cut her off.
“Don’t you
“Why not a Lady?”
“Is it better than normal chocolate?” Jamie shot right back.
There was a moment of silence as the twins artfully dodged the small town’s constable, ducking into a narrow alley, one twin pulling out what appeared to be…a garter, the portkey quickly whisking away the four of them to…an anonymous hotel room.
He stopped, frowning.
“Lemon drop?”
him…and then snog the holy fuck out of him.
“Really? I don’t think there was any media coverage of an adoption.”
Draco thought a moment. If he was going to switch the Malfoy family to the Light side, which it was looking more and more advantageous to do, it would be wise to ingratiate himself not only with Potter but with his friends.
“Father
“And he’ll know exactly where you’re sleeping. So when they all come in here, like hairy vampire-ninjas, he’s going to come right to where you’re lying asleep, and his big hairy arms are going to lift his pillow up high over you…waiting…waiting…and then their leader will give the signal…
“Ok.”
“I haven’t seen you properly naked since the Chastity Spell, so I decided to have another look.”
“Vendolius Indutiae Exigo” Draco incanted.
“Lord Draco Malfoy, Madame.” Draco introduced himself.
“~~We will still eat it when we devour the creature later!~~”
“Get him!”
“Perhaps they could be a resource. I don’t think Regulus is taking it very well, look.”
It was time Gryffindor battles that couldn’t be won gave way to Slytherin scheming and diplomacy.
“The Dark Lord is an accomplished Legilmens.”
“Confrigo! Alecto Fodius! Finite!”
“And the Dark Lord?”
The headmaster sagged a bit in his chair. Yet another sacrifice of principles for the old man. Dumbledore
“Lawyers? You’ve assigned a couple of
“Yeah man, really bad. I heard this from my Aunt Jamie, that when boys get hair in new places they turn into monsters. And they do too have hair on their arms, didn’t you see that one kid? Totally hair.”
founders, and not only ruled the House of Black but was also the direct heir of the Dark Lord.
Draco chuckled.
covering for Potter!
“I believe my son’s acquaintance just explained to you that the spell Cloud used was perfectly legal. Allow me to confirm that this is quite correct, and that while its use upon casual acquaintance is rare it is not prohibited.” Mr. Zabini said smoothly. “Now kindly remove your hand from my son before I remove it from you.”
“Well…that was…wow…I can live with that till we can get married properly.” Harry gasped.
“It’s connected to another artifact, in another location. Trust me on this, we need them both working. They’re part of my plan to ensure the Dark Lord will never bother us again.”
“Draco, my boy. How can I help you?” The headmaster asked, looking straight at Lucius as he came in.
A summation of the family assets. Twenty-four Gringott’s vaults. Shares in innumerable businesses in England and around the world. A very nice flat in London proper, and another in Knockturn Alley, vacation homes in France, Italy, Spain, Greece, and several others scattered across the preferred vacation spots of the world for the past twelve centuries. Safehouses in every reasonably-sized human population area in Europe. Four choices of bolthole, where the Malfoy family could live secretly and in style for a few generations, if necessary, to wait out troubles.
“So…you might be…
“Narcissa. Exquisite as always. Yes, that would be most welcome.” Professor Snape gave a slight bow of the head to the lady of the house, then cast a rather sullen look in Draco’s direction.
“We’d have to be sure to have pure ingredients then, there won’t be any margin for error on that.”
“It is!” Lysander whispered back. “Look, see? They’re all in bed!”
“Did Molly-wobbles call my name?” Arthur Weasley boomed from behind Draco, and suddenly he was also in the kitchen, filling up the last amount of possible space in the room that Draco hadn’t previously realized existed.
Harry followed him to the bathroom, then stood behind him, arms around him, watching them together in the mirror for a moment as he washed his hands.
“Of course. My guess is that naturally, 19 would have to end up with us, 15 for Ravenclaw, 27 for Gryffindor, and 20 for Hufflepuff. Then there are another 32 who could go either way.” Zabini handed over a binder full of profiles.
“…but Draco spends so much time on his hair…”
“Advoco Phasmatis Malfoy” Draco incanted, pointing his wand at his hand. His skin was sliced in the shape of the Malfoy crest, blood welling up and filling his palm before suddenly evaporating to swirl around them in a great silver cloud. He heard Mr. Weasley echoing his part of the spell and soon the silver cloud was joined by a bright orange one, the easily identifiable color of the Weasley hair. The two clouds circled slowly above their heads, opposite each other.
“Malfoy?”
Draco withdrew a piece of paper and handed it to his godfather.
“Wait. This is James Potter. I’m looking for his son. Harry James Potter.”
Composed, Draco took Harry’s hand again and led him along the avenue of candlesticks and rose petals back to the wide open space near where they’d eaten. He walked him to the edge of the table and the two stood staring down at the floor far, far below for a moment.
when they separated us. Like, hexes all around, and when they wrestled us down, we were biting and spitting and screaming. They kept us quarantined from each other for days, dude. Days. Opposite sides of the castle, said we were ‘co-dependent’ and needed time to ourselves.”
“Regulus and I have defeated other monsters, it’s true. Why, only a few months ago one of them attacked our baby brother, and we stopped it. We’re unbeatable!” he bragged.
“Escribamens Valetudo”
“You never did manage to learn about him, father. Don’t be hasty.”
that machine, anyways? And why was it, and the other cleaning equipment, getting off on what should be a very private and intimate moment between Harry and Draco?
“You love him.” She observed.
“Escribamens Progenies.” Draco whispered. Potter stiffened, feeling the spell, and the Weasley spotted Draco in the act of lowering his wand.
“Really?”
“Isn’t that the point of courtship?”
Reaching out, he grabbed his father fiercely, holding him close and whispering vehemently in his ear.
“Professor. Zabini. I think I’ll retire to my room, now.” Draco said politely, sweeping out the door.
the Dark Lord, not the other way around!
“You’ll get used to it. I did.”
There were wards. There were house-elves.
“Then Dumbledore must have taught him.”
“Nice catch, Potter.” He said, grudgingly. It had been a nice catch. The idiot had jumped off his broom mid-dive, right before hitting the ground, to snag the thing.
“What is it Draco?”
The other students blanched as James brandished the hissing snake, then again as he slipped into Parseltongue for the last comment.
“I don’t want you to be dead.” Draco countered. “Do you think we can compromise?”
“Yes, I want that.” Harry implored.
“It would be improper for me to tell you how to use it. I’ll say that in the hands of my ancestors, it has been used to devour wards, and on one occasion, to drain the magical energy from an enemy. Quite painful, I understand.”
have three heirs to three different legacies to produce. I think each should be born and weaned in the appropriate house. So, since Black is most urgent, with the need for a blooded Heir, and Potter has only one living generation, Malfoy would be the last. And then after all three are born and weaned, we can decide as a family where to make our chief residence.”
The boy moved forward carefully, waiting near the top step of the staircase for her.
“Hi there, you must be the new, improved Thomas Marvolo Riddle. I’m Hermione Granger-Weasley.”
“You are aware of how delicate this is.”
“What if someone questions you?”
there. Then I rode out of there through this tunnel, and met Harry and Draco like nothing had happened.”
“And what’s the recipe?”
Harry looked over Lysander.
The opening appeared and Draco ushered Blaise into his room, ignoring his smug look at being trusted with the password.
“Simply, that such permission be contingent on appropriate spells being cast
And sat back with shock, full horror across his face at what he found there.
“~~Hello, two-leg!~~”
“How?”
“Draco? You scared the hell out of me!”
The Slytherins, of course, were all having their very discreet conversations: passing veiled threats, probing mutual weaknesses, and carefully keeping an eye on Draco, wondering what kind of devious plot their Prince could be hatching this time.
“Potter! Can you stand?” Draco asked urgently.
“Please…” Draco whimpered, feeling weak as the drain on his core intensified again, the powerful beast that was Potter’s magical core demanding a stronger taste of his magic.
It was the reason the curse was an Unforgivable.
“Of course not! We’re rivals at school!” Draco retorted. “However, he has made what could be considered overtures of alliance. And there is considerable sexual tension as well, which is always helpful in this type of negotiation.”
“I hope not! But see if you can wake James, at least.”
“What are you doing?”
Voldemort eyed him skeptically.
Tom actually relaxed as he looked up into Draco’s cold eyes.
“To you doesn’t mean”
…we could offer to prove this!” it finally said.
“I have Seymour and Murdoch investigating how to properly woo a muggleborn.” He told her.
The boys appeared to be slightly winded, no doubt they had run the entire way from the Slytherin dorms. Draco frowned, considering ruffled state of both boys, but decided to ignore it. Physical activity was healthy at their age, however undignified, and Draco had conceded the argument with Harry that their children should be taught how to act like adults where necessary but not forced to by habit.
“Yes.” Draco said quietly.
when we moaned.” He shuddered.
Dizzy gasped, and immediately pulled out an ancient-looking bed-warmer, the handle of which was encrusted with jewels, and began beating herself over the head with the brass coal-pan on the end.
on us making out!”
“Your grandfather is forgiven.” Came the response.
“Nonsense, my office is right here, and much more private.” Draco said easily, and the door to the office swung open before him. “Come in, father.”
The boy considered this, then a small pleased quirked at his lips.
“About fifteen feet.” Draco agreed. “But it may be possible to stretch that, I think some experimentation is in order. Thomas?”
“But Dad did when he was a first year!”
“Of course, if you wished we could owl her, wait for her reply, and then make a
“Um…uh…yeah…”
He looked up to find Blaise watching him through closely narrowed eyes. Did he suspect?
Ron brandished his wand and started vigorously defending his de-facto girlfriend’s honor with a string of epithets. Some of them in Egyptian and Russian, Draco noticed, impressed. Clearly his older brothers had been teaching him something.
“Oh yes.” Draco said smugly. “Potter is more affected by the loss of his parents than he has made public. He longs desperately for a family, and this is what I have offered him. The protection of a strong wizard, not the powerful father-figure you may one day represent to him, in the more distant future, but it is a symbol of what might be. He cares little for its Darkness.”
“With
“Draco. I told you, we can’t do that.”
The boy rushed on
And now it was finally time to go.
Draco forced himself to relax.
“This is another wizarding courtship tradition, that is used when the parties negotiating a marriage contract both happen to be Lords of their bloodlines. Extremely rare, of course, I found it in a very obscure volume in the family library.”
“But Potter
“What? Why?”
“And what of
Lacewing? But…surely not…she couldn’t have been more than a first or second year, maybe third! Polyjuice was a NEWT potion!
“But it
“Mmmm. I’m glad it made you happy.” Draco said, kissing Harry feverishly.
“Should we be concerned?” Harry asked, casting a glance towards the doorway, where the sounds of Thomas and Cloud amusing the infant with funny noises could be plainly heard.
Regulus shrugged ambiguously at his newly-acquired well-wishers and sycophants, watching his twin across the room, waiting patiently for him to join him at the Gryffindor table.
“Stay calm, dear. Don’t jump to conclusions yet. This boy doesn’t seem to behave anything like
“Go ahead, Lucius.” Draco smirked.
“He’s my pet turtle. Look.”
He was echoed by hundreds of similar gasps as the Great Hall collectively got their daily headlines.
Pomfrey let out a little gasp, but brandished her wand.
“Ssssee? Thissss I have told you again and again! And even Jamessss has ssssaid it many timessss, but issss only punissssshed!”
Draco did a few arithmancy calculations on a scrap of paper…there.
“I am Thomas Marvelo Slytherin, and pleased to make your acquaintance.”
snakes!”
Draco just smiled grimly as he counted the time until the door opened again.
“Escribamens vis Vires” Draco incanted softly, as he passed by Potter’s spot.
“I…feel most confident leaving this in the hands I’ve laid it in. If they consult you or wish to examine it, that is their prerogative. But for me…no, I have well learned that I am not equipped to involve myself with such matters. I will do as they suggest, nothing more.”
Draco pecked him on the lips and stood straight.
Tom froze as a cage of energy formed around him.
As if to prove his point, there was suddenly a much louder explosion, much nearer, and the teachers could be heard chanting counterspells and curses in return.
Draco smirked.
“Lucius?”
“So…if that’s not it…what else did you mean, that I’m going to have to wait for?”
It was stronger than the one to the rest of the Weasleys, excluding Ron.
“That’s not how these things are done-” Draco objected, stopping dead as his stomach let loose with another inhuman-sounding growl.
“That’s entirely unacceptable. We’ll just have to change it to something appropriate. How about Polaris Capricus Black?”
Draco tried to imagine his father as friends with a Muggle, but after a moment found himself gaping foolishly at her.
“That’ll be Scorpius, I suppose.”
Draco glared at his father.
“Do you want me to stay and keep you company?”
He took careful note of their measurements…how long were the arms, the legs, how large the heads and how tall…before he tapped his wand in his palm and cast the additional spells on their inert forms.
Zabini” or “
“There.
“What?” Potter asked shakily.
Stepping carefully around pieces of detritus, Draco retrieved the marriage contract he and Potter had signed.
“I…I mean…um…” He closed his eyes. “Thank you. Malfoy.”

“Draco, darling! How did it-” Narcissa faltered as she saw her son’s grey eyes brimming with anger and disappointment. “Draco?”
“What about your best friend?” one of the other boys nudged him with an elbow.

“Good morning, are you a first-year too?” A cultured but young voice inquired from behind him.
“Mate,
“I guess.” Harry said, sounding annoyed the secret had gotten out.
“This is blood magic. Dark.”
“To figure it out”
“Very cute.” Draco sneered. “And in the meantime, shouldn’t you be feeding Scorpius?”
“He has Moony!” Susie shouted, horrified.
A knock at the door proved his husband had been monitoring that damn map Draco wasn’t allowed to use. (Something about him being too prim and proper to be allowed such an instrument of chaos…whatever that meant – a map that showed the location of every being in the castle seemed the
“That’s it! Those slimy bastards have done something to the Hat!” Ron Weasley bellowed with rage.
“Oh? I believe I just
“Did he now? Hmm, no he’s not pleased then. Perhaps he’s finally realized he’s out of options.” Draco said just loud enough to reach only Blaise’s ears.
Draco thought a moment.

The Manor paused.
“What?”
“Masssster wissshed to know the words the fatherssss sssspoke in sssssecret.” The Dreamer added.
“Oh. I can handle it then.”
“Has he been tested yet?”
They both leaned forward…
Draco gave him a long, measuring look.
Draco beamed at the Gryffindor.
He looked at the doorway the invisible Gryffindor would certainly enter through.
Tom leaned over him and offered a finger.
, remember?”
“That’s really creepy when you talk like that, James.”
With Lucius in Azkaban, Draco claims his inheritance.
“What do you mean?”
“Harry.”
Jonas grinned a bit smugly.
“You’re not his brother. I am.”
Draco held his breath as the door to the Great Hall slowly creaked open, the entry appearing to be empty.
“There’d be no limit to what could be done with such knowledge.” Draco finished for her with a smirk. “And since the Muggles have already gone through this breakthrough, I think all we need is someone familiar enough with how
“And after Las Vegas, we’ve booked your passage on a week-long cruise!”
“What spell?”
Potter looked at him carefully, eyes narrowed, then nodded.

Potter’s eyes suddenly narrowed.
! Are you mad? How could you do something like this to your own son, the Malfoy
Potter screamed as Draco swallowed his erection, his entire body going rigid as Potter’s magic slammed into his skull from the point of contact.
The two nodded respectfully as they were ushered into his room.
She tapped her wand on their wrists and the red ribbon burned and faded, and they were done.
“Be nice, Draco.” He scolded.
Lucius drew in a deep breath at the barb, but pressed forward.
The twins found themselves thrown backwards again, and recovering themselves, immediately split to opposite sides of the room to divide the boy’s attention.
“That was…a very, very foolish thing for me to do. God, Potter, if you weren’t so powerful I’d be dead or a squib right now.” Draco gasped.
Draco suddenly had an image of himself lying in wait for Harry Potter, grabbing hold of his robes and yanking him back behind a random statue, those green eyes widening with shock as Draco plunged his tongue into the Gryffindor’s mouth…

He released his godfather’s hand, relieved that ordeal was over.
would never let…”
“Thomas…
“I just came from meeting with him.”
“A brilliant deduction.”
Blaise nodded, knowing the Malfoy family history in France. The importance of allying oneself with the winning side was drilled into every pureblooded child.
“You don’t really have a choice.” Draco told him thoughtfully.
“For Harry Potter.”
Three hours later, Harry woke up from his nap and found Draco still seated at the massive vanity, carefully applying the third layer of charms to his gleamingly straight hair with a silver comb and his wand.
Draco smiled, and started informing Kreacher of what he wanted.
is in fact another descendant of the Founder?”
For the first time Flint smiled in honest delight.
“The Malfoy family is one of those institutionalized patriarchal hierarchies that still remain despite the advent of liberalized feminism, Granger. My father isn’t fit to lead because he cannot represent the family to the wizarding world. He will follow my lead, as long as he wishes to remain a Malfoy.”
“Good one, ‘Mione. Or, Trelawny’s secret love-child, and he’s having a vision! Or he’s from the future! Or- OW!”
“Well that’s the only thing bloodlines and money can’t buy. Time will tell. I’m done with my hair, let’s go tell our friends our news.”
“I wouldn’t mind. If you weren’t…insane, like him. You could be a little bit Darker.”
“Very well. I’ll take it. I need the information.”
Draco looked at him contemplatively, concern knitting a line between his eyebrows.
Potter blinked. Opened his mouth to answer…and then snapped it shut, that angry look flaring up again.
“That would be Malfoy-Potter, now.” Draco said smugly. “And it worked.”
“Yes but…not like that.”
“That was beautiful! For just a moment I don’t think I had any thoughts at all! I’ll have to remember this for the next Wrackspurts attack! Thank you!”
And, he realized, he was himself shaking with agony at seeing Harry’s pain. It didn’t bother him that Harry grew hard at torture. No doubt, Voldemort’s alien pleasure was transmuted over the link to a form Harry’s mind and body could interpret.
“Harry James Potter! You haven’t been eating properly! Look at you, I can see your ribs sticking out!” she poked suspiciously at Harry’s stomach.
“Tom, you are…what is left of a very old, powerful, evil wizard.” Harry said carefully.
“He’s not even awake.”
“Like what?”
The odd thing was, it was true. The supposed savior of the wizarding world smelled of stale sweat. Draco’s eyes narrowed, taking in his rival. Harry Potter looked…neat and clean and entirely un-Potter.
“Petrificus Totalis!” Draco froze in position and toppled to the side. Potter leaped up, about to tackle him when an Impedimentia curse hit him.
Draco had no doubt there were plenty of grubby hands in the Ministry just itching for a chance at the vaults.
“Draco?”
Harry’s eyes widened in shock, and in a flash he had turned and sprinted to their bedroom to retrieve the heirloom.
Draco held his wand carefully behind his back as his mother and her sister curtsied deeply. Bringing his hand around slowly, wand still stretched out behind his leg, his left hand with the Malfoy ring stretching out for first his mother to kiss, then Bellatrix…
“Never fear my pretty ladies…OW!” Fred recoiled as Draco kicked him in the shins.
Good grief. Had the boy
that could be given wisely, was by integrating one’s allies into one’s own plans.
“What are those?” Draco pointed to the symbols running along the top of the page.
Draco let out a growl and tossed the useless book into the fire, where it quickly joined the pile of Harlequin novels in the process of becoming ashes.
Draco nodded.
Tom went rigid as memories assailed him.
“Quick! Grab your hardest pillow and put the others under the covers! We’ll group up in my bed. Go-go-go-go-go!”
Hexes flew at them, hitting Potter in the back, and Draco felt his magic pulled into the Talisman to form a powerful shield.
“And how would you know his origins?” Harry demanded sharply.
“You’ll know what I’m talking about. Best if these things are not spoken of aloud. Or in writing. When you find them, contact me and I will receive you at Malfoy Manor to take them off your hands.”
“What kind of curse is it?”
Hermione cast a quick diagnostic spell.
“Expelliarmus!”
The old woman leaned forward to whisper.
Jonas shook his head, turning to join the queue. Lucius decided to accompany him, but was distracted by a strange tingling sensation in his left arm. His left forearm.
His housemates stood by, a little star-struck as Harry Potter-Malfoy knelt to give his son a bone-popping bear hug.
Severus ignored him.
Tom shrugged, it was what he’d expected.
But why the hell was Potter afraid of Draco? That made no sense.
“Not unless you keep it down for hours. I’ll personally make sure you regurgitate every last bit of it right after class ends.” Draco promised.
“Haha, I can’t believe he just fainted!”
“Ah. Of course.” George stuttered, pulling out his wand.
On consummation, the magic in Potter’s core would rush into Draco like a burning tide of pure alcohol, while Potter devoured Draco’s own magic that was like a fine wine.
“Um…hang on.” Potter fished out a Chocolate Frog, opening it and snatching the animated sweet before it could escape. Potter handed the empty box to Draco, who reached for the invisible edge of the cloak and pulled it up.
There was no response.
His father looked down at him disapprovingly.
. I am not going to speculate with
Tom blinked.
No. He would be the Lord Draco Malfoy, with all the icy power and carefully measured familial love that that exalted title expected. And his father would know that he had at least succeeded in one of his life’s works.
Draco felt himself suddenly growing hard.
“Dinner is in ten minutes.” The old woman informed him quietly, giving a small gesture in the direction of the romping children as she turned to reenter the guesthouse.
“She just said”
“Alright then. I guess I’m going to have to find things out for myself.”
Draco looked at his father. The man was proud, as any Malfoy was proud. But it seemed he was capable of admitting his mistakes. The despair that came of doing so was a testament to that pride. But…in time, once that pride was knocked down a bit more it could one day be rebuilt.
“But that’s four Slytherins in a row! They’re stealing all the first years!”
Draco allowed his erection to graze Potter’s backside briefly, causing Potter to moan and shake, a stab of that same energy slicing into his groin from the point of contact, burning in his veins. Merlin,
“I’ve come to make my intentions clear, regarding the war.”
Harry sighed.
Jamie put her hands on her hips in mock dismay.
careful tapping in yet another section of his Occlumency shields.
“Don’t forget the swear jar, Harry.” He called out to his husband, and was pleased to hear the clink of a Galleon joining its brothers in the jar a moment later.
Draco wasn’t surprised.
“Well he could certainly do worse than Blaise’s son.”
Nodding once in return, Draco accioed the tiny bonding knife from his pile of clothing and carefully cut the binding runes into his skin, just above the left hipbone.
(See the end of the chapter for
“In fact, I think you already want me bad enough to wait.”
Draco didn’t move, staring into those swirling orbs until Jamie gently pulled him along with the other Slytherins in a tactical retreat.
“The Dark Lord knows. Dumbledore knows. Nobody else is powerful enough to interfere.”
Draco’s eyes widened in recognition of the familiar phrase.
“What do you mean, not
“Show yourselves!”
Then he was gone.
“What, Harry?”
“Good. You’ll teach me this spell now.” Draco commanded.
“I sincerely doubt that.” Draco said dryly. “Considering Granger seems to be quite the prude.”
, I’d say so, yes. Quite balanced.” Draco said coldly.
“Ow! Reducto!”
Harry looked at him for a long moment, then his jaw dropped.
“What are these other symbols?”
“You’re teaching him Occlumency.”
“I am their adopted son.”
“Malfoy! That was excellent! Did you see him bleeding? What made you think to strike him physically? Is Potter in trouble for trying to kill you?” Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were suddenly at his side, bursting with questions.
“I’m guessing you’re one of Luna’s children?”
His voice was scratchy from disuse. How long had he been here? Weeks? Months? Time didn’t seem to mean much in this cold, empty place.
The scar appeared briefly, exaggerated and incredibly ugly. The glasses were suddenly huge and clunky on his face. And…there was a strange visible energy sizzling around him, making him look…freakish. Draco reached out towards the picture and…a lightning bolt flashed out, searing pain registering in Draco’s senses as a small bit of skin on his hand was actually burnt to ash.
Draco thought. The words were too well considered to be the result of only the revelation about wandless magic. Severus had to know something more. Dumbledore must have told him something. Or possibly even Potter himself.
“Wait, what about your other mission?”
got Draco’s attention.
“Undoubtedly. These are generational magics, my Lord. The core of every Malfoy buried in our cemeteries is joined together as the power of the Malfoy blood magic. No wizard, not even Merlin, could stand against the Malfoy magic while standing on Malfoy land.”
“I expect these to be held in utmost confidence.”
Voldemort raised a finger approvingly.
~The Sword of Gryffindor~
Interesting. His godfather. So that’s how Potter ended up with the Black estate.
“I know, it’s our fault for not letting them see him sooner.” Harry said.
Harry sighed.
Cloud froze for a moment, his face going into that careful blank state Draco used sometimes as his mind came to grips with what he’d just heard.
“Would that not be something to behold.” Severus murmured, only half in jest.
how each ingredient affects the magical properties of the potion!” Granger chattered excitedly, forgetting who she was lecturing.
“Meaning, he’s going to be driven to extremes, and he’s going to be dramatic.” Harry grinned.
after all), and surreptitiously shooting grooming charms at his husband’s hair when he wasn’t looking (well…
“Now see here, I think this is hardly the time for making promises and binding oaths, boys.”
And probably, maybe, try to repair a few bridges with Potter in the meantime. He could always burn them again later, if necessary.
“I’d be disappointed if I couldn’t still manage it on occasion. Oh, to be simpleminded and see the world in only two shades.” Draco smirked.
“What? Are you insane?”
Oh, navigating,
“I never said I did. However as the new Lord Malfoy I have important strategic decisions to make for the Family. And it looks to me like something is going on with a…as much as I despise you…a key figure in the war. So, out with it Potter. Who’s been working you over all summer?”
He just barely heard Granger mutter behind him.
“Thank you for an exquisite dinner, Mrs. Weasley. I hope I will be allowed to return the privilege in the near future.” Draco thanked her politely.
His skin felt the cool night air as Harry cut away the back of his robes.
“Is Jamie-”
There were a few titters from, Lucius guessed, the magical students in the room.
In an instant the wand disappeared, and the strange boy whirled around to console the baby.
“Well. Regulus, James, perhaps we could have involved you more in the birthing process. I suppose it’s not every day another heir is added to the family. But to break into the nursery in the dead of night, and upset one of the family ghosts-”
“Hello, Granger? Listen, I have something of an odd request for you. So sorry about doing this at the last minute, but do you think you could get someone into the University’s hybrid magic program for this year? Yes, an adult. My father. Don’t worry about that, we know plenty of people in MLE, we’ll have it commuted to parole and community service by then. No, I don’t think he’s ready to choose a specialty yet, he’s kept up on current developments but he really just needs some immersion into the new ways of thinking about magic. Yes, I can send them. Can you? Great. Great! Yes, we’re just about to take the boys, we’ll pick up his books while we’re out. Of course we’re still on, but perhaps we could move it to somewhere a bit less plebian, don’t you think? Of
“Harry? What’s he talking about?” Granger asked. Harry ignored her.
It would not shake. It. Would. Not.
“In that case, I’ll still want to minimize my audience, in case of slips. The Headmaster, the Head Auror, and another Auror of your choosing. And all under an Oath for secrecy of any details that don’t bear directly on the Azkaban escape.” Draco negotiated.
“Um. I guess she’d like it. If it was…you know…
“Who is that!” Tom called out sharply, reaching for his wand.
“Jamie? Would you like to be a Marauder?”
Fuck.
Not that that complex explanation would soothe Harry’s fears. Fears reinforced over how many years of Dark-themed wet-dreams from the Dark Lord!
“No goodbye kiss.” He said apologetically, “That charm will be pretty vicious for a while, we’ll have to avoid each other for the rest of the day.”
Draco stood up suddenly.
Draco entered a…well…a library. Of sorts. In place of bookshelves, the walls were lined with a latticework of pigeon holes, stacked closely together from floor to ceiling. Draco could see that each hole contained a scroll, and bore a label inscribed on small plates of either brightly polished silver, a tarnished bronze, or a very utilitarian-looking steel.
Draco caught up in time to hear Harry and Granger pleading with Ron that suicide really

about Sirius. I could tell her all about him and--”
“Oh my God! He’s beautiful isn’t he?” Jamie whispered in awe.
“Mr. Malfoy, it seems your potion has had an unusually powerful effect. Mind telling me what you changed from the original recipe?” Professor Snape sounded amused.
“And what happened to your hand?”
“Nooo!” Edgar wails in horror.
, Potter! Everyone is fucking terrified! Or at least, the ones with some common
Draco was silent.
“Are your eyes still closed?” Draco asked suddenly. Harry’s arm tensed with guilty startlement under his hand, and Draco pulled him to a stop and leaned in to talk low in his ear.
“… having amazing sex over in Suite 301!”
“You’re not going to tell me what this is about?”
He had severely miscalculated.
The mouth curled into a contemplative smile.
His hand slid forward to the top of the thigh, and he could feel Harry trembling under his touch. He realized he himself was trembling and his penis was painfully hard inside his trousers.
For once in his life, Potter completely ignored Draco, and zoomed right in on Jamie.
“I do not!”
“Yes Master Draco! Is Master Draco wishing to see all of them together?”
“But how are you feeling, Lucius? Draco wrote that he was very concerned about you, keeping yourself to your rooms at all hours? I hope the addition of two powerful new grandsons has broken you from your melancholy!” Jamie asked.
The boy looked up at the two adults for direction, and just got an encouraging nod from Harry.
The two wizards turned to Tom. The boy held Scorpius protectively, a wand held in a shaking fist, as if to ward them off.
“Shhh, I know it’s strange. But a powerful Dark Lord doesn’t come into being under a lace canopy, Potter. You are immensely powerful, and you are the Heir of two Founders. Any but the most powerful bonding ceremonies would be…unstable. And as powerful as you are, you wouldn’t be able to prevent yourself from turning me into…something less than I am.” Draco said calmly.
“Of course, of course. Quite.” Dumbledore agreed, and drawing his wand, passed it several times over Tom’s head, muttering under his breath. The others could hear a few words of these apparently invisible scrying spells, but they sounded suspiciously like ‘fiddlement’ and ‘oddment’ and ‘tweak’.
Draco eyed them warily for a moment.
“Draco! What are you doing here?”
“First-years are not allowed their own brooms. You know that.” Draco said tonelessly. It was an old argument.
Jonas didn’t miss the expression.
“No…I just was afraid something would happen to him and I wouldn’t be there to protect him.”
“Harry. Cruciatis
powerful. If the breeding fails -
“They’re closed!” Harry protested.
“The Ministry.”
, his green eyes filling Draco’s vision and his hand slipping behind his neck and there wasn’t any lust because it didn’t burn when Harry’s soft lips brushed against his own and then pressed against him like purest warmest silk that made something painful and needy turn over inside his chest and he dared not move for fear Harry might stop kissing him…
“On our honeymoon, I’ll take you to a small villa I know in Greece. We’ll wed in a beautiful tiny chapel with white flowers everywhere. Get on our knees in our best robes and pledge our lives to each other.”
Draco, of course, knew the pattern. His mother was raised in this house after all.
“But I’m not a part of some evil wizard! I’m just a kid! I just found out I was a wizard today!” Tom protested.
Draco couldn’t think properly.
“I saw your wand out.”
Tom considered a moment, then gave his friend a warm smile.
“Oh my god, please don’t tell people!”
“Well…they’re still ninjas. And with their longer, hairier arms, we’ll be at a disadvantage.” He explained logically. “I expect that, no matter what we do, we’re all going to die a very slow and painful death. BUT the key is to go down in Hufflepuff Dorm history having taken at least one of them down with us! Now, who’s with me?!” He cried.
“If Potter is an Occlumens…” the professor said slowly.
Slowly he pulled it out, feeling the corner of his mouth tug at the irony of the title.
“They will?”
There really wasn’t any decision to make anymore.
“Ssssso the father called Draco worked a great magic to take the venom from that head’s fangsssss, and believed that head was destroyed by doing thisssss.” The Dreamer said.
Lucius doubted he and Jonas were talking about the same part of Boston, however.
“Fine. Leave your gift and be gone.”
“He wasn’t mad?”
Still. The place had been part of the Malfoy holdings for centuries, and as one of the family “secret places” it held a certain special force of generational magic. Severely depleted, for future generations, due to this unprecedented alien occupancy, Draco thought sourly.
Draco reached a hand into his pocket and allowed his fingers to curl around the spine of the book he’d taken from the Black library.
“It’s never simple, Harry. But let me deal with the ugly parts of it. I just…Harry…you
Lucius obliged, glaring at the ball-point pen his son innocently offered him before pacing into the library and checking off several texts with an old-fashioned quill.
“And so on! For the entire summer!”
Draco nearly groaned aloud, and quickly cast a nonverbal privacy charm on himself.
Draco stepped inside, into the middle of a heated argument.
Several flights of steps later, the endless winding stair emerged into a dimly lit hallway of several anonymous-looking doors. Draco paused.
“Oh, you misunderstand me, Madame. I’m a Malfoy first, I wouldn’t manipulate such a prize solely for the benefit of Black.”
“Well…that’s something for me and Draco to have words about, Ron.”
“Oh, I’m afraid you’re quite mistaken. I don’t think a single chest would do at all.”
Potter nodded.
“Welcome to all of our new postgraduate students! If you will look around you will see that you are surrounded by the very best and brightest from all around the world… I hope you will all take this opportunity to connect with the future leaders of the global community!”
Potter standing before him, larger than life, stance wide, wand out, firing spells over Draco’s head at Bellatrix.
“We were just about to call you. Draco has a possible theory, we’ll need to brainstorm them all.”
There was another commotion as Dumbledore revealed the girl’s connection to Sirius Black.
“Wait a minute. How do you know about the Marauders Map!”
Lucius smirked “A significant portion of my family fortune may be attributed to early investments in the modern broomstick industry. I assure you the depictions in your literature, which would have come from before the concealment charms became standardized, are no more representative of a Firebolt than a piece of chalk is of one of these elegant devices.” Lucius held up the fancy fountain pen he was taking notes with.
Shacklebolt and Moody stared at him, stunned.
“Egypt. Business. Tired.” He gingerly accepted the marmalade-smeared toast she handed him.
BANG…BANG…Ka-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-KA-BANG-BANG-BANG!
Severus let out the breath he’d been holding and withdrew his hand from the phone, observing it as it hovered before him.
Draco paused, then nodding to accept the compliment and the implied apology. He considered his father.
“So they won’t kill us?” Edgar asked, hopefully.
“Draco.”
“A family.” Harry agreed, eyes shining. Draco resisted a sudden urge to pull the boy into his lap.
“And throughout the entire magical world!”
“We’ve been fighting for a long time.”
“Merlin, you were right. It’s going to be hard.” He muttered, and started re-evaluating the strength of the precautionary spells he’d planned. Would the raw strength of Harry’s lustful magic overwhelm them?
He stopped short, seeing the two twins crouched on opposite ends of the room.
“Malfoy.”
“So what, we just sit here and wait for the Death Eaters to show up?”
“Excuse me? Maybe I can help.” Tom interjected politely.
“I’ll make sure the spell is appropriately phrased. I don’t think Potter expects me to take a Killing Curse for him. Perhaps something potions-based.”
It was, in fact a dump. And yes, hand-me-down clothes were clearly visible. The grandfather clock with the hands for each family member…including Harry, Draco noticed…was likely once a lovely piece but had not aged well. The tracking spell indicating the location of the family members looked like an interesting application of some of the more extreme familial magical spells but nothing terribly powerful.
And Malfoys, especially the Lords of Malfoy,
“Muggles figured out a way to convert between them, between them.”
Draco took Harry’s arm and turned them away from the table.

The young man’s eyes jerked to meet hers at that, startled awareness showing in them before they swiftly pinned themselves back to the other boy, some nameless struggle behind them as he watched his friend’s carefree behavior.
The twins cackled as Molly Weasley scolded them for their obscene joke, and Harry led Draco away by the hand, leading him quickly into a convenient closet.

“I’ll be okay…just need a minute…” Draco whispered hoarsely.
Draco wandered back towards the popular areas until he found the library again.
“Not at all sir, I would have done the same. Thank you for your aid, I doubt Mr. Archer would have taken my explanation seriously if you had not intervened.”
Lucius paused.
“You’re
a Slytherin. But we can establish some basic level of trust necessary to complete our negotiations and…enable the bond.” He whispered the last part.
“I still think it has to be the Gloryflowers. They’re the most prestigious Light family besides Dumbledore, and they’d be using one of the Greek rituals at their age.” Pansy was saying.
“Okay. I have no idea how to do that.”
“And at the end, my grandfather asks if a living portrait of your father exists?”
“No, I mean do you think we’ll be
Instead he just shook his head in dismissal.
Draco scanned over the many symbols and faces until he found one…concentrated on it.

Fred suddenly noticed his twin had given away the game and fled, and grabbed his own.
“I’m sure Dumbledore has. And probably the Dark Lord. Probably why he’s been so anxious to kill him every year since he came back to the wizarding world.” Blaise said thoughtfully.
A moment later Ron was grinning down at him maliciously.
He kept a hand on Harry’s arm under the Cloak as he whispered to where he knew his ear would be.
“What about the exiled purebloods?” Zabini asked.
“He is a Malfoy.” He said, simply

A door appeared in the corner, the Room responding to his wish. Draco quickly pulled his robes shut as Jamie came in, gasping when she saw his hand.

Minutes later, Jaimie had finished her role as bonder and stepped out of the room to find her Gryffindor friends.
Lucius frowned.
Draco leaned in and placed his lips against Harry’s cheek next to his ear.
“Have our barristers meet me in my office in thirty minutes.”
Draco smirked.
He perused it quickly before handing it to Lucius.
“What are these?”
The other Slytherins (aside from Blaise, who knew who must be the cause of such behavior) were carefully keeping their distance, while watching furtively, and reviewing their own interactions with Draco for the past several weeks, hoping that they were not the targets of the undoubtedly elaborate scheme percolating in their Prince’s mind.
, Mr. Potter.” McGonagal said sternly.
The two young men in the middle, oblivious to the others as the priest directed their vows.
“Well, if you’re aware and are alright with it, then I suppose that’s fine.”
Draco smirked at him as he landed in a tumble nearly at his feet.
the snakes hissed rapturously, momentarily united in their excitement over the idea.
“I, I have so many questions about your family, but that would be so improper! But, the other thing is, how did you come to be with them?”
And Draco was about to give it to the biggest trouble-magnet alive.
“I’m completely serious. Under the doctrine of
Draco relaxed.
Draco shook his head. Weird, having another’s thoughts in his head, especially when they related to his worst enemy in such a fond fashion.
“No, Kreacher. Show me the artifact.”
Obviously. Once they were purged that one night, their souls’ imprint on the wand was gone forever.
Fenrir sidled up to him and…
The desperation in his voice echoed back at him.
“Yeah, Father is like that with people while he’s married. Once I tried to tell him it’s gross to stick his tongue in someone else’s mouth, but then he started telling me all these other horrible
“But her parents are dentists.”
“Yes, he is certainly all that Malfoy can hope for in a powerful young scion.” Lucius backtracked carefully. “You have done extremely well for the family, Draco. I would never complain.”
Even the Ravenclaw sounded bored.
The infant looked up at him with vivid green eyes.
“Malfoy thinks I’m…a
, is a Dark talisman.” Draco told her wearily, nodding at the tiny bundle of knotted ribbon.
“You said the spell was Escribamens. How is that related to Legilmens and Occlumens?”
The twins and Draco snickered - even Tom smiled at that one.
“Why do you think that?”
“Oh. It’s public knowledge. It just wasn’t an alliance.” Draco said smugly. “Just a bit of magic gone wrong.”
“Expelliarmus!”
“No thank you.”
Harry saw that his husband was right. After several moments of horrified silence, James had started to interact with his new housemates. As he watched, Harry saw his son laugh with a group of boys his own age, though not as long or hard as the others.
Draco shoved his husband in retaliaton, but could not help the lift in the corner of his mouth at the thought.
“Harry, Granger told me to be honest with you. And…I really don’t think it’s a good idea, but she said it was absolutely the most important thing that I always am honest with you.”
Potter sounded a bit shocked now.
Carefully, the twins crept forward and flattened themselves on either side of the door, conferring in harsh whispers.

“I…Seymour, isn’t your secretary married to a Half-blood?”
Harry Potter looked terrible. Dark lines under his eyes, his face was pale, his adam’s apple bobbed as his eyes slowly focused on the two intruders.
“How long ago was this?”
Harry’s words devolved into a loud, low groan as his entire body suddenly bucked, his limbs going stiff and his face contorting into an almost pained expression as his penis expanded in Draco’s hand, firing several white ropes of his seed across his bare chest.
“We’d learn a lot.” He suggested.
The bubbling, muddy mixture in the cauldron seemed pretty obvious, though.
The Dark Lord’s eyes narrowed at his continued refusal to address him as
Draco rolled his eyes. The idiots were still confusing the legitimate rationale of blood-politics with the ignorant group-politics spouted by the half-blood Dark Lord many of their parents followed.
Jamie laughed at the obvious parroting of the infant’s more dignified parent.
“Alistor. That was uncalled for.” Dumbledore said gently, and came forward to heal the wound.
“Oh, Harry…yessssss!” Draco moaned, the pulsing length of hard flesh was burning his insides with magic and he felt swollen and full and burning with inner fire and Harry, Harry, Harry on top of him and Harry’s smell around him and Harry’s power racing through him, and Harry’s wonderful manhood buried deep, deep inside him.
His godfather’s carefully worded advice struck him.
“He is
acceptable.”

“Hortenson. And…Black.”
“I’m sorry Draco…please,
“Now, if you two are quite done pawing at each other, please do find a room, and use the appropriate spells beforehand? Ronald’s mother would never forgive him if the two of you had penetrative intercourse while Ron was busy with me.”
Potter’s erection, slimy with pre-ejaculate, nudged into the crack of his butt behind him.
Tonks grinned back at him.
“That’s because she divorced in time to-”
“Well I suppose there is that, though I wasn’t aware they had the facilities to go beyond mathematical theory here.”
“Look on your Blood gift from your Husband, Potter.” He commanded sternly.
“My apologies young man. It seems I was in error.”
“Maybe…maybe he didn’t have to become Voldemort, then. If Riddle…if Tom had had a family…” he stopped.
Jonas scratched his head awkwardly,
Tom raised his eyebrows.
The article was a bit…
Draco turned to him with a smirk.

“Yes, I suppose I am.”

Lucius calmed down, understanding that argument at least.
“What sort of form?”
“Death Eater. Murderer. Escaped convict. Yes. And yet also my father.”
Draco looked down at the plate. He’d tried to take only one of the gigantic but dangerously delicious flapjacks, but Molly had forced three,
A sharp tightening of the face. Yes. This one knew whatever history caused the desperate tone of joyfulness in the other’s laughter.
“Severus, you’ll need to compartmentalize when dealing with young Thomas. I know you have had difficulty  with this in the past, do you think it will be a problem now?”
In minutes, Tom realized he would do anything, kill anything, to protect Scorpius.
“Quite! At long last, an heir of Malfoy!” Lucius took the infant from her and smiled grimly at the tuft of blonde hair.
“Isss thisss ssso?”
“The…contents…artifacts and heirlooms?”
“My name’s Jamie.”
“Let’s go.”
Tom wasn’t sure what to think of it. Apparently his new little brother, ‘Scorpius’, already had a family in place. They were clearly wizards, and that was quite literal – somehow
Draco crossed to him and brushed a finger down his cheek.
“Good, those are enough to start with. Now we combine them.” Draco whispered into Potter’s ear. The other boy nodded, and Draco quickly stepped to the right, whirling around with an ugly slashing spell as Potter incanted something behind him, then Potter’s hand made that slight tug at his robes and Draco followed, pivoting in the opposite direction, no Death Eaters, so he transfigured a blade of grass to glass and enchanted it to fly around stabbing any Dark Mark it could find.
Draco leaned down, his words urgent. He knew his husband was humoring him for now, but it was only a matter of time before Harry’s innate Gryffindor-ness inspired him to be horrified at the insidious seeds of self-preservation Draco was planting in their youngest son.
“Did you expect me to spend the rest of holidays sulking in my room?” he asked, amused.
Ollivander used his wand to levitate Voldemort’s wand out of the receptacle so that it hovered just above the surface.
“Very well. Thank you, my lord. I Heroditus Nott challenge Heir’s-Mate Malfoy for right of dominion, to bind the lesser family for one generation, in recompense for the ill done my line.”
The Head Auror paused, stunned at the rebuke.
But Harry Potter was just standing there, staring at the tabletop as if it held a hundred mysteries, lightly holding the thorny rose by the stem with one hand while the other lightly stroked the soft petals with an absent-minded thumb.
Lucius’ eyes hardened at Draco’s casual mention of their respective roles as decider and advisor, but nodded, the resentment bitten back in the bitter knowledge that this was proper.
“Oooooh! Pretty hair!”
“Potter…” Draco croaked, and Potter’s head shot up and he was suddenly on Draco, kissing him feverishly across his face.
“You can’t adopt him away from us!”
“And wasn’t he?” Draco said conversationally. “I wouldn’t know, I wasn’t present when he got himself killed. Potter?”
“This is…this is…but…
Harry’s eyes sparkled with delight at the doll-sized servings, and Draco quickly joined him, daintily picking through the appetizer.
“Harry. Even if you weren’t the Lord of two of the wealthiest estates in Britain, and I the Lord of another, you’re fucking
Harry Potter, who had been watching this byplay rather helplessly was suddenly looming large, the air crackling with his magic.
not do that in front of me?”
“Really? How bizarre. I seem to remember some fuss about that from a few muggleborns during my own Hogwarts years, I suppose. You wouldn’t want to approach them yourself, then.”
Draco thought back to the self-loathing that was mixed in with the feelings of lust and love, when he’d found that item on the Conditions chart. Not to mention Potter crying in despair after wanking himself silly over Draco.
“I don’t trust the ferret, Harry.” Weasley was saying, grabbing the envelope from an outstretched talon. Helios nearly overbalanced, feathers ruffling as he flapped his wings in protest of the rough treatment.
- - - - -
Draco noticed the small signs of nervousness starting to show as he approached.
Draco tried to take his hand in his, but Harry crossed his arms defensively in front of himself, refusing to meet Draco’s eyes.
Let his mother deal with that. Fathers need respect from their sons, not sympathy.
“What?”
And Draco had already betrayed to him that he was having doubts about joining the Dark Lord. The Escribamens spell
“I believe that would be twenty points from Gryffindor for having the audacity to disparage familial ties while talking to an orphan child about her parents. Ten points from Gryffindor for trying to pick a fight with a first year, you should be ashamed of yourselves. And five points for being out of your seats in the middle of the feast. Please excuse yourselves.”
“I’m sure you know you’re playing a dangerous game, Draco. What about everything you said back in September? Aren’t you going to stay out of it?”
“What plansssss are these?”
“His father led mine to put everything into certain investments, both political and economic, and then Lord Malfoy made all of those investments worse than worthless. He ruined our family.”
“But…then why am I poor?” she asked.
“Yes Master Draco! Kreacher will do as Master is asking!”
Draco leaned forward and spoke into the juncture of Potter’s thigh, his breath carrying into his pubic hairs around his scrotum.
“Invited to dinner with…Malfoy!” Granger read over Potter’s shoulder.
Robes swirling behind and around him, showing off glimpses of the rich, dark, glowing green of his rare dragonhide boots and belt, drawing attention to his toned legs and slender hips. A flash of silver, the Malfoy crest on his hand, now wearing the long ponytail of purebred Lordship…Draco knew he held the ladies of Hogwarts in the palm of his hand.
Pansy’s face was white.
Once the door was shut, and a foolproof Muffliato applied to it, Harry rounded on Draco.
Harry looked up at him, a thousand emotions spinning through those eyes, opened his mouth, and screamed.
At least he had his strategy for the upcoming Slytherin-Gryffindor Quidditch match.
Draco watched him carefully, noticing how his hands just barely shook as he took out the single, long-stemmed rose, not seeming to notice the pinpricks of the thorns as he raised the bloom to his face. Eyes fluttering closed to inhale deeply…
“You have newssss, young Lord Malfoy?” Voldemort asked imperiously.
“I’ll refuse.”
“Uh…yeah…”
Harry moaned.
“A rival can manipulate more thoroughly than the closest friend, my Lord. If Bellatrix could stimulate Potter to an attempt at Cruciatus through badly-timed laughter, I will have him on a rampage of Unforgivables!”
“I’m a Potter! And a Black, I guess. Not that I want to live at Gr-…Gr-…ugh, I mean, at Sirius’ house. I’d like to see if my parent’s house can be restored…and I’m not really comfortable with as huge a place as Malfoy Manor.”
“Could there be other failsafes? A memory triggered by something or someone in the dungeons?”
Potter’s hand suddenly covered his mouth, Potter’s face turned towards something coming up the corridor. Draco turned his head to look, ignoring the fact that Potter’s hand had tracked the movement.
“You’re not going to get me to move from this chair, so lay off already.”
“What do you mean?” Potter asked quickly, grabbing Draco’s hand and pressing it against his cheek again, green eyes huge and expressive.
“Well, this ritual plays upon the tricks of light and reflection. When you look at the wands at first, you see four wands, the two real wands and the two reflections. Then with the water, you see four wands and your own reflection, right? But now I raise the original up out of the water.”
Harry waded swiftly towards Draco, pushing small waves of water in front of him, and Draco noticed that the pink head of his own penis was exposed in the troughs between waves. He looked over at Harry and caught his breath at the brown head just barely breaking the surface.
“Hey! You weren’t supposed to find that!”
“I take from your selection of Barrister Seymour to attend the meeting, that you wish to finalize matters with the Parkinsons?” Barrister Murdoch asked…solicitously.

“The Dark Lord does not negotiate.” Lucius said darkly.
"There will be…I mean, not everybody is going to be cool about this, you know. There will be…assholes."
“Finite. Now Mr. Malfoy, I’m sure you know that resorting to physical violence is not an appropriate way for a Lord of Malfoy to behave. Particularly in public. Would you care to explain yourself?”
The locking and silencing spells ingrained in the room automatically sliding into place.
“Oh Lord Malfoy, I’m horrified to have you in my house in it’s current state! That cursed mutt that used to be my son named a Halfblood as Heir! A
Draco narrowed his eyes at his professor.
Draco smirked.
“I think you have a few of these already, why don’t you check off the ones we don’t need to bother with?”
that!”
Granger’s wand was suddenly out and pointed at Draco, no doubt some obscure curse she’d read in a book somewhere on the tip of her tongue.
No Gryffindors gorging.
The boy took a deep breath. There was one thing, one wonderful amazing thing that would certainly get the other’s interest.
“I did!”
Lucius’ mouth twitched.
Well…part of a secret.
“What is it?”
“Exactly. Now, Mr. Malfoy, why don’t you move on over there so you too can go again. Now Harry, I want to see more
“Oh yes. Barring full intercourse, of course.” Draco added hastily.
As Potter screamed, Voldemort laughed his low, hissing cackle that spread out along the ground like a carpet of fog, chilling the bones.
“Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Potter! I am shocked at your behavior!” Professor Snape stormed up and grabbed Potter by the collar.
“Harry,”
Draco beckoned to the two figures hovering outside the doorway to his father’s office. They stepped forward and spoke their phrases.
“Adjunct Prefects, sir. Each Prefect should get an assistant of their choosing, with a badge and similar authority, subject to approval by the Prefect.”
“…but there aren’t any, so you need not worry yourselves about it!”
Draco turned to her with a superior smirk firmly on his face.
“No, I’m courting him.” Draco answered tonelessly.
“Can Dizzy be helping Master Malfoy?”

“Dad!”
The two Gryffindors hit the dusty floor at almost the same time, Draco congratulated himself.
Draco scowled at her and made a shooing motion. “I think you’re supposed to get to her before she actually has a chance to make the wrong friends. Now get going.”
Harry stood quietly between Granger and Weasley, not appearing to pay much attention to them as Weasley turned bright red with anger, and Granger gesticulated with authority at the Sceptre that lay on the table before Dumbledor, who simply twinkled knowingly in Harry’s direction.
Draco found himself smirking as Harry finally fell forward almost flat on his face, rolling immediately to his side and that long, long body wriggling like an eel as inch after inch after inch of flesh was exposed, the trousers and pants working their way down his legs until Harry was deliciously nude and on his feet, dashing towards the crystal wading pool.
so…so…so
Draco walked over to the seat he’d chosen to observe the golden boy meet his fate and sat down with a self-satisfied sigh.
“Yes, that was another example, except instead of a general effect he placed a repeater node on the ground next to you and fired the stinging spell at it, so you’d have an attack from another direction for the duration of the match. He also practiced wise prioritization by first forcing your concentration on the stronger charm, then slipping in the nuisance spell behind it, and then dealing with your nuisance spell.”
“I need you to penetrate some locations to retrieve some items…shall we say…of
Flint made an odd ritualistic gesture with one hand that Tom didn’t recognize. He made a mental note to ask Draco about it but then realized this was just the sort of question he’d just been given leave to ask.
Regulus stared.
“Did you tell him why you were here?”
“Potter, let’s see your essay.”
fudge, Draco corrected himself.
And behind that, at the other end of that breathtaking avenue, the broad sparkle of the crystal wading pool, complete with its own smaller tongues of flame wandering the surface of the steaming water.
“Mr. Potter,”
“Dumbledore likes to know everything in the castle.” Harry said, casting obscuring charms on each wall, then the ceiling, then causing the floor to become an insubstantial blur beneath their feet.
“Muggles,” he muttered, disgusted. “Ask your Mu-…ask Granger, I’m sure she can tell you all about the facts of life. After she gets her hands on the appropriate book, of course.” Draco sneered.
“I guess we’ll see now, where your strength really lies, Potter.” Draco murmured, tapping his wand to the newly created icon.
“Of course.”
“Well?”
Draco laughed.
“Are you serious?”
, the contract between the Malfoy and Parkinson families for the marriage of Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson was voided. As of today, Notice is served within the acceptable limits, as consummation of the royal union has not yet been completed.”
James put his finger on his chin thoughtfully.
Followed by a diminishing list of names of members of several prominent Light families, several aurors, mudbloods, halfbloods, all well-known as strong Light supporters. No doubt, Draco was holding a membership list of the Order of the Phoenix.
Harry nodded.
Draco took his hands in his.
“Sure, I guess.”
“Okay, let’s do it.”
Both looked up as something shifted in the room. They looked around, fearful they had been caught.
more demonstration of my bloodclaim when we reach the Common Room. After that, I will consider any further challenges to be an insult and act accordingly.”
“So brave…” Harry mock-cooed.
“I dare not, save to quote Clarke: ‘Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.’”
And, it was furthermore quite odd that Potter, who expressed at every turn his disdain for the importance of blood-connections, would be so strongly affected by such a tenuous familial relationship to Draco, whom he personally disliked, that he would reduce himself to
“Ow!” Cloud pulled his bitten finger back and examined it for breaks.
pleased to finally introduce you to. Please welcome your new Professor of Complex Magics, Lord Draco Malfoy-Potter!” she announced.
The cleansing finished, Draco pulled several more items from their temporary hiding place.
It would entirely ruin Draco’s strategy for the Blood gift, considering the situation.
“I’ll join you in one hour, mother, Severus.” Draco bid them farewell and headed briskly for his office.
“Um…there’s a wand above the water and only one wand in the water…that doesn’t make sense…what happened to the mirror?”
.” Mrs. Weasley said triumphantly, pushing Draco towards the table and pushing him into a seat.
“What’s an animagus?” Jamie asked.
Then they brightened.
they didn’t mind – the poor buggers actually tended to depression if they ever got bored), “leading on” unsuspecting women (so he liked to flirt, big deal, it’s not like he was flirting with
“I changed my mind.”
Neatly, he twisted it around the tip of his wand, four, five, six times and held the end in place with his finger. A red ribbon made of pure Acromantula Silk, dyed in Draco’s own blood – tied in a precise Targeting knot around the looped hair. Draco took the remaining ends of ribbon and added a Defensive knot, and a Transfer knot, ending with a large knobby cluster of red silk on the end of his wand.
Jonas stood there, his eyes burning with a thirst he most recognized from Draco’s mud-, no, his muggleborn protégé. It had barely even been a few hours, and the young man had crumbled before his own curiosity. Lucius smiled at him, waving him to the seat opposite him.
“You’re not going to enjoy this, Potter. Boulimos.”
“Perhaps somewhere a little less…internal to your family?” Draco suggested.
“Look I…well…what I said before. I’ve hated waiting like this. Malfoys are very impatient people, you know.”
The scroll unfurled smoothly, flattening itself as new magical scrolls are wont to do.
So. The Headmaster had clearly deduced that she was there to discover his password, and accommodated it. Draco wondered if this meant the old coot had some inkling of his intentions. Surely not.
“You’re a nasty old woman and Draco says you’re dead anyways, so you can’t do anything to me!”
“Protego totalus! Langlock! Petrificus Totalus! Incarcerous!”
Malfoy, Headmaster. I’m sure you’re aware of just how important this is?”
“Zabini. You’ve been teaching your spawn blood-magic. No surprise there, but now he’s used it right in public.”
Draco looked at the Golden Trio again.
Draco drew out the moment, meticulously creasing his sleeves as he folded them up the lengths of his forearms, revealing the unmarked skin beneath.
contracts preventing you from discussing any of your work here with anyone who isn’t similarly bound. The prefects will check off your name once you’ve signed and you’ll be clear to continue orientation, so please be quick and efficient about it. Thank you.”
Tom stood up, wand brandished.
“For both of us, Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes. The Gryffindor’s eyes widened in understanding.
Potter’s eyes narrowed.
Draco looked at the symbols. What did he want to know about Albus Dumbledore? His magical protections were depressingly enormous, his special strengths were likely to be the same. His fears and desires…he boldly pressed his finger to the small picture of an upturned palm.
“I suppose you’ll be bringing in Albus and Granger-Weasley then.”
Eyes forward, focused, completely dry.
Even Draco found himself smiling as he watched his young cousin try to straighten her hair after Molly Weasley’s powerful embrace.
“Really. Son.”
Draco thought about that night they’d staked out the Potions classroom. Potter’s Muggle shaving potion filling the small tent with an intoxicating scent. Potter’s lustful magic stabbing at Draco when Draco’s erection brushed against his backside.
Potter stood on the top of a hill, which was covered in human remains. A few of them recognizable. Weasley, Granger, the little Weasley, the werewolf, everyone in the school, in fact. The Dark Lord’s fresh corpse stood discarded not far from Potter.
ANYWAYS, THOSE SPELLS DON’T ACTUALLY WORK IN THE BURROW! IF YOU CAN’T LEARN TO BE QUIET THEN YOU’LL JUST HAVE TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO- OH DEAR, IT SEEMS THIS THING IS NEARLY OUT OF SPACE.
Lucius held out the folded note, which she took.
“Um. They’re different kinds of spells?”
Potter glared at him dangerously.
He leaned forward, maintaining eye contact, and sealed the promise with a small kiss.
based on that logic!” Daphne Greengrass gasped out.
The boy collapsed to his knees before the bundle, crawling forward to crane down at the baby.
“Silence! Thank you! Now, you will all be pleased to hear that the Hogwarts team will be coached by our new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor…none other than our own Quidditch legend, the youngest Seeker in centuries, Professor Harry Potter-Malfoy!”
Molly looked at her boys in disapproval, then her eyes hardened a bit as they settled on Draco.
Ron looked around the maze of junk skeptically.
Feeling somewhat mollified, Draco smugly kissed his boyfriend on the lips.
stirred in opposite directions. And potions with scarab should never be administered to anyone who has recently taken anything with alihotsy in it, and vica versa. Unless you actually are
Potter nodded, and stood, taking his hand from his forehead.
Harry shifted, not sure what to do. He looked at his son, who shrugged with similar bafflement. Harry extricated his hand, letting it fall to his side.
Then their lips met.
“You use pillows for fighting?”
Draco downed them in quick succession.
“Did you get to hear the password?”
Only to be confronted with a black ‘D’ on a background of yellow.
“Really? I keep hearing it’s quite a nice town. Not as big as Diagon Alley, I suppose.”
And Tom Riddle buried his face between his new father’s chests and cried like the little boy he’d never had the chance to be.
Draco felt himself suddenly rock hard under his robes, and tried vainly to buck up to press it against Harry’s heat above him.
Draco sighed, allowing himself to enjoy the feel of Harry’s eyelash fluttering next to his thumb for a moment before recovering his hand once again.
They ate in silence for a while as they both recovered their composure.
!” James gasped, horrified.
Draco pondered, wondering whether he had it in him to speak a death sentence in the Dark Lord’s ear.
“Oh, they abandoned those kinds of things.” Potter said. “They have a completely different branch of potions, using the natural, non-magical properties of ingredients. Hermione says that their understanding of the subject is far more advanced than the magical worlds’ except that they’re just ignorant about the magical part of things. Uh…actually…when you were talking about all the reactions and…stuff…this morning, you reminded me of her lectures.”
“Sorry I’m so late everybody, since I’m half of the life support system for an infant, you may find me easier to locate in my quarters if I’m mysteriously missing from my office at any point.”
Draco drew in a sharp breath, and Harry stopped, apparently realizing what he’d said…Draco waited until Harry was breathing quick, panicked breaths.
“You’ll never be able to trust him, mate. You’re married to a bloody Slytherin.”
environment! I realize the two of you are quite full of hormones at this point, but I’ll have to insist you go somewhere else to satisfy your adolescent urges!”
“Draco. What the hell are you doing?” Harry asked, watching his panicked self-inspection with some bewilderment.
pain that meant nothing to him next to the ordeals of his training from childhood.
attaching himself to our
“Wow.”
Lucius looked uncomfortable.
“Well then. I have a meeting to attend mother. Thank you for your concern.” Draco said, moving towards the Floo, powder in hand.
“Zabini. This is a private conference.”
There was a clatter as Potter slammed his fork to the table, knocking over his chair as he stood up rapidly. Blinking rapidly as he ran from the Great Hall.
“Yeah. I’m James, he’s Regulus.”
…in order to be allowed to finish it.”
Draco grimaced.
“But…Draco…we’ve always been friends, I shouldn’t have to look for a suitor at this late date! Why would you put me in this position after how long we’ve known each other?” she protested.
“Indeed, and evolved with power beyond a point where such intercourse is possible or desireable, my Lord. But such is not the case for your budding heir. I would have the Malfoy line be the first to benefit from the fruits of your heritage, my Lord. And so I would become your son-in-law, by the bindings of magic.”
“Are Gryffindors bad?” Jamie asked worriedly.
“Will you help us slay him, Harry?”
“And do you Harry take Draco as your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness, in health, from this day forward, until death never to be parted?”
“Draco. You don’t know what you’re saying. But…yes, I’ll trust you, at least.”
am doing, but not the content of either side of our negotiation. We’ll phrase the Vow to keep it that way.” Draco said smoothly.
about the Invisibility Cloak, Draco.” Jamie said, offended.
confident in my consultants, you see. Still, I would like to make sure. Perhaps you would be willing to help me test my wards to see if they are worthy of their task?” Draco raised a speculative eyebrow.
“Okay, sounds reasonable to me. As long as I have your word they
“I’ve no interest in your filthy Muggle nonsense.” Draco cut it off coldly, though in fact the idea of such free and easy shopping interested him quite a bit indeed. Still, he recognized a distraction when he heard it. His mother would be quite happy to investigate the matter of the credit stone at a later date. “I’ve come to move my accounts, and I’ll not be dissuaded so easily.”
It was a polite dismissal. The odd tugging at the back of his soul was starting to feel very uncomfortable, and from practice Tom knew he’d start getting very nervous and twitchy in a few minutes if he didn’t deal with the urge.
Cloud paled.
White phosphorous smoke drifted out of the opening, and a small crystalline platform resolved itself as a multi-faceted pyramid sticking up from the depths of the box. The top of the pyramid cracked open, the facets sliding down the sides of the pyramid revealing…the sparkling diamond ring inside.
social graces? He was a Lord, twice over, and one of those of the Ancient and Noble House for Merlin’s sake! It was painful to watch!
“But…what could you ever use against him! Everyone outside Slytherin hates him already!”
“Eat.”
Then he rose to his feet, spun on his heel, and strode to the door, leaving the miserable Gryffindor sitting naked on the tiled floor behind him.
in here! More children! Where are they?” he demanded eagerly, licking his lips as he cast about trying to locate the scent of Ron and Hermione.
Draco smiled and accioed the Gryffindor’s Invisibility Cloak.
[I submit to Draco Malfoy as the Head of my Household]
“He…blames himself for my mother’s death.” Harry said simply.
Perhaps Potter could be persuaded to take the type of marriage bond that magically enforced the sexual attraction of the honeymoon throughout the duration of the marriage. That would keep Potter’s attentions focused on Draco, who knew exactly how greedy he could be, and avoid the undesireable complications of inviting his cousins or, god forbid, his parents, into their marriage bed to help satisfy Potter’s less socially acceptable cravings.
“Hello?”
“Come back…please? It’s not when we’re like this. Just when we’re sexual. And I like it, anyways. It’s like this massive flood of power barely holding itself back from consuming me.”
“Pressed duck. It’s a very lovely French dish.”
had died, on the same night as your parents, there would be no more Potter blood. The Potter magic would slowly go insane, isolated in the ruins of Godrics Hollow, and over time grow malignant and bitter, and the area would become a nursing ground for Dementors and other Dark Things. The Black magic, Sirius refused to touch while he was alive, and it’s been doing the same. Tell me, does old Kreacher act a bit
Draco closed his eyes and concentrated on the events starting only after he’d cast the Escribamens spell. He opened his eyes.
Draco looked at all the items on the scroll. It was truly, a complete collection. Amazing.
“Draco, you would be
Another spin, and Draco took the lead again, putting them in that face-to-face position he preferred, spinning them around that way a few times until he got to feel the powerful roar of Potter’s magic traveling inches from his ear again.
Several other familiar Ministry names.
Tom looked at Cloud and found behind the pretty mask he wore the blonde’s eyes were practically beaming at him. He cast the boy a wink and turned back to the huddled upperclassmen.
“Maybe.” He admitted.
There was a silence for a moment as Draco looked over his essay. His godfather had to be repayed for this, of course. How to do so without being obvious about it, or reducing his Potions grade, or possibly casting the blame on Potter.
“Goyle.”
“Our Lord would pay dearly for such information, Draco.”
“Harry. I had a mop curling its tentacles
“You know, I bet you could scare a whole bunch of people this way!”

Molly seemed to notice she’d grabbed the wrong ear and let go, advancing towards Draco, maternal instinct and some primal menace in every line of her body.
“I happen to
Those Marauders were ruining his cousin, Draco decided. He’d have to keep a close eye on the level of influence the Golden Trio would have over his offspring. The idea of a
“But we like the things you bring us even more!” Regulus added, then went silent at the horrified gasp from above.
“Harry, sit down.”
Harry stared at him, then smiled weakly.
“Blood-Traitors! Muggle-lovers and mudbloods defile the house of my ancestors!” was the first thing Draco heard as the portkey deposited him in the entry hall of Grimmauld Place.
“Protego! Tarantallegra!”
“Do you, Severus Snape, swear to select from among your memories concerning Harry Potter, the ones which will be most advantageous to Draco Malfoy for the purpose of choosing a side in the current war?”
“Yes, besides that.” Bill asked dryly.
Granger smiled. A big, horrible, understanding smile. Like Draco was some sort of cute puppy dog that had just bit her hand trying to get at a toy.
Her gaze was drawn to another figure.
And he’d done it
Perfect.
“Did you say you finally killed that disgusting creature?” Lucius asked mildly, stepping out of the Cabinet.
“Can’t I?”
“Well, that’s only promising. Maybe the exposure will be good for him.”
“I’ll look forward to…um…reading it.”
He opened the bag and took out a small locket, a gash opening a hole in the center where the tiny bonding knife had pierced it. He dropped it in front of the stunned Dark Lord.
these days? Does the house make hateful noises at night? That line has been isolated before, it’s why Blacks tend to go insane, and it’ll go down that path twice as fast a second time if it’s not reunited with a proper blooded Lord soon.”
“Jamie,” She squeaked.
It quickly came to life, and Draco used his remaining good hand to quickly bring himself off, stepping forward as he neared completion. As he came, he heard his own voice squeaking with the force of his orgasm as the final incantation fell from his mouth.
Draco hesitated.
, Harry!”
Voldemort regarded him with interest.
Potter’s mouth compressed into an uncompromising line.
“That is satisfactory.”
Harry thought about that for a moment.
“No indeed.” Ollivander levitated the hovering wand to the boy’s hand. “Enjoy your re-united wand.”
The spirits disappeared.
The Critic answered.
“Now we turn inverse to each other. Be wary of blocking each other, we should be close and slightly to the side. Put your hand on my waist and look over my shoulder as we turn.” Draco said breathlessly.
“Ready?” Harry intruded on his thoughts.
The water was still quiet, Potter’s hand was still only lightly caressing himself, and Draco felt a sudden need to be a part of what was happening.
“That is
“I…I…I” Granger was, remarkably, at a loss for words for a moment. “Oh dear! Look at the time! We’ll have to table this proposition for consideration at our next meeting. Adjourned!” she huffed, and immediately started bustling about gathering her many color-coded charts and even one impressive animating graph.
“I hope you learned something from that famous set of parents you’ve got, Potter. ‘Cause we’re going to need it. What have you got for us?”
“It works on Slytherins too!” Jamie protested, outraged.
But he was
“Isssn’t it? Foolishh boy, thisssss place belongsss to me, now!”
“And a ghost of fucking
The Dark Lord’s eye fell lazily on Draco.
“Of course, whatever you desire, Mother.” Draco said graciously.
“Marriage proposals.”
She turned back to Lucius.
“My adopted brother has a runespoor as a familiar, and I was able to bargain with them for some very valuable intelligence about my new guardians.”
“Nobody asked you, Mudblood.” Malfoy snapped.
“I’ve watched Harry Potter for six years. It is Dumbledore that has propped him up as a symbol. Against his wishes, my Lord. Harry Potter wants nothing of his status or his fame.”
His Slytherins were in the dungeons. There was no way he could get past them to his toiletry set without being seen with blonde
“There’s no defying about it. I’m the Lord Malfoy. It’s my decision. Father …if he ever gets out of Azkaban, will abide by the decision of the Lord Malfoy. And…what do you mean Potter can’t be attracted to a boy? Has he said so? I know there are
Over the past eleven years, Lucius had grown steadily bitter and miserable, finding his beliefs about blood and magic proven wrong over and over as the magical community dramatically increased in power and knowledge by taking advantage of the fresh blood and fresh ideas the muggleborns seemed to have an endless supply of. His own mistakes, made worse by the fact that the magical community tended to gloss them over: forgiveness earned through the efforts of his brilliant son and powerful son-in-law, haunted him.
Cloud gave him an incredulous look before waving his own wand over Tom’s palm.
“You want me to choose the Light. You don’t want me to take His Mark. You think I can still make things good with Potter. I can’t make a well-considered decision if I do not have every relevant fact at my disposal.
Draco just looked at her, young, wise grey eyes peering at him.
Potter’s hungry eyes suddenly turned to some other emotion, Draco couldn’t tell what it was, but Potter raised his hands to reach towards Draco, his face straining with the effort to concentrate despite the sensations below his waist and the anger and the
“Who are
“He’s a Parcelmouth, my Lord. Neither James Potter nor Lily Evans had this gift, and it is
Potter’s eyes widened, and he backed slowly towards the door.
Jamie were looking at him in shock.
“Um. That could be really bad, though. What if some of his potions are really needed?”
The contents of the cauldron began glowing, and Draco stirred it clockwise three times. When he removed his wand the bundle of silk and hair was no longer on it.
"I look forward to it. For now though, I need to have a private meltdown."
The amount of emotion present in Potter’s statement, the pure fury and agony that he’d expressed at the thought of Draco belonging to the Dark Lord, was quite shocking towards such a distant relative. But Potter didn’t seem to feel that way towards Bellatrix, although it was quite significant that he’d been unable to Crucio her – even after witnessing her shocking murder of her cousin Sirius.
Suppressing a snort, Draco took their distraction as the opportunity he needed. Placing a hand on the scroll in his pocket, he held his wand carefully in his lap, pointed at Potter under the table.
Potter’s dull eyes rose to meet his, a small flicker of hope somewhere in their depths.
“Now, Molly. This is very important, and I think-”
“Massster Jamesss and his nessstmate Regulussss are like two ssssnakesss with only one head.” The Dreamer said.
James slams his hands together like a thunderclap, sending the other boys scrambling from their perches in terror,
“No one is asking you to.” Draco said shortly. “I am informing you of my intentions. In confidence, I might add.”
“Very well. But if it’s something foolish I’ll put a halt to it immediately.”
Harry looked up into his husband’s silver glowing eyes. Ran his hand up his cheek, fingers carding into the free-flowing white-blond hair.
“I am willing to start again, from the point before where Abraxas turned from Bilius. If you are willing.”
“I’ve arranged for us to meet Potter in Hogsmeade this weekend.” He told her.
I’m fucking terrified! Where have you
Accidental magic typically produced effects that would take many years to learn in spell form. Complex applications of Wingardium, or general-area effects of Reducto, or even Inflagrante and Lumos. Draco had heard rumors of infants who grew up to be immensely powerful, like the Dark Lord or Dumbledore, altering weather patterns according to their moods or causing individuals that angered them to grow sick.
“My first gift was a legendary magical sceptre that can potentially heal lycanthropy, and my second was a near-absolute protection charm powered by my own magical core. You may have observed a pattern that I’m not taking half-measures in this courtship. Surely you can deduce my choice for a blood gift.” Draco said.
“Testor Paterfamilias Draco Malfoy” Severus said.
That would have to change.
the best way to deal with humiliation, and Draco had to quite agree. But first, he’d get what he came for.
Harry turned away from him, his shoulders slumped.
The Love thing.
Long, almost girlish blonde hair, tall, slim, but definitely a young man. His posture fully erect, standing perfectly still on the edge of the porch, a marble statue but for the blowing hair. Pointy features on white skin…all made indefinably pretty by the soft lingering smile as he watched the crowd of children. Or, perhaps, watched one of them.
“So was this what you were worried about? With the bonding?” Potter asked tentatively.
“As a member of the family, I’d be pleased if you would call me by my first name.”
curse-breakers, I hope?”
“Well, as long as it’s only temporary, I think it’s a worthwhile investment.” Draco said. “There are limitations that can be placed to insure that.”
“Right! Good! Um, I mean, fine then, I guess I should come get you at Slytherin so you aren’t spotted. Uh…midnight at the door to Slytherin?” Potter stammered. Draco wondered how the boy knew where the entrance to Slytherin was.
And slightly set off…
“If you know any good locking charms, now’s the time.” Potter hissed, before he started casting at the closed door of the potions lab.
“Draco, I’m not
Harry’s eyes were wide as the mediwitch performed a complex charm in the general area of Draco’s abdomen.
“Glacius! Crucio!”
“If your father interferes with your…plot…to marry Harry Potter, what will you do?”
“You are wisssse for one with your ssssad misfortune of being born with only a ssssingle head. Much like the Masssster Jamessss and hissss nestling. Perhapssss between the three of you, a proper ssssnake could be made.”
“Deal!”
Draco slowly withdrew the volume and carefully placed it on the desk atop the one he’d last been reading. Clearly the Black magic wanted him to know something in particular.
“Of course you will. Because you’re in
“Well. Good evening, Zabini.” Draco said in dismissal.
Draco arrived back at the Manor to find a very vicious looking Heron with a letter clamped tightly in its beak. Draco removed the item and summoned some fish from a house elf to feed the creature as he read the missive.
“What’s wrong with him?” Tom asked.
do not usually live to see their thirtieth year.” Lucius pronounced.
- bushy and wild and far too short for his position (though the Potters had always despised that particular tradition), Potter looked every inch the conservatively dressed young Lord.
you have a Slytherin side!”
“Your parents” Orpheus had again stalled his movements as he processed this incredible fact. He knew of the debt, of that Tom had no doubt.
Potter sighed.
Draco hummed slightly under his breath as he enlarged the box full of etched plates, carefully fitting the first into its slot on the Cabinet’s heavy black frame.
“Now. I’m asking the questions. What the hell happened to you Potter?”
Regulus took a deep breath, put his hand on the knob, and slowly turned it.
“Of course. We’ll let you know the details.”
Draco drew back a bit at her sudden hostility. Blacks were known to tend towards mental instability, though Jamie was a bit young to be manifesting
Draco suppressed a moue of distaste at the mention of his cousin’s Muggle foster parents.
“But you always bring us something!”
Ron and the rest of the room heaved a collective sigh of relief.
Draco took his seat in front of the Headmasters desk.
Draco waved dismissively.
And then Draco saw him over Potter’s shoulder. The Dark Lord, approaching, stepping over Bellatrix as if she wasn’t there.
“You know, that may be amenable. You’re nearly as close a friend as Draco, and certainly good looking, good magic levels, rich, pureblooded, and not too closely related.” She mused thoughtfully. “Perhaps we should talk?”
She snorted, and Draco frowned in censure at the impolite sound.
“Malfoy.” Granger said softly from behind him. “You might try talking to him. Harry values honesty above all.”
The new link wrenched his attention from the insignificant figures outside the door. There were other things to show him.
Narcissa smiled gracefully.
“It’s twizzlers.”
“Does Harry know-” she started, and Draco cut her off.
“I don’t know that the Marks are themselves a tainted form of magic. Clearly Voldemort twisted them to be a coercive tool. At the very least they will be a dangerous temptation.”
Moony! You’re encouraging them, give me a fighting chance you crazy monster!” the teen protested loudly, green eyes dancing in a way that belied his complaints.
“Ready to lose, Potter?” Draco sneered at the boy. Somehow the words were falling flat of their usual witty sharpness lately.
“Please, is someone here?”
Harry’s eyes flashed in anger and he went for his wand.
Draco smiled at his childhood nickname.
The house elf appeared with a pop.
a girl!”
“Aww, do we have to? I kind of like him like this!” Ron chuckled.
“She’s nice at all.”
Draco focused his attention on his godfather’s name in the “allies” list. The portrait of Potter suddenly changed, showing him in the very rooms Draco had just left an hour ago.
Draco picked up, what was as far as he could see, his best hope for a logical and precise analysis of the situation. There was one muggle book he’d ever read that made even a modicum of sense, and fortunately, it was part of a series.
“James, quit it, you’re scaring him.”
“Discussing my proposal, I heard. I have to disagree about the Death Pact, Harry. Not for Granger’s reasons, that’s a lot of nonsense. But we
“Yes, options. I expect I’ll be getting what I want in the next week.” Draco said, with a smug look affixing itself to his own face.
“You arrive at a fortuitous time, Lucius. I look forward to your counsel on the strategies I have put into place to profit our family in the war. I expect you will be impressed by the lofty end I have set.”
Draco looked down at the maze of layered protections.
again, and
“Mind you don’t forget to pack up as you eavesdrop, Greengrass.”
Draco spelled his hair in silence for a moment before Harry spoke up again.
He had quietly observed the entire incident from under his Invisibility Cloak. It seemed Draco’s ways had rubbed off on Tom more than it ever had on the twins – he’d handled the whole situation with finesse and looked well on the way to gaining a new friend. Harry knew well the value of confrontations early on in acquaintance. His defense of Ron to Draco had cemented years of lasting friendship. He hoped this incident would create a similar bond.
Tomorrow, we’ll start making Floo calls.”
“Escribamens.” Draco whispered the spell.
“Well, now, don’t worry. I’ve not allowed my duties as Lord of Malfoy to distract me from the call of my mother’s line in distress. I’ve arranged to put things right, never fear.”
Lucius wiped his mouth and stared up at his new Muggle friend for a long moment. Something was very wrong. Something bad was happening, or about to happen. Lucius stared down at the irritated skin and shuddered. He needed counsel...and there was one person the wizarding world he knew he could trust with this.
“~~We would be delighted to help make the two-legs scream.~~”
Tom gave it some thought, his eyes roving the room, noticing how still Greengrass had gone in his task of clearing his things from around Tom’s new bed. Time to play the game his new father had taught him. Time to impress, in just the right way, to plant that seed that would become loyalty.
“She thinks everybody’s too thin.”
using anything to watch!” the other twin said, innocently.
Molly Weasley did not look shocked. A flicker of mild surprise flashed behind her eyes, but quickly disappeared as they narrowed, calculatingly assessing Draco’s slender hips and sculpted cheekbones.
“Draco would never let the Dark Lord kill Harry!”
“I do.”
Draco hadn't noticed the one-legged, one-eyed old Auror until now. He shivered, remembering the polyjuiced Crouch back in fourth year.
The witch raised an eyebrow at him in query and he gave her his most serious look. She turned to her companion.
Satisfied, he tapped his wand on the gift, and the note, and uttered the incantation that would summon its magical courier.
“You’re wrong. I am
! Malfoys
Through deft manipulation of his image, Draco Malfoy-Potter had managed to use his role as the architect of Voldemort’s defeat to catapult himself to an iconic-like status in the wizarding world that very nearly eclipsed that enjoyed (and hated) by Harry Potter himself during the war. His romantic courtship of Harry Potter and artful swindling of the power-hungry Dark Lord into willing participation in Harry and Draco’s Marriage Ritual culminating in Voldemort’s destruction had quickly made him a living legend in the wizarding world…especially to this younger generation that hadn’t grown up on tales of the Boy-Who-Lived.
“Aside from being the most powerful wizard of his age, the heir to two family fortunes, and the hero of the wizarding world?”
“I don’t think you’re a very nice lady. I’m going to hang out with Harry and ‘Mione and Ron now. Bye.”
“But…but…”
“I have to duel you.” He blurted out.
“You know Professor Snape wouldn’t have put us together except as a punishment, right?”
“Potter doesn’t know any better. Whoever’s courting him is obviously one of the finer pureblood families.” Pansy sniffed. “I’m sure they’ll make sure their offspring don’t share Potter’s…proclivities.”
Harry looked back at the scepter, touching it lightly like a truly precious thing, and then looking up at Draco again.
“What do you mean.”
Draco gaped. What the hell was wrong with the boy, surely even the Gryffindor wouldn’t be so stupidly defiant if he really thought Draco a Death Eater.
Harry’s breath caught, and Draco saw his eyes glisten suddenly with tears as he reached a trembling hand towards the ring.
?” their peers demanded of Regulus and James.
Harry looked at him silently.
[My first name is Draco]
Regulus thought for a long moment.
Harry let out his breath slowly.
A nasty smile applied itself once again to the Dark Lord’s face.
Nothing.
“But…but this…this is…”
The old woman forsook the pillar she’d leaned on and approached the young man.
James looked around the dorm room, waiting for inspiration. The Hufflepuff boys dorm was a semi-circle, with the beds arranged like spokes on half a wheel, their heads all facing the window where moonlight streamed in. He imagined the scenario he’d envisioned…and of course that’s how it would be, what else would the older boys do – spoil their own surprise attack by knocking the door in and shouting “Chaaaarge!”?
“Harry, mate? You coming?”
“What kind of condition are the boltholes in?” Draco suddenly queried.
The device, of course, predated the development of sufficiently precise warming charms that house elves later could aim at their masters beds during the night without risking injuries…which practice also predated the more general environmental control charms that the Manor was now imbued with.
“You’re still completely insane, though.” Draco qualified.
“We are. I mean the other ritual. You have to accept your Blood gift and…finish it.”
“Now, my boy. I think as the informed neutral party here I can tell you that, circumstances as they are, the Ministry can make your life difficult for quite some time if it chooses.” Dumbledore said soothingly, then turned to Shacklebolt. “And I’m also sure that this can all be explained satisfactorily and with a minimum of inconvenience for all parties if we cooperate together.”
Draco waved his good hand.
The two boys held their breath as they inched forward towards the cradle.
Draco smirked. It was a bit out of date, but his father’s scroll on Tom Riddle was still sitting on a table in a certain sublevel. A simple comparison, and he’d have his answer.
“It’s been a week since I gave you the Pensieve.” Draco said neutrally, leaning against a wall. He carefully slipped the scroll back into his pocket, keeping his wand out but lowered.
such familial devotion out loud in Severus’ office.
“Lysander’s cool. Who cares?”
“Oh wait, you’re right. If every element is reactive we have no neutrals and can’t find a safe vessel. Okay, what else can you work with in liquid form. Nitrogen?”
“Well, I’m glad you’ve decided to stop being stupid
He pulled his hand out, looking like something inhuman rather than his own limb.
“I don’t…understand…” Potter…no,
True to form, Draco rolled his eyes at them, then looked at Harry.
No, that side wasn’t a mystery.
“Oh, nevermind. Let’s try something else instead, since they told us to stick to the periodic table. The theory should still work the same. What about hydrogen, isn’t that supposed to have a liquid form?”
“She’ll never get them that way. But I’ll
“You are…wiser than me, I think, Draco. I am glad that I have at least this to boast of as I catalogue my debts.” He told his son.
“Fine.” Draco stepped back, eyeing Harry’s tasty-looking neck from afar.
their memory. They’ve already seen it.” Harry said.
A flailing fist caught his finger and grasped it.
“And something may have happened at Hogwarts, as well.
James wasn’t there, he was in Hufflepuff, making new friends, making people faint with his casual brandishing of Hissyfit and slipping easily in and out of Parseltongue, and then making them immediately forgive them with his big smile and easygoing ways.
Draco nodded minutely.
Potter sighed again, and this time Draco saw his shoulders bunching just slightly as his arms moved under the water…
Draco considered. Severus couldn’t know about the Escribamens he’d cast right before the incident.
“He is the descendant of Slytherin.”
Draco leaned casually against a haphazardously stacked shelf as he inspected the two Gryffindors.
“I’m glad you liked it. I…I’ve never felt…I mean, that was wonderful for me, as well.” Draco said.
my godfather, Harry. You didn’t think he’d let me walk into this completely blind, did you?” he said with a tinge of sarcasm. The thing was, his godfather
“You’re right. I should have sought your counsel first of all. I don’t think the Potter’s courtship can be our only source, though. I have the sense that Lily Evan’s sister and brother-in-law are quite dissimilar to Potter’s parents. One thing Granger did tell me is that she believes that they are…what she calls ‘homophobic’. They would strongly disapprove of a courtship between males.” Draco said.
Now came the much harder part.
damage my relationship with my godfather, whom I hope to apprentice to in the near future! Damn you, Potter! I should have known better than to trust a Gryffindor with secrets!” Draco raged, his voice never raising above an angry hiss.
But the funny old man had told him never to tell the others.
“You’re betrothing to Harry Potter?”
“What? Ahhh! A bat! No…a man? Look, he’s a man-bat! Eww, oh somebody my mouth is gross! Wait, what’s this stuff…I’m wearing a dress? I’m not a girl, just because I…er…I’m
“I believe so.”
“Come back here young lady! I haven’t finished interviewing you yet!”

He’d allowed himself develop feelings for Harry.
“Master Draco!”
Then he swept Harry up into his arms, pausing at the threshold.
eat those pancakes before you leave this table.” Molly Weasley looked like some kind of culinary executioner standing over him, legs braced, with the rather large spatula brandished in her hand like a cudgel, drops of fatty liquids dripping off of it with every gesture.

“No. Gringotts. Can’t talk about it.” Draco grunted. He
“You’re not leaving until I leave.”
“A boy?” Dumbledore frowned.
he wouldn’t be after Harry if he didn’t have some sneaky plan ready! This is perfectly normal for marriages between people who have some reason to be suspicious of each other.”
“Very well. But I don’t want one of your little...
Harry pulled back from his son and noted the dried tear tracks, framed the boy’s face with his hands.
“You were close to spewing your seed in my mouth, that’s why.” Draco said, replacing his mouth with his fingers, spreading his saliva and the natural lubrication over the head as he stroked it sensually, up and down, up and down.
“Uh. Thanks. Malfoy. You look good too.” Potter said awkwardly. Through force of will, Draco managed to resist the urge to roll his eyes at Potter’s statement of the blatantly obvious.
“You hate me! Why do you hate me? I’m good, I clean, I cook, I’m very quiet! I really am quiet! Why do you hate me?” Potter’s lower lip trembled, green eyes twice their normal size and filling with tears.
“But you are quite right too, because sleep by itself is useless. There would be no dreams at all if we didn’t spend time awake to see new things and think new thoughts. If we only slept all the time, we would not be dreaming, but
“We’ll get plenty of time later. Now let’s find Ron and Hermione so we can get some kissing action in.”
“Well. Roses seem to be a very important first step in declaring interest. Red roses, specifically: I suspect there’s some sort of symbolism relating to the act of consummation. James almost made it a calling card of his, during the years that Lily refused his interest. A single, long-stemmed red rose, the gossips seemed to think it was symbolic of their combative relations that the thorns were not removed. Something to keep in mind with Harry Potter, I think.”
“Draco!” Harry said in shock. “We were just…um…”
“Harry, I see your concern. But you have to realize that any family in the know would include appropriate safeguards in a marriage contract with the Zabinis. Besides, they aren’t gold-diggers, they just have a darker and much more fatalistic view of romance than most people. If Cloud does carry on that legacy, he’s not going to seduce a childhood friend to his death – trust me, Blaise and all the rest of them would be horrified by something like that.” Draco assured him.
Potter stopped struggling for a moment.
“How will you ensssssure Potter’sssss cooperation?”
“Did you get to the Great Library? Now you’re the Lord Malfoy you should have access.” Blaise asked interestedly.
“I so swear.” Draco felt the sizzling energy of the magic looping around his wrist, fighting the urge to flinch from it.
“What’s that, Harry?”
the marriage would tip off every pureblood in the school who Harry’s mysterious suitor was.
“Through the loo.” The first clarified.
“What!”
“Well. If the Lord Malfoy would

Draco turned to his aunt.
And tonight he was definitely being generous, he reminded himself.
tell the lies that need to be told, blackmail, betray, mislead, and double-deal. I’ll make sure you live to strike down the Dark Lord like the idiot Gryffindor warrior you are.”
He carefully climbed the steps and found a compartment half-full of Hufflepuffs. A subtle repelling charm and a notice-me-not on the seat insured no students would attempt to take the apparently empty space, and his Invisibility Cloak would prevent their notice of an adult on their train. The Hufflepuffs were far too busy being touchy-feely with their long-missed friends to investigate, anyway.
Harry’s mouth opened and closed a few times, before he moved his hand into Draco’s free hand, nodding furiously.
“Oh. Well it was from all the Marauders, so it’s not part of the Black inheritance. I got it back in third year.” Potter said defensively. No doubt this was one of the few physical possessions he wasn’t willing to part with.
“Draco, why are you babbling Machiavelli at our son…
His father looked at it dubiously.
Jamie nodded emphatically.
“But I thought you said Potter was supposed to be our target this game!” Goyle asked, confused.
“Take it, Harry! For Merlin’s sake, take the thing so it’ll shut up!” Weasley begged, his face crimson.
“I guess she’s got me wrapped around her finger, all right! But you didn’t come all the way to Egypt to talk about my engagement! Ol’ Grup was in an awful state and just told me to do what you say no matter how dangerous, then went off muttering about how dangerous and unreliable human-made wards are. Care to enlighten?”
He tinged his voice with a cheerful challenge.
His father examined his face carefully before reaching forward to pull the lid from the container.
“~~May we eat it now?~~”
But this…this groaning anguish in the pit of his stomach, that horrible twisting knot of some new and terrible kind of pain – this was what he had been warned about! He had
At Platform 9 ¾ the chaotic atmosphere was contagious. All three boys, even the usually serious Tom were bouncing on their toes, chattering to their fiery-haired cousins and pointing excitedly at everything in sight despite Draco’s horrified admonishments about “manners” and “dignity”.
a Malfoy! You can help us, right? You can defeat them!” Frankie begged
Draco just looked at her a moment before responding.
“Revaelo” Draco cast, and then had to stifle a gasp.
“Will you?” Draco whispered.
“Then there’s just the bit identifying the families and asking for an alliance by marriage, and the last bit is a hint to why they chose that particular heirloom. ‘Burdens lifted will rejuvenate the lifter.’ Hmmm, I wonder what it is.”

“Think of it as dancing. You always face the direction I’m not facing, watch my back and I watch yours. So when I do this-”
Draco thought for a moment. He knew Harry would fall in love with the Manor, but bringing him there

As a result, the swear jar had been re-purposed for pet peeves. Draco had himself forfeited many a Galleon for making unnecessary work for the house elves (although everybody
Draco nodded in acknowledgment of this fact, then looked at Hermione expectantly. She did not disappoint.
Draco kissed him, and was saddened that the troubled look didn’t go away.
She signed her name at the bottom, next to Draco’s signature. The contract rolled itself up and disappeared with a pop.
Molly Weasley could be heard howling at them to put them down so they could come to the reception she’d prepared.
with you, father? The old Lucius would have already slipped into the role James Potter left vacant and become Harry Potter’s closest mentor by now!”
“Well. Yes. If it works, if it’s profitable, of course.” Draco said shortly. “And further…I think you would be the ideal witch to head up the team.”
“This is the ritual. However, the family should be present for the presenting of the final gift, my Lord.” Draco offered. “As well as the bonding itself, which takes place at the same time.”
“Regulus, James, your father and I need to speak privately.
“Thank you, Madame Granger-Weasley.” He gave a small formal bow to her and turned to go.
Tom smirked. By all accounts he was royalty to them, and they clearly did not like the fact.
Harry suddenly hugged him hard enough to cut off his breath.
“What was it you wanted our help with? I’m assuming it has something to do with Harry.”
Draco nodded seriously at her, before turning to her husband.
“Do you think we’ll be good parents?”
Harry Potter had obviously refused it!
Jamie drew herself up and studied both the boy and the infant with interest.
“But it would work if I did it anywhere in Hogwarts?”
“But why didn’t he even try? We’re
“Is that why you’re looking for Harry right after dinner? Because you’re so balanced?” Jamie smirked.
Draco stroked his chin thoughtfully for a moment.
Blaise stared at him in shock.
?” Draco repeated, horrified.
Draco paused.
“The ritual is powered by a wizard’s blood, breath, tears, flesh, bile, and seed. My hand…was the flesh.”
With that, James unceremoniously smacked Lysander in the face with his pillow. Lysander blinked, momentarily stunned.
“Oooh, Draco! You’re simply wonderful! Think of what we could
Draco was no fool. Being that much of a weakness was in itself a power. A power over Potter, to manipulate him. If he was clever enough he could make the Boy Who Lived Dance not
CRACK!!!!
“You don’t ask the question directly. You ask what the other would tell you if you asked the question. Then you ask if that would be the truth, a half-truth, or a lie. Then you would ask if this would change after a marriage bond.”
“Why isn’t he moving?”
The old woman found another pillar to lean against, so she stood beside the young watcher. The peaceful set of the face, the affectionate roll of the eye at the other boy’s antics. This was no fresh hormone-inspired romance.
“Gryffindor’s Heir may as well have Felix Felices running through his veins!” Draco snapped.
“But…how could you know that?”
Voldemort laughed.
“Harry says we should call him by his name, but Draco says I shouldn’t attract his notice.”
A large section of the Forbidden Forest had been leveled by the magical shockwave.
lovely to meet you, Thomas Potter-Malfoy.” Cloud said formally, offering his hand. Tom carefully shook it, flashing the other boy his most brilliant smile as he responded.
“…traditionally enjoyed by the friends of the groom!” The twins richocheted.
“He’s the Dark Lord. Maybe he doesn’t like sex.”
“The recipe vacation for how you can do me a favor for my favor, so there isn’t any debts! Father says holding debts makes people not your friends.”
“Ohhhhhhhhh…” Harry moaned as he slid smoothly into Draco, and Draco echoed it with a gasp of his own.
Harry smiled shyly.
“Slytherin House has an heir?”
“We’ll be keeping a close watch on both you
“I think it’s time for us to see to the old man.”
than what Draco had been hoping for. And not in a good way. He frowned down at the offending headline and let himself read it carefully, word by word.
And only one lone Slytherin plotting.
“Isn’t there? Many powerful beings have taken allies and made equal bonds, father.”
“Ow! My virgin eyes!” Ron groaned. “Can you
“No, I mean
“Go on! Open it!” Harry said encouragingly. Draco glared at his boyfriend, who seemed to find Draco’s ongoing cat-and-mouse game with Molly Weasley to be a great joke, and had in fact revealed this hilarity to his two friends, who had agreed.
But Harry went on.
There was a flash of blue light and Harry straightened up, his kneeling legs straddling Draco as he erected a powerful shield over them both.
Jonas looked at the nickel in his hands, at the several sheets of paper covered in mathematical formula.
Harry Potter-Malfoy looked around at the assembled heros. Draco, Severus, Albus were there, and projections from Hermione and Ron, of course. All a little worn, a little weary, but all willing and determined and
“Lord Malfoy. Last night you used a portkey to take you to a foreign location, where your activities or continued travels are unknown until you returned to Hogwarts this morning. During that time, I’m sure you aware a notorious prison breakout involving one of your close family members occurred. I think you can see we have enough circumstantial evidence to bring you to the Ministry for questioning if we choose.” Shacklebolt began.
Draco sucked in his breath.
Jonas picked up the chunk of nickel, hefting it in his hand.
“It wasn’t that hard,”
“If you will all excuse me, this is far too good an opportunity to pass up.” He drawled, and made his way quickly to the doors.
Harry willingly relinquished his dominating position over Draco and gave him a hand up from the floor.
But there was no wind.
“Fine then. Let me know what you decide about the research project, Granger.” He said coldly, sweeping towards the door.
Weasley grimaced.
“Yes, yes. Can you think of another reason why those were a good combination?”
Tom looked up startled.
“Blaise. Professor Snape has far worse things to worry about than his social standing.” Draco said calmly, watching the boy’s eyes flicker with subtle relief at the use of his given name.
“I was stupid, they’re addictive. And then you were using some spells that…Harry…I don’t want to be married to the next Dark Lord.”
“Do you not think the circumstances justify it?” Draco asked smoothly.
Harry sat down slowly.
“My birth parents are long dead. But I believe you know both of my adopted parents, especially Draco.”
One smooth cut across the jugular vein, dark-magic-transformed blood, a sick black fluid, shooting out in an obscene geyser, and it was done.
“I will in a moment.” Draco said quietly, reaching a hand in his robes for Potter’s newly completed scroll.
“Potter is Muggle-raised. In my interactions one thing is clear, that he knows nothing of wizarding traditions. I know nothing about the appropriate rituals and conventions he would expect. I’ve attempted to research this myself, with little success. I’ve even approached a close associate of his, receiving only very terse advice. In my dealings with Potter I know him to be quite tenacious about his Muggle values. I expect success in negotiation will depend on observation of
Draco relaxed.
“Lucius.”
“We can’t let him have Moony!” Frederick announced.
“Well. Magic is more or less loose energy unless it’s focused. That’s what the wand core does. There are examples of wizards and witches so immensely powerful that they themselves could be classified as a magical creature. Then, their own bones could replace the function of a wand core. Still very imprecise, you understand. Not nearly as good as a real wand. The Headmaster has done so, on a few occasions.”
Jamie frowned skeptically at it, then turned back to him.
Fenrir Greyback stepped through, his teeth gleaming viciously.
Of course, the other half would be letting her know it.
He tucked his face into Harry’s neck and licked the salty skin.
“If anyone pressures you to declare allegiance, to
“I’m a mess.”
“Impossible?” Draco snorted. “Your muggle relatives have spoiled your imagination, I expect.”
The gaudy Gryffindor colors had been muted down quite nicely. A very tasteful deep wine-colored vest was visible under his black formal robes. Draco decided to ignore the way the color accentuated the flush in Potter’s cheeks for now. Also, a discreet flash of gold jewelry at the neck…an elegant-looking lion pin.
“What did the math say?”
“But Draco…this is silly! It looked better curly, anyways.”
“I think you’d better show me.”
“…which of you should count as the bride…”
After that, the Dark Lord had rather gradually warmed to the plan Draco suggested…but at what point did this mean he was pleased enough to open the door to the sleeping Harry?
Draco studied him carefully.
By the time he had finished eating, the twins were whispering to each other behind their hands, their eyes turning to Draco now and then with a mischevious glint. The dragon-handler and the cursebreaker were shooting the twins distrustful looks, in between watching Draco with amused smiles creeping at the corners of their mouths.
“The appropriate witnesses and the Blood gift must be present there, and Potter must be made to cooperate. He will not wish to bond with you near, or with his friends in danger. And certainly not if he believes me responsible for their deaths.”
Narcissa shook her head minutely.

“I guess we have our answer to that question.” Draco said dryly from the doorway. “I’ll have the house elves bring Granger and the others up here.”
“Hi.”
“My Lord. I bring you my son, who is now Lord of Malfoy, and desires humbly to treat with you on behalf of the family.” Lucius said.
It would probably have to be Voldemort himself. Or possibly his insane aunt Bellatrix. She
“I suggest you apologize. Your brutish assault has quite offended my son, and you would not want him to take offense and bring suit.” Cloud’s father continued.
“Wait…isn’t Scorpius the baby?”
“Heya Tonks!” he offered with a winning smile.
And that's the end! But there is a sequel in progress. Because…Draco only destroyed the Horcruxes Voldemort actually knew about! See what that means for Draco and Harry in The Orphaned Soul!
“…of scuba diving, surfing, sailing…”
Draco’s stomach growled. Loudly.
Tom shuddered under the kind hand and the even kinder words. A strange pricking sensation was behind his eyes and he found that Harry and Draco, behind him, had suddenly gone blurry.
AND WHILE WE’RE ON THAT SUBJECT, I’VE TOLD YOU A HUNDRED TIMES I CAN SENSE A SILENCING SPELL ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE, HAVEN’T I?
“No, I mean you actually
His conflict was solved when the door to the nursery suddenly opened, a bleary-eyed Draco Malfoy stumbling inside.
“I’ll be careful.”
“That makes things difficult. We’ll have to insure that she meets only the right sort of suitors. Perhaps Severus can be of help as well, once we settle on an optimal husband for her.”
Draco thought for a moment.
Muttering something about skinny, underfed boys always banding together, and something that sounded alarmingly like an arithmancy formula having to do with pregnancy and pelvic girth, Molly summarily ordered him to sit and began a whirlwind of preparations of what Draco was sure would be a monumental breakfast.
“Is that it?”
“Potter! What’s wrong? Are you okay?” Draco demanded, fully suspecting the cause.
As Regulus stared at his brother a moment longer, in disbelief, in betrayal…and, unable to watch him give his attention to another instead, looking finally away… their connection, their special
“Fuck off, Potter. It’s a legitimate strategy and you know it. Unlike
Draco spun and moved as quickly as he could towards the office of his Head of House.
“What makes you think I brought you something?”
“Good evening Lord Malfoy.”
“How is your father?”
“This is a Founder’s relic?”
Sighing, Draco picked up the silver knife, wrapping the silk and the ribbon around its handle, and moved forward.
Potter scowled at Draco, clearly not pleased at the magical sleight of hand. Then he shrugged.
The charm didn’t affect Draco’s sight, of course. Sadly, Potter was clearly not enjoying what was happening so far.
Draco unfurled the scroll and tapped his wand to the new icon depicting two pieces of twine tied together.
“Abuse/Conflict” (appears to be an expected ongoing interaction, starting with the ritual of pulling hair during the pre-pubescent stage, to frequent argumentative behavior)
Harry raised an eyebrow at him, staring him down evenly.
but you always fall into the Dark Lord’s traps! You’re too Gryffindor and I
Harry crawled over to his boyfriend, straddling him before lying down on top of him.
“Then it’s acceptable. It’s just not what Pureblood Wizards
“You wouldn’t even know!” James sneered, “Now do you want to hear how it’s going to go down or do you just want to wait for your fate in ignorance?”
Draco pushed his bowl forward slightly and placed his spoon carefully atop it, allowing a sigh of contentment to escape from him. Mrs. Weasley’s beaming went up several notches.
A blue flickering at the doorway informed Draco that he’d crossed the threshold…the magical trap was locking on and would strike in just a second…
The Golden Trio and the Twins were far too busy rolling on the ground with laughter over the overheard conversation.
And Mrs. Weasley was beaming at Draco, clearly very pleased with the amount of food he’d put away. No doubt, she presumed this food would one day be put to great work creating a vast multitude of little blond children…
Narcissa moved forward, stopping a few feet away.
Beyond the fact that Potter was exhausted, his magical levels about half-drained from feeding his broom through such incredible maneuvers, and he had, indeed, a broken nose, was another much more vital fact.
“You’re a very clever witch, Granger. I’m sure you can figure it out. Oh, and of course there’d be a very generous stipend for yourself, and you and your team together would hold fifty percent interest in any intellectual property you generate.”
“And me?”
Draco stared at his stomach, the yellow glow still hovering.
“No, you wouldn’t. But Potter was raised by his sister’s family, dear.” Narcissa reminded him. “And your own mother happens to have been at Hogwarts at the time James Potter conducted his unwelcomed courtship. I expect the tokens of interest a Potter used were well-fashioned, if unwisely aimed.”
“…unobserved and unrecorded sex…”
His father’s wand touched his temple gently, and James closed his eyes against the odd
“I still don’t see why we can’t take them.” Regulus scowled.
The man didn’t answer, just turned his head away for a moment, reliving some horrible memory no doubt. Then he turned back to Draco with a soft smile.
“You know something I don’t know.”
“Ambitious, powerful people are Sorted there.” Draco nodded. “The bad ones from Gryffindor and Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff are just as bad, but they don’t make a name for themselves, they just are.”
Harry turned in his arms to meet him with deep green eyes.
He took a deep breath.
“I apologize, young Mr. Malfoy. But I have the feeling you are not being entirely forthcoming with me.”
The sound stopped.
If Harry continued his current pattern, he’d be facing the Dark Lord much sooner than that. And the Dark Lord certainly would want him disposed of before he came into his powers, even if he didn’t realize the boy was his magical heir.
Tom wasn’t about to let his new family go without a fight.
should tell me, what I overheard, Draco.” He said sadly.
Bill lit up like a sudden lumos on a dark night, eyes going dreamy as he sighed out a reply.
“I’ll get you for that little betrayal later!” he whispered, “For now, get up on the couch. I have a present for you.”
Moody glared at Draco.
And Potter was in the very
Draco congratulated himself on stunning the normally irrepressible witch to silence twice in ten minutes.
“Why does it have such a strong smell?”
“Dude! I get you man. But you can’t fight them, the adults, the singles, they’re like everywhere and they have all the power. And they really, don’t get it.” Lysander soothed him.
Dumbledore opened it warily, read the single word quickly before his eyes shot up towards Draco.
“What about the Dark Lord?”
Draco watched a scene play itself out, himself in all his splendor, sneering and saying something witty to Potter and his friends, Granger’s lips thinning in displeasure, Weasley’s face turning purple and Potter standing there, fists clenched at his sides, hair standing on end…odd…how did Draco never notice that Potter generated energy when he was angry before?
“Well. We can certainly have a snog. Probably should do it in front of someone so they can interrupt us if it get’s too heated.”
The head table had been spread over with a rich velvet tablecloth of a deep green color.
“You don’t like that idea. But you’ve just essentially told me you had nothing more to contribute. I think you should go learn something new. Yes. I think that’s exactly what you should do, Lucius.”
~Hermione Granger~
“Shhh! Get rid of the food on this plate please, but leave the plate unwashed.”
him but it felt so
Slowly, deliberately, he unhooked the silver cufflinks at his wrists. Pansy gasped behind him, recognizing his intent.
“Zabini, Parkinson.”
“You mean…I mean, no. I just…I never knew…if I had I would have…where did…” Potter babbled helplessly.
Harry came and sat next to Tom.
“Draco Malfoy, you
“I know. They’ve ruined you up in that tower.”
Severus Snape, accompanied by Albus Dumbledore, were hurrying down the corridor, Snape’s robe’s billowing out awesomely behind him.
Ronald Weasley and the extremely powerful Mudblood witch Granger were a case in point. Though, disturbingly, the red-head took to his burden with an enthusiasm that was surely an unhealthy form of denial.
, are you?” Blaise asked, his smug look fading into one of horrified awe.
“I know!” he said, trembling. Tom nodded. A deathbed promise was a deathbed promise. Magic could be harsh when a death acted as a bond.
Draco swiftly cut her off with a hand over her mouth.
“Dumbledore can’t use it. It is a family heirloom, it can only be used by the family that owns it.” Draco said curtly.
“Are you sure of that?”
“But…
“The Dark Lord told you many things, just before he failed to kill him. More than once. The Dark Lord is a failure, a half-blood without even the benefit of a Mudblood mother.”
Harry moved forward and helped the old man lay on his side, placing a cushion under his head and bestowing a gentle kiss on a hoary cheek.
How interesting that Draco could not see him, but knew that he was there…while he sat in plain sight of his prey, whose eyes failed to notice him.
“I told you. Draco.” Draco corrected him. “As for your question…I really think you can figure it out.”
However, since
Harry nodded seriously.
“What? Oh yes! Well it looks like Mr. Riddle here is fully manifested already. No drain, none at all. The infant is clearly glowing with magic. Why, he’s already got Harry’s eyes, by Merlin’s depleted left ball! Hmm, I never did figure out why he used up the left one, the Greeks always used the right testicle for that enchantment, perhaps the old man was senile and forgot. I’ll have to look into that before I grow senile myself. Never too early to start working on my memoirs, either, hmm.”
Narcissa smiled.
could. You don’t have to mention to them that I’m a wizard.” Draco suggested.
me I should be close to them! And you’re trying to court Harry anyway! He’s a Gryffindor!”
here.” Daphne stated.
“I would have gotten them on my own, anyway,” she said, annoyed.
“How unbecoming, to excuse your failures by claiming your rival has an inheritance of good luck!”
“Yes, he knows I am courting you.”
Draco turned and nodded to the American witch, whom Pansy had successfully pulled into their ranks. Then he looked at both of the pureblood exiles, reserving a moment of eye contact for Jamie especially.
“Pansy. Her grades are nearly as good as mine, despite her blood.” Draco corrected her.
“But-” Regulus started
“Exactly.”
“And the Dark Lord will mark him as an equal”
“I think you should go.” Granger said with a decidedly final air.
“No not really. It’s magically animated. You can do anything with magic, Jamie. You just have to learn how to use it.”
“Definitely.”
“Draco…I…I…” Draco cut off the Gryffindor with a kiss to his blood-flushed lips, then buried his face in Harry’s neck, moving his lips minimally in vague kissing motions against the pretty tendon he found there.
“Malfoys have very delicate and refined palettes.” Draco informed him haughtily. “Nevertheless, I will come and eat anyways. I’ll have to see if Severus can provide a potion of some kind.”
It was their Daddy’s favorite saying, one that always made their Papa roll his eyes and then smile and usually agree with whatever Daddy was arguing about.
“Very well, this should work just fine now they are truly identical.” Ollivander said, tipping a beaker of water into the tray.
“Hermione is going to kill me…” Harry groaned.
Draco turned and smiled at him.
“Granger?”
“You were going to open it yourself, ‘Mione. I saw you reaching for it.”
is it? Well, I suppose he is unfortunately named Heir. And being courted by my grand-nephew, how bizarre. Be careful with that one, my dear. He is still a Potter and a Gryffindor and marked for death by the Dark Lord, as soon as he can produce an Heir for our line.”
“No we love you, too, Aunt Jamie!” James assured her earnestly.
His father looked up at him, some resentment still in his eyes. The man’s emotional shields were paper-thin, Draco saw, and decided to give him the dignity of
Narcissa stood silently in the doorway, watching him sit behind the desk for a moment.
Potter was, apparently, infatuated with Draco. Potter fancied himself
“Merlin.”
But Lucius knew in the absence of its master, the Mark would be sensitive to a new dark lord awakening in the world, a potential future master who only had to claim his mark…
.” the other explained logically.
“Right. After you.” Potter said distrustfully.
“And which college are you enrolled in?” Jonas asked.
“Indeed it did.”
Potter stared at him, dumbstruck.
Shacklebolt raised a eyebrow.
“Like, what year it is.”
“Hey did Harry Potter give you his Marauders Map? I’ve heard stories…”
Professor Snape read over the parchment carefully, then nodded.

interrupt the flow of dreams!” the Dreamer retorted, shocked.
“Yeah, I know I’m a bit young, but I finished my undergrad in Quantum Physics when I was 20 and polished off a Masters in Theoretical Quantum Mathematics two years later! I think the admissions board was a bit skeptical of me, but when I started picking apart the formulae in their prospectus they were intrigued enough to let me in.”
“Uh. I was thinking…it’d be great to see Snape’s face…” Potter looked at the ground, blushing furiously.
The nursery was awash in midnight blues and liquid silver.
Draco looked at his husband, chagrinned at having been caught in the act of indoctrination.
“Yes, exactly. Infants are very fragile, but holding and feeding a baby is an experience you won’t forget.”
Bill snorted.
“Shall we check out our dorm now?”
Albus put a hand on his shoulder “into his hands you placed it, my boy, and I am sorry for my part in pushing you to that place. But it is not this Tom’s fault that he still holds it.”
“My name is Jamie.”
“Go ahead Mr. Malfoy.”
The green line ended in the familiar twisting symbol of a snake inside a skull.
“Marriage? But Draco, the boy’s mother was Muggle-born! Your father’s line-”
He neatly intercepted her hand as it left his arm, pressing two fingers into two pads of her palm in quick succession.
“I don’t understand. Why can’t you just tell me what they do?”
“Welcome to Merlin’s College!” Hermione Granger called out from the podium. “I’d like to remember all of our students that we have a
“The what, now?”
“What benefit could he possibly offer you to compare with the Dark Lord!”
“I think we’re hexing at shadows without more information.” Draco spoke quietly, but his voice carried all the authority of his position in Slytherin.
Harry lowered his face to rake his teeth over Draco’s exposed throat, humming something guttural from deep in his chest before his teeth worked their way up to chew on his ear.
Jonas gave him a peculiar look, like a sudden understanding had passed over him.
“The cat lady who came to my foster house told us,” Jamie said.
Clearly, yet another example of the consequences of hereditary magic left without the stabilizing influence of a blooded Heir.
Draco wondered if the chart of Potter’s weaknesses would be an exact replica of the one of his strengths?
“Anyways, they come in with their long, hairy, arms and their big, hard pillows, all ninja-like in the middle of the night. And we’re all sleeping, and I bet you’re even snoring 'cuz I can tell you’re a snorer!”
“That’s what she said.” James insisted. “Anyways, they’re supposed to be coming for a sneak attack tonight and we were all ready for them. Sorry you got caught in our trap – but maybe now we could outnumber them? Who’s this?”
“Madame Pomfrey, we require your services as a bonder, please.” Draco said formally.
“This…is disgusting. Don’t you Scourgify it after using it?”
At a touch to the bow, the wrapping paper elegantly peeled itself to the sides, and the hinged lid of the box popped slightly open.
, Potter. The ones you hold in your memories. She has a higher claim to them than you. Any pureblood would agree, including the ones on the Wizengamot. Just ask your friend Weasley. You have to give up the memories, give her her legacy as a Black.”
Draco rubbed his eyes, sure that he was seeing things, but the same little scene played itself out again.
Regulus blinked, looked at Lysander’s hand still in his. He apparently wasn’t going to get an answer until they separated into boys and girls dorms. He wasn’t sure if he should feel weird about that, but either way, holding Lysanders hand in the Common Room would open up one can of worms or another. He released it, surprised at how reluctant he was to do so.
no boundaries to what we can do, it’s just a matter of manipulating the right force in the right direction and anything is possible.”
“Did you see any Wrackspurts? Aunt Luna says they’re all over the station!”
threats!
“I’m not at all familiar with Muggle butchering methods.” Draco sniffed.
“Look at your gift.” Draco whispered back.
“Give this to Helios…no, wait. Give that back.” Draco scowled. Better not to trust either the Muggleborn or the impulsive Weasley to observe proper protocols. He modified the charm to deliver a sharp jolt of pain to any unauthorized tamperer.
“You can’t possibly think he should
But the six items scattered around the Dark Lord only brought a mocking smirk to the lips of the young Lord Malfoy.
“Harry. If you cast an Unforgiveable after taking the Oath, you’ll die.”
…around you. Things that always seem to go your way.
“Because he’s fucking gorgeous and I want him!” Draco snapped, then horrified, added “I wish to unite his royal bloodlines into the Malfoy family.”
“I told you we’re gonna get caught!”
Satisfied with the fate of the two Gryffindors, Draco began chanting the ritual that would cleanse the core of his wand in anticipation of the next ritual he would need to perform that night.
Draco! I cannot change them no matter how foolish they are! I may have decades left but my usefulness is at an end.”
Draco smirked as his godfather chuckled mockingly. He knew his godfather’s teaching style, but this was a rough Occulmency session even for him. Dumbledore must have ordered the lessons over his objections.
The five children ran towards where Draco was half atop Moony, being dragged around the yard in circles. Shouts of “Save poor Moony” and “Kill the Dragon” merged with Draco’s threats on the wolf’s life, countered by barks and growls and suspicious slurping noises, echoed around the yard for several moments.
fetish.
“I wish you could hold me like this more.”
Mrs. Weasley looked too, a far more clinical gaze than Draco’s, and stormed over towards him.
” Harry scrambled to cover himself under the sheets.
“Exactly. But today you actually look quite respectable. I’m shocked to find out you are actually quite capable of dressing yourself. Perhaps you’d find yourself ready to handle some of the more important family business this evening?” Draco asked politely.
He would at least maintain his dignity.
There. The only entrance being, predictably, from this office.
“Malfoy.”
Draco wrapped his arms around his prone boyfriend as best as he could and squeezed him snugly. The warmth of his body was making Draco feel drowsy, and the indefinable musky scent of his body from the nighttime sweat was pleasant and sweet. He could hear Harry’s slow, steady heartbeat where his ear was pressed against his chest.
“Finite incatatem.” Potter said, and Draco was mobile again.
“Do you need a healing spell?” Draco asked solicitously.
“No. I did that, with our bonding ritual. It…erased what he said to you, and everything after that.”
cabinet. This is bulk-stuff. The regular potions Dumbledore makes him put out by the bucketful, and that he sells off for money to get ingredients.”
The portrait of Harry Potter was in the center, the weird electric light still wrapped around him, only now looking like some mantle of hidden power.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good.”
“I will admit such an optimistic theory bears investigation, however I cannot say it sets my mind at ease.” Severus complained. “How would we test such a thing?”
, which I very much doubt, it wouldn’t work. Titles are inherited. Not transferred. Otherwise there’d be no end of jealous brothers and cousins trying to extort themselves into Lordship. It’s quite enough to have them trying to kill you, I think. Plenty of familial magic that will take vengeance for that.”
Lord, but let it pass.
The goblin’s glee had faded, and indeed the goblin itelf was fading to a rather pale shade.
“You should all be very proud of yourselves. You’ve just been sorted into the noblest House of the Hogwarts Four. Slytherin House. It is not an easy house to be a part of. The other houses are afraid of us, because we grow up to become very powerful witches and wizards. The other houses are
“Do homework. Hermione promised to help me with Charms.”
The artifact responsible was quickly placed on another childish head and continued its loathsome task, unaware or uncaring of the repercussions of its cruel decision.
“What do you want?”
Wait. Sublevel?
Lucius nodded, then inclined his head towards the gargoyle.
“What-t-t-t the f-f-f-fuck?” Harry chattered, his eyes bright with shock. Draco quickly moved back away from him, grabbing for his robes.
“Harry,   you should be sleeping.” Draco fussed.
“Poetry” (Absolutely not. As demonstrated by reaction to the Weasley girl’s attempt, this is clearly not something Potter appreciates.)
Draco cheered inwardly as Potter’s face crumpled in defeat.
“So for this generation, at least, the House of Black is…crippled. Have you been to Gr-, Grim, Gr-, what the hell?”
“Not…Dark…Harry.” Draco wheezed painfully into the ground.
Her voice came rather cold this time.
“Hi little Scorpius, I’m James.”
with someone
He smiled gently, stroking his husband’s face and hair.
Draco ignored him.
“How are we going to figure out what I am?”
“Let me up. We should wash for dinner.”
“All the pretty little kiddies and the yummiest one has to be soooo hard-to-get.” He licked his lips lasciviously.
“Usually, the lies and refusals are more instructive than the open answers.”
Chapter 1
Draco had partially chosen the Sceptre as a message to the headmaster. The Crystal Sceptre was, as he had told Potter, originally created to serve the Light. A long-ago Malfoy had slaughtered an entire temple full of Light priests in order to obtain it, and twisted it to possibly the most vile purpose imaginable.
“Please, call me Hermione. I’ve never stood on ceremony among friends and colleagues, let alone family.” She called out.
Draco carefully pulled the fabric up out of the box and spread it out.
“I’ll confess my experience among both is relatively limited-”
something!" he whispered to the Head Auror.
His bedroom door.
“You’ve completed his scroll.”
the marriage, as odd as that was.
“The Map? As in the Marauders Map?” Draco asked quickly.
“Stir it into the nitrogen, which will react and then settle. Then we need an electric current running through the mix, but first filtered through the same amount of the second element, silicon. So…yeah…run the wires like that…then into the silicon, divided evenly, yeah. Great. Okay, I’m clear you can turn on the current.”
“He refused my hand of friendship in first year.” He stated evenly.
“You know what I mean. Potter might have better blood, and even be a rival for power, or much more powerful if he comes of age. But who do you think will really win? Can you even really make a prediction?”
you understand, sons?”
“What seems to be the problem here?” Snape’s smooth baritone slid into the conversation, causing the three Gryffindors to jump guiltily.
Draco leaned forward again, allowing his streaming eyes to splash into the liquid. They hissed as they struck the surface, and the glowing fog suddenly swirled into the liquid and a freezing cold seemed to emanate from the cauldron.
Lucius looked vaguely tired.
“Oh, don’t worry Frankie, you’ll just be the
“It was…in first year my father told me to befriend Potter, so hopefully he would be in Slytherin as is proper for a powerful wizard. I knew only what my father told me about him, and my efforts only made an enemy.”
[I accept my inheritance]
Severus whirled around, back straight, and disappeared down the hallway.
“He’s here!” Potter whispered furiously to him, half crouched, pulling backwards, trying to turn around.
The students and teachers applauded his placement, so callous to the personal tragedy being enacted right before their eyes.
won’t even say out loud, even though he’s dead.”
Probably not, they were Potter’s own relatives, despite everything. And were listed lower on that list than Draco’s own name.
“But then
“If you will all excuse me, I have a Potter to torment.”
is one of them?” Harry shot back.
Now the twins eyes were narrowed at him.
Draco looked at him sharply.
“They’re like licorice, only strawberry-flavored!” Jamie enthused, biting off a piece.
“See you at breakfast, Harry!”
“It’s him. But how?”
The tapping was back, in another area, even more subtle.
Draco repeated the kiss.
“Mmm, Draco…”
“I can feel it inside me, Draco. That piece of

“Perhaps.”
“I will, Dad. Thanks.”
“Why not?”
“Are you well, my friend? It is a lot to adjust to.” Lucius asked, a curdle of uncertain fear settling in his stomach as the man didn’t meet his eyes.
“I want every bludger on the Weasleys. Take turns concentrating on them.”
“Oh! I…um…I wanted to speak with Mr. Weasley.”
“Even for his daughter? His
Not quite fast enough, Draco noted. The green jet of the curse from Potter’s wand was halfway to Draco already.
?” he growled sexily.
“Maybe a bit.” He admitted, then grasped Harry’s arm desperately as he started to turn away, “Not like I let the Dark Lord think! Just…Harry, I want you to
Harry gestured at the parchment in his hands. No, it was Muggle paper, but he recognized his father’s handwriting, shaky as it was.
?” Weasley asked anxiously.
Harry just looked at him closely for a moment, eyes clear and penetrating behind those spectacles, then nodded. Just…nodded.
“I am aware of that, Mother.” Draco said, raising a hand in a motion he’d learned from his father, effectively cutting off her arguments.
The muggleborn imitated his attempt to touch the package, with the same result. The two turned to look at Harry, who was still petting the other swan.
Draco reverted to the formal hierarchy that would reinforce those harder emotions.
“But the math, man, unless you’ve got a supercomputer hiding around here that’s really going to suck.”
~Albus Dumbledore~
Though, maybe it was just that Draco was the last one of many to die.
“Good. Tonight, why don’t you get to know Lysander better. She seems like a good friend. Is she a she?”
“I am Lord Ignatius of Flint, glad of your acquaintance, cousin of the Earth.”
And once again, Severus found himself with no option but to seek out power, make himself valuable to a slightly less objectionable Lord, in hopes that he might be protected as an asset.
“Potter very nearly killed me, sir. I expect if he hadn’t spotted the Snitch at that moment, he would have dashed us both to the pitch at that speed. He is insane sir, he shouldn’t be flying.”
