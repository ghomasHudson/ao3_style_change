“Your sweater is so soft.” Harry mumbled into Draco’s shoulder, interrupting him talking about a small village his cousins lived in (and practically owned). Draco was very annoyed about this interruption but he went with it anyways.
“Who let you drive Ron? You are an absolutely dreadful driver. We’d be lucky to even make it back to the ground.” Ron laughed a bit and Hermione pouted, crossing her arms over her chest and returning her attention back out the window. “Nobody answered my questions.”
“What the fuck? Are you pulling my leg Harry? This is not funny.” Hermione’s breathing picked up again and Ron squeezed her shoulder.
“I don’t have much muggle money, can we get one instead?” Ron fished in his pockets and pulled out a few paper bills and a few coins.
“It’s just a little long in the back,” Draco ran his hand across the back of Harry’s neck. “I could fix it for you.” Harry tried to make eye contact with Draco but he was so focused on Harry’s hair.
“We are going to Edinburgh to go fight a woman named Joanne. She’s the author of our books, she wrote our story. People loved us and her but she kept pushing her awful and harmful ideas about people. It’s unforgivable really.” Ron moved his hand up to rub Hermione's shoulder as he explained. “We did not tell anybody where we were going because we knew they wouldn't approve but it needs to be done. Fighting is a last resort really. We want to talk to her first and try and convince her to stop spreading hate and fear about transgender women.” Hermione took a second to absorb all the information in silence.
“Should we get a hotel room? Or at least stop for the night?” Ron asked. When he looked around the only one still awake was Draco. He looked in the rearview mirror and made eye contact with him. Draco shrugged. Ron nodded and started the descent to the ground. He landed on an empty back road and drove out to join the muggle population. He found a small beat down hotel and pulled into the parking lot. When the car stopped Harry woke up and pulled himself away from Draco. He looked at Draco’s shoulder and saw a spot of drool which filled him with embarrassment and dread. Draco followed Harry’s gaze and saw the spot. He shrugged to Harry.
“My thoughts exactly. No sense of humor, bit dimwitted, and your
“Draco, I promise I wasn´t making fun of you.” His voice was soft and eyes back to their soft green, wide and so,
He flinched when Pansy clapped her hands in front of his face eyes still stormy. “I didn´t do anything!” Draco sneered pushing her hands away with disdain. “You liar! Weasley told me he looked heartbroken after you two talked in the library.” She looked triumphant and Draco gaped at her for a minute before he found his speech.
“You can call me Harry, if you want.” Draco snorted at the hopeful note in his voice and tapped at Potters wrist to remind him to let go, which he did in a haste and with bright red cheeks. “Not a chance in hell,
The tournament itself was horrifying and Draco thanked Merlin that it was over and they can continue on with a normal year…
Ok, so that may have stopped Draco’s heart dead in its tracks
“I should, uh, head inside. Unless there’s anything else...”
“Of all topics, you decided to talk about work on our date?” Harry said with a raised eyebrow
That comment is your reward for reading through to the very end, thank you!
… So Voldemort’s back
“Yeah, as a… as a date?”
“What I said was wrong, I always knew you were a good person, and what I said clearly didn’t come off that way. I honestly figured you’d be working to create laws, not protect them. You’re so smart and creative and having you in that position would make my job a lot easier. But I still feel bad and I want to make up for it. So do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend?” Harry rambled on.
Harry rushed into the classroom for their meet up and sat down so quickly he almost fell out of his chair. Harry explained his detentions and his plans for a new Defense Against the Dark Arts class. He explained that there were some reservations about including Slytherin but really wanted Draco to join and the look on his face when saying that... Draco knows that he was the only one to fight for Slytherin, and he did that for Draco, this was going to hurt.
Everyone knows soul mates are a thing, but there’s no magical moment when you meet. The only way you can even tell is by what you choose to do. Whatever is written on your skin shows up on your soul mate’s skin in the same place, and when they wash it off, it’s gone. Simple enough. Draco had never gone out of his way to find his soul mate, if they’re meant to be they’ll find each other. His soul mate seemed to be very forgetful though, always writing down times, places, lists, everything. He finds that really endearing and in a way comforting. He was waiting outside of a classroom talking with a couple Slytherins about the cute doodles his soulmate drew when they clearly should have been paying attention in class. He looked up to see Potter staring at him, seemingly covering his arm, the marks weren’t as noticeable on his dark skin but it was clear to Draco what was going on.
“What? Harry, I just want to go home”
They were greeted and ordered their drinks, while waiting for them to be made, there was silence.
“No. Bugger off”
After the Battle Draco defaced his Dark Mark, the scars emerged but anything was better than a reminder of his failures and everything he’s lost.
“What are you staring at, Malfoy? Jealous?”
“I’d like that… there’s nothing to distinguish this from any other study session and I’ve kinda been wanting to for a while so can I kiss you? You don’t have to say yes, I just thought because now we know how the other feels and-”
“Can I, could we, if you’d like, uh… I still really like you and want you to know that and to show you and… kiss?” Draco somehow stammered out followed by vague hand gestures.
But, he just HAD to go and ruin everything with his big mouth in 3rd year.
“Remember: Common Poison antidote is teal and Uncommon poison antidote is green”
So, I have a couple things in the works, I have no idea when they will be going up, but please let me know if you would be interested in reading more of my writing! I am currently writing a couple Harry Potter AUs and I have a Voltron fic that I have been thinking about posting. LASTLY go read @happylittletrees3, their stuff is fantastic!
“My story? Ok… well, nothing about the first couple years at Hogwarts was a surprise. Sorted into Slytherin...”
“... So how's your new position treating you? Everything you hoped it’d be?”
“You’re not alone, and you don’t have to be”
A low laugh escapes Harry’s mouth at the reminder of their first kiss.
“Because you looked pathetic and if I can keep you from failing a class that’s what’s going to happen like it or not”.
“Please Draco. First of all, you overwork yourself enough as it is, and don’t argue with me on that, you know it’s true. Second, taking one day off will not kill you, I’ll cover it myself if I have to, and third… you kinda promised me a date back at Hogwarts, and with everything that happened, I feel like we kinda owe each other that much”
And ok, that was just him being stubborn.
At the end of that week was an exam, one that Draco did not want Harry to fail. Harry’s not completely awful, he knows this. Most of their interactions had just been banter and snide comments made by both of them, nothing too humiliating or scarring. And it’s not like he cared or anything because if Harry fails he won’t feel bad or anything. So pulled up the sleeve of his robe and on his arm wrote
He could’ve written that better, but he has to keep up appearances. He helped though and hopefully Potter doesn’t see him as a total arse.
Draco once again felt warm tears run down his cheeks, dammit Harry, not knowing what to do, he didn’t wipe them away, he just stared down at his lap contemplating how to go about talking, this wasn’t something he was used to and those weren’t new feelings.
“It worked, you noticed me, didn’t you?”
“Sorry about that, I wanted to surprise you”
“I’d like that, and, we’re alone now, what if this was a date?”
Draco finally understood what it meant to have a soulmate. This wasn’t just the person he was destined to be with, this was the person who he knew he would never get tired listening to, the person who brought out the best in him and he did the same in return. This was the person he wanted to annoy and tease and love for the rest of his days and he knew that in every timeline, in every new beginning they would meet and would always find their way back to one another.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The first term was ending and it had been about a month since everything with Harry happened… a month of awkward glances, avoidance in hope the other will forget or go away, and a month of shame. Everything was different, the world didn’t seem to be as black and white as it once was. The words written across his skin that once brought him joy are under a different light and now bring anxiousness and a reminder of the pain, confusion, and worry that were in Harry’s eyes the night Draco confronted him. Ugh, that was way too poetic, no more angsty music.
Solely for his own benefit and not to help Harry out. And continued to assist Har-himself when it comes to their test. Ok, he did it to help Harry, the guy looked awful and is floundering, sue Draco for having a heart. Once he returned to his dorm Draco saw a message where his potions “notes” once were in familiar messy handwriting,
Draco casted the counter spell after chewing Harry out for his poor decision making skills. He then, begrudgingly, helped Harry stand up.
“I know they are not going to want me to join, they… they don’t fight for the right cause and I want to join and your Defense group is really cool and stuff, but I can’t. I want to fight against everything my parents believe in. I can’t! They’re so wrapped up in everything if anyone with the Malfoy name is even caught looking at someone like you… we’re all dead. I need to protect them, I- I have to”
Harry quirked his eyebrow gave him a look that said it all, he knew that they were going to have to discuss this and Draco started rambling
Draco rolled his eyes at that and decided that there wasn’t really any point in arguing, because going to a meeting with writing up and down his arm isn’t exactly professional. So he just acted like nothing was out of the ordinary. He went to his meetings, made some arrests, and called people out on their bullshit; the usual.
“If you want it to be” Harry said with blushed cheeks and his head ducked down
“Better than nothing, but you’re right, someday we can go on a real date” Draco responded optimistically
“You hate me, why did you help me during our potions exam?”
Draco closed the door, took a breath, and slid down the door frame. He was sitting on the floor, which in any other circumstance would be unacceptable, but at this moment Draco didn’t care.
The day had closed and Draco was packing up when he heard someone sneak up behind him… which didn’t go well.
“Thank you, Head Auror, but I was going to apparate. You could come with if you’d like though”
“I want to make sure you get home safely”
“You climbed a tree?!” Harry almost gasped in disbelief
“Draco. You’re so smart but can be so stupid. I’m here because I want to, because I care about you”
Harry let his arm go. Draco could have left… but he didn’t, he wanted to hear his soulmate out, after all. Plus Harry owed him one hell of an apology.
“I suppose I will see you another time, goodnight Potter”
“Of you? Never.” Draco deadpanned, rolling his eyes, “What are you doing here?”
“Oh, uh Harry? Can I ask you something?”
Hermione nodded. The feeble smile did not gain in appreciable strength.
"What?" Draco was irritated with Potter's rudeness; he was speaking, wasn't he? Not the thing, just trampling over someone's thought process like a bloody hippogriff in an apothecary!
"Good chap," Draco grinned, his lips flushed and unsteady. "Ready? You take the levitate; start with that. I'll follow."
, Harry. Don't say that. Don't try it on, don't send me off. Or even think to. Please don't. We're worth more than that-we have to talk. We must, it's important—it's our lives, Harry!"
"Mmm-hmmm," Harry hummed, complacent, "sure you do, Draco," and Draco nearly shot his load then and there.
"You—er, you," Harry let his words escape the confines of his tight throat and tighter chest only in dribs and drabs, unwilling. He never should've uttered the last few—that was incredibly obvious. But it was too late. "You might not—probably don't—care." He gulped, eyes cast down upon the darker shadows that lay between them, the heap of tumbled coverlet and sheet, where he maintained his death grip on Draco's elegant joint. "I mean, do you?"
“Or you,” Harry shot back, opening his eyes again, his slightly reddened lips twitching into the slightest of grins. “Playing at being a monk, you are. You’re keeping yourself to yourself again, Malfoy, and that’s not so good either. Hermione’s been mentioning she’s concerned for you and Ron too. You’ve not dated anyone seriously since Theo Nott, not according to what they've told me, and how long ago was that, right? A year? Two years? More, even?”
Luna giggled, promptly discarding her coffee. She rose unsteadily to her feet, her lemon-hued sundress and scarlet-patterned shawl swishing about her, and cast the swathe of her abundant hair over one shoulder.
"Right, then," Draco allowed. "Try a quaerat aliquis, Harry. Just in case."
“Not easily managed, I assure you,” Draco chuckled, patiently staying precisely where he was, neither shifting away nor coming too close. “But I’ve got a decently heroic enough lead to follow, right here at the office. Have had for several years now. Trust me, it does change a fellow, all that exposure to sainthood. One minute left, by the way.”
He'd his messy hair tugged by clacking teeth for his insolence.
Honestly, Potter was like that all too often. This 'companionship' lark was not all it was cut up to be.
"Darling," his Mum prompted gently, "you were saying? About your Harry, Draco? And Malfoy heirlooms?"
But he couldn’t and Draco shouldn’t and that was a fanciful pipedream his mental musician was playing him, and for now he could only look—and dream, eyes wide open. And
haven combined. Owned by him as he owned that belly—the soft spaces behind kneecaps. That his morning-after breath and his sharp toenails were really safe handholds Harry could cling to, as needed.
fine. And shut up about my feelings, cause you're the one to blame for me even having them, arse. Now, let's go the fuck
indeed
, months in the making, as it started out as a gift ficlet, at Christmas and then it kept going on and on and on, forever! Which is why it's huge, yes. It's unBeta'd becuase dear
Nev yelped and rescued his tilting teacup from the middle of his porridge, glaring his indignation across the intervening space.
Potter bustled into the room, forestalling Draco’s nascent thoughts of going in search of him. “Sorry, sorry, but there’s this situation upstairs and I--well, Kreacher and I,” he gulped, “we’ve had our hands full, shall we say? Anyway, are you hungry? Kreacher’s got dinner already laid out in the dining room. Well...it's food, anyway. Of a sort. But it's posh. You'll probably like it, really.” He swept over to the drinks table, a casual lift of a forefinger causing the wine bottle to startle and instantly begin pouring out two generous glasses. "Oh, yes. Here," he said, catching them up. "You must be parched; I know I am."
He should make sure Potter hadn’t lost any significant amount of weight, as that might make a difference to the match. Of course, the shared showers would happen
He needed. He’d not say ‘Stay!’ otherwise.
"Seriously, you're mad, alright? I'm not--repeat, not!--having a child!" Draco shouted, highly irked to be fetched up to the entry to the Mansion's latest addition: the Sports Room. Billiards, trikes, an entire funhouse arcade in miniature, ensconced right in the midst of his formerly staid marble manse. "Not of my own, at least. Leave off, I say! I'm warning you!"
Of course this wasn't proceeding well, but then he'd not planned it out, either. He'd only just spewed out the words he'd been thinking and damn the consequences. Thus, hearts were broken unnecessarily, Harry knew. He should've known better by now, at least.
Harry gulped, blinking at him with lips parted—Draco lost another second or two to useless reverie over the gorgeous way his lover's throat moved when he swallowed—and then grinned down at Draco's upturned face, with none of the respect for the momentous occasion Draco was fully primed to expect. The git giggled—or, rather he snorted, a tiny little huff of rueful laughter Draco found entrancing and irritating, all at once.
Draco didn't like to think of the future. It was coming, he knew; that was enough.
“Christ, Draco…oh, oh,
Harry collapsed back, exhausted and high as a sodding kite on sheer euphoria. But Malfoy kept at it, wringing the last spurts of come from his cock. And then exploded, flooding Harry’s arse with Wizarding spunk and a flow of magical essence that left them both dazed and confused.
Stupid Potter was already moaning his idiot glee over such rough treatment—Draco had to grin at the berk fondly, but the berk couldn't see him doing it with his head jammed into the pillows like that, so all was well.
This was growing old, Harry decided. Ron was in terrible form this morning; Hermione must have wrung him completely dry last night.  His brain was clearly absent.
Harry giggled, and Draco hid a smile. He'd have shared it but he'd already given away his whole hand. No use encouraging Potter to believe he was a complete wuss…even if he was. But only for Potter.
He'd mucked it up—the most crucial moment of his life and he'd more than stepped wrongly; he'd hared off completely into a fantasy world, by himself. Delusional. All by his lonesome.
he screamed at himself in that eternal pause, feeling the veriest fool for forgetting.
“No more than me. Oh!” Harry closed his eyes in blissful anticipation, sliding his hand round Draco’s nape and urging his face just that perfect miniscule fraction closer, more than happy to indulge in another.  “No more than me, love.”
your Mum
"Father, really."
"And bet on it, too," Finch-Fletchley murmured slyly. He nudged MacMillan, who'd passed out earlier, during Round Two of Truth or Dare, and was right on the verge of blacking out again. "Right, Ern?"
“Look," Draco gulped hard, brows set in a determined line across his forehead. "Just look how much happier you’ve been since we’ve started sharing this flat! You needed a real friend, not a bloody jumped-up housekeep!” He flung out a helpless sort of hand gesture, reeling with unspeakable fustratration and angry, so angry at this bloody emotional Bludger his best mate was hurling at him--and fresh-dipped in a pain, a very strange and inexplicable agony. How could Harry not realize?
it about Potter that had such a strange effect upon him?
"Better," he said. Draco simply nodded, smiling, letting his wandering fingers do the talking. They took a little pleasure stroll right into the warm creases of Harry's Muggle denim trousers, and right smart about it.
"No, really. I mean it. I can't do that—I know better, alright?"
Harry quirked his eyebrows, a knowing glint gilding the lovely toady-green of his eyes.
"Yes, Harry."
“I’ll fucking skin you, Potter, if you do,” hissed Malfoy, and all at once he was quite, quite terrifyingly serious. “Don’t even consider it. You’ll find yourself hexed so hard you’ll not know your arse from a sodding hole in the ground!
“Harry?” Luna tilted her glass to the side, so that it nearly spilt, peering at him curiously though the pink glaze the receding wine had left behind. “Are you alright? You seem sad.”
There went serenity, out the bloody window! Then there was mouth scorching eager mouth—a hard ridge of jawbone, a poking nose, a wet slurp of tongue and chapped lips—and Harry could barely inhale through it, nor care if he did. It was all about being taken roughshod and forcefully—claimed, then, was it?—and Draco's hips thrust up methodically, joggling Harry's insides to jelly.
“I do,” Harry said firmly, releasing Draco’s arm finally. “Right. Do come along. Let’s have our dinner and then I’ll show you my problem. But first you can tell me how you’ve been going along while I’ve been away. I’m starved for news, I swear. I hated not being able to Owl or floo you, but it can't be helped.” He shrugged, grimacing, and led off the way to the dining room. “It’s my least favourite part of the position, actually,” he added, glancing back over his shoulder and biting his lower lip in an engaging manner. “Not being in contact with any of my friends and family for so long. I abhorred that part, honestly."
Draco, hunkering down upon his heels and haunches, schooled his face into an even stricter bland mask as the wave of tidal paternal ire rolled deathly inarticulate through the Floo, emanating like a freak tornado from the reserved ice floes of his parent's newly re-elegant Mansion.
Three hundred sixty-five days had, after all, already fled behind him, a collection of tastes and smells and magics, touches and views and well-met strangers he could simply not imagine being without.  Solstice morning dawning over a desert resplendent with the symbols of Pre-Columbian magic?
, Ron. I know you. You'll fall right back into your same old, same old poor habits and me and Draco here are sick to death of your grousing, yeah? And Hermione, too. In fact, can't bloody well stand this a'tall anymore, actually—we
“Urgh! Harry!”
"Not gibberish, Harry—Latin. Take a gander."
Harry groaned. He was mucking up, left and right.
"Brilliant."
"What! What are you trying to even say, Draco? Spit it out!"
Draco's voice was low and cool and he seemed to have withdrawn deep within himself, impervious to the quiet sounds of people about them, giggled and sipping, spending time with friends or family whilst out shopping. Just as an island, rising spare and tall, caught meditating amidst teeming reefs.
Draco relented, resettling the legs of his chair on the lino with care, but only so he could loudly scrape it back and away from the table. He plopped down his mug with a thumping flourish as he went, rising regally to his slippered feet and enjoying his slight advantage of height over Potter. It enabled him to appear all that more smugly synpathetic.
Florabunda nodded happily, making further notes on her ledger, and causing a whole flurry of grey ringlets to descend from her ill-kempt bun. Draco could swear he saw leafy, vine-y tendrils entwined with the hot pink ribbons that had failed to bind them, but that wasn't important now. If the Witch lived up to her rep as a tip-top Wizarding florist, she could stick whatever she wished in her mop; Draco couldn't give a hoot.
And climbed right onto Draco's cot, the sly little sexy arse that he was, straddling Draco's hips and tugging down the thin blanket as fast as he could manage. Draco's cock went from limp and shriveled to hard-as-thrice-fired Damascus steel in less than ought-five seconds. All the blood left his throbbing temples and travelled south so fast he went sodding dizzy again at the pure sensation of mach speed.
He wasn´t usually a deep sleeper but he didn´t notice the other student walking down the stairs, nor did he notice the blanket draped over him and the sudden warmth by his side.
Draco should have realized that wouldn´t be the end of it, but between Slytherins things were usually cleared up after a little shoving and hexing so he hadn´t been worried. It didn´t occur to him that Pansy was specifically choosing to push him into Potter because he refused to confess until the third time.
This whole mess had only started when Pansy had – in a roundabout way – tried to get him to act on his feelings. Not only had he gotten numerous bruises from that, he´d also gotten detention. Any and all distractions from school were just not acceptable, especially distractions that landed him in detention.
It wasn´t really a kiss. More a brush of lips but Draco let his eyes slip close and exhaled shakily against Potter´s lips. Harry seemed to take that as a sigh and Draco felt his stomach swoop when he increased the pressure their lips sliding together almost clumsy with nerves.
Potter was handsome like always, hair looking like he´d just been shagged, green eyes bright against his dark skin and broad shoulders nicely displayed by a visibly old and fading muggle shirt.
“Now stop wasting my time and do something useful for once.” He sneered playfully and Harry grinned wider. “For once?” he asked with a raised brow sounding slightly offended but still grinning.
He felt Potter´s eyes on his back trying badly to ignore his and Weasleys bickering. “What´d you do that for?” Potter hissed sounding righteously angry. “You´ll see.” Was all Weasley said to that and he could almost hear Potter´s teeth clenching “What?” he asked again.
“I don´t need your help, Potter. I´m capable of carrying my own books.” He almost hissed and watched as Potters expression fell almost like a kicked puppy further accentuated by Weasleys amused snort. “I know that. I just thought…” he trailed off green eyes roaming over Draco´s face and Merlin be damned he was sure the attention was making him blush. The answer came in form of Potter´s smug smile and glinting eyes which unfortunately only made everything worse.
, Pansy.” He hissed voice almost toneless.
“You should go to bed.” Draco mumbled but despite his words shuffled closer to the warmth hands fisting into the blanket. Potter´s shoulders shook with soft laughter and Draco felt his own lips tug into a smile.
He couldn´t change the past and he´d always have to work at least twice as hard as other people but he´d made his peace with that after his trials. He´d tried
“Alright. Thank you for that insight, Potter.” He heaved a sigh. Clearly that was the best outcome he could have hoped for in this situation. “As you can see I´m quite busy right now so please leave.” Turning back towards the sink he rinsed out the now clean cauldron.
“I wasn´t making fun of you!” Potter protested sounding urgent. “
“Potter.” He found himself speaking before he´d really thought of what to say but when the intensity of those green eyes snapped onto him it would have been useless either way. “You´re not the only one.” He managed willing down a blush as Potter mustered his face looking for something Draco couldn´t name. Finally, the furrow in his brow lifted and with a soft smile and a cock of his head to the side his fingers and leg stilled.
“Potter.” His dry tone would have anyone else sit back down to avoid awkwardness but apparently Potters stupidity excelled even that of ogres. He was next to Draco in the blink of an eye gathering the remaining books with a blinding smile and gentle eyes.
He made his way to the dungeons as slowly as he could without being late and came to a halt in front of the door to one of the classrooms. Reluctantly he knocked at the door opening it when he heard a soft “Come in”.
By dinner time it seemed the murmurs had only grown louder and Draco barely ate. He shoved his food around on his plate, stomach twisting in aching knots at the thought of thousands of eyes on him. It reminded him of meetings in dark houses where one wrong look could degrade you to snake food.
Honestly, it was Potter´s own fault. Draco could´ve just as well landed on his hands and knees. At least then he wouldn´t have to deal with Potter and his stupid fucking eyes. Instead of letting him fall Potter had, quick as he was, reached out and grabbed his waist, what ultimately resulted in him sort of dipping Draco.
He woke punctually as always and gradually made his ways out of bed. He was surprised he´d been able to fall asleep at all but it barely could´ve been more than four hours. He felt sluggish and queasy and was convinced it was because he´d have to spend an hour alone with Slughorn.
“You are terrible friends and I´m disowning you.” He threatened in a huff. It was of little effect, though.
“Parkinson.” He hedged and could´ve sworn he saw a mop of black hair move behind a pillar. “That stupid wrench is trying to make me admit that I-“ he cut himself off, flushing horribly at what he almost confessed, or rather to who.
Reasons like his unfairly beautiful green eyes and dashing smile with those ridiculous dimples and by god did Draco have a thing for his broad shoulders and firm chest. It didn’t even bother him much that Potter gained a few inched on him, barely noticeable as they were when he slouched, since the war his proud posture dwarfed Draco´s slim figure.
“No, you don´t. I mean I like you, romantically.” Potter sounded almost sullen, like a pouting child and Draco felt his lips twitch at that until the words registered to him.
He cast three cleaning charms in quick succession before slinking back into the bedroom. For a second he stood at the legs of his bed, hesitating, not nearly tired enough to get back to bed and so he snatched a random book off his nightstand as well as his blanket. Casting
A strangled scream later he found himself pressed to the floor a heavy weight resting on him. His heart was beating heavily in his chest and his fingers twitched helplessly when Potter groaned on top of him pushing himself up on one hand and rubbing his head. Green eyes blinked open and for what felt like hours they just stared at each other.
The Love seat closest to the fire, surprisingly, was already occupied and Draco stood still for a second reconsidering if he should just head off to bed. Before he could decide the student turned and Draco was pinned in place by green eyes.
It honestly felt a bit like he couldn´t catch a break. Just as soon as he´d made his peace with being friends with Potter shit just had to go and ruin everything. Not only had he –
Draco flushed unattractively when their eyes met mortified by the amused grin on the other boy’s face as he watched Draco. In a dramatic swirl of robes Draco turned and left the library shamefaced. If Weasley now too got the ridiculous notion about him likening the prat who lived he would be the laughing stock of the whole school in a matter of hours.
If there was one teacher that absolutely hated everything about Draco it was Slughorn. The man was a terror and even if Draco knew his potions were brewed to perfection he rarely got above an Acceptable. “Yes, Headmistress.” He nodded to her and she looked at him a second longer something almost gentle in her gaze. “Enjoy the rest of your dinner.” She said in passing and Draco grimaced down at his plate. He probably wouldn´t be able to stomach anything tonight anyways. He told Blaise he´d go to bed early and left for the eighth-year accommodations.
He peered in almost hoping it wasn´t Professor Slughorn but found him sitting at the desk up front. He must have been teaching a first-year class before, all the pots and utensils were still at the desks and slimy with a green sort of liquid. Half the desks were sprinkled in the substance and one desk in particular looked like the potion had exploded.
He found himself ringing for an answer but when nothing came out Potter only scoffed, putting the books in his hand down on a random shelf he took a step forward almost menacingly grabbing Draco by the wrist.
Draco finished his potion just a tick before Granger did and they both went up to put their labeled test tubes on Slughorn´s desk.
Draco inwardly groaned it would´ve done him good to have
The hand on his hip gripped him tighter and Potter´s other hand moved to his cheek thumb smoothing over the ridge of his cheekbone as he kissed him firmly. Draco felt hazy with it. Potter´s lips weren´t soft, they were rough enough from being bitten that they created a delicious friction when they slid against his. He lifted his other hand to tug at Potters hair running his fingers through the unruly locks like he´d secretly wanted to since probably second year.
“Oh, how nice of you to get help, my dear boy.” If Draco wasn´t busy being terribly offended he wouldn´t have been surprised. So far Potter´s grades had never been worse than his which was a crime in and off itself since the bloody prat had no idea what he was doing at any time.
Malfoy!”
“So should you.” The Gryffindor teased and Draco arched his back a little humming in agreement when it twinged painfully gradually waking him up.
He saw Potter´s eyes flicker down to his own lips and nervously licked them. Green eyes followed the motion and he watched the dark skin of his throat move in a swallow. Potter looked back up again his eyes appearing darker as his pupil expanded. They were close enough that Draco could feel Potter´s breath on his face and forced himself to uncurl one of his hands to raise it to Potters shoulder. He tugged softly on the ugly knitted sweater and Potter followed willingly, their lips meeting in a soft brush.
After Potter left it took another two hours to clean everything. One and a half hours longer than his detention was supposed to last but Slughorn didn´t say anything about that. Draco was bone tired once he made his way to the dormitories and fell face first onto his bed, asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.
He knew that wand.
When Draco didn´t answer Potter decided it was classy to snap his finger in Draco´s face. Which was not adorable or cheeky, that fucking bastard. Draco snapped out of it, hoping he hadn´t mooned over Potter right in his face, which, he never did that Pansy was a fucking liar. He pushed at Potters chest and stumbled upright with less grace than he ever remembered having.
“Oh.” He croaked, clearing his throat as color rose to his cheeks “I´ve been sleeping alright.” He averted his gaze and glared when Pansy and Weasley whispered to each other before breaking into laughter. “Great!” Potter beamed and Draco´s eyes snapped back onto him. Noticing the slight circles under his eyes. He looked better than he had the night in the common room but by far not how a well-rested person should look.
Draco groaned softly sitting up and blinking his eyes open only to find wide emerald eyes staring back into his merely an inch away. Draco felt his face flush with embarrassment and cursed his frail complexion for the color was unmistakable.
earnest, looking directly into his soul. His throat clicked on a dry swallow and it felt like hours before he got a hold of himself, averting his eyes. “Fine.”, he muttered embarrassed.
Since studying would be utterly impossible, he´d put away the books and hightail it out of the library hopefully without being shamefaced by the boy who lived to annoy him.
“Draco?” Potter spoke again after what felt like hours. “Yeah?” he mimicked the hushed whisper even though there was no way anyone could have heard them all the way into the dormitories. But it made this feel intimate, almost like a dream.
“He´s a walking disaster.” Draco sniffed frowning when Potter laughed at something Weasley said. “See, what could possibly go wrong?” Pansy needled and Draco glared at her, turning his head so fast it gave a soft crack. “He could hear me.” He spat and Pansy sighed deeply patting him on the arm.
“You suppose?” his voice sounded icy to his own ears and successfully wiped the smile off Potters face. “Yes. I mean, no. I´m really sorry I didn´t mean to- it wasn´t my intention to make you uncomfortable.” Even Potter stuttering was adorable. He kept shifting his weight, green eyes wide with something like shock and bloody hell he kept licking his lips. This needed to stop. “Okay.” He conceded with a sigh and a short nod. “So, we´re alright?” Draco mustered the hopeful expression on Potter´s face tempted to say yes but hesitated.
“Oh!” Potter sounded surprised at his offer. “No, that´s ok.” Draco felt his stomach drop in disappointment. After the happy greeting and smiles he had somehow expected a different response. Which was honestly pathetic, Potter hadn´t even been mean about it but Draco felt like hiding. “Oh…” he said slowly not sure how to answer. Potter must have noticed that he was disappointed though because he gently put his palm on Draco´s shoulder trying to meet his eyes with a hesitant smile.
“This is how I die.” He whispered more to himself than to anyone else but the rumble of Potters laugh let him know he heard. “Wanna tell me what all this is about now?” Potter said lowly and Draco could feel his breath against his neck. “No, thank you, I´d rather die now.” He grumbled still slumped against Potter. He couldn´t make himself get up and only when he shifted did he notice that Potter had slung his arm around Draco´s waist. The dark tan of his skin looked almost ridiculously hot next to Draco´s pale white complexion.
His insistent scrubbing was cut short when Potter reached out to grab one of his wrists pulling his hand from the cauldron and tugging so they were facing each other. Draco should have yelled. He should have ripped his wrist free of Potter´s grip, sneered in his face and yelled. The words, however, died on his tongue at the disgustingly earnest expression on Potter´s face.
“Then what are you saying.” Potter demanded voice dry with annoyance and Draco chanced a glance his way. “I thought we´d been getting along before you started making fun of me.” He blurted and immediately started to scrub harder face alight with color. He was so doomed; this boy was frying his brain to mouth filter with just one look.
They were one of the first groups to finish breakfast and left the hall chatting about their ancient rune homework, Pansy begging Draco to quickly proofread her essay before class.
He made to go after the others when Harry grabbed his wrist. “Don´t worry, I´ll catch you next time, too.” He said cheekily before letting a blushing Draco go. He suddenly felt tiny as Potter stepped onto the same stair as him and loomed a few inches over him strong shoulders hiding easy strength. When nothing came out of his mouth he decided taking the cowards way out and running was the best option, so he did that. But not without pushing a laughing Blaise into Pansy.
.” Draco gasped when Harry bit into his neck harder than before his hips twitching upwards. Potter pulled away to meet his eyes and they both started laughing.
He´d just finished his potions essay and stretched his arms over his head back arching with the movement when he heard Potter´s voice.
. They stood in another silence, this one significantly less awkward both grinning a bit like loons when the door to the dungeon opened again and Slughorn waltzed back in greeting Harry with a bright smile.
“You can´t just go around telling bloody Weasley that I want to make friends with Potter.” He sighed the tight knot in his stomach slowly unfurling. “It´s not even true.” He added as an afterthought and thumbed his head against the wall when Pansy only lifted a judgmental eyebrow at him.
“Not that I wouldn´t want your company!” He grinned and Draco scoffed at him. “Whatever Potter.” He pushed off Potter´s hand missing the dejected look on the others face as he walked a step faster, utterly embarrassed. “Good job mate” he heard Weasley say and felt all the more embarrassed. It wasn´t like it was Potter´s fault. He was well in his own right to say no. Draco just shouldn´t have gotten his hopes up like that.
. Do you want?” he seethed throwing a nasty glare Harry´s way. “Uhm.” Potter stuttered still fidgeting. Draco rolled his eyes with an annoyed groan turning back the cauldron he was currently scrubbing clean off a disgustingly sticky green slime. “I just want to-“ Potter started but cut himself off grimacing at himself before trying again. “I mean I´m not sure what yesterday was about but…” Draco could feel Potters eyes on him but refused to turn back to meet his gaze. “Ron didn´t tell me anything weird about you. He told me nothing. I mean.” Potter finally finished.
“I guessed.” He said when he turned back to Draco smiling delighted when he noticed Draco´s smirk. And really, if this was what being friends with Potter was then Draco wasn´t sure he could handle it. Wanting to kiss him every two seconds was bound do drive him crazy. “I´m sure.” He replied with a smirk, voice dry. Either Potter didn´t notice that he was being made fun of or he didn´t care. “Did you sleep well? I haven´t seen you in the common room recently.” Potter seemed genuine enough but Draco felt slightly embarrassed, remembering what had kept him from sleep all those nights ago.
“Draco, common that was funny!” Blaise giggled, fucking
They sat in silence for a few long moments before Pansy shifted closer now grabbing both his hands. “I´m really sorry, Draco. I didn´t mean to genuinely upset you.” He held her gaze for a minute and then lightly squeezed her hands. He didn´t know what to say because it really didn´t feel alright but it seemed enough for her. She shuffled over to sit next to him and squirmed in place until their arms were locked together and her head was on his shoulder.
“I-“ Potter started but Draco met his eyes in a glare shutting him up. “If you´ll excuse me it seems being near you is more of a safety hazard than I originally anticipated.” Draco seethed before turning in a huff and leaving, Pansy and Blaise following behind him trying – badly – to hide their snickering.
“Are you alright?” Potter´s voice sounded scratchy and quiet and his eyes shifted with embarrassment as he tugged Draco back to his feet. Draco avoided his eyes glancing over his shoulder and meeting eyes with a smirking Weasley. “I´m fine.” He hissed icily glaring more at Weasley than at Potter but pushing off his hands regardless.
What little noise had still been left in the hall died down as all students glanced up at the headmistress. “I thought I made myself clear when I asked you all to get along this year.” She scolded eyes almost furious. “But Professor-“ Draco cut in lowering his wand only to be interrupted again. “Detention.” McGonagall raised an eyebrow daring him to say more and he swallowed thickly. As soon as she sat down the noise started up again and Draco flushed in shame when his name fell more than once in the murmured gossip.
“I- Don´t change the topic! What do you mean ´You´ll see´? There won’t be anything to see soon because he’s going to avoid me for the rest of the year.” Potter almost whined and Draco blushed when Pansy started giggling next to him clearly also listening in to their conversation.
“Let me help you with these.” He dimpled and if Draco had been a weaker man his knees would have given out right then and there. It was for obvious reasons why everyone fawned over the boy-who-lived but as he´d grown from the awkward boy into the young adult he was now there were other reasons that could not be denied.
They stood like that for a few ticks. Draco felt the urge to fidget in place when Potter continued to not say anything but reigned it in. Malfoys don´t fidget, he told himself. “Err…So I don´t have to avoid you anymore?” Potter finally spoke and Draco flushed anew at the hopeful and almost giddy note in Potters voice. “I suppose not.” Tentatively he looked back up feeling faint when he was met with a blinding smile.
“Draco?” Potter asked again and with an answering hum Draco rolled his head off Potters shoulder to lean back against the loveseat, too tired to be embarrassed at how close they were pressed together still. “We´re…we´re friends, right?” Potter asked sounding almost meek and Draco felt the urge to press even closer to the other boy. Despite that not being possible. He considered his question for a while.
Potters hands were now caging him in on either side of his head and Draco noticed with mortification that he was positioned between his legs. Green eyes twinkled down at him as he felt a blush spread from his cheeks to the tips of his ears. He knew he looked ridiculous while blushing, almost feverish with how easily it showed on his face.
“Was that-“ Potter´s voice cracked on the whisper and he cleared his throat. “Was that alright?” he whispered again. Draco stared for a second before snorting unattractively giggling to himself. “Yes, it was
“Thanks, Draco.” At the use of his given name Draco made an awkwardly strangled sound trying to cover it with a cough but failing miserably if the amused glint in the other´s eye was anything to go by. “Not good?” Potter asked words almost teasing and Draco swallowed his initial eagerness down giving a noncommittal shrug.
He gasped softly and awkwardly tried to sit up ignoring the painful tingling in his legs that had fallen asleep. Potter turned to meet his gaze and Draco took a second to look him over. He looked weary, his dark locks sticking up in all directions and framing his face in a way that shouldn´t have been handsome but was, painfully so.
It was a stupid idea and Draco honestly had no idea why he had ever considered Pansy a smart person. He scoffed again just for good measure ignoring her eyeroll as they walked down the hallways towards the library.
No, Pansy would probably resume with her idiotic plan to quite literally push them together and that would not do. Malfoy´s were supposed to be dignified. He trudged back to the table already dreading another run in with Potter so quickly after that last disaster.
The prat-who-lived had been avoiding him ever since their run in in the library and Draco had to admit that even though the teasing had been mortifying this was much worse. This was like the beginning of eighth year with eyes avoiding his and turning corners to not pass the other. Draco would never admit it out loud but he felt almost desperate for Potters attention.
“But-“ My god what was it with Potter and his inability to speak in full sentences, Draco rolled his eyes, hard. “So, you didn´t want me to stop?” Potter asked dropping his crossed arms and taking a step closer.
As if the git had heard him Potter´s head snapped up and their eyes met. For once Draco was not the one blushing even though it was hard to tell under that dark skin. The way Potter only held his eyes for a second before shrinking down into his sweat almost confirmed it though.
“I like you.” Draco flushed at the declaration as his heart started to race. He gripped the blanket tighter and swallowed the giddy feeling before answering. “I like you, too.” Potter immediately made a frustrated noise, something between a huff and groan and sunk further into the couch. Neither looking away from the fire.
“Why the hell are you talking to Weasley.” He kept his voice low but Blaise, who sat beside him, shifted his cup and plate further away from him so it couldn´t have sounded all that calm. “It- I mean it was necessary. For research.” Pansy stammered avoiding his eyes guiltily and Draco felt the ground slip from under his feet.
“It won´t happen again, promise.” Pansy snickered and Draco mustered her with a distrustful glare. For now, he decided, he couldn´t do much more about it anyways. With a final scowl he strode back to his friends, sat down and began to eat.
“Who am I to tell you no.” Potter outright snorted at him and Draco flushed glaring at the other boy.
They´d been lounging outside for a while now when Pansy complained about being thirsty and made Draco get up to fetch some water. “I´m not your dog.” He hissed at her good-naturedly but she only stuck out her tongue.
He slid down the wall of a smaller corridor and buried his face in his drawn-up knees. Not only did he embarrass himself in front of the whole school, he´d also gotten detention. Draco wasn´t a pessimist but he knew that he had no chance of getting a job offer if his grades, his attitude, his
“Why?” Potter sounded almost hurt at that and Draco wondered if this was what people that accidentally stepped on their crup´s tails felt like. “Why.” He scoffed ignoring the desire to hug Potter. “You´re making fun of me all the time and you want to know why I avoid you.” The dryness in his voice must have surprised Potter because he reeled back dropping Draco´s wrist as if burned.
The following week Draco had given up on walking anywhere with Pansy alone, it was a safety hazard. Blaise called him a drama queen but at least he wouldn´t stoop to Pansy´s level of matchmaking. Not that there was a match to make, that was ridiculous. He didn´t like Potter.
Draco felt himself flush and swallowed slightly turning away and grabbing the nearest dirty cauldron to occupy his hands.  “That´s not what I said.”, he started scrubbing at a particularly nasty spot trying his best to ignore that Potter had taken another step closer and was all but pressed to his side. Every time Draco moved his arm brushed against Potter´s chest.
“You leave me no choice, love.” She mused and Draco sneered at her. “As if-“ he cut himself off with a yelp as Pansy pushed him harshly right into Potter. The poor thing never saw it coming and both toppled to the floor in an undignified tangle of limbs.
and left me alone.” Potter looked truly crestfallen and Draco felt bad enough that he almost amended what he´d said.
Maybe offered a truce and a handshake for old times’ sake. He wasn´t sure what he had been about to say but it hardly mattered since Potter took a step back from him bobbing his head in a nod and while avoiding eye contact fled the aisle.
Were they friends? Probably not. They´d barely spoken all year the short amicable interactions in hallways and between and during classes hardly spoke of friendship. He hated to admit it but only Pansy´s terrible attempt at matchmaking had finally gotten them to talk to each other. In more or less full sentences.
“Ah.” Potter hummed leaning back into the love seat and turning to face the flames. “Guess I´m the only one still messed up then.” He said it with a smile that was clearly meant to trigger a laugh but Draco only felt his throat click on a dry swallow.
The rest of the week went by eventless, until Monday that was. Pansy and he were on their way to potions with the other eighth years - Blaise and Greg being late as usual - when they happened about the golden trio. Draco only noticed them in the subconscious way he always noticed Potter with his stupid hair and stupid green eyes before continuing to argue for the potency of Unicorn hair in felix felis.
“Potter?” Draco hedged fingers gripping the book a little tighter. “So, you were avoiding me?” he asked sounding oddly pissed off and fuck was there not one thing about this idiot that Draco found unattractive?
Draco glared about him, wanting suddenly to hex something very, very much but lacking a suitable target. Snorting disgust, he shouldered his bag and fled into the tumbling river of rushing students.
…and 'Merlin'—and 'Salazar'…and 'Harry! HARRY, d'you?
"WHAT!
“Oi, Potter!" Draco glared daggers at his irksome, entirely barmy friend. "No, I am not 'alright'! Bloody fucking Merlin, of course I'm not 'alright'! I’m not just about to up and sell Malfoy simply because my home is infected with an uncontrollable mating impulse! Are you mad? You must be absolutely frothing, even suggesting that! And you? You! What about Grimmauld Place? Cousin Sirius would be spinning in his grave, if he had a proper one! He’d never, ever want you to sell off the home he left you! You should be ashamed of yourself, Potty.”

"I've brand-new dress robes that'll fit him," Zabini had roused himself, sufficient to edge closer. "Can enchant them to be little looser, you know—up top. Show off those shoulders of yours, old man. Most impressive."
"Yes! YES!" Lucius's recalled roar had nothing on Potter's. "YES-YES-YES!"
“Ron!”
Not that it was any less true.
Ducking furtively, Draco darted through the flames, briefly flailing about and then falling to his feet gracefully enough as he stepped out upon the Ministry side, the Manor safely behind him.
She tutted, shaking a finger at him.
Draco grabbed at Harry's neglected dick again—he'd let go somehow in the midst of his own selfish pleasure—and pulled once, twice, and a third time, and Harry gurgled like he was dying and then arched his spine into Draco's final shove.
"You, Potter!" Draco made sure to point out. "
“Oh…kay, mate,” Ron started, and then caught up to Harry’s heels. “Whatever. Your bloody choice, yeah?”
"It's…" Harry blinked, feeling stupid. But what he'd seen—and there was no earthly reason for Draco to pull pranks on him. "It's the same, isn't it? Yours…and mine?"
." He hung on with both hands to the chairs arms, gripping them fast. Leaving Grimmauld was not an option; not now he was inside. Inside, he still had a chance, he knew. If he allowed Harry to usher him out, he might as well give up on Harry altogether. The little git was that bull-headed. "Not if I've got this far, at least."
“Okay, so what’s wrong with it, then? Our flat.”
, you fuckwit!
He blinked slowly as he drew away, and Harry had to pull back a wee bit to even see the trace of lingering uncertainty. No, it wasn't the usual calm air of arrogance that confronted him, the severely tailored Malfoy sense of being 'utterly correct in all things' that Harry saw in the depths of icy glass. And those refracted panes to Draco's soul weren't nearly so frosty, not as they were usually. They were melting, dark as molten pewter, and Harry's insides melted right along with them.
“Ouch!” Draco yelped, retreating in his turn as much as he possibly could from the mad person. Not as far as he'd have liked; Harry’s ankles had his one foot in a stranglehold. The bed was also only so wide and the duvet had managed to tangle. "Shite!" He tossed his unwanted handkerchief away and glared daggers instead, increasingly irate. Harry had always had nightmares before but this was beyond ridiculous. “Bloody Merlin, Potter, will you please not? That was uncalled for, striking me!”
"Oh, fuck off, Potter!" Draco barked back. "Come here, won't you? Let's get those rags you laughingly call clothing off you."
“Can we go now, please, darling?” Pansy asked, plaintively patting at Draco’s knee. “I require cocoa—and maybe a hot bath. I can’t feel my toes. They’ve fallen off, darling.”
"Mmm…"
"Hhhm-mmmm, whatever…"
He tore open his trunk, grabbing at broom and cloak haphazardly—and then halted, eying the ring glinting on his finger. He'd stuffed it on in his hurry and now it tingled oddly.
Harry nodded jerkily, swallowing visibly.

"Grrr! You git! Harry—Harry, Harry,
That was one or the other of them but neither was certain which.
After a fashion.
Harry, instead of properly standing still and receiving Draco's proposal, dropped to his knees too, all at once, like a sack of potatoes. He gaped up at Draco's sincere snarl, his eyes very wide, wider than Draco had ever seen them, and so full of love Draco choked, mid-threat.
"I am planning your death, Potter."

cared about excellent flying and the arts thereof, even if Nott and Pans didn’t.
"Huh." Draco shrugged. "I will, thanks. But, it's funny you should ask, Harry," he grinned smarmily, even as his heart leapt into a fast gallop. So loud Harry could likely hear it, actually. But…he certainly wasn't being fended off-far from it. His fingers dug strongly into Harry's available thigh…then stroked a hard path down to his boney kneecap, pressing deep, shifting tendons and stiffened muscles. A hypnotic effect, Draco hoped for—like a massage. "After Pince—and especially now. Bit late in the day for wanting advisement, really. It

“There go your arteries, Ronald—more fool you!” Hermione huffed, chewing her apple slices with deliberately loud crunches and tossing her two sickles in between swallows. “Huh! I’ll give you twenty years, Ron, and you’ll be in for it. Drop dead one day, likely, straight off your silly broom.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, softly. “Totally. Eww, thoug—poor Seamus.”
“Yes, shut it, Potter,” Draco said, clapping a hand over Harry’s mouth. “Let her speak, then. Hermione?”
"Harry? Harry, what's wrong?"
"Y-Yes?"
"Come in, come through!" he ordered, unceremoniously casting down the Spellman's he'd been clutching in his other hand and then employing both of them to beckon at Draco like some maddened symphony conductor. "What are you even waiting for?"

Theo said nothing; only narrowed his blue eyes in contemplation.
Exhausting, perhaps, but immensely satisfying. Harry smiled for no reason as he picked over a small pile of polished chrysocolla at a quite posh stall, admiring the blues and greens of them and intricate patterns within, devised by nature itself. One would do for a Rune, he decided, catching it up and eying it critically, with the same degree of learned assessment he and his fellow Mages had employed the day prior, flying over Nazca. Yes, Hygieia was horribly draining and left a chap face flat on the ground after, but it was also their calling, their avocation, and they would continue to use it and others like it, whatever the personal cost. The Lines themselves were again fully restored for the nonce, sharp and elegant and as refulgent of power as they’d ever been, thousands of years ago in the times of their making. His Flower bloomed, and would for years to come.
Harry leant forward and cast aside his book, consigning it to the long, low coffee table they’d finally both agreed was the most possibly perfect table for that purpose but a mere two weeks previous. Before that they employed Draco’s old school trunk, until Harry complained one too many times his feet always slid off and nothing stayed atop it without a sticking spell.

And then—and then he would kill his idiot insane beloved again! Using an entirely different inventive method, quite possibly involving a rack-and-thumbscrews!
“Hmm,” Harry hummed, carefully swishing his wand at the door, which began to very gently close again. Carefully he stepped back, pinching Draco's forearm sharply through the fabric of his robes sleeve.
“It-was-just-a-tiny-little-Veritus-Charm-that’s-all,” Harry mumbled hurriedly, dropping his chin down nearly to his chest and glaring hotly at his own poor quill, laying innocent and pristine on the blotter, all fletching intact as he hadn’t yet had the opportunity to use it, what with all the heavy-handed interrogation tactics Draco was dishing out. “S'nothing, really, alright? Barely even felt the sting. Got me in the back of the knee just as I was disarming him, the little tosser, and mostly by sheer dumb luck. Don’t make so much of it, will you please, Malfoy? It’s bad enough already, having a child hex me.”
