Harry nodded, his eyes big and irritated and green in front of him, the scar, a pale mark against darker skin, peeking from under his hair. He deserved the world, but honesty would be a good start.
“Seriously, you’re starting to scare me—”
that Irish wizards would let the British wizards educate their children you are a mad lad. The maddest of lads!
“Mr. Malfoy, hold it.” Butterman took charge of the room. “If we’re going to do this, we’re going to do it correctly and dottin’ every I and crossin’ every T. Someone from the Family Court should be in touch with all of you once we get the paperwork sorted.”
It didn’t mean that he didn’t think about it, in fact he thought about their short encounter often. In his weaker moments, he could feel paranoia climb up his throat, telling him against reason that it was a conspiracy. In others, he was reminded of his acute loneliness, Pansy gone off to France, Blaise more a coworker than a friend, his own mother and their stilted conversations, his circle so small compared to  the brief brush with Potter’s large and eclectic group of friends.
He skimmed the history section, still unsure at all the words flying past him—enlightenment, separation of church and state, amendments—focusing instead on the school portion. Above and below America, on the map at least, sat another set of massive nations, Canada and Mexico, respectively. Looking at the maps in the file, detailed with Hermione’s neat handwriting, he watched, page by page, as the borders between the three shifted, decade over decade until they finally stopped moving and became firm.
It seemed odd to have Snape personally addressing him without a sneer. Harry couldn't decide if it was a bad thing or not.
Harry's shoulders dropped. “If I have a godfather how come I've never met him?”
“But Sir, I thought Voldemort was gone?” Harry was afraid he already knew what the answer to his question was, and he was right.
Whatever was in the box, Draco was sure he wouldn't like it. The box felt heavy in a way that had nothing to do with weight, and it left Draco's stomach feeling unsettled if he stared at or handled it for too long.
seemed to be wrong with the book. If his father had been someone else, Draco might think Lucius was telling him that only
After moment of just standing there staring at the proof that he had completely failed Lily's son, Severus had leapt into action. He had forced a blood replenishing potion down Harry's throat and placed a stasis charm on the spleen. He hadn't been skilled enough to fix it, but at least the charm would keep it from getting any worse while they waited for Poppy.
He wasn't sure whether his mother knew the true extent of the beating, and he wasn't about to ask, but judging by the way she looked at him Draco was sure it wouldn't matter. She would back her husband on anything.
Now though, Albus knew that he had made a terrible mistake. What good were the bloodwards if his relatives tried to beat him to death?
Harry thought in saddening clarity,
Ron woke Harry up just as they were landing. Harry had barely gotten a chance to glance at their peculiar house before Mrs. Weasley marched outside and began to verbally attack her sons. He immediately felt terrible for Ron and the twins having to come get him, and though it had been some time since he'd last cried about anything, he found to his utter embarrassment that he had to work to keep his guilty tears at bay. Of course he only felt worse when Mrs. Weasley made it clear that she didn't blame him, and then insisted that Harry come inside and get something to eat.
“How is he, Severus?” He was startled out of his thoughts by Dumbledore speaking softly from behind him. Severus quickly turned to look at him.
Harry and Hermione had agreed, and Harry had tried to ignore the one possibility none of them had voiced. Maybe Malfoy really had changed over the summer. Still, Harry had decided, it wouldn't hurt to keep a close eye on him. If he actually had changed it would be evident soon enough.
Harry was a couple of inches taller than her, and she felt his nose press onto the top of her head.
He heard Uraraka beside him ask out loud what the masks were for.
Momo gripped the silk sheets beside her, as she met his speeding thrusts with those of her own.
The rest of the class inch closer to the conversation, as they were all talking about the same subject.
It was a shitty excuse, but she needed to get in the door somehow and flat out asking was below her.
“ No, Mr. Black just move the car. Besides I’m sure you’ll be far too busy with your...problem children to entertain me,” Aizawa says walking away.
“ Oh wow, I’ve never heard it before. Can I ask what you guys were talking about?,” Midoriya says.
Uraraka hits him on the shoulder saying that it still counts as a nickname, and that means they are friends now.
Hello, this chapter is for my friend who is ridiculously obsessed with this story.
“ Ya, I think you might be right Iida. When he was talking to me alone, he seemed completely normal and even laughed. I guess he just puts up the wall as a protective strategy,” Midoriya replies.
“ Oh ya, I can’t wait to see how your quirks work in action,” Midoriya says, already pulling out one of his notebooks he uses to write about people's quirks and skills.
“ Alright fine, I’ll play with your hair, BUT only until you fall asleep, ok?” Draco says, starting to twirl black locks in his hands. Harry groans in response, enjoying the pleasant feeling.
“ I don’t care, go ahead and introduce yourselves. We’re already wasting class time,” Aizawa said apathetically.
Harry quickly got on top of her and pinned her down. Momo struggled underneath him, but his height gave him the advantage.
Next to him was Harry who wore a skin-tight black leather bodysuit that left nothing to the imagination. He was barefoot and the only accessory was the ever-present black collar around his neck. What was eye-catching was his muscled chest clearly showing through the unzipped top portion of the jumpsuit. That also displayed clearly pierced nipples and the start of a tattoo that dipped down towards his belly button.
“ Ya his fighting style is up close and personal, but I’m sure you know that since you’ve got to experience it…. up close and personal,” Draco says, his mouth turning up into a smirk at the last remark. Momo blushes again at the look and the flashback of what had happened at the fight.
The rest of the class followed suit and either paired up with their friends or with someone that their quirk worked well with.
“ I don’t know he kinda has a point,” Sero replies.
His wrists and forearms were covered in gauntlets that looked pretty durable.
“ Ch- Brat,” Draco says, placing a kiss on top of his head.
Harry greeted Uraraka with that silly nickname and started to squish the plush wrist cuffs on her outfit.
“ mmmm, you smell….” Harry said, seemingly not finishing the complete thought.
Harry groaned as he came inside her, still thrusting and riding it out.
“ Oh wow, they’re super hot!” Mina said. She showed everyone her phone, where they see a picture of the two boys. It’s a little blurry like it was taken by a passing fan.
“ Did he just bark at us?” “ I couldn’t even understand most of that...was it even Japanese?”
“ Mmm Good! I like! Nice Golden Trio~” Harry says. Draco snickers at the name he gave the three students. They did seem like genuinely good kids, if not a little goody-two-shoes.
A surprising match-up was Todoroki and Momo. Their quirks and fighting style didn’t match up very well, since Todoroki was a distance fighter and Momo worked well as support.
The two foreigners sit down on the opposite side of the table as Iida and Midoriya, with Uraraka on the end closest to Harry.
Outside was a high-end sports car. A red Lamborghini to be precise.
They met back with the rest of the class who were all talking excitedly.
To his surprise Draco responded in the same language, his voice was stern.
“ Speaking of feeding did you have sex today?” Draco asks.
“ OMG, you are so lucky! I can’t get him to even look at me during class” Hagakure says dejectedly.
Midoriya’s own match was interesting. Iida managed to swipe Hagakure’s flag in a speed boost, but Midoriya lost to Shoji’s many limbs and got his own flag taken in the fight. The final flag taken was Shoji’s as Iida launched Midoriya at him with both of their combination speed boosts.
Momo started to move her hips along with his movements, hoping to guide them further in.
Draco snickers.
He teleported from his spot on the tower, to right behind Todoroki.
“Their names are Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, if you follow the international hero news, you might’ve heard their names before,” he says.
“Midoriya did you hear? We’re getting new transfers today!” Uraraka asks him.
Momo didn’t know what to expect but a wet tongue at her entrance was not it.
Tsu blushed and replied, “ Ya that’s my quirk, I can do anything that a frog can.”
If she was aroused before, then this was 10x that feeling.
“ After watching that, I don’t know if it’s what I had expected from them,” Uraraka said.
All in all, they seemed like they were getting along pretty well.
Momo quickly made some gas masks that she and Todoroki put on before going their own separate ways.
She pulled out her collapsible baton and got into a defensive position. Over the years she had become pretty skilled with the defensive weapon and felt capable to fight without overusing her quirk.
After all that, they didn’t even stay for class?
Harry on the other hand seemed to be excitedly chatting with the girls who chose to sit next to him. He was offering them candy in his weird gibberish language, not that the girls minded. They were all too occupied, drooling over him.
“ Also that other guy had a bad attitude just like Bakugo, do you think we’ll have to deal with two Bakugos now?” Mina said.
He pushed her spent body fully on the bed and stood in front of her.
“ I think it means we are all friends now, hopefully,” Midoriya says.
Aizawa looks over at them, not impressed with the story but chooses to not press the issue further.
Momo huffs indignantly at his comment.
“ It’s great to meet you guys, you might see me around here since my job is being their handler,” Sirius said, motioning to the two boys beside him.
“ Do you think he fucks the villains?” Denki asked.
The pace raised and soon it was too much for her.
“ Enough gossip. We’ve already wasted enough class time as it is. Gossip on your own time, the lecture’s about to start,” Aizawa cut in.
She shivered at the feelings of him licking and biting down on her neck, making her scream out in pain and pleasure.
“ Harry told me that you saw him fucking that girl last night,” Draco said pointedly.
“ You’re going to have dinner with the two new hottest guys at the school and you didn’t invite us?” Mina demands.
“ Draco is so sweet to Harry, it’s adorable” Hagakure comments.
The girls huffed in annoyance but obeyed their promise.
He tells them to go sit down. Midoriya goes to his regular seat in between Iida and Uraraka. Harry and Draco sit at the two new desks shoved into the far left side of the class.
“ Rise and shine boys! You have class in 10 minutes- WHOA!” Sirius yelled in surprise.
“ Ah ah Mu se ya ya ya” Harry said, starting to sing a melody at the end.
Draco stepped back and elbowed the guy next to him. “ Oi, introduce yourself”.
Draco groaned out in bliss as he rode out his climax, with short thrusts into his mouth.
He pumped his cock up and down a few times, smearing the pre-cum that was leaking from it on his hand.
“ Like arousal,” Harry replied. Momo’s face flushed red. Her thoughts scrambled.
“ I’m sure some of you have heard the gossip going around. Yes, we are getting two new students. They are in the international exchange program from a hero course in England. However, Europe is still under the rules that a highschool hero course is sufficient for a pro-hero license. So both of these students have pro-hero licenses,” Aizawa says. He is cut off by student’s outcries.
“ Hi, Harry! You did great at your match today! Momo isn’t hard to beat!” Mina tells him loudly.
She went to the door, hoping to get to her dorm and take a shower without anyone seeing her new *love bites* before she could cover them in concealer.
Completely unaware or ignoring the sensual display Harry enjoyed the treat and happily thanked a blushing Tsu.
“ Sirius said that we have to stay here for at least a couple of months, until the last scandal quiets down,” Draco said, dressing down to his boxers. He started undressing Harry like you would a small child.
“ Hey calm down, you look like you’re gonna barf. I just wanted to talk to you, ch” Draco said, eyeing the shaking teen.
Momo let out an eep of embarrassment and her hand flung up to cover her unsightly neck.
He started lapping and slurping at her flowing juices- the sounds were lewd but it felt so good.
This led many of the girls to offer the various things from their lunches, in hopes to recreate the previous scene. Uraraka shot them down, reminding them that they promised not to overwhelm him.
“ Totally, unlike the other one Draco, he’s an open book. The classic bad boy type,” Jirou says.
Her hand went to her neck where he had bitten and felt the skin already healing.
It had felt like a deeper bite, but his hormone quirk must overstimulate the senses, making things feel more than it really is.
“ What? Oh here,” Draco said, turning the boy. Draco plugged up the pink headphones to his phone and handed it to Harry, starting a song playlist.
“Deflection aside,” because that had been what he was doing, the entire time, “We’re going to have to work through all of this. Because we haven’t even gotten to the testimony of the trial and I want... I want this to be something we either do together or not at all. As much as I love Rebecca, I can’t lose you in the process.” There it was. The fear out in the open. Somehow, Harry was still the only one who understood it, even after all the deception and the lying by omission. He didn’t know how he could be so lucky to be so in love and so
“It’s very similar, I had no idea...”
“Sort of, but she went right back to sleep.”
“It is pretty brilliant, visiting new places after hearing about them for so long,” Harry agreed, leading them down the street to where the point had been set up. “You’re going to like the area as well, it’s near the family courts in Temple, quite lovely buildings and gardens.”
“Draco,” Harry looked to him, “Any questions for John and Liza?”
They called themselves Mage-USA and they seemed to be as big as she had told them. For a country with a population of almost 300 million, having 16 million wizards seemed almost small now for a scope of that size.
education.”
“What my associate is trying to say is that he’s the head of the department of Magical Child Services in London. He’s not absconding with the child, simply trying to remove her from the disaster area.” These where bits and pieces of phrases he’d heard Harry use before on aurors. They usually worked well. Dropping his voice lower and leaning towards the auror, who was so young it made him nauseous, “I highly doubt that any of us want this young one to see her family in

a mom, because she missed her own but she still wanted to do cool things. Molly would love to spoil her. That she was endlessly empathetic, always helping out the nuns at the ministry, and smart, loving maths and sums just as he did at her age. She liked to help count stock with the mediwitches, helping them out when she could be underfoot, something Hermione would latch onto and have her sorting paperwork when they have to clear the table at her and Ron’s place to have dinner. That she loved beer bread with butter right from the oven, but that her Da hadn’t made it very often. He wanted her to have it all and he wanted to learn all she would give him.

Sometimes he missed how easy it was to hide away in the manor. The 90 or so square meters here didn’t leave much in the way of hiding.
“The home study is scheduled for next week?” He nodded. He was nervous about that, having a stranger in their home to judge them. It being someone from the Irish Ministry and under Loreen's thumb didn’t help his nerves. He felt the book he had in his expanded coat pocket for comfort.
support staff, not to mention they’re closely tied into their department of welfare, economics and national defense. They’re a massive program of regulation, seniority and funding. Actually, it’s where I got some of the ideas for your department Harry.”
“Naturally—“
A fever dream, a diversion from their usual. And it had turned into something more.
“I can’t imagine working with kids all day though, you really do the hard work here, Harry.”
He couldn’t help but ask himself miserably. Was all of this worth it, in the end? When they started, the point of this was to be friends first, then so easy, now so hard. Fighting each other when the enemies outside were too great, where you knew the other’s soft and sensitive areas, was so easy. Easy enough that it was nearly gut instinct. To hold love in your hands and choose to squeeze.  When all bets were off, there was nothing sacred between them. Each side damaged in a bloodless war. Over and over the same actions and fights all boiling into one unending conflict.
However, Azkaban had been razed to the ground in the war and public opinion had swayed sharply on its effectiveness on stopping dark wizards and more on
“I want you to be happy,” her voice was a slight level above a whisper and despite her control, the tremor in her voice is there.
“As if I have any authority in Patel’s Emporium.”
He looked taken aback after that but then properly sheepish.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Of course.” He could feel the corners of his mouth tugging up nonetheless.
He sits up carefully and cracks his neck. The blond next to him winces, like always, but doesn’t move.
Draco opened his mouth to speak but Ronald beat him to it.
“And Jews are?”
Regardless, Draco was now roaming around Housewares a few months later, looking at the neat rows of plates, serving dishes, platters, decorative plates and other ceramics that made up the special aisle dedicated solely to ceramics. There was porcelain too, which was ironic considering the title of the aisle but the designs were quite good. He traced the edge of a teacup from Germany, where a little bee hovered around the center of the lilacs painted there. He hadn’t been sleeping well for a few weeks now, nightmares of shapeless things and roiling anxiety plagued his bedroom so he’d taken to walking the shop floor every now and then. In the background of the store, and apparently the closer you got to checkout, the easier it was to hear the muzak being piped in from the wireless. He didn’t recognize the music but it was a nice tune.
but he couldn’t stop the rage bubbling up, the pain and anger seeping out from where it normally sat.
“You can’t base your decisions now on things that may not happen. All you’d be doing is making sure the worst will always happen.”
We’re also going to need an expert— As much as I’ve studied case law it’s been fairly limited over its history for Irish case law so I’ve been in contact with the educational secretary’s team in the United States— She directly worked with the former president and the head of UMNAS—and helped further the standards for what would later be defined as the Magical Child Protection Act of 1987 which—”
“I don’t want to go with her, Draco don’t let her take me...” Rebecca whispered into his arm.
“Hang on—“
“That was nice of her,” the witch said absently, “What about this on your arm, does it hurt?”
Ronald just raised his hands as if to say
The times she cried
“Seems a funny reason to kill people,” Ron replied, tactlessly. His own stomach turned, the wine souring within.
“I think I’m the best judge for that,” Harry said with a grin, his white teeth bared, his eyes green as acid and his scar pale against his sepia skin as he brushed the hair out of the way, as she gave a little gasp, “Harry Potter, Head of Magical Child Services.”
“For the most part, yes,” Harry answered, used to the oddity that was the wizarding world. “There are some desperate areas but muggles can’t get into them.”
They lapsed into more small talk while Draco finished off his glass of wine, grimacing as he tasted a bit of sediment that had made it into the bottle. It didn’t help the headache. Then there was the counting out of muggle money to the tune of— “Oh you don’t use the standard currency?” “That must be difficult” — that Harry handled before everyone was standing up and filing out of the restaurant.
“I was too—I couldn’t either,” Draco admits, his equally trembling hands scrambling for purchase on Harry’s jumper as he kisses the corner of his mouth, adrenaline making him a jittering mess, jumping from one high to another, “Gods, Harry, you keep me sane. I need you as much as you need me, I shouldn’t have—”
It had become a habit during his year in captivity. When his monetary supplies were low, he’d have to avoid the Waitrose, with its bright and clean atmosphere and head to the slightly dingy but exceedingly popular for muggles Tesco located just off center facing the worser off part of town.
“A sabbatical?”
Matilda just laughed in response, like Harry hadn’t just created a price out of thin air, doing some sort of magic with his usual devil-may-care attitude towards the secrecy statute. Draco could only shrewdly stare at him and hope that the Ministry would take mercy on his idiotic boyfriend.
“Okay,” Harry said, shedding his robes and draping them over the small island that separated the kitchen from the living space, he was wearing another one of his sweatshirts, this one said FRIENDS in capital letters, “You remember what I said in April right?”
“If you want,” He’d pushed the sleeves back on his jumper after a while, his right hand paused and still holding the biro, “I’ve pieced together most of it from Lacey’s account, but I’m more than happy to add what you want. The whole thing about Ron wanting me to get your statement was a bit of a lie.” His hands were thin but strong, with spindly wrists turning into forearms and then into the soft navy fabric. His eyes traced the path before settling back on Harry's bright green ones.
“Sure,” Harry said, “Where’s the entrance at?”
was a sure constant. If Draco was being honest, he too hardly looked like he did in school and this probably worked to his advantage, despite the emptiness of the hour before closing in Patel’s Emporium of Fine Goods Near and Far. But he looked good, not perfect or golden, but good. He felt frozen.
It was better than being drunk.
reminiscent of 2015’s
At times like these, he’d wished he’d taken even a year of Muggle Studies, just so he wasn’t lost when they referred to their pieces of plastic as
He didn't have much time to dwell on that though, as Mr. Weasley stepped forward and said, “Alright Severus. You take Harry on to Hogwarts through the floo. Molly and I will gather the children and come check on him in a bit.”
Almost three weeks after the beating, Lucius was still mad and had only spoken to him once since. When he had, it had been short and cold, and he had suspiciously given Draco a package and told him not to open it until he was back at Hogwarts. Apparently whatever the box contained had “belonged to a Great Pure-blood Wizard” and would serve as a reminder of “who Malfoys are supposed to be” while he was away at school.
Lupin's smile widened as he grasped Harry's hand, and he suddenly looked much younger. “Please Harry, call me Remus. Molly has made us some tea if you would join me inside. I believe we have a few things we need to discuss.” The man was thankfully able to keep the final sentence from sounding too ominous. Although, Harry was still a bit uneasy as he and the others followed Remus back to the house.
There was a softness around his mouth that he had definitely inherited from his mother. A subtle angle to his cheek bones and a fullness to his chin. His handwriting was almost the same exact messy scrawl Lily had had when she had first learned to write with a quill. He had many of her quirks, such as biting his lip when concentrating, or tapping his foot to stay awake when he was tired. The few times he was partnered with the Longbottom boy for Potions it was evident that he had inherited his mother's kindness as well as her sense of justice and loyalty. By far the worst though, were his eyes. Her eyes.
Eventually, when it became obvious Harry wasn’t going to say anything, Remus began to elaborate. “I know that you’ve not been in the wizarding world for long Harry, but I’m sure that you must have heard at least some of the prejudice against werewolves, and I would understand completely if you would rather not be around me.” The man said all of this while staring intently at his shoes.
Draco found though, that movies had to be experienced first-hand in order to truly appreciate them, as when he tried to explain the premise to Tom, the diary hadn’t been able to enjoy it the way Draco had.
Dumbledore is the most difficult character ever for me to write. That being said, I still have no excuse for taking so long to post this chapter. I blame my finicky nitpicking tendencies... Anyway, here you go.
Harry was alone the next time he woke up. He felt disoriented and his head was slightly sore, as if he had slept too deeply and for a long time. It took him a moment to find his glasses, but once he did, he recognised that he was in the Hogwarts hospital wing.
He had been terrified of a diary for half a month. It was a good thing no one had known about this or he never would have lived it down. “How in the world could a blank diary teach me what it means to be a Malfoy?” Draco muttered to himself in confusion.
Also, this time he would make sure someone was actually watching. Not just some old squib a street over either. This time he would station a trusted teacher right next door. The one teacher who could best empathise with young Mr. Potter. He would send Severus. Maybe this would finally show Severus that Harry wasn't his father.
Eventually Mrs. Weasley returned to the sitting room. “We were able to reach Professor Dumbledore dear, and he's working on getting in touch with Madame Pomfrey. How are you feeling?” She said brushing his hair back from his face. Harry was surprised at just how much the motherly gesture affected him, as he had to swallow a lump that formed in his throat.
Immediately he was horrified by what he'd done, and considered putting the lid back on and running away, but then he realized what he was looking at.
“So, Potter. Come here often?” Now that he knew that blood status was a sham and was no longer trying to earn his father's approval, there didn't seem to be much of a reason to continue being such an awful prat all the time. That didn't mean he had to lose all of his snark though.
His worries disappeared though when he woke hours later to a freckle faced boy tapping incessantly on his window.
feed you? They have stunted your growth by at least 8 centimetres.”
“Harry, I...” Remus trailed off and shook his head. “I've waited years to be able to speak to you, and now I've no idea what to say.” He smiled ruefully.
After four years, I'm finally back with a subpar chapter I didn't even like. I'm so sorry.
“Not just yet Harry. You have been sleeping and healing now for just under a week. Though you doubtlessly feel much better, I think you will find you are not entirely well yet.” Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have lost some of their ever present twinkle, and it looked as if it pained him to even lay eyes on Harry. His guilt and sadness were obvious on his face.
Remus blinked at Harry’s question in surprise. He had obviously assumed that Harry was going to ask him to leave. “Yes. Though sometimes I can be a bit crabby on the days before, and a bit tired on the days after. Especially if I don’t have any Wolfsbane Potion that month. Wolfsbane Potion,” Remus explained having noticed Harry’s confusion, “Is a potion which allows me to retain my human thoughts and feelings while I’m in my werewolf form. It can be quite difficult to come by sometimes, as it is an extremely hard potion to make. Thankfully though, Professor Snape has agreed to make it for me during my stay at Hogwarts.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“In light of recent events though, I’ve added something to them. They are now portkeys. Your father’s band will take you to Dumbledore’s office, the necklace will take you to myself, and in case the moon is full or I am indisposed for some other reason, your mother’s band will take you to Professor Snape. To activate them you just tap one with your wand and say the password. Your father’s ring is Prongs, the necklace is Moony, and your mother’s ring is Lily.” Remus said, gesturing to the rings to make sure Harry knew which was which. He continued, “It is imperative that you keep these with you at all times Harry, and only use these when you absolutely need them. Also, don’t tell too many people about them or Professor Dumbledore and I could get into trouble. We weren’t exactly authorized to make these, but we both agreed that we didn’t ever want you to be stuck in a dangerous situation like earlier this summer again.”
Draco Malfoy was confused.
It was alarming to say the least. Harry gasped and flinched back.
“Stay still Mr. Potter. You have at least two broken ribs and one of them has managed to puncture your spleen.” Professor Snape said pressing in a surprisingly gentle manner on Harry's shoulder to stop him from sitting up. He was running diagnostic spells all over Harry's torso.
Albus looked down in apparent shame. “The first is my fault. I neglected to keep anyone close enough to see past their lies. I should have sent someone more trusted. I should have checked on him myself. The second is because, though Harry was in the hospital wing at the end of last term, Poppy did very little attending to him herself. Another patient was in much worse shape when they brought him in, and so Poppy delegated Mr. Potter's care to her apprentice. Her apprentice who apparently only checked Harry for a concussion, which he had, and then treated him only for that.”
As they flew Ron relayed the story of Harry’s disastrous previous night to his brothers. Harry stayed mostly quiet, only giving small nods of encouragement or corrections when needed. Eventually he felt himself beginning to drift back to sleep.
Harry rose too, and Remus clasped him warmly on both shoulders. “I’m so glad that I’ve finally gotten to meet you Harry. Your parents really would be proud of how you’ve grown up.” Remus looked Harry over for a minute, and Harry debated giving the man a parting hug, but before he could decide, Remus pulled back and went to bid the Weasleys goodbye. Harry smiled at how well the meeting had gone and went to find Ron so that he could tell him about it.
Mr. Weasley sent his wife a worried look and cleared his throat. “Harry, we need you to tell us what really happened.” He said in a stern voice.
Okay so, I feel the need to admit that I have had a big problem with this chapter. In order for this story to work properly Draco has to change a bit and I have had the hardest time trying to create a believable change in Draco without making him too out of character. I'm still not sure I've managed it properly, but if I continue to pick at this chapter, soon I'll have nothing left. So without further ado, here it is.
how to be a true Malfoy, but his father would never employ that kind of method.
There was an awkward silence for a moment while Harry sat shocked. He was surprised, Harry had never met a werewolf before, but he was also a bit confused. Harry wasn’t quite sure what he was supposed to say, or why Remus thought that his being a werewolf would make any difference to Harry at all.
Luckily he was saved from having to say anything as Madame Pomfrey chose that moment to arrive. Harry was told that his ribs had indeed been fixed and that his spleen was as good as new. He would likely be sore for the next few days and some of his lesser bruises had been left to heal on their own. He was given a special diet and a list of potions to help with his healing and his nourishment, but was thankfully cleared to go back to the Weasley's house.
“Voldemort is gone. For now. That does not mean, however, that he won't be back one day, and it does not mean that his followers won't still try to kill you.” Harry stared intently at his hands and nodded his understanding.
The boy had the entire world trying desperately to get even a glance at his life and no one had seen anything? In all of the people who had managed to track him down through his childhood, not one person had noticed how his relatives were treating him? In all of the people Dumbledore had stationed around his house, not one had thought anything untoward was happening?
He gingerly sat back down and looked at the sparse meal the Dursleys had given him. Though it was the only meal he'd been granted that day, Harry sighed and gave the entirety to Hedwig. His ribs hurt so badly it was making him nauseated, and the food probably wouldn't have stayed down anyway. Hedwig gave Harry an affronted look and ruffled her feathers, but eventually she ate it.
Harry couldn't lie on his back because that was Uncle Vernon's favourite belt area, and his chest and stomach were completely out of bounds because that's where Uncle Vernon did most of his kicking. He had briefly tried lying on his side, but as Harry was easing himself down, he had felt a sudden sharp pain shoot through his abdomen and so he thought that maybe he should just sit still for a while.
Harry laughed. “I think I know the feeling.”
“Oh you poor dear, “Mrs. Weasley cried. “No one should be treated that way. Especially not you! Such a sweet, kind boy!” At this point she hugged Harry even tighter and he could no longer hide his discomfort. Mrs. Weasley was busy crying into his hair, but thankfully Mr. Weasley noticed his painful grimace.
Draco knew there was no way any of his pure-blood friends could do half the things the Gryffindor Trio had done that year. He knew he probably couldn't have done them either. (He was still a bit miffed about the House Cup though, Dumbledore could have gone about that a nicer way.)
Harry sat alone on the Weasley's couch and waited for Ron's parents to return to the room. Mrs. Weasley had told him to lie down while she and her husband went to fire call Hogwarts, but his bruises were making that a harder task than it should have been.
Harry swallowed deeply and looked at his feet. He wasn't used to people caring so much about what happened to him. It was especially bizarre to have a stranger so concerned. He wasn't quite sure how to feel about it.
It was hard for Harry to feel too wronged or angry when faced with how obviously upset Dumbledore was over his mistake. He wasn't too happy about it either, but he could see that Dumbledore had at least been trying to protect him in some way, which was a lot more than what many of the other adults in his life had done for him.
Draco stepped a bit closer and his stomach gave an unsettling lurch while his pulse quickened in fear. “This is sodding ridiculous!” He exclaimed to himself as he stormed over to where The Box sat on his night stand and ripped the lid off in frustration.
Harry and the others, who had likely noticed the man while Harry was diving, landed and approached the man together. When they reached him the man said, “For a moment I forgot and thought I was watching a young James. Then I remembered even James wasn't
He hoped that hadn’t gone as badly as he thought it had. Draco had written to Riddle at great length about changing his image and Riddle had assured him it was better to change drastically all at once rather than to try and do it subtly over time and risk coming off as insincere. That way once people realized this was how you were going to be from now on, they would only have to adjust themselves to the new you once.
“So, Harry, how many sugars do you really take in your tea? I thought one was a bit mature for your age.” Remus teased gently.
Last week when he had obviously bewildered the Gryffindor trio with his suddenly nice behaviour, Draco had realised that changing his attitude wasn’t enough. He had a lot of apologies to make if he ever hoped to truly change who he was, and that was probably going to be the easiest and hardest part.
While Harry was talking to Ron, the twins removed the bars from his window, climbed in and broke out his door to retrieve his school things that the muggles had locked in the cupboard under the stairs. They were almost away when Hedwig caused a ruckus because Harry had almost forgotten her. The noise woke Uncle Vernon who, when Harry had went back for Hedwig, had almost ripped off Harry's ankle trying to stop him from escaping. The Weasleys managed to pull Harry out of Vernon's grasp, though quite painfully as the easiest place for them to grab him was around his torso which was covered in bruises.Though, Harry was luckily able to pass off his grimace of pain as if it were caused by his ankle getting twisted.
Severus sighed as he studied the Potter boy on the bed in front of him.
It had been a fortnight since Draco's father had given him the mysterious box with the mysterious item in it that would supposedly teach Draco how to be a better Malfoy, and though it made his stomach queasy to think about or look at The Box, Draco felt he was going to go sparse imagining what was in it. He had even taken to capitalising the stupid thing in his head. It was getting rather ridiculous.
“ Hi Harry, I was wondering if you wanted to talk about the training yesterday? Since-since we sparred I thought we could compare notes?” Momo stumbled over her words.
Draco rummaged through the many pockets of his cargo shorts and pulled out a handful of small objects.
Before Midoriya could stop himself he blurted out a question, “ Is he always like that?”
Mina waved her over.
“ We do not usually spar at practice to avoid injuries and instead do physical activities like obstacle courses and practice missions,” Iida explains, warily at the scary intensity, Draco had when he mentioned fighting.
“ If you meant they run from the smell then ya. That mutt form of his could make a small country flee from smell alone, not to mention the fleas,” Draco says, making the group laugh.
Uraraka was the first to speak.
Uraraka gets a text from Midoriya to meet him in the room 5 minutes beforehand.
Harry handed her her bo staff from the ground.
“ Well we shouldn’t just assume things like that, Ribbit,” Tsu replies.
“ Good, now go to sleep will ya? You know I need my beauty rest,” Draco says.
“ Oh shit that guy really is rich, that car costs over 51 million yen(500,000 USD),” Sero says.
“ Welcome~ Pretty hair, like,” Harry responded.
“ Ahh!” She moaned, her hips jerking up involuntarily to get more friction.
They were stopped by Mina and the girls of class 1A.
“ Stop fucking around, and let me fuck that sinful mouth of yours,” Draco scolded.
“ Ah fuck, you just couldn’t wait to christen the new dorm room huh? You horny fucker,” Draco scolded. Harry just continued his administrations, as usual, maybe even a little harder in response to Draco’s dirty talk.
Momo groaned loudly and pressed against the door- as it was the only thing holding her up- when Harry started to suck at a sensitive spot on her collarbone.
“ How do you think that?” Sero asks.
Soon enough Draco arrived leading Harry into the room with him.
Lightly playing with the engorged organ and passing his tongue ring over it.
Todorki felt something hard hit the back of his head and turned to see where it came from.
This earned a shriek from the more excitable girls.
When Draco saw Harry he immediately went over to him and checked over him for injuries. Midoriya and Uraraka thought he kind of looked like a concerned mother duck, looking over her young.
“ Oh right, part of Sirius’ quirk is to turn into a giant black dog. I’ve read that it’s so scary that it makes criminals run at the sight,” Midoriya says, in response to Harry’s dog sounds.
The other man shrugged an apology, “ Sorry we got sidetracked on the way here,”.
“ Oh really? Is that what everyone is worked up about?” Midoriya asks.
The girls immediately start gossiping.
The sheer weirdness of it all made the class erupt into gossip.
Harry answered by pushing back into the kiss. As the kiss got more heated, he back her up against the door, closing the space between their bodies.
Instead of just taking the flag from her belt loop as she expected, Harry also reached and undid her mask.
Momo started to dress too and felt a little calmer when his quirk was deactivated but still held onto the lingering feelings.
With that, the two exchange students thank them for the dinner and leave the room. Harry gives Uraraka a parting hug, and calls her by a shortened nickname, “Raka”.
Midoriya enters the busy classroom and is greeted by his friends.
“ Where are you running off to? The whole class usually eats dinner in the common room,” Mina asks.
“ It’s like having an itch you can never fully scratch. Ever. There’s also his quirk. If he doesn’t have sex at least once a day, his quirk weakens considerably. His quirk manifested late when he was 13. A week after the...incident. I’ve been with him since we were kids and take care of him. We’ll probably be together like this until one of us dies, which considering we’re both pro-heroes will be sooner than later,” Draco says.
“Good luck with that! I took that class last term and it was brutal,” Hagakure says.
Harry’s street clothes consisted of a tight white t-shirt and black sweatpants. Now that they knew they were there, the girls could spot the nipple piercings poking out from under the tight shirt.
Harry smiled down at her and she felt her heart skip a beat.
“ Well, it was obvious they had a plan from the beginning. Draco would egg Todoroki on from a distance, making him use up energy until he let his guard down.
He pulled her swollen clit in his mouth and sucked around his slowly.
“ I agree, although Draco can be very...intense,” Iida said.
“ Ya ok, thanks for the enthusiastic welcome, champ,” The man said sarcastically.
Draco surprisingly laughed. It was higher pitched than his regular voice, but still smooth and melodic.
“ Yo dude I don’t know if my brain could take it if those two got together... They’re like the inverse versions of each other,” Kirishima replies.
“ So uh I thought you might want to know us a little better since we already know some stuff about you guys,” Midoriya says.
“ Do you think they’re in a relationship?” Jirou asks.
The group studied the new students' hero costumes. They were no doubt being studied by everyone else on the field too, I mean who couldn’t. They were quite striking.
The trio wishes them goodbye and some of the girls ask if Harry needs a napping buddy.
Sure Sure, he was a college student and knew about sex and had walked in on a couple of his classmates going at it.
“ Like what?” Midoriya asked, intrigued that Draco was sharing this information with him.
Before she could embarrass herself anymore, Aizawa cleared his throat to get the class’s attention.
She left out the part that it would be five hormonal crazed girls who after seeing them in action, craved them more.
“ Well, it makes sense. If I were a villain doing something evil, it’d be pretty hard to stop if that guy was sucking my dick,” Denki continued.
The trio is momentarily stunned by the intensity of his question.
“ What kind of girl would I be if I didn’t gossip about hot guys?” Mina asks sarcastically.
Everyone agreed. While they were in Highschool, pressure was put on the hero commission that sending hero students into the profession straight out of high school was too young. That they can’t have all of these teenagers fighting villains and causing major problems.
“ I need someone else that I know I can trust to take care of Harry while we’re at this school. Harry seemed to think you were the best choice. He also said you were quite the perv, staring at him while he fucked that girl,” Draco added with a sly smile.
He pressed his nose against her aching clit and started rubbing it side to side, while still tonguing her.
Harry enters the dorm abruptly.
“ Ew stop I don’t want to think about that,” Kirishima chided.
At the whistle, Harry got off of Momo and put his quirk blocking collar back on.
We’ve all been fighting against each other so long we know a lot of our weak points, fighting styles, and techniques,” Midoriya says. Draco thanks him for the offer, and that it would be helpful to strategize.
All of them knew it was a very real possibility that they would have to go up against either of them in the near future, and that made them want to train harder.
Draco nods at their explanations.
“ What did you think about the dinner?” he asks.
Midoriya sighed in relief. He didn’t know if he could’ve fought the guy anyway.
Then proceeded to take the entire length of his cock into his mouth. Draco choked out a moan once he felt the head of his dick collide with the back of Harry’s throat.
She turned back to Harry who was smiling at her. She noted that this whole time he had never removed his sunglasses, how strange.
Draco grabbed Harry’s pink headphones and his phone, before leaving the dorm. He didn’t bother with bringing stuff like pencils or paper. It’s not like they were going to take notes anyway.
“ Alright we’ll see you guys later~ we got a hot date with the dean of students,” Sirius said, putting his arm around Harry and leading him out the door. Draco rolled his eyes at the man’s antics and followed them out.
The trio looked at him expectantly, to explain more.
Momo moaned loudly when he latched onto one hardened nipple with his mouth and began to suck and lick. She moved her hands to grab the wild black hair on the back of his head, encouraging him to continue his actions.
“ Oh ya! You’re the number three top hero over there!” Midoriya replied. He was starting to nerd out at meeting a foreign top hero.
Uraraka caves. “ Fine but you guys have to promise not to overwhelm them ok?”
Momo silently hoped that she hadn’t gotten herself in over her head.
“ No problem, go ahead and get some food there’s enough for everyone,” Uraraka says happily.
“ Anyways, back to what we were talking about,” Mina says.
“ Well we’ll give you something to write about, not many people have watched us work together since most of our hero work is underground stuff,” Draco says.
At first, Momo was confused that he had pulled her back down, but it seemed like he wanted to brush her hair.
“ Aw gross dude,” Kirishima said.
“ Remember what Mr. Sirius said about Harry’s quirk? Once he takes that collar off, he creates hormones that go through the air and affect his opponent. That’s what the masks are for, to block the quirk’s effects,” Midoriya explains.
Midoriya walked over to Harry and Draco to see if they wanted any help.
“ He fights villains by turning them on?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Momo felt the cooling liquid of both of their cum, start to cascade down her inner thighs.
Little did he know the object was coming at him from a diagonal way, but the person throwing them was above him.
Short, deep moans of his started to fill the air as he got closer to climax.
So you made it through this pure crack fic's steamy chapter. Well, get ready- because there are going to be more in the next chapters. Gay and straight sex- vanilla and slight-BDSM. Oh, ya buckle the fuck up. Harry is literally going to fuck half of class 1A. ( I did the math).
Overall the costume was pretty basic compared to the outlandish ones some of the other students had. It was more of the tall, sexy muscled man that was underneath the costume that made people stare.
“ That went...better than I expected,” Midoriya says.
Uraraka took her seat next to Harry, much to the dismay of the other girls. She didn’t want to overwhelm him with a new person, plus it looked like he was having trouble eating again.
They stared at each other at a standstill. Momo assumed it was because Harry usually depended on his quirk to do the work instead of fighting, after all, he didn’t seem to be carrying any weapons.
Right then the door to the class opened and three figures walked in.
“ I don’t know, I can ask…. Draco gave me his number. I can text him,” Midoriya said nervously. Uraraka blushes.
Midoriya watched as Draco and Harry split ways. He lost Harry in the debris and saw Draco stealthily make his way to some high ground.
Midoriya thought that it was valid for them to be in dark colors for stealth work.
“ Wow, these guys are super disrespectful,” Sero says.
Currently, he was in the running of ‘Worst Attitude’ alongside Bakugo.
But this was different. What he saw was raunchy and lewd and all over pornographic. He hated to admit it but it turned him on a little. He was a virgin, only ever kissing Uraraka a couple of times when they went out senior year of high school, but they broke it off because it felt awkward.
Their bodies pressed closer together and Momo could feel the hard metal of his nipple piercings against her chest. In a swift movement, Harry pressed a leg in between hers, separating them apart. His thigh pressing up into her crotch, making her start to weaken in the knees.
Momo’s pupils went back to normal and she felt the fog clear away.
“ Haha! This is Harry. He’s got some screws loose up in the old noggin but he means well. His quirk controls pheromones in the air, once he takes off that collar the air will be filled with sex hormones that’ll even make the evilest of Villains stop in their tracks,” Sirius said happily.
Harry started going down her body, leaving a trail of kisses in his wake, and stopping to pinch her already abused nipple, gaining a gasp from Momo.
Harry and Draco walked over to Midoriya who was in a small group with Iida, Uraraka, and Tsu.
“ Uh thanks, it looks good, thank you for inviting us…” Draco awkwardly says trying to be nice. It was a little stiff- but you could tell he was trying.
“ That girl seems to like you too-” Draco said teasingly. Harry shoved him playfully.
Draco’s dorm room
It only stops when he gets satisfied, but that only lasts for a while after,” Draco says.
It was intoxicating, and she wanted more.
“ Oh sorry, it’s Scottish Gaelic. Our boarding school was in Scotland and we learned it from the teachers there. Now we only use it when we’re alone,” Draco explains.
The atmosphere in the room had changed and wasn’t so awkward anymore.
Behind him, Harry continues to listen to music, and suck lewdly on his pointer and middle fingers. Harry spots him looking over and pulls his fingers out of his mouth leaving a long strand of saliva connecting them and smiles at him.
It looked like Draco was eating a rather expensive looking foreign meal, while Harry seemed to be eating from a pile of assorted candy.
Yes, the teachers were moved up to the college courses with them. The board thought it would disrupt learning too much if they had to change teachers drastically.
Harry nodded and opened the door to let her in, before closing it behind her.
Draco responds to him and starts to gather their things.
“ Your choice,” he said nonchalantly.
The rest of class Midoriya pondered if he should tell someone about the new information Draco told him about Harry.
Harry responds by jamming his tongue into her opening alongside the two fingers.
The two of them didn’t even look like they were heroes about to fight, more like show models.
“ Hey, girl where were you?” Mina asks.
----------
“ Was Mr.Black flirting with Mr.Aizawa?” Uraraka asks.
“ Don’t mind Midoriya, he keeps track of all of the class's quirks, uses, and strategies. He’s kind of a big nerd,” Uraraka says playfully, earning a laugh from both Draco and Harry.
“ Yes. Judging from your bite mark, I see that Harry got to you,” Todoroki said pointedly.
She started to feel heat wash over her again, only this time it wasn’t caused by a quirk.
Uraraka blushes at the compliment. She then starts pointing out the food and explaining how to eat it to Harry. She picks up a dumpling with chopsticks and holds it out to Harry who eats.
Harry pouted and said something they couldn’t understand. Midoriya was starting to get used to Harry’s gibberish language but this was definitely not in English or Japanese.
“ Wait a minute. So their plan all along was to go after Momo and get her to moan loud enough to cause a distraction that would make Todoroki put his guard down?” Bakugo asks bluntly.
After Sirius finished talking, the class actually looked at the two new students. The pictures were right, they did look like K-pop idols specifically the bad boy types with messy hair and piercings.
Before Midoriya could say anything Draco butted in.
Present-day, Tokyo city the students of Hero University bustle around campus. A certain freshman class gossips around their homeroom class.
So pair up, there are 22 of you, there will be 11 teams of 2,” Aizawa explains.
and he says, “I can’t promise I’m worth your time because I’m still proving it to myself. You talk to furniture and pretended to argue with me and I don’t do the same but I’m still... I’m still trying to figure out who I am and what I’m doing.”
Draco shrugged, things could be worse.
Draco nodded slowly, eyebrows back to their normal level of shock. Not speaking as much seemed to be working so far, even though he desperately wished to comment on Harry’s lacksidasical hair (as was standard) and the rips in Weasley’s jeans (which was standard five bloody years ago.) He must have entered some alternate, highly advanced pocket dimension nine months ago where Harry Potter was nice, where Ronald Weasley didn’t instantly punch him in the nose upon viewing and where they just sort of went to pubs as if that were a thing that people did.
“—How drunk are you, you sound like a lunatic—”
the divine right of God? Unheard of for the time. The sheer amount of space and population? Like Jesus I get that Jo said there was 1 wizard for every 10 muggles and then retroactively said there were 3K
“Is that a Zabini family secret?” Draco choked out. He felt at least one or two tears escape and the room felt far too warm for February.
This would need to end before it hurt too much and finally killed him.
“Exactly,” he nodded, “So we handle anything a state can’t through their police force or if the crimes cross into other states or into breaking federal laws. Like if you were dealing in cursed objects and selling them without a license, that would be a state police matter. We would get involved if you started a crime syndicate selling those cursed items globally.” Perhaps Draco had broken more than just moral laws in the past—he wasn’t unaware of any issues selling items across Britain.
“What’s that supposed to imply?” Now Harry was sitting up, staring at him. Glaring even, in the dim light. It made him nostalgic in a twisted way.
“She can provide adequate schooling just as we can—”
Songs for this Story:
After the war, there were an abundance of residences that, by force, coercion or by submission, were converted from homes into death eater strongholds. Cursed properties laced with dozens of unique and violent things that were Draco’s job to remove.
where a small post-Hogwarts gathering was being held and at least 15 sets of eyes turned towards him.
The Telly had been turned off and it was raining, making their moods sour. A hot summer storm filled with lightning that made both of them jump and the flat rattle. Another day of delay—Loreen had filed another motion on the location. Another day of waiting. Another day off work and stuck, listless in their home as Cynthia and Thomas decided to continue ironing out the plan. They hadn’t dropped the case yet, even though the interview transcripts had been delivered and digested. Draco would have only be upset at them for abandoning Harry.
“I can’t wait,” he replied sarcastically, dreading every step closer to the interview rooms. He could easily remember the hours he spent in there, years ago, waiting for the aurors to collect his statements prior to trial. He remembered how Mother couldn’t stop silently crying, the venom in Father’s eyes as he watched his son tell the whole story, start to finish, of his involvement. Draco knew his rights, he knew that by giving a statement, dressed primly in black with his favorite cloak with bags under his eyes so deep that no glamour could fully cover them, that it could implicate himself or others. He remembered being very cold, even though there was no legal way a dementor could be in the room and it was only his own conscience parasitically eating at him. And he knew that when the whole story was out, he’d be punished and, even more so, it would damn Father to prison, perhaps for life. But he knew he had to do it. He was tired of running. And he’d rather he and Mother have a chance someday to return to normal.
“I swear to god. Truce or not. I’m killing him,” Draco mutters.
And now they were dating and life couldn’t be better.
What I assume happened is similar to what happened post-World War II for many adjacent countries— radicals / sympathizers moved from their land to a new one (in this case, Death Eaters) and merged their cause with the cause du-jour or des-pays as it were. While in Germany, neo-nazism is stopped severely, everywhere else, it’s more tolerated, so the same I believe would happen here; while in the UK, Death Eaters are strongly persecuted, elsewhere the movement was “softened.” Very much how nazis found their cause taken up by former confederate / white supremacists in the US to merge into a new movement, so did former death eaters and death eater sympathizers do to the members of the IRA who had magic, hence the bright blue on the masks and green on the robes. And since the muggle UK ‘owns’ Northern Ireland, it was easy to jump ship to the Emerald Isle through muggle / wizard means and join up with the IRA right before the end of the war / right after the end of the war.
“He’s being modest, Tommy actually works specifically in the Kidnapping, Ransom and Smuggling group, or KRS, as they’re known,” though she pronounced it more as Curse, with a hard c sound, rather than the initialism as FMI had had.
Soon the desks were covered in the case files as well, two cork boards being conjured up and items being tacked to them. Draco barely even noticed Harry sitting next to him. It was easier to focus on that than his feelings on the matter, they would soon fade to the background anyway.
“Seem familiar?”
“I found her tucked behind one of those heavy tables, I think she passed out and—“ Harry swallowed hard, staring down at her, where her little hand clutched his shirt as if in sleep he could protect her, her golden red hair tumbling over in messy curls and her soft face unblemished though her hands and knees were scraped and bleeding, “—I don’t think her family made it.” He sounded so...
Draco scoffed, crossing his arms, “I hardly think that picking some rugs and plates counts as a favor.”
And then she had been hugging him, tight and close and warm and it smelt so strongly of that bergamot and the manor that he’d nearly burst into tears then as he stood there in shock.
“No one who looked like you did, is actually interested in ending a relationship, which means you’re being an idiot.”
Which is how he found himself and Harry walking, as they often did in London, side by side to find a nice spot for lunch in Belfast. It was lovely out— sunny and shining and Harry had on ridiculous sunglasses—muggles could make them with the glasses bits in them now—that only made Draco laugh any time he turned to him with that giddy grin. The street was packed with shoppers: families leaving church for lunch, families doing shopping, tourists looking lost, students enjoying the sunshine with and without their books in tow and the two of them, in the thick of it all.
Draco had never felt strongly about children. Of course he loved Teddy, he was his relation. And he didn’t mind them, abstractly. And he
it happen, it’s depressing and this is a place of business.” Draco gave him a withering look. ”Explain, now.”
“Is it true that Enchanted London is separate from Unenchanted London?” She asked as they waited for the light to change.
And yet.
, I will follow you back to your place for what better be a good explanation.” When had they gotten so close? Draco crossed his arms to give them some familiar distance.
even?”
Harry didn’t look away but his shoulders sagged, his whole body cut from the puppeteer strings holding him up. He looked older than his age. Draco could only imagine he looked as bad, pale and filled with discomfort. He felt like throwing up, knowing that he’d done that, like a hangover, sour and sober. That he’d said those things.
“Do you want to give up?” It was a loaded question. Why had he asked it.
“That’s right, my Mum and Dad died, a long long time ago, during a war... are you able to see all that?”
“I never... I never told Ginny that— how could I? She grew up with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley for parents, God she was
Together, they sort of fit rather well when Harry stood in the middle of them, their range, for a small department impressive. Whichever order you put them in, you could find an ascending or descending pattern, a soothing practice he had picked up from his time spent strolling through bookshelves in the library.
next time is what I’m saying.”
“You’re far too
“Well,” She said with a half of smile that made Draco’s stomach drop, “It’s not great.”
“Right, well, let’s go have a pint—”
“In school— not Hogwarts, regular Muggle school, and then I ended up having to run to the corner store to get whatever Aunt Petunia had forgotten she’d needed for dinner. I had to know what change was needed or it was no dinner and a night in the cupboard, more if they thought I’d bought something for myself. Sometimes she would misjudge what money was needed and I’d have to make do.” Draco felt the familiar hot flare of anger and resentment that boiled up from some protective place and tamped it back down, not willing to ruin their night with another discussion about just how wrong it was to lock a child anywhere dark and damp and isolated. Instead, he just said:
“Oh, like Da’s family. He said they never liked Mum or that she couldn’t do magic.”
A few pieces of hair are out of place—
“I think we’re good,” John confirmed. “Thank you for coming in.” As if he had a choice.
“So there
“Head Cursebreaker Malfoy, escort the child to the ministry so we can process her with the rest of the victims.” Assured that the child would stay safe with him, Harry’s hackles went down, though he kept his guard up.
“Well yeah,” he says in that delightfully in exact fashion he’s so fond of, “Harry wouldn’t be interested in someone who didn’t care and he definitely wouldn’t hang out with someone who was an utter arsehole, through and through. What I reckon,” which always meant ‘Hermione made an observation since I’m too dense to notice it myself and I’m now using it as my own,’ “Is you spend a lot of time trying to fit in a specific mold, but now you’re free to be whoever you want and you’re only
Weasley hadn’t changed much in the years since the war—his red hair still a shock, his height still a good few centimeters higher than he was, his limbs still gangly and long, with mitts for hands that had made him a decent keeper once he’s gotten over his fear. Tonight, however, he was breaking the Hogwarts illusion, with his solid gold wedding ring flashing in the streetlights, the healing cut along his eyebrow, the dust covering his modest, but newly purchased and well fitting robes. The spindly mitts for hands seemed to have expanded and now matched his height and weight accordingly.
home,
The next day was sunny and bright and they received a morning floo call, which Harry took while Draco tried to prepare some tea that would sooth his stomach. Harry had taken his lie in stride that the interview had gone well and it was only some poorly digested breakfast that had caused his bathroom excursion. Besides, he was busy with cleaning and fretting over the home study. Well, home
“Oh,” he said it more like an exhale of air than a word and the silence settled over them.
was all Draco could think.
“Do you need me?” The words tumbled out, tripping over themselves as they stood there, lightning flashing. He had to know.
“You’re going to have to take a step back ‘Mione, Draco might have heard of UMNAS but Harry’s in the dark,” Ron reminded her, squeezing her shoulder before going to get more wine and some crisps.
So worth it.
He picked up his pace, feeling the bile rising, he hadn’t eaten breakfast consistently since this thing had started. He wasn’t sure, as he moved, if he was in his body or someone else was piloting it, driving him to his destination. Nearly slamming into the stall, he barely had time to throw the latch before he was falling over the bowl, retching and coughing up water and acid. His eyes and nose stung as he retched until there was nothing left and he was wrung out. Stinging as though his skin had been scrapped raw and salted, the burning of his dull and numb tattooed skin only a memory made real. He was still here. He was free. But the things he’d done. The things he’d let happen. Those were still there.
They’d agreed to a lot of things when his father died, sitting side by side at the funeral where a winter storm blew around the magical wards. Even with the warming charms provided by the various lackey’s and well wishers it had been cold. Draco blamed it all on the emotions of the day. The Mother he remembered did too.
“Alright,” she took a sip of wine before leaning back in the seat and rubbing her temples, rich umber skin shining in the firelight, “So here’s the issue.” The witch chewed her words carefully.

“Merlin, I thought you were supposed to help—”
“Very funny,” Harry replied, with a dry tone, giving him a thin smile, “You seem to be in good spirits.” Luckily, he couldn’t hear the constant racing of Draco’s heart, a failing of being the Chosen One, he supposed. “You know what to say right? And you remember what Cynthia said, trying to keep your answers as brief as possible.”
It wasn’t that Harry was trying to make him feel terrible, or discount, at any point, the things that he had gone through at the Manor and after the trials shortly after the war. He was merely trying to comprehend all that had happened in the 24 years since a mad man, drunk on the idea of power, had changed his life forever. It was an idea that had come from the littlest Weasley, shortly after the two had broken up for good, telling him to get some help. He’d gone, ‘only twice out of spite,’ before going a few more times and quitting.
“No,” Draco admitted, avoiding looking at him, “I don’t.”
Her face screwed up as she tried to remember, “I think... we were looking for a pastry, because Mum wanted one for Sunday with Gran, but didn’t like the shop because Clarence’s Mum’s Brother’s Sister stole a dish or something— and then it was really loud and really hot and then I couldn’t feel them anymore but,” she looked up, with tears in her eyes, “I could feel you and you were scared and sad...” Harry nodded like this all made sense, shifting in his seat to be more at her eye level.
about curses. The fact of the matter was, that things with Harry had been going well. Far better than two former school enemies, turned war veterans, and then maladjusted adults, turned semi-functioning and slowly strengthening couple ought to be.

“Another adventure on your way to school?”
It had taken all of his strength and the better part of an hour but he’d eventually sent Harry home. He hadn’t wanted to but he was still drunk as anything and Draco didn’t want this mutual confession to be a spur of the moment thing, regardless of how little they talked.

“Then we’ll have to take care of her, won’t we?” Draco said softly, feeling his heart twist uncomfortably in his chest, “So she’s not alone.”
“Talk with the couple individually, evaluate the home, evaluate the child,” Liza stated helpfully.
His heart ached with longing and unsaid words and other silly little things as he shut the door behind him, hearing Harry pop out of existence on the other side.
There were no excuses for such childish behavior, because it

And of course, there’s tons of contention between the British and Irish governments about this, hence the attack. The death eater’s were the Brits problem not the Irish—which of course the Brits counter that this is just the IRA using the Brits dark wizard’s look and feel. And of course, no one can just form an international task force to handle this. Maybe it’s high time someone invented wizarding Interpol. I did base some parts of it off of the unfortunately common car bombings / bombings of the Troubles, particularly how often the targets were civilians.

“Rarely do I get to say this about the cases we take on,” she said, “But it’s just so nice to see two people in love.”

“You do like reading,” Harry added, patting his ankle again before getting up and heading to the freezer to get the sweets while Draco watched him over the arm of the chair. This was his favorite kind of night— just the two of them and pleasant discussion. He wasn't sure he would ever get used to the feeling.
“Exceedingly, but I suppose it’s to make the criminals truly regret what they did.” Draco’s voice was unsteady as Harry half chuckled before sitting next to him, bumping their shoulders together.
“Seems like something she would say,” Harry started, “I wonder if it’s true.”
Dinner would be fine.
“Right. Well.” He looked around for an authority figure and seeing none, drew himself up to full height. “We can handle the situation here but we’re short—could you please, Department Head Potter and—“

Their lives, so similar, so different, could be defined by that silence. By all the things they wanted to say but didn’t. By all the things that were implied or inference or hinted at. If silence was truly worthy of a dragon’s hoard, then they were rich ten times over.

He wouldn’t admit it, but it gave him a quirk of a smile that he blamed on his tiredness.
“I remember a distant cousin of mine talking about him— he’d spent time in the States and really admired the bloke, was practically a saint to him.”
Harry and Weasley both turned towards Draco. Because it was Draco who had said that.

“What Harry means,” Draco cut through,  “Is that the auror’s on scene tasked us with making sure Rebecca got here safely—he’s head of the Department of Magical Child Services in the British Ministry. Show her your badge, Harry.”  Harry blinked once, but did as he was asked, pulling out his somewhat ratty wallet—Draco really had to get him a new one for Christmas— and showed his badge and card.

“Oh.” Harry Potter looked at it in shock but then his lips curled up in a smile, taking the plate carefully, “You’re really good at this.”
“Come in,” Harry’s voice came from beyond and the door swung open and there he was.
Harry turned and stared at him. There was maybe two meters of space between them but he could have sworn he could feel the other man just as close as they were earlier when they were fighting in the alley.
“Not a lot of good came from that,” he replied, as they sat on the edge of the big memorial, the one for the Princess, their
It was rare, in his opinion, that Draco Malfoy found himself in the middle of the Patel’s store, staring at the rugs, recently imported by way of magic carpet from Bangladesh, and trying to decide if he’s ever going to bite the bullet to get one for the front room or just leave it as is and continually curse the cold stone beneath his feet. Normally, he found himself more at home amongst the rows and rows of dishes, flatware and silverware, remembering fondly the various sets his mother would have for different occasions. It had been several weeks of staring at the rugs since he had first come in making this his new haunt and still his feet were cold. By now, he knew the layout of the store, knew the aisles and the different areas where the lights didn’t quite reach as well. Where one could find a spice rack versus a spice cabinet versus spices to fill it. Typically, he was more a lurker of the home goods or the wall simply labeled ‘Oddities,’ but as of late he was more often hovering around the rugs.
When Harry wakes up, not 20 minutes later, Draco’s taken charge of holding the girl, and the waiting room has emptied out a bit, enough where it’s no longer a dull roar.

“I’m not saying that to be nice, honest, I...” He hesitated, looking back at Draco, “You remember what I told you about? In my office in April?” He said, rapidly. As if to prove a point, he nodded in response of his own question. “Then you remember that I tried to quit being an auror. About how I was still fighting a war that was over and that I couldn’t relax and that it was tearing me apart at the seams?”
with the bookseller down the street) and he was now working his way through
“So,” setting his papers back on his desk, Harry added milk to his tea, “After the war, Ron, Hermione and I were essentially guaranteed jobs as aurors. Ron and I took up the offer after the bulk of the trials, Hermione chose to finish school and once that was done, they would get married. So Ron and I started to work as aurors, after passing the rather perfunctory testing.” Harry paused to take a sip and set the mug down. The mug itself said Tate Modern along the side. Draco’s said London Zoo, he now noticed. “What the ministry didn’t really advertise at the time is that they had rather depleted numbers and there were still groups of death eaters roaming about the country on their last hurrah. So, with our experience, and a lack of competition, we went right to top.”
Kissing in the middle of his doorway in front of his flat and Harry tasted like whiskey and a hint of lager and the smell of cigarettes was still on him and for once his lips weren’t chapped and Draco’s mind couldn’t handle any more because it was everything he wanted and if this was death then he was more than ready to welcome it into open arms—
“—Oh stop it—” she blushed. Draco was more certain than ever it would be fact within the decade. But a thought sprung up through the certainty, that
“Lake Michigan?” Tommy answered, seeing Harry nod, “It’s the second biggest in the country—actually, from what I remember last time I was in the Chicago History Museum, I think you could fit the whole of the England or something in it, both in depth and size.”
. “Do you need me?”
“Buncha times—” Tommy laughed and Cynthia cut in: “Never let it be doubted that American’s are fool enough to try anything at least a dozen times, just in case they get lucky and are the first.” Even Draco laughed at that, Harry watching him, delighted at the sound.
“Maybe we should get one of those welcome mats before the studies next week? And maybe some candles, those would add a feminine touch…” Harry rattled off a few more ideas, hanging up their cloaks and setting the keys on the hook.
It’s so small, with five adults in it and he can’t imagine it filled with all of Rebecca’s favorite things. More and more things piling in. A whole life time. He can’t—

“That’s right,” Matilda smiled bravely at the nice man who also just happened to make it a habit of saving the world. It was hot and sticky and he just wanted to be a home in the cool calm quiet of their flat. “Thanks, I just— sometimes I forget that we don’t always need the machine.”
or more against a hundred thousand, he still couldn’t grasp the numbers of it. He had been one of them and while he left it behind, the world would remember. What part he had had in it and how many of that number were his. Unfettered darkness creeping up, a tangle of plants lurking nearby, waiting to pull more in. He wondered what they would think of him after they read through the to-be-completed parental fitness surveys.

“I… like leave the house?” He didn’t understand the question.
Harry sucked in a shaky breath. “I love you too I—“ he hesitated, “I shouldn’t have sprung this on you, Rebecca...”
Wait.
“Not much money in being an heir these days,” he admits, returning to the teacups, making them look, for all intents and purposes, like two strangers and not something else. “I work with Blaise at his firm—it’s like curse breaking, specifically dark magic. There’s a lot of it left lying around.”
“We both shouldn’t have,” Harry kissed him properly and hard, fat drops of rain rattling the windows, the summer storm finally broken. “We’ll talk about it tomorrow, after we—”

didn’t have to show how lost he was but Draco’s head was spinning.
“Either that or it’s something to do with not being a Gryffindor,” he added, noting how people seemed to avoid both of them, though her less than him, “Considering we’re the only two not directly related to that house.”
“There’s more to it, isn’t there? And it’s not about the war, is it?” Harry just looked relieved that someone understood, green eyes locked on his, making him feel pinned to the chair with the force of that look.
“Mum says it’s because the magic passed over her and that Da’s Mum—not her Mum—she’s a real banshee. But Mum says that sort of stuff all the time.” She was taking this well if a bit dazed.
“Well, no,” Harry conceded, “Though, I think in sixth form, you’d have to do all sorts of complex spatial maths and reasoning. But up until I went to Hogwarts that was something I learned every day.”
They were quiet for a moment.
It was so beyond late at this point, his mind circling round and round on what it meant, rewriting the conversation where he came out on top or where Potter felt so awful for approaching him that he left in shame or that, even curiouser, he left with him. Draco didn’t like to dwell on any of these situations but no matter which way he turned on the rich sheets or how he fluffed his pillows or how often he tried counting backwards from 100, sleep eluded him. He turned again towards the window, regretting everything that had happened there and hating the thousand things that hadn’t.
“How is she?” is what he said, ignoring the fact that Potter was here and warm and dry, the bastard.
Outside, the rain had stopped but the sun was too weak to break through the clouds. By now, Harry and Ronald were probably deep into a discussion of the cases of the day, and nary a thought spared for the former death eater sitting maudlin in his chair.
“Draco,” his Mother started, pursing her lips in a common expression, “Darling, you seem…”
Unlike Weasley, who had seemed to simply grow into a larger version of his school self, Hermione Weasley-Granger has changed rather a lot. Her hair, still bushy as ever, was shorter, framing her rounded face, showing her long neck and making her umber skin luminescent with how it curled around, even in the bright hall lights. Her eyes were only slightly furious under her arched brows, her body more filled out as if her younger self were a sketch of the powerful witch she would become, and he felt his nose wince remembering the pain of her punch and that she’d never needed her wand to cause damage. Damage that she clearly felt like inflicting, judging by how her eyes narrowed at the three of them.
“How big is it?”
Regardless of past walks, it was on this walk that the idea had been proposed:
“Hmm,” he started, “What was your favorite subject?”
“Draco, what’s your problem? Why are you acting like…” He paused, looking for the words that Draco knew he wanted and was trying to substitute. Even now, that was how Harry still categorized him. Months of whatever this was, wasted. He wasn’t sure what hurt more.
How does one say: ‘I miss you and that’s why I wanted to hurt you.’ ‘I was scared so I hurt the people I cared about.’ ‘I wanted to run but I couldn’t leave you, so I took it out on you.’
, thank you.
Then, using his powers of whatever the hell it was that made him the Boy Who Defeated the Dark Lord, Harry had ushered him in and hung up his coat, prattling about something or other as Draco was becoming more and more aware that he was far too overdressed in his slimming cashmere jumper, tailored shirt and dark, expensive denim even when he was

childish. He was a grown man, a man who had survived a war. And instead of facing the fear together, he’d torn them apart in some misaligned idea to keep them safe.
“Your place is so well decorated like I imagined,” Harry blurted out and then looked properly embarrassed for interrupting, “Christ how do you—”
“A year, and a half,” he winced and Draco felt as shocked as he probably looked. But looking at him, he knew that needling him was the wrong way to handle this news and, knowing Granger, he probably got that enough as it was.
Harry’s laughter next to him was warm and close. They kept walking, even though they were in a wizarding neighborhood and could part at any time.  “Sorry I sprung this on you.”
“So was I! So were a lot of people! But Merlin, Draco, it’s not going to allow any of us to live our fucking
my mum for being a witch. I don’t know if it was ever true and deep hate, because she did take me in, but she hated her. Hated her life, her husband and...” Harry trailed off. He was still facing the wall, one hand pressing into it, but Draco wasn’t sure if it was the wall holding up Harry or the other way around. He looked at the floor, shame in his voice. “She hated me. Just a year old and she hated me. Hates me even now, if she thought I was still alive. Her husband— Vernon, hated me too. And their son, they raised him to hate me as well. And you know, that wouldn’t have bothered me. If there’s one thing this whole savior business has done, it made me realize that doing what’s right even when being hated is far better than anything else.” Harry sounded so sold and tired. Tired of the whole business. How much more could he take? Not much, Draco surmised.

After another hour and a half, Cynthia finally stood up, cracking her knuckles. Her suit jacket had been discarded to the back of the chair, a bit shapeless in the shoulders, and now she stood up, examining what they had done. She was wearing a faintly patterned purple blouse, fashionably tucked into her high-waisted trousers, cutting a figure that wouldn’t look out of place of those black and white films that played on the Telly at times, only much larger than the shrunken people and in full color. Thomas had another one of those pens that he was clicking as he looked up from his notes. He’d also lost his suit jacket, now leaning back in his chair, his sleeves rolled up and showing a smattering of black ink on his forearms. Draco watched for movement but there was none. They appeared to be muggle tattoos. He wondered what sort of people could get into Mage-USA, what families and connections mattered out of 16 million.
“So we wait.”
“Blaise—”
in his flat (which was tastefully decorated and full of things in the opposite way that someone else’s was not) and he visited his aunt and his distant nephew on New Year’s with mother and he spent time at lunch with Harry and time at the pub with Harry and occasionally with Ronald and he dropped off the drunken oaf as before and exchanged nods with Weasley-Granger and complained to Harry over post about his coworkers and everything,
pure gets us an even higher 62,000 GBP per 1000 Galleons to play with (and a total wealth of 2.7M GBP), the price of a flat in Pimlico in 2000 (average around 337,000GBP, which isn’t a great measure considering that the price would vary across the neighborhood, the various schools, how many rooms, etc and median would work better but we’re guesstimating here) and now (roughly 1.1M GBP) is greatly different so you’re going to have to believe with me on this one that for 2-3,000 galleons Harry Potter bought a small two room flat in a decent but not great area of muggle Pimlico in the year 2000 by unwittingly using economics. Maybe from a Y2K fanatic or a Euro fanatic, either way being mobbed at a wizarding bank to go quietly pay cash for a house doesn’t seem like his bag, so assume he went to a muggle bank and walked out with enough to lay down some fat stacks.
He tries to move out of the way but he nearly bumps into Liza who huffs a small sound so he nearly steps into the way of John’s measurements of the window.
“I think it’s the size of Europe, roughly,” Harry said, trying to recall his scant public schooling, “It’s massive compared to here.”
“Malfoy?” Draco didn’t quite droop, but it was a near thing. It was the Dour, Tall Auror again, “We’re going to need you to do a walkthrough and give us your statement for the record—” He stumbled on his words, looking at Harry Potter standing next to Draco, “—Oh, Auror Potter,” he blustered out, standing a little taller, “I didn’t realize you were here.”
“Oh whatever you poncy git, just because it’s not some pur— things like polo and fencing doesn’t mean the common people are devoid of talents. Thanks, you can keep the change.” He added, swiping up the chocolate and pulling Draco out of his astonishment and into the street.
“We will make sure to pull the reports,” he added, “To verify their accuracy.” Draco nodded, remembering he had forgotten or rather couldn’t eat breakfast this morning, his stomach twisted so poorly he wasn’t sure it would ever accept food again.
“I mean, they’re all nice, as far as rugs go,” and he gave a half smile at Draco, as if there wasn’t a gulf of history and emotion and baggage between them, because he was Harry Fucking Potter and that was just the lark of a life he led, having conversations about rugs with people he tangentially knew, “Not that I would know but you’re someone of good taste—is red too tacky and decidedly Gryffindor?”
Draco sharply shut the book in his lap, staring at the words
“It seems fascist ideologies go hand in hand with wizards and muggles,” Hermione concluded, not unkindly, “Now, here’s where the magical government joined forces with the muggles to stop the war and end some diseases, it wasn’t just that Dumbledore arrived in annexed Austria alone to fight Grindewald, he had the support of American military and wizards helping to pave the way as they were fighting their way towards their own monster. There was a pacific theater, changing powers and world leaders, new technology that changed the world, etc, and followed all the way through the abdication of Harold Humphrey, the Magical president, right after the end of the muggle war. Ring any bells?”
came Harry’s voice, unbidden into his mind. It had been a month since the conversation in the office and all he could think about was that they were far beyond last names now and even then all he could think of was the stupid bloody trial.
The sounds would fade but smell he would never forget.
“I split my time between the field office in Chicago and DC, so I can keep up with all the politicians,” Thomas added, “The weather is nice here so far. Less rainy than I thought it would be.”
“On what?” Harry seemed to be following his motions, a somber waltz of unsaid things that was common now. He wondered if this is what had happened to his parents. They’d probably fight again.
He tried to push Lacey out— with her safe, he’d be able to try and save Mikaela, he was now trying to call out, “Mikaela Stone, I have your daughter, she’s safe for now, how are you doing?” At no point in his cursebreaking training did they ever go over how to handle victims. In fact, it was often why Draco would avoid the cases were people were already there, preferring to avoid any awkward stares or silences. But this week a new group of people were moving into reclaimed homes, which meant the firm was stretched thin  and considering all the rest of his cases were in the next wave, he’d been the last one available on short notice. Water pounded the sides of the house at a dull roar.
“I’m not letting you go—that was rude to Ron but—” His eyes softened, just slightly and Draco felt his heart seize in his chest. He didn’t want pity. “I get why you’re angry but you can’t just leave.” He kept his hold but loosened his grip slightly, and the blond was about to wrench free when Harry continued, ”Please.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The first thing Harry registered when he came to were dark eyes, black stringy hair, and a hooked nose about two inches from his face.
Harry's stomach turned at the thought of floo travel. Mr. Weasley had explained it to him earlier when Mrs. Weasley had first gone to call Dumbledore and it sounded positively dreadful. Mr. Weasley had even mentioned the possibility of getting lost in the Floo Network and winding up in the wrong place completely. He was relieved to see Snape was shaking his head.
Eventually Mrs. Weasley ordered Fred, George, and Ron to go and de-gnome the garden and for Harry to stay behind. Percy had long since left the table to go write to someone; the twins had taken great fun in teasing him about it.
It was as if she thought Draco might say something to embarrass the family in public. Frankly, Draco thought his parents embarrassed themselves enough by flaunting there imbecilic, prejudice beliefs all over the place.
It didn't help that he hadn't been able to sneak into the muggle town all week and was quickly running out of muggle literature to distract himself. He was getting bored and the diary was the most interesting thing around.
But, no. There was no excuse. Never mind what type of situation Harry was in at home, Severus had had no excuse to treat a child that way. Lily would have been repulsed by his behaviour.
Draco sat back and waited for Riddle to write back. It didn't take long.
Once they were completely out of the room, Draco decided to investigate the sneezing. He opened the cabinet and froze momentarily in surprise at the sight of the Saviour of the Wizarding World covered in ashes and half healed yellowing bruises. Harry Potter seemed just as surprised as Draco felt and for a few seconds they just gaped at one another. Then Draco closed his mouth and gathered his wits.
They played endless rounds of exploding snap and wizard’s chess and eventually on one particularly boring day Harry even taught them all the muggle game of hide-and-go-seek. Harry was glad they didn't find it too childish, and he felt something mend inside of him at finally being able to play one of the first games Dudley had ever excluded him from with his friends.
Draco was lucky that he had had the foresight to put an enlarging charm and a feather light charm on the inside of a rucksack (a purchase he had made the week before in the muggle town, along with some casual muggle clothing) before he came, or he would have been hard pressed to carry all of his books home. As it was he only had to carry them to an alley beside the book store and then he stuffed them all in his bag. He would have to pack all of his muggle things in the bag when he got home so that he could just throw the bag in his trunk with his school stuff.
“I told you not to move Potter.” Snape glared at an apologetic Mrs. Weasley as he took the glasses out of Harry's hands and placed them gently on Harry's face.
Harry lay carefully back down on the hospital bed. “Professor... I... please don't feel bad. I could have told you last year, but I didn't. There's no reason for you to feel bad Sir.”
As soon as breakfast was finished the next morning everyone ran (or in Percy's case, was dragged) out to the orchard by the Weasley's house to play. Harry and Ginny were seekers Fred and George doubled as beaters and keepers while Ron and Percy were chasers.
“Yes, my boy. His name is Remus Lupin, and he was a dear friend of your parents when they were still alive.”
Draco had actually sat down and made a list of the people he had been worst to, and he was surprised at how long it had actually gotten. He had expected to have to put down Neville Longbottom and the Gryffindor trio, but once had started writing the list he had been surprised by how many people had actually come to mind. At this point he thought it might actually be better just writing a column in the Daily Prophet titled My Sincerest Apologies to Everyone for Being Such a Spoiled Prat, by: Draco Malfoy. It would certainly take less time.
In the end, after seeing how wrong his father had been about wizards, Draco decided to scrap all previous notions about muggles and see them for himself. So, three days after the summer holiday had started, Draco had sneaked off into the closest muggle town to do just that.
Before Hogwarts the only people Draco had ever been around were his father's business associates and their children. Naturally, that meant that he had only ever known pure-bloods. Draco had always taken Lucius' word for it when he'd said that half-bloods and muggle-borns were inferior to pure-bloods, and that muggles were little more than clothed monkeys. After spending a while at school though, Draco had realized his father's views were not completely accurate.
They promise and they move from the cafeteria to the dorm’s main area. Uraraka had texted Midoriya and Iida to let them know the change of plans since they couldn’t all fit in the small study room.
Harry came up for air and pulled her hips down closer- making her arch ever so slightly off the bed.
Momo readied her staff, gripping it tightly. She noticed that his neck collar was gone and remembered that meant his quirk had been activated. She didn’t feel any different, so it probably meant the mask was doing its job.
There was a moment of silence between the three of them as the information was processed.
Momo groaned at her aching body. She wanted to take a shower and eat something high in carbs. She absently played with the delicate braid Harry had done for her, going back and forth thinking about the sweet man who cleaned her off and braided her hair versus the absolute sex fiend that made her cum just from his mouth.
“ Figures you guys would be lame,” Draco says.
From the girl’s loud moans she seemed to be enjoying herself too much to notice Midoriya watching. The guy turned his head and smiled at Midoriya.
The more sensible students blushed red. The others whispered among themselves.
“ Hi Uraraka, Iida brought this to share tonight, he handed me this and ran off to get the rest,” he said. The two of them set up the small room for dinner, with the food spread out buffet-style on a table for them to sit around in a more traditional setting.
??! It was the transfer student Harry. He was currently fucking the daylights out of some upperclassmen girl that Midoriya couldn’t recognize.
She felt her lady bits quiver at the thought. Ok, she really needed to take a shower.
Momo felt her body start to build up to climax.
“ See it tastes good huh? Here you need to try the beef with some rice,” Uraraka says- continuing to feed him various foods.
Midoriya slapped a hand over his own mouth in shock. He didn’t mean to insult Harry like that.
Harry grumbles and pushes his head against Draco’s chest like an unruly cat.
Momo let out a breath she had been holding and started to quickly walk back to her own dorm.
She grabbed fist fulls of his hair and pressed harder against his face. She rode out her climax with a few more thrusts against him-slightly abusing his open mouth.
They were spotted at a vacant corner table with empty seats around them, as other students stared and whispered about the newbies.
“ Stop. They may have their licenses already but they were sent here by their government to learn. From what I was told, they’re a little immature and their agency wants them to come down to earth some more,” Aizawa tells them.
The trio left to eat with Harry and Draco, as they had promised to start introducing new people slowly.
There were still some things he didn’t explain, like why Harry talks the way he does and what was the ‘incident’ that caused his quirk and mental illness to appear. Why does he wear sunglasses all of the time?
Draco finished undressing them both and settled onto the bed.
To her relief, it was Harry, who looked to be alone in the room.
“ Hey don’t be so shitty, he was just trying to welcome you here,” Bakugo surprisingly spoke up.
At that moment Mr. Aizawa walked into the room looking as apathetic and exhausted as ever. You’d think after teaching class 1-A for three years that’d he’d get used to their antics.
Now, looking back at the match, she blushed at what had happened. Her class had seen and heard her reaction to Harry’s quirk and it was slightly embarrassing.
Both fingers and tongue moved in and out of her at a rising speed.
He continued to throw marbles at Todoroki’s head, enjoying watching the boy get frustrated.
“ I think that’s a great idea. As class rep, I vote we should try to make our new exchange students feel welcome. They may be a little odd but surely it’s because they are foreigners, who are unfamiliar with our customs,” Iida projected.
Sure, Kirishima and Bakugo had open chested costumes, but they didn’t look like Harry and they definitely didn’t have pierced nipples. She could see that Tsu was having the same problem next to her.
The class blanched at his rudeness. He was so cold and bitter.
Soon their moans of pleasure intertwined as they brought each other closer to climax.
Momo panted slightly at the still going friction assault on her lower regions.
The pair really were total opposites.
Not much later the matches start. They were long since everyone can almost predict each other’s moves. That’s why it was harder for each pair to win since they have to surprise both members of the opposite team to retrieve the flags.
Momo stammered. “ I smell….like what?” She asked.
When she told him she wanted the full experience today, Harry must’ve taken that seriously.
Midoriya quickly turns away, blushing profusely.
“ It seems that Mr. Aizawa is telling Draco that he cannot park his car there. Draco is calling him some choice words. Some seem to be in English and Japanese,” Shoji says.
With that, they headed back to the starting field since they were the last group to go.
The entirety of Class 1-A took the seat around them, effectively giving the transfers no choice in the matter.
For the first time since starting this job, Draco laughed and with it, felt lighter than he had since receiving the note. He had a lunch date to make.
“I was a
“Or you could just go to bed,” Harry added, giving him a push.
They start with the easy questions—can he verify his employment, his home, his identity. Then what Harry does, where he lives, his identity, and if there are any other people in the household that they need to verify or interview. John asks these in succession and they confer that it matches what Harry says.
Draco had tuned out while Harry walked through the case, but now he shook himself out of his thoughts, to see what they needed to do next.
“Yeah?” Harry brightened, mouth twisting into a grin, one he almost always wore on the good days, because he somehow knew that Draco’s own mouth would twist in a similar way after awhile. His own traitorous facial muscles gave a twitch.
great question, I’ve just invented it. I know a lot of other fic comes up with these great ideas where Harry can’t be an auror anymore because of the PTSD from the war and all sorts of other things but I also think that his trauma goes further back that it’s important to remember he’s got all that other baggage from the Dursley’s. So essentially, he created a group (team of one) that handles the children left behind by magical violence/neglect. He’ll go to the location, gently talk down the kids from wherever they’re hiding, then bring them back to his office to rest while he contacts next of kin or finds a solution through the many wizarding families he’s come to know. Many of which are very happy to help the great Harry Potter. It’s very much like DCFS or CPS or specifically in the UK, the Department for Children, Schools and Families. It’s tough work but it’s very rewarding in a way that being an auror isn’t to him. He gets to save kids all the time, no one knows about what he does because he spends very little time on scene and he feels good about the progress he makes.
The aurors were still milling about, an older one smoking on a pipe as they watched the house with suspicion and finally himself with the same looks as he exited onto the wet lawn, “Well, Malfoy?”
weathered from years of working outdoors in the sun. Something about his expression reminded him of the older aurors, which made him realize that pausing too long would only feed the gentleman's attitude that he didn’t suffer fools.
“Mum’s do that a lot, don’t they?” Harry smiled gently at her, “Draco’s Mum does that all the time.”
They each watch other a moment. Harry has soot across his face and his sleeve is ripped in several places—the blood long ago now coagulated, his broken glasses and singed hair. At least he looks more settled around the chaos of Processing, the walk and purpose doing him good. Draco’s certain he looks a sight: his trousers are certainly torn, with grime dug into the knees where he’d had to dodge a stinging hex, only complimenting his burnt hair and sliced up left side, and his lovely pale slate sweater he’d bought at the Galleries Lafayette with the twisting cabled vines completely ruined. But that doesn’t stop Harry from reading his mind, apparently.
it, deep in his bones. He couldn’t articulate it, not to Hermione, when she’d asked why and not to Ron when he said it was bloody weird and not even to Luna, who out of everyone would just
“Wasn’t planning on it,” he said copying Luna’s grin from earlier, “I
“You’ve got it.” And when Harry smiled at him, it was like watching the sunrise.
His gaze lifted up, wondering if anyone actually bought the ones on the highest shelves. Draco wasn’t quite sure what was so entrancing about the lights here—they weren’t torches, or flickering candlelight, a comforting sight of his childhood and his school years and one very terrifying incident during a heatwave vis a vis his punishment, and they definitely weren’t the obnoxious bright white lights of the muggle world. He wasn’t even sure why he always ended up here, roaming the open late rows of product supplied by the Patel family. Maybe he’d just found something he liked, that the store was anonymous enough that no one recognized him from the copies of the old Prophet or maybe they just didn’t care, such was the clientele. It was a good feeling, a strange but good feeling, to know that no one around you knew or cared who you were. It was freeing after a life of notoriety.
By the time they’d finally gotten through and Draco had shaken off the feeling of being compressed through sections of pipes, the lunch crowd had mostly disappeared from the hall, already back in their offices and their meetings and already glued to the memos and post flying around the atrium.
“That’s good news,” he said, drying his hand and then taking a sip of the tea. It was too sweet and too milky but it was better than continuing on an empty stomach. “Have they heard about Hogwarts?”
Every day, they’d wake up, breakfast in the hotel, then head over to visit Rebecca, who was currently living somewhat in the hospital and somewhat in the ministry. And Draco could tell, he was slowly becoming more and more attached to her, and Harry had been halfway gone since day one. Saint Potter indeed.
Harry said something to him as he ducked into the room and he knew he didn’t even react, so lost in the cobwebs of his memories that he didn’t even offer the reassuring smile he had planned. He couldn’t see into the room, not like the one he’d been in, so instead he sat on the hard wooden chairs and looked down on his hands as he clenched them together over and over again. They’d grown a bit older in the time since he’d been here last but that was okay. It was going to be fine.
Anyway, that’s my thoughts on the matter. At some point, the team will probably expand to a whole network of people like him and he’ll get to retire quietly, knowing he’s left something behind for the better and with zero press coverage until after he dies. Not a bad end for the Boy Who Lived. Bonus points for anyone who finds the LotR reference in these and double bonus points if you can get all the Harry Frodo parallels in the two.
“Then we’ll need to find her family if there’s any left.”

“It was a logical reaction—I heard what he’d done to the snake!”
Harry around for the firm’s Christmas party” and now it was becoming habit to bring Harry round for tea every now and then and he was getting along with Mother like a house on fire and it was too good. Far too good for the likes of him. But he’d be damned thrice and likely disowned if he didn’t take it while he could.
“Patel’s,” Draco blurted out, “That’s why you were there.” Harry gave him a small smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry I brought it up—I was just curious.” Curiosity was natural, the reason why muggles often stopped to view traffic accidents on the road, little ‘cameras’ coming out to capture the scene. He wondered if Rebecca would have the same questions that Thomas did. If she would ask the same questions and then accept his demure answers. Would he become his father, hiding dark wizards under the guise of work? He hoped not.
“Well, green but I’m looking to go with a blue. Eventually.” He ponders this, looking at the row of dish sets, book set on a lower level of dish ware in a ghastly mustard. Suddenly he feels so tired, giving his opinion to someone who cares not one iota about him, exhausted from lack of sleep, sleepy from sitting in the weak autumn sun earlier. Almost as if this short interaction had used up the last of his energy. But look at the plates he did and—
“What is your problem with this? Why now?” Harry accused, playing his part perfectly, as if things hadn’t even changed, “Do you know how much time and my money I’ve spent on this?”
like it.”
Abstractly, Draco knew who Liza Wentworth and John Abernathy were. He’d seen them in Harry’s office and dropping off case files and shadowing him on the rare cases where his and Harry’s jobs aligned. And he knew the basic facts about them, enough to where if he had to report them missing to an aurora, he probably could do it.
“Sorry,” he added, as the witch inspected it, “Normally, everyone knows who I am.”
teachers and over four
“Did you just move in...?” Draco cautiously stepped forward, looking at the tiny table with one chair, the empty drawing room devoid of anything, the office, with its distressed glass French doors and utilitarian desk, with the same empty feeling to it. He remembered what Harry had told him, almost a year ago, about how it was hardly a palace. This was hardly a flat. The kitchen was empty, not even dishes in the rack, and down the slight hall, the bathroom across from the bedroom where the mattress sat on the floor in the dim light from the hall. His footsteps echoed and outside the moon shined. The walls were the plain white of sold property and the floors were a little dusty and it was so
“Isn’t that doing it to spite me?” Draco asked, tracing the silver frame next to the potted plant where Lily and James Potter, now younger than them both, waved at him among the autumn leaves, “Or, rather, imaginary me.”
, you dirty little Weasel.”
Now why were they together, when the anger and hatred boiled up so easily, when harsh words were so common, when everything was falling apart, how were they even together? He could have left at any time, just picked up his things and gone, but having Harry, even when they were spitting angry, was better than not.

Draco let out an exasperated sigh, “Honestly—“
“Oh I hear that all the time still,” Draco inhaled sharply again at that, “But this is just the main rooms—“ He stood up with some effort, shaking his legs out, “Come on, the office and bedroom and bath look better, it’s where I spend most of my time anyway.”
“You would think,” he segues, launching into another, related story but all Draco notices is the small, tentative smile that he’d first seen in the rug aisle. Maybe tonight wasn’t a total loss.

“If you say,” Draco drawled, trying to be as dry as possible, “That this is the start of a beautiful friendship...”
“Nah,” Thomas drawled, “In Chicago—” and that word seemed to stretch beyond its letters, “—We have over a hundred different neighborhoods, and some of them are named after the immigrants that moved there, Greektown, Andersonville for the Swedes, Ukrainian Village, Chinatown, Lithuanian Plaza, Pilsen, Polish Village. It may not be as ‘fancy’ as New York but that’s what you get for being the city of broad shoulders.”
Draco Malfoy didn’t know what the call was about until it was far too late. He hated these.
“Yeah, Bloody Saint Potter,
“But,” Billings floundered for a second, wanting to control his case but also wanting to follow orders. Maybe if Draco was lucky, he would simply explode from indecision and— suddenly all he could think of was the woman grasping and reaching for her daughter and it felt like icy water had been poured all around him. The humor was gone and if he were any paler, they might end up having to call the Spirit task force out here.

Hermione took a deep breath, finished her wine, then took another deep breath.
He reached out and laid his left hand on hers, neatly avoiding his sleeve from going into the plate of untouched biscuits, “I know you do.” It wasn’t so much admittance of anything, the safest answer, while all his answers warred inside of him.
“Merlin, must you do that?” Draco turned around to argue with him. Potter just seemed to grin in return, as if this wasn’t an odd thing.
“I think,” Draco started, “I think this is why we’re supposed to do this together or not at all,” he licked his lips, tasting the scent of rain boiling off the pavement in the growing heat of the summer, “Because my fear is that she’ll have to spend her whole life proving I haven’t gotten too much influence on her. And yours seems to be that she’s gotten too much of your influence on her.”
“Almost like hating people over blood status,” Draco said quietly in the silence. No one breathed for a moment. He never made mention of what he was a part of.
“I hope it will be,” he replied, a bitter tinge to his words.
“Put me in jail with the rest of them? Leave me?” He tried to sound haughty but it was harder and harder to call it forth. Hated the part of Draco Malfoy that still craved punishment for his transgressions. The part that still lost it whenever he stepped into parts of the Ministry or saw curses that were just a bit too viscous.
“She’s doing alright, a small fracture in her wrist but nothing I couldn’t fix up,” he looked down at the girl and gently brushed her wet hair back from her face, “How are you doing Draco?”
“How big is America? They can’t possibly all fit?” He asked no one in particular, one, so they could get off the discussion on population and two, as he couldn’t imagine that many wizards in Diagon Alley or Hogwarts or even at the Ministry
He silently follows the little group up the stairs like a ghost in his own house. They walk through the spare room. Rebecca’s soon to be room.
. He’d decided to give it another shot, now knowing it was one of Hermione’s favorite books. He found he was liking it more as his 200th muggle novel instead of his 4th or 5th.
By the time Draco looked up from his tea at Harry sitting at his desk, dutifully writing reports with what he called a biro, it had been another couple of hours, but time had been fluctuating oddly since he’d arrived at the Ministry of Magic.
“Is it a man?”
If you want to find me, I'm still on tumblr (we-re-always-alright) and the ask box is always open.
into an early grave, never mind having to tell his mother that he’d rather be snogging the
“Right,” Harry responded, off kilter, so Draco took the lead, “If you could follow us to the aparition point, we can get you set up in the flat— then, if you’re not too tired, we can show you what we’ll be working on?”
“If I was done with fighting, then… Then what would be left of Harry Potter? I shut myself up after that, bought my flat and stayed in. Only let Ron and Hermione know where I was. Didn’t even force myself to go out and eat. It was like all the fight had left me and I didn’t even know what to do without it. I was a soldier without a war and a boy without a family and a man without a purpose and I thought I’d just waste away there.” Harry said, a hint of shame in his voice as he trailed off.
because spending time with Harry felt traitorously and deceivingly good—
“Lacey, please, you need to let go so I can help your mother,” but that only made her cling harder, her breaths coming in shallow pants as she entered an even more panicked state, “Lacey please, let go.”
The world looked like an explosion of riotous color and the amount of magic in the air was thick enough to taste. Draco’s felt himself tire far sooner than he remembered.
Blaise was quiet for a moment, leaning against the shelves in his office and watching him.
Harry surged forward, hugging him so tightly, “Draco, I know it’s hard. I’m scared too.” He sharply inhaled, a motion he could feel through the hug. “I know, love, I’m terrified they’re going to drag up everything. And raising a child… That’s something I never learned, never knew what was right. And I’m not strong at all. I spend 10 minutes every day in the loo trying not to break down because I’m scared and you... just seeing you makes me strong. Because to me, you’re one of the bravest men I’ve ever known…”
It consisted of a lower level, where three desks sat, along with a kitchen and sitting area, and a metal staircase that went up to the two bedrooms and bathrooms, sectioned off from the rest of the space. It had cost quite a bit but Harry had cash to burn and he was taking no chances with this case. Draco thought it a bit extreme on a long shot but who was he to argue? It wasn’t his money.
Loreen’s expression dropped instantly, twisting into something cruel. “Oh. You’re the...” and she looked them up and down, taking in Harry’s ripped jeans and flannel, “Couple,” she decided on, saving what was sure to be something worse for later when there were less witnesses, “That’s been cavorting with my granddaughter.”
Harry fell into him, warm and solid and feeling so much of home that if he weren’t crying before, he was now, “I know, Draco, I know,” he inhaled unsteadily, the sound right by Draco’s ear, “It’s just all so fucked.”
“Thank you, truly,” he added with a drawl. He ducked back into the house, wand at the ready.
“Harry! Draco! Don’t let her take me!” Rebecca was all but screaming her head off and at a rather high pitch (“I don’t know her!!”) and Harry was busy trying to get her to explain with his calm soothing voice so it was up to Draco to straighten his spine and stand between them.
Even when he hadn’t seen the damn fool in a month, here he was, plagued by his voice. It was sixth year all over again.
He copied what Harry did and crouched down to her height, “Did you know I’ve never ridden a bike?”
“How bad is it?”
“It’s clear. I would be cautious of any nausea, some of the magic was well set in. Seems to be Herringborn’s work, with some variations from the Carrows, but the curses are gone so you’re free to go in,” he pushed his hair back with a sigh as they brushed past him, leaving a rookie pair outside as was customary, he was soaked all the way through and just wanted some time to sit down and rest and head home and—
But now she’d started again ever since the end of war and no matter how much he said otherwise, he always hugged her back. Life was too fleeting otherwise.
what that woman would do.” He remembered how it was and how it is. It was awful, to see the difference in their days become muted and desaturated and quiet. But this, this was at least alive.
“I remember Dudley always asking for money and eating enough ice cream to make him sick. If it hadn’t melted by the time he’d left the shop and gotten back to Privet Drive,” Harry started, walking with Draco at an easy strolling pace past Regent’s Park. There was no rush in how they walked, no need to go fast or slow. Their jobs, once things had settled, left them with many empty hours to fill in between.
“What’s that look for, I know things, I can do maths and stuff...”
The Medi-witch gave them both a look but led them back to the break room, where two other witches were attending to a set of aurors and another family with a child. They all stopped when the three of them walked in, staring at the three of them. At first, he assumed it was their appearances, because they were a bit of a sight, or that they had recognized Harry. But then he saw the way their eyes all watched their linked hands.

of all things.
“Certainly.” He wouldn’t fuck this up for Harry now. He was almost free.
Overall, they seemed to pass with flying colors. Even John had cracked a smile at their shared office, with their books and files and the art prints from Luna.
With a last flick, he removed the last ‘detonators’ of the curse several minutes later, sending the magic—garden and pureblood— whizzing up into the sky to fizzle out. He felt his pulse drop slowly,
“Right,” perky and eager to talk she continued, “So this is something I came up with when I was taking my daughter to Girl Scouts—it’s a scouting group that encourages young women to get involved with their community and discover their inner strengths,” she digressed for their inner benefit. Draco idly wondered what Rebecca’s hobbies were and if she did something like that. It seemed a bit mundane. “And the former director a while ago, started using this new management system.

of the curse. It was similar in build to a standard tripwire explosion curse, something nearly every dark family knew and rarely perfected. There was the intent, the trigger, all of the parts, just simmering below the surface of the old brick. He could sense, more than see, the direction it was facing as he passed his wand over it, the familiar motions of his work.
Their tour of the Pimlico property went off without a hitch. There was a few small comments on the decor—he could handle those as they were more surprised that he didn’t recreate the dungeons of Hogwarts there. Or recreate the Manor, he supposed, with all of its Stuart era trappings and art (softened by the influx of art his great grandfather had purchased all the way through the Regency era) though how they probably thought it looked matched more of a dungeon and less of an estate that it was.
“Together,” Draco agreed.

Her mother whined in the background, her hands grasping for her daughter and the mirrors pressed closer—

Harry forced out a laugh as they continue their climb, “You’ll have to get in line behind Hermione and me.”
“And muggles are what you call non-magic people, right?”
By the time Harry had gotten back to his flat, he was ecstatic.

He pulled out his wand and cast the glamor over the one he already had for his dark circles. In the mirror, Draco looked far better and more put together now. The redness on his face faded away until he looked as he usually did. What he usually looked like before all of this. He wished he were home, for as little as it would stay home. Would the Camden place ever fill that space?

He answered, rote from what the judges had said: “Aiding and abetting treasonous behavior, aiding and abetting blood purity or magically motivated harassment, assault and public disorder and,” he swallowed again, watching both John avoid eye contact with him while Liza stared at him, “And aiding and abetting conspiracy to commit murder.” He had been lucky, the Wizegamot had told him, that they were only giving him ‘aiding and abetting,’ which, while was charged similarly to Treasonous Behavior, Blood Purity or Magically Motivated Harassment, Assault and Public Disorder and Conspiracy to Commit Murder, meant he would never have to admit guilt to the treason, harassment, assault and conspiracy. He would only have it on his conscience.
He was life itself, unabashed and human in all the ways there could be, bottled into a tincture that Harry wanted, constantly.
“I am sorry,” he said after a short silence, with true sincerity because he did truly feel it, even if he didn’t cast the curses or kidnap her himself, because he was at fault for believing it, “For—” He paused, an unfortunate habit he seems to have picked up from Harry, “Everything.” She watched him over the rim of her umbrella, her blue eyes deep and probing.
“Draco?”
“No, it’s from today,” the witch nodded and worked up a spell to clean the cuts and burns—he was certain like the rest of them, Rebecca was going to have some weird hair for a while. Then she handed Rebecca another potion (a simple Pepper Up Potion or something local variety) before turning to them.
“Every day.” And it was true. He would survive through anything at this rate, perhaps even the solicitors, but it wouldn’t be living. Not without Harry. Harry who made him feel as if he were loving and brave and wonderful, even when he was not. “You… Life is better with you in it.”
