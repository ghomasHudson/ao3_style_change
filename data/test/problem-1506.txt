Harry, himself, was proud of his project.  He had, too, spoken with McGonagall, and had gotten permission to contact a magical artist in order to get a portrait of Professor Snape made for the Head’s office.  If he was honest, it had taken a bit of convincing.  McGonagall was not too keen on the idea, but then Harry offered her Snape’s memories, as well as Harry’s memories of Snape’s death.
He cleaned up their mess, moving around Kreacher, who was bustling about the kitchen, mumbling under his breath.
“What are you talking about?”  Harry reached for Draco’s hand, but Draco just stepped away from Harry.
“Thank you, Kreacher,” Harry said as he placed both dishes on the table and poured himself a cup of hot water for tea.  He sat Teddy in his lap, alternating between feeding himself and Teddy, until both had had their fill.
The trio made their way down the stairs, entering the kitchen.  Looking around, it looked a complete mess.  There was no cabinets and holes where the appliances should be.
Draco nodded as Harry went down to the kitchen.  He pulled out the wrapping paper that he had bought just before Harry had gotten back, and found the roll of tape Harry had stashed in a drawer.
Ron walked over to Harry and said, “Blimey, mate.  It looks like he is changing your plans completely.”
“This is brilliant, Harry.  From the stories that I’ve heard of this house, how you were able to make it livable is quite impressive,” Katie said.
Harry had barely settled into his seat before Hermione was saying, “So, Harry, what was it that you wanted to tell Ron and I?”
Harry stood staring at the spot for a few seconds, before shaking his head and going upstairs to get his  cloak.
“Mmhmm, I’m sure.  Here, drink this.  You should get some rest, too.  As should you, Mr Potter.”  She gave Harry a look that would rival Molly Weasley.
Draco looked around at the crowd of people and gauged his stamina.  “I couldn’t agree more.  Let’s go home; we can shop later.”
Malfoy looked a bit shocked, but took the parchment, read it a few times, and handed it back to Harry.
They got dressed in silence.  Draco finished first, seeing as how he just cast a freshening charm on his clothes from the day before and put them on; no matter how many times Harry had broached the subject, nor how many nights Draco spent in his bed, Draco hadn’t officially moved in with him.  He didn’t even keep clothes at Harry’s, instead using a charm to freshen them up, and then floo back to the Manor to change his clothes and go to work.
Draco apparently saw the look in his eyes because he quickly kissed Harry again.  “No, Harry!  I want to.  Gods, do I want to.  But I have plans with Weasley in the morning, so it would be wise of me to actually go home and
Harry had been so surprised by receiving a letter, he almost missed the fact that Draco, who was sitting across the table from him, received one, as well.  The envelope held the same seal as Harry’s.  When the other owl had disappeared, too, Draco looked up at Harry with a confused look.  Harry shrugged his shoulders and opened his letter.
Harry hummed, as the warmth of Draco seeped into his skin, and he started getting groggy.  “I guess this means we really have to start the planning, huh?”
“Wake up!”  He wiggled so he was laying between them, kicking his legs.  “Uncle Draco, it’s snowing again!  Can we go make a snowman?”
It wasn’t long after that Molly called everyone in for supper.  The food was piled high on the table, and everyone tucked in with fervor.
“Draco, I…I…” He didn’t know what to say.  They had talked about the incident briefly, but he had never officially apologized for the curse that he had thrown at Draco without even knowing what it did.
“We were hoping you could tell us.  No, don't try to move.  You broke several ribs.  Madam Pomfrey gave you Skele-Gro, but there’s still not a lot that can be done for ribs.”
“Of course you are, darling.  The host always says his thanks to his guests, and wishes them a happy new year, as everyone gets their drinks.  Now, come on!”  Pansy reached out and grabbed Harry’s free arm, pulling him up the stairs.  Draco followed in their wake, hand still glued to Harry’s.
They stood there talking a bit more with Hagrid, but the snow was beginning to pick up more, so they said their goodbyes, and continued walking down the lane.
Harry cut him off.  “Let’s not do this, okay?” Harry said, turning so they were facing each other.  “Let’s just pretend this is a normal case.”
Hesitating for just a brief moment, and with an odd look on his face, Malfoy took Harry’s hand and shook it, saying, “See you then.”
McGonagall continued.  “Because of this, I feel that you all should be granted a bit of freedom.  I reached out to the Board of Directors, and a conclusion was made: you have been granted permission to leave school property at the weekend.”
“Me, too.  Come on, we have just a few minutes until the portkey activates.  Is everything good upstairs?”
Seeing the look on Draco’s face, his letter seemed to be about the same thing.  They looked up at each other and silently passed each other’s letters across to the other.
One weekend, after close to 1.5 years of getting to know them, Harry had asked Draco round for dinner.  Draco had thought that everyone was going to be there, so readily agreed, but was completely thrown off when he walked in, expecting to see his friends, and only found Harry, in a button-up shirt and slacks, standing in front of a candle lit dinner.
Narcissa began walking through the furniture, saying things like, “Oh, that is beautiful,” or “I remember that from my great-grandfather’s house!”  She was about half way across the room when she turned and said, “May I mark the items that I want and get them a few at a time?  I will need to find places for them, you see.”
Made of white gold, it was an outline of an open book, but the outline wasn’t completely closed.  It was slanted, so the top left corner of the design was where the chain attached.  Also in the corner was a small sapphire, and a larger heart-shaped diamond just underneath that.  In all, Harry thought it looked exquisite, and he was even more sure that Hermione was going to love it.
“I like that wrapping paper,” he said, glancing at the rolls of paper with waving snowmen and flying reindeer on them.  There was another that looked like silver ribbon floating through the air.
The original long table was still there, but shined up.  Hermione took in everything with a large smile on her face.
Draco woke with a start, sitting straight up in bed, heart pounding out of his chest.  He blearily looked around his magically enlargened bed, and realized that Harry was not beside him anymore.
love you for you.  I love everything about you.  The good, the bad, and the saint-like,” he said, reciting part of his vows.
“Ron!  It’s okay!  You’re okay.  It was just a dream.”  Harry soothed his best friend, releasing his arms.
“110, 120, 130, 140, 145, 150.”  He stood in the bedroom doorframe, kicking his pants onto the floor of the room.  He looked up and almost came on the spot.
Going from store to store, by the time they met Ron at the Leaky Cauldron, Harry had gotten something for everyone that was left on his list, including a few more things for Teddy’s room at Grimmauld.
“Yeah, until it wasn’t.”  Harry sighed, running his hand through his hair.  Sitting there, he thought back on the past couple of weeks.  “We really had only been ‘a couple’ for two weeks,” he said, using air quotes.  “We had a great day, Saturday, finishing the kitchen, taking care of Teddy.  It was…yeah.  It was great.”  Harry could feel his cheeks heating up, trying to avoid looking at Ron.
“Let’s get some food, and then wonder the shops?  We need to start thinking of gifts for Christmas, I suppose.”
Harry had the sudden urge to push his fingers through the hair, admonishing himself just as quickly as the thought appeared.  He couldn’t help but staring, though.  The summer had done Malfoy well.  He had grown a couple more inches, but so had Harry; Malfoy now stood less than 2 inches taller than Harry.  The blond also seemed less pointy; his cheeks and chin were more rounded.  He still was a bit too thin, but Harry didn’t mind in the least.
He motioned for her to lead the way back upstairs as he said, “Kreacher seems to be liking his new space, too.  He cried when I put the elf heads up.  I even put a hook up near his door so he can hang the locket.”
Harry chuckled, shaking his head.  He levitated the plate of pancakes over to the table, and then carried the butter dish and some syrup over, sitting down in the same spot he had eaten dinner.  Draco did the same, and they helped Teddy cut up his food.
He hadn’t gotten a chance to show it to Ron and Hermione when they came for the tour before Draco’s attack, so he couldn’t wait to see Hermione’s face when he explained it that evening.
“How about… ‘He’s back! Harry is back after months away, and that means it’s time to celebrate!  When: Saturday, November 27
“No, I want you beside me, holding my hand.  If you aren’t holding my hand, I won’t be able to walk in the room.”  Draco sounded so sure, but Harry could feel the nerves radiating off of his body.
They tucked him in, and then he reached up both his hands, and Harry leant over to give him a hug and a kiss on the forehead.  Draco did the same, and retucked the blanket around him before turning off the light and stepping out in the hall.
His conversation with Ginny, while awkward, went really well.  He was absolutely petrified to tell her that the reason he didn’t want to get back together with her was because he realized that he preferred men to women.  He figured he would get his bits hexed off, but when Ginny just laughed a little and said she was planning on breaking it off with him, too, he relaxed.  She giggled a bit and informed him that while he was off doing whatever it was he did last year, she and Neville had gotten really close.  She didn’t know if it would lead to anything, but she wanted to try.  Harry was absolutely thrilled for his friends, and told Ginny as such.
Draco pressed quick kisses on Harry’s exposed neck, leading up his chin, and then to his mouth.  Harry instantly opened his mouth to allow Draco access.  They stood there, battling each other for dominance, and then finally separated, both breathing hard.
He gently stood, going into the en-suite to get a couple of wet flannels.  He came back in, cleaning off his face and chest, then washed Draco clean.
Hermione looked around the room, at the ceiling fan and other lights.  “Harry, this is amazing.  But, you said it’s a likeness?  What do you mean by that?”
Draco smiled as he picked up his wand and levitated the gifts.  He made them follow them to sitting room, where he carefully set them down under the tree.
Harry gave Draco a blank look.  Draco didn’t say anything, but just kept looking at him expectantly.
“Oh, Draco, the weather is unpredictable all year round.  In October, though, it will be cooler, the heat of the summer will have eased off.  It will be perfect.”
Harry slid into the booth at the back of the Leaky Cauldron, scooting over to sit next to Seamus, who had his arm around Dean and was whispering in his ear.
Draco pulled back after a few moments, resting his head back on Harry’s chest. They lay there for awhile, silently looking out the windows as tiny flecks of snow fell to the ground.
“We spoke at length of our relationship, and how much I loved you.  When I finally asked for their permission—I never expected the reaction I got.  Your mum jumped up from the table and pulled me into a hug,” he said, shaking his head, with a smile.  “Your dad quietly stood up from his chair.  My mind was going mad as he made his way to me.  I thought he was going to pull his wand on me when he reached into his robe pocket, but instead, he pulled out a small pouch.
“Why couldn’t you just tell me this?  I would have understood.  I would have tried to help in anyway I could.  Harry, I thought you were cheating on me.  I was considering divorce!  Why would you—”
Looking down at the letter, he saw his name in an elegant scrawl.  Turning it over and seeing the Malfoy seal, Harry grew widely confused.
It starts the morning after the end of Chapter 8.  POV's change back and forth between H & D throughout the chapter.
“Come on, you two, let’s go skate,” Harry said with a chuckle.  Draco quickly did up his skates, and the three of them waddled toward the opening.
“I like what you did with the room, by the way.  I love having a Christmas tree in here.”  He stopped next to the tree, taking a deep breath to smell the lovely pine scent.
“Nor I.  I completely forgot that Andy wanted me to watch Teddy for a few hours this morning.”  Harry peeked back into the room.  Draco did the same, seeing the two women sitting on the couch, holding hands, talking.
Once ready, they shrunk their bags and, after checking to make sure that they hadn’t left anything, they made their way down to the dining room for a quick breakfast before they checked out and met for their portkey home.
They looked at each other, smiling, and Harry couldn’t help but lean over and give him a quick kiss.  He saw the blush appear before he had leaned back.
“Uncle Harry!”  He leapt into Harry’s arms, who picked him up and carried him down to the kitchen, where Draco was making dinner.
“On holiday, my father would freeze the pond behind the Manor, and I would get to skate.  I spent a lot of time on the ice.”
It had taken them the better part of three months of working tirelessly, but by the beginning of October, Harry’s dream home was complete.  And this bathtub was his pride and joy.  When he was younger, he was always made to take showers; quick, cold showers, as Dudley had used all of the hot water with his baths.
“No, sir, those are not the Canary Creams.  Those are Jumping Snakes.  The Creams are on the third shelf.”
“Good morning, indeed.  Merlin, I’d like to wake up like that every day for the rest of time, if you please.”  He pulled him down into a deep kiss, tasting himself on his tongue.
“Nah, Kreacher only cooks when I ask him to.  When I’m there, I either go get something, or sometimes I cook myself something.”
Draco was still pacing the floor, hand running through his hair, mumbling words Harry couldn’t quite make out.
“That’s just it, though.  I know he’s changed.  I’ve seen it first hand, even more so than you lot.  I doubt his friends have even seen the Draco that I have gotten to know over the past few months.  He’s so open with me.  Or, well, he was.”  He sat down on the cot against the wall, sighing, before continuing..
Harry laughed.  “I know I’ll lose but seeing Ron’s face when I hand you money will be worth it.  How about one?”
Draco stood there a moment.  He looked at the ground, and then looked back up at Harry.  “Thank you.”  He thrust his hand out at Harry.
“No, thanks.  Andromeda is supposed to be dropping Teddy off in a couple of hours, and I want to get started on another room, so I'd best get back.”
Draco, seeming to be deep in thought, came to when Harry nudged him.  “Hmm?  Oh, nothing.  What do you have now?”
“No, we’re almost back to the resort,” he said, nodding towards the near distance, where they could see the stables where they had left from.
“It looks even more amazing than I could have ever dreamed!  She’s going to love it!  Thank you, sir!”  Ron was grinning from ear to ear.
They had been cordial at best since the blow up the first night back, and that morning was really the first time they had talked without the aid of Hermione.  It seemed that everyone thought Harry mad for trying to call a truce.  He didn’t care.  He knew they would all get into it again, and probably soon.  He just didn’t know how soon.
Yay!  Another chapter!  FINALLY!  Don't give up on me, people!  I know, I'm terrible, but I promise I will not abandon this.  It has been months since I've updated, but it's my Birthday week, so I figured I would share in the celebrating by posting a new chapter!
Harry walked up behind Draco, wrapping his arms around Draco’s stomach and leaning up on his toes in order to put his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry wished to kiss those soft lips again, but knew it would not be a good thing out on the street; who knew who might be around the corner.
“Was your wand in your pocket?” Harry turned back around to look at McGonagall, who had asked the question.
Flourish & Blotts was their next stop. The store owners were very good about keeping the Hogwarts texts right at the front, so it was very easy for the group to collect the needed books.  An idea occurred to Harry, though.
“Well, it appears that we weren’t followed last night.  Nothing at all about us eating out or getting engaged, or anything.  Thank Merlin for that.”
McGonagall stopped and turned to face Harry.  “Yes, Monday is agreeable to me.  I will meet you there, say, 9:00?”
“They were in here?  How in the here is that possible?”  He looked around, trying to see if there were any more lurkers.
Harry stood there staring at Draco’s face for a moment.  It seemed like his grey eyes were staring into the depths of Harry’s soul.  His pink lips were moist from the wine he had been drinking.  Harry felt his chest constrict.  There was something in the way Draco spoke that made Harry not even dream of lying.  “No,” he whispered, with a slight shake of his head.
“The Weaselette.”  Draco said, giving him a look that showed how absolutely dense Harry was.  “Don’t even know who you are dating, Potter?  My, how you get around.”
.  One of the men that was just arrested has pled guilty.  He gave a full statement, and declared how each of the other individuals were involved.  He also gave an account of possibly how you were able to get to Mr Potter’s door.”
“Yeah!  I’m going to do that wall, as well as those,” pointing to the ones on the left of the room.  “I am hoping to open up the space between this room and the room next to it, in order to make a master suite.  That way, I can have a large walk-in closet, and a bathroom.”  Harry picked up his notebook, and showed it to Draco.  “See?  This is my design.  Take those walls, open it up, put the bath there.  I think it will work, don’t you?”
He was going to go to Diagon Alley that morning to see how it was coming along.  He was hoping that it would be ready by the weekend, so he could pick it up on his way back to Hogwarts.
“Of course you did,” Draco mumbled.  “I’m ready for the days when he becomes a lazy teenager, and doesn’t wake up until noon.”
Draco moved the hand with the bowl to the side, stepping up against Harry and pulling him in close for a lingering kiss.  Harry nearly let go of the bowl, but was able to hold it steady as his other arm wrapped around Draco’s waist.
His thrusts grew in speed, and Harry’s insides started getting tighter as he prepared for his release.  Draco reaches between them and took Harry’s cock in his hand, squeezing and twisting it as he pummeled his prostate.
“No thank you, dear.  I have everything—” she flicked her wand at a pot that was boiling on the stove, “—under control.  I have to say though, that you have done an amazing job with this kitchen!  It’s incredible; if I didn’t know where I was, I wouldn’t have recognized it!”
Harry pulled him into a hug.  “You’re welcome.  For all of it.”  He sighed, pulling back, but keeping his hands on Draco’s arms.  “We all know what he’s like.  I’m just sorry you had to deal with it.”
A few years before, they had taken Teddy out to muggle London, visiting some tourist attractions and just introducing him to muggle life a bit.  They had talked with Andromeda, and had agreed that he needed to know all sides.
Hermione grinned at him as they stepped into the floo, yelling out ‘Leaky Cauldron’ as they swirled away in green flames.
Draco was perched on the edge of the tub, testing the water.  He had already stripped out of his clothes, as well.  He looked up at Harry when he heard the door open, and conjured a small table to sit the food and wine on, placing it beside the tub.
They talked a bit about the mission that Harry had been on, and then Draco regaled Harry with tales of the curses that Bill and Draco were chosen to break at the muggle Queen’s palace.
They walked across the hall into the sitting room.  Harry pulled the bowl of powder down from the mantle, holding it out for Draco.
Harry smiled and shook his head, before turning back to listen to Arthur and Ron’s argument about something ridiculous.
Smiling, Harry turned back.  “So, yeah, that's that.”  Draco squeezed his hand tight, before letting him go.  Harry turned and sat back down.
“Dra-co-ooh!”  Draco leaned back against the wall, thrusting up against Harry, causing him to drive hard against Draco.  “I’m not going—oh, fuck!”
“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.  Anyway, back to what we were talking about.  I’ve never actually stepped foot in the muggle world, but let me see…”  He started ticking off on his fingers, “Not being recognized on the street.  Not getting yelled at for having the Mark on my arm.  Not getting punched in the gut because of said Mark.  Not getting told that I don’t deserve to live.  Hmmm.  Yeah, I think I would be okay with not having to deal with all of that.”
Deciding it wouldn’t hurt anything, he quickly took a shower and then went to see who he would find in the Common Room.  Descending the spiral staircase, his ears were assaulted by a loud “HARRY!” and a blur of ginger and brunette heads were seen as Ginny and Hermione both launched themselves at him.  The three of them stood like that for a bit, until Ron came and wrapped his arms around them all.
Harry let out the breath he had been holding, said his farewells, and turned to go.  Draco caught his eye and winked, before turning back to the board to set up his pieces.
“Yeah.  He doesn’t know it, but I finished all the hard work on the sitting room a few weeks ago.  I just need to paint, which I will do tomorrow, but I’ve also been working on my bedroom.  I have cleared out most of the furniture in all of the rooms, putting it all in the attic, so now I need to go shopping for things.
Harry gripped his hand, pulling them both forward.  They walked down the aisle, looking at both sides to see their old classmates, all of the Weasley’s, friends from the ministry, including Beverly, Kingsley, and Robards, and people they hadn’t seen in what felt like years.
Harry continued crying, clutching onto Draco, hiding in his chest.  Draco just held him and rubbed his hand up and down Harry’s back.
It startled Harry to suddenly feel a tingling sensation in his pants.  “Show off,” he muttered with a smirk.
“Nope.  He keeps saying that he wants it to be perfect before we see it,” Ron said.  “But I want to see something messy and torn to bits.  I've never seen a full scale renovation project, and I think it would be fun.”
Draco nearly melted when Harry touched him.  He didn’t want to think about how touch-starved he was, but he knew that no one would ever make him feel as
Draco stood looking shocked at his mother and aunt.  The two women broke apart, wiping at their eyes, but still holding hands.  They both chuckled lightly, when they saw the state of themselves in the other’s eyes.  Narcissa took a step back, and motioned to Draco to come over.  He cautiously walked toward the women.  His mother grasped his hand, saying, “Dromeda, I don’t believe you’ve ever met your nephew, Draco.”  He was pulled into a hug, heart swelling.
Before he let his mind wander too far, he got up and carefully placed Teddy into the cot.  He cast the spell that Molly had taught him: a surveillance charm that creates two glowing yellow orbs.  They were floating in the air in front of Harry.  He placed one on the corner post of the cot.
“He’s in the spare bath, showering.  I’ve already had my turn, and I’ll be down in the kitchen when you’re finished.”
Inside were three beautiful Snitches. Each were snuggly sat in velvet, and had gold writing curved around the hole giving details about what each one did.
Pulling out his drawing pad, he looked again at his plans for the layout of the appliances.  He was excited that he had found a spell that he could use that would enable muggle appliances to work in the house.  When he had spoken with Professor McGonagall at the beginning of the term, she had told him about the possibility of using a combination of transfiguration spells and charms to create a likeness to electricity.  After some research, he was able to figure out the technicalities of it.  He had used it in all of the rooms that he had finished, and it was working brilliantly.
Draco smirked, twirling his finger to tell Harry to turn in a circle.  He hummed as Harry did, and he viewed the lovely curve of Harry’s arse in them.  “Extremely,” he said with a smile.  “You look almost good enough to eat when you wear those things.”
At 9:00 on the dot, he heard the fire flare up.  Walking down the stairs, he saw Ginny’s head peek around and see him walking towards her.
He felt the pleasure pooling in his sides, and decided to slow down and make this last a bit longer.
As he walked through the door, he was surprised to see that his mother wasn’t alone.  Across the table from her sat Professor McGonagall.  He stopped in his tracks as he took in the two women.
Professor Flitwick stepped up onto his stack of books, and started talking about what they were going to be doing that day.  “We have been working on silent spells for a while, but today we are going to be talking about silent
Harry didn't know what came over him, but he suddenly heard himself calling her back.   “Professor, I’m sure you’ll have to be here for the dinner with the students that stay, but if not, would you like to join us for Christmas dinner?  It'll be the Weasley’s, Andromeda and Teddy, Hermione and her parents.  I'd love to show you how your transfiguration lessons have been put to use,” Harry smiled.
Draco sat up, scratching the back of his neck, cheeks growing pink.  “I—I have to tell you something.”
“Beautiful bird, is he not?” asked the shopkeeper, walking up to Harry. “Wicked smart, too.  He’s about 12 weeks old.  Won't get but just a bit bigger.”
Draco laughed, lightly slapping Harry’s arm.  “Oh, posh.  Come on.  While it’s beautiful, it’s absolutely freezing!  Let’s go get checked in.”
Harry pulled back a moment.  He had a rush of hesitation as he thought about the fact that he had yet to go farther than just kissing with a man.  Looking into Draco’s eyes, he saw that they were dilated with lust.  He had never before seen that look on Draco’s face, but thought he had never seen anything so beautiful.  To think that it was for
Harry smiled as he watched Draco saunter up the staircase.  Godric, he loved that man.  He turned and went down to the kitchen.  He plated the sandwiches Molly had given him, and then found some grapes and cheese in the fridge.  He opened a bottle of wine, and grabbed two glasses.
Harry and Draco, hands gripped tightly together, wandered around the Great Hall, talking with their family and friends.
Harry chuckled as he rolled his eyes.  “Is that all I’m good for? My cock, culinary skills, and good looks?”
The next afternoon, they prepared for the next three days.  They each packed a bag, and then packed up the rest of the presents.  Draco was never more glad for magic than when he saw a stack of several dozen gifts, and with just a wave of his wand, they all shrunk and fit into a small sack.
“What?  No, I was on the bus, and then I was here.  The last thing I can recall is the foot being kicked into my stomach.  Nothing else.”
“I told her the more, the merrier.  I never had any issue with Nott, as he basically kept to himself.  Goyle is a different story, but I don’t think it will be a problem.”
Walking past the gate out onto the lane, Harry turned around, yelling, “Not making any promises!” before turning on the spot and apparating to Grimmauld.
“I think it will be fun, no matter who comes.  I invited George and Angelina, and I think Angelina was going to contact Alicia and Katie.  I have a feeling others will just show up, too.  We will just have to wait and see how many come, I guess.”
“YES! Right there!”  His cock jumped as the pleasure rushed through his body, emitting precum onto his stomach.
“You may use the floo in my office, if you wish,” Minerva said, stepping up to them.  “May be a bit easier with…” she nodded at Teddy, who had fallen asleep in Harry’s arms.
“Put me out of what? Apparating to Grimmauld?  I don't mind.  Seriously.  I got pretty good at side-arm in the last year,” he said with a slight grimace, thinking of their traversing across the country.  “Any time you want to, just let me know.”
Draco stood there for a moment, eyeing Harry up and down.  He stepped up to Harry, teasingly stroking his finger lightly across the waist band of his pants.  “Honestly?  I prefer you naked.”
“Actually, mother, Harry has asked me to accompany him to go furniture shopping for some of the rooms this afternoon.”
Draco apparated onto the top step of their stoop.  He was exhausted; showing the dignitaries around the market, making sure all last-minute things were completed, and then overseeing the first crowd of patrons make their way towards the field was tiresome work.  At least he had the next two days off.
With that, he used his wand to gently raise Dumbledore’s arm just enough to be able to place the Elder wand underneath it.  Taking a step back, he realized that this was not ever how he imagined this all would end.   He shook himself, and then turned to Ron and Hermione.
They had been back for about four weeks when Seamus came back from the weekend sporting a huge grin.  Receiving several curious looks and inquisitions, he pulled out a bottle of Ogden’s finest, and declared that Thursday night, they were going to have a party.  Hermione was adamantly against it to start with, but she was worn down quickly.  They didn't know how they had gotten away with it for so long, but no one was complaining.
“You’re welcome, but, that’s not what I’m talking about.”  Seeing the serious look in the grey eyes, Harry placed his silverware on his plate and crossed his arms on the table.
At that moment, they heard loud voices coming up behind them.  Harry turned to see who it was, and saw that Ron, Hermione, and Neville were coming towards them.
Receiving a ‘thank you’ Harry nodded to Draco and went back down the stairs to the landing.  He walked into his bedroom, picking up his tea cup and the notebook that had his floorplan on it.  He sat on the floor, and started sketching again, talking quietly to himself.  Coming up with a plan that he could live with, he decided first that he needed to pull up the carpet.  Walking over to a corner, he pulled out his wand and cast a spell that lifted the edge.  Getting it pulled up enough that he could grab it, he started manually rolling it up.
They smiled at her, and together they walked towards the large double doors.  Draco nodded to her, and she turned and with a flick of her wand, the doors opened.  They looked at each other once more, Draco gripping Harry’s fingers more tightly, and they followed her through the doors.
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Whatever you say.  But, what plan?  They are going to come over, we will give them a tour of the house and show them our magnificent work, and then we will eat.  I am afraid that I don’t think this will be done in time, though, so we will have to go get takeaway or something.”
“No worries, mate.  I’m going to send Draco on home, though.  I’ll send him through one of the emergency floo’s.  Here, I’ll let him talk to you.”
“I didn’t know you had done that, is all.  You never told me about it.  I never even gave it a second thought.  Impressive, Potter,” he said with a smirk.
They passed the Quidditch pitch, and a tonne of memories flooded Harry’s mind.  He saw Hagrid’s hut in the distance, and hoped he would get to see him before the day was done.
"Me, too.  Ooh, yes!  Definitely have wanted you for a while now," Draco gasped, pushing his hips towards Harry.
Standing on the landing, he perked his ear, listening for any noises in the house.  He heard a light shuffle upstairs, so he cast a Muffliato on his feet, and slowly made his way up the staircase.
“McGonagall said that the man told the Aurors that my pocket seemed to glow white, a bright light formed, and then I suddenly disappeared.
They had reached the front of Grimmauld, and so made their way up the steps to the door.  Harry held up his hand, and upon hearing a click, opened the door.  He let Draco go first, then followed, locking the door behind them.
“I’ve used it in all of the rooms that have been completed.  I’ve used muggle switches and sockets in every room, too.”
Standing, Harry bent over to check the price tag.  It was just about what he had expected to spend, so he decided that it would be perfect.  Draco had stood, too, leaning over to see what Harry was looking at.
Draco and Harry again looked at each other, trying to remember such events.  Harry turned and looked at their professor, saying, “A few times, when we shook hands, or nudged up against each other, there was a warmth in that extremity, but not as intense as the first time.”
They were right.  It was barely dawn when a gangly ten-year-old jumped into the middle of their bed.
Harry just smiled at her, walking over and giving her a hug.  “It’s no worry, at all.  We just wanted to tell you that we are going to be going out to muggle London to get the kitchen appliances.  I have a few diapers in Teddy’s room, but didn’t know if you had packed—”
Draco tugged Harry’s hand, pulling him towards the doorway into the kitchen.  He let go and motioned for Harry to stop.  He stepped on through, with a smile on his face.
“Yes!  I’m due some time off, and I’ve only been down to the Market a handful of times, and that included our date the other night.  I’ll have to double check with Cloudfoot and Drumpkin, but I don’t see why I couldn’t!  When were you thinking?  Where are we going?  What’s the weather like?  Is it tropical?  I have so much to do!”
Harry just smiled at him as he picked up the play broom that they had bought for Hugo.  “Which one for the Granger-Weasley’s?”
Draco looked at him like he was crazy, but then deflated and moved to straddle his lap.  “Of course I did.  I missed you every second, of every minute, of every hour you were gone.  I was terrified you wouldn’t come back.”
“Well, Mr Malfoy.  Glad to see you’re awake.  You gave us quite the scare, you know.  Here, drink this Skele-Gro.
Draco sighed as he stared at the spot the man had just disappeared from.  “I’m afraid so.  I knew this day was too good to be true.”  He leant his head against Harry’s, closing his eyes and mentally preparing for the shit storm that was in their near future.
Harry lifted Draco’s hand to his mouth and kissed it.  “I know, me too.  I had to go to Mungo’s for my quarterly checkup back in August and saw a flier while waiting on the healer.  I pocketed it and kept it in my desk drawer for about three weeks before I read it.”
I AM SO SORRY THAT IT'S BEEN SO LONG! RL has been...yeah.  New job, quick promotion, lots more duties with said promotion.  It's been a wild ride!
Harry sighed, sitting up as well before saying, “Our portkey is set to leave at 7:00, but I have to be there around 6:45 to finish signing the international transportation papers.”
Smiling, Harry turned around to see a smirk on Ron’s face.  Sending a glare his way, Harry let Orion out the window, and finished grabbing his things for the weekend.
Yet again, Draco could feel tears forming behind his eyes.  This was normal.  This was his Harry.  He stepped into the room and said a quiet, “I’m home.”
“I had no idea,” Draco whispered, looking at the ground.  “My mother and her haven’t spoken since long before I was born.  I’ve never met her, but I have heard a few stories of her.  I knew I had a cousin, but was never allowed to speak about her when I was younger, and she had already graduated from Hogwarts before we started.”
At that moment, Teddy gurgled and then started crying.  Andromeda tutted and reached for the baby.  Giving him a kiss on his head, Harry handed Teddy over to his grandmother.  “It’s his nap time.  I’m sorry for the timing.”
Kreacher came and took their dirty laundry, and they unpacked and laid out all of the gift that they had purchased on their trip.  Draco summoned the rest that he had hidden (sans Harry’s) and placed them with the rest.  He then brought out the beautiful wrapping paper he had bought on his last trip to Diagon, and showed Harry.
Harry watched as Draco started towards the stairs back down to the floo.  He felt his stomach clench as he watched Draco walk away from hm, again.  Surprising himself, he suddenly lurched off the wall and quickly walked towards Draco.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the door move.  He immediately turned to stare back towards the door, and his heart leapt to his throat when the most gorgeous person on the planet walked in the door… followed by someone he hoped to never, ever see again.  His heart plummeted to the floor.
Once she was gone, they went through the house and turned out the lights, making their way to their room.
Harry sighed as he opened one of the letters on top.  He quickly read it, passing it over to Draco with a smile.  “They’re not all bad.”
“And why, pray tell, are you watching the telly?”  He takes a deep breath, trying to rein in his anger.  “We are supposed to be at The Burrow in fifteen minutes!”
“Nah, how would you?  We’ve managed to keep it out of the papers, thankfully.  My life is always the talk of the nation, so we tried to keep it silent.”
“Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you all for coming a few days before the rest of the student body.  I wanted to get you acquainted with the way things are going to go for you all this year, as well as get you to help with the last few finishing touches of the castle’s renovations.
Harry looked over at Draco as he picked Teddy up, and they walked back over to where Andromeda stood talking with Molly.
Harry didn’t know if he wanted to be spotted or not, and was turning to hurry into a store and basically hide, when his eyes were caught by the pair of grey ones belonging to the blond.  He couldn’t quite make out the look on Malfoy’s face, but it didn’t seem to be of disgust as he was used to coming from the man.
Harry didn’t answer, and tried to move around them, but they followed right behind them, continuing to ask questions and take pictures of them.  They managed to lose them when they walked into the dark and dank store.
“I’m sorry,” she said.  “I realize that I may have gone a bit mad, but I wanted your wedding day to be perfect.”
Draco stopped halfway up the staircase, turning slowly to face Harry, infamous Malfoy sneer on his face.  “What, Potter?  What do you want? I'm a very busy person.”
“You—you haven’t looked at nor touched me in months.  You haven’t really spoken to me in months.  You leave for hours at a time, and then come back even more quiet than before.  You don’t want to go with me to events.  Are you cheating on me?”  His throat felt tight as he looked up at the emerald eyes he had loved since they were in school.
She huffed, but kept up with his quick pace, stiletto heels squishing into the plush carpet.  He didn’t know how in Merlin’s name she was able to keep steady, but she was now a pro at it.
His hardened cock was straining in his pyjamas, but he ignored it.  He felt absolutely ridiculous.  He didn’t
After the people left, happy with their purchases, a young woman who looked just a couple years older than them walked out of the office in the back, and took over the register.  Ron turned to go through the door leading to the office, but caught sight of the pair watching him.
“Draco, I can’t do this right now.  I have to get Teddy fed and I need to prepare for the party.  I—I just—”
“So grown up! And look at your beautiful grown-up dress!”  He stepped farther into the room, spinning her around so her dress skirt flowed out from her body a little. She giggled, holding onto his neck as he asked, “And where’s your brother?”
Draco played with his fingers a moment, flexing them back, before looking up into Harry’s eyes and saying, “Do you still hate me?”
“Great.  Then we’ll be off.”  He shrunk the bag again, placing it in his pocket.  “You two can stay as long as you wish.  Kreacher will gladly get you anything you desire, as well.”  He turned to Narcissa.  “And the attic door is unlocked, so you can come and go as you please.”
“I think it’s brilliant.  When is your office Christmas party, so I can give Bev a kiss?  I… if we do this, then we can literally do it whenever.  Forget May or June.  If we’re going to do this, why not Christmas Eve?”
“We had one until we were so rudely interrupted,” Draco said, turning his head to look at the doorway.  His eyes widened when he realized it wasn’t just Ron who was watching them.
Harry had always loved the way the Weasley’s tree was covered in bright colours and things that the kids had done when they were younger, and so he had bought the brightest ornaments he could find.  He had gotten both muggle and magical ornaments, too.  He stood back and admired the tree, stepping forward to say hello to the fairies that flitted around it.
“Yeah, that’d be great,” Ron said with a wide grin.  He looked over at Harry, who just stood bewildered by the exchange.  It appeared as if Ron had gotten over his fear of muggles.
Harry pulled Draco to straddle his lap, and they spent the next several minutes snogging like teenagers.
The foursome sat in contemplative silence for a beat, before McGonagall changed the subject, saying, “Well, Harry, from what I can see here, I am very impressed by your renovating skills.”  She swept her eyes across the sitting room.
She smiled at him, giving him a wink.  “You’re very welcome.  Trust me, I completely understand how you are feeling.”
“After three days of continual curse breaking, Bill decided to take a tour of the palace.  It was breathtaking.  So many rooms, such beautiful furnishings and paintings.  We went through the muggle gift shop, and when I saw this, I just had to get it.  It’s silly, and I have no idea why it made me think of you, but it did.”
“What time is it?” Harry asked, yawning and rubbing his eyes.  It was still dark in their room.  He reached for his glasses, and after sticking them on his nose, looked over at the clock on his side table.  He groaned as he saw that it was only 6:20am.
The next morning, Boxing Day, was filled with more laughter, more food, and more fun.  The kids dragged Draco out to play in the snow with them, and they ended up making a large fort, where they set up a supply of snowballs.
“HALF-BREED SCUM!  BLOOD TRAITOR!  DIRTY FREAKS!  GET OUT!  GET OUT OF THE HONOURABLE HOUSE OF BLACK!”
Harry looked up from where he had been trying to sneak a quick snog in.  “Those are muggle fairy lights.”
They went up and paid for it, and when the man asked them how they wanted to get the furniture, Draco shot Harry a look and proceeded to say “We’re going to pick it up.”  Harry didn’t know how that was going to be possible, but he just went along with it.  The man told them that there was a door on the side of the building, and that a man named Charles would be there to help them load it up.
“Okay, Harry.  We’re going to take the blindfold off.  We’ve still a way to go to be out of the cold, but you’ll understand when it comes off.”
Walking over to the door, he put his hand up to unlock it.  Hermione had taught him a spell so that the door would unlock and lock with just the touch of his hand.  He felt so much safer with all of the wards, the Fidelius charm, and all of the other spells that were put on the house when he moved back in.  No one he didn’t want to see was getting in.
He moaned, causing Draco to thrust again as the vibrations caused sparks of pleasure to spread throughout his body.  His breath hitched as he felt his orgasm build up.  Harry pulled off, licking up the vein and taking him back in, sucking him in deep.
Draco stopped mid-step, turning to look at her.  “Really?  Today?  But it’s already mid November!  I just figured they’d wait until next year, in order to get more publicising done.”
Harry was still laying in the middle of the couch, biscuit still in his hand.  Draco could feel his face redden in anger more by the second.  Seriously, love-of-his-life or not, he was going to kill him.
“Inside the pouch was a ring.  He handed it over to me and said that he gave his permission and blessings on the condition that I take the diamond out of your grandfather’s Malfoy family ring, and use it in your engagement ring.
Harry lifted his hand to touch Draco’s chin, turning it so that he could look at the pale face. Draco wrenched his face from Harry’s hand, though.
“Harry, what have I told you?  You don’t need to ask to come see him.  Come on through.  I’ll make some tea.”
Draco turned even redder as Harry shuffled forward and lifted his legs so that he could see Draco’s hole and the large black plug that was snugly fit in it.  He groaned loudly as Harry flopped onto his stomach, face resting inches from Draco’s hole.
“Don’t worry when I fight with you. Worry when I stop, because it means there’s nothing left for us to fight for.”
He turned and went up the stairs to their bedroom.  He returned less than ten minutes later, Harry still in the same spot.
“Right here,” Andromeda said, walking into the room with her hands full of coats, hats, and gloves.  “Thank you for taking him.  I’ve got some shopping to do, and little eyes can’t see what I’m getting,” she said glancing down at Teddy, who had a wide grin on his face.
“Good. I'm glad we’re all on the same page,” Blaise said with a smirk.  “And tell us if he ever does something stupid like that again. I'd love to be able to knock some sense into that blond head of his!”
Harry’s face was completely red from exertion.  He knew he had been yelling quite loudly towards the end of that speech, but he didn’t care, either.  He had to make them see that they had to stick together in the aftermath of such tragedy.  He gave them a look, then said a bit calmer, “How are you not tired of all the hate?  I know I am.  It has seeped into my soul, and I just don’t want it to be a part of me anymore.  I’m done.  We need to stick together; if we continue with this ‘us and them’ nonsense, what’s to stop someone else from becoming a new Voldemort?”  He then turned and walked swiftly out of the door.
“And we love you, Ted.  So much.”  Harry ruffled his hair, swallowing the lump in his throat.  “Okay, which two presents do you want to open now?  Everyone will be here in a couple of hours, so you won’t have to wait too long to open the rest.”
Stepping out into the hall, Harry flicked his wand, sending the many bags that Andromeda had brought up to Teddy’s room as he walked across to the lounge.  He pulled the soft blanket that Andromeda had given him for Christmas off of the back of the couch, sitting down in the recliner.
Draco scoffed as he looked down at the picture, which was of the Gryffindor vs Slytherin quidditch match in second year. He could see Harry keeping his broken arm carefully tucked into his side, baring down on an unmoving Malfoy, hanging in the air.
Harry started speaking before he even knew what words were coming out of his mouth.  “You’re so beautiful, Draco.  I want to take you apart piece by piece, and then put you back together again.  Can I do that?”
Draco nodded into Harry’s shoulder, curling his arm tighter around Harry’s torso.  Harry felt a warm puff of air on his shoulder, and smiled.
“I was secretly hoping that people would just let us be.  Blind optimism, I suppose.  I don’t really want to know what those say.  I know what people think of me.”
The man at the end of the table, who had been nearly silent the entire time he had been sitting there, suddenly stood up, knocking his chair over.  “Draco, may I speak to you?”  Draco raised his brow.  “In private.”
“Professor, wait.”  Harry had stood, walking towards her.  “Would you be willing to accompany me to Ollivander’s on Monday?  You know more about what the ministry said.”
As they entered Harry’s room, Draco latched his lips back onto Harry’s.  Harry kicked the door shut, moving their bodies toward the bed.  They released each other as they kicked off their shoes and fell onto the bed.  They moved so that their heads were on the pillows.  Harry leaned in again, giving Draco a chaste kiss.
As he was speaking, Draco began pacing up and down the hall, his hands sliding through his hair in a continuous manner.
He took a deep breath as the doors shut behind them, and the reporters were shut out of the proceedings.  Well, almost all of the reporters; after a sweep of the room, Harry noticed that none other than Rita Skeeter was sitting up in the risors, Quick Quotes Quill and pad of paper floating in front of her, scribbling away.  He refused to give her the time of day as Draco’s solicitor walked up to talk to them.
Harry sat down on the couch beside him, kissing him on the cheek.  “I really do appreciate the effort.”
“Oh. Well, yes, it does bring up some bad memories, but at the same time, it makes me remember better times, too. We did have some great times. Before Hogwarts, even. I know every thinks they were just my ‘minions’ or my ‘bodyguards,’ but they were my best friends for years.”
Draco snorted, trying to stifle a laugh.  The grin on Harry’s face grew as the two men made their way around the rest of the lake, making small talk.  As they walked back into the castle, the smell of food reminded them it was lunch time, so they walked into the Great Hall.  There were only a few others eating, so they made their way to their table and sat at the end, facing each other.
Draco shifted, pulling back.  Harry whined as he opened his eyes and reached for him.  “Where are you going?”
She stood, giving Harry a hug and a kiss on the cheek, and then walked over to Draco.  He stood up, giving Teddy a peck on his forehead, handing him over to his aunt.
“Is that right?”  Draco nodded with a sultry look in his eyes.  “Well, in that case, let me change, and tell me why everyone is here.”
The room was unbelievably cozy, with plush chairs and couches a deep grey colour scattered around the room and surrounding the fire place on the right side.  The curtains surrounding the wall of windows on the left were a sheer white.  The carpets seemed to be woven with the colors of the different houses.  Several tables and chairs filled the back half of the room, with a large bookcase full of books sitting against the back wall.  The rest of the walls had paintings and tapestries across them.  Two doors could be seen half-way, leading to what Harry presumed were the dorms.
Had someone told him a year ago that he would be dating Harry Potter, and spending a pleasant evening with the Golden Trio, he would have laughed in their face and jinxed them. Now, though? He wouldn’t trade this for anything in the world.
He stepped in front of the mirror, which wolf-whistled at him, making him grin.  “Thanks.”  He ran his fingers through his hair, knowing that was all he could do with it, and then grabbed his wand and cloak, before making his way down to the kitchen.
Harry, who was just finishing up his last Charms assignment, thought that once he was done, he would go down and send a letter to Molly.
“Darling, I had to.  It is booked years in advance.  We were lucky that the Brocklehurst girl decided she wanted more time before settling down.  It’s perfect.  Harry, look at this.  Tell him that I had to get it while I could.”
“Harry, do you vow to hold your love as a love everlasting?  Do you vow to cherish and share in everything, to carry Draco, and be carried by him, through the adventures of life?”
Draco glared up at him.  “What was it you said?  Now that you have my arse in your bed, you weren’t going to let me leave it?  Well, it works the other way around, too.  Now that I’m in your bed, you’re stuck with me; I'm not going anywhere.”
“That’s what I’m here for, to make sure you don’t fall on your beautiful arse,” Harry said.  He leaned in closer to Draco, whispering, “It being bruised would detract from its beauty.”
At this part, Draco cut in.  “It truly felt as if Fiendfyre was burning me.  Harry was still gripping my wand, but after he was able to release it, the pain diminished.  I then tried doing an array of spells, and it was working fine; it was mine again.  I haven’t had any issues with it, since.”
Madam Pomfrey turned and walked back towards her office, which left just Narcissa and Harry standing by the bed.  Harry conjured Narcissa a seat, as he walked back around to the other side of the bed and sat back into the chair he had previously deserted.
The tunnel had lights in it, so they weren’t in pitch black, but it was still a little unnerving.  It wasn’t too long, though, and they quickly were back in the daylight again.  Just a few meters past, the sleigh turned down another path, which caused them both to smile.
After talking with Mr. Ollivander after the war, he had figured out a way to give the wand back so that Malfoy had full control of his own wand, without being able to control Harry’s phoenix wand and the Elder wand.  Harry didn’t care so much about the phoenix wand; he was more worried about the Elder wand.  He wanted to make sure that he was the last master of that wand.  Wand lore was such a confusing subject, but it was interesting, and he liked knowing a bit more about it than Hermione.
“Agreed,” Harry said.  “Let’s go to the apothecary, first.”  With that, they all walked back up the alley.  Harry could see the store just ahead of them, but they were suddenly assaulted when a camera being stuck in Harry’s face.  A reporter, quill and parchment at the ready, started asking Harry questions.
Bounding down the stairs, he yelled, “Just a sec!”  He walked quickly into the room to see Draco’s head in the fireplace.  Sitting on his knees in front of it, he said, “Hey! Wasn’t expecting to hear from you so soon!”
She blinked at him a couple of times before her face cleared and her grin lit up her face once again.  “It will be in the evening edition of The Prophet.”
Draco gave him another look, but Harry just winked and picked up one of the trays of drinks, walking back towards their friends.
“Okay!”  Teddy jumped up and down, and Harry pulled out a few more strands of lights.  They walked back outside, and Harry showed Teddy how to hang them up.  With the thick snow, it was hard work, but once they were around the building, it was worth it to see the look on Teddy’s face.
They both grinned as Harry turned back and said, “Sod off, all of you!” Harry rolled his eyes as he looked back at Draco, who was flipping the V’s to Blaise and Pansy, who were smirking at them.
“Yeah.  Ginny just told mum and dad about her and Neville.”  Seeing Harry’s wide eyed expression at that news, Ron continued.  “I know!  They’ve been together since, what?  The middle of June?  I mean, come on!  She was practically sitting in his lap at your birthday party.  I think Gin wanted to give them a bit of time to get over, well, you, but I assumed they would have figured it out before now.  Anyway, why did you run off earlier?”
“I just need to go down to the kitchen to get my money bag, and then I’ll be ready.  Would you like to see it?  I finished it the other day.”
“Oh, I don’t know, how about the fact this it’s in his genes?  Not only was he raised with the help of you, Mr ‘Trouble Always Finds Me No Matter What’, but his father was 1/4th of the most notorious mischief makers Hogwarts has ever seen!”
“It’s not a normal case, though,” Draco argued.  “We won’t be able to talk or text on the mobile.  Hell, we won't even be able to owl.  I won’t know that you’re alright.  It could be months, maybe even years until—”  He broke off, taking a deep breath, trying to keep the tears at bay.
A few minutes later, Ron and Hermione came in.  Seeing Harry seated near Draco, Ron made to walk to the other end of the table.  Hermione sent Harry a pleading look, but he just shook his head and looked back at his plate.  He did not feel like getting into it again with Ron.
Harry did a quick glance around the room and then gently leaned in and gave Draco a soft kiss on the lips, before turning towards the back of the wing.
Draco smiled before taking Harry’s hand and leading him down the stairs. “No, you don’t have to cook. Ronald—okay fine! Ron—found a little restaurant when he was getting Hermione’s Christmas present…? Does that make sense to you? He said that is smelled amazing, and has been wanting to try it, so they are going to get an array of food, and bring it back here.”
Harry received the famous Malfoy smirk.  “You apparently think too highly of me if you don't understand how hard I work to not spout off something at Weasley.  He says something that leaves it wide open for an insult or a barb!  I’m trying, for you, you know, to not start a fight.  But, over seven years of the fighting mentality doesn't just go away over-night.”
“As far as I know, yes.  I remember curling in a fetal position as I was kicked, trying to block the pain.  I remember feeling like my vision was beginning to black out, and I…”  He sighed, shaking his head and avoiding looking at the women across the table from them.  Even though they already knew this part of the story, it was still embarrassing.  “I called out for Harry just before I passed out, and the next thing I knew, I was in the hospital wing at Hogwarts.”
Draco gave Harry a quick smirk before he moved up and captured Harry’s lips with his own.  Harry instantly reciprocated, pulling one hand up into Draco’s hair, moving the other down to cup his arse, causing their groins to smash together.  Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth.  Harry moved his hand up under Draco’s shirt, scratching lightly up and down the pale skin.  This caused Draco to moan even louder.
Draco smirked at him as Harry stood up, stretching his arms up above his head.  He noticed Draco glance down and knew that his shirt had rode up just a bit above the waist of his pajamas.
They walked into the room, stepping over to the fireplace.  Harry pulled down the bowl of powder, holding it out to Draco.  Draco took a small handful, kissed Harry once more, said goodnight, and then disappeared in a flash of green flames.
He looked down at Draco’s face.  His eyes were open, feasting on Harry’s face as he continued to thrust into him.
“Not possible!” Draco called out as he, too, came undone, spilling all over Harry’s hand, stomach, and chest.  “I love you so damn much!”
Harry sighed, as he wondered the same thing for the thousandth time in the past few days.  “I haven’t heard anything from him.  I…honestly don’t know if I want him to show or not.”
“When I pulled the carpet up, the wood was underneath, so I sanded it down, and put this lovely stain on it.  I decided that the plain brick fireplace was too boring, so I completely took it apart, and made it sandstone.  My favorite part, though, is the windows.”
Hermione gasped as she took in the immaculate appliances and sinks.  Harry had put in an island, which had seating around it, perfect for morning coffee.
“I know.  I understand why, but it still doesn’t seem fair.  Maybe we can get enough to play pick-up games, though,” Harry replied.
Harry looked up at Draco, giving him a quizzical look, only to receive a pursed look in return.  It took Harry a few seconds, but then it hit him full force.
“I give up,” Hermione said with a roll of her eyes, throwing her hands in the air.  “So, what is for supper?  I’m hungry.”
This wasn’t the first time he had a dream starring Draco, but this one definitely went farther than any of the others had.  Since spending time with the man, Harry had realized just how attractive Draco was.  They had become good friends as of late, and Draco was helping him renovate his house; they made a really great team.  It was strange to think that just a few months ago, Harry had absolutely despised the man, and now was having wet dreams of him.  He didn’t know quite what to make of it.  There was a lot of history between the two of them, and not very much of it was good.
Harry looked back over at the owl, which was helping himself to the rest of the contents of Harry’s plate.  He hadn’t even thought about Sirius’s middle name.  Of course, that was absolutely fitting.  How had Draco—.
Harry still could not believe the amount of people that had shown up for his Birthday.  Kingsley Shacklebolt was the one that really shocked him.  All of the Weasley’s were in attendance, as well as a few of their significant others.  Harry was pleased to see that Angelina Johnson was sitting next to George, holding his hand.  He’d have to ask Ron about that one later.  Even Professor McGonagall had made an appearance, briefly.  She said she couldn’t stay long, as there were crews working around the clock fixing Hogwarts so that the castle would be ready for the start of term on September 1
Harry led the two Malfoy’s up the stairs to the top landing.  Tapping his wand on a wall, a door formed that led to the attic.  The trio made their way up the narrow stairs to a large space that covered the entirety of the house.  There was a main path starting at the stairs and making its way across the room, but there were also smaller paths that branched off so that it was possible to get to items that were against the eaves of the roof.
Draco just leaned in and kissed his temple before pulling back and sliding back up the bed.  He picked up the journal that Harry had handed him and placed it on the bedside table, before moving over and patting the space beside him.
Draco didn't hear the end of their conversation, as at that moment they had all walked back into the dining room where everyone in attendance had gathered.
That made everyone start laughing, lifting the atmosphere.  Ginny jabbed Harry in the stomach with her elbow, which made him laugh louder, and Neville’s face became as red as a tomato.
Harry was awoken again a couple of hours later by Kreacher apparating into his room to tell him Draco had arrived.  Looking over at the clock again, he saw that Draco was early.
Leaning back against the couch, again, Harry was waiting for the sputtering answer from Neville, when he suddenly felt a brush against his hair.  For a second, he thought maybe it had caught on a fiber, but then he felt it again.
Draco smirked at him as he left the room to head downstairs.  Harry could have sworn, though, that he faintly heard a “I guess we’ll find out.”
Opening the letter, Harry was surprised to see that it was from Pansy.  Reading from the top, Harry felt his eyes growing wider and his brow getting higher.
“All of this to say, I knew you both would want your families and friends to be here for this special moment.”
“If I told you, it would give away the surprise.  McGonagall is in on it, so you know it's nothing bad, ‘Mione.  I've got to go, or I'll be late!” He gave her a side hug, and then quickly walked out of the hall, through the entry, and out into the beautiful September weather.
“You have a one track mind, I swear,” he replied with a shake of his head.  He gave Harry a little spank.  “But then, so have I.  Come on, sexy.  Let’s go wrap some presents.”
The moved to stand in front of the room, and everyone quieted down when they realized Harry was going to say something.
“I don’t know.”  They both turned as they heard the shower turn off.  “Guess I’d better go.  We’ll see you later.  Wish him luck for me, will ya?”
Harry was just about to turn and apparate away, when a thought hit him square in his chest.   He said goodbye to his bewildered friends, and sprinted back up the street.
“So, yeah, that’s my sad little story.  Let’s get back to work.”  Harry stood back up, pushing the chair back in and placing another plate onto the table.
“I’m glad you all like them.  There are tons more, too.  I asked Dennis if I could have more, and he told me to take as many as I wanted.  He is going to bring them by next week, so if any of you want to, I’ll let you know when he comes over.”
Draco nodded, but Harry felt him stiffen beside him.  He squeezed his slackened hand, and received a quick squeeze in response.
He was half-way down the stairs when he heard a loud laugh coming from the dining room.  He paused a moment as he took in the sound; he would know Harry’s laugh anywhere.  If he wanted to admit it to himself, he had always loved Harry’s laugh.  It was a deep, guttural sound, seemingly emitting from the man’s very soul.
Draco laughed, pointing forward.  “This way, come on.”  He started walking towards the back part of the field, Teddy right beside him asking continuous questions, and Harry trailing behind them.  When they made it to the rink, they all gasped in unison.
They looked at each other, smiling.  Harry went over to the wizard that was working the booth, asking about the tree.  Draco stood back, admiring the tree, and imagining it set up in the sitting room, with the ornaments that Harry had purchased his first Christmas at Grimmauld, and the ones that Draco had acquired the past few months in the hope that Harry would be back home in time for the Holiday.
Draco took a step back, taking in Harry’s attire.  “Hmm, I love this shirt on you,” he said, running his hand down Harry’s chest.
Harry cast a quick look over at the clock on his bedside table and found that it was only 7:30.  Harry groaned and turned back over, curling into his pillow, deciding he deserved a couple more hours sleep.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh.  “I told you!  I don’t know how he did it!  There were several pictures that were of random witches and wizards in Diagon, so I figure he was just taking pictures randomly.”
Harry pulled a piece of parchment out of his shopping bags, and wrote down the address.  “Um, please memorize this, and then I can destroy it.  I have a Fidelius charm on the house.”
All eyes from their table were swinging back and forth between the two men standing and Harry, who had slid his wand out of his holster and was gripping it in his hand under the table, just waiting for something to happen.
It was about 10:15 when Draco stepped out of the floo.  He initially didn’t want to come, fearing his presence would cause strife, but he decided that his desire to talk to Harry again overrode the fear.
“Too true.”  Draco chuckled as he opened the gift, handing the paper to Harry and turning over a book.  He gasped and looked over at Ron and Hermione.  “Are you serious?”
Teddy perked up at the mention of Christmas.  “Uh huh!  I can’t wait to give Nana the gift that we bought at Diagon Alley!  And I made you both something at school!”
Smiling as his friend’s back disappeared from view, Harry turned and faced Draco.  “What are your plans for the weekend?”
He had gotten to the third floor when he heard the floo.  He immediately turned and went back down the stairs, stepping into the sitting room to see Bill and Fleur.
They both chuckled lightly as they finished eating.  Once they were done, Draco stood, taking his and Harry’s empty plates and placing them in the sink.  “Well, guess I’d better go, have to be in Norfolk in an hour.  Must go and change.”
“It’s just, we’ve been engaged for not even three weeks, and my mother is making me want to just call it all off!”  He saw the look on Harry’s face, and waved him off.  “No, not really, but I just wish that we could get it into her head that we are going to do it our way.”
“What’s wrong, Ted?”  Harry removed the spell around Teddy and picked him up, getting a whiff of something foul.  “Ah!  Got it.  Come on, let’s get you cleaned up, yeah?”
“Do you remember our very first day at Hogwarts, when you refused to shake my hand?  That was the day that I decided to make your life hell.”  Draco looked down at the table.  “The great Harry Potter didn’t want to be friends with
“Great!” Draco sat down in the chair.  ”So, what did Weasley do?”  Draco asked, pulling his supplies out of his bag, spreading them before him.  Harry started to do the same, but suddenly became distracted by Draco’s hands.
He had been staring at the man before him for a little more than an hour now; he knew he should probably get some sleep, but was determined to commit every feature of the man’s face to memory, lest he forget something.
“That much I had gathered, smart-arse.  What I’m saying is, how are we both supposed to get on this thing without falling?”
She looked up from her own stack of files, and gave him a smile.  “Have a good evening, sir.”  He rolled his eyes; she was always the first person in in the morning, and the last one out in the evening.
“But, not even six months ago, I hated him with every fibre of my being.  How is it possible that we have gotten to this point so fast??”  Harry started pacing again.  “No, really.  How is it possible to go from hating someone so much that you literally nearly kill them, to saving each other’s lives on multiple occasions during the next year, then suddenly become friends and then start to fall—”  He stopped himself when he realised what he was about to say.
3.  Thank you to everyone that has reviewed and commented.  Even though I didn't get to respond to some of them, I read them all and took them to heart, as well.  Thank you, again.
Draco cupped his hands, lifting some water up to Harry’s shoulders, where he started massaging him.  Harry moaned as Draco’s thumbs pressed into his stiff muscles.
They soon were walking along the River Thames, eating cannolis.  The city was beautiful this time of year, decorated for Christmas and a little bit of snow on the ground.
The next week flew by in a blur of amazing food, wonderful sights, and great shopping.  Before they knew it, it was their last full day at the resort; they would be leaving shortly after breakfast the next day.
Harry followed the woman around the desk she was seated at, and through a doorway on the left.  She walked down a long hallway that was covered in portraits of different people, all staring at Harry and then whispering to each other, some moving through the frames, following him down the hall.  Finally, she led him to a room on the left side.
“How are we going to get this stuff back to Grimmauld?  I don’t have a car.  It’s under a Fidelius, so I can’t have it delivered.  Shite, I thought it was going to be easier to go to a muggle place.  I didn’t even think of the getting it home part.”
“Okay, so you have plenty of diapers.  His food and things are in here, as well as the potion for his teething.  Just put about four drops in the bottle that you give him before bedtime.  He can’t sleep without his lion, so that is there, too.  I think that’s everything.  I hope that’s everything.”
“Shhh.  I know, love.  I just want to look at you for a moment.  Gods.  How did you sit through dinner, talking about all that nonsense?”  He traced the rim of the base, ghosting his finger against the skin around it.  He lightly pushed on the base, making it press in a touch more, making Draco howl.
“Well, hello to you, too,” he said, before quickly searching for a place to set the gifts down so he could pick up his goddaughter.  Hermione came to his rescue, taking the boxes from him.  He bent to pick up Rose, setting her on his hip and giving her a loud kiss on the cheek.  “And how’s my favorite girl on her birthday?”
“Very well.  I will contact the ministry and the Knight Bus to see if anyone else saw anything,” Professor McGonagall said.
Harry wanted to ask more questions, but the warmth of Draco’s body and the darkness of the room lulled him.  He pulled Draco tighter against him, and within moments he drifted back into unconsciousness.
It was Saturday evening, and everyone was ready for exams to be over and the holidays to begin.  They had been studying every day the entire week.
“Oh!  Yeah, I finished the dining room.  It’s pretty great, if I do say so, myself.  Figured I would start on the kitchen this weekend.  I think it will be the most difficult, but it has to be done.”
It took him a couple of seconds to find the blond hair again, but when he did, he ran after him.  He didn’t want to make a scene, so as he came up closer, he said a quick “Malfoy” to get the man’s attention.
Ron clapped his hands and headed for the dining room, but Harry tugged his arm, holding him back.  Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise were held back, as well.
When they stepped through the floo into Andromeda’s home at around 10:00 the next morning, it was to see a very excited Teddy.
“No, It’s my turn to talk,” Harry said, standing up.  Draco’s eyes followed Harry as he stepped around the table to stand beside Draco’s chair.  Draco’s stomach clenched as he saw the determination in Harry’s eyes.  He sighed as he nodded for Harry to continue.
“We have been over this and over this, Ron!  I don’t want to fight anymore!  Too many people have died!  No more!”
“I’m so happy for you, Harry,” Luna said, causing Harry to snap out of staring at his boyfriend.  “I always thought you and Draco would make a lovey couple.”
Blushing at the fact that they had been caught by his house-elf, Harry sighed and said, “Actually, I think a Butterbeer sounds good?”  He looked at Draco, who just nodded.
years weren't going to be able to play Quidditch, much to the disappointment of Ron and Harry, so Quality Quidditch Supplies would be too depressing to peruse.
Ever since they had gotten back to Hogwarts, they had slept in the same bed.  “Sleeping, Ronald!  And fully clothed, too, for Merlin’s sake,” Harry had said on multiple occasions.  Despite their salacious flirting, and heavy, heavy snogging sessions, they still had not gone any further than they had while at Grimmauld.
“Well… with Ginny, I think I just thought it was the logical thing to do.  Her family was the closest thing to a real family I ever had.  Her brother is my best mate.  I just seemed the thing to do.  And with Cho, I was trying to console her grieving over Cedric, and she kissed me.  That was really all there was with that.  But, I realized… yeah.  So, there’s that.”
“What happened?” Draco garbled, trying to sit up in the bed so he could see Harry better, but only managing a wince as pain shot through him.
“Watch it, Potter. Salazar, you’d think with those huge glasses, you would be able to see when someone is standing in a doorway.”
“I haven’t forgotten to ask my mother about the Black family furniture, but I wasn’t sure if you still wanted her help.”
“Well, we need to finish this conversation at some point, and I’d prefer to do it sooner, rather than later.  I’m sure we can find someplace to talk.  Besides, I figured you might want to see Nott and Goyle,” he added with a shrug.
“Parkinson wrote you a letter?  What did it say?”  Ron sat down at the head of his bed, next to Hermione.
year, Harry had decided to completely remodel Grimmauld.  He wanted it to be liveable, and he wanted it to be something that Sirius would have been pleased with (AKA: Completely redoing the entire house so that only the outside was the same.)  So, that summer, Harry, Ron, George, Draco, and Blaise Zabini had come in and completely gutted the place.  Once every dark object had been successfully cleansed of magic, it was obliterated and banished.
Once he knew Harry had him, Draco lifted himself, wrapping his legs around Harry’s back, forcing his pelvis into Harry’s.  They frotted against each other for several minutes, groaning around each other’s mouths, cursing, and grabbing anything and everything they could reach.
Harry couldn’t keep his hands still, brushing up and down Draco’s torso as he rubbed his covered cock against Draco’s.  Draco grabbed Harry’s hands, pulling them to grip his arse.  Getting the idea, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, hooking his fingers together at the cleft of Draco’s arse.
Harry took a step back to see that Draco was wearing the same emerald shirt that he had been wearing in the shop, which matched Harry’s tie, and his tie matched Harry’s shirt, a steel grey, the colour of his eyes.
“I have been your boyfriend for just two weeks.  In that time, I have learned more about myself than I ever thought possible.”
He showed them into the dining room, and told them his plans for in there, and then walked back out and down the stairs to the kitchen.  As soon as they walked in, they all noticed a full tea set out on the table, with biscuits and little sandwiches.  Harry smiled and then realized exactly how hungry he was.  He could see Kreacher lurking in the corner, so he said, “Thank you, Kreacher.”  The elf bowed slightly, but when he saw who was coming through the door behind Harry, he squeaked and bowed all the way to ground, his nose touching the floor.  “Mistress Narcissa.  Master Draco.”
“That is something I would have done in the past, but this summer…let’s just say I have learned a lot in the past few months.  About myself and the world.  Honestly, Potter, I just—I’m just so tired of fighting.  We are all adults, now.  Do you think we can call a truce and get on with our lives?”
“Absolutely.  A great adventure with two of my favourite people,” Draco said with a sigh, leaning over to kiss Harry.
.  Working with Dragons gave him muscles in places Harry didn’t even know had muscles.  Harry caught himself once or twice staring at the man, but it seemed no one else noticed, thankfully.
Draco started to interrupt, but Harry spoke over him.  “I am.  When you left me, sitting on my bed, I was hurt more than angry.”
“Yeah.  Some reporters managed their way up to my office, and she threw them out.  I said I didn’t know what we were going to do, because it was going to be like this until we were married, and she said to just elope.  Once we were married, they’d find something else to gossip about.”
“Oh, don’t give me that look!  It’s not like I hurt him or anything!  It was that or give away the location of your house, and the possible wrath of the ministry.  Which would you prefer?”
“Harry! There you are! I was wondering if you’d like to stand…” Wood, who had pushed through the crowd to talk to Harry, faded off as he took in Harry with his fingers laced through Draco’s.
Standing up, he awaited his guests.  He found himself extremely nervous of coming face to face with Narcissa Malfoy again, but the prospect of getting rid of the furniture that creeped him out made him giddy, too.  However, how did he greet her?  Did he shake her hand? Kiss it? Did he bow?  He didn’t know too much about pureblood decorum.
Stepping into the sitting room, he glanced around and saw that there were only a couple people in the room.  They paid his appearance no mind as they continued to snog, so he stepped quietly out of the room.
They sat like that, snogging, for several moments, until they were interrupted by Kreacher popping back into the room.
“There is definitely a bond, there’s no doubt,” Kingsley said.  “Fascinating.  Have either of you noticed an increase of power in your magical cores?  In your wand work?  Any extra flairs of magic when doing mundane spells?”
Ollivander gave Harry a concerned look, as he beckoned him to come to his office in the back.  Harry followed behind the wizened man, through large cases filled with wands.  Coming towards a desk, Ollivander offered Harry a drink, and then ushered him into a chair.
He needed to figure out what in the hell he wanted to do about this thing with Draco.  They definitely were going to need to talk some more, and he needed to know how Draco felt about their relationship.  He sighed loudly as he sat up in bed; he knew trying to get back to sleep was moot.
Teddy’s eyes grew wide as he jumped up from the table and placed his chin on his hands on the counter.  With large grey eyes, he looked up at Draco, voice full of awe as he said, “You’re making me pasghetti?”
After a while, he looked over his drawing and grinned.  Now, to get all of the supplies, and figure out when to get it done.  He could feel the adrenaline pumping from the excitement of his next project as he went down to the kitchen.
Harry was sure his face as red and splotchy as Draco’s by the time they make it to where Minerva was standing, right in front of the staff table.
Harry tugged as he remembered the moans and gasps of ecstasy.  His breath hitched as he touched the tip, wondering again what it would be like for Draco to touch it; lick it.
“I’m sure, but I think Draco can accept a bit of help.”  He looked around and saw a potion bottle sitting on the table next to the cot.  “Is this a pain potion?  Here, drink it.”
There was the plaster hand print that was painted an array of colours, which Teddy had given Harry last year.  Harry watched as they all settled on the tree, taking in everything that meant so much to him.
“We haven't really talked about it, but I would be willing to if you’d want me to.” Draco looked expectantly at Harry.
Draco moaned at the contact, but just said sarcastically, “And we’re back to the slave-driver.”  He grinned at Harry.
As he turned into the doorway, he saw that Bill and Fleur had been joined by George & Angelina, Ron & Hermione, and Ginny.
“I know.”  Harry took Draco’s hand, turning off the lights as he pulled Draco up the stairs toward the sitting room.
“Hmm, let’s see…you’re in hospital because your ribs are broken, Madam Pomfrey is just around the corner, it’s already past curfew… Do I need to go on?
“Shhh. We’ll talk about it later. It’s sleep time.”  Draco slipped off of Harry and down the bed, making Harry do the same, before turning over and reaching for Harry’s arm, wrapping it around Draco’s torso.  “I love you,” he whispered.
“You really don’t need to explain anything to me.”  He picked up his glass and finished it in one large swig.  He was definitely going to be getting drunk tonight.
Harry slid the glass of Chardonnay across the table to Blaise, who picked it up and clinked it against Harry’s glass, taking a drink.  Harry watched Nott’s face out of the corner of his eye as he slid the other drink in front of Draco.
Harry smiled as he tried to remember some of the more ridiculous ones.  “I remember there was one called Sex On The Beach.  It sounded pretty good, too.”
Draco looked at Harry, at Harry’s friends who were moving closer to where they were standing, and then back to Harry.  “Don't worry about it, Potter.  I'll see you around.” With that, he walked away, moving towards the castle.
2.  I'm sorry it's so short!  Like I said, I haven't been able to write, so trying to get everything I wanted in this chapter didn't happen because I wanted to give you guys something, and not too late!  So, here it is.  Hopefully the next one will make up for it!
“That silent conversation you just had with Draco.  You two are almost as bad as mum and dad, I swear.  Don’t even have to speak, and can have a full on discussion.”
Harry heard Hermione calling for him, so he ran up the stairs from the kitchen to yell back, “Down here!”
“Please, do call me Narcissa.  Draco has told me about your new-found friendship, and I hope that will extend to me, as well.”
He heard a small “hmm” coming from Malfoy, who was still practicing using his wand.  He was throwing around non-verbal spells, too.  Harry felt himself becoming more and more impressed with the blond in front of him.  Coming back to himself, though, he glanced down at his watch and found that no more than 15 minutes had come and gone since Malfoy had arrived.
“What’s in it for you, Potter? I already owe you a life debt.  What else could you possibly want from me?”
He was about to ask Hermione a question when the fire flared up, again.  They turned to see who it was and was shocked to see Goyle hesitantly step out.
Once the door was closed behind them, Harry turned to call for Kreacher, but his mouth was suddenly accosted by Draco’s.  Because his mouth had been opened to speak, Draco’s tongue was able to have free rein of the inside of Harry’s mouth.  Harry felt, rather than heard, the soft moan that emitted from Draco as he responded to the assault.  There was no extreme heat this time, just a fulfilling warmth in the belly.
There was a light tap on his shoulder, and when he turned around, there was Draco, looking far more gorgeous than Harry had ever seen him.
“Even with Malfoy, though?  You two are practically sworn enemies.  He’s a Death Eater!  He may not have killed anyone, but he was a part of the problem.  We all know what he did.  He deserves to be in Azkaban! Surely you see this, Harry.”  Seamus’ voice was getting higher.
Harry looked at the rest of the Weasley’s and guests who were sitting around the room.  There didn’t seem to be a dry eye in the group.  He discreetly wiped his eyes as he flicked his wand and sent the rest of the photos to their owners, and then went and sat back down, as well as the other gifts he had picked up for the others.
He gripped Draco’s hand as they passed his bedroom and opened the door to the attic.  He turned to smile at Draco, noticing the confused look on his, Ron’s, and Hermione’s faces, who were in front of te group.
“No! Not at all!  Just have to finish the paperwork from the mission, and then I’m free for the rest of the day, actually, but I can put that off for a few.”
“Yes, please,” he said as he followed her to the kitchen, greeting everyone he passed.  As they stepped into the room, he was greeted, as always, by Molly bustling around, preparing a feast for the masses.
“Tha--that’s fine,” he stuttered, thrown off by the pet name, and Draco’s affection. “But you still haven’t answered my question. What in the hell are doing? With her!” He pointed to the painting.
After over three years of being together, Harry knew exactly what to do to make this brilliant for them both.
“Thank you, Minerva.  And thank you, Harry, for hosting us all.  I am still so incredibly impressed with what you have done with this house.”  She looked around the room, taking in all of the small details that Harry had added.
They were so engrossed in the paper that it took them a moment to realize that Kreacher had popped into the kitchen.
After supper, they decided to head back to their room.  As they walked back through town, Draco couldn’t wait to really get to explore.  During their honeymoon, they didn’t really leave the room but just a couple of times; they would finally get to visit the area, and see what was on offer.
Harry looked across the room to where Draco was again playing chess with Ron.  They both were looking intently at the board, and knew that they were giving each other a challenge.
“Oh, this was Sirius’ room, was it not?  It already seems so different.  Would—would it be possible to take a tour?  I haven’t been in here since I was very small.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw one of his team trying to set up another tent and putting up signs.  He looked back at Harry, who was once again staring at the table, his food sat to the side.
“Too right.  Are you hungry?  Molly’s sandwiches filled me up, but I know you had said something about curry this morning.”
Sudden recognition bloomed bright on Harry’s face, as his cheeks reddened.  Draco smirked.  “Oh.  Yeah.  I remember, now.”
Getting to the next landing, he realised the noise was coming from their bedroom.  Getting nervous, he tightened his grip on his wand and took the stairs two at a time.  He slowly walked toward the door, seeing that it was cracked open.  He peeked around the edge of the door frame, and saw a shadow of a person, bent over, digging through the bottom drawer of their chest of drawers.
“So, I owled your Mother, asking if I could come and speak with her and your father.  She invited me for dinner the next day—remember that night that Pansy had dragged you out for dinner and dancing?  That was when I went to the Manor.
too fast, and I’m going to land flat on my face.  I don’t want to be the reason you get even more bad press.”  He took a breath, and then flushed as he realized what he had just said.
“You…are…amazing,” Draco panted, taking deep breaths in between words.  “Merlin’s fucking beard.”  He then leaned forward and gripped Harry’s hand, pulling it towards him and taking each finger, licking them clean.  “Circe, you taste incredible, too.  Fuck,
He kept thrusting through his orgasm, until Harry whimpered, too sensitive to handle anymore, and Draco carefully extricated himself, slumping beside Harry on the bed.
Receiving inquiring looks from those around him, Harry turned and quickly went back up to the dorm.  Coming back down the stairs holding three wands, the others quickly understood what he meant.
Draco took Harry’s hand, letting himself be pulled up, and checked his pockets one last time to make sure they had everything.  “Alright, let’s go.”
His eyes moved to Seamus and Dean’s table.  Dean was reading his Charms book, but Seamus was twiddling his feather in his fingers.  Getting an idea, Harry smirked to himself and carefully put his hand out like his was going to do a spell on his own feather, but then twisted his palm and cast towards his friend’s.  Seamus was still holding his feather in his fingers when it suddenly became three sizes bigger.  He gasped loudly, quickly dropping the feather on the table.  Harry quickly looked back down at his own feather, just as Seamus turned his head, looking around at his classmates to see who was messing with him.
Harry groaned as he reread a paragraph.  “You know, I think you’re right.”  He stood to go get the plate of toast he had made for Draco, setting it down on the table and moving to sit on Draco’s lap, who scooted back from the table to accommodate him.
“Ah, you've discovered my dastardly plan. Make it so you have no choice but to allow me to take up your space.”
Draco crawled over the top of him, leaning down to thrust his tongue in Harry’s mouth, letting his jutting prick slide against Harry’s, who let out a guttural groan.
“Well, I wish you all the luck.  I can understand your reservations about being an Auror.  If it were me, I would be tired of always chasing the bad guy.”
“Masters, Kreacher has prepared the meal, and has rearranged the dining room to accommodate your guests.  Shall Kreacher finish decorating in here while masters prepare for your guests?”
Turning, he beckoned Malfoy to follow him, leading him down to their intended destination.  As the duo walked into the kitchen, it had become apparent that Kreacher had overheard their discussion: a kettle was sitting in the middle of the table, with two cups and a tray of biscuits sitting next to it.
“However, I believe it is just your wand.  I know you were worried about the Elder Wand, but I don’t believe it is about ‘masters’, so to speak.  You were holding your wand in your wand hand, you say?  Well, I think it is because you were still holding it, that this happened.  A wizard’s magic is inside themself, and the wand is the tool that releases it.  Holding both wands caused a release of your magic into the Hawthorne, sealing the fate that the two of you can exchange impartially.”
Draco spluttered as he stared gobsmacked at her.  Well, lovely to know his friends spoke about him behind his back.
“Free period, but I figured I’d just go to the library and maybe kick this Charms essay out before lunch.”
Harry’s eyes grew wide at the implications.  “I’m going to hold you to that.  I’ll see you later.  Love you!”  He gave him another peck and then went down the stairs to the kitchen.
As he entered the room, he saw a large canvas sitting on an easel in the middle of the room.  He was quite impressed, as the painting depicted the snarl that was bestowed upon Harry every time he came in contact with Snape.  He had to shake his head to realize that the man was not indeed standing in front of him.
He walked straight to his favorite table, setting his things down, and then went to get the book that he had been using for his paper.  Finding the large tome on the shelf where he left it, he made his way back to the table to find that there was someone sitting at it.
Even after all these years, and no matter how many times he begged, his photo was on the front page of the
Moving to stand in front of the fire place, Harry talked loudly to the room.  “Oi!”  The conversation died down, until everyone was looking at him.  “So, I was just thinking—”
“He didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing that she’d got to him.  Isn't that what you said, Harry?” Ron looked over at his best mate with a glare.  “Trust me, he’s bloody stubborn, and never one to want help.” He rolled his eyes.
“Thank you, Kreacher.  Food is ready, for anyone who is hungry!  There’s tons of it, so please help yourself!”
“The Malfoy’s have been arrested and are currently being held at the Ministry.  They willingly gave themselves up, but we will have to wait and see if that will mean much when they go to trial,” McGonagall said.
Looking around at his friends eating their breakfast and making plans for their weekend, Harry looked at his watch.  Seeing it was nearing 10:00, he decided he'd better hurry and go to the library to finish his Charms essay that was due on Monday.  He was going to head to Grimmauld as soon as Potions was over, and he seriously doubted he would even think of picking up a book on the weekend.
Draco raises his hand to get their attention.  “Harry and I had originally said May or June, but my mother has decided to take over and make arrangements without informing us.  So…”. He looked at Harry.
“I know you are excited to see your godfather, but this is no way to act, young man.  You could have been hurt if Harry hadn’t have caught you.” She descended the stairs until she stood over Teddy.
Harry dropped the quaffle onto the sofa, and walked over to wrap his arms around Draco.  “I don’t either, but it’s going to have to happen.  But, we’re going to have to deal with it
With his arms still wrapped around Draco, he leaned towards his boyfriend and kissed him.  “We are celebrating the fact that I told Kingsley and Robards that I refuse to go on anymore secret missions that take me away from you for more than a couple of days.”
He was laying on his stomach, pressing his cock into the mattress.  There was no way he could get out of his bed with this bad of a boner, so he knew he was going to have to take care of it before he could get dressed.
He turned to fork up some food, but was caught unawares when Draco gripped his chin and pulled him into a deep kiss.
She glanced between Harry and Draco when she said that.  Harry smiled slightly, glancing over at Draco, hoping to catch his eye.  Draco, however, was adamantly looking at the floor.
Draco tapped his finger against his chin, feigning contemplation, before he smirked and nodded his head.  “Yes,” he said, sliding into the seat across from Harry.
“I know, but I just want to thank you for being there for me,” he said softly.  “For bringing me back here, for…all of it.  I—”
After only three days, Harry was getting used to living with the Slytherins.  For the most part, they were just keeping to themselves.  He had found out fast that they were both very neat.  Everything had a place, and there was a place for everything.  Harry almost felt sorry for them having to share a space with him and Ron.  Their dorm up in Gryffindor, while not exactly a sty, was far from spotless.
“Er…yeah, I guess so.  I’ve been thinking about it, and I’m not even sure if I want to be an Auror anymore.  I truly am tired of fighting.”  He sighed, and then glanced over at Hermione.  “So, I think I will go back to school, and see if anything else catches my fancy.  There’s got to be something out there that I would enjoy doing.”
Harry smiled wide as he looked at Draco.  “Okay then, so what do you want to do?  Because the point of eloping is that it’s just us.”  Toss.
They all sat in silence for a few moments before Draco took another drink and started again.  “He won’t even talk to me, anymore.  We used to have hours-long conversations, during dinner or while lying in bed.  He’d tell me about his day, what you two had said at lunch, just random thoughts there were filtering through this head.  I don’t think we’ve had a decent conversation since before his birthday.  And—plug your ears Ron—I honestly can’t tell you the last time we made love.  I just… Has he said anything to either of you?”
Draco wasn’t convinced, but allowed himself to be pulled along, as Harry made his way towards the shop.
Draco pulled up his arm that had been holding Harry’s shirt and laid his chin upon it on Harry’s chest.  “Hmm…yes, I would agree to that.  Though, it could be made even better.”
Both were quiet for a few more moments.  Draco heard Harry sigh and shuffle his feet.  Taking a breath, Draco turned in his chair so that he was facing Harry.  He waited for Harry to continue.
“So?  It’s still early.  We could go get something to eat, maybe walk around?  Or, what about going to the Market?  I want to see what you’ve been working on the past few months.”
As he stepped out of the fireplace at the Burrow, he could hear several voices coming from the kitchen.  Too many voices, in fact.  How many people did Molly invite to this thing?  Harry took a deep breath, and went to meet his fate.
Pansy looked between them and saw the determination in both of their eyes.  “My darlings, I wouldn’t miss it for the world,” she said, catching Hermione’s sniffles.
“He said that your pocket seemed to glow white, and with a sudden flash of light, which caused them all to jump back, you disappeared.”
“Yep!  Bev said I didn’t have anything, and she didn’t have much, so I just said that we were starting early.  I sent an owl to Robards, and haven’t gotten a summons, so I’ll take that as a good sign!”  He grinned as he slid the pancake onto a plate on the counter.
“Criminal hearing of the accused, Messrs Philip Hinde, Onyx Chalks, and Miller Rooks.  Mr Rooks has already pled guilty.  How do your other clients plead, Solicitor Wattle?”
Harry cackled loudly, continuing to walk down to the great hall.  “Ha!  Ginny and I are friends.  Just friends.  We broke it off right after the final battle.  Turns out we weren’t really right for each other.  Her new boyfriend is better suited to her than I ever was.”
They only had eyes for each other until the heard a small cough behind them, and realized they weren’t alone.
Once he got to Hogwarts, he was able to take a few baths, but never really got to fully enjoy them.  So, when it came time to remodel his bedroom and en-suite, Harry insisted he have both a shower and a large tub.  He had gone shopping in the wizarding shops, but hadn’t found what he was looking for.  He convinced Ron to go with him to a muggle shop, and that’s where he found paradise.  It was so large that Ron could almost nearly lay down completely in it.  With two people in it, it was big enough that they both could completely stretch out, and only have to share leg space, even as tall as Draco was.
Harry made his way down towards the owlery, getting to the first floor corridor, when he heard his name being called.  Turning around, he saw the Headmistress walking toward him.
The group started making their way to the apparition spot when Harry saw something out of the corner of his eye.  Turning his head, his breath caught.  Coming down the stairs of Gringott’s was Draco Malfoy.
Draco pulled back just a bit, making Harry whine.  Draco chuckled, before giving Harry a quick, chaste kiss.  “I am in love with you, too, you tosser.  I just didn’t know how to tell you.”
“Oh, one more thing, though.  We were thinking of having a get together Saturday evening, to celebrate my home-coming and what not.  Would you and Arthur be able to attend?”
“Besides, if he makes you happy, what could be wrong with it?  Sure, it’s Malfoy, and you are bound to fight, but what couple doesn’t?  Hermione and I can attest to that.”
Kreacher was already at the stove, when he walked in.  As Harry sat down at the table, Kreacher turned around and slid a plate of bacon, eggs, and toast in front of Harry.
Harry scooted over just a bit so that he was leaning against the arm of the couch, but his shoulder and Draco’s knee were touching.  If Harry was to tip his head to the side, it would be lying on Draco’s thigh.
“I…” Draco stared at Harry, mouth open as if he was going to say something, but after a few moments, he just closed his mouth, and, sighing, looked down at the floor.  “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
Harry walked them into the room, showing them all of the additions they had done to it with the extension charms, the bath, and closets.
Harry had been running around Grimmauld Place making sure everything was in order for the party.  Everyone of importance was there; Draco’s parents, the Weasley’s, almost their entire Hogwarts class, friends from work, etc., and Harry was starting to feel the pressure.  Everything had to be
Harry continued, “Besides, I know for a fact that come Monday, you’re going to have a Blaise shaped shadow following you around.  So, there’s that to look forward to,” he chuckled.
“He’s okay, Harry, I promise, too.  I had just walked in the building when I heard yelling.  I walked back out to see a mob suddenly surround him.  People were screaming; photos were being taken.  I ran out and pulled him out of the circle of people.  The hex just grazed him, before I could get the protego out.  It bounced off the wall of the building.”
Teddy sighed, but crawled under the blanket and laid down in between them.  Draco reached over and threw an arm across him, too.  All three soon fell into a deep slumber.
“No, I finished another room this week.  I’ve had a lot on my mind the past couple of days, so working on it gave me something to focus on.  I couldn’t sleep, so I finished it really quickly.”
When Harry came back down from the attic, dust in his hair and on his jumper, Draco was just stepping out of the floo.
He turned back to spoon food onto their plates, and then went to slide Harry’s across the table to where he assumed he’d sit, but was pleasantly surprised moments later when Harry sat down their drinks, and pulled his plate back across the table as he sat down right next to Draco, thighs brushing.
Still holding Draco’s hand, Harry pulled the blond back from where he had begun to walk towards the house.
Ron was already there, saving a table for them towards the back.  As soon as Harry and Hermione had sat down, a waitress came over, took their order, and then disappeared.
“So, what sounds good?  There are a few places around here that have really great food, or I can have something called up from the Canteen.  It’s Monday, so there will likely be some kind of Italian sub sandwich.”
He skated away from them before turning back and gaining some speed before he jumped into the air, spinning a few times, and then landed gracefully back down on the ice.  He circled back, slowly skating back towards them.  He saw the awe in Teddy’s eyes, smiling as he clapped and whooped loudly.  He then chanced a glance up at Harry and saw something that he hadn’t seen in what felt like forever; pure lust.
.  The jeans hugged him in all the right places.  He grabbed for the shirt, putting it on, too.  He smiled to himself.  Harry wouldn’t know what hit him.  Grabbing his wand, a coat, and his money bag, Draco descended the stairs towards the dining room.
“I am glad you are okay, Mr Malfoy, and I am glad Mr Potter had the sense to bring you straight here.”  She nodded towards Harry.  “I will let you know if I find anything out.”  With that, she turned and strode toward the doors.
“I’ll floo over as soon as I get the paperwork done, promise,” he said with a smile.  “Maybe I can convince Draco to go with me.”
He turned over and tried to close his eyes, hoping to get a little more sleep.  All he could see was the flames, though, so he knew sleep was a lost cause.  Sighing loudly, he decided to get an early start on the day.  He still had a bit to do before Malfoy was supposed to arrive.
Finishing up the purchase, Harry was excited to get to know his new companion.  He knew he needed a name, and after remembering how he had found Hedwig’s, he decided to do some reading that evening, in hopes of finding something that would fit.  Harry gave the bird his address, and let it fly away.  He knew he would be waiting for him at home.
“Yes, I’ll be home around 6.  I just want to make sure everything is running smoothly, but I don’t need to stay the whole night.”
He forced himself to back into the present, and to the man that was currently looking up into his face, and not worrying about the ‘what ifs’ of the past and future.  The war was over; he could finally live his life how
“I love you more,” Draco said, playing with Harry’s hair, his eyes beginning to droop.  “I love you so much more.”
Draco, Narcissa, Molly, and he were meeting this evening to go over some ideas for the wedding.  It had been a couple of weeks since they had announced their engagement to the families, and Narcissa and Molly had taken it upon themselves to start the planning almost immediately.
knew I would need this when you put it in.  You knew I’d tease you, and you knew that I would do it in my own time.  Didn’t you?”
Harry was shocked at this information.  He suddenly became worried, because that was what he had tried to prevent.  Seeing the look on Harry’s face, Ollivander was quick to continue.
He pulled back, looking into Harry’s eyes.  “For everything.  We still need to talk about a lot of things, but I am so happy that I am still allowed to do this,” he said pecking a kiss on Harry’s lips.  “I will see you in a few hours.  Get some sleep—you won’t be getting any tomorrow if I have my way.”
Draco then began drawing some more things on the sketch.  Harry wasn’t surprised when he suddenly stopped drawing, flipped to a new page in the book, and started drawing an entirely new design.  He was walking around the room, muttering to himself.
“Says the wizard that is having trouble breathing he is laughing so hard,” Draco replied with a smile.  “What else do you want to do before you have to go back home?”
Draco and Harry were walking hand-in-hand, watching Teddy play.  He suddenly stopped, though, and then bent in half laughing.  They gave each other a curious look and quickened their pace to see what he was cackling at.
“Ah.  Well, how about this?  Hermione, why don’t we go shopping Wednesday in Diagon in the morning, and then Ron can meet us, and I can go off with him?  Does that work for you both?”
Draco didn’t know what was going to happen.  He looked quickly between the two women, until he saw Harry snap-to, and went over to grasp Teddy from Andromeda’s arms.
IT'S ALIVE!!!!!  Okay, seriously, I suck.  BUT!  I am posting the last 3 chapters right now, and it's done!  Only took me over two months, but...  It's kinda hard to write a story about mental health when your own mental health isn't so great.  Alas... here we go!  Thank you for reading!
“Potter, Weasley, Longbottom, Malfoy, and Zibini: you all are in dorm one.  Corner, Thomas, Finnigan, Finch-Fletchley, and Macmillan: dorm two.  I will leave you gentlemen to get settled in.”
Harry sighed, sitting on the bed.  He had not let himself really dwell on the encounter with Draco, all week.  It had only been four days ago, and once Harry let himself think about it, he became even more angry and sad.  What had happened?  What had been going through Draco’s head?  Harry had come to realize that something had to have been said in the ‘argument’ Draco talked about.  Again, it had only been four days, but those four days had seemed the longest Harry had experienced in awhile.
“Yeah, it is!  It’s been crazy all week, what with Christmas being Friday.  Speaking of, I think my break is just about finished.  Are we still meeting for lunch and then going shopping in Muggle London?”
Harry tensed as he readied himself for the fight, but was pleasantly surprised when all that Ron did was chortle, lightly kick Draco in the shin, and say, “Shut it, Malfoy!”
Draco moaned when Harry bit his pulse point.  Harry then sucked on the spot that he bit, causing a large red welt to rise up.
Harry barely breathed until he heard the floo flare up.  He seemingly melted, sitting down on the top step.  Pulling his knees up, he slowly ran his fingers through his hair.
“Do you have any idea as to what happened?  I know you said that it was possible for me to still be able to use his wand, but this seemed a bit more intense than just that.”
Draco’s stomach dropped.  He was confused, concerned, and nervous as to what was happening.  He startled slightly when Harry suddenly thrust his journal at him.  “I don’t…”
Harry slid in beside Teddy, so they were all on the same side of the table, and wrapped his arm around him.  “Oh, Ted, of course we’re going to miss you.”  He looked over at Draco above Teddy’s head, and gave him a questioning look.
He realized that Draco was laying half on top of him, with his head tucked neatly under Harry’s chin, and his arm lain across Harry’s chest, gripping the seam of his t-shirt.  Harry’s right arm was dangling off the couch, but his left was laying across Draco’s back.  Discovering his arm was losing feeling, he carefully brought it up, linking his hands together, wrapping Draco in a hug.  Harry quite liked the feeling of the taller man covering him and became as still as he could in the hopes of not waking him.
Ron and Hermione, who had both blushed when Harry spoke of sex, paled just as quickly when he mentioned death.
“No!  I had noticed the past couple of weeks him trying to change his hair color to match his toys, but he hadn’t succeeded until now!  What a smart, beautiful child, you are!” she cooed to her grandson.
He was just about to tell them about some extra things that he had done, when a heat against his leg made him stop mid-word.  He let out a gasp, but then the feeling was gone as quickly as it appeared.  He didn’t know what to make of it.  He was about to respond to Hermione, who had asked him what was wrong, when the doorbell rang.
He smiled as he looked across the water.  Draco, his eyes closed and head leaning back against the head rest, had a small smile on his face.  Harry reached his hand out and tweaked the big toe of Draco’s left foot.  Draco tugged his foot back and scrunched his nose.
Having finally caught his breath from running all the way from the common room, he took the seat next to Harry.  “Yeah.  Bill sent me an owl saying he and Fleur would be coming this weekend, so I'm going to see them.  What are your plans? You about finished with the sitting room?”
He looked around at the people, trying to find the unmistakeable head of his (hopefully still) boyfriend.  As his eyes swept the room, they didn't land on green; they locked on the brown of Hermione’s.  He grimaced slightly, glancing down at the floor as she stared at him; there was no doubt in his mind that Harry had spoken to his best friends about all that had happened.
Draco stood there staring at Harry.  “We promised we’d be there, Harry.  You promised, on Sunday.  You told ‘Mione you would be.”
Harry nodded, and watched as Draco stepped into the fireplace.  As soon as he was gone, Harry did the same.
They looked at each other quickly before turning back to her and saying at the same time, “Absolutely not.”
“Mate, I can honestly say that I never thought it could be done, but you have done an amazing job.”  Ron clapped him on the back.
Taken aback, Harry glanced at Draco, who gave him a small smile.  “Well, thank you.  I’d like that.  But, please, call me Harry.”
“Yes, well, I can look good doing about anything.  Holding a baby isn’t any different.  Anyway, what were you saying about tile?”
When neither Ron nor Draco had come out of the room after 45 minutes, Harry decided enough was enough.  He walked over to their door and knocked loudly three times on it.
Draco sighed as he stood, and helped Harry up by grabbing his hands. “Yeah, sorry about that,” he said.
Stepping out of the floo, he was assaulted by yelling.  He could hear Molly and Ginny going at it in the kitchen.  He didn’t know if he should stay or leave, but was stopped from making a decision when Ron walked down the stairs into the living room.  Seeing Harry, Ron smiled, rolling his eyes and shrugging his shoulders.
to do is know that it is over, and that you only have to worry about yourself for now.  However, a lot has happened already.  Kingsley has been named Interim Minister of Magic.  Aurors have been crawling the castle since just after you fell asleep, trying to gather all of the--,” he hesitated briefly.  “The dead, and has started locating their next of kin.”
“What’s to talk about?  I’m a death eater.  Everyone knows it, and most don’t like it.  Don’t like that I’m here.”  He looked up at Harry.    “Don’t like that you helped me.  Don’t like that we’re friendly now.”
Years as they moved fully into the room.  “I’m serious.  Draco and I have called a truce.  I hope you all will join in.  Please.  No more fighting.”  He walked over to Zabini and stuck out his hand.  “Truce?”
They had kissed on New Year’s, as all of their other friends were paired off and it just seemed the logical thing to do.  It had started out as just a chaste peck on the lips.  They both pulled back almost instantly, and just stared at each other.  It took several moments, but then Harry had gathered his Gryffindor courage, and slid his hand into the hair on the back of Draco’s neck.  Gently, he pulled Draco towards him, and again their lips met.
year had spat at him.  He was used to the name calling and random hexes, but sometimes they hit a wrong cord, and he lost his cool.
Harry huffed, causing Draco to let out a quiet chuckle.  Draco slid his hand down the outside of Harry’s right arm, before gripping it and tugging Harry’s wand out of its holder and flicked it at the door, letting it swing open.  Harry reached around Draco’s waist to where his wand was sitting in its holder on his belt.  Pulling it out, and with a swish of his arm, the refrigerator door opened, and the several cases of champagne came flying out.
Draco, who had been taking another drink of the coffee, chocked a bit at what she said.  He coughed once, blushing as he said, “Yes, I do.”
"Yes, thank you, sir.  Although, I'm sure there will still be something in the papers tomorrow, I won't say no to avoiding them."
“I couldn’t even speak I was so angry.  How dare he think he can still choose my future when he is locked in a cell in Azkaban for the rest of his?  Despite that fact, I’m only eighteen!  And gay!  I don't… I just… I lost it, which is the only explanation I have as to why I jumped you upon coming back upstairs.”
“We’ve since discovered that while we each can use our own wands, we can just as easily interchange and use each others.”
Harry’s head was throbbing, his extremities felt like lead, and his mouth felt as if it was full of cotton.  He blearily opened one eye, and found that he was indeed in his own bed, but how he got there, he had no idea.
Harry hummed as he turned his head to kiss Draco, before scooting back some more and leaning back against his chest.
“Love you more,” Draco said as he turned the corner.  “Now, to send some owls,” he said with a grin.
“No, we also wanted to let all of you, our families and best friends, know that we are officially engaged!”  He lifted up Draco’s hand, to show everyone the glistening ring on his finger.
They worked diligently for several more minutes, and then Harry plopped himself on the sofa and waited for Draco to join him.
I hope you like the interactions between the characters.  This is my first fic, so it is difficult getting their mannerisms right.
He thought he heard Hermione ‘hmm’ at him, but he wasn’t sure.  He walked quickly to their room, and caught Draco just as he was walking back out with his chess pieces.
“Neither of you were at breakfast, but I know you both need something in your stomachs.  Come on, eat up.”
Draco turned around to see the most perfect tree he had ever seen.  Don’t get him wrong, his mother made sure that they had the most amazing trees every year, but this one?  This tree was magnificent.  It was just the perfect height, and was so full.  It was covered in snow, and there were fairy lights already glowing on the branches.
“Draco?”  Harry tossed the duvet off of him, scooting down to the foot of the bed, where Draco had sat down.  “Draco?  What’s wrong?
Harry wrapped his own hand into Draco’s hair, lightly pulling on it as he deepened the kiss.  A moan escaped Draco’s mouth, which seemed to awaken Harry out of the trance that was caused by Draco’s lips.
Draco stood up, smiling, and said, “I’d love that, but I may or may not have promised Ronald that we would have dinner with him and Hermione this evening. That only leaves us a couple of hours until they’re supposed to arrive.”
Ron laughed bitterly.  “No big deal? Mate, this is Malfoy we are talking about.  Once a slimy git, always a slimy git.”
He started walking over towards the window, when Draco said, “Oh! I had hoped you wouldn't mind that I borrowed him.  Mother had to borrow mine, and I needed to ask her something, so I used Orion.  I'm sorry.”
Putting his coat on the hook and setting his bag next to the chair in the den, he made his way down to the kitchen.  Upon entering the room, he saw Harry stood at the stove, stirring a pot of something that smelled divine.  The table was set for two, candles lit, and wine sitting out to breathe.
Ron walked over and pushed the muggle switch, down.  It turned the lights out, leaving the group in darkness.
Draco just looked at Harry like he had two heads, and rolled his eyes.  “You’re taking this a bit far reached, don’t you think?”
He spent the rest of the day doting on Teddy, ripping up the bedroom, and fretting as to what he wanted to say to Draco when the time came.
They continued to hold hands as their waiter brought out their wine and salads.  Once their glasses had been filled, Harry raised a toast.
“I'm just glad he’s okay.”  He smiled at Narcissa, and then looked over at Draco.  “I'm going to go and let everyone know you're awake, so maybe they will go to sleep,” he said with a grin.  “I know Pansy has been frantic, so expect her to be coming in as soon as I let her know you're up.”  With a small nod, Harry stood up and began walking away, but only got as far as the foot of the bed before Draco spoke.
He and Draco sat on one side of the long table, towards the end, and McGonagall and Narcissa sat across from the, leaving the end seat for Kingsley.
It was now Draco’s turn to stop as he came to a halt in the middle of the street they were crossing, causing Harry to walk past him a few steps before realising he was alone.
“Family.  I’ll follow your lead.”  He gestured to Draco to show him which package to wrap in which paper, as he knew Draco would have some kind of a system.
“That was delicious,” Hermione said as the four of them walked back to 12 Grimmauld Place.  “I’m glad you suggested it, Draco.”
“Can’t come soon enough, in my opinion.  I enjoyed the few days off when we got back.  I’m already tired of the daily grind.”
He jumped up, quickly pulling on some clothes.  He ran back into the en suite, brushing his teeth and running a comb through his hair.  He stared at his reflection for a moment, smiling at how well his not shaving for the last four days, since Christmas, was producing a very fine beard.
Harry grinned as he looked up at Draco. “You’d better get some practice in, Malfoy,” he said with a smirk. “As soon as we get back to Hogwarts, I’m going to kick your arse in a Seeker’s match.”
The grin that cropped up on Harry’s face took Draco’s breath away.  Draco cautiously shifted, settling his hands on Harry’s hips.  “What now?”
He turned to Ron and Hermione, who were both looking at him with small smiles, eyes glistening.  “Are you serious?”
She smiled as she looked between them.  “I am truly happy for the both of you.  I am so pleased and honoured to have been witness to it all, and am beyond blessed to have been asked to perform this bonding ceremony.
He sat up further in his chair.  He quickly thought about flooing to Grimmauld, and asking Harry to join him, but quickly dismissed the idea; Harry hadn’t directly said anything, but Draco liked to think that he had indeed learned a bit about Harry in the past few months, and knew with absolute certainty, that the Manor was still full of horrible memories for Harry.  It was, too, for Draco, but he was trying to erase those by replacing them with new, happier memories with his mother.
He didn’t dawdle in the shower, but apparently took too long, because when he came out, he was the only one left.  Quickly getting dressed, he grabbed the books that he would need for his morning classes and went down to the Great Hall to get something to eat, all the while thinking of his dream.
Harry just looked at the two, and then looked at Ron and Neville.  “Oh, no.  What did I just get myself into?”
Harry walked through the atrium, smiling, nodding, and waving at various people as he made his way to the lifts.  Once safely inside the cubicle, he sighed and sank back against the wall.  He didn’t know if he would ever get used to being the center of attention.
“Don’t worry, baby, I’m getting there.  I’m going to take the edge off first, though, because now that I’ve finally got your gorgeous arse in my bed, I’m not planning on letting you leave it for a while.”
“Yeah, perfect timing,” Harry snarled, standing up and fixing himself in his trousers.  “That kid, I swear.  Coming, Ted!” he yelled down the stairs.
“He told me about a ritual that would enable me to give back the wand, but told me there was a chance that I would still be able to use it.
Without even thinking, Harry jumped quietly out of his bed and rushed over to Ron’s, pulling the curtains wide.  The sight that accosted him made him grimace.  Ron was twisted up in his bedding, and thrashing about.  He was having a horrific nightmare.
They thanked him, and Draco said ‘ga’, which caused them to start moving down the snow-covered trail.
“I love you, too.  So much.”  He leant in for another kiss.  “Do you think you’d ever take me to this class?  I’d like to make you something, too.”
Harry warmed at the contact, but chose to ignore it; it was just an accident.  He started working on the paper, but then realized that he needed more information.  He stood up and said he was going to go look for some books that would help with the paper.  As he turned down an aisle, he mentally berated himself for how his heart rate grew just at the sight of the pointy blond.
Draco wrapped his hands around Harry’s head, pulling him towards himself. As their lips touched, Draco felt as if everything was right with the world.
The trees arched over the trail, and there were large magical ornaments and crystals hanging from the branches.  There were fairie lights everywhere, and everything was covered in snow.
Teddy sighed and pouted as he made his way back towards his chair at the table.  Harry winked at Draco as he waved his wand and a small box zoomed into his hand.
They broke apart, both trying to fill their lungs with oxygen.  “I thought I was promised a bed,” Draco gasped, before biting onto Harry’s bottom lip.
“Mate, that is beyond brilliant!  And may I say, I’m really proud of you for thinking about this for so long!”  He nudged Ron’s shoulder.
“It’s okay, Ted.  Shhh, it’s okay.”  Harry started bouncing Teddy, trying to calm the boy and himself down at the same time.
Harry was happy to see the wide smile on George’s face, and as he looked around the table, he thought everyone else was, too.
Harry walked back into the room, causing Draco to sit up.  “They understand.  Bill said to lay low for the day, and he’ll hopefully see you tomorrow.”
Teddy looked up into Harry’s eyes.  Draco couldn’t see what he did, but the grin on Harry’s face meant something important had happened.  Harry pecked several kisses on his godson’s head and cheeks.  This caused Teddy to squeal again, wiggling in Harry’s arms.
Draco gasped as Harry nipped the skin just under his ear.  “Okay, yeah, let’s go.”  They stood there for several more minutes snogging, though, until finally Draco pushed Harry back.  “Really, let’s go.”  He walked out of the room, fixing his clothes as he made his way up the stairs towards the floo.  Harry followed behind him, doing the same, and chanting
When Teddy got tired of skating, frustrated that he couldn’t do the spins like Draco, they went and got some food.  Teddy decided he wanted a kabob, so Harry went to order while Draco and Teddy went to find seats.
Walking down to the shower, Harry decided that he was ready to start remodeling Grimmauld.  He really wanted to put a bathroom in his room so he wouldn’t have to walk downstairs each time he wanted to use the loo, and the house itself really just needed to be updated extensively.
“Kreacher!” Draco said, pausing a moment as the elf popped into existence in front of him. “Can you please get Harry’s breakfast and take it to him in the lounge?” Getting a low bow in return, Draco beamed up at Harry, as Kreacher popped out of sight and a second later popped back into place upstairs. “There you go! Now, shoo! I’ll come get you when we’re done.”
“It seems that just before you went unconscious, according to this man, you mumbled something out-loud.  Do you recall this?”
When he had clothes on, Draco looked far too skinny, with his bones jutting out; nothing but pointy edges.  Without clothes, though, he was a sight of perfection.  The hair on his chest was so pale that it was hardly there; one had to really look for it in order to see it.  Harry could definitely tell that Quidditch had done the man good, too.  His stomach muscles were well defined, as were his pecks.  Harry’s breath stuttered as he took a hard look at the body before him.  He moaned quietly as Draco took his hands and brought them up his chest.
Soon, the men were up and dressed, and walked out to the common room: they noticed Seamus and Dean sitting on the couch, eating breakfast.
Harry leaned over to his boyfriend, (Boyfriend? Is that what they were? They'd have to talk about that at some point) and grinning, chastely kissed him.
Teddy leaned into Harry’s side as they finished up their meal, and started talking about Hogwarts again, asking a dozen questions in quick succession.
Casting a charm on them to float behind him, he made his way up the stairs to the study, grabbing several pieces of parchment, and a couple ballpoint pens.  He had been so glad when they had finished Hogwart’s and he could introduce a few muggle inventions to his friends.
Harry could feel his eyes beginning to water.  “Yeah, bud, he did.  My daddy and your daddy were best friends.”
Harry pretended to mull it over.  “Well, maybe not uncle Ron.  He’s part troll.  I lived with him for several years, I’d know.  Just don’t tell him I said that.”
Draco could hear Harry say to the bird, “Sorry to wake you, mate, but I need you to take this letter to Mr Ollivander at Diagon Alley.”
Both women nodded their agreement, and Draco soon found himself, his mother, and Professor McGonagall in Harry’s sitting room.
He stood and carefully picked up both figures, gently placing them on the mantle, on either side of the picture set in the middle of the two of them on their wedding day.  He turned back around and wrapped his arms around Harry’s middle.  “They’re amazing.  You’re amazing.”  He leant in for a kiss.  “Thank you, love.”
“We are out shopping, and thought we’d come here and get some things.  Didn’t expect to see you, though!”  Harry smiled at his best mate.
Draco caught her eye and smiled, nodding his head.  He could see the happiness for him in her eyes; she had been worried, too.
McGonagall’s face relaxed for a moment, but the pinched look returned just as fast.  “Unfortunately, I think it might.  When that man gives his testimony in front of the Wizengamot, he will mention your disappearing.  The majority of the people in the room will have been there in July, and know the aspects of your probation, so I’m afraid…”  She didn’t continue.
“Well, we can just stay in, get some room service, and watch the wizarding telly, or we can go into town, find someplace to eat, and look at the Christmas lights.  It’s up to you.”
Hermione sat next to him, with Ron on her other side.  She leaned over to Harry and whispered, “I’ll talk to him” in his ear.  Harry tightly smiled at her.
He sat his tray down, before turning and taking the one Draco was holding and placed it on the table, too.  They both walked around to their side of the booth, Harry sliding in before Draco.  Harry reached across and picked up his glass of firewhiskey and another one that was a deep purple/blue colour.
Draco hesitated a couple of seconds, took a deep breath, and sat down in the empty spot.  Nobody said anything, so he let out the breath, and put some eggs on his plate.
“Well! I was just informed I'm supposed to give a speech of good tidings or something, so here goes! Thank you all so much for coming over tonight. It's been wonderful to get to speak with you all and find out what everyone's been up to.
“Every word.  I want to spend more time with you.  Really get to know you.  For as long as you’ll allow me.”
Harry nodded, again tracing his fingers down the scar.  He knew they’d need to talk more about it later, but now, he could see Draco’s straining bulge and could feel his own, while deflating just a bit, still begging for release, so he continued on with his ministrations.
“I think we all know what he’s implying, darling,” Pansy said as she and Hermione passed around drinks.
Draco had been silent, listening to Harry’s story.  He couldn’t believe that Harry had gone through all the trouble to get his parent’s permission, and then had a ring specially made.  He sat there stunned a few moments more, and then leaned forward and captured Harry’s lips.  He slipped his tongue into his mouth as he moved to straddle Harry’s lap.  He cupped Harry’s face as he leaned in, his forehead touching Harry’s.
They made their way down towards the lobby and stepped back out into the cold air.  They held hands as they turned and walked down the snowy road.  Fairy lights lit up the trees in the park and were placed on the eaves of the buildings, but when they turned a corner onto the main street, they both stopped and gasped.
“Fuck.”  He sighed, thinking over all that Draco had told him.  He was interrupted from his thoughts, though, when Teddy started crying.
Teddy giggled as Harry leaned over and gave him a hug.  Harry pulled the box back towards him, and saw a beautiful golden stag ornament sitting in the box.  He pulled it out and saw that it was jumping, and had elegant swirls etched into the body of it.  “Ted, it’s beautiful.”
“Maybe.  But like I said, this has been going on for months.  Sometimes he just gets up and leaves, sometimes without saying anything, sometimes telling me he’s going for a walk, and then comes back hours later.”  He sat there, and then suddenly had an idea; one he was sure had always been in the back of his mind but had never wanted to really think about until now.
McGonagall nodded, continuing her tale.  “He apparently said that you spoke out-loud, just as one of the other men…”  She trailed off and cleared her throat, causing Draco to look at her questioningly.  “I’m sorry,” she said, looking between Draco and Narcissa.  “This might be hard to hear.”
“Yeah, she did.  One of the things we talked about, though, was a spell that she had heard of, that uses transfiguration spells and charm work to create a likeness to electricity.”
“He created an apparition spot, attuned to you two, us, Blaise, and Pansy.  We’ve sworn we will only use it when invited over, though,” she said with a wink.
Draco quickly looked back up at the woman, shaking his head, saying, “Pardon me.  You see… well, when Harry returned my wand...we believe it may have caused us to form a—a link?  I truly have no idea what it all means, but I believe that Harry needs to be a part of this conversation.  He has a bit more knowledge on the subject, if I’m being honest.”
Draco poured himself a cup of coffee, buttering some toast.  He turned his attention to the Headmistress.
“Thank you, Kreacher.  Shall we?”  Narcissa led the way over to the long table and took a seat.  Harry sat across from her, and Draco sat next to Harry.  Harry flicked his wand and tea was poured into the three glasses.
Gripping onto the back of Harry’s shirt, and in-between sobs, Draco continued.  “Because of you.  Everything boils down to you.  You saved me in that fire.  And then you stood up in court and spoke for me and my mother.  When I saw you stand and start speaking, I couldn’t believe my eyes.  When I was sitting in the cell at the Ministry, I kept reliving the moment when I looked up and saw you barreling towards me on that broom.  After all the horrible things I have done to you, you didn’t leave me there.”
“It’s nothing, really.  I just…got in an argument, and didn’t want to go back to the Manor.  Grimmauld was the first place I thought of.  Without thinking, I just climbed in here.  Sorry.”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered, moving forward to kiss Harry.  “Now, hurry up, we have to meet McGonagall in 20 minutes.”
