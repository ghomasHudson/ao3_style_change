“Oh, Merlin’s sac,” Harry mutters.
mentioned him?
The bleach-white floorboards are a coarse kind of smooth underfoot, like they’ve been meticulously sanded but not polished. Like the wood itself doesn’t want to be polished and rewards him with a steady warmth.
Twelve Grimmauld Place is, in a single word, fucked.
” Draco whispers. “Are you serious?”
The goblin in the lift doesn’t say a word on the way up, and it’s not an improvement. Goblin tellers all glare at him as he shuffles to the lobby Apparition point, and he wonders for a moment if they know he’s slowly robbed that vault of something intangible.
“Ron wasn’t on duty.” Green, green, green. “He was a member of this fine, upstanding team till they decided to cap off the stag party with a Fortescue’s B and E.”
“Not that she probably makes your toes curl to begin with.”
Draco’s head bobbles sarcastically. “Your dick is on my foot.”
Slick, wet heat slips straight into the delicate, sensitive skin of his opening.
“Name?”
"Nothing." His shoulder moves, faintly and slowly, and Harry can just pick out the scars along his waist.
you?” Draco picks up a bar of soap from a holder on the ledge of the tub and sniffs it warily. “I can’t imagine why.”
” Draco chants, and ends in a jerking, halting whimper.
“You think I’m gonna be Neville Parkinson, or’s she gonna be Pansy Longbottom? No!” Neville straightens up, hands spreading over an invisible marquee. “The Parkbottoms!”
you’ve got in your trousers, frankly.”
“Draco… I’m…” His lips part, tongue lifts, but the words won’t come. Not this time.
Practically nose-to-nose with the wreath, conscious of the chasm behind him, he grins. It’s a ridiculous decoration. Utterly fucking bonkers.
“Gin, I don’t think-”
“It’s just Ron was so mad ‘n he kinda blamed you.” Dean leans against the wall, blinking slowly. “S’it really alright if I get with Gin? Cuz you can tell me not to ‘n I’ll back off.”
, mind you. But she never exactly sang your praises in that department.”
“Why?! You were brilliant!”
Feathers swirl over the dark wood floor in the draft from the door. They lay everywhere, having erupted from the mattress like a Pompeii of plumage. Feathers on the nightstands. Feathers on the mantle. Feathers on the chairs. On the rug. In the creases of the heavy velvet valances over the windows. On the fucking canopy over the four-poster bed, in a move that had to have defied simple physics.
Draco’s hands card through his hair, eyes shut, and Harry’s lungs fill, eons after his chest froze. Yellowing bruises decorate Draco’s chest, dark against the white scars and flushed skin, but the bruises are the least of the wounds Harry feels responsible for.
" But the Weaselette... " she started.
" I can't do this anymore, I can't.." She was muttering to herself
Daxia let the book slam shut and dropped it to the floor finally looking up at him, and that only made Harry more nervous because Daxia was almost like Hermione in the matter of books and if she was willing to drop the book then whatever had upset her must be pretty serious. " Oh nothing!! everything's perfect. Why do you care anyway ?" she answered, which wasn't helpful at all.
She curled up even more body tense and rigid. Harry's eyes softened on seeing her so defensive " Hey relax, you don't have to tell me anything you aren't comfortable with, but I can't help you if you don't speak to me Daxia. " She looked at him " Why would you want to help me, we aren't even friends."
Whatever his friends thought it didn't matter because he intended to find out what was going on and soon.
Gracie shrugged " I don't know ! Your shoe size " Harry blinked once again. " You want to know my shoe size ?" he asked dumbfounded.
Daxia looked up from the book she was reading as he entered, their eyes met for a second and Harry felt a sense of Deja vu as she stared at him coldly and then turned away continuing reading through her book not sparing him another glance as he came closer. Harry then remembered it was the same way she'd treated him in first year after that night. Harry frowned wondering if he'd done something wrong. She hadn't acted this cold towards him since Christmas. He came and sat down on the sofa in front of her.
" Oh I can't believe you did it Grace, the idiot actually believed you liked him" one of them said before bursting out in laughter again.
" I'm Gracie Dawson, I'm new here" she said as an introduction. Harry nodded " I'm Harry Potter." he offered back.
It was the new girl in the area. Harry supposed she was pretty with blue eyes and blonde hair. He'd heard that her family was filthy rich, exactly the kind Dursely's sucked up to. They'd moved here at Privet Drive before Harry had returned back from his god awful fifth year.
" Will you go on a date with me?" she asked.
" That was the idea wasn't it." she muttered under her breadth. Harry blinked "What ?" She simply shook her head. It was then that Harry looked at her properly, "You're pretty." he said without thinking and immediately blushed later. She blinked " You think I'm pretty" she asked. Bashfully Harry nodded " Yeah, like those angels I heard my cousin talk about from the story books. You look like an angel." he stated innocently. She looked shocked for a moment before she started tearing up eyes welling up with tears and Harry panicked thinking he had somehow upset her when out of nowhere she hugged him, wrapping her arms around tight around him. Then she pulled back and kissed his cheek. Harry blushed beet red.
She was sitting on the window sill with her legs dangling outside. Harry's eyes widened, it was a very dangerous position, one wrong movement and she would fall several feet directly to her death. He carefully removed his invisibility cloak and went to stand behind her. Her gaze had been too focused on the ground below to actually notice him. So he shuffled a little and the small noise startled her so bad she lost her grip on the window ledge and tipped forward. Harry quickly caught he before she fell through, putting an arm around her waist and pulling her backward.
DM: I know, it’s just, with your disability I’m worried for you. The Order may find a way to get here and take you back to those dreaded muggles.
“My lord, I’m sorry to interrupt, but Potter’s owl was the one to deliver the note.” Draco said handing over the bloodstained note to Voldemort, who read it and then handed it over to his father.
Draco’s hands work shampoo through his hair, suds falling and sliding down his body with torturous slowness, as though they’re taking their time out of spite. They linger and flow down flushed skin, over slick white scars, gather and fall from sharp hips, and curl across the crease of his groin to linger in soft ash blond hair.
It’s not breaking and entering, because he’s going to use the wreath key. It’s trespassing, maybe. Technically. But none of that will matter if the wreath isn’t there. If the wreath is gone, it means Malfoy is inside, and he can just hightail it back out of Gringotts with his dignity intact.
It’s Harry’s turn to miss his mouth, and crumbs tumble from his lip onto his desk. “She’s
,” Draco says through a spreading grin. “It’s only humane of me to divest you of this burden.”
Harry’s laugh turns into a wet
Those tight-wound threads snap, and he comes, his cock throbbing in his hand, painting thick streaks up to his chest flowing down his clenched fist.
A loud pop and Harry’s very manly shriek of nude terror echoes through the bathroom. Black eyes and startled laid-back ears show just above the edge of the tub, and Harry has never wanted more to be fully-clothed.
“I’m- It’s-” Harry stammers, clutching the box through the thick red fabric. “She’s just-”
Draco pulls back and licks his lips, slick, swollen, and reluctant to relinquish their prize.
Draco slaps his hand away, and Harry chuckles. It’s an enticing affront, that Draco’s body dared to change while Harry wasn’t paying attention. He’s familiar and new under Harry’s touch. More solid, more substantial, more mature. But then, they’d only been a year out of school when he’d memorized this body.
He pauses in the threshold, taking in the expanse of clean walls and unadorned window frames. It’s more welcoming for being exposed to the world. A place to visit, stay as long as he likes, leave, and return. Nothing like the dusty, dark cave where he’d hidden from the world, from Ginny, and from himself. No, this is an altar, not a mausoleum.
Draco scoffs, but smooths Harry’s hair back from his face. “Bullshit. You’ve seen that show many dozens of times. Hundreds, maybe.”
“Unacceptable. I am a fucking
Last time, the walls had been exposed, marred plaster, and a crime in floral wallpaper for decades before that. But now they’ve fully molted into a smooth, matte buttercream yellow that greets the morning sunlight as a companion.
“213 Diagon. Number 1045,” Malfoy says, barely above a whisper this time.
“Yeah,” Harry croaks, throat and trousers tight under the deluge of memories. “I’m… sorry.”
“Oh,” Harry says in an exhale, uncertain which is the bigger wrong—the break-up or the arrest. “I think your charges might be dismissed. Some knob with MimeoQuills buggered the paperwork ten ways from Sunday.”
“Try to find me. See me. Firecall me. Owl me. Write me. Anything?”
The squeak of his trainers is too loud in the empty changing room, and the tile reflects too much morning light, and it’s all a bit much. But there is a bare minimum to the dress code, and smelling like used Quidditch leathers wouldn’t meet that low standard.
Harry’s not entirely sure if his glasses can hide his startled expression, but it doesn’t matter, because his vision is blocked by a fall of blond hair as Draco kisses him again. His body falls, flushed skin against flushed skin, hard length pressing into Harry’s hip.
over them, just in case this visit doesn’t go well. His house, his fridge; therefore, his food.
“The fuck you will!” Harry shouts, reaching for the other foot but losing them both.
“Get in the damn cell, you three,” Adams grumbles through a smirk.
The snails creeping up his throat burn like acid, and he swallows again. “No, not Charlie. Ginny.”
Tears pool against Dean’s lower lids, and Harry’s shoulders tense. Fistfights, confessions, and vomit are all par for the course, but sad drunks are the worst.
An echoing throb in his cock makes Harry’s breath hitch, and Draco licks his lips before he speaks. “You’re always sorry, generally speaking. But maybe you’ve figured out
the kitchen staff had ladled out couldn’t hold a candle to
“लाली । Blush,” Harry says, lightly brushing Draco’s cheeks. Draco goes impossibly redder, saying the word back, eyes on Harry as he moves his fingers down to Draco’s lips, tracing them lightly. “ मुलायम होंठ । Soft lips.”
“That you write love poems for me in French? That’s a well-known fact, Draco.” Harry laughs when Draco swats at his arm.
she be positioned outside the “marital bed.”
Harry’s eyes drift open as they part, but his glasses are entirely fogged.
Draco grins, and it’s victory, homecoming, and solace. He nods toward Harry’s crotch. “It’s not going to wash itself.”
“Yeah...” Harry drawls, unconvinced. “She’s a catch. She alright?”
“It’s not objecting. Are you?”
“You don’t usually go for broke before a shift.” She’s maternal like a nuclear arsenal is comforting. Great if it’s yours. Doom if it’s against you. “I’d ask what’s wrong, but the rumor mill is very efficient around here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wish you wouldn’t call me that name, but yes you may talk to me after you get out. You never answered Severus’ question, Potter.” He heard Tom say from somewhere to his left.
Charlie instantly had his wand out facing Bill as well.
Draco looked up as his mom walked out of the infirmary after three hours of working on Potter. “How is he?” he asked before she could say anything. Draco had been kicked out the minute he had brought her Potter and he was anxious to know what had happened and how he was. The image of finding Potter in a pool of his own blood would stay with him for a long time.
“Albus! Have you seen the Daily Prophet this morning?!” she yells waving it around.
“And I, George Weasley-”
The next morning, when breakfast had ended and the Malfoy’s, Tom and Aidan, and Severus, plus all of Draco and Aidan’s familiars, had adjourned to the sitting room, Harry got up clearing his throat. Draco, who was slightly snuggling into Aidan, looked up with a small pout wondering what he was up to.
“Well,” Draco says answering this question instead of the goblin. “Correct me if I’m wrong, but an inheritance ritual tells you everything that has been left to you, both by magic and by people. It is usually used after wars because whole families were killed off during them and purebloods used them to keep old families still living. Sirius must assume that you are the lord to more than just the Ancient and Noble houses of Black and Potter.”
“Hello Rita. Thanks for coming to meet me here.” Harry says sitting down when he gets the signal that she was sitting in front of him. Tom was in the kitchen checking out the Order’s plans that they had left behind when they had been kicked out, for the time being.
Neville looked shocked to be asked to do an inheritance ritual, but after some thought and a glance to Luna, he agreed. After they waited the necessary amount of time, they looked at the parchment and gasped.
“Mr. Potter. My name is Narcissa Malfoy. Can you explain what happened to you?”
AN: Sorry it's taken me so long to update. RL has been kicking my ass. This is my 4th of July treat to everyone. Hope everyone enjoyed their holiday and that they stayed safe!
When they apparated to Malfoy Manor it was quiet. Really quiet. Then there was the yell.
“No dragon, I would never marry you off to somebody you didn’t know. This person is very prominent in the community and will bump up our social status quite a bit.”
“Let me see.” Lucius replied, hand reaching out to take the paper from her hand.
“What’s the big story?” she says interest clear in her voice.
“And may your weapons stay sharp.” The goblin finished with a bow as well.
When it was placed in his hand he instantly put it on.
RS: (I was shocked) Did you know that blood quills are considered Class A Dark Arts torture devices? Why didn’t you tell anyone?
“That man!!! He-he-he-he-” the blonde was so mad, he was almost spitting. Aidan stopped him.
I'm so sorry for taking this long to update. I've just been so busy. Last week my dad got married and I was one of the bridesmaids in the wedding and school managed to get harder on top of that. This one is shorter than my others but I'm hoping to make it up to you with the next one.
“Are you calmer now?” Draco asked Harry when he came back a few hours later.
And in second year, it only took three second years half a year to figure out what was in there as well as where it was located. Even if Dumbledore couldn’t get in, he could’ve asked Harry to open it and then gone to fight the basilisk by himself.
To Andromeda Tonks, as the sole heir of the Noble and Ancient House of Black, I bring you back on the family tree. You have always followed the Black family motto, Toujours Pur, Always Pure. The proper motto was always pure of heart not blood like my mother tried to make everyone believe and follow. A feminine voice Harry had never heard before started to cry tears of joy.
AN: Updated 2-16-16 Happy Presidents Day (again)
Forever
A few minutes later, Narcissa burst into the room crying with a paper in her hands.
Once Tom had calmed down, Draco cleared his throat. “I still need to tell you two the results of the magical test. But before you do, the goblin and I agree that my lord, you and Harry should take a calming draught before we start. Believe me when I say you’ll need it.”
“Awww. Young love. It brings a tear to my eye.” The twins say with what Harry assumes – due to the movement of their magic body – is an overdramatized wipe away of a tear.
“Now can someone please explain to me why there are bandages on my eyes when, one, there are no bandages anywhere else on my body, and two, I’m not feeling any pain from my eyes.” Harry said getting frustrated with the bandages covering his head and also not liking the fact that he couldn’t see the ones he was talking to.
“Hedwig.” I say feeling her soft head. She moves my hand to something that feels like parchment and a quill.
“Okay, but you have to add the fact that I know she is an illegal animagus. She knows I know she is one.” Harry says finished with his food. "I guess that means relearning to cast will have to wait till later." he said as an afterthought.
“We don’t know my lord. The car was gone but most of his things were still there, which makes me think that they’ll come back sooner rather than later.” Severus answered for them since he was the last to leave the seen. “All of his school supplies were locked in the cupboard underneath the stairs. His wand, a photo album, and a blank parchment were all located underneath a board under his bead wrapped in his invisibility cloak.”
Magic Drain Spell – Albus Dumbledore
“I know, I’ll call you… Wait. Are you male or female?”
“My dear, I haven’t had a chance yet. I was going to as soon as I finished my tea. Lemon drop?” he asks looking at her confused. It wasn’t like her to be this loud.
They all apparated onto a quiet street. All the houses looked the same and completely muggle.
Aidan nodded to let his familiar know that he understood before turning to Draco and saying, “Come on Draco. We need to find your familiars and, I also apparently need to find another familiar since Cor can’t handle all of my power.”
“Yeah. I’ve wanted to call you that since I first heard your name. Let’s head towards the dining room. I’m starving.” Aidan added walking towards where he hoped the dining room was located.
Once the will reading was finished chaos erupted. The Weasleys, Granger and Dumbledore were all shouting loud enough that Harry flinched and fought not to cover his ears.
“Yeah.” Harry replied looking slightly to the left of where Draco was seated.
“Alright my boys,” Dumbledore said looking towards them, “You’ve had your fun but now it’s time to undo this prank. It really wasn’t nice of you two to throw people out of here without clothes on.”
“Dragon! You’re rambling. Calm down. I’m finished getting dressed so we can go to the Dining Room now.” Aidan said stopping the young Malfoy from speaking.
Tom, Draco, and the goblin smirk as well at the idea.
“Yes my lord.” Both Malfoys answered.
“Sorry. That’s going to take me awhile to get used to.” Aidan spoke sheepishly through the bond.
Harry woke up to the feeling of someone running their hand through his hair. He groaned and the hand stop. The first thing he realized was he wasn’t at his relative’s house. The second thing he realized was that he wasn’t in any pain and couldn’t see anything. He lifted a hand and felt bandages going around his eyes.
Aidan slowly went on one knee in front of Draco, who had both of his hands over his mouth in shock and had tears glistening in his eyes.
“Harry!” a bunch of voices said at once making him wince.
Harry had always been a twisted child, using his magic to make his relatives fear him at a young age. He had had to interfere and erase their memories because he had gotten too violent and The Boy Who Lived couldn’t be evil. He hoped the boy was dead because then he could get all the money in the Potter vaults and all the other vaults under the boy’s name. He had kept them from the boy so that when he died defeating Voldemort, they would all go to Dumbledore and the Weasleys especially when they had slipped a love potion to Harry for Ginny. Of course not all the Weasley’s knew about the plan, some were too close to the boy, like the twins, or some were too distanced like Bill and Charlie. Although, if the annoying brat was dead that would probably make the two youngest Weasleys and Granger mad because that would mean they weren’t going to get any money for keeping an eye on Potter. He would have to do some damage control to keep the public from rioting against him.
“My dear girl, whatever could be the problem?” he said trying to maintain his grandfatherly look even though he was extremely irritated with Molly to shout about any problems that the Order was having in public.
Draco agreed and they set out to find their familiars.
“All right,” she says with malicious intent clear in her voice, “I, Rita Skeeter, swear on my magic to not talk about this conversation or anyone that shows up to anyone without express permission from Harry Potter. I also swear to print exactly what Harry Potter tells me to in the light he tells me to and I will not tell anyone where I am.”
It took him down one aisle and a turned corner before he made it to the-
“Hello?” he called, trying to find someone who could tell him where he was since obviously someone had gotten the note that he had sent with Hedwig.
But don’t worry my young readers! This marriage contract won’t be loveless. When asked who exactly he would be marrying, a smile light up his face like none I’ve ever seen. He told me that he was going to marry ‘the light to his darkness’.
“That’s not all my lord,” Lucius added from his seat next to the fire in his office, “We found him in a room with locks up and down the door. I also looked at the pictures in the family room as we entered and there were no photos of him. All of the photos were of a walrus looking man who had to have been his uncle, a horse looking woman who must have been his aunt, and a boy who looked like a small baby whale.”
“She is a present from Draco.” He says looking at where Draco had his hand on his shoulder and reached an arm out to rest on his hip, pulling Draco closer and resting his head on Draco’s. “He said she was for protection. He didn’t want anything to happen to me.”
“Because, Ronald, unlike you, Draco has been a better friend to me in three days then you have been in four years. He is also helping me until I find a familiar, now that I am blind.” Here he went back to glaring at where he last heard Dumbledore’s voice. “I trust him more than I trust anyone here besides maybe two others, depending on certain things. Now, if there is nothing else to say I would be happy if you could escort me out.” He said turning towards Draco.
“C-c-can you please say that again?” Draco says stuttering.
“Dray!” Harry shouts as he crawls over to him. “Oh Merlin!” he says as he sees the damage done. A cutting curse had sliced through his stomach. The blood was pooling on the ground next to him and it was getting harder for him to breathe.
They then rush out to help the Order admits the cries of traitor from the Death Eaters as they saw Draco.
“Remus.” Harry said with no emotion in his voice. “It’s finally nice to hear you. We haven’t spoken since Siri died.” The monotone voice made Remus flinch even though Harry couldn’t see him.
“What marriage contract?”
“Whoa! Calm down a second Cissy. They just got engaged. We can check the marriage contract and sign it now so that someone like Dumbledore can’t try to coerce Aidan into marrying someone or trying to get his money.” Tom said trying not to laugh at the boys’ wide eyes at what Narcissa was saying. Lucius was also trying to hide his amusement at what his wife was saying.
He stopped in front of the cage and read the info tag aloud for Aidan’s benefit.
To Nymphadora Tonks, I cast you from the family line on the account of being non-faithful to the family line. I withhold the family magic to you making you lose your Metamorphmagus abilities. You could have had me freed at any time and you chose not to. We all know that Amelia Bones would have looked into it if you told her you had so much as a suspicion that I had not been given a trial. Instead, you listened to Dumbledore and didn’t tell anyone. Tonks screamed as her power was forcefully ripped from here. Her cries in pain lasted for a little bit before slowly subsiding.
Dumbledore was sitting in the Headmaster’s office, where the Order had been forced to move when Grimmauld Place wouldn’t let them in and Harry was nowhere to be found, drinking his tea when McGonagall burst through the door disrupting the meeting just about to start.
“Snow leopard. These rare, beautiful gray leopards live in the mountains of Central Asia. They are insulated by thick hair and their wide, fur-covered feet act as natural snowshoes. They have powerful legs and are tremendous leapers, able to jump as far as 15 meters.”
After moving to Lucius’ office in order to have a chance to talk about what they found, Voldemort asked, “Where are his relatives?”
PLEASE SEND HELP TO #4 PRIVET DRIVE.
“Drop that death eater spawn and go back to Ginny!”
“Hmmm. Aidan? We like it. It screams pureblood.” They said thinking over the name. “Okay, Aidan. How come you haven’t told them about what you and Sirius have been practicing? The Dark Lord especially would love it.”
Adopted Father’s Name
“Why the one and only Albus Dumbledore, of course?” Harry said with a sneer, “The only people who ever tried to do something about it were the twins and they’ve been blocked at every turn by Dumbdoor. The twins are just like me so it’s harder for them to get away with things with their mother watching over their every move.
“Harry……” he said hesitantly.
That is my will and testament. To all of the ones who got something or some helpful advice live, long and profit, or whatever that dude on the telly says. To the ones that didn’t get anything as nice or friendly, kiss my cold, dead, pale ass. That is all.
HDHDHDHDHDHD
There was a pause were nothing was said, then Draco opened his mouth.
“Like I said, the house elves know you are blind and filled your plate already.” Draco said to the unasked question. “On your plate there is eggs, scones, bacon, and pastries. To your right, next to your fork, is some jam.”
“WHAT!!!!” Tom said shocked.
Hermione,
She looked down and reread it again for the twentieth time.
“Luna are you…?” Aidan trailed off tilting his head and motioning with his hand to say what he couldn’t in public.
“I shall wait until you’re finished and have sent them off so that we may talk about Order business.” Dumbledore said taking down the privacy charm around the room.
The shop they walked into was a cacophony of sounds from snake hisses, kitten meows, bird calls, dog barks, and a bunch of other animal sounds from the many magical and nonmagical animals. The sounds made Aidan flinch due to his sensitive hearing.
“Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, blinded by those Dumbledore used to protect him.”
Harry woke up confused and disoriented. It was pitch black and he was confined in something. He started to panic and thrash around. He felt his magic start to swirl due to the fact that he couldn’t move.
the act of a conniving shrew out to commit line theft?
Tom ran towards the door and wrenched it open before Draco could even comprehend what was happening.
Prologue
Narcissa squealed, “Yay!! A wedding! We can have a December wedding and we can invite all the prominent members of the Dark community and we can do it in the garden here at the Manor and-”
“Mr. Potter, There is a person in the atrium saying that he was summoned to be here.” A new goblin voice said from his right where he knew the door to be.
‘loitering’, Hazza? From a philosophical point of view?” Draco asks, sitting up.
Unexpected sentiment aches in Harry’s throat at Draco’s tone. A loss he hadn’t let himself look at, but it’s gone as soon as it came, drowned out by the eager spectacle impaling itself on his cock.
The skid of his fingertips against the satin as they try and fail to grip the silky fabric.
The goblin lift operator clears his throat, and Harry flinches.
Stronger where Loyal.
His arms wrap around him. His hands run over Draco’s chest, and one reaches down and wraps around Draco’s wrist, halting his stroking. Draco whines and struggles against Harry’s grip.
Harry shrugs and lifts the shiny dome off his own tray, bracing himself for anything from broccoli mush to elegant cornish game hens and risotto. Sausage rolls. The good ones, with the croissant dough from Munchies, not the shitty canned dough from the cafeteria. And the good bangers, not the glorified hot dogs.
He casts a glance around for his shoes, and his bladder throbs instead. “I’m gonna take a piss and get my shoes and get out.”
“I was
“Yup!” Seamus hollers, throwing an arm over Neville. “Cuz Nev’s whipped!”
“Kreacher has updated household expenditures through 1997.”
His rucksack slides off his shoulder in his descent, tumbling off the end of the mattress. He lands face-down with a loud
A shuddering sigh escapes Harry’s nose, and Draco’s head flops back onto Harry’s shoulder. Draco hums contentedly, eyes on the ceiling. He licks his lips and blinks slowly, eyelashes tickling against Harry’s cheek. Again, his lips are so close, and it would be so easy, and maybe right, to just-
“I’ll pass that along to her when I get home,” Harry says. An amused huff sounds from the cell.
“Harry Potter would be wise to leave-”
Above him, Draco hums contentedly, hips tensing in a gentle rhythm. His hands cradle the sides of Harry’s head. Harry’s free hand wanders up Draco’s thigh, fingers exploring his arse, and he’s rather pleased to find his entrance slick and soft.
With a sheepish smile, Draco shifts his knees where they rest against the hard metal, and his hips rise off Harry’s lap, up in front of him. The tip of Draco’s cock breaks the surface of the water, and Harry moves without thinking, one hand wrapping round his base, and mouth moving forward.
I forget the
“I won’t starve,” Malfoy murmurs, picking up the leftover half of Harry’s sausage roll. His eyes track the heavy weight in the pocket of Harry’s robes, and he squints but doesn’t say anything.
Harry clears his throat and wiggles his arse on the pillow in encouragement, and Draco chuckles, burying his face against Harry’s foot.
”Shut up,” Harry mutters.
“Fuck it. Just do it.”
His knees wobble with relief, and he nearly collapses on the bed.
It’s fitting, in a morbid kind of way, he thinks, that a vault could literally be the safest place for someone to hide when the entire world is against him. Vaults are supposed to protect what the world deems valuable, not what it’s discarded.
It slams open, rebounds off the wall, and bounces back, halfway shut. Harry shoves the MimeoQuills into a desk drawer, slams it shut, and presses it closed for a moment.
The lower levels, he knows from previous forays, are all rough holes blasted into bedrock. The furthest down he’s been was the seventh level, though.
“Ho, ho! Potter, Potter, man who tamed the Weasley daughter!” Jenkins saunters through the heavy door like he owns the damn place, robes unbuttoned and shiny hair cascading down his shoulders. “Or tries to, eh?”
Malfoy closes his eyes, brow furrowed as he waits for the scorching pain. Harry’s thumb hovers over the split in his ash blond brow, and he frowns to himself. At himself.
The hawthorn wand is slick in Harry’s wet grasp as he hands it over. Draco takes it with the barest brush of fingertips and a heavy sigh.
“Everybody does.” Harry drops to his knees next to the cot, rubbing his thumb over his fingertips.
1039.
Harry can’t speak through a mouth that feels strangely gritty, and his feet might be stuck in quicksand, and that’s an embarrassingly slow way to drown.
His lips graze over Harry’s knuckles where one hand holds the newspapers, and Harry pulls him forward, nose to nose. Draco releases his wrists, and Harry’s hands find Draco’s waist, but only one of Draco’s hands wraps around his, warm through the silk.
is new.”
“What’s he gonna do? Sack me a second time?”
“Please stop talking.”
1037.
Wind rushes through his hair and assaults his eyes as he falls. He throws the box and grips his wand in both hands, and his last thought is a wish that the origami crane doesn’t fly away without him.
“Try what?”
Questions skitter through Harry’s mind as he steps out, but all of them are thinly-veiled rebuttals or attempts to fling blame where it doesn’t belong. Because the goblin isn’t wrong.
“Hazza, I believe I need a bath.”
Scalding, electric magic snaps around him and knocks the wind out of him as it catches him. The spell lifts him on an upward wind-tight sail of power, and his feet slide back up onto the ledge. The vault handle is the most solid thing he’s ever felt. The prickle of adrenaline over his skin subsides in a clammy rush, and his heartbeat gradually leaves his throat to settle back in his chest. His hand pats his back pocket, still packed with rolled papers and Draco’s wand, despite the tumble.
“Bubble guuuuuuummmm,” Neville sings into the drain.
Reassignment. Fucking hell, Robards was putting him in the field. And not boring patrol duties like Adams. No, Harry Potter was too high-profile for that. If he was to be seen in uniform, it would be on the dangerous cases. Maybe even loaned out to the ICW or MACUSA.
1039.
“Heard your bitch turned out to be quite a guard dog, eh?”
His eyes open just a bit when Draco slides the pillow out from under his hips, and he catches a glimpse of him with the fluffy white duvet bundled around his shoulders. With a soft
He moves silently, peeking through door after door, each room a useless space inhabited only by sheet-draped furniture. Not the last one, though.
“Mm?” His elbow is bent over his eyes, Dark Mark against his temple. His other hand rests low on his exposed abdomen, fingers tucked in the waistband of his briefs.
“-before Kreacher counts to three and does as he was told.”
Words flee under a hot rush down Harry’s chest that lodges in his cock. Memories cascade down: a slick tongue opening him, fingertips pressing inside, the wet heat of Draco’s mouth around his cock as his fingers coax Harry’s body.
“Oh?”
like to cook, just not for him. Maybe it’s her St. Pancras’ Garden.
Green flames deposit him somewhere, in someone’s home. He turns, perhaps noticing the inside of the fireplace for the first time. It’s clean. The faint tarry smell of creosote buildup in the chimney is gone, and no ashes or soot grit under his shoes.
Heat blooms against his thumb as the salve makes contact with Malfoy’s skin, and twin sharp gasps echo off the tile walls. The flesh doesn’t heal so much as flow back together under his touch. Muscles bunch in the corners of Draco’s jaw as he grits his teeth against the sear of knitting flesh.
“She told Ron,” Harry states, tongue sticking to the roof of his mouth.
“It’s alright, Harry.”
He wishes he could cry. She’d stop yelling if he could just cry, but it never works like that. He might cry. Later. Somewhere safe. Maybe years later, if there’s nowhere safe between now and then.
, and that makes all the difference.
Harry casts a sidelong glance at her, but she merely rustles her skirts and closes her eyes. Relieved, he shoves the bedroom door open.
“Did you write
Draco draws a deep breath, and Harry watches the light hit the scars over Draco’s ribs, just a touch smoother than the skin around them.
“Goddammit, Kreacher, it’s my fucking-”
The noon-day sun is the night shifter’s midnight moon, and the bright light makes his eyes drift shut as he shambles into Gringotts and zombie-walks his way toward the lift. His vault is a larger one on an upper level. The halls there are polished black and tan granite, like somebody shook a glass of Guinness, froze it, and spent a lifetime buffing it to a high sheen.
at the threshold of his home. Here, where he should be welcomed with open arms, not held at arm’s length.
With that, his house-elf turns and leaves him standing outside the gate of his own property. At a loss, Harry finds a park bench, a coffee cart, and fills up on greasy, over-salted noodles that are nothing short of perfect. And maybe watching kids gambol through the park before school is preferable to another screaming match with Ginny, anyway.
“Section 12.8, Part C, Ministry Record Retention and Duplication Policy, Potter.”
you get in and out of Gringotts at, what, four AM?”
“So… you meet men in alleys?”
The library is its usual musty self, wingback chairs and table in their usual positions. The fireplace sits cold with decades of disuse. Neither Harry nor Ginny have ever needed or wanted a library.
And it should be freezing, but it’s already warming up. It should be off-putting in every way, but the mattress is soft under his knees, and the sheets are silk or satin and gleam like gold under his fingers.
The temperature dial in the fridge is turned up too warm, and he turns it back down. Neat stacks of leftovers in Tupperware take up an entire shelf, and he grabs one to inspect the contents. Some kind of chicken and vegetables that, frankly, smell amazing.
He can cry for what could have been, and he can cry for what shouldn’t be. And he does.
Robards’ arm draws back, and Harry flinches, but he merely tosses a stapled packet of papers on top of Harry’s folded robes. His shower kit and other belongings are in a small box on Harry’s hip already. The packet is open to one of the middle pages, and he fights a smirk.
“Awful cheeky for a man with an arsefull.”
, relaxing to the point of questioning reality. A firm squeeze around his toes brings him back to Earth.
The paper crane in his robe pocket is lighter than air and a suffocating weight, but he can’t get rid of it. Something about that pocket staying empty feels wrong, even if everything he puts in it tends to feel like an indictment.
“I swear to Merlin...”
“Why would Adams put your wand in Robards’ office? He’s not due in ‘till morning.”
“What are you smiling about?” Draco asks, coming into the living room.
Good versus evil. Kindness, not cruelty. Mercy over vengeance. And love.
It’s not the quiet that’s arousing, in and of itself, but the things he can still hear. His own breathing, a touch heavier with each thrust.
“You did?”
His heart thunders in his chest, calming as his breathing slows. His fingers run lines up his torso, painting streaks. What would it feel like to lay on his back and have Draco ride him? And wrap his legs around Harry’s hips? And lift himself up and drive himself down on Harry’s cock as they both came?
“Do you want to?” Harry asks, lips against the slick skin of Draco’s neck. Harry’s finger slips down Draco’s crevice, and fingers sift through Harry’s wet hair.
He slides forward, sitting on the end of the cot, facing Harry, and the forkful on its way to Harry’s mouth slows as Draco watches him. “Uhm… do you want some?” he offers.
Draco’s eyelids flutter open. “Something right?”
Throat tight, he swallows as tears burn against his eyes. Not for himself. He can’t cry for himself yet. But he can cry for Draco, who’s in a jail cell bigger than his entire home.
Is it Harry’s bedroom, or Draco’s? Or
“The goblins. The elves,” the goblin says, nearly a growl. “The makers and keepers of your world protect him.” The grate screeches open. “Because you and yours have not.”
The scent of the vault hits him before the
It’s impossibly soft against his chin and his lips, and he nuzzles into its scent, lips nipping the satin up and pressing the peaks back down.
A chuckle shakes Harry’s chest as he releases Draco’s ankles and prepares to meet his death at the hands of a soggy blond. Draco’s legs fold, knees on either side of Harry’s thighs as he rights himself with unexpected dignity.
“Thanks, mate. Love a good dress-down at report. Anything interesting?”
Harry’s sharp laugh melts into a ribcage-rattling groan as he tenses, except for his arse, which welcomes the intrusion. The thick head of Draco’s cock passes over Harry’s prostate, and Harry’s cock throbs in his hand.
A soft smile makes moisture collect in the corners of Draco’s eyes, and he sniffs, hands running up and down Harry’s calves. “I missed you, too.”
It doesn’t turn. Doesn’t even rattle. Why would it?
1045. There’s no fucking wreath on the door.
Harry peeks around Adams as he locks the cell door. “Nev, don’t vomit in the drain, or I’ll have to give you a SoberUp. Rules.”
“Always do.”
“Oo, let me see.” Draco makes grabby hands at the book, before stopping with a scowl as he spots the undecipherable script of the Hindi language when Harry turns the page to face him with a teasing, “Sure, go ahead.”
He had unwittingly pissed all over those letters. Irony, a blunt weapon.
Rather than his usual insolent bow, Kreacher steps into the room, jet black eyes fixed on Harry. Tension in his upper lip hints at an oncoming snarl.
Kreacher’s ears flick in annoyance as he accepts the container. “Kreacher quite prefers a proper Pureblood head of house.”
Straightening to his full, unimpressive height, Kreacher fixes him with another glare. “Harry Potter will not enter. But Kreacher will deliver your apology.”
“Two.”
“Fuck, fuck,
A second eardrum-rattling pop, and Harry stretches his jaw. “What the bloody hell was that?”
“Don’t think about them.” A smirk tugs at the corners of his lips.
The Floo powder clings to his clammy palm, but he knows just where to hide something valuable.
There’s a fucking
Coffee dribbles onto Hermione’s shirt as she chuckles mid-sip. “So I heard. She could do worse than a loudmouthed Muggle banker, I suppose. I believe they’re going out tonight.”
“I just…” Harry sighs and his thighs part to the touch between his legs. “You’re redecorating my house and baking and planting fucking roses?”
His Muggle kitchen appliances are unchanged, unscathed by whatever had happened here a few days ago. He pauses while opening the fridge.
Sheer white curtains billow out of the living room windows, waving like a kerchief salute, and the breeze brings a whiff of something cooking in the kitchen. Garlic, chicken, and herbs he doesn’t know the names of, but associates with soup.
Malfoy nips breading off the sausage before answering. “Robards offered me the opportunity to resign. Offered it rather strongly.”
Walking to the door is effortless, like it was always meant to be. Like he was never meant to be in this department, or in those robes, and it was all someone else’s idea.
Jenkins isn’t
“Kreacher,” Harry responds, just as neutrally.
In a snit, Malfoy rolls to sitting, blond bedhead looking for all the world like a startled white peacock.
“Gin?” Harry calls up the stairs, but is only met by the familiar grumble of an inconvenienced house-elf.
” Harry huffs, eyes wide.
“Mm hm. Not for shower sex, though.”
A knock sounds at the door, and Robards rolls his eyes. “Sign off on the termination agreement. One copy’s yours, the other is the department’s.” His fingers flick at two stapled packets on the edge of the desk. “I have to go deal with this. See yourself out.”
From the bathroom, a metallic pattering, reminiscent of hail on a tin roof, fills the room. It’s an out-of-place sound in the city; more suited to huts and cottages, in fields and forests, in a Burrow in Devon.
“Fine,” Harry huffs, “but don’t open it here. Let’s go inside and do it proper.”
He slams the door shut the rest of the way—Kreacher’s unofficial summoning spell. The answers will be worth the death threats, but… silence.
A teasing nip of teeth along the crease of his arse pulls a whimper from him. It’s been years, an eternity, since anyone-
"No. I... am honoring our brave law enforcement officers."
” Harry mutters. “With you.
Harry flicks the feathered end of the quill across his lips, and the others wave absently in the air. After Draco’s resignation from the DMLE, Harry hadn’t heard his name cross anyone’s lips. Not even his own.  Especially not his own.
. Grimmauld Place has never been
“Uh… You’re all pissed off your arses?”
Walburga is snoring as he creeps down the hall, on the watch for Kreacher. His curiosity outweighs the possibility of being mauled to death by a house-elf, and he tip-toes across dusty floorboards. The upstairs damage appears to have been relegated to the bedroom and bathroom.
a citation?”
The corners of Adams’ lips pinch tight before he speaks. “Robards wants to see you in his office.”
“Where’s your wand?”
On the shelf below the encyclopedias, the Bible, Talmud, Quran, the Vedas, and Sutras all sit, and he pulls several out. All of them have pages dog-eared, and Harry spreads them out over the thick blue velvet. On each folded-down page, a passage is underlined, sometimes more than one, and Harry skims through them.
“Fuck, I missed you.” The body in his arms relaxes, and Harry’s finger presses into Draco’s entrance. “And
Trays float down the hall, glinting in the light, and Harry and his stomach both grumble, but for entirely different reasons. The steel platters clunk down; one on his desk and one on the floor in front of Malfoy’s cell.
The last one is lime, and the children in the book find a cave as Harry falls asleep, book in hand.
The papers on his desk catch his eye, and he picks up the quill with a furtive glance down the hall.
One of Draco’s feet pushes under Harry’s balls, destined for his arse, and that’s quite enough.
The house is silent as he ducks out of the fireplace. His first step almost costs him his balance as his shoe sinks into a plush rug, and his empty hand darts out to rest fingertips on the mantle. An enormous, thick-pile expanse of scrolling yellow roses on a sky blue background hushes his footfalls and keeps his attention until he’s at the edge of it.
1043.
“Whatever,” Adams grumbles. “You can finish the paperwork, Potter. Wilson and I are going back to put wards on that alley. It’s been an issue for months.”
"Nothing. Shut up, Potter. Your voice is better in my head."
“Hm.” Malfoy skims a bare foot back and forth between the bars. “So, it is.”
It’s eons and milliseconds before Draco draws a breath to answer, and a bead of water makes its way from his hair, down his forehead, to dangle off his nose just above Harry’s face.
The potatoes turn bitter in his mouth, and Harry puts the lid on the Tupperware and pushes it away. Reynolds’ stack of forms is a welcome distraction as he lays them all out.
Storm-grey eyes bore into him as though they can glare the answer out of him without having to kick him under an imaginary table.
He’s on the ledge and side-stepping over the narrow path before the words vaguely make sense:
It’s not his throbbing erection trapped between his skin and satin that wakes him up so much as the impulse to hide it.
“You’ve got your wand-”
“More,” Draco mouths against Harry’s hair. “Oh, God, just fuck me.”
, he dares ask,” Draco quips, rolling his eyes and finishing off the sausage roll.
“Which I haven’t used in years. It’d be a shame to overshoot and hex this glorious bearskin rug right off-”
Adams oozes burnt coffee, stale cigarettes, and impatience. He steps behind Harry’s desk and starts pulling out forms. Harry hands him a fresh file folder.
The slick, sticky slide of his foreskin as his cock reaches that final hardness.
Draco groans. “That’s too hard, Harry. Kiss me already.” Harry’s answering laugh is swallowed by said soft lips, and he kisses back with a groan. They break apart, panting lightly, Harry’s gaze unabashedly roaming Draco’s face once more.
He swallows against the lump in his throat, and Draco nuzzles into his shoulder.
He opens the box with a creak and angles it to examine the stolen rings inside. One is ornate silver filigree, tarnished from centuries spent in a packed, opulent vault that won’t miss it. The other is a plain, scuffed gold band snatched out of a Burrow dresser drawer last Yule.
The jewelry box was in his pocket in the lift on the way down to Malfoy’s vault. Was it there on the way up? Bloody hell. It had to have fallen out of his jeans in the vault.
The portraits in the hall snort themselves awake and shuffle restlessly as Harry walks, and he braces himself as he nears the door to their bedroom. His bedroom? Her bedroom? But it’s not the bedroom itself that makes him nervous, it’s the portrait that
A thick coating of dust lines the edges of the floor, and he wonders how long it’s been since he or Ginny cleaned anything. They’d certainly never gotten around to redecorating.
Muffled in the sumptuous fabric, a long, exhausted groan trickles through his nose. Bloody lucky Malfoy’s in DMLE custody, or Harry’s day would have been spent trying to sleep in a rented room above the Leaky during the lunch rush.
“He-” Harry gulps, and it’s all snails and shell shards and slime. “He did that because I wanted to bottom?”
“This is not Harry Potter’s home,” Kreacher growls.
“Ron! We gotta go back for Ron!” Dean lurches toward the hall door, but Adams yanks him back by the collar.
Draco’s tongue traces along the seam between them, asking, seeking, and Harry’s chin tilts up in offering. A breaking moan vibrates Harry’s chest, and it takes a full breath for him to realize that it’s coming from Draco, who’s pressed himself along Harry’s front.
Sapphire silk sleeves slide down his arms with minimal effort on his part, and the robe is a bit long, and it doesn’t quite close over his chest as he ties the belt. It’s better because it doesn’t fit, and because it isn’t his, and because he didn’t choose it. It’s better because he doesn’t know where it came from, and he can simply enjoy it without knowing.
“Mm hm.” Draco’s fist around his cock moves in time to Harry’s slow thrusts, and his hole tightens around Harry’s length with each stroke. “Oh, fuck, that’s good.”
“I… No,” Harry admits, leaning back on his knees, eyes fixed to the tin in his hands. “Did you?”
Dust sifts down from the wicker above his face, and he grips the door handle as a sneeze brews. Between his own hitching preparatory sniffs, the handle clicks, unlocking.
Harry pauses in spreading the forms out, one MimeoQuill on each paper. “You
He turns to take in the other wall, and it isn’t any less impressive or more logical. Pokemon graphic novels, three translations of the Iliad, a mishmash of Bibles, the Vedas, Agatha Christie, the Talmud, Octavia Butler, a Quran, the Sutras, Lovecraft, Dawkins, and absolute scads of Star Trek paperbacks.
“With their little paws-” Draco’s eyes shoot open, mouth in a perfect O as his head disappears underwater in a flail and a wet
Harry’s stomach growls, and he spends the rest of his shift thinking about ginger chicken lo mein.
“You… didn’t quit?”
Harry’s hips thrust up against his hands through layers of slick satin and down-filled velvet. His hands knead into the thick comforter, pressing against his hard cock.
The velvet box leaches the warmth around it like a black hole against his chest.
“Perfect.” Harry answered, “But make it so the twins, and Bill can’t be forced to pay back the debt. I know that at least Dumbledore, Ron, and Ginny will try to force them. Molly might not be as forceful but I know she would try.”
“All right, Draco you can show yourself now.” Harry said looking to the general direction of where Draco had said he would be.
Innocent Bystander or Line Theft Mastermind?

“What is that snake doing around your neck?” A witch said from somewhere behind Harry.
After Draco helped him find the bathroom and pick his clothes, something distinctly soft and silky-it was probably some of Draco’s clothes but he wasn’t going to complain- he helped Harry find the dining room.
“ALBUS, Albus come quickly to headquarters. Something’s wrong.” Molly shouted as she ran down the street to him.
“And what note, young Malfoy, could be so important that you had to interrupt my meeting?” the Dark Lord softly asked, his voice intimidating despite its softness.
“Tom is here? I need to talk to you whenever you get a chance.” Harry said to the room since he didn’t know where Tom was.
“Are you kidding me?!” Draco said shocked, “If I hadn’t acted been mean to the Weasel, then you would’ve been a Slytherin? You’re like the epitome of a Gryffindor!”
“Sure. As you know, my godfather died last year. Sometimes I’d have nightmares about it and I would wake up screaming. This time when I screamed, I woke up my uncle and he taught me a lesson about how ‘freaks’ shouldn’t wake up ‘normal’ people. I got tired of playing ‘nice Harry’, so I snapped back. He didn’t like that.” He said with little emotion.
“Dumbledore put a lot of blocks onto him. They’ve obviously been on there for a while. It’s going to take a while for the goblins to take them all off.” Draco said trying to be the voice of reason even though he didn’t like it any more.
We here at Gringotts have had a most grievous mistake. We have found out that you have been stolen from. All of your vaults have had a substantial amount of money taken from them by: a Mr. Albus Percival Wolfric Brian Dumbledore, a Miss Hermione Jean Granger, a Mr. Ronald Billius Weasley, a Mr. Arthur Weasley, a Miss Ginevra Weasley, and a Mrs. Molly Weasley. We would like for you to come in a few hours ahead of Mr. Sirius Orion Black’s will reading. Since we haven’t received a confirmation for his will or been told that you aren’t going, we would like to tell you now that you are cordially invited to Mr. Sirius Orion Black’s will on July 20th. Please reply before then. When you reply, please say whether or not you can show up a few hours earlier to deal with the theft.
Sighing he shook his head, that wasn't up to him . He took a book from the shelf that had magically appeared as soon as he thought about getting some reading done in the mean time. It was a book on meditation and control of magic, as he'd taken to reading lately and sat down on a chair near the bedside reading, waiting for her to wake up.
Daxia looked down uttering a laugh so sad it pulled at Harry's heart. She shook her head as if reprimanding herself for something, "That's just it isn't it. Why do I care, I shouldn't I know I shouldn't but I can't help it because I love you " she said tears now falling freely from her eyes. Harry breadth in sharply at her declaration.
Harry felt a gentle touch at his arm, he looked down to see Daxia touching his arm looking at him with worry, he shook himself out of those thoughts he tried to give her a reassuring smile which judging by her expression wasn't much reassuring " because no one helped me, and I know what that feeling is to feel completely alone and helpless and because you've already suffered enough."
Harry by then was completely bewildered " like what ? "
She narrowed her eyes at him before muttering " Brilliant"  voice acidic and full of sarcasm. Harry  raised an eyebrow a habit he had unconsciously picked up from her. " What's wrong?" He finally asked instead of skirting around the issue anymore.
"Hey" Harry turned to look at the source of the voice from where he sat at the garden swing lost in thoughts.
From then on over the years it had become a habit to watch her, he couldn't help it. At first it was because he couldn't understand the complete turn about in her behavior over the night. But then as the years passed it felt like it was his responsibility because now five years later when he thought back to that night with a clear perspective and not the naive innocence of a 11 year old it disturbed him, how she'd stared down so longingly, her words made a different kind of sense now and this year she came to Hogwarts looking like death warmed over.
" Potter" Dudley called " Did you really believe she liked you. It was a bet we made, if Gracie could fool you into going to a date with her. Who could like you Potter. You'll always be a freak."
she was becoming more and more distressed as days passed. Harry watched helplessly as she seemed to be collapsing in on herself. He'd tried to find out what was going on but he still had no clue. He was sure it had something to do with Voldemort. It wasn't a secret anymore that Lucius Malfoy was a deatheater and she was his daughter, he didn't entirely know what that entailed for her but he did know that it wasn't anything good.
“So where were his relatives?” Voldemort asked Lucius and Severus.
“Now, James and Lily Potter are not actually my parents. They are my adopted parents. My parents are actually dark.” Here he looked at the twins for their reaction, hoping that it would be a good one.
“Sure.” She says smiling knowingly.
“Swear to never tell anyone a thing we are told today without explicit permission from those in the room with us.”
“Life’s good! How’s our silent backer? Fell in love yet?” They ask looking at his hand, where he hadn’t let go of Draco’s hand yet.
“Mother, what has you so happy?”
Potions:
/Of course, I can. I am your familiar. That’s why I bit you and took some of your blood. As the bond grows, you should even be able to see through my eyes occasionally and even hear through me. You know you could just talk to me through the bond without speaking out loud./
/I am male./
“WHAT??!!!!” the twins yell and faced towards the only one not familiar in the room.
Draco cleared his throat and hesitantly started.
All day there were reporters, wizards, witches, and photographers waiting around Gringotts so that when Harry showed up, they could offer him their support.
Chapter 3
“Avada Kedavra!” Voldemort said as Harry shouted Stupefy.
HP: Well, first I will be getting a familiar so that I am protected without Draco always hovering around me. Next, I’m going to ask for a resort. In first year I was supposed to be in Slytherin, but I talked the hat out of it. Hopefully I’ll get it again so that Draco and I won’t be as easily separated.
“Well I would but the whole blind thing is kind of working against me on this one,” Aidan stated dryly as he finally found the latch and opened the door for the animal that was to become his familiar. He gasped as the wolf-like creature nipped his hand hard enough to draw blood before lapping it up and barking.
“Master be’s in his office along with Dark Lord, sir. They’s be in a meeting.”
“What do you think about Aidan actually being the son of the Dark Lord?” Fred finally asks after a pause in the conversation.
Dear Mr. Potter,
Boy Saviour or Brutalized Scapegoat?
“Georgie wake up.” He shouted as he threw a pillow at his twin on the way out the bedroom.
Without saying anything, all pointed towards the back office. No one wanted to have the combined ire of the BWL and the Ancient House of Malfoy on them.
An arched eyebrow and a pause in his wand batting game are Harry’s only warning before toes wiggle between his balls and his thigh.
None?
“Last one to come sleeps in the wet spot.”
The darkness and silence are absolute and perfect.
you-”
Steam rises from tender pieces of chicken and roasted root vegetables that still have just enough of a snap to them. The gravy is the real show-stopper, and similar enough to Molly’s pot pie filling that it’s likely Ginny used her mother’s recipe and neglected to make a crust. It certainly doesn’t suffer for the lack of pastry.
The carryout bag feels too light for as stuffed as it is, and he has a vague memory or sense of deja vu of dropping noodles on the pavement near the iron garden gate outside Grimmauld Place. And maybe he did.
“Tenth level,” he says, his own vault forgotten for the moment.
Blinking in the growing brightness, Harry shakes his head. The thick velvet curtains are gone, replaced by sheer, gauzy white ones that are neatly tucked to the sides of the windows. It’s
“I’ve never unholstered at work,” he whispers to himself.
But maybe slipping Malfoy’s wand into his vault is a start at reparations, both for himself and the rest of wizarding society.
“Coming in, then?”
“Fuck,” Seamus groans, laying down on the cot. “That’s why I’m staying here. Daphne’d have my balls if I went home this pissed.”
Harry’s grin is lop-sided as he settles the wreath in Draco’s hair. The medley of colorful cranes is a cheerful halo against the drab woven vines and his pale hair. Draco catches Harry’s wrists as his hands pull away from the crown.
“Hm?” Draco moves Harry’s foot higher, toes breaking the surface of the water below Draco’s chin. “Oh. Simon?”
No snails fall from his mouth, and he’s absurdly proud, but he still makes note of where the waste bin sits. Just in case.
“I’m going to make biscuits in the morning. Then settle up household accounts at Gringotts. And plant roses, weather permitting. Why?”
like fanny.”
“Hey, yourself,” she says with a raised eyebrow. “I thought I’d best drop by on my way home and make sure my husband isn’t behind bars.”
“Phht, no. It was trying to drive you out. The wallpaper should have clued you in. Or Kreacher.”
The carrots are the best: soft on the outside, but almost still crunchy in the middle, cut to perfect bite-size pieces. The orange carrots are good, but the yellow ones are divine, and gone entirely too soon.
The damn feet in his crotch move with intention, one of them stroking his hardening cock while the other holds it steady.
Harry wipes his nose on his sleeve and puts the wreath back on his head. The handle clicks, and he turns it with a well-oiled skid of metal on metal.
Grey eyes hold steady on the crane, unblinking.
Harry’s own hands wipe water away from his eyes, and he blinks at the blurry pale form in front of him. Steam, streaming water, and pale skin meld into one astigmatism-inspired man-shape.
Harry huffs out a laugh and bites down on Draco’s shoulder none too gently. “No, never did get used to that, actually.” His hands slide up to Draco’s nipples for a firm tweak that elicits a yelp. “These are just fine. Something else.”
“It’s
? Already?
“Potter, get the cell door,” Adams barks.
“Harry Potter should leeeaave,” he sings, menace in the drawn-out note.
Maybe Malfoy won’t notice it, and he can pop back over when his shift ends in twelve hours. He can be in and out in twenty minutes, take it back to Grimmauld Place, and… get kicked out of his own house again? Maybe rent a room above the Leaky, with its convenient blowjob alley right outside?
“ गुदगुदी । Tickle.”
It takes a half-hour and a mile walk before he realizes his feet are headed to St. Pancras’. Russel Gardens off to his left is the halfway point, and he pauses to consider what the St. Pancras’ mausoleums and tombstones will look like if he arrives after the sun sets. Another mile and a half, and he could be somewhere quiet, at the very least. Somewhere the living won’t bother him, but where the eerie silence might be worse.
“Why didn’t you tell anyone about the abuse, brat?” Someone who sounded suspiciously like Snape snapped.
“Yes, Uncle Sev.” Draco said as he shifted so he wasn’t in the puddle of blood but was still sitting close enough on the floor to support Potter’s head. After Snape had poured the potion down Potter’s throat, he rubbed his throat to make sure that Potter swallowed and didn’t choke on the potion.
HP: Yeah. Peter Pettigrew is an illegal animagus. His form he used to escape is a rat. Don’t you think it was strange that he was destroyed so badly that all that was left of him was a finger? If you don’t believe me look up the records. Sirius never got a trial.
“Not doing very well. She hasn’t left their room and hasn’t stopped crying. She’s acting like their dead.”
“Let me see if I can get in, Molly, my dear.” Dumbledore said with a sparkle in his eyes.
“Well, Heir Potter, may I call you Harry?” after getting a nod from him, Narcissa continued, “There is some bad news. After healing all of you, I found out that your eyes have been too damaged for me to fix. You are permanently blind and will not be able to see again. Magic can fix much but it can’t fix everything.” Narcissa said sadly, still upset that she couldn’t get him up to one hundred percent.
AN: Hey all my readers!!! I know that you all have been waiting and begging for the next chapter, so here it is!!! This is my birthday present to all of you since today is my birthday!! I can’t believe it’s already been two years since I started this fanfic. I hope that I will be able to finish this fanfic. I hope everyone is enjoying their summer. I don’t know how long it’ll take me to write the next chapter but hopefully it won’t be terribly long.
“Okay everybody.” Harry heard Draco say, “We really need to get going. The will reading happens in a few minutes and we have to be there on time.”
“He’s brainwashed you into leaving the light!”
Aidan instantly blushed and stuttered while Draco looked at him questioningly.
“Great.” Harry could hear the smile in Tom’s voice. “You will take a shrunken Nagini with you until you get your familiar. After the reading, you will go get a familiar with Draco. If, for whatever reason, it’s located in Knocturn Alley take this bracelet and anyone who is either a Death Eater, or a Dark supporter will see it and know that you are under my protection.”
“Okay guys, stop teasing Draco.” Harry said wrapping an arm around Draco’s shoulder
That made Neville go quiet and pensive, thinking about what she had just said.
Fred woke to knocking on his and George’s apartment door.

“What do you mean ‘finally come to claim your inheritance’? I thought I couldn’t claim it because my father was still alive and Grandmother would never give it to me early.” Neville said confused.
“Let’s first start with the heir rings because they usually take a little less out of you than the lord rings.” The goblin said and the three humans agreed.
Dumbledore’s eye twitched before he took a deep breath and slid his grandfatherly persona back onto his face.
“How did this happen?” he asked trying not to get a headache from her voice.
Lord Black (Black Will)
Quickly he responded to the letter and got dressed, trying to dismiss his worries. Nagini was with Harry and would protect him from any harm.
reveals the savagery he endured for years at the hands
Personality Change Potion – 60%
HP: Yes. I’m sorry for the secrecy but I don’t want anyone to know where I am until I’m ready for it.
“Harry. I’m so glad we were able to catch up with you. We just wanted to tell you that we were with you one hundred percent of the way. Dumbledore, the Nonames and Granger went too far.” Neville said when they finally got close enough.
“You are welcome. It was you two who helped me out when I first entered this world so I just returned the favour.”
There was a pause were nothing was said, then Draco opened his mouth.
Lucius and Tom exchanged smiles happy about Draco’s reaction to the paper. They were happy that he actually meant it when he said he cared and wasn’t just being pressured into the engagement. Narcissa had already known about Draco’s love for Aidan, but she couldn’t even think about that because of her anger for what was written in the Prophet.
Birth Name
“What did you want to talk to me about?” Tom said as he looked at Harry.
“Hello there,” Draco added as he mimicked Aidan by kneeling down and letting the snow leopard cub sniff and then nip his hand. It was a silver white colour with black spots and the brightest glowing blue eyes ever seen.
“Aidan, do you know what that is?” Draco said as he saw Aidan start to feel around for a latch.
HP: (he shook his head at me) No. He had the intention of killing Peter, he is a Black after all, but he didn’t get a chance to. Peter yelled something off about him betraying my parents and then blew up the street. He then cut off his finger and went down in the sewer with all the other rats.
“Thank you.” The twins said sincerely, “No one else has ever been able to figure that out before. You are our true sibling.”
“So, now that we’ve made sure that this year will be the worst thing to ever happen to Dumblefuck, Ronald, Ginevra, and the Mudblood; why don’t we finally go get you your familiar?” Draco said smiling while dragging Aidan towards Knockturn Ally.
He knew he should’ve made Harry write a will. The goblins wouldn’t let anyone touch a dead person’s money unless it was written in the will they could. That’s why he couldn’t touch Sirius Black vaults. He had to wait to see what he was given in the will. The confundus charm he had placed on Sirius should have worked and if not that, then the loyalty potion would have worked. Harry couldn’t be there either, just in case he got something major.
HP: (Harry snorts here) Umbridge was an evil bitch. Her classes were all theoretical and we learned nothing. We couldn’t complain though or else we would get punished. Her punishments included writing with a blood quill until the saying was permanently scarred on our hands.
“The abuse had to have been happening since he was at least seven, maybe even before that. The malnourishment has definitely been happening since he was a baby.” Narcissa said starting to pull herself together, grief still evident in her tone. She had been unable to have another child after Draco due to complications and the thought of someone not wanting and abusing a baby caused her pain in her heart.
“Portkey home and get him to Narcissa. I’ll follow with his stuff.” Snape said as he handed Potter to Draco.
Draco gasped looking at the ring. It was beautiful. The dragon looked so lifelike, it was amazing.
“How could it go so wrong? Ever since Sirius’ will- That’s it!! Lily and James will! We made sure to have the marriage contract written in their will!! I’ll just have to unseal it.” Dumbledore smiled and penned a quick note to send to Gringotts. Things were finally on the right track.
After taking a minute for Aidan to get used to the noise, Draco guided Aidan towards the center of the store before allowing Aidan to let his magic guide him.
It was the day of the final battle.
After he finished reading their letter, he thought deeply about what he was going to do. He finally decided to talk to Bill before officially deciding to go back. He strode towards the Floo, hoping to catch up with Bill before he went to bed.
“Ok. I will call you… Regina. Because you are the queen in my life. My most important player in my heart and on my chessboard.” Draco decided.
“It’s nothing. Let’s just go.” Aidan said gesturing towards where he assumed Knocturn Alley was located.
RS: (Readers. I have to say I was shocked. Harry Potter, our saviour, a Slytherin?) You were supposed to go to Slytherin? The house full of dark and evil wizards?
“Oh,” Harry said, “Do you know if the house elves at Hogwarts do the same?” he asks genuinely curious.
“Draco!” his father said surprised and slowly getting angry about being interrupted while in a meeting.
“Yes,” he said, his hand twitching towards his wand. “Like I told the goblin. I was summoned to the room that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are in.”
“Aidan!” Tom called when he saw Draco and Aidan home with their new familiars. “I need to talk to you about something you wanted me to do for you.”
It’s Gred and Forge here. How’s the dragons? Amazing we guess. Anyways, with the fun stuff out of the way, we have some news. We’re positive, you have gotten a letter from our dear insane mother bitching about Sirius’ will reading. To set the record straight, yes we did estrange ourselves from our mother, and yes, Harry now speaks to Slytherins but there is a reason for this. Reasons that cannot be explained in a letter. We advise you to come back to England under the guise of thinking about joining the Order. If you do come down, bring Bill with you so that we can talk all together.
Trust Potion – 50% (keyed to: Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, Albus Dumbledore, Molly Weasley, Arthur Weasley)
“Arthur my dear boy, how is dear Molly?” Albus said as Arthur walked into the Headmaster’s office for another Order meeting.
HP: It’s a long story. Contrary to popular belief, I wasn’t raised by a loving family, I was raised by my relatives. They hated that they were forced to look after me, I was treated worse than a house elf. I was beaten and starved and for the first ten years of my life, I lived in a broom closet underneath the stairs.
“Hello?” He called out, trying to get a response from the person who had obviously just been running their hand through his hair. Obviously, someone had gotten his note and saved him. Hopefully they weren’t apart of His group.
Before Draco could answer, he collapses.
That’s right! Ladies and Gentleman. This is the story to end all stories. Yesterday I got an owl to come to Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley to talk about the story of the century. When I got there I was blindfolded and taken to an unknown location, but don’t worry readers! I’m perfectly okay. There I met Mr. Potter and he told me we were in a safe house. Here is the Interview that followed:
“You will make it back, or we will die together for I can’t live without you.” Draco told him with a kiss.
(This is a time lapse back to Chapter 19 after Neville and Luna talk to Aidan and Draco.)
Loyalty Potion – 40% (keyed to one: Albus Dumbledore)
Compulsion Spell – slack off on homework
HP: That’s what they wanted everyone to think. They switched to Peter because no one would be expecting it and the Death Eaters and Voldemort would try to get it from Sirius.
AN: Updated 2-15-15
“Will you be joining the fight and getting revenge on those that have obviously ‘corrupted poor sweet Harry’ like Sirius?” Charlie asked sarcastically.
“Me, my father, my mother, Professor Snape, and the Dark Lord.” Malfoy says finally moving his hand from Harry’s hair.
It all quieted down to hear what the goblin had to say next.
“Yeah, could you direct us to someone that could help?” Harry asked looking towards the short somewhat bright area that he knew was a goblin.
Draco sighed, “Sadly-”
“Great!! Now we should let the Prophet know about this new engagement before Dumbledore tries anything new. We should also start planning the wedding now that Draco’s wearing a ring. When do you two want the wedding to be? We could do winter? That’s always a good time, what with the winter solstice. And then the actual wedding. What flowers do you two want? What arrangements? Who do you want to-”
Hermione looked around at the complaining bitch that Ginny was, the whining brat Ron was, the manipulative cunt Molly was, and the manipulative old goat that Dumbledore was and thought only four words… “What have I done?”
“Harry, you do know that you’re the third person that we’ve met that can tell us apart and the only one outside of our family that can? The only others are Bill and Charlie. No one else even tries. If we’re alone and they come talk to us they just call us Fred/George.”
“Harry!” Aidan and Draco stopped at that name, both knowing who that voice belonged to. “Harry, come here.”
“Draco?!” Harry shouts as he came to.
“My lord, I’m sorry to interrupt, but I got an owl.” He said bowing towards Voldemort.
There were aw’s from all the witches near them as they witnessed the ‘young love’. As well as the click of a camera at the picture they presented.
“May I present to you Lord Aidan Salazar Riddle, lord to the houses Potter, Black, Evans, Gryffindor, Emrys, Le Fey; heir to the Houses Riddle and Slytherin.”
“Harry!” Tom yelled and went to scoop him up before being stopped by two exhausted goblins. “Why are you stopping me from getting to my son?” he hissed menacingly.
“Is that-?” he started before Aidan started nodding already picking up on the thought.
“Oh, I have told people. He knew, most of the Weasley’s knew, and Granger knew as well.”
After they worked out a way for Fred and George to contact Aidan when they needed to, Aidan, Draco, and Tom all go to the Apparation point in order to Apparate back to Malfoy Manor. Ever since the twins had started to talk about Aidan’s spying and assassin abilities, Tom had had a thoughtful expression on his face. He obviously was thinking about something pretty important so Draco and Aidan left him alone to his thoughts.
“That is a miniature form of the dragon that I faced in our fourth year, the Hungarian Horntail. As you can see, the dragon flame is surrounding two gems. The gems symbolize our eyes and the flame symbolizes the fact that my love for you shall always burn brighter and hotter than a dragon’s flame. I shall also always protect you more fiercely than even a mother dragon protecting her nestlings and this ring shows that. Please say yes.”
“To answer your question, Mudblood, Weasel, I got a letter too. As Sirius Black’s cousin, it is only reasonable for me to also be invited. I am also here for my mother who didn’t want to be around mudbloods and bloodtraitors.” Draco said snobbishly almost making Harry laugh.
“Why, we are going to get the Nargles cleared from your head and to see if the Crumpled-Horned Snorkak gave you any gifts as well.” She said still pulling him along; she was surprisingly strong for a small girl.
“Your future fiancée is……”
“You can speak to me?” Aidan asked shocked.
“There was a marriage contract made that Sirius was supposed to give the approval of in his will.” Ginny said snobbishly.
“What do you want me to do Dad?” Aidan said, settling into a chair near what he assumed was the fireplace from the heat he was feeling on his right.
“Dad.” Harry moaned moving his head around even though he couldn’t see.
Sirius had smiled his little secretive smile when Harry had told him about his crush for Draco. He had said not to worry about it, that he would do something to help out as well as make sure that Dumblefuck and his order couldn’t do anything about it.
