Snape shook his head and glared at the three of them, “You will not speak a word of this to anyone, am I understood.”
Fornell turned to look at Gibbs, “That is classified, Gi-”
“That tiny wisp of a woman?” Draco said incredulously.
“Not Remus!” Fenrir growled, “Conell needs his papa.”
“Of course, I actually have a few bottles. I had them brewed a few years after Draco was born. Cissa was pregnant again, but lost the child…” He trailed off at the reminder. Clearing his throat he call a house elf to get the potion. Then they all left, Severus back to Hogwarts and the Malfoy’s to St. Mungo’s.
When Fenrir followed Tom through the floo network he was greeted by a scent that he’d not smelled in thirty years, that of his cub. He took in all the people gathered around the room and his gaze landed on a man with light brown hair and amber blue eyes. He swept his gaze over the other werewolf and his inner wolf howled in delight.
Lily gasped and then her eyes rolled and she fell back onto the bed in a faint.
Inside the office was Delores Umbridge sitting behind Head’s desk, sitting in a chair across from her was Minerva McGonagall and Trelawney. The three of them looked up when he came in.

“Severus told me that you two were alive and I had to come down and see for myself.” Remus smiled at his two long lost friends.
Lucius spoke up, “You make an excellent observation Mr. Creevey. I for one would like to know if the muggles knew what was happening.”
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. Did she know? She couldn't know! No one could! He shook his head, “They treated me fine, mum.”
“Cubs? Where are your cubs, Sierra?” Severus asked her softly.
Lily glanced about, “Does anyone know a good Obliviator?”
Chapter Eighteen
Draco blanched. He’d never had to use his emergency portkey before. Things would have to be desperate if his father was telling him to use it now. Draco nodded and Lucius handed the mirror back to Sirius.
Blood Adoption approved by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge
The broken man beside him clung to him as they made their way into the house. Albus went to the least ruined part of the house, the kitchen, and sat Gellert on a bench near the table. He suppressed a shudder as his memories assailed him. With a wave of his wand he cast a general scourgify around the room. It was a little better. He glanced at the man sitting huddled on the bench.
“Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you.”
A/N: There is no MAIN PAIRING!! The story is about all of them!
“Forrest? What is this?”
“You have my eyes. My little girl.” He cried tears of joy.
“Because I’m good at them,” was all she said, then proceeded to ignore them.
Dumbledore just handed him Harry’s page. Snape stared at it for a minute in total shock. “Lily was your daughter? How is that possible?”
“Siri, it really is us. Ask us something no one else would know…” Lily said.
Coming back to himself Draco pulled Harry into a kiss while on the other couch Hermione and Blaise whistled.
Narcissa turned to face him, “Twenty!? Twenty babes ripped from their families? Why? What for?”
James Potter shrank back from the fury coming off the young blond. Beside him Sirius snickered. James turned to Narcissa with a pleading look. Cissy just smirked at him and shook her head, meaning it was all on him.
While he was meditating he remembered a book that held a potion that, combined with a spell, could break any memory charm. That book was in the restricted section of the Hogwarts Library. He needed to find someone willing to get into the school and retrieve the book for him… for them all.
Lily seethed at him, “He’s my baby, James, my baby and she allowed that… that MONSTER to rape him! I am not just gonna sit here and let that man get away with what he did to Harry!”
“I can come with?” She looked to each man hesitantly.
Severus clung to Remus’ hand shaking with relief. “Thank you… all of you…” He turned to survey the room and his eyes widened as they landed on Lily and James. “You really are here!” He said in shock, then collapsed into a faint.
“Something is troubling you Lucius and I would like to know what it is.”
“Harry, are you sure that is a good idea right now? You are still in a fragile state.”
Chapter Sixteen
Draco’s shoulders slumped, “I will always be labeled a Death Eater, so long as I bear His mark.” Draco pulled back his sleeve on his left arm. In contrast to his alabaster skin the Dark Mark stood out in black on his arm.
“But why? What’s the point?” Hermione cried.
Hermione Jean Granger (Adoptive Name)
Blood Adoption approved by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge
________________________________________
“Let’s get back to the discussion at hand boys.” Hermione said.
“How in the name of Merlin did she arrange that!!!” Albus shouted.
“It’s almost time to get back you guys.” Blaise had been quiet throughout the whole exchange and now all eyes turned to him. “What?”
“Draco, love, calm down. You have five hours-”
“My memories of that night are not so terrible except the end. Sirius had just shown up very excited about something, bursting to tell us but was waiting for you. When you came in the door Peter was trailing behind you. Now that I think about it he looked rather nervous and hesitant about something.
“You are awake?” A soft feminine voice said to him.
Behind McGee was Gibbs. Harry stood as his new-found father came towards him.
Maternal Grandfather: Gellert Grindelwald ‘carrier’
Tom heaved a sigh, “My memory of that night was of me coming to your house and killing you two and being blasted into oblivion by your baby.” There, he said it.
“… care, just so long as I never see him again.”
Slowly they crept towards the edge of the wards. Tom could see the buildings just on the other side about a kilometer away. There were just a few guards on duty that he could see.
The door clicked and swung wide revealing Severus… and a young woman who looked intent on stalking him.
Pulling out a fresh sheet of parchment she began to copy down the potion. When she was done she blew on the page to dry the ink. Casting a quick tempus she realized that it was dinner time.
Sirius Orion Black lay on his bed in Grimmauld Place, completely bored out of his mind. The only company he had at present was Buckbeak, aka Witherwings. Remus was at Hogwarts, Harry was at Hogwarts, heck even Kreature was at Hogwarts as he’d sent the four elf to serve there as he had no care for the beast.
HPDMHPDMHPDM
James went to Albus and pulled the man into a hug, “Not quite, just a sneaky little rat.”
He was rocking and murmuring soothing words to Harry until he calmed down. Harry pulled away from the blond and looked into his concerned eyes.
Tom conjured a chair and sat heavily. He really didn’t think that it would be this easy to recover their memories but he’d hoped for some sort of clue.
Lucius gave a small start. He was sure that he’d kept his features in his usual Malfoy mask. Obviously his distress bled through just enough for his Lord to see.
Tom frowned, a wolf? The only wolf he could recall from his service was Greyback. Surely the man wouldn’t come here unless it was very important.
“We are not entirely certain but it seems as if the Ministry wants there to be war. They want the Light families to be against the Dark families. It makes no sence to us at the moment.” Rodolphus sighed. “We just don’t have all the facts.”
The elevator dinged alerting him to the arrival of the team. Tony was the first out of the elevator, heading straight to his desk. Ziva came out more slowly with a smug smile on her face. Harry was of the opinion that she got one over on Tony. After her was Timothy McGee, a nerdy looking young man with brown hair. Harry thought he looked like Neville enough to be a brother.
“But why potions?” Ron complained.
Together they dressed and headed up to the Great Hall. They entered separably a few minutes after each other. Draco watched Harry as he made his way to the Gryffindor table. He noticed that Weasley and Finnigan began to question him as to where he’d been. He was relieved to see that Hermione intervened and the two of them sat with their heads together talking quietly.
And he’ll never get it back.
Harry smiled at him, “James Potter was my carrier. Jethro is my sire. Dad was Fae, as am I. Jethro and dad met very briefly and were never bonded. If that had happened Jethro would have died shortly after Voldemort killed Dad.”
“Yes, Sir.” Those two words seemed to be the only things she had been saying lately.
Lucius’ face became impassive, “It is true, they were in Azkaban. I can take you to see them right now, if you want.”
The dark haired woman lay back on the bed panting in exhaustion. After twenty hours she could push no more.
Tom smiled, “Never mind, until all our memories are back, what I glimpsed makes no sense right now.” Tom drank the next potion. Everyone looked at him expectant.
Albus stood at the door to his room watching the love of his life sleep. He never imagined that Gellert would have gotten pregnant. Would things have been different if he had? Would he have been able to go up against him knowing that he was carrying his child? Albus had no way of knowing, and no way of ever making it up to his lover.
Remus realized what was happening and snarled at the woman. He began to struggle against his bonds. Umbridge noticed and flicked her wand at him again. Remus screamed. Severus cried out at the pain the other was in.
“We know about that, Draco. Listen, you need to get home as soon as possible. It’s not safe for you there anymore.”
Lily gave a laugh and the boy turned his head. With a cry of, “Papa!” he launched himself off the table and into Severus’ arms. Severus held his son to him tightly.
Fenrir was taken aback at the intensity of the others hatred in those amber blue eyes. He broke eyes contact and glanced at the boy clinging to him. He smelled of wolf, but not quite. He then noticed the other person sitting with them and his eyes widened. Severus Snape was staring at Tom Riddle intently as if hoping the man would die on the spot.
“Due to certain circumstances Professor Dumbledore has been relieved of his duty as Headmaster and the Ministry has placed me in charge until a new Headmaster or Headmistress is appointed.”
Especially once the woman finds out about her real paternity.
Born: September 19th 1979
“But why was she placed with Muggles? It doesn’t make sense.” Severus protested.
Sirius just grumbled and left to take a shower. James shook his head and followed his best friend. “We’ll be back once the coast is clear. I don’t need another milk bath.” He gave Lily a peck on the cheek and left.
Carrier: Sirius Orion Black
The mediwitch bowed one last time and left. Once she was past the Antiapparation wards she apparated to the small Muggle hospital where she sent the Lestrange baby girl.
Fenrir sighed heavily and sat down onto a chair. He was out of options and getting desperate. The Dark Lord was his last chance.
“Well then, the parchment Miss Granger.”
Just then Madame Pomphrey burst into the room, “Alright everyone, lets each find a bed and roll up your left sleeve. It will just be a little blood draw and your all done. If any infection is to be reported I will send you an owl and you will promptly return here for a purifying potion.”
They’d been gone for two weeks now and no one had any idea where they went. His mother was always in the headmasters office with the Master and would not answer any of his questions.
Narcissa gave a snort, “That could also explain why so many people believed the paper about Harry being crazy over the last few months. No one believed him that the Dark Lord was back after Rita Skeeters article.”
Tom looked up towards Sirius and raised an eyebrow, “Was that necessary?”
Now that Narcissa thought about it, the incident seemed a little suspicious. The Alley had been crowded, but not so crowded that people could have avoided them. At the time they both assumed it was an accident, but no one came forward to apologize or anything.
Severus awoke with a start and cried out, “Remy!”
A hand came up and caressed his cheek. He sat up a bit to look into Draco’s eyes, “Your awake.”
Draco had froze as soon as Harry began to move, sure that the other boy would attack him. When he realized that the Boy-Who-Lived was cringing in the corner he lowered his wand and crept towards the distressed boy.
Tom stalked through the corridors looking for any stragglers. The few werewolves they’d encountered seemed hesitant in attacking the powerful Dark Lord. Two doors down he heard whimpering and crying. Slowly he pushed the door open and came upon what appeared to be a kennel, but upon closer examination he saw that it was not puppies that housed the cages, but children and babies.
After they got over their shock, Lucius and Narcissa asked many questions about their new-found niece. All Lucius remembered of her was a head full of bushy brown hair and too much teeth. Narcissa had never seen the girl and wanted to know everything.
McGonagall spoke up, “No, my lord, no word. He just seems to have disappeared.”
Oblivious to the other wolf’s thoughts, Remus froze at the sight of the man who’d bitten him. He wanted to kill this man who ruined his life. He felt the others gaze on him and he stared back, his hatred of the werewolf showing in his eyes.
Severus awoke to pain and darkness. Without opening his eyes or moving he used his other senses to get a feel of his situation. The first thing he felt for was his bond with Remus. It thrummed faintly in the back of his mind telling him that his mate was safe. He then began a check on his body. Bruises and abrasions covered his body from when he fell, hit by a stunner aimed at Remus. His right shoulder ached and he couldn't move his fingers, that told him that his arm was dislocated.
“James, oh James, something terrible has happened.”
Narcissa gave a small cry and ran to her cousin to peer into the mirror, “Dragon!”
It was four days until the full moon and he could see the wolf in the girl slowly seizing control. He knew that if he wan’t rescued before then he would either be changed or he would be dead.
“The place we went to was guarded, but not heavily so, and Greyback could smell wolves. Let’s wait and see what Severus and Remus saw when they get back.”
Hermione Jean Granger (Adoptive Name)
Gellert choked at the endearment. It had been so long since he’d heard those words coming from the lips of the man he loved. “You said we have a grandson? What’s he like?”
Tom was ignoring it all as his own gaze settled on one Sirius Black who seemed to cringe behind Narcissa Malfoy. The man kept peering over her shoulder as if he was afraid to look into Tom’s eyes.
Severus sniggered at the disheveled look of his one time nemesis, “He won’t eat cereal, he likes pancakes and eggs.”
Murmurings broke out in the Hall. Umbridge cleared her throat again. The murmuring stopped.
“Come, Bella, it is time to leave this hell hole.” Tom said to her.
Snape led her to his desk where he pulled out the Bamboo parchment and potion. After the potion was absorbed by the parchment Hermione once again let one drop of blood hit the page. And once again the same words appeared on the page.
“Because they are not Death Eaters Harry, it is your parents that they found.”
Five days later Hermione received an owl from Hagrid telling her that the Unicorn mare was in labor. Dropping what she was doing she rushed out of the Great Hall and ran to Hagrids, ignoreing Harry and Ron’s exclamations for her to stop.
“Did you see anyone before you passed out?”
Hermione’s voice trembled, “Who would believe us anyways.”
“I came to your house intent on killing you son because of a prophecy about him and I, one that stated that he would have the power to kill me. Peter let me into the house while under a Fidelus charm and I killed James first as he blocked my path to the stairs and then as I came to the bedroom you, Lily, begged me not to kill the boy and you got into the path of the Killing Curse and died. When I went to cast the curse again at the boy it rebounded and struck me. I had been floating in an essence form for ten years possessing snakes and muggles until I came across a Wizard.
“Don’t smother the man, Lils.” James said from the door.
“You have four days Miss Granger. On Tuesday at the lunch hour I expect you to be down here with the completed project. We will then test the paper at that time. Understood?”
Gellert raised his head slowly and looked into Albus’ eyes, “Al… am I really out of there? Or is this just a dream?”
Fenrir was at a loss of what to say as he didn’t know what damage he was supposed to have done, “I don’t know what you are talking about. What damage? I haven’t seen my cub since he was just a pup, that was over thirty years ago.”
Sirius snorted from the doorway, “That might be a little hard at the moment.”
Albus had tears in his eyes and his throat constricted. He had to clear his throat to get the words out, “Yes, Gel, it’s me.”
“Pack.” Fenrir stated.
Just them Severus Snape walked into the Hospital wing. He took one look at the Headmaster and rushed to his side. “Albus! What is it?”
“Professor, I’m here for the Runespoor Venom, please.”
Lucius nodded, “My Lord, the child, in actuality, was not stillborn but was stolen right from under our nose. The mediwitch created a golem, we believe, and portkeyed the real child away. She was placed with muggles to raise.”
“From 1975 to 1984 about twenty or so, I have records…”
Harry hugged him and bid farewell.
The three of them stared at her. She lifted her head to look Snape in the eye.
“Please, this is important, the mediwitch?” Snape persisted.
Lucius swept from the room to the floo and flooed over to Riddle Manor where Tom and the Potter’s were. When he came into the room Tom was laid out on the bed where Lily was pressing a cold compress to his forehead.
“Lils, I know you want to go after Petunia, I do too, but you have to think about the bigger picture here. You are not the only one who want’s a piece of them, there is a long line of people who would like to take a crack at them too. Myself included.”
“Where did you find them?” Fenrir asked Tom, referring to the children.
Now it was Tom’s turn to look perplexed, “Have a row? Alright, something is not right here. Either you two are crazy from your stay in Azkaban or someone has been screwing with my memories or both.”
Hermione looked at them in shock, “What happened to them?”

Harry gave a start, “I’m not-”
“Black wants to see them, he won’t take me at my word.”
Required Ingrediants:
Albus Dumbledore sat behind his chair, eyes twinkling, “Oh? What issue?”
Fenrir glanced at the map and pointed to one spot, “This is not far from my pack’s forest. It is possible that they could be here.”
3 drops of Dragons blood
Lucius hid a small smile. The Dark Lord afraid of confrontations.
Harry smiled, “Yeah. I… uh, have something else to tell you…” he glanced around the room at the team, who suddenly looked busy, “alone.”
Hermione pulled away from Harry and practicly flew into the arms of the dark skinned boy on the left. Blaise Zabini cradled her as she cried into his shoulder. Her ran his hands through her hair comfortingly.
Harry turned to look at his father, “He is certainly inquisitive. So… seven at my hotel, The Merriot?”
________________________________________
Draco sat on his bed holding a shaking Harry who’d just woken from a nightmare. Ever since his talk with his mother Harry has had a nightmare every night, sometimes more than one. Draco too had nightmares, ones that woke him in a cold sweat. Never in all his years did he contemplate killing someone, until he heard what that monster did to Harry.
Sierra looked into the Alpha’s eyes and then nodded. She reached out and took his hand and Fenrir left the room. Remus, Severus and Sirius followed after him, wands at the ready.
Sirius frowned, confused, “What?”
She closed her eyes again, trying to will it all away. She really was Bellatrix Lestange’s daughter. She couldn’t deny it any longer.
“Draco is fine. I am not here for him. I have something else to discuss.”
Turning away from his small family, Snape made his way towards the main hall to speak to Tom.
“If there is any from Fenrir’s pack still there we will release them and send them back to the Manor. We will go at dawn tomorrow when everyone is waking up. The guards will be tired from a long watch and will be lazy. Bella, no torture please. Stunning spells only unless other options are needed. Lucius, please make about two or three dozen portkey’s and disperse them to the others.”
“No, we had tested Harry Potter, your son, and his paper showed Lily as being the daughter of Gellert Grindewald and Albus Dumbledore.”
“Why?”
“I was worried, love. What were you…” He stopped as he noticed something. Harry followed his gave down. He heard Draco sigh, “I thought we were past this.”
Lily hissed, “Skeeter? That back stabbing Ravenclaw!? I’ll wring her scrawny little neck!”
Severus snorted, “You should have stayed in bed and waited until they could come to you. It’s not like they can go anywhere. The whole world thinks that their dead.”
“You may go.”
Conall pulled his little head back and asked his father, “Where Daddy?”
A moan came from the woman and she began to stir. He pulled his wand just in case. She opened her eyes slowly and turned to see the figure beside her. Her mouth moved as she said the mans name in a inaudible whisper. She turned to look about the room frowning in confusion at the strangness of it and spotted him standing at the end of the bed.
Albus gently lowered the man onto a nearby chair but stood nearby as the man refused to release his hand. “Lucius, Narcissa, Severus… may I introduce Gellert Grindewald, the love of my life and carrier of my daughter. Severus, could you please came and check Gel over. He’s not in the greatest of shape right now.”
________________________________________
“I wasn’t sure you’d come.” She said into his shirt.
“Um… I…” She really didn’t know what to say to these people. She has parents and didn’t think that they would just up and let her go.
The dark-haired witch screamed at the mediwitch, “Get out!”
Lily scoffed, “After all the things you told me about what you all remember, I’m not surprised. Sirus is a little thick sometimes, no offence Tom.”
Fenrir just shook his head again, “We never saw anyone, it was all over when we got back. It was as if they knew we would be gone and leave the carriers and cub’s by themselves. From the smells of the area there were at least twenty men and women. They didn’t even leave a corpse behind from one of their own. I could smell the blood of the one who died. It was not werewolf. Three of my pack that was left behind from the hunt had been killed.”
Remus was cut off as the front door was blown off and men came storming into the room. Before either of them knew what was happening they were disarmed and bound. Severus cursed at being so outsmarted. Then a woman came in and Snape sneered at her in disgust.
Albus clapped his hands together loudly, “That’s all going to change. Lucius do you have a way of getting a message to the boys? If we can’t go and get them, then they’ll have to come to us.”
No birth name given
Severus stiffened, “I have a mate. That is why I smell like you. My mate is a wolf.”
Tom took the potions from him, “Well then…” and he downed the first potion. The whole room waited in anticipation for any change. Sirius looked especially anxious.
FALLACY
“Of course. Kipper!” She called and a moment later a house elf appeared, “Tell the master that Master Snape has called.”
“I still can’t believe that they’ve been alive all this time?” Hermione grumbled.
Harry and Hermione made their way towards the hospital wing just before dinner. Trailing behind them was Colin and Dennis Creevey. The two brothers were chatting about something Harry couldn’t quite make out. As they entered the hospital Harry noticed some Ravenclaws and a few Hufflepuffs standing nearby. Dean Thomas stood off to one side with Justin Finch-Fletchley.
Draco cleared his throat again, “I’m taking him to bed. He sleeps better with company.”
Sirius stared at his best friend in shock, “When in the name of Merlin did this happen?!”
TBC...
“Sir? But my potion wasn’t wrong.” Hermione gaped at him.
Hermione gave a squeek as she was engulfed in a surprisingly strong hug. She glanced at the two men who stood hovering nearby. They looked so similar that she did not know who was who.
Narcissa came over to him and pulled him into a hug, “They didn’t know, at least Dumbledore didn’t know that Lily was his daughter. When we showed the professor this paper he was shocked. His theory was that Grindewald put a strong stasis charm over the baby once he realized he was pregnant and after he was put into prison the spell began to wear off.”
“Bloody Hell, ‘Mione, a little warning next time.” Ron exclaimed.
“You fainted again love.” James said grinning.
“Yes sir.”
Twenty minutes later Fenrir and Tom apparated to a small wooded area on the outskirts of the Ministry facility. Right away Tom could feel the wards on the area. They felt strong and well tended. This place was definitely not abandoned.
Lucius gave a small frown, “He might have, why?”
“We are not sure, but suspect it has something to do with the Dark Lord.” Rabastan stated.
“It could be any number of things. A potion, spell or combination of both. That is what we need to figure out. Also, I had a thought… how is the ministry keeping up with this farce of Tom being a Dark Lord? How did they get the whole Wizarding World to accept that without him actually doing anything. From what Potter said you were just a dark wizard in politics. They have to have some way of getting everyone to recognize him as a Dark Lord. They couldn’t have just gone to all the homes and used this spell.” Severus said.
When class began she followed her assignment by rote, not really paying attention to the instructions. As a result the cauldron began to bubble more furiously and she gave a gasp as the whole thing exploded. Luckily she ducked down behind her desk just in time before the hot liquid could hit her.
Harry gave a resigned sigh, “I know but it doesn’t mean I have to like it.”
Severus smiled, “Daddy is sleeping and will wake very soon, but for now how about I make you breakfast?”
On the other side of those flames was a regal sitting room richly furnished in silver and bronze. A regal woman sat on a settee embroidering. She glanced at the fireplace when she saw the fire spurt.
TRSBTRSBTRSB
Maternal Grandfather: Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore
The next day in potions class, Hermione sat down in her usual spot and waited for Professor Snape to arrive. She gave up trying to figure things out. She just didn’t know enough about what happened to come to a full conclusion.
“How much do you remember of the night Bellatrix lost her baby?” Snape threw back the liquid in on go. It burned going down.
“That’s because he only likes pancakes that his Daddy makes.” Severus said from the doorway.
Remus shook his head in disbelief, “Why would they do this? What would be the point?”
Shortly after they talked Gibbs had been called to a scene and told Harry to wait for him at his desk. Harry was inspecting the pictures on the man’s desk. One stood out prominently of a beautiful red-haired woman and a seven year old girl. Harry assumed that this was the wife and daughter Gibbs had spoken of. He studied the picture of his deceased sister and noticed some similarities between them. The shape of their eyes were very similar.
“Anything else you should tell me?” Harry grumbled.
“Remus!” Severus exclaimed. “Thank Salazar, you have come. We must leave, it’s two days until the full moon and she is getting more feral with each passing day.”
The man came back down, a blanket wrapped around what he carried. Remus caught the new scent and threw his head back and howled, letting his wolf come foreward. His bonds snapped just a Umbridge threw another curse at him. He lept to the side and it flew past him. But one thrown by one of her men hit him and he fell crying out in pain.
Sorry this is late, and so short.. I'd been sitting on this chapter for six months.. I'm not really happy about it, but I had to get it out so I could keep going. Hope you guys enjoy it. K
It took just a minute for her to talk to the Headmaster and he then stepped through into the room.
The woman stirred at the sound of his voice. She moaned as she rolled over, “Luce? Have the hallucinations gotten that bad now?” She mumbled.
Lucius and Narcissa came through the floo into the Headmasters office the next day.
Director Vance looked at the FBI agent and frowned, “Personal private or classified private?”
“Lily! Your alive!” Albus clung to his new-found alive daughter. “Gel, it’s Lily, she’s alive.”
Maternal Grandfather: Sygnus Black
“Bad, he woke screaming for him to stop, that he was good…” Draco snarled, “When I get my hands on that filthy Muggle…”
“Sev… dinner…” Remus gasped as Severus sucked on his ear.
Severus was sitting in the middle of the room meditating. Sierra was curled up in a corner. He had no idea what she thought was going to happen, but it was not for them to have sex. He will always stay true to Remus. It had been three days since his capture and each day Sierra asks if they would mate. Each time he would gently tell her no. Her innocence about the situation was slowly beginning to exasperate him.
Blood Adopted Mother: Diana May Creevey ‘nee Holden
“Madam, how do you know that name?” his voice had a hiss to it, almost as if he was a snake. She wondered if he’d gotten stuck in a half animagus transformation. Then what he said caught her attention.
Lucius sighed and called for a house elf, “Mopsy, please inform the household that Headmaster Dumbledore will be arriving here shortly and have tea sent here for everyone.”
Hermione flushed and she stood, “I’m sorry sir if I interrupted your routine. I’ll go now.”
“Then just a little over a week ago I was told that there seemed to be no Muggleborns, that children from Dark families were being taken and put with Muggles to raise. Last night I attacked Azkaban and freed all my followers and we found you two in a remote cell, catatonic.”
No, she couldn’t think like that. Too many eyes and ears. Maybe it’s possible to get a message out to someone.
Quietly the four of them observed as the Unicorn mare brought a new life into the world. Hagrid leaned down and whispered to Hermione, “Walk as calm as you can holding your hands out to the side and approach her. If she nods her head you may take your one hair. Make sure it is just one. The best place would be from the mane.”
Hermione stood shakily to her feet and mumbled, “Yes, sir.”
Blaise nodded and followed Draco to their dorm room. Draco tucked Harry into his bed after removing his outer robes. The slashes on his arms stood out against the paleness of the Gryffindor’s skin.
Lucius nodded grimly and opened the door infront of him. If these two people were sane and have been in here all this time under false charges they might be willing to side with them, against the ministry.
“We can enlist Madame Pomphrey’s aid. Possibly use it as a checkup. Muggles have all sorts of drugs that could contaminate out magical core. We call all muggleborn and muggle-raised children to the hospital wing and take a blood sample. Then use the Heritage potion.”
“She needs to breathe love.” The man said with a chuckle.
Harry shook his head in disbelief, “They’re dead, you said you saw their bodies. Mum died for me!”
Tom hoped that there was one decent follower in there. Azkaban was not a very friendly place, especially with the Dementors guarding it. But Tom knew how to get past them. In his wonderings as a spirit he came upon a artifact that kept Dark Creatures at bay. Just after his resurrection he went and retrieved it.
Fornell discreetly pulled his wand and shot a locking and silencing spell at the door.
The room was shrouded in darkness. He stood at the doorway just staring at the two people on the bed. His mind was racing with images of these two defiant and proud as the green light from his own wand enveloped them in turn. It was impossible that they were here and alive, yet here they lay.
Tom Marvolo Riddle, AKA Lord Voldemort, sneered down at Peter Pettigrew, AKA Wormtail. The man was a sniveling rat and at times Tom wondered what possessed him to allow the fool to remain.
Disclaimer: I don’t own Harry Potter nor do I make any money from this story, Just having some fun with the Characters
Draco was on the floor in front of him leaning on his legs. The blonde too had not left his side except to see his parents. The couch next to them held Remus and Severus with their son curled in Remus’ lap. Harry still was shocked to see the two of them together, with a child. Surprisingly Fenrir Greyback stood behind Remus. Harry noticed his hand twitch, almost as if the man was wanting to place it somewhere.
James gave a snort, “That child is definitely a Snape. Had me and Sirius dodging cereal this morning.”
Severus pulled from within his robes a few vials, “They range from your basic memory restorer to an advanced mind healing draught. I am unsure as to which would be more successful.”
“No… no… your wrong…” the lady began to weep loudly and collapsed back onto the bed.
Tom glanced around at his followers and smiled. They were few now, but that number will increase when the world finds out that the ministry is stealing children.
He growled at her, “They’re gone. Looked everywhere. The others have reported that most of the Muggleborns are gone… Creevey’s, Finch-Fletchley, Thomas, Cartwright… all of them.”
A/N: I apologize for the lateness of this chapter… I kind of lost my muse for this story and life seemed to pull me further away… Thank you for your patience… Kalendral
Cousin, wow. That’s something that will take some getting used to…
When Severus Snape returned to Hogwarts he slipped down to the dungeons as unobtrusively as he could. Years of practice kept him clear of Filtch and Mrs. Norris. Snape sneered, oh how he hated that filthy squib.
Sirius just shuddered again and Draco left it at that and went to get his guests settled.
“I must return to Hogwarts. Although, Lucius, I was wondering if you had any supply of the Heritage potion. I know that most Pureblood families keep some around for indentity purposes of children.”
Draco went about gathering his and Harry’s things. After they’d started dating Harry refused to leave him, claiming that he slept better with him. Draco did not complain for it gave him the chance to ease Harry into their relationship.
‘Now to find a proper home for this child away from Dark families.’
Draco glanced behind them, “Where are the others?”
Narcissa stared at him aghast, “They are stealing children from Dark families, and from the Heritage potion done by Miss Granger, sending them to live with Muggles…”
“There’s more, and your not going to like it, Siri.” She sighed and pulled more pages from the table, “Lucius and I tested all the Muggleborns. All of them, Siri. None of them are really who they are. You need to see for yourself.” She handed the stack to him.
“Ok, I’m confused Tom. Let’s start from that Halloween night and what you remember of it.” James spoke in.
The Manor was quiet that night, many of it’s guests lost in thought. Many things had been revealed in that discussion but nothing had concrete evidence. James and Lily Potter seemed to be the only ones not affected by the memory loss. The children who’d been pulled from Hogwarts were shaken up with the fact that the people who raised them were not really their parents.
Draco smiled back, “I’ll bet.” He leaned in and gave Harry a gentle kiss to his lips. He took Harry’s hand and together they walked to dinner.
Blood Adopted Mother: Ellen May Granger nee Thomas
With a cry of joy Severus scooped up Conall and nearly ran from the room in search of his husband.
Harry flinched away from the upraised hand that held the wand, fled to the corner of the room and wrapped his arms around himself, knees to his chin head burried in them rocking back and forth.
Umbridge snarled at him, “You were supposed to be watching them, you little fool. When did you last see them?”
His mind supplied names for them, but he passed that off as impossible… right? James and Lily Potter were dead… killed by Tom, the very man who stood in front of them.
“Black… Sirius… believe me, it was a shock to us all.”
Draco stared out the door to where Harry’s father went through and smirked. He turned to his mother, “He didn’t seem the coward type.”
Slowly he walked to the bed and stared down at the two of them, the man had dark messy hair and the woman a deep copper. Behind each of those closed eyelids he knew lay bright blue and vibrant green eyes respectively.
He leapt at the man holding his child and threw his fist into the mans face. Blood spurted everywhere as the man’s nose broke. He fell and Severus pulled his son from the loose grasp. Bounding over to Remus and Umbridge he pulled his love from off the screaming woman.
A son… he has a son. One who knows nothing about who he really is. Who was raised as a Muggle. Tom growled and stood, pacing. Whoever is responsible for all this will pay dearly. He needed to find out who is doing this and why, before it happens to any more families. The future of the Magical world depended on this.
Harry kept his wand in hand, “You have me at a disadvantage, Mr..?”
“What’s is this? Some kind of joke, Cissa? You really think that I’d fall for this charade?! Is this some kind of ploy to get me to join you and him. If it is, then you’ve failed. I’ll not join you, and I’ll especially not join HIM.” Sirius threw the pages at her and got up storming out of the room.
Tom nodded, “It has been two weeks since you've been here. We will find your parents. Your Alpha is here too.”
“Delores Umbridge, new Headmistress of Hogwarts.” Sirius said disdainfully.
Born: June 10th 1981
“Ten wounded and two casualties, Gibbon and Yates. Twenty four werewolves rescued, some of them not with Greyback’s pack, plus the eleven children you rescued. Severus has been given some healing and nutrient potions. We are all set to head back to the Manor.”
Lily pulled Harry into her arms, “It’s going to be OK Harry. You never have to return to them again. Your father and I will not allow that.”
Lily seemed to get that something was wrong finally and asked, “Tom, what you said earlier about us being dead, what did you mean by that?”
Remus stirred at the sound, “Conall.”
“Fudge?”
“Harry, you in there?” Draco’s voice came from the other side.
“This can’t be…”
Severus struggled to his feet with the help of Narcissa and sat next to Remus, his hands gently caressed the werewolfs bruised face, “Remy, I’m here… we are all here and we are fine. Conall is just fine too. We are safe now.” And he leaned in a gave a chaste kiss to the injured man.
A house elf popped into the room, quivering in slight fear, “Master, there be a wolf at the door.”
Hermione nodded unable to say anything for her mouth felt dry. She had many questions and didn’t know where to start.
“What is, Harry?” Draco asked softly.
He heard shuffling from the other side of the door and he quickly transfigured the blade back into his toothbrush, healed his cuts and cleaned the blood. A knock came from the door just as he finished.
Harry nodded, “I understand.”
Paternal Grandfather: Abraxas Malfoy
“Rosier, Gibbon, Lestrange, Avery, Nott, Black, Thurgun, Rovoms, Crabbe, O’Shea, McDougall… Cissa, all these names are Dark families. Not all of them follow the Dark Lord but they practice in Dark Arts.”
Before either Remus or Severus could do anything the man thrust the knife into Remus’ side. He screamed in agony as the silver burned him. Severus then lost all coherent thought as his love and mate lay screaming, writhing on the floor and his child struggling in the grasp of a stranger.
Harry slipped into Draco’s room after all the excitement died down. Draco was sitting on a plush chair reading what looked like a potions book. He glanced up at Harry as he came closer.
Lucius dared to look at his lord, “I have been thinking about this ever since we found out about Miss Granger. I believe that the Ministry has done this for the single purpose of creating dissention among the bloodlines. There have always been ‘light’ and ‘dark’ minded families, what if the ‘light’ families, wanting to thin our bloodlines, stole our children, placing them with muggles and when they come to our schools we purebloods scorn them for their ‘impure’ blood, thus reducing our chance of continuing our families blood. I can think of no other alternative, nothing else fits. They are trying to wipe us out by making us the ‘bad guys’ when we just want our families to live on.”
Hermione nodded and Hagrid removed his hand. Some rustling of leaves alerted them to the approach of Harry and Ron. Hermione turned around as the two boys came into view. Placing a finger to her lips she gestured them foreward.
Bella gave a jerk and she sat up, “My Lord!” she gasped.
“Mother stop pestering him. We only have a short time here.” Draco pulled Harry away from his mother and proceded to exit the room, Hermione and Blaise trailing after.
Sirius Black sighed, “Do you remember where we are?”
Bellatrix pulled back and looked into Hermione’s eyes studying her, “Were you treated well by those muggles?”
The group began to disperse with Tom, Remus, Sirius, Fenrir and Lucius staying behind. Tom sat back into his chair and sighed heavily. “I want you to take Fenrir with you.”
“There is no way that I’m going anywhere with you. I will not be drawn in by your pathetic attempts to entice me into your little club.”
What does that mean? She knew for a fact that Bellatrix Lestrange and her husband were still alive. They were still in Azkaban as far as she knew, but that meant that she should have been sent to be raised by the Malfoy’s or the Tonks’. Why then was she sent to live with Muggles?
A/N: There is no MAIN PAIRING!! The story is about all of them! Albus/Gellert are Lily’s parents, Bella/Rodolphus are Hermione’s parents, Fenrir/Tala are Remus’ parents
Fenrir came into the room and snarled at the girl. Her eyes went wide and she cowered back from the Alpha werewolf. “She will obey me. I am Alpha.”
Albus stared at James in shock, “But Peter was terrible with memory spells. How could he perform them to a point like that. And why do we all remember Tom being a dark lord if he really wasn’t one?”
“It is not so secure that a group could sneak in and discover what is going on. A rescue could be possible depending on the security inside.”
“Should I come back at a later time?” Harry knew that this team investigated major crimes involved with the United States military and they were mostly called out on murders.
“Shh.” Hagrid placed a hand on her mouth. “Not a sound.”
“Yes Master.” Mopsy bowed and disappeared. A moment later and Narcissa came into the room with Severus holding his son.
Albus/Gellert are Lily’s parents, Bella/Rodolphus are Hermione’s parents, Fenrir/Tala are Remus’ parents
Tom frowned at the man, where was this going? He idly wondered. “Stillborn girl child I believe. Bella was catatonic for weeks afterwards.”
Delorus Umbridge gave a small smile at the bound men and sniffed, “I would have expected better of you Snape. A werewolf? How disgusting to contaminate yourself with a halfbreed.”
Blood Adopted Father: George Albert Creevey
“Yes, sir, all done. It just needs the bamboo paper to soak into and five minutes after that my blood.”
But who?
Sorry for all you who have been waiting for me to finish this... Sadly I've not been having any luck.. So... This is the last bit that I've written...
Lily looked at her father, “Did you know that they are married?”
“What!?” shrieked Lily mouth agape, “You most certainly did not do anything of the sort! What gave you that idea?”
“You are my cub and you will do as I say!” Fenrir barked back.
“Yes, you can… you can do it…”
Tom swept through the house towards the library in hopes of finding a spell or potion that would return his memory to him. He also decided that some kind of rejuvenation potion would probably help in making him look more human. He realized that his snakelike appearance would possible scare Sirius away before they even got back together, including their son.
Paternal Grandfather: Arcturus Lestrange
When he had gone into labor and gave birth to his and Albus’ child she was taken away before he ever saw a glimpse of her.
“Come on, we have things to do and little time. Go get Granger and the Creevey’s, have them meet us in the potions classroom. I’ll have Harry ready. Father told me to use my portkey.”
Severus was shocked that the woman didn't know what years were. He thought of how to best explain the length of a year to her, “A year is twelve wolf changes.”
Chapter Fifteen
Albus scanned each paper one by one with a sinking feeling. By the time he got to the last page he was in tears. His name stood out on Harry’s page like a beacon.
“Who’s in labor?”
Paternal Grandfather: Arcturus Lestrange
Albus stared at the man in shock. Here he was in the same room and Tom Riddle and the man is being very polite to everyone, even going as far as letting them say his real name.
“Sirius? What are you doing here? You should be at Grimmauld Place.”
A small choked sound came from within the room and Severus turned to his mate. Remus lay curled on their bed cradling Conell in his lap as his mind began to process what he just heard. His mind was telling him that the other wolf was lying, but his heart said otherwise.
Ron Weasley knelt next to his mother awaiting their Lord’s arrival. Delores Umbridge stood near the fireplace as the floo activated and a cloaked figure stepped out. Umbridge gave a deep curtsy as the person sat in the Headmaster’s chair.
Sirius stared at his best friend in shock, “When in the name of Merlin did this happen?!”
Harry James Potter
He had the Gryffindor’s and Slytherins for his second class, and if the chit proved to be Bella’s child… Snape stopped, he honestly had no idea what he’d do. The girl had been raised a muggle, blood or not, and quite possibly Bellatrix would have nothing to do with the child.
Fenrir cautiously walked to the bed and knelt beside his cub, “I swear to you, on my magic and my oath as an Alpha, that I didn’t bite you to make you what you are. You are my cub, born from my mate Tala. The ministry has made our people out to be monsters and murders, but we are not. We are simple folk only wishing to live in peace with everyone.”
“Professor, what can I do for you?” Lucius asked.
“Until such time the Ministry has named me High Inquisitor and Acting Headmistress. And for the first order of business all students are required to dress appropriately in school attire.”
Harry looked at her, “You had a child stolen too? Hermione and mum were not the only ones?”
Turning away from the sleeping child he stalked out of the room. He supposed that until they could get all their memories restored it wold be hopeless for him to dwell on these things.
Harry smiled back, “Of course. Wouldn’t want to give my father the wrong impression.”
Tears filled Harry’s eyes, “I can’t help it, Dray. It’s killing me, tearing me up inside.”
Lily smirked at him, almost reminiscent of a Malfoy, “Goofy, you really think that he’d be talking to us when both the boy’s parents were out cold? He was a little traumatized himself too you know.”
Making her way down to the dungeons, Hermione knocked on Snape’s classroom door. Grateful that it was a Saturday she heard him say ‘enter’ and she went into the room.

“I needed to retrieve something of great value to me. Now, news if you would be so kind.”
“One, Miss Granger.”
“Do you remember fifteen years ago you gave me a recommendation. I want to know the name of that mediwitch and I want to know why you recommended her.”
Lucius nodded, “For the most recent ones at least. Fudge has only been in office for twenty years. My lord, there is something else you should know.” He wasn’t sure how his lord would take this news, “Harry Potter’s mother is the daughter of Dumbledore and Grindewald.”
Dear Sirius,
“You had to of done it wrong, ‘Mione.” Harry exclaimed.
“Draco… I want…” Harry took a deep breath and tried again, “I want you to make love to me.”
“You are like the handlers.”
“Tom?”
James snorted, “So how are we going to get the kids out of there then? With you declared ‘unfit for duty’ that leaves just Snape. And it’s going to be hard to pull him away from Remus at the moment.”
After all their things were collected he shrunk the trunks and placed them in his pocket. Sitting on the bed he shook Harry’s shoulder to wake him.
“We are not sure yet, but all my memories are of pain and anger. Over the last thirty years of my life I’ve killed, maimed and cursed many people.”
The one thing he did recall was that she had been good at potions, not phenomenal like he was, but good. He supposed it was one thing Granger didn’t loose in the blood adoption.
Chapter Seventeen
“Let’s wait until we are all gathered together. I think that the adults can explain things better.” Hermione said.
Ron heard Umbridge address the lord as he left the room.
Harry and Ron gaped at her again. Malfoy’s cousin?
“Yours?” he asked.
Blaise came over and sat next to her, “Harry is resting. Draco won’t leave his side, nor his mom.”
Remus closed his eyes and opened his senses to the surrounding area hoping to catch Severus’ scent. He stood there taking in all the scents, filtering out the werewolf smells and house elves immediately. There, the subtle smell of peppermint and coffee.
“Don’t get up Kelston, I need some answers.” Lucius said as the man began to rise. Kelston slumped back into his chair as the couple took the empty chairs on the other side of his desk.
The man gave a snarl, “And has there been any word of Dumbledore?”
One by one they placed a single drop on the paper and slowly the child’s families were revealed. Two pages stood out amongst the others and the couple could only stare at the first of the two in total shock.

Born July 31st 1980
A crowd of people entered the foyer from somewhere and there were shouts of shock and some fear. Warily Harry glanced up but his eyes wouldn’t focus on anyone. A redish blur came into his line of sight and pulled him into the persons grasp. He knew that it was a woman, too skinny to be Mrs. Weasley, but he couldn’t tell.
“MTAC.” Gibbs moved to the stairs and Harry followed with Fornell on his heals.
Fornell smiled, “Already showing him your office?”
Of when he was six and he was knocked down the stairs by Dudley and broke his leg and his aunt threw him in his cupboard with no medical treatment. Luckily his magic healed him or he would have never been able to walk again. Of when he was ten and Vernon made him suck him off then beat him for vomiting afterwards. When his Hogwarts letters came he had a small reprieve because they thought that the house was being watched.
Hello all. I promised myself that I’d have this out before Christmas and here it is.. Hope you all enjoy it. K
“A drop of your blood will be sufficient Miss Granger.” He pulled out a small paring knife from his robes and handed it to her, hilt first.
“That would limit their capability to apparate. Small children cannot apparate or they’d smother and pregnant carriers would loose their child with the stress on their body.” Tom said. “Let’s gather a recon team and check out all of these locations so as not to make a mistake. It could be that there are wolves in all locations. If so, I want to know.”
“I have to shower! Do my hair! Pick out clothes! Harry, first impressions are very important!” Draco shrieked in a very unMalfoy like manner.
Draco slowly pulled the other boy to his feet, gave him a gentle squeeze and left. No words had been said but it seemed that a sort of truce came over them. Over the course of September they met together secretly and talked. They talked of school, Quidditch,everything but the one topic, Harry’s cutting.
Gibbs spoke before the other could, “FBI Special Agent Tobias Fornell. How do you know Harry?”
Severus stared at the girl, very surprised. Separated from a pack for so long and all she knows is what the Ministry told her. He sighed heavily. It was going to be a long night. He was just glad that the full moon was a week away. That would give his mate and Tom time to rescue him.
“But he is not here, I am. I do not understand. I have had many mates. That is the way.”
He knew that he should have stopped Granger from making that potion. Now all their plans will be ruined just because he screwed up. He was lucky that the Master didn’t crucio him for it. He was promised untold riches if he did this and got Granger to marry him. Then the entire Lestrange vaults would be his for the plundering. Not that Granger would have been aware of this.
Remus bowed his head submissively to his mate. Severus had never forbade him anything before but now was not the time to challenge that.
Sirius dragged himself out from under the table, “Then why didn’t the little brat tell us that?”
Tom gave a nod, “I will go with you. Two people would be better at hiding than a group. Lucius and Rudo will go to the second site and Severus and Remus to the third.”
“Sleeping, but I have a question. Mrs. Malfoy just showed up at our door asking to see him, she was nervous. Do you know what’s going on? No one has told us anything. You guys just pulled us out of Hogwarts with no warning.” Colin grumbled.
The man stopped struggling and looked at her, “Lily?”
Peter Pettigrew, aka Wormtail, quailed under the wrath of his true master. It was just recently found out that the Potters were missing from Azkaban. They had known of the other breakouts, it was all approved by his master, but the Potters were not on the list of those the Death Eaters were suppose to be released. They hadn’t been obliviated and could cause serious harm to their cause if they talked to the wrong people.
Narcissa gasped, “Grindewald!”
Hermione groaned as she opened her eyes. Her gaze fell on Snape sitting on a chair next to the sofa she was lying in. Seeing him reminded her why she was on the floor. Snape called her ‘Miss Lestrange’ and after that she promptly fainted.
Severus roused as Lily tried to take the child and he held him tighter growling at her. Lily and Narcissa backed away from him in shock. His eyes looked glassy and unfocused and he tried to glance around, “Remy?” his voice was raw and gravely almost as if he’d been screaming a lot. “REMY!?”
“Bloody hell, ‘Mione, what was all that about?”
Hermione jerked up and stared at him, “Wha…?”
“So it’s all true then? Everything? Kids being taken from their parents and given to Muggles?” Sirius asked.
Tom sighed exasperated, “That is what I’ve been telling you, Potter.”
Harry took out his wand and levitated an afghan to wrap around the two of them. Exhausted they fell asleep right there on the floor.
Sighing heavily he moved to the bed and layed down next to the man he’d been in love with for 90 years.
The assembly bowed and filed out. Lucius waited on one knee before him waiting for him to speak.
“Enter.”
Tom knew he was watching. He could feel Black’s gaze on him. He wondered what the man was thinking about. Was he thinking how they got together, or was he thinking of their child. It was something he too could not stop thinking about. From his memories that he possessed he had little interaction with the Black heir. Mostly from the battlefield he glimpsed vaguely the shaggy black hair and his barking laughter, very like his cousin. Although Bella’s seemed more from madness.
Severus struggled with his bond too and with Umbridge distracted he broke free. He screamed in rage as Remus writhed under the curses being held on his lover and swept across the room. He wrapped his hand around the mans throat and twisted. A satisfying crack resounded in the room and the man fell to the floor dead.
Albus smiled, “He is a natural at Quidditch, which he got from his father, and he excels in Charms and Defense. He has his father’s messy black hair and you’s and Lily’s eyes.”
Harry interrupted him, “He knows about me.”
When they apparated back to the manor they saw that Lucius and Rudolphus had returned as well. Fenrir was concerned that Remus and Severus were not back yet.
BLOODLINE AND HERITAGE POTION
“Miss Granger, I do not have all the answers. There are others who have more knowledge on that day than myself. Now, if you would kindly remove yourself from my quarters I have my next class to prepare for.”
The figure threw himself at Albus and burried himself in his robes. Albus ran his hands through the ratty blond hair with tears coursing down his own cheeks. The man was thin and dirty. The conditions in this prison were worse than Azkaban.
Severus shook his head, “No, I only know my own cub. He is just two years old.”
Nearing the entrance of Azkaban prison Tom pulled his wand out and sent a powerful blasting curse at the gates. Once the gates were down the Death Eaters flowed through heading to their assigned locations to free their companions.
“Are you finished, Miss Granger?” He ignored the two boys.
After four days of grueling work it was done. Hermione sat back and breathed a huge sigh if relief. The potion was done.
Severus stood in the doorway of his rooms gazing at his mate and child. He’d been so afraid that he would never see them again. Now that he was back at the Manor, he never wanted to leave their side. He needed to make them all safe. And he knew just how to do that.
FALLACY
Chapter Twenty One
Remus and Sirius gaped. She didn’t know what a forest was?!
Tears began to flood the normally stoic man, “He’s been captured.”
Harry looked perplexed, “I saw Draco and ‘Mione if that’s what you mean.”
“You are all dismissed.” The lord stood as they filed out.
“Does it have anything to do with why you smell different?” Fenrir asked.
“Dumbledore told me that Gellert was good with stasis spells. His theory was when the man found out he was pregnant he placed a strong stasis charm on the fetus, possibly so it would not interfere with his plans. After he was captured the stasis slowly deteriorated and the child began to grow. When the guards at Nurmengard found out they took her and placed her with muggles.”
“Come on, Harry. We need to get to breakfast. Someone will question where you’ve been. We gotta get up.”
He glanced around the room and was surprised to see the Headmaster standing at the doorway to the main sitting room, his arm wrapped around that of a thin and sickly looking man who looked to have spent decades in Azkaban. He spotted his father talking to a tall dark haired man. He walked over and almost fell in shock as he recognized that face on the other man.
Lily sat next to Harry and tipped his chin so she could look into his eyes. “You really do have my eyes.”
The very next morning Hermione began preparing her potion. Most of the ingredients were bought at an apothecary. The Dragons blood was shipped from Romania by Charlie Weasley at her request. All she needed now was the Venom from Professor Snape.
In his private rooms he went to the fireplace and threw in some floo powder calling out, “Malfoy Manor!” then stuck his head into the flames.
Hermione spoke up, “I don’t think that mine knew. Mum was always going on about our possible link to Royalty and such, which brought us to this revelation.”
Severus came into view of the mirror so he could speak to his godson, “Draco, I’m here with Dumbledore at the Manor.”
FALLACY
She smiled, “Yes, Sev, it’s me. I’m not dead. Please let me have the child. Let Cissa check you over.”
Lily stood up and went to James linking her arm through his elbow. Licius turned to Tom as the man was about to get up, “Tom, I think that it would be best for you to remain here. I don’t think that Black would appreciate your appearance as of yet.”
The burn in his arm felt good in comparison to the nightmare he’d woken up from. Rememberace of his summer with the Dursley’s. He gritted his teeth as both tears and blood flowed.
“Gel, I need to ask you a few questions.” He pulled the other away from him and looked into vibrant green eyes. Lily’s eyes, Harry’s eyes.
Just then Lucius walked in, “Severus, how are you? Is everything ok with Draco?”
“She had my hair and your lovely green eyes.” Albus said. “She was a very talented witch with a temper just like yours, my love.”
“What is the point of it all? Why make the Wizarding world believe that there are muggleborns?” Tom mused.
Severus looked at her. “Handlers? Who are they?”
“Bella, you are not hallucinating. We are here, along with our Lord.”
The room they went into was full of computer screens and electronics. Harry glanced around at the people there until Gibbs snapped out a “Clear the room!” order and they did. The only person who didn’t leave was a black man with a mustache.
Tom nodded. It made sense. Force a change on someone and release it near a town to increase the belief that werewolves are dangerous.
Hermione stared at the canopy of her bed in the girls dormatory that night. She could not sleep. The words from the page kept jumping out at her.
“Draco, is Harry nearby?” Sirius asked.
“Oh, my lady… your awake.”
James sighed, “Alright, I’ll tell you something that you told me… In our first year after we were sorted your mom sent you a Howler in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast screaming about you being sorted into Gryffindor and being a disgrace to the House of Black, but later an owl was sent to our dorm room with a single line written on it… it said: I’m proud of you, son. I was the only one there when you received it and you knew it was from your father.”
She spotted a few potential ones that she thought would be challenging as she flipped pages. As she got to the back of the book, the last potion in it popped out at her.
Deciding to take a break he called for a house elf for lunch. He contemplated the changes that have happened in the last few days. He wasn’t a ‘Dark Lord’. He didn’t kill the Potters. He was lover to Sirius Black. He had a son.
Very slowly Harry nodded and began a long story that began just shortly after he arrived at the Dursley’s. Of when he was five years old and being told he was supposed to make dinner. His burnt hands and the beatings afterwards. Of when late one night Vernon was drunk and came into his cupboard and started touching him in his private places. The smacks across his face when he tried to tell his aunt what happened the next morning.
Hermione gave Harry an exasperated look, “Because I want to become a Potions Master.”
Harry and Ron exchanged glanced that stated that the bushy haired witch was crazy and went back to their essays.
Paternal Grandmother: Ursulla Salene Lestrange nee Flint
Lily growled at him, “Well, you would too if you just found out that your not really who you think you are. Great Mogana, I’m the daughter of Grindewald and Dumbledore. Wait a minute, Albus had defeated Grindewald in the fourty’s-”
“Alright enough of this speculation, Lils and I would like to see our son… and I’m sure that Sirius would like to see his son also.” James broke in. He never was one for politics, he preferred straight out fighting.
“Mr. Potter, what a pleasure it is to finally meet you.”
Focusing his power on a single point, a weak spot, he sent a blast of raw magic at the wards. Within seconds they shattered and alarms blared throughout the compound. Tom smirked, distraction underway.
And he turned back to the sitting room where Narcissa sat clutching the pages he threw at her. She gave a start as he sat on the opposite couch from her. Sirius just ignored her, waiting for Lucius to return.
Kelston swallowed at the look on the man’s face. “She came to the hospital just a few years before, her name was To-”
Lucius came and sat with his wife, “Yes, it’s all true. The one who found out was my niece, Hermione Granger as you know her. Bella had such a difficult time with the labor and we were told that it was a stillbirth. We did some reaserch and found that the same mediwitch who helped with the birthing was also present in many other stillbirths from Dark families. The woman's name was Toriana Forgan…”
A growl pushed it’s way past his lips before he knew what he was doing. Flashbacks of the orphanage came to the forefront of his mind, of the matron forcing him into a cage for punishment. His worst was when she’d brought a priest and tried to have him exorcised of ‘bad spirits’. Three days later they’d found the priest dead with no apparent wounds.
“Greyback, you have no say in Remus’ life any longer. Besides that, he is an adult and MY MATE. If anyone has the right to order him to remain behind it would be me!”
“Lucius Malfoy had all the Muggleborns and Muggle raised children presently in Hogwarts tested with the Heritage Potion. Every single one of them came back as being blood adopted by muggles that was approved by the Minister for Magic.”
Lucius poured two glasses of brandy and handed one to Snape, “Oh? What could that be.”
And with that Fornell left MTAC.
Harry slapped him on the arm, “Hey, Gryffindor’s present! So what about all the others? I mean there are at least twenty Muggleborns at Hogwarts now. Are you saying that they are all from Pureblood families?”
He stomped over to them and with a snarl demanded, “Where the bloody hell have you been all his life?!?”
James Potter came over and enveloped them both within his strong arms. Discreetly Sirius left the room.
Tom groaned and sat up when he heard Lucius’ voice. “What are you doing here? You were supposed to wait until I called you.”
Lucius took a quick glance at his lords face then dropped his gaze back to the floor. Best explain as fast as possible, “My Lord, do you recall the night that Bella had her child?”

When Severus didn't appear Remus began to shake, “No! Nooo!” he collapsed to the floor in anguish.
Sirius froze and turned back to Lucius. His expression was one of such anger that Lucius took a step back, “You dare mention their names after what that… thing did to them! How dare you!”
These were some of the questions that he hoped would be answered when he got his memory back.
A/N: There is no MAIN PAIRING!! The story is about all of them! Albus/Gellert are Lily’s parents, Bella/Rodolphus are Hermione’s parents, Fenrir/Tala are Remus’ parents
“Lucius, open the cells and lets see the conditions they are in. If they are sane we will take them with us.”
________________________________________
Just then the door opened and two figures stood there and Harry’s eyes widened as he saw them.
Fifteen minutes later Blaise and Hermione came through the door.
Lucius snorted, “Oh he’s just going to love that.”
“Mr. Malfoy, might I inquire as to what’s been happening while I've been away?”
Paternal Grandfather: Alan Ford Potter
A bushy head poked through and Snape sneered at the Gryffindor.
Please meet me at the Manor tomorrow at 2pm. If you have any love for your family, please come.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked cautiously.
Blood Adopted Mother: Diana May Creevey ‘nee Holden
“Luc, what…?” Narcissa stopped at the look in her husbands eyes. He only ever looked like this when he was on a war-path.
Sirius shook his head, “Harry, there’s something you need to know. When Malfoy and Riddle went to Azkaban to ‘liberate’ their followers they found someone they never expected in the depths of Azkaban. Malfoy thought she was delusional until he saw too.”
“But… Lily was born almost twenty years later. How is…”
The cruciatus curse hit him again and spittle dribbled from his mouth and he prayed that his master wouldn't make him go mad like the Longbottoms.
The youth nodded, “Yes sir. Do they know that we are not their children? With the Ministry behind all this they’d have access to the Obliviators and could modify memories of births.”
Rodolphus collapsed onto the rich Persian rug in despair. Rabastan fell heavily back onto the chair he stood from with a sob. Lucius Malfoy placed a hand on his brother-in-law’s shoulder.
“Come on, she’s in labor.”
“I watched as she added a drop of her own blood to the page.” He pulled the very page out of his robes. He stared at the words, possible hoping that they would change. “She did the potion correctly, there were no mistakes.” He handed the paper over to Lucius.
Professor Severus Snape was busy grading essays when he heard a knock at his door.
James and Lily clung to each other as one of their best friends writhed in pain from the silver poisoning. Sirius just stared at the two men in shock. The child, Conall, clung to Severus as the man rubbed soothing circles on the child's back.
Harry groaned at this, “Not another portkey, Dray you know I hate portkeys.”
“Locked down? By whom?” Albus demanded.
Severus gave a small laugh, “He won’t eat cereal, Remy feeds him hotcakes and eggs every morning.”
Lily frowned at that, her mind was still in a jumble and it was hard to make sence of it all. A face popped in her mind and she growled, “Peter Pettigrew. He threw a stunnung curse at us and then nothing. Tom, please tell me, what’s going on? Where’s my baby?”
“Come on in, there are a few things you need to know.” And she led him into the house.
When he came to the library he went right to the section on Memory Charms and Potions and began to browse his collection.
He had to clear his throat twice before he could answer, “Yeah, Dray. Be out in a minute.”
Fenrir turned to Tom, “I want to go to the facility closest to my forest. It is the highest probability that my pack is being held there.”
“Lucius, report.” Tom said.
Gently she pricked her finger and let a drop of blood fall onto the parchment. With bated breath they all watched as the paper seemed to sink into the parchment. Then suddenly words began to appear on the paper. None of them could believe their eyes.
Footsteps approached and he looked up to see Lucius coming towards them with Bellatrix by his side.
Harry swallowed, “Will HE be there?”
Rosalind Druella Lestrange (Birth Name)
“Patience love. Now, how about us getting the kids from Hogwarts and having a family reunion? I for one am looking forward to seeing my son.” James smiled.
He followed discreetly behind them. He wanted to know why his cub looked at him like he did. Halfway down the hall he heard a whispered conversation up ahead.
Allistor Moody stomped forward, “They are gone, my lord. Voldemort has them.”
“Sorry, Director. This is private. Please leave.” Fornell said as he came into the room.
“A stasis spell, Gellert was very good at them. Possibly when he found out he was pregnant he placed a very strong stasis on the growing child. After I defeated him, he must have prolonged the spell as much as he could. Then possibly the strain became too great and the spell collapsed causing the child to continue it’s growth.” Albus said breathlessly.
Lucius stared off as he thought about that fateful night and the mediwitch. He needed to find the woman and get some answers. He stood and went to the floo.
“She died, almost ten years ago. As I was saying her name was Toriana Forgan. She had quite a resume, and seemed to fit right in with the staff here. She was a very skilled midwife. It was actually her preferred occupation. She regularly made house calls, especially when the expectant mother was on bedrest or were high risk pregnancies.”
Chapter Fourteen
Fenrir shook his head, “Those that were taken were our children and carriers. Most of the Dom’s were out hunting when the attack happened. My own mate was among those taken.”
A few hours earlier…
Blood Adopted Father: Gerard Cole Granger
“Honestly, you two are so clueless. Come on, dinner.”
“They take care of us, give us mates. Are you to be my mate?” She began to circle him, her nose sniffing the air.
Lucius swallowed, “My lord… to put it bluntly… there are no real muggleborns.” And he cringed at the Dark Lords frown.
“Lucius, what’s this Mopsy told me? Albus is coming?” Narcissa asked her husband.
“Sirius?”
“Fang, take me to Hagrid.”
Chapter Nineteen
The mediwitch bowed again, backing out of the room. As she past the doors she removed the silencing spell she placed around the room.
Pairings: Hermione/Blaise; Harry/Draco; Side Pairings: Bella/Rodolphus; Lucius/Narcissa; Severus/Remus; James/Lily, Tom/Sirius (and some other surprise pairings)
“Extra Credit? What do you need to do an extra credit assignment for? You’re already at the top of the class.” Ron exclaimed.
“My Lord, I…” He really had no idea where to start. His lords main goal was to stop the muggleborns from corrupting the ideals of the Wizarding world. Now that this new information has come to light would his lords cause continue? “I have come across some startling information, and it could quite possibly change our priorities.”
“Bella!”
“I agree with you, Lucius.”
Paternal Grandmother: Helen Marie Potter ‘nee Longbottom
“Tom, please Severus. I think that Lord Voldemort can be put to rest. Once my memories are back…”
Lucius stood up to greet his guests, “Albus, thank you for coming through. May I inquire as to who this is?”
Lucius called a house elf and ordered lunch to be brought.
When his boyfriend collapsed Draco cried out in surprise and rushed to his side ignoring the sounds of the others around him. He vaguely heard Hermione call for help as he soothed Harry. Then he was pushed aside as a red haired woman pulled Harry into his lap and began to soothe him too.
Sirius glanced at her for a second then glanced through the pages. His eyes began to widen as he got to the bottom, but what made him really gasp were the last four pages. Those of Hermione, Harry and two boys, Colin and Dennis Creevey. He read the words on Colin Creevey’s parchment in disbelief.
Fenrir wanted to follow the trio out and find out why his cub felt such hatred for him. The last he’d seen of his cub was over thirty years ago when he was just a small pup. Now here he is, a grown man with a cub of his own.
DMHPDMHPDMHP
“Like Bella.” Narcissa stated. She remembered the few time Bella had almost lost her baby to miscarriage. She was on almost constant bedrest after her first big scare. The two of them were in Diagon Alley baby shopping and Bella took a heavy fall onto her stomach.
About halfway further down the hall they came to a set of cells that were so cloaked in concealing charms it was a wonder that Bella even knew they were there. Tom peered into the first cell and gave a start. He heard Lucius gasp as he looked into the other cell.
He turned to leave. Lucius gave a sigh and said five words, “James and Lily are alive.”
He felt a hand on his shoulder pushing ham back down and a gentle voice in his ear, “Shhh, Sev, it’s ok. Remus is safe and you child is safe. Your at Malfoy Manor.”
“Let’s get that taken care of first, Tom.” James said. He glanced at Severus, “If you would…”
The door swung open and Fenrir Greyback stepped into the room. The two men regarded one another for a moment and Greyback sneered, “There is something different about you, My Lord.”
Draco frowned uncertain as to what to say, “Yes, but he can’t talk right now. I’ll fill you in on all that I know when we get home.” And then the mirror went dark.
Albus looked up at the animagus, “Why’s that?”
Draco sat thoughtful for a few minutes and decided, “Let’s wait until Severus is brought home. Let’s see how you feel after a few more days of rest.”
Harry spoke up from where he sat, “What do we know of that almost every witch and wizard have contact with?” Everyone turned to look at him, “The Daily Profit. Very few people don’t get the Profit. What if the spell or potion was on the paper?”
Lucius looked at Tom in surprise. Tom was never one to associate with children. It seems the werewolf pups had an impact on his lord.
Lily looked at her son. She realized that her boy was more grown up than most people twice his age. All the lies that told that her boy was this ‘Boy-Who-Lived’ and the trials he’d gone through made her baby grow up faster than any other normal child.
Harry jerked away his eyes unfocused. Draco pulled back until the dark haired boy was fully awake. He’d made that mistake once before and received a black eye for his trouble. Now he sits back until Harry knew where he was.
Maternal Grandmother: Druella Black nee Rosier
The girl spun around and snarled at him. Remus snarled back, “Get away from my mate, bitch!”
Lily smiled back, “Grandpa Gel’s eyes. Harry, I've been meaning to ask you.” Her eyes took on a serious glint and Harry began to squirm. “How did Petunia and Vernon treat you?”
“He,” Fenrir gestured to Tom, “wants to send you on a recon mission.”
“He would not tell me, said something about retrieving something of value. Do you know what he was referring to?” Lucius sat next to his wife just as Mopsy returned with the tea tray and biscuits.
“But…”
“The Creevey boys? Why them? Granger I understand, she’s my cousin, but why those two crazy Gryffindor’s?”
“Now Lucius?” Tom turned to look directly into his eyes, the gleam reminiscent of the old days, “I plan on thwarting the Ministry from ever stealing anymore of our children and returning the lost ones to their proper families.”
Harry and Ron just stared at her.
Of when he came home after his first year at Hogwarts and Vernon shoved him in his cupboard for three days. When he was weak with the lack of food and water he was raped on the floor of his aunts kitchen then made to clean up the mess afterwards.
“No Draco, please… do not call me that… you may call me Riddle or Tom. I’m no longer anyone’s Lord.”
Tom looked at him curiously, “And what is that ‘startling information’ Lucius that has you so stressed that you drop your usual mask.”
“Don’t talk to me about that place, I’ve spent more than enough time to know what it’s like.” Sirius ran a hand through his hair, clearly torn between the desire to know if the man was right and his natural instinct to flee. He sighed, “You have one hour to bring them here, then I’m gone.”
“I for one want to know if they knew or not.” One of the Ravenclaw twins said, his twin gave a nod.
SIRIUS
Tom gave him a perplexed look, “Why do you seem to think that I knew anything about Black’s life before all this happened. He was your friend.”
Ginny moaned as the man above her thrust in one more time and then stilling as he came. He pulled out, got up and dressed.
Rosalind Druella Lestrange (Birth Name)
Remus glanced at the man warily, “What about all those reports about werewolf attacks? And all the children that were reported bitten?”
“Miss Granger, I suppose you are here to inform me of your desired potion?”
Narcissa stood up abruptly and walked out of the room. Moments later she was back with todays edition of the Daily Profit. She dropped the paper on the floor in the middle of the room. Severus drew his wand and cast a revelio. The paper glowed an eerie green in color.
Harry’s mouth dropped open, “All?!” at her sad nod he asked, “Who is your…”
Tom sighed and pulled a chair up next to her putting his wand away. “I don’t know where Black is, not that it matters, and as for your son…” Tom cringed at the hard look the woman sent his way. “He is fine.”
Fenrir gave Tom a nod in greeting and stood back from the crying groups.
Looking in the mirror Harry could see his blood-shot eyes and dark circles under them. He looked like death warmed over. Pulling out his wand he cast a couple concealer charms to cover it all up.
Lucius looked up at the Matron, “I really don’t know how far this all goes. Madame, could you please send for Professor Dumbledore. I’m sure he would like to know that he has a grandson.”
“Yes, he said that he’d been gone and needed some information on what’s been happening.”
And she turned and walked away down the hall. He peered after her, confused. She wanted to see Dennis? Whatever for? He decided to go and see Hermione to find out if she knew anything.
“Can we go back to the Common Room now?” Ron asked. He and Harry decided that they wanted to keep her company throughout the process. Two times she had to place them in a body bind to keep them from knocking her cauldron over.

The girl whined at the alpha showing throat.
“Of course. I suggest trying the weakest potions first.”
He still doesn’t have the whole story from Harry, but he knows that something happens at that Muggle home that gives Harry nightmares. And he was determined to find out what they do to him every summer.
“Coming, they wanted to get some others.” Hermione said.

Blood Adoption approved by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge
“Harry, wake up, we have to go.”
“What do you mean, Tom. I’ve always known your name, Tom Marvolo Riddle.” What was Tom playing at? Why was he acting like this. “What’s going on? Where’s Sirius? Where’s Harry? How’s my little boy? How long has it been?”
“Gibbs knows me, Mr. Potter, only just as an FBI agent. I am also special liaison for the US Magical Ministry. The Secretary of Defense personally offered me this job fifteen years ago. Agent Gibbs and I have work together many times.”
“Very well then, you are dismissed.”
“I always wondered why she was… like that…” Snape pondered his next words, “How much did you know of the Mediwitch?”
“So they were lover’s?” James mused, “I wonder what happened to set them against each other.”
Hermione nodded and stepped forward slowly hands spread.  When she was two yards away the mare turned her head towards her gazing into her eyes. Hermione did not blink as she felt… something… probe her mind, then it was gone and the mare gave a single nod of her head, her spiraled horn bobing with the motion.
Mother: Bellatrix Rose Lestrange nee Black
Tom stepped forward, “I will try them first.”
“Thanks Harry. I just couldn’t sleep.” She leaned into him and he wraped a comforting arm around her shoulder.
Pairings: Hermione/Blaise; Harry/Draco; Bellatrix/Rodolphus; Lucius/Narcissa; Severus/Remus; James/Lily, Tom/Sirius, Albus/Gellert, Fenrir/Tala (Native American, means wolf)
Tom nodded thoughtfully, “That could be worth a shot. Severus, only three of us here are proficient in Legilimency. I will let you into my mind and you try and see where the block is.”
There was a knock at her door, then Blaise poked his head around it. He smiled at her, “Hey.”
________________________________________
Tom took the page and read the words written on it.
Harry sighed and sat back up, “OK, if we have to.”
The deep male voice sent shivers down Ron’s spine, “My Lord, they’ve all gone. Potter, Granger, the Creevey bro-”
“He is just how dad described him to me in my letter. Very straightforward and gruff. He’ll be coming here later around seven.”
Tom turned to look at his old Transfiguration professor and sighed, “To be honest, I am relieved. I feel as if there was something missing in my life and I find out that there really was.” He glanced at Sirius surreptitiously, “I don’t even know how to act any more around people. Was all that I thought I’ve done all a lie? Or is there some parts that are really my own thoughts?”
Hermione just stared at the paper in shock. Two things kept rolling through her head. She was adopted. She was the daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange.
“Tom, how are you handling all this?” Albus asked him.
When Harry awoke in the morning he was greeted with the sight of his boyfriend asleep next to him, the blonds hair in disarray from sleep. He smiled and leaned down and placed a gentle kiss on Draco’s lips. He lay back down and snuggled back up to the other boy, closing his eyes.
After cleaning the child she plucked a single hair from her and placed her in a bassinet and activated the portkey. Bassinet and baby both dissapeared. From her bag she pulled the golum and with the hair whispered a spell which made the golum look like the baby.
Hermione perused the potions book she received from Professor Snape looking for the perfect potion to brew for her assignment. She skimmed past the really easy potions that they’d all learned in the first four years at Hogwarts and flipped to the back of the book looking at sixth and seventh year potions.
Lucius stalked over to them and snatched the mirror from Sirius’ hand, “I don’t have time to argue with you, get everyone together and use your portkey. If you are not here within the hour all of us are storming the castle.”
A single hair of a Newborn Unicorn

Ron swallowed and nodded, Harry nodded too.
Albus looked up in surprise, “James!? You too? Oh Merlin, it’s a miracle!”
For one thing Harry was too small for his age. When Harry had collapsed when they’d first arrived she could tell there was more going on than just a bad reaction to a portkey. She’d discreetly took Narcissa’s wand and ran a basic diagnostic spell. The results were startling to say the least. Harry was only 95lbs and extremely undernourished. All the signs were there and she was surprised that no one noticed anything.
Harry just curled back up to his side and sighed. Draco silently raged at the Muggles who made his love feel less than nothing. Who would tell a small boy that he was unwanted and ugly. A ‘freak’ Harry had told him once.
She frowned, “Why is he at Hogwarts?”
“Not much really, she was a midwife from St. Mungo’s. She was recommended by the Head Healer at the time, Kelston Jorgens, I believe.” Lucius ran a hand through his hair.
But Neville Longbottom was not weak. With the help of his friends he was stronger than his family ever thought. And he was not stupid either. The school was whispering. The students were afraid.
No Birth Name Given
“Get out wolf now! Haven’t you done enough damage.”
James and Lily were once again speechless at what the Dark Lord just said. They looked at one another then turned to Tom. James spoke up, “No Muggleborns? Why do you say that?”
Draco nodded, “I’m not sure that he will tell her. It probably all depends on if she is sane or not.”
“Alpha? Alpha is here?”
Lucius gestured for everyone to take a seat while James began to explain.
Tom looked at her curiously and nodded gesturing for her to lead the way.
Lucius chuckled, “Never thought I’d see the day that Severus Snape would allow James Potter to watch his child.”
Blood Adopted Father: George Albert Creevey
Love Found
Lucius gave a sharp nod, “We are not sure how they did it, we are not even sure who all of the conspirators are. The one we did know died ten years ago. The only link we found was that all the adoptions were approved by the Minister of Magic.”
“Harry, how are you feeling?”
Harry took a deep breath then let it out slowly, “I’ll survive, Mum. I’m glad you and Dad are alive. The rest of it all seems so far fetched. I just can’t imagine what the Ministry would get out of all… this.”
“If you want to meet her ‘Mione then go right ahead. They should be at Malfoy Manor by morning. Tomorrow is a Hogsmeade weekend and we can slip away quietly. Dad gave me a portkey…”
Lily nearly ran to his side and pulled him into an embrace, “Oh Harry, my baby!”
Harry Potter and Ron Weasley glanced up from their Charms Essay as the portrait door opened and Hermione Granger walked in clutching a book to her chest.
“Why don’t you come through Severus.” Narcissa asked.
“Sev!” Remus cried out.
Fenrir stepped towards her holding out his hand palm up, “You may come child, and if we ever find any of your cubs they are welcome to join too.”
Draco gave a start as Harry’s weight landed on his lap. His arms automatically wrapped around the petite waist of the Gryffindor so he wouldn’t fall off.
Tom was quiet for some time after Lucius spoke. He knew that in his own family they were inbreeding. His grandfather had wanted his mother and uncle to have a child together, just to keep parceltounge alive. The dark families were getting thin, and with two wars, Grindewald’s and his own, the population has diminished even more. Many of their followers died on the battlefield or they died in prison. Very few of them survived Azkaban.
Sorry everyone... This is it.. I've been out for a while and this story is done for me...
Harry still cannot believe that his parents were alive and here. For his entire life he was led to believe that they were dead… that they’d died for him, killed by Lord Voldemort… the same man who stood not ten feet from him and his scar never hurt. Then to find out that he never was ‘Lord Voldemort’ and was dating his godfather… plus that Colin was their child. It was a lot to take in.
Minerva groaned, “I remember something that Albus once told me. Many of the Pureblood children have emergency portkey’s that transport them home. We should have confiscated them all, Delores.”
The group was silent after everyone had spoken of the events over the last few weeks. Everyone seemed lost in their own thoughts.
Suddenly the floo came to life and Severus Snape came through cradling something in his arms and right behind him came Remus Lupin, who looked beaten and bruised and collapsed to the floor.
Colin sighed, “I just want to know what’s going on.”
Albus glanced at the Malfoy’s, “It would take a very powerful spell to transfer a child from one mother to another. Either one very powerful wizard or several linked together. And the only way to link would be through a certain artifact, which I know for a fact the Ministry is in possession of.”
It was dark out across the water as they made their way to the giant building in the middle of the ocean. Most of them rode brooms and the others came in a boat able to carry away those they liberated.
“Some nausea left over, but it seems to be settling down. How did your meeting go?”
He frowned, “No, Ma’am, I’m Colin. Dennis is asleep.”
“I apologize Narcissa, but is Lucius around?”
Sirius growled as a house elf quivered in front of him offering a drink. He hated house elves.  His own was a pestilence in his home and could not wait until it died.
Father: Rodolphus Arcturus Lestrange
Rabastan came over to them and said, “We tried to track her down, traced her as far as we could.”
Lucius sneered at the man, “And you never thought anything odd about that? Was she the only one who reported infant deaths? How many?”
________________________________________
FALLACY
Bella shook her head, “I do not know, My Lord. I can’t even imagine why they would be in here. When I saw them the first time I thought they were hallucinations. Then I saw them again one other time and I knew they were here for truth.”
Madame Pomphrey rushed to his side. “Professor!”
Severus shook his head, “No, child that is not the way. Wolves mate for life. You should only have one mate, one true mate, who you bond with and stay with, raise cubs together, run through the forest on full moons.”
“But why the whole charade of your deaths and the prophecy? What does the ministry hope to gain?” Sirius asked.
“Thank you, you may go.” Malfoy said curtly.
“What happened?” Lucius asked them.
Gibbs shot a look at Harry, “Bonded? Died?”
Harry hated traveling by portkey. It made him nauseas and a little scared. One of his experiences with a portkey went very badly for him and he wasn’t so sure that this time will not end up the same. With a grimace he gripped Draco’s hand as he felt the pull and was unceremoniously dropped onto the floor of the foyer. A smooth and delicate hand pulled him to his feet.
Draco’s eyes widened, “Seven! Harry that’s too soon! Look at me! I’m a mess and he’s coming here. I’m not ready to meet him.”
Fenrir nodded, “There are definitely wolves here. Too many to just be one pack and I can’t tell if any are from my pack. Let’s go back and see if the others have found anything.”
________________________________________
“That is not right!” Ron yelled.
“The handlers take them. I know not what happens to them. Do you know any of my cubs?” She looked at him imploringly.
“Mum.”
Ten more minutes and there were ten people standing around Draco and his portkey, a small silver necklace.
HOGWARTS
In the sitting room off of the master bedroom she stopped as three men stood. One dark-haired man stepped forward.
Severus gasped, “Remy!” he cried out, “Stop! I told you, I don’t know where Albus is.”
The lady gasped as she realized she no longer felt the pain in her abdomen, “Where… where’s my baby?”
“We are still not sure exactly, but some of us have a theory. We believe that the ministry is trying to weed out the ‘Dark Blood’ families. By placing our children with Muggles we assume that they are Muggleborns and with the Pureblood fascism towards Muggleborns we are not breeding with our own class, thus eliminating us by breeding us out. Too much interbreeding leads to squibs and deformed children.”
Draco gave a tremulous smile and nodded, “I’ll just shower now, please?”
“Just go away…”
Severus pulled out of Tom’s mind and frowned, “It is not an Obliviate. It’s more like a block has been placed over the memories.”
Warnings: Preg, Mpreg, graphic sex scenes, swearing, child abuse, cutting
“They will pay, Lily, one way or the other.” James promised.
The child though, from what he’d heard, was a Gryffindor and nothing like what he’d pictured his heir to be. He wondered if the boy inherited his Parceltounge. He hoped the boy did have his birthright. It was only proper for the next heir of Slytherin to have it.
“Please, everyone, call me Tom. I’m believe at this point in time that title is no longer accurate. When all the children get here we will try and sort things out and get everyone’s stories told.”
“Severus! That’s not what I meant!”

“She’s be-”
“Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy, what do I owe this pleasure?”
HGBZHGBZHGBZ
“On the count of three, make sure everyone is holding a part. Ready? One, two, three!”
“Report.”
Mother: Narcissa Irma Malfoy ‘nee Black
Draco sighed and walked towards the door. Together they made their way to the Potions classroom to await the rest of their party.
She cocked her head to the side, “Wolf changes…” she looked away from him thinking, then turned back to him, “I am 269 wolf changes. That makes me 22 years and 5 wolf changes.”
Harry turned to the agent. “Would you like to reintroduce yourself to my father please?”
“Lord Fla-” the door shut and the rest of Umbridge’s words were cut off.
Harry was nervous as he waited for Jethro Gibbs to rejoin him. He’d never had a father figure in his life and was uncertain how to handle the situation. In his own letter from his father, or carrier, James just mentioned how understanding and passionate Jethro had been, but also very straightforward. They’d only known each other for a few days so there wasn’t much he knew about the man.
“Mr. Malfoy…” He stopped seeing Narcissa cradled in the mans arms, “What is it?”
Lily stepped fully into the room when she noticed Albus. Her eyes suddenly began to fill with tears. With a strangled cry she ran to him and engulfed him in a hug.
“Then why didn’t mum get put with Dumbledore? Instead she was sent to be raised by muggles! Why?!”
Draco smiled at him. He acted to child like sometimes. He turned to look at the other beds and was relieved to find them empty. The others must have gone to breakfast already. He didn’t want to hear Nott’s complaints again.
She smiled back, “Hey, what’s going on?”
Father: Lucius Abraxas Malfoy
While everyone was out rescuing Snape, James was trying to prevent his wife from going to her sisters house and killing her, along with her obese husband. In all honesty he felt the same way but he knew that until their friends regained their memories he would be without support. The ministry could just very well take them back to Azkaban or even just outright kill them.
Chapter Six
“Mrs. Malfoy, what can I do for you?” he asked politely.
James and Lily snickered at the look on Tom’s face, embarrassment mixed with uncertainty.
“Then by all means, let’s go rescue my son.”
“Of course Albus.” Severus set his son on the couch and stepped over to the other man. After a few diagnostic spells he began a series of healing spells to stabilize him.
“I’ve found him. This way.” Together they made their way through the halls. They met little resistance as they meade their way in the direction Remus’ nose led him. Soon they were at a door that was iron and locked. Sirius pointed his wand at the lock, “Alohamora!”
Well, no longer. That filthy creature dared to touch her baby. Nothing is more fearsome than a mothers wrath.
Tom cleared his throat, “We can determine all that later. The most important part right now is restoring our memories. I for one would be glad to know that I’m not a cold blooded killer. We need to find out how our memories were altered and try to restore them.”
Maternal Grandmother: Druella Black ‘nee Rosier
Fenrir lifted his nose to the air and gave a sniff. There were definitely werewolves here. Too many others do discern weather they are his pack or not. He gestured to Tom and together they backed out towards where they apparated in.
Jorgens began to sweat, “N..nothh..ing… I d…didn’t know… I swear…”
“Leave. Now!” the man ordered.
Draco nodded numbly and turned back to the teens that came with him. Besides Hermione, Blaise and Harry, there was also the Creevey brothers, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Dean Thomas, a seventh year Ravenclaw named Penelope Clearwater, A sixth year Hufflepuff named Frank Corbin, A sixth year Gryffindor he didn’t know, two fourth year Ravenclaws who looked to be twins and a first year Gryffindor.
“Mum? What’s going on? I’ve been trying to get letters out, but my owl just keeps coming back to me with the letters unopened. Something’s happened here at Hogwarts.”
That got the attention of the whole room. Gibbs stared at Fornell. Ziva’s mouth was open in shock.
The mediwitch glanced at the bundle wrapped golum and turned back. “I’m so sorry my lady, but the child didn’t make it… the strain of such a long labor was too much for her.”
Tom signaled Licius and together they went down into the darkest depths of the prison. They came upon many cells with prisoners that were so far gone that they were mindless husks. A few more cell over and Lucius called out.
Severus Snape looked at the young girl lying on his sofa and sighed heavily, “You were not unwanted. You were believed to be dead the day you were born.”
A/N: Takes place in OotP
“That is a very good idea. And it will not raise any questions. Do you have enough potion and parchment?” Dumbledore asked.
Harry glanced at the Muraders Map once more then slowly made his way to his destination. The girls bathroom was cold this late at night and he sighed as he noticed that Moaning Myrtle was not there. He made his way over to one of the stalls, closed the door and sat on the seat.
Severus nodded. He was not surprised that she figured that all out in her head. Most wolves were smart. He wold have bet that many of them, had they been allowed to attend Hogwarts, would have been in Ravenclaw.
“It has come to my attention that a Muggleborn student of your is not really muggleborn, and quite possibly other ‘muggleborns’ as well.” Lucius stated.
Remus Lupin was making dinner when he heard the front door open. He smiled and called out, “I’m in the kitchen, Sev.”
Severus gave a small laugh, “He went to Nurmengard.”
On his right stood Lucius Malfoy, who, to Tom’s eye, seemed troubled about something. He would need to have a talk with the blond aristocrat.
Lily sighed, “I know Sev, Lucius told us what happened to him. But our story is a little more complex and I will explain it all once Remus is awake. Now, I believe you son is awake and has been calling for you. Sirius and James have him occupied in the kitchen trying to feed him cereal.”
Lucius gave a start when the floo activated and Albus Dumbledore’s head appeared in the grate.
Lily moaned, “Great, I wake up not too long ago thinking my baby is still a baby, only to find out that he’s sixteen and already dating! Can the day get any worse?”
Blood Adoption approved by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge
Ron jumped up, papers scattering, “Well, why didn’t you say so. Let’s go.”
Tom cast enevarte on Lily and she awoke with a gasp. She looked about wildly until her eyes settled on Tom and she began to cry.
SSRLSSRLSSRLSSRL
Lucius shook his head, “The place Rudo and I went to was abandoned. No wards, no guards and no sign that anyone had been there in over five years. The only thing still on the place was Muggle Repelling charms.”
A girl… no matter. The mediwitch thought.
“After a time I found a wizard that could get me into Hogwarts and retrieve the Philosophers Stone which would grant me eternal life. I was thwarted by Harry again and I was once again essence floating in nothingness. Then last year Pettigrew found a ritual that would gain me a body and we contrived for Harry to be brought into my presence. When I emerged from the cauldron I looked as I do now, this snake-like appearance.
The elf bowed and disappeared with a pop. A few minutes later and there was a knock on the door.
________________________________________
Colin Creevey gaped in wonder at the room that was provided for him and his brother. If just a week ago someone had told him that he would be in Malfoy Manor as a guest, he would have told that person to go see Madam Pomphrey.
Draco smiled, “How can anyone sleep after such a sweet kiss like that and that delectable body of your snuggled against me?”
Footsteps approached and he turned to greet Severus, a smile on his face. Standing in the doorway was Severus Snape, Potions Matser and Hogwarts teacher, and the love of his life. He moved to embrace him and they kissed, passion filling Remus and he groaned.
Remus lay curled up on his bed with his son asleep close to his chest. His tears were spent and all that remained was numbness. Conell cried himself to sleep when Remus told him that his papa won’t be back. Remus just clung to his baby trying to console the distraught child all the while trying to hold in his own tears. After the boy fell asleep did his tears fall. He prayed that Severus was OK, and that they can rescue him soon. He knew that he would go mad without his mate, not being able to feel his kisses, the caress of his long fingers as they explored his body. The ache in his chest grew with each passing moment Severus was gone from his presence.
They’d almost not made it out of Nurmengard. His bones ached from the strain he’d put on them. He was not used to exertion any more.
He blushed, surprised to be caught staring, “It’s nothing, you just look like someone I know.”
Lucius sneered one last time at the pathetic fool and turned to his wife, “We need to find out who else knew, and we need to test all the muggleborns in that ten year period.”
The person that came in was bloody but Fenrir could tell by smell that it was his cub. He rushed to Remus’ side and rolled him over. A gash was across his shoulder and blood flowed freely.
Then one day as they lay in front of the fire in the Room of Requirement Draco gathered his courage and kissed Harry. It was soft and sweet and Harry loved it.
“Yes, I’m here about your case. And this is a magical matter, as your DB is an undercover magical operative.”
“Years? What is that?”
“When a magical being, Fae in this instance, bond with their mate it connects them on a spiritual and mental level. If one dies so too will the other. Soul mates is the closest reference for you. The magic binds them together and pulls the other with the deceased mate so they are together in both life and death.” Harry explained.
“We don’t know, Harry. The ministry is behind the whole thing. We have all lost children to this.” Narcissa said softly and sadly.
“Might be best, Harry.” Gibbs said. “Do you have a hotel booked nearby?”
Draco frowned, “But mum, we were just there not three days ago. What’s going on, where’s Uncle Sev and Professor Dumbledore. They aren’t here.”
Looking about the room for any indication of where she was at and she spotted the man at the end of the bed. He looked odd to her, but with the shadows it was hard to make out why. But she knew him, no other man she knew can pull off that stance.
Remus stood, nodded to those in the room and left. Sirius watched his best friend leave with a heavy heart. He didn’t see what Remus saw in the dungeon bat but watching him mope around was the most heart wrenching thing he’d ever seen of him. He vowed then and there that he would get Snape out and reunited with Remus and their son.
James gave a small chuckle, “Stubborn git. We’ll go see him, I’m sure that once he see’s us he’ll believe.”
A commotion at the Head table caught his attention and he turned his head. He immediately noticed the two missing professors, Snape and Dumbledore.
Multiple loud pops full the empty clearing heralding the arrival of the rescue team. Tom glanced around at his gathered forces. Twenty of his best men and women were cloaked in black and faces covered in silver masks. Three men separated from the group heading to their destination.
Severus stood and walked over to him, “We will find all that out, Tom. I’ll get started on that list of potions and we’ll see if they’ll work. If not then we need to find out exactly how the memories were removed.”
Paternal Grandmother: Elladora Faye Malfoy ‘nee Prince
Harry nodded and turned to leave. Just then the elevator chimed and a man stepped out. He was older, balding and to Harry he thrummed with magic. He fingered his wand that was up his sleeve.
Harry went to the other couch and was pulled down by the other occupant. He turned to look into the eyes of his boyfriend and those beautiful grey eyes seemed to calm him. He laid his head on Draco Malfoy’s lap and the blonde Slytherin combed his hands through his own hair. The shock seemed to have worn off the Slytherin prince as he observed his cousin and her boyfriend.
Maternal Grandfather: Sygnus Black
Colin Allen Creevey (Adoptive Name)
It all was so far-fetched to him. James had never lied to him and he had no reason to now. So why could he not feel as if any of this was true? Because it’s the Dark Lord! A little voice in his head told him. He could stomach Snape and Moony together, hell he could even stomach Harry and Malfoy Jr. But him and VOLDEMORT! It was just so unbelievable.
James turned to Tom, “So if you don’t know what happened that night, then you probably don’t remember what had Sirius so excited.”
“How is my wife?” Rodolphus Lestrange asked the mediwitch worriedly.
Gibbs nodded, “Seven?”
Lucius breathed a sigh of relief. “So, My lord, what do we plan to do now?”
Pairings: Hermione/Blaise; Harry/Draco; Bellatrix/Rodolphus; Lucius/Narcissa; Severus/Remus; James/Lily, Tom/Sirius, Albus/Gellert, Fenrir/Tala (Native American, means wolf)
“How’s he doing?” the dark skinned boy asked.
After about ten minutes Hermione seemed to calm down and she sat up, still wrapped in Blaise’s arms. She wiped the tears from her face as she took in the sight of her best friend and cousin.
Harry glanced up into the aristocratic face of Narcissa Malfoy and gave a small start of surprise. The woman bore a startling resemblance to Sirius. He gaped at her.
________________________________________
“These are all families that dabble in Dark Arts.” Albus stared at him.
TBC...
Next sat Albus and Gellert, the latter man still looked like death warmed over, although some potions from Snape had greatly improved his appearance. Hermione and Blaise were in the last love-seat and Harry smiled as they cuddled together. Scattered throughout the rest of the room sat the ‘muggleborns’.
Hermione was excited. Snape stepped up to the cauldron and inhaled the aroma, dipped the ladle in checking its consistency and gave a sharp nod.
Draco sneered as Umbridge went to the podium and cleared her throat. Then again. And again. Until McGonagall stood and the Hall quieted. Umbridge gave a sniff in the sudden quiet and then she spoke.
Hermione put a hand on his shoulder, “I know, we all do.”
Tom’s frown became dark, “How does that lead you to believe that there are no muggleborns?”
Bella pulled back and Rodolphus pulled her into a hug, “They have no mind left. I cast the first cruciatis and then everything went downhill from there. You have to understand, baby, I was desperate. We had such a hard time conceiving you that the healers said that I’d only have the one. Then the Aurors showed up and we were shipped off the Azkaban.”
Madame Pomphrey nodded and went to the fire, tossing in some floo powder she knelt down as she called out, “Headmasters Office” and stuck her head in the green flames.
Draco gave a small smile at the dark skinned boy, “He’d been cutting again.”
It was Fornell’s turn to stare, “Mr. Potter, the Statute-”
She sneered at him, “No, he is not and you will tell me where he went, now!” and she flicked her wand at Remus who screamed in pain.
Maternal Grandmother: Druella Black nee Rosier
Albus frowned, “Rat? Peter?”
James smiled at his friend, “Moony, it’s so good to see you up. How are you feeling?”
Making her way to Harry’s room, she knocked quietly. A soft voice bid her enter and she opened the door. Harry was sitting in the window seat looking out at the Malfoy landscape. He turned his head and smiled at her.
Harry cringed at his boyfriends tone, dissapointment. “I’m sorry… it wouldn’t go away.”
James looked at him perplexed, “What’s that supposed to mean? And since when did you started calling Sirius by his last name again? Did you two have a row? Is that why he’s not here? Where is here, by-the-way?”
Draco gave him a hug and laughed, “I’ll be right beside you, Harry.”
“Severus! What a pleasant surprise. To what do I owe this call?”
Harry rolled out of the bed and pulled on his shoes, “Then we’d best get moving.”
Remus and Sirius made their way around to a small door in the compound that smelled like it was used very little. Fenrir followed behind them keeping an eye on the rear. When Tom’s distraction came the three of them slipped into the building.
Tom had spent the last several hours browsing his library without much success. He found a few promising potions but nothing concrete. He knew that he would need Severus for some of these as they were too advanced even for him. The best he could hope for would be to try each one and see which one worked.
“You must push my lady. Your baby’s almost here.”
When she met Vernon Dursley, the muggle seemed so slimy and vile that she feared her sister was under some spell. But Vernon was just a muggle and couldn’t do magic. When Tuni was around the man was all sweetness and could do no wrong in her sister’s eyes. But the one time Lily was alone with him it seemed as if the vileness seeped out of his pores and she’d fled to James’ arms. Her, a powerful witch, was afraid of some slimy muggle.
Ever since he was a boy everyone has called him weak or squib. It was only until he turned eight that his family knew he had magic, even then they were never sure he would be powerful. Not like his father, the Auror, the one his whole family raves about. The man who is now a drooling mess at St. Mungo’s Hospital.
Chapter Nine
Severus looked thoughtful for a moment and then gave a small gasp, “He left shortly after finding out about Lily being his daughter did he not?”
“Sixteen! My baby is sixteen years old! I never got to see him grow up. Why? What did Peter hope to gain from all this? Did he raise Harry? Has he corrupted my baby against us?” She began to wail and Tom sat there flummoxed. She was wailing over lost time with him here in the room, the man who killed them, at least in his mind he killed them.
James and Sirius winced in sympathy.
It’s been two days since he’d learned of his parents being alive and they’d not left him alone since. Draco had been especially difficult to avoid. Two days without cutting left him at a breaking point.
Sirius growled, “Damocles Belby.”
“No, I believe things to be worse off than that. A mediwitch midwife delivered some babies about ten years ago and stole a few of them, letting the parents believe that the child was stillborn. I have records from the Hospital about this woman and who she took children from.”
Tom Riddle stood by the fireplace, a glass of Firewhiskey in his hand. He kept bringing it to his lips then stopping and lowering his hand. He kept glancing to his side where Sirius sat by the window trying hard not to look in the man’s direction.
Tears began to fall down Harry’s cheeks. There was no hiding it now. Everyone will know how much of a freak he really was. Now no one will love him. Draco will leave him and he will be sent back to that hellhole to be his Uncles punching bag and house elf, not to mention those other things.
Harry glanced at Draco, his boyfriend for all of six months. Since the beginning of the school year. It was kind of sudden for both of them…
“Night.”
“Yes, she died ten years ago, at least that was what the St. Mungo’s administrator says.” Lucius stated.
Sirius frowned, what did all that mean?
2 red rose petals
“Anything could have happened to the brew without your knowledge. It is just a precaution.”
“We will figure that all out eventually, Harry. For now I want you to rest.” Lily looked around them room noticing someone missing, “Where is Draco?”
“But-”
1 Gillyweed pureed
Hermione gave a curtsy and approached them. The foal gave her a sidelong glance then gave a soft wicker. He bowed his head to her and presented his mane for her.  Taking a single strand of hair firmly in her grasp Hermione gave a sharp pull and the two inch strand came away. The colt jerked back almost tumbling but the mare steadied him. The two Unicorns then turned and walked away.

Draco tilted Harry’s face up to look in his eyes, “This doesn’t help, love. It only makes it worse.”
Lily stirred, groaning, “What happened?”
With a heavy sigh he stood with Gellert still wrapped in his arms. He then transfigured the bench into a comfortable couch and laid Gellert down, covering him with his cloak. Moving over to the fireplace he pulled a pinch of floo powder from within his robes. Lighting the fire and throwing a pinch he called out, “Malfoy Manor!” and stuck his head into the flames.
Lucius smiled, “Don’t worry son, everything will be explained shortly. How about we get all these children settled into rooms and then we can all tell out tales. I for one will be glad to finally have the whole story.”
Maternal Grandfather: Sygnus Black
Lucius knelt down next to them, “Remus, where is Severus?”
“Only one mate? I have had many mates… and many cubs.” She said that last part very quietly, sadly.
________________________________________
“This is nothing of the sort, Sirius. If you want I can have them brought here, although they are still recovering from their ordeal…”
Draco came over to him and pulled him into his arms, “What wouldn’t go away?”
“And do you require any help in aquiring the ingrediants?”
“Rosalind?” she said in a breathless whisper.
“It’s a Potions manual that Professor Snape let me borrow for an extra credit assignment.”
“Is not necessary for family.” Harry said to him. “Can we discuss this somewhere more private, sir.” He looked at Gibbs, “Not the elevator.”
Severus nodded, “Of course My Lord. I’ll get started on those right away.”
It was wonderful to be able to think clearly after so long being trapped within her mind. She moaned as her head began to ache. Slowly she opened her eyes and she noticed a shape beside her. Her husband lay there sleeping. She breathed his name, James.
Hermione swallowed hard and gave a infinitesimal nod. Bellatrix lept to her feet and grabbed her daughter in a fierce hug crying, “My daughter, my Rosie.”
Draco turned to his father in shock, “Father?”
“Now what do we do?” he asked no one in particular.
“Petunia!? Oh my poor baby! If that husband of hers ever touched my son…” She began to wail again crying about all that she’d missed with her baby. James and Tom were uncertain how to handle this.
“She is very bright, top of most of her classes. Spends most of her time in the library or browbeating Potter and Weasley into doing their schoolwork. I think the chit should have gone into Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor.”
The door opened with a bang that made them jump and Snape strode into the unused classroom.
“From my own recollection I have no memory of the man so how can I take offence. Well, Lucius, what did you tell him?”
Draco gulped, “My L-”
“I told him I’d bring them over, he gave me an hour then he’ll leave.”
“Yes, Harry, that’s exactly what I’m saying. Lucius and I traced the reports of all suspected stillborn babies. The mediwitch who delivered Rosalind was also present for many other stillbirths that we suspect were not really stillbirths, but children stolen and placed with muggles to raise.”
“Hey, ‘Moine.”
“Why not try Legilimency first?” Snape asked.
“Your dead… they just want me to join them. You guys are dead…”
He cleared his throat, “What kind of answers?”
Harry shook his head, “I sure hope it’s worth all this, ‘Mione.”
Tom called Lucius over to them, “What did it look like? Any defenses?”
Lily Potter may have been sleeping through a drug induced daze for the past fourteen years but she was not blind. And she knew what her sister’s husband was like. Oh he may spout his lies about being ‘normal’ but Lily knew the truth. She knew from the first glance she had of the man and a quick glance into his mind. The man was disgusting. Preying on innocent children for pleasure. She will be visiting that man very soon, make no mistake. Her baby lived with that man and there was no doubt in her mind that he did something to him.
Tom cursed the werewolf’s sensitive nose. Even his slight change in sanity was noticeable to the wolf. “Certain things have been brought to my attention. What brings you to my door Greyback? Is your pack in trouble?” Not that he really cared about werewolves, but they have been loyal to him, at least he thought they were.
Sirius Black looked up at the Manor in trepidation. The last time he’d been at this Manor was when Cissa got married and then just a few years later he’d been sent to Azkaban. The only good thing he remembered about the place was his final farewell to his favorite cousin.
Sirius sneered, “I’m sure that Wormtail told you lots of things about us all.”
“Just the runespoor venom, sir.”
Severus sneered at the Malfoy lord, “He is not the immature child we fought in school, Lucius.”
It had been three weeks since Harry, Hermione and all the Muggleborns disappeared too. Neville was sure that Ron knew what was going on as he seem more furious than concerned. Neville just hoped that Voldemort didn’t have them. He hoped that they were all ok.
ADGGADGGADGGADGG
Blaise shook off his momentary shock at that and took off for Gryffindor tower.
Born: May 14th 1983

Harry forced a smile on his face, “Fine, just a little overwhelmed.”
Lucius handed a copy of the list to Dumbledore. Albus scanned the names on the list. The ones he knew were convicted Death Eaters popped out at him.
“Yes, sir. I would like your permission to test those muggleborn students that are here.”
Her mind was going in circles and she could not sleep. Getting up she went down to the common room and sat down staring at the dying fire.
“He is not a baby anymore. He is sixteen.” Tom said.
Hermione sat up, “No Colin, its fine. How’s your brother?”
“Grandson? I have a grandson? I had a child, Al… I’m so sorry I never told you… so sorry.” The man started to weep. “I don’t even know if it was a girl or boy… they just took it as soon as I delivered. My baby… gone…”
“The same people that made me who I am, the ministry, although we are still not sure why.” Tom sighed.
Remus grimaced as a tender spot was rubbed when Conall climbed on his lap, “Feels like my days after the full moon.”
“Harry, Ron, time for dinner.” Both boys jumped at her voice.
Chapter Twenty
“I’ll have to arrange it. They were just hear yesterday. Bella wanted to meet her daughter and Harry was with her for support. I do have one little thing to tell you two… Harry is dating my son Draco. And Miss Granger is dating Mr. Zabini.”
Snape looked up from the paperwork he’d been grading and sneered at her. “Top shelf left hand side.”
Sirius smiled, “I gave Harry my two-way mirror. He should have it on or near him.” Hew pulled the other half of the mirror out of his pocket and said the activation word. The mirror began to glow blue and Sirius called out, “Harry! Harry, answer the mirror!”
“Good idea.” Lucius called a house-elf to him and gave her instructions to gather some people together for recon missions.
“What do you mean by that, Malfoy.” Tom demanded.
“Peter is working for the Ministry. The entire ‘Dark side light side’ thing is all their doing. On the night of our ‘death’ we were not killed but taken to Azkaban. They put us in stasis and kept us like that until the break-in by Tom and Lucius. Tom, obviously, didn't kill us because he was not dark. He was dating my best friend, who we just recently found out was pregnant that night. Peter somehow changed Tom’s memory that night and placed a spell on him that sent his spirit in to some kind of astral projection. Gave out Harry a scar and left with Sirius where he set up the scene of his destruction of those muggles and the incrimination of Sirius.”
“Then send one the the boys!”
Disclaimer: I don’t own Harry Potter nor do I make any money from this story, Just having some fun with the Characters
Her racket roused the man sleeping next to her and he moaned. “Lils?” His voice was row with disuse but Lily heard and her wailing stopped.
Lily pulled Harry into her arms and gently rocked him as his tears fell. Movement came from the door and she saw Draco standing there, horror etched on his face. Tears were cascading down his pale cheeks too and Lily held out an arm to welcome him into them. The blond tore across the room and threw himself into her arms as well as wrapping his own around Harry. Lily didn't know how long they sat like that, nor did she care.
FALLACY
Loud jeering broke out at the Gryffindor table and Umbridge screeched, “Silence! This school has been completely lacking of late, and I will have it brought to order! Now, you are all dismissed to your classes. Anyone who dawdles will receive detention!”
“Creevey.” Blaise said.
Maternal Grandfather: Orion Regulus Black
Albus Dumbledore glanced at the entrance of Nurmengard Prison in trepidation. He knew he needed to do this, but it would be doubly hard to face the man after what happened.
Tom turned his attention back to the wards surrounding the compound. Closing his eyes he felt for the magic that held the wards together. He felt Muggle repelling charms and the standard protection charms. No other protections had been placed. He smiled to himself. This would be child's play.
“Fenrir is the Alpha of his pack, if there is a chance of getting more of the wolves away he needs to go with you. We don’t know how the other wolves will react to a sudmissive’s presence. Having an alpha with you will not hurt.” Tom told the Black Lord. Internally he was wondering what had drawn him to the over-excitable man. “Go and get some sleep, especially you Remus, your link to Severus through your mating bond will help you find him faster.”
Taking a deep breathe Albus entered the dingy cell. It was dark, dank and stunk of feces. Albus pulled out his wand and lit the tip with a silent lumos. The light filled the room and the single occupant cringed back away from it.
“You don’t understand Sev, he made me what I am… you don’t know what it’s been like… I was so afraid that Conell would be like me when he was born.”
“Severus, what’s this all about?” Narcissa asked uneasily.
He probably would have broken down if it weren’t for Draco. The blond Slytherin never left his side except for necessity. Draco said that it was for support, but Harry knew that he was also nearby to keep him from cutting. Harry was sure that Draco didn’t know why he cut, but he supposed that the blond could guess with what little he’d said from their conversations. He dreaded the day his parents ever found out…
Harry sighed and shook his head as his mate ran to the bathroom to get ready.
Husband and wife stared at the name on the page in total shock.
“I am not a werewolf.” He said.
They were all quiet for a while then Lily asked, “Tom, what happened to Harry after that Halloween?”
________________________________________
Just as he was finishing the door flew open and an excited red head poked her head in and called to Severus, “Sev, Remus is awake!”
Draco gaped in astonishment. Where’s Dumbledore? And for that matter where was his godfather?! Severus Snape would never have missed his classes no matter how much he complains. He chanced a glance at Harry and gave him an encouraging smile. He smiled back.
Then suddenly Remus collapsed and was still. Severus cried out, “Remy!”
Sirius laughed outright this time, “Don’t let him hear you say that, he was the best Auror in our year. Nothing scares that man… except Lily.” And Sirius gave a small shudder and whispered, “She scares me too.”
Then she set about her task, marking each vial of blood with the name of the student. After she was done and the last student left she took the vials of blood back to her office where Lucius Malfoy and his wife sat, potions ready.
Harry and Hermione smiled at him. Always thinking with his stomach. Together they all went down for dinner.
Fenrir was reunited with ten more of his pack by the time they were back outside to where Tom and the rest of the Death Eaters waited. What surprised him was the dozen children surrounding Tom. He recognized a few and realized that they were children from his pack. A few of those with him also recognized them and ran towards their children. Cries of “Mama or Papa” rang out as the children were reunited with their parent.
Steeling himself for the confrontation he entered. The warden came up to him and asked what he wanted. When Albus told him the man paled but eventualy took hm to where he wanted to go.
Draco glanced down at Harry and the dark haired Gryffindor sat up, “I have had some news from my father. They are attacking Azkaban tonight.”
Remus raised and eyebrow, “…and?”
“Severus, I have a list of potions what might help us all get our memories back.” Tom said to the potions master.
They came to a large sitting room and together they sat down on a couch. Narcissa grabbed a parchment that sat on the nearest table and handed it to him, “This is what I wanted you to see.”
“What is all the yelling! There are children trying to sleep!” Remus snarled at Fenrir. His head understood that the man was his father, but his heart cannot accept that fact until the man can prove himself.
Tom cleared his throat, “If you are referring to Black then I have no idea where he might be, as for what happened… I’m not so sure any more. Either my memory is faulty or you two are really dead and this is all just a bad dream.”
“That went well, don’t you think?” Hagrid said.
Fenrir crept up to the door where the conversation was taking place. A board creaked under his foot and he cursed as the talking stopped. The door flew open and the stern face of Snape sneered at the Alpha werewolf.
Ron Weasley was annoyed. He’d looked all over the school and Harry and Hermione were nowhere to be found. He was sure to get it when the others found out. Making his way up to the Headmistress office he barked out the password and stomped up the stairs.
James poked his head out from under the table, “He didn’t want breakfast. Kept throwing the stuff at us.”
Narcissa spoke up, “There are other things that need to be discussed also, Bella.”
“Some of the younger ones yes, my parents were taken to another place. These men attacked our pack and brought us here. I don’t know how long we have been here.”
Albus sighed, “I can only assume it would be to trick the wizarding world into believing there are Muggleborns, although if there are no Muggleborns then Voldemorts ideals are no longer valid.”
Lucius nodded, “That could be. You said that most of those taken were children and subs, right?”
“Your Godfather called on that mirror of yours. We need to leave Hogwarts. Blaise has gone for Hermione and a few others.”
Harry felt sick as the portkey deposited them in the foyer of the Malfoy home. With a groan he collapsed into a heap and began to empty his stomach. Draco was beside him in seconds with soothing words and a bucket. He heard Hermione calling for help as he moaned helplessly and threw up some more.
Hermione just kept running trying to keep up with Fang. Exchanging glances the two boys ran after them.
Tom shook his head then drank the next potion. Once again nothing happened. Ten minutes later after all the potions taken Tom glanced around the room.
“Just a couple of hours ago… Granger was sitting in the common room reading and I saw Potter in the Hall.”
Remus and Fenrir turned to Severus, surprised.
Lily was sitting on a small couch in her sitting room watching her husband and his best friends. They were discussing how best to take their revenge on the Dursley’s for their treatment of her son. No matter how many times she thought about it she never would have thought that her sister was capable of the things she did to Harry. She knew that Petunia envied her her magic, but never would she have thought that it would turn to something so intense as hatred.
As they came closer to the prison a chill permeated the area and many black cloaked figures came their way. He was prepared for this. He pulled out ofhis pocket a talisman and held if aloft letting a trickle of magic flow into it. The dementors suddenly stopped as if frozen and allowed them to pass.
