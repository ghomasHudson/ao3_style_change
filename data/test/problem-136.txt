“I could make it even warmer.” Draco reached up to grip the lily on his necklace, making Harry’s warm up and send a lovely feeling through his body. He felt loved. For the first time in a long time, he felt so unconditionally loved and he basked in it. It was enough to make his cheeks turn red and he looked away. “Cheeky bastard.”
It was rare for the person riding to reach the end before the person being ridden. But Harry’s touches were so sweet they coxed him further and further to the edge, far faster than Harry allowed himself to go. Draco bit his lip and used his hands to force Harry’s hips down, keeping himself lifted up so that he only had the tip inside. He looked down at the confused boy with a smirk. “Beg me to let you cum.”
The hand that gripped him was tight and faster than he had ever touched himself. His noises had become a bit high-pitched and breathless. He was getting very close and Draco could see it. Every little tremble and noise was so cute to him. He loved the sight of his overwhelmed lover.
An owl was sent out when they finished with the list of properties meant to be sold and the profits donated accordingly.
It was embarrassing to admit how much he enjoyed being pleasured from both ends. A hand wrapped around him and his own behind him. Two fingers were a bit trickier to get it but it was no real trouble. He let them sink deeper and arched his back. A soft groan left him along with all thought. His composure remained but had altogether changed. A pillar, he was, of pride. Now he only vied for what made him feel good. He demanded it. It reminded him briefly of his wilder phase in Hogwarts but something was different. This wasn’t just pleasure. It was love. Somewhere within him there was a joy just from seeing the body of the person he loved so dearly. If he didn’t have two fingers up himself, he’d probably have the sweetest smile.
With the media rumors of love potions and curses being used, this escalation in their relationship only called for further questioning. After all, someone might be in danger of abuse or under the influence of serious magic. As far as they were concerned, a crime very well may have been committed. Especially when one considers that only eight months ago, Draco stood by Voldemort's side and Harry was thought to be dead. Yet they were suddenly married now. From the outside it made no sense. It wasn't a far leap to assume foul play or magic was involved.
“I don’t think you could separate them with a crowbar. She’s getting closer and closer to proposing, assuming he doesn’t.”
Harry was practically floored because he had never realized how big of a connection Draco was to Teddy. Up until then, he never would have guessed that Draco could be related to so many prominent people in his life.
He took his time and went back to teaching on Monday. He started his classes off by saying the prank had been pulled by a student, who shall remain unnamed, who hadn’t known the true extent of Harry’s trauma, and didn’t know it would scare him like that. He said that he and the student had a talk and all was forgiven. He asked that everyone respect his decision and let it go. The students did as he asked.
Harry only shrugged, “But why?” He didn't really see the point of surrogates in a small old-fashioned wizard society. It sounded misplaced.
Draco cringed as Harry didn’t get what he was implying. “Yes, but I also have to examine you on the outside.”
An uncomfortable stickiness was left in his underwear as he pulled back slightly, embarrassed by his display. His eyes were still flooded with pleasure as all the little aftershocks still sparked in him. “Apologies.”
The speech was short and to the point. But she then began elaborating on the new tower. “Roommates will be selected at random. Each student will be paired with someone outside of their own house, though there will be some exceptions given the disproportionate amount of people per house who returned this year.”
With Pansy in Wizengamot, he always knew what was going on. By the start of October, the laws that had gotten Death Eaters into so much trouble with Gringotts were made void. Then, Shacklebolt and the young rebels of the war began pushing for the much-needed changes in Wizarding society. From what he's heard, Harry had turned himself into a professional at debating. He was succinct and persuasive. He would enter with his arguments and evidence at the ready; fully prepared to address counterarguments. Harry pushed for change and Pansy told Draco about every step of it.
Draco couldn’t help but to smile at his cute Harry was. “Oh, I just finished a bit of writing. I got ahead of myself and wrote out a little scene for the future, just before they get together.”
She shook his hand and nodded. “Hello, Harry. It’s been a while. I hope Draco is treating you well.”
A while later, Harry realized he missed lunch. “I think I ought to go now. I just missed lunch and I still have some work to do, I’ll try to talk to you lot agai-“
Her lips parted and her hand slowly moved to cover her mouth as he spoke. “Merlin.” She sighed out the name, horrified. “How have things been for you?”
Harry tore into it to reveal it was a radio. No wonder Draco suggest he hide it, Muggle technology was forbidden because being in contact with magic can eventually enchant the object. Normally he wouldn’t believe such a thing, but after being around the Weasley’s flying car, he knew the radio would eventually be magical. But for now, he didn’t care.
After sitting through a few classes together and being separated once more at lunch, Harry, his friends, and Draco all sat together in the common room of their tower.
Yesternight's trip to the library reminded Harry that many students who pursued an advanced study in Defense Against the Dark Arts had access to the restricted section. But it slipped his mind that he could also qualify since he was planning to teach it.
“I don’t gaze into his eyes! It’s just something I noticed.” He’s been defensive about it ever since Ron’s comment back in October. But it made him wonder if his staring was that obvious.
Harry was hounded by a few reporters who he reluctantly spoke to, mostly questions about how he felt about Draco and if he planned on befriending Draco. He said he felt like he seriously misunderstood Draco and that he underestimated his courage and morals. He said he would love to be friends with someone as sly and cunning as Draco.
Alex was quite excited to bruise Garren’s ego. This was mostly because Garren’s friend in The Daily Prophet happened to be a huge prick, and any slight on Garren was close enough for Alex.
He traveled the path that he made for himself, following his plans of media warfare. Somehow, with each step, he doubted himself less and less. The Sorting Hat wasn't wrong to call him half-Slytherin. Maybe he ought to embrace it, rather than being the perfect Gryffindor that died with the war.
“Here you are.” She said with a warm smile, handing him the flowers. “I’ve got to say, of all the arraignments I’ve done, I’m most proud of this one.” She was an artist and flowers were her medium.
Draco’s jaw dropped and he sat back to look at Harry. “I was so nice and sweet to you, but you sucked and nipped at me like an animal! You’re only upset cause you can’t sit still!”
"You're both insane." Pawk said, drawing their attention. "This isn't as serious as a revolution." Though this political game was originally her idea, they had taken it father than she ever did. She felt like she had lost control of it and it worried her because she couldn't predict what they would do. Though she still saw them as children, she's seen what they're capable of, and she, like most, were a bit scared of them.
He fixed his hair a bit and found himself frowning a bit at his reflection. He messed his hair up some, hoping to find a better hairstyle. He grimaced at the monstrosity of blonde locks atop his head. He was so used to seeing himself with clean-cut and formal hair. Messiness didn’t work very well. He tried changed his part, moving more do his hair to one side and then the other. He brushed his hair back into the sleek look he preferred when he was younger. He used to like the hairstyle because it was similar to his father’s. Now, he hated it.
Harry and Neville thought it would be fun to have a joint birthday party. It started about four hours before midnight. In those four hours, Neville was celebrated. He got cake, presents, and all their friends told stories about him.
Hermione only grew more smug later on. Draco caught her and Ron between classes and asked them for a favor. He gave them twenty galleons and asked them to buy whatever Harry likes from Honeydukes, and to get as much of it as possible.
Seamus got the magazine back and began to flip to the bachelor’s list that the paragraph on Harry mentioned. He let out a chuckle, “You’re number one on the Bachelors list, Harry. Neville, you’re here too as an honorable mention due to rumors about you and an Abbott girl.” He grinned.
Harry was quick to respond. “Of course I do! I love it.” His cheeks went pink. “I do like giving. I like seeing and hearing you. I suppose I just have a hard time asking for things like that. It’s embarrassing. It’s embarrassing to ask, to moan, squirm, everything.”
When Harry defended him, he put up a very compelling argument. He questioned whether Draco was truly acting of his own will. He compared the two of them. He made a point of describing how neither of them had a choice in anything they did. The only difference was that they were on different sides of the war. He described all the people he’s hurt and the laws he broke, while Draco had breakdowns in the bathroom. He let everyone know that his crimes were greater than Draco’s, but Draco was the only one of them to feel remorse. It was a dark and troubling set of arguments, but in the end, it was enough to make everyone see that Draco had never really been a bad guy. At least, not of his own will.
Harry cracked a smile and hugged Teddy in return. When they pulled away he looked down at Teddy with his broken smile and softly said, “You look so much like him.” He could smell Remus on the jacket and it pushed his tears to fall.
“And I’m inspired.” Harry finished it for him. “I’m inspired by your beauty. You’re so beautiful Draco, you are now and you always will be, I suspect you’ll only grow more charming with age. I only wish to see you when your smile gives you laughter lines and when your eyes are wise with age. You’ll still be so beautiful, Draco. So beautiful and warm.”
She wordlessly handed him a copy of Witches Weekly with one page clearly bookmarked, and then walked away.
Harry smiled. "Dragon's are uncontrollable, but these three'll listen to me when they want to." He stepped forward and held out his hand. “Nice seeing you again. Ron’s told me about how you’re an Auror now, doing well for yourself too, I hear. I’m happy for you.”
They both knew they only had Crow's support because after the scandal leaked, Hermione and Pawk were the only people who didn't turn their backs on her, and she was desperate to save her face. They didn't speak much about it as they both knew it wasn't the most morally-sound strategy, but they also didn't care as much as they used to about morals. All they saw was progress and any obstacles would be run over.
Next to appear was Seamus and Dean. Harry nearly huffed when he saw them. It was obvious they liked each other, but they were oblivious to each other’s feelings. Still, Harry came out of the booth and wrapped an arm around each of their necks, hugging them. They hugged Harry and were invited to sit in the booth.
After a few days of Harry being on-edge and jumping at the loud slam of the door, someone put a stop to it. Nobody knows who did it, but someone put a charm on the door so it opened and shut silently. Everyone suspected it was Draco though he never spoke about it. Nevertheless, Harry was thankful that someone did it.
They spent the next few moments trying to encourage Neville, but he was having none of it. “Guys, really, it doesn’t matter. I’ll get over her eventually.”
Harry nodded, “I think we’re exactly the same. When I was born, I was born to die. It wasn’t my choice. Those around me decided my fate, put me on a path, and pushed me towards it. The same thing happened to Draco. Being a Death Eater and being on the side of Voldemort was his future, completely undetermined by him, and forced upon him by those around him. I was raised as a pig for slaughter and Malfoy was raised to believe in blood. We are exactly the same, but we were born on different sides of the war.”
He took Harry along, “Come on, let’s get you some sweets, yea? Something to stabilize your blood sugar.”
“Why?” He wasn't sure how he felt about that. It wasn't something he expected Harry would ever do for him, but he also appreciated it in a strange way.
Draco took a deep breath and tried to calm down, telling himself that there was nothing wrong. That he would be okay. He told himself a hundred times that no matter what happened, he and Harry would be okay. He pushed his own feelings aside and basked in an aura of gratefulness that he created for himself. In his head he went over all the ways this was a good thing. He reminded himself of how good this would be for him. He told himself time and time again, but he was still sad.
Harry looked down at Draco and let out a whine from how smug he looked. It was mostly because he knew
Sometimes, life feels like a dream. If it is, then Harry and Draco don’t want to wake up, because it finally isn’t a nightmare.
Harry let out a feverish whimper and fisted the sheets. Somehow, he didn’t expect that Draco would touch anything other than his opening.
“I just ..... oral sex is like a sexual favor. I do it because I want you to feel good, because we both want it, and because we both enjoy it. I do it because it’s something I want to do
Slowly, they both fell asleep in Draco’s bed. But when they woke up, they were still just as excited and curious. Somehow, Harry managed to get through the morning still a virgin.
Draco nodded and then looked Harry up and down before a playful smirk took over his face. “Which one?”
Harry thought a moment before saying, “I think I ought to start from the beginning. You see, after being tasked with the Cupboard Project I was approached by Pawk. She wanted some help on getting her anti-discriminatory bill in motion. We grew close, got Hermione involved, and began ..... scheming.” He wasn’t sure how much he liked that word as a descriptor for what he had done. “I went from following out plans to forming my own within days. I made a friend in the media, an intern at The Daily Prophet who I knew wanted more. I let them give me an interview and then I tested them. I grilled them right back to see just what they were willing to do for a story and I was not disappointed. Now, they’ll write whatever I tell them too and every once in a while leak information so they're the first to write about it.”
He was so caught up in his shock that he didn’t notice that he had again gone a few minutes without responding.
Harry let out a laugh. “Yea. Have you seen him recently? He’s fit. But he’s still so smart and funny. Around year five I realize I’d shag him if he asked. But I was over it all a little before the war. I see him as a brother now, that’s all.”
Draco began to bounce a bit, gentle to start. He was already eager to go harder and faster, but wanted to wait. He wanted to introduce Harry to this slowly. The man under him was so wrapped up in his own pleasure that there wasn’t a moment’s silence. Draco took great pride in it.
“Thank you.” Alex wasn’t stupid. They knew that whatever the second reason was, it was more important to their meeting. “Secondly?”
McGonagall stood at the podium with a smile. “Well, I would like to start by saying hello to all the students who chose to stay or join us this year. I know it was a difficult decision to make after the war. But it’s finally over. There are no more looming threats or dark wizards waiting to attack.”
Somehow, this was worse that if some anonymous source had leaked the full truth. This left much to be speculated and he didn't like the public being able to come to their own determinations. That's what lead people to think that he or Harry might have the other under some spell or curse.
“Thankfully no. If word got out, people just might throw themselves at you. You could get attacked.”
Something changed in her that day. Maybe she really did love Lucius. But now she was certain that she felt nothing for him. He meant nothing to her. But this little home was warmer than their bed ever was. The light in Teddy’s eyes and her sister’s laugh sparked a joy inside of her that she hadn’t felt since she was a child. She knew exactly what she wanted, what she needed, was right here.
“I don’t know. Plenty of people are interested in you Harry. The streets were filled with cheers when you became legal, there was nearly a parade.”
Scorpius stood frozen, never feeling so helpless in his life. He wanted to help, but he didn’t know how. All he could do was stand and watch.
Lucky for Pansy, Draco has a hard time keeping his mouth shut and he was eager to brag about it. “Oh, I gave it to him after he s-“ He was cut off by Harry covering Draco’s mouth with his hand. His eyes were wide and panicked.
“Alex, I’d like to ask you a few questions of my own.” Harry made himself sound confident, as if he’s done this a million times. Confidence, he’s learned, is very rarely questioned. “How long have you been working at The Daily Prophet?”
After eating and doing the dishes, he was going to go to his room, but paused when he saw a mess of blonde hair peeking out over the arm of the sofa. He stepped closer and saw Draco was asleep in an incredibly awkward position. Part of him was in awe that Draco trusted him enough to fall asleep out in the open; the only place Harry would've felt safe enough to do that was the Burrow. Another part of him knew Draco would be sore if he was left to sleep like that. He wanted to wake Draco up, but he was also vaguely acquainted with the blonde’s struggle to fall asleep.
Something was different about that night. It was as if they both had the same plans for Easter holiday. They would have the next two weeks with Hogwarts empty and all to themselves. They each planned to make it a repeat of Christmas. But this time, they were both determined for it to end with a relationship.
“No. Not in the slightest. We’ve got a sprained ankle and a broken arm from the Hufflepuff Quidditch practice today, and there’s an outbreak of Mumblemumps in the year four Ravenclaws. We got six in the infirmity and all we can do it let them rest.” He huffed and threw himself on the bed. “If I get sick, kill me. Just stab me.”
Hermione, the determined and intelligent woman that she is, was all over the idea. "We could go ahead and knock down Luther's faction with a sour review of him. In their leaderless confusion we could convince someone perceived as being on their side to turn them into supporting the bill." She looked around, eyeing different members of Wizengamot, as if searching for the perfect candidate.
Harry only looked crushed. "N-No! No to both!" He couldn't believe they were seriously questioning him. He couldn't stand it when someone didn't believe him.
For the most part, it seemed that everyone actually involved in the war didn’t want to go to commemorations.
“And then we can hex each other.” Harry concluded in a dreamy tone, as if he wanted nothing more than to hex Draco.
"You aren't being the girl, you just aren't leading." The blonde corrected before whisking Harry off.
He saw Harry and Draco and got so excited that he dropped his ball. “Arry! Dwayco!” He quickly waddled towards them with open arms. He got to Draco first and hugged his legs before going to Harry and doing the same. He turned back to Draco and held up his arms, reaching for him. “Up.”
Harry’s back was arched up once again and he squirmed a bit, trying to quell the excitement bubbling in his lower belly. “Draco.” He sighed out the blonde’s name and that send a rush through the boy on top on him.
He rolled his hips, letting the feeling wash over his body for a few more seconds. There was a warm wetness on his hand and he groped for his wand to cast a cleaning charm. A shiver ran through him as the magic swept over such a sensitive area.
She sat down and let a few tears fall from her face, wrapping her arms around Draco and keeping him close.
Rather than closing his eyes, he was captured by those gray ones and saw how amused Draco looked by the sight of him.
The warm water caressed his body and made everything feel hotter. It allowed his hand to glide smoothly across his own length, his hips starting to buck.
Harry went to put the letter in his room. It was one less thing for him to worry about and he was grateful.
Harry coughed and looked away. He couldn’t believe how insanely sexy Draco was. “Green?” Harry asked when he could finally speak.
Harry was holding the book up to his face, nearly halfway through. He was blushing, had on a shy smile, and kept looking away from the book.
Harry smiled to himself and buried his face in the crook of Draco's neck. His arms wrapped around the other and he held back the urge to laugh from joy. He closed his eyes and eventually their bodies shifted to lie back on the sofa together. Though their best efforts went into not falling asleep, they both ended up losing bits of time as they drifted in an out.
Draco was now very invested in the conversation. A jealousy burned in him that made him subconsciously shift closer to Harry. If anyone was going to ruin Harry's innocence, it would be him.
Harry cracked a smile. “I suppose we are. I never really thought about it like that, but, in this last month we’ve actually become acquaintances. I really hope we do become friends.” Harry has always believed that if one must fall in love and get married, they might as well do it with their best friend. Him and Draco becoming friends meant a lot more to him than Draco realized.
Harry eventually had to put the map away, but he felt better now that he’d talked with his mysterious friends.
He stared at his father in shock. “To whom?” He felt his fear melt away, replaced by the fiery passion of rage. “This can’t be legal!”
Harry took it and stood. "Thank you, Greenwood. Expect a new project soon." Harry said as he shook the man's hand and left. He already had a few ideas in his mind.
The story was now that Seamus and Dean are together, Draco is getting friendly with former rebels, and he's probably just friends with Harry. It was quite a hilarious whirlwind of events.
Draco shuddered and dropped his wand. He wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist and his arms around his back. He held on and arched his back, letting out a series of helpless groans, each louder than the last. He twisted and clawed at the man’s back, desperately trying to grasp any ounce of control.
Draco tilted his head, “Find anything interesting anyways?” He had been hoping for something amusing when Harry returned. Originally he stayed up with the hope of Harry revealing some secret relationship to him. But now that he realized how boring Harry was when no one was trying to kill him, he was hoping Harry found something more gripping to tell Draco in one of the books.
Narcissa entered Hogwarts and was escorted by a house elf to McGonagall’s office. She entered and was greeted by McGonagall, they shook hands and Narcissa took a seat.
Draco watched those gorgeous green eyes roll back and cross slightly as the man let out a series of hapless whines. He bucked his hips into the unrelenting hand and felt that overpowering feeling finally wash over him. Gasps and cries left him as he tumbled off the edge. He let out Draco’s name as many times as his could while his body shook and tried to ride out his orgasm. The muscles in his torso and legs became frantic as he was overcome by pleasure. They shook under his flesh, struggling with the way his body was washed in his orgasm.
Harry had his knees to his chest with his arms wrapped around his legs. He was curled up in a ball on the couch and was hiding red cheeks. “Merlin.” He mumbled before shyly looking up over his knees. The blackness of his hair and pants made his green eyes pop with a radiant innocence. “Do you lot believe people really think I’m cute?”
“Why would you go and do that?” Harry decided then and there that he wasn’t going to let Draco sacrifice his health for Harry’s.
He blushed at the sound of a few weak groans and hoped that would be the bulk of it. He could distract himself from those. But next came a series of whines and whimpers that lasted quite a few minutes. His eyes widened at the desperate tone of Harry's noises, begging for his orgasm to take him. It drove Draco wild. He could hear how bad Harry wanted it.
Everywhere Harry went, he was playfully hit on by his own coworkers. Though he was known to be oblivious, he was very aware that it wasn’t serious and he was okay with it. He even thought it was a bit funny.
He shook it and Teddy’s eyes quickly fixated on the object. He handed the toy to Teddy who shook it and laughed at the sound, then he babbled while chewing on the end.
“I don’t think anyone enjoys fame. But unlike me, most people intentionally did what got them famous. I’m famous for being a hard infant to kill.”
“Spaghetti.” He answered as his eyes flickered to the bit of mid-rift exposed by Harry’s stretched form. He was already much more comfortable around Harry than he ever expected he would be with another man. He'd also lost his shame about the fact that Harry's a looker.
Harry received a letter an hour earlier from Hermione, telling him she needed to speak with him, so they set up a time for her to come over.
“Yea.” Harry shrugged. He didn’t seem surprised in the slightest. “I get a monthly financial report from the bank about it and stocks come in on a weekly basis. I just didn’t think it mattered so I never mentioned it.” He didn't fuck around when it came to money.
“My, doing stuff with your best mate’s girl. I’m disappointed in you, Harry.” Draco joked with a fake disdain for Harry’s actions.
He looked up at Draco again, a bit sheepish already. But Draco knew he hadn’t finished reading the letter. He motioned for Harry to continue.
Soon, the whimpers weren’t enough to help him cope with the feeling. He let out a whine and his fingers tightened in the sheets. The last of the discomfort faded and his breaths turned to soft pants. “Y-You can do more now.” He wasn’t sure what to say. Faster. Harder. Fuck me. Though he’d become confident in the bedroom, he’d always blush at saying something so obscene. It wasn’t something he was used to. He felt a bit awkward about voicing his desires.
Now that that was over, she did have some work-related concerns she wanted to discuss. "So, we have to present The Cupboard Project next week. Are you ready?"
Harry shuddered at the low voice that was so close to his ear. “Do it.” He didn’t ask, command, or dare. He tempted.
Though it was a bit bold given the relaxed atmosphere, Harry found himself on his feet, putting something on he record player. He turned to Draco with a bit of a nervous expression and held out his hand, “Dance with me.”
“This is the best day of my life.” He said as he rushed into the shower, pulling off his clothes as he went.
In the end, they had a gorgeous looking risotto ready. It was full of vegetables, sausages, and a few spices. Of course, the dish wasn’t typically spicy, but Harry loved it that way. Still, given that he didn’t know Draco’s tastes, he eased up on the spice and especially the cheese. He only added a little bit since he knew Draco still ate it. He mixed it all together and set the pot on the cooker while Ron pulled out the dishware to make himself a bowl.
“Firstly, I have never been interested in women. Secondly, you thought I was cute?” This definitely wasn’t how Draco expected the conversation would go. He never would have thought Harry would go and say something like that.
Harry let out a nervous laugh. “You always had shit aim in Quidditch, careful before you hurt yourself.” He played it off. His fear was gone. He wasn’t scared of Draco, but for a second, it hadn’t been Draco holding the spoon.
Harry wandered over and sat down by them, “I found a necklace in the box of stuff from the vault, I think it was my mother’s.” He held out the necklace to Ron and Hermione.
think it was you. Either that or they just want to bully you a bit. Still, they want to see you cleared.” He explained before they stepped into a Floo and Harry was taken to the Auror’s office.
They shifted so Harry could finally close his legs, but as he did, the were momentarily overcome by trembles. He gave a small frown before they slowly stopped. “I don’t know what that was.”
Draco smirked at the sound of his name coming from Harry. He sounded so overwhelmed already. He led the tip into his mouth and listened to the long and low groan that fell from Harry’s lips. He hollowed his cheeks and sucked as his tongue licked and swirled around the head.
Until he actually found one that interested him. It was an older book that seemed to be about the history of magic.
“So relax for the rest of your time here. I mean it, relax. Just let go.” Draco glanced at the time. “Come on, we’ll be late for transfigurations if we don’t get going. I’ll help you relax after dinner.”
While Harry went on about his excitement, Greenwood couldn't tell if he was about to throw up or jump for joy. Either way, something overpowering was bubbling up inside of him. He felt as if he had finally been freed from his cycle but he could also tell that this was all leading up to Harry calling in one last favored. His only fear was that this would be the biggest favor yet.
Two months ago, the trial of Draco Malfoy was labeled the shortest one of them all. It hardly lasted a day and it was all thanks to the testimony given by Harry Potter.
He huffed and handed the magazine to Draco, who laughed when he read what it was about. “Merlin, I can’t believe someone may have soiled the Golden Boy.” He teased with a grin. “How dare they. It’s practically a crime.”
"Woo you.” He rolled his eyes a bit at Harry’s genuine shock. “We both like each other and I completely respect that you aren’t ready for a full relationship. But with our feelings in the open I don't see why I can't flirt with you."
They went out and Harry sat with Draco at the Slytherin table again. There weren’t many people anyways, less than twenty remained and they were all spread out by house and year. Harry figured there was no point in him sitting alone on Christmas.
A soft nip made him cringe and pull back slightly. He found himself confused for a moment. Was it suppose to feel good to be bitten or was it normal for it to hurt? If so, was he meant to like the fact that it hurt? He was at a loss and he saw a nervousness invade Draco's once-confident smile. "I'm sorry, I-I don't know why I did that." The slight sting had already faded and now he felt as if he had ruined their moment.
By the end of it, Draco looked shocked. “His voice is so amazing! How have I never heard of him before?”
Draco thought a moment, “Hogwarts shaped me. If I had gone anywhere else, I’d still be the absolute shit that I was when I was eleven. St. Mungo’s is just a hospital. Hogwarts changes lives. I want to be part of it.”
Silence filled the room as Harry began drifting back to sleep, and eventually, his warmth and calm breathing lulled Draco into doing the same.
The meeting continued and Harry and Hermione were grilled. They were shown no mercy, but they were prepared. All questions were answered to the best of their ability, though some had no answer yet. Some could only be answered theoretically. They dispelled many rumors and did their best to ease any doubts. The only thing that truly worried Harry was when someone asked about the lawyer representing the department, and he had to answer, "Daniel Greenwood." The man who got Lucius Malfoy off in exchange for the arrest of the remaining Death Eaters. There was a mixed reaction as some approved of what he did but other, more stern believers, hated him for negotiating with a perceived evil.
Harry quickly assessed himself and made his body relax. “Uh, no. Not really. I just, well, I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable because holidays are really ..... domestic.”
If someone were to ask him about the last three months of his life, Harry Potter would have absolutely nothing to say.
Now that it was out there in the open, no one had anything to say on it. It was news to almost everyone. Hermione had her suspicions, but Ron had been certain for a long time.
The Head Warlock called them to order, threatened to kick them out, and personally apologized to Harry.
Draco nearly laughed when he heard the small voice under him. It was rare to see the golden boy so meek. “Of course.”
Harry nodded. “After work, Narcissa Malfoy found me and told me that Draco was missing. Since the attack on Astoria Greengrass, she’s had him practically locked up in our house for the past week. He wasn’t meant to leave until the man was caught since a lot of articles have been throwing around the word Blood Traitor, in reference to him. Narcissa and I end up finding a letter from Blaise Zabini saying that Draco can come visit him but they can’t leave his house since he doesn’t want Draco out and about while the attacker is still at large. Apparently, Draco had wrote to him asking if he could come over because he didn’t like being stuck in the house. We ended up finding him in the streets of wizarding Paris, practically dragging Blaise about. Blaise obviously didn’t want to be there and I don’t blame him for what happened in the slightest. So, Narcissa and I find him, and she’s furious. But I understand that her anger was out of worry and love. Still, she’s mad. She tells him off for scaring her and he apologizes. We were about to bring him home, but then-”
Draco and Harry leaned over to look the article over and it argued that Draco was doubtlessly a hero. It argued in favor of Draco and Harry’s friendship and potential relationship, in favor of he and Seamus’ friendship, and it took Draco’s quote to a French journalist if he and his father being estranged. Harry also noted the article about Pansy, Crow, and Greenwood's hospital reforms, as promised. But in the article on Draco, the last line even said, "The final verdict on Draco Malfoy; doubtlessly a blood traitor."
Harry could already feel that he was being pushed towards the edge. He laid back and moaned, letting Draco take him there at his own pace. “Oh, Draco. Yes!” His back gently arched up and he bit his lip as he got a bit embarrassed at how vocal he is.
They ended up having a full and fun conversation, the only real conversation they’ve had since they were married. They took the Floo home and Draco was greeted by the sight of a small mountain of brownies waiting in the kitchen.
Harry was determined to befriend Draco and to make him part of his friend group. Ever since they had their breakdown together, they felt a lot closer and spoke more often. At the very least, they would have a minimum of two conversations a day, which was double what they started with in the beginning of the year.
Of course, they had all seen the stories of their dance and they’d heard all the rumors about one having the other under a spell or Harry using Draco as a political ploy. But they were too wise to believe such nonsense.
He sat down at his table and Hermione turned to him. “Alright, I did some research and the bank will mint gold and silver, but they won’t melt it. We’ll have to figure out how to do that on our own. But besides that, the plan is good. I also checked the gold to silver ratio, it’s very high right now and shows no signs of dropping. If you wanted to try to beat the system like that, then I would recommend we start as soon as possible.”
“I’m happy. I really am. It feels like I still have them all in my life and I always suspected it was them anyways. They knew far too much about my parents and their friends for it not to be them. But suspecting it’s them and finding out I was right are two very different things.”
Draco didn't even have to ask why they wouldn't like him; they considered him a blood traitor. During his trail, it was revealed that Draco was very unwilling to do many of the things Voldemort wanted him to. It was also revealed that he intentionally screwed up when he didn't want to go through with the plans. Death Eaters labeled him a saboteur and a blood traitor, which he was fine with. He considered that the reason why his mark faded while no one else's did.
This sparked a conversation into how Harry remembered Snape. The obsessive fixation with Lily, how he tormented Harry, how he made himself Neville's worst fear, and more. The conversation eventually shifted to how Draco had known the man, then onto Draco's childhood, and then to Harry's. Rather than some heartfelt conversation, Harry matter-of-factly explained the hell that was his childhood. He refrained from giving any emotional response and spoke as if he were relaying a boring list. That list just so happened to be a list of all the torments he was put through as a child. He summed up his trauma in under two minutes, not caring to give too many details. He spoke about it as if he hadn’t even happened to him, but to someone else. It was sad and detached.
The blonde began pulling out the pieces and set it out on the table, where Harry joined him after gathering his own supplies. “Right. Assemblage. Shouldn’t be too hard.” He managed to get the walls set up on the gingerbread floor. When he glanced over, he saw that Harry was already sticking on the chimney. “How are you so far ahead?”
Perhaps it was petty of him, but he tried to push his hips a bit harder than before, as if to get back at Draco. Though he was surprised to hear his lover get a bit louder. His eyes widened and lips parted. It was beautiful. Draco getting louder gave him a high, and suddenly, he needed more. He tried to go a bit harder and he blonde got a tad louder. He knew it wasn’t sustainable. But he didn’t care. Draco enjoyed it and that’s all that mattered.
“Now I see what you mean when you say you can’t keep quiet. That was so adorable.” He said in reference to Harry’s whine during the massage.
“I am.” Harry confessed, looking up at Draco. “Being in your arms hurts because I know I’m not yours. Not really.”
September came and Ron entered a training program to become an Auror, Hermione took up an internship at the Ministry, Ginny went back to Hogwarts, and everyone else returned to their lives before the war. Everyone except Harry. Harry realized he was the only one whose life centered almost completely around the war. He was born to die in it, and without that, he wasn't sure what he was meant to do with himself. So he stuck around a while longer. Although he was halfway moved in to his own house, he stayed for Molly. Sometimes, she just couldn’t cook or clean, and without saying a word, Harry would silently get it done for her. He was used to doing so much more, and he felt like he owed her for all the kindness the Weasleys had shown him. Though it sometimes took them by surprise, no one said a word when Harry was the one serving dinner, or when they walked in to see him cleaning. Just silent nods and an unspoken gratitude. Harry preferred it that way.
Harry nodded and let him. He smiled just as much as Draco did. The enveloping warmth of lips bigger than his own made him melt. The joy that sparked within himself made him want to giggle. He reached up and cupped Draco's cheek, just a bit unsure about the move, but the blonde didn't seen to react negatively to it.
The silence prompted Harry to glanced over at Draco from where they sat at the table, looking over omelettes that were starting to get cool. "Are you alright? Draco?" The other was staring at him with parted lips and wide eyes. He didn't think what he said was so profound.
With permission, he also revealed Seamus had been editing his books. Besides work, the two had become good friends. So much so that Draco found himself standing as Seamus’ best man, when he and Dean finally tied that knot.
Dean was bent over, rummaging through a shelf, and Seamus was trying to keep the potion at the proper temperature.
“A bit of fun? Alright then. Tomorrow, when I drag you into a broom closet between classes, I don’t want to hear any protests from you. I’ll just be having a bit of fun.” He mocked.
"Mother!" Draco teased with a laugh at her crude language. He then looked over at Harry and raised an eyebrow. "You haven't shaved your face in at least a week so don't even think about kissing me until you do." He sounded so venomous and stern. Harry loved it.
Seamus passed Harry the magazine to reveal what he had been reading. “Top ten richest Wizard families in the UK and Ireland.” Harry read aloud.
“Not really. I’m in the waiting game right now. When Wizengamot convienes next I’ll have to take any opportunities I can seize.” He wasn’t ready to confess to Draco that he was the one behind the media warfare. “Last week I promised my support on an amendment to strengthen the bill on Lycanthrope in exchange for two votes towards Pawk’s.”
“Well thank Merlin I’m charming and good-looking.” Harry threw out without even thinking. He wasn’t sure why he was so sarcastic, but he was.
Harry was also surprised by the sight of Draco. The first thing he noticed were the deep blue eyes that stared back at him, and the stark blonde hair that was a bit longer than before. He wore long and dark Auror robes fit him very well, no doubt he had them tailored to his body. He was as lean and lithe as when they were in school, but he seemed slightly muscular. Even so, he still looked as soft and posh as ever, likely due to all the expensive lotions he used. It was nice to see that some things never change.
Hands move to hold Harry’s hips and he enjoyed it more than he expected he would. Though it wasn't too low, it was still lower than anyone's hands had been before. A soft squirm ran through the body against his and he let out a soft chuckle in response. After teasing up and down his target, he dragged the pointed tip of his tongue across Draco's neck, around the shell of his ear, and ended with a very gentle bite.
His name was John and he was from somewhere in Northern Ireland. He was fresh out of Hogwarts and eager to become a dragonologist. Everything had started out friendly enough, until John got confident.
He was loud and shaking, but the pleasure only grew and showed him no mercy. It was too much for his inexperienced body to handle.
She took a very direct approach as she wasn’t one to beat around the bush. She brewed Amortentia and carried it with her to study potions with Dean and Seamus.
“I died too once, but then I came back.” Harry found a way to relate to the three and he went for it. Still, he wasn’t entirely comfortable with the conversation at hand. He wasn’t even sure why he was being so revealing to complete strangers.
"They look identical, but I can tell them apart. They're also comforted by my scent. Dragons have these pheromone glands on their necks, they sniff each other's as a greeting. One of the first things they did after hatching was try to smell my neck. Now, if there's a problem, they won't calm down until they've got my scent."
Draco was somewhat amused by how Harry took the information, but made no comment, returning to his book.
Harry playfully rolled his eyes and then sat on the edge of the red bed, laying his torso down. “Fine.”
Harry hardly lasted three minutes in the chair before he drew the curtains around Draco's area and moved to crawl into the little hospital bed. Draco's body was mostly occupying the half closest to Narcissa, which gave Harry just less than half of the bed to crawl in to. He decided to create more space by scooting up so that his chest was level to the other's head. He pulled Draco close and talked all evening. He spoke in a hushed voice until his throat felt dry, and even then, he wouldn't shut up. At first he talked about the things that had happened in Wizengamot, then about the attack, about how pretty Draco is, how good of a person he is, their future together, about all the things they could do, the muggle inventions he could introduce to Draco, the concept of movies, how they might really be married one day, and about how he's lucky to have Draco.
They had no idea their friends were all gathered in the common room, talking about them, just as they had done a month ago when the subject was Dean and Seamus.
"I want to make a bill. I know my kind has all those laws against discrimination, but it's only us. Now that I'm finally on the inside, I see how the elite runs the show. They won't hire people over blood status, some openly hire men over women, I've even seen preferences in sexuality." She flicked her cigarette with her thumb and let the ashes fall as her voice lowered to a whisper, "I think that Yaxley fellow is a bit racist, too." She shook her head in disappointment and let her voice return to normal. "It isn't fair. There are issues that have been around for centuries, but they've become so normalized that nobody wants to address them! Even when they already have a job, they shouldn't be treated differently for who they are. I want to make a bill but I have no idea how to start."
Three chapters later and the lawyer was spending his first night in the photographer’s flat. Things were getting a bit steamy, but he wasn’t sure that he was ready. Not only were his characters still new to their relationship, but he didn’t think he was very comfortable with writing the scene. So he had things calm down a bit and moved on to a scene about cuddling. He took a bit of inspiration from his session with Harry, but instead of being interrupted, they kissed.
“Where do you buy baby stuff from? I can always just visit any old town in Scotland, but is there a wizard shop for baby stuff? Where does food come from? Are there wizard farmers? I don’t know how anything works.”
Harry reached into the collar of his shirt and pulled out the matching necklace that was tucked in. “Yea. But it’s charmed.” He said, wrapping his hand around the lily on his necklace and squeezing.
Draco smirked and began to undress himself. “Have you any way I want? Tempting offer, but I don’t think I should. Not now, at least.”
Draco rolled his eyes at the sight, “You’re taking your job too seriously and you don’t even have it yet.”
Harry noticed the blotchy pink blush that was naturally present on Draco’s cheeks, how he was significantly taller than Harry, the natural puffiness of his lips, and the hints of silver in his blue eyes.
Silence was all they got from Draco. His eyes were shifty, he fiddled with his fingers, he was nervous and unsure of how to go about it. Instead, he quietly said, “It isn’t my place to discuss what happened to him.”
"No, it isn't just that." He tore his eyes from the blank wall he stared at and made himself look at Luna. "I'm tired. I'm so tired." He almost seemed embarrassed by it. "I was bold and brave. I wasn't afraid of anything and I did everything to survive. I didn't let anyone mess with me. I had a fire. I was angry." He looked away, trying to find his words. "I never much liked the anger. Reminded me too much of them, I was scared of turning into them. Part of me thinks I might've been, for a while. But that's over now, all of it, gone. I'm not him anymore, am I?"
This gave Harry the very unfortunate reminder of his second action with Alex in the press. The creation of a faction lead by Luther, the crabbiest member of Wizengamot. Though he had the leadership skills of a sheep, somehow, his faction hadn't fallen apart yet.
The charm immediately tumbled out of Draco’s mouth. Just panicked enough that Harry couldn’t make out the words. Still, his hand was now lubed. That hand wrapped around Draco’s cock once more while his other went to his lover’s chest. “Oh? Are you so against me touching you here?”
He raised up on his knees and his hips jerked forward, stuttering as his release shot up into his chest. The rest of his body was leaned back and useless, arched back and open mouth, completely hapless from the overwhelming feelings that rushed through him.
Draco chuckled and picked up Harry's sled. "Because I'm perfect. Now let's get you inside before you injure yourself." He carried the sleds while Harry trailed behind, occasionally shaking a bit of snow out of his clothes.
Teddy opened up the present to find a brown jacket that was much too big for him. He laughed at it, thinking it was hilarious how big it was. Nevertheless, he tried to put it on and thanked Harry.
It was then that Hermione remembered Harry was half-Slytherin. "This is important to you, isn't it?" She had no intention of stopping him. She knew that she couldn't even if she wanted to.
Harry nodded and went inside. He sat down on the sofa and the three dragons joined him. One on each side and a third on his lap. They seemed rather peaceful.
“Harry Potter! How dare you miss lunch and make me worry about you! Keeping yourself in here and working instead of eating.” Draco scoffed as he barged into the room. He was obviously displeased by how Harry had missed lunch.
By “standard marital contract” it was understood that Demgass was referring to the typical marital contract between pureblood families. Because of this, Lucius was able to quickly skim it, already knowing it’s contents, while Molly and Arthur took a few moments longer to review it. Based on the way Molly very slightly smiled, Harry could tell she'd probably worked out a way that the contract would allow for divorce.
Draco couldn’t stop the grin that appeared on his face as he laid down beside Harry and wrapped his arms around him. “Gladly.”
It’s 4am. I accidentally woke up my partner because I had this entire chapter written but forgot to post it at midnight.
Part of his healing was reaching out to his classmates about the things he didn’t understand or didn’t know much about.
In the lobby, Crow managed to mumble to him that she could get two votes in, as she passed by, so it wouldn't look like they were communicating. She couldn't be seen as connected to Harry if she was to continue to influence the older members. Pansy didn't have that limitation and walked right up to him to tell him that she could definitely get in three votes from the younger four. Since he knew they were at least trying, he wrote a letter to Alex when he got home. He told him that Effie Crow and Pansy Parkinson were going to be revamping the failed St. Mungo's reform and that Daniel Greenwood was sponsoring it. He knew they would find it suspicious that the press knew about it before they announced it, but he didn't care too much about that. They deserved a reward for sticking to their word. It also prevented Crow, who Harry didn't trust as much, from backing out of the reform and leaving Pansy high and dry. He received a quick reply that the story would be out tomorrow, but likely a side article to the main one about Luther's trial.
He leaned back and tried to avoid Teddy’s hands, but eventually he ended up falling onto his back and Teddy finally snatched his glasses.
Draco let out a nervous laugh, almost trying to stall before he had to respond. “Well obviously! As Ron put it, I’m not blind, and as Luna said, you’re objectively attractive.” He scoffed, “Harry you daft bastard. I wrote a bloody love poem about your eyes and you’re surprised that I’m not unwilling to sleep with you? Seriously?! That
It ended with a screaming match between Luther's followers and absolutely no one. They fed off of each other and got louder and louder, for seemingly no reason.
Every time Harry and Draco visited, Teddy would crawl over to them saying, “Arrry Dayco! Arry Dayco!”
McGonagall, however, wasn't in the mood. But she did keep her tone light enough for Harry not to worry about getting in trouble. “Unlike Draco, I’ll not stand for you waxing poetic about me.”
Draco was an absolute mess. He called out in pleasure and he gripped the sheets, tugging at them. His legs and hips shifted around, unable to handle the pleasure. The muscles in his lower stomach and inner thighs were trembling. His eyebrows were furrowed, his jaw dropped, but he still couldn’t look away from those sinister green eyes.
After the first few months their conversations shifted, instead of discussing their losses and sadness, they started to discuss the future. The future was all they had left.
cum deep inside of him. There was also a small rush of power from the fact that he did it even though Harry didn’t want to cum this early. The idea of forcing pleasure and succeeding made him want to cum on the spot. He reduced his lovers strong form to be trembling and helpless. Draco held his lover and slowed his movements to a stop.
Part of Harry felt as if this was the bad and terrible thing that his anxiety had been waiting for. Something would happen, Draco would be found, and he’d get struck by a spell that he may never wake up from. He shook the thought and refocused on the situation before him. He offered Narcissa a glass of wine or food, but she declined both.
Harry, as much as he personally didn't want Draco to leave, had other reasons. "I'm not sure that would be a good idea. If Draco is high on the list and isn't seen in public then Malfoy Manor would be the most logical place to try to find him. Nobody knows he's living here. This might be safest place for him."
Even Draco was in shock. His family’s net worth was listed at almost forty million Galleons. Neville’s family was tenth with just over eight million.
Draco sniffled, his anger melting away and the sadness becoming more apparent. “I uhm. Fuck.” Was all he got out for a moment. “I was speaking with my parents via letters, we’ve been sending them nonstop for the last two weeks. I can’t return to the Manor, as you know. I was hoping we could spend Christmas at another relative’s house, but plenty of them are being prosecuted for being Death Eaters. My father also hasn’t been too happy over the fact that I actively rebelled against Voldemort, even though that’s the very thing that kept me out of Azkaban! Essentially, they refuse to meet with me for Christmas. They refuse to spend Christmas with me!” Draco took a deep breath, “I know this isn’t that big a deal, it just really upsets me.”
He bent his knees and got his feet under him, landing on his toes, but he was then flung forward from the impact and he caught himself on his left forearm. He let out a cry of pain and he curled up on the ground. “I think I should go to the hospital wing but I don’t want to move.” He said, biting back the pain though it was evident in his voice.
“You are a beautiful golden light. You’re my own sunbeam, a warm glow, you are everything bright and lovely. And now, as I struggle to see through the fog and fight to stay afloat in the stormy seas of my own mind, your touch is the lighthouse calling me home. And I will follow you anywhere.”
Two house elves were already carrying the nightstand, the third was carefully carrying the vanity, and Ron and Molly were moving the dresser. Narcissa tried to lift Draco's trunk, but her hands were shaking, and it was quite heavy.
Hermione, Ron, and Pansy were already there and playing with Teddy when they arrived. Teddy wasn’t shy in the slightest and he loved meeting new people. Neville arrives a few minutes later, followed by Narcissa, Blaise, then Dean and Seamus.
Hesitation was a funny thing. In the army, any soldier would tell you that if faced with a child and adult hostile, you always shoot the child first. This is because a child won’t hesitate to kill you, but an adult will think it over first. When a child becomes a soldier, they lose their empathy, their humanity. But an adult stays rational and thinks things over. That’s one of the reasons why Harry never taught the DA anything deadly, because he knew that if he did, the battle would have been nothing more than a massacre, and Harry wasn’t going to let his friends become murderers.
Harry had become quite skilled at avoiding the mistletoe and found himself proud that he was “immune to pranks”. But James didn’t like that at all.
McGonagall was staring at the list of new students with a sad smile. She went through the names until she reached one that she hadn’t said in years. “James Potter.”
Part of him knew that no matter what happened over these next few days, nothing would ever be the same. Even if everything was called off, he’s come to realized that this isn’t something he could so easily forgive, and his father isn’t the same man he once was.
“Quite the opposite. You’re here because Madam Pomfrey has announced she’ll be retiring in five years and she’s named you as her successor. You’ll spend the next five years apprenticing under her, then you’ll run the hospital wing here at Hogwarts.”
"So, I hope you lot see why I couldn't be responsible for the crime. Why would I send out a hit on my own husband? Much less Astoria Greengrass, whom I never really knew anyways. Even more so, why would I be upset that the children of the people who wanted me dead, turned out to be nothing like their parents? I think it's great! Now, I haven't slept since yesterday at six in the morning, when my
“I understand.” She said as she led Harry into the sitting room. There were a few baby toys and a stuffed rabbit on the floor.
Harry was stuck behind people who didn’t walk as quickly as he would have liked, and his own exasperation nearly made him tear up. He just wanted to go home.
With his mother, he felt like he had that again. They were off eating at nice restaurants all day and shopping around. It was wonderful and relaxing. Draco indulged himself in charmeuse, suede, silk, chiffon, lace, and satin. He had an obvious preference for sheer and light fabrics, but he’ll always have a weak spot for suede. He looked like an elf prince from a fantasy movie, but he didn’t know that.
Harry was silent a moment, staring at the ground. “Uh. I-I would rather not have sex right now. If that’s okay.”
Draco was sitting at his desk at the time, but looked up when something pink entered his peripheral vision. He looked up and a smile graced his face when he saw the flower. “Harry, where did you get this?” Of course he recognized the flower and knew it couldn’t be found in England.
Draco’s beautiful hair, eyes, body, voice, his natural elegance and charm. He moaned a bit louder and his grip on his pillow tightened. He began panting as he thought of Draco. He wished it was Draco’s hand he was rutting against instead of his own. He wished he was with Draco in his bed. He wanted to say Draco’s name instead of the mindless whimpers and groans, but he couldn’t take that risk.
While they were studying, Seamus mentioned the potion smelled exactly like Dean’s cologne, but Dean laughed and said it smelled more like Seamus’ shampoo.
Before Harry could apologize for their behavior, Draco opened his mouth, “You can control them?!" He sounded horrified and looked like he may faint.
Soon, Harry was rolling his his hips back in time to Draco’s fingers. His hands were balled under his chest and kept him lifted a bit, his back remained arched and he found himself raising his hips higher as if his body wanted to bend over for Draco. He whined as he nearly found himself on his hands and knees, he was roughly halfway there but refused to get any closer to such a mortifying position. His hips moved quickly as he wanted more and more.
He spent his afternoon melting Galleons, selling the raw materials, buying and melting silver, minting it, and trading it for Galleons. He ended up staying out past sundown getting Draco’s present, still covered in soot.
Harry felt different. Instead of a light airy feeling, he felt heavy and almost anxious. “This is different, what is this?” He already didn’t like that someone was using an unrecognizable spell on him. Even though it was Draco and he trusted him. But the bad feeling that the spell gave him reminded him of his experiment with dark magic and his worries doubled.
Draco let out a laugh. “I don’t even like Quidditch. I hated it. I only did it because my father made me. I don’t care.”
One morning, while Draco was getting ready in the bathroom, Harry decided to make the bed for him. When Draco came out, he was surprised and acknowledged what Harry did. He thanked him with a kiss and then they left. Harry even noticed that Draco blushed when he realized what Harry had done for him.
“It isn’t bad. I don’t know. I think it’s because so many people at Hogwarts have their names done that way. There’s just such a high concentration in one place, so it seems strange.”
It was natural for him to call Teddy his godson, a few years and he simply called him his son. At first, he referred to Scorpius as his kid. He knew Draco intending for Harry to also father Scorpius, they’d had a million conversations about it, but the idea of parenthood still unnerved him. By the time Scorpius was only a few months old, he was telling all his friends about his two sons. Around the same time, Teddy began asking if he could spend the weekends with Harry and Draco, who immediately gave him a room in their house. They decorated it for him, he moved some of his clothes and toys in, and he had his second home with his fathers and brother.
Seamus couldn't help but to grin, "Oh, there was a lot he didn't expect. But the one thing I wish he had known was that since he had never done it before, and since I hadn't in a while, sometimes the person on the receiving end can take a bit longer to finish. But now, we know what to do and I usually cum first."
“Of course, my love.” Harry couldn't help but to milk it just a little bit. Of course he would never outright sass McGonagall, that didn't mean he couldn't have just a bit of fun with her.
Harry raised an eyebrow and reached up to set it on the tree, only to come to the harrowing realization that he couldn't reach it. "I can't." He said as if he were genuinely surprised.
Draco looked up with a bewildered expression. “What?!” Being a rich pureblood was important to only a small portion of wizard society. Some were famous for their riches, but most of them didn't have to deal with things like paparazzi and being in articles. But now that Draco had been considered a war hero, he was dealing with it more and more often.
Greenwood nodded and barely concealed his dry gulp of anxiousness. "If that was all you had to say to me, you would have written a letter. What else is there?"
Draco, meanwhile, was still at Malfoy Manor. Both Narcissa and Pansy told him he needs to apologize. Still. He felt like that wasn’t enough. If he did apologize, he already knew Harry would forgive him. He wanted to do something more than that.
When he entered, he saw the room was much bigger than he expected. It had a huge bed, a table, chairs, a sofa, a fireplace, and a desk. It was very luxurious. "Wow." He said softly as he looked around, feeling strangely small. From the moment he saw the manor, he felt like he was going to be sick, but somehow, this room was different. It didn't feel like the rest of the manor. He had no bad memories with this room.
Harry sat down by Draco and was met with a raised eyebrow. “What have you been doing? You’re late and you look like you’ve been crying.”
Harry woke up two hours later. Sleep had inched them closer together. He smiled and was about to get up, but something about Draco’s face made him not want to move. So instead, he laid there. Staring. He soaked up all the details. How his nose bent, how his lips were shaped, the pinkness of them, how smooth his skin looked, the shape of his face, how his hair rested on the pillow, it was almost overwhelming. But he couldn’t look away.
“First of all, don’t test me. It’s easy to tell you don’t know much about the wizarding world. There are many books and spells that you know nothing about. Ones you wouldn’t find in Hogwarts.”
They saw the conflict and defeat on Harry's face and grew a playful smirk. "I like you, Potter. You're good. You're really a good and pure person. I'm so happy that you're taking over Wizengamot instead of those old arseholes that I'm always stuck having to talk to. I like you so much better. But that face, I've seen it before. Those arseholes wear it often." They were silent a moment, weighing something heavy in their mind, before finally confessing. "If you were one of them, I would sleep with you for a story. I've done it before and really have no qualms about it. I'd get an orgasm and a story, it really is a double-win for me. But I like you, you're honest, so I'm being as transparent as possible. Go home to Malfoy."
Harry was overjoyed by this. He was the first to rush down and congratulate Pawk. The Cupboard Project was guaranteed to make it through and all they needed to do was ensure at least the same number of votes in Pawk's second vote to have her bill passed. He, Hermione, and Pawk spent the next while talking to everyone about the bill, giving more detailed information about it and ensuring votes for the next time around. He was on a roll, keeping his summaries of the bill short and persuasive, answering questions, throwing out details that hadn't been included in the first presentation, shaking hands, exchanging pleasantries, and offering support in exchange for a vote. It was as if everyone was dancing around him to the music that he created. He felt so in-control of everything going on around him. He was on a high. Everything that he had worked so hard to set up, had finally fallen into place.
“I know you’re used to always hearing yes,” Harry will never not tease Draco about his upbringing, “but it’s a no from me.”
Andromeda took a few pictures of the occasion. She got one of Harry and Teddy playing peekaboo, of Draco and Teddy building a tower on Harry’s abdomen, and she got Harry to take a photo of her and Narcissa. It took him a solid three minutes to figure out how to work wizard cameras, but he got a pretty good picture for his first try.
He sat at the desk in his room and wrote a simple letter. He introduced himself, told her about the properties he was interested in, and asked about seeing them in person.
He laid face-down on the bed, staring at the bedside table as he listened to Draco walk behind him and crawl onto the bed.
“I suppose I’m just not as stressed as I usually am, I need to work on that and find more things to do.”
"So, I saw the article about you and Malfoy shopping together. I promise I won't say anything, my journalism is focused on politics, but, what's up with that? If you don't mind talking about it." Alex prompted while fiddling with their quill and parchment, still nervous around Harry.
They spent the afternoon in each other's arms as Harry had been given a few days off due to the trauma of almost losing his husband. Still, that didn't mean he wasn't without pressure. In a week the Cupboard Project was to go into it's final vote that would determine whether or not the department would be created. Until then, Wizengamot had a few days of acting as a judicial body for some lawsuits and petty crimes that had been committed.
Draco raised an eyebrow before he leaning down and licking at Harry's nipple. "You really should be nicer to me." He gave it a gentle suck and swirled his tongue around it.
“Harry, I really want to repay the favor.” Draco insisted. He really just wanted to suck some dick. It’s been over a year since he’s had any.
It was then that Draco remembered Harry's likely heterosexuality. Before he could ask about it, the bedroom door swung open.
"It heats up." Harry explained and the lady let out a soft chuckle, "My granddaughter and her husband have a pair. He once had to travel to India and they stayed connected with these. It just let's the other know you're thinking about them." She took off the necklace and set it back on the display before turning back to finish arranging the earrings.
Harry sat down and stared at the floor for a moment. He quickly gathered his thoughts. “I uh, I heard our Defense Against the Dark Arts professor is temporary.” He wasn’t sure how to start it, so he went with the easiest conversation starter that was still on topic with what he wanted to discuss. He didn’t want to have to traverse an entire conversation just to get to what he really came for.
Dean and Seamus had also wed by then, and were living together in the countryside with three dogs and a pesky stray cat that they had unofficially adopted. They spent their days turning muggle sports into magical ones to broaden the work of the Department of Magical Sports and Games.
“Oh, before I answer that, Molly wanted me to give you this.“ Harry handed him the neatly wrapped gift. He was a bit nervous that maybe Draco wouldn’t like it, or perhaps, that he would think it was too much. He knew that Draco had some nasty ideas about the Weasleys in the past but he was really hoping that the blonde had moved past it all.
Harry grinned at him before turning back to the omelettes he was making, "Are you? I think that's wonderful. What made you decide to finally do it?"
“And now he’s your roommate.” She pointed out. “I don’t mean to pry, but Harry is of decent blood, and I never much cared for Voldemort anyways. I always preferred the idea of peace with a silent understanding of everyone’s place. In the end, Harry risked his life by telling me you were safe. That’s something I can never forget.”
Draco was already shaking. He was past using his own gasping breath to conceal moans. He was trembling and moaning out for Harry. He couldn’t be quiet even if he wanted to.
"You said it was a tradition to have a cup on Christmas morning, so I figured it must be important to you." He hesitated a moment before asking, "Or did I misinterpret that entirely?"
He spent his meal laughing and smiling with Pansy, but on the inside he was analyzing their interactions for the past week to try to identify where he messed up. He wanted to identify his mistake, so he could rectify it as soon and possible. The only problem was that he wasn’t sure what he had done wrong. He thought everything between them was going great. They had never been closer.
When they were back in their dorm, Draco went to take a shower. While he was in there, Harry quickly pulled out the map.
He researched the ways different Muggle governments went about it and saw a lot of overlap. The overlap was copied and pasted directly into the document while other topics had to be debated and ironed out by Harry and Hermione.
Harry's hips trembled as soft grunts and moans slipped out of his mouth. His response was entirely involuntary, but he was incapable of controlling himself in the wake of such pleasure.
Harry looked unamused at first, but then chose to go along with it. “Well I had better get paid well or something for my services.”
“Don’t worry about it. I can do without some of those things. I never really cared for poinsettias or garland and my father was the only one adamant about Christmas crackers.”
It was then that Harry understood. Alex was attracted to not only power, but intelligence. It sent a brief shiver through him though he only wanted to go home to Draco. So he did.
The blonde felt a sense of disbelief. The war really did make their past seem so small. He listened to some sultry holiday love song drift through the room as Harry sent the letter off, shooting the blonde a small smile. He somehow looked as shy and innocent as the eleven year old Draco had met in Diagon Alley, many years ago. There was a softness in his expression that gripped Draco's heart at the memory of when everything was so much better. But those green eyes hurt him the most, they had an aura that made it very clear they had seen far too much. He also had a bit of a stubble that made Draco squint his eyes.
Draco took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure what he was feeling. In fact, he wasn’t sure that he felt anything at all. He spent the rest of the day on that sofa, unwilling to move. When he did leave to go to his room he found sleep to be impossible. As much as he wanted to believe that his father would come to his senses and call the whole thing off, he doubted it.
“I also got you a present, but it’s significantly less meaningful or creative.” Harry confessed, handing her a small purse filled with ten thousand Galleons.
It was more than fireworks or butterflies, simple words like that couldn’t describe the weightless and fluttering joy they felt inside themselves. It invaded their systems and infected even the darkest parts of them, filling the both of them with a pure happiness.
Seamus pondered the questions a moment before throwing out a suggestion. "Well, it'd only be fair that they each have one girl and one boy best friend. Perhaps one could work in the Ministry and then the other could do something else?"
“Nice, isn’t it? It’s made of vicuna; warmest, softest, most expensive fabric in the world.” He said it in a bit of a bragging tone, as if he was immensely proud of what he had bought for Harry.
He wished it was Draco’s hand he was rutting against, he wished it was Draco that would give him - no,
He headed over towards The Three Broomsticks, which the Searcys often frequented. On his way there, he received quite a few looks. Some angry, others suspicious, and some even pitying. He figured it had something to do with his dance with Draco and ignored him. Journalists snapped photos and tried to ask questions about it, but he only ignored them. Others threw out questions that seemed vaguely like threats, asking if he or Draco are prepared in case an extremist goes after them. He ignored it all and left them at the door of The Three Broomsticks, his eyes searching for the Searcys.
He looked up at Pansy, his eyes were pleading but he didn't even know what he was asking for. She only gave him a sympathetic look and nodded as if to encourage him to continue. So he did.
Harry couldn’t stop himself from laughing. It wasn’t just that she was incorrect, but it was also from how awkward he felt. “No. He doesn’t. Why would he? We’ve only been dating for two weeks.”
Meanwhile, Draco was about to learn about Harry’s obsession with his thighs. In the moment, Harry forgot Pansy was going to retell all of it to Draco, but now that he remembered, he was incredibly embarrassed. Especially when he saw Pansy and Draco whispering throughout class and Draco occasionally glancing at him with a blush.
The blonde blinked as his cheeks went red. "Oh." Was the only response he could formulate, making the man behind him chuckle.
Harry’s arm felt heavy, but he supposed that meant it was working. He saw the intense look on Draco’s face, he was staring Harry’s arm down with the concentration of a surgeon in the middle of an operation.  His wand was precisely aimed and he stared intently at Harry's arm. A couple minutes later and Draco stopped.
In that moment, Draco realized that he had never been so free to express his love for another. This was real, is was all so real. He wasn’t trying to impress, it wasn’t just a one night stand, and he didn’t have to worry about what others would think if they found out. He was completely and utterly free, just as much as the boy under him.
Now, Draco was having to deal with it. Ever since his trial at Wizengamot when Harry defended him, people considered him a war hero and then realized that he's an attractive war hero, just like Harry. Suddenly he was in the news for helping Harry shop for baby clothes, there was a scandal about his parents not seeing him for Christmas, it was leaked that he was training under Pomfrey and was the heir to the hospital wing at Hogwarts, and only a few weeks ago a few magazines and newspapers wrote about the hilarious story of how Harry broke his arm and was being treated by Draco.
Draco gave a small smile and shifted a bit, scooting away from Harry. He was feeling sentimental and needed to be able to hold his husband. “Come here. Lay with me. I promise I won’t do or say anything dirty.”
Sure it was manipulation, but it was for a good cause. And quite frankly, it tended to always work very well in Draco's favor.
“No.” Draco cut him off. “I don’t and I never will regret our dance. I’d do it a million more times in front of the entire world. This isn’t your fault. It isn’t even my fault. This is just the press, desperate for a story.” He looked at the paper once more before something seemed to click on his head. “You thought I looked handsome?” He looked back up at Harry with a grin.
“I can, I just don’t want to.” He didn’t bother putting his hands in the correct position to dance and simply threw them over Draco’s shoulders. “I like being near you.”
“I don’t know. I just do it.” Harry didn’t think he was reading fast, this was just his normal pace.
Harry was making one hell of a dent in the restricted section. No book was spared from his hands. He was already on P, besides books focused on Potions or poltergeists, there wasn’t that much in the P section. He was also talking to other Professors about what teaching was like. He took advice he could get because DA was his only experience, and it certainly wasn’t a normal classroom environment. He was also talking with McGonagall about what he would be expected to teach the students each year, “Because Merlin knows I have no idea what I’m suppose to know in DADA, hardly any of the teachers were competent and all of them except Lupin managed to screw me over.” McGonagall wrote out a list of concepts that each year should be taught and Harry began to write out everything he knew on each subject, citing books and personal experience. He’s never been so excited about the future before.
Both boys gave little nods. Pansy began setting up snow globes while Harry put out the candles Draco got.
Skull mask, dark blue robes, looked very professional, had blonde hair, and based on the way he ran off, was fairly young. This narrowed down the suspect pool quite a bit. Well-off, potential alliance to Death Eaters and Voldemort, blonde, and under the age of 40. That actually took out a lot of suspects considering most of Voldemort's sympathizers and allies were in Azkaban, and those who weren't were fairly old.
Although the dragons slept in the sitting room, occasionally, one or two would wake up and want attention. To save his door from being clawed down, he’s slept with it open for a year. Dragons are also sensitive to pheromones, and although discreet, humans do release them. Due to their lack of maturity, the sensual change in odor was perceived as an innocent excitement. It was mortifying. He hardly touched himself due to that, and the fact that he was often too exhausted.
“Harry, when one experiences honey, multiple senses are involved. Sight, smell, touch, sound, and taste. It floods your senses and overwhelms you. I’ve had it all with you. But unfortunately, I haven’t tasted you yet.” He described it in the same posh way someone would describe an experience with a fine wine.
Harry knew his cheeks were red and he looked away, glaring at the floor. "I can't believe I agreed to let you do this." He didn't sound the slightest bit regretful, only embarrassed.
Here he had every important politician moving around him like planets around the sun, trying so hard to impress. As he walked, he was stopped over and over by people who wanted to shake hands and kiss his arse in hopes that he might remember their name or face. Everyone wanted a piece of him. Everyone wanted something. An alliance, agreement, support, money, a night in bed, a relationship, some even wanted to do favors for him in hopes that they could make themselves useful to such an important person. It was just like Versailles, where nobles once paid for the honor of acting as servants to the king only so they could whisper in his ear. But Harry had no interest in being the benevolent king everyone saw him as.
“Why not? His track record is impeccable.” He usually wouldn't listen to someone trying to tell him what to do, but he knew she was quite perceptive, so he decided to hear her out.
Sirius already had tears streaming down his face but he wasn’t crying nearly as hard as Remus and James. He wanted to stand strong and comfort his friends. But nothing could prepare him for what Harry was about to say.
"I just, I. Uhm. I didn't think it through this far." His voice was soft and he ducked his head a bit, feeling a mix of joy and meekness.
While Draco spent the night packing his things, Harry spent it cleaning and making room. He pushed some furniture around, he cleaned everything until it was spotless, he even did the laundry just so the basket would be empty when Draco arrived. He wasn’t sure why he was suddenly displaying nesting behavior, but here he was. He chalked it up to nerves and tried to get some sleep.
“So, for clarification, I’m talking in real-time to real people? Are you lot still hanging around?” Not that he wanted to meet them in person, it just felt like the next thing to ask. Though the conversation wasn’t exactly natural, Harry was trying his best.
. I am no saint. I've done a lot of filthy things with many men. Here and elsewhere. Somehow its always Hufflepuff guys, I've done a few Ravenclaws, another Slytherin once, but now I think it's high time I took a Gryffindor. I'm not some meek prey for the taking. I am the predator, you're fresh meat, and I will eat you alive. So I suggest you stop now. I wouldn't want your first time to be in a hospital bed while you have a broken arm."
Harry huffed, “I’ve wanked a few times before, but I haven’t exactly been anywhere that I could wank.”
The blonde noticed and spared him a few glances. Part of him got worried as he only ever knew Harry to space-out when he was remembering unpleasant things or when he was overwhelmed, and this looked a lot like spacing-out. “Harry? Are you alright?” When the other didn’t respond he asked his question again and took the other’s hand in his.
Pansy jumped at the chance to make her friend feel better as she knew exactly what he was thinking about. “Better late than never, you can start now.”
"Smart." She commented before turning her full attention back to Draco. After a moment, a sudden thought made her snap her attention back to Harry. "I suppose I forgot to thank you. Your spell nearly caught the man, which I must be thankful for. Wandless, too."
Hermione’s eyes widened, “Harry, you broke the damn system.” She found herself at a loss wondering why no one else had figured this out before. She assumed that those who weren't familiar with muggle finances probably didn't think to mess in it, and those who were familiar with it, either didn't plan on staying in Wizard society or just didn't think to meddle with it.
“Harry, it’s cool. I’ll understand and I’ll just fall back asleep, really, don’t be embarrassed. It’s perfectly normal.”
“Excellent, tell Granger I want you two working on this immediately. I except a rough plan in a week.”
Draco couldn't really disagree. Instead he rolled his eyes and fixed the greenery. "Well I think my hat is quite dashing."
For the first time since Draco had moved in, he didn’t go into his room after dinner. Instead, he grabbed a book from his room and found a comfy spot on the sofa while Harry did the dishes.
Ron and Dean, for example, wanted to pretend that it never happened. They ignored all the mail they received about it and decided outright that they weren’t going to celebrate or commemorate the Battle of Hogwarts. It was over and they didn’t want to be reminded of what happened. Even if they were on the good side, they still lost. Everyone lost something.
With no class, Harry and Draco stayed up even later than normal talking away. Harry helped Draco study important plants and potions, and Draco helped Harry work on his lesson plans.
A soft cry escaped his lips as the hand on him began to move even faster until he was quite brutally being stroked. His head shot back and his free hand flew to grab Draco’s wrist, though he didn’t try to stop him. He wanted it too badly. His body shook and jerked from the intense feeling. A cry tore from him amidst his panting. He didn’t expect Draco to be so rough, but he loved it.
Harry was painfully aware of how close Draco was to sitting on his lap. The man rested on his thighs, but he tried to ignore it and focus on his lips.
Of all Draco's books about wild and romantic adventures, they all had one thing in common; they were at least a bit sexy. If they were battling dark wizards it was sexy, sneaking around was sexy, going off on a long journey was sexy, even the playful banter and relaxed moments were sexy. But there was absolutely nothing sexy about watching Harry hold on to a sled for dear life, race down a hill, and screech the whole way as his cheeks turned red and his nose ran. They were both freezing, tired from walking up the hill over and over, and their sleeves were damp from all the times they wiped their eyes and nose. It wasn't sexy at all, but it was beautiful.
Something about that gave Harry paused before he responded. "I think that's a wonderful reason. Life is too short for regrets."
“You wrote about me as if ..... as if .....” He trailed off and searched for the right words. “You wrote about me as if you caught the god of innocence falling victim to physical pleasure, and ..... and that his ..... my.” He blinked a few times, his mind was a bit muddled by the romantic situation they were in. “And that my ..... reactions, to pleasure were innocent. And that my momentary loss of innocence, w-was beautiful.”
Draco froze a moment, hardly able to believe what Harry was saying. He blinked a few times and tilted his head. “Seriously?”
The realization was like a breath of fresh air. What was once an identity crisis was now a rebirth. The old Harry was dead, and he felt so free.
Draco then spoke about how he and Harry looked at a house and that he supposes he’ll give Harry the luxury of living with him. It was meant to be arrogant, but really it was just adorable.
He wouldn’t see his friends everyday again, he wouldn’t be a student with a simple school life. Perhaps he had grown too attached to his last year at Hogwarts. He almost felt like he had lost something big. The castle that protected him in the war, the peers and teachers that stood by him, the laughs, the smiles, the tears, the way that had all grown together for nearly a decade, everything was all just a memory now.
“The one and only.” His neutral expression was replaced with a look of sorrow. “Mr. Potter, I really am sorry about all of this. I should have better advised you in what you kept a-”
Narcissa looked up from where she sat on the other side of Draco, while Pansy moved to situate herself between the Auror and Harry. “Problem?” She asked with teary eyes and a raised eyebrow before Harry could get a word in. He recognized that tone for all the times she’d sassed him in Hogwarts. He was almost flattered to hear it used in his defense.
“I-I. I’m not opposed to doing something. I’m just nervous. I’ve never done anything before. Especially not with a man.”
Harry thought a moment, quickly coming up with a theory, “Because you lot linked your minds to a piece of paper and didn’t want it traced back to you.”
Harry didn’t know toddlers were so empathetic. But it warmed his heart. “A little bit. But I’ll be okay. Go open your last present, Teddy. Happy birthday.”
Draco glared. He was overcome with a mix of embarrassment and shame. His entire life he never had books for someone like himself, and now that he did, they were being made fun of. Not to mention they were one of he only things that made him feel better about the situation he was in, even though they teased him about a concept of love that he would never know.
“Draco, that’s wonderful!” Blaise exclaimed upon seeing what remained of the mark. “Just in time for the start of spring. I bet the ink will be gone by next month.” He said as he looked over the area. “Maybe you’ll be left with a cool scar like your little boyfriend. Or, perhaps, the scar will fade too and you’ll have a clean slate.”
Harry wrote a letter to Molly, working out Christmas plans with her, actively trying to make time for Draco.
Harry obeyed and moved the arm that hid his eyes. They held such a sweet desperation. He looked into Draco’s for a few seconds before his own widened and his lips parted. He nearly shouted the other’s name and that, along with his shocked expression, only made Draco try to move even faster. He called out the other’s name a few more times and writhed around, seeming to struggle with the intensity. It was finally happening. That feeling that rested just outside of himself finally lurched forward to overcome him.
He furrowed his eyebrows, moving his hand a bit faster and keening into the pleasure. His head tilted back but he didn’t dare to make a sound. Even though he was a few rooms down, Draco was a bit worried about being caught. But that only made things worse as he was thrust into a guilty fantasy about Harry hearing him, walking in, and taking care of Draco’s issue himself.
The mood thankfully lightened after a while. She thought the scar was funny, which was probably the best reaction they could have hoped for. But it also brought the conversation back around to what happened and her coma. To Harry's embarrassment, she mentioned that she'd been fading in and out for days and that she managed to catch large chunks of sounds and smells. It embarrassed Harry because he wondered if Draco was experiencing the same thing. Not to say he would mind of Draco heard what they had been saying, but he did just confess that he would be willing to eventually have a wedding to make their marriage real.
They spent the rest of the night getting drunk, eating gingerbread, and teasing each other. Between the fire, necklaces, and wine, the snow outside meant nothing and the two couldn’t have been warmer in the middle of winter.
Shacklebolt nodded, “It was Granger’s idea. She didn’t tell me why cupboards were significant to you, and you don’t have to tell me, but I trust she picked a good name.”
“Oh contraire, Wizengamot undid the laws surrounding the oaths we took, but didn't search as deep into old law as I did. This is very legal. Just as legal as Potter’s rights to my wine.” He grinned as if he had just revealed a secret.
While most students at Hogwarts were stressing over their grades and classes, Harry had much bigger fish to fry. Draco’s birthday was only four days away and he had absolutely no idea what to do.
Seeing that made Draco freeze in his tantrum. He didn’t mean to scare Harry like that. Now that he knew about Harry’s past, he felt a bit guilty for slamming the door. “Sorry.” He mumbled, sitting on his bed with balled up fists.
Luna is gentle and intelligent, but being touched without any warning makes her instinctively pull out her wand. She doesn’t want to go back into the dungeon.
Draco thought a moment. “No.” He finally concluded, realizing that every aspect of his life had been controlled and predetermined. “Not until I started rebelling in my own way. I don’t know why or when or what line was crossed, but somewhere in fifth year I had enough. I think it had something to do with Dumbledore dying. Even if it was part of Dumbledore’s plan, I still hate that I had any part of it.”
Harry was used to being told he was an idiot. He was used to the words stupid, imbecile, dumbass, foolish, harebrained, moron, halfwit, and cretin being thrown around.
Draco considered both options and very quickly found that he had no preference. “I just want the bloody mark to be gone”
He nodded and didn't seem embarrassed about it in the slightest. "Given that I managed to almost die every year, and then one year I actually did, I haven't exactly had the time to fool around, but I'm comfortable with that." He lifted his chin and gave the other a wiry smile, "What about yourself?"
Every time Harry did something new with his tongue, pace, or humming, he was gauging Draco’s reactions to find out what was most effective. It only took him a few seconds to discover what drove Draco wild. He was a quick learner.
“One day, I’m going to take my time with you, and I’m going to eat you alive.” His eyes were hungry as they raked over the body before him. “Merlin, I want to taste every inch of you.” He was far too turned on and eager to change his pace and keep it slow, so he gave the promise of another night.
The blonde’s jaw dropped as he realized that this was the thing Harry had been afraid of. He wasn’t really scared of being hurt by his old family, he wasn’t worried about them finding out, he was worried that nobody would believe him and that everything that happened to him really was justified. His entire recovery rested on the fact that what they did was wrong and he didn’t deserve it. To have heard his neighbor imply otherwise must have been crushing him. “Of course I believe you. I know you aren’t a liar and everything they did, every bit of it, was wrong. You didn’t deserve any of that. You deserve the world Harry. Every bit of it.”
Draco nodded and took his turn. "Well, I don't like being choked or slapped ..... not in the face at least. My arse is good for it though." He saw the shock and dark flush on Harry's face and it gave him a good bit of satisfaction. "You?"
They entered their room and Harry looked under his bed, pulling out a few presents and handing them to Draco, “Merry Christmas.” He said shyly. He was a bit nervous about whether or not Draco would take a joke.
It was then that Draco delved into the story of being woken up by the smell of brownies. He handed her the basket and they ate the dessert while they spoke. Their conversation touched upon every subject they could think of, until a few hours later, when it looped back around to talking about Harry.
In Wizengamot, they hadn’t passed an actual plan for protective services, but addressed all the issues that the new department would need to be responsible for and described what they could do. It detailed a plan for adoption and a better procedure for housing displaced children. It also finally made verbal, physical, magical, and psychological abuse illegal.
“Yes, but you telling me and me seeing it for myself are two very different things. Of course I took your word for it. But there was still a bit of uncertainty. I’m glad they’re alright with this.” He paused a moment. “When should we tell our friends?”
Draco nodded and he moved to sit right next to Harry while still keeping a comfortable distance, just in case. “I know we both said we want to keep our pants on, and that’s still true for me. Instead of deciding whether or not we want to do something,” he trailed off a moment, trying to find the right word, but he didn’t. So he started his sentence over. “Rather than deciding how far we go, we could start off small, make sure we’re comfortable with everything, slowly do more, and just do whatever feels right. So, maybe we could go back to kissing, and if you feel okay with my lips moving down to your neck ..... they might. Does that sound okay?”
They focused their efforts on smoothing out the process for the protective services. How someone could report abuse, how it would be investigated, what was to happen to the family while the investigation went on, and how the court should go about handling the case.
Harry cracked a smile. "Nothing better to do, I suppose." He said as he took in a deep breath. As much as he wanted to be present for their conversation, a sleepy feeling had taken over him, but it wasn't lack of sleep. He couldn't focused, falling silent and still. Nevertheless, he managed to voice his thoughts. "I can't stop thinking about how I reacted. In Hogwarts I never would've let someone talk to me like that. I probably would have skipped words and kicked his arse for that." He tilted his head and gave a small frown. "What happened to me?"
“Mostly, yea. I’ve learned to make out words, but everything’s just a bit blurry. I can’t see in complete detail.” He looked around for an example. “Like that throw pillow over there.” He pointed to the one beside Draco. It was light blue but had very small dark blue dots. “It’s spotted, yea? The spots are too small for me to see. I only know it’s spotted because Hermione told me. I assume the spots are some shade of blue, similar colors can make it harder for me to make out details.”
“Can I read it?” Harry really didn’t have the patience to wait until the book was published. He was too invested as is.
Draco took it and drank most of it. He then used his magic to check on Harry’s ribs again. “That three week period is looking more like a week and a half now. Technically I did that lot longer than I was suppose to. I only should have done it about thirty seconds.”
May first rolled around like fog. It clouded over everyone and everything. The students of Hogwarts acted like it was just another day, but in the back of their minds, they were all thinking about the same thing. They all remembered what happened.
Harry relented. He already didn't like the idea of lying to Hermione, so he came clean. "Yes, it was me. The financial department told me about it during our meeting, and after the article on the bill came out, I decided to make an example out of Crow."
“I know. But I want to. It would be a lot easier to deal with me if you knew why I’m like this. Why I can’t take loud sounds or sudden movements, why I’m slow to intimacy, why I don’t open up like you do. I know I’m not always easy.” He decided to start from the beginning. “I couldn’t tell you much about my childhood. I don’t have many memories. Most of the things I remember are like snapshots. Little flashes with no context. Uhm.” He paused a moment, trying to find things to say. He worried that maybe he wasn’t abused, maybe he’d made it up in his head and that’s why he didn’t have examples. What if this was a cry for attention that manifested itself in a fake traumatic childhood? He felt crazy. His nails jabbed even faster at his palm and his throat was suddenly dry. He worried that he might start coughing. He felt humiliated.
Draco immediately thought of a few ways he and Harry could warm up. He was so attracted to the man next to him, it was ridiculous. "Thank you for making this, by the way."
Draco stared at the house. A house he hadn’t seen in six years. He missed it greatly and was very happy to be back, but he was also worried. He was worried it would remind him too much of his old life, of his father, that it would only make him sad to be there. This place was so important to him, he didn’t want to associate it with anything sad. He so desperately needed this to be his happy place. His eyes searched the exterior for any sign of a bad memory, but there was nothing. Although he missed the man he used to know, he was content with him only existing in memories. As they flowed through his mind he was pleasantly surprised that they weren’t as painful as he thought they would be. Rather, they brought a soft and hesitant smile to his face.
He went out into the common room and found his friends all gathered together at their usual spot on the three couches.
That lead to a short discussion about politics, and then to Harry's career. They talked about him switching to focus on The Cupboard Project and Seamus agreed that it would probably be best for him to focus on it.
Harry raised an eyebrow and spoke rhetorically, “I lived under the staircase, in a room with five guys, in a spare bedroom of a house where I’m beat for making too much noise, with my best friend in his room, and now with you. Please tell me which one of those situations is best for wanking?”
Cold weather seeped into Harry’s bones, it was especially noticeable one day when they were all studying at the fireplace. Harry was nearly shivering.
Harry took a few more deep breaths, and although it hurt some and was a bit uncomfortable, there was an undeniable excitement bubbling in him. He’d never felt so open yet so full before. He shifted his hips and let out a breathy moan at the thumb that circled his tip once more. The warm and still-lubed hand began to stroke him and pulled a gentle cry from his lips. He twisted and felt his body give in to the pleasure. “Bit deeper.” His voice was breathy and wanting.
Since Harry paid for the house, Draco insisted on buying a majority of the furniture. Harry also decided to leave the decorating up to Draco since he had tastes that would better suit the house. Harry didn’t really care about how the house was decorated or furnished. Still, Draco ran every piece by Harry for approval.
Harry stared at them a moment. "I grew up with my livelihood dependent on how my aunt and uncle felt about me at the moment. As a result, I became good at reading emotions, which is how I know you're lying to me right now."
Draco, on the other hand, felt absolutely pathetic. He couldn’t believe he was getting jealous when Harry wasn’t even his. He decided to help himself feel better by Flooing home and pampering himself. He took a long and warm bubble bath, massaging himself as he washed. He was able to relax a while and not think about how dumb he was being. He really couldn’t believe he was feeling this way over a boy that wasn’t his. Still, the bath was so relaxing that he couldn’t help but to let it go for a while. He put on a few different lotions and spritzed on his favorite cologne. He felt strangely better after pampering himself. He took the Floo back to see Harry standing in their sitting room, with John.
She let out a laugh. “I figured you wanted to talk politics. I’m not quite sure about Pawk’s bill. My only concern is what will and won’t be qualified as discrimination and how that would be determined.”
Draco told her all about his plan to make Harry his, and she loved it, proud to see her friend back to his old Slytherin ways but for a good purpose. She knew exactly how she needed to play Harry in order to mould him into Draco’s plan.
Harry did a complete turnaround as his cries turned into a deep and low moan when everything crashed and he finally came. His body fell slack and he twitched a bit in Draco’s mouth as he spilled out into the blonde. It was always most intense for him when he was right on the edge, but his climax was deeply relaxing.
Though they were now in their early thirties, Harry and Draco hadn’t changed that much. Harry’s hair had gotten curlier and longer, his scar was a bit more faded and turned to something white and tapered out, making it look like real lightening, he’d gotten tanner, and swore up and down he’d grown a few more centimeters. He didn’t, but he claimed he did.
“They may be dumb, but certainly they’ll be able to recognize if they start acting like Dean and Seamus did.” Ron pointed out, hoping that maybe Harry wasn’t as oblivious as he used to be.
Harry huffed and went pink yet again. He looked away and tried not to shiver at the warmth. “Shut up. I have to go to work.”
Draco, meanwhile, was amused by the shift in Harry's mannerisms. He was suddenly very shy, quiet, but happy. He bit his lip as his own smile spread across his face. He was overjoyed to have Harry in his arms and to be able to see how much the other enjoyed it. Harry's smile, adverted eyes, soft grip, and slightly off-beat footwork was all because of him. Harry was happy because of him. His happiness came from Draco. The feeling was overwhelming. Excitement and nerves bubbled up in his chest as he brought Harry along in their dance, finally taking the lead. In his newfound bout of confidence, he decided to tease a bit. "What ever happened to that Gryffindor bravery?"
"When you defended Draco before Wizengamot, you said that your entire life had been planned out since the moment you were born, that you never had a choice. Well now you do. It's time for you to look inward and start asking yourself the big questions. Who are you and what do you want? That's the only way you'll ever be happy."
Seamus is cheery and kind, but sudden bright lights make him flinch and think it’s a curse coming at him. He’ll never forget all the times he was almost hit. All the times he almost died.
Draco wanted to cry. No one has ever seemed to love him so deeply. In that moment he knew that Harry loved him. There was no doubt, no what if, no hesitation. Only two boys in love. That was all that mattered to him.
"You heard me." Draco couldn't help himself anymore. Harry might be best at moving their physical romance when things were light or sweet, but when things got intimate, this was Draco's territory. This was Draco's element. He knew exactly what he was doing and he was so proud of it. He felt like he was in control, after having every ounce of it ripped away by the past few months of his life. This. Their dance. Harry's blush. He could control this. It was as sweet as peach wine.
“I thought you were gonna piss yourself. Then you tried to play it off with a laugh and ‘Mione punched you so hard you flew back into the stone.”
“Please, don't do that.” He hadn't done anything that day, and yet he sounded exhausted. His voice was soft and tired.
Draco could tell Harry had him in mind when he was choosing where he wanted to live. Big, quite lavish, dark, and there was a lovely garden out front. Draco loved it.
Draco sat down on his bed, reading the letter over and over again. He found himself wondering about his own eye color, hair color, touching his lips and glancing down at his clothed body. The letter was so genuine that it made him question his previous opinions of his own appearance.
In the half-hour wait, Harry and Demgass went through the eight dissolved houses. He very smugly made the decision to liquidate everything once belonging to Peter Pettigrew and the House of Lestrange, with the profits going to benefit those afflicted with lycanthropy. The profits of four of the remaining houses were to be donated to help families affected by the war: orphans, widows, houses, and businesses. The profits of the final two would be donated to help repair Hogwarts. He wanted to help undo as much of the damage as he could. He felt responsible since he was the one who didn't die when he should have.
Harry blinked a few times and put on his best puppy dog eyes. “But it felt good. No one’s never touched me like that before.” When he saw playing up the innocence wasn’t working, he took a different angle. “I want you to do even more things to me that no one else has.”
He listened as Draco let out a soft sigh and his back arched in response. He smirked and placed more careful kisses right where Draco liked it most.
“It was great! I spent the afternoon with Hagrid. He spends a surprising amount of time looking around the black market for rare animals. He often buys them so he can save them and give them better homes. Today, he got himself a Hippogriff. I got to name her! Her name is Blue and I love her. I gave her a bath, I fed her, she loves me, we wrestled, and then I helped Hagrid take her to his friend’s place in Ireland where she’ll live on this big ranch. It was so cool!”
What Draco did crossed a line. Not a bad one, but they both knew they were past the point of no return. There was no way they could continue to simply be friends after something like that. No. Draco intentionally pushed them with his letter.
Draco shook his head and leaned over to Harry, knowing Harry was probably already trying to figure out how to set Neville and Hannah up. “So, we’re going to set them up?”
He stared up at the blonde in shock. He blinked a few times and tried to compose himself. Which he mostly did, despite his red cheeks. “Congratulations. I can’t pull your hair anymore.” He struggled a bit and realized he couldn’t shake Draco’s weight off of him. He rolled his eyes. “Okay, you’ve won
The blonde only rolled his eyes and laid down, opening his arms to his lover. He closed his eyes as Harry moved into his embrace. The blanket was tossed over them and they laid there a moment before Draco became aware that it was nearly time for dinner. He decided not to say anything. He wanted to cuddle for as long as possible.
Draco froze and his hands gripped Harry’s hips, his thighs trembled slightly and his head tossed back as his body shot up. His back was arched and his lips were parted as he basked in the glory of Harry’s form. “Oh fuck, you cunning little minx. You’re really going to do this to me?” He knew it wasn’t fair. He knew he would cum and Harry wouldn’t. But he could never resist Harry’s body. He gave in. “I’ll have whatever you’ll give me, love.”
With that, they each got comfy and eventually fell asleep. But just before he fell asleep, Harry found himself thinking of Draco’s jawline one last time, much to his dismay.
“Ooh, say that again. But this time, spit on me.” At this point, Harry wasn’t completely sure if his speak of a degrading kink was just a joke, or if there was a little truth to it.
Harry gave a nod and then hurried off to class, deciding not to think too much about it. It was a Friday, and he was planning on taking Draco with him to see Teddy on Saturday.
Draco was facing him and slightly curled up. Harry positioned himself so that Draco’s head rested on his shoulder and his arms were against his chest. He felt so warm and peaceful. If he could, he would lay there forever.
Harry let out a mix of a groan and a shout and his face pushed into the pillow while his back arched sharply. He was hit with a wave of pleasure that left him needy. It only took a few seconds before he knew he was ready. “Deeper, I can take it.”
When they were back in their dorm, Harry got Draco to tutor him a little more in Herbology before they finally went to sleep.
Harry and Hermione made their way to the front and began presented the department outline. It did not yet involve the laws. This vote was only on whether or not the department would be created.
It was then that Harry realized it had ended just as quickly as it began. His time of being a “normal kid” was over. If it had ever really began. He wasn’t a child. He was nearly nineteen now. Maybe he never was a normal kid. But perhaps, he can be a normal adult, and maybe, he could use his teaching position to make sure no one ever goes through what he did.
Dean is caring and brave, but dark rooms make him panic and forget where he is. It reminds him too much of the dungeon in Malfoy Manor. He was so certain he would die there.
“It isn’t charming, it’s .....” He trailed off a moment. “I don’t know. It isn’t bad but it isn’t charming.”
Harry’s first choices were members of the Order and DA. But, he was also willing to take a chance on a few of the children of Death Eaters. An unsurprisingly low number of his Slytherin peers ever took the Dark Mark. Really, it was just Draco and a few of his friends. Beyond that, almost no young people ever became a Death Eaters. He kept his mental list while the goblin continued.
Harry seemed to think a moment. "I suppose I should explain the rules, here. Never approach a dragon, and you already know to stay out of the west end. Avoid the southeast as well. After courtship, a dragon couple will head southeast for a few weeks of sex. Dragon's are also incredibly vain. They bathe often, use leaves to shine their horns and claws, they also go into hiding to molt in private. That's done in the north, so avoid that too. The shacks are in the northeast, more east than north, far enough not to bother the dragons. There are signs showing you when you're getting too close to a forbidden area."
Draco felt it and smirked. “You’re already shaking, so easy.” He teased as he shifted a bit and took a bit more in. He was only a few centimeters from the hilt and he could tell. “Just another moment.” He wasn’t quite ready to have Harry all the way in him.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I’m impressed. I didn’t think he cared enough to form an entire strategy.”
They were finally together and that constituted a full evening in each other’s arms. So they laid there for hours, until they had to cook dinner. Once more, they didn’t go to bed alone. But instead of Harry’s smaller room, he joined Draco in the master bedroom, and was slowly driven crazy by the scent of that stupid French cologne that he’d come to love.
to happen. Harry lost a bit of himself to make the war easier to deal with and now he was thrown into the bloodbath of politics, so maybe it only made sense that he would still have the behaviors of someone in a war. Someone trying to survive. It was a jungle disguised in plum robes.
Ron nodded and they went back to the conversations that were drifting around the table. Hermione, Dean, and Pansy were locked in a discussion on electricity as Pansy had to know how to get Muggle Christmas lights to work, and Draco and Seamus were going on about the book they had been planning. Ron and Harry exchanged a glance as they realized they didn’t quite fit into either conversation and silently agreed to go get some food.
His entire demeanor shifted from awkward and kind to deeply sympathetic. "Our relationships with our family can be very complicated. We want to love them and get along, because that's our family. You were born and raised with them. And now, they're suddenly gone. I know you don't want to dislike them and you don't want to rid them from your life because no matter what, that's still your family. But blood isn't where family has to end. Ron Weasley is like a brother to me, but we aren't related in the slightest. You
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Oh. That explains why you tried so hard. I thought you were going to break your jaw.”
He blushed, panting and looking Draco in his eyes as he felt the last of himself gushing out of the tip of his cock.
Harry pulled his underwear off and looked down, embarrassed to see that he was already halfway there.
He took a deep breath and stood up from the table, rushing to the fridge and pulling out ingredients. He needed to bake.
“You were, it was utterly pathetic.” Harry was grinning from the memory, it had been quite hilarious.
Just as Draco started chapter six, Harry gave a slight jolt under him. "Love, I have to get back to work."
Draco raised an eyebrow and set his hand on the table, leaning over it to get in Harry’s face, though he wasn’t too close. “First of all, you aren’t allowed to do that above my jaw or below my thighs.” That alone shocked Harry and made his face go red. “Secondly, make a move like that again and you won’t be so virginal for much longer.”
“What did you tell it?” He was a bit perturbed by how easily the dragon killed the hare, but even more so by how Harry was unfazed by it.
Harry will never stop. He had already decided that even in his older years, he’ll tell Ron all about how he regrets never sleeping with his brothers. Assuming he never actually does.
When he checked out, the woman didn’t even seem to pay attention to what it was she was ringing up. She only added the amounts on the tags and took Draco’s money, as he, of course, paid with exact change.
They agreed that they didn’t quite need rings. Their matching necklaces that burned with magic were more than enough for them. But they still had the wedding they’d always wanted. Draco handled decorating, with Harry’s input and opinions in mind, while Harry mostly focused on the technical stuff like invitations and setting dates. Draco wore the traditional dark wedding robes and a few family heirlooms while Harry managed a more modern muggle suit. The blonde nearly despised the way his husband managed to pull off a floral jacket. But they each found the other immensely beautiful in their respective dress.
“I’m gonna smother you in your sleep, I swear.” Draco said as he pulled out his wand. He then cast a spell to allow him to see Harry’s bones. It was like a magical X-Ray.
"I know. You aren't a violent man, Harry." He reached into his pocket and pulled out some small packets. "Here, I want you to have these. I know you like nature and cooking, so I got you some seeds. Since it's nearly winter I got the ones for the season. Apples and a few flowers."
Harry was dumbstruck. He was aware that no pureblood house was perfect. He knew they had to marry people of other blood-statuses, even the occasional muggle, to prevent it from getting incestuous. But he didn't realize his own family line followed the same pattern. As hard as it was, he could handle being practically pureblood. That didn't hurt him. But to refer to his mother's blood as
The first kiss alone made his back arch and a gasp escape his mouth. His lips remained parted and he turned his head to the side to give Draco more room. He pressed his thighs together as warmth and excitement rushed between his legs. He closed his eyes and felt Draco slide a hand behind his arched back, holding him while he placed the last few kisses.
He spent the next two hours studying Herbology with Neville and Seamus. Then another two studying Potions with Luna and Hermione.
“Do you remember Rolf? Rolf Scamander, Newt Scamander’s grandson. We’ve been chatting a few months now about different creatures. At first it was strictly research and learning more about the field of magizoology. But then, the letters got more and more personal. Soon we were talking about our dreams to travel the world and look for magical creatures. We’ve been meeting up sometimes. On holidays from school and some weekends we’ll meet and chat about all kinds of things. A few days ago, after some courtship, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said yes. We’re dating and we’re going to travel the world together to search for creatures.”
Draco then smirked and pulled out his own present for Harry. “You’re going to have to try to hide this one.” He said, pulling out a rather large wrapped present.
Harry couldn't stop a small smile from appearing on his face. Though it wasn't playful or happy, it was only spiteful. "I told Wizengamot that I wished it were the killing curse."
Harry couldn’t help but to smile. “I think he’d like to. I also think he’ll appreciate the sweater. Thank you, Molly.” He said before wrapping her in a hug. Much to his dismay, he was only slightly taller than her. In fact, he even feared Ginny would catch up to him as she was a tad taller than Molly.
Harry decided not to comment when he realized a lot of the furniture was dark green. He honestly found it to be a bit adorable.
“Good luck having to explain that one, mate.” Ron said, having faith that Harry and Draco wouldn’t end up like Seamus and Dean, he really hoped the Howlers might speed things along.
When they returned to the house, Draco showed Harry to a spare room before heading to the one he always used to sleep in. They each laid out their pajamas and a set of clothes for tomorrow, along with a few toiletries. Packing had been very light. After they returned to the sitting room, Draco made them both hot chocolate while Harry got to work on the fireplace. Rather than using a spell, the blonde watched from the kitchen as Harry manually lit the fire.
That night, Harry was hit with a flooring realization. “Oh my god. I don’t have to take five-minute showers anymore.” He said with wide eyes as he and Draco finished eating dinner. “It’s been a year.”
The next day, just after lunch, Harry finally caved in. The more he thought about it, the worse he felt. Although he hadn't sunk as low as Draco, he wasn't blameless. He let his anger egg him on, he didn't let it go, and he teased Draco about something that was obviously important to him.
“Oh it’s alright, I’m still a virgin. Nobody ever stays with me long enough for it to get that far.”
Seamus sat up, “Merlin, Dean. Why wouldn’t you tell me something like that?” Of course, he was ecstatic to have received news such as that. Dean being gay was the best response he could've hoped for.
His sleep only brought on a few vague nightmares. He woke up a few hours later and forgot them, anyways.
Draco turned his head to look at Harry. His eyes were met with bright green ones with just a bit of brown around the pupil, dark hair and stubble, dark pink lips and a blush to match. Gorgeous.
“Why would you want to do that?” Part of him just considered it to be just a joke. But part of him didn’t understand why Draco would even consider doing something like that with someone like him.
"It went well. We managed forty out of fifty votes and we give our final vote in twenty days, which I expect you'll be attending to explain the legal side."
About an hour later, Harry spoke up again, “I’m part of another secret society. Want to join?” In addiction to the Order and DA, of course he found yet another society of rebels to join up with. He spoke about it so casually, as if it meant absolutely nothing to him. Quite a way to talk about a secret society.
She held back a laugh and Draco let out a sigh, "Apologies, I forgot you were coming over. I meant to have the decorating done earlier, but
Draco chuckled and raised an eyebrow, leaning closer. “Oh? You just couldn’t resist me, hm? Being the proper gentleman that I am, I can understand how you couldn’t fend off my charm and grace. Truly, I am a being above all others. The sad truth of our situation is, in fact, that
The Floo was already loaded up with his nightstand, vanity, wardrobe, and trunk; some of his only remaining belongings.
A grin spread over Harry's face and he gave a nod. He loved her idea and wanted to help in any way he could. "Start with gaining a few supporters in Wizengamot, just three or four people to back you up. Next, you'll want to find a lawyer who will sponsor the bill. Once you've done that, get everyone together for a conversation on what you expect from the bill, then set up an appointment with Minister Shacklebolt and present it. If he likes it then he'll approve it to be introduced in Wizengamot, then the debates begin. But understand that the elite won't be happy about it. Expect opposition."
Harry suggested a radio station aloud and the radio turned to it. Draco gave the name of a specific Muggle song and the radio started to play it. Harry tried doing the same thing but with a song by a wizard band, and it yielded the same result. They looked at each other, somewhat amazed.
"You got me, there." He admitted. "Harry used to room with me, before all this. He doesn't snore, by the way, I just like messing with him. But his dragons'll stay up till midnight."
They both laid down and Draco didn’t hesitate to wrap his arms around Harry and pull him close. Both of their hearts swelled.
Harry let out a mix of a growl and a whine. Whatever it was, it was needy. He found that his opening was lit up with a thrill that shot across his lower stomach. Inside of him, he realized there were so many little nerve endings that he didn’t even know were there. It was almost overwhelming to feel such pleasure for the first time.
“I love it! Oh, I can’t wait to read it.” He then set the book down and reached to pull out a perfectly wrapped gift, handing it to Harry.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows and unrolled it to reveal it was a land deed. It was the deed to the house he and Harry wanted.
“Why didn’t you suggest this earlier?!” He sounded more exasperated than angry, and rather than any form of attack, he assaulted Harry’s face with kisses, making his lover quickly put his hard down and accept his fate. “You’re bloody gorgeous when you say things I like.”
Harry only stared them down and took the abuse. At one point, Hermione tried to defend him, but he stopped her. "I can take it, 'Mione, don't make yourself a target."
Draco wasn’t sure what to make of what he just heard. Harry was offering to cook him two meals a day and do his laundry. He blinked a few times as this wasn’t at all what he expected. “Thanks, Potter.” His own voice sounded surprised and almost confused.
Draco rolled his eyes a bit. “This is so stupid. I can’t believe I’m married to this bloke. He doesn’t know the first thing about etiquette or class. He eats like a pig!”
They both fell to silence with smiles on their faces, but the silence wasn't comfortable, not completely. There was something about it that demanded more words. Something else needed to be said, but neither knew what. It was that atmosphere, along with their long and open conversation, that made them both feel a bit vulnerable. It was a feeling that had entered their lives since the moment Harry brought Draco home after their fight. They were trying to build something new now that their pasts were behind them, they were talking more and spending more time together, and somehow, in the last two weeks, things had changed. Neither was sure what exactly was different, but something new rested with them on the couch, sat with them at the table, and invaded their beds when they slept.
When Draco removed his hands, Harry tried to move his wrists, but they were magically bound to the bed. He let out a soft whimper upon realizing he was trapped. It really turned him on.
The blonde let out a laugh. “I know you said you’re a virgin but are you really so shy? Does no one hit on you?”
His eyes welled up with tears and he stood up and rushed to Pomfrey. She stood and smiled as she took the boy into her arms.
Although Draco didn't expect to get anything, as his mother was technically the heir, she asked him to come along because she didn't want to go alone.
“Harry, cumming!” The blonde warned his lover as quickly as he could but found himself releasing only seconds later. His body curled around Harry’s head and he shook as he finally came. “Fuck. Fuck. Oh fuck, Harry.” He panted out the words as he finished.
Draco was getting a bit scared for his mother, but he only nodded. He was put in a daze by how his mother genuinely believed his father might try and kill her. When he was young he held his father in such a high regard. He thought his father could do no wrong. But then, as he grew up, things didn't make sense, he realized his father was completely radical, using killing curses on children, murdering without thought, his father fell from the pedestal Draco had put him on.
“Oh, in my parent’s vault I found a silver necklace with a lily on the end. I’ve been wearing it everyday.”
He shook his head. "Whatever. I do need to go home because I need to make dinner, but I want to leave you with this." He pulled out a piece of parchment and handed it to Alex. "I need a story about how Louis Luther is the man to back in the fights against Pawk's bill. Say the opposition is falling behind him to lead, then, watch your words come to fruition."
