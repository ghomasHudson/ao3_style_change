Harry settles himself on Malfoy's abdomen, and pale hands move up to touch Harry's thighs, fingers flexing and stroking Harry's skin like how a master pianist would work the keys. Malfoy's cock brushes Harry's arse, the heat of their bodies rising up in waves in the shimmering air between them. Harry positions himself on top of Malfoy's cock and slowly lowers his hips, no need to stretch him out anymore 'cos he's slick and open from their first fuck and Malfoy's all lubed up and ready-
Potter shrugs a shoulder and gets into position, letting Draco guide his hands to where they should be. Draco walks and talks him through a basic waltz, and it takes a few tries before Potter gets it well enough to be able to dance for a few counts without stepping on Draco’s toes or tripping over his own feet.
Call it instincts, gut feeling, or perhaps you could chalk it up to Harry's experience from watching Malfoy throughout their Hogwarts years, but it was at that exact moment when Harry had known that Malfoy was lying about owning Serpentes.
Malfoy bumps back as they walk along the shore of the Great Lake. He pairs the movement with a playful glance, which quickly turns heated when grey eyes scan Harry’s body.
When they were finished with the painting, Harry blinked in surprise when Dean pointed at the space beside his signature.
“I used to. A long time ago,” Potter replies, his words brisk, and his tone clearly indicating that he isn’t keen on this topic. He quickly changes the subject. “Theo’s lucky to be living with you, then. Our diets, Ron and mine, I mean, would consist entirely of pub food and takeaways if not for Hermione and her occasional home-cooked meals, and her lectures on proper eating.” He laughs, smoothing over the brief tension. “Or are you the sort to not cook outside of work?”
. This is what Draco loves, having Potter’s attention like this, worshipful, intense and incredible. The air is heavy with their groans and the filthy sound of slapping flesh. Draco slams a fist on the table, crying out loud when Potter hits his prostate again, fast and furious—
On hindsight, Draco should have hidden his childhood toy better. He still remembers how Harry had stumbled onto a box of his while they were unpacking in their new home. Draco took one look at the box and suggested as subtly as he could, despite his pounding heart, that they leave the house at once for dinner. Perhaps Harry had got much better at reading Draco, because one corner of Harry's lips hiked up into a half-smile, before the other corner followed in an upwards curve, which meant that Harry was going to be a right cheeky arse about things.
Draco hasn’t said it back to him yet, but it's okay. It's okay, because one day, he will, and the grin on Harry's face will be as dazzling as the one that Draco wears whenever Harry says it.
Charlie drops his facade. "No one, not even my parents, calls me Charles." He sits down. "Took you months to finally start calling me Charlie."
Potter ducks his head, his murmur equal parts embarrassment and shyness. “It’s fucking obscene, isn’t it?” He gestures to his prick, and Draco can’t help but glance at it again. “When someone sees it, they stare, like it’s the best thing they’ve ever seen, but then it’s too big for… for…” he trails off, looking away. “It’s different after that.”
He shifts on his bed, pressing himself further into the corner of his room. He pulls his knees up to his chest, wraps his arms around his knees and starts to rock back and forth.
"Shading and colouring next." Potter changes inks. "I'll have to go over some areas more than once to get good colours. Tell me if you need a break."
Potter's eyes widen at the sight of a half-naked Draco in his black jeans, his lips turning up into a slow smile of satisfaction. Draco simply arches a brow in return and sits up in bed.
Harry remembers his sketch of Malfoy at Mona’s, the many photos of the day, and of Malfoy laughing as he gazes at the Hudson River. He smiles. "Yeah. It took some time, but yeah, I think I've finally found it."
Malfoy releases a shaky laugh of disbelief. "You can't be serious. You’re done? Everyone wants to get laid, and—"
Dan!" There's a note of panic in the presenter's voice now, and small clusters of said audience begin to murmur amongst themselves.
Time stretches as they eat, and eventually Potter pushes his bowl away. He lifts his chin at Draco, his eyes bright and his gaze piercing, determination in his words. "So it's a no, then? I mean, it's pretty obvious, but I want to be clear before I completely give up."
"The Malfoy ring, inherited from centuries of generations." Draco runs a thumb over the ornate family crest and reptilian creatures carved on it. "There's a ceremony that every Malfoy heir experiences at eighteen, when his father would officially pass down heirlooms like this, along with a formal letter detailing the heir’s responsibilities." His lips pull up in a bland smile devoid of mirth. "A pity my father wasn't alive for my eighteenth birthday."
“Stop teasing…” Malfoy says, pulling Harry closer, the heat of his body radiating on Harry’s skin. “Tell me how much you want me, talk to me…”
... except for the equally smitten looks they give each other when they think the other isn’t looking.
"It's Potter. It's always all or nothing with him," Theo says, taking another cushion and tucking it under his head as he leans back against the seat of the sofa. He closes his eyes. They lapse into a companionable silence.
Three days have passed since the Night of the Failed Seduction; Malfoy didn't show up for work the first two nights, presumably to take care of his mother. Just half an hour ago, when Harry had made eye contact with Malfoy at the bar, the other man had looked away pointedly.
Harry turns him on his back and moves on top of him. “Wanna see you. When you come. Your gorgeous face.” He wastes no time sliding into him again, but not before Malfoy shows his displeasure by clawing his fingernails down Harry’s back.
Harry touches the cool, wet surface of his mug. Instead of looking at her, his eyes follow the bead of condensation winding its way down. “How is he?" he asks, his voice small.
"Oh, no. I'm only fucking you with three-quarters of my dick. Gotta get you ready for all of it. If it feels so good like this, imagine how good it'll feel with the whole thing in. You thinkin' of that?" Draco leans down to whisper, his breath becoming more ragged with every thrust.
Draco shifts around on the sofa, and Harry frowns at the closed-off way he folds his arms across his chest. Harry gently pries open his arms, and laces Draco’s fingers with his own. With his other hand, Draco twists the leather bracelets on his left wrist. He is quiet for a long time; although he’s gazing at the painting, the look in his eyes is glassy and faraway. Harry waits for him to marshal his thoughts, and after a while, Draco gives a small nod, and begins to speak.
They stay in for Draco’s birthday, ordering takeaway and cuddling on the sofa, watching telly and drinking wine. Harry bakes a chocolate cake, and even though the frosting comes out wrong and it’s too sweet at the centre, Draco says it’s the best cake he’s had.
There's a swooping sensation, a strange mixture of happiness, disbelief and doubt, in Draco's belly at that realisation.
The living room, one of his favourite places in the house, is modelled after the Burrow. There's a large welcoming sofa and a few squashy armchairs surrounding a coffee table. The colour of the walls and furniture is reminiscent of Harry’s dorm in Gryffindor Tower. He has also enlarged the windows, allowing more light to enter, and removed the thick velvet curtains that accumulated dust and made everything so dark, replacing them with white sheer curtains. Flowerpots dot the windowsills, providing a splash of colour.
Potter peels off the stencil. "Okay. I'm going to clean the area now." He does so, using the wipes and a spell. "D’you want numbing cream?"
When he’s inside the bathroom, he lets out a muffled whoop of glee. "It's not just a shower, Malfoy, it's a bath! Just like the prefects' bathroom! Not as large, but still brilliant!"
Draco turns around at once when Harry enters the room. Harry’s eyes widen; the study is a mess by Draco's standards. Crumpled balls of parchment lay strewn around the table and near Draco's feet. Tomes are stacked haphazardly on the table. Some are open, as if Draco had tried to read one, but got distracted and ended up picking another one.
But of course, since he has the conversational skills of a Flobberworm when he's nervous, along with his raging erection mucking things up even further, he simply croaks out an answer that tosses him further into the abyss of doom.
"Not gonna let a single drop of this go to waste," Harry murmurs, treacle-coated fingers stroking the insides of Draco's thighs.
Harry blinks, and he nudges his glasses higher up his nose. Malfoy couldn't have cursed his glasses, could he? He glances at the students, who are fully absorbed in the duel, but are not giving him any clues about Malfoy's whereabouts. He whirls around on the spot, scanning the environment for anything suspicious, perhaps hints of shoes sinking into the grass or a shimmer in the air, but comes up short.
"Hang on. You switched Quidditch loyalties because of who I was going out with?" Harry says. A slow, impish smirk tugs his lips up. "You're so jealous! Didn't know you were so invested in me.”
Potter wipes Draco’s stomach clean with a towel. He tosses the towel aside, and then eyes Draco’s body, his gaze lingering on his prick. “I could play with you like this for the whole night, make you feel good.”
The waiting is the worst. The last time Harry had felt like this was when he was waiting for his turn to face the dragon in the Triwizard Tournament, and of course luck would have it that once again, he was due to go last.
He turns and hurries towards the pitch, ignoring Potter's shout of dismay. And then Potter's hollering, his words echoing in the night sky.
Draco curls his hand around a vial and hangs his head. "Wanted only one," he mumbles, his voice reedy and weak. "But kept dreaming of you—"
"Right, I'll just come out with it." Harry takes a deep breath. "Why did you kiss me that night in Paris?"
means. Malfoy dabs his lips on a napkin, gets up from the table and carries his wine glass out of the kitchen. Harry follows suit, and they end up at Malfoy's sofa. Malfoy's long legs are tucked underneath his body, his elbows raised up and resting against the top of the sofa and his head leaning on his arms while he regards Harry with bedroom eyes.
"Oh. The dough," Draco repeats. He skates flour-dusted fingers over his heated cheeks, willing his blush to disappear. After taking a moment to recover his equilibrium, he returns to his task.
A tapestry of pornographic images from that day prance through Draco's sex-addled mind. He's like a man stranded in a desert, savouring each memory like a drop of precious water trickling down his throat; pure, undiluted need rioting through his body
Harry rests his left hand on the railing in front of him, and Draco shifts, placing his own hand on top of Harry's. Maybe it's not too mad to imagine a red thread, smooth and untangled, looping snugly around their last fingers and trailing back to their hearts.
"Yes," he says without missing a beat. "He's worth it. Worth everything that could possibly happen." He stands up, pocketing his wand and wallet when Ron hurries to the kitchen.
He’s lying down on his back now, his legs bent and his feet pressed onto the mat as he pumps his hips upwards in a steady tempo. With each upwards thrust, his stomach and his chest forms a straight line. Draco wonders how it’d feel like, caressing that tanned, warm skin, feeling the rapid beat of Potter’s heart under his touch as he rides Potter with abandon, the slick slide of Potter’s hard prick fucking into him as he jerks his hips up just like that, with Draco sinking down while Potter thrusts up, going in deep—
"No one around?" Draco asks. He slides into the booth opposite Harry and sets the jar in front of him.
"I know it’s a shock, but…" Draco presses his lips together in a slight grimace, struggling to find the words. How can he explain that in his mind, it’s Potter, and not his best friend, that he wants as a tattoo artist? How can he articulate the significance of Potter being the one to turn this blemish into something blooming and beautiful? His shoulders sagging, he tries again, "He’s the—"
The offer to join Ron in the Room lies on the tip of Harry's tongue, but he knows the team will kick his arse right out. He needs the night to rest and prepare for next week's field mission.
When they're seated at the table with steaming mugs of tea, Pork Chop curled up on her cushion beside them, Harry motions to the unpacked bags. "Leaving for the Burrow so soon?" Although tomorrow is the last official day of term, Charlie usually packs his things last minute (like Harry), so this means he's leaving earlier. "Everyone's fine, yeah? You're not rushing back 'cause someone's sick or anything like that?"
"Now who's the one talking too much, hmm?" Draco says, smacking Potter on the arse. Potter only chuckles and gets back to business. Draco licks his lips and presses his palms on Potter's arsecheeks, spreading them. The cushion under his head is propped up at the perfect angle for Draco to run his tongue up and down Potter's crease. It's a brief touch, but it's enough for Potter to moan around Draco's cock and suck him even faster.
"Call me that, and I will hex you all the way back to Romania," Draco warns. He drops his gaze down Charlie's body — he might be in robes, but Draco knows how defined his muscles are, thanks to his work at the dragon sanctuary over summer hols. He’s fit (even with all the freckles), there's no doubt about it, but Draco will never see him in that way.
"Well, what's this then? One of your dirty little secrets that I've yet to know about?" Harry had drawled (three years with Draco had significantly improved Harry's drawling technique) and inched a hand closer to the box.
"You don’t know what you do to me," Harry mutters, his orgasm building. "Do to me here." He presses a hand to his heart. He's never been in love, and he doesn't know what his heart is telling him now, but it feels a lot like… like love.
"I certainly do not sound like a dying Hippogriff," Harry hisses back, scandalised. "And I told you to stop watching me!"
Sifting through sentimental attachments is the most emotionally taxing stage for both Draco and his clients — flotsam and jetsam of past relationships, old photographs of splintered families, bits and pieces that remind his clients of loved ones who are long gone. Such keepsakes are the most overwhelming and hardest to let go, re-opening old wounds that have merely been bandaged, not yet fully healed.
Harry hurries after him, eyeing his silly dramatic robes swirling behind him and that stupid shapely arse that makes him want to do all sorts of obscene things to it.
"Changing your hair colour, covering your Mark, hiding away here. This isn't the right way to deal with things. All your friends miss you so much.” Harry is finally saying what he has wanted to say ever since he saw Draco in New York. His heart twinges when Draco cringes and turns away, as if shielding himself from his words. "They've dealt with their demons, and yes, I know you've gone through worse, but you need to deal with this."
Harry smiles and returns it. She cheers, thanks him and runs back to her family. He chuckles when she whacks her brother over the head with her Dragonite.
A furrow appears between Potter's brows. He reaches for his glasses and puts them on. Potter's trying to catch his gaze, but Draco's focusing on the small ant tottering up and down a patch of grass near Potter's tie.
Harry agrees with her, but he's not too worried — Pork Chop is a crafty and smart fire-breathing Ashwinder that is able to camouflage, she's more than capable of taking care of herself.
Harry's shoulders sag. He pushes his fingers through his wet hair, looks down sadly and says in a small voice, "I... I could go away if you don't want me around."
He had misread the situation, but at least he finally had his answer. Disappointment floods his veins like ice-cold water.
Harry reads the rest of the letter, where Hermione talks about McGonagall's career guidance for the eighth-years and her same indecision between becoming a Healer or entering politics. He knows Ron plans to help George at Wheezes until he figures things out.
Surprisingly, Serpentes isn't located anywhere in Wizarding London; instead, it's sandwiched unobtrusively between a Boots pharmacy and a Starbucks in a rather quiet street near Vauxhall. The Muggle passers-by don't even look twice at the club.
Hogwarts suddenly feels stifling, as suffocating as the outside world, with their flashing cameras and intrusive questions.
And it's only now that it dawns on Harry, the realisation so surreal, like he missed a step walking down the stairs. This magnetic pull, this fervent longing between them will never fade. No matter how many countries he visits, how much time has passed, he will never forget about Malfoy. No matter how many men he’s been with, his body will always yearn for Malfoy’s touch.
He stares at the empty seat opposite him, and then back to the plate of pasta. In contrast, Harry's pasta is a feast for the senses: the noodles cooked to the perfect texture, tossed in a rich and hearty sauce with the right combination of herbs adding a beautiful splash of colour and flavour, topped with sprinkles of grated cheese, and paired with a side of fragrant garlic bread.
Harry groans and tosses his head back, exposing his throat, each exhale a moan as he continues to ride Draco like a porn star. The small of Harry's back is slick with sweat, and the sight of Harry enjoying Draco's cock like this is enough to make Draco quicken his thrusts in desperation—
He peers at his sketch of Malfoy. His expression is wonderfully open, full lips stretched into a playful smirk. Malfoy’s features on the sketch aren’t as refined — Harry should’ve drawn his nose longer and his jaw sharper, but he’s captured the essence of Malfoy the performer — the genuine, light-hearted joy and relaxed elegance.
"If he dies because of old age, I would've accepted it!" Charlie rages. "But they poached him right from under our noses, hurt him and drugged him just to make potions ingredients off of him illegally. We got him back, healed him, but he's still going to—" He breaks off, looking away. "I don't want another earring, Harry," he whispers, broken.
Potter hurries down the staircase, holding a faded Gryffindor scarf. He glances out the window, and then tosses the scarf on the sofa. "C'mon," he says. They exit the house, and Draco gazes at the sunset. It hasn’t snowed in a while, and it’s not raining as often.
Stunned, they stare at each other with wide eyes. Neither of them dares to breathe, let alone move; and they're frozen in place like a scene from one of those Hollywood movies.
It took Draco an even longer time to chip away at his denial and admit to himself that his feelings for Potter had developed to something more than platonic. Since Potter would never return his affections, he was content to bask in Harry's company and then go their separate ways after leaving Hogwarts, hoping that his infatuation would fade with the passing of time. Why would Harry Potter be interested in him, a Death Eater?
. Potter is a wonderful fuck; raw and primal, his harsh pants and sharp cries accompanying gasps of Draco’s name, like he’s a
Harry had planned this out even before he stepped through the canteen doors this afternoon. He would reply with a suave and sophisticated answer, which will then kick off a light-hearted and entirely humorous conversation that would have Malfoy throwing his head back and laughing at Harry's witty repartee.
"Just you. Only you," Harry repeats in jagged gasps, starbursts of ecstasy igniting in him like fireworks. "Gonna, I'm gonna—"
"Only to remove the smell of the paint, and Everlasting Charms and tamper-proof spells for maintenance after the painting is finished. It's really up to the artist, I know Dean uses magic on his paints to add a bit of sparkle, and spells on his canvas to change the lighting. Other artists take it a step further and enchant their drawings to move, like wizarding photographs, but I like to keep things simple."
"Can't remember," he says smoothly, although his demeanour becomes increasingly prickly, a tell that he's getting defensive. He taps his fingers on the cover of his book. "Care to tell me why you're suddenly so interested in Draco, after seeing him around the canteen for two years?"
Draco closes his eyes and increases the pace and intensity of his thrusts. When Potter's moans meld together with his own grunts, Draco opens his eyes. It's a wonderful sight: Potter's coaxing his own erection back with his hand, and the sight of his own sliding in and out of Potter... fuck, Draco's never gonna forget this; he's already locking every detail away in the jewel box of his heart.
Perhaps Potter is reminded of that too, for he looks away and jumps up from his seat, mumbling something about chamomile tea. As he busies himself with preparing Draco's favourite tea, Draco sits down beside his vacated chair, setting his box on the middle of the table.
“It was good,” comes the brisk reply. “How was yours? How’s Wood doing, by the way?” Malfoy bites out, and lifts his hand to study his fingernails casually, as if Harry’s answer means nothing.
Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, brimming with whimsical magical products and practical jokes, is a breath of fresh air from his upbringing. More importantly, Draco remembers hurrying along Diagon Alley during the height of the war, and seeing the shop as the only bright spot against a backdrop of fear, grimness and turmoil that he had been ensnared in. That image had stuck with him, because the shop represented laughter, happiness, a blatant disregard of the rules…
"Imagine my luck when he told me that you were in charge of this. If it had been any other Auror, they would have locked me up in a heartbeat. I can't leave London, not with my mother in this condition, but neither could I stay, so you were my best bet. I helped you, and you, in turn, will help my mother get treated at St. Mungo's," Malfoy smirks at Harry, angling his body towards Harry. "Never knew that Gryffindor integrity would end up in my favour one day."
Parkinson thinks it over, red fingernail tapping on her glossy bottom lip. She shakes her head decisively. "No. They're both too unpredictable, especially Potter. I'm sure we could come up with the best laid plans, and it'll blow up in our faces. Plus, Draco's sharp. He'll know if something's up, especially if we keep meeting like this. We just have to... fan the flames to nudge things along."
“It’s just a cold. I’m feeling better after Pomfrey’s medication. I should be back for lessons tomorrow.”
There's a familiar rumble of footsteps and the low, muffled hum of excited chatter, and the majestic doors of the Hall swing open.
Harry puts his coffee down, and then takes off his jacket and drapes it on the back of his chair, something that he does every morning when he reaches the office. On his table are two manila envelopes printed with the choices of two locations for his next posting:
Fuck, look at Malfoy, at his slender, pale body, once so tight and rigid, now so pliable and relaxed, so hungry for more. His limbs are splayed apart, hips moving in hypnotising circles, riding Harry's three fingers. He's so ready, so fucking ready to take Harry’s cock.
"No! Things wouldn’t be the same anymore, I'm not denying that! I just don't want you to ignore me." Harry takes a deep breath. "I'm sorry for what I did, leaving you like that and for all the pain that you endured, especially at the memorial service. But it was for the safety of the wizarding world. It was our duty." His voice drops. "I hope you understand."
After a moment, he whispers, hesitant to wake Potter if he’s asleep, “Your tattoos…” He got a closer look, they appear to be dates and words. “What are they?”
Alert, Harry scrambles up at once, snatches of yesterday night's bedtime conversation filtering through his mind.
Potter isn't even surprised, as if he's... expected Draco's size. He's staring at it with such hunger, as if he's the one that has won Draco's cock instead of Draco winning Potter's arse. Draco opens his mouth to say something, but is derailed when Potter slides Draco's pants off his hips.
Potter traces a fingertip along the cupid’s bow of Draco’s lips, his touch so gentle and so intimate that it makes Draco’s heart flip over. He catches Potter’s wrist and kisses each of his fingertips, never breaking eye contact with the other boy.
Draco’s mouth falls open in surprise. "What?" He lowers his cup of caramel macchiato to the coffee table.
Harry grabs his pencil, its tip hovering over Malfoy's fringe in the sketch. Should he colour his hair black?
“Should I stop?” Harry asks. He steps out of the lake, dries off and pulls his socks and trainers on.
It starts from the back of her neck; a sprinkling of snowflakes (it’s a magical tattoo so it's slightly brighter than normal) spiralling down to the top of her right shoulder blade. The winding snowflakes land on a tattoo of the Parkinson estate, its large windows stained with cobwebs and the grounds of the estate fading away into dense, vertical tree roots, a homage to the Parkinson legacy and history.
They look at each other for a moment, and Harry leans into Malfoy's touch when he runs the back of his knuckles along Harry's stubble on his jaw. Malfoy likes him scruffy, so he grew his stubble out during hols, although he prefers to be clean-shaven during term.
Grey eyes flash as Malfoy shakes his arm free. A coil of heat flares deep in the pit of Harry's belly. It's been years, and it's amazing how Malfoy can still trigger this visceral passion in him.
"Treacle tart, Auror Robards?" Malfoy asks sweetly, offering it to Robards. "New addition to the menu on Fridays, and freshly baked in-house."
Sirius Black’s penknife sits on the opposite end of the counter, its presence and significance wedged in the air like a third shadow.
The castle’s response is a warm breeze surging through the windows, and a further dimming of the fire. Tendrils of moonlight glimmer on the floor, stretching towards the base of the memorial. It is comfortable, peaceful and soporific, and Draco’s eyelids are heavy. His shoulders slump and his body relaxes, releasing the coiled-up tension gathered during his monologue about his House. He could sit here and talk to Potter for hours, perhaps even fall asleep, curled up in Potter’s arms until the warmth of dawn approaches.
The first thing that catches Draco's attention are the green gardens, studded with blooming tufts of flowers in splashes of stunning colour — purple, yellow and red. A few children burst like comets through a flock of pigeons, scattering the birds in all directions.
A visible shudder ripples through Potter. His eyes are midnight with sadness, a tell-tale tremor in his voice. "Sirius... he said something like that before. About us not forgetting." He sucks in a shaky breath. "The ones who love us... they don't really leave us, that we can always find them..." He slowly raises a hand, pressing his palm to his heart. "In here."
He had fucked Draco — bow and all — fucked him so hard and fast that the knot of the ribbon unravelled by itself.
With every second, a noxious cocktail of confusion, disbelief and shock morphs into ire, frustration and resignation. He stalks towards a wall, sticking a finger into his collar to give himself more air, easing the heated anger coiling in him. Fuming, he leans against the wall and folds his arms across his chest. With narrowed eyes, he watches them dance, each graceful step of Greengrass feeling like she’s stomping all over his heart.
"Take this and go away. This is what you want, isn't it? Just desserts?" he says, bitterness creeping into his words. He snatches a slice of chocolate cake and thrusts it into Harry's hands. "I've got to work," he adds brusquely, pushing past Harry — a thrill sparks through Harry at the contact — and disappearing into the kitchen. Green eyes track him, until he can no longer see Malfoy anymore, his blond head hidden by the towering shelves and racks.
"Come back to mine?" Draco offers, kissing Potter’s cheek. “I want to hold you tonight.” He longs to embrace him like what Potter does to him during some mornings, when they trade sighs for kisses and whispers for touches.
According to Ron, since Malfoy hadn't been that horrified by Harry's "potato disaster" (as coined by Ron amidst hilarious laughter as he recounted that incident to Hermione), a more composed Harry decides to be more aggressive in his advances.
"Want more," Harry hisses, shoving himself deep. "’M fuckin’ you, but still so horny. Want more." An inferno of lust bursts in his blood, white-hot and fiery pleasure building at the base of his spine. How is this even possible, how can Malfoy reinvent sex like this?
Malfoy might or might not have changed, he might or might not be implicated heavily in the snake trafficking scheme, but Harry still needs proof because he's here on a case,
Malfoy begins to button his shirt. "Room of Requirement. We obviously can't go to the dorms,” he says briskly.
Potter chuckles. "Ah, there he is, there's the Malfoy I know." He licks off the chocolate on his finger. "How's your organising book coming along?"
"The Muggles are not accustomed to a snake on the streets," Draco says. He would like to take Potter to the Eiffel Tower and other Muggle attractions, besides the usual wizarding ones. "Otherwise, she is welcome to come along."
"Harry?" he whispers, moving deeper into the small clearing surrounded by trees. He's sure he heard something around here, but there are no other footprints in the snow. He stays still for a moment, his senses on high alert.
reporting on their memorial service. He dashes the tears away from his eyes, smooths the paper out and stares at Draco's picture.
Harry doesn’t recognise all of the songs — his own music tastes are rather limited to rock and punk, so it’s a rather refreshing change, listening to music stripped down to only a voice and an acoustic guitar. His neighbour’s music is a mix of pop and rock, and Harry whispers along to the words when he knows them. The pop songs, however, aren’t his cup of tea, but it’s how the voice sounds — yearning and emotional, as if caressing a lover — that is entirely mesmerising. Harry reckons that his neighbour is smiling as he sings sometimes, and he’s keen to know if his smile is as beautiful as his voice.
He barges into Sin, ignores Zabini's look of curiosity, waves away Parkinson's squawks of indignation, yanks the kitchen door open and Malfoy's right there.
At the tinge of pity in her expression, Draco suddenly feels embarrassed. He looks down at his half-eaten shepherd's pie. If anyone was observant enough to piece together his inconvenient and confusing crush — Salazar, he detests that term, as if he's a lovestruck teenager instead of the twenty-year-old that he is — on Potter, it would be Hermione.
This is one of the memories that Harry keeps particularly close to him, because that was the day that he fell hopelessly, irrevocably and madly in love with Draco. For Draco to quote from that day...
Potter smiles, something endearing and shy which makes Draco's heart pirouette in joy. "That's a story for another time, after you get to know me better." He traces the Cupid's bow of Draco's upper lip with a thumb, his whisper as intimate as the rustling of sheets. "We'll have loads of chances for that, yeah?"
He conveniently excludes his purpose for introducing the tart in the menu in the first place. Potter doesn’t have to know about that.
"I'm not a... a whore! You don't have to pay me to have me again. I was going to ask you out to lunch, but you'd probably pay me for that too, wouldn't you?!"
"I spent the past few days trying to work myself up to being your husband; seeing you with fresh eyes and thinking of you as my husband... and I..."
Harry hasn't seen this type of safe often in the field, but he knows that the only way to unlock it is with a seven-digit key-code. One wrong try with the key-code, and everything in the vicinity will blow sky-high. He can't do anything that would endanger the many lives in the club.
Ron pales when Harry confirms his guess. "You can't mean..." He gestures to the table. "Here? Where we eat every day?!”
Harry shoves his bowl away so hard that soup sloshes over the side, spilling on the table. He mutters an apology and waves his wand at it to clean up the mess.
His shoulders slumping, Harry scrubs at his face in frustration. As usual, Malfoy will be in the loo, brushing his teeth. And then he'll enter their dorms and drop off to sleep, while Harry will toss and turn, his mind consumed with Malfoy.
His grip tightening on Draco's palm, he pulls out, and with two quick strokes and his abdominal muscles clenching hard, he comes on the back of Draco's thighs, accompanied by a loud groan of Draco's name.
Malfoy plates up. Harry tucks into his food with gusto. Breakfast passes by fairly uneventfully and quickly, because they know they have to address the nature of their relationship. Malfoy wraps up breakfast by draining his glass of orange juice and indicating the sofa. Harry follows him there, his mind taking a dirty turn when he recalls this was where Malfoy sucked him off last night. He chases that memory away, because this is important, going by the uncertainty on Malfoy's features.
Although most of the students are in the air, with more accomplished fliers circling a small area of the pitch, Potter is also keeping a watchful eye on four first-years — three Gryffindors and one Slytherin (Leo Thompson) — who are kicking a ball around. They’re not divided into teams; they’re still familiarising themselves with running and passing the ball to each other.
His lips parting in desire, Draco leans forward for a better view of Potter; the messy scrawl of black hair, the scruff growing along his jaw and the top of his neck, the curve of his back and the stretch of his T-shirt over his shoulder blades. Dark-blue jeans, ripped at the knees, and black biker boots with the nice buckles—Draco's favourite pair on him—rounds up today's outfit.
"Oh fuck, Draco," Harry sighs, his words dissolving into a plaintive whine when Draco slides back into Harry's arse and continues thrusting. Before Harry can get too comfortable, however, he withdraws again to tease Harry's balls and kiss him at the same time. He alternates between both acts, varying the angle and speed of his thrusts to keep their orgasms at bay.
There’re some changes too: he now sports two leather bracelets, one black and one brown, on his left wrist, along with two piercings on his left earlobe. His skin is tanned, as though he has just returned from somewhere sunny.
"Wait," Malfoy says, peeling off his gloves, revealing his hands. A memory of last night barges into Harry’s mind: those fingers teasing him as he fell apart under Malfoy's skilful hands and cock. Warmth floods his face when Malfoy stretches across the counter to dip two fingers into the swirl of clotted cream. He licks the cream off his fingertips.
As always, Harry falls back to the dominant emotion associated with Malfoy — anger; anger at being lied to by Malfoy and his friends, Malfoy not bothering to explain his absence, worrying over him, Malfoy not being upfront about his feelings right from the start because this changes the entire fabric of their relationship... and this roaring, dangerous, frightening jealousy, surfacing like some ugly serpentine monster rising from the depths of the sea — Malfoy kissing old flames in Paris, those long capable fingers smearing chocolate all over tangled limbs in bed...
The black mamba starts to wind its way up Malfoy's legs, and Harry can feel the red snake do the same on his own body. Harry slowly stands, his hands trailing possessively all over Malfoy's calves, his arse, the planes of his back and all the way up to Malfoy's shoulders. Over Malfoy's right shoulder, Harry growls and bares his teeth
Harry wouldn’t be surprised if his colleagues are betting on this — he vaguely heard Pomona muttering something like
The dragon whines in distress and shakes its great head in confusion, its snout thrashing wildly in the air. It snorts and huffs, black puffs of powder whooshing from its nostrils and mouth.
Potter pauses, but his mouth is so tantalisingly close, and Draco can feel his traitorous body reacting to Potter’s proximity even though alarms are clanging at the back of his head; his hands reaching over to keep Potter close, his half-lidded eyes are trained entirely on Potter’s lips, his own breathing has sped up, mirroring Potter’s breaths.
“Well, you know Hedwig,” Harry starts, and grins when Hedwig ruffles her plumage, bends down to nuzzle Harry on the cheek and purrs in approval, as if to say, "
The back of Draco's legs hit the side of the bed, and they collapse in a heap on top of it. Potter looks fucking good: his healthy tanned glow, his flushed cheeks and inky scrawls of black hair a wonderful contrast to the white sheets. Potter flings an arm out and Draco crawls up, nestling into the crook of his shoulder.
Draco didn’t offer words of condolences or comfort, because he knew that whatever he said would do nothing to soothe the grief and pain swamping Weasley. And so, he had simply pulled a chair beside Weasley and sat with him as he cried in the dark.
"I lied. I'm sorry. I wanted to hurt you because I was angry and confused and..." Harry trails off and rubs the back of his neck sheepishly. "What you said was right."
Draco's senses are in free-fall: the sight of Harry making such a mess of himself, hearing all those filthy words coming from his mouth, the scent of sex; sweat and semen and their red-hot sexual chemistry burning up the sheets, the sensation of Harry clenching around his cock, along with the build-up from all the sex is enough to push Draco over the edge. With one mighty thrust, his cock is pulsing and he's wailing and coming and coming and
"Potter over here nicked this from my lab!" Malfoy snatches up the aforementioned Weasley's Wet Weather and brandishes it in front of George's face.
Marjorie looks to his right. “He’s coming this way, so why not ask him yourself?” She winks at him, and then turns to Malfoy. “Your usual?” she asks. He nods, pulling up a terse smile. Marjorie raises her eyebrows at him, before moving away.
If Harry had his way, they were supposed to be at his place right now tearing their clothes off in the throes of blazing passion, but nooo, he was waiting for Malfoy, who had simply said, "I'd like that very much, but I have to drop by Sin to get something first," so calmly as if Harry had suggested partaking in a spot of afternoon tea.
Malfoy cards his fingers through his messy hair in an attempt to tidy it. He runs a hand over his stubble, fingertips skimming over the dark circles under his eyes.
Harry quickly nudges away Inappropriate Malfoy Thoughts, Apparates them to Malfoy's front door and looks expectantly at Malfoy...
“Are you alright?” Potter asked, his eyes wide and mouth downturned in abject worry as he smoothed Draco’s hair back. “Merlin, I don’t know what Dumbledore was thinking, putting all of you here in the Lake. Malfoy,
The song ends, and Draco inclines his head at the applause. Harry doesn't move, except for his growing grin. Draco follows up with another unfamiliar song. Harry sits up straight when the lyrics describe a bloke with messy black hair and glasses, a smile as lovely as the stars, a laugh as bright as summer—
Salazar, he loves it whenever Potter murmurs his title in his deep, seductive voice. With each push of his hips, Potter thrusts up, trying to fuck him proper. Draco can’t bear it anymore, this is brilliant, but he aches to be fucked until he loses his mind. “Get up,” he orders. “Bend me over the table and plow me hard.”
He didn’t expect to tear the page in half and then launch into a sulk during a pleasant Sunday breakfast with Mother and Pansy.
Draco crosses his arms over his chest, his gaze darting, before he musters a weak sneer. "Are you going to save me, then? Like what you just did?"
"I prefer it like this," Malfoy says, tight-lipped. He turns up his collar and lowers his chin, hiding half of his face. He increases his pace, and Harry walks faster to keep up, careful to avoid stepping on the two people sleeping on the street below their flats. Malfoy jabs the button for the lift, and then frowns at Harry, as if his very presence is an affront. A tight knot of annoyance grows in the pit of Harry's stomach while they ride the lift in stony silence. Harry recalls Malfoy's bright laughter, and it rankles, knowing that his existence is enough to toss Malfoy into this smog of displeasure and agitation.
Minerva’s teacup pauses halfway to her lips, while Dumbledore grins at him, looking positively gleeful, for some strange reason. She sips on her tea, and Harry blinks at her when her lips twitch into a brief smile, before it vanishes as quickly as it appeared. She replaces her cup on the saucer and says carefully, “When you mean
Draco flounders for a moment. “Maybe. I thought he would do something, after all those gifts.” He huffs and pulls his tea closer. “Has he given up already? Just like that? What about Gryffindor stubbornness, chivalry, blind determination and pointless displays, eh?”
He thrusts, harder and faster, each stroke determined to hit Draco’s prostate, pulling his orgasm nearer to the surface. Draco gasps, his hands reaching above his head to clench the sides of the table. When Draco is close, Potter presses their chests together, not an inch of space between their bodies when he drives into him even deeper. He embraces Draco protectively, his elbows on the table and his hands cradling the back of Draco’s neck.
Draco inhales the herbal scent of Hermione’s shampoo and smiles. He's grateful for her company too; he's enjoyed their intellectual conversations about literature and magic. Although her knowledge in potions falls short of his, Hermione had given him very useful feedback (incorporating her experience in Herbology and Transmutation) about his potions manuscripts.
"I thought all I needed was time, but I was wrong. I would go to the places that I went with you, and I'd tell myself that you were here with me a while ago." He bites his lip in uncertainty, glancing at Harry. "Mona's was particularly bad. I wouldn't see you in the audience, I wouldn't walk home with you, I wouldn't…" He trails off, his chest sinking when he releases a loud sigh. "Everywhere I went, I thought of you. Wondered if you were thinking of me too."
Malfoy chuckles. "Nothing important. Don't worry, Potter." He drags his fingertips along Harry’s hardening cock. "He's not you."
"You're right. I don't," Harry says evenly. "I'm asking because he's someone important to you, and I care about you."
and Draco can't stop looking at the bulge and rubbing at it. Potter frantically unbuttons his jeans and he's about to pull his zipper down when Draco gets up.
"It's Harry and Malfoy, they've always had a bloody round-about way of doing things," Ron huffs and shovels another handful of popcorn in his mouth.
— as he deepens the kiss. Draco matches his snarl, shoving him back against the wall and kissing him hard. Potter’s other hand snakes downwards, slipping into a pocket at the back of Draco’s jeans to cup his arse.
Harry hasn’t done this in Parseltongue before, and he’s never used the language with anyone else besides Pork Chop. He’s never rattled off Parseltongue by himself — it’s always a conversation. He opens his mouth, and then closes it.
Harry fires off a particularly vicious stunning spell towards Malfoy's left ankle, the curse so potent that the air around its path shimmers. Malfoy barely has time to dodge and collect his wits to throw up a Shield Charm.
Hermione smiles. "See what I mean? He's still getting used to having you around. You were gone for a year, Harry, you can't expect things to pick up just like how you left it. He's confused about how to act around you, curious about what happened to you—"
The ramrod tightness of Draco’s body slowly uncoils, and he begins to lay out each item from the box. This jumble of things means nothing to anyone else, but they mean the world to Draco. "I took these before I last left the Manor," he says. He doesn't look at Potter as he talks, not wanting to see the pity in his face. It's easier like this, as if Draco is spilling his memories to an empty room.
"It's four in the afternoon, you knob," Draco points out, gently pushing him back to bed. "You'll be on bed rest for the next few days, until Poppy says otherwise.”
Draco emerges from the shower, and as he dresses, he eyes the drawer where the mag is waiting for him. He’ll indulge in a nice, slow wank with it before bed tonight, and try his best to ignore the fact that the object of his affections is a mere fifteen minute walk away.
Harry's never seen Malfoy out of control like this before — blond hair all over the place, cheeks flushed, gasping voice chanting Harry's name like a prayer between cries and whines, hands fisting into Harry's fresh sheets that he'd changed just this morning solely to get fucked like this-
"Book club?" Weasley remarks in distaste. "Bloody hell, Nott, you'd probably get on brilliantly with Hermione."
“Tell me when it hurts,” Potter mutters, pushing in. Desire and anticipation burns in Draco’s blood like a liquid inferno — it’s finally happening, after so many months of unbridled lust — when the head of Potter’s cock slips in easily; the reward of his patient prep. Draco rolls his hips in tiny circles in encouragement, groaning when he sinks in deeper, continuing his slow, slick slide into Draco, and
Harry doesn't know how long he's been standing there in rapture, drinking in the sight of Draco like a castaway in the desert gulping down water.
"Stripper auditions! It's gonna be a great show," Jacob grins, then lowers his voice. "Just between you and me, there's one of 'em worth watching — tall with messy black hair, gorgeous blue eyes, amazing body. I could just lick ice-cream off his abs, ya know what I mean? I can't really remember his name, one of those single-syllable names, I think. We've all got our eye on him."
"He was mumbling something about my hair again the next day, whether I did anything to it." Draco takes a deep breath, pausing for dramatic effect. "I've worn the same bloody hairstyle for years!"
"Are you finished with travelling, then? You're always haring off to the next adventure, the next exotic locale," Malfoy says.
"Can't be. They don't act like a couple, even though they look rather matching together. Well, speak of the devil," Jacob says, his eyes flickering to the door. Harry twists around in his seat to look.
as he chucked things around in the display counter, accidentally smacking the poor Transfigured lion in the bum with a wayward sugar muffin.
And that's why George will never tell Malfoy that he saw him on that rainy day of Fred's funeral at the Burrow, standing at the back with his head bowed and a black hood covering his blond hair.
Harry flinches, the words like a slap to the face. He's tempted to shout back, but he swallows the furious words, simmering so close to the surface. Instead, his voice is subdued, his eyes sad and tired, arms hanging at the sides.
They're at the westernmost point of mainland Europe. It's evening, late enough for the hordes of tourists to have left, but not too late for Harry and Draco to enjoy the scenery. The frothy waves of the North Atlantic Ocean churn and surge against the cliffs, and Harry sighs at the breath-taking view of ocean and sky.
"I think you're right," Harry agrees, grinning at Teddy. "We’ll be back in an hour or so," he says, pulling on his jacket and helping Teddy with his coat. They exit the bakery, and Hermione watches as they turn the corner.
“Yes,” Draco says. “Sleep evades me, on some nights.” He excludes mentioning his occasional nightmares.
Draco pushes the dossier away, pulls his laptop towards him and retrieves a piece that he started writing last night. He skims the beginning and types out a new paragraph, relishing the busy taps of the keys under his fingertips. He learnt to work Muggle-style from Casey Smith, a Muggle-born colleague from the
He can't stop looking at Draco's wonderful face, scanning every plane and hollow with his eyes, absorbing the changes that the last year has brought: Draco's hair is now shorter compared to Christmas, barely two months ago. His trimmed hair reveals a silver dragon earring studded on his left earlobe, which makes him even sexier than ever.
Theo rattles the answers off. "No, Draco's not seeing anyone. He's got a wicked sweet tooth, I'm sure you recall the sweets that his mother sent him during school. He has a penchant for all things chocolate, but he detests white chocolate and raisins. In terms of compliments..." He pauses. "I cannot be certain, since I don't look at him in that way, but the last bloke he was with, Nicholas, I think... I've heard him compliment Draco’s eyes before."
"Sure," she says, brushing away his usual concerns at her voyeuristic tendencies. "It would do the both of you well to make him your mate," she declares, and then slithers back to her basket, curling up for her usual nap before her hunting session.
Draco places his hands over Potter's, stilling him. He cradles Potter's face with both palms and rubs his thumbs over his cheeks.
It takes every fibre of Harry's control and respect to reply in the negative; he's not desperate enough to snatch it from the Head Auror. "Er... no, sir. I've already had it," he lies through his teeth, looking miserably after Robards as he leaves with his beloved treacle tart. Harry whirls back to Malfoy, raging at the injustice of it all.
"Potter," Malfoy snarls, his grey eyes narrowed with an intensity that Harry has not seen in a very long time. Just seeing that expression on Malfoy's face ignites something deep within Harry, but he doesn't have time to dissect his feelings before that intensity melts.
Malfoy shakes his head. "No. I bought it from the burger bar that we went with the others that night. I...
Malfoy chuckles, winks and then turns away. He pads over to Harry’s bathroom for his usual shower. Harry isn't especially particular — a quick wipe-down and a decent Cleaning charm is enough (which is what he does now), but Malfoy always prefers a quick shower. Harry isn't complaining, he loves how Malfoy smells of his own soap after he uses his bath.
Even under his briefs, Potter's prick looks fucking fabulous, Draco can't wait to find out how it really looks. Potter cants his hips upwards, but Draco pouts and shakes his head, his lips hooking up into a rich, artful smile.
Something tightens in the pit of Harry's belly — the coiling of a nervous, exhilarating energy that is all too familiar — like the sensation right before he dives fast and hard into a Wronski Feint.
. He stretches, wincing at the pops of his spine and the perpetual ache in his lower back from sitting for so long. He bins the takeaway containers, packs up his paints, and exits his studio in Grimmauld Place.
"Then don't," Draco growls, the streak of possessiveness and lust racing through him so strong that he's taken aback by surprise. He pounces on Potter, kissing him all over again.
He swallows Draco's moans of pleasure as he continues to work his fingers in and out, keeping up a steady tempo. Eventually, Draco wraps up the kiss by placing his palms firmly on Harry's shoulders and pushing him away. Harry pulls his fingers out and sits back on the balls of his feet, eyes widening when Draco smirks and gets into position on all fours.
had leapt out at Harry. Good Godric, are they selling pastries or sex? The article had speculated about the identity of the chocolatier behind Sin — since the reviewer had mentioned Parkinson and Zabini by name, the mystery chocolatier had to be Malfoy. With narrowed eyes, Harry re-read the praise that was heaped all over Sin and
...which had gone to utter shit when he read a glowing review of Sin in the paper that weekend. Words like
He opens an envelope and up-ends it. Out tumbles a stack of Polaroids with captions in Draco's handwriting. There had been a phase when Draco went mad about Muggle photography — Polaroids in particular. Harry's grin widens as he thumbs through the Polaroids, most of which Draco had showed him before.
They stay like that for a while, silent and basking in each other's presence. Eventually, Potter takes Draco's hand in his. Draco smiles dreamily and wraps his arms around Potter's waist, resting his cheek on his chest.
“More fucking, less talking,” Malfoy orders. Harry is more than happy to comply. He fucks him in earnest, his strokes long, deep and sure. He’s close, he’s embarrassingly close, he has to last, Christ, he’s not eighteen anymore,
It's halfway into the night when Hermione catches Draco's eye and indicates the bartender’s counter. They head there to get the next round. After they place their orders, they linger at the bar, observing the raucous group from a distance.
Indignant, Draco sits up straight and scowls. “I don’t see what’s so funny about that. I’ll have you know that Humphrey is a proper, dignified name befitting of a Malfoy owl of Humphrey’s lineage.”
Draco grabs his hips and drives Potter's pulsing cock deeper down his throat, and Draco fucking takes it, takes every thrust and inch and
Harry doesn’t need to think twice. "It's when I'm fucking you hard into the bed, fucking you so good that you forget your name," he says, punctuating his words with a squeeze of Malfoy’s arse.
had to be wearing the tightest leather pants that he owned and bending over at every possible moment to give Potter a nice long look at his arse.
Draco sits bolt upright, ignoring the soreness in his upper arms and thighs. Disbelief judders him fully awake. How could Harry have left like this? Yesterday night had been—
"We're on the highest floor in the most expensive hotel in London. Let's not waste the view, shall we?" Draco purrs and leads Potter to the balcony. The night-time scenery is magnificent: towering skyscrapers lighting up the horizon — he can even see the London Eye in the distance. There's the faint honk of traffic; oh yes, London is beautiful and lively at night, but there's something even more wonderful in front of him: Harry Potter leaning against the barricade of the balcony, his legs apart and his jutting erection just begging to be licked.
"Didn't wanna hurt you, will never hurt you again," Draco babbles, his hips setting a steady pace. "I know you can take it now, you're so good at taking it, so damn good... does it feel good for you too?"
It’s two weeks into term, and Draco’s watching the flying lesson for the first-year Slytherin and Gryffindor students. He always makes it a point to attend every year if he’s not teaching, keen on assessing each cohort. Slytherin won the Quidditch Cup for the past two years, much to Charlie’s dismay, and Draco is eager to see their winning streak continue.
Harry is scruffier than usual; there is the beginning of a beard growing along the strong line of his jaw, going all the way down to his Adam's apple. His lips are chapped and his skin is so pale. He looks thinner underneath his plain black T-shirt, but he still has those broad set of shoulders and biceps that always drove Draco wild. A dusty brown duffel bag slips from Harry's grasp and thumps to the floor.
He's about to close the cabinet when he spies a sealed, full bottle of Draught of Living Death, tucked away at the back. Scowling, Harry pockets it. He hurries back to Draco, helps him to a sitting position on the bed, and then trickles the thin, golden potion into his mouth. "Come on," Harry mutters, staring at his gulping throat.
"By the way, my hair's natural, no product needed," Malfoy says, his lips curving up into a cocky grin. With another heated look at Harry, he turns and saunters back to the kitchen, with a spring in his step that wasn't there before.
“Er…” Harry hedges, jamming his hands into the pockets of his jeans. “We’re not together anymore. We didn't last a month after Hogwarts."
Malfoy darts forward in a smooth, fluid motion, swinging his legs around Harry and making himself comfortable in his lap. There's a dull thunk behind Malfoy, and they both glance at the sound. Harry's bottle has tipped over on the table and rolled onto the ground, spilling Firewhisky on Malfoy's expensive-looking carpet.
"Please, Harry, please," Draco begs. He wants those plump lips and that wicked tongue wrapped around his cock-
Right, that’s it. He doesn’t want to over-think things any further. He’s twenty-two, for Merlin’s sake, he can certainly handle going up to someone and complimenting his singing. Harry stands up, wipes his palms on the thighs of his jeans and tries to pat his hair flat, although it’s a lost cause. His hand is on the doorknob when the man speaks, and he presses his ear to the wall. The one-sided conversation tells Harry that he’s on the phone.
And then Harry had wriggled in bed, opened those gorgeous green eyes, blinked up at him and enveloped him in a very real, very sweet good morning kiss. They had a leisurely breakfast and then went in to work. The minute Draco stepped into Sin, two hours later than his usual time, Pansy's sharp-as-switchblades eyes had swivelled to him and swept him with an appraising gaze.
it," Malfoy grinds his hips downwards, and Harry's sure that Malfoy can feel his own hardening cock.
“It’s his birthday, Harry, and you can’t even spare two hours for him? We haven’t seen you and Ron in ages—“ Hermione stops when Draco appears, stony-faced. “He’s here, and he looks like he knows. Tell him yourself.” She moves away, giving Draco ample space to confront Harry.
Harry’s expecting to see a single slice of fresh treacle tart, but on top of that, Malfoy's given him a sampling platter of Sin's wares: dainty white chocolate pralines drizzled with dark chocolate; macarons with delicate shells sandwiching luscious chocolate filling; a single molten chocolate fairy cake topped with gleaming vanilla frosting; gooey walnut brownies with browned marshmallows; and lastly, a pair of lush strawberries dipped in rich milk chocolate.
"On anything I'd like, huh?" Harry says thoughtfully, holding the jar up to the light and turning it in his fingers.
"Are you free this Saturday night?! I would like to take you to Hogsmeade! There's a new place that does a brilliant steak, according to Ron!"
"Yes. Pansy helped me." Draco smiles, trying to lighten the mood. "She's already not my artist. To have her not be involved with the design? She'll skin me alive."
"Alright. I'll stay in Lisbon. I'll wait for you for as long as I can. You’ve never told me how you truly feel about me, but all I know is that…" Harry’s pulse speeds, and he gulps audibly, hoping that he isn’t going too far. "Is that I can't change how… how I love you."
Harry really wants to recapture the moment that was so abruptly wrenched away, but it’s well and truly gone. Nearby, a girl yelps when a particularly strong breeze lifts her skirt up, and Harry quickly averts his gaze.
He's not going to tease, because he can't wait a second longer. With Potter's hand on the back of his head, Draco swallows his cock bit by bit, his jaw working to take more of Potter. His tongue swirls around the head, enveloping Potter in his velvety heat. It's not long before Potter loses control and starts to fuck his mouth, hips juddering and thighs clenching, and Draco fucking takes it because this is all he's ever wanted, it's all he's ever thought of, alone in bed and wanking to this very fantasy, this very desire of sucking Potter 'till he's incoherent and gasping and crying out Draco's name, his cries lost in the night sky.
?" He pales. "It was difficult enough telling your parents that we were going out! Wait, how about..." He brightens. "How about you propose to me instead?"
Father walked stiffly towards them and held out a bottle of finest elf-made wine from the Malfoy cellars. The strappy kitten heels on Mother's feet clicked on the floor as she reached both Harry and Draco. Draco bent down to kiss her cheek and Harry greeted her with a cheerful hello.
“Play with my arse,” Malfoy says. He sinks down on his elbows and swallows Harry again, sucking harder and faster, his moans around Harry’s cock spurring his arousal to new heights.
“What are you doing here? Are you looking for me?” Malfoy snaps, his eyes round with panic and his gaze darting all over the place, as if looking for an exit.
"I can't dance!" Harry protests, and it's true. Even though he does frequent clubs, he never tries to dance, knowing that he'll probably look like a floppy wet fish. "Just give me something else. How about a... a book-keeper?!"
Draco smiles. "I like what I see." His smile dims slightly. "But I'm not ready for it either. I don't think we're ready for such a big step forward." He squeezes Harry's hand and flashes a cheeky grin. "
"I have calming potions at home—" Draco says. Molly nods and crouches down to fold Hermione up in a hug, murmuring into her hair. Hermione clings to her and continues to sob and mumble.
Three sharp raps on his door, and then Potter bursts into his lab like an over-excited Crup, complete with a cheery greeting and an electric grin that makes Draco's heart thud with longing.
"She's doing very well, thank you for asking." Draco rummages in his knapsack, pulling out two tins of biscuits. "Here you go."
Potter throws him one last lingering look, before turning around to give him some privacy as Draco rinses off, dries himself and pulls on his clothes. He’s close to the door before Potter’s voice stops him in his tracks.
." Draco knows he's clutching at straws, but when you've fancied someone for so long and with such intensity... He flushes when he recalls how Potter had seen him dance to Led Zeppelin and his throwaway sentence about the band right before he left. The entire incident was highly embarrassing and rather surreal, but that was the first time that they had a civil conversation, and he had gone to bed feeling rather pleased that night.
quickly," Jacob says. Normally, Harry would have questioned Jacob further about his last comment, but Harry's brain isn't working normally because he's turned his attention back to Malfoy, who's sliding a palm down the left side of his waist, thumb and forefinger pinching the top of his black briefs, pushing them down just a few inches, and if Harry manages to snatch a peek of Malfoy’s cock...
— a grimace which morphs into a wide barracuda smile as his finger slips lower to trace Harry Potter's name.
After twenty minutes, Draco places the last word on the parchment with a flourish and stretches his arms above his head, wincing when his spine creaks. Sighing with satisfaction at a job well done, Draco basks in his efficiency for a moment before glancing at the tape recorder, his face breaking into an electric smile when he thinks of Harry. He packs up his work paraphernalia as usual: parchment stacked neatly, reference books stowed away on the shelves, quills arranged according to size and files arranged according to priority.
Harry licks his lips in anticipation as he pushes himself up from the cold floor opposite the classroom door, his eyes locked onto a rapidly-advancing Malfoy. Grey smoulders on green when Malfoy strides over to him, ripping off the
It’s barely twenty minutes into their first conversation in years, and Harry’s playing this game again: giving light-hearted compliments that maintain this thread of playful attraction thrumming between them. Initially, Draco hadn’t been sure about the best way to react, but he eventually figured it out — to beat Harry at his own game. It’s even more thrilling now since they’re both single. Harry is probably as straight as a wand (but with a penchant for a bit of harmless flirtation with Draco), but Draco’s grown up pushing Harry’s buttons, and he sees no reason to stop now.
Harry kept the Central Park painting as it was — rain, dark colours and all. He drew Draco alone and sitting under a large tree, tinkering half-heartedly with his guitar. For the Brooklyn Bridge painting, the blazing lights of downtown Manhattan accompany the swathes of orange and pink at sunset; but the focus is on Draco staring at the skyline, his ice-cream cone melting in his hands and dripping down to the lovers’ locks below.
"You're two grown men who’ve been acting like pygmy puffs! Go out for dinner, a drink, or even a shag if that's what you want. Just sort it out, alright?" he says, jabbing at them with a finger. He exhales heavily and leaves the scene, not to return to his office, but to visit the Extendable Ears aisle and grab one for his own use.
A gasp wrenches from Harry's throat when the darkness of Draco's hair slowly melts away, like shadows chased away by the light of dawn, revealing striking blond strands.
No one else would have understood the conversation, but that's what they did — talk in riddles wrung from roses that only
even. That quality is rare to find in someone with a body like yours." Malfoy drops his voice. "I find that especially...
Despite the sudden jealousy, Draco snickers at the thought of Potter kissing a man in broad daylight just to prove a point. "I'm sure Pansy had a good laugh about that."
"Have you never tidied this place?" Draco howls in horror, flinging himself to the side and narrowly missing a petticoat to his face.
Draco doesn't need to reply; he's sure the skitter of his eyes to the side has answered the question well enough.
Particular places in Hogwarts remind Harry of Malfoy as he walked through the school with his friends every day — a handful of classrooms that they used for their rendezvous; a stretch of wall familiar to Harry because Malfoy had pushed him up against it, his face pressed onto the cold stone and glasses digging into his skin while Malfoy's hands skated up and down Harry's back before pushing Harry's hair (he'd grown it out a bit longer this year because he loves how Malfoy cards his fingers through his hair) away from the back of his neck to suck at his skin.
"Yeah, was thinking about... um. Your treacle tart," Harry hedges, refusing to meet Draco's curious gaze.
“No, stop. Stop,” Potter says, pushing Draco’s hand away and turning him around. “You’re gonna come only when I’m in you again. Still so horny and desperate for you. Give me a while, yeah?”
"We're so close to breaking the case, Harry. That's what I'm gonna do this Christmas, so that we spend next Christmas with them," Ron says, renewed purpose and determination burning in his eyes. He stands up, dusts off his jeans and offers a hand to Harry. "Are you with me?"
"Let me buy you a drink," Harry offers, words spilling out of his mouth in a hurried tumble. Anything, anything to stop them dancing, because Harry was at the verge of losing whatever little self-control he had left. "You cleared me for the auditions, and I probably owe you another one too, for throwing my shirt at you."
Harry Potter's glasses!" Malfoy calls. Harry's glasses jump off his face, and his world is thrown into a confusing blur of shapes and colours, but he doesn't panic. Without missing a beat, he grips his wand and casts a formidable summoning spell in the general vicinity. His glasses zoom back into his outstretched palm, and he quickly puts them on. Summoning his glasses is second nature, drilled into him by Robards.
But his mind is already scampering away to the possibility of stopping the proceedings before Malfoy truly and irreversibly commits himself to a lie of a marriage that is entirely one-sided on Greengrass' part.
Draco smiles at the sketch, and then he laughs, a bright and beautiful sound. "My nose looks weird."
"Let me take you to a holiday in France for your birthday," Draco says, surprisingly nervous. He thought about it last night while Potter was snoring away. He hasn’t proposed anything like this to his previous lovers (which weren't that many, to be honest). He reckons their travelling styles would be rather different — Potter is definitely the outdoors type and keen on everything, while Draco prefers to stay inside in a good cafe or a museum.
"That's enough, Pansy," Draco drawls and promptly shoos a snickering Pansy away. Potter gets up, and they're soon out of the dungeons.
Draco is a more than decent cook, while Harry isn't, because he didn't see the point, having spent the past few years hopping from hotel to rented flat. Draco's favourite dish to cook is carbonara, but he learnt how to make a mean curry simply because Harry likes it. Draco loves English breakfast tea, served piping hot with a splash of milk and no sugar, and his favourite colour is red.
Harry slouches a bit so Draco can rest his chin on his head. Draco hums appreciatively at the panoramic scenery and holds him tighter. Harry is standing in front of him, nestled in the protective circle of Draco’s arms.
Draco stops humming. His smile of contentment fades, and something closes up in his face. He stills, the water from the tap flowing over his motionless hands.
Malfoy thumbs through the pictures, nodding when Harry explains the story and inspiration behind each painting. Malfoy pauses at a snow-laden Christmas piece of Diagon Alley. "This must be Pansy's favourite," he says.
Pork Chop hisses and slides off his chest. Draco props him to a sitting position, and hands him the glass. Potter drinks deeply from it.
He looks at the serving line, his eyes narrowing in determination when he spots a flash of a blond head, now visible because of the shorter queue. He presses his lips together, annoyed at the thought of Malfoy withholding his dessert.
At the mention of his job, Draco's heart dips at the reminder that he won't be staying in London for long. He'll miss Pansy, and he'll be lying if he said he wouldn't miss Potter. He's not sure what's brewing between them, with Potter's loaded smiles and the occasional flirtatious words. Sometimes, Potter acts as if he reciprocates Draco's affections, but the cynic in Draco sighs in resignation—people like Potter the Saviour aren’t interested in Death Eaters.
“I just wanted to spend some time with you on my birthday. I should have known that even that would be too much to ask,” Draco says, his voice flat. “Take care of yourself.”
Draco watches in amusement as Hedwig flies to Errol, spreading a protective wing over him as he recovers.
They've got so much baggage between them that it could fill up an airport — all their childish schoolyard fights and their blood-stained history wedged between them like a third shadow — and it seems impossible to craft a relationship out of this, but-
"Okay," Draco whispers, his voice breaking on the word. He kisses the back of Harry’s hand. "Okay," he says again, softer.
The crowd is quieter, waiting and watching to see how Harry would deal with having a snake twisting itself all over his body. Would this challenge mess up an otherwise-perfect audition?
The arrival of their food jolts Draco back to reality, and they tuck in. Potter eagerly prods his fork into his baked potato, gathering equal amounts of potato, melted cheese, sour cream and bacon bits. He chews, and then happily declares, “Best baked potato I’ve ever eaten.”
The door to Skinshifters opens, revealing Potter. The hood of his jumper covers his mop of hair and his hands are shielding something from the drizzle outside. He shrugs the hood off, runs a hand through his hair and walks to Draco, who perks up when he notices that Potter comes bearing coffee from Magnolia's, his favourite cafe a few streets away.
"Why does it spark joy?" Draco asks. He's never seen Potter wear it before, and he wonders if it has some sort of sentimental value.
“You’re in my lunchroom now, Potter. Know your place,” he hisses. Potter’s eyes flare with a combative fire that Draco knows all too well. With both hands, he grabs the bottom of Potter’s jacket — this fucking sexy black leather jacket that he looks so dangerous in, Salazar, just looking at him in this is enough to make Draco hard — and uses that to yank Potter towards him. Potter lurches forward as Draco walks backwards.
Harry looks at him in dismay, another apology on the tip of his tongue. It’s troubling when Draco’s like this — avoiding the issue and distracting Harry from talking about it. But there’s nothing else he can do except play along for now.
it's his mother, I offer to help and he throws it back in my face," Harry rages to a highly-amused Bacon as he fills the kettle up and bangs it on the stove. He reaches for a box of tea-bags, closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. But it's not working, because it's
"Oh, I can definitely see what I'm doing to you," Potter says around a grin. He slides two fingers in the space between Draco's erection and stomach, nudges it towards himself just a bit and lets go.
It's a snippet from a Muggle newspaper displaying the timings of a particular movie shown in a London cinema.
"Thanks—" Potter starts, but he's interrupted by Draco, who had worked up a good head of steam in the process.
Draco doesn't know whether to bang his forehead on his own briefcase in frustration or curl up into a dramatic ball on the floor at harbouring feelings for someone who is so stubborn, infuriating and
Harry finishes his coffee, and bins his sandwich wrapper and paper cup. He waits until the last possible moment, and then gets up, hoisting the strap of his bag over his shoulder. With a piece of his heart left behind, Harry enters room fifteen to take the Portkey that will take him home.
They stop at a pedestrian crossing, and Harry looks up at the name of the road. “Avenue B,” he says, snorting. “And here I was, thinking that the avenues only ended with numbers. It just makes things even more difficult.” He got lost on his way to Mona’s — despite the grid-like layout of the city, things still get pretty damn confusing sometimes, especially with the dizzying swarms of people and traffic. Everything is louder and more disorienting than in London.
"Yes, Potter?" Malfoy says, his voice low. Harry’s gaze rises to his face, confused by the softness of his expression. The spell is broken when a pair of witches — he doesn't know them by name, but he’s seen them with Malfoy sometimes — pass by, and he catches a strain of their conversation as they gush about the tart.
They’ve danced around the line in the sand, toeing it and tempting fate, but tonight, they’ve finally crossed it.
Draco slumps into their bedroom, shuts the door behind him to drown out the mayhem of the party, tips his head back and sloshes the entire glass of Firewhiskey down his throat. Wincing at the strong burn of alcohol, he thumps the glass on the bedside table and collapses in bed, limbs sprawled all over the sheets like a starfish.
The last time Draco was here a month ago, he’d been safe in the knowledge that Harry was still alive.
Potter noses into the crook of Draco’s neck, rutting wildly against his thigh, the rubbing of that slick cock against his skin ramping up Draco’s lust. “I’ll make you come like just now,” Potter pants into his heated skin between desperate kisses. “Just let me, I
Harry laughs, smoothing over the previous tension in the air. His eyes dart from corner to corner, and he scoots away to another garden. "It's beautiful." He steps back, tilts his camera up, and takes another photo, this time capturing the nondescript and blandly coloured buildings flanking the High Line, which is such a stark departure from the riot of colours and nature of the urban park.
"We're all clean now," Harry finally whispers. They glance at the open door of the bathroom. When they leave the bathroom, it'll be time for bed, and after dawn...
Harry stifles a sigh. "No. This is Arthur Weasley's." He chucks the offending duck somewhere to the side and turns back to Malfoy.
Draco nods. If only he could whisk Potter to France with him. "I promise I’ll write. I'll see you in two weeks, here in London."
Potter's voice gentles. "But I won't be leaving anyone's flat at night." He moves nearer to Draco, looking into grey, troubled eyes. "When I say you're the only one, I mean it. We have to deal with this. I don't want this to be a problem we sweep under the rug.” He reaches out, interlacing their fingers, and Draco holds on tight. “I'm not gonna hide you away like some dirty little secret. No, I'm not ashamed of you, far from that. I'll tell everyone I'm taken already, taken by a drop-dead gorgeous blond who is more than I can handle, who is too damn jealous for his own good." A faint smile softens the sting of his words. "Stay with me in London at the start of summer hols. Don't go back to France yet. Let the media take photos of us, show the whole world we're together."
Draco hesitates, his finger pausing on Potter's skin and his eyes still on the ink. "Tattoos are permanent. If you do that, it means we're permanent, and I don't know—" He looks up when Potter steps away.
"What d'you wanna do here?" he asks, fixing Draco with an expectant look. "I'm not familiar with wizarding Paris, but I'm sure we can figure something out if you wanna go there. Is there a particular reason you chose Paris?"
Hurt cuts through Draco, and he shakes his head, trying to chase away the memories of tabloids showing Potter with someone else, or worse, sneaking out of some bloke's house. He hates how right Potter is, hates how silly his own insecurities are, because nothing has happened for him to doubt Potter like this. The thought of losing Potter brings out the worst of him, and it doesn’t help that he’s used to having an eye on the exit sign in every relationship.
Harry is not prepared for this assault of Malfoy-related memories and emotions. It's as if his mind is working on rewind — Malfoy's pale, drawn face during the Trials; his screams echoing in Harry's ear as Fiendfyre licks their heels; Harry's own hands coming away with Malfoy's blood, which trickles down and mixes with the water on the bathroom floor... and so many more...
Malfoy goes very still, before spinning on his heel, his features schooled into a mask of aloof detachment. His brows draw together in a quick frown, and he greets Harry coolly. Harry’s smile fades, and he suddenly feels very wrong-footed. He moves closer to Malfoy. “How were your holidays?” he asks, plodding on, despite Malfoy’s crossed arms and stony stare.
When he’s finished towelling himself off, a grinning Potter unrolls a thick mat and plops it on the ground, before collapsing onto it, his limbs sprawled out like a happy starfish.
bed," Harry growls; a growl so thoroughly filthy and possessive that it sends a shiver rippling down Draco's spine. "In my bed sleeping, God, you look so good... so worn out after sex with
"Hah, you wish." Draco counts them off his fingers, eager to prove him wrong. "If it's a cold day, you’d fancy a stew or a chowder. If you come for lunch after a field mission, and I know this because of the stains on your clothes and how tired you look, you'd order double potatoes, a starchy main, and a huge mug of coffee. However, if you're leaving for the field, you'd take less carbohydrates and more proteins, probably a salmon or roast chicken, along with some fruit or an energy bar to go. If you're having a bad day, probably too much paperwork piling up, you'd be more tempted by sugar, going for double desserts or a sweet drink like juices."
That’s the marked difference between Potter and him — Potter works best going with the flow, while Draco is the complete opposite.
"Lose me?” A scathing, familiar drawl creeps into Draco’s words. “When did you ever have me, Potter?”
"The thread might stretch. It might tangle. But it will never break," he continues, his heart pounding. "When I heard about this story, I instantly thought of you."
"He's been saying things are piling up at home, and I suggested you. He considered it for a bit. Do you know his address?"
Draco returns Potter's smirk with one of his own. Draco's cock is already half-hard and twitching as he lifts his legs up and slides his arms under the back of his knees, holding his legs wide open in a W.
He's wearing the same leather pants as before and he's drinking the same green cherry drink as before.
In time with the music, Draco bends over and pulls his briefs down for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it second.
And when he turns and runs away from the bridge, leaving Draco in a heap on the ground holding the pieces of Harry’s shattered heart, Harry wonders if this is what heartbreak in honeymoons feels like.
He smiles at Malfoy’s frustrated snarl, and pokes his head out, peering around Rowena Ravenclaw's ample bosom and ransacking his mind for Snape's counter-curse to Malfoy's next spell.
During the past two years (Charlie joined the faculty a year after Draco), Draco has grown to be rather fond of him. Things started out awkward and stiff between them, but it gradually developed into acquaintanceship, and finally, friendship. Also, as far as Weasleys went, Charlie is probably the best one out of the lot — Draco had the least contact with him.
Draco can’t stay here anymore; they’ve said things to each other, things that they can never take back. Staying here would just prolong the fight. He hurries to the closet and Summons his bag. He flings open the drawers and starts to hurl clothes into the bag. When he’s finished, he grabs his notes off his bedside dresser and crams them on top of his clothes.
He bangs the tray of buttermilk scones on the counter harder than necessary, startling the customers at the till. Hermione and Ron, seated a short distance away, glance up at the jarring sound just in time to see him turn a baleful glare across the road.
Malfoy nods, his fingers tracing the curves of the crust as he continues turning the tray. “I did mention that it’s baked in-house.”
He gestures to the box with an unsteady hand. "They don't spark joy. Certainly not. Instead, they make me sad, bittersweet. They remind me of the love I've lost. Should I throw them out?" He shakes his head, his words increasing in certainty. "No. Of course not. I salvaged these from the..." Draco's breath hitches. "The Manor, because they mean the most. Each item reminds me of the best of them. I remember them as my friend, my family, not by their faults, not how they were vilified by the media and immortalised in textbooks as war villains."
"He's been acting off the past couple of days," Draco says. "He's started complimenting me and yesterday, he told me he liked my shirt, makes my arms look
“At long last love has arrived, and I thank God I’m alive,” Malfoy sings, grey eyes sweeping across the room…
Draco's heart flips over like a pancake, and he can't help the soppy grin spreading on his face. He ducks his head to hide his smile. Potter's favourite blue Converse sneakers — Draco wrinkles his nose at the smudges of dirt and the uneven length of Potter's mismatched shoelaces — keep pace with his own polished Italian leather shoes as they stroll towards Hogsmeade.
Pork Chop lifts her upper half as high as possible, and slithers to Charlie’s side, leaving Draco to handle Potter. He’s lucky that Charlie’s not as far gone as Potter — when Charlie minces off the path, a hard nudge and a guiding coil of Pork Chop’s tail is enough to steer him proper. They manage a short distance before Potter stops and sways alarmingly on the spot, before collapsing into Draco’s arms. He melts into one of those stupid, adorable grins, which does funny things to Draco’s equally stupid heart.
Mother's recipe for jammy dodgers goes first. Draco unfurls the delicate parchment, which is curling at the sides and yellowed with age. At the sight of Mother's handwriting, he's reminded of her letters when he was at Hogwarts, accompanied by a basket of her home-made jammy dodgers. "Yes, she was the Lady of the Manor with our army of house elves, but she always baked these herself because they were my favourite. When I was young, these biscuits would be enough to lure me out of the library."
"Just go!" Malfoy snaps, his face twisting into a familiar sneer and flashing eyes. Harry steps back, feeling slighted.
Malfoy smoulders up at him. "Yes, give it to me. Give it to me good." He clings onto Harry, pulling him down until Harry's face is buried in Malfoy's neck, his forehead on the pillow. "Day after you left. After you fucked me," Malfoy manages, every other word punctuated with a gasp of pleasure. "Ached the next morning. When I sat, when I walked fast." He sucks in a rattling breath, and Harry slows down until he’s buried balls-deep inside him, throbbing and still. Harry raises himself up and looks at Malfoy.
“See you back in the office,” Theo says. He tucks his book under his arm, picks up his plate, and then leaves.
The last item is a photograph of the Slytherins outside Honeydukes during their third year. Draco's at the front, flanked by Vince and Greg. Pansy, Millicent, Theo and Blaise are grinning and waving their bags of sweets in the air. Grey eyes linger on Pansy's smile, and if Draco concentrates hard enough, he can almost hear her laughter.
"Ah.” Malfoy grimaces, clenching around Harry. "Ah," he says again, this time with feeling. He grits his teeth, fists his hands and scrunches his eyes shut. Harry looks down; Malfoy’s erection is flagging.
Charlie laughs in astonishment. "No, he certainly doesn’t hate you. He's more relaxed this term, not snapping at his students as much, and he's even smiling more than usual. Heard the students talking about him, asking what's happened over summer hols for this change." He raises an eyebrow. "Won't be surprised if it's because of you."
Potter snarls back and shakes a fist before settling back down on the couch and taking a long swig of his beer.
The door of the pub swings open, revealing Neville and Pansy Parkinson. Harry can't help himself; he sits up straight and looks at the door, hope flaring in him for a glimpse of a blond head and stormy grey eyes.
"I..." Draco starts. In fact, he had heard about Paris from Pansy, who had been raving about the historical attractions and fashion districts in wizarding Paris. Since Harry isn't comfortable in the wizarding area, he wouldn’t mind skipping that today. Besides, he's curious of the places that Harry visits when he's here.
Harry goes to him, unsure of what to do. Perhaps Draco wants a lie-in today. It'd be rather rude to wake him up, if that's the case. Harry is about to leave, when he spots two identical and empty potion bottles on the nightstand. The labels might be torn off, but he's familiar with the shape of the vials.
Potter obeys, his thrusts slow as he rocks gently into Draco, his thumbs pressing into Draco’s flesh to spread him open while he steadily fucks into him. It doesn’t take long before the pain morphs into the heady beginnings of pleasure. Every hard thrust knocks Draco’s breath out of him, and the upper half of his body flops down to the bed. He’s face-down, arse-up for Potter, just for him, only for him, moaning and groaning into Potter’s pillow. Draco grabs the headboard for support, and oh fuck, Potter’s going faster now, his hips snapping and cock pumping hard and sure in him, the headboard banging against the wall in rhythm with his thrusts. When he hits that spot, starbursts of pleasure radiate deep from within Draco, exploding across his skin—
Harry flushes in embarrassment, and says, “Speedos. The Muggles call the pants Speedos. I’m sorry, did I disturb you? I thought no one would—“
“We want you to be happy,” she says, a patient smile on her face. “Besides, it’s a bit premature to talk about things so far into the future, isn’t it? Just talk to him, see if you can work out an arrangement. You need to know how far he’s willing to go, and you certainly don’t have to rush things.”
"Yeah," Harry says, ready to defend Luna if Malfoy says a nasty word about her. "And Blaise just proposed to Pansy."
“Happy birthday, Draco!” Hermione greets from the kitchen entrance. “Hey, I thought you were banned from the kitchen after you set the stove on fire last month?” she asks, raising a brow.
Harry's such a wild little fuck in bed: he releases his fingers from the space between the mattress and the headboard to punch the headboard, and then he's twisting the silk sheets at the tucked corner of the bed with white knuckles and fucking
"Don't be angry," Harry pleads. "I can't lie about something like this-" He stops short when Draco pulls the glove off his own right hand and Harry's glove off his left hand. He twines their bare fingers together, basking in the warmth of Harry's touch. He presses a string of kisses along Harry's jawline.
“What’s this?” Marjorie asks. She tilts her head, trying to look at the sketch the right way round. “May I?” She gestures to the book.
The facade melts away, revealing a jukebox cafe. Harry looks at the sign—IQ148. Despite frequenting the cafe, he hasn’t asked the owner about the origins of this quirky name. Does this mean Ayumi has an IQ of 148?
! Harry places the Potion beside the glass of water on the kitchen table. He makes his way to the bedroom, intending to check if Malfoy's alright.
“Easier like this. When it gets too much,” Draco’s words melt in a strangled cry as Potter enters faster than before, as if he can’t wait any longer. The sensation of being stretched to his limits makes his words spill out in chunks. “You’ll stop moving and… oh fuck
He only manages three steps before Harry yanks him back. He's about to say something, but his words wilt on his lips when he sees something else in Draco's expression. "I... I thought you were angry, but you're... disappointed!"
"I thought... I thought what we had last night was never about the money. After everything we've done, after how you... you..." Harry trails off, dropping his gaze to the floor. He's shaking his head, backing up one, two steps away from Draco.
"I apologise for my outburst. I think... you should go. I'll be awaiting word from the Aurors," Malfoy says, retreating into politeness and tugging on his earring again.
Swallowing, Draco guides Potter to the longer section of the L-shaped sofa to stretch their bodies out. When Potter's settled down with his head resting on the low arm-rest of the sofa, Draco climbs on top of him and sprinkles a trail of kisses from Potter's lips all the way down to his belly.
Ron and he skipped eighth year, with only Hermione returning to obtain her necessary qualifications for Healing. When Harry reached Hogwarts that afternoon, he spent some time getting re-acquainted with the castle. Equipped with the Marauders' Map, he wandered around the castle, which is now restored to its former glory. He let himself fall into the bittersweet fog of nostalgia, lingering at places he used to frequent as a student. You wouldn't even know a battle had occurred here, except for the war memorial on the seventh floor. His last stop was the White Tomb, Dumbledore's grave on the shores of the Great Lake. He spent a peaceful time there, simply sitting and watching the rippling water. He even laughed when the Giant Squid popped out a tentacle and waved it in his direction, as if welcoming him back.
"Still scares easily, huh?" Parkinson wrinkles her nose at the swinging kitchen doors and returns her attention to Hermione. "What? Someone had to say something."
"Nah, in fact, he looked mighty pleased with himself." Ron pops his food into his mouth, chewing slowly and contemplatively.
“Why’re you starin’ at him like that?” Charlie pipes up, squinting at Draco with glassy, unfocused eyes. “He’s still pointy. Like this.” He gets up, wobbling a bit, reaches across the table…
"Thanks," Harry says, breath hitching. This is the first time they've spoken since the night of the auditions. Anticipation's rising in Harry like a high-speed elevator.
Slytherins were a weird bunch. Harry was alright with them being weird and spanking each other, but couldn't they be weird somewhere else?
"Oh," Malfoy whispers, looking around. They're at the exact spot where they were on their first visit, but Harry pays minimal attention to the glittering scenery laid out in front of him, because he's only interested in one thing.
They pull away eventually; slowly, hesitating at first, their exhaled breaths mingling against their lips. Harry's hand finds the back of Draco's neck, and they rest their foreheads together, breathing in shallow, furious synchronisation.
"Yes, the exams are certainly getting to everyone," Hermione says loudly, drowning out Ron, who glances at her and raises an eyebrow.
He tangles his fingers into Harry's hair and gently guides him towards his treacled-up cock, fuck, he's such a fucking tease.
"Yeah, Harry," he encourages breathily, threading his fingers through Harry's hair and lifting his hips when Harry slides his hands under the waistband of his trousers and briefs. Draco gulps, his body throbbing with longing-
Draco replies with a satisfied smile. He sits up, and motions for Potter to straighten to a kneeling position. “I want to make you feel good too. Preferably with your cock in me.” Draco’s cock twitches at the mouth-watering sight: Potter’s so hard that the head of his leaking cock peeks out from the waistband of his boxers. Draco eagerly tugs his boxers down, and Potter helps by kicking it off.
Harry’s body sags with relief, and he goes to Draco at once. “We’ll worry about that when the time comes. But for now…” Harry cradles his face in his hands and envelops him in a soft kiss that reminds Draco of snowflake flurries and moonlight glitter. Only Harry can give him this intense attention and attraction that he craves with every fibre of his being. He trails the blue veins under Draco’s skin as they kiss, and when he’s touching him like that, Draco can’t think much about anything else at all.
"D’you reckon it’s a bad idea? Has he said anything about me? Does he still hate me?" Harry plops back on his seat opposite Charlie, frowning. "He can't hate me, can he? We've been getting on rather well." Still, Malfoy is bloody inscrutable at times, and Harry can't figure him out, even though he knows his mannerisms and some aspects of his personality as well as the back of his hand.
Fuck that, they've had years of verbal foreplay, Draco reasons in a haze of lust, that had to count for something, right?
Harry shifts uncomfortably in his seat, his face warming with embarrassment when someone nearby whispers behind their hand to a friend. He wheels around to the bar, his blush deepening when the bartender shoots him a curious look. He tugs his hood up, drains his beer and stares resolutely at his glass. The singing resumes, but he doesn’t move. Merlin, of course Malfoy would react to him; they have so much baggage between them that it could fill up an airport. Maybe he should leave, the last thing he wants to do is disrupt Malfoy’s set.
The two goons share a look, glance at the general vicinity where Bacon and Harry are huddled up and shrug. They follow Malfoy out of the corridor.
Of course, this is the exact moment when Malfoy, the contrary bastard, pulls off. He licks his lips and grins. "Tell me how much you want it," he whispers, his voice hoarse.
Draco tells Charlie what he told Minerva. Intent on avoiding the subject, he glances at his watch and pulls on his robes. "The students would be arriving soon. We should be going.”
"That's a very good sign. The Slytherins will be pleased when we tell them about this," Hermione says, cheering. Ron grins as they share a high-five, but his smile fades and a faint horror descends on his features.
Harry grabbed Draco's arse-cheeks hard while he continued to fuck him, deep, guttural grunts issuing from Harry's mouth. With every sharp thrust, the upper half of Draco's body sank lower and lower on the table until he was spread-eagled, arms wide apart and pushing things off his table in a frenzy — an ink-well shattered and files thudded when they hit the floor — and his legs were completely off the floor, knees drawn up and pressed against the table. Harry's always been an amazing fuck; primal, powerful and
Draco hesitates, uncertain about Potter’s reaction to his answer. "It’s when I clear the things of the deceased."
"Yeah," Harry blurts out. "Yeah, I do. I think about it all the time.” He pulls Malfoy closer and plants a chaste kiss on his cheek. Malfoy relaxes, the tension of his shoulders unwinding. "I didn't know if you wanted that, so I… er… well…”
"Well, you've found me. You gonna fuck me now?" The tip of Draco's tongue peeks out a corner of his mouth and his lips part in a cheeky grin. He lets out a throaty laugh which dissolves into a guttural groan when Harry starts to stroke, his heartbeat thudding when he feels Draco's throbbing cock through the silky material of his underwear.
Even though Draco loves Quidditch, he's keen to explore other types of journalism, especially International, and he’s hoping that his next posting will allow him to delve deeper into this new field. Journalism suits him, and he enjoys meeting people and building useful connections during events, interviews and networking meetings, but there’s something that makes it difficult for him sometimes—his Dark Mark.
"Someone's sick, alright, but it's not anyone back home." Charlie summons a letter with a Romanian stamp. "I'm leaving straight for the sanctuary tonight. Gotta pack up, instruct the house elves to feed my animals for hols, and then Portkey out. Lucky I've no classes tomorrow."
“I’ve always kept in touch with Minerva, ever since I wrote to her telling her I got into the Magpies ‘cause I know that’s her favourite team. She told me about Hooch leaving, and then before I knew it, I was signing the contract and packing my bags for Hogwarts. Felt like the right thing do.” Potter pats the surface of the water with his palms, as if punctuating the end of his story.
he’s ever come before, spurting it between their bodies. Potter looks down at the mess, manages a few more strokes, and then, balls-deep in Draco, he goes very still, throwing his head back and crying out Draco’s name before pulsing deep into his body. With half-lidded eyes, Draco admires the sight of a stunned Potter staring down at him with wide eyes and parted lips. He makes a small, happy sound when Potter laces their fingers together and lowers his face to sweep him into a breath-taking kiss. When Potter gently pulls out, Draco’s thoroughly fucked body goes limp.
Potter is so fucked-out of his brain that he can't even string words together. He's panting and gasping; Draco can catch snatches of his first name between his moans, but fuck, he could be wrong because the blood pounding in Draco’s ears is so loud, along with their cries, echoing in the still air of the canteen.
People tend to dismiss a love like that — a love as subtle and gentle as soft hands and whispered words of adoration that shimmer and melt in the night sky when Harry is sleeping — but that doesn't make Draco's love any less beautiful, any less worthy, any less enduring.
“By coming up with that… stunt,” he continues, laughing mirthlessly at that euphemism, “I demonstrated that Hogwarts, the safest magical stronghold in wizarding Britain, was no longer safe. That it could no longer protect, nor defend its students.” His hands curl into fists, a familiar surge of self-directed anger rising. “I was the person that breached this sanctuary, bringing Death Eaters, practitioners of the Dark Arts, into the castle. I wanted to make things right again. And so, I chose to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts.”
“My apologies, Potter. I have no right to concern myself with your dalliances. Please, ignore me. I must be tired from the long-distance travel,” Malfoy says, releasing a defeated sigh and stepping back. A quick shrug of his lips breaks the tension on his face, wiping away the jealousy. “Oh, I managed to catch Charlie on his way in earlier.” He sighs, concern colouring his tone. “I believe he told you about Everest, the dragon, last term?”
“Is the Halloween feast still as good?” he asks, recalling the giant pumpkins decorating the Great Hall, a flock of bats whizzing around, and the brilliant smorgasbord of food that plunges him into a food coma. Hermione used to be exasperated with him and Ron after feasts, when she’d be going on about revising and they’re zoned out in front of the fireplace in their common room, answering her in monosyllables.
— followed by the date of the Battle of Hogwarts. “The words are on my parents’ tombstone,” he says, but offers no further explanation.
He moves out of Harry's sight, threading his way through the duelling groups of seventh-year Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Harry quickly pushes away from the southern wall of the Middle Courtyard and steals through the row of stone pillars, discreetly keeping Malfoy in his view. Harry loves how he moves — that graceful, long-legged stride, and his soft blond hair rustling in the late afternoon breeze — as he paces amongst the students, pausing every few steps to correct their inflection or wand technique. For once, Malfoy's not dressed in his robes, and Harry basks in the sight of Malfoy in dark-grey trousers (that hugs his arse just right, goddamn) and plain black button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. His Mark is obvious, but neither he nor his students seem to care.
Hermione clears her throat. "Well, it's not exactly ripping off when you hand-delivered them to him."
"Did I hurt you?" Draco asks, worry in his voice. He reaches over to the dresser and retrieves a stoppered flask of golden liquid.
They kiss slowly and sensually in the snow and moonlight, their heads tilted, eyes closed and hands smoothing up and down waists and shoulders. Draco eagerly wriggles a hand under Harry’s layers of clothing to settle on the small of his back. In return, Harry cups a hand on the nape of Draco’s head — Draco loves it whenever he does that — to deepen the kiss.
An unwelcome and fleeting thought of the neglected Malfoy Manor barges into Draco's mind. He frowns and shakes his head to get rid of the memory.
He reaches the long driveway of the Manor and slows to a jog. His heart is thudding, not only because of the physical exertion. When he's at the open Manor gates, he doubles over, palms pressed on his knees as he sucks in lungfuls of fresh air. He wipes the sweat off his brow, and then enters the gardens, hunching low as he sneaks towards the rows of people seated on white benches.
The question is unexpected, and it takes a while for Draco to marshal his thoughts after getting over the surprise of Potter calling him emotionally mature. "I learnt some things along the way as I tidied people's homes. They tell me stories, new perspectives. Behind every sentimental item lies a story. Most of them I forget, but some... some I remember." Like a breath of fresh air amidst the monotony of clearing clothes and books, there was a time when a grandmother talked fondly about her late husband, and another occasion when a Muggle lady reminisced about her son who passed away in the military.
“We’ll see about that,” Draco says, cushioning the ambiguity of his answer with a smile. He glances at his watch. “I have to go for dinner now, I’ve got to work on the content for Duelling Club this term. The first session starts in early October.”
"I must not be a very good substitute for Ron, then. His shoulders are broader—" Draco squares his shoulders before deepening his voice. "Oi, Hermione! Your hair is all over my face. Budge up, won't you?"
Draco mumbles something in his sleep and rolls closer to the other side of the bed that has gone unoccupied for months.
They’re just boys — a pair of sixteen-year-old boys scared and uncertain about the respective roles they’re supposed to play.
Harry scoots closer to Draco, but keeps his silence, allowing Draco to stay lost in the moment. It's just like Hogwarts all over again: when they were lying on the grass near the Great Lake and gazing up at the stars. Close enough to touch, yet too far away because the paths set in their futures were never supposed to cross. Harry was supposed to marry the Weaslette, while Draco had plans to settle down with Astoria. Fast-forward two years later, and neither of that still stands.
This isn't like any gay club he's visited — Harry's all too used to the dizzying technicolour strobe lights illuminating the bumping and grinding of half-naked bodies on the dance floor; glitter raining down on the heaving masses that twirl on linoleum floors stained, sticky and sweet because of spilt alcohol — but
Hogwarts, where Malfoy is. The pieces of Harry’s broken heart are shouting at him to stop running, turn around and let Malfoy hold him. They could still salvage the situation, if Malfoy would only—
Once again, Draco finds his gaze returning to Potter, who is dressed in very Muggle exercise attire — a dark blue T-shirt (sure, it’s a Magpies T-shirt, but still), knee-length shorts and running shoes. Draco certainly isn’t complaining, though — he’s too busy admiring the way the shirt stretches across Potter’s shoulder blades and his taut stomach. Although Potter’s body isn’t the broad-shouldered and bulging muscles type (like Charlie), he still looks brilliant, keeping his lithe frame as a Seeker. His knees are still as knobbly, and Salazar, he looks even fitter now. Draco eyes his well-developed calves, the smooth gait when he runs, and the tendons shifting in his strong forearms when he adjusts the positioning of a student on her broom.
"Hiya, Harry. Mind if I interrupt to dance with Pansy? It's our favourite song," Neville barges in with a crooked grin, his arm already around her.
He doesn't know how long they stay there like that, Potter sucking him slowly and sensually, at the perfect pace and intensity so he doesn't come, coaxing moans and gasps from him. With every passing minute, Potter familiarises himself with Draco's cock, until he's mapping out Draco's sweet spots on the underside and just beneath the ridge of his cock.
T-shirt, ripped jeans and sneakers. They have proper tablecloths, for heavens' sake! He moves over to a table and rubs the silk tablecloth between his fingers, eyes snagging on the laminated menu placed on each table. He flips it open and scans through it, feeling surprised when the prices aren't sky-high as expected. He replaces the menu and looks around proper.
Draco blinks himself awake, his mouth stretching into a yawn. When his eyes focus on Harry, they grow wide, and for a second, Harry fears that Draco will push him away again.
It's sleek and silver, smooth with a metallic finish. It's slim; almost as slim as Harry's iPod — during their relationship of six months, Harry took it upon himself to introduce Draco to Muggle technology, but he still prefers quill and parchment to Microsoft Word. Harry had given him the recorder this morning just before reporting to the Ministry for a week-long trip to Southeast Asia for field work.
Draco sneers, his teeth clenching as they go through love letters and cards from Potter's exes. A nasty voice snarls within Draco, and this time, he listens to it. "Perhaps you would like to get rid of them?" he asks casually, keeping his jealousy in check. "Those people that Granger and Weasley set you up with... they weren't right for you."
I watched how you screamed my name as you came all over your bed. I know how you like to touch yourself — three quick jerks and one long stroke, your thumb over your slit. How long have you been thinking about me like this?"
They're moving towards the back rooms, and Harry would bet that they're going to the secret room that Bacon sketched out in the map that very first night. Harry turns back to the counter, counts five seconds in his head before making his excuses and leaving the bar. He follows the two blond heads amidst the crowd, waits another five seconds for them to enter the back of the club before stepping forward. Harry easily slips through the bouncers this time, nodding at them and goes towards the dressing room. He smiles at a pair of strippers, waits for them to pass before pulling out his Invisibility Cloak.
"The first day of term," Charlie says. At Potter's growl, he immediately covers his mouth, sheepish.
Harry swallows, heart clenching. He slides a finger in and out; slowly, gently, loving the strangled sound Draco makes and how he clings onto Harry.
"Why? Jealous?" Once again, that triumphant smirk curls Malfoy's lips, as if Harry had let slip something that he wasn't supposed to, but Harry's brain is short-circuiting as he kisses that smirk away.
After they're finished, Potter goes to the window and glances at Draco. Potter hesitates for a heartbeat, before extending his arm and wiping the condensation from the window with the end of his sleeve.
“I’ve got some things,” Harry says. He turns to Darren, one of his older and more experienced students. “Lead the class in warm-ups while I help Professor Malfoy get ready.”
Unimpressed, Harry crosses his arms and leans against the doorjamb, raising his brows in challenge. Draco extends his other arm, proffering a large paper bag from Shake Shack.
They wait with bated breath as the chatter fades away. Malfoy stares at him, before pushing up and away from him. Harry blinks, uncertain. The interruption broke the moment, but he tries anyway. "Just now, we…"
She dips her head, and a tendril of hair falls, framing her face. She tucks it behind her ear. Her eyes are faraway when she speaks. "He sometimes says your name when he sleeps. He reads every article that mentions you. Just seeing a photo of you with another man is enough to ruin his day.” She shrugs, a faint smile of resignation curving her lips. “And then we met you at Barcelona. I saw how he looked when you ran out. He took me to bed that night, but I wasn't the one he was thinking of."
Malfoy abruptly drops to his knees, running his hands all over himself, his hips still swirling in figure eights. Harry almost chokes on his beer as the head of a black mamba appears from between Malfoy's spread legs. It's a sight hot enough to make Harry palm his hard cock briefly over his trousers — the stark contrast of the entirely black snake spiralling up Malfoy's pale half-naked body, its head disappearing periodically behind Malfoy's back as it begins to twists itself continuously around Malfoy's trunk and shoulders. Malfoy performs a few body waves, urging the snake on. As the mamba ascends, Malfoy drops a hand near his crotch and places it over the snake, stroking slowly, as if he's
Potter withdraws at once, the speed of the movement telling Draco that he was expecting the command.
"Things that spark joy…” Draco murmurs, his words soft and gentle. “The things that remind you of them don't have to be physical because they live in you. With every Patronus spell you cast, it reminds you of Lupin. You have your mother’s eyes, and her love in your blood. You've inherited your father's hair and looks, like how I resemble mine. And Sirius Black..." Draco looks around them. "He gave you this house and your love of music.”
here is to your liking," Draco slurs as he fucks hard. He pulls out halfway; Potter whines in dismay. "Would hate for anyone to leave here without a glowing experience." He tilts his hips at just the right angle, and then slams back into Potter so hard that he rises up on the balls of his feet.
"You're grinning like a loon, Harry," Draco pipes up, startling him from his parade of Draco-themed sex dreams. Draco bookmarks his page, picks up a piece of paper and heads over to him.
Draco’s gaze lands on Potter's chest, where the top few buttons of his shirt have come undone. There's another tattoo over his heart, and it appears to cover up a red, oval-shaped scar. There's a Snitch inked over the scar. "What is this?" Draco asks.
"Think it's funny, d'you?" Potter snarls, all sheepishness gone now. "Must've felt good, teasing me like that. I'm gonna fuck you right now, Draco, fuck you till you can't smirk or smile or dance like that anymore-" Potter promises, his eyes flashing as his hand wraps around Draco's cock.
Harry pats his pockets, wondering if the napkin is in this pair of trousers, ah, there it is. He fishes it out, along with a pen. "I win," he announces, victorious. He indicates so on the napkin, embellishing it with a childish doodle. Ron nicks his pen when he’s finished and writes on the other side, "
He still dreams about Malfoy, still wanks to him. How could he not, when the only pleasure his body knows started and ended with Malfoy?
Potter’s hold slackens at once. “I should’ve been gentler with you,” he says in a small voice, and if Draco was a better person, he would’ve taken Potter in his arms and comforted him.
He lets Potter wish for the Room, and a door emerges from the stone wall. Potter groans in relief when it clicks open under his touch. They enter, and...
Harry grins and kisses the top of Draco’s head, inhaling his lovely vanilla scent. "This." He laces his fingers with Draco’s and squeezes. "Just this."
"Sorry boys. He's off the menu tonight," Malfoy says lightly, but there's no denying the undercurrent of danger lacing his voice.
It's an album documenting the renovation and shift to their new house. There's dozens of photos in the album, complete with annotations, but a few photos have caught Draco's fancy: a picture of Harry and Draco napping on the couch together, clad in paint-smeared clothes, along with messy scrawls of paint-smudged hair (Hermione must've taken that photo); Ron and Arthur Weasley attempting to assemble an IKEA bookcase, much to their abject confusion and everyone else's hilarity; Narcissa and Draco sitting in the half-furnished garden and talking about flowers; Pansy and Blaise gesturing to a painting in one of their guest rooms; and a photo of Ron, Hermione and Harry laughing in the kitchen, taking a break over biscuits and tea.
Eventually, Robards nods at them and bids goodbye. Charlie closes the door after Robards leaves. He follows Draco to his table, plopping down on the chair that Robards vacated minutes ago. "So how many of mine made it into the Academy this year?"
Harry raises his eyebrows and picks up a parchment ball littered around their feet. "Don't be so bloody pleased with yourself." He throws the ball at Draco, and it bounces off his chest. "I'm not gonna rehash the Great Sexuality Crisis of 1999."
The mattress squeaks under them, the fabric of the sheets is rubbing against Draco’s cock, amplifying his pleasure. Potter huffs and bites the side of his neck as he fucks him like an animal, passionate and primal. His world has narrowed to the luxurious sensation of Potter’s cock ramming into him, the slick slide of sweat between their bodies, Potter’s grunts and his own cries, he’s close, oh, he’s so close—
Another round of encouragement ripples across the crowd. Malfoy's eyes flicker to Harry. "I... well..." It's clear that his protests are crumbling in the face of his students' enthusiasm, and only then does Harry move closer, not wanting to agree to something that Malfoy truly objects to; this is his class, after all.
He takes a few deep breaths to steady himself before Apparating to the only place that might have some answers. Harry steps out of the dark alleyway and rushes to Mona’s. They’re open on Saturdays for lunch, and when Marjorie sees him, she puts down the glass that she’s polishing and calls out his name.
Draco thinks back to their first year and Harry’s rejection of his friendship. He’s found himself thinking about that with increasing frequency nowadays. Sometimes he’ll imagine using a Time-Turner to return to that exact moment. Would he have made things turn out differently? Would Harry have accepted his hand if he had lessened the harshness of his insults towards Weasley?
Potter looks down at his croissant. "That's what Ron and Hermione say, but it's..." He shakes his head dismissively. "No. My job... it's comfortable. Stable." He licks a strip of sugar off his pastry. "And that's what I want right now." Despite his words, Potter looks pensive for a moment, before the grim line sealing his lips is replaced by a grin that's too bright and wide to be genuine. He grabs the phone to order their takeout, and Draco munches thoughtfully on his pastry.
“Oh no. This isn’t some quick shag in the back of a club,” Malfoy says, with a throaty laugh. He undoes each button as slow as possible. When he’s finally finished, Harry moves to shrug his shirt off, but Malfoy wants him to keep it on. “Look at you,” he murmurs in awe. Grey eyes glimmer as they sweep Harry’s body — Harry’s hair is messy, his lips parted, chest heaving as he pants eagerly in short and shallow breaths. His legs are splayed open, his cock so hard that it rests on his belly. When a breeze gusts across them, his nipples harden, and Malfoy grazes them with a finger.
All of Draco's attention is occupied by the view of Potter’s back: his dark-blue polo shirt hugging that delicious, broad set of shoulders and his biceps. Draco will tug the collar down later, expose that strip of skin at the back of his neck and leave a string of love bites there. Draco's eyes move south, at the black jeans gripping Potter's delectable arse in all the right ways. His jeans are frayed at the ends and the black dye has faded in the back pockets where Potter keeps his wallet and wand.
Harry stumbles through the portrait hole, running into Ron, who's sitting alone on the sofa in the dim light, his face turned towards the window.
"Wrong! Slytherins don't have green as their default favourite colour, you pillock. How do I deal with conflict? What should you do when we're fighting?"
Harry sits up and scoots closer to him, surprised that Malfoy trusts him with his guitar. “You sure?” When Malfoy nods, he smiles and accepts the guitar.
There's a crick in his neck, and an ache in his lower back. He gratefully accepts, and they watch Draco perform. Even though it stretches late, and they have work tomorrow, Hermione and Ron stay with Harry for the entire gig.
Malfoy Summons a chair wandlessly from the side of the stage and hauls himself off Harry. He beckons for Harry to sit down. Harry obeys, and the red snake perches itself on Harry's shoulder — watching, waiting.
Harry might enjoy his solitude as he explores the city, but he has developed a habit of messaging Malfoy often, and he can’t help but feel thrilled whenever he receives a reply. Two nights ago, Malfoy invited him to another gig, and they left together afterwards, eating chicken tikka rolls on the way home.
He opens a drawer and pulls out a bag of treats. Upon spotting the familiar packaging, Humphrey perks up at once and launches himself into the air when Draco tosses a treat, catching it in his beak. Placated, Humphrey retreats and flies away.
Harry’s face heats up at the image that those words conjure, but then Malfoy suddenly says something that engulfs Harry in a full-body blush.
"You said we should talk. But you can't keep your eyes off me," Harry says, lifting a shoulder in a casual shrug. "Hey," he says around a grin, waving a hand in Malfoy's face.
Harry laughs without humour. He slumps against the wall and removes his glasses. He rubs his face and sighs, needing some fresh air to clear his mind.
And then Potter wipes his palms on his jeans, and Salazar, he's moving into Draco's personal space, head tilted towards him, his lips hovering just inches away from Draco's, but not pushing it any further—
"Oh no, we're not allowed to come yet, we're not at the other side of the bed." With a mischievous glint in his eye, Harry yanks Draco down on the bed just a bit further from where they were. He gets into a new position on his side, his right leg in the air and right hand tucked underneath his bent knee, holding himself wide open.
A gentle and comforting breeze envelops him, rich with centuries-old magic that tingles on his fingertips, raising the hairs on his neck. It’s as if the magic is rising from the floor, seeping through the walls, surging from the very foundation of the castle.
The warmth of Harry's body is intoxicating, especially when he wraps an arm around Draco's waist, his hand fisting into Draco's shirt. Draco moans, and their movements acquire an intensity and urgency that makes Draco's heart pound even faster. His palm skates across Harry's shoulder blades, his fingers brushing Harry's hair on the nape of his neck before descending to his arm. Draco feels Harry's kiss turn into a smile when Harry flexes his bicep.
He rests his hand on his left arm, rubbing his thumb on his skin, his fingers tingling with a need to touch. How would it feel to be tattooed by Potter?
"Yes," Draco lies. Relief floods Potter's face. Draco hauls Potter's left leg up from the back of the sofa and rests it against his chest. After making sure that Potter's comfortable, Draco begins to rock his hips, being extra careful to not fuck Potter with his whole cock. Although it's only half, it still feels so damn fucking good...
"I have to pack, I’m leaving tomorrow," Harry says, the words catching in his throat. "So I guess this is—"
He turns his attention to the scenery, at the cars on the roads, the people walking on the streets below him, returning home or going for dinner after a long day of work. They'll wake up tomorrow morning, falling into the same comforting, humdrum routine.
Draco's hands stutter in their circuit up and down Potter's body. His heart is beating so fast and hard with disbelief that he won't be surprised if Potter can feel it. He blinks, dazed. It's surreal, having Potter ready and waiting right here, right now, after so many fantasies and so many years.
“Too small?” Draco guesses. Why else would he be self-conscious about something like this? He frowns; Potter’s size feels rather decent when they’re grinding, though.
Draco gives him a small, tentative smile. This is their first conversation since the fight, and he’s uncertain as to how Potter would react. “Good evening.” He gestures to the jumble of brooms. “I trust my students haven’t been giving you trouble?”
"Keep talking like that, and we're both not gonna last," he says, grabbing the lube. His blood is pounding in his ears, his cock throbbing as he coats his fingers. His hand holding the vial tips over too much—probably because of nerves—and lube flows into his palm, dripping onto Malfoy's stomach.
He had Flooed over when he regained his senses, only to be met with a dreadful sight: Hermione slumped on the door, her head tipped back and throat exposed while she screams Ron’s name over and over again amidst sobs that shake her entire frame. She's clutching onto Ron's unopened will so hard that it's scrunched into an indiscernible shape.
Draco bowed and offered his left arm, raising it and willing it not to tremble. He rearranged his features into a smooth, expressionless mask of deference.
A burst of unexpected laughter came from Draco, who immediately clapped a hand to his mouth, while Minerva barked out an admonishing
Eventually, the class ends, and Harry regards all of them, a ball tucked under his arm and pressing against his hip. “Next week, we’ll work on defending, and more techniques to improve the accuracy of your shots. Once everyone is decent, we’ll team up for a game. Hopefully, after next week, you can do this.”
Out of his first-years, Leo — an only child — is the shy one, keeping mostly to himself during lessons, and Draco is pleased to see him step out of his shell like this.
"Well, see you tomorrow," Ron says, dropping some coins into the pouch. They disappear, to be replaced by his change.
Draco swallows the emotion in his throat, and his voice shakes when he whispers, "What am I going to do with you, Harry?"
The finale is an amazing spectacle — a thoroughly dishevelled Harry sitting upright on a chair, legs sprawled wide apart, a red snake seated on his shoulder and his body joined to Malfoy's at the hip. A practically naked Malfoy is facing the audience upside down, upper body bent so low that strands of blond hair graze the floor, his black mamba poised high and proud on his chest.
As Ron contacts Underground to swap stakeouts with Jackson and Simons in Leicester, Harry turns his head towards Draco's general direction.
Draco tries not to show it, but he's rather out of his element in the kitchen. He retrieves the tools, pulls the blue jar towards him and dumps the dough onto the counter.
Their smiles fade as they look at each other. Potter rubs the back of his neck, a sign that he doesn’t know what to say. Draco shifts his weight from foot to foot. An awkward silence stretches. They rarely spend much time alone; their friends are usually around to keep the conversation going and the mood light.
"Perhaps I could forgive you… if you’ll have dinner with me this Saturday night?" Malfoy offers without missing a beat, lips turned up in a tentative smile.
. His clothes are balled up and chucked in the corner of the room. Potter gets up from the chair at once, but freezes when Draco barks out, "Stay!"
It's not gentle, nor is it delicate. It's heaving with all the emotions that Harry feels thundering in his heart, but those emotions narrow down to uncertainty because Malfoy isn't kissing him back; instead, his hands — which were bunched up in anger — fall away from Harry's shoulders and lay limply at his sides. But Harry plods on with his characteristic bull-headed obstinacy, his arms tightening their grip on Malfoy's waist as he tilts his head and deepens the kiss.
"Oh, really?" she remarks, before peering at him intently. "Potter.” She frowns, conflicted. She fiddles with her napkin, folding the corners down and smoothing them out. She repeats the motion, sighing. "If you're not over him, if you still want him, you have to act fast," she says, an urgency in her words. "Time is running out, and preparations are already underway."
The usual breakfast chatter resumes, and Draco hurriedly picks up his conversation with Aurora, although he can’t stop sneaking glances at the flowers. He waits until the last possible moment to leave for his first class, not wanting the students to see him holding the roses — he’s a professor, for Merlin’s sake, not some bird being courted. He could shrink the roses, but they really are quite lovely; it’d be a shame if they became squashed after unshrinking.
Malfoy's blush deepens, and he rests their foreheads together. "I've wanted this for longer than I'd admit to myself," he murmurs, pressing a hand on Harry's chest, directly over his heart.
Most of the group is already in their usual booth at the Leaky. When they're settled with their drinks, Finnigan looks at Draco and Potter. "Heard Malfoy's been working with you on Grimmauld. How is it?" he asks Potter.
They spend the next fifteen minutes in deep discussion and casting various spells at Potter before they manage to turn him back to human form. Potter's face breaks into a relieved grin, and he pats himself down.
"What if you don't come back this time? Or what if you vanish again and return in another year or so?" He grabs the towel, wipes his hands and hurls it to the floor. "I can't..." He trails off, deflating, the fight going out of him. He covers his face with his palms. "I can't do this anymore. If you don't come back, I don't know what I'll..." he whispers in a broken voice, muffled by his hands.
Draco takes a sip of water and runs a finger down the selection of main courses. "Chicken Cordon Bleu is easily out, first of all; if you can't pronounce it, you won't order it. Despite your personality, you're a highly predictable person when it comes to food. You also have a fairly unadventurous palate, so there goes the chicken curry." Curry occasionally appears on the Ministry menu, and Potter does seem tempted at times, but he ultimately settles for his tried-and-tested fare.
