“Yes, it’s been a terrible hardship.”
“’Cold revenge’, Potter? …I’m not sure that’s how the saying goes.”
His final stop for the day was the very first shelter he and Savage had cleared of Dementors. It was smaller than many of the others, but had been just as busy every time they had gone by to clear off the worst of them. Thankfully there were no floating wraiths lingering by the doors that afternoon, and no queue out the door either.
Ginny returned home when she could but, as Quidditch season was beginning in earnest, he would only see less and less of her for the foreseeable future. Even when she was home Harry’s new workload meant that not only had the house become more neglected than ever, but he found he hadn’t even the energy to communicate most nights.
“Well, welcome, of course. What brings you to my reception?”
“Potter. Wake up.”
“We need to be sure we’re both proficient at setting the outer enchantments—protective, illusions, the Taboo, all of it. In case anything goes wrong on either end there needs to be more than one person who knows how to do this.”
As they moved into the new year, frustration had become Harry’s primary emotion, and more than once he found himself snapping at anyone who crossed him at the wrong moment. Only Ginny was really spared his temper, and only to do with his being so afraid to give her any hint that anything was wrong in the first place.
“You too,” Harry said cautiously.
Harry rested his hands on Draco’s hips, wanting to feel how they moved, but let him control everything. It was an agonising sort of perfection when Draco drew out every inch only to take him in again. Lost deep in the patiently unrelenting drag of tight heat, Harry moaned. The soothe of Draco’s fingertips traced up his cheek and into his hair, and he moaned even lower when Draco did that circling thing with his hips as he rubbed their tongues together.
As his breathing evened, Draco blinked at him uncomprehendingly before seeming to put together what had just happened.
He felt compelled to argue, even if Draco had a point. “I’m not fucking anyone but you.”
“I’ll survive,” he drawled indolently. “I’m fairly certain I slept most of the night on top of you anyway.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
It took almost no time at all for him to get hard again, what with Draco working his arse right up against Harry’s cock and rubbing back all slippery and firm, the light strands of his hair dripping and tickling over Harry’s shoulder.
Harry blinked. “Here?”
Nothing he’d said was entirely false, though Harry knew he was stretching the truth near to breaking now.
Thankfully, no one seemed to find any of this unusual, though it took effort for Harry to not show exactly how much it hurt taking most of Ron’s weight. At least it stopped him having to hug every drunk friend in the entire Inn, he felt awkward enough as it was.
Listening for the soft crunch of footsteps farther in, he followed the sound, with no sense of self-preservation at all.
“I guess not—but I wanted to see if your sheets were really any softer than mine.”
Harry kissed back a bit longer before he eased off.
“Alright—well, ‘suppose I’ll send an owl about the time off tonight then.”
It was only natural instinct for Harry to step up from behind to steady him.
“Are you having any or not?”
He set about to pay for their drinks—but Aberforth waved him off with a grumbled dismissal that left Harry smiling a bit softly. “See you later then.”
“Tonight. Once we’ve finished with all the extensions I’ll let you fuck me again, and you can lick me wherever you like, for as long as you like—”
He managed a few hours of sleep on Friday after work, but woke at midnight from a particularly awful dream.
Harry hesitated not at all backing him up against said tree to kiss him again. Draco’s low hum vibrated on his lips, and he was ready to properly deepen it when a rather unfortunate reality prevented him doing so.
’d at him, with a hint of an old familiar sneer. “Still watching me? You haven’t learned your lesson at all, have you? And you still owe me a favour.”
“Bit exciting though, isn’t it?”
“Well spotted. But as you can see, this particular balcony is occupied.” He gestured around with a glass of something that glinted green moonlight from the shadows.
“Nothing, Love. It’s not important.”
On his way down to Hagrid’s Harry was, of course, accosted by a number of people.
Bits of broken porcelain rolled off onto the ground, and Malfoy banished the rest with his wand.
She sounded chiding, but her smile curved affectionately at him.
Mostly, Harry blamed himself. And Malfoy, the sneaky git. Blaming the potion probably would have been easier, and Harry almost wished that he could, but he also knew he’d been thinking a little too much about Malfoy well before the potion was ever in play.
“It’s a Merlin spell,” he said offhand. “If you’ve got an object with a purpose of some sort, it will usually enchant it to do its job independently. I’ll write it down for you later.”
“Hm?”
, slow down. You’re not small, you know.”
After several weeks uninterrupted, it was easy to forget how precarious everything they were doing truly was—but then, Harry’s short time with Ron the day before brought a rather more painful clarity to the reality of it all.
“If I’d known you were coming, I would’ve cleaned the place spotless,” said a grizzled voice dryly from behind the pub’s counter. “Not many Malfoys deign to grace my humble pub.”
“Shit,” Harry sighed.
He whispered prep spells, doing his best to untangle their lower halves from come-sticky sheets so that Draco might spread his legs enough he could get his cock up between them. When the angle wasn’t right, Harry huffed his frustration and rolled them over, getting his knees under him to pull Draco’s hips up, close enough to push the tip of his prick past the slicked-tight circle he wanted into so badly.
Neither of them was actually wearing any pants, but Draco spun to face him with a challenging sort of head tilt, and held Harry’s gaze as he worked the hem of his pyjamas down over narrow hips. Harry tried not to look down, but failed completely, the sound of shifting fabric drawing his attention in time to see Draco stepping out of them.
Rather instinctively, he arched back to spread a bit wider, and give Draco a clearer shot.
When he woke Saturday morning, after only an hour more, it was only five. Harry still felt very tired, but he gave up trying to force it. He picked up Draco’s book on spell modifications, and settled in to re-read chapter twenty-seven for the dozenth time.
Something about the breathy drawl purred into his ear, his name on Draco’s lips as their hips worked faster caught him completely off guard—when he came it was practically a shout. He only noticed he’d been so loud when he felt Malfoy biting at his lips a moment later.
“They’re a bit long, aren’t they?” Harry muttered, dutifully allowing himself to be turned one way, then the other.
“You’re sure you want me to go?” Harry checked.
Already getting to the steeping, he plopped himself down in the chair across from Draco’s.
“Now what?” he prompted, knowing Draco would already have an answer prepared.
Before they did anything else, Draco insisted they brush their teeth again, and they headed back into the tent they’d slept in to get on with it.
“Lovely,” Draco drawled.
“I need to come again,” he whispered with dawning clarity.
Draco took on a familiar scowl. “I did not care.”
“I suppose I’ll have to be. I would hate to keep you from your paperwork—.”
Most jetted up onto his shirt—though a bit made it as far as Harry’s glasses.
Harry’s only answer was another low moan, and then he was rolling them over once more, if only to properly press his still straining cock against Draco’s and rub down
As always, work also included a lot of paperwork and reports, and his training classes and theory studies were ever-ongoing. It was quite a lot to juggle.
On the day he was meant to meet Malfoy, as the hour approached Harry fought off a nervous anticipation and did his best to keep his focus on the notes he had been taking on the casting of Extension Charms. In the last minutes he gathered up the few objects he intended to take and prepared himself for the inevitable pull behind his navel—bringing with it a familiar discomfort, always taking him back to the end horror of his last Triwizard task.
“Well, it appears you’ve been left dateless. Now what will you do?”
“That is a brilliant fucking potion,” he sighed. “—only now I can’t move.”
“You want to explore?” Harry repeated. “Now?”
“We ought to be getting back to work now.”
“It’s quite a lot to ask sight unseen, I know. You don’t have to make any commitments, and I don’t want you feeling obligated to help us—but we really could use your expertise.”
“I’ll write up some notes when I’ve got the time.”
“You’re a prince, Harry.”
Harry moved to kneel behind him on the deep cushioned seat, and as Draco rocked back on the darkened shaft of Harry’s prick, Harry pushed in closer yet, rubbing harder against Draco’s arse, all rather slick from Harry’s tongue.
Reluctantly he let up on the pressure between them, fighting not to give in when Draco arched to get him back. He was on a mission now, and too far gone for spells, he started tugging at frustratingly complicated fabric. He managed to pop several of their trouser buttons in his rush to press the pleasure-sore swell of his cock to Draco’s—and get lost the hot slick slide between them as the potion’s lewd power tore its way through their systems. It was ramping up every sensation—driving them to rubbing and rutting together until they could both come again.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“What?” he breathed aloud to himself.
“Harry
Occasionally, when they inhaled at the same time, their lips bumped unintentionally and it was a bit of pleasurable torture.
“Let’s get on with it then. Stay sharp—and please no more pattern-clashing monstrosities.”
Harry bristled. He didn’t have to be such a prick about it, though apparently, he was not done being one.
“Three women—and a few more men than I care to count…none of whom have ever fucked me more than once.”
“What’s there to explain? Explain to Zabini—he obviously knows you much better than I do.”
“It was the only place we could get any peace and quiet,” George spoke up in good humour.
“Look, you don’t have to make any commitments—” Harry continued advocating, ignoring the exaggerated glare with which Malfoy attempted to quell him. “—only think about what I’ve said, maybe you’ll have some ideas, that’s all.”
“Our main goal will be drawing the Dementors away as much as possible, before we do any casting. They’ll always go for a Wizard’s essence first, ‘seems they’ve got a taste for us,” Savage explained, nose wrinkling in disgust.
“This is a music box.”
In his owl, Harry included a small bit of instruction on the function of the Portkey, and one other note:
“To start with… do you have any idea where they’re all coming from?” Draco prompted.
Not being terribly invested in the outcome of that particular tradition, and being more than a touch past tipsy, Harry decided to take a break from all of the excitement, if only to avoid making a spectacle of himself.
“What’ve I just said to you?”
“Harry. Carefully…
“I’m not apologising to you for an accident.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Ah, sorry. You read about famous people, of course…never really expect them to be sat in your office attempting to solve all your problems, do you?”
They were a glass and a half in when Draco leant in enough to nip just once at his cheek, and Harry abruptly drained the last burning swallow before catching at his chin to pull him in for a slowly pointed kiss.
He met him that morning in the Ministry’s atrium, and though he wasn’t waiting long, it did give his mind time to wander as he surveyed the room. Some things had not changed; the lifts still stood behind a massive golden gate, the main area remained lined with hearths stretching out farther than a single person could see, and the ceiling still arched high above them, glinting and flashing with bifurcating magic light.
“Sorry. Cheers then,” Harry threw back instead.
He found himself morbidly pondering what the ball might have been like the year Umbridge had been in charge of its planning. Perhaps the champagne fountain had run with the blood of all the children she had made to write lines, wrung from so many pages of wasted parchment—
“Sorry...” Harry trailed off with a distracted hiss at the sensitivity of his cock when he tried to do up his jeans. Maybe he needed to give it a minute.
“Of course that’s okay Daddy! I can’t wait to see Uncle Draco!” Teddy stood up on the bed and started jumping again.
“Ya sure look it. Here, have another one on me.” The man waved to the bartender to pour another one for the both of them. He held out his hand to Harry and said genuinely, “The names Eric.”
“Nah, not a boyfriend. Haven’t had one of them in a long time.” He looked up at Draco, who now had an eyebrow raised, obviously questioning this whole conversation now. “Well, I might as well tell you now, seeing as I’ve already let the crupe out of the bag.” Harry stood up and walked into the hall, Draco was worried he might come back with something to hurt him. When Harry walked back in the room, Harry was carrying a photograph in his hands. Draco could see the occupants moving from the distance, but he couldn’t tell who they were this far away. Harry handed Draco the photo and he looked at it closely, and he saw Harry, must’ve been not too long ago with how long his hair was in the picture, but there was a boy in the picture with him. The boy had vibrant purple hair that stuck up in multiple directions, and his eyes, Draco had to do a double take to make sure he was seeing them correctly. The boy’s eyes were a bright, almost bone chilling silver. Draco looked up at Harry in shock. He raised an eyebrow at Harry to explain. “He’s my son.” Draco’s shock changed to surprise, his eyes wide and taking in Harry’s face, which was now showing a look of unconditional love. “My godson actually, Teddy.” He took the photo from Draco’s hand, beaming at it.
“Thank you.” Malfoy nodded and picked up his tea again.
Harry smiled and ruffled Teddy’s hair as he sat down across from McGonagall, Draco following him and sitting in the armchair next to him. “I think just some sandwiches will do fine McGonagall, thank you.”
“Hiya kiddo.” Harry laughed at the rambunctious 8-year-old that was now trying to struggle free from Harry’s grip. Harry set Teddy down on the floor and watched him run straight down the hallway into the kitchen and within seconds back out again with his grandmother in tow. “Andromeda.” Harry smiled politely, knowing that he was going to get an earful from her about being late.
Draco went to go sit with his mother after being at the hospital for an hour, Astoria’s labor was taking longer than either of them had predicted. He looked up from the floor as he entered the guest waiting room to the suite and saw his mother, eyes wide with worry, her hands running over themselves in nervousness. He had never seen his mother this way in his life. Narcissa was always a look of calm for as long as he could remember. Even at his father’s trial, she had a look of calm about her that, to be honest, unnerved Draco. The only other time he had not seen his mother calm, was their own trial, but this was not the look she carried that day.
“I heard a lot of them, I thought some of them were pretty great to be honest. I think my favorite one that I had heard was that Ron and I had bribed him with sweets that we stored in our robes and then hit him in the head with a broken toilet.” Harry laughed as he remembered hearing the story cross through the halls back in his first year.
“Not to mention that he’s been raised by you,
Draco stared at Harry and noticed how he obviously still didn’t take care of his hair, just like when they were kids. His hair was unruly, full of curls, and still almost stark black, but there had appeared to be some grey slipping through the piercing darkness of the mess. His train of thought was broken when Harry had pulled an elastic band from his wrist and pulled the mess hanging on his shoulders back into another bun.
The corners of Draco’s mouth lifted as he watched the boy laugh, wiping tears from his bright violet eyes.
“Granger, annoying,
“I see that the two of you go married?” He said, nodding to their hands. The both smiled and nodded at him. “So you’re a Weasley now, huh Granger? Might want to think about changing your hair color.” He smiled to himself, then hoped that he hadn’t said anything insulting to the two of them. He looked up at them, wondering if he’d be met with glares, but instead, they were both laughing.
"Maybe," the blond said, gaze fixed on the carpet despite his head still half-turned toward the man just behind him, "if either of those things had been sent to
fault the list is so long," Draco muttered, wanting to climb out of his own skin and run from that as well.
"Well, Harry," Blaise turned to the messy-haired boy, "let's go then. Follow me."
And turning away, he strode quickly from the room, feeling angry and frustrated and confused, wondering why exactly he had gotten so furious. But damn it, Hermione's fear was just plain ridiculous! Harry was
of that was what he wanted. "I broke up with her," he blurted, interrupting Draco at the beginning of what was clearly a long and angry tirade. "I ended things for good this time; it's over." Malfoy said nothing, only stared at him in surprise, mouth still open, and Harry decided to seize the rare opportunity of the blond's silence. "And I never kissed her. She kissed me. And then I ended things. For good."
"We can fucking hear you," Weasley grumbled, and Harry snorted.
"Potter, I'll be fine," Draco assured, gentling his voice so that the other man would also calm. "I promise I won't be gone long, all right?" It should not take too much time for Wisp to give Draco a name. Just one name, that was all he needed, and then he would be back to plot his merciless vengeance. He had promised Pansy the moment he learned of her fate and he fully intended to keep it.
"What are you doing here?" Harry blurted suddenly, startling himself into gasping again at the unexpected question; he was pretty sure he had not actually been intending to speak.
All he could do was pray that Harry did not notice his fingers trembling.
The wooden steps beneath their feet seemed to creak grim cautions to them as they ascended the staircase, groaning out a pained, portentous warning, but Harry simply could not tell what the house was attempting to say. The landing they now stood on was drenched in grey darkness, and Harry could see through the tall windows farther along the corridor that the sky outside was the color of cold cement, every cloud in the tempestuous heavens swollen with both rainwater and an ill-boding sort of virulent ire that seemed to match the air hanging over the heads of everybody locked away from the approaching storm, trapped behind dark walls the color of prison bars.
"I would call you a double knob in return," Pansy responded, "but all of us have yet to see actual proof that your knob really exists. So it looks like you're a sad lonely knob all by yourself. Not because you have one, but because you are one. You poor lonely little knobless knob."
"Tell us what it was like as you faced down You-Know-Who—"
"And why is that?" he asked in a harsh voice, but Harry knew the man and knew the tone had more to do with everything that had recently transpired.
"You know…" Harry shifted, "a, um…lubrication spell."
Draco shook his head, swiping angrily at his wet eyes. "No, Harry, it won't be okay! He fucking hates you! He won't stop until you're dead! Do you not understand that Fenrir is
Draco shivered, the words adding to the heat spreading through him like liquid fire, freezing him and burning him and melting him in place until all he could do was cling to Seek and hope the pleasure didn't break him.
"I will abandon the both of you right now if you're not careful," he warned. "And then we'll see how sad and miserable you are when I'm gone."
"I…" His words trailed off as a strange, haunted look crossed his face, the expression vanishing in the very next second. "After dinner, we came upstairs and found a bedroom. We Transfigured mattresses to sleep on because nobody wanted to sleep on the bed. I fell asleep first. Next thing I know, you lot are standing over me and Kevin is dead." His voice broke on the final word, eyes glassy and wide. "That's all I know, Hermione, that's all that happened."
for having such outstanding emotional control, right?
"We're not sure yet," Ron continued to shake his head. "Probably won't know 'til Cae gets here to look at it. And Harry?" He fixed the brunet with a piercing stare. "That wasn't the only box."
It was possible he might have been slightly biased at the time, however, he thought wryly.
Draco nodded shakily, nearly crying with relief with Fenrir finally climbed off him.
"What makes the two of you so certain there's something going on?" Harry mumbled, knowing there was no real lie he could tell about how he was feeling that they would not immediately see through.
"Tattoo…" Harry repeated, mind blank for several moments before remembering the large tattoo covering the upper half of his back. It was a grouping of black and white storm clouds, dark and thunderous and flashing with lightning. Harry had gotten it done the week after Sirius died. A crescent moon could be seen peeking above the inked tempest, nearly lost behind tumultuous clouds and streaks of angry, forked lightning.
"I like you as a panda," he grinned. "You're my sweet little Potter panda bear."
He needed time to grieve Pansy and time to miss his mother. Time to mourn for the friends lost and time to mourn for what his life had become—would he never stop paying for the sins of his fathers? Would everything always come back to the way he had been raised by Lucius, the same as Lucius had been raised by his father? When had the pattern begun and was it possible to break it?
The voice made Draco smile. It sounded so loving and concerned, as though the voice truly cared for Draco. It made him want to open his eyes to see the owner. The moment he tried, however, he groaned in pain as bright lights assaulted his vision, making his head throb.
Blaise turned to him with a shocked expression. "But where would be the fun in that?"
"I don't think it will take
"Right, bed…" Malfoy murmured, stepping even closer with an odd expression on his face.
"But Hufflepuff was always throwing secret parties," Blaise shrugged. "We haven't been to one since sixth year, but they were always dead decent parties. Say what you like about Hufflepuffs being daft wankers, but that lot knew how to fucking have fun. That last one at the boathouse got a bit crazy."
Setting the phone back down, Draco climbed into the shower, wanting to wash off every last trace of the stressful, worrisome day. He took his time washing his hair and scrubbing himself clean, hoping that when he emerged, Fenrir would be fast asleep.
"We'll need your finger," Hermione cut in, holding up the pot of ink.
And the way Harry had looked…green eyes flashing, ebony hair crackling with anger, perfect body tensed tight with delicious rage, standing in front of Draco and threatening anybody who even
Draco glowered at the other boy as Harry laughed. "Whatever you need to tell yourself, Zabini," he grinned, reaching down to twine his fingers with Draco's. The gesture made Draco relax somewhat, taking comfort in the warm touch.
"No," Hermione said with a shake of her head. "Both groups came back empty-handed. So I thought we would check again more thoroughly as one group."
"What, Draco?" Harry asked, feeling mesmerized by every word that fell from Malfoy's mouth. What was the blond trying to say?
"No," Draco pulled back far enough to murmur, lips stretched into a smile. "Draco Malfoy."
"F-Fenrir," he choked, unsure what else to say, how else to plead for the chance to be free. Was freedom really such a selfish thing to ask for?
Potter's eyes flashed and he stepped closer. "Daphne was sent something earlier, not too long ago, actually. A present." His voice was angry and dangerously low. A pleasant shiver passed through Draco at the threatening timbre, but he reminded himself to focus on Potter's words. They were apparently important.
Draco felt dizzy; he felt swept away and lost in the overpowering rush of sensation barreling over him, dragging him under; Blaise kissed him as he ran his hands over Draco's entire body, clutching and grasping handfuls of flesh as he groaned his desire aloud. "I give it to you and you take it so well," Blaise repeated with another sharp roll of his hips, and Draco whimpered and thrashed against the man's hold, desperate for all his words to come true, desperate to feel good, desperate to stop thinking, desperate to be taken, to be wanted, to be touched—desperate to be loved. "I want to hear you pleading for me, I'll make you beg for me. And then, Draco, when you do," Blaise continued, panting heavily as he flattened one palm against Draco's abdomen before slipping it beneath the drawstring of his pyjamas and wrapping long fingers around Draco's stiff cock, stroking teasingly along the shaft as he continued to speak in a breathy moan, "then I'll give you what you deserve."
This time, everything would be perfect.
Harry raised one eyebrow. "You mean Dodson?"
"I love you, Draco," he finally said, the words taking at least an eternity to penetrate Draco's ears and another eternity before they made sense to his baffled brain. Harry loved him? Is that what he had said? No, Draco must have heard wrong. Perhaps Potter had fucked him so hard his ears had broken. That was probably possible, right? Draco was sure that was what people were talking about when they warned youth of the dangers of sex. "I love you," Harry whispered, and Draco could no longer deny that his ears were in as perfect condition as ever.
This was the moment that would decide his entire future.
love slave?" Harry asked, flushing even harder as Ron laughed.
"Aaand, I'm done," Ron grumbled, pushing his nearly-empty plate away from himself as he muttered under his breath.
Draco returned the smirk. "And you are both so very welcome for the honor."
"Yes," Ron answered, staring at Harry without blinking. "Were you with Malfoy?"
The laughter suddenly stopped and Harry tensed, waiting.
," she said softly.
Both the words and the tone they were spoken in put an immediate halt to Draco's revenge fantasies. A
"Oh, you're an Auror?" Dean stepped closer to address Caelix, who was staring at Harry oddly.
"We still need to make a decision about Justin and Zacharias," Harry reminded her hollowly, feeling his mind whirl and spin from the terrifying and stressful situation.
"I don't like being forced into anything," Harry said, lowering his voice. "I felt trapped into accepting a gift I didn't want and I was angry and so I'm sorry that I left like that and I'm sorry that I took the broomstick and I'm sorry for all of it because I never meant to hurt you and I never wanted any of this to happen." He dropped his gaze to the floor and scuffed his shoe nervously. "I love you, Draco."
"No," Harry agreed, expression softening. "Not any more wrong." Leaning in, he pressed a gentle kiss to Draco's mouth. "This case has really been an eye-opener, you know, for the Auror department. I know when the attacks first started, there were more than a few Aurors who felt it wasn't worth the department's time, investigating the murders of Slytherins. Most of them didn't care about the answer, so why waste time with the question? Why try to help people they were sure would not want it? Why try to save those who didn't deserve saving?" A single tear slid down Draco's cheek without warning, startling the blond. Harry wiped it away with one thumb as he continued to speak. "I know that so many people still associate Death Eaters with Slytherins, but those in the department who once did are finally starting to see that they were wrong. They've finally started to realize that this is serious and it's dangerous and nobody deserves this sort of brutality. Evil can never negate evil, and the only thing vengeance does is further destroy lives. Anybody who can look at these attacks and not feel the slightest shred of sympathy is clearly a sick and unbalanced person. And anybody able to actually commit the acts themselves is beyond any amount of help. Not one of the Slytherins deserved it."
Harry placed a hand against the back of his neck. "So does being attacked."
Fenrir raised both eyebrows at him. "What, in our room?"
"And why didn't you go?" Malfoy asked with a curious lilt, sounding genuinely interested in the answer.
At that, Harry knew for sure he saw McGonagall's lips twitch. "I see," she said, shaking her head. "As pleased as I am to hear such impassioned declarations from a former student, that still does not answer the question of what you are doing in a school you no longer attend. I was under the impression that you had left your studies to pursue a career in Quidditch."
Groaning low into the kiss, Harry shoved him back against the edge of the desk hips-first, just as Draco’s hand closed around the quickly-hardening length of Harry’s cock and squeezed tight for Harry to thrust into.
Each of the trials had been one more step toward putting the whole business finally behind them, but for a time, the mood of the entire community could only have been called grim. It was no wonder that so many young witches and wizards of Harry’s generation seemed to be trying to move on.
of June.
He had expected some sort of marble monstrosity but what he found was just a normal bathroom, not so very different from those at Hogwarts only slightly fancier plumbing, and an unusual number of curtains.
As the blond man arched beneath him, meeting each of his thrusts, and Harry rapidly approached his limit of pleasure—half lidded green eyes caught on a swirling silver serpent inlaid in the elaborate black stone headboard on Draco’s bed.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco was glaring rather hard at the ceiling. Sans illusions there was only the tent’s black nylon up there, but Harry almost expected to see a burn hole where his gaze was currently fixed.
“I don’t like this at all, Mate. What if he’s planning to do horrible things to you the moment you let your guard down?”
"Potter,” he paused, speaking slowly, somewhat as though he were speaking to a small child. “There is a natural order to things. Some people are poor, some are exceedingly rich, that is just the way the biscuit breaks."
Out from under the tree’s cover it was raining a bit harder than he’d thought, but luckily it really wasn’t that far a distance. Safely beneath the restaurant’s black awning, he discovered they’d only got damp enough to make Draco annoyingly just a touch more attractive than usual. Rather than go on staring stupidly at him, Harry made an effort to take in the place he’d chosen instead.
“Roll over, Draco.”
“Er. Yes. You see, there are these Muggles, and the Dementors keep er, haunting them, sort of—well it’s just been a problem in parts of London recently that they’ve been asking us to deal with them as part of my Field Training, and I thought, why not try to improve the conditions some, and then possibly stop the Dementors propagating so much, and save everyone a lot of trouble.”
“What exactly were you just saying?”
Malfoy didn't seem in any real hurry to pull his arm away, despite watching the path of Harry’s fingers quite closely.
“I wasn’t sure what to expect,” he admitted honestly.
exceptionally sticky. He had to lick over its syrupy thickness very intently with his tongue before its viscosity truly dissolved—and the process was quite wetly noisy. Arching under Harry’s attentive mouth, Draco gasped, rubbing the long swell of his cock against Harry's stomach and smearing him with tacky sweetness too.
He backed Draco up against the edge of his kitchen counter, trailing sharp sucking bites from just beneath Draco’s chin to the base of his throat—pausing only to whisper a spell against soft skin that set Draco’s shirt to unbuttoning itself—and then Harry continued his trail of nipping and tongue-tracing down Draco’s chest.
Harry only groaned another complaint. “I don’t want to move.”
“Sure, probably. But it’s not up to us to meddle in these sorts of Muggle affairs. We’ve got our job, and they’ve got theirs; right?”
As stiff as his tone was, it occurred to Harry that he might actually be a bit nervous. “Don’t worry so much. It’s only Cassie.”
“Wow,” Harry breathed, momentarily too shocked to move.
Draco huffed crossly, and Harry’s lips pressed gently to his ear, starting to hiss again.
Draco huffed at him impatiently.
“S’fine, Gin. We were only talking, promise.” Harry held up his hands, illustrating his wand remained tucked safely away in his robes.
Draco was properly shuddering now, and Harry shifted down the bed and caught the tip of Draco’s cock between his lips, sucking wetly. Then, he hissed against the slit of it, stroking faster.
“You’ve cast it perfectly. If you think you’ve got a handle on the décor, then you’re ready. The other enchantments we can work out later in the week. We’ll start with the Extensions.”
They Transfigured the rest of the morning, right up to eleven-thirty, and they’d made a decent dent in shrinking stacks of sheets, adding to their growing pile of drapes, with less than half still to do—but the rest would need to wait.
The request caused a strange flutter in Harry’s stomach that the alcohol in his system did nothing to help. He was nervous, he supposed, of the notion that going anywhere with Malfoy in this state could lead to anything but trouble.
“It’s very far from glamorous.”
“You’re going to get me in trouble,” Harry pointed out.
He found Ginny at a small table at the edge of the dancefloor, watching the other dancers with no small amount of longing. Harry felt a twist of guilt as he pulled up a chair beside hers.
It had been a witness interview, and unfortunately hadn’t amounted to much in the end, but it got Harry away from his cubicle for an afternoon.
“Do it,” Draco ordered, the sound of his voice so raw with lust it was dizzying. “—
There had been many times in his life Harry had wished the Dursleys would’ve kicked him out, but he knew in truth—as horrid as they were—he had been lucky to have even his small cupboard, and later the second bedroom, warm and dry, and not forced to sleep alone on the streets of London.
” he groaned, low and tense with heat.
For the last few hours of the evening, they were busy Transfiguring lamps out of a large number of vases Draco had summoned from the manor’s cellar. He’d promised they weren’t cursed or enchanted in any way, but Harry still cast several scanning spells over the pile of them when he wasn’t looking, just in case.
“So long, Potter.”
“It’s my birthday,” Harry announced.
Draco sighed when Harry got a bit more soap in his palm and moved on, reaching down to wash between Draco’s thighs. It took a bit of doing to find and work all of the sticky honey residue from his skin. Harry started in on his balls, and in short time felt the prodding of Draco’s hardening prick between them.
“Right,” said Harry when Draco paused for breath—but it was not much of a pause.
“What about you?” Harry asked impulsively, if only to steer the conversation off his infidelity. Thankfully Draco usually liked talking about himself.
Through the heat Harry was determined to watch him, indefinable in the low light, and Draco watched him back with dazed silver darkness.
Harry couldn’t really challenge his arrogance when it was being applied so productively.
“Well, it might be…nice.”
Harry wanted to protest, but the gates were sliding open, and Malfoy was already stepping out of the lift. He might’ve pulled him back, but there were others milling about the main gates leading toward the atrium, and Harry didn’t want to attract any more attention than being himself did already.
“Gently then,” Draco whispered back.
“That you wanted to suck it?” Harry deviated.
?” he eventually blurted in confounded disbelief. “What the fuck are
“For me,” Harry prompted a bit more. “As in, more than one. Multiple…exceptions.”
“Little over your head, huh?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco sighed, but summoned some for him, quill and ink as well, and Harry took a seat at the table to write his reply.
“S’pose they were all Blacks once,” Harry considered.
“Cursed. Must’ve been quite bad, if it’s still here,” Draco mused thoughtfully, dipping one finger into the substance before he was raising it to trace a line across what remained of the curse’s cut on Harry’s cheek.
“You want to feel how pressing, Malfoy?”
Harry’s cock throbbed with painful demand, swelled dark and beading to come as he pulled out slowly, with an unsteady groan. “How do you want this?”
“Maybe we should think about Paris, what d’you think? Or Egypt! I’d love to see Egypt again.”
“I’m fine. As before, start slow, work up to hard.”
“What are the right words?” Harry inquired, not entirely following.
Closing the lid, he considered the box a moment longer before passing it back to Harry. “I don’t see why it wouldn’t. Shall we get started?”
When May 2
“Good morning, Potter.”
“It’s so late,” was all he could think to say, glancing up to the star-speckled breaks in the treetops above them.
“Good thinking, Potter.”
—” Harry didn’t get to his ‘and’ before said cock shot hot come and he was hurrying to catch it all in his mouth.
Draco quirked his eyebrow coolly. “How else do you think I manage looking this good all the time? I’m more than just a pretty face you know.”
“…Fuck’s sake,” Harry sighed, burying his face in his palms. “Why.”
“You don’t want another cuddle?” Harry pestered. Given how emphatically Draco had rejected the idea yesterday, he couldn’t really help poking fun.
That much had already started to occur to Harry, but— “You don’t see how that might be a problem for me? Did you miss the bit where I’m engaged?”
“It’s parsnip and leek.”
“You know it’s not always easy for me either. S’harder than it used to be.”
“What do you want to name him Draco?” She said softly, smiling at the image in front of her.
“It’s fine. With everything that’s happened, I honestly expected something like this.” Draco sighed at this. He had missed his mother terribly throughout the entire time he was dealing with his own issues, but he knew that she needed her space after father had died, and he was making sure that she got that. The last time he had spoken to Narcissa, was when Astoria had filed for divorce and he didn’t think her heart could take that as it was.
“Well then why do we feel like we’ve barely seen you?” Hermione had started pacing at this point.
“Don’t worry about it Teddy, just fascinated me is all. You can change what you look like in front of me all you want okay?” Teddy smiled at the words. He hugged Draco and when he pulled away, Draco watched as the boy changed his hair from the deep navy to a light sky blue. Draco was incredibly impressed with the talents that Teddy showed and couldn’t help but grin from ear to ear.
Draco slowly made his way up the steps to the guest bathroom. He set the clothes down on the counter by the sink and looked around the bathroom. He felt out of place in the small room, decorated with reds and golds. He smirked at the color placement and shook his head at the obvious Gryffindor decorating. Draco sighed, got undressed, and stepped into the shower. He could feel the muscles in his shoulders relax instantly, he leaned against the cool tile in the shower as the water ran over his back. He stood there for a moment, enjoying the heat, and then he looked around for any shampoo or soap. He spotted the small bottle off in the corner labeled, “shampoo” and applied it to his hair. The scent engulfed him quickly. The scent was strong of vanilla with hints of lavender. Draco melted into the scent as it filled the small space of the shower. There was something familiar and comforting to it that he couldn’t place. He took in the scent again until he finished washing up. He stepped out of the shower and dried off. He put on the clothes that Harry had given him. He took a look at himself in the mirror. The t-shirt hung on him slightly and the pants were just a bit baggy, but then again, Harry was always slightly bigger than him, and he guessed he’d lost some weight lately. He looked down at the clothes and noticed that there were tiny little snitches emblazoned against the maroon color of the pants, and the shirt seemed to have an old muggle band on it that Draco didn’t recognize. He shook his head at his appearance and headed out of the bathroom. He walked downstairs and fell into the armchair in the sitting room.
“Mornin’ Malfoy.” Draco looked up at the voice and saw his boss, Mr. Elowite, was cleaning a couple of potions vials as he walked in. Draco nodded and walked over to his desk.
When they arrived at their location, Draco could see the room in front of him, but couldn’t figure out why it looked so familiar. Had he been here before? He couldn’t remember, but his thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a voice that called out from across the room.
“Thank you, Daddy!” Teddy beamed. He hugged Harry around the legs and went back to his chair.
Once home Teddy devoured his food in an unrecognizable amount of time, raced to his bedroom and dove into his toys. Harry finished his meal a short time after, walked over to Teddy’s room and leaned against the doorframe. He smiled and looked in on the young boy, hair now a light bubblegum pink, eyes a deep brown, and holding a picture in his hand. Harry heard a small sniffle come from Teddy and walked into the room and sat down beside his godson. He had already known what picture he was looking at based on the color of his hair, it only turned that color when he was looking at one of Harry’s old photos of Teddy’s parents and 2 of Harry’s favorite people.
“Well of course! It was something I had never experienced in all my time as the Sorting Hat. Which is a long time might I add.” The Sorting Hat smiled remembering the years he’s had at Hogwarts.
“You alright Draco? You seemed to have gone paler than usual, which I honestly didn’t think that could be possible.” Harry had placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder and was looking into his eyes with such intensity that Draco could see the small flecks of gold that flitted in between the deep emerald that he knew so well.
Teddy jumped up instantly and wrapped his arms around the man's legs and Draco stood slowly to face him, they were almost the same height, the red-head just an inch or so taller.
somehow?”
Teddy finally spoke when Draco was face to face with him. “You’re the boy from the pictures Aunt Cissy brought over, aren’t you?” Teddy leaned his head to the side, as if he was analyzing Draco.
“Piss off, Potter.” And he was gone.
They stood there only for a moment until Teddy had run back into the room and broke the silence.
“Moony?” Both Harry and Draco asked Teddy in unison.
“Oh,” Andromeda tried to change her expression as soon as she noticed Harry’s worried face. “Yes Harry, he’s perfectly fine. It’s just -,” She sighed and looked down at the teacup that now sit between her hands. “It’s just that Ted and I, well, we’re a bit up there in our age and -.”
“Of course,
“You’re telling us, that not only has Malfoy been coming to your house, what, every night?” Ron looked at Harry for confirmation, and he responded with a nod, “And that he was over at your house on the weekend, He’s met Teddy and did I hear correctly that you called him Draco?” Ron looked at Harry once more for confirmation.
Draco looked at the woman, and noticed that there was no malcontent in her eyes, no maliciousness, no anger, just… care. Draco smiled one of the most genuine smiles he had ever had, took her hand and shook it gently. “Thank you for having me Mrs. Weasley. I’m very grateful to be here.” She blushed even more than she already was, which Draco didn’t think was possible and he smiled in response.
“I don’t remember the last time I laughed.” Draco’s smile finally fell.
“You’re not going to kick me out?” Draco’s eyes opened quickly at the words.
Teddy’s head shot up from the pillows and he looked at Harry eagerly. “Daddy?” He pressed.
. Draco looked back at the man once more and while noticing the pride in his face, he saw something completely different in his eyes. It was a look Draco had only seen from his mother, a look that she only reserved for him, never shown to anyone else, not even his father. It was
“Well Aunt ‘Mione calls you Draco, so it’s only fair.” He shrugged.
“Looks about 30 new ones today.”
“There has only been one person on this earth that deserved to die, and we both know who that is.” Harry had a sense of ferocity in his voice now that made Draco look up now, and he didn’t see pity in Harry’s eyes, he saw rage. “And you know what’s insane Draco, I tried to
“Yes, when it was put on my head, it talked about how if I was in Slytherin I would be destined for greatness, but being eleven and impressionable, I was told that all bad witches and wizards were put in Slytherin, so I just kept repeating “not Slytherin” under my breath until it changed my house.”
“Is he helping?” Teddy said hopefully.
“Daddy!” Teddy jumped from the chair that he had been standing on and rushed over to Harry, squeezing him around the legs.
“-aco? Can you hear me?” Harry’s voice floated into Draco’s ears, bringing him back to focus.
Thank you to anyone that is reading this! If you have any input on what should be in the story, or a way that I can improve, or just want to say something about this chapter, please do! I greatly appreciate feedback.
“Well, I guess it’s because when we went to school together, that’s what we did, we called each other by our last names.”
“If I remember correctly Ron,” Draco said, looking over to the red-head, “you’re always hungry.”
After he had finished his food, downed two glasses of whiskey, and reveled in his shit life, he looked at his side table and noticed the card. He stared at the card for a minute and finally admitted defeat.
Harry looked over at him and raised an eyebrow. “Draco?”
what happened our first year? There was a bloody
“If you do, as you say, hate each other, then why do you let him into your home? Why did you that first day?” Her question was soft, and a small smile played at the corners of her mouth. “And also, Potter, why would he have come to you in the first place? I assume you had run into him at some point and that is how he initially knew how to find you, and you being who you are, offered a helping hand or an ear. Would you have really offered if you truly hated him?”
“Monday after work, I had Draco come over and meet Teddy, mainly because I let slip on Sunday about Ted.” Harry shrugged.
Draco crossed his arms and huffed, but turned and looked at Harry with a smirk on his face. He turned back to face the sorting hat, “So how did he end up in Gryffindor if he was supposed to be in Slytherin?”
Harry stared at the two of them, confusion on his face now. “What is he talking about Draco?”
“As Teddy has said, I do already call you Draco, which you haven’t seemed to mind, I don’t mind if you call me Hermione.” She smiled softly and kissed Teddy on the forehead.
“What are you doing here Malfoy?” Harry said in surprise, before he could stop himself.
“I did. I never told anyone that I had started it because, to be honest, I don’t think anyone would have believed that I, of all people, said something nice about you, but I honestly did. I had said it behind a bookshelf in the library where I saw a group of Hufflepuffs sitting and they went from there.” Draco smiled proudly at the memory.
“Yeah, but I’m going to be honest, I didn’t know if you’d show.” Harry shrugged, running hands through his hair.
Harry smiled at this, “Ya know, those were some great times.”
Draco sighed. He noticed how quiet the house was without Scorpius running around, leaving toys in random places for him to find in the middle of the night. Stepping on miniature Hogwart’s Express’, kicking stuffed Norwegian Ridgebacks. He couldn’t stand how quiet it was in here, so he walked to the living room, turned on some music and sat down in his Armchair, one of the few things he kept from the divorce. He leaned back in the chair and his mind started to wonder. He thought about how sudden the divorce was, “I’m just not in love with you Draco.” He winced as he was reminded of the words Astoria had said when she had handed him the divorce papers. It was only 3 months ago but it still felt like it happened yesterday, the pain taking him over daily.
Harry sat back down on the couch and smiled at Draco and Teddy. “Well, I guess I’m going to have to believe you.” He shrugged. “So, what’s next then?”
“Asked the sorting hat not to sort me into Slytherin.”
Harry laughed and nodded. “That’s the point Draco.” He looked over at the blonde and saw the shocked expression on his face. “I let him do this the muggle way, make the biggest mess. It helps” Harry shrugged as Draco’s expression remained the same.
“Teddy… Lupin?” He had remembered his mother telling him that her sister, Andromeda, had a grandchild at the beginning of the war, his cousin, Nymphadora Tonks had married and had a child with his old professor, Remus Lupin. “He’s, my cousin, right?” Draco’s voice was small now, a lump in his throat had formed from looking at the picture of Harry with Teddy, making him think of his own child, Scorpius.
“Yeah.” Harry suddenly looked down at his feet, not understanding why he felt weird about the whole thing.
Harry shrugged and finally stood up, claiming defeat. “Thank you, McGonagall.” She stood with him and pulled him into a small hug to his surprise. He hugged her back, not realizing how much she had always meant to him as a parental figure until that moment.
But, standing in front of him, was not the same Harry Potter that Draco had remembered. The man in front of him had long almost black hair pulled up in a bun, secured by his wand, a few stray groups of hair that probably didn’t go all the way back hung gently in front and around the frame of his face. He was no longer young and skinny, in the years since they had last laid eyes on each other, Potter had aged, Draco couldn’t tell whether it was from time or from everything that they had gone through during and after the war, but it was definitely noticeable. He had gone from skinny and somewhat lanky, to having a toned and muscular build.
“Ted?” Draco looked at him curiously. He didn’t think Harry was into blokes before. “Is that why you said I had to be gone by 5? Your boyfriend coming home Potter?” Draco felt his cheeks flush, a bit embarrassed now, he knew he was intruding on Harry’s life, but he didn’t realize how much.
“Well maybe you should reach out to someone who might know the best way to handle this.”
“Honestly Hermione, I don’t think talking is going to work.”
Draco pulled another cigarette out of his pocket, lit it, and turned back to lean against the wall, trying to make it very clear that he would like to be left alone. He heard Potter sigh next to him and felt him move closer. Draco stiffened and kept his eyes forward, hoping Potter wouldn’t come close to him.
Harry laughed and stepped out of the floo. He dusted off his trousers and shirt and looked around and noticed that Draco was still standing in the archway.
“You what?”
“She knew what kind of place I’ve been in.” Draco sighed softly. He looked up at Harry, who carried an intense, questioning look on his face that urged Draco to go on. “I’ve been…” He took a deep inhale and looked down at his hands, unable to say the words out loud, he’d never spoken them before. He jumped slightly when he felt Harry’s hand on top of his own. Draco looked at the deep olive that contrasted against his own pale white. He noticed small freckles along Harry’s knuckles. There was a small squeeze around his hand and he looked up at Harry.
“But daddy went to school with Uncle Ron and Aunt ‘Mione and he doesn’t call them by
“Well, when I was eleven, before I even know that I was a wizard, I set a python on my cousin at the zoo.” Harry chuckled at the memory. “There’s that, and the fact that I was almost sorted into Slytherin, so there’s that.”
Draco shook his head slightly, trying to get back in the right headspace. “What would it matter to you Potter?” Draco spat at his former childhood enemy, “Want to try and help if I’m not?”
“Sorry about that McGonagall.” Harry smiled and walked over towards her desk and rustled Teddy’s hair. “Do you still have the sorting hat sitting around here somewhere?” He looked up and his eyes wandered around the room.
Draco smiled slightly at the memory, even though the pang in his heart reminding him that he would no longer hear her pleads to quit smoking, or see his son daily, and lit the cigarette. He took a deep inhale, feeling the drop in his stomach ease, and exhaled, watching the smoke dissipate in front of him, just like everything else really. Suddenly he heard the door to the pub open and shut, but he didn’t bother to even look up, he knew that he was imagining things, that his mind was playing tricks on him again. Or at least he thought it was.
Harry slapped some muggle money on the bar, enough that he knew would be more than what he and Eric had drank. “Keep the change Bert.” Harry said as he rushed out the door of the Pub.
“Please, Draco,” He remembered Astoria saying quietly one night after he had just come back inside from one of his nightly breaks, “Stop this nonsense. I would like you to still be alive and healthy enough to watch Pius grow up. It’s horrible for your health, smoking those things.”
“Erm, well I guess if you don’t mind.” Draco twisted his fingers together. “But are you sure your clothes will fit? You’re like, twice my size now.” Draco questioned, looking over Harry’s frame, noticing the obvious size difference from the boy he remembered in school.
“Hello Molly.” Harry smiled and took the woman in his arms into a big hug, one that looked as though Harry was about to snap in half. They stepped apart and Harry stepped to the side and smiled widely to her and then back to Draco. “Molly, I’d like to properly introduce you to Draco Malfoy.” He nodded to Draco and finally let go of Draco’s wrist, which Draco had noticed that he had still been holding, even during the hug between him and Mrs. Weasley. “Draco, this is Molly Weasley. This is the mother I never got to have, but was wonderful enough to love me as one of her own. Also, one of the best damn cooks I have ever met in my life.”
Harry looked down at the new list of cases on his desk, no doubt put there by Kingsley early this morning. He sighed and dove into his paperwork. It had only been about 2 hours since he had started in on the cases when he heard a knock at his door. He waved his wand behind his head to open the door. He had turned to see who had come in when he noticed a head of bushy brown hair poking in through the door frame.
“Scared?” Draco’s voice was filled with venom at this point. “You were scared?” He laughed loudly, making Harry look up at him, his face wide with surprise at his laughter. “I had fucking Voldemort breathing down my neck for Salazar’s sake. I was terrified he would kill my parents. Can you imagine that feeling Potter? Can you?”
Harry was struck with a moment of, well, he wasn’t sure what to call it, sadness? Pain? Empathy? He really didn’t know what to call it, he just knew that something in his gut had told him that whatever Malfoy was going through, he needed to help. “Drink?” Harry said lightly, still watching Malfoy as he massaged his head.
“What happened mate?” Ron’s face suddenly scrunched up and looked worried. “Is Teddy okay?”
“This is incredible Harry, but why?” Draco looked incredibly confused at the choice of tattoo.
“And I’m still not going to Draco.” Draco looked over to see a playful grin across Harry’s face that made his chest tighten, but he didn’t know why. He heard Harry whisper a location but he still couldn’t make out what he had said, so he crossed his arms and huffed again.
Draco stared at the card a little longer after Potter had left him in front of the pub. It was getting colder outside due to it getting later, but he pulled out another cigarette and looked at the card again.
“Yes, I would love to keep Teddy.” Harry nodded with enthusiasm to the woman who sat opposite him. He couldn’t believe it. He would be able to have Teddy here, in his home, all the time. Harry stared at her in disbelief, trying to wrap his head around the thought of it, and he knew that there was nothing better in his life that could happen in that moment.
Finally, Malfoy spoke, quietly, and looking at his hands, which were thin and looked as though he was starved. “You’d even be willing,” he hesitated for a moment before continuing, “be willing to help me?” He looked up at Harry, there was a pleading look in his eyes that Harry had only seen once before, up in the Astronomy tower the night Dumbledore died. Harry winced at the memory but kept a straight face as the man continued to look at him.
“I’m sorry.” Harry whispered, his voice catching in his throat. He didn’t know how much he had wanted to say that to Draco until now. He had always regretted that decision and now it was thrown into his face. “I’m so sorry Malfoy. I was scared, we all were.”
Harry picked up Teddy and placed him gently in his lap, they boy had slunk into Harry’s chest, holding the photo even tighter. “Can you tell me the story Daddy?” Teddy whispered into Harry’s chest softly.
“Alright.” Ron slapped his knees and pushed himself up out of the chair. “You gonna come by the pub tonight this time?”
“Yes, he’s been coming to my house nightly. He came over Saturday and we finally talked after I went and saw McGonagall. And he came back by on Sunday which is when I let slip about Teddy so naturally I had him come by yesterday to meet him.”
“I wish you wouldn’t have though.” Draco spoke softly now. He couldn’t look at Harry now, but he knew the expression those emerald eyes would have. He knew that Harry would have pity in his eyes, and Draco didn’t want to see that. He didn’t want Harry to pity him.
“And Malfoy?” Harry called after him. Draco turned around on the spot. “Please shave. I’d like Teddy to see what the Draco Malfoy I grew up with looked like. He doesn’t need to think that half-ass grown beards are something to be proud of. I’d rather him think beards like mine are something to aspire to.” Draco almost went off when he noticed Harry had a huge grin on his face, trying his hardest to hide his laughter, and Draco smiled.
“Yeah, they’re from when I was smaller.” He was running his hand through is hair again.
“Oh…” Ron hung his head; he knew that this wasn’t easy for Harry when that happened to Teddy. “Well I’m sure he’ll be okay mate. You know that doesn’t last long. What color was his hair when he woke up?”
“Of all of the people in the world that could get the sorting hat to change it’s sorting, of course it would be you.” Draco laughed and turned back to the sorting hat. “Thank you so much for answering our questions. I thought he’d been lying about it all.” The sorting hat nodded and went back to sleep as the two men walked back to McGonagall and Teddy.
“You didn’t?”
“Guest bathroom is at the top of the stairs, second door on the right.”
Teddy’s eyes went wide with realization. “I’m sorry Uncle Draco! Here, let me.” Teddy hopped off his step and stood next to Draco. “You have to measure out all of the dry ingredients and mix them together. Here’s what you need to measure out.” A piece of parchment appeared in front of the two of them. “Just follow this and Daddy and I will mix the wet ingredients.”
