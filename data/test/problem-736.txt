He surmised that Draco felt it too when he drew slowly off of Harry's prick, focusing his tongue on the underside of the head and pumping the shaft with his hand. Harry swallowed a low moan in a gulp of air. Lubricious saliva coated his length and Draco's pace quickened.
“Wait.” Draco held up a hand, turning to Dobby. “That’s not a good—” The sound of the disapparation had him sighing. “idea,” he finished to the empty air.
A startled laugh escaped Potter. “That’s a twist on the saying. I kind of wanted to be your knight.”
“We went to The Gateways too,” he says. “Saw McGonagall there.”
somehow got hold of this,” Harry gestures between them, “I wouldn’t let them hound you?”
“Potter?”
“Congratulations, Potter,” Draco said as he stopped in front of the golden trio. “You didn’t die.”
When the road ended, he looked around curiously, he had never gone too deep into the village before.
It wasn’t until they reached the table did Potter speak.
Potter rolled his eyes, and Draco really wondered what he had ever seen in Potter to begin with.
“We’ll have to use Umbridge’s fire to see if we can contact him.”
Draco let out an exaggerated gasp but paused at the bottom of the stairs to kiss Harry’s cheek in greeting.
brings its love affair with Harry Potter to an abrupt end. Draco can’t say he plans to mourn the loss of vapid pseudo-journalism like the scintillating article from a month prior about Potter purchasing some new socks, but the rambunctious, gleeful tone recounting the moments leading to the demise of Potter’s perfect little set-up with Ginny Weasley leaves a bitter taste in Draco’s mouth. He too has been on the receiving end of salacious gossip columns that pass judgment on his hedonistic lifestyle. Even the word socialite—so frequently used in connection with Draco—implies a frippery and ease to his existence that woefully misrepresents most of his post-war years. He flicks through the paper, still crisp and inky, taking in the wildness of Potter’s eyes and the furious set of his jaw as he pushes through the throng of photographers lined up outside his small cottage in Godric’s Hollow to document his fall from grace.
“My grandfather, Abraxas, had a prophecy made about him. My father likes to go down there to look at it, even though he can’t touch it.”
“Would you really have done so?” Draco asked seriously. He ignored the way Black’s head snapped to his and ignored the anger on his face, he ignored the way his fists clenched to the point his knuckles turned white.
Despite the lack of noise, he could feel their stares on him, but he wasn’t going to disrupt the calm. Sometimes, the absence of something was preferable.
Draco closed his eyes. What did his father want from him? Perfect scores? He tried, relentlessly. Why couldn’t that be enough?
“I hope you don’t expect me to carry the other side of that banner of yours.” Draco points to the furled-up roll of canvas propped against the wall. He already knows it says
Draco sighed again and stretched his back muscles after Vanishing all the owl pellets and food remains. He then proceeded to bring in a new bale and distributed the hay evenly on the wooden floor. Draco had never thought he’d enjoy manual labour, but he genuinely liked caring for the owls — and getting rid of their excrements was just one task of many which needed to be done to make them feel comfortable and cared for.
.” Harry gives Draco another heart-stopping kiss. “If I wanted to tell them about Little Compton Street, what would you think?” He pauses, worrying his lip between his teeth, his expression so earnest. “If I wanted to tell them about us, maybe. That too.”
“Anything,” Harry says. His voice is shaky. “I’ll do anything.”
“You mean Old Compton Street? I’m a gay man who spends a significant portion of his time in the Muggle world. Yes, I’ve come across Old Compton Street.” Draco chooses not to mention he also has a passing familiarity with the Chariots in Vauxhall, because he suspects Potter would get that air of judgment about him at the idea of visiting a sauna, no matter how easy he seems for an attractive smile these days. “I’m amazed you haven’t, although it seems as though you spend most of your time in East End establishments where they serve drinks out of jam jars.”
A lot worse.
Draco pushed the door open further, the action caused a small creak that drew the attention of the Weasley twins.
Potter pulls a face. “I’m on holiday.” He seems put out about it, and Draco strongly suspects there’s more to it than that. He wonders what on earth might compel the Ministry to let their brightest star take an indefinite leave of absence to mooch around London and strike up conversations with former Death Eaters.
Paul sighs. “Wizards can’t half be arrogant twats thinking they’re impervious to everything. There’s plenty that can’t be remedied with magic, and it’s not just this.”
“—I don’t know why he hasn’t introduced us before.” Augusta’s voice had Draco annoyed before she ever walked in, but there was no stopping that.
Draco frowned as he looked up to where Severus sat at the High table. Severus had believed that Black wasn’t a murderer, that perhaps he was innocent—at least an implied innocence.
There was a pause before Potter smiled slightly. “I want to take my time. I want to be able to know who I am in my twenties, thirties or even my forties. I don’t want to know it all right now. I want to discover who I am slowly, but steadily increasing as I get older.”
Draco’s lips thinned as he ran a hand through his hair. Granger would probably know, but he wasn’t sure he wanted to give up the pride it would cost to ask.
Draco turns to face Harry, whose features are etched with panic. The red glow from the
“What just happened?”
“I’m…” Harry’s sentence leaves him in a shudder and the damp heat of his climax spreads between them.
“It’s alright,” Neville whispered. “I’ll be fine.”
“Cryptic.”
“And the other house elves? How are are they treating her?”
Faith was stupid, unwise and idiotic, but it didn’t surprise Draco that Potter did so anyway. He just wished it was on someone worthier.
“Both.” Potter smiled somewhat shyly, and Draco realized exactly what Weasley meant.
“I can’t imagine why you’re not putting any effort into finding a boyfriend,” Draco says, a little waspishly. “You don’t seem like the type to fuck around.”
“Are you alright?” Draco asked as the silence stretched, and the air around them grew stifling.
“I think you’re odd.”
“I said
“Certainly not. I use my phone to conduct business, you imbecile.”
“Draco.” The long-suffering sigh had Draco smirking at the ceiling. “Just forget about everything else and just try, alright? Try and do a patronus.”
It was the platform mentality all over again. His father was granted a platform to spew his beliefs, and it was working. Society being as impressionable as they were, made his father's plan
“Should Dobby visit Harry Potter?”
Draco expected her to fight, to keep spewing nonsense, but she did neither. He watched the Auror’s take Umbridge out of the Great Hall. It ended up anti-climactic, really.
He looked up to the ceiling as his eyes began to sting once more. Draco had always wanted his father to be proud of him. As a child, he had sought his father’s approval, just so he could hear those words—but they had never come.
Ginny waves her hand. “Don’t be sorry, I’m teasing you.”
to Regulus, wished that his cousin was still alive.
Draco puts everything into his next kiss with Harry, to make absolutely certain that Potter will spend the rest of the night thinking about what he could have been doing with Draco.
Harry nods. “I used to come here for a pint after work with Ron, sometimes. Nobody pays any attention to what you’re saying.”
“Right away Master Lucius.”
“Excuse me,” Draco interrupted anything else she might have said. “Two things here. One, where do I fit into this? And two, you have an invisibility cloak?”
It’s odd, seeing Potter quiet and thoughtful. He’s usually so full of bombast and an almost tireless energy, his pensive expression and the cloudiness which passes over his handsome features reminds Draco of the way Potter looked during the Wizengamot trials, or in the
“Come in.”
It had been a warning for sure, Draco just wasn’t sure what exactly she was trying to hint at.
Draco rolled his eyes but said nothing. His silence could be an agreement if interpreted correctly.
When the door fully opened, and the grumblings continued, Draco wondered if they were at the right house. The person at the door had their head turned behind them over their shoulder and they didn’t seem to care that people were at the door.
“My thoughts?”
would be reason enough.”
Draco glances at Harry who still seems preoccupied. There’s a shame in Harry’s expression that Draco wants to chase away.
Ah, there it was. Draco had finally found the chapter about mending bones, and was now trying to figure out how many drops of Skele-Gro he could safely administer to Git in order to heal his wing. Thank Merlin, all the potions and ingredients from the Manor — at least those which weren’t confiscated by the Ministry — were also in Draco’s trunks. Buying potions really was out of the question with his meager funds.
Before Potter could respond, a group of people rushed towards them. The Weasley family, Lupin, Moody, and an old woman he didn’t recognize.
“Attention to those who don’t want it never sounds as good as to those who seek it.”
“Do you?” The triumph in Moody’s eyes let Draco know that he had been baited.
“I’m confused,” Draco admitted as he bit his lip. If Severus hadn’t taught Potter any safety measures, then what had he done? “How do your lessons usually go?”
“No.” Harry gives Draco the same steady smile. “How is it being Draco Malfoy?”
“I wasn’t
“Then you guess, you arse.”
“They say he’s a murderer,” Potter whispered as his eyes looked around the area.
Draco sighed as he looked through yet another book on Dark rituals. He had tried to find anything that could fit into what Regulus had hinted at, but it had been futile. He had found a number of horrible and sickening Dark rituals, but none of them even came close.
Draco closed his eyes as he tried not to hesitate. Did that make him a bad person? If he did nothing, it would be exactly what his father would want. If he did nothing, there could be no fallout that would harm him. If he did nothing, he would simply be an observer.
Draco fell silent as the words left him. Talking to the dog had been therapeutic in a way. He was no longer afraid of the silence in his mind, and perhaps it was for the best to stop talking to animals that couldn’t talk back.
Draco tried to withhold a laugh, but his shoulders shook. “What would you call it then? He’s in the hospital wing.”
“Possibly.”
“We’re nothing of the sort,” Draco says, horrified. “I hope you’re not going to make a nuisance of yourself.” What’s even more horrifying is the pleasant twist in Draco’s stomach, the light flutter of excitement at the thought of more conversations with Potter.
Why did it have to be something else? Why wasn’t the simplest answer the right one? Why couldn’t they all just see that it had been his own stupidity that was the issue?
. If I don’t stay angry with him, I might become him.”
“The barman at the Christopher Street Inn told us about Jonathan Ashton, earlier.” Draco glances at Harry who once again looks deep in thought, churning over half-told stories that don't have a firm beginning or end.
“Me too.” Harry begins unplucking Draco’s shirt with his sure, deft fingers. “Even when we have more time together than I've had with anyone, it still doesn't feel like enough.” His voice dips, lips warm on Draco's skin. “I want to be the best fuck, keep you coming back for more.”
“Thank you?” Neville scooted away slowly, and Draco couldn’t help but snort.
“I’m not sure.” Draco frowns and takes in the bars, many of which have thick layers of dust on their windows. He moves closer to one, rubbing his hand over the glass but all the grime seems to be on the inside, not the out. Draco can’t shake the image of a past full of dreams never fully realised. Where did all the witches and wizards of Little Compton Street go, when Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade have no more spaces for them than they did all those decades ago?
“The ring?” Harry holds his hand up and studies it, giving Draco an opportunity to admire it in the candlelight. He really does have excellent hands. “It was my dad’s wedding ring. I found it with Sirius’s diary when I was going through things at Grimmauld Place. I’m redecorating.” He touches his fingers to the leather band on his wrist. “This belonged to Remus. Professor Lupin,” he clarifies.
Potter laughed lightly as he locked eyes with Draco. “The moment I became a Gryffindor.”
“It was tense at first, that’s a given, but he was a bit calmer. At least until—” A sheepish shrug paused Potter’s retelling. “—It’s my fault, really. Before the lessons he always empties memories in a pensive, and I got too curious.”
“What else happens in a perfect world?”
Draco stopped near the entrance of the Great Hall to peer at the Weasley twins curiously.
“Exams are over and Umbridge has left. I think this calls for a feast, don’t you all?”
A scream that was not his own caused Draco to tilt his head from his position on the floor until he could look at his father, who had been on the receiving end of the curse.
Shaky fingers grabbed the letter, not happy that it had been five months since the last one.
Dobby’s ears fell as he looked to the ground.
“Then act like it.”
“None of this is making any sense,” Granger cried loudly. “There is no proof that Sirius is at the Ministry.”
“I know.” Harry stops what he’s doing for a minute and pushes a hand through his hair. “We both might be shit at relationships. Open relationships work for people. I’m not there now and I’m not sure I’ll ever be. But I’ll tell you. If that changes, I’ll tell you.”
"It's alright, Hermione. I get it." Harry says calmly, wading into the conversation to lull the tension beginning to brew. "This thing with Draco, I know that he has it in him. I just wish I could help him with this bit."
"Still takes some getting used to though, doesn't it?" Ron says casually, letting his gangling arms hang down the sides of the chair. "It'd be a bit weird snogging 'Mione all the time with you right there and all."
"Don't be daft, you told me you'd be busy. Anyway, I've had a ton of time to write to Ron and Hermione. Ron's been sending me letters every other day complaining that his brother Charlie keeps beating him at chess."
Harry jumps up too but his way is immediately blocked by Ron, finally free of Hermione's grip. She twists on the bench to look between them but Harry isn't getting any overtly concerning vibes from either of them. He doesn't let it slow him.
Draco tenses but his voice is suspiciously light when he next speaks, "Am I much like her, then?"
Harry looks around the common room, at faces both familiar and new to him; two fourth year students arguing with a portrait about the benefits of mandrake root, Nearly Headless Nick describing the Headless Hunt with fervour to a cluster of awestruck first years, a muggle-born explaining in detail how a lightbulb works to her guffawing friends from wizarding backgrounds, Ginny shuffling past with a wobbling shampoo bottle balanced on top of a stack of towels and pyjamas. None of it would have been possible if they'd chosen to stay passive, if they'd lay down and waited for Voldemort to crush everything they held dear.
"I don't know - yeah - yeah, I guess I do."
"What about you? Do you miss it? Flying, I mean?"
"You have that in common with Ginny, you know. She loves nothing more than to wind Ron up."
Self inflicted isolation, too. He'd taken himself away from his friends, from all who cared for him, locked himself away in the darkest prison cell of his own making because he thought they would be safer for it. All that had done was cause despair and pain to all parties.
The surreality of returning to a normal schedule washes over Harry. He's had the summer to adjust but that time was spent at the Weasley's, where Fred's death permeated every inch of the home. There had been no routine. Everyone had ambled around, startled when they bumped into one another. Meals were sometimes held in a solemn bubble, other times that bubble would burst and they could remember Fred where laughter and tears were never separable. The kitchen was frequently crowded but a chair beside George was always left vacant, and none of them could decide whether the sight was a comfort or not.
"Is this okay?" Harry asks, the paradigm of politeness.
"No, I don't think so. There's something holding you back and I want to know why."
Harry understands the cost of isolation. After Cedric's death, after Voldemort's return, he'd strained for any news of the wizarding world. It had seemed like everything had blown away like smoke, leaving him behind choking amidst smouldering ashes and charred wood. No matter how hard he had tried to dig through it all, no matter if he found the smallest spark of news, it would die in his hands and he'd be left all alone again. That is, until the dementors came to Little Whinging. He'd been almost glad to see them, to see some confirmation that magic still glowed beneath the murky debris.
The idea of that stops Harry in his tracks. Where will that leave them? Will Draco go back to pretending Harry doesn’t exist? Turn back into another one of Hogwarts’ ghosts, a quiet presence in the back of the classroom? At the end of the Slytherin table in the Great Hall?
Harry shakes his head. This is why he didn't want to tell them about it. "Come on, stop looking at me like that. I'm not obsessed with Malfoy or anything. It's not my fault he's always acting suspicious."
"Not a fan of Side-Along Apparition, are we?"
A delicate cough cuts off Hermione’s lament over Ron’s laziness. All three of them look up as a unit, as synchronised as Fluffy the three-headed dog, to find Draco hovering self-consciously behind Harry.
The sadness here is diluted. Harry feels guilty for being glad about that.
Harry, ever the diplomat, shrugs. "I think magic is brilliant but I'm definitely with Hermione on the middle ages front."
"You're right, I was being bloody selfish." Ron finally sighs. "You want to be with your parents for the same reason that I wanted you to be with me - you're family, you both are." Ron adds, shifting to include Harry. "I was stuck on the idea of making this Christmas perfect - knowing that Fred won't be there and - I just wanted everything to feel normal. I'm sorry that I didn't listen to you."
"May I come in?"
"Draco, that - that's - "
in that did you hear an apology?"
Harry doesn't know what to do; he tries to make himself appear busy, fiddling with the loose yarn of his lumpy hat, turning away while his best friends work through whatever they need to.
"You're great - I mean, it's great. Everything is...great."
Truth be told, it
“I want to apologise,” Draco continues hurriedly, the blush on his face growing deeper but he doesn’t allow his eye contact to drop to the floor. Instead, he tips his chin up, shoulders squared like he’s braced for impact. “For everything. I’ve treated you abominably over the years. It is unjustifiable. I was petty and childish, and incessantly jealous of you. I can’t take back the pain I know I’ve caused but I’d like to atone for it from this point onwards - if that’s acceptable to you.”
"Shut up, Malfoy. It's usually something to do with sweets - or it was when Dumbledore was headmaster." Harry adds in a mumble.
"It's not - we're
. Fudge Flies."
McGonagall had been right to stress the importance that they remain united. The smallest fracture may grow into a crevice if left unattended. Harry can never turn his back on Draco, he knows better than anyone the way in which isolation eats away at your brain.
Harry raises an eyebrow and draws out the hawthorn wand, the tingling tremor of energy surging up to meet and welcome his grip. Truth be told, this bond makes him deeply uncomfortable though not because of who the wand belongs to, rather the simple fact that it doesn't really belong to
Harry picks up the now broken telephone and casts a quick
what she means. "You have that look on your face. The one that means you're thinking of doing something either incredibly stupid or incredibly noble."
Hermione pushes her plate away and folds her arms across her chest. She has that gleam in her eye, the one that comes about either when she's about to get
"You didn't know them!" Harry says sharply.
"Draco, as someone who was where you are now, there will always be people waiting to reach out and pull you back in."
Harry checks off everything he's packed, grateful for Hermione taking pity on him and casting an Undetectable Extension Charm on his backpack to save him hauling his trunk about: a ball of wrinkled clothes that he's sure will earn him Draco's disapproval, his toothbrush, several copies of Seeker Weekly that he's yet to get around to reading, a multitude of odd socks...
"A little." Draco confesses, his hands fiddling with the handle of his mug like he doesn't know what else to do with them.
I essentially had to start from scratch. Major bummer, absolutely devastated, we're ploughing on regardless.
Ron frees himself from the confines of the scarves, every inch of his freckled face drawn tight by unhappiness when he looks over Hermione. Harry finds himself troubled as he watches because although Ron and Hermione still bicker every other day, it's never about anything serious and it's always said with a gentling smile to extinguish any heat that might have lingered otherwise.
"What happened to you?!"
"For the love of Merlin, why are you always following me?!" Draco echoes Harry's thoughts aloud but he doesn't sound mad, only fed up.
"Bruise easily, Potter?" Draco asks lightly.
"Some Christmas this'll be," Ron says glumly. "With you off carolling with the Malfoy's and Hermione - "
to sleep in the same room as an ex- Death Eater.
Harry turns in time to catch the handle of a broomstick hurtling his way, narrowly avoiding broken glasses. Draco is standing there, dressed down in a black turtleneck jumper and well-worn tailored trousers, the silver and green scarf cast lazily around his neck like an afterthought, not bothering with a coat and settling for his cloak despite the freezing day. He is, however, lightly holding his Nimbus 2001 in one hand.
that. I deserved it. I kept waiting for you to pull the rug from beneath my feet but you never did. True to your word, you
Harry feels the pang of guilt in his stomach at that. "I know, I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner but it came out of nowhere, I didn't know what to say."
"It's alright if you missed that, Potter, because you're going to be seeing a lot more of - "
Harry reaches for one on instinct, knowing from his experience of her being Gryffindor's head of house that to refuse would only annoy her more but Draco, quite unused to such treatment, stares at the tin in astonishment.
"A boggart." Harry breathes to himself in confirmation, beyond relieved by the knowledge that he isn't taking on Lucius Malfoy. Safe. Everyone is still safe.
"Just about holding on. How about you?"
“Yes?”
Harry drops onto the carpet between them, stretching his legs out toward the fireplace. He watches a lost knight from a wizard's chess game gone wrong running about beneath Ron's seat, bumping into the spindly feet of the armchair.
Draco doesn't even move, not really. He just leans in, grey eyes transfixed on Harry's mouth with an intensity as if he's lip-reading. Harry can tell that Draco means to make this count but is trying to understand how to do that and Harry, silently, hopelessly, urges him on until he can feel Draco's quiet, hot gasps on his lips.
"It'll be dark before we play at this rate, Potter! What else would you like to know about the apple? The orchard from which it was plucked? Its state of ripeness? Get a move on!"
Draco tilts his head, squinting at Harry like he can't completely make him out in the dark. Minutes crawl by like this, enough for Harry to start fidgeting under the intensity of it, until finally Draco lets out a sigh so quiet Harry isn't at all sure he'd even heard the sound. Draco pushes off from the wall, stopping only to retrieve his bag.
Okay, so there's this. If I'm being honest with you, I have no idea how long this is going to be (at the moment, I have an idea of 8 chapters from start to finish) but it's not likely going to be over 50,000 words. Also, I'm uploading as I write instead of my usual finish-it-all-with-no-pressure-over-2-years-then-upload-it-in-one-go thing so I'm not sure how often updates will be.
"The war brought on this rush of emotions for the both of us, we were terrified that the other wasn't going to survive and we just - we collided together again because of that fear. In the moment it felt right but after, when everything was done and the world felt too...quiet - it's like we could hear each other again and we realised we'd fallen out of sync."
"What - you know?!"
"Oh, come off it, Draco."
He's fully aware that he's not the only one avoiding the Quidditch pitch. He knows better than to ask Draco why
The Fat Lady smooths down the front of her pink silk dress and narrows her eyes at him, "Beg your pardon but the length of time in which you are gone does not negate the fact that you are out of bed when you shouldn't be! I'll be informing the headmistress of this!"
And Harry? Harry finds himself no longer pitying Draco but rather admiring him. It takes nerve - an unquestionable practicality too - to not only throw yourself back into schoolwork amongst peers who hate you at worst and distrust you at best, but to allow yourself to be vulnerable to a person you've actively fought against for the past seven years. If their positions had been switched, if Harry had been the one faced with a choice of struggling on his own or opening up to Draco's scrutiny, he's not sure he'd have had the sense to humble himself as Draco had.
"If you is sure, sir." Ploddy says. Then - "I is hearing from the Hogwarts house-elves that you is a great wizard. It is an honour to meet you."
hoping to have this up before Christmas but the second wind I was waiting for never came even though I managed to squeeze out not one but TWO unrelated oneshots in between updates.
Harry shakes himself out of the daze and apologises to Professor Sprout, turning to Filch who is sat in a quiet nook of the room, the only other figure in the room. "Mr. Filch? Professor Slughorn needs you in the dungeons. There's been an accident - some potion spilt on the floor - he says to bring your mop."
It had taken Draco a while to realise that he was spared being berated not because she was ignoring him but because she felt like he was actually putting in the work. He tried not to feel too smug about it whenever he caught Potter's eye over the table when Granger was launching into one of her lectures.
Draco flounders, blushing brilliantly, and draws his cloak tightly around his body to stave off the cold. "With reason. Don't you understand that I'm trying to spare you. You shouldn't be seen with me, I'm - I'm no good."
Harry is nauseated thinking about it. To be so scared of your own father as to use him as a weapon against others? No wonder Draco can be flinty, no wonder he can so often be guarded. Harry had never held any illusions about the Dursley's, he'd always known that they were repulsed by him but he can't begin to imagine the push and pull of a father who loved you at one moment and despised you the next, the sort of effect that that can have on your frame of mind.
"Come on, Potter. Let's not act stupid, shall we? We've been sworn enemies for years. I made your life miserable at every turn, whenever I could. I bullied your friends, I mocked the death of your family, I tried getting your favourite groundskeeper fired, I joined up with your actual mortal enemy and came close to murdering our headteacher on...on
"Before you answer, let me just say this; I did all of this because you seem hellbent on wheedling your way into my life and - and I've not the energy to stop you anymore. I have no one else to ask, otherwise I would just - I know the Manor holds memories for you that you'd rather forget. It's bad enough that I have to - well, never mind that. What I'm trying to say is, don't say you'll come out of your insufferable do-gooder complex. I think you deserve more than that and - and maybe so do I."
Draco gives him a searching look, "Right. Well, shall we begin? I'll give you the grand tour."
"What if they betray us though? What then?" Ron demands.
Draco looks at him like he's out of his mind - then like he wants to punch Harry. He glances around the corridor but they're alone. "You don't mention that. Ever."
"Did you ever stop to consider that perhaps I want to?"
The words lack the bite they might have had a few years prior but it still gives pause to what Harry plans to say next.
"She didn't understand you? Really, Potter?" Draco interjects. "Give her some credit."
"No, I don't." she says slowly. "I think if we'd come back a year from now, it would still be just as painful. I think I want to - to heal and replace last year with something better."
"Draco? My wand." Harry presses with urgency, reaching an insistent hand out for it.
"I know," Draco says, the fury on his face sliding off to leave a blank mask in its stead and Harry starts to think that he's miscalculated Malfoy, that he's messed everything up - but then, Draco plucks his wand from Harry's fingers. The Dark Mark vanishes with a single swift tug and the soft swish of fabric. "That was always my problem."
spell to finally find his way out; Harry walked the edges of the frozen pond, remembering his last excursion to a similar body of water, his foolhardy attempt at retrieving a horcrux which had almost cost him his life had it not been for Ron.
"Impossible," Draco shakes his head, staring at Harry incredulously. "You're the most impossible person I've had the misfortune to meet. How do Weasley and Granger stand it?"
"Are you alright there, Potter?" Professor Sprout calls, her voice booming. She always has a way of shouting every sentence even if you're standing right next to her. Her boots, lined thick with dried mud and leaves, are kicked up onto an empty chair. Transfixed, Harry watches as she clacks her shoes together to expel some more dirt onto the floor. "School year coming along nicely? Hope you're cracking on with that essay I set you on Monday."
"Merry Christmas, Potter." he says, and somehow this is far more intimate than the near-kiss.
(See the end of the chapter for
"With respect, neither did you." Draco points out gently. "Though I’m certain they would be happy that you've found a source of comfort. I don't think they would begrudge you that, Potter."
Ron detects the sound of Harry's hesitancy and latches onto it, "What's that mean?"
it." Harry counters.
Moonlight pours in through the dirt streaked windows of the Astronomy Tower. Harry Potter ascends the stairs with careless abandonment - apparently at ease in the knowledge that it's past curfew and a chance encounter with Filch is extremely, highly likely - his eyes and mind turned instead to the world beyond the stone walls, the night sky reflected in his glasses.
Draco sighs a sigh so deep and drawn out that it's as if he's pulling out his own soul. "Let's just say that I'm sick of being the only one expected to spill his guts."
Beside them, in the middle of the courtyard where a fountain once sat before it was blown to smithereens, stands a towering statue; a phoenix, wings spread wide and its head turned skyward, soars from ashes and realistic, crackling flames that turn the light rain into mist. Even now, even as a frequent visitor to the monument, Harry still marvels at Professor Flitwick's beautiful spellwork. Below, a sleek marble block bears the names of not just those lost to the battle of Hogwarts but every single person who died under Voldemort's reign.
“Riddikulus.” Harry says firmly before the screaming can take hold, the whip crack sound of the spell accompanying an invisible force shoving the dementor back, its hood yanked down so tightly over its unseen face that the scabby hands reach up as if to free itself.
Draco’s eyes are bright as a laugh erupts from him. It’s tinged through with some hysterical edge, some emotion dwelling too deeply inside Draco for Harry to guess at.
"Well, how about as friends then?"
It’s a foreign experience, excruciatingly formal in the way only two people who are struggling to understand how to interact with one another can be - but it’s sincere. Ron almost seems as if he wishes to laugh, sharing a bemused look with Harry.
"Don't be. I just have a hard time being comfortable when people lean in like that."
"Harry, we need to talk - "
“I would say it was more of a poor reflection on myself rather than you,” Draco tells him in a murmur, smiling slightly. “Besides, you
Harry hadn’t been able to say anything at all, the truth of Draco’s words undeniable, the prickling discomfort at the thought of the Manor too fresh. He had nodded instead, they were in agreement, and that had contented Draco enough that he turned to watch the view so that the rest of their journey was spent in companionable silence.
Draco stares down at the chocolate in his hands nonplussed. "Sweets gives you cavities."
"Okay."
Draco shuts his eyes briefly, allowing himself to divulge in a moment of distaste for Harry's rough and unvarnished words.
"I'm in no mood to be sneered at," he says sharply, adjusting the crisp cuff of his shirt sleeve. This, too, suddenly strikes Harry; Draco is even more immaculate than usual, which is quite a feat. The cut of his high collared black coat turns every line of him into a hard edge, his hair slicked back and smooth and bringing out the angles of his jaw and pointed chin. He looks impenetrable. "No. The Hogwarts Express is
Draco sags deeper in his seat, letting his head tip backwards until it hits the back of the chair, his nose drawing a steady line to the ceiling. "It doesn't bother me - it
Their losses had been great, personal losses that sat as heavy as a stone in Harry's gut. Voldemort had been defeated, his followers scattered and rounded up, and there was no reason to fear anymore. Yet Harry felt a wrongness that he couldn't explain, not even to Hermione when she'd pressed him for more. She'd told him it would be good for him to talk about it, that he would feel better for it - and he had, he
Satisfied with his inventory, he nods. "Ready."
"...did you know that you can love someone without liking them?"
Neville frequently keeps up correspondence with Harry and the others; he's taking a year to travel abroad to study foreign magical plants and their properties. Harry has already gotten postcards from China, India and Egypt, all accompanied by a moving photograph of Neville pointing with glee towards his new favourite shrub. Harry really hopes Neville has come away from his experience with the last one okay, he hadn't appeared to notice the vines already winding around his ankle...
"ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME, POTTER!"
The sight which greets him is enough to stop him dead in his tracks.
"I can think of one person but I'm working on it."
"So maybe that's why it stopped being Malfoy." Harry continues, looking up from his battered trainers to meet Draco's eyes. "Maybe it's because you're just like me and I'm finally starting to see that."
What can Malfoy be doing in the early hours of the morning, in the
over it. "Yeah, I could tell from the way you were flattening yourself on the ground there. What were you hoping to do, Malfoy? You don't even have your wand."
Harry might have reassured her himself but for the look on Malfoy's face suggesting the last thing he would ever do is admit to anyone that he is receiving help from Harry Potter.
Draco sighs heavily, "Peppermint Toad."
Hermione's face drops. She'd spent a great deal of the summer searching for her parents, who had up and left Hermione's childhood home and moved to Australia in the time she, Harry and Ron had been tracking horcruxes. She'd had very little to go on at the beginning and as the chill of autumn began to creep into the sunny days, Hermione had started to wilt around the edges. Through love and sheer grit, she'd finally managed to hunt them down two months ago and had immediately flown out to restore their memories.
Harry thinks to himself, nauseous and exhilarated all at once.
He's barely made it off the rickety bridge leading out to the school grounds, caught between half dreading Hagrid's rock cakes and half daydreaming about the golden platters of gingerbread in the Great Hall, when an unexpected voice calls out to him, jolting him out of his thoughts.
Harry gets a glimpse into what it must be like for anyone who enters his close circle and the risk they take of catching the rays from his burdensome spotlight. Ron and Hermione had taken it in their stride for the most part, Hermione particularly unflappable despite the ceaseless attention that often came Harry's way. It hasn't always been easy for them - all the articles and double-takes and photographs taken of them when they're just trying to do their shopping - but they accept that it's just the way it is because the world can never get enough of Harry Potter, no matter how trivial. Seeing Draco's personal reaction though, from someone who has been unwillingly dragged back into the public eye after working so hard to get out of it, Harry feels a wash of guilt.
"I don't need pity, Potter. I know my mother loves me. It's just hard for her to show it right now."
"Can you hear that?"
"Harry?"
"Can you even bring yourself to see it, Potter?" Draco asks, his flint eyes wide and manic, shaking Harry by the arm hard enough to rattle his teeth. "Do you dare imagine the living nightmare of navigating your own home in fear of happening upon the greatest dark wizard of our time? Don't pretend you're any better than I am. You think your path to the brave and true was the only one which held any hardship? That my family were suffering less on our side of the war? Do not presume for one second that we had it easier. You made your choice and we made ours."
with Malfoy."
muttered by him in low despairing tones.
"Because this can’t happen. You’re the hero of the wizarding world. You’re my - my - "
"Jelly Slugs?"
. One hand reaches out to point his wand squarely at Lucius, the other is planting itself on Malfoy's shoulder and shoving as hard as it can to get him out of the way. Draco is more solid than he looks; he stays firm in his place, a string of his furious complaints already lost to a preoccupied Harry.
“How we wound up here. If someone told me seven years ago that I’d have a crush on Draco Malfoy, I’d have probably hexed them.” Harry laughs, ruffling his hair. “I would have needed to beg Hermione to teach me a decent hex first but that’s not the point.”
"Alright - come on in then, if you're coming."
"Wait..."
"Ron, you can give Harry a blow-by-blow after you've cleaned yourself up." Hermione calls, climbing in through the portrait hole with a glowering, soaked Ginny in tow. "You're making a mess."
"I have it on good authority that the pitch is available this afternoon." Draco says casually, breath misting in the chilly air, barely turning his head to glance at Harry. "Unless you're too scared, Potter?"
"Are you going to be alright?"
"Oh?"
Draco looks ready to vomit, white teeth anxiously chewing his bottom lip raw. Harry forces himself to look away from that but Draco won't even meet his gaze.
"If you're talking about Snape killing Dumbledore, then it was all planned. Dumbledore was always meant to die - "
"Well, it clearly isn't because I wouldn't be asking otherwise, would I?" Draco, despite himself, pouts like a child. He pouts and he's not even ashamed of it because why does Potter have to act as if everything is so simple?
Draco wouldn’t let this pass by without some teasing otherwise.
"It's fine, I don't need anything. I just want you to be happy."
Harry has kicked off the ground and - even on the ancient Cleansweep - already caught up to Draco by the time he's seized the tumbling apple.
"They didn't like me, they didn't like magic. Look, I'm over it now - "
Draco's voice comes slightly puzzled from behind him, "I asked if you were ready."
"Ahem, Potter? Did you need something, boy?"
Harry's head drops down to his chest, his eyes scrunching shut to ward off the threat of losing his composure altogether. Nobody had ever told him that grieving for people you'd grown used to being around and laughing with and talking to would be different to the way he grieved his parents. That sort of grief is different; his mother and father have always been a mystery to him, all he can ever do is imagine how they might have fitted into their vacant space in his small world. He could
The Slytherin raps his knuckles against the desk to break the spell, pulling free of Harry's gaze with an uneasy cough. He gestures in the general direction of the grandfather clock that McGonagall keeps in the corner of the room without once glancing over to it.
Draco had pinned Harry with his grey eyes, a frown making wings of his pale brows. “You know what for. For coming. I know what it cost you - it was too much for me to ask. Selfish, even. I won’t ask it of you again.”
Harry himself catches onto the infectious mood before too long, looking forward to a Christmas finally free of stress or trouble or the possibility of oncoming death. That is, until his friends ambush him in the common room one morning.
"It's the least I could do - "
They hold still, ears straining, listening to the unmistakable sound of heavy footsteps echoing up a stone staircase.
"Yeah." Harry says, eyes following the slouching figure of Draco Malfoy as he is surreptitiously led out of the Great Hall by Slughorn. The sound of whispers, volatile and sinister, grow louder as he leaves the room. "Yeah, I reckon you're right about that, Hermione."
"I - yes. Of course."
"And the other side?" Draco hears himself asking, quite out of his control.
"Sorry, Professor. I was wondering whether we could get your permission for something?" Harry says, figuring the best approach is to be direct in the purpose of their visit.
Harry snorts, tipping his head back so that Draco can see his Adam's apple bob. He's smaller than Draco by about a head, which was funny really because if Draco had been told about the Boy Who Lived, he'd have pictured him, well...taller, sturdier looking. Potter was always fairly weedy though, from the first time they met he'd looked in sore need of a good meal and some clothing that actually fit. Everything he wears makes it seem like he's swimming in fabric, makes him look even smaller than he probably is. Even the shirt on his back had sleeves that rode down to his elbows and somehow, Potter doesn't care a jot about it.
Ron catches on quickly and Harry hears a faint,
It's a muggle song; the quality of the sound is tinny and the blare of the brass instruments distorts and warps but the woman's quivering, hope-laden voice rings out defiantly in spite of it, the song managing to evoke both sorrow and optimism with its promise of meeting again in better circumstances.
"What flirting thing?!"
"I see."
"I know that, Ron but it's difficult seeing him go through that over and over again. I just have to stand there and it's just - I feel so useless."
"Well, Weasley had a lucky escape, didn't she?" Draco snaps, pulling his hand free of Potter's.
On cue, Draco flushes bright red and grows aware of Harry standing behind the trunk, his gaze shifting minutely beyond the boggart, wide-eyed and aghast to realise that Harry is hearing his worst thoughts pulled violently into reality.
"Fine! Alright. I'll drop it!"
"What? No." Harry scoffs. "No, Ginny could kick my arse at Quidditch any day of the week. You, on the other hand..."
"Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Bean."
Draco does something remarkably bold. "How does next Friday sound to you then?"
Who would have thought that the Chosen One would be quite this giggly? The boy had
Harry sags into him as if he needs this embrace just as much as Draco, as if they're two crumbling pillars frantically trying to keep one another upright. His arms go all the way around Draco's back and then some, soft hair against Draco's cheek, the clean cotton scent of Harry's shirt enveloping him. Oh Merlin, Draco thinks, will he ever be able to let go now?
Traces of menace seem to linger here, settling on him like fine, silken cobwebs. Setting off, he peers into the rooms Draco had neglected, unable to keep himself from wondering where Voldemort had walked. Had he paced this very corridor, black robes swirling like smoke, those unfeeling red eyes sweeping over the family whose home he had claimed as if they were nothing more than furniture?
"I - I think it is. Maybe more than okay."
how we shall be journeying."
"Do you think it was too soon? To come back, I mean."
Harry digs a heel into the frozen ground, silently approving. He shucks off his coat and scarf, leaving them in a jumble by a goal post, turning to see Draco already in the air and performing an impressive loop de loop. It's effortless and so far removed from Draco's usual flying style that it stuns Harry. How much had he been holding back when he was on the Slytherin team?
"I - "
"Hermione! You know you're the light of my life - "
It hadn’t been easy to return, to bring himself back to the dungeons and relive that dark time, to remember Dobby’s bravery and ultimate sacrifice in rescuing them. He had
Hermione frowns some more but doesn't say another word about it because she's intuitive enough to know when to press and when to leave well alone.
Harry spins on the spot, walking backwards even as he replies. "Uh - it's urgent. I need to look at something."
"I had the finest education growing up, I was surrounded by highly esteemed members of the Ministry. All of that counts for nothing when that education has been tainted by bias and the Ministry officials flattered by bribes made by my father. I have no real sense of the world. My knowledge is false, my company bought. Everything in my life is an extension of that - except, perhaps, you."
Harry
He's handed this wand back to Draco so many times before now, holding it out at the start of every one of their boggart lessons before either of them said a word. Draco always treated the occasion like he was a starving man set before a feast; the very feel of the wand in his hand seemed to provide Draco with a sort of nourishment, he'd turn towards the trunk which contained the boggart with replenished energy that he rarely displayed any other time.
"I find myself a little out of my depth."
"Naturally."
“I think he is. The other day, he managed to make it stumble. He might not need me to help him soon enough.”
"We can always turn back if you're worried." he doesn't even say it to tease, though Draco dearly wishes he had. Potter, he decides, is much too decent for his own good because although he has no idea why Draco is teetering on the wobbly ledge between reluctance to go on and the need to, he still offers him a lifeline.
"I thought you wouldn't want to come down here..."
Harry reaches for him then and despite his protestations, Draco falls easily into the encouraging pull. His fingers clench at Harry's forearms and pinch at the fabric of his shirt. They hold like that for a few beats, just looking at each other; Draco's eyes are wide as if he can hardly believe it, staring down into Harry's face like it's forging Draco's being afresh with every passing second.
“It made me feel…”
Because if Draco claims to be made from the winter, then Harry - Harry will be the spring. Harry wants to deliver the sun and release Draco from that ice to find crystal clear waters running beneath, bright and warm, just as he
"Yeah but why make things harder for yourself
Snow turns to ice then turns to sludge as the New Year is beckoned in. Harry is sprawled on the floor in Gryffindor common room in front of the fire, hunks of bread piled high on a plate beside him. Hermione and Ron, returned from their Christmas break, are tucked up together on the settee behind him.
Draco is sat at the end of the Slytherin table, just far enough away to be outside the perimeter of awareness. The other students around him chatter on happily, leaving him to go unnoticed, a solitary phantom blowing at the steam in his mug, one book propped against the edge of his bowl.
"What have I done to deserve the honour of breakfasting with our Chosen One today?"
Draco lets Harry tow him by the arm, a mad dash across the Astronomy Tower roof as Filch's wheezing voice starts to call out. Draco's head was spinning. Between pants, he manages to squeeze out a few words.
"Good game then?" Harry asks, shaking the magazine to dispel the careless, pink tinged water drops that have fallen from Ron's inquisitive face.
"Even a first-year would be able to see that you belong on a broom. I repeat, why didn't you try out?"
sugarcoat anything. Harry suspects it's something he's inherited from Molly and he likes that best of all about Ron, that there's no pretence and you know what you're going to get the moment he opens his mouth.
, Harry thinks to himself,
On his way to the Slytherin table - Draco's head still bent towards his book, blissfully unaware of Harry's approach - Harry wonders at this inexplicable connection he has with Draco. The petty rivalry which was born that day from a rejected handshake then strengthened on the back of pranks and jealousy grew with them, until this thing between them had twisted into something unhealthy, something of an obsession on both sides.
He might have recognised that Draco was getting ready to fire a spell at him.
Seven years ago, Harry had rebuffed the very same hand held out for his friendship. It had been done without a second thought or regret, Harry had taken Draco at face value that day and turned away from him ever since. Until sixth year. Until the battle. Until now.
"You've been daydreaming an awful lot lately." Hermione frowns at him, her brow furrowed thoughtfully. "If you have anything on your mind, I'm sure that if you talked about it then - "
Harry slides his fingers against the surprisingly warm palm of Draco's hand and clasps at it, every beat of his heart felt in his throat. Draco's wide eyes are as grey as the sky hanging above them, the first flurry of snowfall drifting down onto his pale eyelashes and catching there, and Harry is struck by the sudden awareness that they've crossed some invisible line. It's like cogs slowly but assuredly clunking into place, snug and secure, fitting into where they're meant to be.
"They better get a move on, I'm bloody starving." Ron says, craning his neck to look up at the teacher's table. "Is Hagrid giving them a tour of the castle or what?!"
Ron folds his arms across his chest, resigned. "Well, what was he doing then?"
. Harry is quite content with his own, as good as new since he'd fixed it with the Elder wand.
"Very well. Here you are."
Alone and not knowing when Draco might return, the strain which Harry had managed to keep at bay slowly begins to creep in. There's a tightness in his chest that he can't control, a low simmering ache that spreads like fire from his heart and claws into his throat. His pulse is jumping like he's on the fringes of excitement but Harry knows it's something much worse than that, some underlying panic that will turn his head dizzy and empty his lungs of breath if he lets it get the better of him.
“Riddikulus! Riddikulus!
Maybe Draco has begun to thaw out all on his own.
"I think it only counts as dating if you actually, you know, go on a date."
"I know that! Look, Sirius wasn't a saint, he'd be the first to admit that but he had to spend years of his life living as if he were Voldemort's number one man and not a single person who knew him ever doubted it. He lived as if he
The truth is, Draco hasn't been anywhere near the Astronomy Tower since 6th year. When Potter mentioned a night time excursion earlier that evening after dinner, Granger had given him a withering glare that suggested there was an essay nearby to write and she had no urge or time for such frivolities when work was to be done, and Weasley's probable eagerness at the idea had been immediately curtailed when Granger waspishly inquired into his own schoolwork progress. Granger was always doing that, reminding Potter and Weasley that they'd been given a second chance to sit their final year at Hogwarts and she couldn't understand why they were determined to squander it.
"I'm sorry, Harry." Ron says again.
"Um - you two carry on, I'll catch up with you after. I was just thinking, turns out I haven't written those notes yet after all."
“Yes, I believe I am.”
For a minute, Harry fears she's changed her mind. He turns back in trepidation.
"Don't you see?" Harry asks in desperate murmurs, swiping away the prickling in his eyes for his friend's anguish but this needs to be said. "It was all an act - it's
"If you say I didn't want to do it one more time, Potter," Draco threatens. He grabs at Harry's arm, indicating to the names cast into the marble, hopelessly frenzied. "These people who died - I played a part in that. I may not have raised my own wand to them but I was one of the catalysts that led to their deaths."
“I understand you might not want anyone to see you that vulnerable, but it’s one of the few instances where someone’s memory might actually help the case,” Hale explained.
“A what?” yelled Mulciber before he burst into laughter.
Mercifully, Draco snorted in amusement, so Harry relaxed.
Harry sat on his bed and couldn’t help to marvel at its softness again. Hermione sat next to him, while Ron and Neville sat across from them on Ron’s bed.
Harry moved quickly through the halls, trying to pass the other students before they realized he was there. Harry alternated keeping his map in his pocked and pulling it out for quick glances until he was able to confirm that Draco was headed towards his common room. Harry shoved the map back in his pocket and picked up his pace so he would catch them in time.
“Right, so,” Harry glanced around again to make sure no one was obviously paying attention to them. Once he was satisfied, he placed the miniature box on the table and said “stag.”
“Never,” Mrs. Weasley promised. Harry just sobbed harder.
“Like with how they withhold showers sometimes,” agreed Crabbe.
“So, what did Hale want?” asked Ron once Harry made his way to the library. Harry decided not to mention testifying for Albert. It probably wasn’t something he could hide, but he wanted to avoid that argument for a long as he could.
Harry revealing what happened with the Dursleys was not planned. The whole court scene was supposed to be short, but I started writing it and then this happened. Not sure why, but I suppose if Harry was ever going to reveal it, it makes sense that he did so in an attempt to help a friend. Anyway, because this scene turned into a huge beast, I had to shift and add some things. I debated cutting this chapter in two again, but I figured you all waited long enough for it. So I kept this chapter on the long side, but hopefully it was worth it for the Drarry progress (kinda... hugs totally count).
“Surely even Burke wouldn’t have...” the first newly arrived guard trailed off as he focused on Harry. The sheet was clenched in Harry’s hands over his lap. While the guards could tell he still had his shirt on, the bare leg not covered by the sheet spoke of the dark truth. The guards didn’t have to look far to spot a pair of Azkaban standard issue pants and trousers crumpled at the foot of the bed.
“No idea what you’re talking about,” Albert denied. He gingerly lowered himself on to his cot.
“Well, it was clear that they understood English as they’ve listened to orders from the ministry for years, but I admit, I hadn’t heard of anyone conversing with them before,” stated Malfoy.
Lucius once again complained that the water turned cold far too fast. The man was used to indulging in long hot showers, so Azkaban’s accommodations would never compare. Harry was almost thankful that it hadn’t lasted any longer, because he had noticed that Rodolphus was indulging in a little self-love and that was something Harry didn’t need to stick around to hear.
“Wait, you don’t think Moody uses his eye to watch people walk around naked all day, do you?” Harry suddenly couldn’t help but wonder if the man ever took a peak at him. Or Crouch Jr, who impersonated Moody.
“It has been at least seven months,” Lucius responded. “The dark lord expects results. What if it’s already-” Lucius didn’t finish his sentence, but took a steadying breath. He started to pace along his cell. “There must be something I could do, even from here.”
“You stupid... thinking you... so fucking... no one would care... work that way... I have you... whatever I... nothing you... me,” Harry couldn’t fully understand whatever Burke was spewing at him. His vision was getting darker the longer he couldn’t pull in a breath. He feared he was about to die but didn’t have the strength to stop it.
“Potter,” Zabini greeted with a smirk when it became apparent that his dormmates were willing to silently watch Harry’s approach. Harry nodded in greeting and was glad none of them looked hostile. He assumed it was because Draco, Nott and Crabbe all wanted to ask after their fathers. The papers had made sure to announce he was put close to them. Harry was likely their only source of information, unless Hale was in the habit to updating Albert’s son.
“If you were to say, do your duty, and stand beside the ministry-”
“Even Umbridge,” Harry decided. Harry didn’t have an answer for how everyone should react to her crimes, but he knew the current system wasn’t it. It no longer fit Harry’s idea of justice.
“Yeah, well...” Harry didn’t know what to say. He knew Hermione was trying to tell him that he wasn’t alone, but it just made him feel worse to have left his responsibilities on their laps when they were hurting too.
“He’s looks so much like you,” Hermione observed one day when she caught him staring intently at James. The baby acted exactly like a baby his age should act. There was no advanced awareness to indicate he had all of Harry’s memories. So, Harry had looked him over, trying to find some hint of Ginny that might indicate all of Harry’s fears were for nothing... aside from the faintest smattering of freckles, that Harry wasn’t even sure weren’t his imagination, the baby remained a replica of Harry.
“Er, no,” Harry said embarrassed because he was technically guilty of the crime he was arrested for. “I just meant that the ministry is filled with morons.”
Harry didn’t know what to make for Mulciber as the only thing the man requested had been lube. Harry created another bottle as nothing better came to mind, but when he placed it next to Crabbe’s plant, it felt inadequate. Seeing them side by side, it also occurred to Harry that Crabbe would never be able to hide this gift. Harry morosely watched the cycle and worried that he would have to destroy all that work the second a guard walked down the hall. It was only after several times observing the flower return to a small seed that Harry considered adding some shrinking charms. Unfortunately, at a smaller size, the flower lost some of the details Harry had woven into the spells.
“James can take your name. Well, perhaps hyphenate it,” Harry amended. He didn’t grow up with the same pride about his heritage that Draco was raised with, but continuing on the Potter name seemed like a good way to honor his father. “That is, if you aren’t concerned about James’... purity,” Harry directed the last part to Lucius. He suspected that even if Lucius deemed James’ muggle ancestors were sufficiently far back enough not to pollute his magical inheritance or some other such rot, the Weasley blood was not. They might have been pureblood, but Lucius would not see Weasley genetics suitable for any Malfoy heirs.
“The papers spent all of last year calling me a delusional attention-seeker. I’m not sure the public will care what the ministry does to me,” Harry said. He moved towards his mattress and sat down on the bed. He suddenly felt tired after finishing his rant about how he came to be here. The fact that someone was finally pointing out how stupid this whole thing was, was also allowing him to cautiously relax. If one person was able to see how unfair it was, perhaps others would too. Albert’s suggestion that the public would be on his side was raising Harry’s hopes despite the fact that he had just expressed his own doubt.
As he made his way back to the tower, he nervously cast a lumos using his wand. It was significantly brighter than expected. Harry tried focusing on the feeling of his magic, like Lucius had taught him, and tried to channel only a portion of his magic into the spell. He was only partially successful as his lumos remained brighter than it should be. He knew he’d have to keep practicing before he rejoined his classes.
While they ate, Crabbe started describing a plant called the Shy Tortoise Hyacinth. Much like other hyacinths, they emit a sweet-smelling odor... so long as they remain untouched. Even the slightest poke or prod causes them to emit a foul stench. Crabbe described it as a cross between feet and sulfur.
“What are we going to do? There is no way we can cover this up,” said a guard. There was a short discussion amongst the guards about what their options were until one of them remembered where they were and who their audience was. “We should take this conversation to the main office,” he said.
“What? How?” Lucius muttered in a confused manner. Harry’s view suddenly went wonky as Lucius started moving around. “Are you seeing this?” came Lucius’ voice, but it was Albert’s face in the mirror this time.
“You all might feel it’s a touch feminine, but I thought you could wear these as anklets,” Harry explained. “It would be easy to hide them in your socks, and I can add a notice-me-not charm so the guards won’t pay attention when you take showers.”
“I just-” he sighed. Despite his new resolve, Harry struggled to keep his emotions onboard. “You won’t understand, but I feel guilty for using up his soul this way.”
The space in front of him was immediately filled with a white light. It was bright enough that Harry had to give his eyes time to adjust before he saw anything besides
“Ah, yes. I had hoped to get Rufus to see reason,” Dumbledore explained. “Alas, retiring from the aurors has not made him any less stubborn.”
“How do you have a letter for Vince from his dad?” asked Goyle.
“It’s hard not to be when you’re doing all of this for me,” Harry said.
“Well, look at him. He is me. He has all my features. All of them. I can’t find anything he inherited from Ginny,” Harry pointed out.
Rabastan Lestrange requested Harry use a sugar glider for one side of the box.
It warmed Harry’s heart to hear how much effort Hermione had put into helping him. He was also glad that Hale took Hermione seriously and didn’t interpret her actions as an insult to his ability to do his job. It was this more than anything else that made Harry sure he has picked the right man to represent him.
Harry was more than happy to see the guards go. His relief at his own physical safety was tempered by his guilt that Albert hadn’t been as lucky. Whatever reprieve Hale may set up of Harry didn’t extend to the other prisoners.
“How?” asked Lestrange. Harry thought he sounded more curious than condemning.
“Speaking of Azkaban’s...
Draco took a moment to think it over. “Given the circumstances, I think you’re doing well,” Draco decided.
“Which part?” asked Bones.
“I did. I’m pretty sure it was ugly sobbing too, though my memory is a bit spotty. Maybe it wasn’t bad. He did give me breakfast and lent me some clothes, so it couldn’t have been that bad, right?” Harry said.
“Me? What could I say?” Harry asked. He wasn’t opposed but didn’t see how he’d be able to help.
“Hear that, Potter? If you ever wanted to see someone in their skivvies, now’s your chance!” laughed Mulciber.
That did not mean he didn’t try other spells when he was awake and alone while all his housemate slept. Unfortunately, no matter what he tried, he only saw his own reflection in the handheld mirror. It had initially been surprising how healthy he looked. There were no bags under his eyes even though he hadn’t slept for the longest time. There were no teenage acne littering his skin. In fact, his skin almost seemed to glow. He knew he should be pleased. If he looked healthy then his professors were more likely to believe it too. However, Harry was all too aware that this health was due to slowly consuming Burke’s soul. He hated being reminded of it every time he looked at his reflection.
With nothing else to occupy his mind, Harry kept recalling how gleeful Burke had been when he’d had Harry bound and at his mercy. Harry’s hope that Reginald Hale was reigning in the guards was diminishing the longer Albert was gone. Some guards may have been more cautious, but he doubted they would try very hard to stop Burke. Without restraint, Burke would keep coming at them. Harry broke out into a cold sweat as he imagined how much worse it could get. Harry was genuinely worried for Albert, but he knew that whatever Burke was doing to the other man would only be a warmup for what he had planned for Harry.
“Don’t,” Harry warned. He clutched his sheets at the uncomfortable feeling of having four guards watch him. Despite his growing panic, Harry felt his magic responding. It lingered just under his skin, waiting for Harry to let it loose. It brought Harry some comfort to know he could defend himself again if need be. Perhaps this time without eating any more souls. He couldn’t imagine trying to take another one with Burke taking up so much space already. He was reasonably certain that even the dementors only ate one soul at a time.
“Draco knew?” questioned Lucius, his voice coming out higher pitched than normal.
Harry could picture Burke opening the package and getting dosed by the smelly plant. “Albert Nott,” he smiled. “You are a wonderful, wonderful man.”
“You know they’re watching you,” Harry felt he had to try to stop this. “Whatever you have planned won’t go over well when-”
“But I did something so bad, Draco. I thought it would only hurt me, but it didn’t. It hurt
Harry grabbed a blank parchment and wrote out a brief letter for Hale. He wrote how he desired to make some changes to Azkaban, but explained he wasn’t sure how to go about it. He requested any advice Hale was willing to offer. Once he was satisfied with his letter, he packed away the rest of his school stuff. He figured there was no reason not to mail it immediately. He gathered his cloak and snuck out of the common room. He just hoped Hale would still be supportive even though he was no longer being paid to be his judicial-wizard.
He sent the letters meant for the prisoners’ wives, Mulciber’s mum, and the Lestranges’ dad off with school owls. He held back on Bellatrix’s. If he didn’t trust her not to hurt Hedwig, it seemed unfair to risk another owl as well. He’d leave it up to Draco to find a way to deliver them to his aunt. He kept all the letters for the prisoner’s sons on him. He could have mailed them as well, but he wanted an excuse to talk to Draco. He didn’t know what he’d say, but he wanted to prod at the possibility that Draco might return his feelings like his father suspected. So, Harry put those letters back in the box after he removed the still photos. He did not need the embarrassment of Draco catching sight of his own face in the bunch.
get them to see his fellow prisoners as he did. The problems between them weren’t as personal. That wasn’t the case for Neville. The Lestrange brothers had been involved in the torture of Neville’s parents, which caused permanent damage. Harry couldn’t gloss over that or expect Neville to forgive them. Harry had gotten to see the better side of Rodolphus and Rabastian, but he had no right to ask Neville to do the same.
“I didn’t kill her,” Harry interrupted.
“Exactly,” confirmed the other Lestrange brother. “Your glasses would be a perfect tool to cast the spell on,” he added.
McGonagall didn't say anything when Harry sat down but slowly reached for his hand. When Harry didn't object, she gripped him tight. Harry watched her from the corner of his eye and felt guilty for the sad expression he knew he put there.
“I will also release the pictures of your tattoo. That is not yet public knowledge, so that is sure to cause quite the stir. Imprisoning you without a trial is bad enough, but this. This is going too far. The ministry is not only scarring children, but branding them too? It won’t go over well. Once the public is suitably is upset, I will release a statement that you are willing not to press charges for the tattoo if the ministry stops holding you illegally. It will present you as kind and forgiving – a clear contrast to how the ministry is behaving,” Hale summarized. Harry nodded even though he did not forgive Burke or Wiblin. He would love to press charges, but if letting it go allowed him to be released, he would suck it up.
“Excellent Harry! Excellent. Not that I doubted you,” Slughorn said when he saw Harry’s perfectly brewed potion.
“I know, Harry,” she said as she placed a hand on his mouth to stop his awkward explanation. “I love you too. I don’t want you to worry about me. The Death Eaters at the school will hardly notice one girl’s ring, but I’ll be careful with it anyway. Even if they see it, I wouldn’t tell them its significance,” she reassured him.
“Hale thought the same thing,” Harry said. “I think it worked... wish I knew exactly what was said about me though.”
It surprised Harry how much he missed the other prisoners. Harry had constantly engaged with them during his entire stay in Azkaban. They didn’t just teach him spells; they built up his confidence in himself. Plus, they just
“Potter,” Malfoy called softly. Harry ignored him and stared more intently at the wall. Harry ignored his second attempt as well. His hands started trembling so Harry clenched them into fists.
“It seems like you already caught Burke’s notice,” pointed out Nott. “He’s a nasty piece of work. It certainly makes me glad I’m past my prime.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, but directed the apology towards Dumbledore and McGonagall.
“You’re in good health,” the medi-witch declared, kind despite Harry’s near interrogation. “However, we want to keep you here for observation. We’re not sure why you were in a coma to begin with. Several eyewitnesses said you’d been hit with the killing curse. You’re now the Boy Who Lived Twice,” she said. She’d tried to say the last part with humour, but Harry just cringed at his new moniker.
Snape concluded.
“Come now,” the voice prodded. “
Lucius looked shocked but that quickly bled into sadness. “As much as I wish I could change things, I fear Draco won’t be safe regardless... at least with you he will be happy,” Lucius said.
“Recon that’ll make the papers,” Ron said. Harry groaned in response. After a moment, Ron joined in with his own. “Guess this means we’re pretty much living in the library for the rest of the year. It’s Hermione’s dream come true.”
“Wait, you didn’t know blood magic before creating the spell with the mirrors?” asked Goyle in confusion.
“Hands against the wall,” Burke instructed. When Harry was in position, he heard his cell door unlock. Burke was quickly at his side, and manhandling his hands behind his back. Harry’s face smacked into the wall. His glasses were pushed up but fortunately didn’t break.
*and another teaser* Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts, you can expect Draco to make an appearance in the next chapter.
They’d made love twice that night. The first time was hurried and perhaps a touch desperate. It was still the best he’d felt in months, and he relished the chance to just hold her. When their gentle caresses turned sensual, they made love a second time. Harry had tried to convey his love and admiration in every touch. They stayed together, just holding on to each other, until it became unsafe to remain.
Successfully pulled out of his funk, Harry concentrated on keeping the water warm. It wasn’t until Lucius finished washing up and still had time to bask in the warmth that he realized Harry was once again using his wandless magic to make them all more comfortable.
“How’s your meal?” smirked Burke, knowing Harry found it to be subpar.
"Sadly no," answered McNair. "If more than 75% of a living creature tries to pass through the bars while the cell door is locked, a strong shock charm is released." Harry wondered if McNair found that out through experience. Harry questioned how Sirius got out of his cell but perhaps the window was not tied into this security measure.
“Yes,” Harry confirmed with a dark look as he recalled Burke’s attack. “He’s healed now though.”
“Didn’t you hear him? He wants you on his side. Which means you still have value in the public eye. I imagine they are realizing they made an error in arresting you and are scrambling to do damage control. Your support would be the fastest way to secure it. Pardons all around,” Malfoy reasoned.
“Maybe...” Harry said, but Draco could tell he wasn’t convinced.
“Let me know if you need me to explain anything,” Hermione offered quietly.
” asked one of the dementors.
Harry and Draco eventually settled back into their routine, and Harry let go of his fear that Draco would leave him. He still felt in his heart that he was unworthy of Draco; that creating a horcrux had permanently tainted him and there would always be a part of him he couldn’t give to Draco because of it. Consequently, he would have left their relationship as it was... had Draco not proposed.
Before anyone could figure out what to say, their dorm room door opened and Dean and Seamus walked in.
“If you’re not planning anything bad, why can’t we join you?” she asked with a raised eyebrow.
At one of the back corners there was a toilet bowl and sink. The sink had a small bar of soap resting on one side and a toothbrush on the other. Fortunately, the toothbrush was still in a package, so it wasn’t a leftover from whoever has last used this cell. In the center of the back wall was a window. A cold breeze occasionally made its way into the cell. A glance at Malfloy’s cell revealed he had a similar window. If all cells had a window, then that would explain why the entire place was so cold. The window was high up, so Harry couldn’t see much. Harry guessed that he probably could reach the window, but it wouldn’t be easy. This was probably why Sirius had not thought to use it to escape until he became desperate.
“You’d best get back to your job. At least while you still have one. You know, since my friend, the minister, is unhappy with you,” it was an empty threat, but Harry was satisfied that Burke actually looked worried for a moment.
Also, if your friend is going through something, it's probably NOT best to ignore it and talk about quidditch. There are various reasons these men take that approach and think it's the best option. However, some people need their friends to just sit with them and acknowledge how crappy the situation is even if they can't do anything about it.
As the days went by, Harry had to wonder if Dumbledore had been wrong about the side effects. Harry didn’t feel different. Not really. He still cared about Hermione and felt guilty for how he contributed to her problems. He was still hurt and angry that Ron left, but prayed he was okay wherever he ended up. He was disgusted with himself for everything he did to create a horcrux. Unlike Voldemort, he had no desire to create another one. Harry would have worried that it didn’t work, except he’d felt the pain of cutting out a piece of his soul and placing it outside of his body. Every time he looked at his mother’s ring, he just
“What about you and Weasley then? I mean girl Weasley –
Perkins cleared his throat but when Harry glanced at him, the auror was still not looking at him. Harry glanced at Burke. When Burke noticed he had Harry’s attention, he sent him another one of those smirks.
started calling him Theo,” Parkinson scowled at him.
Harry felt giddy as he walked towards the showers, high on the knowledge that he successfully got away with warding the cells. However, his good mood lasted only until he stepped into the changing room and felt the weight of everyone watching him. They were as hungry to catalog his injuries as they had been the day before with Albert.
“Couldn’t find the other books?” asked Hermione.
The medi-witch was able to confirm that Ron, Hermione and Neville had all survived the battle. Given Neville’s heroism, and Ron and Hermione’s closeness to both Harry and Neville, their actions were celebrated and reported on for months following the battle. The medi-witch was less informed about everyone else and promised to look for an old newspaper that listed all the deaths.
“Dumbledore’s office,” Harry said with a sigh and sat down beside him.
“You are not an object,” Ishanders pointed out, doubting Harry’s theory. “How would you be one of these things?”
“She told us you gave her your mother’s ring, and promised to make it back to her,” Mrs. Weasley said softly. Harry looked at her with worry but noted neither she nor her husband were looking at Harry with anger or disgust. Ginny must not have told them what the ring was. In fact, it almost sounded like Ginny had led them to believe it had been – well, perhaps not an engagement ring, but some sort of promise ring. In a way it had been, but not how Mrs. Weasley assumed.
Potter?” asked another voice down the hall. Murmuring broke out in various cells as word spread down the hallway. Harry figured when he arrived last night, many of them must have been asleep and were only noticing now that they had a new prisoner amongst them.
“It’s fine,” Harry said. Sure Mulciber was crude and inappropriate, but he didn’t give Harry the heebie-jeebies like Burke did.
“Allegedly,” Harry interrupted though his voice came out weak. Was this their plan? To push at him until he admitted that he had cast the curse? Merlin, he was an idiot. He had walked straight into that one.
“You’ll want to watch it, Potter,” warned Burke. “You might think you’re the big man just because you’re friends with the minister, but while you’re in here, you’re mine.”
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked defensively.
“Let me decide what I deserve,” Draco interrupted. “If
“No. No one should know what they are. They’re horrible. You break off a piece of your soul and place it in an object. If you die you can come back because a piece of your soul remains. But you have to kill someone to make it. Kill them and... and... Draco, I can’t! It’s too horrible. The things you do to make one! No one should make one. And he made so many. We couldn’t find them all. And they all had enchantments to protect them. We didn’t know how to destroy them for the longest time. It seemed impossible, you see? You understand? Draco?” Harry looked at him, worried Draco wouldn’t understand.
The next morning, Harry had just finished scooping some scrambled eggs on to his plate, when he heard Hermione gasp.
“I don’t know you mean,” Harry stated. Despite the déjà vu feeling, he was completely lost as to what they meant.
“Relax,” Albert said. “Burke still isn’t back.”
"Just draw any old frog then," McNair suggested. Harry tried, but the result looked more like Neville’s toad, Trevor... just skinnier.
“Should I?” asked Draco.
Harry’s fault. And while he had no intention to make Draco wear another horcrux before getting pregnant, it didn’t remove the fear that it could end the same way.
Fortunately, Albert was the only one to glimpse his less than pure thoughts about Draco. Harry didn’t know if Lucius would still be supportive if he’d glimpsed some of Harry’s fantasies or caught on to the very real stalking Harry had conducted over the year. However, Lucius seemed to anticipate the danger and avoided all thoughts of his son just as much as Harry tried to hide them.
“I’m well aware,” Harry said, trying to sound disinterested.
Even James seemed to be encouraging it. He’d interrupted Harry and Draco’s conversation with a happy “Da!” They’d both turned towards the child, and noticed his arms raised towards Draco, not Harry. Draco had turned worried eyes on Harry.
Once the prisoners had made themselves depressed about their situation, it was hard to move forward with Harry’s afternoon lessons. Albert was supposed to have led them, but everyone wanted to give the man time to heal instead. Harry quietly talked to Lucius as Mulciber and the Lestranges brainstormed last minute spells that might interest Harry. Lucius periodically asked for updates on Albert’s status, but Harry couldn’t tell much as the man remained lying down. Harry hoped he had managed to fall asleep.
“All I’m trying to say is that it’s OK to grieve... but you have to let it out sometime,” Hermione advised.
“It’s alright, mate,” Neville added. “I wouldn’t have expected it, but he’s a decent bloke.”
Harry considered it. He wasn’t sure what Nott’s motivation was. As surprisingly nice as these men had been to him, what Nott was proposing would impact the outside world. He didn’t know if this would somehow help the death eater agenda.
“What else?” wondered Mulciber.
“You’d be willing?” asked Hale in surprise.
“Yes… I’ve tried to follow him a few times,” Harry was reluctant to admit how obsessed he’d become, “but he uses Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts so it’s difficult to-”
“I’m not half bad at charms either,” said Mulciber. While his words were humble, his tone was not. “And of course, the dark arts.”
The next few minutes were uncomfortable, but Harry allowed them to ask questions about his stay in Azkaban. He complained about the food, and utter lack of privacy when he had to go to the bathroom, or take a shower. The boys nodded in sympathy.
“I really don’t know what you mean…” Harry whispered. The creature gave some inhuman grunt before turning away. Harry watched as it made its way slowly down the hall until he couldn’t watch it any more. The terrible feelings and memories did not return.
“You’re allowed to grieve,” Hermione was quick to reassure him. “No one holds last night against you. Everyone was a little depressed.”
Harry accepted the mirror from Theo and glanced down. He expected to see Albert, or perhaps Crabbe since he didn’t get a chance to talk to him earlier, but it was Mulciber who smiled at him from the depths of the mirror.
“Please don’t ask me to think about Lucius like that,” Harry pleaded. He may have noticed many similarities between Lucius and Draco, but the last thing he needed was to think about Lucius in the same way he thought about Draco.
“What did you do?” Malfoy asked, finally breaking the staring contest.
“Well, yes, but I meant to carry on the family name,” Lucius stressed. As Harry was still looking at Draco with admiration, he saw a flash of something cross his face. When he didn’t jump in immediately, Harry suspected the Malfoy name was as important to Draco as it was to Lucius.
She must have said something to the Weasleys because even Percy gave him an awkward speech about always being there for Harry and James. He appreciated it, he really did, but it also made him feel worse.
“And what
“Don’t worry, Potter,” said Mulciber as he saddled up to them, thankfully fully dressed. “We know you got hair where it counts,” even though he ruffled the hair on Harry’s head, it was clear he was referring to something else.
“I’ll help you get through that crowd,” Perkins offered and gestured towards the crowd that had gathered around the door. The majority of them were press, clearly hoping to get a comment from Harry on his way out.
Harry looked towards Malfoy and Nott. It was insane to count on them for support but Harry didn’t know what Lestrange was trying to accomplish.
“I’m sure he wouldn’t mind if I softened him up for him,” replied Jugson, though he looked worried. “He’d reward me.”
“Then Harry will continue with his classes,” Dumbledore determined.
“I know. I know. It’s just... they helped me,” Harry said, but wondered how to explain it to them.
“Do you know Hale’s strategy?” he asked. When Theo shook his head negatively, Harry began explaining what happened with the testimonies and how Harry thought it fit into Hale’s overall reframing of that night’s events. When he got to the part where he spoke about the Dursleys, he tried to gloss over it.
“Because Azkaban is a shitty place,” Harry said.
Harry looked at Lucius in shock. He didn’t know what Draco was writing in his letters home to make Lucius come to this conclusion. Harry wanted to believe it would be as simple as asking Draco. He didn’t think Lucius was setting him up for failure, but it was hard to wrap his head around the idea that Draco might like him back.
Draco held his hand tightly as they quietly observed the magnified picture of Harry’s soul.  Unlike the marvel Harry had felt when seeing Draco’s soul, Harry watched his with a heavy heart.
After cross referencing a theory in several books, Harry thought of another approach he could try. He wasn’t overly confident, but didn’t want to wait a couple of hours so he could run it by Theo. Harry checked the time to ensure the guards weren’t likely to be patrolling their block, crossed his fingers, and tried yet another spell.
“I’m sure you must have at least seen the draconifor spell,” Lucius stated. Harry vaguely remembered it from his third year. “Normally the dragons are small, but you could increase their size for a more… spectacular effect.”
“Not a bad idea,” Albert said as he considered it. “But I was hoping for more creature comforts.”
Harry glanced in Malfoy’s direction. So far he had not seemed malicious towards Harry. None of the men had though Harry wasn’t confident that would remain the case if they had access to him and a guard’s approval to do what they liked.
Anton gave all of Harry’s belongings back, including his wand, but they were passed over to Perkins. Harry felt a pang of longing and worry at seeing his wand in an auror’s hands. Despite his new powers, Harry prayed the day wouldn’t end with the ministry snapping it.
“I don’t know,” Harry sighed. He was the one that broached the subject, but it certainly hadn’t been something he planned. “They asked if Albert ever mentioned wanting to hurt muggles... I told them, er, only certain kinds.”
“That was a house elf!” Harry angrily cut in, finally unable to censor himself. Why were they bringing that up again? Hadn’t they covered it in his trial last year?
“We’re heading straight to the ministry, so you might as well change into these now,” Hale said as he handed over the higher quality robes. Trusting Hale, and wanting to leave as soon as possible, Harry didn’t argue with the man. Despite having no privacy, Harry striped with less embarrassment than when he had first arrived in Azkaban. Hale did not provide new underwear, so Harry left the uncomfortable Azkaban pair on, but the rest of his outfit made up for that discomfort. The material of the new clothes were so soft, it felt downright heavenly against his skin. It was also significantly warmer, though the coldness of Azkaban had long stopped being a problem for him.
“I couldn’t stomach the idea of patting the ministry on the back for doing nothing. I’d hoped it would be different once they acknowledged Voldemort’s return, but they still want to pretend everything is fine without
“Do we really have to wait for Parkinson and Theo?” Harry asked once he was certain Parkinson was far away enough not to hear him. He didn’t like the idea of waiting in the hallway. By now Lucius must be impatient hearing Draco but unable to speak to him.
“Which you allowed,” cut in Hawkworth.
Harry was still periodically glancing at Hale for clues. He noticed Hale looked just as eager as Runecraft.
“So, it’s actually more effective when cast on a seeing-aid device. Well, it isn’t as strong, which ironically makes it more effective,” concluded Lestrange after Mulciber finished his cautionary tale.
“I know,” Harry said. If he hadn’t realized before, he now had an intimidating list of policies to let him know exactly how challenging it was going to be. “I might not make a difference at all. I just…” Harry trailed off with a big sigh.
“Er,” Harry would have taken it as a compliment if McGonagall didn’t sound so sad.
won’t hear the end of it if you’re both gone when she gets back,” Zabini explained.
“What is everyone so excited about?” Burke asked but all of the men around him had gone quite. “Come now, the boys were just telling me that they haven’t ever heard you lot quite so rowdy. I just had to come see for myself what got you all excited.”
“Shame,” commented Rodolphus Lestrange. “Burke would be the perfect test dummy for
Harry whipped around to see Burke. The man frowned as his eyes swept over Harry’s uncovered and unblemished chest. It wasn’t hard to guess that the man was looking for any damage Jugson might have caused.
“What’s a horcrux?” asked Crabbe. He had been too caught up in his own terrible memories that he had missed Harry’s previous explanation. Seeing Harry’s reluctance to say it again, Albert filled in the others as best he could after only hearing one side of the conversation.
“What does that do?” asked Harry.
“Does that make a difference?” Draco asked.
They made small talk about Harry’s research. Harry hoped that after looking at Harry’s notes again, Draco would have more questions and he’d have an excuse to press up close to him as they reviewed it together. They reached the Great Hall before Harry worked up the courage to offer it.
“I know just the place for you, Potter,” said Burke. There was such a self-satisfied tone to his voice that Harry thought the man must have known Harry was going to be arrested and brought straight to Azkaban.
“Oh, no, Harry dear. It’s... these things sometimes happen,” Mrs. Weasley managed to say, though a few more tears fell. Mr. Weasley moved up beside her to offer a comforting embrace, though Harry noted the man’s eyes were also brimming with tears.
Harry didn’t like. He really didn’t. He still hadn’t come to terms with having the tattoo, so the thought of willingly splashing it on the front page of a newspaper was terrifying. It had taken considerable effort for Albert and Lucius to convince him it was the best course of action. “OK,” Harry reluctantly agreed.
The common room was empty, which didn’t surprise Harry given the hour. He went to the chairs he and his friends usually occupied, and spent the rest of the night reviewing Hermione’s notes and practicing the spells. He was mainly concerned about performing the magic using his wand. He attempted to scale back on how much power and intend he channeled when casting. It wasn’t something Harry had paid attention to before Azkaban, so he couldn’t compare his spell work now to how he preformed before. He could only hope none of his professors or classmates had paid much attention either.
“Yes,” Harry answered after he glanced at Hale.
“You’re sending him to Azkaban without a trial?” asked the first man. Harry was relieved to note that the man sounded outraged on his behalf. It was nice someone had finally pointed out how unfair this whole thing was.
The man’s face was swelling from what was clearly repeated blows to his head. The guards hadn’t bothered to clean up the blood from Albert’s split lip and the cut above his left eyebrow. Harry thought the latter was still bleeding sluggishly. Albert’s clothes were similarly stained with blood. The guards didn’t seem to be any more inclined to clean them up either.
“How do you figure?” asked Draco.
“Fine!” Harry hissed angrily, believing that they were trying to trick him though he couldn’t figure out how or the purpose. “Sirius and Bellatrix were dueling. I don’t know what curse she used, but Sirius- he… he froze and just fell through the veil…”
“Maybe not in the hallway? I was trying to take Draco somewhere we wouldn’t get caught, but Parkinson insisted I get vetted first,” Harry said.
“Whose orders?” asked John.
Harry frowned as he processed the offer. Perhaps Nott thought Harry had picked up a harmless side project and offered his help as a way to extend their mutual tutoring. It was tempting to pretend that was the case so he could get Nott’s help, but that excuse would not hold up once it became clear they were only working with one mirror present.
“I have an idea,” Albert cut in. Harry couldn’t help but be impressed by Albert’s problem-solving skills and the sheer amount of knowledge he had. He taught Harry a new spell that called upon a person’s memory in order to place a still image on parchment. The result, if done correctly, would resemble a muggle picture. The process was simple, but Harry needed several attempts as he was not skilled in the mind arts. His first few tries resulted in something more akin to a drawing than a photo – and not a very good drawing. Harry also scrapped several blurry photos before he was able to create a realistic static photo of Bellatrix. He still frowned at the result.
“Yeah, but it’s not the
Harry suddenly sat up straight as an impossible, ridiculous, but also wonderful idea came to him. He glanced at the mirror he’d just made and knew how he could make it into something Draco would want and not be insulted by. Draco himself had told Harry that what he needed was his father. Harry couldn’t actually bring Lucius to Draco, but if he could somehow connect this mirror to the one he’d given Lucius, then Harry could give him the next best thing. Assuming Harry could make it work. He didn’t know the first thing about creating two-way mirrors, but Harry knew he had to try.
“Get off me you bast-” Burke interrupted Harry’s outburst by leaning down and forcing another kiss. Since Harry’s mouth had been open mid-insult, Burke took the opportunity to slip his tongue in. Harry’s brain short circuited and looped ohmygod-ohmygod-ohmygod as Burke seemed intent on shoving his tongue as far as it could go. He only broke out of his panic when Burke tugged on Harry’s hair to adjust the angle of their kiss. Still frighten but no longer frozen, Harry bit down on the invading tongue. Burke jerked back.
Despite the man’s words, he was glancing at Harry’s neck and unable to completely mask his unease. Harry’s unease was also growing as it dawned on him that he might no longer be able to pursue his chosen career. Could someone with an Azkaban tattoo become an auror? Did he even still want it? Harry recalled his arrest and subsequent dash to Azkaban thanks to aurors who showed no interest in helping him. Harry had no desire to see them again, let alone work alongside them. Working in any branch of the ministry had never been so unappealing.
“Being a Death Eater is now considered a crime,” Andromeda said with a bemused tone.
The other prisoners didn’t even hesitate to remove their clothes. Public showers had become common practice for them. Both Lucius and Nott moved leisurely as they matched Harry’s slow pace. He was reluctant to remove his clothes as he noticed many of the prisoners were still giving him curious looks. Harry tried not to peek at anyone, but the room quickly filled with naked men. He couldn’t avoid having his eyes land on someone’s naked arse. Or their Azkaban tattoo. The latter pained him as it reminded him of his own. Harry was surprised that not all prisoners had their tattoo on their neck. The ones that didn’t seems to already have some other tattoo in the place where their Azkaban number would have gone. Instead, this tag was placed on their chest or arms.
“Pregnancy?” Harry asked faintly. It didn’t make any sense. How could Ginny be pregnant? How could Ginny be
“It’s bad,” Harry hedged.
The guards were oddly efficient when they returned the prisoners to their cells. Harry was unsure if the lack of sneering was due to the lack of dementors or scrutiny from the outside world. Harry felt it was likely the former given they still didn’t heal either Harry or Albert.
“You can’t keep wondering these what ifs. I’ll help you figure out if James really is your horcrux like you think,” Draco said.
A few more curses and hexes were suggested. Usually the men around him would laugh at each suggestion though occasionally someone would groan and admit to having been a victim of a particular spell and would complain. Despite being one of the most unbelievable conversations he had ever been privy too, Harry was enjoying himself. Harry was pretty sure Azkaban wasn’t normally filled with this much good-natured laughing, but he assumed that was exactly why the competition to think of the most outrageous hex kept going for a couple of hours. Harry was pretty sure every man in the hallway was desperately trying to think of another suggestion if only to keep the harsher thoughts at bay.
“Any requests?” Harry asked.
Harry slowly copied the motions. He told himself he was just humouring them and we wouldn’t actually use something like the toenail curling hex on anyone. But he repeated the motions until both Malfoy and Nott hummed in approval.
“What?” Harry asked confused. He tried not to look as devastated as he felt. Hermione gestured to the Ancient Runes book Harry still held. He was glad he grabbed at least one book before he noticed Draco and the others. After that conversation, he had completely forgotten about runes.
“You thought the dementor would help you, but not the guards?” asked one wizard. He sounded thoroughly confused.
They asked Harry to recount what he had been learning so far that year. Harry was surprised how difficult it was to remember. He knew Hermione would have been disappointed at his fumbling attempts to recall what happened in class even just a couple of weeks ago. In all honestly, most of his attention span was taken up by either Ginny or Draco. He hadn’t been paying that much attention in class. Not that he would have admitted that aloud.
Given Harry’s success with charms, the other men were all eager to see how Harry would do with the subjects they taught him. Harry initially refused to cast any of the darks arts spells, but the others talked him into a compromise. He would only cast the spells that had a counter. Lestrange offered to be Harry’s practice dummy.
“No,” interrupted Asherath, which fortunately stopped Harry’s downward spiral. “When pregnant, your kind is a
Harry started with the injuries on Albert’s face. Most of those were healed by the basic healing spells he’d learn in charms. It still baffled him that many of the guards had been unable to master these spells. There were a few deeper gashes, but a mental episkey healed those up.
“There’s nothing
“Er, that’s alright,” Harry said. He didn’t know what to say to that, nor did he want to talk about it anymore.
“Rubba dub dub,” Burke smirked, “too many convicts in a tub.”
Harry couldn't help the derisive snort he gave at that statement. The woman went from sympathetic to insulted quickly, so Harry cut in before she could say anything else. “The ministry hasn't bothered to do anything but blame me for underage magic, whether or not it was actually
“Do you hate me now?” whispered Harry when he couldn’t stand the silence any longer. Draco looked down and noted that Harry had started crying again.
“Yeah,” Harry responded though he sounded resigned. “I just know that’s going to come back to bite me somehow.”
Monday had been a grueling day. He’d had to put aside his eagerness about the mirrors and pretend he had the same amount of interest in every single one of his classes. As much as he was able, he tried to portray myself as a well-adjusted and dedicated student. This meant he couldn’t be caught studying content unrelated to the class, even once he completed the classwork. It wasn’t worth risking his professor’s attention and then being saddled with a mind healer.
“Right,” Draco said, and took a deep breath. He relaxed when Harry wrapped his arms around him. “Right. I thought I would show you mine first. I’m not exactly a saint. I’ve done things that, well, you know. Still, my soul should theoretically represent a normal, healthy adult’s soul.”
Those memories were a big point of contention among Runecraft and his cohorts. They kept asking him if he truly provided a memory of some event from that night but were vague describing it. Harry figured they probably were trying to catch him in a lie. Harry eventually just kept answering those questions by stating that if Hale submitted it and said it Harry’s memory then it was. A wizard Harry vaguely remembered at his own trial had asked about a ‘suspicious’ spell Hermione had cast in a memory. Before Hale could jump in, another wizengamot member insisted that the children weren’t on trial and they ought to focus on Albert. While Harry was certain Hermione hadn’t been silently casting dark arts that night, he suddenly feared Runecraft or one of the others would try to use it against his friends.
“These prisoners have shown me more kindness in the few weeks I’ve been here than the ministry has shown me since I started Hogwarts,” Harry concluded. He suspected that quote would make it into the newspapers.
Fortunately for everyone, Wiblin did not press the issue. He stepped back into the hallway and allowed the other guards to enter the cell without him. Harry did not feel comfortable with them either so he backed up on his cot as much as he could. The movement reminded him that his lower half was naked under the sheet.
Draco and Narcissa eased the conversation into planning the wedding. It set the tone for how all of the wedding planning unfolded. Draco and Narcissa did the bulk of the work. Harry didn’t know how Draco managed on top of everything else he did. The only part Harry felt strongly about was insisting on a small and intimate ceremony. He didn’t want their wedding to be some media shitshow.
“It’s a bit cold,” Harry said drily. He wondered how long he would have to put with Burke.
“How did you do it before?” Asherath countered. Harry was too confused to notice the shrewd tone that entered the dementor’s voice.
“If you’ll step over there, by the black curtain,” Anton directed. Harry felt his stomach clench. He normally hated having his picture taken but this one would probably be the worst one yet. He could already see it printed it in tomorrow’s
“Nah, use Burke’s name,” suggested Mulciber from his cell. “That way, he’ll get the blame for all the bad things you do.”
“You sure you want me here?” asked Harry with a slight slurring to his words. “I might sick up on your extrouv-extav-ext-nice stuff.”
He was awoken by a banging noise, followed by a loud voice. “Get up Jugson or I’ll take it to mean you don’t want your brekkie.”
“You’re young,” Scrimgeour argued as he brushed Harry’s comments aside. “You just don’t grasp the full picture.”
And it was still an issue. Harry was disappointed that James still looked like him as he aged. Harry was certain that if they’d been the same age, they could have passed for twins. He cursed the Dursleys for never taking his picture as a child, otherwise he’d have been able to prove this to his husband. Draco had tried to reassure him in multiple ways. He’d presented Harry with the results of a maternity potion to prove James was biologically Ginny’s son, but Harry had theorized that the horcrux couldn’t have created a new vessel from nothing but could possess a vessel too weak to throw it off. He also thought the horcrux might have done something to help create James, but he couldn’t explain how that was possible.
“Do you remember enough of it?” asked Malfoy.
“I’m sure everyone’s more comfortable in their own space,” Harry responded and sneered at Burke’s triumphant smirk.
“Am I an utter idiot?” asked Harry, looking between Malfoy and Nott.
“You’re clean,” he said softly. Logically, Harry knew that, but emotionally he felt the opposite. Everyone’s attention had him reliving the fight until he recalled in stark detail how it felt to have Burke all over him. The fact that he held the man’s soul made him fear he would never be rid of Burke.
Before Harry could offer to create something for the others, Albert insisted that he complete the quiz he had created. This led to them focusing the afternoon on more theoretical topics. Harry knew he was being uncharacteristically invested in coursework, but his fellow prisoners helped keep him motivated. His pride grew when he created a prototype for their hypothetical glasses that could differentiate between an animagus and a natural animal. During the testing phase, Albert and Lucius’ animagus forms were outlined with a neon green glow.  They needed to test the glasses with a born animal, but Harry was convinced they worked. It made him happy that he executed a complex bit of spell work that he helped create. He couldn’t wait to show Hermione.
“But I might not actually get out of here,” Harry thought to Scrimgeour’s parting comment. It seemed like Dumbledore was having trouble getting Harry out of Azkaban. By now Harry had stopped expecting every sound to be Dumbledore pulling off a rescue mission, but he’d held hope that it wouldn’t be too much longer. That seemed so foolish considering Scrimgeour’s visit.
Lucius’ drawn expression offered no comfort. Harry grew increasingly fidgety as the seconds ticked by.  Harry couldn’t suppress his jump when the door at the end of the hall finally opened. It seemed to take forever for Burke to return Albert to his cell. Harry wondered if Burke was purposely trying to torture them by building the suspense.
It was bittersweet the first time he saw Teddy and James next to each other. Under different circumstances he would have been thrilled to see two of the marauders’ descendants growing side-by-side. It wasn’t the same knowing one of those children was really a horcrux reincarnated.
hogs the sheets,” Lestrange offered. Love-blind indeed.
“What?” Harry was shocked. If he could do some basic healing spells, then shouldn’t the guard be able to?
“No,” Harry reassured. As far as he knew, the snatcher hadn’t been related to Draco.
“Er,” Harry did not know how to respond. He wasn’t sure how Hale got him out of trouble, so he wasn’t sure how safe it was to even imply that he had cast an unforgivable on Lestrange. He was spared answering Perkins when Dumbledore quickly made his way towards them.
This chapter was supposed to be longer, but as I started to flesh it out, it got more complicated - and I’m not even finished writing it yet! So, I figured I’d cut it in half and give you guys something now since I’m slow and who knows when I’ll finish the rest. But at least you know Harry’s over-the-top and insane plan to woo Draco. Good thing Harry is used to doing the impossible.
A door at the end of the hall opened, which caused Harry to tense. It was difficult to tell time here, but it felt too early for supper. The sound of footsteps confirmed that it was guards and not dementors returning.
“No,” Harry felt embarrassed for a whole new reason.
It's fine. Harry is fine. Everything is fine... do you believe him yet?
“There are many theories about you,” continued Asherath. “Part-dementor, which seemed unlikely as you reacted negatively to my presence until I connected with you... and yet, you can harness our magic.”
“I don’t think our ages mattered,” Harry said. It was obvious Hale was setting up Bellatrix to be the villain. Harry didn’t have a problem supporting that considering his history with the woman, though he hoped Rodolphus would forgive him. He told Hale the spells he remembered her casting at him and his friends. He briefly and painfully recounted what happened when she killed Sirius, and how happy she’d been.
“Good,” Theo responded. Harry blinked in surprise. He wasn’t sure why that would be good, unless Theo was interested in Ginny. If that was the case, then Harry worried it would set back all progress Theo had made with Ron if the redhead figured out Theo was interested in Ginny.
“Stop,” Harry squirmed as he tried to free his body from under the man. Burke ignored him as he trailed one hand down Harry’s neck. His hand lingered there, and Harry had to close his eyes when he realized the man was admiring his work. The guard caressed the tattoo he left there.
“What’s this do?” Harry asked. The words ‘Pot Shot’ were on the front, but that didn’t tell Harry much.
“You know you can always come to me if you need to talk,” McGonagall offered. Harry nodded but privately thought he hadn’t seen McGonagall as someone to confide in since first year.
“No, Potter. I don’t want to hear any more nonsense about you being a bad person. There is so much good in you. I wish you could see it. As atrocious as you think you are because of the horcrux, you need to understand that that one mistake, as terrible as it is, does not wipe away all the good in you and all the good you’ve done. I’m still with you because every day you show me that good side. I know there is another part of you. A darker part that can... create a horcrux. But Harry, you never let it out. You actively fight against it to the point you overcompensate. I know you think no one would want you if they saw that part of you, but I’m aware. I see all of you, scarhead,” Draco said, saying the last bit softly. He cupped Harry’s face between his palms. “I knew who you were when we started dating. And I’ve loved that man long before then too.”
“How do you study in Azkaban?” asked Ron incredulously.
With the benefit of being animagi, both Malfoy and Nott seemed to recover quickly. Crabbe was still moaning pitifully in the cell next to Harry, so Harry assumed the man was not an animagus. He didn’t hear anything from Lestrange’s cell. Harry suddenly wondered how many of the death eaters were animagi and may have been privy to Harry’s terrifying encounter with the dementors.
One gift down, but still two hours to go before Harry had to pretend to be sleeping, Harry pondered what other gifts he could make. Hermione’s birthday was the next one after Neville’s… but Draco’s birthday still came before both of them. Harry didn’t know if Draco would even accept a gift from Harry, assuming Harry made something he felt was good enough
“Sweet dreams,” Burke said in parting as the sound of the door locking echoed down the hall.
“Say it,” hissed Mulciber’s voice, sounding more enraged than Harry could remember. “You knew the bastard. You honestly can’t say you didn’t know he planned to rape Potter.”
“We’re not all hugging Potter, are we?” asked Goyle.
“Sure, but you have features from your mum too. Everyone says I look like my dad but have my mum’s eyes. James looks like a replica of me,” Harry said.
Holding Harry in place with one hand on his hair and the other on his chin, Burke leaned forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s. The boy’s eyes widened. He would have pulled back, but he had nowhere to go. He tried to turn his head, not caring if Burke pulled out his hair in the process, but Burke dug his fingers into Harry’s chin and nipped at Harry’s bottom lip in retaliation. In desperation, Harry struggled beneath him to free an arm, and when that didn’t work, he could do nothing more than sob helplessly. Burke chuckled against his lips.
“You are under arrest for casting the cruciatus curse on Bellatrix Lestrange last June,” stated the auror who has his wand trained on Harry. While the man didn’t have the same dramatic flair as the other wizard, his voice was loud and clear as it carried across the hall.
“Thank you again, Harry,” Lucius said as he examined the brush he was gifted. He smiled as his thumb brushed over the dragons.
“What are you-“ Harry started to ask but broke out in a surprised cry as Burke started to move his wand. A sharp pain followed where Burke’s wand touched.
“Oh? Was it for sexy times?” Harry asked.
you do.”
“Wanker,” muttered Nott as he came to the same conclusion as Harry. Burke heard him.
“Great! Let’s get that out of the way now,” Hale stated. However, instead of picking up the camera that was on the table, the man picked up a comb. To Harry’s surprise, he leaned over and started to comb through Harry’s hair.
“Of course,” Harry said.
He was only a few steps away from the room of requirement when he spotted Draco heading in his direction. His immediate happiness at seeing his crush faded quickly when he realized Draco was headed towards the room of requirement to continue with whatever it was he’d been doing all year.
“Not today,” he said. He was vague enough that Dumbledore could interpret that to mean anything from needing to discuss what happened with Burke, or even the events leading up to the crucio casting that started this whole mess. Harry didn’t think he’d ever want to talk about any of it. He would avoid the horcrux issue too, but he’d need all the help he could get if he had any hope of safely removing it.
“Morning,” Harry said, glad he hadn’t unintentionally woken the man.
“I’m happy to help where I can. Let me know if you want to know more about a particular policy. Or if you need help contacting key people,” Hale offered. “To be honest, I’m eager to see how you’ll shake things up.”
“Hello Potter,” Scrimgeour greeted. Harry though the man seemed uncomfortable but was trying to put on a calm and collected front.
Harry came to slowly, only jarring fully awake when he opened his eyes and registered he was in a hospital room. What felt like just minutes ago, he’d left Albus Dumbledore at the train station, determined to go back and help his friends. He had expected – well, he wasn’t sure what he expected, but it wasn’t this.
The man wasn’t gentle as his worked to remove the dried blood, but Albert didn’t complain. It helped that Mulciber distracted him with crass jokes. When Lucius finished his shower, he too moved to help by scrubbing Albert’s back. Lucius would have told off Mulciber for his crude comments but refrained when he realized Albert was smiling despite his pain. Albert was trying not to laugh as it would hurt his ribs.
“Here, Potter,” one of them said before sliding a food tray into Harry’s cell. Harry got up and made his way towards it. He nodded vaguely at them in thanks. They moved to give Malfoy his food, but each of them kept shooting glances back towards Harry. Self-consciously, he moved back to his cot and started picking at the food.
“I need to...” Draco straightened his posture. Harry noted he was holding himself like Lucius had insisted Harry learn. “Thank you, Potter, for... everything. I do appreciate it, but I have to... go,” Draco said resolutely and looked towards the room of requirement.
“And here I thought the novelty of seeing me on my knees for you had worn off,” Draco teased instead of the actual romantic speech he had written out.
“I’m not sure you’d want to try,” Lucius said. He elaborated when Harry looked confused, “not unless you were sure you wouldn’t also consume your own soul at the same time.” Harry had not thought of that possibility. He wondered if he’d end up an empty husk or if he’d end up as some dementor hybrid cursed to feed only on souls.
,” Burke accentuated his point by leaning down again. He didn’t try to slip his tongue in again. Instead he harshly bit at Harry’s lower lip in retaliation. Harry whimpered and tried to move away but that just caused more damage as the man clamped down refusing to let his prize leave.
So, the big dementor reveal isn’t all that shocking for those that have read the books. But it is important that Harry learns about the horcrux in him early on in this story. It’s equally important that he was surrounded by people that would support plan for researching solutions other than death.
“I suspect Draco was attempting the pulling-pigtails approach to discovering a crush,” Lucius suggested. “If he knew he has a chance with you, I imagine he would be less… mean.”
The dementors made a rattling sound that Harry assumed was their version of “hmmmmm”. They took a moment to assess the young wizard before them, unperturbed by the pitiful moans of the other prisoners.
Many of the other prisoners watched the exchange. It fueled the gossip about Burke attacking Harry. With each bruise Harry revealed as he undressed, the others got a better sense of how much damaged was done. Harry hated the sensation of all those eyes on him.
“Yes, that Potter,” drawled Malfoy. Harry thought he was enjoying himself. Someone a few cells down let out a loud laugh. The murmuring got louder and Harry’s defenses, which had been shaky since his arrest, were suddenly up and he was annoyed.
“Come along,” urged Burke and tugged roughly on Harry’s arm.
“You know, I think you’re angling for a stay in solitary after all, Nott,” said Burke.
A few quick incantations ensured that Harry’s skin was clean, his shirt was no longer stuck to the side, and the chains unravelled. The tattoo area felt a little tingly, but before Harry could feel it for himself, Burke heaved Harry up as Wiblin put away the boxes. Harry felt unsteady and couldn’t move away from Burke as he spelled Harry’s hands behind him again.
“Take your time,” Ginny offered. She looked worried, but Harry knew it was for his sake. For a moment he considered not telling her. Keeping the ring on himself until he figured out a new plan. But he knew he didn’t have a better option, and she was a big part of the reason why he created a horcrux in the first place. He needed to make sure he gave everyone a fighting chance if he failed his first time.
“What is he going to do?” asked Harry. He was feeling worried and guilty. Burke was only going after Albert because the flower. Albert had only sent it to Burke to make Harry feel better.
“Initiate roundup. Burke kissed. Potter... attacked,” the man said and his patronus ran off to deliver the message to his fellow guards.
A few people asked him random questions, such as what he’d been wearing that day, or what time he’d encountered Lestrange. More often than not Hale jumped in and challenged the relevance of question, which spared Harry from having to recall inane details. The only time Hale did not immediately stop Harry from answering a question was when Harry recounted how there hadn’t been any ministry workers around when he’d arrived that day. Naturally, Hale took the opportunity to criticize the ministry further. Unfortunately, Scrimgeour deflected the blame to Fudge rather than the current ministry employees.
The others were quiet as they waited for him to elaborate. When it became clear he wasn’t going to, Hermione just said encouragingly, “when you’re ready, we will support you,” and they all let the subject drop.
“You said yourself that it wasn’t intentional,” McGonagall returned.
The password had not changed during his imprisonment, so he didn’t have a convenient excuse to postpone whatever the meeting was about for another day.
“I know,” Harry said with a dejected sigh.
Once everyone arrived, they started by having Harry go through the formalities.  He dutifully stated his name, age, and that he understood what he was on trial for.
“Sometimes, when the house gets quiet, and it’s so quiet now, I can’t help but think how much better life would be for little Edward to have family, just more people to care...” Andromeda trailed off with a sigh. Harry squeezed the hand that was still clasped with his. “It’s too late anyway. Even if I wanted to reconnect with what little remains of my family, it’s too late.”
When he ventured out of the room, he wasn’t sure which way to go. There were too many doors in the hallway that he couldn’t even guess which one would be Draco’s... Assuming the Malfoys didn’t have a whole wing dedicated just for guests. Harry decided to chance going downstairs. He reasoned that if he didn’t find Draco in any of the common areas, he would just ask a house elf to pass on his thanks and floo home.
“He... hit me. Just a few times; it’s not like it was something he did all the time or anything. But he was really angry so he hit me that time, and locked me in my – in the cupboard,” Harry admitted. He was flooded with shame as a few of the witches and wizards broke their silence to whisper to each other. “It wasn’t too bad. I mean, it didn’t hurt for too long. I think, I think I might have unknowingly healed myself with magic.”
Breakfast was as awkward as dinner had been. Many students were still half-asleep and didn’t bother to even glance in his direction, but the ones that did made up for the rest. Harry might be used to attention, but that didn’t mean he liked it. The exception being Draco, of course. When he’d seen the Slytherins walk into the great hall, he’d been tempted to go say hello. He’d held back, unsure if more questions about Burke would come up. He thought he saw Crabbe give him a small wave, but feared it was just wishful thinking that he’d still be welcomed by them now that he had no more letters to offer. Instead of talking to them, Harry spent his time watching Draco but tried to appear like he wasn’t watching Draco.
Harry might not have been too concerned if it had only been Andromeda and Mrs. Malfoy that noticed his infatuation. After all, they had plenty of opportunities to watch Harry and Draco interact. So, when Harry realized his other friends had caught on as well, he knew he was being too obvious.
“So, you actually did it?” Lestrange voice lost its baby-talk teasing but still sounded deadly. “Which one was it?” he waited but only Harry’s angry panting answered him so he continued “Thought that you could curse a death eater and no one would care? Thought your status would save you, hmmm? Well, they know you’re not the shiny boy-hero now, don’t they? No, you go around cursing innocent-“
“And nargles, and blibbering humbingers, and dabberblimps,” Harry confirmed.
Harry was able to demonstrate enough mastery of the current lesson, so McGonagall suggested he take the rest of the class to practice the spells he’d missed and call her over if he needed aid. She kept an eye on him as she circulated the classroom, helping those that were struggling. Towards the end of the lesson, she returned to Harry’s side and asked him to demonstrate the spells he’d been working on. Harry only had enough time to explain and carefully cast two spells before the class period was over. McGonagall was pleased to see Harry had no difficulty with those spells, but wouldn’t be satisfied until Harry demonstrated them all.
“Right,” Harry smiled for the first time since he started the conversation. “... will you wear it? Keep it safe?” he asked nervously.
“What the hell are you talking about? I haven’t perved on any first-years,” Harry said with anger. “I don’t know what- wait, do you mean Goyle? When he was polyjuiced?”
Harry didn’t mind. The slew of papers Hale was carrying made it easy to hide away the letter Rodolphus begged Harry to pass on to his wife.
“There are two things you need to sign, but you could do so later and mail them to me. I mostly came to talk about your plans for improving Azkaban, and to see if you would be willing to testify on Albert’s behalf,” Hale explained.
“It’s real,” Draco said. When the others looked his way, he added “I got one a few days ago. It mentioned something only my dad would know.”
“Couldn’t sleep?” Lucius asked. He watched as the rocks circling Harry soared high so as to leave Harry’s face visible. Given that Harry was looking at Lucius, it was clear to the man that this movement was done subconsciously.
“Not at all,” Hale reassured him. “It’s far from due process, but I had plenty to use from our interviews. In fact, it might have been a blessing that you didn’t have to go over all those painful memories yet again. Runecraft certainly doesn’t seem sympathetic to what they’re putting you through. He and his minions will likely drag it out. Be prepared for some hard questions thrown your way, but it’s mostly just the verdict left. Public pressure ensured that you would be present for that at least.”
“Well, if you don’t like my company Potter, I could just leave you with your new friends,” Burke tried. Harry didn’t respond though he desperately wanted to yell at the man to leave. “Of course, it must be frustrating to have to project your voice so everyone could hear you, hmmm? Perhaps you’d like some more personal visiting time? If you’re nice, I could let one of your new friends join you in your cell for an hour or two. Hmmm?”
“I don’t know why you all seem to think Draco will agree to be my boyfriend,” Harry said. Harry knew he wasn’t irresistible.
“OK. If the professors don’t let me go to the village, I can just meet you here,” Harry said and gestured to the gate.
When Harry turned to Nott, he noticed the man was smiling at him. Harry wasn’t sure if he was imagining it, but the man almost seemed proud. Harry felt a little guilty for thinking poorly of him before. The man clearly knew his friend better than Harry. It was clear now that the change of conversation had probably helped more than empty platitudes. There was nothing Malfoy could do from Azkaban, so unless Harry helped him escape, he could only offer empty words. And even if Harry had shared how Sirius managed to escape, Harry didn’t know if the same strategy would even work for Malfoy. Could peacocks even swim?
“Minerva? As his head of house, what do you recommend?” Dumbledore asked.
“Mr. Potter, have you seen the Dark Mark on Mr. Nott?” asked Bones in a calm manner that strongly contrasted Runecraft’s harsh approach.
“Of course you did,” said Nott with an amused snort. “I might have a book in my dorm. Not sure it’ll help for this particular situation though.”
“Alright, what are you working on?” Nott asked as soon as they were alone.
Burke seemed to stew for a moment. Harry was sure the man was going to do something drastic, but to his surprise, Burke just hissed “get in line! Your shower time is over!”
“I’m sure. Your
"I'm a rabbit," said Rodolphus Lestrange.
Mrs. Weasley took charge of planning the party. Harry didn’t know where she found the spirit to organize a birthday party on the anniversary of her daughter’s death. Harry would have avoided the whole thing if he could have justified missing his son’s birthday.
it worked.
Harry must not have concealed his own concern, or pity, because Nott stated, “Severus is sure to help him, Lucius”, but he was watching Harry intently.
“I really do appreciate this, Harry,” the man said once the memories were bottled.
“You can’t – We were told – you have to make a formal request to see each prisoner. The request must detail your exact purpose of the meeting, and nothing else shall be discussed or provided that is not officially approved,” the guard stated.
Harry fell into a fitful sleep. He was woken up twice to having dementors at his cell door. The first time, Harry pretended to still be asleep. The second time, he sat up in bed after Crabbe gave a rather particularly loud whimper. Harry watched them as they watched him. There were two dementors this time, but Harry couldn’t tell if they were the same ones he’d seen before. Neither spoke. One dementor hovered back and forth from each end of the cell door. Harry thought it was trying to get as good a look at Harry as it could despite behind unable to move around him. They left after five minutes without saying a word to him. If Harry had any other visitors that night, he slept though it.
“Yes. She’s a fanatic. She wanted the orb so she’d impress Vol-sorry, You-Know-Who,” Harry answered.
“Can you heal Albert?” asked Crabbe. Harry felt guilty for not thinking of it immediately.
“You’re really one of them now,” tried Burke again. Harry made some non-committal noise, which wasn’t the reaction Burke was angling for. However, Wiblin shifted and started moving back towards the end of the hallway and Burke reluctantly followed.
tired since he ate Burke’s soul.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You can’t,” Harry said immediately.
“Arresting him was such a bad idea that I can’t even fathom what moron thought it would be a good move,” Malfoy answered shaking his head. “I don’t know how they thought this would work.”
It was true. Harry had no intention of ever leaving Draco, but he wouldn’t have proposed either. Not because he didn’t love Draco, but because he loved him too much. He would never ask Draco to tie himself even more to Harry’s life. He’d thought about it but wanted to leave Draco with the option of a clean break once he realized Harry really was a monster. But now that Draco had asked, Harry couldn’t say no. He promised to let Draco decide who was worthy of him. Unfortunately, Harry realized there was something he’d have to be painfully honest about so Draco could make an informed decision.
