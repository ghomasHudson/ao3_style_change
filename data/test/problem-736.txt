He turned back to Harry and waited only until he’d drunk half his cup of tea before yanking him from the table. They raced out of the Great Hall. Harry tried to protest. They weren’t late for the match after all. But he had no chance do so. Chatting Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs lined the corridors when they rounded the corner.
Draco frowned for a moment. “Oh, she died in a train crash when Lysandra was only two. The betrothal plans fell out a year later.”
Seeing as Draco was too busy eating, Harry shook his head for both of them. He ducked as something whizzed over his head but before he could turn to examine it Dumbledore was speaking.
There was a sharp intake of air from Draco and Harry watched as the entire Cabinet was wreathed in bright light. It shook and creaked even more vigorously no cracks appeared on the surface. Two more minutes. Would it be enough to clear the room?
Harry forced himself to keep his mouth shut as Draco spoke. If there was a point to this, he wouldn’t see it from going back and forth with Draco.
"Draco," he said with a glance at his godson. "Potter." No one could ever look so contemptuous as Snape in that moment. Even Petunia and her horse-like face couldn't muster the muscle coordination acquired only after years and years of glaring at innocent students who were expected to know the textbook by heart by the first lesson.
Draco rolled his eyes but Harry laughed to himself. Draco, it seemed, could never resist showing off.
This was not the Malfoy that had thrown insult after insult at him and it wasn't the Hogsmeade or Hospital Wing Malfoy either and Harry was floundering. He couldn't keep up with all these sides of Malfoy and he didn't know how to respond.
Harry sucked in a breath and put a hand on Draco’s chest. He didn’t push him away or lower his other hand from his arse but Draco pulled back a few inches.
Draco weighed just how much to reveal. "I've been having trouble sleeping," he said trying to get a look at the words in the notebook.
He turned Harry's first card. "The moon: betrayal or falsehood," he said which Harry thought he could relate to various aspects of his life. "I doubt we could count the number of times that happened."
His night had been blessedly undisturbed and wondered who he had to thank for that. Then again, he usually slept relatively well after jerking off, it didn't have anything to do with Potter.
Draco was feeling far more satisfied than he should have, Stone had been a thorn in his side since fourth year, he should have dealt with him a long time ago. The wave of euphoria didn't last long however, as he realised just how cold and uncomfortable he was. A visit to the kitchens for a cup of tea followed by a stop by the library sounded good. He would read the books Dumbledore had mentioned and perhaps Remus Lupin's notes again, he had been in a right state the last time.
It had taken Blaise, Nott, Pansy and a few seventh years to pull him off them and even then there had been blood. Less of it than Draco had wanted, a few cuts and scrapes hadn’t been enough to sate the wolf.
A woman had her arm around his. She did not look as old as him but not much younger either. She wore no robes. Instead, she had on an impressive travelling cloak embroidered with rich colours. Beneath that she wore a simple pair of loose-fitting cotton pants and a large billowing shirt. He strawberry blonde hair sat atop her head in a high bun. A single jade pin held it in place though wisps of it had slipped from the tight hold.
Draco saw it before it happened. He saw it in the monster’s eyes. In the pale figure that lay beneath it with a wretched look on his face.
Draco's body snapped to attention. Potter was making his way towards him looking rather downcast, if he could say so.
Harry clenched his fists. He knew Malfoy was purposefully riling him up because he had refused to take the bait earlier. He didn't want things to get out of hand but no sane person would blame him if they did at this stage.
There was no way of telling whether he would take Harry’s words from the previous night seriously. But there had been nothing to suggest conjecture when Malfoy had spoken. Or when he had saved Harry’s life during the match.
“When you are my age, certain things become very difficult to ignore. Sometimes because they seem more real, more necessary.”
He dipped the fingers of his left hand into the bowl and hissed at the coolness of the liquid. He had to turn his body at an awkward angle to both keep his hand in Malfoy's and swab his forehead with the cold liquid but after a while the shivering went down and Madam Pomfrey said he could stop.
"I'm just saying, there's a price to pay for being such a big twat. Hope there's more where that came from," he said nastily.
Some had thought it a part of some elaborate plan to humiliate Harry. They’d made lewd jokes and slapped his back and asked him if Harry begged for it like a bitch.
This new Malfoy he did not know well but perhaps he would like to. Perhaps they didn't always have to fight. Perhaps they didn't have to be enemies anymore. Perhaps something good could come from this. He shifted so that the books on top of him slid to the floor.
Harry glared at him in alarm but Draco only inclined his head towards Cygnus. Harry turned to him and realised he'd been saying something to him. He glanced around but no one came to his aid.
Harry glanced at the people in the drawing-room. The sun was climbing lower in the sky with every minute.
But he was not the only one who might give in if Harry didn't stop. He looked down at himself and saw that he was painfully hard too.
His body still ached for the bite even though his desire to have Draco was sated. It had been four months since their mating and he still hungered for it, a part of him knew he should be terrified but the part that didn’t care always won out.
Draco knew they had some way to go beyond snogging in dark corners. But by merlin, Potter’s obstinacy would end him. His complacency only showed its head when Draco had him pressed against a wall.
Draco shifted his luggage to his other hand but didn’t hold his hand out, instead he watched Harry. Slowly, he reached for it and enveloped the fingers in his own. It felt… like it always did. Then he looked up at Draco and the noise of the station rushed back. He glanced away, mostly to hide his nervous smile.
The days before Christmas break flew by faster than Draco anticipated. For the first time, he found himself with more packing than he knew how to handle in such a short time. Blaise, who was zipping his travelling case shut opposite him, flashed him a knowing smirk.
Harry held his breath, sure Cygnus would challenge his own wife just to prove a point. In the end, he fixed his brother with a solid glare and said, “I apologise.”
He didn’t know what he was doing or why it worked but Draco took two more sips. Tears began to trickle down his cheeks on the third and this time Harry took the almost empty cup from him.
Was this what Malfoy was up to? Had Harry followed him to the sixth floor just to watch him brew illicit potions?
Harry leaned into the touch before he knew what he was doing. Draco’s gaze flicked to his lips but a bout of coughing from the other end of the room interrupted them. Draco rolled his eyes and Harry glared when the coughing resolved itself after he and Draco moved away from each other.
He chose to ignore the fact that one scent stood out amongst the rest, one that called out to him. It clung to Granger and smelled wrong on her which caused his nose to twitch. He ignored it – along with Blaise's previous comment about 'sniffing' Potter – because it was just a side effect of the imminent shift.
It took him a moment to work out the dosages while factoring in how long he wanted the effects to last. After frowning in frustration and wishing for a scrap of parchment, he decided on five sips of the
must have done something. Why was he glaring at Harry like he was the cause of all this? And it wasn't the first time, just a few minutes before Malfoy's outburst he had given Harry that same murderous glare as though he had something to be upset about.
“Of course everything is not alright,” Draco spat. “Look at me. I need time to recover and you need to… do something so just–”
Harry's nose wrinkled as he pushed at the werewolf with his hands. Its grey fur was plush and soft – he had to tamp down on the urge to work his fingers through it experimentally. He took a discreet sniff and could've sworn it smelled something like Malfoy if you ignored the distinct smell of animal.
He forced himself to go to the refreshments table so he would have something to do. No one here knew him here except for the Malfoys, Blacks, Parkinson and Zabini. He was confident no one would ask him to dance, why would they anyway?
If he’d been a nobody, there would’ve been little issue with his coming to Malfoy Manor. He wouldn’t have to look over his shoulder every moment either. And he wouldn’t have to doubt Draco’s intentions then reproach himself for it. And drown in guilt hours later only to repeat the cycle over and over.
“I often wished that Armand and I had switched positions. That I had been born a bastard. I would gladly sacrifice nine years in this life of captivity for freedom in the rest of it.” The smile on his face was wistful.
“Well, my family will look poorly on… whatever this is. More so than they do now. They will make certain to ruin things between us. And father will ensure you’re ruined well and thorough in the public eye when the opportunity presents itself. Then they’ll convince the world you cast some sort of… when I…”
He took Snape's turned back as an opportunity to collect himself stuffing his hands into his pockets so that his godfather would not see their shaking. Overall, the
Harry sighed and toed a few more petals away. His legs were beginning to hurt from standing for so long but he didn’t want to sit down yet.
Harry’s realisation that Malfoy's wolf form was nothing like that of Lupin which he had seen in third year was belated and he wondered about it. Did all werewolves not look the same? Did it have something to do with the potion that Malfoy had drunk?
Draco’s mind summoned images of Blaise and his mother standing against Voldemort’s will with only a fraction of wealth and less status than the Malfoy family.
McNair sneered at him but a nod from Blaise and he prodded Draco in the ribs. He let out a growl of pain and McNair dribbled some of the liquid into his mouth. Draco shrunk back, sputtering. It tasted fouler than it smelled and it felt like iron as it sunk to his stomach. McNair moved closer and Draco swore at him.
A thought struck his mind and he panicked, fumbling for his watch. How long had it been since he promised to meet Harry? He let out a sigh of relief, there were still a few minutes to one. He felt for the bond but nothing was amiss, Harry seemed happy.
Tonks huffed and left the room grumbling to herself. Harry tugged Draco out of the dining room and up the stairs.
She had known it wouldn't be easy going public with their relationship seeing as Theo was one of the 'eligible bachelors' at Hogwarts. The kind of person girls had fantasies about. But she didn't think it would be this hard. She constantly received dirty looks in the hallways and notes telling how unworthy she was of his affection.
. A dubious description for something he would be unable to see but time was ticking. He could not afford to sit back, the sooner he got over with it, the better.
Harry wasn’t supposed to bring up the conversation they’d had in the manor but he didn’t know how else to convey his meaning to Draco.
Everything that had led up to this was the easy way out. He’d allowed himself to take the mark out of fear. He’d brought Harry here because it was easier than open defiance. He’d succumbed to Harry’s charm because a part deep inside him wanted nothing more than to be held.
Draco’s fingers grasped his hips but adjusted the angle of his body so that he loomed over Harry instead.
“You are not to rearrange anything in this house,” he said to Kreacher the next day. “I expect to find things as they are when I return.”
“We’ll need to have sex,” he said holding Harry’s gaze. “Not mucking about in the sheets. Actual sex. It’s part of the ritual.”
He must not have done it well enough because the boy flinched and cast a nervous glance around the untidy dorm. “Um… are you Harry Potter?”
The sound of voices drifted in through the ajar door. Nott stepped into the room on Pansy’s heels looking as unobtrusive as ever. Pansy crossed to the centre of the room and glanced at Draco and Blaise. She didn’t deign to acknowledge Nott's presence as he strolled across the room and busied himself with his packing.
“I’m not the only one…” he shifted his shoulder a little to the left, “… who needs your help tonight.”
Narcissa poured him a cup of tea and set some biscuits on a plate for him though she knew he would not eat them. Even while he had been living at their house, he had hardly eaten a thing with the rest. He preferred ordering Wormtail to milk Nagini – a distasteful process but not as distasteful as the act of drinking the milk itself.
At the opposite end of the room, Malfoy's dark-haired friend Parkinson looked just as stunned, visibly fighting the urge to follow her friend out of the Hall. His other friend Zabini sat expressionless, staring... right at Harry with what was quickly morphing into a murderous glare.
. Draco wanted to yell at him but his limbs refused to move. Blaise ignored his glare and nudged Goyle with his foot.
But they both knew it would be within the next twenty-four hours, as it had been for the past six days. Draco nodded and Harry gave him one last look, trying for a smile before he headed down to the kitchen.
He could hear Pansy's shouts of laughter as she followed behind Blaise who gave chase after Malfoy. They ran until their legs gave out and they collapsed in the grass their breath coming out in short quick puffs, content smiles on their faces. "This is nice," Pansy said. Blaise snorted but he had a small smile on his face too. "I don't want it to change, promise we'll stick together no matter what."
Harry sat opposite Ron and Hermione with various aromatic dishes between them, unable to resist the smile that found its way onto his face. He was glad to be back at Hogwarts if only to escape the Dursleys for a few more months. The summer had seemed especially long and he would have contemplated finding his own way to the Burrow had Dumbledore not given him a proper reason for his continued stay there.
He didn’t want to lose Ron but he didn’t want to feel shame every time he looked at him either. It was all too much of a mess, too much for him to process at once. The only silver lining to the entire situation was Hermione’s reaction though it took a few days after the incident in the Great Hall before she spoke to him.
He couldn't very well owl father and tell him it didn't work. If there was one thing Death Eaters knew not to do it was telling the Dark Lord of their failure. He had qualms shooting the messenger. Draco kicked at the cabinet and sighed.
Harry couldn’t get the image of Malfoy thundering something into the belly of the storm out of his mind. He’d said it was nothing but Harry shouldn’t be here. It was too close. He shouldn’t be alive. Was that why Malfoy was staying back in the Hospital Wing? The altitude hadn’t affected him as much as it had Harry. And he’d been in a much better state at the end of the match than Harry had.
The darkness of his eyes and strength of his grip was at odds with his restraint. Harry waited, sure there was more to this. Draco watched him back and Harry knew he would have to ask the questions if he wanted answers.
But Draco couldn’t hear him and Harry’s voice was drowned out by the sounds of his panting. He sagged forward and was faintly aware of the blood that dripped down his neck mingling with tears he didn’t know he had shed.
When the tub was full, Harry took off his shirt, vest and trousers. Draco wouldn’t be back for a few hours, he would take a bath and see what he wanted to do after.
He could spare no fear for this ancient, wheezing man who looked like he could hardly leave his bed without help.
"Having quite a bit of fun, aren't we Mr. Malfoy," said Professor Slughorn standing before him his pudgy features arranged in an expression of disdain.
“Fine…” She inhaled and straightened. “I just wanted to tell you that I’m proud of you. For everything you’ve done.”
Harry didn’t know what it meant that Dean and Seamus felt comfortable enough to speak in Neville’s presence. His mind went back to the long silence when he’d walked into the room…
Beside him, Narcissa's hair fell over her shoulders brushing against the fabric of her robes. They were the same ones she’d worn at tea earlier today. They looked as perfect as they had hours ago.
Harry pushed the platter aside with a disgusted look and Draco took a sip of his tea, stretching his legs out before him.
“No,” Draco said with such force that Zabini stopped in his tracks. “If you go, we won’t look like three young rich bachelors pondering our next misdemeanour, will we?”
his brain whispered but that didn't count. The most he'd done was hug him and that wasn't gay, was it?
Harry shifted a little and his thigh brushed against Draco’s crossed knee. He sat facing Harry with one knee balanced on the couch and his other leg on the ground. He'd taken off his shoes and socks. The sight of his bare feet was almost like seeing him naked. Harry had been unable to stop staring until Draco shot him a look.
“I was initiated last summer.” The lines of his body had once been so telling, now they betrayed nothing. “They came to the manor, Voldemort and the other death eaters. They operated from there for a while, received guests, finalised dealings, dealt with… difficult people. My aunt Bellatrix…”
Harry found himself in the library more and more as the days passed though always without Ron and Hermione. For once he went without being forced to. He went to get away from her and Ron, to find a quiet place to sit and breathe. To find a place to do all the work that had begun to pile up at an alarming rate.
Had anyone truly liked Grimmauld Place? Perhaps one had to be an outsider with little connection to it but Draco had a connection to it through Alphard not to mention his uncanny knowledge of the layout.
When Draco got back to the Slytherin common room that evening, he was surprised to see two letters on his bedside stand. He instantly thought of his parents but dismissed the idea. His mother had asked him to write to her implying that she would be unable to do so herself. Who else would write to him then? He decided to take a look at them if only to quell his curiosity.
But Malfoy was the one being relatable, it definitely wasn't him. Harry liked to think he was always relatable. The Slytherin could have decided to be a prat the whole way and claimed Harry had accosted him in the middle of the night – even though Harry could not grab much less heave a two-hundred-pound werewolf. But he'd kept his words strangely neutral. As though he didn't want to anger Harry which was unbelievable but the only sane reason he could think of.
Haneul chuckled and Draco’s gaze moved to where he stood leaning against the wall, the broken pieces of his wand still in his hand. He hadn’t the fourth year was still there and the realisation that he’d witness the exchange between Harry and himself unsettled him.
“Don’t you see it?” she said after a shrill laugh. “Only Malfoys can invite people to their festivities. If Draco here didn’t do it…”
He couldn’t resist looking up. The arch of Draco’s body sent a ripple of pleasure through him. And then Draco’s eyes fluttered open. His gaze burned into him and Harry’s breath hitched.
Stopping was far from Harry's mind at the moment and he squirmed to show Draco just that. He received a growl when his thigh grazed Draco’s crotch.
“I don’t know. There’s not much information on curse scars. And certainly not one as unique as yours.”
Severus looked up from the parchment before him, his hair hung limply about his head and he looked in need of some coffee.
There had been no ‘us’ in the agreement but Dobby and Harry shared a bond, there would be no objection.
He led them down the long route to the main entrance of the station passing over the bridge Harry had taken with Hagrid so many years ago. It was more crowded but the crowd was distinctly muggle and from Draco’s frown, it was clear he’d never come this way.
“You simply must tell me all about the semester so far. I’ve been hearing all sorts of things about Hogwarts.” She shook her head, a teasing smile on her lips. “The English will never lose their taste for gossip, my grandmother always said.”
In a way, Draco’s insecurities about right and wrong had always been visible to him but he’d been write about his surety. Even Harry had been fooled into thinking they didn’t exist and it had taken Draco’s questions about right and wrong – questions that otherwise seemed simple – for him to  pay attention.
The sounds in the rest of the room had faded. As though they had only been pretending to carry on the conversation. But now that Blaise had woken the dragon, listening to what transpired took precedence. Draco would not allow this to descend to a rehash of their second year.
“Oh, that’s not what you were thinking?” Draco asked spreading his fingers on the railing with a meaningful look.
He looked up to find Malfoy’s attention was no longer on him. Harry, who didn't have the skill to perform a similar concealment and transportation charm, growled.
Malfoy was not moving anymore and the sight of him laying limp sent Harry into a panic. He stabbed viciously at the squid but it would not let go. Its limbs coiled tighter around Malfoy instead and dragged him deeper. Into the cold depths of the lake, down to the very bottom. At this rate they would freeze to death. Harry felt himself slipping, he too was running out of air and if he did not get to the surface soon enough...
His drink was halfway gone when he spotted Ginny on the dance floor. Her hips were swaying to the rhythm and her head was bobbing back and forth but it was not her movements that captivated him. It was Nott's. The blond boy wasn't doing much but the way he held her hips and sometimes pulled her close only to grind against her made his heart rate double.
They had all risked their lives on more than one occasion for him and every time someone did that it conferred value onto his life.
The last thing he wanted to do was talk but whatever Draco wanted to say would nag at him if he didn’t get it out now.
Harry wanted to do both, he wanted to end it all – the pain and suffering and loss. But he was only one person.
Harry tried to imagine Sirius smoking on the porch with a devilish smirk, his face visible by the glow of his cigarette. He liked that Sirius, he did what he wanted when he wanted to.
“You can tell my mother that she has had free reign over my life for sixteen years. I will eat breakfast here if it pleases me. If she wants me in the dining room so badly, she can come and remove me herself.”
But somewhere in the sound of voices that was growing clearer and clearer, was another voice he knew well. He forced his eyes open and searched for its owner. Tears leaked from the corners of his eyes. Relief flooded him when he saw its owner.
"I'm sure she can take care of herself," Harry said as he got out his quill and books for the lesson.
Lupin was the only Order member who made an effort to stop by every day. He rarely stayed long but Harry liked knowing he could look forward to his visits. He also enjoyed the understanding he and Draco seemed to share.
The question was not unexpected but surprised him nonetheless. He always thought Harry had known, hadn’t he once explained it to him?
Malfoy had been serious when he’d said no to Harry watching him shift again. He had received a stern letter on Sunday morning detailing the lengths Malfoy would go to, if he caught even a whiff of his scent in the Forbidden Forest, to teach him why heeding advice was important.
Like him, Lysandra had not known her mother well, if at all. At least she knew her father. It would be cruel to have them both taken away and have nothing but the Malfoy family to fall back on.
He'd expected Blaise to... God, he was so stupid. As if Blaise would ever make a mistake like that again.
“Kreacher thought you would like to refresh yourselves while I clean it,” he said with a tightness to his lips.
Malfoy took a longer time to get to his feet. An action that appeared to cost him twice as much energy.
Malfoy stalked towards him, the dark glint never leaving his eyes. This time Harry did move. He stepped back against his better judgment until he had his back against a wall. He may have conceded the distance but he refused to look away. If Malfoy wanted to play this game then Harry would play too. And he would give as good as he got.
What had Lupin done to him? Harry ached to comfort him, instinct nearly had him closing the distance between them but Draco looked up and Harry froze.
The latter gave Draco pause. Had Pansy let it slip to Blaise that Draco wanted to speak to her? Why would Blaise be writing to him when there was nothing more to be said between them?
Draco meanwhile was wriggling underneath him. His attempts to get Blaise off him were accompanied by incoherent mumblings about his missing duvet.
"What is a student doing here after dark?" asked Firenze as if only realising that he was talking to a student.
"Very well," he said as he resumed walking, tacitly indicating for Harry to follow. "What do you want?"
Draco opened his arms to him anyway, sometimes it was easier to surrender to instinct, not to think too much.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief but the feeling was quickly washed away when he saw Potter's head, left arm and right thigh wrapped in bandages. "What-?" he asked resisting the urge to run to the bed.
Draco wished Harry would filter his emotions, the confusion and apprehension were enough to set his gut roiling. The distrust for Severus he could appreciate but everything else only set his own emotions on edge too.
He wore ill-fitting jeans and a jumper that looked large enough to hide a bludger in. He didn’t bother to hide it as his eyes roamed over Draco but there was something different there today.
The skin looked healed well enough, no angry red lines but there were fresh scars that looked week-old.
Suddenly, his eyes flashed open and shame spread through Harry. He could feel his cheeks begin to burn.
Harry tugged at his shirt with a sigh. He didn’t have to have had a family to know this wasn’t normal, going down to dinner knowing some part of you may not survive it. Draco turned to face him when they reached the landing.
A certain thrill filled his chest, like the morning sun which slowly became brighter until it reached its zenith. He didn't know why he was doing this but something inside him was telling him to keep going. To do more.
“You can do this,” he said. “Don’t think too much before you speak. Trying to be clever always trips people in the end.”
That Harry took greater care with his players could be considered a disadvantage. But even now, he ensured none of them played beyond their limits. They’d whinged about it but he remained unrelenting.
So, he made his way as silently as he could down the stairs to the common room. A few people were already awake and padding around in pyjamas or lounging on couches with some reading. It was too early for a weekday but there was no way Draco was going back to sleep if he was going to have another... incident.
“There really are ghosts in the East Wing. Ghosts of my ancestors and their pureblood ideals would shock even you.”
He had been on the seventh floor again but he didn't want to dampen the mood with such talk. He bent his head over the parchment continued writing his essay.
“Shit,” he said running his hands through his hair. “Trelawney is going to be an utter bitch today.”
Harry didn’t know why he didn’t step back even as his body begged him to do so. Even when he saw the glint in Malfoy’s eyes that told him he should choose his next words with care.
Draco didn’t turn to look at him, expecting something more. Potter drew his attention when he unfolded his legs and moved towards him.
So why lead him to his doom? And if not to his doom then why bring him to the Manor where they would despise and revile him? Draco could hear the cogs turning in Blaise’s mind. He would figure it out before Pansy. He was sure of that. Blaise appreciated intricacies as much as she appreciated details.
Draco who was dressed in a simple pair of trousers and a light shirt did not look amused. His hand gripped Harry’s arm and yanked him away and Harry was so shocked that he let himself be drawn to Malfoy's side with little more than a grunt.
He liked the feeling of barely filling his air with lungs then snatching it away before it could even taste it.
However, this time it was to the weak rays of sunlight and an empty bed. He stretched his limbs and smiled faintly when he heard something pop. He was tired of being in bed even though it had only been one night. It felt like he'd been trapped in the Hospital Wing all weekend. The Quidditch match seemed like a distant memory now. He was sure it would not remain so but he was content to just lay there for now and pretend that it was.
Harry jolted awake when Ron yelled that brunch was almost over. He yelled for Harry to have a bath now if he wanted enough time to give the captain’s speech before the match.
"I can't believe it," said Ron as the three of them sat in the Charms classroom waiting for Professor Flitwick to make an appearance. They had the class with the Ravenclaws who sat on one end of the classroom engrossed in their books only looking away to shoot disdainful glares at whoever spoke too loudly.
For years everyone around him had planned out of his life. His birth, life’s purpose and death had all been foretold in a single prophecy. He’d sat and listened as people said where to go, how to act. Whom to speak to and how to speak to them. He’d had little choice in most of it and he wouldn’t let Ron take this away, unknowingly or otherwise.
“You called for me?” he asked glancing around the room with feigned disinterest. “You should have someone do the dusting around here.”
Harry wore only a jumper and jeans, nothing underneath the jumper. He shook his head when the house elf turned his wide-eyed gaze on him. He vanished as Narcissa Malfoy stepped into the foyer.
Even so, there were things he would have to do by himself. Blaise, McNair and Warrington, and Haneul all needed watching. He didn’t think the latter saving his life warranted removal of suspicion. It only reinforced the fact. Why would he “save” Draco, a Slytherin who was nothing but rude to him in the Hospital Wing?
Harry thought back to the one lying in his trunk. He’d only managed a few pages but he wasn’t all that good at writing and most of his sentences were made up of random descriptions or bits of dialogue.
Besides, she had saved a small fortune in his name under a trust over the years. She didn’t know he knew this but he’d heard her discuss it with Snape when he came over for dinner at her insistence two summers ago.
Blossom pouted as Pomfrey fed him his potions causing some of the dark liquid to dribble down his chin. Draco snorted. What a child.
And she left the room without another word. Blaise who had been watching the exchange with some degree of curiosity turned to face Draco. His eyes bore something akin to confusion. Blaise was never confused. He always understood what he needed when he needed to.
He writhed and twitched in agony for what seemed an eternity before the pain began to recede. He was whimpering and his limbs felt hot but when he looked up there was nothing.
Once Harry was clothed, they moved to the writing desk. It was barely large enough for the both of them so they dragged it to the window seat so it could function like a booth. They ate in silence for the first five minutes, each both too hungry to speak much. When Draco had eaten enough to sate his immediate hunger, he took a sip of tea and let out a breath.
The rest were not long in coming after that. Tonks arrived with Kingsley and Mundungus Fletcher less than twenty minutes later. They brushed away his offer to take their coats with questions about Hogwarts. Quidditch was one of the topics of interest – unsurprisingly – as well as Defence, a known favourite of his.
"Yes," Draco said though with none of the malice his voice had contained before. "Some of us are actually busy during the day you know."
McGonagall ordered everyone back to their common rooms and Hermione stomped on his foot when he started to protest. She nodded at McGonagall and promised to return to Gryffindor Tower at once. Harry shook off her grip once they were out of earshot. “What are you doing?”
Draco was sure that after those prudish Hufflepuffs, the Gryffindors would be the first to get drunk. Oh my, he could see it now. He was almost disappointed that he would be missing the party.
The sounds of cheering floated from the Castle to the Forbidden Forest in a miasma of excitement and anticipation as Draco Malfoy picked his way among gnarly roots and bush undergrowth of the forest. The bright moonlit his way so that he did not need to cast a Lumos Charm or carry a lamp.
He winced when Drakard began to slide the needle out of his skin. He cursed and took a deep breath. It stung more than it should have and he was still biting his tongue long after the needle was out of his skin.
Harry watched the colours emerging from her wand and seconds later tendrils of them reached down to the figure on the bed. He jerked and cried out but she held him down.
Harry peered over his shoulder at the porch. It was Ha grid’s fault for not coming in, now all he did was attract attention from the neighbours.
“Well, this is how things are going.” He itched to find Blaise and retrieve his wand, he felt powerless without it even though he knew he was anything but. “Where’s Dumbledore.”
"We don't want you to think we're attacking you-" Pansy started her attention partially held by her manicured nails.
Well, if they hadn't before, the other Slytherins hated him for sure. He felt like he could laugh but somehow he couldn't bring his muscles to do much more than twitch.
Harry was cut short by the sight of Lupin and Tonks on the steps of Grimmauld Place. Her hair was bubblegum pink and she had a wad of the stuff between her teeth but they both bore equal expressions of anger on their faces.
"Okay." Then he realised Malfoy must need something otherwise he wouldn't have called him here and it probably had to do with their
"No problem," Harry said. "I was planning on meeting someone too." He didn't want Ginny to feel obligated to spend the entire time by his side and he didn't plan on third-wheeling either.
Had the Slytherins snapped and finally done something to him? Draco didn’t want to fool himself into thinking his absence was all that kept them at bay. They had tormented Nott plenty while he was still rooming here but he had never let it go unnoticed – at least not since the latter part of his fourth year. But Nott himself was so little of a threat that they’d stopped bothering him by the end of fifth-year.
McNair sputtered and a faint sense of triumph rose in Harry. He’d never seen any other Slytherin get such a dressing down from Snape.
Alphard and Armand, as notable members of this society, had left earlier. They’d told him to keep calm and keep his wits about him. A had steward announced them as they stepped into the drawing-room. Alphard's full titles were actually something to behold though the steward butchered Armand's in a way that reeked of foul play.
“I might not know what’s in those letters but I know you,” he said cupping his cheek. “I know what makes you agitated.”
He felt Harry exhale beside him and Draco wondered if he knew the full meaning of his words. Ever since Voldemort had become such a prominent figure in their lives, all distractions were welcome. Draco rubbed circles into his hand and told himself he was lucky to have this, there were only so many times he could cheat death, only so many chances at happiness he would get.
It was emerald green like everything else she carried. Draco had learned long ago not to ask why or if she got tired of the colour. The answer to both questions was always no.
He moved his body a little, then a little more and soon he was moving back and forth like Ginny had shown him. He closed his eyes and smiled until he bumped into someone.
Draco sighed and wondered why Harry hadn’t bothered to explain this. If they kept this up, Filch would sniff them out before long.
Harry didn’t realise he’d forgotten about taking a shower until Ron drew back the curtain and frowned at him. "What's taking you so long, Harry? I'm starving."
His cock was painfully erect and Draco’s calm strokes were doing nothing to alleviate the sensation.
Draco didn’t buy it but Harry was suddenly tired, his body ached for rest. If he left now he might be able to catch a few hours of sleep before he lost his sanity. When he’d dreamed of becoming part of the Order, this hadn’t been what he had in mind.
Harry noted the use of the title and not the name. Abraxas made a noise of disgust. He flicked his wrist as though dismissing a house elf.
He pulled out at once. This time Draco did moan. Harry slid his hardened cock into his mouth again, slow and steady. His tongue roamed. Draco's fingers tangled in his hair. He groaned and pushed himself further in until Harry had taken all of him in his mouth.
“Of that, there can be no doubt. Though whether it is for better or worse remains to be seen.” He drew in a deep breath, looking his age for one brutal moment. “However, Severus and believe you would have failed the task all the same.”
He paced three times before the large empty wall thinking of a place to relax. Two large double doors appeared. Harry pushed through them and stepped into the large sitting room. There was a fire going and a few chairs scattered around the room. A few candles bathed the room in soft yellow light while giving off a faint hint of sandalwood. Harry scanned the room as he took off his invisibility cloak which he tossed on an armchair.
This was the wrongness he’d felt yesterday. His mind had been unable to process his own shame but there was nothing to hide behind now.
Ginny immediately reached out for it. "Stop," she started to say but Lavender's eyes were already traveling down the parchment and Parvati was peering over her shoulder to get a closer look.
"Well, Slytherin booked the pitch this week so maybe next week," he said. Though he got the impression Ron had wanted to talk strategy and not pitch-booking schedules.
A scuffle on the steps was followed by slower, more assured footsteps. Two sets, not heavy like Crabbe or Goyle… The scuffle continued halfway down the stairs but then stopped and the person grunted in irritation.
He sat shivering, face pressed against the cool window until the sound of pots and pans woke him from his doze. The streets outside were lit by lamps now but that sound… For a moment Harry thought he could smell paprika in the air. He was on his feet and halfway before the felt that void where the bond should be again.
But this hurt. Draco had hurt him and he knew it and there was no hint of remorse in his gaze and that hurt most of all and if he could…
Harry pulled on his Gryffindor robe after that. His name and team number emblazoned his jersey but it was traditional to wear the robe over it. There was also the fact that his now read
“No, it’s not nothing,” he said. “And unfortunately for us, nothing will stop my mother from having us for tea. So, you have two options.”
“She wants me to stop provoking my grandparents. Abraxas in particular. She swears she cares little for him but he's still a pillar of the Malfoy dynasty.”
Harry was lost for words. He couldn’t help that his eyes roamed Malfoy’s face and moved from his lips to his blazing grey eyes. Eyes which had burned silver last night.
"Brown, Patil!" she called. "Since you seem so invested in reading each other’s futures you can be the first to present them to the class five minutes to time." Harry thought he heard Ron sigh in relief. "Followed by Potter and Weasley."
It was an empty threat, they both knew his claws alone would not be enough. What Blaise lacked in technique he made up for in speed.
The wall above it was empty except for a thick layer of paint. It must have been painted over, more than once. Harry took a deep breath and shut the door behind him. This would only seem weird if he made it weird.
"Fine," he gritted out and Firenze looked visibly pleased. "But you have to be gone the minute the full moon comes out."
Ginny sat on the two-seater couch with Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil. The conversation shifted too fast for her to keep up with but seemed to be centred mostly on gossip and the who's-who of the school. They tried to lure Ginny into the conversation but the fifth-year girl found herself struck by boredom each time, which was abnormal as she had been very happy to gossip and talk and laugh a few months ago. Now, their conversations seemed almost childish to her but she couldn't very well up and leave.
He couldn't tell if Harry was shocked or amused when he said, “There haven’t been any marriage rites.”
Ron looked at him warily from where he was standing beside Hermione. Harry could tell there was something he wanted to ask but he was holding back and he would be damned if he let his friend bring up Quidditch right now.
Draco's face fell as the unwanted feelings rushed back in. To Pansy's left, Blaise had sobered as well, all traces of laughter had disappeared from his face.
Zabini’s grin was smooth across his face. He raised his cup to his lips and took a long sip, eyes never leaving Harry's as he did. His pupils were blown wide and Harry had a feeling he'd maybe had some of that
He decided he would check on the potion tomorrow, maybe add a dash of the remaining asphodel root just to spice things up a little... that sounded good.
Harry had a good mind to stand his ground but he had no real reason to refuse other than refusal’s sake and he
Harry concealed the sound of incredulity at the back of his throat with a cough. He doubted Nott was nice to Ginny
Overall, Harry thought practice went rather well and was happy enough to release the team half an hour to supper.
Someone would come to find him soon enough and when they did… well, Hermione would raise hell and Ron would no doubt back her up. Dean and Seamus would forestall them as long as they could but Seamus hated to get involved in their matters.
"Touché," he said crossing his arms. "Harry Potter getting more action than me. I never thought I’d live to see the day."
Hermione refused to stop and soon people began to stare. Harry growled under his breath and turned to face her knowing he wouldn't make it far if a crowd gathered.
" But he knew it was too late. The monster crashed into him knocking them both to the ground. Draco landed on a sharp root and grunted as pain flashed beneath his eyelids. His wand flew out of his hand and landed somewhere to his left. He gritted his teeth and began to flail his limbs in every direction.
"You came in here..." Harry started but his hand reached to his hair as he tried to find a way to string the words together, "Drunk."
Which puzzled Harry because there wasn’t anything but physical closeness between them in this moment.
Harry set aside the clothes he had been folding and walked around the bed. Draco’s posture was rigid and his breaths were huff of anger. Harry reached for his hand and hoped he hadn’t miscalculated. Draco did not meet his gaze but he didn’t push him away either.
“As I was saying, my mother intimated that certain traditions were to proceed as expected. One of the more celebrated ones is the annual Masque, now held during Christmas but not always so. Another one of the traditions is meeting the family. It never happens so soon but Malfoys tend to be irrational. One can only expect my parents to make such a request on such short notice –”
“There will be things to do tomorrow. Not to mention Alphard will arrive in the mid-morning. The last thing I want is for him to put ideas in your head.”
“Whispers?” Draco said, interest piqued. Harry recognised the weariness in his eyes and knew he would fall asleep as soon as he lay down. “Do tell.”
"Yeah," Harry said and Zabini waved it off looking every bit the gracious host. He was still dancing to the music and Harry tried not to watch his movements too closely.
His fingers tightened around his broom, pulling up short of the ground. He was painting as he descended to the ground and only then did something strike him. He’d gone right, the bludger should have struck his right shoulder but he’d used his right hand to…
Harry found himself lost in the letters dancing across the page. Malfoy had no trouble writing faster than Harry could ever dream of writing. How he managed to do it while retaining such perfection was a mystery. Everything about Malfoy seemed too close to perfect. From the ends of silvery hair that brushed against his collar bones when he bent forwards. To the pressed uniform that he somehow found comfortable enough to wear to the late hours of the night.
"Never mind," he said getting off the bed. He slid his feet into his shoes and straightened his clothes.
Draco sighed and flung himself onto the bed. His limbs brushed against the edge of the book Harry had been trying to read on bonding and mating rituals. It was as dreary and forgettable as the last one. He had a good mind to make his peace with Draco’s jibes and spare himself the pain of reading this. Merlin knows it would be worth it.
He didn’t expect Abraxas to hear but his eyes snapped back to him, keen Malfoy eyes. Rheumy but no less discerning for it. Harry stilled, fingernails biting into his palm.
His wet fingers grasped Harry’s hair and pulled his head from the pillow. They felt cool against his scalp. Harry stared up at him. His eyes met Draco’s own and he knew this was it. He could see the raw power in his gaze. He could feel it, smell it. He wanted to roll around in it until he reeked of it.
“I told Dumbledore I would do what was right and in the end, I did what you wanted, just like he did, just like everyone around you does.”
It must have been a dream because Draco wore the whitest shade of white Harry had ever seen and the edges of his body glowed and shimmered when he moved.
Neville smiled as though he knew what he was thinking.“My aunt is a queer too. My grandmother doesn’t like it but she couldn’t stop her if she wanted to.”
Harry watched in confusion as Draco took a step back. He kept his gaze on him, the same steady caramel colour Harry knew signified his arousal. Only when he’d moved to deeper into the room where the hay was strewn across the floor did he begin to understand.
She missed his shaky inhale. He hoped she did. "The Quidditch pitch, Astronomy Tower, wash closet. Whichever you want."
Draco was vaguely aware of Myrtle crossing her arms with a huff before disappearing to wherever she went when she wasn't bothering him.
Behind her was the Vanishing Cabinet and Haneul moved around it inspecting the sides and the door which was now shut.
He reclined on the bed, breathing shallow. A sudden need to touch, to feel, to taste overcame him and he had to roll over to stifle the pain.
Draco cut him a side glance. “I have to call on the power of the house which is rooted in my claim to its ownership.”
He walked to Drakard and said something to him. They shook hands and Draco smiled. Drakard did something that looked suspiciously like an eye roll.
He had to be losing it. Not only would it be utterly suspicious - they were rivals after all and not friends - but it was Draco Malfoy. A mean, spoiled, selfish prat. And he'd probably gone into the forest for something as stupid as proving a point. So Harry finished up his lunch and rushed up to the Gryffindor common room to get a book he'd forgotten to pack. They had DADA with the Slytherins this year; the rumours would either be proven true or put to rest.
Armand turned to Alphard who met him with a look of amusement. “Tell us then,” he said cocking his head to the side, grin wide on his face. “Was the boy met and the tumble had?”
Moaning Myrtle was hovering a few feet away from him with a concerned look on her pale features. It would have irked him had he been sober but he was too inebriated to care. She was a ghost, there was little she could do to stop him. Even if she wanted to.
“Why the bloody hell would he need to be attending the Masque?” Blaise demanded. “Don’t we see enough of that prick in school?”
Sharp canines lacerated his skin, sinking into his neck. He screamed before it happened but it mattered little a few seconds later. A searing flash of pain was the last thing he felt before the darkness took him.
Draco toyed with the idea of waking him, Merlin knew Harry had woken him enough times last night. Once he recognised them for what they were, he’d been sure those silent whispers would be the end of him.
"Whyever not, Gin?" asked Lavender earning a cringe on the fifth year's part at the use of the nickname.
Lupin must have confused his reaction for offence because he started to apologise. Harry shook his head. Their conversation in the Burrow may not have ruined their relationship like Harry feared but his mind had gone back to it more than once since then.
“I have always been eager, godfather. But unlike you, I have accepted that part of myself, made it a weapon. It cannot hurt me anymore.”
Ron's fingers began to shake as he lifted his pumpkin juice and he shook his head. "Everyone else will have had loads more practice, I don't think-"
The uncomfortable feeling was back. He wanted nothing more than to get up and leave but Hermione was watching him like a hawk. Ron seemed to be paying attention to his actions too. So Harry forced himself to sit through supper and nod along to everything they said.
“I have nothing to be envious of,” he said too quickly. He seemed to realise this and took a deep breath. “What I don’t understand is why you invited him.”
Druella took Harry’s right hand and her fingers were warm against his own skin. Her manicured fingernails bore a clear coat of varnish and she wore no jewellery save for a simple wedding band. She brought up her other hand encased Harry’s in both of hers.
“I don’t know how Malfoys do things but we here don’t sort out differences by running away from them. The bond is for life and to be so ungrateful…” He shook his head and Draco sensed something more there but Lupin turned his face away before he could see. “The bond lasts a lifetime so if this is something casual to you… let him go. It will hurt but this is worse.”
Harry kissed him again, every ounce of desire, every last dreg of need was in that kiss. And Draco matched his fervour with missing a beat. They were both already half hard and if neither of them stopped this then they hay beneath their feet would be the only thing to cushion their fall.
Draco returned to sorting his clothes with little regard for their stares. He had nothing to say to them. His plan hadn’t extended so far. All he knew was that he was not in the mood to deal with the alternative.
Had they not been sitting on opposite sides of the table, Draco didn't think Blaise would've been able to resist having a go at him. The blond's forte may have been words but Blaise was just as talented when it came to his fists.
He thought they were past this and it grated on his nerves that every conversation he had with Malfoy boiled down to this no matter what he said or did.
Harry tried to make out Draco’s expression in the darkened room but it was almost impossible. The moonlight wasn’t near enough and the fire was nothing more than softly glowing embers.
Harry dragged a chair before him and sat in it. At first, Draco frowned at the scissors in his hands then his eyes widened.
he wanted to say but that would only encourage Cherry Blossom to speak and their conversation should have ended before it ever began.
He knew where Draco was steering this conversation and didn’t like it. His feelings for Draco had grown since last term, his fight with Ron was evidence of it. His refusal to speak to Hermione but not Draco was further proof.
Harry was ready to utter a spell before he realised that he was late for his meeting with Dumbledore.
"I don't actually," he said in a matter-of-fact tone. He moved to his bed and put his bag down beside it. "But you're in my space."
In hindsight, he supposed that was how his father had felt each time he came home for the holidays and talked about 'Potter this and Potter that'.
There was a loud crack and Harry whimpered, the pain in his shoulder worsening. He cried out when his broom spun out of control and a flash of yellow light blinded his eyes. He knew he was feeling, knew he would hit the ground if he didn’t stop.
Harry knew work here meant spying on Voldemort for Dumbledore. They held differing opinions on that. Harry believed Snape was on Voldemort's side and Draco believed he was on no one’s side but his own.
He wiped down the rest of Harry’s body before tossing the cloth aside. Then he climbed in beside him. Harry watched, straddling the line between consciousness and consciousness.
The brick wall dug into Draco’s back. He felt too hot in his clothing despite the tie Potter had yanked off his neck.
"Are you up for a bet, Draco?" she asked while wrapping her swimming piece in a towel and stuffing it into her emerald green knapsack.
Harry’s breath caught at the response. It was far from what he’d been expecting and more than he knew how to accept here, in front of people he didn’t know. Draco reached for Harry’s hand and Harry let his tepid fingers twine around his.
Despite this, however, it seemed that they would have to endure their classes to the end of the day. McGonagall had promised there would be an announcement at supper and Harry could not keep calm. Twice, professor Sprout asked him if he had suffered a snuffargle bite and she'd been about to send him to the Hospital Wing before seeing the look in his eyes and reconsidering.
"I take it homosexuality is a taboo in the wizarding world?" Harry said not sounding one bit like the mess he felt.
Still, Harry knew he would have to give his answer in time. The question hadn’t been asked but it hung like an unspoken thread between them. Harry wondered if 48 hours with Draco would change anything.
A way to feel in control of his life because those songs were his. His father, The Dark Lord, the world, could not take them from him and taint them.
Draco shifted and settled on his bed arms and legs spread out. Blaise's face appeared in his field of vision a few seconds later. He put his fingers underneath Draco's eyes and examined his pupils.
"Things to do," she read. "Practice quidditch, finish Potions, Defence and Transfigurations essays, ask ____ to next Hogsmeade...Ginny!" cried Lavender for at that moment Ginny Weasley had swiped the parchment out of Lavender's hands.
A chair scraped the ground a few feet away and Harry looked up to see Ginny settle opposite them with an amused expression.
He moved mindlessly against him, groping unseeingly for something. Anything to satisfy the desire that had been woken in him.
He smiled at the memory as he took Harry in his arms. Every shift of his lower body widened that smile and his gaze shifted to Harry. It had been more than he expected in so many good ways. He’d waited for this moment for so long and when Harry finally slid inside him… He’d be half-hard soon if he didn’t stop.
Harry set aside his bag and shrugged off his robes. It had been a rough couple of weeks but he was looking forward to the shift tonight. He’d been looking forward to it since the very first time he saw Draco in the clearing last year.
Tears and droplets of blood rolled down his face and he felt something rise at the back of his throat. Draco tried to heave himself over to the side but his limbs wouldn’t work.
Harry’s fingers were on him, making him look into those green eyes. Draco thought he might have collapsed – thought he might have become an even greater mess than he was – if Harry hadn’t wrapped his arms around him and pulled him close.
It was lighter than he’d expected but he felt too hot in it already. He took another drink of champagne and glanced around. A troupe of dancers was making its way out of a side door in bright clothing and painted skin.
Draco cried out in anguish and hurled his wand at him. His aim was either poor or he hadn’t intended to hit him because it went wide and skidded out of view. Harry didn’t wait to close the distance between them. He collapsed on the ground before Draco and took his face in his hands, fingers gripping hard.
He leaned over the large cauldron, peering into its depths. "Consistent purple colour, medium viscosity, hmmm... I wonder if..."
He couldn’t help his pathetic whimpering as his hand dropped to the ground with a jarring thud. He rolled over on his side and threw up, violently. He hacked everything up past the burning in his throat and his cracked lips.
The grip on his hand had not slackened but Malfoy lay deathly still on the bed. The only sign that he still possessed life was his heavy breathing.
Just like the last time a pair of shiny double doors appeared before him. Instinctively, he checked to see if anyone was following him and when he was satisfied to see that no one was watching him, he stepped in the room pausing only to shut the doors behind him.
The sight of him outside Hogwarts wasn’t familiar enough for Harry not to stare but the Defence professor barely spared him a glance as he motioned for Draco to follow him up the steps to the first floor where the parlour and library were located.
Draco could think of several places Harry would go to cool off or to stew but he could only think of one his friends didn’t know about. He took the stairs to the seventh-floor washroom hoping against hope his guess was correct.
And Harry realised what he’d understood only moments ago. That Harry had been raised in the muggle world. Of course, it had more to do with who he was than the word but it was probably a big indicator.
Harry noticed that the rigidity hadn’t left Draco’s body. Druella reached down to her grandson and brushed a hand across his face. “Your hair’s got a lot longer. Is that the fashion these days?” she asked glancing at Harry.
Harry rolled over in bed, squinting at the sunlight. His hand groped around for Draco but the bed was cold. He raised his head and blinked, trying to make out the room. The sound of footsteps emerging from the shower a moment later had him collapsing against the bed.
“It means you’re my family, my closest friend, my beloved,” he said in a voice low enough to be a whisper.
“I warned you not to threaten him,” Draco said. There was nothing threatening about how he held the wand but the air in the room was dry. “Don’t come any closer if you don’t want a scar to show for it.”
“No displays of affection,” he said pulling out a silver flask from the left flap of his deep brown coat.
went to Potter. He'd probably use it to win a Quidditch match or worse, give it to Weasel. Merlin knew the redhead could use a bit of luck.
Ron looked like he expected Harry to protest. Harry said nothing. All he wanted now was to sleep and forget the world existed.
“Well, Harry,” Dumbledore said leaning forwards. Draco had clearly been abandoned as the object of this conversation for obvious reasons. “It will always be a great day when two enemies reconcile. Putting aside differences often has better results than… fighting it out, as you say these days.”
"Still what, Harry?" asked Hermione in the background but he was already standing up and mumbling excuses to her before he too exited the Great Hall.
"It was a mere misunderstanding. Simply an extra dose of the Draught of Living Death. Now, I beg you all to put this behind you and return to your meal."
He made quick work of his lower body then put the pyjamas on him. He was still muttering then, words that Harry didn't understand. Something about it was synonymous with the events of the match against Slytherin, of their first night together…
She nodded, a small smile curving her lips. "Thanks Blaise. I swear if you tell anyone about this though-"
The two barely conversed as they headed for the one of the back entrances to the Castle and Harry had been compelled to follow them. Why did Malfoy need to be escorted from the Castle at night? By no stretch of his imagination could Harry conceive the thought that Snape had given him detention and even if he had – impossible as it was – he wouldn’t administer the detention himself.
Draco paced outside the hospital wing his hands stuffed in his pockets, his lower lip chewed until was a deep red colour. He hadn't been in the stands when the incident happened but word spread fast with all the portraits in the castle and as much as he wasn't in the right state of mind in the moment all he could hear in his mind was that his mate needed him.
Blaise swung for him but Draco dodged, catching his wrist in his hand and twisting it hard enough to cause him to cry out.
“Hermione. It’s done,” he said. “There’s no going back. If you won’t support me then don’t hinder me.”
Instead Malfoy turned to go. Harry reached out before he could think twice, his hand closed around the Slytherin's wrist and he flinched but Harry didn't draw back.
"Yes. It is nothing unusual, all werewolves feel it. You will not choose who it is, as you can imagine. But your senses will begin to heighten around them and you will feel the urge to be close to them... scowl all you like Mr. Malfoy but it is not something you can resist for long, you may try but it will not bode well for either you or your mate.
Harry turned away but Draco knew he knew the truth. Dobby glanced between them, aware he was missing something but not how or what.
He crawled into bed when the sound of footsteps in the toilet picked up and just managed to see Dean press a kiss to Seamus’s lips before the door swung open and Ron stepped back into the room.
repairing it was the only way to let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. And that was the only way to secure control of the school after he… after Dumbledore…
He realised with some pleasure that he was only another boy at the station now. He wasn’t Harry Potter anymore. No one cared about the scar on his forehead or the destiny he had to fulfil.
Harry let him push his legs apart, let his eyes fall shut and somewhere in the haze of it all, he heard Draco mutter an incantation. Then the sound of a ceramic lid cracking open, he braced himself and the silence seemed to stretch on into eternity.
It was too dark to make out much of his features but Harry knew them enough that his mind filled in the blanks. Draco’s lips brushed his temple, letting Harry know he was awake but exhausted.
Snape looked about to proceed anyway but the sound of the front door drew their attention. Draco took the opportunity to pluck the wand out of Snape’s hands. Snape glared at him but didn’t try to reach for it. A cold fury laced his voice when he spoke.
He reclined, listening for Draco’s footsteps as he moved around the room setting down his bag then taking off his shoes or something like that. He liked to walk down the corridor letting his robes sink to the floor as he did. Harry would have rolled his eyes if the sight didn’t catch his breath every time.
“You can prepare now,” Harry said. “The master bedroom and the adjoining toilet will be good enough but start with the kitchen. Don’t cook anything, just clean it.”
Sensing a trap, he didn’t bother with an answer. He pushed his plate aside and got his feet. Hermione’s footsteps echoed behind him, her breaths coming fast.
“Why?” he demanded. “Why have you got to know everything that happens in my life? Can’t I have private affairs?”
“I’ve asked you where two people are, one of them your friend, and suddenly you’re defensive? How do you think that looks?”
Harry moved closer inhaling the scent of Draco, trying not to look like he was scenting him but knowing he was failing at it. Draco smiled and run his fingers over Harry’s chin in a way that made him want to get Draco underneath him.
The night air was cool against his skin as he stepped out onto the back porch. He’d never gone further down the abandoned stairwell than the washrooms. The East Wing was cold and deserted, made him shiver and curse and yet every time his mind went back to that washroom, to the first night he’d slept in the same bed as Draco…
“He said he would wring your neck if you’d been exaggerating the recovery bit. Telling him about the potions would have been stupid.”
Draco would kill them. The latter was tricky enough to deal with but tampering with someone’s mind… the very act was enough to turn his stomach.
He nodded mutely wanting nothing more than to keep her close but this time she was the one who pulled away from him. And he was forced to watch as she took his father's arm and left. He swallowed back tears. That was it, that was as polite a rejection as he would get from his father and it hurt, more than he wanted to feel.
They had let the first one go. He knew they wouldn't let this one go as well. But it could be from anyone.
Harry didn’t know what spell he used but it was obvious how much energy it was taking. He angled his body towards the nearest pile of odd items and lifted his wand. Beside it was a pile of books and another of furniture. If he was fast enough then he might be able to topple all three though not at once.
was on him before Warrington could so much as move. He tried to get him on the ground again, ignoring Blaise’s command to stop. Draco felt a rush of exhilaration as he kneed Crabbe in the chest and clambered atop him.
Ron regarded her disdainfully. "Really? They seemed rather pleasant when we stopped by..." and just like that Harry found himself falling into the rhythm of being back at Hogwarts, glad to be somewhere he could call home once more.
“If one has a grievance with someone else, it is always best to settle it personally. I'll go first,” he said. “You will be expected in my office tonight and tomorrow night to write lines.”
It wasn’t shocking to him that Malfoy could perform wandless magic but rather the degree to which he could. Even Hermione would have had trouble with such a complex spell.
Cherry red hair and an intent gaze. Harry’s eyes widened even more when he spoke in that self-confident but guarded way that he seemed to have about him.
Harry knew that but he still very much awake and he knew forcing himself to sleep would only make his nightmares more vivid. Draco crowded into him until his scent was everywhere and only a few inches remained between them.
He’d been saying something. They both knew it. But Harry wasn’t sure he wanted to unravel the true meaning of his words yet. He’d rather hoped Malfoy would do that on his own but it appeared he wouldn’t be so lucky.
Draco's head turned and there was a flash of white before Blaise withdrew his hand with half a yell. "Did you just bite me?" he demanded nursing his throbbing index finger. "What the hell-?"
Gooseflesh sprouted on his arms and he cursed his slow reflexes. The magic in this room didn’t just prevent his wounds from healing but also dulled his reflexes.
He picked the card to his left – on Ron's right – and turned it over. "For the past you've got the fool," he said as Ron began to scribble something down on his parchment. He looked up the entry. "Which translates to madness or bewilderment." He looked up.
Something woke him sometime later. The sun was barely in the sky and it was getting too dark to see anything. He threw his hand about before him but there was only hair. He forced himself to breathe but his eye caught on something and he pitched forward despite himself.
Harry wanted nothing more than to continue but he knew Draco was right. He wasn’t going to take things further in the back of his father’s car. It was too unnerving for him. He pulled his thigh away even as Draco attempted to derive more friction from it.
Draco did not know how long he was in the sixth-floor washrooms. All he knew that was the he had last been seen in the Slytherin dungeons when he rushed in to grab a few vials of Firewhiskey before returning to the washrooms. He had only been lucid long enough to put the finishing touches on the batch of Draught of Peace. Everything after downing the equivalent of two pints of the last batch accompanied by three pints of Firewhiskey was a blur.
He gestured to Potter who had been sitting quietly in the chair beside his. "Does he need to be here?"
Pansy noticed him in an instant but turned back to her back. By the time Draco stood before her, she had set it aside and packed the rest of her stationery. He tried not to let the implication of her actions sting.
Yet even with all the events currently at play, Draco remained aware of the other matters he had to deal with. He’d allowed himself so much time with Harry that the thought of only seeing him at the start and end of the day seemed alien.
Draco shook his head even though the words Blaise had spoken still burned in his mind. “I don’t know.”
Harry looked at him as though there was nothing to explain. Draco waited all the same. Harry was talking and maybe if he went on talking, he could hold it together until after tea.
They both knew and Harry wanted to leave, to go away, to hide from all this but he wanted to kiss Draco too. He wanted to touch him and taste him and breathe him in…
His breathing was growing more and more shallow and Harry thought he saw a dark stain when he lifted his right arm.
The sound of vices erupted behind them. Harry turned to look but Haneul grasped his sleeve ad pulled him along as he took off down the narrow passage to the side.
Draco stood at the command. Somewhere along the line Stone had forgotten who he was, some line of formality had been crossed. He would set it right. "
Armand Malfoy Jr was the black sheep of the Malfoy family. There was no other way to describe and what and who he was to them in fewer words. He came and went as he pleased, did as he pleased and wore what he pleased. Abraxas Malfoy did not chastise him as much as he did Draco though if there was a measure for his actions, he was yet to see it.
In truth, he wanted a better vantage point from which to look for the snitch. Gryffindor may be in the lead with fifty points to Ravenclaw’s thirty but it wouldn’t last long. Both sides were eager for a win.
But it was almost impossible between varied schedules and the burden of schoolwork. He got no more than a glimpse of Draco in the corridors or the Great Hall and Hermione and Ron stuck close to him when they could all day.
Hermione who had parchment on her laps, a revision schedule of sorts for the upcoming exams, grinned as she gazed at the ceiling.
Harry’s breath shuddered at the contact. He pulled Malfoy closer. He felt hot. Too hot. Malfoy’s cool touch on his skin was the only thing that would soothe the flare of need his body was succumbing to.
In one corner, Ron sat opposite Seamus and Dean playing a game of exploding snap. The boys were in their pyjamas and every now and then cheers of triumph or grunts of frustration would be heard from them. Harry of course, sat with them but it was no secret that he was rubbish at Exploding Snap. Wizard's Chess as well. In fact, the only wizard's game Harry was good at was Quidditch. He too was dressed in his pyjamas, royal blue flannel pants and a grey sweatshirt. He was staring down at a copy of
Draco reached up to straighten his clothing and found Harry watching him. They still stood only a few inches from each other. All he had to do was… He leaned forwards and brushed his nose against Draco’s.
Harry could steel feel the heat between them and his embarrassment only fanned the flames of his desire.
Draco’s hand squeezed even harder than before. A warning. Harry couldn’t help a wince. Lucius Malfoy watched him with a cool expression.
When long minutes passed and the people who had left started to return, Harry began to get odd looks. He knew he’d been here long enough.
Draco kept his voice low, almost a whisper. Harry looked up from where he sat cross-legged on the floor. He could no longer feel the cold seeping in through his trousers which meant he would have trouble standing up. Draco sunk down beside him, mirroring his position. He smelled like leaves and grass and something Harry couldn’t identify.
Draco didn’t argue. Instead, he pulled off his trousers and his pullover leaving him in a light vest. Then he tucked him into bed and told him not to go anywhere, he would be right back.
It was already fifteen minutes to ten and he was sure the party was well underway by now. He'd made the last-minute decision to actually attend the Slytherin Halloween Party against his better judgement. But he was having second thoughts now that he realised he had nothing appropriate to wear. His trunk was filled with baggy denim trousers and oversized jumpers.
He was met with a very pointed stare. There were dark circles underneath his eyes which were red and puffy. He rubbed at them.
Harry splashed water at him in response and Draco responded with equal fervour but there was nowhere to go, the bath wasn’t
Malfoy's silver irises glowed in the light and Harry couldn't bring himself to look away. His pupils were dilated and he seemed slightly... out of it. But there was nothing Harry could do about it now.
"He will remain here because I trust Snape to guide him, otherwise I would have removed him from this school at once." He turned to look at Draco only once before he rose. "If you will excuse me, I have meeting with the Minister of Magic in a few minutes. Narcissa."
But it was too late. Harry took it in his and gently pried his fist apart. Stretching his knuckles did hurt and Harry watched the raw skin with an almost practised gaze. Draco doubted he knew what he was looking for but he was convincing.
Nothing happened for a moment and Harry was about to rip his shirt and bandage the wound until he could figure something out but then Draco’s skin began to knit together painfully slow. The process was almost harrowing to watch but neither of them looked away.
. That was what he had been thinking of. If he needed to find a place to hide something would the room transform into something else? If he needed to find a place to hide something such that it would be difficult to find? Could it do that or did it always look like the Malfoy Manor parlour? It was a theory he would have to test.
The result was that they were both thrown back a distance of six feet. Harry rolled to his feet and tried to ignore the pain in his arms and legs.
"No," he said because he didn't want them to go, he needed the company or he would sink into his thoughts like they were devil snare. "I'm fine."
A part of him suspected that he had always wanted it deep down. Yet for all his fervour, he knew enough not to rush things. He knew what that would get him.
Hadn’t no one cared to spread those ‘rumours’? When the Ravenclaw boy woke up, Draco would apologise for everything and thank him for…
He’d never bothered to find out afterwards who had actually invited him. That wasn’t a lie. He’d been simmering in both rage and desire then and everything else had engulfed him not long after.
Harry was tempted to reach for Draco just to irritate him but Zabini spoke up again when he realised his flask was nearly empty.
“Nothing you do is petty,” Draco said well aware that the Dark Lord would not hold Snape in such high esteem if his mind wasn’t extremely keen. “But no, I’m not here for that today.”
The air left his lungs as his back connected with the wall. Draco cursed as his knees wobbled. Goyle used his backward momentum to slam into him again and Draco, crushed between his body and the wall, was forced to release his wrist.
Malfoy licked his finger then his lips, looking at Harry the entire time. He had to bite down on his shoulder to muffle his groan as he came all over the tiled floor.
Draco blinked to keep back the tears that stung his eyes, begging for release. He had thought it would be enough, having the task The Dark Lord assigned to him hovering in his mind daily. He thought it would be enough to try and hate the headmaster so that it would be easier to do what he had to do. But the man had the nerve to try and console him, to be understanding after he had been turned into the very thing his parents reviled.
Blaise still watched him carefully but Draco could care less, he didn't have an iota of proof. And he should have known better than to use Draco's own glare on him in an attempt to squeeze something out of him. Pansy unwrapped her arms from his body and he seemed to recall having told her he didn't like hugs but he knew she was doing the only thing she thought would comfort him.
Harry thought he caught a glint of wetness on his cheek but said nothing. He followed in silence, grasping Lupin’s arm like he had Dumbledore’s a few months ago.
Draco pretended to think about it for the third time. He ran the tip of the quill under his chin and tapped the table with his fingernails.
“Mother hates her. We’re not allowed to say her name. Or Alphard’s. Edward is on his way there too.”
From the looks of it his friends – especially Parkinson whose dark hair was strewn over her shoulders, her expression indicating she was out for blood – were not pleased at the fact.
Her voice grated against Harry’s eardrums and the scent of disinfectant clung too much to the air around her. Harry rubbed his temples.
A few people glanced at him but he paid them little mind. His abrupt exit from the Great Hall days ago was still part of the hot topics it seemed. The rumours had been fairly docile before he stepped but it always paid to fuel rumours by yourself.
Coupled with his refusal to contest the Gryffindor win... He should have let Madam Hooch examine the damned snitch and figure it out herself. Where was the front he always put up when it mattered?
Harry’s fists clenched at his sides. There were no words to describe how much despised it when Malfoy called him names. He made it sound like Harry was some sort of tyrant or vain prick.
There was a harrumph from a nearby portrait and the face of a large familiar looking man came into view. "Needs to be taught some manners that one, if you ask me," the man muttered.
Harry laughed and ran a hand through his hair, cheeks tinged pink. “I didn’t mean to make it do this. I wasn’t really thinking.”
Draco set his Arithmancy textbook on his bed and moved to Nott’s bed. He had been trying to listen in on the conversation. That much was obvious. All to the detriment of his pressed shirts which lay in disarray in his travelling case.
He cleaned his wand on a square of toilet paper and took out the three dozen vials he stored in the medicine cabinet. He muttered a spell and the cauldron began to empty while the vials began to fill one by one with the deep red liquid.
Then, slowly, as if he was in no hurry, Malfoy began to undress. His long pale fingers tugged at the silver and green tie at his neck, tossing it to the ground once it was loose. He went to work on the buttons next, his eyes still shut, his body swaying to a rhythm Harry wished he could hear.
“Most people suspect me and Seamus. We don’t hide it well but we shouldn’t have to hide it in the first place. But you and him are different.”
Draco laughed along with them though it was obvious he wanted to get down. Then his gaze met Harry’s and something triumphant came over his expression. Harry felt it coil inside him, felt the rush of Draco’s victory as though it was his own. His lips moved and Harry wished he could move closer to hear. He almost did but someone announced that there would be drinks in the Slytherin common room and cheers rose in the air.
Harry agreed to leave only because he couldn’t sit in the toilet moping any longer. Someone would find him eventually, he couldn’t skip classes and get away with it like most people. He cursed his way down the steps to the Charms classroom. He was ten minutes early but there was nothing to be done about it.
But Harry didn’t know those people, not the way he wanted to. He didn’t know what they would have said to him if they’d lived to see him as he was now.
“But this is about you,” Lupin said slipping the lighter back into his pocket. “What did Draco mean about recovery?”
Draco’s hand slipped into his and Harry was reminded of the moment on the street, the silence all around them. He leaned in before he knew what he was doing and Draco’s lips were warm and pliable beneath his. He stepped Harry back against the wall and their arms tangled in their haste to touch and taste and feel.
Draco scanned the ground for his wand as Blaise crossed the distance between them, heedless of the wheezing and groaning on his path.
“Death.” His breathing was steadier this time. The words were like a rhythm to him, he could never explain the comfort of knowledge to anyone else. Knowing these concepts, knowing they made sense whatever way he applied them was familiar to him. He needed familiarity. “There must always be an anchor. Our magic grounds itself in us and we in turn ground ourselves in…”
He had stopped moving but only because they were now a mere foot apart. Amy further than that and it
“How many times have you snick out of the common room?” she demanded. “How many times have we promised to go to our common room but gone elsewhere instead?”
The incantation he used was some sort of complicated spell for which he barely moved his lips. Harry slipped it between the pages of his notebook.
Harry shifted and winced at the pain his neck. He stretched a little but immediately hunched over his crossed legs so Draco had only a meagre view of his face.
“I want to love them, I really do. But how can I do that when all there’s left to love is memories?”
He didn’t seem aware — no, bothered — by how close they stood. Harry could almost feel the heat of his body on his skin and his scent was everywhere, it was driving him mad. He reached for the champagne at the centre of the table and drained the glass before he could think better of it.
He chewed his lip and glanced around. There would be teachers patrolling the corridors soon and though he didn’t plan on being discovered, if it did happen he’d rather knowing he’d done all he could.
Criss-crossing lines of red, flashes of white muscle beneath them and blood… so much blood on Draco’s arm, on his own palms… He shouldn’t… Draco shouldn’t be conscious, merlin, this should hurt and yet…
He thought Draco would be too far gone to hear him but a breath left his lips in what Harry thought was a chuckle.
But it was a double-edged sword – one Draco possibly didn’t realise he was dealing him. If Harry said no then he’d have to suffer whatever punishment Narcissa would exact on him for refusing her in her own house.
That would go away soon enough, she told him but it would be a week before he could return to quidditch practice. She gave him a pain tonic and told him he could leave any time in the afternoon.
. He tossed his wand aside and slit open the most important letter. His eyes skimmed over it fast searching for the usual trigger words.
There was nowhere else to sleep in the room, no sofa or chaise, only the window seat. He knew what it would mean for his back if took that road.
It struck him then how ironic it was that so many people had found solace in the cold draughty walls of this tower.
Harry kept up but the panic was robbing him of breath. He couldn't explain why he felt that way but he knew deep inside that something was wrong. Haneul knew him but he didn't know him well enough to know what mattered to him, the people he cared about. Why would he be taking Harry there?
Draco didn’t speak about them much but then neither did Harry about Hermione and Ron. It was something unspoken between them, leaving it all behind even though it would catch up to them in the end.
Harry’s head lolled to the side and his body slackened, fully in the grip of the fever. He tried to tell Lupin not to hurt him but the words sounded garbled even to his ears.
Harry shot Hermione a look, she shook her head in disapproval but Ron's frazzled state was beginning to make him panicky too. "Here." He pulled a vial of golden liquid from his pocket. Ron's eyes widened.
