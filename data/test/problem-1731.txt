“Yeah, I get off on guilt,” said Harry, but he looked nervous. Pansy helped Draco unbutton his shirt. The gauze underneath was stained with blood.
“Okay,” said Harry. Draco’s mother started to scream. Draco put his hands over his ears and shut his eyes.
“So, my beauty was sacrificed on the altar of my cruelty,” he said, with a grandiose gesture at his face. “Penance for a life ill-lived. And
“Malaria kills a lot of people, though,” said Draco. “And I haven’t got a family, so better me than—”
Draco’s face contorted into an expression Harry recognised from Hogwarts. Back then, it had usually preceded him calling Hermione a mudblood. It was bizarre how knowing Draco as an adult cast new light on his behaviour as a child. Harry couldn’t help but see, now, how it was fear that twisted Draco’s features like that; fear and self-hatred.
Blaise raised his eyebrows, but didn’t say more. Neither did Draco, the next day, when Harry didn’t give him anything, although Harry could tell that he was waiting, watching to see what he would do.
“Are you really counting our anniversary from our first drunken shag?” he asked, so that he wouldn’t say all the other things, things like
The next, and final, time that Draco had interacted with aurors had been a month after his parole ended. St Mungo’s called them when Draco turned up at the hospital holding a severely injured Narcissa Malfoy. The staff at St Mungo’s suspected that Draco was responsible for beating his mother—after all, he was a Death Eater—and informed the authorities. Narcissa Malfoy did not press charges.
“You’re bleeding,” she said, her hands cradling his head, feeling for the wound. Draco had his eyes closed, and he was frighteningly pale, but he
Harry stared at the letter. He put it down on his dining room table, reheated a frozen curry he had made the week before, ate the curry while listening to a radio program about bat sonar, and then looked at the letter again.
Malfoy only shook his head. He had one trembling, long-fingered hand held to his chest. Harry wouldn’t pity him, he
- it came from the Latin for “Always Cut”. A cut that would last forever. He remembered how dazed Draco had looked as he bled to death. How fragile.
And after, after they had rolled apart, they showered together, although they could easily have used magic. They were playful, splashing each other, breaking out into sudden and stupid wrestling that quickly devolved into kissing.
Harry nodded and let Ron apparate him back to his terrible, loveless flat. He stood still, dripping water onto the ugly brown carpet that had come with his living room as Ron fetched a towel. He said nothing when Ron rubbed his head vigorously with the towel and then wrapped it around his shoulders, using the pretence of drying Harry to give him a long, tight hug.
Suddenly, Harry could understand why Draco had lied all those years. He couldn’t fathom telling Cassie how things had been between him and Draco in eighth year. He still flinched away from the thought, when it came upon him at night. He had been so cruel— callous, as Draco said.
“Hi,” said Draco, coming to join him. Dinsmore looked as if he had just realised he was the villain in someone else’s story and didn’t like it one bit.
“You might not really have an ice rink,” said Malfoy. “It’s just getting to know you. Once it figures out what you like, it’ll redistribute its resources.”
The voice continued to talk Draco through his breaths. It was a rough voice, scratchy. When Draco was sure he could speak, he opened his eyes. A homeless man was watching him with evident sympathy.
“Yes,” said Draco, his eyes flashing. “It’s so convenient, loving someone who loathes me and everything I stand for.”
He went to the bathroom before going to Potter’s and stared at himself in the mirror. He looked like shit. He cast glamours on the bags under his eyes, on his twisted hand, but he was too tired to do them well, and it all looked weird, as if he were wearing cakey makeup and a flesh-coloured glove. He took the glamours off. He tried to fix his hair. It was no doing. Potter would open the door looking effortlessly hot in that
don’t,” said Draco. He stopped pacing to watch the nightmare she had become. This was a weariness he recognised. It was what he had felt in sixth year, when he realised that he had picked the wrong side, and that he still had to live out the rest of his miserable, squandered little life.
But everyone wanted to talk to Draco, to catch up—it was so rare that any of them went away. Harry waited his turn. He didn’t have a special right, which hurt a little, but it was okay. There were lots of people to talk to; it wasn’t like Harry was alone.
Harry wondered what the change was. He suspected it was that Draco knew Harry wouldn’t have brought them if they were going to be dicks.
“I’ve got an idea,” said Harry. “But we’ll have to wait till night, because it involves breaking into the Department of Mysteries.”
It became more and more obvious with each passing moment that Harry was ignoring something crucial, something undeniable.
And they did. Several times, people poked their heads in to his compartment, saw him, and retreated. Draco did not look at them. He kept his face impassive.
“How that boy doesn’t know he’s in love with you is beyond me,” said Hermione, the next day, at lunch.
Luna’s next event was a fashion show. As always, Lamorak floated effortlessly through the crowd, introducing models to fashion designers, designers to politicians, politicians to activists. Although, it wasn’t quite effortless, noticed Harry. Every twenty minutes or so, Lamorak retreated to an alcove, leant against the wall looking exhausted, and took a swig from a hip flask.
“Yes. A horribly embarrassing one,” said Draco, lowering his hand. “Will you sleep in the same room as me? I know it’s not, you know,
“No idea. Must be young, he’s still a trainee.” Robards whistled. “Wouldn’t have fancied that gig, I’ll tell you that for free. This is good news, coming just after that Knutter murder you reported yesterday, Harry.”
After the war, the boundaries between friendship groups had grown blurry. Ron had confessed to a crush on Pansy Parkinson and started up a strange and unexpected friendship with Blaise Zabini. Ginny briefly dated Theo Nott. Harry started playing friendly games of quidditch with Marcus Flint. Neville fell in love with Malfoy. It was all very weird, but in a nice way. Harry liked it. They all liked it.
Blaise Zabini opened the door almost immediately. When Harry first moved into his new flat, the fact that Blaise Zabini lived across the hall had been disorienting, horrible, and wholly unfair. Harry suspected the real estate agent had
“I did most of it for you while you were raging about all the potentially bigoted things you might accidentally say and do,” said Draco.
Harry expected to feel more tense at the news. More protective. That was one of the symptoms, he had read, but he hadn’t noticed it yet. He barely thought about any of the people he had had sex with, and there were a lot of them, post-LA.
“Yeah, I know that. I do,” he said. He glanced at Draco. “It’s just frustrating. It’s hard knowing how easy everything would be for me, if I had just been born a little earlier or later.”
It gave Harry an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of his stomach. All of it— Malfoy not being comfortable in his body, Malfoy’s body, Malfoy lounging nakedly while half of Wizarding London painted him and probably wanked over the memories later.
“Logical,” said Mirth.They were both smiling, but Draco felt abruptly hopeless. The reality of his position came back to him.
“I’ve changed,” said Draco. Tears were building up in a painful dam behind his eyes. “I’m—the Ship of Theseus.”
“See if you can keep both options open until Easter. That should give me enough time,” she said, gathering her things and getting to her feet.
“I just want to know how you did it,” said Harry. “I want to know how you’ve become all… confident and… I just…”
The song I imagine Draco hearing in church is Eric Whitacre's Lux Aurumque https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j2JRcC6wBs
“I honestly eat everything,” said Harry. They sat at the table, spreading the greasy paper and doling out vinegary chips without speaking. Draco was smiling too much. It looked uncomfortable.
“I’m going to check on Ron and Hermione,” said Harry decisively, and left the room. Not before hearing Malfoy sigh contentedly into Dean’s mouth, however, or Dean saying “your lips are so soft…”
“Teeth. I didn’t think it was that noticeable,” he said. “I couldn’t make the charm work properly, I kept growing fangs.”
“Once I’m dead, Lovegood reveals that I spent my final months slaving away for the cause of righteousness. ‘That brave young man!’ say the papers. ‘No one knew how reformed and selfless he was! Quick, send Narcissa Malfoy flowers and accolades and invitations to all the finest parties.’”
handsome when you’re angry, Harry. No! Don’t go. The Reconciliation Act is Granger’s pet project. She thinks measures need to be taken to reduce discord among war survivors. Crack down on Death Eater Catchers, ban war-based workplace discrimination, that sort of thing.”
“I can’t say more. And it’s not like he’s told me anything explicitly. But I don’t want to betray his trust.”
“Are you kidding? You learnt that Shield Carm faster than most new Aurors. You’re very good at this.”
Malfoy leant forward. His eyes shone with excitement. Harry hadn’t ever seen him look like that, elated, with no malice. It made Malfoy look vulnerable, although he could tell Malfoy didn’t  realise that.
Astoria rose from the bed and came to stand beside him in front of the mirror. Mirth watched her, eagle-eyed. Mirth, Draco had noticed, didn’t like to take her eyes off Astoria, if she could help it.
“Cassie. You cannot drug people. You cannot break into the ministry of magic. You cannot steal my invisibility cloak.”
“Don’t do this,” he said, and left. By the time Harry returned to the sitting room, Malfoy had conquered Australia.
Unfortunately, the NHS was also chronically underfunded. Adelaide’s GP put her on a waiting list for an out-patient rehab facility, and gave her a printed hand-out about the value of exercise.
Blaise frowned. Harry had the sense that he’d hurt his feelings, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
“He can’t walk in a straight line. He’s hungover every single day. He keeps a hip flask in his suit pocket, I saw the outline when he took off his jacket.”
Draco looked better than he had in ages. He walked around the pale pink buildings carved into stone with bright eyes, tugging frequently at Harry’s sleeve to give him snippets of information.
“I promise you that Ron doesn’t want to watch me rut against your leg,” said Harry. “I’ll ask him if you like, but the answer is going to be no. Hermione might be more willing, if that’s really what you’re into.”
She and Ron smiled at each other in a way that made Draco’s chest throb with loneliness. He looked away, only to see that Harry had been hungrily watching them, too.
There was no response. The kitten followed him around the house as Harry got up and had breakfast. Once Harry had put the dishes away, he picked the kitten up and cuddled him close to his chest.
“People are always telling me I have my mother’s eyes,” he said. “So that’s part of it. Also I just look quite good in green.”
When Harry arrived at Andromeda’s that evening, Malfoy was sulking in an armchair, clearly nursing a hangover.
It was sweet. It felt nice, even though it didn’t mean much, because Will had no conception of what Harry needed, of how little he had ever been cared for, and how much he seemed to need to make up for that initial lack.
when Harry touched him in anger. Harry knew quite well that in school, before he had been bitten, Malfoy would have fought back. He hadn’t ever scared Malfoy, at school—even after Sectumsempra, Malfoy had regarded him only with loathing, never fear. It was very clear what had changed: Harry. Newly bitten, newly dangerous.
Did the Malfoys use muggle health care? Clearly they did. Scorpius pulled out a mobile phone and dialled. It didn’t work, of course. There was too much magic in the house.
“I know,” said Harry. “I’m sorry, I’ve done everything wrong. I shouldn’t have gone to Connemara, I should have gone to you. I just thought… I don’t know what I thought. That I’d get my memories back, and know how to fix things.” He pulled away from Draco and looked him in the face. “Is it too late for me to fix things?”
“Order me to cut it off, if it bothers you,” he said, in an attempt to remind Harry of his position, of why they were sitting together in the first place, of the tattoo on Draco’s arm.
They didn’t only hang out one-on-one, although they did that a lot. Draco had a habit of showing up at Grimmauld Place, wearing eyeliner and his black jacket with all the zippers, and forcing Harry to come out.
Draco do anything, but spell damage was serious. And what if it was from the bond? It was relatively new magic. He decided that if he couldn’t talk Draco into going of his own accord in the next week, he would order him to.
Ginny said the same thing, two weeks later, when Harry started complaining about how pathetic it was for Draco to go out with someone who clearly didn’t get him.
“I have to say my piece. I don’t want Harry to wake up tomorrow morning, filled with regret because he’s chained to a worthless war criminal—”
“It’s not going to help Malfoy if the auror in charge of finding him is running around like a headless chicken.”
“In fairness, he always did that,” said Draco, putting the perfume down and examining a jewelled comb.
Harry and Malfoy started sleeping together in the last term of eighth year. It was kind of a hate thing. Harry was pretty fucked up that year: he had nightmares all night, he was struck by random bouts of uncontrollable rage, he couldn’t focus, he couldn’t
“You’ve barely spent any time with him,” pointed out Hermione. Which was true, technically. But Harry had watched Draco with Teddy. He had seen how Draco responded to heartbreak; how good he was at his job, how many friends he had made and kept among his former enemies. And then there was something else, something Harry hesitated to call memory because it felt so much like instinct, that inexorable desire to know what Draco was up to that had been a part of Harry for as long as he could remember. Did he love Draco because he had been fascinated by him all his life? Or because some hidden part of him remembered falling in love with him last time? Or because he had fallen for him afresh through witnessing his poise in the face of adversity? Or some combination of the three?
They had decided to rent out an old palace ballroom in Westminster for the engagement party. It was all Draco and Clarence had talked about for weeks, which actually worked pretty well for them. Clarence was excellent at planning, and he had perfect taste. Draco never loved him more than when they were discussing logistics.
“Loosen up,” he shouted at Harry, and they each took three. Malfoy leant forward, and for a crazed second Harry thought he was going to kiss him. But he was only leaning into Harry’s ear. “Happy hunting,” he said, and disappeared into the crowd.
“That’s because she’s related to us,” said Harry. “Neither of us were ever going to stay out of the thick of it.”
,” he said. “Christ, put on some clothes, Goyle, I can’t handle feeling insecure this early in the morning.”
“Right,” said Draco. “Well. Point is, I’m an embarrassment but the sex is good so I guess this is where we are, now. If Adelaide were sleeping with someone who loathed her I would…” he stopped.
Potter looked as if he didn’t know what to make of that. His gaze dropped to Draco’s mangled right hand. He reached out slowly and pinched Draco’s wrist, lifted Draco’s arm, and Draco let him. Potter drew Draco’s hand up so that it was framed against the light, warped fingers jutting out at odd angles.
It was harder for them to be friendly, after that. Draco was as pleasant as possible whenever he could be without breaking one of Steven’s rules—which increased daily. There were many subjects which, if they came up in conversation with Harry, Draco had to respond to with hostility.
And so Harry explained. He had not anticipated that the answer would be so lengthy. But Malfoy didn’t seem to mind— in fact, whenever Harry thought he must surely have bored him to tears, he would ask another question.
Draco closed his eyes. He could feel his face twisting into a sneer, even though he didn’t want it to.
“Come sit,” said Potter. Draco had to obey. It wasn’t just that he would be punished if he didn’t— it was that he was compelled to do whatever Potter commanded, with all the force of an Imperius curse. He was sure they had used aspects of that in crafting the prisoner’s bond.
“Oh,” said Draco blankly. Somehow this hadn’t occurred to him, despite the handcuffs. “But I didn’t do anything.”
He was a rangy, muscly kind of guy, with a patchy beard and what he probably thought of as tasteful face tattoos. He frowned as he looked from Adelaide to Harry and Draco.
“It hurts to talk,” said Draco. “This is the perfect opportunity for your egotism to have free reign.”
She made some incomprehensible sound and got a bottle of white wine out of the cold cupboard. Then she paused, both hands on the bottle’s neck.
“I’d think you were on Polyjuice if you weren’t drinking that so often,” said Harry, catching him as he emerged from the alcove. Lamorak startled.
Still, he wanted to keep watch over Draco, and Draco was not above making it easy for him. Even though it was weird, definitely weird, to spend so much time in bed with him. But Draco couldn’t think about that.
In the month after his trial, when he was still reeling from the fact that it was all over and he was really free, Draco had made a list of all the things he hated about himself.
On Monday morning, they woke up with hideous hangovers, as they had every morning that week, but instead of downing mimosas, Draco made them a full English.
could be lovely, then everything was a lot more complicated and variable than I had thought. And it’s harder to hate people when you know how complicated they are.”
It had been several weeks since Draco had visited Goyle. Alarmed by how tempting it was to think of Harry as a friend, Draco had pulled away. Harry, responsive as ever, reacted by becoming distant. Draco still climbed into bed with him when he was woken up by an explosion, but they did not touch again, or talk.
“—twat,” Harry said. Draco’s head lolled back against the bed post. “I wasn’t going to mention the war.”
“I… maybe. I don’t think so,” he said, because nothing about Malfoy was simple, and yet Harry wanted him more than anything.
“They almost killed him last spring. His son is scared to go to Hogwarts, in case Malfoy’s murdered while he’s gone!”
“Draco’s secret!” he said triumphantly. “He used a resilience potion on them. He brewed some for me. We just need to put this on the soil once a month.”
Harry handed him the tray of frozen fruit juice he had made the night before. Draco ate one tentatively, like a small animal in the wild.
“You,” said Harry, and Draco’s eyes flitted to his, dark and unreadable. “Or, you know, if that’s not what you want,” Harry hastened to add, “then just… for things to be less hard for you.”
Only he had thought, when that underling had told him Harry had been found, that he would have a little longer.
The dinner with Draco, Ron and Hermione was exactly as awkward as Harry had thought it would be. Draco showed up at Grimmauld Place with two bouquets of flowers and two bottles of wine.
As the memories skipped forward, Harry remembered the cautious, delicate way Draco had questioned him about Cedric that night. He hadn’t
“That explains why my guard was so disagreeable this morning. No, not much has changed in that regard.”
“Morning,” said Draco. He looked rather uncertain. Harry smiled at him, and the uncertainty melted away. Draco smiled back.
Harry was a little dizzy, from the drinks, maybe, or from Draco. From the way Draco was looking at him.
“Why would you do any of this?” asked Harry, but he wasn’t talking to Draco anymore. “It doesn’t benefit you. It’s not like you come off well in that article.”
“I love you,” said Draco, seriously, and somehow it did feel like the first time. Draco’s eyes were solemn, truthful.
Cassie nodded. She and Harry started making their way to the floo, skirting round the shadows of the atrium, when suddenly she broke free of his grasp and darted back to the alcove where they had left Draco. Draco shed the invisibility cloak and swept her into an all-encompassing hug, kissing the top of her head over and over.
“It helps her relax,” said Draco, as they lay bed together. (That was another thing Harry did not question: Draco in his bed.)
“I don’t fancy him! I just, you know, appreciate his… look. It’s, er, aesthetic.” Something cleared in his head, and he turned to look at at Hermione more seriously. “Also, he’s changed. I think he feels really guilty about everything and it’s making him into a better person.”
“You know the funny thing about doing evil, Steven? It fucks you up for good. You might not feel it yet, but you will.”
Harry started to argue, and then gave up. He knew Ron was right. Ron was paid a decent wage as an auror, which had lessened the financial tension between them, but he couldn’t deny that Ron knew what he was talking about when it came to economic disparity within friendships.
Harry thought of Draco anxiously pacing the corridor as he tried to think what to say. If Hermione’s theory was right, then Draco—Malfoy—had been trying to figure out what would most convince Harry to like him.
, although he often disappeared into his room for hours at a time. Harry knew he still talked to his mother up there. It was depressing.
of vicious criminals! To think, I might have killed him, and how much untold tragedy might then have unfolded! My face was small price to pay.”
“Well, good job,” said Harry. Malfoy blinked, then said, “thank you,” as if he resented having to say it. He was hovering by the door.
Which made him laugh, so he stopped crying, and reminded himself that in some ways the situation was rather poetic. He’d always wanted to be an orphan, as a child. Orphans were much more interesting.
Andromeda had seven different types of pasta, arranged in jars along a shelf. Draco wondered how long Potter would stay. Draco couldn’t disapparate from within the house because of the wards.
“Family trait,” said Draco. She dipped her head so it rested on his shoulder, and they stood a little longer like that, watching themselves.
“It feels as if you have been investing more time in your personal relationships, lately,” said Kevin.
It probably was a hallucination, Draco decided. There weren’t many Dementors around anymore, but their magic clung to walls, and Draco was quite often woken up by Nagini, slithering into his bed and tenderly wrapping her strong body around his throat, stopping his breath.
“You know perfectly well it’s not all on me,” said Neville. “Things were terrible long before your birthday. You never want to have sex—”
Draco’s act was different, less ethereal, but equally lovely. He wore a crown made of tear drop crystals and a ballgown made of a special paper that disintegrated when water touched it. At first, Draco cried — although Harry could tell that he had used a charm to draw the tears out, because he had seen Draco cry before, and it was a much more heaving affair. Then, he thrust his hands into a bucket of water and ran them all over himself as he danced, until the dress and everything beneath it had been eroded away, leaving him only in some sort of diamante underwear. The lights dimmed, and Lucius clapped louder than anyone.
“Yes,” said Draco. Harry dragged his thumb over the corner of Draco’s mouth, and Draco moved his head a fraction, caught Harry’s thumb with his lips.
“First Vince, and now him,” said Goyle, his voice wobbling. “It was always the three of us, growing up.”
“I swear I didn’t. I would never have let her go,” said Harry. He kept thinking of Cassie’s eyes. He thought he was the only person living with his mother’s eyes. He thought he was the last of his family. And after he’d realised he was gay, he’d accepted the fact that he wouldn’t have kids. “Her middle name is Lily,” he said, realising.
“The point stands,” he said. “It was a nice gesture. It’s not your fault what happened, afterwards.”
“I don’t want to go back to Azkaban.” He looked down at his treacle tart. It had turned out better than expected.
“You,” said Potter. They had reached the pitch. Potter sat on the grass, and when Draco hesitated, motioned for him to sit, too.
“He used to take my punishments, in the war,” said Draco conversationally, reverting to regular English as if he was switching between languages. “My father. Not Blaise.” He sang.
“Not tonight, thank you,” said Lucius. “I’d better be on my way. We’ll talk more about the lighting, Draco.”
“Are you two fucking?” he asked them, as he got out his dick and peed, with very poor aim, rather more
It had been a half-hearted attempt. His father had crucioed him and told him not to be stupid. Draco hadn’t tried again. He wasn’t sure it would have made a difference, if he had.
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry. “Hermione’s pissed at me. Here, I’ll bring it closer. It’s really fucking old.”
“Wonderful,” she said. “I’ve already taken some books out of the library to get us started. You mustn’t tell anyone about it, of course. It would be preferable if the press didn’t get wind.”
“One of our regulars submitted an article yesterday that I’m pretty sure’s offensive to hags, so I’ve got to go deal with that.”
They sat around the table, Ron and Malfoy chatting merrily away, Harry glumly chewing the inside of his cheek and thinking about what Malfoy had said about Neville hurting him. Malfoy had never been one for pain. Harry was quite sure that there was nothing Malfoy would find sexier than being handled gently.
Adelaide went to the mirror and stilled. Draco stood next to her. Their mirror images stared back at them, both blond and tall and slender. Neither of them spoke for a moment.
They stood in Neville’s kitchen. Neville had invited everyone around to watch some program Harry had never heard of, and Seamus had insisted the Misery Household attend.
“How dare you,” he said faintly. “I’ll have you know I have been lauded for my normality. Lauded, I tell you.”
“Okay,” said Harry, once Draco was soft and panting. “I’ll see you in a few hours.” He kissed Draco’s eyelids shut. “Go back to sleep.”
“It’s a bit easier now that you know who I am,” said Draco. “Before, it…saddened me to think of the contrast between how you treated me, and how I was scared you would treat me when you found out I was, you know. Me.”
Harry’s heart pounded in his chest. His palms were sweaty. But he knew everyone there, knew them well, and Draco sat on the ground beside him, watching him with affectionate curiosity.
“Ohh,” said Malfoy. He looked off into the distance. “Unrelated, but I still have that schoolgirl outfit, if you want me to put it on.”
They never spoke about it, but Draco started coming around to his flat to see Pansy once a week. Harry would leave them alone together, going over paperwork in the kitchen, listening to the muted sounds of their talk, and, increasingly, their laughter.
Malfoy stretched, his lithe body becoming long and lovely, and he knew how it looked. Harry could tell Malfoy knew what that stretch would do to him.
“Mhmm,” said Malfoy, and he closed his eyes. Harry stared at him, wondering what part of him it was that made him so attractive. Was it the pale eyebrows? The porcelain skin? The pointed nose and chin? Some combination of it all?
Draco wanted to say. He felt as if he had failed Harry. It was a familiar feeling. Draco had always striven to be good enough for Harry. He had never succeeded.
“Your friend can’t have worked here recently, if he’s your age,” said Timothy, sticking out his chin. “You’ve got wrinkles around your eyes. You’re probably well into your thirties.”
“It’s rare. Only happens under a special set of circumstances. And if the wizard’s blood is really fucking pure.”
“No, no, I just…” he laughed. “Like the attention. Let’s get back to you. It sounds like you need a change.”
“It hasn’t been busy today, Mr. Croome,” said the boy, who Harry supposed was called Timothy. Harry observed the man he had followed. Mr. Croome, presumably the owner of the shop. He was huge, ominous. There was something greedy about the way in which looked at Timothy. Timothy seemed to feel this, as well, because he shrank under his gaze. “I’m sorry, sir,” he added. “I did get a woman in asking after some dragon’s blood, but as we aren’t getting any in until June—”
“Not the waitress! Sasha’s dad! The handsome muggle hunk who’s been pining after you all this time.”
Malfoy. Missing fighting with him. Missing his body. Missing the way Malfoy would catch his eye across the great hall and smirk.
They were walking in the park to get away from the Slytherins, who had turned up that morning in varying states of intoxication and built a fort on their living room floor.
“There was a rumour that you were rampaging around,” he said to Harry. He turned to Scorpius. “Mr. Malfoy, I presume?”
“Can I just—” said Harry. Draco and Adelaide both turned to look at him. He was sprawled on the sofa, flicking through the second year defence text book.
“It was an antique,” answered Draco at once, and Harry wondered faintly how he would ever explain to Draco how charming he found him, how creative and marvellous. “It was actually an old Nazi gun from WWII. Very dangerous. Very valuable. Very symbolic. Distressed to have been apprehended whilst I toiled away at my nefarious wrong-doings, I shot the handsome young policeman! In self-defence, he—”
Harry stared blankly at his fireplace. Hermione began mending everything that had been broken. When she was done, she put the kettle on; got out the mugs. She stopped in surprise when she opened the tea cabinet.
Draco knew he shouldn’t, but he grabbed Harry’s hand, turned it open, and kissed his palm. When he looked up, he tried to express with his eyes what he couldn’t with words.
“Okay,” said Harry, soothingly, because Draco sounded as if he was about to start panicking. Draco nodded. He still hadn’t looked at Harry.
“You’re Draco Malfoy, reformed dickhead,” said Harry, and Draco laughed, and they didn’t talk about it anymore that afternoon. But Harry didn’t let it go. Draco spent so much time at the manor, and it weighed so heavily on him. Harry hated to think of him going through it alone. He asked and he asked, until finally Draco agreed, with wide, unhappy eyes.
“I want to see you perform again. When’s your next gig?” asked Harry on the phone. He hadn’t got home until eleven thirty, so there was only time for a quick call before bed.
“Slytherin, darling. House of evil. Much easier to hate the lot of us. Anyway, you’ve certainly unsettled everyone. People are speculating that you’ll come out in favour of Granger’s Reconciliation Act.”
“A quarter of a million galleons,” said Luna, when they had counted all the checks at the end of the night. “That’s a lot of money, Draco.”
“Yeah, look, I’m not saying we don’t have shit to work through! But… Draco, look at me. Look at me!”
“I…” Harry was stumped. He couldn’t imagine why Malfoy was asking him. Was it guilt? Prurient curiosity? But something in him compelled him to answer. Cedric deserved to be talked about. “He was good looking.”
“It’s just a new way of being,” he said. “It’s fine. I’ll adapt.” He smiled at Harry. “I thought it would be worse.”
“Well, that seemed personal,” said Draco, transfiguring it back. “And if you recall, we’re trying to age the cat, not change the cat.”
In many ways, this set Draco at ease. It was simpler to be quiet and to listen than it was to figure out how to be a good person.
He had predicted that Adelaide would be a decent flyer, because she was in good shape, and she was reckless. She kicked off from the ground fearlessly, and although she was a bit wobbly on the turns, she had the makings of a pretty decent flyer, given that she was coming to it so late. Harry shouted instructions at her as she flew. Draco sat on the garden bench, following Adelaide’s every move with a rather nervous set to his mouth, his wand out.
He spoke his piece, explaining how Malfoy had arguably saved his life at the Manor, how he had tried to stop Crabbe and Goyle from killing him, how he had lowered his wand instead of harming Dumbledore. Malfoy looked utterly bedraggled, but he sat tall, with his eyes lowered. He had only been in Azkaban for three months, but he was wasting away. Grief had evidently struck him hard. He did not meet Harry’s gaze, even though Harry tried to make him look.
She pushed her plate forward, resting her arms on the table, fiddling with her bangles. Draco suspected she had shoplifted them.
“Thank you,” said Ron, grabbing Draco’s hand, when Draco went to bed. Draco looked pleasantly surprised.
Dean stood. His expression held so many different things, Harry couldn’t begin to guess at it. He stepped forward, took Seamus in his arms—Seamus went quite floppy and let him—and kissed him as if he was the only thing that mattered.
“Come in,” said Draco. He wasn’t angry anymore, at least, no more angry than he always was, at everything.
“Why? Come on, open it.” He waved the oblong package in Draco’s face, but suddenly Draco rose to his feet, looking—furious? Harry would have called the expression furious, if he had seen it at Hogwarts. Now that he knew Draco better, there was something else to it— it seemed conflicted, frightened.
“They’ll send you flowers,” said Draco, as if it was a joke, but he looked away with an expression of such acute distress that Harry reached out and held his arm. They walked to the edge of the tower where Dumbledore had fallen, and looked down.
After he had drunk about a gallon of tea with Ron and Hermione, he went back to his shitty flat and opened his laptop.
They didn’t say anything else after that. They were silent when Harry washed Draco’s hair, when Draco got out of the shower first and held out a towel for Harry, then wrapped him up in it and stood holding him for twenty seconds. They were quiet as they brushed their teeth, although Draco did laugh when Harry dried Draco’s hair with a towel, tousling him like a wet dog.
“Draco,” said Clarence. He looked as if he didn’t quite know what to say. Draco’s divorce had been in the papers, so everyone knew about it.
“You’re putting me on,” said Draco, this hideous realisation only just occurring to him. “Weasley’s hiding behind that door. This has all been a long con!”
Harry could feel the different threads of him pulling at each other. The wolf in him was furious, wanted to throw the plate at the wall and then push Draco up against it and show him that he wasn’t to belong to anyone else, only to one person, only to Harry. The normal,
Back at Grimmauld Place, Harry poured himself the longed-for glass of wine. Something wasn’t right. For one thing, he didn’t know why the Slytherins still hated him so much. Pansy and Blaise and Millicent all worked at the Ministry, and they were perfectly cordial to the other Gryffindors. Ron and Blaise even flew together sometimes at weekends. But all three Slytherins were consistently cold and impolite to Harry. He had raged about it at first, thinking they hated him because he represented wizard-muggle relations and house elf freedom and everything else the war had been fought for. But then he and Hermione ran into Pansy at the pub, and she was perfectly lovely to Hermione. It was just Harry she was still rude to.
“Sorry. Sorry. Was just seeing if Adelaide would notice if I—” Potter’s face grew cold and cruel. Draco hastened on. “But she’s busy, anyway, so it’s fine.”
The result was that, whereas he once would have shown off to impress Clarence, he now became quiet and questioning. It was a funny thing, how the easiest way to seem clever and fascinating was to make
“She is betraying the house elf cause!” shouted an elf, far down the dormitory. Draco turned to look for the speaker, but they had hidden behind their curtains.
“You heard me,” said Seamus. “Pretty little camboy you made for us. Bet your dad’s real proud of you, huh, Malfoy?”
They seemed to get on so well. Draco laughed a lot when they spoke, and it seemed genuine, but maybe he laughed like that with everyone. Draco often came in their private sessions, but then who knew if he was using some kind of spell for that.
They sat in the library. Draco handed Harry documents, and Harry signed them. It took the better part of an hour, but each time Harry signed his name, he felt lighter. Draco looked as if he expected Harry to take back his offer at any moment.
Harry stopped talking, because Draco had literally put his hands over his ears and started chanting “la la la, I can’t hear you!”
He was in a neat little kitchen. Potter looked slightly tipsy. His hair was more than usually ridiculous. He let go of Draco’s arm and Draco felt suddenly cold.
“No, not goth.” She pushed Draco’s hair out of his face. Touched his chin, his cheek bones, his eyelids. When he opened them, he saw Potter watching them, although he instantly turned away and pretended to be very interested in something Longbottom was saying. Draco settled his gaze back on Astoria, who was looking at him with intense concentration, touching him as if he were clay she wanted to mold. “Not goth,” said Astoria again, taking Draco’s chin in her hand and moving his face from side-to-side. “Byronic.”
Harry watched as Narcissa grew crueller, less sympathetic. “You’ve run out of help,” she told Draco. The more people attacked Draco, the more he lacerated himself through the memory of his mother, whose face began to morph in subtle ways.
“Oh,” said Draco. He had known that was what Potter would say, but he had thought it would make Potter feel virtuous to have to say it.
“No, I’ll stay with you until you come down.” He muttered something else. Harry caught the tail end of it: “…hurt yourself.”
Draco could see the wheels turning, could see Steven deciding to torture him into insanity now, even though it was earlier than planned.
“I think he screwed you over in more ways than one,” said Harry, because it was clear that they were going to have to talk about it.
Draco closed his eyes and tilted his forehead towards the wall, only for a second, then looked shyly at Harry.
Potter still had Draco’s hand. It was Draco’s good one, thankfully. Draco stared at him, dizzy from the Apparition, from the sudden sense of rescue, of security.
“He’ll be all right,” said Hermione. “He’s just a bit shaken. Don’t jostle him, I don’t know how his ribs splintered. He might pierce his lung.”
Scorpius shot suddenly out of the sitting room door, racing past Eve and Harry and slamming his bedroom door.
Harry waited for Draco to explain further, but he didn’t. Finally, Harry stood and went to the door.
Shark cowered under the table. (He was very wary of Harry. It was one of the few things that reminded Harry that something was wrong with him.) Draco was pale and hard-eyed. Adelaide stood a few feet away, her fine features twisted in an expression of derision. Neither of them noticed Harry, in the doorway.
“After he was defeated, it was chaos, right, you remember that,” said Harry, finally. “I can’t even remember most of it clearly. The next thing I remember was fucking Mundungus Fletcher—”
“I’m sorry,” she said, pointing and flexing her toes. She kept alternating between rubbing ice all over her skin, and wrapping herself in thick blankets.
He went to the nearest church, the one he always passed on his way to the Apparition point. It was a mediocre medieval thing, clumsy English Gothic, dark and ungraceful. He sat in the last pew and cried.
“Fuck’s sake,” he muttered. “Fine, we can call it off. But I wish you’d had your cold feet earlier; Goyle had to buy a portkey specially.”
“Scorpius…” Harry sighed. “Look. There is nothing that could happen between me and your dad that would change the fact that I love you.”
“You can always borrow it. You only have to ask,” said Harry, although even as he said it, he knew that wasn’t quite true. If Cassie had asked him to borrow the cloak so that she could break into the ministry, would he have given it to her? Of course not.
Draco nodded to himself and wandered back to the table, not looking at Harry. Harry duplicated his tea cup and poured Draco his tea, just as he liked it. Draco sat on the bench and pulled the cup towards him.
Draco had thought he had remembered how good it was, but he hadn’t, really. He had forgotten that Harry woke him up by stroking his hair and smiling at him. He had forgotten how Harry had sex, intently and intensely. He had forgotten how often Harry made him laugh, not a fond, affectionate laugh, but an irresistible, beyond-prevention sort of laugh.
Draco had sounded so sure when he told Harry that Harry had never loved him. But then what about that feeling that had pulsed through Harry, when that fragmentary recollection had come to him in the middle of the night?
Harry thanked him and made his way to upstairs. But the library was empty. Neither was Draco in his room, when Harry knocked.
“But it was only a crush, at this point, because I scarcely knew you. And then fucking Blaise gave me fucking stress-catism.”
Thank you to everyone for reading and commenting, I love adjusting the story slightly based on feedback as I go, it's such a privilege of fan fiction!
Malfoy Manor looked rather the worse for wear. There were dead peacocks on the lawn, in varying states of decay. The front door was opened by a house elf wearing what looked like Parisian
“That sounds rubbish,” said Draco. “I want it all back the way it was.” At least, he started saying that, but the grief came for him, as he had known it would. He ended up choking on his tears. They were gone. Both of them. Just,
There was an awkward silence. Then Astoria got off the bed and came to sit next to him on the dressing table.
Harry, Cassie and Draco sat at the back of Lucius’ funeral. There were not many people in attendance, and Draco walked out early. Harry did not go after him. He suspected that Draco wanted to be alone. But after they had watched the coffin be lowered into the ground, after Draco had exchanged a few murmured condolences with his mother, Harry put his arm around him and drew him away, and they went to the Imperial War Museum.
“Is everything okay?” he asked, even though it clearly was not. However neatly dressed he was, Draco was evidently on the brink of collapse. His hair flopped into his eyes. It looked good, but also deeply and shockingly unkempt. He turned his head towards Harry.
“I haven’t forgotten,” she said, cuddling closer to him. He put one hand on her head and tucked it under his chin. He felt like crying, but didn’t.
The door shut behind Klaus. Harry was staring at Draco, but Draco couldn’t meet his eye, and his stomach churned with a fearful sort of pain.
“Well…” said Harry, a definitely very bad idea occurring to him. “I do have a cursed object that would turn you into a kitten.”
he was to see him, to have proof that Draco was alive, fine, protectable. “The Hammersmith murderer; he’s got you on his list. He’s been targeting young Death Eaters.”
But Harry couldn’t. Instead, he reached out and took Draco’s hand. Draco let him. Let Harry run his index over the tip of each finger.
“I’m not sure that’s the word,” said Neville. He seemed, frankly, as if he was having a very bad day. “I see them out of the corner of my eye. It’s my mum and dad. They sort of crawl around. I saw them on the tube a week ago, it—”
“Malfoy,” said Harry cautiously. He was trying this new thing where he didn’t hate people. It wasn’t going well. He hated everyone.
“A bit naff, but in a good way,” said Ron, coming to sit next to Harry. Then more and more people crowded around him, congratulating him. Some of them seemed merry and bewildered, others strangely earnest, some even near tears.
“That’s okay,” said Harry. He tipped his head suddenly forward and nudged his nose into Malfoy’s, who made a shocked sound. “Now say hello. You’re being rude.”
“He’s always been a bit threatened by you.” He picked up his glass, then put it back down, unsipped. “He thinks I have a crush.”
“Clever,” said Draco. He was leaning against the wall. Harry thought he was trying to look casually graceful, but in fact he just seemed exhausted. “Doing it on her territory.”
“So I’m in love with him, and he fancies me, and we live together, and there’s nothing we can fucking do about it?” said Harry, kicking at an old cigarette butt.
“I can’t,” said Draco. Harry looked up when he heard the tears in his voice. He came to sit on the window sill next to Draco and pulled him close. It had been so long since he had done that. Draco swallowed and blinked until the rising swell of tears had been pushed back. He felt closer to Harry than he had since they kissed in the pub, a month ago. He had to try to express himself, at least a little. “I’m…sorry…” he began, saying each word slowly, as if he were walking across black ice, “…when…I…upset…you. I’m… always…sorry.”
He was used to fighting Draco, though. It was something he was pretty good at. He was ready to fight Draco into dating him, if necessary.
They never flew together, though. Ron came to get him for a friendly game with the Weasleys a couple of times a week, and Harry couldn’t bring himself to ask if Malfoy could join. It wasn’t even because he was a Malfoy: it was because the games felt like part of the Weasley grieving process, and only family belonged. Given the fact that Harry and Ginny hadn’t worked out, he felt lucky they still included him in that. Harry thought about trying to explain this to Malfoy, but he suspected Malfoy would close up, the way he always did with anything to do with the past.
“Everything,” said Eve, and for a second Harry thought she really meant it, that Malfoy had broken the Statute and told them about magic, but then she went on. “About how he was in some kind of violent white-supremacist gang or something.”
in prison. It’s a conversation between him and Lady Philosophy, who we think may have been the ghost of a woman he loved, possibly his wife or mother. She advises him on how to go on when all has been lost.”
Malfoy just laughed. Harry hadn’t had anything to drink, but he felt suddenly drunk. Dizzy and hopeful and sad.
Harry stared at him, wishing and wishing that this could be easy, comfortable, right. Wishing that Will loved him and he loved Will and they were home to each other. Wishing he had a home in someone. In
“Oh! Ron,” said Hermione, turning away from Draco to kiss Ron. But when Draco tried to step away, Ron stopped the kiss and pulled Draco close.
Harry didn’t know what to do with his hands. He rested them on the counter in front of him, not looking at Draco more than he had to.
. It’s actually deceptively simple. I’ve never shagged her once. Happy to give you tips, if you need.”
Harry arrived at the same time the next day. Draco wasn’t surprised, but he was pleased. For the moment, anyway, he seemed to have Harry’s attention.
“Look,” Millicent was arguing. “When Draco’s kicked the bucket, a photo of him in bed with Potter will go a long way to help out Narcissa!”
had knitted him a bottle-green jumper out of soft lambswool. Draco, of course, hadn’t got gifts for any of them. It hadn’t even occurred to him that they would exchange gifts. He was embarrassed and ashamed.
“Sorry. Yes. Yes, I did practice. And I did the reading.” She took a strand of her hair and chewed on it for a moment. “I should have thought. I know that kind of thing makes you sad. The story, I mean.”
for each other,” said Ginny. “He’s being unbelievably stubborn. We’ve all told him how happy you were. He’s seen plenty of memories of you two together. I have no idea why he’s being such a cunt.”
“I would never expect you to,” said Harry, and he meant it. He didn’t feel threatened by Draco’s relationships with his other clients. Draco had worked with them for longer than he had worked with Harry, and never fallen for them. Anyway, Harry was not about to make any of Draco’s precious few relationships more difficult. He didn’t want to contribute to Draco’s loneliness anymore than he already had.
As with Ron and Hermione, they spent the first few hours catching him up on their lives. When they asked him questions about himself, he deflected.
Harry stopped at the tone in Draco’s voice. They were on the landing outside Draco’s room now. Draco licked his lips, looking nervous.
“I’m scared of asking him too much,” said Harry. “I think he’s got a lot of orders he has to follow, and I don’t want to make him break one by accident.”
“Well, he’s still planning on going through with it,” said Harry to his knees. “So I wish him and Clarence and their fucking expensive clothes every happiness.”
“So, er, this can be your room,” said Harry. Malfoy inclined his head, but didn’t say anything. He had scarcely said a word since arriving at Grimmauld Place. “From what Hermione said, you probably shouldn’t go out too much unless someone is with you. But Hermione said you were actually looking for a new place to live anyway, since Neville… er, sorry about that, by the way.”
Sometimes, Harry would watch the pensieve Malfoy realise, for a split-second, who Harry was. It was usually when Malfoy brushed Harry’s hair away from his forehead. His eyes would fall on the lightning bolt scar, and they would widen in an expression Harry couldn’t quite read.
Draco cast him a guarded look. Ten seconds passed, as Draco (Harry assumed) processed this new statement and ran through possible responses with military thoroughness, before he finally answered.
“Oh, good, my plan succeeded,” said Draco. “My grand plan to turn you into a werewolf. Finally! My ambitions have been reached!”
They went back to Harry’s office after the match. Harry found the collar in one of his cabinets and held it out to Draco.
“All right,” said Adelaide, standing so that she could hug him better. “I don’t want to tell you what to do. I only don’t want you to settle for someone shitty just because they were your childhood crush.”
“See, I thought it wasn’t fair that Harry should get all the fun,” said Steven. “Harry, say that Draco has to obey me just like he obeys you, until you say otherwise.”
Harry was so stupid. And in a way it made sense; he and Neville had always been destined for similar things, to have lives that doubled each other. It made sense that they would both fall for the same person. And it was Neville’s turn, now, to be chosen.
Blaise didn’t answer right away. He ordered them another round of drinks. Harry noticed that he was wearing exquisitely cut robes. They probably cost a fortune.
“Does this mean you’ll stop running about like a headless chicken, trying to tick everything off your list?”
“Dinner,” he said. They ordered in. They talked about nothing, just as they used to when they cammed. They watched a stupid film. Draco stayed glued to Harry’s side.
“See,” said Draco, noticing that his fork was dirty and cleaning it on his sleeve, “no one is perfect for anyone else, are they?”
“You should be careful,” said Hermione. “You can’t just casually date him, Harry. Think how complicated a break up would be. And you’re not very nice to him when you sleep with him.”
“All right,” he said. Then he put his head in his hands, his elbows on his knees. Harry reached over and rubbed his back, his hand moving slowly over the rough wool of his jumper. Draco held very still, but did not tell him to stop.
It was funny, how much Harry missed Pansy living with him, although he couldn’t bring himself to regret her loss when he saw how happy she was with Blaise. Blaise, too, seemed like a different person—still drawling and theatrical, but inclined to kindness rather than cynicism.
Harry got his breakfast and sat down at the table. Timothy rested his chin on his knuckles and looked between Harry and Draco.
“…in light of these findings, I submit that my client was purposefully led into a position where it was not only
Draco narrowed his eyes and took a long drink of wine, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand afterwards.
“Let me,” said Harry. Draco stood very still as Harry unbuttoned him, and gently took his shirt off. He folded it over the arm of a nearby chair. Draco stood, half naked, staring at him with wide eyes. He was covering his Dark Mark with his hand. Harry helped him into his pyjama shirt, but did not button it.
Malfoy cast a stinging hex at him as Harry pushed past. Malfoy was quick at wandwork, but not as quick as Harry. Harry cast a spell at him that sent him sprawling into a stack of wooden crates.
“Don’t look at me like that,” said Astoria. “He jumped on the idea. Elf liberation is very stylish just now. And all this will do wonders to clear your name.”
Harry approached him slowly. He didn’t say anything. He just put one arm around Draco’s shoulders and rested their heads together.
. Kreacher had known him since he was a baby. Kreacher understood who he was, where he came from, what had been lost. Draco sank to one knee before him.
Harry felt awful when he read Draco’s letter. He had picked questions that could conceivably be useful for a prank, but when he read Draco’s reply, he realised he didn’t have a prank in mind. He never had done.
“Oh, sweet, you can’t possibly think I’m kicking you out. How would I survive? I’m useless. But I’m trying to make people think I’ve given up Evil, you see. House elf enslavement is currently classed as evil.”
It was all very surprising, like an explosion. Draco was quietly aware that if he were more himself his feelings would be different—not that he’d object, because everything felt—wonderful—but that he would be more opinionated on the subject of Allowing Potter To Fuck Him. But he was so floaty and relieved still, as though he were dreaming, and he kissed Potter back as if there weren’t any walls between them. As if they had already done the work to get on the same page.
, he reminded himself. That had been one of the terrors of the manor under the Dark Lord. The feeling that there was nowhere to hide, even inside his own head. But he could think what he liked, now, and no one could peep inside his skull. He luxuriated in the privacy of his own mind.
“It’s stuff like… one time, this little girl asked for my autograph, and I was in such a bad mood, and I had blisters, but still, fuck, I was so rude—”
But he understood, now. He knew that part of the anger he felt when he looked at Malfoy was because he wanted to touch him so badly, but couldn’t.
?” asked Harry. He had broken free of Nancy’s embrace without noticing it, and was looking from Adelaide to Malfoy in horror. In the bright light of the Ministry holding cell, she didn’t look eighteen at all. She couldn’t have been older than fifteen, in fact.
what he wanted, rather than taking it. Him kissing her slowly, calling her beautiful and perfect and special—he always called her special, which she had thought stupid at first. It had grown on her.
“Draco,” said Blaise. “He gives eighty thousand pounds a year to charity and lives off the scraps. He doesn’t own a winter coat. Look, I get that he did bad things, but there’s remorse, and then there’s…” He trailed off and passed his hand over his face. “Sorry. I’ve just been so fucking worried about him for so long.”
“Are you terribly lonely without Pansy Parkinson, Harry?” he asked Harry, pulling her close and kissing her on the cheek. “Are you like a flower in a winter of no sun?”
“Christ, Potter, don’t kill him,” drawled Draco, or tried to, but it came out rather drunken and confused. “He’s not your childhood nene—nemen—
Harry had only one theory about what he had done that was so awful he had asked to be obliviated. He must have told Draco about his feelings. Draco probably hadn’t returned them, and then freaked out about what it would mean for him if Harry felt humiliated, and Harry had offered to have his memory wiped to set Draco at ease.
“You think I,” said Draco, realisation dawning slowly, because everything about him was slow these days, because two thirds of his mind was tied up in the ticking of the clock, each second that passed adding to the blows he would receive upon his return. “You think I
“We’re going to have to spread out across London,” said Hermione. “I brought these tracking devices with me; they’re new. They’re matched with the knife prints found on the bodies. But we’ll need to physically scan through likely areas.”
“No,” said Harry. “Of course not.” He turned his face to Draco, and tried to smile. “You’re right. Let’s just be friends.”
“Yeah?” said Harry, wishing he was home, wishing he was in New York, wishing he was in some different moment of his timeline. “What do you know?”
“He’s unhappy,” said Draco. “He’s all fucked from the war. And anyway, he’s right, it’s mental that we were ever together.”
Draco looked at him as if Harry had just suggested having wild, spontaneous, unprotected sex together on the roof.
“Anything interesting happened tonight?” he asked, as they went to the holding cells. Ron had the shift there for the next few hours.
“I actually think it’s the nights, really,” said Draco. “I don’t think he’d want me to sleep in his bed so often if he hated me.”
Later, he thought back to what he had talked about in that session and was ashamed of himself, of his selfishness. He had barely mentioned Adelaide at all.
“How can I? This is so confusing—and bloody hopeless…” Harry sank into an armchair and put his head in his hands. “I don’t want to fall in love with him. It’s too fucking sad as it is.”
Draco stopped, rolled his eyes, and pecked her on the lips. Truthfully, he wasn’t even angry at her anymore. It was the sort of betrayal he was used to; people manipulating him because they loved him and thought they knew best. Love
“Go for it,” said Harry, and Draco took off into the sky, flying with a dizzy carelessness that reminded Harry how young Draco still was. It was easy to forget that.
. Anyway, I found one that would be just right for you and Draco, and it’s in his budget, if not yours.”
“I just hated you. Until the battle, and the trial, and…everything. Having time to think, in Azkaban. All those fucking muggle novels.”
He was too tired to be surprised when Draco pulled him close and wrapped his arms around him, so that Harry’s head rested on his chest. He did make a small noise, however, when Draco kissed the top of his head.
It had been devastating to discover who he had been sleeping with, of course. Harry had spent long nights imagining worst case scenarios in the lead up to the Reveal, but nothing as awful as this had ever occurred to him.
Harry’s stinging hex was well-aimed and powerful. Draco flinched back in his chair, fear flooding his brain.
“Are you all right?” asked Harry, when they were nearing the locker rooms. Draco smiled unconvincingly.
Neville shook his head, looking frustrated. Breaking up with Draco seemed to have had no impact on whatever it was he was struggling with—his hair was straggly, his eyes bloodshot.
Harry span around. He had been chopping green chilli peppers, and hadn’t heard Malfoy come in. It had been almost a week since the night Malfoy was drunk, and Harry had been avoiding him ever since.
Harry had just finished the eighth book in the series and didn’t feel like starting the next one yet.
Harry spent all his time skulking near that statue, watching for Knutters. Croome had explained about their secret signal— they carried a copy of a French muggle newspaper,
“God, I missed you so much,” said Harry, dropping kisses wherever he could reach. “I missed you like
“Well, he won’t have done too well among that lot, then,” said Timothy. He sighed. “How long can I stay?”
“You came,” he said, sounding surprised, even though Harry had told him repeatedly that he would. Draco was disorientingly beautiful, like some genderless, inhuman creature, gracefully sweeping towards Harry in emerald green robes and stage make up. He took Harry’s outstretched hands—Harry wasn’t aware that he had been reaching—and kissed him on both cheeks. Harry didn’t read too much into it. Draco was like this after shows, sometimes, ostentatiously gay, as if still half on stage.
The wand shook in Draco’s hand for a moment longer, and then it fell to the ground with a clatter, and Draco hunched back over the table, shoulders heaving.
“Yeah, it’s good to see you, too,” said Harry, nervously watching Dean out of the corner of his eye. Dean’s feet tapped constantly, and he drummed his fingers on his legs, and his teeth were like old tombstones, all crooked and rotten.
see in him? Gee, Harry, I just don’t know. Do you think it’s his chiselled jaw, or his six pack, or his vast fortune?”
Ron sent out three patronuses as Hermione handed out the trackers, and Harry explained the protocol for if they found anything. Luna, Dean, Michael and Susan arrived halfway through his explanation, and he had to begin again.
Adelaide picked the film, a truly bizarre tale of sexy sad women working in a bar in New York. Draco looked dourly resigned when she announced it, and said “Well, Harry, I hope you like poorly constructed plot and thin dialogue.”
“So let’s get back to London and never do this again,” said Harry, and Draco laughed, clearly unaware that he had laid bare his heart.
“It’s not really the kind of love I meant,” he said. Blaise sat next to him and leant his forehead against Draco’s shoulder.
“Mr. Malfoy, it seems you have been taking advantage of Mr. Potter’s generosity. I suppose you thought this plan would free you both from the bond and from Azkaban, but I assure you it will not work as you intended.”
But nowadays, he knew that Ginny no longer fully trusted him. No longer felt sure he loved her. Once, he might have told her, “Weirdly, I seem to want to get off with Malfoy on the internet” and she would have found it funny and maybe even a bit hot. Now, he was keeping it from her, because he knew how deeply it would wound her.
“Anytime, doll. I’ve missed you. Hey, there’s a crazy shindig this Saturday at the magic warehouse in Camden, one of my friends is bringing mescaline; ever tried mescaline?”
you, exactly,” said Potter, racing to keep up with Draco. “I was more, er, going to the place where I knew you were.”
Once Draco had gone through, Harry took a few deep breaths. The green light had made his heart rate spike. He calmed himself down, took a handful of floo powder, and managed not to flinch at the green light that followed his words.
“What did you want to tell me?” asked Michael, starting to massage Draco’s hand. Michael was clearly off his face as well.
“For end of life care, we can’t really improve much on muggle medication,” said the healer. Next to Harry, Pansy nodded. Draco was swearing loudly on the day bed, as if he could shout the pain away. The healer was able to give them magically modified morphine, which wasn’t physically addictive and was administered slightly differently, although still via the drip.
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry. He frowned. Clearly he hadn’t expected this to be so easy, and Draco’s heart broke in a thousand different ways, for both of them. Harry didn’t look well. He looked as if he needed someone to take care of him, and Draco longed—not only to care for Harry, but also just to know that Harry was cared for.
“That was ambitious of you,” said Malfoy. “Or maybe you underestimated my charms. I’m offended, really.”
“Yeah, nice try, mate,” said Mark roughly. “Still not as good as the one about the magic wand fight in the bathroom.”
“What do you want to do, darling, shall we talk about the war? You wanted to talk about the war, I’m ready, what do you want to know, ask me anything, darling, I’ll tell you anything!”
Draco didn’t answer, which confirmed Harry’s theory that it had been years since Draco had actually read one of his letters. He was clearly living life as a muggle. It would be difficult for him to receive owls all the time.
Harry was blushing. He hadn’t thought too much about what he wrote to Scorpius. He certainly hadn’t expected Scorpius to
,” said Draco, when a weedy Hufflepuff cast a burn jinx at him. “Do it again; I’ll take off my shirt!”
He tried to work on inorganic potion theory. A headache built in the back of his head. He never used to get headaches, before that day that he’d slept with Potter and Tertius had punished him for coming home late. He ignored the throbbing that seemed to spread from the crown of his head, and moved on to working on his pain potion formula. All the options on the market either caused grogginess or dependency, or both, so he couldn’t use them. He was trying to find some way to make a pain potion that truly had no side effects.
Harry shook his head. He had a lump in his throat. It was bizarre how jealous he was of Malfoy. Or maybe of Scorpius. He genuinely couldn’t tell which of them he envied more.
Draco bit his lip and moaned sexually. An American tourist passing by paused to look at him. Draco winked and the tourist hurried away, scandalised. Harry and Draco caught each other’s eyes and laughed.
“Will you go to bed?” They had reached the main hall. Neville and the couple had disappeared.  Although Harry still felt wonderful, he didn’t like the idea of having to feel wonderful all by himself.
,” said Pansy, and the next bottle broke into shards. “No, Potter, he’s not. Draco has a rule. He doesn’t take drugs when he feels like shit.”
shit like that,” she said. “It makes you sound like a serial killer, and we’ve only just convinced everyone you’re
He could hear L breathing. Harry wanted so badly to open the door and force his way in, to sweep L up in his arms.
Draco stared at her. Her voice was calm, and he understood it. It made sense to him. He could feel his mind groping along the train of her words, a thread that led out of the maze.
There was a flash and a cackle from the doorway. Millicent had just taken a picture of them on a large camera that reminded Harry painfully of Colin Creevey. Amid the general outcry that rose up from the Slytherins, Harry heard Draco’s voice; low, concerned.
Probably the real reason Mr Dinsmore hated Draco so much was that Draco was better than him at his job. Within about three months of working at
Harry had never told anyone about the Dursleys. Not really. Ron knew a bit, but had never asked him anything. Not because he didn’t care, of course Harry knew he cared. He probably just thought Harry would talk about it when he was ready. But it was such a… downer. Harry never brought it up. The only way he would ever have told anyone was if they asked; if they seemed genuinely interested.
“But official, too,” said Harry. He stirred his drink with his straw. “I don’t know, I don’t want it to sound like we’re just shagging, or whatever.”
“You said negative experiences attach themselves to the people they are connected with. This is a negative experience, and he’s going to connect it to me,” said Draco.
Harry didn’t mind, either way. He knew his persistence reassured Draco; he could tell from Draco’s half smiles and slightly embarrassed eye rolls whenever Harry told him he loved him.
L noticed that Harry was bad at the basic administration needed to keep an adult life afloat. Harry came back to his solitary dorm one evening to find L sitting at his desk, surrounded by neatly stacked piles of paper.
Draco snorted, and Misty looked disgusted. But the assembled house elves were clearly deeply impressed.
Meanwhile, the newspapers were gearing up for the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, and something shifted terribly in Harry’s head. He tried to ignore it.
Except, of course, it didn’t. Lucius had always bought Malfoy anything he wanted, but Harry didn’t remember him ever showing that sort of affection.
When he next woke up, she was watching him. Moonlight filtered in through the windows. He squeezed her close.
Marcus’ eyes went soft. It always looked strange when he was gentle, because his face was was crooked and loutish. But Harry liked it.
then. Because he did, and he could tell Draco needed to hear it. But he also didn’t know what had changed since the days when Draco had refused to be with him, and until that was clear Harry was going to be conservative with his heart.
To his surprise, Harry found that he really wanted to, and he felt that Malfoy wasn’t just being polite. So he did stay. He was mostly silent, watching the comfortable way Eve, Malfoy and Flora interacted. They drank white wine and ordered in pizza and talked about everything but Scorpius.
“It’s because she’s witty when she talks about it. It can be hard to know when she’s serious. Blaise is like that, too. He spent the whole year he was nineteen making suicide jokes and we didn’t find out till last year that he actually attempted it twice.”
But lately, Harry had noticed a change in Draco. Perhaps it was living in a country where no one despised him. Perhaps it was simply the accumulation of months together, of the hundreds, or maybe thousands, of times Harry had told Draco he loved him. Perhaps it was the fact that Ginny came to visit every other weekend, and showed no signs of growing tired of Draco. Whatever it was, Harry could sense something loosening in Draco, something shedding. Draco was happy. Even when his injuries hurt him, he did not retreat into himself. From time to time, he mentioned his mother, and even, on occasion, his father. Neither he nor Harry talked about the war much anymore, not because they were hiding from it, but because it no longer plagued them.
“I didn’t adopt her,” said Draco quickly. “And it was, you know, it’s been a huge mess. I think almost anyone else would have done a better job. But she’s…” He drifted off, staring into space with a quiet smile. “She’s just good, really.” He snapped back to his usual, slightly worried expression. “Sorry, I get very tedious when I talk about her.”
“He told me he could see from my eyes that I’d suffered,” he said, with a sneer. Harry did not remark that it was true— there was something wounded about Malfoy’s eyes. “Eve is really scraping the barrel.”
,” said Adelaide. Draco laughed, and after a beat, Adelaide did too. Then they looked at each other.
“No,” he said, more confidently. “I don’t think Draco was spying on Mysteries. If he was, he wouldn’t have begged me to believe he wasn’t.”
“It’s repulsive. He loves her so much it makes me want to dig out my eyeballs with a spoon,” said Draco.
“Aren’t you easy-going,” said Potter, with an affectionate laugh. They kissed some more, Draco growing more impatient under Potter’s body, more sure that if Potter didn’t undress him soon, he would embarrass himself, he would
“Next time, then,” said Anika. “Okay, well, I’m staying with this stupid rich kid, so I’d better get back.”
“Really?” asked Scorpius, very seriously. He looked only at Andromeda, who Harry was pleased to see looked rather guilty. “Do you really mean it?”
“That’s all right, you don’t need to tell me. I know. Harry Potter will come to the rescue. I’m grateful, honestly, I am. I want to claw my eyes out when I look at you, but I’m grateful.”
They had arrived at Draco’s classroom. Harry grabbed him by the left forearm, and Draco went abruptly still.
“Everything hurts. I’m incredibly brave. I thought we had covered this already. Make sure that’s in my eulogy, Pansy:
. It was such an unfamiliar adjective. Draco liked Harry’s goodness, liked how devoted he was to Teddy, liked that Harry understood Draco’s sense of humour (when he was Lamorak, at least), liked that he happily, easily entered into banter and jokes, even at his own expense. Draco just
“And I’m not going to throw myself off a bridge if we stop messing around,” said Draco. “The solution to my depression was not
Harry turned onto his side, so that they were nose-to-nose. They used to lie like this often, in Mysteries, seeing and not seeing each other.
“At who?” asked Harry. He stayed still, only watching as Draco paced back and forth, back and forth.
“I don’t know how you dealt with it, all those years,” he said, under his breath. “A fourth year boy asked me out in the showers this morning. He
Potter’s glare was filled with loathing. He kept it fixed on Draco as he summoned a quill, ink and a stack of parchment.
with him through Lamorak. That’s not taking advantage. Then, a month before I’m due to die, I tell him who I am, and his anger is mitigated by the tragic sight of my piteous, bed-bound form.”
Harry was astonishingly touched, although he didn’t mention it in his next letter. He just described being dragged to the pub by Ron and Hermione; how someone had come over to him and wept and described in painstaking detail how their mother had died from complications after a Death Eater’s curse.
“Oh, we’re going to have such fun! Right. Draco, you are not to tell anyone about anything that just happened. You cannot tell them in words, writing, or gesture. When I say the word, you must obliviate Harry. When he asks why you did it, you must tell him he told you to do it because he drunkenly embarrassed himself. If he mentions it further, you must become hostile and aggressive until he stops.”
Other times, Ron and Draco seemed to join forces. There was no talking to either of them when they were playing chess, for instance.
She didn’t answer. She would probably give him the cold shoulder for the rest of the week. Sometimes Draco fantasised about twenty-two-year-old Adelaide apologising for being such a difficult teenager, but then he thought about the guilt she’d feel if she remembered it all, and hoped she wouldn’t.
Pansy glanced around for a chair, took one from a nearby table without asking the other people sitting there (they grumbled), and sat next to Harry.
to Mr. Croome. He took me in when no one else—and who even are you, anyway, to poke your nose into my business!”
“Of course. I’m sorry about your father. I’m sure his parents will get him a good lawyer and he’ll be free in no time.”
“Race you!” said Harry, and started running. Draco ran too. They hurtled down the corridor, and Harry reached the end first. “I win! Like quidditch. We should play quidditch!”
Draco barely had time to process what Harry had said before his mother appeared, screeching, at his side. He could only make out snippets of what she said through her incandescent rage:
So Draco gave Hermione space. The progress he made with her had been quite accidental. It was when Harry went to the loo one afternoon, leaving Draco, Ginny and Hermione alone in the library.
“I should think so,” said Draco lightly. “I did win The Golden Pricktease Award at the Shrewsbury Burlesque competition, after all.”
When Harry straightened his desk, he found a long Gringotts form that had mostly been filled out. There was a sticky note on the front, with L’s—
“Oh, God, no!” Draco sat up. “Look. Croome…obviously, now that I’m older, I can see that what he did to me was fucked up. But he also took me in when no one else would… he taught me everything I know about economics… he went to my mother’s funeral with me… it isn’t
“I love you,” said Draco. Afterwards, they lay curled up around each other, and Draco said, “I feel okay.”
“Yes?” said Draco. Clarence beamed, got back to his feet, and put the ring on Draco’s finger. The crowd cheered. Draco smiled, and once he’d started, he couldn’t stop, although he was aware that it was a slightly hysterical smile. He and Clarence hadn’t
“Yes, thank you, Pansy,” said Hermione, through her teeth. Although Pansy was more insistent than Draco’s other friends about infiltrating The Gryffindors, she had not been entirely successful. Ginny had slept with her once, but then, that was Ginny.
“May I touch you?” asked Harry. Draco shook his head, so Harry took the flowers and put them in some water. When he returned to his sitting room, Pansy was sitting next to Draco, her arms around his shoulders, rocking him slowly side-to-side.
“Okay,” said Pansy. “And in exchange, you have to tell Daphne that her hair makes her look as if she’s wearing a fur helmet.”
They waited in the hospital for another hour. Scorpius alternated between standing very close to the bed, staring at Draco, and curling up in Harry’s lap. He did not cry again. Finally, a healer told them Draco was in a stable condition, and that nothing more would be done for him that night.
“No,” said Harry. “I don’t think that. You’ve been through hell, we all have, of course you’re not over it. No one expects you to be.”
“Well, of course he’s going to fall in love with you, Harry,” said Hermione, when he pulled her aside at the Department of Mysteries that evening and told her everything. “No one’s ever been nice to him. You’re handsome and famous and rich. He’s staying at your house. What did you expect?”
She gave him a truly hideous scarf made out of old bottle caps. He held it like a snake and tried to smile.
“It was just freaks, Eve,” said Malfoy, comfortably, from where he was lounging, his head in Flora’s lap. She was stroking his hair, and Nick didn’t seem to mind. “You didn’t have to be posh. It was hardly classist.”
“Oh,” said Harry. He wasn’t sure how, in truth. It was just part of his store of Malfoy-information, like how Malfoy took his tea (although he’d quit caffeine because of his illness) and  what food he liked, and his birthday. Stuff like that. Normal stuff. “Everyone knows that about Malfoy. It’s like, general Draco knowledge.”
“I was a terrible boyfriend to Neville. I drove him mad,” he said. He didn’t seem to notice that Harry had moved away.
, his visitors had been given a private waiting room. Hermione and Ron had recovered from their shock much more quickly than Draco had. They were used to improbably awful things happening to Harry.
“Yeah, I’m not too keen on it myself,” said Draco. Harry knew he probably understood better than most people. “I’ll go first, then.”
Draco opened his mouth to say something, seemed to think better of it, and went to the kitchen to make a fresh pot of tea.
Cynthia nodded—this was the sort of answer that was always completely satisfactory to her—and wiped a bit of tomato off her chin with a paper napkin.
That night, he lay in bed for an hour, trying to sleep. Life was long, that was the problem: a succession of chore-like days, culminating in a cheap funeral. It exhausted him to think of it. His mind boggled at the sheer number of tasks he had to perform to live even the most meaningless existence. Showers, brushing his teeth, three meals, going to the loo, putting on socks, pants, trousers, doing buttons up on a shirt, every day for decades, how did everyone manage it? Were they blind to the misery of it all?
“I missed you,” he said. His expression was raw, his voice unsheathed; it was if he was finally being himself again.
“I’ve obtained permission for you to become an animagus,” said Hermione, handing Draco an elaborate form.
But when Ginny told him how much she cared about him, it always led to Draco panicking, trying to explain to her that
“… and do you think this is a healthy addition to your life?” asked Draco’s therapist. His name was Kevin, and with every passing session, Draco grew more certain of his idiocy. Like now, for instance.
“Is… is everything okay?” asked Hermione, when she came to drop off a book she had borrowed. Harry continued stomping through a particularly furious Romeo and Juliet opus.
“You know, in a parallel universe, those would be adorable nicknames,” said Harry. Ron and Malfoy glared at him.
Kevin was looking at him with a strange expression. Draco was hot, restless. Angry, actually. Yeah, angry.
“After you,” Draco said, opening one dilated eye to look at Harry. “Tertius got—cross—after I saw you, that time.”
But Malfoy had taken Scorpius by the hand and walked away. Harry was distracted by the young witch, who had a lot to say about some article she had read about him in Witch Weekly. When she finally left, Scorpius was back, panting.
The rest of the meal passed in silence. Draco was clearly concentrating on his food, although he kept catching Harry’s eye and smiling. Harry, meanwhile, couldn’t seem to stop smiling. He ate without any notion of what was going in his mouth. He couldn’t think of anything beyond
That spell that had nearly killed Draco in sixth year? Draco ran through all the things he had said in his letters, imagined them plastered all over the
When Harry smiled at Draco the next morning at breakfast, Draco didn’t smile back. He just made a sort of sneering, confused face and looked away. But Harry wasn’t discouraged. The fact was, Draco had been
wedding; if they had slow-danced together like Goyle and Susan Bones, if the glances Draco had thrown him had been full of heat, instead of fear.
“It was truly weird,” said Dean. “He didn’t apologise about the war, only for not being in Azkaban. He seemed really cut up about that, though. Luna said the same thing.”
“So all those times when you two were giggling and whispering to each other, you were talking about him wanking over me?”
Draco felt the pain well up. He tried to remember that he wouldn’t always be in this bathroom with Steven Hodges. In an hour, he would be in the library, sharing jokes with Ginny Weasley. That was the sort of thing that made a life worth living. He didn’t let himself think about Harry, because physical pain was quite enough without the twisting in his heart that came whenever he remembered Harry’s current coldness towards him.
it. Really and truly felt how not alone he was. It made him sob harder, but his heart was lightened.
Draco built up his most powerful Occlumency shields around his feelings for Potter, and let everything else go unprotected, in the hope that the Dark Lord wouldn’t think to look further. He spent two years living in constant terror that he would be discovered. Even now, he sometimes found himself instinctively blocking off parts of his mind when he thought of Potter, in case someone should happen to be looking into it. It was a hard habit to break.
He brought the tea and the snack to her room. She lay face down on the bed, her hair still brown from when he’d glamoured it that morning. He touched it gently with his wand and it went blue.
But he had to make Potter love him. Trust him. It was the only way Draco would ever regain any of the things he had lost— and he had lost so much… His heart constricted; he forced himself to breathe.
“We can’t just avoid each other forever,” said Harry. “He’s your cousin, he’s my godson. You’re friends with my friends. We can be in the same room as each other.”
“I overheard him casting a Patronus. Something about a drop gone wrong—Aurors—werewolves—he’s, he’s mad, he’s so angry, I don’t—”
“I think you’re suffering from thought damage,” said Ron. “It’s something we see a lot in my line of work.”
He couldn’t really explain why he kept thinking about Malfoy and Scorpius all afternoon. Probably it was because he didn’t often encounter Death Eaters. It had been over ten years since the war, and most of them had melted away— they were dead or in Azkaban or abroad. Harry probably didn’t like being reminded of Voldemort and Lucius and… yes, that was all. If his mind kept returning to the sight of Malfoy pulling his son close and asking “What did I do to deserve you?” it was only because it reminded him of Lucius Malfoy.
“No, no, I’ll do it,” said Goyle. “You spoke for me and Draco. You can use my arm for sex stuff anytime.”
“It’s nice to be thought of,” said Draco. “But this is too much.” He put the cravat away. “You should return it.”
“Murder doesn’t stop when wars do, Harry. And I’m afraid there will always be people who would like to murder Mr. Malfoy.”
King’s Cross was packed, but Harry spotted Malfoy and Scorpius from miles away. They were standing still, two slim, straight-backed, blond figures among the seething crowd. As Harry got closer, he noticed several wizards in poor attempts at muggle dress knock into Malfoy deliberately.
By the fourth day, the pain started to come back. On the fifth day, Harry ran eight miles, came back to the house dripping with sweat, still aching. And there was something more, as well, like a memory throbbing in his head, the memory of Malfoy, cold and irritable, telling him to lie back and not touch him. Malfoy refusing to let Harry have sex with him—why? Had it been so bad for him the last time? Because for Harry, it had, unfortunately, been the best sex of his life, the experience that came back to him in the shower when it had been too long since he’d slept with someone.
He flicked through the notebook with one hand. It was crowded with Dean’s small blue handwriting, and with dark, unsettling ink drawings.
Cassie and Draco both nodded; identical, wary nods. Harry clambered onto the bed, settling next to Cassie.
I always find the first part of a story easier to write than the middle/end, so bear with me with updates, and thank you to Tepre for her useful advice after she realised that I could not be compelled to insert more kittens into the narrative
“Oh, it’s all right, only we’ve had to let Steven Hodges in, even though he’s a twat. But twat or no, he’s a good seeker. Not as good as you, of course,” she added, rather testily.
To his great relief, no one tried to contact him. He expected his friends to send him concerned owls as he flaked out of every single social commitment he had made, but no one said anything. He wore his invisibility cloak constantly, even in the house.
“Tell me about the chamber of secrets,” said Draco. So Harry told him: about following the spiders into the Forbidden Forest (“You’re mad,” Draco told him. “Don’t tell Ron I told you he’s scared of spiders,” said Harry.), Harry hearing a slithering voice all over the castle, Riddle’s diary, the chamber of secrets, Fawkes.
