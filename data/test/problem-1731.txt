Harry dropped the mirror and tackled Draco in a hug, hoping that Draco could understand what he was trying to convey; '
Scorpius looked back at Draco, then back at Harry. “Why are there trees in your shop?” he asked, making Harry smile.
you’ve met him,” Harry said, pointedly looking at the two of them.
Nodding, Draco flicked the tassel on the cushion. “I don’t know if my friends are okay with it and my parents –“ he broke off, his voice catching in his throat making him hug his knees to his chest again.
She chuckled. “Anytime,” she replied softly.
Harry shrugged. “I’d want to know too,” he said. “And I’ll force Pomfrey to let you in,” he added, with a smile. “For my mental wellbeing.”
This proved to be rather difficult.
“Obviously not,” Harry grinned. “She’d need glasses, I believe,” Harry joked, and Draco laughed.
Draco suddenly had an idea he was sure he’d regret. “You said you need to ask some questions before hand?”
“I can relate,” Teddy said, spreading jam on another piece of toast.
“Sorry,” Malfoy said, biting back another laugh. “You look quite bemused.”
“I still believe my spell idea wasn’t that bad,” Draco insisted, watching as Blaise was slowly sinking to the floor. He bit back a laugh.
“OI! MUMSEY” Sirius shouted up the stairs. “
Harry had never seen Malfoy show as much emotion on his face as in that moment. “What does that mean?” Malfoy asked, staring at the horizon, watching the birds fly in the distance.
Draco sat up. “Harry,” he called out. Harry froze, facing away from Draco, who’s vision had now adjusted to the light. “Nightmares?” he asked.
Peace.
Draco considered the offer. “That too I suppose,” he sniffed, a smile tugging at his lips. “Did you come in for tea, or did you just wish to bother me with your general existence?” Draco deflected, letting go of Harry’s hands, much to Harry’s disappointment, only to tuck a stray strand of hair behind Harry’s ear.
“It’s rosemary,” Draco answered, despite Harry not asking a question.
As he kept walking, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about them. He wondered whether they actually were father and son, he had assumed they were, but they might not have even been related. Perhaps the man was looking after a friend’s child, the way Harry sometimes looked after Rose and Hugo for Hermione and Ron. Maybe the child was lost, and the man was comforting the child until their parents arrived.
time she fills his head with
It was when he was left to his own devices that he felt the soft pull at his heart. It was faint, distant, a pull that was easily ignored if he filled his time with menial tasks. The pull dragged him to his trunk, where he found the last letters his mother wrote to him, placed delicately on the top.
that was not what I was expecting,” Ron said, more to himself than anyone else. Hermione was watching Harry with an unidentifiable look in her eye. “Not that I’m against you liking blokes!” he corrected. “Just –
“I overheard my parents talking about you,” Malfoy said quietly, pulling his knees up to his chin. Harry turned his head away from the view to look at Malfoy. “They’re careful with their words around me, so I don’t know much more than what I told you,” he said, looking up at Harry.
“Absolute blasphemy Potter, it’s a privilege for anyone to get that close to me,” Draco scoffed, lifting his chin up.
“You’re always full of surprises,” he muttered.
They held each other tightly, as if worried the other would disappear.
Andromeda shot Narcissa a nasty glare that made Draco want to instantly run from the parlour, but her expression softened when she returned her eyes to Draco. “Not having magic isn’t bad Draco,” she sighed, reaching out for his hands.
claustrophobic.
Glancing at the clock on the wall, Harry noticed it was almost four o’clock. Without wasting another second, he quickly rummaged around the kitchen, in an effort to make tea that would be ready as Andromeda arrived.
similar to my cupboard?” he said through his teeth. No one had noticed the outburst as George had decided it would be an excellent time to demonstrate a new product on Fred, which had the room laughing.
“Dad says that it’s the way you make it,” the boy explained. “It has to be done the Mu- the
The three began to play, and Harry was right, it didn’t take Draco long to pick up on how to play, but that didn’t mean he was good at it. After seven losses, Draco wondered if was ever going to win a game of Rummy.
The Malfoy legacy had been broken.
okay,” Draco grinned. “You won’t be the only one, there are many people who come from families who don’t know about magic,” Draco explained, hoping his words were comforting. From the way the boy’s shoulders relaxed, it looked like they were. “I can explain them if you’d like?” he offered.
someone?” Teddy asked, as if the idea was awful, before swallowing the toast.
“You aren’t the only one,” Draco shrugged.
“I want him to have the childhood I wish I did, and not to have the same beliefs I used to.” Draco shuddered at the thought of who he used to be and what he used to believe. “I’d do anything to give him that.”
Harry shrugged. “Who are we to say whether or not they exist?” he grinned, enjoying the exasperated look Malfoy shot at him.
This was not a conversation he wanted to have; it was a conversation he had successfully avoided his whole life. He refused to be a burden; now the Prophet was going to force him to make something from nothing. He knew his living situation was mediocre at best, but he’d survived it for fourteen years, what was two more?
Harry grinned once more. “We’re taking a shortcut,” he announced, and Draco froze, a lazy grin pushing onto his face.
“Potter,” Draco said, not taking his eyes off the shelves.
Shaking his head, Draco fought against a smile. “It might help if you don’t appear out of nowhere,” Draco said, opening the book to find the page he was on.
Teddy thought about the offer and nodded. “Okay,” he said, his voice muffled as he covered his mouth to stifle a yawn. “But I’m not tired,” he repeated, making Harry smile.
“But not for Padfoot,” he assured. “We’ll be careful Cub, we promise, but we’re not going to ignore this, we’re your family – your Godparents, and we love you too much to pretend this isn’t happening.”
There were a few uncomfortable moments of silence where Potter looked lost in thought before he sighed with a small smile. “Bloody hell, I was beginning to think you’d
“Yeah,” Harry replied, with a humourless chuckle. “Sometimes I see Voldemort attacking people,” he shrugged. “Because I couldn’t stop hi-“
Draco opened the door and immediately folded his arms. “What time do you call this?” he asked, a smirk pulling at the corner of his lips.
“You know, if you ever need to talk,” Harry began, standing up to follow Malfoy down the astronomy tower.
“It means we have to be careful, and secretive,” Draco informed him, and Harry shrugged. “Although, I suppose you
Potter shifted awkwardly. “I said it would get personal.”
“She talked about this ex of hers, Graham, for two hours once, and how she should have married him instead of Reginald,” Draco replied, gesturing wildly at Harry as if that would get his point across better.
Draco felt the grin on his face widen. “I’m pretty sure he’ll be Gryffindor,” he said.
“I can’t be too sure, but with the way he was acting – Voldemort is involved, I know it.”
there’s an order you absolute Heathen!” Harry was glad he didn’t have a free hand to swat him over the head with.
“This Ladon guards something much more important,” the blond said, his tone serious. He leaned towards Harry. “He guards the cakes Daddy makes,” he whispered, glancing over his shoulder as if to check they hadn’t been overheard.
Harry felt his shoulders relax. Of course Draco had told them everything. It was the most likely conclusion, but he was still wary around the Slytherin duo.
Narcissa smiled at him softly. “Why don’t you go back to your room darling?” she suggested.
George shrugged. “Don’t look at me, I know nothing about their bets.”
“Do you
“Harry,” Draco interrupted, his voice soft but Harry knew he was smiling without even looking. “I’d love to,” he said. “I’d also really like to kiss you again, but there happens to be a lot of people around, so…”
Draco blinked, realising it was Harry, then blinked again. Hesitantly, he took the scarf. “Thanks,” he said, his voice barely beating the wind as he wrapped the scarf around his neck. It wasn’t particularly warm; Draco knew that meant Harry hadn’t been wearing it.
“This is a type of green tea called sencha. It is difficult to drink incorrectly,” Malfoy said, and Harry could see a smirk behind his eyes as he stopped himself from saying the insult that Harry knew was bubbling in his mind, probably at the hopes of not angering Harry. Harry wondered what the insult was. “You don’t add milk and I don’t recommend adding sugar, it gathers at the bottom of your cup.” Harry had no idea how anyone could drink unsweetened tea. “If you must sweeten it, then add honey,” he said, watching Harry’s expression with an amused glint in his eye.
“Just try telling my father that,” Draco said, as though he wished he could himself.
Harry didn’t know if he’d be able to, but he wanted to at least try, so he nodded.
“No spatial awareness,” Draco muttered, picking up his trunk. “
Harry was still staring at the fire when Malfoy arrived with the tea and cake; in fact, he didn’t even notice Malfoy arrive until he heard a soft clearing of the throat. “So, what is the
Harry nodded, understanding the connection Draco had to Samhain completely. He took a sip of the tea, which tasted of something Harry couldn’t place, warming his soul.
Draco pondered for a moment, glancing at the clock on the wall. “Anytime now actually,” he shrugged. “I’d better go get prepared,” he said, leaning forward to kiss Scorpius on the top of his head. “Is there anything you’d like mon cœur?” he asked.
He nodded, supressing a groan as Sirius’ smile widened. “It was so, weird,” he said, watching as Sirius nodded in understanding.
“We can meet on the train there if you’d like, I can look for you, tell you more about Hogwarts,” Draco offered, and Harry instantly perked up.
Draco hummed. “I’ve always spoken it,” he explained, stretching his arms in front of him before leaning his back against the sofa. “We were just always arguing,” he grinned, as Harry rolled his eyes. “I muttered a lot of my frustrations around you in French.”
“That’s great!” Draco grinned.
Harry shrugged. “You seemed rather distant after those first few months.”
wanted to read it,” he said sheepishly with a grin.
Nodding, Draco said, “I should get going too.”
“What?” Draco asked, wondering if Potter had confused him for someone else.
than him, I’m worried he’ll get upset, or worse, he won’t tell me he’s upset about it.”
Harry nodded, confused, but very amused.
“The Black’s had a long history of being in Slytherin, only to be shattered so easily,” Lucius sighed. Narcissa was sat on the other side of the parlour, and Draco wanted nothing more than to rush to her side for a hug. “I know you won’t let me down Draco,” he said, looking at Draco in what he assumed to be a blank stare, but he could never tell with his Father.
Draco nodded, silently appreciating Hannah’s respect for having his own way of coping. “I’ll be okay,” he said, watching her eyebrows knit together as she tilted her head, as if trying to discern whether he truly would be okay.
“Did I tell you about the first time I used the floo?” Harry asked, lugging Teddy’s trunk into the corridor. The lightening charm had worn off due to apparating; he’d take it up to Teddy’s room in a bit.
Turning to look at the door, Harry cleared his throat. “In a manner of speaking, I suppose I have
“Mother decided to visit the villa in Italy for business, or something,” Blaise grinned, using his hands for emphasis, waving them dismissively as he spoke of his mother’s career. “That means I spent the
“He’s got Remus to stop him from doing anything rash but, he’s still only one wizard.”
“Sirius Black,” he said, watching as his reflection vanished as it does when you throw a stone at a still puddle. It rippled until a different view came into focus. “Sirius?” he called out, assuming his shard was on a table.
He had tried, but Delphinus would disappear for a few hours, and return with the letter still tied to her ankle every time. He only tried three times before deciding it was only tiring Delphinus out.
Harry couldn’t figure out how Scorpius could remember so much about dragons. When he was eight, Harry could have never sat and read a book. ‘Maybe that’s because Dudley’s gang wouldn’t let me,’ he thought, sighing internally.
he muttered, as Harry couldn’t help but laugh. “Besides, when you want to face reality, I’ll still be here for you,” he said, glancing at Harry in the corner of his eye.
“Well then,” Harry said. “It would be an honour,” he said dramatically, grinning.
“Draco,” Pansy said, as if she had been calling his name for a while. “We’ll figure something out, there must be… something…” she trailed off, glancing at Blaise who was shaking his head, clearly thinking Draco couldn’t see.

“Master Sirius is not home; he is out sir.” Every word Kreacher spoke made Harry feel sick with dread.
MUSIC
He talked about his mysterious new friend, Harry. He had been forbidden by his mother from mentioning Harry inside the Manor, and of mentioning Harry to his father. Draco had felt his excitement dwindle when she told him that. “I know Father doesn’t really understand anything Muggle, and Harry is probably Muggleborn, but I don’t get why we can’t be friends,” he sighed. One of the peacocks tilted its head, pushing at Draco’s hand. “I’ve got Pansy and Blaise I suppose, but we’ve been friends since we were
“It’s nice to meet you Scorpius, and you can call me Harry,” he grinned, looking up at Draco. “Same goes to you too by the way,” Harry said, making Draco shrug with a smile.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. “You do?” he asked, his eyes quickly darting to Scorpius as he squealed but he quickly brought his focus back to Harry when he saw it was only because the stag shook his head. “Why?”
“And I take it back,” Draco shrugged.
He sat down on the floor and patted the space in front of him, smiling at Harry.
Andromeda chuckled. “Electricity is similar to fire or a

. “Master Draco,” Kreacher bowed, looking rather bored.
“Oh, don’t worry about it, it’s an exchange,” said Harry, as if taking any money would be counted as stealing.
The only time Malfoy made any acknowledgement of his existence was when he was surrounded by other Slytherins, but even then, it was only a snarky look in his general direction. Harry was getting to the stage where he was considering consulting Ron on the matter, but he couldn’t see that conversation ending well – ‘
“Then can I visit Auntie Andromeda in the Muggle worl-“

talking about it, had never stayed in his mind long enough for him to plan a speech about it.
“You sound like Pansy,” Draco said absentmindedly with a sigh.
Harry snorted. “Maybe.”
Blacks and doesn’t have to tell the truth to those he’s not loyal to.”
He expected Hermione, or Ron to come after him any minute and he wasn’t sure he could face either of them, so he just kept walking, wanting nothing more than to get as far from the Potions classroom as he could. He hadn’t told anyone the truth of his home life with the Dursley’s, although Ron and Hermione probably had speculations. It wasn’t as if he had tried to hide it, but no one had ever brought it up in conversation and with the onset of an actual war, it seemed like a trivial matter. He knew that if he mentioned it, Sirius would help him out and make sure he never had to return to the Dursley household, but he also knew that Sirius would head over to the Dursley’s house to ‘
“Rose Bud, eleven inches, unicorn hair,” he said, passing the wand to Draco and as soon as Draco held the wand, it jerked out his hand and back into the box, stunning both of the men. “That’s an

It wasn’t bad to begin with, Harry found the training to be rather enjoyable, and the fact that Ron joined with him,
“I’d happily eat two,” Draco said, as he looked at the cinnamon buns behind the stall counter. It was then that Evelyn seemed to actual notice Draco.
He wasn’t sure why it was only just settling in – the reality of his situation. He had a month at his aunt’s house, but perhaps then it felt like a dream.
Harry bolted upright. “Will you go?” he asked. It was after all the safest option. He didn’t like the idea of Draco leaving the country to spend Merlin knows how long away from him, but it would be safe – and far away from Lucius and Voldemort.
Crumpling the letters in one hand, he stared at the floor, feeling a swell of anger, sadness and numbness.

“Because you’re
Harry, be careful,” he said, shaking his head. “How you survived this long without me I’ll never know,” he muttered, and Harry rolled his eyes.
,” Ron exclaimed. “You git, how come you didn’t tell us?”
Before Harry could tell Sirius how bad an idea that was, Remus began to speak. “Sirius, is that really a good idea with Umbridge watching the school?” he reasoned. Sirius slumped into his chair.
“They all were, Sirius, my Dad, Pettigrew,” Harry continued. “To help Remus with his monthly transformations. My Dad’s Animagus form was a stag,” he said, smiling at the whisps of smoke and Scorpius’ laughter. “Sometimes, it feels as though it’s a part of my Dad, the Patronus, and he’s still trying as best he can to protect me.”
“A few months,” he muttered, unable to look Andromeda in the eye. “I didn’t know you were in contact with him,” Harry said, certain Draco had mentioned that they
“I say I’m thinking about it, but I’ve signed all the paperwork, I just have to hand it in,” Harry interrupted, letting her know he was being genuine. “My boss has never looked so relieved,” he chuckled.
Eventually, the conversation drifted from Harry’s neglect (much to Harry’s relief) and to their O.W.L’s.
Harry could not stop thinking about Malfoy.
Harry stumbled, nearly falling to the floor as Rose tackled him into a hug, jumping into his arms. “Careful Rosie, you’ll send us both to the floor,” he joked, setting her safely onto the ground again.
“Not really a void,” Draco tried to explain, but it was more of a feeling than actual magical theory. “It’s as if it wants you to stay, but has no charm, so it pulls you in, like how Muggle magnets attract other magnets,” he said, hoping that would explain it. “It feels like a rope being tied around my magical core.”
Draco nodded, sniffling as she wipes the few tears from his face. “I understand,” he mumbled.
“But I can’t,” Harry said, squeezing his hands into fists. “I’m at the top of Voldemort’s kill list.”
leave her there,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper, but it still felt too loud.
They reached the door that lead into the corridor and stopped. “I think your ego can take an elbow to the stomach,” Harry said, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“I’ve tried!” Harry groaned. “He’s always surrounded by other Slytherins and he’s never alone,” he said, remembering all the times he’d searched for him in the corridors and on the Marauder’s Map.
“I won’t go Cub, if that’ll keep you at Hogwarts,” Sirius sighed reluctantly.
“And I feel like going brunet wouldn’t suit me.”
Teddy laughed, appearing to try his best not to, flapping his arms at Harry to get him to stop. “’Course it’s still okay,” Teddy grinned, running a hand through his hair. “We’ll still see Grandma though, right?” he asked, quickly.
, flew to Hogwarts in a
“Can’t get rid of me that easily I’m afraid,” Harry chuckled. “So what’s the surprise tea today?”
The spirit of autumn was hard to miss as he walked into Draco’s teashop. The window displayed an array of pumpkins and tree branches, charmed to stay orange and red, and not to turn brown. The shop still smelt of apples and cardamom, but also there was a faint smell he couldn’t recognise.
“Two please,” Harry asked Evelyn, the lady behind the stall, as Draco stood to one side.
As they arrived at the castle, Draco noticed Harry across the docks and waved at him with a smile. Harry waved back and Ron noticed Draco too, sending him a friendly nod.
have people decided to believe about the tournament today?”
stumble out of there Potter?” Draco asked with a smirk and Harry chuckled at the comment.
He had barely managed to sit down at the kitchen table when there was a soft tapping at the window. It was Andromeda’s reply, which was a lot quicker than Harry was expecting. It was possible that she had received a letter too and felt rather lonely.
Harry placed a hand on Malfoy’s shoulder. “You’re not that bad Malfoy.”
Sirius grinned. “Should have seen him when he arrived the other day, he got in a shouting match with dear old Mum for about an hour, it was impressive,” Sirius admitted. “No one wanted to stop him.”
Andromeda nodded. “The same.”
“Don’t worry,” Harry said, nudging Draco’s knee with his own. “I’ll make sure you don’t get too lost,” he grinned, and Draco smiled back.

so surprised,” he said, sounding the complete opposite of surprised.
Scorpius offered Teddy a toothy grin, bouncing about. “My name is Scorpius,” he said. “Have you ever met a dragon?” he asked, his tone serious.

True to his word, Harry really did visit more. He visited every Wednesday as that was his day off, and on Saturday evenings. Harry was happy he had stayed true to his word and felt immense joy at watching Teddy grow. Andromeda would send him knowing smiles and glances whenever he interacted with Teddy, as Harry always left his weekly meetups with a brighter smile than when he arrived.
He couldn’t stop giggling.
“Unlike
It took Draco a moment to process what Harry had said, but when he did, his face turned a light shade of pink. “Oh,” he whispered, smiling at Harry. “Ok.”
“That’ll be why I never knew I suppose,” Harry said, joining Draco in leaning against the sofa. “I was never close enough to hear you speak it,” he said, closing his eyes and listening to Draco’s soft chuckle.
Ron and Hermione exchanged worried glances, and Harry knew they wouldn’t leave it alone, but he was not in the mood or the right mindset to explain the faults in his childhood, and his mind was preoccupied with a kiss he had just had with a certain blond.
When Harry nodded, Draco felt his heart skip a beat as his face went pink. “It was stupid, actually, nevermi-“
Draco sighed, the corners of his mouth twitching upwards. “I can’t deny that I enjoy it Potter.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow, leaning against one of the desks. “Your point?”
With Scorpius on his shoulders, Draco made his way through the crowded Diagon Alley. Scorpius was talking about what he read about dragons at his grandmothers and Draco couldn’t help but smile at the excitement in his son’s voice as he spoke.
Which meant Harry could live with them and maybe even be adopted by Sirius.
Then, Professor McGonagall returned, a piece of parchment in her hand, and escorted them into the hall, where everyone fell silent.
“Oh,” Hermione said, her expression neutral. “Is this about -?”
,” Pansy chuckled, and Zabini raised an eyebrow, amused. “Let’s do it.”
“So, I should ask him on a date? Is what you’re saying?” Harry asked, placing his finished teacup on the table.
With a sigh, Draco decided to be blunt with it. “She died five years ago.”
“Draco’s been, brighter, recently,” Zabini said, glancing at Harry, as if he was trying to figure him out. “No doubt because of
“You’re a true surprise Harry Potter,” Draco said, shaking his head. “Almost a Slytherin, almost a baker, what else were you almost?” he joked, as they reached a bench, which would have been hidden in the trees were it not the start of December.
“How -?”
Harry frowned again.
Harry watched the two interact with a small smile. “So that’s what that means,” he said, after a moment of realisation.
-----
“Maybe you’re nervous,” Harry muttered. It was a childish response, he knew that, but was all that came to mind.
“You’re too posh sounding for swear words,” Harry mumbled, biting back a grin when Draco flicked his ear. “Git,” he muttered, smiling at Draco, in a way that made his heart skip a beat. Harry glanced at the others in the kitchen and noticed they had begun their own conversation. With a sigh that told Draco he was used to it, Harry lightly tugged at Draco’s fingers. “They’ll be talking for a while, follow me,” he said, guiding Draco into the corridor.
Pulling him from his thoughts, Potter stumbled backwards out of the trees. He was as graceful as Draco remembered him to be. Draco was shocked to see that Potter didn’t look that different from when they were seventeen, just older. His emerald eyes lacked the child-like wonder they used have but still held a fiery warmth. His hair a mess of curls, untameable by the strongest of magic, he suspected. His glasses were slightly crooked from his stumbling and his scar was only partially hidden, but his smile seemed to be more effortless than it was in Hogwarts, as if being happier was easier. “Sorry for the wait there,” he said, dusting off his robes. “How can I –
The blond nodded. “The Parkinson’s are one of the few neutral pureblood families. They refuse to get involved on either side, but they’re willing to overlook that for one summer – they rather like to idea of Pansy and I getting married one day I think,” Draco shook his head, looking completely disgusted by the idea. “
Harry didn’t know what possessed him to do it, but he placed his head on Draco’s shoulder, closing what little distance they still had between them. He closed his eyes and smiled, feeling the calmest he had for a while. He inhaled deeply, and could faintly smell lemons and cinnamon.
“I suppose that will do,” Harry said solemnly, chuckling when Draco raised an eyebrow.
“Yes, you do bring me hot chocolate,” Draco said, smiling at Harry. “And I appreciate your efforts immensely.”
Teddy rolled his eyes. “She would not,” he said, and Harry was about to raise an eyebrow when Teddy continued to speak. “Far too messy to skin you alive.”
“Blaise, at
“Don’t worry Auntie Pansy, I’ll make sure he’s smart,” he whispered back as Draco rolled his eyes.
Pouring himself a cup, Harry tried to drink it unsweetened, as Malfoy unsubtly told him he should, but after one sip, he knew he needed to add the honey. Unsweetened, it tasted earthy, and bitter, but after a little bit of honey, it tasted wonderful. It was still earthy and slightly nutty, but it wasn’t bitter.
“No! I just – I’ll be less likely to destroy
It pushed its way into his hair, dragging it out of his face and forcing it to stand on end. He took a deep breath, the cold air filling his lungs and making him shiver. Draco hadn’t taken a scarf, and the best he could do to keep warm was wrap his cloak further around himself.
The dam broke.
This cleared nothing up in Draco’s mind. “Who?” he asked.
It was fascinating to learn about magic in all its forms. His mother had explained to him as a child that magic is simply magic, and the only evil surrounding it is those who wield it – with the exception of certain magic which quite literally eats at your soul.
Potter stared at Draco, in curiosity or disgust, he couldn’t tell, but he tried not to blush as he felt the raven-haired man bore holes in the side of his skull with his eyes.
can,” he pointed out. “I’m guessing you won’t be going to any classes today?” he asked, his eyes searching Harry’s.
“I want to help,” Draco replied, wondering where Cedric was going with this.
Draco nodded. “Upset they didn’t ask for your autograph Potter?” he teased, making Harry roll his eyes.
, but they think ignoring it will, I don’t know, help?” Draco heard him sigh again. “But you haven’t ignored it, or dismissed it, and I’ve
“Will you be back tomorrow?” Potter asked as he opened the jars on top of the fireplace, looking for the floo powder.
“I’ll keep you the safest,” Harry retorted, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“We should go before
“Git,” Harry mumbled.
He had been proud of himself for making a friend without his father’s influence.
of me to do that, all things considering.”
Hermione remained silent.
“Bye-bye Harry, it was nice to meet you!” Scorpius said cheerfully with a wave, holding his dad’s hand as they got ready to leave the shop.
He would be explaining something to a gaggle of second years and Draco would finally know this was a terrible, waking nightmare.
“Will you stop asking if I’m all right!” he snapped, and Hermione flinched at the volume of his voice.
of an oversight by me,” he said, only widening Harry’s grin. “Well, why don’t we just say I won?” he said, waving his hand dismissively, and going to stand.

Draco frowned, “I’m not, I feel normal,” he sighed. “Perhaps it’s the move, maybe I just need to sleep it off.”

“Dad always tells me I’m the brightest étoile,” Scorpius boasted, smiling proudly.
“Perhaps not in those words, but he didn’t need to say it all,” she grinned. “An old woman sees things you know.”

“That’s what…?” Sirius began, his expression darkening as Remus nodded. “Fuck,” he muttered. “That’s messed up,
“Hey Pads, it’s only me,” he heard Remus call out.
Then, the guilt of laughing crept up his spine and took residence in his stomach, and he sighed. Harry laid down in the dirt, and Draco joined him. “Will you write to me this summer?” Harry asked.
“Draco –“ Harry began.
“Are you really upset over philosophical dread?” Draco returned, raising an eyebrow.
Harry, however, did not seem to notice the abnormal volume at which Draco just spoke and waved at Draco. “Hello, hope I’m not late,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck.
“So why -"

Harry tilted his head. “Because it’s the Slytherin house colour?”
“Merlin, it’s bloody cold,” Ron complained as the trio made their way into the dungeon to the Potions classroom. “I’m glad we only have Potions down here,” he said, rubbing his hands together to keep warm.
“I’m not sure,” Andromeda said. “Walburga and Orion,” she began, pausing before she spoke. “They were
However, he also knew that Teddy was going to be the same type of Hufflepuff as his mother had been, and briefly debated sending a warning letter to McGonagall, especially since Harry had sent Teddy to Hogwarts with the Marauder’s Map, and his invisibility cloak.
“Clearly you don’t know anyone as creative as me,” Malfoy smirked.
“Is there anyone you want to tell?” Harry asked. It wasn’t much of an issue for him. Besides the idea of coming out to the Prophet, he didn’t mind who knew about Draco and him.
Draco stared at the water, the sound fading as the blood rushed to his head, pounding in his ears like a drumbeat. He tried to focus his thoughts on the water; he tried to focus on his surroundings.
Potter raised an eyebrow, clearly expecting some sort of witty remark back. He shrugged, “it’s alright, I’ve been wondering when you’d decide to get your wand checked. I assume that’s why you’re here?” he asked, waiting for a reply.
“The where now?” Draco asked, and Harry rolled his eyes.
“Thanks, hadn’t figured that out yet,” Harry said, and Sirius ignored the comment, continuing.
“That’s amazing!” Harry exclaimed, as George left to go find Angelina. “How’s the progress on Werewolf Rights going?” he asked, knowing being the Head of the department would certainly help.
He couldn’t remember falling asleep, and he hoped Harry hadn’t been expecting Draco to wake him.
“I’d say we can be pretty certain he’s gone,” Ted joked, but Draco felt uneasy.
Heart in hand, Harry reached out for Draco’s, intertwining their fingers as the winter sun prompted him to smile at the other man. Unable to contain himself, Harry pulled out the book that he had picked in the bookshop. “I got this book for you,” he said, his fingers brushing imaginary dust off the cover. “I read the summary on the back and thought you’d like it.”
“I think, about sixty-eight years?” he said, unsure. “The benefits of a magical lifespan I suppose,” Draco shrugged, sipping his tea again.
Andromeda laughed at his impression. “That was a little bit of it, I suppose,” she said, collecting herself. “He also mentioned how much he admires you, the way you handle Scorpius with such care and support, how you’ve never once asked questions you know would make him uncomfortable, despite the burning need to know,” she said, her eyes never leaving Harry.
They sat in silence for a moment, when the conversation with Andromeda pushed its way to the front of Draco’s mind. “Can I – is it okay if I ask you something?” he asked, peeking at Sirius over the top of his book.

“Harry, thank
“I will,” Draco smiled, pulling Harry’s hand up to his lips. “Can you handle carrying teapots to tables without dropping anything?” he teased.
for reading through my Potions essay, but now...” His grin grew when he saw Draco's face become still and his hand paused for a moment.
“Why is she telling me to rest?” Harry asked Ron, who was just as confused as he was.
“I bet you’re
Harry looked at Sirius, who was deathly still. In fact, if it weren’t for the fact that he was blinking, Harry would have thought he was dead. Then, his eyes moved over to Remus, who had gone very pale and his grip on Sirius’ shoulder had tightened.
Shaking his head, Lupin cast his eyes to the floor. “It isn’t pleasant, to say the least,” he sighed, and Andromeda placed her hand over his.
“I still rather like the idea of dying my hair a pastel green,” Malfoy admitted. Harry stared at Malfoy, who glared at Harry when he noticed.
“That would be you, Scarhead.”
He wanted to curl up by one of the fireplaces, but the common room wasn’t empty yet, as older students caught up on the summer escapades of their housemates. Therefore, he decided to take to one of the window seats on the balcony, hugging his knees and trying to see what constellations he could find.
was included on that list.
It was then that Harry realised he hadn’t thought this conversation through. The idea of talking about his life with the Dursleys,
“If you had been here,” Pansy muttered as Blaise handed him a pasty.
“Hi Harry!” Scorpius enthused, before he lifted Ladon to his ear. “Ladon says hello too,” he nodded, pushing the dragon towards Harry. “He says that he missed you,” Scorpius added, his eyes on Harry as he grinned a toothy grin.
“I was just about to take them out of the oven mon cœur,” Draco smiled, brushing his son’s hair from his eyes. “They’ll have to cool before we can eat them, so why don’t you take Harry into the lounge and show him what your Dragon can do?” he encouraged, looking at Harry as if asking him to ask Scorpius himself.
Sirius grinned and looked as if he were about to burst, interrupting Remus to explain that this meant that the Minister was reconsidering his case, and that Tonks, Shacklebolt and Remus had managed to get him a trial.
“Oh, it’s nothing,” she said with a small blush on her cheeks.
When they approached the gate that lead into Hogsmeade and Remus came into view, Harry’s grip on Draco’s hand tightened.
,” he replied, trying his best to act as if he hadn’t noticed.
He coughed. “Not that I need to be thanked, but what would my thanks have been? In curiosity of course,” Draco said, nonchalantly, flipping the parchment Harry’s essay was on.
“Yes,” he said softly. “I mean, Voldemort wants me dead anyway, why not at least tell me the plan,” he frowned, staring at his hands.
acceptable amount,” Harry muttered. “Besides, you used to do exactly the same,” Harry grinned as Malfoy scoffed.
“I – Snuffles is meeting me in Hogsmeade on Saturday,” he said, deflecting from Hermione’s point about sneaking off.
After a few moments of silence, Scorpius said, “I like Harry, he’s nice.”
“But we can’t hold it against them if they don’t know something,” Draco said, nodding in confidence and smiling at one of the ghosts, who he assumed to be the Fat Friar as he was saying something about Hufflepuff.

“I did,” Teddy grinned. “Can I push the trolly?” he asked, giving Harry puppy-dog eyes.
is,” Harry explained, running his hand through his hair instinctively. He knew that if Malfoy was the one who was searching for him, Ron and Hermione had been forced to stay in the classroom, and with everyone else in classes, Malfoy was the only person keeping him from quite literally blowing up the classroom he was in.
“I know, I’m sorry.”
Ted sipped his tea, glancing at the door. “He believes that you’re not safe here.”
Draco raised an eyebrow but didn’t question why – Harry knew a lot more on the subject than Draco did, obviously.
“Moony’s right, you’re not going back.” Sirius’ eyes lit up with a fiery determination. “Nothing, and I mean nothing, ever excuses letting a child grow up in an abusive household Cub,” Sirius said, his eyes staying fixed on Harry’s.
The two sat, watching the park and the people passing by, almost in perfect silence. The joy that filled Harry’s body and the comfort brought by simply being next to Draco was almost immeasurable and Harry hoped Draco felt the same about him.
“That’s not entirely impossible,” Sirius said, leaning back in his chair. “And you said you’d both drank some Befuddlement Draught?” he asked, and when Harry nodded, he added, “so it wasn’t something he intended to tell you, but it
, something is wrong.” Pansy stood still in the middle of Draco’s apartment, looking impatiently at him, waiting for an answer.
Draco paused for a moment, considering the question. “I suppose not,” he chuckled, stopping in front of the section with a sign saying, ‘
“Perhaps we could – Ginny!” Ron exclaimed as he noticed Ginny, Luna and Neville engaged in conversation, sat on the ledge in front of one of the windows in the corridor. “She still has some of Fred and George’s fireworks, she never leaves the common room without them,” Ron explained, upon seeing Harry and Hermione’s befuddled expressions, running up to his sister.
“Harry!” Scorpius exclaimed as he opened the door. “You’re here!” He grabbed Harry’s hand and dragged him inside.
“Oh, you poor thing, these exams can be rather intense,” she replied, her gaze full of pity. “You can leave if you’ve finished, I recommend a rather long nap, and perhaps a trip to the hospital wing for a calming draught” she smiled, and Harry did not hesitate in leaving, grabbing his bag on the way.
“I’ll keep you safe,” Harry said, determined.
spending the holidays with you?” His voice was soft, as if he would wake himself up if he spoke too loudly. He glanced up at Harry who nodded.
“You don’t speak to us anymore Harry,” Hermione said bluntly. “You sneak off every chance you get to
As the whistle blew on the kettle, the fireplace roared into life; green flames swirling and twisting up the chimney as Andromeda stepped from within the fire into the kitchen. “Harry dear?” she called out, using her wand to remove the soot from her robes.
The sound of feet on the stairs caught Harry’s attention, and he glanced over to see Draco, who was wearing a brown turtleneck and jeans. It was odd to see Draco looking so incredibly Muggle.
“It’s similar to a moving portrait or photograph,” Andromeda explained, and even Narcissa was intrigued by this. “Except you can’t interact with it and it’s sort of like a box.”
to be here,” Harry mumbled. “In fact, I still don’t really understand why you are here,” he said sceptically.
“Your parents wouldn’t want you to grief their death every year, but remembering it is different to grieving it,” Draco said, lacing his hand with Harry’s.
Blaise simply smirked. “If I die for telling the truth then,
The door to the living room creaked open slightly, and Draco waltzed in, looking particularly smug. Harry was mildly amused when the dragon almost collided with his head. “Why thank you Potter,” Draco smirked, joining them on the floor. “It’s good to see you can finally admit to my superior skills,” he joked, and Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry hadn’t thought much about whether what he had seen was true just like he hadn’t thought much about a plan; he knew he had to get to the Ministry. Harry certainly hadn’t considered Draco’s warning about links and prophecies and Kreacher.
Draco nodded. “You’re right, I do,” he said, with a smile. “Pansy rarely recommends me a book, but she hasn’t had a single bad recommended yet,” Draco said, his eyes flickering across the shelves as he glanced for the book. “It’s most likely in the classic books section, but…” he said, trailing off as his eyes once more glanced over the shelves.
He glanced at his reflection, his hair sticking up at odd angles and his eyes red rimmed. His limbs felt foreign to him and he wasn’t sure why he was looking at himself.
“And they’ve never gotten physical?” Sirius asked, looking ready for murder.
Malfoy looked at him as if the answer were obvious. “Hex me, why else?”
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle. “I’ll be sure to try it,” he promised, unable to say anything else to this boy as his grin widened.
“Draco,” he called out, pretending to have noticed something on one of the bookcases.
Harry laughed, leaning into Draco. “I did,” he said, with a smile of an old man fondly looking back on his life, not a fifteen year old condoning it.
“It may or may not be Draco Malfoy,” he said quietly, preparing for the worst.
Departing from the little gate, they made their way to the cave that Sirius used to live in whilst he was on the run – although it had since been emptied of any clues that someone used to live there. The trek was almost unbearable for Harry, despite Draco’s silent comfort at his side. Padfoot was running up ahead, with Remus closely behind, but Harry and Draco lagged behind.
“Nervous?” Draco asked, and Harry paused, unsure of what he felt.
“Wasn’t there a book you wanted to read?” Harry asked, leaning back a little, smiling softly. “The –
As per usual, the two spent the day talking, with Draco disappearing periodically to check on his customers and deal with those who had just walked in. Harry got lost in the moment, forgetting the time entirely until he glanced up and saw it was almost pitch-black outside. This was becoming an incredibly common occurrence; it was difficult for Harry to focus on anything other than the slight features of Draco’s face and the grace with which he moved, even when he was darting from customer to customer.
He was trying to ignore it, but it wouldn’t let him; it was knocking on the door of his mind like an unwanted guest to a party. It clawed at the underside of his skin and it scratched at his eyes.
Harry chuckled, leaning towards Draco as well. “Hermione says it’s why people find me attractive,” he said, flashing a grin at Draco.
Harry shook his head. “Nothing,” he grinned.
Andromeda nodded. “As frequently as I can,” she promised, and Draco tackled his aunt in a hug, as best he could when they were both on a sofa.
Malfoy’s eyes went dark and his body tensed. “No Potter, and if you’ve come to accuse me of –“
“You’re a prick Potter,” Malfoy deadpanned, standing up.
“One,” Harry replied with a soft smile as Teddy did a small victory dance and picked up the largest chocolate bar, placing it in the trolly. “Sirius told me that Remus had a go at them all because it was only supposed to be going back by five minutes each night, but instead Sirius and my Dad moved it by four hours.”
“Wow, now I can die happy,” Draco muttered, his voice filled with sarcasm. “Harry Potter told me I’m a good seeker.”
Neither of them said anything for a moment, they just stared at each other, trying to figure out the others’ motives.
“OK, just listen to my voice OK? Breathe in,” Draco said softly. “And out.”
visit him,” Sirius replied.
Teddy grinned. “I know,” he said, refusing to elaborate further.
“He has Sirius,” Harry responded, and Ron’s eyes popped out of their sockets as Hermione pursed her lips.
Except Cedric, who was starting to look more concerned each time he saw Draco. He knew it was probably because Pansy and Blaise had expressed their own concerns, but he just wanted to be left alone.
“Why am I not surprised,” Draco replied with a chuckle, making Harry smile.
Harry, the shapes,” he added with a solemn sigh.
said that’s ridiculous,” Teddy said, and Harry nodded along, trying his best not to laugh at the story. The streets they were walking down were rather quiet, and the sky was a pale grey, but neither of them seemed to mind as it had been so long since they had seen each other.
With a sharp nod, Malfoy glanced back at Scorpius, his cheeks rosier than before. He sighed in relief when Scorpius beckoned him over to the ducks.
The inside of the shop was just as welcoming as the outside. Each table had a glass vase filled with varying bunches of flowers. Some had roses, others had lilies, and some had what Harry assumed to be wildflowers. Harry smiled when he saw that the table in front of him had lilies.
Nodding, Draco rubbed the back of his neck. “I went from being surrounded by the idea of war – death – and then to trying to figure out how Muggle money works,” he shrugged, laughing nervously. “
“I understand the feeling,” he muttered, his hand brushing over Harry’s, who felt a tingle pass through his entire arm, like static.
The silent Howler’s were somehow worse than his father’s written letter expressing his disappointment, merely a few days after his sorting. He was constantly preparing for the time when the Howler would be real, when it would
“I thought Hufflepuff’s were supposed to be friendly?” Harry retorted, making Draco burst into laughter.
“It’s been a while since we last spoke,” Andromeda said, as they wandered into the living room. Harry passed her the cup of tea. “We might have a lot to talk about,” she said, a small smirk pulling at the corner of her mouth as they sat down.
and death. He placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “I think I understand,” he said, smiling sheepishly when Harry raised an eyebrow at him. “In their own way, I think people want to let you live a happier life than one of war,” he explained.
The main point was he’d realised he needed to quit.
His aunt gave him a look that he couldn’t quite discern, sighing. “How are you?”
“I’d like the Queen of Hearts, if you would be so kind,” Draco grinned, now the proud owner of three cards.
“You try being friends with Pansy and not know how to punch,” Draco joked.
They were all too close to Draco for his liking.
“On the contrary,” Andromeda said, a small smirk gracing her lips. “I think he might see a lot of himself in you,” she smiled, reaching out a hand to cup his face. “But no one can tell you how you
–“ Draco began, unable to find the words to describe his reasoning. “Harry,” he said, grasping Harry’s shoulder. “
Stepping closer to Draco, Harry bumped their shoulders together. “Don’t worry, I’ll protect you,” he grinned, biting back a laugh as Draco looked mortified.
“Can’t blame you really,” he said.
Despite the snow, Harry wished he could fly around on his firebolt, but as it was under lock and key, that wasn’t possible. He didn’t regret punching Cassius Warrington (in fact, he hoped he had broken Warrington’s nose), and he knew Fred and George didn’t either, but that didn’t mean he didn’t want to play Quidditch. Flying had always been a way to calm his nerves or clear his head, and now he had this insatiable, burning itch in the back of his mind. He wanted to hear the whistle of the wind, feel the tingling sting on his face as he raced through the sky.
concalesco - latin for to become warm/ flush
He wasn’t sure when he knew for certain that he’d quit. Perhaps it was related to Draco and Scorpius or maybe it was because Teddy was at Hogwarts and he wanted to spend more time with his Godchild.
Harry’s eyes widened as he tripped over his words for a response, running his hand through his hair. “Hex you? Why would I –?” he looked at Malfoy who shrugged before he continued. “You ambushed me in a classroom I had half destroyed,
“And I you, Scarhead.”
“So you never have to go back there,” Sirius said, as if it was obvious.
“Salazar, you’re so
“’Dromeda!” Draco heard a man, who he assumed to be Sirius, yell, as they apparated into a dreary corridor. The man tackled his aunt into a hug. Andromeda laughed harder than Draco had ever seen her laugh before.
He really tried not to think about Malfoy’s sky-blue hair and his warm smile and his carefree laughter and the way he softened when talking to or about his son – Harry tried

“I like him too ma petite étoile,” he said, playing with Scorpius’ hair to soothe him. “And I hope we get to see Harry a lot.”
Harry felt his heart skip a beat.
“If it’s from Parkinson it doesn’t count,” Harry said without any emotion, laughing internally as Draco struggled to say anyone else has called him pleasant.
“He is,” he said quietly, before shaking his head. “How did you find the tea?” Malfoy asked, nodding at the teacup.
“Oi!” Harry exclaimed, supressing a laugh. “Don’t offend flobberworms like that,” he said, and Draco quirked an eyebrow, amused.
Ron nodded. “Speaking of idiots, did I tell you about this prat who came into the store the other day?” he asked, only just remembering, and Harry shook his head.
Ron gave him a funny look, as if Harry had something on his head. Harry instinctively ran his hand through his hair, just in case. “Well, I’ll see you on Sunday then yeah?”
, please call me Sirius, we’re cousins after all,” he shivered, outstretching a hand to Draco who gingerly accepted the hand. Harry fought off another eye roll.
,” Harry groaned, knowing Draco would never let Harry buy the books for him.
He had no idea who to talk to; a part of him felt as if he
Harry had to admit, it was a rather beautiful version of the book. It was a small copy, a size that would fit in a rather large pocket. There was gold lettering etched into the leather cover and a pattern stitched into the leather too, in white and orange thread. The intricate swirls and twirls surrounded the gold lettering and, mixed with the added factor of it being pocket sized – Harry could see the appeal.
“Why?” Cedric asked.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Yes Potter, that is indeed what I said,” he drawled with a smirk. “You just drink it as it is.”
Harry sipped his tea. “What a strange coincidence,” he said, pretending to be clueless.
“That only happens around you love,” Harry said, which was partially true. It did happen more around Draco.
“You broke his nose by the way,” Draco said. “I don’t know if anyone told you.”
“I only told him to
The Black Manor was, also, a house of many mysteries. The first mystery was how it was concealed so perfectly from the sight of all beings, magical or not – Draco hadn’t been able to ask yet. The second, was how Draco had been unable to find the kitchen an hour ago but was now able to run there in less than ten seconds.
“Who else will I learn the complexities of tea from?” Harry shrugged, trying his best to look nonchalant.
Malfoy shrugged, a smirk pulling at his lips. “Forgive a man for hoping that meant he wouldn’t see you until next week,” he said, waving a hand dismissively as he stood straight once more.
The boy smiled and Draco was so surprised he almost fell over. “I think I know what house you’ll be in,” he said with confidence.
“Merlin, he’d be
“Hm, I wouldn’t say he hates you, per say,” Draco said, shrugging, still running his fingers through Harry’s hair. “He,” Draco paused.
something he wanted to.”
As he reached the kitchen, he saw that there were only a few people there to greet Harry and Mr Weasley: Sirius, Lupin and Mrs Weasley. Draco wondered where Hermione and Ron were, but then he remembered what Harry had said in his letters and wondered if Harry had told them to stay away. “Harry,” Draco grinned, as he pushed the door.
Andromeda nodded. “I’m not the best person to ask about this Draco,” she admitted. “Whilst we have both been disowned, the circumstances were substantially different,” she explained, and Draco nodded slowly.
,’ not ‘
He needed to get to the Ministry, but how could he get there? He could fly, but that would take too long, he needed to get there as quickly as possible. He didn’t trust the floo systems in the Gryffindor common room, not since Sirius’ call got interrupted, but perhaps the fireplace in Umbridge’s office would take him to the Ministry without killing him or alerting anyone.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Harry, if you don’t join us tomorrow, I will floo to your home and drag you over myself.” Harry opened his mouth to respond but Draco continued. “I know you’ll only mope about for the day so you really should at least consider it. You

It took Harry a moment to realise Draco had said Voldemort and not
, that might help,” Teddy muttered, still clinging to Harry.
Malfoy’s smirk fell into a frown. “What are you smiling at?” he asked.
“I’m going to need you to take some deep breaths, do you think you can do that?” Draco asked, his voice calm and pleasant.
“Yeah sure,” Harry interrupted, still blushing from the compliment on his shop. “I’ll be back in a moment,” he said, dashing back into the trees and disappearing from sight. Draco bit back a laugh at Harry’s behaviour.
Potter smirked and answered his question, “have you ever owned any other wands?”
He pulled the Mirror shard from the bottom of his trunk and called to Sirius, releasing a breath he didn’t know he was holding when Sirius picked up his end of the mirror, hearing Sirius fumble to grasp the mirror and trip over something, creating a loud
“With your pettiness?” Harry chuckled, shaking his head. There was a softness to what he was saying that made Draco’s heart swell like the sound of a string section of an orchestra. “Did Ted show you how to play rummy?” he asked.
Whilst Draco was glad for the emptiness in the corridors, the quiet left a lot to be desired. It allowed for the echoes of his shoes on the stone floor, to mimic the deafening reverberations of his thoughts against his skull.
I’m glad it was you they sent,” she said, sighing in relief.
Draco passed Harry the books he was currently holding, muttering about how disappointed he was in the staff of the shop. “First of all,” he said, picking up one of the books in the middle. “You’d have thought that perhaps they had ordered them by their publication date, but apparently not,” he said, frowning as he pushed the rest of the books to one side. “It’s not the correct order, but it is an order,” he said to Harry, who nodded.
hard.
“You’re getting better at that ma petite étoile,” Draco said softly, kissing Scorpius’ temple.
“So, I’m related to your Godchild?” Scorpius asked, clearly imitating someone he knew, and Harry was unsure who.
When they arrived back at Grimmauld Place, they unpacked the shopping as Teddy continued to speak about the parts of Hogwarts he didn’t write about. “A few people asked what it’s like to have you as a Dad,” Teddy said, and Harry felt his heart jump to his throat. “Because you’re the saviour,” he explained, as if it needed further explanation.
Revelling in the idea of Draco falling just as hard as he was, Harry grinned like an idiot, which quickly turned into laughter as Draco looked at Harry as if he had entirely lost the plot. Perhaps he had.
the one to blame, Harry,” Draco replied, his voice stronger than he felt. “I miss Cedric, and he’s –“ Draco took a deep breath. “He’s really dead, but it
“Ginny!” Ron exclaimed at her language and she shrugged.
Before Hermione could respond, Ron burst through the door, with two children dangling from his arms. “You two are getting too big for this,” he huffed, swinging them through the air and onto the sofa. Shrieks of laughter could be heard from Rose and Hugo as Ron threw himself between the two, sighing loudly. “Hey mate, good to see you,” he said, his eyes half shut.
Harry wished that Umbridge’s office was closer to the History of Magic classroom, and not on the other side of the school. His mind was filled with thoughts about Sirius already being dead. A lot of time had already passed since his dream and every minute standing around doing nothing was another minute of Sirius being tortured to death.
Draco nodded. “Why would I trust him blindly?” he asked, concerned.
Harry should have expected it to happen eventually, if anything he was surprised it didn’t happen sooner. However, being pulled into an empty classroom on the way to the Great Hall was not when nor where he expected it to happen.
“Dorian Gray,” Draco said, looking longingly at the book.
Startling awake, Draco noticed there was now a blanket draped over him, and a pillow under his head. Before he could question where the blanket had come from, and where Harry was, he heard a voice from the window seat. “Morning,” Harry said, offering Draco a smile.
“I will,” Draco grinned, gathering up the cards. “Do you want to play again?”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Really? That’s not what I remember,” he grinned. “You truly do have a terrible memory Potter,” he said, quickly managing to dodge Harry as he tried to whack Draco on the arm.
Once Sirius had left to talk to the Order, Harry spent hours pacing the Boy’s Dormitory, waiting to hear from Sirius, from anyone, really. He paced until his feet began to ache, and then paced some more. Draco stayed with Harry when the others left for dinner, trying to persuade him to join them in the Great hall, but Harry refused. He didn’t want to miss Sirius’ call.
Placing his hands on Teddy’s shoulders, Harry looked at Teddy with a smile, blinking back tears. “Teddy, if you want to call me Dad –“ he laughed, interrupting himself. “I would love for you to call me Dad,” he beamed, moving a hand to brush Teddy’s hair from his eyes. Teddy stared at Harry, screwing up his face as if to stop himself from crying. “
A part of him still held hope that when he entered the common room, he’d be there.
Chuckling, the Slytherin duo glanced back at Harry, who was watching their interactions curiously. Their friendship was different to those he had with his fellow Gryffindor’s, but it reminded him of Fred and George – if Fred actually listened to George and the two of them managed to keep their cool.
Harry rolled his eyes, groaning. “That sounds about right,” he muttered to himself. “You know how Ron and Hermione didn’t write me?” he asked. Draco nodded. “Yeah, well,
“I think it’s just that I don’t know anyone as petty as you,” Harry retorted.
Draco had no idea what he wanted. He had contemplated the idea of being in other houses, allowed himself the fantasy of being anyone other than a Slytherin, a Malfoy, but did that mean he didn’t want to be a Slytherin? “I don’t think I did,” Draco replied, his voice timid and his words seeming lost. “But it was
“Draco,” Harry said softly. “What’s wrong?” he asked, as Draco looked anywhere other than at Harry.
The warmth inside of Harry at these interactions almost made him forget why Sirius and Remus were here.
’ as Blaise had put it. There was something different about Harry’s appearance, but he couldn’t tell what. His eyes were still a bright emerald green, and his hair as untameable as when they were in first year.
“Very,” Draco replied, placing a teacup on the counter. “The weekend rush,” he smirked, glancing at Harry. “I’ll bring this to you when it’s done, now stop distracting me,” he said, waving his hand at Harry dismissively.
Draco was sat at the table in the kitchen, trying to catch his thoughts before they ran too far away from him. There was a lot they wished for him to believe, but he knew everything would work out. He’d get to the safe house, wander about for a bit, try to figure out the layout of the place, and then Harry would arrive, announce they admitted their mistake, and all would be well.
“There is nothing wrong with being a burden,” Cedric continued. “Everyone is a burden sometimes, we’re human, but shutting people out won’t help anyone, least of all yourself.”
“In winter?” Harry asked, barely containing his laughter.
“It’s because you have subtle gay undertones,” Harry teased, leaning towards Draco, who looked horrified.
His sentence was interrupted by Harry, who crashed their lips together. It was short and desperate, with Harry having thought of nothing else all week, but it was soft, and Harry felt his magic rush through his body.
Before Harry could explain he was only helping out for the day, the other woman nodded. “We’ve been visiting here since it opened,” she explained to Harry. “Although Hilda and I have no idea when that actually was,” she laughed, as Hilda rolled her eyes.
“Loathes me? Finds me intolerable?” Harry supplied.
“I didn’t know what I would happen, if I’d mention that my father wanted me to take the mark or something, and I panicked. I switched the phials,” Draco explained.
“I’d like that,” he said, smiling at Draco.
Draco shrugged again. “Possibly,” he said, and Harry raised his eyebrow further with a grin.
Then he remembered. “I can check,” he whispered, thinking about the mirror shard in the bottom of his trunk. Harry grasped at Draco’s face and smashed their lips together, as an excited ‘
He had also changed the colour of his hair overnight.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows at this.
“Something about a prophecy.” Harry furrowed his eyebrows at Malfoy who shrugged. “I didn’t exactly ask them to elaborate, I rather enjoy living,” Malfoy said, rolling his eyes.
Shaking his head, Harry pushed himself from Draco. “No,” he began. “
’ That would end well…
“You prat,” he teased, bumping his shoulder to Draco’s. “You make it sound like a tragedy.”
“Why am I not surprised?” he chuckled.
“Nice to meet you Scorpius,” Harry said, shaking Scorpius’ hand, who seemed delighted to have a new friend. “I’m Harry.”
“I’ll try,” she shrugged, kneeling down to get to Scorpius’ height. “Make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid whilst I’m gone will you?” she whispered to him, loud enough for Draco to hear, and Scorpius nodded enthusiastically.
“Why didn’t you?” Draco asked, confused as to Potter’s pleasantries. He had fully expected to have to try multiple times before Potter looked at the wand, or at the very least, have Potter be hostile towards him. This just felt, too nice. “Don’t you hate me?”
’ shape with his mouth. “But, why would that bring you here?”
Ron nodded. “My entire family has been – at least for a while,” he shrugged, as if bored him. “Sort of hope I’m not in Gryffindor, would be something different,” Ron scowled. He then shook his head, forcing himself to smile.
“I think you’ve said before,” Harry said, passing over a couple of twenty-pound notes to the lady, who was trying her best to supress a laugh. “And for the record, I’m not the only git in this relationship,” he said, thanking the cashier as she handed him the bag of books and they left the shop.
“I was wondering,” Harry said, the two boys still tangled on the floor. “Would you come with me?”
“You make it sound like a death sentence,” Harry said, raising his eyebrows.
“As you wish,” Draco said softly. “But I’d like it back, so I’ll just keep it.”
of my Godchildren,” he announced, leaning forwards.
Draco shook his head. “As tempting as your Godfather’s offer was, Pansy would berate me with constant letters, so I’ve decided to grace the Parkinson’s with my presence,” he drawled, and Harry rolled his eyes, smiling.
is Malfoy here?” Ginny asked, still ready to fight Draco at any sign of danger. She hadn’t heard the conversation between the two boys as Draco only spoke loud enough for Harry to hear him.
“The Shrieking Shack,” Harry said, smiling as he didn’t need to duck under the tree root.
, people are idiots,” he said, and Hermione chuckled.
And that was all Harry needed.
He did leave his mother in that house. He hadn’t even thought about there being a way to get her out. He should have tried to get her out.
, she’s not my type,” he explained, looking over at Harry.
“’Mione, it’s fine, really. I don’t want to talk about it all right?” he sighed, the backs of his eyes beginning to ache. “Besides, I have to tell you guys what happened after I left.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, giving Harry a pointed look. Harry raised his hands.
Teddy shrugged. “They were angry,” he said, leaning into Harry as a stranger passed by. “But I don’t mind,” he grinned. “Emily and Charlie are nice, and they don’t lie to me just to come across as being cooler than they actually are.”
“Ron, it’s fine, really,” Harry assured, placing a hand on Ron’s shoulder. “If you’re not happy here, I’m not going to force you to stay. I mean, yeah, it’s fun to have you as my partner but if you don’t want to be here, you shouldn’t have to stay. Plus, I’m sure Hermione would rather tame a dragon than have to leave her job,” he grinned, shrugging as Ron looked relieved at Harry’s relaxed attitude.
Harry nodded. “You and Scorpius, yes,” he said, containing a laugh as Draco was staring at him, opening his mouth to say something, but seeming to be unable to think of anything.
summer by the pool or at the beach. It was a bit lonely, but Popsy is an amazing chess player –
Harry nodded, running his hand through his hair. “I was sure he was going to taunt me or, Merlin, I don’t know, try to start a fight but he didn’t,” Harry said, his mind was yet to process everything that had happened, and he wasn’t sure he wanted it to.
“Well,” Draco said nonchalantly, his face still tinted pink. “I might be able to let it slide,” he shrugged, and Harry bit back a laugh.
a teashop Potter,” Malfoy clarified with a small smile. “And after, the war, I didn’t care much for doing anything else,” he shrugged, and Harry knew Malfoy wasn’t going to explain further.
Harry shrugged, still chuckling at Sirius. “Same as usual, Umbridge is still a bitch – I mean, horrible person,” he added quickly.
Draco felt his face turn pink. “I -
“I really hope this one is it,” Harry said, passing over another wand to Draco. “This one is Pine wood and Phoenix feather.”
Andromeda pursed her lips. “I’ll hold you to that Harry,” she sighed, as Teddy wandered up to the two of them to show-off the pebbles he had collected and how he could change his hair to match the colour of the pebbles (which Harry found rather impressive).
is a burden at times, but that never changes the fact that there are people who care for you,” he said, echoing the words of Cedric.
Harry sighed and shook his head. “No, I need to tell you something.”
in Merlin’s name, is this pretentious git here?” she sneered, her eyes narrowing as Malfoy sighed.
He sighed, rubbing his eyes with his palms; all he wanted was to be by the lake.
He decided it was better not to ask. “
“I know manners,” he muttered, biting into the cinnamon bun. It was certainly harder to scowl after that.
I missed you,” he muttered.
,” he sniffed, beckoning for Harry to follow him as he walked deeper into the shop.
Draco shrugged. “I went to see a friend,” he explained, sitting back down next to Blaise – he was scared Pansy would remove one of his limbs. “We met in Diagon Alley getting Hogwarts supplies. I went to make sure he got on the train okay – I’m pretty sure he grew up with Muggles,” Draco said, ignoring their scandalised faces.
As Draco was leaving, Harry caught his sleeve. “Let me know if you want any help, okay?” he said, staring intently at Draco, so he’d realise Harry wasn’t just saying it out of politeness.
“How you ever got anything above a D, is beyond me,” Draco said, reading through Harry’s potion essay, brushing his fingers through Harry’s hair as his head was on Draco's lap. “Your handwriting is abysmal Potter.”
about playing Quidditch and resort to foul play, which isn’t doing anyone any favours.”
McGonagall’s office,” Teddy corrected himself, making sure he wasn’t walking on the cracks in the pavement between the stones as he held hands with Harry. “And they said they saw the sword of Gryffindor, but
“Well don’t stand in the door like a prat all day Potter, you’ll let the heat out,” he drawled, nodding his head towards the back of the teashop.
Draco’s face went pink when he remembered that detail, making Harry raise an eyebrow. “I – er – I’m the one who told him to warn you actually, I didn’t know he’d go quite that far though.”
are you here?” Harry asked, unable to stop himself from interrupted Malfoy.
Once their laughter died down, they let the silence envelop them, the Prophets article forgotten as Harry’s mind was incapable of thinking about anything other than their close proximity. Harry felt Draco’s fingers gently brush against his skin, and he wondered if Draco knew they were still holding hands – though it seemed unlikely that he didn’t. They’d built a strange relationship over the past few weeks but it appeared that both boys were scared of what they had ending.
,” Andromeda said, placing her hand on his arm to get him to stop biting at his fingers. She knelt down beside him. “Your concern is admirable dear, but I
“The man let me rot in Azkaban for twelve year, I wouldn’t be too sure,” Sirius sighed, his tone bitter. “Is it possible for you to adopt him? I mean, you’re
“You were going to.”
Draco shrugged, handing it to him. “Be my guest.”
“If you’re just going to laugh –“
Draco hoped Harry had found the platform without any trouble.
Harry hadn’t seen or heard about Malfoy in years, and he supposed this was why. He had submerged himself in Muggle culture; entirely, by the looks of his hair. As much as Harry tried not to watch Malfoy, it was difficult. It was as if staring at Malfoy would give him the answers to the question in his mind – it didn’t; in fact, it only furthered his curiosity.
“If you say old, Harry, whilst I’ll be flattered, I
Not trusting his voice, he nodded, scurrying to the Hufflepuff table. He could feel the stares of Pansy and Blaise watching him, but he couldn’t bring himself to look at them. Draco had been wondering if he would be in another house, but he had hoped to be in Slytherin.
he thought to himself. “And don’t talk with your mouth full,” he scolded, but Teddy ignored him, focusing more on the first thing he said.
“I hate you both,” she said, glaring at them.
Malfoy wasn’t there.
Draco nodded. “I think it might be the magic,” he said, and Sirius looked at Draco in surprise, as if he hadn’t expected Draco to pick up on such a thing. “It feels like a soft blanket,” he shrugged.
“Harry – oh – Draco, why are you calling, is Harry OK?” Sirius asked, squinting at the shard. This interaction only made the rest of the group more confused – when had Sirius had time to meet Draco?
,” Harry said, unable to stop a smile from pushing its way onto his face.
Draco shot the duo a sympathetic look before following him. Harry hadn’t gone far, he was waiting by the door, and when Draco closed the entrance to the library, Harry released a breath that made it sound as if he had been holding it. “I thought you didn’t blame them?” Draco asked nonchalantly, as if it were a question about the weather.
“I’m proud of you Harry,” Andromeda smiled, placing a hand on his shoulder. Turning slightly, Harry quickly wrapped his arms around her, hugging her once more.
,” Draco said, staring at a passing cloud. “If you want me to.”
Even so, he spent the lesson trying to drown out Snapes snide commentary about his skills in Potions. “Mr Potter, you need to
Harry blushed and grinned, “well, it tastes better this way.”
show you how to do it.”
Harry paused, taking a moment to consider whether he should tell the truth, or perhaps to figure out how he really was feeling. “I’m not sure,” he said quietly. “What about you?”
He was
“Cake?” Harry asked Draco, grinning.
“The feelings mutual,” Harry chuckled, managing to speak for the first time since he had been pulled into the classroom.
, it’s all fucked isn’t it. This is really happening,” Draco breathed, shivering slightly as he watched a bird fly by.
“No,” Draco said, smirking at Harry who looked so close to throwing his cards at Draco. “If I let you win this set, then we
The cold was biting at Harry’s neck as he tightened his cloak around him, hoping to repel the cold. He tucked the invisibility cloak further under his arms and waited for a familiar head of white-blond hair.
you we’d find ‘em,” Ron grinned, waving at the two of them.
“Seriously?” Ron asked, sitting up straight. “Why haven’t we ever gotten anything?” he asked, as if it was a crime. George rolled his eyes at his brother.
It was as Harry was passing the books to the cashier, that Draco seemed to regain his composure. “Wait a moment,” he muttered. “I call foul play,” he said, glaring at Harry.
“Potter, I’m one of the last people who would accuse you of lying at the moment,” Malfoy said, his gaze unshifting from Harry who furrowed his eyebrows.
“Draco, it will be
“Bloody hell Ron, why do you need them?” Ginny asked, glaring at him as he had yelled down her ear.
doubt it causes you pain to say my name Draco.”
“He’s the mysterious friend, right?” Hermione asked, smiling as Harry nodded. “I knew if you wouldn’t tell us who it was, there had to be a reason, and I’ve told you two about how Blaise is a work friend, so I knew it had to be someone you thought we really wouldn’t like,” she explained, and Harry felt like an idiot.
After explaining their idea in more detail, Harry felt as if a massive weight had lifted off his shoulders – he felt as if he could fly without his firebolt, though he wouldn’t try. The four of them sat on the cold stone ground, sipping on the Butterbeer that Remus had grabbed on his way to meet Harry. He noticed Draco glancing at him with a faint smile and grinned at the blond, who rubbed circles on Harry’s hand and Harry wondered if Draco knew that he was doing it.
Parkinson smiled at him for the first time since Harry at been dragged into the classroom, and surprised Harry by wrapping him in a gentle hug. “You’re all right Potter,” she said, smiling as she took a step back. “Not who I would have chosen, but I suppose I can see why he’s so smitten,” she smirked, as Harry smiled, blushing profusely.
“You love him don’t you,” Ron groaned, and Harry felt defensive.
He was a child, who got dragged into a war by his own father who chose a lunatic over his own family.
Which was when Draco plucked the mirror from his hand.
Draco watched Sirius with a curious gaze. He knew there was more to it than that.
Shaking his head, Harry quickly caught up to Draco. “I have plenty of decorum-ness,” he scowled, watching as Draco sighed with a smile.
Harry placed his hands on the boy’s shoulders to steady him. “We’ll have to talk to your Grandma, but if you’d like to, you can,” he smiled, and Teddy looked as if he could float with pure joy. “You all right to travel by floo? Or would you rather side-apparate?” he asked, as Teddy picked up his trunk.
Harry snorted.
Harry chuckled and rolled his eyes. Of course, Malfoy hadn’t listened. “I forgave you a long time ago Malfoy,” he said, glancing up at Malfoy whose ears went pink as he nodded. “Why do you work in a teashop?” Harry asked, unable to contain his curiosity. He hoped he wasn’t pissing Malfoy off, but when he looked at Malfoy’s expression, he seemed to be completely unbothered.
“Could these questions be asked over tea?” he asked, watching Potter grin at the realisation.
Draco nodded. “Probably.”
because I want them to be happy?” he said, but it sounded more like a question. “I want to lessen the stress of the situation for them, comfort them.”
“I know you’re teasing me but, even though I’d be shit at it, it would be so much better,” he sighed, lifting his glasses to rub the bridge of his nose.
Taking a deep breath, Draco sat up straight. “It’s,
“Sod off you git,” Harry laughed, lightly kicking Malfoy in the shins.
He wasn’t there either.
“I don't think I can let them know about it yet. they'll blame themselves for never noticing," Harry sighed. "And, well, I thought that you could talk to Sirius and Remus about your situation because they’re in – because they might know what to do,” Harry smiled sheepishly.
“I suppose not Potter,” Draco grinned, periodically disappearing behind the counter as he prepared the teapot and teacups.
However, by the time he had brewed his potion, Harry could not only taste blood from biting the inside of his cheek, but he most definitely had a bruised foot from the amount of times Ron had to remind Harry to not give Snape the satisfaction of a reply.
“Are you ready to leave?” she asked sitting at the table.
Returning the hug, Harry replied, “It’s good to see you too Andie.”
thought about how his refusal to accept the title of Dad had affected
“Fuck,” Harry muttered, smiling to himself.
“Don’t forget Draco,” Lucius said, walking toward the front door of the Manor. “You’re a Malfoy above all.”
“Doesn’t mean you like them though,” he said.
Malfoy waved a hand dismissively. “No, not because of that.”
?” Potter blinked rapidly, seeming to check Draco was really there.
Little did he know that Harry was the one who asked Pansy and Blaise to help cheer him up, leading to the first cross-house sleepover.
“It’s dark out,” Harry said when Draco returned from the till. He was now the only person left in the shop besides Draco.
“What do you do all day?” Ron asked. “’Cause you can always visit the shop you know,” he offered, and George nodded.
As they began to walk around the park, Harry felt a warmth fill his stomach, and he couldn’t help but stare at Draco. “You know what would make these even better?” Draco asked, pulling Harry from his lovestruck trance. “Apples,” he grinned.
Harry found himself, once again, thinking about how strange this all was. Normally when he had a conversation with Malfoy one of them said something to piss off the other and they’d be at each other’s throats within seconds. Yet, after taking a Befuddlement Draught, a potion which renders the drinker a reckless idiot, their response was to be civilised with each other. It made it seem as if the true impetuous act for them was to become friends.
“The cupboard,” Harry replied.
“Are Saturdays busy then?” Harry asked, unsure if he’d ever seen more than six people in the shop at once.
Chuckling, Harry looked at the dragon, just in time to see it land on Draco’s head. The other two laughed, as Draco picked up the dragon, whispering to him. “
Draco tilted his head towards Harry and prodded his shoulder. “Oi! Don’t fall asleep on me Potter, I have to go to at least one lesson today.”
“By the way,” Harry said. “What money do you take?” he asked.
“Lead the way,” Draco said, standing to join him.
“Really?” Draco asked. “I just hope he’s okay, the Ministry’s really been screwing him over lately,” he sighed, thinking back to the letters the two of them had been writing.
“But you didn’t have to tell me anything, so thanks for the heads up,” Harry said, offering a small smile to Malfoy who looked back at Harry as if he’d just suggested they try to grow wings.
Draco lightly thwacked him round the back of the head. “Never mention the ferret,” he shivered, and Harry bit back a giggle.
With a little more ‘
With that, Harry stepped out of the portrait and into the corridor, with no idea where he would go, but he needed a break from Ron’s overwhelming pity.
Harry snorted. “Can I have the Queen of Hearts back?” he asked, not even looking up from his cards.
–!“ he screamed, the words tearing at his throat, making his eyes water. He noticed Harry was watching him, baffled by the outburst. “Sorry,” he said, sitting back down on the bank with a thud. “Sorry, I was just,
“If you’re about to apologise, I will hex you, you apologised years ago,” he said, interrupting Malfoy before he got a chance to. Harry saw Malfoy look confused for a moment, before regaining composure.
The voices in the kitchen had entirely died down by now, and Ted and Draco exchanged glances. “Do you think –“ Draco began, only to be interrupted by the slamming of the back door in the kitchen.
“What if you’re smart and brave?” the boy asked, looking ashamed of himself as soon as he’d asked it.
His face warmer than usual, and by the looks of it, Draco’s too, the two wandered down the street, unable to stop glancing at each other every few seconds. As soon as they reached one of the quieter side streets, Draco turned to Harry. “Can I kiss you?” he asked, and Harry certainly did not want to refuse.
“It’s true,” Malfoy shrugged. “You look as if you haven’t slept for a week and you stared at the fire like you wanted to jump into it,” he said bluntly. “Peppermint improves sleep and stress-levels, and it can make you feel more energetic.”
“Well, at the time I didn’t know
Smiling to himself, Harry sat, drinking his tea and observing the teashop, an elderly couple near him catching his eye as they sat in silence, their hands entwined on table, simply enjoying the presence of someone they deeply cared for.
“No way!” she called back, quickly scrambling over to the three of them. “Since when?” she asked.
She introduced herself as Professor McGonagall and told them the feast would begin after the sorting ceremony and that they were to wait here until her return.
The Hufflepuffs in his year had avoided talking to him the entire night. They hadn’t been awful, but it didn’t help the tightness in his chest when his dormmates pretended he didn’t exist. The only person who had spoken to him since his sorting had been one of the prefects, Gabriel Truman, who noticed his distance from the other Hufflepuffs. He had tapped Draco on the shoulder and told him that it’s normal to be nervous on the first night, but that Hufflepuff was like a family. Draco had simply nodded and given the prefect a small smile to get him to go away.
“What could we possibly have to talk about?” he taunted, raising an eyebrow as Harry frowned.
“It’s lovely to see that boy finally hire someone to help him out,” the woman said. “I’ve been telling him for years to at least have someone help him on Saturday’s.”
His explanation was by no means coherent, or chronological. There were many instances in which he backtracked what he was saying or made additions to memories he’d spoken about previously. He tried not to look at Sirius or Remus because he knew if he looked, he would stop talking, and he didn’t want to.
The journey back up the train was much less chaotic than the journey down – Draco was glad he didn’t have to dodge any rogue fireworks this time. As he looked out the windows of the train, he noticed that they were deep into the countryside and he guessed that they were far from London.
Sirius nodded and frowned. “His name was Regulus,” he said, and Harry took note of the past tense. “We we’re incredibly close as kids, you’d rarely see us apart, but,” he paused, taking a breath. “When I went to Hogwarts, everything changed. I was in Gryffindor and a disgrace. When
As he stood, however, Draco felt a hand catch his wrist, keeping him where he was. He turned to see Harry scrambling to his feet. “I’ll go with you,” he said, his eyes pleading with Draco to not ask any questions – not yet at least. Draco sighed.
Draco couldn't, but that wasn’t the point.
Draco continued to read the book in the comforting silence of the library. There was a solace he found in the sound of the pages as he turned them.
Draco nodded and smiled lovingly at Scorpius. “It is quite something,” he replied with a smirk, noticing Harry blush, slightly embarrassed. Scorpius sat on the window seat and Draco handed him a book to keep him occupied whilst he tried out wands. “Do you have time for us right now or -?”
He walked to the other side of the kitchen, where Draco was, and leaned against the counter once more, watching Draco charm the bowls and cutlery to wash themselves in the soapy water.
As soon as they reached the cave, Sirius transformed back into his human body and tackled Harry in a hug, knocking him back slightly. “I missed you Cub,” Sirius muttered, and Harry hugged the man back, clinging to his Godfather.
he said slowly, carefully annunciating each word, smiling proudly as he managed to say it.
“It was my Dads, not many people know I own this,” he said, watching as Draco’s expression softened. “And it’s not an ordinary cloak,” he grinned, like a five-year-old explaining their favourite book.
“How did they take to you not believing them?” Harry asked, sort of already knowing the answer. Teddy hadn’t written about those two for a while.
Draco gnawed on his bottom lip, as if he it would stop him from saying something he would possibly regret. “I –“ he said. “I never actually drank that potion you know,” he cringed, his face turning pink.
Malfoy smiled fondly at Harry, an expression that made Harry’s knees go weak, and lightly brushed his lips on Harry’s cheek. “I’m sorry.”
“But what if I -"

“Scorpius?” he asked, his voice unstable.
go,” she insisted, resting her hand on Draco’s shoulder. “What have you told Scorpius?”
Draco let out a burst of laughter, quickly stopping himself as Harry raised his eyebrows. “You have a terrible memory Harry,” he pointed out.
“Oh, sorry,” Harry said, lifting his head from Draco’s shoulder to not make him uncomfortable.
“The shops are open to influence from the black market,” Harry explained, sitting opposite Teddy. “Which means quite a few dodgy people hang about there.” Harry pushed Teddy’s hair from his eyes. “So, listen to your Grandma,
“I’ve started to bake again,” Harry said, staring at his hands. He wasn’t sure he wanted to admit he’d started baking to show off for Draco. The kitchen at the teashop was massive after all, and it meant he got to spend the day with his boyfriend. Draco had even started putting the cakes up for sale.
Harry burst into laughter, unable to help himself, and Draco went pink, his nose scrunching up as Harry brought a hand up to his face, dousing his
“Don’t tell him that, I think it would upset him to know he’s mad about me,” Harry joked, feeling a sense of satisfaction when Parkinson snorted. These two where important to Draco, and he wanted to get along with them.

“I still think Draco’s an
“Bye then,” Draco heard Harry reply, somewhat dejected.
“Dunno mate, she won’t let anyone into the kitchen today,” Ron explained, his eyes darting to Rose and Hugo as they almost fell face first onto the floor.
I’m not sure,” he admitted quietly, and she pressed a kiss to his temple.
The trio sprawled across the grass, laughing at each other’s jokes, eating too much food and wondering just
“Lovely idiots, mind,” Draco said, smiling when Pansy snorted.
“You could meet him you know,” Harry said, quickly adding, “if you want to. He is your family.”
of it,” he sighed, reaching up to rub the bridge of his nose, but was unable to, as Draco reached out and grabbed his other hand.
Remus took one look at Harry and wrapped his arms around the boys trembling form, hoping to settle Harry’s nerves. Harry stiffened at the gesture for a moment, before relaxing into Remus’ warm embrace, returning the hug. “It’s been too long Cub,” Remus said softly.
Draco stood frozen. “Dinner?”
Draco winced slightly. “What Warrington did was uncalled for,” Draco said, staring at the telescope in front of them.
Twenty minutes ago, if someone had told him that he would want to kiss Malfoy, it would have sent him into hysterical laughter. Although now, the faint memory his lips had of Malfoy’s made his heart skip a beat and his head spin.
After he walked down the stairs, his feet carried him to the bookshelves. He brushed his fingers over the spines of the books, reading their names.

“I was
Under Ron’s glare, Harry felt the guilt pool in his stomach and twist itself up his spine. He nodded, concerned that if he spoke, the words wouldn’t be what he wanted them to be.
“I didn’t even ask anything!” Harry defended, watching Malfoy sigh with a small smile.
to know what book I got you?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded. He had been curious since they were in the bookshop. Draco pulled a rather small book from the bag and passed it to Harry.
Harry’s demeanour changed, aware of the two meanings that phrase has in this context.
Logically, he knew that it would be better if he let himself face this feeling, rather than pushing it inside, filing it away with all his other emotions on the subject. Yet, it had been neglected for so long, it was painful to bring it to the surface; it was painful to imagine what it would feel like to allow this emotion to exist.
“Of course,” Harry said, amused. He was certain no one besides Draco truly knew this knowledge. Perhaps Mrs Malfoy did.
“Don’t worry,” Hermione said, standing up. “I’ll go make sure they don’t hurt themselves,” she said, smiling meekly at Ron who nodded at her.
Draco paused. “I – yes, that was a
–“ Malfoy took a deep breath to keep his composure. “It means exactly what you think it means,” he scowled.
“You’re a right git you know,” Draco drawled.
“You all right there Potter?” Draco asked, amused.

“We can play a board game later?” Harry suggested, ruffling Rose’s hair making her giggle.
at chess?” she asked, fluttering her eyes so he wouldn’t be upset – it didn’t work.
“Oh no you don’t,” Harry replied, grasping Draco’s wrist and keeping him on the floor. “We play this till the end.”
Draco smiled, feeling a little calmer as he thought of his son. “His name is Scorpius.”
“They –“ Harry broke off as soon as he heard a door opening. His stomach dropped.
Draco wasn’t sure he could cope with that.
“Who would he get in trouble with?” Ron asked. “His dad? Not the scariest of blokes overall, is he?”
OK?” he asked, his eyes insistent.
“I want to!” Harry interrupted, a blush creeping up the back of his neck. “I want to talk, just…”

“Will you be safe there?” Harry asked, unsure of the Parkinson’s allegiance to Voldemort.

“Then I kissed him,” Harry said, deciding he might as well tell them everything.
“Why the

problems,” he muttered.
Draco started to run his fingers through Harry’s hair. “What’s that supposed to mean?” he asked, looking at Harry’s eyes to see him raise an eyebrow.
Harry nodded. “Pretty much every day,” he sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Not all, war related,” he mumbled, as if he didn’t really want Draco to hear that part.
“They are married you know,” Ron said, and Hermione looked as baffled as Harry did a few days ago. “Honestly ‘Mione, you’re clueless with this stuff sometimes, it was bleeding obvious.”
“It was an arsehole move and he shouldn’t have done it,” Draco persisted, as if Harry hadn’t said anything at all.
“He’s a rather intelligent dog,” Harry said, but this still didn’t explain anything to Draco.
“Yes, I know, I have the worst luck,” Malfoy waved his hand dismissively, but Harry could have sworn he saw a smile pulling at the corner of his mouth. “It was easier to have you hate me,” Malfoy admitted, sitting on the edge on the tower.
“You don’t Harry, but perhaps that’s why you’re so charming,” Draco said, placing a hand on Harry’s cheek. Harry couldn’t help but lean into the touch.
Parkinson let out a burst of high pitch laughter. “
“Watch it you great lummox, you’ll leave a bruise,” Malfoy hissed.
Andromeda blinked repeatedly. “Oh?” she repeated.
, so to speak.”
Unsurprisingly, they lived right above the teashop, and the apartment was a lot bigger than Harry had assumed it would be. There were vases filled with wildflowers on every surface and the windows let in the golden light of autumn, illuminating everything it could. The walls were a cream colour, and the floors were made of a rich brown wood. There were photos scattered across the walls and on certain surfaces, containing pictures of the two of them smiling widely. Some contained people he distantly recognised to be Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini, and a few also contained Mrs Malfoy.
“Cub, what was it you wanted to tell me?” Sirius asked, his voice soft, but not as fragile as Remus’.
After watching Draco gently flick through the pages of the book, his fingers dancing across the paper, Harry stood next to him and leant over Draco’s shoulder. “Still the same book?” he said softly, a teasing tone to his voice.
Nodding, Draco cursed to himself as he felt his face flush pink. “She’s my closest friend.”
“Take your time,” Sirius said, noticing Harry’s elongated hesitation. “Don’t rush your thoughts.”
“Weasley will you shut up before I force you to,” Draco snarled, his head snapping towards Ginny. “I understand your dislike and distrust, I really do, but now is not the time,” he snapped, turning to ignore any further protests she spewed – except she didn’t. Draco’s words seemed to draw her attention to the frown on Harry’s face, and how when he leaned into Draco, lacing their fingers together the frown lessened.
Harry kissed him back. His mind completely blank. And the only thing he knew in that moment was that he wanted to kiss Malfoy, the pointy git who had been a thorn in his side since day one. Magic tingled in the air like static, making Harry’s hairs stand on end as the blood rushed to his head and his heartbeat was so loud, he was certain Malfoy could hear it too.
“And when the silver light of the moon gets to mix with the golden rays of the sun, the two will talk. The sun will ask about the joys of living in secret, and the moon will ask about the joys of seeing the people at their best, seeing them smile and bask in his presence –“
Harry decided he needed to get out of bed if he didn’t want to be late, again. Traipsing around his bedroom, Harry got dressed into his Auror robes and brushed his teeth, hoping for a peaceful day.
“No one agreed with him going that far Harry,” Draco said, sitting to look at Harry. “Taunting people is one thing, but to bring up, what he did –“
skill.”
He didn’t know what to say.
There was a sudden bang of glass shattering which snapped him back into reality. Harry realised what he just said, and that he told not only Snape, but the entire class.
Interrupting Draco, Harry tackling the blond in a hug, almost knocking him to the ground. “Thank you,” he said quietly, smiling as Draco got over his initial shock and hugged him back.
Almost spilling his hot chocolate, Draco turned to Harry. “You’re speaking to them?” he asked.
This set Harry off laughing. “You’re a confusing one Malfoy,” he replied, placing his head back onto his shoulder, purposefully shaking his head to tickle Draco’s neck.
Harry nodded in agreement. “I agree with your Dad,” he looked around slightly, checking no one was nearby before leaning forwards slightly. “Magic tends to give it a horrible aftertaste,” he added in a whisper, biting back a laugh as the boy’s eyes went comically wide.
have – so I – you like me then?” he said, and Draco chuckled.
“Will do,” Draco smiled. He examined Harry’s face, and felt a weird sensation at the realisation that Harry’s facial features had changed, but also, hadn’t. Draco knew that his own features had become sharper, ‘
Draco,” he assured, hesitantly placing a hand over Draco’s, which was resting on the counter. “I –
,” Harry said, his voice soft and he hoped what he said next was the right thing to say. “You’ve been my child since you were a few months old, even if we aren’t related by blood,” he said, slowly brushing his fingers through Teddy’s hair. It had always helped calm him, ever since he was two years old.
“Me?” Draco asked, incredulously.
“Well, at least this has an upside,” Ted chuckled. “Right,” he said, putting his hands on his knees in a dramatic fashion. “I need to head to Mungo’s,” he announced, standing up to leave the room. “Love you,” he said to Andromeda, kissing her temple. “I’ll see you later Draco,” he waved, and Draco smiled at the man as he left to use the floo in the kitchen.
“Dad charmed him,” Scorpius explained, still watching the dragon as he perched on a shelf before taking off again.
“Hi Remus,” Harry said, hoping his nerves didn’t transpire into his voice.
“You’re brilliant,” he said, his eyes wide and shining. “A real wonder boy,” he joked, and Harry didn’t have the heart to reprimand him as he usually did. It was a wonderful smile.
“Why do I put up with you?” Draco muttered, shaking his head.
Burying his hands in the earth, Draco found a pebble, which he held tight, nodding. “Right,” he muttered. “
for one am excited to spend the next seven years with you both,” she grinned, falling dramatically onto the seat opposite Draco and Blaise. “We’re all going to have so much fun in Slytherin.”
“Like basketball,” Harry said, nodding.
“I can’t believe the
Wrapping an arm around Harry, Draco took a deep breath. “It might not be the best, Mother usually told stories to me in French,” he said softly, shaking his head. “The sun is always the
“Do you want to go on a date?” Harry blurted, unsure where the confidence came from.
Sirius laughed. “You don’t have to worry about swearing in front of me Cub,” he grinned. “But not too much, your father would have had my head if I let you swear too much,” he said, making Harry grin. He’d missed his Godfather. “So, is there any particular reason you called, or did you just miss your favourite Godfather?”
he began, pacing about the kitchen. “They move it to be with the

And waited.
“’Course we can do that,” Ginny grinned, jumping to her feet, and dragging Neville and Luna to theirs. “Anything to fuck with Umbridge.”
Harry ran his fingers through his hair. “Depends, what’s the tea?” he asked, enjoying the way Draco’s mouth curled in an amused smile.
?” she replied, and Ron’s eyes bulged out of his skull.
Draco turned his head to look at Harry. “I never said to move,” he pouted, sounding both disappointed and as if the idea that Harry should move his head was blasphemous.
Then, he heard an all too familiar voice. “Draco,” his father’s voice commanded, and Draco couldn’t help but stand up straight, his blood running cold. “You are to stay at Hogwarts for the year, understood?” the voice said, and Draco nodded, feeling sick to his stomach. “What a waste,” the Howler sighed, before tearing itself to pieces and drifting to the ground.
“I – but that was years ago!” Harry exclaimed, a cold feeling rushing through his body as Malfoy laughed bitterly.
” he muttered. “Draco, you’ve been holding out on us.”
“Daddy, what does this word say?” he asked, pointing at his book.
It was time for him to try again, and when he arrived at the hospital wing, Madam Pomfrey was waiting outside for him. “Hello again Mr Malfoy,” she sighed, a smile flickering across her face. “I believe you know what the answer will be.”
“That was awful,” Teddy said, scrunching his face up as he clutched his head to stop him from getting dizzy.
“What can I say?” Harry shrugged, grinning as Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Draco nodded enthusiastically.
-----
“Would it be soon?” Teddy asked, a little apprehensive.
“Scorpius and I spend the day together, my mother doesn’t celebrate, and then we light a candle for those we’ve lost,” he explained, clutching his teacup, taking a deep breath. “It isn’t that exciting compared to how some celebrate it, but Scorpius rather likes our tradition,” he said, smiling to himself. Clearing his throat, Draco shifted in his seat. “Would you,” Draco took another deep breath, tapping the brim of his teacup. “The shop won’t be open tomorrow, and I know you visit on Thursday’s because you don’t want to think about returning to that job you hate.”
“No!” Draco said quickly, holding their hands tighter. “I- I like holding your hand, it’s nice,” he said, his voice getting quieter as he spoke. His face grew hot.
It didn’t take him long as Teddy had bubble-gum pink hair. “Teddy!” He called out, grinning as the eleven-year-old ran at him, leaving his trunk behind, and tackled him into a hug. Harry managed (somehow) to stay on his feet, and he held the boy close.
Scorpius nodded enthusiastically as they approached Harry’s shop. “Yep, Nana let me read some books on them,” he said proudly.
at my
do you –“ Harry began.
“We found a loophole,” Sirius grinned, and Harry’s heart leapt. “You can legally move out at the age of sixteen, so you can spend the first week and a bit of summer at the Burrow, then move in with us,” he explained, and Harry felt a grin break across his face.
Ron and Hermione looked at each other, and then back at Harry, who was feeling incredibly claustrophobic. “Are you sure you’re all right?” Hermione persisted.
in there,” he said, his eyes flickering towards the castle. “Everyone is tip-toeing around me, even Siri-“ he paused, and then sighed. “
Harry joined him, grinning at the bemused look Malfoy gave him as he did. “I didn’t and I don’t hate you,” Harry began, earning a raised eyebrow from Malfoy. “I certainly didn’t
– you, Harry Potter, are highly annoying, did you know that?” he asked, still smiling.
“In my defence, I wasn’t quiet,” Sirius shrugged, nodding towards the empty seat on the sofa next to Draco. With a nod from Draco, Sirius sat down. “There’s something welcoming about this room.”
Once they were out of earshot of Walburga, Draco asked, “So what’s it like to be a criminal?” jokingly.
“What did you tell them?” Harry asked, hoping his nerves weren’t showing in his voice, despite being able to see his hand shaking as he put food in the cupboards.
With a smile, Harry pulled the invisibility cloak from his cloak with a dramatic flourish. “Ta-da,” he said, laughing as Draco raised an eyebrow.
Harry hummed in response, shifting his position slightly to get more comfortable. “Potter again is it?” Harry teased.
” Harry spluttered between bursts of laughter, sitting up and shielding his face with his arms.
Dodging an extremely loud firework – he had no idea how that got past someone’s parents – he had nearly reached the end of the train.
At first, he felt a swell of anger and regret. Why did he think this was a good idea?
“Just boring regular tea I’m afraid, the rest is all downstairs,” he called over his shoulder, pulling the jar from the shelf.
“No even Granger and Weasley?” Draco asked, surprised.
-----
“There are some things you don’t need to try to know how abysmal they would be,” Malfoy said, looking at Harry as if he was mad.
“Prat.”
-----
Harry didn’t want to explain the dream, but he did explain that he needed to get into Umbridge’s office to use the floo and to do that, they needed to get her out of her office.
, Scarhead?’
Rolling his eyes Harry passed Draco the card. “Queen of Clubs,” Harry said, his eyes widening at his mistake. “Wait, no –“
“Perks of being a Malfoy,” he smirked, making Harry roll his eyes. “Where does this tunnel lead?” he asked, ducking under a tree root.
Andromeda sighed. “Quite dull,” she said. “The weather was worse there than it was here. If it wasn’t for rain protection charms, I’d have been stuck inside for the entire month,” she said, balancing the tea on her lap. “I’m not sure how Muggles do it.”
!” he screamed, throwing the pebble as hard as he could towards the lake.
“Love you too Pans,” Draco grinned as Pansy let out a huff.
“I’ve not a clue why he can’t get the Order to simply add the charm to this house, if he really gives a toss about your wellbeing,” she said, leaning back on her seat. “I think you might have to dear,” she replied, her voice apologetic. “From what I could discern, the plan is to pick you up in three days, where someone will take you to the safe house.”
Draco let go of his Aunt’s hands immediately, standing straight whilst looking at the floor. “Sorry Mother,” he said, his eyes stinging.
the hat began, and Draco felt his anticipation rise until his heart felt as if it was about to give out. “HUFFLEPUFF,” the hat yelled.
Malfoy kept his calm demeanour, only further agitating Harry and raised an eyebrow. “That’s what you want to know? Why? Not how or whether it was a joke?” he asked, staring back at Harry with a similar intensity to Harry.
In hindsight, Harry had been rather anxious, and Draco was correct, he needed to sit down and take a breath. After some tea, Draco had smiled and assured Harry that Grimmauld Place was lovely.
Beth nodded. “Well, it’ll only get worse I’m afraid dear,” she smiled. “We shan’t keep you, but it’s wonderful to see a new face, isn’t it love?” she asked Hilda who nodded.
Harry reappeared a moment later, this time not stumbling over the roots of the trees. He was holding 4 boxes, each the same and Draco thought for a second, he saw Harry look confused but when he blinked, Harry was smiling again.
“Mightn’t it?” Harry chuckled, earning a small laugh from Teddy who nodded, arms wrapped tight around Harry. “Well, if you want a hot chocolate, I’m afraid, you’ll have to let go,” Harry said, biting back a smile when Teddy violently shook his head. “I’m not going anywhere Teddy, I promise,” he said, and Teddy looked up at him.
feel, only that whatever you
Padfoot, I know, I’ll explain them to you
Scorpius nodded, as if this was a serious competition. “You have to bake a cake on Samhain.”
Draco was avoiding Harry. There wasn’t much he could do to explain why, but he didn’t want to talk about the Howler’s, and he didn’t want to burden anyone.
“You’ll slip one day Potter,” Harry heard a familiar voice call as he was swinging his legs over the side of the Astronomy Tower. “Don’t expect me to jump after you.”
“I’m also a Death Eater,” said Draco, somewhat trying to get Potter to hate him. He’d feel less confused if Potter yelled at him or told him to fuck off.
Malfoy furrowed his eyebrows. “Yes,” he said with a nod.
“I think if we didn’t have silencing charms, the whole street would have heard, love,” Ted replied, as Andromeda picked up a teacup from the table, most likely abandoned when Dumbledore arrived. “But if you weren’t giving him a piece of your mind, I would have been.”
Malfoy only nodded as Harry finished his cup of peppermint tea and poured himself another. “I’ll think about it,” Malfoy replied, regaining his composure. “I don’t think I can go emerald green.”
It wasn’t as if he had slept more than usual, and the only difference to the past few weeks had been his run-ins with the Malfoys. “I –“
Malfoy smirked. “I suppose that’s true,” he said, picking up the empty teacup and teapot.
“Draco!” Harry exclaimed, quickly scrambling to sit cross legged on his bed. There was a rather handsome looking dog sat next to him, and Draco wondered where it had come from.
“Doesn’t Draco have a child?” Hermione asked. “I could swear Blaise mentioned it in passing once.”
“Malfoy, I’m serious, you don’t need to pay,” Harry said, refusing to take the money as Draco offered it.
Draco didn’t pay much attention to other people’s sorting, as he grinned at Blaise who looked off put at the fact that Draco was closest to how they would be sorted. A spell was the closest any of them had come to an enchanted hat.
Harry elbowed him. “I’m very persuasive,” he boasted, making both of them chuckle.
,” Harry said, staring at his shoes whilst Draco pretended there was absolutely nothing more interesting than the book cover he was currently holding. “I’m not ready yet,” he said faintly, climbing the stairs and rushing from the library.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “I’m still here you know,” Harry muttered, watching the corners of Malfoys lips twitch upwards.
He glanced at the kitchens and the Great Hall.
“You know what Samhain is?” Draco responded, impressed. “Not many do nowadays.”
“As was I you git.”
Ignoring Ginny, Harry leaned into the blond’s touch, shaking his head. “He has Sirius, and I need to – I have to save him,” he said breathlessly, and Draco pulled him into a hug, pressing his lips to the top of Harry’s head.
“Of course not!” Harry said, snapping his head up to meet Zabini in the eye as Parkinson watched him, as if she was examining him. “It’s not his fault his dad’s a prick,” he sighed.
Then, Harry burst into laughter, unable to control himself, and Draco relaxed. “You – are – so – fucking – adorable,” he heaved, chuckling as Draco went pink.
Opening his mouth to reply, Harry seemed to second guess himself. He sighed. “I’m – not sleeping well,” he admitted, avoiding Draco’s gaze, and opting to look at the carpet instead.
might die,
It did make a sort of sense.
“I know, I know, I’m a terrible influence, you’ve said,” Harry grinned. When Draco wasn’t looking, he stuck his finger in the batter, winking at Scorpius who giggled.
Deciding to head outside, Draco wished he had brought his cloak with him that morning, as the frost was biting at his fingers the moment he stepped outdoors.
“I’m sure they’ll get along great,” Hermione assured. “Teddy’s a wonderful child.”
Scorpius groaned, sitting at the table. “Are you done yet?”
“Used to Pansy, it’s been eight years.” Draco knew meeting at this specific café was a bad idea but he didn’t know many Muggle businesses and was certain Potter would not appreciate being seen with him in the Wizarding world
“Shoes?” Harry asked, finding it difficult to follow along with Scorpius’ thought process. He was still trying to process what Scorpius said about Draco being lonely.
-----
Afterward, Draco had to be careful about bringing his thoughts on Muggles up with Lucius, his mother insisted upon it. He couldn’t understand why, but once he had asked Lucius if he could have some Muggle objects for his birthday as he wanted to learn more about Muggles and Lucius had been furious.
Draco was certain if he had been drinking, he would have done a spit-take, but instead he let out a bark of laughter, before covering his mouth as Pansy glared at him.
“Maybe next time Potter,” Draco smirked.
“Don’t,” Ron hissed, knowing that if Harry wasn’t careful, he wouldn’t have any time for the DA and his schoolwork.
,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “Perhaps my lack of observational skills are why I hate being an Auror,” he joked, leaning back into the sofa.
“You know your father cares for you darling,” his mother said, brushing a stray strand of hair from his forehead. “Even though he can be trying, he means well.”
It happened when the night was at its darkest, the moon at its highest, and the house at its quietest. Surprisingly, it wasn’t the creak of the door that woke Draco, but the sound of feet, walking down the hall.
shape with his mouth as he understood.
And if the Ministry now knew he wasn't lying, then...
,” Draco muttered, tangling his fingers with Harry’s. “What’s wrong?” he asked, his eyes challenging Harry to deny something was wrong, and continued when Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “You’ve been frowning at my hand for the last ten minutes,” Draco supplied, answering Harry’s thoughts.
, there – there must have been something, he
As he walked back through the corridor, Draco couldn’t make out what Narcissa and Andromeda were yelling about, but he knew it must have been serious as they sounded rather angry.
“That’s not everything is it?” Draco asked, his eyes piercing Harry’s.
Draco tensed. “You didn’t -"
Draco nodded.
“It’s not my fault Snape’s a vile, evil git,” Ron muttered, and this time, Harry couldn’t resist his urge to laugh, making Hermione glared at the both of them.
Harry found himself smiling. “Probably not,” he chuckled. “I’m surprised you haven’t accused me of ‘
Harry pulled Teddy in for a hug, and Teddy leaned into the hug, holding on tight to Harry as he kissed the top of his head. “I’m glad to be your Dad,” Harry said softly, brushing a hand through Teddy’s hair, which had turned a pastel blue.
Harry glared at Draco, who’s eyes suddenly lit up as he glanced behind Harry at one of the displays. “What have you seen?” Harry asked with a lazy smile, his eyebrows raised.
Mr Weasley shook his head. “In all fairness Molly, I agree with the sentiment,” he sighed, causing all those in the room who weren’t at the Ministry, to glance between the two with matching frowns.
It was so close.
“It’s so
“Are you sure, dear?” Andromeda checked, placing both her hands on his shoulders and looking directly into his eyes. “Because I can always tell Dumbledore to go screw himself,” she said, making Draco laugh and breaking the awkward tension there had been a few moments ago. “Eloquently, of course,” she smiled.
He was thankful when Draco slipped his hand into his own.
“I’m scared I’m not going to have a choice, and I’m running out of time.”
Harry froze, and Draco couldn’t blame him. It was a difficult question, and Harry had to decide whether to be blunt or give him hope. He wanted it to get easier; he needed it too. The longing in his chest for the family he had found and his mother, the family he knew he had, was unbearable at times.
“Okay!” Rose grinned, running into the kitchen instantly.
Harry rolled his eyes. “You’re my only Godfather Sirius.”
“Thanks,” Harry smiled. Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco blinked. “Oh –
“But Mum! Uncle Harry
And waited.
He overheard a group of Ravenclaw’s theorising on how the Chamber was opened, curious as to why no one was accused but it was suddenly safe for students to be in school.
“She’s got a point mate,” Ron said apprehensively. “It’s been about seven years and you’ve not been on a date or anything.”
Harry watched as Draco raced from one side of the shop to the other, balancing everything in one hand and clearing with the other. How he hadn’t collapsed from exhaustion or dropped anything was beyond Harry.
“Potter,” Malfoy said, his voice low.

“After I ran away, he became the heir to the ‘
“And that is besides the point,” Harry replied.
“Still, it feels like a private event,” Harry said, staring at his cup.
Harry smirked. “But now, you have to wait until I slip up again,” he pointed out.
?” Hermione asked, albeit apprehensively, and Harry appreciated that she didn’t want to overstep.
“I think everything with Warrington made him realise how much he’d been inadvertently encouraging it,” Harry shrugged, choosing to ignore Ron’s comment.
As the door was unlocked, Harry burst into the tower and stood by the door so Malfoy couldn’t run from him.
“I’d never,” Harry interrupted, shaking his head. “That's not for me to tell them. It’s just, I was thinking about who might be able to help you and before you say anything, I
Andromeda simply stared at him. “How did you know?” she asked. Ted looked at his wife, flabbergasted.
Sirius sighed, muttering something to himself that Draco didn’t catch. “You shouldn’t blame yourself Draco,” he said, offering Draco a small smile. “From what I remember about Narcissa, she is a very powerful witch, and if she wanted to leave, no one would be able to stop her.”
“Sencha for two?” Harry asked as he approached the table, despite the old couple being the only customers left in the shop that Harry hadn’t already served.
,” he paused, smiling at Harry who rolled his eyes. “You’ve said I’m not allowed to kill them - which is completely ridiculous.”
“Died?” Draco finished, with an amused smile. “I think I saw my Father once, at my hearing,” he sighed, turning to look at Harry, resting his cheek on the sofa. “I don’t miss him either. I know I probably should, even just a little, but I really don’t.”
He hadn’t told Sirius anything about the Dursley’s. Sirius didn’t know a thing, and now he’s probably learnt about it from a newspaper. If Sirius did something reckless, it would be Harry’s fault, because he should have told his Godfather. What if Sirius went back to Azkaban for this? What if he tried to visit Harry at Hogwarts?
me, warned me about a bloody
“I know Father,” Draco replied quietly, forcing himself to stand as still as possible.
His hand stopped at the handle.
“What took you so long?” Pansy asked, a scowl on her face, as Draco opened the door to their compartment.
-----
Harry didn’t notice he was staring until Malfoy coughed, catching his attention. Malfoy’s cheeks were tinged pink. They sat in awkward silence for a few minutes, Harry shifting his weight from foot to foot as Malfoy became very interested in examining the walls. Harry was bewildered by the situation. He was in a classroom, with Malfoy, after drinking a potion that made him incapable of thinking things through, and made his magic just as reckless… The fact that they’d managed to have a half-decent conversation without threatening each other as well – the whole ordeal was bizarre.
think he’s really nice,” he said, walking away from the two of them to sit on the sofa. Harry and Draco looked at each other.
Hermione tried to snatch it out of his hands as soon as she realised what the headline was, but Harry managed to get out of her reach as he read the headline again, and again.
Casting a
“That’s us, thank you dear,” one of the women said, with a warm smile. The couple was one that Harry recognised and so he assumed they must be regulars. He placed the teapot on the table, careful not to drop it, and placed a teacup in front of each of them.
“You don’t tell me about pasties again and there will be no more kisses,” Draco informed him, and Harry rolled his eyes, knowing it was an empty threat.
“Ahh, well, you know me,” Draco shrugged, a smile pulling at the corner of his mouth. “Wild parties, staying out
I didn’t tell you Padfoot,” he muttered to the dog.
“It’s nice to know I can make you as speechless as you make me,” Harry teased, grabbing the books with one hand and Draco’s hand with the other as they approached the cashier.
Harry loved them both dearly, and saw Teddy as his own son, but one day, Ginny and Harry both agreed that what they felt for each other was simply platonic, and whilst she cared for Teddy, she didn’t have the time to help raise him. So, Harry was twenty, finishing up his Auror training, and recently out of a long-term relationship. Thankfully, Andromeda was thrilled to be able to spend more time with her grandson, and their roles reversed. Harry ended up barely seeing Teddy once a month and Andromeda was ruthless in telling him how much of a mess he was.
“Yeah, I do, but why do you need them?” she asked, now more reluctant to hand them over.
He relaxed his body, his breaths deepening slightly as he realised it wasn’t his aunt.
Harry couldn’t help himself, he laughed.
Although, he had asked Scorpius for his opinion on the date, which was met with a rather assuring thumbs up from the eight-year-old, and he was, therefore, almost certain that the cat was out of the bag.
Instead, Draco nodded. “Oh,” he said.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, thanks and doing this does give me more time for customers,” he said, sipping his tea. “So, you have a son?” Harry asked, leaning into his seat.
Harry softly smiled at Draco, finding it cute that Draco cared so. “I know,” he said.
The only way Draco could replicate this feeling in the Black Manor was to light a fire and huddle on the sofa by the mantle.
“Thirty-four,” Draco said. They both chuckled as Evelyn looked bemused. “Unofficially, would you say almost two months?”
Remus sighed, offering Harry a small supportive smile. “Is that what this impromptu call is about?”
“You make it sound like a business meeting,” he muttered. “And that was not because I was
Draco smiled softly at Harry, before pressing his lips to Harry’s, “Thank you Harry, for letting me join you,” he said. “But,” he looked at Harry, who had opened his mouth to reply. “Don’t use my problems to avoid your own, talk to your Godparents about what they
Rolling his eyes, Draco couldn’t help but smile at Blaise’s theatrics. “It’s been nice knowing you Blaise,” Draco said, closing his eyes and enjoying the sun. “And Pansy, don’t get caught,” he added.
Then, he saw him, squashing himself against the window, watching the tree’s fly by. “Harry!” Draco exclaimed, opening the compartment door. As he did, he realised that Harry wasn’t alone. “Oh, sorry, hello,” he said, smiling at the ginger haired boy sat opposite Harry.
“You can call me Harry, if you want” he said, watching with amused eyes and the two of them wrinkled their noses.
“Does this mean I’m moving in with you?” Teddy asked, practically buzzing. “And I get to stay with you in the summer?”
But, no matter how much he tried to will it into fruition, sleep did not cure whatever was happening. Just after a week, Pansy tried to insist that he go to a wand maker, any wand maker but Draco refused – “It’s got nothing to do with my wand Pansy, it will pass.”
The sound of his footsteps on the stone floors echoed through the corridor, only just audible past the blood pounding in his ears. The longer he walked, the more his anger dissipated and turned into panic and frustration. He knew the potion was going to make him reckless, but what he just did was practically suicidal.
“And now my Daddy is taking me to see the ducks – I know that ducks aren’t your friends but they’re really nice!” Scorpius explained to the dog.
“Right, so Umbridge can now be plan B, I have a better plan,” Harry announced, walking back in the direction of the Gryffindor tower.
“It’s impossible not to know the best spots for books?” Draco finished, smiling as Harry rambled.
“It appears, that all they wished to do, was make an example of Harry,” Lupin said, as Sirius muttered something to Harry no one else heard. “An abysmal one at that.”
comment, internally trying to figure out a witty response.
“Merlin Hermione, warning please,” he shivered, before realising what she just said. “Wait, a minute,” he looked at Harry for confirmation and Harry just sighed.
, at least I’ll die an honest man,” he proclaimed, wiping an imaginary tear from his right eye.
“He was, yeah,” Harry said, though when he was cleaning Grimmauld Place all those years ago, he had found letters which would suggest they had been more, but that was a conversation for another day. “Did Hagrid mention the one where they messed with the school’s clocks?”
“Top secret,” Draco said, trying not to laugh as he made eye contact with Harry.
“I’m sorry Harry, I’ve put you on the spot,” Hermione said, wincing slightly.
Saving him from the continuation of this awkward conversation, Rose and Hugo burst in through the door, carrying a Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes version of Jenga, that explodes as it falls and has other additions such as random wobbling and screeching.
Draco groaned. “I guess that’s fair. What about you, which house do you like the sound of?”
Harry furrowed his eyebrows - Draco thought it was adorable. “A void?” he asked.
is, you don’t have to apologise for him just because he’s in your house,” Harry said, offering a smile which Draco returned.
grind the sneezewort,” he sneered, glancing at what he was doing.
The wind by the lake was cold.
anything about Kreacher,” Harry asked, refusing to take his eyes off Malfoy for a second.
As soon as he was at the front of the classroom, Harry downed the potion, which tasted like burnt toast, and was pleasantly surprised when nothing happened. Then he wondered what it was that everyone else had felt after taking the potion.
“Potter,” Malfoy hissed.
“He is home sir,” he mumbled, angry at himself for telling Draco the truth. Harry felt his entire body relax and his eyes sting; Sirius was safe.
“Apples, actually,” Draco grinned. “Cinnamon tends to go beautifully with apples.”
“I don’t think any of them were particularly sensible,” Harry said, smiling at Teddy who looked at him in exasperation.
The pale sunlight flooded into Harry’s bedroom, catching the specks of dust as they drifted across the room. A muffled noise of cars from the streets below Grimmauld Place broke the silence as Harry pulled the covers over his head to block out the sun, hoping to ignore his responsibilities. However, when he could still feel the sunlight on his skin, beckoning him out of bed, he groaned and rolled to his side, picking up a pillow and pulling it over his head. He wished he could sleep in or perhaps even take a walk around London and he had been meaning to reorganise the kitchen.
“Malfoy!” Ron exclaimed. “He followed you?” he asked, looking as bewildered as Harry felt.
“Pansy, maybe Blaise,” Draco said absentmindedly. “Would that be all right?”
“Well I hate to tell you this Harry, but you are very oblivious,” Draco smirked.
“What do you –
Teddy started to cry harder at Harry’s words, and it was at that very moment that Harry realised he hadn’t ever
Teddy nodded. “Nice to meet you too,” he said quietly, with a nervous smile.
“Well, you’re not going to like – is that Harry?” he heard Remus ask, probably gesturing to Sirius’ shard of the mirror.
It took Draco a moment to realise he was no longer alone. “Hello,” the person said, their voice soft and quiet, and yet Draco still tensed. “I’m sorry to intrude, you can tell me to bugger off –
“Are you worried he’s going to be jealous?” Ron asked, suddenly understanding Harry’s concerns.

“Believe it or not Potter, I don’t particularly care for my father’s ideology,” Malfoy said, regaining some of his composure.
“Are you sure it’s not you, Ferret Face?” Harry teased back.
“Mate, how is this going to be helpful?” Ron asked, as Harry began to throw things out of his trunk.
“I’m going to be learning
Draco sighed, not really wanting to admit she was right.

He hadn’t.
“Good,” she smiled. “But it also does more than bring light in the dark; it powers their technology, such as television,” Andromeda explained. “Muggles may not have magic but that doesn’t mean they are imbeciles Draco, you must understand,” she insisted.
Draco shook his head in amused disbelief and pocketed his new wand.
“For the last time Pansy, I’m
And Harry fell asleep to the soft sounds of Draco’s records and his breathing.
-----
“We don’t have all day Potter, are you staying or not?” Malfoy sighed, leaning his elbows on the counter, making the action of leaning against a counter seem regal. The shop had a few people sat in the back, and there was a very comfortable looking sofa by an empty fireplace.
Ron stared at Harry, his face twisted and his eyes wide. “Harry, I –“
Draco stared at him with a small frown for a few seconds longer, before standing. “I hate to kick you out, but I need to close. If I’m late to pick up Scorpius, my mother will begin to fret about my whereabouts,” Draco said, sounding as if he wanted to stay open a little while longer.
He almost cried when he heard Sirius’ voice calling out through the mirror. He felt as if he had walked into the Gryffindor common room, the heat of the fires washing over his body and his shoulders relaxing. Sirius wasn’t alone when he returned, as Remus was sat next to him, looking worse for wear.
Before he could talk himself out of it, he used some of his Gryffindor bravery and turned to face Malfoy. “Can I kiss you?” he asked, his face feeling as hot as the sun.
“You liked it?” Malfoy asked, his voice raising an octave and a blush creeping across his face.
“I may have been awful at charms, but I was the best at defence,” Harry retaliated, snorting as Draco raised his eyebrows. “Besides, George has been trying to get word activated charms to work on objects for years, he couldn’t quite figure it out,” Harry said. He remembered the meals at the Burrow where George would complain about how it ‘
“Malfoy,” Harry replied, grinning as Malfoy’s cheeks turned slightly pink.
“This is a complete rip-off of a Tale of Two Cities,” Draco said, as he placed a book Harry couldn’t see the cover of, back on the shelf. “A blatant one at that, too,” he muttered, scowling at the book, as though it had personally offended him. “People could at least have some creativity and change the names of the characters
“Umbrellas,” Harry said candidly, grinning when she looked at him exasperated.
“That’s an understatement,” Pansy drawled, rolling her eyes. “Do you remember when we were four and that
“You have such little faith in me,” Harry said, shaking his head, levitating a branch to the knot between the roots of the tree.
It had been almost a week, and he knew he
, cruel in some respects,” she said, her words calculated, as if there were stronger words she would use around someone who wasn’t a fifteen-year-old. “He never told me his reason for leaving the family, or even if it was his choice.”
Pansy looked unconvinced but nodded. “Maybe you should, I’ll visit you tomorrow,” she said, putting her coat on to leave. She gave Draco a warm hug as Scoripus came over to say goodbye.
“But if anyone can help, it’s Sirius and Remus.”
Ted glanced at Andromeda. “You mean…?”
the hat asked.
“Thanks Potter,” he replied, leaning forwards, and connecting their foreheads. Harry’s breath hitched and his face burned. Harry’s stomach flipped and a smile creeped its way onto Harry’s face as they stayed like this for a little while longer.
read,
Add the complications of Malfoy’s warning, and he felt as if his head were about to explode.
He couldn’t.
“Auntie Pansy agrees with Miss Luna,” Scorpius nodded, and Harry smirked at Malfoy who glared at Harry, daring him to agree.
Harry opened his mouth to explain, as best he could, the best way to drink sencha, but the other woman beat him to it. “Don’t worry about explaining it to us dear, Draco’s explained it to us many times,” she chuckled, and Harry couldn’t help joining in.
When Harry had finished his day, feeling both relieved and slightly exhausted, he arrived home to see Genevieve (Teddy’s owl), perched on a chair in his kitchen, a letter tied to her leg.
“Stay,” Harry said, despite only moments ago wanting Malfoy to leave. Maybe the potion was somewhat to blame. He saw Malfoy raise an eyebrow and he groaned. “I’m not too keen on destroying a classroom Malfoy.”
Draco stiffened slightly, then rubbed the bridge of his nose with a sigh. “I got a letter this morning, after breakfast,” he explained. “She’s staying with a friend of hers in France,” Draco stopped, his fingers tangled in Harry’s hair, unmoving. “She wants me to join her as soon as.”
Ron turned to Harry. “You’ve met someone, haven’t you?” he asked, as soon as Rose and Hugo were completely out of earshot, a spark of something in his eye.
Harry felt his face burn. “If we ever reach that point, I guess he’ll be the one to ask first,” he joked, trying to ignore the fluttering in his stomach at the notion.
However, it happened again, and again, and again, until Pansy was tired of hearing Draco pretend it wasn’t happening, “OK that’s it, Draco
“A real shame that I enjoy your company, despite you having all the grace of a flobberworm,” Draco interrupted with a sigh, making Harry chuckle. “Oh well, I guess if I have to.”
With a hum, Draco tilted his head towards Harry, their noses almost touching. “Still filled with ‘subtle’ gay undertones,” Draco shrugged, quickly turning his head to look at the pages again, a blush creeping onto his cheeks.
Harry glared playfully at Draco. “No,” he deadpanned, and Draco looked shocked for a minute before realising Harry was being sarcastic.
When Malfoy didn’t elaborate, Harry let the subject go. “So, why peppermint tea?”
The shop felt loved, as if everything about the shop had been carefully thought out to make each person who entered as comfortable as possible.
“Why don’t you go talk to Mrs Drooble for a minute ma petite étoile?” Malfoy encouraged, his eyes flickering from Harry to his son.
A woman met them at the entrance to the Great Hall, greeting them with a small smile, although the rest of her features told Draco she was rather stern. She held herself high and whilst she didn’t appear to have the same grace as his mother, she held herself with a certainty and confidence that impressed Draco.
“I’m going to leave now,” Draco announced, smirking as Harry rolled his eyes.
ago, and just said she had a headache,” Ron interrupted, smiling slightly as he tried to catch his breath. Hermione blushed. “But I said it might be best for someone to escort you to the hospital wing or the common room, just in case.”
She shrugged. “It’s not played on a board, but… I suppose it is,” she replied, getting up off the sofa to help her two children set up.
“What does spontaneous mean?” Scoripus asked in a whisper to Draco, not wanting to interrupt the conversation.
Harry sat on the bank, just a few feet from Draco. “I didn’t know anyone else would be here,” he said, as the wind turned into a soft breeze.
“It’s Mrs Drooble,” Malfoy said, noticing Harry watch the old lady. “She’s going to hold me in the clutches of her conversation for the next four hours at least.”
Andromeda smirked. “Draco,” she replied. “I may consider you family, Harry, but if you break that boy’s heart I will personally see to your demise,” she said coolly, before smiling softly at Harry. “Not because I value him more than you, dear, but because it will be the biggest mistake you’ve ever made,” she added, probably upon seeing Harry’s stricken face. “Scorpius wasn’t the only one who wouldn’t stop talking about you,” she chuckled, her laugh like wind chimes.
nonsense about Nargles and
“Only if you promise not to go either,” Harry said stubbornly.
“Do you know what house he’ll be in?” Blaise asked. Unlike Pansy, Blaise was completely unfazed and seemed to genuinely want to know about Draco’s new friend.
“Tell me about it,” Draco smirked. “My Mother can’t talk to me, I’ve been disowned, I’m living with my estranged, fugitive cousin and a band of merry misfits.” That made Harry snort. “And all I thought I’d do with my time is sit in a library.”
There wasn’t much which could be said about Draco Malfoy; he was a rather average wizarding child after all. He knew all about Quidditch and he knew a few basic spells; his mother, Narcissa, adored him, heart and soul, and his father, Lucius, explained to him how the world worked.
Harry nodded, humming. “Told me to be thankful for my memory,” he said, glancing over at them to see they were deep in conversation.
Harry snorted. “Really? Who?” he challenged, letting go of Draco’s hand.
“That’s more than most,” Draco said softly, a small smile on his lips. “I’ll just be a moment, we can talk more over tea,” he said, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat.
He nodded, his words failing him for a moment. “Thank you, Draco,” Harry said as they reached the door leading to the corridor.
As Pansy went back to her sighing, Draco tried, albeit apprehensively, to levitate the box again. ‘It’s an easy spell Draco, come on,’ he thought to himself as the box slowly lifted off the ground. He sighed an internal sigh of relief although, he was certain he couldn’t raise it as high as he could before, but he shrugged off the feeling.
“Yes,” Draco said. “And stop
“And he might be,” Ron chipped in. “Jealous, that is, at the start, but you just have to assure him,” he explained. “When Hugo was born, Rose was insufferable about it at times, because Hugo got more of our attention.”
“Me too,” he said. “Is that the teashop?” he asked, pointing to the shop across the road.
Ron shrugged, leaning back into the sofa. “There aren’t many places that we can actually get into – locked rooms and all that,” he explained, his eyes flickering to Harry.
Breaking eye contact, Harry ran his fingers through his hair. “I had no idea you could speak French,” he said, sparing a quick glance at Draco, only to feel his face flush as Draco pushed his green hair from his forehead, watching Harry with amusement.
“Perhaps it’s bad craftsmanship,” Draco teased with a sly smile as Harry glared back playfully.
“I did think he was trying to kill me at the time, so I don’t think the décor was much of a focal point,” Harry chuckled, as they exited the shack, but not before donning the invisibility cloak. Being this close to Draco made Harry’s head spin and he revelled in the warmth emanating from the blond.
With a quick explanation to Scorpius, Harry headed to the counter, picked up an apron that was hanging from the wall, and quickly picked up a tray before Draco could.
He wanted his mother to tell him it was okay.
“Oh, yeah – yeah o’ course,” Harry could hear the distress in Ron’s voice. “I’ll – um – I’ll be here if you – when you come back.”
Narcissa looked between Andromeda and Draco, eventually giving in with a sigh. Draco practically jumped with glee. “Auntie, Auntie!” he exclaimed, rushing to her side. “Is it true you live with Muggles?” he asked.
“Dad!” Teddy called out, as an owl swooped into the kitchen, his eyes following it as it perched on one of the chairs around the table.
“Do you really think your family would do that?” Andromeda asked, as if the very notion was ridiculous.
He sighed, standing up from the table. “I’m going for a walk,” Draco said, fastening his cloak around his neck. “Maybe we will,” he said, shooting Pansy a wobbly smile.
Mildly flustered, Draco made a noise, somewhat resemblant of a ‘
Draco wanted to ask why he didn’t wish to live with his Aunt and Uncle, but thought that would be a little invasive. There was usually something left unsaid in a conversation, and Draco had learnt that asking a question about it, usually didn’t answer the question.
On the other side of the shard, Harry could see Sirius’ eyes flicking between the two, debating on who to direct his questions at. “It’s not your fault Cub, none of it is,” Remus said, placing a hand on Sirius’ shoulder to tell him not to ask any questions yet.
,” he muttered. “He’s never going to let me live this down,” he complained, making the other three chuckle.
to do everything yourself, if someone can get you out of there, let them.” He had spoken softly, but his words hit Harry like a ton of bricks and despite the words clawing at his throat, he couldn’t speak.
Harry couldn’t help being charmed by this blond child. His enthusiasm about dragons and clear adoration of his father melted Harry’s heart and it was only when Harry realised he had run out of tea, that he noticed how long he had been listening to Scorpius ramble.
“She sounds wonderful,” Harry said, trying to ignore the feelings of jealousy for this mysterious woman.
However, he was unsure if what his father told him was true. Lucius said that all Muggles were lesser, or at least, he implied it rather heavily. Draco had been told many times that he was superior because his blood was what Lucius called ‘pure’, which basically meant that all of his relatives were magic. Though to say that made him superior – Draco felt that statement wasn’t true.
“Yes, I am,” Harry said, smiling.
“Come on ‘Mione, I’m practically a lost cause,” Ron groaned making Harry bite back a laugh. It was true, Ron’s worst subject at the moment was Potions, which was saying something with Umbridge as the Defence teacher.
Narcissa sighed. “I apologise dear,” she said, placing her teacup on the table to brush her hands on her robes. “But you know your Father will never allow it,” she explained, beckoning Draco to her side. “You understand right?”
“But, aren’t Muggles bad?” Draco asked. It had been the only explanation for his father’s disdain.
Absolutely not Potter, you’ll make a mistake at some point,” he insisted, staring intently at his two cards.
“So we should avoid those rooms then,” Harry joked, making Draco snicker.
“I’m not
It wasn’t long before Andromeda joined them in the living room, throwing herself at the armchair in the corner (but with the grace of a Black). “
“I guess that’s a no too?” Draco asked.
“I’m glad you’ve made some good friends, kiddo,” Harry smiled, ruffling Teddy’s hair, making him chuckle.
“Anytime Draco,” Harry smiled. “Besides,” he said, picking up the teapot. “I can see why you love this teashop so much,” he shrugged, leaving Draco with an amused, but perplexed look on his face.
“I’m not worried that he knows about Kreacher, Cissy has visited before,” he trailed off as Harry nodded.
Draco didn’t have an answer.
,” he began. “It’s clearly a cat.”
They both faltered.
Ron laughed at Draco’s sudden change in demeanour and Harry joined in, chuckling a little. “I’m Harry Potter,” Harry said, offering a hand to Draco, who froze at the name. It was only for a short moment, but Draco knew Harry noticed, as he started lowering his hand.
spell, Harry looked around to make sure they were going unnoticed. “Don’t tell your Grandma about this,” he winked, causing Teddy to grin.
“In the summer,” Draco mumbled. “I just – you needed to know, in case it...”
The snow was yet to melt over the grounds of Hogwarts, dampening everyone’s post-Christmas mood – which no one thought could get any lower with the return of Umbridge’s Defence lessons. No one was seen in the corridors without a hat and scarf, and friend groups huddled in front of any available heat source.  Fred and George had tried to lift peoples spirits with an impromptu snowball fight that almost got the entire school involved, but Professor McGonagall swiftly put a stop to it when Lee and Fred created a snow canon that George then levitated around the battlefield, hitting all unsuspecting students with a blizzard of snowballs – she said it was due to safety concerns, but Harry suspected she didn’t want to give Umbridge an excuse to expel them.
“The Howlers?” he asked, confused.
“You forgot to mention that moonstone isn’t just a gem, but besides that you’ll get a passing mark,” Draco smiled.
“Potter, I take it a back, you’re brilliant. Now give me the jam tarts.”
“You’re going to laugh,” he grimaced, burying his face in his hands.
“You wouldn’t be,” Harry interrupted. “It’s mainly just me and Teddy anyway.”
, and then dinners with Ron and Hermione where Ron would complain about George complaining.
There it was again, the fluttery feeling in his chest. Draco wondered if he was coming down with something.
to add to the confusion. “I hope you appreciate this,” Malfoy said, taking a deep breath. “Don’t trust Kreacher Harry, there are many Blacks he can listen to and he tends to have a habit of lying to anyone else.”
“You would be,” Draco murmured, avoiding Harry’s gaze as well as Harry was avoiding his – which is to say, rather badly.
“When are you leaving?” Ted asked, still appearing to be processing what Andromeda had said.
“You’re insufferable,” Draco said, but Harry knew he was smiling.
Harry’s jaw practically hit the floor. “I – you – it didn’t – what?” he stumbled over his words, watching as Draco looked more and more worried.
“I’ll keep you safer than the safest,” he shrugged, and Harry looked bewildered. “Come on Potter, I never back down from a challenge,” he said, his smirk widening into a grin.
“Sirius and I have been looking into the process of adoption and seeing if there’s a loophole surrounding my –
,” he began, before realising Malfoy wasn’t talking about his outburst in the Potions classroom anymore. “Thanks, I guess,” he said, unsure of what his response should be. He knew what Malfoy was implying. His father was a Death Eater… but what was Harry supposed to say to that? ‘
Malfoy tutted. “
“You felt, okay?” Draco asked, furrowing his eyebrows.
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, I just offered for you to wake me up at a Godforsaken time in the morning because I’m bored,” he deadpanned, his tone making Harry laugh and duck his head. “Of course I mean it!”
“I have to disagree,” Draco said.
Sipping his tea, he wondered what his mother was doing right now with Scorpius. He had decided that whilst he was revising, it would be best if Scorpius spent the time with Narcissa during the day. Scorpius had told him all about how yesterday she let him hover around on a broom (much to Draco’s disapproval) and how he had helped her in the garden. He hoped that if he passed these exams, he’d be able to spend more time with Scorpius as he spent too much of his time studying.
“You’re not killing my Aunt and Uncle Draco,” Harry said for what felt like the millionth time.
Draco had been shown to his dormitory, but he didn’t stay once everyone had fallen asleep and he returned to the common room. Even in his tired, confused state, he appreciated the warmth and the soft glow of the Hufflepuff common room.
Harry glared at him. “Git,” he mumbled, but a smile tugged at his mouth when Draco laughed.
Harry tilted his head. “Really?”
“Because it was Malfoy?” he asked, a knowing glint in his eyes.
As Draco noticed Harry staring, he began rubbing the tattoo, a grim smile pulling at his features. Once again, he answered the question on Harry’s mind before he even got the change to ask it. “They’re Narcissus flowers, after –“
“I’m not… too sure…” Draco replied, but his focus was on Harry, who was staring at his hands and now glued to Draco’s side.
Harry laughed, not removing his eyes from the horizon as Draco sat next to him. “Wouldn’t want you messing up your hair,” he teased.
Malfoy sighed and offered a tired smile. “You didn’t expect to see me as much as I didn’t expect to see you Potter, I can imagine this is a bit of a shock,” he said, and Harry thought he was mocking him, but then he saw that Malfoy wasn’t sneering. Malfoy looked rather worried.
“It’s not as if I can’t pay for them,” Draco said, glancing at Harry, who was rolling his eyes.
“Are you sure you’re all right mate?” Ron asked for the third time as they were sat in a corner of the common room playing exploding snap. “I know you say you are, and you say you don’t want to talk about it –“
“Sorry, thinking about something someone told me,” Harry grinned.
Pansy rolled his eyes. “You two are as eloquent as ever,” she said. “
“You’re an apple fiend then?” Harry grinned.
He grabbed at his hair, feeling a sob scratch in his throat.
“You might?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Thank you,” Harry said softly, sitting down next to Teddy. “I’m sure you’ll love them.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at this. Scorpius usually took a while to warm up to people. He would ask them questions and was an excitable child, but it took a while for him to like them or trust them. Sadly, he had become aware of the snide comments some would make at his dad which made him rather wary of strangers.
“You’re one to talk, can you even name the pieces?” Blaise asked, raising an eyebrow.

scream at him.
Harry shrugged. “Maybe?” he said, bringing his knees up to his chest. “Ron and ‘Mione probably know, sort of, and Draco’s suspicious but he doesn’t push for answers.”
– Death Eater. No one was exactly eager to let me join,” Draco spoke as if this were a reasonable response but by Harry’s expression, he could tell he thought otherwise but was wondering whether to say anything.
“You have a son?” Potter asked.
Harry chuckled. “It’s okay,” he said, knowing it would be hypocritical of him to say anything else. “I’m no stranger to accidental magic. When I was just a bit older than you, I accidentally set a python on my cousin.”
“I don’t need protecting Potter, have you
“Merlin Potter.” It was Malfoy, which only increased his unstable emotional state. “Right, well I don’t have a death wish,” he muttered, pulling the door to as he hopefully, turned to leave. Harry couldn’t tell for sure, as he was facing in the opposite direction.
a lot to deal with - also, I bring you hot chocolate and watch you read, so we’re both avoiding reality a little bit,” he grinned. Draco rolled his eyes, wondering if he could return his crush to a shop of some kind.
Harry smiled again and nodded. “Only if you want to though.”
Harry grinned. “Not really, no,” he said, dealing out seven cards to Sirius. “Besides, you said you’re a playing card master.”
As they were now at the very back of the shop, Harry suddenly realised they hadn’t seen another person for the entire two hours they had been in the shop. Not that he minded, but it did seem a little odd. It was useful now that they wanted to use a little magic.
“I don’t think I could if I tried,” he said honestly.
“It’s just,” Harry began, running his fingers through his hair. He hadn’t been able to voice these concerns with anyone and he was practically bursting. It may seem as if they were moving quick, but in reality, that wasn’t it at all. “I really like Draco, and Scorpius is a great kid but Teddy comes first and if he doesn’t like them then –“
“I won’t,” she replied, and Draco felt his stomach drop. “But you won’t be alone, in fact, you’ll just be with more of our estranged family.”
Unsure of what to say, Draco moved over in the bed and patted next to him. Harry hesitated, but, after Draco gestured for Harry to come over, he closed the door.
,” he said.
“And I still do,” Harry said, looking at Ron.
“I was going along the lines of her being female, but that works too,” Draco grinned. “Anyway, they’ve agreed to let me stay for the summer, and that’s more than I could have asked for.”
Draco was unsure how to respond.
“You’re cousins, aren’t you?” he asked, as if he should have remembered sooner.
“He’s six years old,” Draco said, before adding. “Although he’s six and a half if you ask him,” he chuckled, remembering the look of offense on Scorpius’ face when his dad said he was only six years old.
catches me,” Rose complained, kicking at the floor with the sole of her feet.
“Let me guess, ‘
It was a circular room, with sofas and lounge chairs huddled around the three fireplaces, placed as far as they could be from the entrance. There was a balcony surrounding the room, with multiple window seats and giant oak doors where you could find your dormitory. Each window was large and circular just allowing you to see the ground and the stars. In the centre of the common room, on the ceiling, was a sunroof which illuminated the growing plant life with moonlight as it curled around the wooden and stone support beams.
“That isn’t what I meant, and you know it young man,” she chastised, swatting the side of his head.
“I’m starting to have second-thoughts,” he stated bluntly, rolling up his sleeves. “
He hated this feeling. He tried to bury this feeling for as long as he could. He hated this feeling more than any other.
Trying his best not to seem confused, he slowly nodded. “I think Scorpius would like that,” he replied, knowing that it would be good for Scorpius to be around someone of a similar age.
Harry pointed a finger at him. “Your smile says otherwise,” he said, raising an eyebrow with a smirk.
Andromeda chuckled. “Neither did I.”
“I’m afraid that’s not how it works trésor,” Draco replied, looking a little flushed, avoiding Harry’s eye. “Quand Harry s'en va, le cerf s’en ira aussi,” he said, stroking his son’s hair out of his face. Harry perked up at his name, but he knew absolutely no French.
“Of course I’m safe Cub, why wouldn’t I be?” Sirius asked, trying to sound calm and playful, but his eyes deceived him.
team off their broom and,
“I agree, you’re both clearly mad about each other,” Zabini grinned, and Harry chuckled.
“I’d say we’ve spent enough time thinking about the war,” he said, hoping Malfoy would understand what he was saying. He had spent too long dwelling on the war and its consequences.
Harry shrugged, but then realised Draco couldn’t see him shrugging. “Apparently,” he said, smiling.
“Rose, you can’t jump at Harry every time you see him,” Hermione scolded, looking at Harry apologetically.
“I don’t think I’m that desperate for a hug,” Draco replied, raising an eyebrow at his cousin.
“No, Daddy says it’s for different reasons,” the boy said, shaking his head. Harry furrowed his eyebrows for a moment, until he realised what the boy meant.
The tree branches were swaying slowly as the early sunlight of dawn illuminated the leaves, scattering the light across the street. There was the faintest sound of bird song, and a dog barking. It was all strangely comforting.
Smiling back, Draco leaned towards Harry to kiss him, but Harry placed a finger on his lips. “Now head to class!” Harry instructed, watching as Draco tried to keep his composure and not laugh.
requests like being allowed to eat every day or have clothes that fit!” he snarled, his breathing shallow as his anger swelled inside of him like a balloon. “
“You were a pretty cute ferret,” he said, chuckling as Draco looked disgusted.
The first time he noticed something was wrong was when he moved into his new apartment. Scorpius was dancing around the apartment, making sure not to get under his dad’s feet as he levitated boxes into their designated rooms whilst Pansy said she was helping – in reality she was lying on the sofa, avoiding going to work. Draco smiled as he saw the grin on Scoripus’ face, who was now sitting on a stool by the kitchen counter.
They sat in silence for a minute as Sirius gathered his thought. Harry began to play with the tassels on the ends of his curtains.
Draco brought his thumb to his mouth, chewing at his nail before sighing. “It’s difficult not to, isn’t it?” he asked. “I mean, it might not even happen, but to dwell on
Furrowing his eyebrows, Harry felt the pit in his stomach grow. “It’s okay, I quite like being an Auror,” he shrugged. The sentence felt strange to say.
Draco frowned, lifting a hand to run through Harry’s hair. “It really is atrociously unkept,” he said, leaning into Harry, who blushed. “Have you even heard of a comb?”
To say Draco was puzzled would be an understatement. “Why does he care?” Draco asked. It wasn’t that he was ungrateful for the concern, but Dumbledore had never once even pretended to care much about what he did.
