It could’ve stayed at that. Harry enjoyed the kiss, maybe Draco had enjoyed it too, but ultimately, they would go their separate ways.
“Happy to see me, Potter?” Malfoy said, feeling his cock with his knee through the uniform pants. Now it was Harry’s turn to let out a shaky breath. He was hard indeed, he had been waiting for a moment like this all week.
As soon as they entered, the seamstress swooped down, ushering them to the fitting area and asking for their tastes and wishes.
“Listen, Draco, I have a solution to your issue. I have a place for you to go to over the summer. It has excellent protection, far better even than if you went to France—it’s frankly the only sensible option, as far as I can see.”
“The Unbreakable Vow that Narcissa swore before I brought her here included the vow that she’ll never betray anyone in this house. When she told me that you— When she said what she said, she betrayed you. You clearly did not want me to know and trusted her to keep it to herself—when she broke that trust, she broke the vow.”
All at once, the mood in the room shifted. Severus took a few deep breaths before he began to speak. He recounted his late arrival, which warranted his first punishment, the failed mission and the Dark Lord’s resulting bad mood. He told them about how the other Death Eaters had been tortured before the Dark Lord had turned to him. At that point, he shot a cautious glance at Narcissa.
“No! Of course not!” cried Severus. “I was as surprised as you were when Albus told us about those charms.” He took a deep breath to steady himself. “Alright, fine. I’ll tell you, so you can leave me well alone afterwards. Lily came to me the night before her wedding, after I hadn’t seen her in years. She wanted to say goodbye, we— We got close. Then I never saw her again. It happened
“Still, somehow something changed. Maybe it’s because he’s suddenly not acting like such a git anymore—but then again the only reason he’s changed his attitude is because I’m his son, so wouldn’t that bring us right back to the start? That it’s all because we’re bound by blood? I still think that’s bullshit. It’s just so
. I’ve never seen anyone dance for so many hours without falling over from exhaustion. But she’ll talk your ear off if you let her.”
“Muggle stores are closed on Sundays,” Harry said with a chuckle. “Guess wizards don’t really care about ‘on the seventh day you shall rest’ and all that.”
of wordless spells, everything else had just kind of worked for him. He really hadn’t even thought about the fact that he was casting wordlessly when he’d summoned that Patronus to call for Remus’ help.
She stared at him wide-eyed. He wasn’t sure how to interpret her tone when she finally asked, “And it works?”
“One more time, as always,” Severus retorted, but a smile spread on his face even as he said it. “How was your summer? I haven’t seen you at any Order meetings.”
“You do like them then?” asked Harry, his voice a little husky in a way that sent shivers down Draco’s spine.
Harry didn’t hesitate, sneaking his hand inside Draco’s pants and wrapping his fingers around him. It felt odd, holding another man’s cock instead of his own, but it was as amazing as it was strange.
“Sure, you do that,” Severus answered dismissively, his thoughts already elsewhere. He had to talk to Albus about this plan, immediately. Although he was fairly sure Albus would approve of saving Draco from having to take the Dark Mark, he was hesitant to give definitive promises to Draco before discussing it with the headmaster first. Still, if it all worked out Narcissa had to be ready.
“If he came here to officially instate you as his Named Heir, as this paper shows, he would have had to see this paper to do so. He knew that Severus was your father. Your mother must have told him and he must have decided to make you his heir anyway, because he loved you like his own.”
With a mischievous grin Harry shook his head. “I want to look at you, baby. So bloody gorgeous, and all mine.”
“Well, stop it, will you?” Scorpius shouted, slamming his pencil down on the table. His father jumped, startled by the sound. “You always tell me I can do whatever I put my mind to, and to not let my arm make me feel weak, but that’s exactly what you’re doing: making me feel like I can’t do anything on my own!” The boy rarely raised his voice, so the fact that he was doing so now made Draco realize just how much he had disappointed his son with his overprotectiveness.
“You’re a bloody good dad,” Harry said, scooping up Draco’s hand with his own and twining their fingers together. “Scorp talks about you all the time, and it’s clear he adores you.”
“He will be,” Harry assured Draco, tapping his finger against the ink wrapped around the blond man’s forearm. “This says it all.”
Draco was silent for a moment, thinking over the events from the previous evening until now. “Did you ask the barista to curse me?” He asked.
Once the kids had tired of the slide, Albus clambered up onto Draco’s shoulders and Scorpius onto Harry’s, and the four played a violent game of chicken in the pool. The boys screamed as they attempted to push each other into the water, but with their fathers holding tightly to their legs, neither was unseated – that is, until Draco waltzed right into Harry’s space and planted a smacking kiss on his cheek, prompting Potter to reach out and yank Malfoy into a tight hug.
It was certainly not his style; the flat he and Scorpius lived in was minimalist and modern, with sleek furniture and shiny chrome appliances. Potter’s house was bursting with colour and texture, featuring bright walls and eclectic decor. Draco found comfort in the peace and order of his home, but could also see the merit in a warm, cozy space where children could play without fear of breaking things or making a mess. He understood now why Scorpius preferred hanging out at Albus’ after school instead of at their flat.
“Luck, and the fact that he’s worked his arse off in therapy,” Draco nodded, watching his son more closely. The blond boy’s cheeks were rosy, and his eyes sparkled as he and Al kept up their trick shots with the balloon. He was using his right hand as much as his left, and didn’t seem to be struggling at the moment, which he agreed was good.
If there was one thing Draco hated, it was being indebted to people. His father had taught him that to owe someone a favour was dangerous, especially when that someone was important, and Draco had seen first-hand the consequences of refusing to pay back what was owed. Yet despite his pleading, none of his other colleagues were willing or able to take over for him. (Secretly, he thought some of them might be saying no just to take the piss.) He wracked his brain, trying to come up with a solution that didn’t end with a group of crying children, or with him covered in glitter.
,” Draco growled under his breath. Harry grimaced sympathetically, understanding that the dynamic between Draco and his ex was far from friendly. “I’ll make he extends his gratitude to Albus for sharing, but thank
As they stepped out of the house and crossed the wooden deck, Draco caught sight of his son, whose blond hair reflected sunlight like snow. He waved covertly at the boy, but received no such subtlety in return.
“Right,” Draco said. “Children will arrive in about 15 minutes, and I’ll come out and introduce you to the children when it’s time for you to start.”
“Sounds like your company does incredibly important work,” Harry acknowledged, impressed by Draco’s eloquent description. “And you’re the CEO of the company?”
“I’m sure you’re very capable, Scorpius,” Draco sighed, scratching at his scalp as he attempted to formulate a legitimate reason – maybe even a decent excuse – to keep his son from attending this party. “I just worry, and it’s because I love you.”
The tattoo Draco had received at 16 – a skull with a snake for a tongue – now looked entirely different than it had when Harry had known Draco in their youth. It was surrounded by a garden’s-worth of colourful flowers: gladiolus, carnations, orchids, aster, peonies, amaryllis, daffodils, lilies and iris, with a beautiful narcissus for his mother, and a single gardenia for Scorpius. The original tattoo was still visible, as a way for Draco to remember the past to which he never wanted to return, but the flowers were a daily reminder that he had grown and changed, and had built a beautiful and happy life for Scorpius and himself.
“Sorry, Mr. Malfoy!” Albus gasped, covering his face with his hands. “Sorry, sorry, sorry, I didn’t realize Scorp was so close to you, or I never would have—”
“I…Scorp, you know I want to say yes,” Draco spoke through his son’s bedroom door, hoping the boy was actually listening, and didn’t have his headphones in or something. “I’m sure everything will be fine at this party, and that nothing will go wrong. I’ll stick with the other adults and leave you to spend time with your friends, alright? You probably won’t even notice that I’m there.”
“I didn’t think you cared much for swimming,” he frowned. Draco was probably just projecting his own distaste for the activity, but he couldn’t imagine enjoying an afternoon being splashed by a pool full of screaming children.
“It was a long time coming,” Harry said, waving him off as he pulled open the door of the fridge. “Once the kids were old enough, we were able to agree that we both deserved a chance to be ourselves, even if we couldn’t do that together. Papers were finalized about six months ago, but we’ve been living separately for nearly two years.”
“Oh, you brought something to share?” Harry asked, taking the wooden bowl from Draco and peering through the cellophane. “Brilliant, I’ll just pop it in the fridge for now so it’ll keep.” A lanky ginger man, undoubtedly a Weasley, took over at the barbecue, and Draco found himself following Potter into the house.
“I mean…I don’t actually have a job, so yeah, I honestly don’t have anything better to do,” Harry said, followed by a long, exaggerated yawn. Draco could hear the smile in Potter’s voice, could imagine him sitting up in bed — in Draco’s bed — bleary-eyed without his glasses on, hair sticking up in all directions. “I thought you left for work?”
“Are you planning to swim today?” Harry asked, watching as Scorpius and Albus took turns doing cannonballs off the low diving board.
Harry and Draco were silent then, both losing themselves in their thoughts as they sat together at the island. Harry had set out a glass of water for his blond companion a few minutes before, but it hadn’t even been touched yet. Draco had almost worked up the courage to continue their conversation when a freckly woman with her hair up in a messy bun opened the back door and poked her head into the kitchen. It had been some time since last they met, but Draco recognized her immediately as Ginny Weasley, the mother of Potter’s three children.
Hermione was responsible for arranging the water games for the party. The water balloons had been stowed in the house for safekeeping, as they weren’t to be used until later. That hadn’t stopped Harry for sneaking out two of the largest balloons – one for him and one for Draco – which were used to pay their sons back for their earlier prank.
“I know you are,” Harry murmured, his eyes crinkling slightly at the corners. “Hermione told me about all the initiatives you’ve made in your company to be inclusive and culturally sensitive, and that’s something you never would have done before.” A curious smirk tugged at the corner of Harry’s lips at his next words. “And I know you’re a huge supporter of the food bank, and the homeless shelter,
Scorpius attended the same small school his father had, so if all the kids his age were attending this party, it was more than likely that Draco would know some of the other parents. He hadn’t been particularly well liked in his time as a student, but he had grown up to become a successful business owner, and had redeemed himself in the eyes of most of his old classmates.
“I’m sure those boys appreciate that you make time for them,” Draco opined, reminiscing to his own relationships with male role models in his teen years. “I had my father and Uncle Severus, of course, but I would have killed to have someone to that cared about me like that when I was in school. I—” Draco paused to debate whether his next words would be received well or not. Historically, Potter hadn’t been particularly receptive to Draco’s sympathy. “I’m sorry you didn’t get that chance, Potter.”
“Have fun setting up your craft,” Harry murmured, his smile crinkling the corners of his eyes. “I’ll come join you when I’ve finished here.”
That was probably the subtlest way Draco could have renounced his father’s snobbish, capitalist (and frankly classist) views on what made a person’s life valuable, but Harry picked up on it.
“Come over to my house for dinner and drinks tonight, and it’s a deal,” Harry offered without hesitation.
“I see. It says here at the bottom that parents are welcome to stay for ‘food and fun’,” Draco read out loud. “It would probably be best if I came along, don’t you think, Scorp? If there are supposed to be many children attending, I don’t trust that there will be enough adults to supervise the pool properly.”
“I think what you meant was, ‘Hello, Harry, don’t you look nice today,’” Harry corrected with an amused smirk. He stepped in close and pressed a single chaste kiss Draco’s pale cheek.
When the boys had run off together, Draco set a hand against his stomach and poked around carefully, ensuring that all his internal organs were still in place. He hadn’t taken a hit like that in quite a while, and though he was much larger than 12-year-old Albus, it still hurt like hell to have a child’s hard skull rammed into his abdomen.
about Scorpius getting into the water brought the memory of the accident in France rushing back, made his heart race.
If Draco was being honest, he had thought once or twice about the possibility that Potter or his children might be at this party. They attended the same school as Scorpius and presumably lived somewhere within or just outside of town. Scorpius had made friends with young Albus Potter, who was in his class. It never occurred to Draco, however, that Potter might be the one
“Everything is a mess,” the woman said fretfully, “two people have called in sick today, and the library pages we’ve hired for the summer haven’t yet finished their orientation!”
“But hey, looks like Scorp’s arm is behaving today,” Harry said, perking up a bit. “He swam in the pool and everything. I know he was nervous that he’d wake up this morning and find that he couldn’t do much with it, but luck was on his side!”
“We’ll just have to drain the pool,” Harry told Draco once the pair had taken their turn down the slippery runway. They tread water together in the middle of the pool, ensuring all the little ones made it safely out of the water after their turn on the slide.
The first game was played in two teams, with each team lined up in front of an empty (but clean) rubbish bin filled with water. The person at the front of the line had to dunk a large sponge into the bin, soak up as much water as possible, and then pass it through their legs to the person behind them. That person would pass it over their head to the next person, who then passed through their legs, and so on and so on. When the sopping sponge reached the last person in the line, it was to be squeezed out into an empty bucket, and then run back to the front of the line for the next round. The winners would be the team that filled their empty bucket first.
“Right. So this is like a delicate baby bird egg, Malfoy,” Harry said, deadly serious. “If you drop it, you’ll have murdered an innocent creature before it even had the chance to fly.” Draco caught the pink balloon in both hands, cupping it as if his hands were a nest.
“Try not to get too distracted, boys,” Hermione called after them in a singsong voice. “There’ll be time enough to flirt to your hearts’ content after the party.” Both men hurried across the garden and into the house to avoid any further comments on their lack of subtlety from observant women and children.
“I think a few families are hosting, actually,” Scorpius deflected, expertly avoiding his father’s question. “It’s a ‘school’s out’, beginning of summer sort of party. There’s supposed to be a barbecue, some water games, and swimming, of course. Everyone in my year was invited.”
Harry and Draco crossed the garden and joined the pair of women who were in the process of filling a large yellow bucket with a rainbow of pastel-hued water balloons. They had about a third of a bucket filled, but that wouldn’t last long; there was nearly a school bus’-worth of kids, from toddlers up to teens, and most would probably join in once balloons started flying. It was pleasantly hot by this point in the day, so those who hadn’t yet taken a dip in the pool would surely find a bit of relief in having a plastic ball of water explode against their faces.
“Well, I didn’t really want to talk about it back then,” Harry said with a shrug. He didn’t seem particularly interested in discussing it now, either. “Anyway, a lot of the kids who I work with are in similar positions, where they live in foster care homes, or with relatives other than their parents and  don’t have the support and guidance they need to help keep them on track in school, or to keep them off the streets and out of gangs. Because I’ve had experience with that sort of thing, the boys find it easier to trust me and are willing to actually work at their lessons.”
“I’m almost certain she did,” Draco agreed. “I don’t understand what she was thinking, though. I’m responsible for purchasing and data entry; I wasn’t hired to sit around and play dolls with children.”
“Hmm,” Draco responded, furrowing his brow as he read over the details of the party. “And who’s hosting this party again? Do I know their parents?”
“I want him to be able to have fun with other kids, but I have to admit, I really didn’t want him to come today,” Draco told his companion. “He said it wasn’t cool of me to insist on coming along, but I knew if I just sat around at home, I would have gone insane with worry. His arm gets funny sometimes, and he can’t predict when it will be fine or when it won’t…” He trailed off, realizing that his heart was starting to race at the very thought of his son’s arm seizing up in the water.
Harry hadn’t withdrawn his hand from Draco’s forearm yet, and the warmth of his fingers against Draco’s tattooed skin sent a delightful tingling sensation rippling through the nerves in Malfoy’s arm. They glanced up in tandem and both leaned in a fraction of an inch, moving as though one were a reflection of the other. Harry’s eyes flickered down to Draco’s lips, made soft and pink by a run of his tongue along them. They watched each other, frozen in time, as though they weren’t standing in the middle of Potter’s bustling yard at a pool party they had been tasked with supervising.
right now, Potter,” Draco complained, tossing the jiggling sphere back to Harry. “I’m 36 years old – I’m quite certain I can figure it out.”
“Does it have anything to do with rhinestones?” Harry wondered, pointing at the single pink sparkle stuck to the sleeve of Draco’s cardigan. “Pink is a lovely colour on you, you know.”
“If we give you a hand, ladies, I’m sure we can have this bucket filled in no time,” Harry suggested. Ginny passed him a full bag of balloons and a faucet adapter to share with Draco, and suggested they use the kitchen sink instead of fighting them for the garden spigot.
“Well, shit,” Draco murmured, setting the party invitation down to free up his hands. He pressed his fingers into his temples and rubbed them in small, circular motions, as if it might change the reality that his son hated his guts at the moment. This whole situation was making him feel so useless as a parent that he was seriously considering giving his mother a call to ask for advice. When it came to dramatic outbursts and the Malfoy family, it was clear that the apple didn’t fall far from the tree.
At first, Harry had been mostly caught up on worries about Sirius’ hypothetical reaction to it all. Remus couldn’t blame him. The grief of Sirius’ death was still so fresh, it was hard to separate it from everything else that was going on. He himself still found it hard to breathe at times, remembering the nights spent with Sirius in this—his room. It wasn’t as bad as he’d expected it to be, which left him feeling an odd mix of relief and guilt. He had lost Sirius before, along with James and Lily and Peter, all of them at once. He had grieved them all, even though Peter hadn’t deserved it as he now knew. He had grieved Sirius, despite believing him to be a traitor at the time, he’d grieved him as if he had died. He had, in a way.
Once more he wished he could see Harry’s face, and even though the sky was definitely getting lighter outside, the room was still nearly dark. Apparently, Harry shared his desire to be able to look at each other, because he rolled away, grabbed his wand from the bedside table and lit the lamps, keeping them low enough to bathe the room in warm, orange light. After returning to his position at Draco’s side, he gave him such a serious look that Draco’s anxiety spiked again. This was the moment where Harry was going to tell him that his interest was only physical, that it was just stress-relief or something like that, but nothing serious, because why the hell would Harry Potter want to actually date Draco Malfoy.
Ginny bristled, put the round little bottle she’d been holding back onto the shelf and snapped, “None of your business!”
Harry held his breath as Draco and Snape spoke the incantation at the same time. The link followed immediately.
He sighed. “I’m alright, really. Not gonna lie, it’s been a lot to take in recently, and I haven’t even told you about everything yet, but I’m managing.”
Finally, Harry laughed too. He handed the scroll back to Burgock, who made a copy of it at the request of Draco’s mother, and then floated it back to its proper place in the shelves. Harry gave her a grateful look as he pocketed the copy, before turning back to Burgock.
On the nightstand he found several vials of healing potions and smiled. They had raided his own lab to save him, good. At least everyone seemed to be comfortable enough with him to take from his stores without hesitation when needed. He downed a Pain-Relieving potion and let out a grateful sigh as the throbbing in his head subsided. To be safe, he also drank an all-round healing drought, just in case any injuries had been overlooked. It wasn’t unlikely to fail to see something minor after being confronted with injuries like the ones he had sustained yesterday. He wasn’t sure how bad it had been, but he knew it must’ve been major, given how muddled his memory was.
To their credit, both Severus and Draco hid their cringes almost perfectly, and Harry could not be bothered to care. As much as he loved his life here at Grimmauld Place, he missed his best friends and almost-family. Although, he supposed he had two almost-families now—the Weasleys, and the five of them currently sitting in this dining room. What an odd assortment of people to become something resembling a family, but for some reason it worked. Now those two almost-families just had to work together somehow as well.
“You need better aim than that if you plan on knocking me out the old-fashioned way,” Draco drawled, letting a smirk tug on his lips.
“Draco!” Severus interrupted Draco’s increasingly frantic rambling. “I understand. Of course I’ll help you, I’m glad you came to me with this. In fact, I was already trying to find a solution, but so far I’ve been unable to find a way to hide both you and your mother.”
Thank you so much for reading and all your kind comments, they make my day every time I get one <3 I'm still in exam phase, but as you can see my brain won't let me stop writing either way.
he thought stubbornly, but his resolve was weakened as the memory of Lily’s dead body flashed before his inner eye. No, he didn’t just need to protect Harry. He also needed to prepare him for war.
On the ground floor the dining room had been abandoned mid-renovation, with wallpapers scattered across the floor and dusty furniture piled up in a corner. The library was just as he’d left it the day before: old musty couches and dark bookshelves. He wondered how many books were in the house if you counted in all the rooms.
“—but I never even tried to act on that. So, I honestly don’t know how any of this is supposed to work. Dating is a mystery to me, so I guess I was hoping we’d just figure that out as we go?”
The door to the potions lab opened and Severus turned to greet Harry, only to find himself looking at Draco instead.
he thought stubbornly, forcing his focus back to Snape, who was giving him a rather odd look. Why was he staring at him so much? He shifted uncomfortably, causing a strand of black hair to fall into his eyes. Right, he didn’t look like himself anymore. Or, well, he hadn’t looked like himself before. Again, he wondered whether the whole world had gone insane, whether they’d inadvertently broken the bloody universe at the Department of Mysteries or something.
“Oi Fred, George,” Ron called, appearing seemingly out of nowhere besides Harry. “How much for this?”
Well, it’s official now! What do you think, how are they gonna deal with it? Poor Harry sure has to process a lot of shit all at once - Sirius, James, Severus, the prophecy, Draco’s pretty eyes…
By lunchtime, Harry had introduced Draco to her, whom she deemed worthy to hold her after Harry translated that Draco found her pretty. If Draco were a Parselmouth, those two would probably get on like a house on fire.
“That’s enough,” Snape said quietly and Harry’s eyes flew open immediately. He took a couple of deep breaths, trying to discreetly stretch the tension out of his shoulders.
He settled Sirona over by the seating area in her basket with a generous warming charm for the night. She seemed quite content, but Harry promised to get her a proper terrarium as soon as he could, which she accepted somewhat hesitantly. Maybe she really was happy as it was.
For a second, regret filled him as he remembered the Manor. Despite his recent negative experiences there, it was his childhood home. Now he would probably never return, or at least not until the war was over, if both him and the Manor survived that.
“Yes, you did. My father was arrested because of you, mother and I were able to get out of the Manor because of you,” Draco’s ranting was growing louder and louder. “Hell, I escaped being forced to take the Dark Mark because of you!”
“Shit, I gotta run. ‘Detention’ and all that.” He gave Draco a quick peck on the cheek, swiping the textbook off the table and into his bag. “You’ll drop by?”
Harry didn’t respond, still looking rather dejected. Draco sighed. The previous day had been a lot for Harry and his night couldn’t have been the most restful either, sleeping on a giant wolf. And even before, Draco had watched Harry’s eyes go vacant sometimes, as if he was a million miles away, and Harry would frown deeply, lost in whatever issue he was pondering. It was no different now. He seemed trapped in his thoughts, and Draco’s reassurances didn’t seem to reach him. Perhaps it was time to get Harry out of his head for a little while, Draco decided.
He tapped the message with his wand to send it and the ink turned from black to sapphire blue. Draco summoned a piece of parchment from his desk and, using the notebook as an underlay, started to write his usual letter to his mother to let her know that he had arrived safely. He’d barely gotten one paragraph down when the notebook gave a soft chime.
“How can you be sure?! For fuck’s sake, how can you just dismiss that possibility without even making sure that you’re right in your assumption? Do you have any idea how unfair this is to Harry? All his life he was alone, wanting nothing more than a family, and you
“We will find a way,” Severus said dismissively, even though his chest tightened at the reminder of how difficult it would be for them to meet each other.
for eleven years. Fresh fury shot through Severus, making his nerves tingle. He should’ve let the old man die from his cursed hand. Severus stood, prepared to march over into the library, reanimate the man forcibly and demand an explanation for it all, but Narcissa swiftly blocked his way.
“A rune-bound, wandless…form?” he asked hesitantly. Harry had told him about those so-called healing forms he’d found, but he had no experience at all in that area and had assumed that it would require a much more advanced understanding of healing than Harry currently possessed.
Several of the group nodded in agreement. Severus didn’t react at all. It seemed like a sensible plan, keeping the boy hidden for now.
For a moment, Draco thought it over, then he shook his head and agreed, “No, you’re right. It’s the only thing that makes sense. Where did you get it?”
Draco tuned out the ensuing conversation during which Daphne resolutely refused to reveal her latest boyfriend’s name while Pansy and Blaise kept pestering her. His thoughts went back to the DA and Theo’s unexpected support for Harry.
His father had positively delighted in the animosity between the children. Looking back, it was completely ridiculous.
Draco was fairly sure he was going insane. How long could it possibly take to get from the headmaster’s office to the seventh floor?
“Thank you, Molly,” said Harry, his voice thick with emotion. “I really needed to hear that, I think. I was worried you wouldn’t— Now that I theoretically have a father, I thought—”
“So, we had to go to Gringotts to pick up some money, right? But you still have my vault key—I’ll need that back, by the way—so I asked the goblins to scan me to confirm my identity.”
Draco looked at him in surprise, snapping his mouth shut. Severus resumed his pacing, mumbling to himself.
Harry didn’t think, probably wouldn’t have been able to think if he had tried, he just moved. His first instinct was to dash to the front door, get out of the house and to safety. But the hallway was wrong, the front door wasn’t where it was supposed to be. Cupboard then, even if that meant being locked in—no, wait, he had a room now, didn’t he? But the cupboard wasn’t there either, and the stairs were in the wrong place. The ringing in his ears was getting louder and his lungs were burning.
Severus cast another glance over at Sirona to make sure that the snake was settled safely out of the way before turning towards the door to the little side-room in his quarters. He hadn’t really ever worked with the castle’s magic before, except when he’d originally set up the wards around his rooms. It was a strange sort of magic, one that he wasn’t familiar with at all.
She smiled sadly. “Because of Draco, of course. Even though Lucius never had any interest to be with me—or any woman, if you understand what I’m saying—he needed to produce an heir. Right after our wedding Lucius consummated our marriage once, magically ensuring that I would give him a male heir. If I had left him, he’d have kept Draco from me, and I could never have abandoned my son.”
Harry beamed at him and kissed him again. It took longer this time before their lips parted again, as both of them seemed to lose themselves in the sensations of wandering hands and dancing tongues. Harry’s hands came to rest on Draco’s hips, pulling him closer as his mouth left Draco’s, wandering down to his neck. A small gasp escaped Draco’s throat as he felt Harry’s teeth against his skin, biting down gently just below his ear. A wave of heat went through him, and before he knew it, he had pushed Harry onto his back, sliding on top of him.
person when it came to sex. He had always favoured non-verbal communication for such things, unless there were explicit boundaries to be discussed with a partner. But most of these conversations had been with Sirius, the man he had made almost all his experience with, the man he had spent half his life sleeping with or fantasising about. A man he knew on that level, on a sexual level. Of course he could talk about sex with people he actually had sex with, but with
Severus watched Harry unwrap his presents with increasing nervousness. Books, clothes, fireworks—all perfectly regular gifts. The longer he watched, the more he began to regret his rather extravagant choice of gift. He’d wanted something special, something useful and unique. And he’d found it, there was no denying that his gift met those two conditions, but he doubted his choice all the same. Even Draco’s gift, although definitely also useful and unique, was much less
Harry still had to smile a little whenever Draco used Hermione’s first name so naturally. How quickly things could change.
The worst thing was that it was nothing but a relief. For a long time, Draco had been struggling to unify his growing discomfort at the bigoted ideals of his father with his unshakeable desire to please the Malfoy Lord. It had proven an impossible task.
He felt a stab of guilt. No, he didn’t hate the boy that much. He hated James Potter, and he’d hated his carbon copy called Harry Potter, because Harry Potter had forced him to look upon the man who’d taken Lily from him again and again. This past week, however, he’d found himself inexplicably drawn to the boy. None of the irritating little habits he used to display, that were so much like James Potter’s, remained.
been hurt, but not as much as Harry. His anger came crashing back into him and suddenly he found himself yelling, “Do you have
“Then allow me this one secret. I must not die from this curse. You, Severus,” Albus said, turning to face him, “you must kill me. Voldemort must believe you are wholly his, he has to trust you with everything. You swore it, Severus, whatever it takes.”
“I forgive you,” said Harry finally, his tone pointedly neutral. Severus could barely believe his ears. “But you have to stop tormenting Neville. And Hermione. I don’t know what she did to make you hate her so much, but she doesn’t deserve it. Neither does Neville. None of the non-Slytherins deserve such condescending treatment, but I won’t ask you to go against Dumbledore if he really thinks— Just leave my friends alone.”
But Draco said none of that, keeping his eyes glued to his plate instead. Harry sighed and squeezed his arm.
“Come on, Draco, it’s our first night back!” Pansy whined, tugging on Draco’s sleeve and gesturing towards their usual spot in the Slytherin common room. “What’s with you today? It’s not like you to miss out on a party.”
Okay, so, *originally* this chapter was supposed to have a little mini-scene at midnight of Draco giving Harry his first present, some fluffy kisses and then the main part was supposed to be Draco facing an army of Weasleys + Hermione. Except that first mini-scene turned into a chapter-length scene with way more angst than intended. Whops.
how would he survive Hogwarts? It wouldn’t just be impossible to fully avoid Draco, the git was bound to spread that story like wildfire, letting the whole school know that Harry had a thing for him. He was probably already writing a letter to Parkins—
“Should we check on Harry?” he eventually asked cautiously, unable to focus on revenge any longer as his worry grew.
“They’re not worth going to Azkaban for,” he replied, returning Draco’s embrace and running a soothing hand up and down his boyfriend’s back. “I’d rather have you with me than locked up for an unnecessary case of triple-murder.”
“Jeez, Malfoy, have you ever heard of knocking before walking into someone else’s room?” Ron asked, his voice tight. “We’re having a private conversation.”
He gave her a pointed look, led them to a somewhat private area of the common room, and cast Muffliato — a spell from the Potions book margins Severus had declared safe to use — before answering, “I was with Draco. You really have to be more careful what you shout about, Hermione.”
They could have met in Harry’s room, of course, but neither of them felt entirely comfortable with invading Severus’ quarters to then utterly ignore the man — and they’d agreed that they needed an evening to themselves.
Harry shook his head. “They don’t care. They knew I was magical but they never told me. To them, magic is just abnormal and I am a freak.”
“It got worse when I started to display accidental magic,” he said ruefully. “I didn’t understand what I was doing, because I didn’t even know magic existed, so I just tried to hide anything odd that happened around me as best as I could. It didn’t really work most of the time, so I spent a lot of time in my cupboard, only to be let out to go to the bathroom twice a day. At least, with missing so many of my classes, I didn’t have to deliberately fail tests anymore to avoid getting better grades than Dudley. And then my Hogwarts letter arrived, which was its own brand of disaster.”
Weasley family, too many mouths that could accidentally let something slip. I promised him to treat his friends more fairly, but ironically the same can’t go for him. At least giving him detention for everything he does will allow me to see him without anyone getting suspicious.”
She gently put a hand on his knee, reassuring him, “You can tell me anything, nobody else will hear, and I will not judge you for your fears.”
That made Severus pause. It was true, his position as a spy might one day very well be the only thing standing between Harry’s life and the Dark Lord.
Morning came far too soon, and Draco would’ve loved to tell everyone to bugger off and just keep Harry in bed with him all day. He was so
Harry had his head in Draco’s lap, entranced in his favourite book—the one in which he’d found that wandless form to heal Severus. Sometimes, Draco wondered if Harry was ever going to read anything else again. But despite his apparent focus on the text, Draco didn’t miss how Harry’s eyes flickered to the clock in regular intervals. They were both waiting for it to strike twelve, for Harry to turn sixteen.
Images bloomed in his mind and his heart began to race. No, he didn’t have any experience, but neither did Draco. They could learn together if he just allowed it, because he was fairly certain that Draco had been holding back for Harry’s benefit, rather than his own. He’d felt enough of Draco’s physical reactions to know that his boyfriend was certainly not unaffected by their snog sessions, no matter how tame they had stayed so far.
how serious they were about their words. He was breathing steadily now, trying to wrap his head around it.
barely attended any. But you haven’t missed much, or at least nothing encouraging—I’m sure Remus told you all about it.”
“You still miss her, I know you do. I remember how close you two used to be, before you’ve had that falling out. Seeing Potter resemble her so much more all of a sudden is bound to bring up old memories.”
He had thought about this quite a bit. As much as he wanted his confession about the prophecy to be over, chances were that Harry would never speak to him again after learning what he had done, and Severus did not want to let the rest of his mistakes be forgotten just like that. Harry deserved an apology for all of it.
“Make no mistake, Potter, when we’re on the pitch this relationship is absolutely irrelevant,” retorted Draco, crossing his arms.
“He knew, Harry. He knew and he loved you anyway, so much that he named you his heir. He didn’t care that you were Severus’ son,” she explained softly, and suddenly Draco understood. Harry wasn’t confused about being the heir to Slytherin, he was confused because he was heir to house Potter.
“Erm—well, I suppose business has been good,” Draco said, considering what he might share about his company. “As Scorpius might have said, my company manufactures pharmaceutical products. When one of the large pharmaceutical companies puts out a new medication, they usually hold a patent on that product for 10 to 20 years, and can therefore determine the cost to consumers. Our company researches, tests, and manufactures generic versions of those medications after their patents expire so that they are available at a more reasonable cost to consumers, which is important because some of these medications are life-saving for the people who take them.”
He arrived at the library where he worked fifteen minutes early, as he did every day. He passed the circulation desk and made for his office, but just as he dipped his hand into his pocket to find his keys, the head librarian came hurrying up to him.
“Huh,” Harry hummed, more to himself than anyone else, holding Draco against him with an arm around the blond’s shoulders. “So this is why Gin said the party had to be on
“You took me out to dinner,” Harry recounted, trying to comprehend Draco’s request, “you took me back to yours, we slept together — which, might I remind you, you said was a one-time thing — and now you want me to come and help you at work?”
When Harry strode through the sliding glass doors, dressed in a clean pair of jeans and a button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows, Draco nearly fell over.
“Teddy, would you mind supervising the pool, please?” Harry called across the way. A young man with teal hair was stretched out on a lounger on the other side of the pool, but at the sound of Harry’s voice, he tossed a thumbs-up in their direction and took his place at the edge of the pool, scanning the water dutifully.
“It’s no problem, really,” Harry assured him, giving Draco’s shoulder a firm squeeze. “Albie is more than happy to share. The kid’s probably got more swimwear than he knows what to do with. He’s got whatever Gin’s bought him, plus James’ hand-me-downs. Proper spoilt, these kids are.”
“I can’t believe I’ve sullied myself with a man who acts like an actual 3-year-old,” Draco bemoaned his lot in life (or at least, his lot at the pool party).
“That does sound like a problem,” Draco agreed, unlocking his office door. Instead of leaving, Maria loitered in his doorway and continued to explain the issue.
Draco walked away with a new spring in his step, and decided nothing could possibly ruin his day now that Harry had swooped in to save it.
“Oh, they’re doing great,” Harry said, very sure of his answer. “They were very understanding when we explained the situation, and we were able to have a bit of a laugh about it all in the end.”
For the next water activity, Hermione had tasked her twin brothers-in-law with setting up a slip-n-slide. She regretted this immediately, because instead of laying the tarp out where she had suggested, the twins brought a tarp that spanned a majority of the garden, and ended in the pool. Because the yard was graded higher on the edges of the property, when the kids would run down the water and dish-soap slicked tarp, they were propelled at high speed downhill, where they fell into the Potters pool in a bubbly mess. Ginny had realized her brothers’ error (well-thought out prank) when she realized that her pool was starting to resemble a bubble bath, but by that point it was too late to do anything about it.
“I resent that statement, Scorpius Hyperion.” Draco scowled, pointing a finger in what little of the boy’s face he could see. “While I will admit to being overdressed at times—”
children’s books, though,” Harry said, having finally curbed his urge to laugh at Draco. “Didn’t you say you read most of the things you purchase?”
The party had been a beautiful disaster, and the perfect way for Harry and Draco to start things over again.
, got into street fights?” Draco repeated, his mouth gaping in disbelief. “I…I never would have thought.” The idea of Potter, who had easily been the most likeable and popular boy at school, being a juvenile delinquent was hard to fathom. When he thought back on it, Potter had often been afflicted by a black eye or a split lip, but Draco had just assumed all the bruises and broken bones to be a direct result of the man’s enthusiastic enjoyment of rugby and other contact sports.
“Yes, and no. It’s better when you finally get to love someone, it’s different. But you still feel worthless, like the ones you love only love you because they pity you”
“Oh really? Because I would beg to differ, it’s pathetic really. You trailing him like a little carbon copy. Have you ever heard of a personality, Malfoy?”
This is kind of a set up chapter, and I’m having a little bit of writers block so forgive the odd pacing for now. I’m writing this fic just to prove that it’s possible to have a realistic enemies to lovers Drarry narrative, without it being insanely toxic, so I hope you enjoy this!
Against better judgement, Draco carried on - “Wait until my father hears that Dumbledore’s got this oaf teaching classes”, Crabbe and Goyle laughed - but their amusement was short lived.
Hagrid cleared his throat to gather the attention of the students. “Ta-tara-rara!” - a massive creature emerged from behind the trees, it looked like a mixture between a horse and an eagle of some sort - “Isn’t he beautiful?”, asked the groundskeeper, “say hello to Buckbeak!”. The class seemed to be taken aback by the sheer size of the creature, even Hagrid seemed like a normal person compared to the animal. “Hagrid, what exactly is that?”, asked Ron in a terrified tone, “That, Ron, is a hippogriff! And what we know about hippogriffs is that they are very proud creatures. Very easily offended. And you do not want to insult a hippogriff, it might just be the last thing you do. Now! Who would like to come and say hello?” - answered Hagrid with a clap. Harry kept his gaze on the creature, however the rest of the class backed up in fear. When Hagrid looked back, it had seemed as though Harry had volunteered- “Well done, Harry! Well done”. Ron nudged his friend forward - “Now let him make the first move” said the groundskeeper. Harry stopped a good 3 feet away from the beast and bowed. Buckbeak tilted his head in response, slowly approaching. The boy lifted his hand towards the animal, Buckbeak leaned in - allowing Harry’s hand to rest on his head. Hagrid was ecstatic - immediately he lifted Harry up and set him on the creature’s back.
“I know someone like you, and he never stopped to question if what he was raised to do was right. I don’t think he’ll ever know life outside of having everything his way. But I don’t think anything is going your way, is it?”
Draco has not been able to stop thinking about what Harry said to him, people had started noticing. He had to do something about this, and fast.
That night Draco lay awake, staring at the banisters framing his bed. Everyone had fallen asleep a long time ago, and for sometime he pretended he was asleep so that it might become reality - but faking things hadn’t been Draco’s recent strong suit. ‘I’ll be good’ he thought to himself.
“I- no. I just wasn’t expecting that, not from you at least”, he took a pause - “Are we on a first name basis now?”, the boy asked with a nervous laugh.
“Well done, Harry!” Yelled Hagrid as he saw Buckbeak approaching the landing clearing. The moment the creature’s feet touched down on the ground Draco charged forward. “Are you joking? This is ridiculous!”, he yelled. Harry gave the boy a confused look, before Hagrid shoved him aside - “Stop! No!”, but Draco didn’t listen. Within a second the boy was on the ground, “OW!” - he yelped. Buckbeak raised himself up on his back legs and stretched out his wings to deliver another hit, but Hagrid dove in front to wave him off. The groundskeeper picked Draco up off the ground - “I have to take him to Madame Pomfrey, class dismissed!”
“You are going to be the death of me, Potter. How about this, you ask me the questions and I’ll answer with complete honesty”
As he made his way up a smoothly paved sidewalk, Draco saw that the gate to the left of the house was wide open, providing access to the back garden. Knocking on the front door would be useless if no one was actually in the house. He took a deep breath to calm his nerves, and then strode confidently towards the sounds of shrieking children and splashing water.
“Fine, you can come,” Scorpius huffed, knowing that this was the only way he was actually going to be able to attend. “But you
“I…I’m sorry, I think I must have missed something,” Draco apologized, his brows drawing together in confusion. “Having a laugh over…your divorce?”
Draco imagined sitting in the small plastic chair the children’s librarian usually used for story time, with his knees folded up to his chin, the thing was so small. Spread out on the alphabet carpet before him were 10 small children, all of whom were distracted, crying, or picking their noses. He envisioned a child announcing to all and sundry that they had to pee, and that was as far as Draco allowed himself to imagine. Yes, it really was worth it to call.
chat, gents,” she teased, “But would either or both of you be able to come out and supervise the swimmers? I forgot to pick up that ice cream cake I ordered for the party, so I have to make a quick run into town.”
While lying in bed the night prior, Draco had been thinking about how the last kiss they had shared before Harry dozed off would be their last kiss ever. He couldn’t imagine Harry wanting anything substantial, so he had declared it a one-time event to prevent himself getting his hopes up and then having his heart crushed to bits when things inevitably fizzled out.
Narcissa had taken the bedroom on the first floor, causing him to avoid that level entirely for now.
“These charms concealed more than his face and his magical signature. He acts different. He moves different. I
And as Harry launched into an explanation of the personalised privacy charm he’d put on the books, Draco thought that maybe, just maybe, going back to school wouldn’t be as horrible as he’d imagined.
Walls formed from white mist and suddenly he found himself in a room, Dumbledore standing a few steps away from him, smiling.
“Gotta admit, he’s rather fit these days,” Blaise interjected, and Draco had to control himself to refrain from glaring at him.
Grabbing Hermione’s welcoming speech, he began to pace agitatedly, trying to practice what he was going to say in his head. He’d never been one to give speeches.
Harry was about to protest, when Severus’ arm came to rest around his shoulders again, pulling him into a proper hug this time.
with Remus? If she was, he didn’t seem to be too excited about it, judging from the tightness around his eyes as he smiled and shook his head.
“I suppose finally escaping my father’s influence had an impact,” he replied evenly. “His expectations have dictated most of my life up until now, I never had a chance to actually be myself before.” Whatever being himself entailed, she didn’t have to know that he was still struggling with that.
“He doesn’t hate you, I know he doesn’t,” said Draco. “Every time I talked to him and you came up in the conversation he only had good things to say. He sounded like he wanted to be closer to you, actually.”
—a facade. We both married each other to please our parents, uphold certain tradition and expectations.”
“Gods, Draco,” he murmured breathlessly, mouth wandering along Draco’s jaw, “you are absolutely…” he nipped at his jawbone, “fucking…” his teeth caught Draco’s ear, making him squirm beneath him,
“Yes, there is. I betrayed you, otherwise the vow wouldn’t have been broken. Whether I acted out of good intentions or not, I still broke your trust, and for that I am truly sorry. Please, Harry, can you forgive me?”
The package turned out to be from Hagrid; a book about magical creatures. Harry looked decidedly guilty.
“Of course, you were a member last year already,” said Harry. “As far as I’m concerned, everyone is welcome. Not everything will be O.W.L. level magic.” Some things would be far beyond that, but he didn’t say that out loud. He didn’t want to scare younger years away.
The twins’ flat was as colourful as their shop. Two couches, one blue and one red, flanked a purple coffee table in the middle of the living room. A wooden table stood by the window, right next to an open door that led into the kitchen. The other three doors were closed, but Harry figured they must lead to the bathroom and Fred and George’s rooms respectively.
It didn’t feel so simple anymore an hour later when he ascended the stairs to the fourth floor, his stomach fluttering with nerves. He hesitated in front of the door, unsure whether this had really been such a great idea. But nothing to be done, there wasn’t really any other option, was there? Remus had told him that he’d been ignored the previous day and this morning, and encouraged Harry to try instead.
“Draco, please,” Harry whined, letting his own hands slide down Draco’s torso, only to have them caught and pushed back, one of them suddenly trapped under the hand Draco supported his weight with. Unfair.
She frowned, but didn’t question him. Instead she gestured for him to lead the way, and he quickly went for the stairs that led to the basement kitchen.
But now his father was gone, now it was easy to see the truth. Back then he’d been right there, judging Draco at every turn. And Draco had
A platform rose underneath Harry, elevating him by more than a foot. Remus had to suppress a chuckle. The Room of Requirement was nothing if not obliging.
Draco hurriedly cut him off, “No! Of course I’m alright with people knowing, I’m just…apprehensive of the backlash.” He blushed a little. “I’m glad you want to tell them, though,” he mumbled, not meeting Harry’s eyes.
Harry flinched violently and suddenly he couldn’t breathe, the edges of his vision began to blur and his heart was racing. Shouts were echoing in his ears, way too familiar, like they were etched deeply into his brain, repeating one word over and over. Instinctively, he shied away, trying to evade the strike that was bound to follow. Everything was blurry now and his ears were ringing. The man was still shouting.
All his life he’d wanted nothing more than his father’s approval. He’d never even gotten as much as a simple acknowledgement of his impeccable grades.
“So,” he began, grateful that his voice was steady, “how do I imprint my magical signature on the thing?”
They stepped into the shop and Harry felt a little overwhelmed by…everything. The inside was pure mayhem of jumbled sounds, colours and movement. And it was
Harry’s mind was overloaded with sensations. Draco’s lips were hot against his, his skin soft as silk, and even through two layers of clothing Harry could feel his cock pulse hot next to his own. Gasping for breath he pulled back, suddenly overcome with emotion and the realisation of what was happening. He stared down at Draco, who met his gaze steadily, silver eyes burning fiery. The moment stretched, and pure disbelief rose in Harry’s chest.
Remus nodded. “We are. Have been since the first war already, in fact. I joined barely six months after graduating from Hogwarts in 1978. Severus joined…later.”
Lupin laughed while Severus’ insides turned to ice. Could it be? Would Lily really have an affair with this
She opened her mouth, halted, and promptly closed it again. He had her attention now, that was a start.
He could already feel his body tensing, felt the wolf in him stir, ready to emerge at the first sight of the moon. It only took a couple more minutes for the transformation to start. While his bones didn’t technically
“They are not their parents, they are students like you and I. Let me be very clear about this: Everyone is welcome here, regardless of their house. If you have an issue with that, I suggest
“So, we’re giving the Weasleys and Granger the shock of a lifetime on your birthday. Alright,” he said, giving Harry a smile that seemed only the slightest bit forced.
Sweet Merlin, his magic. Draco hadn’t seen many magical cores before, but even he had been able to tell that Potter was more than just a little more powerful than the average wizard.
“There’s a spell,” Snape interrupted, speaking for the first time. “If you consent to participate, we can easily determine whether it’s the truth or not. Let’s make this simple.”
Remus nodded. “Honestly, even if you hadn’t collapsed, it’s obvious that these charms weren’t placed on a whim. According to Dumbledore, it was a rather intricate pattern of spells to unweave. Anyway, after all the enchantments were removed, Dumbledore noticed the changes in your appearance, and ran a few more spells to check for other…transformations.” Remus paused, giving Harry an odd look, almost apprehensive. Harry felt uneasy.
Severus’ face softened as he understood why they were all acting so odd. “No, I’m just fine, Harry. Although I’d love some dinner, and then there are a few things you all need to hear.”
He took a small piece of parchment and quickly wrote something on it, before handing it to Severus. It was the full address of Grimmauld Place. “Reading this will allow them to access the house through the Fidelius charm.”
“I’ll go get the room ready,” he declared and pushed away from the table before either of his friends could argue and only a couple minutes later he was pacing in front of the wall on the seventh floor, asking for a suitable venue for the DA.
Narcissa gave him a surprised look. “The Order? You mean the organisation that put this house under the Fidelius?”
A quick glance at the clock told Draco it was practically still the middle of the night, barely gone four o’clock. Potter was probably starving from skipping dinner, which meant he would be going down to the kitchen now that everyone was supposed to be fast asleep. Sneaky, but not sneaky enough, not with Draco having the lightest sleep in the world. For once, he thanked Merlin for his wretched sleep quality, as he all but jumped out of the bed. He was feeling reckless—how could he not, after Potter had done
“No, actually,” Remus replied with a small smile. “Matter of fact I was convinced you were straight until Narcissa told me about you and Lucius. She might’ve hinted at you having a crush on me as well.”
speak to you again. That doesn’t mean I’m not furious, but it means I’ll most likely calm down eventually.”
“A ring,” Dumbledore answered weakly, pulling something out of his robes and showing it to Severus. Harry couldn’t see it from where he was standing, but before he could go closer, Dumbledore had already closed his fingers around it again. The sound of steps announced Draco’s arrival in the doorway, looking confused.
“They better liked it,” growled Remus, closing his eyes as Harry’s magic soothed away the pounding in his head. “What spell was that?”
Yeah, Potter. Right. Stupid, arrogant, perfect little Potter. He still hadn’t reappeared out of the drawing room. Draco knew because he kept his door open and would hear Potter coming up the stairs. What the hell was he
It took longer than usual but eventually it worked and tension began to seep out of Harry’s body as he melted into Draco’s arms. They stayed like that for several long minutes, Draco’s hand still rubbing soothing strokes onto Harry’s back. Eventually, Harry pulled back and Draco let him, both of them settling into the couch cushions. Draco took his hand, feeling a strong need to keep some sort of contact, while Harry stared absent-mindedly into the fireplace.
Draco frowned. That did not sound very promising. He forced himself to be patient as Severus sat down and helped himself to a plate of food.
towards him. He felt like he’d been thrown into some sort of alternate universe, where absolutely nothing made sense anymore.
Then why was he literally getting ready to go confront Potter, who’d probably picked this ungodly hour to sneak down to the kitchen precisely to avoid
Draco’s attention snapped back to Fred, except Fred was busy chewing on a bite of cake and it had been George who’d said Draco’s name.
An hour and a good meal later, after returning to Harry’s room and settling down on the couch, Draco pulled Harry close, enjoying that they didn’t have to hide this anymore, ready to jump up at the slightest sound.
and he twisted in Potter’s grip until they were facing each other again. Potter’s pupils were blown wide, with a narrow rim of dark green that glowed like hot coals. Draco lifted a slightly shaky hand to cup Potter’s face, as his brain tried to comprehend the fact that this was happening. He was here, in Potter’s room, in Potter’s arms, with Potter saying
Draco hesitated for a split-second, hovering over Harry’s hard cock, before taking the plunge and wrapping his lips around the tip. It tasted salty. Harry gave a guttural moan above him and his fingers tightened in Draco’s hair. Draco decided to take it as a positive sign.
After sending Hedwig off with the letters, he turned his attention back to the books Kreacher had brought him. The last one he’d been reading was an old volume, beautifully bound in leather, with the title
“Oh yeah? Perhaps you should try it too, maybe then you wouldn’t look like a Dementor snogged you,” Draco shot back.
“Well,” sighed Slughorn, “it seems both your potions are, for lack of a better word, perfect. I’m afraid you’ll have to share your price.”
Every month he forgot how bad his urges got around the full moon, and every month it hit him again full force. He found himself envying Harry and Draco, as immature as that sounded because he doubted that those two were already fully going at it—or at least he hoped they weren’t, Merlin, would he have to give Harry
Harry’s mind, however, lingered on to the wandmaker. Why had Voldemort taken him? The question had been haunting him ever since Severus had told them about Voldemort’s latest hostage. Since his Occlumency had improved to a level where he was able to fend off even genuine attempts of Severus to break into his mind, his visions of Voldemort had practically stopped completely. He still felt occasional twinges of pain in his scar, but he never saw into Voldemort’s mind anymore. He was loath to admit that he missed it sometimes—not because he liked it, but because he felt like he’d lost an edge that he’d had over him. It had saved Arthur’s life, hadn’t it? What if he could have saved another life if he hadn’t blocked Voldemort out?
Some people thought Hogwarts to be able to control its magic actively, sometimes going so far as to say it was somehow
“I mean that I understand if—” He trailed off, struggling with himself. “—if you’d rather not touch me again,” he finally whispered. Draco’s heart broke clean in two.
Instead, he sunk down in his armchair and buried his face in his hands. What the hell was happening to him? How had he gone from comfortably detached to inextricably involved in less than a second? Why did he suddenly care whether
They stayed silent until their robes were fitted and paid for and they were out on the street again. Harry steeled himself for their questions as an uncomfortable silence stretched between them.
Albus’ words from three nights ago came back to him. Yes, he’d known Lily well. Better than anyone else, certainly better than
He scanned the terrain from his little hill. It was almost bigger than the backyard at Grimmauld Place — not that that had been huge to begin with, but it was still baffling to think that they were not actually outside.
“Alas, Minerva, it doesn’t. I am quite certain that the prophecy still applies to Harry. Most significantly because of Harry’s connection to Voldemort. Voldemort has chosen his own greatest threat by trying to kill Harry as an infant.”
After he’d dressed again, Severus glanced out of the window to see Remus getting ready for his daily duelling session with Harry. Despite the dreary weather, they still practised in the garden. Harry had mentioned the idea of converting one of the second floor bedrooms into a training room, but so far that hadn’t happened and Severus honestly wasn’t convinced any of these rooms would be big enough for that purpose—especially if they wanted the training dummy Remus had given Harry for his birthday to be
It took Harry a second to focus his vision. When it cleared, he found Draco’s eyes glazed over with lust. His breath caught at the thought that
“He’s downstairs,” Draco explained. “He apparated into the entrance hall, Harry felt the wards burn apparently, like when Sev came home injured. He asked for Sev, and he brought him into the library. There’s some nasty curse on his hand, and it was spreading. Harry was trying to help and— Well, that’s when Sev shouted at him and Harry panicked, which brought us here.”
The following two days Harry felt a constant lingering tension in his gut, as he waited for replies from Ron and Hermione. When Hedwig finally returned on Sunday evening Harry took the letter off her so hastily that she hooted at him offendedly. After apologising to his owl, feeding her a few treats, he immediately ripped the letter open. It was from Hermione.
“Yes, we have in fact,” Severus retorted, his voice going silky like it did when he was reprimanding students. “He inquired about Harry, and whether there were any new revelations regarding his parentage. I told him that the mystery has been solved.”
“Stay with me, Harry,” Draco ordered, and Harry focused on those silver eyes again. “Breathe with me, alright? In…and out. In…and out.”
Harry sank into his spot at the head of the table with a small grin on his face, before whispering something to Draco that made the Slytherin’s neutral mask slip for a second and give way to a flicker of surprise, followed by amusement. Draco seemed much more at ease now that Harry was with him again. Severus could relate to the sentiment—he was glad to stay close to Remus who acted as somewhat of a buffer between him and any potential hostility from former or current students, or from Molly Weasley who was periodically sending him glares that he assumed were supposed to be subtle.
If Severus hadn’t known for a fact that the man standing in front of him was not even sixteen years old, he wouldn’t have believed it. Slowly, he nodded.
Harry turned to Remus again, desperately hoping he’d tell him they were all wrong, but Remus’ face showed only shocked understanding.
His thoughts kept wandering back to Severus. Severus and the noises he’d make when Remus took him apart with his mouth. He shook himself. If he kept thinking about it, he’d only get himself worked up and the other man was obviously unavailable. But his mind was refusing to obey him.
Draco followed him without any resistance, still a little dazed from all the making out. Only when they were about to reach the third floor—their floor—did Draco’s mind snap back into attention.
“And spend the day away from you? I don’t think so,” Harry replied nonchalantly. Draco’s face softened immediately. “No, I wanted to invite them to visit Grimmauld. With the drawing room and the dining room all renovated, there’s enough space to host everyone.”
His voice was barely above a whisper when he forced his mouth to form the words “Subscriptio Magus Proprius.”
“Talk to me, please,” Draco murmured against his ear, and Harry felt his walls crumble. He turned around with a sigh and allowed Draco to pull him up and over to the couch. Draco arranged them to be sitting in front of each other, close enough that their knees were touching, before saying, “So, tell me what happened.”
There was a cold fury in Harry’s voice, one that chilled Severus to the bone. The question took him aback, though, and he had to think about it for a moment.
“Yes, yes, indeed,” Albus mused. “It is quite fascinating, really. You see, after I brought young Harry back from the Ministry, I thought it wise to ensure that Voldemort hadn’t left any malevolent magic behind in his body. With his, albeit hesitant, consent, I performed several spells on Harry, to detect and strip any magic that isn’t inherently his from him. To my surprise, I discovered a rather complicated net of spells, intricately woven together and immensely tricky to disentangle—nearly impossible, in fact, had I not detected a…trigger, of some sort, that was seemingly intentionally built into the whole construction.”
“Your wish is my command,” Draco replied with a carnal grin, his hand going back down Harry’s torso, this time not stopping at the waistband but instead ghosting over the outline of his erection.
Hermione slammed into him barely a second after he’d stepped into the Leaky Cauldron, hugging him tightly. He chuckled softly and hugged her back, his eyes finding Ron who was hanging back a little with Ginny.
Remus only half-listened as Harry’s speech went on. Even though Harry wasn’t following Hermione’s script — which had earned him a rather scandalised expression from the witch — Remus had heard enough about his plans and ideas for the DA to know what he would likely say.
“What we’ll demonstrate now is not a universal goal that everyone here can or should strive for,” said Harry towards their audience. “This is supposed to be an example of what a real-life fight might look like — a situation I wish none of you to ever find yourself in. Many of you won’t wish to go beyond defence, and that is perfectly alright. However, those of you who consider to take active participation in this war; this is what could await you — a tame version of it at least.”
Instinctively, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders and pulled him into a kiss. He came willingly, lips parting to allow Draco’s tongue to slide inside his mouth, hands settling on Draco’s hips.
,” Harry replied quickly, dragging his own hand further up as well, trailing the band of Draco’s pyjamas. He raised a questioning eyebrow, as he pushed the pants downwards ever so slightly, though he lost control over his expression when Draco’s fingers closed around him, soft and warm and firm and amazing.
Harry nodded and followed his example. For a moment, they both watched the potion simmer quietly. Harry’s thoughts wandered back to Severus. Why had Voldemort called for his followers? Death Eater meetings before lunch time couldn’t be a good sign.
He opened his mouth to protest her barely veiled accusation, but Minerva silenced him with a wave of her hand.
As his mother went downstairs to prepare dinner, Draco busied himself with putting Harry’s new clothes away into the closet, not even filling it by half. By the time he reemerged Harry was immersed in a conversation with Remus who must’ve heard them return, and Draco decided not to disturb them, going to his room to sort his own purchases instead. He was barely finished when his mother’s chiming charm rang through the house, calling them down to dinner.
“That question has a rather…multifaceted answer. As you know, from your unfortunate trip into my Pensieve, there was no love lost between James Potter and me. My early years at Hogwarts were ruined by his so-called pranks. It was never-ending, and as much as I respect Albus, his favouritism towards the Gryffindors allowed them to get away with things you’d be
He leaped behind his tree again, narrowly avoiding the fastest shards. He exhaled, his heart already pounding, adrenaline shooting through his blood. Taking a deep breath, he stepped out from his cover, ready to attack anew.
“Sometimes you’re really dense, Potter,” he said with the slightest drawl. “You practically brought Sev back from death’s doorstep, read healing books all day, but the idea that there might be a way to remove these scars doesn’t cross your mind? I am practically certain there’s a spell or a salve for that—after all, those are ordinary scars, not curse scars. Have you ever heard of a non-magical wound that can’t be healed with magic?”
Harry kept pacing. Then, the now familiar tingling sensation of someone entering the house’s wards paired with the sound of the front door opening startled him to a halt. He didn’t want to go upstairs, not at all. A nudge from Remus finally spurred him into action, and he ascended the stairs warily. Soft voices echoed from the entrance hall.
Draco only gave him an expectant look, waiting for him to go on. Harry took a breath, sitting up a little straighter.
“What? Legilimency is incredibly difficult to learn, much harder than Occlumency; only few people manage,” said Draco. “That’s partially why everyone fears the Dark Lord so much, because he’s such a strong Legilimens.”
Once everyone was seated, the elves served dinner—Beef Wellington, one of Harry’s favourites, at least based on Severus’ observations over the past month. Conversation flowed naturally, although that could easily have been attributed to the fact that there was a rather crisp divide between the inhabitants of Grimmauld Place at the head of the table and the Weasleys plus entourage occupying the lower half of it. To Severus’ surprise, it did not take too long for an exchange to emerge between Narcissa and Molly of all people. Though, considering what they were discussing, perhaps he shouldn’t have been surprised at all.
“I think I’ve seen this curse before,” Narcissa said, “but I know neither the incantation, nor the counter-curse. I do remember, however, that it’s not a widely known spell if it is the one I think it is. It— I think it was Severus’ own invention.”
. While he certainly had more to learn about the basics, his fascination with the wandless forms made it near-impossible to force himself to focus on anything else. He’d been practicing with some of them and, to his surprise, had found them to be rather intuitive to work with. He’d even gone so far as to deliberately let Remus hit him with a knock-back jinx during one of their duels, just so he could try them on the resulting bruises. All these little trials had been a success so far, and Harry was rather proud of himself. He’d never had a useful talent before, unless his uncanny ability to survive Voldemort counted as a talent.
“She said I smell less upset after looking at you, and that you’ll make me feel better,” Harry replied with a broad grin.
Harry excused himself as soon as he was done eating, eager to have another look at that potions book. Casting a Tempus he still had almost two full hours until his “detention” with Severus, so he ducked into an empty classroom in a side-corridor and settled at the nearest table. He opened his bag to pull out the textbook, then hesitated as his gaze fell on the black journal.
Harry just nodded, feeling an eerie sense of deja-vu at how similar Dumbledore’s words sounded to Severus’ back when their Occlumency lessons first began in fifth year. He shoved the vague discomfort away and forced himself to focus.
“No, this is ridiculous. Even if they were friends in school, that was years before I was born, there’s no way she’d have— When she got pregnant, that was
The doorbell rang, destroying Draco’s bubble of self-distraction, and he felt a surge of panic going through him. One look at Severus, who had returned halfway through lunch with a satisfied smile on his face, confirmed that he wasn’t the only one dreading what was about to come. Harry jumped up and hurried downstairs with Remus following close behind, leaving the large double doors wide open. They had agreed that it would be best if Draco, his mother and Severus waited here.
“It’s Mr Malfoy; as expected the Dark Lord is planning to recruit him into his ranks as soon as he returns to the Manor. He sought me out, asking for my help to avoid that.”
“Already out,” Draco grumbled without looking up. “Harry disarmed me after barely five seconds, I wasn’t even ready.”
Draco was delighted to be able to rile Potter up again, and he absolutely revelled in the heat that filled Potter’s eyes every time they exchanged glares. Admittedly, Potter was still
, a little voice in his head whispered. He shuddered at the thought, forcing himself to slow down. They might still be wrong about this, Harry might be someone else’s son. And yet, he couldn’t let go of the feeling that he had a responsibility to the boy.
“What did you talk about with Weasley? It looked intense,” he said, keeping his voice low enough that only Harry would hear him.
“Alright, you can go. But be careful, and keep your wand on you. I’m afraid I won’t join you, I want to rest a little. Will you be alright by yourself?”
For a few minutes they sat in a sullen silence, each lost in their thoughts. Eventually, Severus got to his feet with a sigh and went to check on Albus. To his surprise, he found the headmaster awake, sitting at the desk in the library and studying the ring that had cursed him.
His cub really barely ever got a break and the knowledge frustrated him to no end. He was hoping that going out with Draco would at least grant Harry some reprieve. The two were awfully infatuated with each other, and now that he knew, Remus felt rather stupid for not seeing it earlier. Narcissa had, of course. Ever the mother, knowing her son down to the tiniest detail, knowing exactly what certain glances and reactions meant. That’s how he was supposed to know Harry, but he didn’t. Not yet. He had, however, begun to pay more active attention, at the very least, and he had to admit that that Harry and Draco were not exactly subtle. Admittedly, they probably weren’t trying to be subtle anymore either, now that their little secret was out to everyone in the house anyway, but Remus found himself wondering whether those long stares between them had been there before already, and he’d just missed them somehow.
“Harry, you will not convince me otherwise! The Malfoy vaults are full and completely under my jurisdiction, the money spent on this will go all but unnoticed. Please, let me make this purchase for you. I can not accept that you should buy your
Hoping it wouldn’t scare the boy right off, Remus let out a soft whine, sounding more like a dog than a wolf. Draco flinched, but didn’t flee. He looked up at Remus, who tried his best to convey through his eyes that he understood, that it was alright. He flicked his eyes down to Harry, then back at Draco, then back to Harry. Draco’s eyes widened as understanding dawned of what Remus was trying to tell him.
She gave him an approving smile. Her expression turned pensive again when she said, “That leaves you without any options to see Harry. You couldn’t even claim to tutor him in Potions despite teaching Defence now.”
liked Harry, and after years of suppressing that it felt like bliss to suddenly be able to admit it so openly. Not only that, but to have Harry return the feeling! He seemed earnest about that and Draco felt compelled to trust him, even though such naïve trust was decidedly out of character for him.
Hermione looked aghast at the very idea of relying on Harry’s memory of adjusted instructions rather than the book. He didn’t press the point further and they reached the Great Hall and ate their dinner in silence.
The tension in the house was near unbearable by the end of Draco’s first week of living there. Severus and Potter were clearly at odds with each other, with Potter avoiding contact as much as possible, while Severus made rather awkward attempts at civility or even friendliness. Lupin spent his time either in Potter’s room or in his own, doing Merlin knew what.
Draco’s call seemed to freeze Harry mid-motion, and he turned to look at him, green eyes full of fury. Before Draco could reach him, however, he had already sprung back into action, crossing the messy bedroom in long strides and fiddling with something on the bookshelf, which to Draco’s surprise suddenly slid to the side, revealing a stuffy, overly crowded sitting room. Draco had to hurry to slip through the hidden door before it fell closed again.
“You won’t even be able to communicate with each other, or were you planning on sending each other owls across the Great Hall?” Hermione went on undeterred.
“My lord,” Severus began, his heart in his throat, “if I aid a raid of Hogwarts, my position as your spy will be uncovered for sure. Surely you don’t wish to lose that advantage?”
“Shut up, Malfoy” - quietly, yet forcefully said Harry, now making strides toward the group himself.
“You’re right, it was ridiculous. But I suppose it’s doing Gryffindor some favors to play against a garbage seeker?”
Draco scoffed, but followed the instructions. Low growling came from the book, however this time around it was strangely mellow. Neville didn’t seem to have heard the direction - as he fell to the ground, being attacked by his textbook - “I’m okay!”, he yelled out - an evident lie. Harry had managed to get his book open without losing a shoe, a notable accomplishment - all things considered.
“People tell me I remind them of my mother. And that hurts as much as it comforts, I wish I got to know her”
The boy clung tightly to Buckbeak’s neck. New waves of terror washed over him with each swing of the creature’s wings, he did not dare to open his eyes. The smell of pine and fresh water suddenly washed over him. Hesitantly, Harry opened his eyes - never ending forests surrounded him at either side, parting to make way for the river. Buckbeak dragged his claw through the water as he flew above the surface, Harry let go of the creature’s neck and let his arms stretch out with the wind. His smile radiated genuine happiness, for the first time in a long time. But perhaps it wasn’t happiness that he felt, perhaps it was relief. As they flew above the water Harry didn’t have to think about anything, what waited for him on the ground didn’t mean anything anymore. It all seemed so distant to him, so finally, Harry allowed himself to experience the moment at hand. He allowed himself to feel the air on his skin, and the water beneath him, and the unsteady beating of his heart. Harry laughed as everything seemed to be left to the wind.
Draco was on him again. He was kissing his neck again and leaving little marks whenever his teeth would touch the skin. Harry let out a soft moan each time that would happen, pressing his nails on Malfoy’s back with each one.
“You definitely had a crush on Cedric, Harry. Just saying” Hermione told him while holding her third cup of whatever mix. She had some theories that Harry hadn’t believed at first, but at some point in that party, he got dared to kiss the one and only Draco Malfoy.
Harry hadn’t expected it to go this way. He was just figuring himself out after his breakup with Ginny, it was only natural. There had been a Slytherin party that had changed a lot of things.
He pushed through groups of younger students trying to get to their classes until he finally arrived at an empty corridor. There, he slowed down his pace. He didn’t want to seem desperate, he had some dignity left for Merlin’s beard!
Harry came all over Draco’s hand with a shaky breath. His head pulled back to take all the sensation in. Some cum fell on his pants and his shoes but he couldn’t care about that now, he was too worried trying to pull it together and come back from the high it had given him.
“Do you?” Harry said with a grin on his face as tried to untie his belt to return the favour but his hands were pulled away. With clear disappointment on his face, he turned to take care of the cum stains on his uniform.
Draco reacted to that by opening Harry’s trousers and freeing his cock so he could touch it better. Another shiver came through the entirety of Harry’s body. The sudden relief from the close space his cock had been trapped in made it throb.
A hand came down to grab Harry’s cock. He was wearing his uniform clothes and the harshness of the fabric to the sensitive skin made him feel a tingle down his spine. He was breathing faster, clearly waiting for anything Draco would give him. Not knowing how else to react, clearly not enough blood in his brain to form a straight thought, he pushed the other boy against him.
He used that pause to say “kiss me” to which Draco said nothing and just complied. This time, the kiss was softer but not lacking any desire for more. His hand was still playing with the obvious bulge that had grown in Harry’s pants.
Harry’s first thought was that maybe Draco needed help with a potion. They usually didn’t meet in classrooms in case someone came in. But Draco didn’t need any help with any potions! And even if he needed it, he wouldn’t ask Harry for it.
Harry’s hands went directly to Draco’s ass, not wasting any second. He let out a small gasp. Harry had learned where to put his hands alright.
He looked directly into Draco’s eyes, wanting to see if he enjoyed that as much as he did. He was blushing almost as hard as Harry had just a moment ago.
He made his way to the door that opened to the classroom where the potions class usually took place. No sooner had he grabbed the doorknob than the door opened. A strong hand grabbed him by his shirt and pulled him inside the classroom.
The three laughed, “ooooooo” - Draco smirked. Leaving his bag behind, he made his way toward Harry. The class had now gathered around the two - anticipating a fight. Draco’s gaze shifted to the sky abruptly, he was jumpy on his feet and his voice trembled - “D-d-dementor! Dementor!”. The class whirled around with a unanimous gasp, yet the Slytherins laughed. Draco ran back to the group, and after putting on their hoods, they began imitating the soul-sucking creatures - “ooooooooo”, they mocked. Hermione mocked back and led Harry away from unnecessary conflict.
