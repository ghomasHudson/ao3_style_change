“My name is Sylvia Silver and I used to be Sir Lodovicus Malfoy’s favourite model …” her blush increased some more and she added nearly inaudibly, “and his mistress.”
Harry shook his head and frowned at her, before he looked at Hermione with pleading eyes.
Harry and Draco were both speechless for a moment.
– Master Taurus Malfoy studied this book –
“Mr Laddley’s statement is confidential, Harry,” Josh explained, “he gave testimony just a few days ago. What’s the use of going public?”
“No, Mr Potter, Imagics are as indestructible as any magical artefact can be,” Flitwick explained, “it would take an immensely strong force to ruin them, a Basilk’s fang for example, or Fiendfyre.”
“How do you do, Mr Potter,” Narcissa nodded at Harry, before addressing her sister, “I am very happy to finally see you again, Andromeda… and this must be your grandson,” she said approaching Andromeda with a somewhat forced smile on her face. “What a sweet boy indeed.”
“After the introduction of our new teachers every member of staff will explain, what kind of physical exercise they intend to offer. In October you can try different classes, but must make up your mind until the end of the month. You can take two different courses or the same one twice a week, but you will practice what you have chosen until Christmas. After the holidays you can switch to different sports.”
At the moment he was still undetected, well hidden under the cloak and that was his only advantage, he did not want to risk it. Alas, Aberforth – or whoever had sent that letter – was aware of the cloak. They must be watching closely and therefore Harry needed to consider his moves ever so carefully.
“Charlie… Charles,” the boy answered, chin up.
“Forget about Josh! I might have had a little crush on him when we first met, but… I don’t want perfect,” Harry said feeling bold, “I want you. Your past doesn’t change that.”
“So – what are we waiting for! Let’s search his room,” Ron got up too and went for the door, when again someone knocked to come in.
Harry pitied her quite a bit. All the changes at school, the missing Imagics and now the trouble with Laddley as well – her first year as Headmistress was running anything but smoothly. Would the Board of School Governors hold her responsible for having accepted someone as unfit for teaching as Laddley? Harry sincerely hoped she would not be in trouble.
“Leave him alone. As long as he’s still able to waltz with me once a week, he can sprain his ankles all he likes,” Hermione patted Ron’s knee.
Now most heads in the common room had turned towards them and several students pointed and whispered.
“No! I found nothing on that stupid board! Nothing of interest at all – which was so very frustrating! So I had to go to the library of course.”
They stepped into the corridor to the dungeons, when Harry continued, “But what about my copy… the Malfoys and the Blacks have been close for generations – maybe my book is a copy of the Malfoys’ volume? Or what if…” he stopped in his track and said excitedly, “hey, what if the Malfoys’
Hermione paled than blushed deeply.
when you come to clean their rooms?”
Harry stretched out his hands for Ron to see them clearly.
in the middle of Diagon Alley, can you imagine? Well, father stunned him and that was that. I knew better than asking what it was all about… but of course now I wish I had.”
“Of course, why wouldn’t I?” Harry did not miss a beat to reply and his eyes did not falter from Kingsley’s. Hermione gasped.
“Yeah, I assumed they would,” Harry said with a rush of affection for the three people sitting in the compartment. They were his best friends. They always would be, no matter whom he fancied, he was sure about it.
In the course of last week the weather had finally turned and heavy winds and downpour had locked them in for days. This morning’s surprisingly mild air with a bit of sun lured everybody outside again.
They passed the wooden gate and found themselves in a narrow back lane between kitchen gardens.
But still Harry realized he didn’t want to miss that quiet hour and neither did Draco, so it seemed. Draco, who read every morning in a book, clad in black leather – couldn’t still be the same book, Harry mused. Draco, who always appeared fully dressed and looking well-groomed. And who had totally surprised Harry last Sunday morning, when Harry had found a perfect mug of Assam waiting for him, with some milk and no sugar, just as he liked his tea.
Her eyes searched his face until she finally said, “You fancy him – right, Harry?”
Tommy shook his head.
“Home-schooling is done among Muggles as well, you know,” Hermione said to Cass, ”some very conservative parents like to keep their kids at home to ‘preserve’ them from learning stuff they don’t agree with, no matter if it’s solid Muggle science.”
(UP went the roller coaster!)
“Good boy, Mephisto,” Snape said, “now sit!” – and the dog obeyed.
“I assume she is, as we haven’t heard otherwise,” the Imagic said.
Daisy giggled, “That is so funny! Draco knows you really well, Harry, he predicted, you would ask me about his reading! But I promised not to tell and Imagics always keep their promises. I’m reading
In the afternoon McGonagall and Shacklebolt returned from London and immediately called for another meeting. This time Molly and Arthur also took part in it. Harry was immensely relieved to hear that Laddley had turned the corner. The Muggles Studies teacher was still unconscious but the Healers were convinced he would survive and be well again. In the course of the meeting Harry managed to gain Kingsley Shacklebolt’s assurance, that the A.D. would no longer treat Draco as a suspect, when he returned and that they would secure Draco’s journey back to school. Back at his room after dinner Harry had written his letter to Draco, impatiently waiting for Otto to wake up.
“Don’t you like to instruct? I always assumed you do, seeing you are such a gifted teacher. Dumbledore’s Army, swimming lessons – we had the impression you thoroughly enjoyed that?” McGonagall asked.
“As so many times before you make absolutely no sense, Potter.” Draco shook his head. “You attend a dance party but claim never to dance? What a pity… for your countless admirers I mean. Who, it seems, lately include even a famous deceased Headmaster of Slytherin origins…”
Neville sat down with a smirk. “I love you too, Malfoy!”
Blaise winked at Draco, pointed his wand, boomed the spell – and Draco’s shirt turned a vivid pink. “Sorry, mate!” Blaise grinned, “couldn’t resist!”
Ginny and Ron whispered frantically to each other. They did not dare to complain openly about their mother’s presence at school any more, having been told off by Harry and Hermione the day before. But they still looked lamenting.
“Otto’s just lovely, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry said, “he’s still at owl school of course but his teachers are very happy about the progress he’s making.”
That’s why Daisy had always felt slightly familiar! Finally he remembered what his subconscious had wanted to tell him for the last two weeks! And he knew exactly what he needed to do this afternoon.
He pointed his wand at the unconscious Draco, still bound and gagged. Apparently the villain applied another wet-rag-hex, as Draco’s head shot up and his eyes snapped open. He looked around frantically until his eyes found Harry’s.
“Secretive sod,” Seamus complained.
Draco flushed once more and for a split second Harry expected him to explode with anger. But then a miracle of sorts happened: Draco’s mouth turned into a lopsided grin and he cleared his throat. “Whatever, Potter,” he said, turning his attention back to the book.
“Seriously?” Harry grinned. “So you don’t think Flitwick, Kingsley and Josh will make much of a difference?”
Hermione pointed at the Muggle Study teacher’s picture. “Gregory Laddley has indeed been working for the same department as your dad, Ron, but not at the London office. He has been a Muggles Liaison officer stationed under cover at the United Nations for several years.”
Blaise puffed up, “For want of better entertainment of course! It’s a shame Chastity is not related to any of you lot…” He sighed.
"Sounds good to me," said Josh, then he addressed his students, “You've heard what Mr Potter said, so we have to be patient... if you don’t want to wait, you can go to the gym instead, just like the others have done.”
“Oh well, the sensitivity of the sexually starving…” Ron sighed.
Now he was awake before sunrise once again and lay in bed reminiscing about yesterday’s events… his suspicions about Ginny and Draco’s feelings for each other, the horrible story about the Malfoy family, Draco being a suspect in the Imagic affair and finally the Halloween Ball’s challenging motto – it certainly had been a crazy day.
Draco snorted, “Friendship with females is not a concept Blaise gets, he just wants to shag each and every girl he meets… everything that moves actually.”
Hermione laughed.
“But… you don’t even like me?! Just a few days ago you said, I’m disgusting!”
Professor Jordan cleared his voice. “I see. Thank you, Mr Malfoy. A very fine Patronus indeed.” He cast another
“Or you might just get away with it, wouldn’t you?” Draco smirked.
They hugged – and it was simply wonderful. Harry exhaled deeply. No, he need not have worried. Draco was definitely not annoyed by his visit.
“You know what? I think that description might actually please her,” Harry said and risked biting into one of the muffins after some hesitation. It was quite nice, mostly pineapple and coconut flavour with a hint of lemon.
Cass obviously was not very fond of her given name in full length as she rolled her eyes at Harry.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” Hermione snorted, “if Harry needs us, home-work will have to wait – and don’t forget your greens!” Turning to Harry she added, “Do you want us to come with you?”
“’rgoofend!” Ron mumbled before he let go and stared teary-eyed at Harry.
“You did not?” She raised one eyebrow and just a hint of a smile played around her lips.
Well, Harry had told Cass weeks ago that she could tell Draco about it, so it was to be expected. But still… at each of their early morning encounters Harry had been waiting for Draco’s comment, for being teased about it or any kind of confirmation the message had been received. Maybe it simply didn’t matter to Draco that much? Harry compared Draco’s silence to Tommy’s excited reaction. Straight people probably didn’t find this news as interesting as other queers, he concluded.
Harry’s heart beat furiously when he reached the first floor corridor behind the boxes – and certainly not for having climbed one flight of stairs. He strolled along peeking into the boxes. Most of them were not taken yet, the curtains open towards the corridor.
Draco shrugged and looked at Harry.
“Well, finally I get to meet you!” shouted the other teenager – and within an instant Harry realized his mistake. This was not a boy, but a girl. Admittedly a very tom-boyish girl. As Harry stepped closer, the differences became more obvious. She was not quite as tall as Draco, had sparkling blue eyes instead of Draco’s grey ones, a softer jaw line, slightly fuller lips and cheeks.
He clapped his hands, “Any more questions? Yes, Mr Zabini?”
To Harry’s discomfort they were not alone. Working in the far corner of the garden, pushing a bar spade into the soil, was the scary bartender. He looked up and frowned at them – for all Harry could tell behind those dark glasses.
“Don’t tell me you started fighting again,” Ginny said looking disappointed. “I so hoped your fights from former years were gone for good.”
“Is it still done today? I mean, the pure-blood kids at school, are they all spoken for?” Harry asked incredulously.
Harry felt sick. He had not been as desperate and powerless since that horrible night at Malfoy Manor. Suddenly he had a vivid flashback of Hermione’s voice, crying in agony. His stomach rose and he retched.
“Which was terribly distracting and made you forget to support your partner, you wretched dickhead,” Dean complained, “I’ve lost the final game because of you.”
, Harry corrected himself,
He inhaled deeply and pressed the button.
“Yeah, chhh… I’m conscious,” he croaked, “but barely!”
“Ron!” Hermione rolled her eyes, “you are so blunt, it hurts.”
After a lengthy discussion with McGonagall and Shacklebolt, Harry had finally accepted the attendance of three Aurors for the flight under the condition, they backed off as soon as he touched down. Josh volunteered to be one of them, the others Harry had not known before. They left Hogwarts in the early hours of Saturday, assuming the flight would take them about five to six hours as Otto had been able to cover the distance twice in one night.
“It’s alright, Harry, I made it,” Draco squeezed Harry’s shoulders.
But many students from traditional wizard families knew very little about Muggle mythology and therefore asked their Muggle-born friends, what kind of a dating service Noah’s Ark had been? After some laughter and whispered explanations Flitwick continued, “And finally it is my pleasure to announce, that we will have a ball – literally a ball – at Halloween!”
“The thing is, whenever Draco was feeling the side-effects badly, at the very same time the tracker would report a false-positive location.”
“Good morning, students! May I have your attention please!” shouted the familiar voice of Headmistress McGonagall from the staff table. “Before I have the pleasure of introducing our new members of staff, I want to address the latest addition to the Hogwarts curriculum. As you all will be aware, each and every student is asked to exercise twice a week from now on.”
“Nasty bit of art, I remember her cursing well enough,” Snape’s Imagic jumped in.
“Harry!” Molly tried to interrupt.
“Can we please stop talking about Malfoy?” Harry sighed, “Don’t you think we have more pressing issues to deal with?”
“So you passed your A-Levels? And Harry said you took O.W.L.s as well? Wow, that’s brilliant. I wish I could have done that,” Hermione said with envy, “I used to read Muggle science books during the summer holidays for some years, but since Harry came of age and with being on the run, the war and everything… I’m afraid I gave it up. I’m totally in default with my Muggle education. And Muggle studies lessons at Hogwarts are no help at all. I don’t need lessons about how to use a dishwasher, I want astrophysics!”
Harry drew his breath and pressed his hips as close as possible at Draco’s but –
“That is why I went to Edinburgh before returning to Hogwarts, to talk to Philomella in person. Of course I didn’t tell her anything about Dumbledore’s missing Imagic. I just wanted to ask her opinion on Draco’s behaviour, whether she believes him to be truly reformed and regretful concerning his past. She is quite convinced his remorse is genuine and heartfelt.”
Then she turned to Ginny and said, “You are quite right, we are able to pass as twins and believe me, we made good use of it, when we were kids. Fooled our parents quite a bit, didn’t we Draco?” she turned to her cousin, trying to include him into the conversation. Draco rolled his eyes and leaned back into his seat as if he tried to blend in with the upholstering.
“Do you want me to leave, Headmaster?” Draco asked with a stony face.
Harry avoided her eyes and shrugged. “Well, I guess it depends on what he has done… let’s find out, shall we?” He nodded towards the staff table where Cass was having a heated discussion with the Headmistress and Kingsley Shacklebolt. Ginny stood right behind Cass, her hand on her girl-friend’s shoulder.
“Scones – I guess?” Harry answered and both of them grinned. Joking was easy with Ginny, they enjoyed the same sort of humour.
“Alright, abandon me,” complained Ginny at the breakfast table on Sunday morning, “my very own brother, my flesh and blood… “, and she sighed in mock despair.
“Hello Daisy, nice to meet you! Of course I don’t mind, in fact it’s very good of you to come. Please call me Harry, ok?”
They were alone – well, as alone as two people could be at an overcrowded dance-party.
Draco stared at Harry. “The Invisibility Cloak? You want
Harry shifted uneasily in his seat. He felt Draco Malfoys eyes on him when he said, “Nah, I don’t think so… maybe some other time.”
Without another look at Draco, Harry addressed O’Malley, “Well, shall we continue our tour?” and they left quickly.
“Don’t be daft, Ron! Why would we stay at the common room overnight when we both have our private rooms? No, in fact,” Harry coughed, “we haven’t spent a single night together yet. But we… we met for early morning tea at the common room. Regularly.”
Early next morning Harry awoke with a start. He listened closely but could hear nothing but his own fast heartbeat. Was it the silence of his new bedroom that had startled him? Harry wondered. This room was spacious, comfortable and – extremely quiet. Never in his life had he slept in a room as still as this one. At the Dursleys’ he had been used to a cacophony of Muggle media sound – the telly’s constant chatter, blasting radio programs and Dudley’s shooter games. During his previous years at Hogwarts, sharing a bedroom with Ron, Dean and Seamus, Harry had never been the only one who snored. Add Ron’s vivid sleep-talking and the occasional embarrassing noise of someone wanking, their sleeping arrangements had been anything but quiet. Even his beloved bedroom at Number Twelve – which was quiet enough but of course full of London’s white noise – could not match the absolute stillness surrounding him now.
“I’m so sorry,” he said. “I truly am! I should have stopped fighting Draco! I should have protected him instead. I was just… totally clueless! Stupid! I should have –“
Harry very much doubted it. Ariana seemed totally consumed by her work which was probably a good sign.
Draco blushed violently, but was spared an answer by Blaise Zabini, who fell into the seat to Draco’s left with a booming, “Good evening, folks – who would have thought I might end up sitting close to The-Boy-Who-Lived!” He grinned at Harry who rolled his eyes in reply.
To Harry’s delight Draco blushed as violently as he himself would have done in his place – until he became aware that right behind Draco somebody else had stepped into the corridor.
!” and in an instant Draco’s shirt turned a lovely shade of mauve, which suited him not too bad, Harry thought.
They were alone. Draco still hadn’t put on his robes again and seemed to quietly admire his shirtsleeves. Harry was suddenly nervous, his whole body itched. He had never felt like that when being alone with Draco during their morning routine at the common room. Why was that? He needed to say something, anything to break that awkward silence.
Harry took over, “On the down side – Dumbledore’s Imagic is still missing. We have no idea where Taurus Malfoy is hiding and even if we catch him, we’ll have no witness to nail him at court. Laddley – who could probably explain everything – is fighting for his life.”
that he immensely regrets that and honestly tries to do better now! And you can’t blame him for me being gay either, he did not seduce me, in fact, he didn’t even want us to be together in the first place! It took quite an effort to persuade him!” He crossed his arms in front of his chest and stared at her.
“I’d like to add, that Auror Training is still a very solid base for anyone who might want to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts,” Flitwick said with a smile, “wouldn’t you agree, Minerva?”
Of course Ariana was all alone in her portrait, Albus Dumbledore’s Imagic could hardly have swaped places like that, from the Ministry Archives to the Hog’s Head Inn. Harry sighed. Admittedly he was still a bit disappointed. He had hoped without reason to find the familiar bearded face at her side. Well, that would have been too easy. Plus Aberforth most probably would have reported the continuous presence of his brother’s Imagic to the Headmistress.
“He sure looks very… impressive,” Harry finally managed to say. “I trust it must be very reassuring to have him around.” The bird flapped his huge wings a few times and immediately a storm hit the painting, leaves and branches danced in the wind and Daisy’s strawberry blond locks and her white skirts were in dishevel.
“Well, it’s obvious what has happened, isn’t it?” Hermione said. “Taurus Malfoy hexed the painting as we already knew he did. Then some person yet unknown – maybe Gregory Laddley or somebody else staying at Hogwarts – impersonated Draco by means of Polyjuice Potion, brought the painting to Hogwarts and hung it in Draco’s room. The real Draco, being anything but fond of the nude lady above his bed, took it down and stored it away.”
Harry stood up abruptly. “You get it, right? We finally know what has happened, but even if we catch Taurus Malfoy, he made sure we’ll have no witness to prove it! This drives me nuts! We can’t just wait until Laddley regains consciousness!”
“First of all get dressed and put on a warm coat as well, I’ll wait for you at the common room, okay?”
“As I said, first he just created Pippin but then he painted other stuff into my room as well, two letters and a bottle. He told me to put one of the letters into the empty bottle and then he trained Pippin to carry these items around at his command. That wasn’t too bad. Finally he seemed to be satisfied with Pippin’s obedience and then he did something horrible with my painting – I don’t know what exactly he did, I just felt terribly sick and even lost consciousness for a while.” She shivered.
“In that case come to my room in the early hours. You’ll probably have to wait until everybody has retired after the ball… let’s say if we have not been able to get together until two in the morning, we’ll meet at my room instead. I’ll leave the door slightly ajar as an all-clear. Then we can talk about the whole matter and I promise, I’ll tell you everything I know, alright?”
Harry thought, not that he had ever believed Josh to be involved. Ron gave Harry a questioning look – apparently Ron guessed that Josh must have told Harry all about his dismissal this morning already.
“Of course, Headmistress,” Hermione said with flushed cheeks and they hurried along.
He was just about to knock again when a side door to their right opened with a creak and Aberforth appeared.
Now he put on his kilt, a crisp white shirt, black stockings and an emerald jacket. He was quite proud of his very own tartan, which he had designed using dark green, black and a fine strip of Gryffindor-red. Finally he suspended a black leather sporran at the front of his belt and –after a moment of hesitation– he not only put his wand in there but also his invisibility cloak.
McGonagall snorted, “Headmistress Longbottom has doubts just about everything. If I trusted her judgement, I would not leave my bed in the morning.”
“You know what? Stop whining! You’re damn selfish, the two of you!” He was really annoyed. “I think it’s brilliant for Molly to get that job! Don’t you think it’s tough for her to be all alone at the Burrow, especially since we’ve lost Fred? Your mum raised you all – hell, she even raised me! And now she more than deserves an interesting occupation! Give her some credit! You should be damn proud of your mum instead of playing Moaning Myrtle!”
Flitwick sighed with relief, “Thank you, that would be excellent, Mr Potter, excellent indeed. Meanwhile I’ll inform the Headmistress. She’s in her private rooms tonight, entertaining a guest… oh Merlin, this is a disaster! No point in hiding our problem any longer…”
“Thank you, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry nodded, heart pounding and took a seat.
– whispered.
“They are all here to lay eyes on my immaculate body wrapped in nothing but a speedo, of course,” Blaise said with a grin, slapping his naked belly. Harry and Tommy laughed, they had decided on wearing T-shirts with their trunks for the lesson.
He shook his head and sighed. “The name ‘Firebird Hex’ was suspicious of course and that is why I asked Daisy to stay at the seaside with him, close to the water until I finished testing its powers. They were never meant to leave before I was convinced that the hex was safe… but then Ariana arrived at Bellevue Beach of all places and Daisy – true Gryffindor girl that she’s been in her time – entered the fray.”
Ron stopped in his track. He looked at Harry for a second – and then Harry found himself in a bear-hug.
Harry opened his eyes with some effort. He was at Hogwarts’ hospital wing and saw with a jolt of pleasure that yes, indeed Ron and Hermione were sitting at his bed. He gave them a lopsided grin. Otto, perched on Hermione’s shoulder, hooted some more.
The younger students responded with loud hurrahs and much cheering until suddenly the door swung open again and Professor Tharros stepped in. Within seconds the room fell silent.
“Or the sword of Gryffindor,” Harry added.
Draco shook his head, “That bird nearly gave me a heart attack! And she calls him Pinkie? Seriously?”
“No, Daisy, of course not!” Harry was shocked, “Strolling around all alone could well be dangerous for you! Actually I’m reluctant to ask you for any favour at all – but at least you’ve got Pinkie to watch over you… so here’s what I want you to do – please alert Headmaster Snape about the Fat Lady’s disappearance. Go directly to his portrait and come straight back, do you hear me? No detours!”
“Well, Taurus Malfoy’s involvement is certainly something to be considered,” said Kingsley. “I’ll check immediately, maybe the Ministry has some news concerning his whereabouts.”
“Oh, but it does! Because I know the perfect costume that just goes with everything – I dare you to name three different mottos and I’ll promise this disguise I have in mind will fit in nicely with each of them!”
“And what a great job it is doing, right?” Ron said with sarcasm.
“Well, if you intend to become an Auror, you’ll get used to the idea that appearances can be misleading,” Josh smiled.
“Right. But I still need to know what has happened, Mr Dumbledore, it might be important for the issue… the issue I told you about last time we talked, remember?” Harry pleaded.
Harry stared at his left leg, as if it was no longer a part of his body. His leg was caught in a nervous tremor, rocking the little table in front of the fire-place. No wonder. He was anything but content with being stuck at Gryffindor Tower, waiting for Molly and Arthur to join them.
And now this weird dream had ruined his mood. Harry sighed and tried to concentrate on last evening’s pleasant events instead… so Draco was gay, he had smiled at Harry and agreed to talk about… well, them.
“And if you still want some extra lessons, I’ll be glad to be of service,” Hermione offered, “at least as long as you help me with Muggle science?”
“Looking forward to escaping my control, I presume?” she asked with a smile. “I still advice strongly to take it easy, Mr Potter, or you’ll be back here in a jiffy! And we both don’t want that, do we?”
They took shelter beyond the porch and Cass teased Ginny for having obviously slipped on the wet ground as her back was covered in mud. Ginny laughed, turned around and wiggled her bottom in Cass’ direction which made Draco laugh out loud.
Time for interim questions:
“I know you’re gay, nothing wrong with that.” Harry said with an encouraging smile, “You and Tevin make a really nice couple,” he hesitated for a second and added, “I might even envy you a bit.”
Finding his words carefully he said, “Are you quite alright, Daisy? Isn’t it a bit scary to be all alone in the forest, especially at night-time when none of us students is at the common room?”
Harry grinned to himself while pulling out a battered volume. The odd title ‘C.O.M.A.’ was printed in silver letters on its spine. Harry opened the book – which responded by vomiting violently at him.
As soon as Polly heard his voice, she stopped dead at her present place at the elm’s branch. The squirrel stood upright on her hind legs and stared at Harry, snout twitching and tail lashing frantically from one side to the other.
“I even tried to set him free after the war without success. I offered him a t-shirt but he ignored it. Hermione thinks, he’s been in service for so long, that he’s unable to live without a master.” He sighed. “I’ve told him to stay at Hogwarts so he has some company of his own kind at least. He’s been lonely for many years and I don’t really need him at London.”
He exhaled deeply and seemed to calm down. After a few seconds of hesitation he turned to Josh, “Auror Jordan – as Mr Potter was kind enough to listen to me today, maybe I could return to London now? And visit my brother this weekend again? He’s used to seeing me every Sunday and I don’t want to disappoint him.”
“Relax. I was just startled, no need to worry.”
“And you too have no idea where Draco might be hiding, right? No clue whatsoever?”
Snape’s Imagic cleared his voice before he said, “Mr Potter, I’m here to explain the purpose of the latest addition to this common room.”
“Of course I’m concerned,” he replied feeding her some half-truths, “but I’m trying to keep a cool head… if I freak out –like Cass– they will ban us from the investigation altogether. We need to do some damage control here until Draco turns up again.”
“As a rule, wild-life animals will never change into tame animals,” Professor Jordan explained, “it will always be the other way round. Same is true for herbivores, they will never change into carnivores. Interesting, isn’t it? Patronuses are a most fascinating topic, don’t you agree?”
Ron rolled his eyes. “Please.”
“Oh I did not feel intimidated by this Mr Snape, not at all,” Sylvia whispered, “in fact… I think him quite handsome.”
How was Draco supposed to enter, if she watched Harry’s room that closely? Harry remembered the Aurors standing at the castle’s main entrance and at the front of the guest house well enough... would Draco be able to pass any door at all? The cloak did not allow him to walk through walls after all!
Head inside of a kitchen cupboard, he had turned abruptly, when something big had fluttered behind his back – thus banging his head on the shelf. Rubbing furiously at the bump-to-be, he stared at a snow owl. The bird had flown through the open window right into the kitchen of No 12 Grimmauld Place and was now sitting atop the kitchen table.
Aberforth laughed. “The Room of Requirements will turn up sooner or later, I’m sure of it!”
He smiled at her and shrugged. “I guess so...”
'A chapter a day keeps the boredom away!'
“Hush, Pinkie,” Daisy said straightening her dress, “don’t be naughty, calm down,” and the beast obeyed.
“Are you insane?” Harry took Draco’s wrists, locked him into position and hissed, “You are not turning yourself in, do you hear me?”
“But why the hell not? I thought you fancied Potter anyway? Don’t you find him attractive at all?” Blaise asked. “You might reconsider, if you went to the pool once again, the guy looks quite hot without clothes, I promise!”
“You’ve always had the emotional intelligence of a door knob,” Ginny snorted, “you didn’t even see your own relationship coming – while everybody else knew for ages you were meant to be with Hermione.” She pulled a face at her brother.
*Auntie, making amends for yesterday's cliffhanger*
Ron groaned. He must have hoped for an early start into the weekend, Harry thought.
He gave Harry a derogatory look. “Still it made perfect sense that you should own the Hollows. Everybody knows about your cloak, a heritage from your father. You yourself told the story of the Elder Wand during your final battle with the Dark Lord and dozens of people saw the Deathstick fly willingly into your hand. Yet you don’t use it – obviously.” He nodded at Harry’s wand which lay on the floor in front of Harry, same as his invisibility cloak.
“Professor Flitwick himself, of course,” McGonagall said, ”as I mentioned, he is quite an expert in Magical Arts, which are in fact part of Highly Advanced Charms. It’s tradition that the Master of Charms does the portrait of the residing Headmaster or Headmistress of Hogwarts. Albus just delayed this task until the very last moment.”
“Yeah, insane, boring, stupid – you keep telling us every evening. Makes one wonder, why you still keep watching?” Seamus teased.
“Yes, you do!” Hermione insisted, turning to Josh she added, “He also can’t get his Patronus to talk!”
“Ready!” sang Daisy. “Come and have a loo-ook!”
“Because… I’m pretty sure that you trust him… but if you ever start to doubt his intentions, you might want to remember what I said.” Josh sighed. “And I also wanted to tell you what I found out about his trouble with the damn tracker. Maybe this can even help to clear his name.”
or an insult – Harry had no chance of telling the difference. He walked back to his friends, careful not to spill more of their drinks.
When Tommy went back to his own table, Harry and Blaise sat down again.
Ron looked rather displeased by his girlfriend’s admiration for the young Auror and said, ”But he won’t stay at Hogwarts all the time, I guess? He must have more important stuff to do than watching Malfoy.”
Harry focused on the villain again.
“Yes, it’s fresh from the oven, still hot. I’m a bit picky with my bread, that’s why I always bake on Saturday mornings.” Odie took a seat next to Harry and refilled both their cups.
“To keep you company, of course! Ron only told me yesterday evening about your early morning routine… we would have been here every morning, if I had known before!” She shot her boyfriend an annoyed look. “How was your night? Did you find some sleep?”
Draco shook his head. “No. I think it’s time to do something I’ve been pondering all summer.” He withdrew his hand from Harry’s and gulped. “I’ll go Muggle.”
First of all he used the silencing charm once more, this time on his clothes and boots to prevent any noise from moving. It was dark all around, the only bright light came from a crack below the door to the room, where Draco was held hostage.
Draco looked concerned. “Are you alright? No offence, but you look like shit!”
He opened the door – and froze. Obviously Harry was not the first student awake. Draco Malfoy, fully dressed already, was sitting on a sofa in front of one large bay window. Legs stretched along the sofa he was sipping from a cup of tea and reading this book with the black cover again.
Soon enough Harry saw the lights of Hogsmeade from afar. He decided to make it quick and fly right into the hamlet, which was considered very rude. But nobody could see him anyway under his cloak and it was so much faster than walking. He swept between rooftops towards the Hogshead Inn, avoiding the smoke that rose from the chimneys.
“Brilliant!” Ron shouted, “it’s a shame Hermione won’t be able to come with us, but no way will she manage to fly long distance.”
“Ah, I see,” the Imagic said, “it is unfortunate that I can’t come along… you don’t have any suggestion what I might attempt today? I’ve been looking into more or less every painting of the castle without result but there must be something else I can do to help! The headmistress has no time for setting me a task… she is busy keeping the Aurors under control.”
Draco’s continued disappearance was worrying indeed. Not only had The Prophet covered the story of Taurus Malfoy’s capture, including a report about Harry’s injuries, but the Ministry had released several statements as well, clearing Draco’s name from any suspicion and asking him explicitly to return – yet he stayed away. Neither the Aurors searching nor the witcharding community of Edinburgh found any trace of his whereabouts.
Thank you all for reading along & for spreading the word!
Harry mused and hurried upstairs.
Fake Father Christmas looked concerned. “Are you in trouble, lad? We can talk about it if you want…”
was a means to keep his jealousy at bay. Because Harry was indeed jealous of Draco’s unknown friend, most likely ex-lover, who had the pleasure of hosting him. Harry needed to believe in
He nodded vigorously.
Cass laughed and hugged Harry tight. “Oh Harry, I’m just so, so happy for the two of you! And of course I’ll kick your ass, if you break Draco’s heart, superhero or not.”
“I’m afraid I have to go fetch my owl now. Thanks for the tea, you’re an excellent, if adventurous cook! And I’m looking forward to seeing you again soon.”
“Don’t you remember me, darling?” fake-Draco said with mock disappointment. “Oooh, have you forgotten me already? You’re breaking my heart, Harry!”
Draco dropped his gaze and drew a deep breath, “Do you mind?”
Harry chuckled before asking, “What is it you wanted to talk about?”
“You freak!” Laddley hissed. “You are not only a pervert but stupid as well! Haven’t I made it perfectly clear to you that I want none of your sorts in my pool?”
“Well, actually –“ Hermione started to say –
“Very,” Harry nodded solemnly before he addressed Ron again, “If it’s any consolation to you – I also had no clue about Ginny and Cass until yesterday evening.”
“Give us some credit, mate,” Ron added, “Plus– anything that’s important to you is important to us as well. Mind you, I still don’t care much for the bloke, but as you insist on becoming friends with him… and Ginny as well…” Ron gulped.
“Of course she will! It only happens about once in a century that the library gives one of the patrons total access!”
Any ideas? (Comments, lovely readers, comments!)
“Starving? Excuse me!” Hermione glared incredulously at her boy-friend, “You’ve just had a huge slice of ham and a leek pie, not to mention a load of chips –“
“I know it’s got nothing to do with me,” Ginny looked confused, “why should it?”
“At the moment it looks like a Jack Russel with an otter’s fur,” Ron grinned again.
“It’s a shame that Auror Jordan has to leave Hogwarts,” said Harry, “and I’m certain all the other students will feel the same. He’s an excellent teacher, you know.”
“It’s good to have a bit of blokes-only time,” Ron slapped Harry’s back as they walked along, “don’t you think? Mind you, I can’t get enough of Hermione, now that we are finally together… I find it still hard to believe that she’s settled for me, you know – but yet… it won’t hurt her, when we spend some time apart. Maybe she’s even glad not to see my stupid face all the time?” Ron grinned but Harry could hear a touch of insecurity in his voice. He was painfully aware of his best friend’s lack in self-confidence.
“Will you bring Teddy as well? Or do you want to ask Molly to keep an eye on him while you are at my place?”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry,” said Kingsley, “we are well aware, that you have encountered many unique and extraordinary displays of magic no other witch or wizard has seen before – you shouldn’t forget that either.”
Hearing the House-elf refer to Number Twelve by his own name, Harry was oddly touched and realised that he must indeed have gained Kreacher’s full loyalty.
“And of course she wants us all to be safe, I’m sure about it and that's why she'll be an excellent teacher,” Harry said. They had finally climbed the staircase to Gryffindor Tower. “Does anyone know the password by the way?”
As far as Harry had been told, Laddley had only been well enough for interrogation a few days ago, after the disaster at the pub. Therefore his statement contained barely any news but rather confirmed what the investigators had assumed all along.
The Imagic hesitated before he continued, “Mr Potter, please allow me to bring up another topic – may I ask you how Mr Malfoy is doing? I hope he is well? You seemed rather… close when we met a few weeks ago at your common room, that’s why I’m asking.”
“What’s that?” Ron looked confused. “What have I missed? Oh, I get it– you’re talking about Josh. You’re still into him? Inconvenient, falling for a teacher.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There was a flickering light behind drawn curtains of two first-floor windows. Following an impulse Harry hovered in mid-air and peeked inside, making use of a gap between the curtains – and nearly lost his balance on the broom! He had to steady himself because the sight was horrifying – surely that could not be true? He must have hallucinations!
Hermione and Ron were waiting for him as usual and Draco also seemed reluctant to leave before Harry did.
“Stop it, Ron! That’s not funny! I’m sick of these damn superhero jokes!”
Hermione smiled and said, “You have been snoring for some time, but don’t worry, it was highly entertaining.”
“Poor chap, must be tough to have a brother like that,” said Ron.
Daisy narrowed her eyes. She took Ariana’s hand and turned to her new found friend. “I think I’ll call my pet now, Ariana. He might look a bit grim but he won’t hurt you, I promise – so don’t be frightened!”
“Three butterbeers, please,” Harry said when it was his call, “and may I ask you – where’s your boss? Aberforth Dumbledore? I’d hoped to see him.”
“No! That is not what I meant!” Harry shouted. He felt a sting of unpleasant truth in the words of his enemy. “Whoever that is, let them go! This is crazy for fuck’s sake!” And he rocked and wriggled some more in his chair.
“Once a month –
“No need to apologise, Ms Silver,” Flitwick said, “none of what has happened is any of you fault! Maybe you can even help us to solve this crime! The first question is – can you describe those men, how they looked like? The strange artist and the young man?”
Harry secretly thought it would be best to destroy both Elder Wand and Resurrection Stone in public – to let the witcharding world see they were gone. But if the Headmistress came up with another idea, he would be willing to listen.
Finally the dreaded question.
“Top priority – keeping Draco safe.” Harry said without hesitation. “Which is easier said than done. He’s willing to come back as soon as I let him know, he’ll trust my judgement of the situation. But… maybe he is safer at his hiding place? Or would he be better off here at school? What shall I tell him?” Harry had not shared anything about their secret communication before, but he really needed Hermione’s opinion on this.
“That’s certainly one way to put it,” Kingsley seemed amused.
“And because the Tracking Spell didn’t work properly, you assume he left secretly and Apparated back to London for a few hours, ran to the Ministry and abducted an Imagic? Seriously?” Harry shook his head. “I don’t think he is even capable of wandless Apparation and his wand was still confiscated at that time.”
“Harry, how can I describe the Manor’s horror to you? Just remember what Walburga Black’s Imagic did to your house and multiply this effect... that’s about what it was like at the Manor when Draco and I were kids. Growing up I was mostly able to ignore those ghastly Imagics, but Draco was –he still is– very sensitive… don’t look so doubtful, Harry, you have no idea… anyway he was really frightened, didn’t want to enter some corridors by himself and had nightmares. Uncle Lucius considered this behaviour ridiculous and did nothing but tease Draco, which made matters worse. Aunt Cissy was devastated. That’s when Taurus jumped in and proclaimed he would do something to help. I think he always fancied Aunt Cissy and wanted to impress her with a gift. Poor mother.”
“So it seems.”
Harry hesitated a bit before he continued, ”Both Cass and you seem to get along very well with Ginny, don’t you?”
“Very well.” Josh exhaled deeply. “You’re good to go.”
They stared at each other for a moment until Draco said, “Do you have a minute? I’d like to… you know… explain something.”
Memory after memory flashed through Harry’s mind: Ginny stating Draco’s handsomeness on the train. Draco smiling at Ginny and laughing with her. Ginny and Draco dancing together last Saturday. Even Draco snapping at Seamus just minutes ago, probably to protect Ginny– suddenly it all made sense. They were in love. Harry felt sick. So that’s why Draco attempted to befriend Harry! That’s why he was polite with Hermione and Ron! It was all about Ginny and had nothing to do with Harry at all.
Cass smiled at him, “She and Draco went cross country running with some others from Josh’s class – early morning sports, can you believe it?”
“What’s that?” a flash of anger crossed his opponant’s face.
“When did you first spot it? And for how long did Draco keep it on the wall when he moved in?”
Harry shook his head, “No! No, I’m fine, thanks… I’d just like to speak to Draco, please.”
“Well… we started to talk to each other again on the Floo some time ago,” Andromeda seemed a little bit reluctant to confess to that. “It all started with a note of condolence she sent me after the war… and I had the feeling she meant it. She is… Narcissa is not a bad person, Harry. I am glad you accepted her invitation and before you ask – it was her own idea to invite you, not mine.”
“The library does this?” Harry felt even more confused.
Harry had heard more than enough. Adrenalin and hot anger were flushing his body. He removed the cloak, stood up and said, “Thank you Tommy, that was very brave of you!” Then he stepped closer to face his teacher.
The seat to Draco’s right was still empty, even without a place mat – but not for long.
Harry dreaded to be questioned about Draco when he met with Ron and Hermione after breakfast. But his friends seemed to sense that he did not want to talk about it, neither of them mentioned Draco. They sat in Harry’s room, did some homework together and pondered the still unsolved mystery of missing Imagics – but carefully stepped around the issue of Harry’s changed relationship with his former adversary. Several times Harry caught Ron gawping at him, but never did his best pal dare to ask what was actually going on. He was quite grateful for their reticence as he would not have known what to tell them. Harry felt he had done all he could do and now it was Draco’s turn to make up his mind.
“So that’s why she’s so good at martial arts!” Harry said. “The witchards of the far east are all supposed to be brilliant fighters.”
“Mrs Malfoy!” Harry gasped and asked Laddley, “Does she know? What her husband did to your brother?”
Harry raised his eyebrows, wondering what she was insinuating, when a tiny bird chirped at the open window and reminded Harry of Otto.
Fifteen minutes later Harry stood in front of Draco’s door, woollen coat in his hand and heart pounding. He took a deep breath and knocked.
“Quiet please!” shouted McGonagall’s rising from her place at the staff table. “Good evening students! I am very happy to be back in time for the drawing of the motto for our Halloween ball! Thank you for all your contributions, I am sure there are many brilliant ideas to be found in this pumpkin. But only one motto will be chosen…”
Draco nodded solemnly. “I think it’ll do me good. Find a job, make a living.” He looked at his hands. “I’ll never regain my reputation in our world, no matter what. I’ll always be Malfoy – rich but still the youngest Death Eater ever, not to be trusted.”
“Yeah, the Auror department seems to be pretty secretive about their working tools, if even Hermione Granger has never stumbled across their spells,” Ron teased his girlfriend.
“Come in,” cried Flitwick as soon as Harry, Hermione and Ron knocked at the door to his office.
“Good idea,” said Harry, then he turned to Hannah Abbot, “Hannah and the Hufflepuff prefects, would you do the same for your fellows? That’s great, thank you. And finally… looks like there’s no prefect from Slytherin with us but quite a number of younger students… Draco and Blaise, could you two walk your lot back to the dungeons?”
Aberforth snorted. “Fight? That’s hardly the right word… Lucius Malfoy’s cussedness more likely. But Malfoy got away with it as usual. Well, now he’s locked up for different reasons and that’s that.”
“But – why not? If you… you like me? Why wouldn’t you want to get involved with me?”
“Oh, but you could well be a famous magical artist one day,” Luna said with dreamy eyes, “cause you draw and paint really well.” She turned to Harry and continued, “Dean drew such a nice picture of me with carbon pencil and even managed to make my image wink at him!” she said proudly.
“Having you with me, that’ll feel like having a backup! To be honest, I don’t like the idea of being alone with her, I mean, she will be accompanied by an Auror anyway, but it’s different to have someone I trust at my side.”
“Oh, don’t pretend to be bored, Dray! I won’t believe it for a second.” Cass said. “Admit it, you enjoy dancing as much as I do – otherwise I’ll dance with Ginny instead.”
Harry was pleased by his pet’s affection, yet disappointed by Otto’s continued refusal to deliver a letter to Draco. Narcissa blamed the broken secrecy spell for his behaviour, but insited he might still be able to find Draco, if only Harry accompanied him in the air – hence her eagerness for Harry’s full recovery.
Kingsley was just opening his mouth to reply when McGonagall cut in. “First things first. Before we start talking about this painting’s ownership and provenience we have to get our colleagues out of it.”
Suddenly so many things from the past made sense – Draco’s absurd and megalomaniac attempts of killing Dumbledore, his constant hostility towards Harry –
Draco gasped. “Seriously? You think I’ve got a problem with you being gay?” He stared at Harry. “That is… beyond absurd. I’m just not used to your gay fan-club! I’m ever so sorry, but I don’t enjoy the attention you draw to our group… or to our table as much as you do!”
The music stopped and all eyes were upon them. Professor Flitwick scuttled towards them from the beginners’ corner.
“Shit. I shouldn’t have passed my ticket to Ginny,” Ron said, wiping his eyes.
“Looks good to me,” Harry said. “I’ll have a closer look at the whole thing later, want to swim some laps first…”
And what if they caught Draco under cover of the Invisibility Cloak? That would be proof of Harry’s abetting. He was not concerned for his own reputation, but he dreaded to be cut off from the investigation. Would Ron and Hermione keep searching for proof of Draco’s innocence, if Harry was banned to do so? Should he try to open the door again in an hour? Or instead send a message to Draco? He didn’t dare using his Patronus, the silvery stag was far too easily spotted. What the fuck was he supposed to do?
“Hi, Hagrid – good to see you again,” mumbled Harry pressed against Hagrid’s chest by the full force of a bear-hug.
Another.
They all ordered Full Magical Breakfasts with tea and as they munched their way through servings of cackling cereal and freaking fried eggs Harry gave his friends a detailed report of yesterday’s events.
Of course they had discussed other options as well, like Tommy offering to recount his previous experience under the influence of Veritaserum. But the use of this potion was restricted to Ministry enquiries only and if the Ministry officials were informed, the whole matter would blow up, which Tommy preferred to avoid. Harry had reasons of his own, why he didn’t want the Ministry involved, as he feared for the Imagic enquiry’s confidentiality.
“When the sky is clear, you can see mountains at the horizon,” Harry said. He felt ridiculously proud of his home, because this is what Hogwarts meant to him: home. And whatever turmoil his emotions were giving him, he was right where he was meant to be, at the place he loved and cherished, the place he had fought for.
“ – exactly Mr Potter, the very one.” Flitwick nodded. “Apparently they are preparing a case to clear Taurus Malfoy and to remove his name from the Wanted-List. And if they get away with their claim, his chances of legal succession would be intact again.”
He watched the hands of the clock above the entrance door. The training was supposed to begin in twenty minutes. Laddley was a creature of habit and always came timely before the lesson started to prepare training equipment, check the water’s temperature and cleanness. He must appear any minute now.
Taurus Malfoy wailed, Pinkie shrieked one last time – and in slow motion the two of them tipped over the now open edge of the floor. The raptor flapped his powerful wings and rose up into the night, his claws drawn into Taurus Malfoy’s chest.
Now Draco looked positively shocked. “Azkaban? What for?”
“Not at all, I guess I feel the same about this place, have been up here many hours over the years.”
“That’ll be Hermione Granger? Draco says she’s the best of your year, ‘
“He never visited at all, which is not surprising. The archives don’t hold Muggle items.” McGonagall rolled the parchment further down and sighed again. “Which brings me to unpleasant news, I am afraid. When going through the records of all visitors during the last week of August, one name stood out. According to the registry on Friday the twenty-eighth of August a person presently staying at Hogwarts visited the Magical Arts section. Yet, it is not a teacher, but a student – Draco Malfoy.”
“Count yourself lucky but don’t pity me. Muggle school was great and I learned a lot. The school I attended is very progressive and one thing I really, really liked was the school’s gender awareness policy. We had support groups and discussions and a zero tolerance policy concerning gender related bullying, homophobia and any other kind of discrimination. Tell you what, I miss this at Hogwarts. In general our magical society is rather tolerant and our sole problem with hate crime seems to be racism against Muggle-borns. But I still feel that under the surface of tolerance there is in fact a lot of ignorance.”
“Hogwarts has a life of its own, haven’t you realized that by now? The castle can sprout rooms… like a tree might sprout new branches. I’m sure if there are students desperately in need for a secret room to hide in, the castle will provide for them, same as it did in the past.” Aberforth grinned, “But I guess you didn’t come to see me to discuss Hogwarts’ architecture – although this is a fascinating subject.”
Harry blushed. Molly Weasley had become most certainly his surrogate mother since their first encounter, years ago at Kingscross station. And as much as he loved her, he was not looking forward to one of her lengthy lectures today.
“No, it’s fine,” Harry mumbled, “I can eat later. Maybe I’ll heat up your fry, when Andromeda comes home.”
“So you’re not totally stupid, apparently? The way you fell into my little trap like a real simpleton made me question the Dark Lord’s abilities. If he was indeed defeated by an ignorant teenager, the world of dark magic is far better off without him.” The blonde man smirked. “Anyway … keep on shouting, go on! You can even call for help, if you want to. This room is as good as soundproof, nobody will hear you.”
“Ouch,” said Blaise, “and you’re such a Cassandra, one might forget your full name is Cassiopeia. But, Harry, maybe next week we could do morning workouts? Before breakfast, how about that?”
Cass pulled away from her aunt. She snuffled and said, “Hi, Harry… I guess I’ve got to go now.” She nodded at Josh and stood up.
“Why did you never tell me –“ Harry stopped mid-sentence, as Hermione was led to the dance floor by Ron. They were no match for Draco and Cass, but still did very well, compared to other couples. Their bodies just seemed so comfortable together… one could actually see how much they loved each other. Harry sighed.
Draco was white as a sheet. His mouth twitched as if he wanted to say something but he kept quiet and just stared at Harry.
'- self-praise stinks, they say.” Hermione smirked.
Right after Frank, Draco entered the kitchen. He froze and stared at Harry in total surprise, white as a sheet for a second – then flushing violently.
“You’re way too late Harry! Ginny and Cass just left, you should have seen them dancing the Tango… wow, that was hot,” Seamus said with a dirty grin.
“I know!” Draco shouted back, “I’m going to the gym! You, Professor Jordan, gave us the option to choose between swimming and working out at the gym. Well, I’ve changed my mind, okay?”
“Well, in that case, Mr Malfoy, you might simply want to demonstrate your abilities?”
Nobody mentioned the obvious, at least not within Harry’s earshot: Taurus Malfoy must have kept nearby. Thanks to the secret binding between Harry and Draco, Taurus had not been able to follow Otto or to remove the letter. Still he must have tried and in the course of it he had hurt the owl and broken the secret connection.
“Girl power, that’s what it’s called nowadays, right? You are as crazy as my freak of a daughter, Potter!”
“Nice choice indeed, Mr Potter,” said Draco and his smile was genuine and so warm that Harry’s heart beat faster. “Looks as if you’ve done part of my home-work already.”
As they were now free for the rest of the afternoon, most students were in a hurry to leave. Harry cleared his desk and tried to focus on the next task at hand. He looked at his watch– still one hour until swim training would start, that should do.
Harry groaned.
The headmistress went on, “Kingsley says this is not unusual because the Probation Tracking Spell is less than perfect. Nobody talks about it, because they don’t want delinquents to know. I told him in no uncertain terms that this is highly unprofessional of course! The Ministry must fund research for a proper spell as reliable as the Under Age Magic Tracker, which was developed at Hogwarts and works perfectly as we all know.”
Well, apparently not only in love and war.”
“Don’t be daft, Harry, of course not. The Weasleys are pure-bloods but Arthur and Molly would never do such a thing. It might be different for kids from very traditional families, though. I assume their parents let them know what they expect, but I cannot believe that many a kid today is as obedient as Narcissa used to be.”
The rest of the morning Harry spent browsing through the library of No 12 collected by the Black family over centuries. All the shelves were full so fortunately Mundungus Fletcher had stayed clear of the library and not nicked any book. As was to be expected some of the volumes dealt with dark magic, which could still be quite useful for his intended career of becoming an Auror.
“Tim… Mr Potter, he was far more than just handsome or good looking. Tim was downright beautiful. I was his brother, so I was used to his looks, but I was well aware of people staring at him, wherever we went. Tim was tall and slender with the face of a Hellenic god, amber curls down to his shoulders and ridiculously blue eyes. Luckily he was anything but vain, most of the time Tim was unaware of the attention he caused. In fact he was still very much a child, a prodigy painter. As far as I knew he had never been in love before, neither with a girl or a boy.
“Professor Laddley is such a good teacher, Harry,” she said earnestly, as if she were in a place to assess teachers, “pity you don’t take Muggle Studies.”
At McGonagall’s left side Harry saw another well-known face that still gave him a start: Severus Snape’s portrait stared at him from its black metal frame with a stern expression, Harry found oddly familiar from many a Potions lesson.
The formerly naked lady blushed while both Da Ponte’s and Nightingale’s Imagic patted her shoulders encouragingly and she began to tell her story.
“Yes, you most certainly are, my dear,” said Nightingale’s Imagic squeezing her hand. “But go on – tell us about what happened this summer.”
Harry floated through the rest of the afternoon smiling. Being way too excited for a nap he stopped by Ron’s and Hermione’s rooms. His friends were busy removing all the changes they had made to their place, when he broke the news, that he would not accompany them, but go with Draco instead.
Harry shook his head in disbelief, “So you think somebody tampered with the portrait while it was stored at the archives? In that case he must still be there, in any of the other paintings…”
Harry nodded.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was unmistakeably a stag. Slightly smaller than Harry’s and with fewer antlers – but without doubt the same animal.
Cass chuckled, “That’s a funny way of describing your sweetheart – ‘
“What?” Blaise shouted. “What have I done? And it’s dinner time soon!”
“But… if that’s possible – how come none of the Aurors tried it when they took down the other portraits?” Harry asked suspiciously.
“Right, fresh start!” Kingsley said, “How about I treat the whole matter like any other case of the Auror Department? This way Harry even learns a thing or two about our work.” As McGonagall and Flitwick nodded their agreement, he raised his wand and shouted “
“You ok, Harry?” she asked softly. “Your friends are cool about it, by the way.”
“I most certainly don’t want that Sorores Cup,” Andromeda said. “You were quite right not to bring it to my home. Honestly if I never see Bellatrix’s face again, that’ll be just fine with me.”
“Right,” Harry said oddly touched by Draco’s disregard for his own interests. “But if you want to support your cousin, then you better hurry to your mum and sort out, whatever problem the Ministry has with your tracking spell. Hard to grasp as it is, Cass really loves you and she needs you to be at Hogwarts next week. And believe it or not, I like her and I have no intentions whatsoever of harming her. So fuck off – you prick!”
Harry sighed. He was not at all interested in whatever bizarre reason Laddley had for getting involved in Taurus Malfoy’s wicked schemes. Laddley hated Lucius Malfoy, probably had been promised some money as well. Whatever.
Aberforth nodded without a word and pointed at a small gate at the back of the garden.
“Flip-a-dilly charm? I love her dearly but…” she snorted.
“That’s about the last thing I remember from that night. When I woke up next morning, I felt sick and had a terrible headache, couldn’t remember a single face from the guests – but otherwise I was unharmed.
“How about a leash and a muzzle? Would that make it easier? You could ask Flitwick to paint some,” Harry suggested silently bemused by Snape’s fear of a toy poodle. Thinking of animals to be afraid of, Harry asked, “Where’s Daisy, by the way? She’s alright, I hope?”
Harry sighed. Whom was he trying to fool? Draco most likely had a problem with Harry being gay. Although this made no sense, considering Draco had known about it for weeks. Plus he adored his lesbian cousin.
And now Harry stood in front of this house, nervous and quite at loss how to proceed. The Aurors waited in the fields outside of the town for his message. As soon as he had spoken to Draco, Harry was supposed to send his Patronus their way, confirming that everything was alright. Josh had it made perfectly clear, that he expected a message within one hour – otherwise they would come searching for Harry and Draco.
“Harry,” McGonagall said, “calm down. Do I really have to remind you, that in his attempts to kill Dumbledore he wounded innocent others – Ron Weasley among them?”
Excited by these news many students started to talk, speculating what kind of activity they would be offered and exchanging what they knew about Muggle sports. Headmistress McGonagall let them continue for a bit, before she clapped her hands.
Laddley’s room without me being present! You will have to wait until I have talked to
As the large painting of Wizard’s Wood belonged to the Headmistress’ sitting room and the enquiry was more or less over – disregarding the painful fact that Draco and Dumbledore’s Imagic were still missing – naturally the painting had been returned to its usual place. Harry stepped closer to look at its replacement. Oh well, he knew that crazy bugger.
“That went rather well, if I say so myself,” Narcissa said proudly. “I certainly would appreciate some tea now.”
“Frolicking indeed,” the Imagic nodded and the door swung open.
“Alright, alright, mum’s a star. I just wish she would have started to shine
Harry assumed.
Soon enough it was time to change for the ball. Harry had been quite clueless what to wear for weeks. A gown was out of the question. He had tried it but, unlike Ron, he felt totally uncomfortable in a dress. Ignoring the ball’s motto was also no option. In the end Hermione had saved him just a few days ago.
Gregory Laddley squirmed and said, “Well, I’m willing to give it a try… not totally sure about the outcome, though.”
“No idea. Spur of the moment, I guess?” Harry grinned. “Glad you’re having fun by the way. I haven’t heard you laugh half as much in eight years.”
To Harry’s delight Draco blushed violently and grumbled, “Shut up, Zabini.”
– had been. At least he was not gagged, but the binding was thorough.
Draco’s voice was much softer and somewhat defensive. “Believe it or not, Blaise, I regard privacy very highly – mine as well as others. And someone’s sexual orientation is nothing to gossip about.”
The following morning Harry was having breakfast with Ron and Hermione at The Early Bird, a small café in Diagon Alley. He had picked up his pet at the owl shop after another night of post-owl training before meeting his friends. Otto was most pleased to see Hermione again. As soon as the owl spotted her, he abandoned Harry’s shoulder for the armrest of Hermione’s chair and made soft little noises towards her.
“Well at least Draco’s mum makes good use of it,” Harry said, “She told me about other nasty Imagics she locked into the hexed painting.”
The interior of the hall had been rearranged for the festivities. Most of the furniture was gone except for the staff table, leaving the middle space empty for the opening dance. Students had started to gather around the room close to the walls, which were draped in rainbow-coloured hangings. Candle-lit pumpkins were shining from above and trays with mugs of spiced apple juice floated around.
As soon as Harry was done, Draco tapped Otto with his wand and murmured ‘
“So, what’s a sisters cup then?” he asked, “is it just a memento or does it have some specific use?”
Ron coughed, “Where’s… you know… Malfoy?”
“Before you ask,” Draco said in a surprisingly calm voice without turning around, “no, it wasn’t always a stag. It used to be a whippet… a nice dog actually.”
“Well, well…,“ Blaise went on, “that’s one hell of a chance for you? Don’t you think?”
Harry shook his head in disbelief. “I never expected her to have such a good opinion of me. Not with her son and I fighting each other for years.”
Meanwhile they had passed the main entrance of the castle and were heading for the dungeons as today's first lesson was Potions.
Harry just grinned and nodded.
After a few seconds of awkward silence Draco said, “You’re… really good at this,” he paused for a second and added, “Harry.”
“Good thinking, Harry!” said McGonagall with a smile, “I shall ask them immediately.”
“Before I’ll explain, why I wanted to see you, let me ask: How are you, Harry? How is your health? And what do you think of the new regime at our school, do you like it?”
“Miss Granger has of course no idea what you are talking about, Irma,” said McGonagall dryly and Harry was somewhat relieved that at least the Headmistress had returned to her usual matter-of-fact way of talking.
Odie beamed at Harry. “That is so lovely, Harry! And what a sweet pet name for David! Draco – how cute is that!”
“What?” Ron looked taken aback. “But… why would you?”
Harry gasped when a most devastating idea hit him
“Blimey, Hermione,” Ron said pulling a face, “don’t give yourself an ulcer about Malfoy! If Harry is cool about it, you should be as well. One might think
“No!” Tommy shouted. “I mean, it’s fine Harry. Just leave it, ok?” He seemed to be really uncomfortable about Harry’s suggestion.
“Searching for Draco of course,” Harry found it alarmingly easy to lie to his friends. “I haven’t seen him after dinner… no idea, what’s gotten into him now.” He shook his head as if disappointed.
He glanced across the table at Draco Malfoy’s mat – and had to admit that it was of exquisite beauty. Lots of green and blue lines formed a vivid picture of waves, with some yellow and bright red highlights looking like sunshine glittering on water.
“Well, well, Mr Dumbledore, that’s quite enough talking for now,” Madame Pomfrey interrupted. “You’ve just made an exhausting apparition and need to rest. If you want to get as well as Mr Potter here, who’s ready to leave my ward, you better do what I tell you, alright?”
“Well done, Cass,” he said with as much enthusiasm as he could master.
“That’s enough, Kreacher,” Harry interrupted. “Thank you!” Then he addressed the other House-elves. “And thank you so much for coming! I completely understand you have no obligation to talk to me.” He was well aware that they were bound to the school and not to him, like Kreacher was.
“You want me to sit on an easel too, Professor?” Draco asked with raised eye-brows.
Draco seemed to be intrigued by Harry’s fascination for the painting. He rose from his sofa, picked up both of their mugs and stepped next to Harry handing him his tea. ”Pity, you don’t like it – I think it’s beautiful… very calming to look at.”
Harry sighed, “That’s why I have to hurry back. If they realize both of us are missing, they’ll assume we are together. So I’m going to pretend being clueless about where you are and to be only a little bit flattered by your attention but not really into you – that should do the trick.”
“What about Potions? You always said I’m rubbish at Potions?” Cass was obviously relieved that Draco finally joined their conversation.
Narcissa Malfoy started to draw the curtain with the uttermost care and said politely, “How do you do, Aunt Walburga?”
The applause following her speech was immediate and roaring, all the seventh- and eighth-year students at Harry’s table got up and cheered on top volume. Harry was unsure whether McGonagall’s or Draco’s face was the one showing more pride and delight.
Harry looked at Hermione and sighed.
Cass beamed at Harry, “Oh Harry, Draco will be del–…,” she caught herself before adding, “It’s none of my business, but I guess you are in for a surprise.” She grinned mysteriously.
“Listen, girlie –“ Aberforth started to reply but Madame Pomfrey was having none of it.
“Well, you heard the Headmistress, she had outstanding grades in every single D.A.D.A. exam… Merlin, I had no idea about that… mind you, we’ve had a subscription of
“Really?” Harry stared at here.
“Well, we are
“But… that’s awful, Josh! Why are you suspended? What for?”
Harry hesitated for a second before he turned to the door of the tea house. It might be a bit awkward facing Cass, now that he knew so much about her personal life. Still, as she had agreed on letting him in on her story, she seemed willing to trust him. What really worried him was Malfoy’s reaction. Would Draco behave even more hostile than usual? Would he be protective of Cass? Jealous? Harry felt he had to brace himself, before going through that door.
Harry stared at his friends. “Are you sure? I haven’t time to take another shower and change before dinner!”
Why, oh why not? I crave your comments, they delight me - so please don't be shy, spill it out, babe!
“Hello - good to see the musician who has entertained me all morning,” the Healer replied, “name’s Joe O’Malley and I’m living downstairs, just below this room – so I’ve heard you play!”
“Hey, Malfoy, your mother is looking for you-“ Harry started to say.
“Brilliant idea!” Hermione beamed at Cass, “I wish I had come up with that thought!”
“You’re going to Hogsmeade?” Ron asked while loading his plate with roast and potatoes. “Can I come too? Sound’s much better than finishing my Charms essay…”, but after one look at his girlfriend he added, “… oh well, I guess it’s going to be the essay instead.”
“For Merlin’s sake, I hope we will! Amanda and Serena most certainly were not fooled for a second as well,” said McGonagall, “they knew exactly what they were doing… I trust we will know more, as soon as they get back… it just seems to take them a little longer than we guessed.”
"Perfect!” Hermione beamed. “Anyway, how did you know it was Otto you wanted to choose among the owls? I mean, he is a real sweetie, but I guess the others were cute as well?" Hermione asked while stroking the soft patch of feathers between Otto’s ears. The owl tried to return the favour by nuzzling Hermione’s hair, which made her squeak.
Ron grinned. “If you say so… who am I to contradict a superhero?”
“Kreacher has not seen any Imagic where it should not be,” the House-elf answered eagerly, “but Kreacher works mostly in the kitchen.”
Arthur Weasley cleared his voice and turned towards the Deputy Headmaster.
Then he got up, pulled at his hair and knelt down next to Otto’s chair.
“What does your dad say about that Laddley guy?” Harry asked Ron.
willing to do, to get you out of this mess. If I have to lie, so be it.”
“Don’t be like that, Harry, it’s actually kind of sweet. People will languish at your love story for ages as soon as this gets out!”
“Don’t look at me, I refuse!” said the Imagic with a flushed face. “Stepping in for the Fat Lady is one thing, but I will not visit that… that lady of easy virtue again! Even if she were dressed properly! It was embarrassing enough to get Mephisto out of that dreadful painting – and by the way, she kept quiet for all the while I was there, did not even respond when I asked her about the dog’s name.”
“… any other magic portrait of himself!” Harry finished the sentence.
I thought Cass must be a trans-boy and why hadn’t he ever told me?
Harry was surprised. “How come you know about that? Me wanting to become an Auror, I mean?” They took some more steps upwards, turned yet another corner and Harry was totally lost– he was quite certain he had never been to this part of the castle before.
Trying to get a hold of her before dinner he headed for the Headmistress’ office. Just as he turned into the corridor at the foot of the enchanted staircase Harry stopped in his tracks. McGonagall was walking towards him – accompanied by Laddley. Harry had completely forgotten that this evening the Muggle Studies teacher had to decide whether he would leave Hogwarts or stay under McGonagall’s conditions.
“Wow – that must be a crib-charmer! Those toys are incredibly rare and valuable!” Hermione exclaimed.
“At the Room of Requirement of course. Just go upstairs, search the corridor where it used to be and focus. You should be desperate enough, I’m pretty sure you will find it at your service.” Harry prayed that Aberforth was right about this. “I’ll meet you there as soon as possible, so make sure the room will let me in but nobody else, okay?”
It was actually nice to be on friendly terms with Josh – not even slightly embarrassing. When Ron and Hermione teased Harry about it, he just grinned. But he could not help noticing, that some of the other students seemed irritated about it. Especially Draco Malfoy.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair. “What was that about? Aberforth behaves as if I wanted to expose Laddley! At the same time he insists that Lucius Malfoy was the one causing trouble – and for what it’s worth, I’m inclined to believe that… so why would it hurt Laddley, if people knew, what happened all those years ago?”
“Says the show-off, who quotes weird foreign proverbs,” Ron shot back.
Harry thought with a nod. “He’ll be teaching right now but I’ll ask him at lunch, promise!”
“Seriously?! You are joking, right?” Harry stared at her. “Cups for girls and sticks for boys – that’s unbelievably…”
Harry sat straight in his chair. “You know how to charm pictures?” he asked Dean who just shrugged.
Ron nodded. “Just… be careful, Harry. He’s… I know he’s not half as bad as we thought him to be but still… even if he’s no longer a Death Eater, he’s still a fucking Slytherin!”
“Wow, you can talk to animals!” Luna was awestruck.
Draco flushed and stepped immediately to the train corridor.
Tavin rolled his eyes at Harry and silently mouthed, “Tough lot, Harry…”
“Nah, no worries. He’s teething and Andromeda said he didn’t get much sleep last night – I suppose, neither did she. He fell asleep an hour ago, so I took the chance to throw some cooked lunch together. I’m bored of sandwiches lately.”
He desperately needed a distraction and was glad to see Cass and Ginny approaching. They were holding hands and looked radiant with joy.
Harry was glad to see Aberforth far more relaxed than before the war, he looked even healthier.
He stood up and grabbed for his bag. The handle cutting into his palm made him wince.
“And you truly believe you would be the only Krum present?” Draco laughed at Seamus, “Lo and behold! The sweetness of simple minded Gryffindors!”
“Frankly I’m not too keen on speaking with Kingsley at the moment,” Josh said, “but it’s your decision of course. If you want to do this the official way, you can tell him and I will back off. But be warned – it might take longer to get those records, if the Auror Office files an official request, longer than using my contacts.”
“He absolutely hated being painted,” Phineas Nigellus said, “that’s why he had postponed it for years. Only when he knew about his imminent death, two years ago, he finally submitted. Sitting for the painting he moaned and complained like a lunatic. I used to tease him about it, saying
A sudden bark from the painting of Wizards’ Woods made them turn their heads. A man and a woman were walking under bare trees, both dressed in formal black robes, and a black poodle was chasing them between the tree trunks.
Finally it was half past four and Harry had nothing else to do than wait for his date. He stared at the hands of his watch, suspecting they were frozen in time, when a soft knock made him jump. He opened the door and –
“May I remind you, neither of you did any homework yesterday – so you’ve enjoyed one fat break already this week-end!” she replied.
“No, Minerva, not yet. I have just convinced Mr Potter to take a seat and have a little chat until Miss Dumbledore is done with her drawing.” Flitwick said. “Tsk, tsk, you Gryffindors are an impatient lot.”
Laddley shook his head.
“Well, she’s not my girlfriend anymore. We split up over a year ago.” Harry said slightly embarrassed.
McGonagall opened a roll of parchment lying on her desk. “I took notes… both Professor Tharros and Professor Jordan paid several visits to the archives during the summer months, which is not unusual at all. Preparing for classes often requires research especially for new teachers. But neither of them went to the archives after mid-August and if our esteemed Imagics remember correctly, and we have no reason to doubt this –“ several of the Imagics around the walls murmured their approval, “– Albus’ Imagic disappeared sometime during the last week of August. So both Jordan’s and Tharros’ visits seem to be unsuspicious.
“Is it true that the UN set great value on anti-discrimination of any kind?” Tavin asked innocently.
at the Burrow as long as I can remember, but I always assumed this was dad’s thing! Come to think of it the journal mostly rests on her bedside table, not on dad’s.” Ron shook his head. “When mum was always pushing us kids to excel in Defence, I thought it’s because she wants us to be safe – not because she’s an ace in this!”
“You know what? I’m starting to reconsider the offer – maybe it is better you do get back to school right away – all those missed lessons, remember?” said Odie.
What was to be done now? Even if the disguise of the cloak worked perfectly, he was aware that by opening the door he would give himself away immediately. Was Taurus Malfoy lurking in some corner, ready to curse as soon as Harry entered the room? The cloak would not protect him from any spell.
– never ever open any book without Master’s order! But Kreacher had to clean after the –
“Which it won’t!” said Hermione with an encouraging smile at Harry. Suddenly she dropped her wand, which she had pointed at the newly mended wall between their rooms, and Harry found himself wrapped in a thight hug, her tuft of brown hair in his face.
Harry thought,
Harry was immediately reminded of the kiss he had witnessed on the Sorores Cup.
“Harry! – Mum! – Merlin’s freaking belly button!” Ron croaked, “My mum’s going to be a teacher!”
Hannah went for her favourite bright peach and everybody agreed, Draco looked quite horrible in it. Even worse was Neville’s choice of military green.
“Seriously?” Harry crossed his arms in front of his chest, “You don’t talk to me for two days –no fucking word for Merlin’s sake!– and this is the first thing you have to say to me?” He shook his head, “You’re such a jerk. Once and for all I think Josh Jordan is an excellent teacher and a fine chap as well – but I’m not into him, okay?”
Harry thought, Sylvia Silver’s Imagic was meant to see ‘Draco’ in case she should talk after all. Luckily enough neither Taurus Malfoy nor his accomplice had been aware of the House-elves observant demeanour. Harry wanted to smack himself for being nearly as ignorant as them. Why the fuck had it taken him so long to interview the room-service elves?
wake up – we don’t know yet.”
“Oh, stop it, Ron! The war is over, time to move on – it’s about time we get over house-prejudices!” Hermione exclaimed before turning to Harry, “I think it’s great that you and Draco are getting along so well.”
the Imagic glared at Harry – who had dared calling Flitwick by his name only. Snape nodded and left.
Harry thought, removing the letter. Hedwig had nuzzled his ear and hair whenever near enough, but this one turned his head as far away as possible from Harry.
Draco picked up his cup and, to Harry’s surprise, sat down on a comfortable arm-chair next to Harry’s sofa, not at his usual place across the room. And Draco was without a book this morning – he seemed to be in a talkative mood instead.
His eyes flew over the ancient handwriting. “You have to open it with a brush!” he exclaimed.
“Congrats, Cass,” Draco said, turning to his cousin, ”well, it was to be expected. You are much better off in any other house than Slytherin… as we are presently not at the height of our popularity I’m afraid. Plus Gryffindor sure can use some functioning brains besides Granger’s.”
Harry was suddenly reminded of Draco’s frequent blushes. Draco Malfoy’s face would turn pink whenever he was embarrassed… or upset… or just startled. More often than not Harry himself was the source of Draco’s discomfort, as he thoroughly enjoyed needling the arrogant bastard.
“But sureley not anymore! Now that we know about his involvement in the Imagic matter, he’s got no chance, right?” Harry asked.
He addressed the other girl directly, “Ariana, I’ve explained this before – we need to find your cup, it’s very, very important to get it back. If you don’t want to talk to me – which is totally okay – why don’t you tell Daisy and she will pass it on to me? How about that?”
Harry stopped too. Thinking about their early morning encounters he blushed and cleared his voice.
“I didn’t know you had your personal House-elf at Hogwarts!” said Tommy deeply impressed.
“Don’t those legal advisers know where he hides? He’s their client, they must have a way to contact him, if necessary! Can’t we get them to talk?” Ron asked.
Maybe his opponent was waiting downstairs, expecting Harry to enter at the backdoor as suggested in the letter? To prevent any intrusion, Harry cast another silent spell, blocking the door to the hall. And one more spell to seal it properly, just to be sure – that should do.
Finally the other House-elf also dared to raise her head. “Floppy never saw anything unusual at Master Professor Laddley’s room either.” She whispered. She looked very fragile, even for an elf, and one of her eyes was significantly larger than the other. “Master Professor Laddley was always very kind, when he saws us. Never was annoyed when we comes to clean.”
Harry protested, “We are
Harry wondered.
Harry just nodded and Tommy said, “It’s ok. I don’t think he’ll accept your offer anyway– he’s so full of hatred…”
“Shush, Mr Dumbledore! No talking! And don’t you dare address a Healer without proper respect, do you hear me?” She put her hands on her hips. “Or I might suppose you’re not just recovering from injuries but losing your marbles as well!” She looked quite annoyed.
“Will do, Mr Malfoy, will do,” said Harry sipping his tea.
She sighed deeply and caressed the cup with a hesitant finger. The moment her skin touched the bone china, something unexpected happened in the painting. While Bellatrix kept glaring, little Andromeda turned her face to Narcissa and kissed her sister on the cheek. Narcissa blushed twice, in the picture and right in front of Harry and Ginny, who had the embarrassing feeling of having watched a very intimate moment not meant to be observed.
“Talking about sex – is Josh Jordan as hot as he’s supposed to be?” Hermione asked.
“Now, what about you, dear? You’re alright? I hope your family is not giving you a hard time for being gay?”
They were in the first floor common room, sitting around the table. Josh had prepared tea for the three of them and Harry was grateful for the hot drink, although his sensitive skin protested painfully when he tried to wrap his fingers around the cup. And of course the tea was less perfect than the many cups Draco had prepared for Harry one floor upstairs.
–which had of course been true enough– but to be honest: his reasoning had been mostly pretext, a perfect excuse for staring at Draco, for watching his every move, for following him around hidden under his invisibility cloak… Fuck! He had more or less stalked Draco!
“I assume your lovely girlfriend had a slightly more diplomatic approach in mind,” Harry could not help grinning although the topic stung a little. Otto took off from his arm and flew three times around the kitchen lamp before taking a seat at the back of an empty chair.
“Don’t worry about that, Ms Malfoy,” Harry said, “I won’t gossip. I know all too well how dreadful it is, to be talked about behind one’s back.”
Fifteen minutes later Harry opened the door to the gym, dropped his robe and towel into one locker and headed for the pool. Yes, the water was his alone, just what he had hoped for on a Sunday night. He mounted his goggles and dived in.
Ron looked worried, “Don’t tell me Hermione’s in trouble for… you know?”
“Thank you for your time, Mr Potter” Gregory Laddley said. “I’ll try to keep it short. But before I start – please accept my sincere apology. I should never have done what I did. I deluded myself to justify my actions. What I’m about to share with you can never be an excuse for my crimes, I am fully aware of it.”
He cleared his voice and said, “Can we just talk about the missing Imagic instead? Please?”
“I’ve asked the House-elves to prepare tea for us later,” said McGonagall, “but before we indulge, I suggest we talk about the matter at hand.” She turned to face the wall at the back of the room, where three large oil-paintings hung side by side. The vacant space at the far left of the wall must be where the Wizard’s Wood was usually kept, Harry thought.
Laddley stared at her, he looked positively dumbfounded. Then he murmured something that might have been ‘Good evening’ and left.
As soon as they were within earshot Tommy shouted grinning widely, “Congrats! Well, well – I’m never going to hear the end of it, because this one –” he nodded towards his lover, “– has insisted for years that you two are an item in the making.”
“But Kreacher could ask the other House-elves who clean the rooms, if Master wants him to?”
“Where is Draco?” she shouted and even pushed him slightly, “what have you done to him?”
“Oh, Master Harry Potter Sir! Very dirty, the noble house was, so very very dirty! But now is clean! Kreacher scrubbed every room of course! Master’s fine house would be in much better state, if Kreacher were allowed to take care of Master’s household!” Kreacher stared accusingly at Harry.
The other eighth-years had all retreated to their bedrooms a while ago. The sizzle of the fire, Sir Cardogan’s snores and the soft ticking of the tall clock in one corner were the only noises to be heard.
Daisy smiled, “Oh no, I love to be in the forest at night! The Headmistress told me exactly how to behave anyway… and I have a friend to keep me safe.” She grinned and pointed up the tree behind her, which was so tall its top must be way above the frame. Up in the highest visible branch Harry could barely make out massive claws of a bird, hidden in the thick of twigs and leaves.
“Fine, that’s settled then. Well, it’s dinner time, isn’t it?” McGonagall started walking again but Harry stayed put.
“Some months of ghastly fights later her parents left Cassiopeia with us, they moved abroad for years. Draco was very happy that they were gone and so was I. Lucius was mostly glad, that the constant fighting had stopped, but he had always blamed his niece for it and now ignored her completely. I told myself Cass just needed some time and pretended the whole issue would simply disappear. Well, it did not.”
?” Ron said. “Well, as my lovely girlfriend says, now’s the time to leave all that behind and start acting like your average stupid young bloke – have fun, get pissed and get laid.”
“Bow down, Millie and Floppy, bow down!” Kreacher shouted shoving the other House-elves’ heads to the floor. “For this is Master Harry Potter who has saved us all! Master Harry Potter wants to talk to you although none of you deserves this! Master Harry Potter is the most–”
“You are quite lucky, you know,” Cass smiled at him and Harry mused again how very much alike she was to her cousin, “to be accepted no matter what. It’s not something to be taken for granted.”
“Well, Mr Weasley just found out whom I intend to hire as D.A.D.A. teacher replacing Auror Jordan – if the Board of School Governors permits it, that is,” the Headmistress explained.
!’ – if you want to look at it later, you’ll just have to use the spell backwards.”
“And indeed at dusk other guests appeared, about a dozen of them. Only wizards, none of our class-mates, some several years older than we were. And they all stared at Tim in a way that made my stomach churn. When I asked Lucius, why he had not invited any girls, he just laughed. Again I suggested we should leave, but Tim talked me out of it. He was fascinated by Lucius, eager to discover all of the Manor’s treasures – and completely oblivious to the attention he got.”
When the door closed behind him, Harry approached the painting above the fire place where a sweet looking girl in an old-fashioned dress sat contently on a comfortable chair.
“You know who I am?” Harry asked back. How could a Muggle he had never seen before be familiar with his name?
“But you might not love their filthy paws. They’ve just returned from a walk in the dirt… Frank – that’s my husband – it’s his turn to clean them.” Odie stopped at the foot of the staircase and shouted upstairs, “Frank!? Do you hear me? Don’t forget about the dogs!”
Again the investigators exchanged glances – Hermione had put Lucius Malfoy’s picture next to Gregory Laddley’s. Sylvia Silver seemed to be very observant and to have a good eye for faces, as she had spotted the likeness between father and son.
“They’ve waited for you to give their messages!” cried Hermione.
As soon as she had closed the door, Tavin said, “An impromptu Transfig’ test? Seriously? She’s the worst! I bet she won’t even do that tomorrow, she just enjoys winding us up! One hell of a Transfig’ teacher – she sure knows how to transfigure good mood into strained anticipation!”
33 chapters done, 11 more to go.
Tommy must have realized that Harry was watching him, as he too stopped at the railing.
“Well, if they must… I definitely have not abducted any obese female Imagic,” Draco smiled and planted another soft kiss on Harry’s temple, “on the other hand – if a nude painting of a certain superhero were amiss, I might well be a plausible suspect.” He gave Harry’s body a tight squeeze.
And there she was, sitting on a wraught iron chair between the mighty pillars of the front porch. As soon as she saw them walking towards the building she rose and approached them.
Polly jumped down to the forest floor, zigzagged between the trunks and disappeared.
Harry stared at the apparition. They had put all the known facts about the whole affair onto the board. There was a timeline, starting with the removal of the portraits from Hogwarts to the archives up to the present day, pictures of the missing Imagics and of the four suspects and so many remarks that Harry guessed, he needed an hour to read them all. He stepped closer to have a better look.
“Are you still feeling sick, Harry?” Hermione asked. “You should go see Madam Pomfrey about it.” Ron and Hermione exchanged worried glances.
When at half past eight Harry took his place at the breakfast table, neither he nor Draco Malfoy mentioned their early morning encounter. Same as everybody else at the table, they were deeply engrossed in their new time tables, which they had just received.
“Really, Harry, do you?” Molly looked unconvinced. “Remember what you said to me just minutes ago, how you felt you needed to defend yourself? That did not sound like trust to me.” She sighed.
to use your cloak?”
Ron slapped Harry’s shoulder. “Thanks for backing me up – that’s my mate! As Harry has been clueless too, I’m at least not the only door knob at this table! And if you all claim to be emotionally advanced, you’ll have to be more considerate with us door knobs and tell us what’s going on in plain English now and then.”
“But… what exactly
of all people,” said Laddley. His face had flushed to a dark purple.
Draco took a seat next to Harry but with a good two feet between them. They both watched birds flying in and out of the owlery in silence for a few moments. Harry’s heart beat excitedly but he kept quiet. Whatever Draco wanted to tell him, it seemed to be difficult for him to bring it up.
Snape looked grave. “Yes, indeed, Mr Potter.” He sighed. “Professor Tharros’ name has been cleared. Headmistress McGonagall and Headauror Shacklebolt conducted a most thorough interrogation yesterday evening and the present Head of Gryffindor House seems to be completely uninvolved in the abduction of Imagics.”
him again! And I don’t want to do that anymore… he seems to have made up his mind.”
Ginny cleared her voice.
“Over here, Potter,” Draco Malfoy said with a frown pointing at the place mat with Harry’s name on in – right opposite of his own. Harry realized with a sinking feeling, he was meant to sit facing Malfoy. Oh, what fun that would be.
“I suggest we take a break until the headmistresses return,” McGonagall said walking back to the other investigators and with one swift movement of her wand all of the coffee tables were set with tea and an assortment of snacks and sweets. “Help yourself, will you!”
“That’s a bit rich coming from you, pal,” Ron said with raised eyebrows, “as
“Good morning, Mr Dumbledore,” Harry shouted.
“Pinkie is chasing Sir Cardogan?” Harry raised his eyebrows. That should be a sight to behold!
“Thank you, Profes– sorry, Headmaster, for your support of Gryffindor! I wasn’t even aware that you were still stepping in for the Fat Lady – can’t some other Imagic take over? You are surely missed at the Headmistress’ office!” Harry felt guilty for Snape’s situation, as he had been the one to rope the Imagic into this.
“And how does she feel about you?” Hermione asked. “Did you talk about it?”
Draco nodded with a puzzled look.
“So you were right, Harry,” Hermione said eagerly, “this one is actually the Malfoys’ copy! Taurus must have studied C.O.M.A. in secret, because he wanted to present any findings as his very own inventions. And he could not examine the book at the Manor, considering the mess he was making by opening it the wrong way. Hence he went to the empty house at
What had the letter suggested? The back-door was supposedly unlocked and Harry was expected to climb upstairs right into Aberforth’s sitting room. Well, this he would not do. His only chance was to outsmart his opponent by finding another way inside, grabbing Draco and making a run for the safety of the castle.
For the rest of dinner time Harry had barely a minute to eat in peace. First of all Blaise and Tommy were alerted by Laddley’s presence at the staff table. They took Harry aside and wanted to know everything Harry could tell them about McGonagall’s arrangements – not that he knew much about it. Eventually both of them agreed to cooperate. To Harry’s surprise it was far more difficult to convince Blaise than Tommy, that Laddley deserved another chance.
“I did
Harry could not hold back any longer, he threw Otto up in the air and his arms around Cass. He held her close.
Draco had regained his spirits again and protested, “You are getting me in so much trouble, Potter!”
Early on Thursday morning Harry lay in bed after another restless night. He felt worn out and distressed. Was this nightmare ever going to end? He sighed deeply. Tea, he desperately needed some tea.
He added a few words to Aberforth’s note, stepped to the corridor outside of his room and pinned the letter to his door.
!” Harry murmured.
“In that case… how about me and Hermione stay in your room while you work out? She can give us the essentials when you come back… man, I just love your sofa, much more comfortable than ours… I mean, the one in my room,” Ron said.
– isn’t that rather your love-life’s motto?”
The poodle reminded Harry of another Imagic.
“Morning, Mr Potter,” said Draco standing in front of the Wizard’s Wood when Harry entered, “say hello to our new guest. Her name is Daisy, she’s a dedicated reader and we have already talked about our favourite books.”
“No, that’s actually a great idea, Andromeda – not awkward at all, quite the contrary!” Harry smiled at her while moving Otto from his left arm to his right – Otto had the habit of squeezing his claws rather tightly when he was excited and the sight of the baby-boy seemed to be very exciting indeed.
While August turned into September the weather was still remarkably fine and Harry was enjoying his prolonged summer-holiday. Otto was making good progress to become a reliable post-owl and finally able to find his way to school by his own. The owl was very proud to take on first jobs and especially fond of making deliveries to the Weasley’s home where Molly or – to the bird’s even greater delight – Hermione would treat him to fancy snacks such as flour worms or sweet beetles. Hermione had succeeded convincing her parents she was still trustworthy and was therefore able to stay at her boyfriend’s home more frequently.
Professor Tharros was a living breathing example for the fact, that occasionally first impressions could be as right as rain. She was brilliant, no doubt about that, but very strict and expecting a lot from her students. The loads of homework she was handing them freely made everybody moan and wish for having McGonagall back – until Hermione had to remind them, that Headmistress McGonagall had never been shy on dumping them in home-work either. Still, Harry missed McGonagall. She had not only been his teacher and head of house, but also an important ally in his fight against Voldemort. He trusted her opinion as much as he admired her character.
Harry held his breath and just when he seriously considered taking his own life with the fork in his hand, he was saved by a crying noise from the snug.
“Well, our parents ordered it, although at that time it was already pretty obvious she would never get married. And I kept the cup after her death, same as the portrait. It was a relief to have at least two keepsakes from her… it used to stand right here, on the mantelpiece of the fireplace. But it is gone. It went missing when the Death Eaters raided the inn. I searched for it in the ruins, believe me, I’ve searched for days. It is lost.”
The building was the size of a cottage, but with all the features of a villa – bay windows and even a tiny balcony. Its front was painted a soft pink hue and the roof shimmered of copper.
“May I suggest something, Professor?” Hermione said tentatively, “I could take the hexed painting to the library. Her Ladyship might be able to identify the artwork or at least the artist. She knows a great deal about Magical Arts.”
“You could at least ask nicely! What’s the magic word, Mr Weasley?” the Fat Lady glared at him.
Harry exhaled with relief.
“No. As my valet.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes of course, as a date… but if you prefer playing gooseberry with the Roniones, I’ll understand.”
Narcissa Malfoy stared at Harry as displeased as she had looked at her son seconds before.
“Thank you very much, Kreacher,” Harry smiled at the elf, “I hope everything is alright at Number Twelve?”
Harry thought.
Harry wondered. He closed the curtains carefully.
– Kreacher would never –
“Yeah, maybe I don’t. But… tell you what, life is not worth living without a challenge and –disregarding Tom Riddle– you’ve been the biggest challenge of my life so far.”
“Now that I have met Cassy, I finally understand the connection between you and Ginny – obviously you’ve got the same taste!” She winked at him. “Seriously, the two of you reminded me of a pair of schoolmates from my days at Hogwarts. They were very good friends and everybody agreed they made a nice couple, they even got married! But when they were in their mid-twenties they got a divorce and both of them came out.”
“He keeps a picture at his bedside locker,” Floppy said under her breath. “A picture that is not moving.”
“I’m afraid not,” Snape’s Imagic looked grave, “but I have asked Sir Cadogan to ask around and he reports to me every day, so we might still get lucky.”
Ron’s thoughts seemed to run in a similar direction.
Snape’s Imagic sighed again, ”Mr Potter, those are deep questions. Even ordinary magic has its secrets and the art of magical painting is anything but ordinary or simple.” The Imagic seemed to consider his words carefully as he went on, “Some secrets will never be unveiled. If I had to make an educated guess, I would say, any Imagic’s character represents the painter as well as the portrayed, as the artist decides which characteristics are transferred from human being to Imagic and which are abandoned. But be assured, if my former self had felt nothing but distain and hatred for you – I would not be able to behave as I do.”
“Good afternoon, Mr Potter. First of all, I want to explain, why I suggested asking for your help. It is no secret that Headmaster Dumbledore thought the world of you and used to spend some time with you alone, especially during the last year of his life,” Snape’s painting cleared his voice. “In the course of these occasions he might have shared something with you that could help us to solve this… puzzle. Maybe something personal about his past. Maybe something that just slipped from his tongue unintentionally. Maybe something that had seemed totally unimportant at that time.”
“What?” Harry shouted, “That’s a bit rich coming from you! If I remember correctly, you of all people were quite into those ‘
“Yeah, the ball,” Hermione sighed, “I can’t believe they did not cancel the ball after what happened last Saturday. I think this is a tremendous security risk.”
“When will you see her again?” Hermione asked.
Should he still go to the common room this morning to have tea as usual? And would Draco be there? Only one way to find out, Harry thought and grabbed for his sweatpants.
Suddenly Harry remembered a D.A.D.A. lesson from a few weeks ago. Josh had taught them a spell for uncovering hidden threats before entering a place. But would he be able to apply it wordlessly? He pressed his lips close to the keyhole and mouthed the spell without a sound. A faint tickling and a distinct decrease of temperature in his wand was the result. That was good, right? In case of hidden dangers his wand was supposed to heat up instead – so Harry should be safe to enter.
Harry’s sense of reality kicked in. “We can’t.”
“Me neither. Did I tell you, that Tonks literally saved my life two years ago, when we were trapped by some Death Eaters? I miss her a lot, Tonks, you know. She was one of my best friends.” Josh’s voice was hoarse. “That witch made me laugh like no one else. She even asked me to be her ‘
“So, what are your plans for today, boys?” Odie asked. “Harry, you have to know, that Frankie and I are going to Glasgow for the weekend, to attend my niece’s wedding. Before you turned up, the idea was that David would stay at home and watch the girls for us – can’t bring along two naughty dogs to a wedding, can you?”
Harry was perplexed, “You mean to tell me, Taurus Malfoy himself did it?”
Harry silently cursed himself. Why had he come here all alone? He would be so much better off with a backup now! But waiting for help from the castle was not an option. Flying back would take far too long. Sending his Patronus was also out of the question, as his stag was bright and shining. If anybody – be it Taurus or Aberforth – was watching the yard, the silvery stag would immediately give away Harry’s presence.
Hermione giggled.
“She’s right, Mr Potter,” Flitwick said, “give the girls some privacy. It’s never helpful to be watched when creating art.” He patted the chair next to him in front of the fireplace. “Come on, have a drink with me! Butterbeer or pumpkin juice – which one is it?”
“Oh Ron, come off! Otto is an innocent darling, everyone can see that.” Hermione was smitten by the young owl and the affection seemed to be mutual, as Otto had hardly left her arm all evening. “The Malfoys cannot hex him as they are not even allowed to do magic. As long as Harry trains Otto himself, I think he will be perfectly safe.”
“I’ll be fine without it, it’s still dark enough outside and–“
and gasped. “It’s awfully late! We really need to hurry, if we still want to have some breakfast before our first lesson today! Which is D.A.D.A, Ron! Good bye, Professor, good bye Ms Silver – I hope your request will be granted!” And she shoved both Harry and Ron towards the door.
“What makes you think he will be dismissed?” Kingsley Shacklebolt raised his eye-brows. “I most certainly won’t get rid of one of my best young Aurors because he did something behind my back – which, by the way, I would have permitted him to do, if asked.”
“Master Draco Malfoy also keeps Master Harry Potter’s picture at his bedside –“
“Wow, that’s… – I’m really glad too.” Cass beamed at him. She looked so cute, Harry suddenly remembered Ginny saying, Malfoy was actually quite handsome. Maybe if that git didn’t frown all the time…
Harry wondered.
“What does McGonagall want, Harry?” Hermione looked concerned, “You can’t be in trouble? I mean, not this year again?”
“How about close friends starving?” Ron asked innocently.
Harry thought, surprised by his own awareness.
“Where’s Draco?” she asked.
“Ok, so she’s back… shall I go to her office?”
“No, thank Merlin, they don’t!” Draco said under his breath and dropped the cloak. He stepped down from an old school-broom and started waving his wand while murmuring incantations.
Harry felt the eyes of all his friends on him and was touched by their curiosity. Well, he could do nothing about it. They would simply have to stay tuned.
“Yeah, I guess so… but then what? She can come back anytime and resume insulting me,” Harry said.
Harry was only a little bit embarrassed. The kitchen was cosy, it smelled fantastic and he was very hungry indeed. “Thank you,” he said.
Draco shrugged with a crooked smile. “Can’t be careful enough. I’m up against an army of devoted fans, have to mark my territory.”
“Must have been in August… I don’t know the exact date. It was a Monday, I remember that much,” said Harry. “You see, it didn’t seem to be such a big deal at that time. And with an Auror present I thought it must be ok… I’m sure Mrs Malfoy isn’t even aware, that the hexed painting is illegal! She never asked me to keep quiet about what she did and she told Josh- ah, Professor Jordan in advance, did it right under his nose! She would never have done that, if she had been afraid of getting Draco or herself into trouble, don’t you think?”
“Where is he anyway?” Harry blurted unable to hold back his curiosity any longer.
“How do you know this is our table?” Ron looked perplexed.
“Draco, is it now?” Ron raised his eye-brows in mock horror, “well, well, things have come to a pretty pass.”
and I’ve no intentions of cheating on you. Not tonight and not any other day either. Merlin, you’re dating a Gryffindor! You better learn to trust me.”
he regains consciousness at all,” Flitwick added gravely, “don’t forget his condition is very serious, he might even die.”
Gregory Laddley looked rather unremarkable, Harry thought. Middle aged guy, sandy hair, friendly face – and rather broad shoulders.
“But I assume –as your family is pure-blood– your parents commissioned a Filius Stick of him?”
Harry, Ron and Hermione had of course missed last year completely as had many other students, such as Muggle-borns or kids from families who resisted Voldemort’s regime. Last year had been all about improving survival skills for them – which were very important skills indeed, but not enough in terms of a proper magical education.
“Hi Harry,” she sat at her usual place with a book in her hands and beamed at him, “yes, your friend Neville told me. What do you want me to do? Shall I try to find the Fat Lady?”
“We’ve got half an hour left – so it’s question time! Does anyone have problems with other defence spells? Now would be the time to ask and to practice some more.”
Only when she gestured at a chair next to the sofa, Harry saw that her fingers were trembling.
He made it sound like a joke but still Harry’s heart cringed. It must have been hard for Tommy.
“But in that case Sirius himself would have been able to take the horrible thing down!” Ron said.
“Look, I’m sorry,” she ran her fingers through her hair, just like Draco did when he was embarrassed, “I’m sorry I lost it. So you fancy him too?” She smiled when Harry nodded.  “Well, I so much hoped you might… one day. He’s been sweet on you for ages. I’m just worried about him… he’s not doing well lately…”
Thanks to one of Hermione’s long-lasting warming charms, Harry was quite comfortable in spite of the cold night air. Just like he had expected they headed in the direction of Edinburgh for most of the flight, but in the end Otto had led them into the small town of Bonnyrigg, about eight miles south-east of the city centre.
Harry removed his steamy goggles and stared at the other guy. “What is it? What’s happened?”
“Kreacher wants to air all the rooms properly, dust off the furniture and have a good look around to make sure everything is the way as it should be for Master Harry Potter Sir,” the House-elf declared with great importance.
“Hi Harry,” Josh said keeping his focus on a sizzling pan, which was all for the better as Harry had flushed violently.
Harry was strangely relieved by Snape’s rebuke. Being in love with Draco Malfoy was one thing, but being also close friends with Severus Snape was stretching it a bit too far.
“I’ve talked to the Headmistress already,” Harry interrupted, “and –sorry Hermione– I’ve got no time for homework this afternoon, I need to check something in the village.”
The former Headmistresses and the Fat Lady had all risen from their chairs and were shouting at the same time. “What in the name of Merlin has happened? I’m dizzy…” – “Where are we? This feels very weird indeed!” – “Don’t tell me I’ve missed my dinner!”
“This is not about security, it’s about teaching your lot some manners!” shouted the Imagic before closing with a thud.
Harry wondered.
Harry felt stunned. Of course McGonagall had said she wanted to find professional help for Laddley… but why in Merlin’s name did she have to hire the very same Mental Healer Harry had been seeing?
“Your wand? What about it? It’s right here, in the drawer of your bed-side table, perfectly intact.” Hermione opened the drawer for him.
The door of the house opposite of the road opened and Harry turned around. An elderly lady let her cat inside again – the same ginger cat that had hurried outside just minutes ago. Before she closed the door, the woman scanned the area briefly. It was probably a good thing Harry had put on his invisibility cloak, otherwise she might find it a bit odd that he was still standing in front of her neighbour’s house, rooted to the spot.
“Oh, this is lovely,” she exclaimed, “looks like a doll’s house!”
“I’ll be totally supportive, Harry!” Cass went on, “I have to admit I was a bit surprised your friends didn’t know?”
Hermione turned towards Harry, “What did you recommend some weeks ago concerning bickering siblings? It is unwise to interfere?”
Harry was taken aback. “Look – I didn’t want to offend you! Aberforth is a friend of mine, I just wanted to make sure he’s alright, ok?”
Ron and Harry both paled a little before Ron said, “Don’t be daft Hermione. Everyone knows Josh is playing for the other team. Well, everybody but Pansy Parkinson. You remember that day she saw a picture of Josh in the Prophet and declared, Josh to be the only Hufflepuff, she would consider dating, if he asked her out? That girl is beyond ignorant.”
“I want you all to practice
“But to reassure you – it wasn’t too much of a sacrifice for him to spend his holidays at Edinburgh. Aunt Mella is really cool – much more relaxed than his parents – and since we were old enough to go out, Draco especially loved to spend August in Edinburgh. This year, with him being confined to the house and me preparing for O.W.L.s, it was different of course. But previous summers… we didn’t study all the time… we explored the Muggle Fringe Festival, went to bars and raves, it was wild. I could tell you stories about Draco that would really surprise you… but as you don’t do gossip…”
“Well, well. I should not have lost my temper, but at least you’ve got a taste of what your darling – ” Taurus Malfoy nodded towards the only remaining Draco, “ – will have to endure, if you do not cooperate.”
“Well, I’m not cooing and I insist I’m most certainly more of a man than my baby-owl,” Harry said in mock hurt making Ron and Hermione laugh.
The morning went by in a blur. Harry was so sleep deprived after several nights of worrying that he found it increasingly hard to be attantive during lessons. Stepping into the great hall for lunch, he felt rather nervous. Would Narcissa Malfoy already be there? Would she sit with the teachers like visitors usually did? He found his place and stared at the staff table.
Laddley seemed to be amused by her praise. “I am very glad to hear you enjoy my lessons, Ms Whiteside, but as Mr Potter grew up with his Muggle relatives he surely would be very bored at my class.”
With narrowed eyes McGonagall said, “Out with it, Harry! Whatever it is, even if you are not quite sure whether it is relevant or not, let us hear it! You do trust us, I hope?”
Taurus Malfoy! If he had captured Draco right here, at the pub, making use of the sitting room, what the hell had happened to Aberforth? Taurus Malfoy must have overpowered the pub owner who was now probably incapacitated – or maybe even dead? But Arthur had seen Aberforth only this afternoon – so it all must have happened this very evening!
“Harry, I’ve just got an owl from the Burrow – Mum and Dad are totally ok with me dating Cassy,” Ginny beamed, “they’re glad I told them and Mum writes
“Why do they look so pleased although they are locked up?”
“Watch out, you two,” Ron grinned at them, ”or you might end up becoming as scary as Tharros herself.”
Harry held his breath expecting Draco to explode again, but the guy just snorted. He seemed to take Ron’s remark much better than Harry’s.
After the swimming lesson, Blaise, Tommy, Harry and Josh stayed to swim laps. Josh was an excellent swimmer as well and their training quickly became competitive. It was a lot of fun – Josh behaved just like any other guy and not like a teacher at all. Harry was proud of himself for keeping his cool about Josh's presence.
Harry bit his lips to refrain from grinning broadly and his pulse quickened at the prospect of a weekend in undisturbed togetherness.
Harry thought.
“Oh, but the cards must be magical! Look at number twenty-one! Every evening the moon on the card is exactly as full as the real moon outside!” Luna exclaimed.
Suddenly Harry had a lump in his throat. “I know.” He gulped. “It’s just… I promised… I can’t talk about it… it’s not
“Harry, good to see you,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in his deep voice, “although I would have preferred to meet again for a less disturbing reason.”
Harry stepped closer to the painting. At the moment no Imagic was to be seen in the forest, just falling leaves slowly gliding through the air. But he was well aware from now on any Imagic of the castle had access to their common room around the clock. If someone popped by in the early morning, they would find himself and Draco having their morning tea – well, together. This possibility made Harry slightly uneasy. Apart from that Harry was sure, Flitwick must have had a specific reason for putting the painting there, probably something to do with the missing Imagic.
“Showing her a selection of pictures, including our suspects – maybe she can identify them!”
Harry groaned, “Oh shut the fuck up!”
“Oh, please, Hermione, please!” Ron begged.
“What a nice common room you’ve got… and the view is even better from up here!” O’Malley stepped closer to a window.
“Of course, Harry, I understand,” she smiled, “looking forward to seeing you and Draco in the morning as usual!” She waved, kicked her heels in the birds back and Pinkie took off the ground with a piercing shriek. Obviously she didn’t read too much into Draco missing their morning routine twice – maybe Harry shouldn’t either…
“Last night was very exciting… for Daisy,” Draco said in a low voice, “she talked about it all morning – I’ve… she’s been waiting for you.”
“Oh… me too.” said Harry. “Morning person, that is. Well, you will have to share the common room or fuck off to your own bedroom, if you don’t want to see me.”
“You have no idea how this works apparently!
“Cass did! We were ever so glad to see Dumbledore’s Imagic again! Then the others joined us for a quick celebration. Mrs Malfoy had the House-elves prepare some snacks and she even opened a bottle of Charmspagne for the occasion.”
' in reply.
Suddenly Draco raised his eyes and looked at Harry, who wanted to draw his eyes away – but was unable to do so until Draco dropped his gaze and started to fill his plate for once. Harry exhaled. At least Draco’s appetite seemed improved lately.
To Harry’s utter amazement, McGonagall turned to Snape’s portrait and said, ”Severus, as you’ve been the one most insistent to consult with Harry, you might as well start the roundup about what has happened.”
“Kreacher never saw young Master Draco Malfoy at the noble House of… House of Master Harry Potter Sir!”
When he finally joined his classmates again, their Potions lesson was nearly over. Professor Slughorn did not seem to mind, he even offered to tutor Harry in case he had questions about today’s homework. The rest of the afternoon Harry spent at the pool, first instructing younger students and later on swimming laps next to Blaise and Tommy, until it was time to get dressed for dinner. Not that he was particularily hungry.
“Still – don’t you think it’s a bit harsh to sack him for overstepping the line just once?”
Looking at Bellevue Beach Harry was pleased to see Headmistresses Da Ponte and Darknight strolling along the waterside. Apparently the abduction had not spoiled their favourite painting for them. He found the sight of two elderly ladies walking hand in hand rather touching. On the far end of the beach he spotted Daisy. She threw a stick in the air which Pinkie retrieved above the waves.
is a major understatement,” Draco said dryly and Harry’s grin was as big as it gets.
Harry did not even want to contemplate, why he was supposed to be listed in Narcissa Malfoy’s bloody good book – he just cleared his voice and said, “Apology accepted, Malfoy… ah, Draco. And no need to get soppy about my testimony, I just told the truth and that’s that.” He shot Narcissa Malfoy a rebellious look and crossed his arms.
Harry was lost for words. The whole story was too horrible to be true – but at the same time totally believable. He hated Lucius Malfoy with all his heart, more than ever. What Laddley had done was wrong, of course it was, but Harry understood. He did not want to ponder what he himself would be ready to do, if a loved one was abused and hurt like that.
“No, I am not. But still… she had to pay the price for her choices anyway. And I am not talking about Lucius being imprisoned,” she hesitated for a moment before going on, “Considering Lucius’ feelings for women this was under no circumstances ever going to be a happy marriage.”
“There you are!” Ron slapped Harry’s back. “We were starting to get worried. Where have you been after Kingsley’s announcement?”
Blaise grumbled but followed the young teacher out of the room. So did most of the students.
“Yes, it is.” Hermione said proudly, “but this one comes with instructions how to handle it!” She pulled out a sheet of parchment stuck beneath the strings and handed it to Harry.
(WHO CARES!)
"He's rather serious... that’s quite disturbing in itself, come to think of it. Never expected one day I would actually miss being teased and mucked about. He’s busy with the shop, mind you, now he has to get it all done by himself. That’s probably why he hasn’t been visiting you lately… give him a fire-call, will you? I think it would do him good to meet that one, a kindred spirit of sorts,” Ron said pointing at Otto.
“Hi Harry, didn’t know you come here on Sunday evenings as well,” said Tommy, “have been all on my own before. I’m Tommy by the way, Tommy Hillborogh.” He didn’t seem to be out of breath although he had taken the last two laps really fast.
McGonagall sat down as well. “Spare me your house prejudices!” she snorted. “I am longing to get rid of this ridiculous structure once and for all! Actually I’m close to filing a request to our esteemed board of governors to dissolve the four houses!”
“I expect you to be open-minded and willing to learn, Professor,” McGonagall interrupted. “Sometimes teachers need to learn a thing or two as well, you know. Let me sum up the options you have: You can hand in your resignation and be assured, I will accept it immediately. That would be the easiest solution for all of us, but I doubt it to be the best one. I don’t like any person –teacher or student alike– to leave Hogwarts with the kind of mind-set you seem to have at the moment. The crucial question remains, are you willing to change, Professor Laddley?” She looked at him expectantly.
Harry secured the letter to Otto’s leg and the owl sailed gracefully through the open window hooting softly. Harry’s eyes followed Otto as long as he could see the owl’s white feathers in the darkness. Then he sighed and closed the window. This day had been intense.
For some reason he preferred this place to sitting with Ron and Hermione up front. Of course this had nothing to do with Draco’s seat right in front of him. Although Harry had to admit that he spent a good time of each lesson studying a certain elegant neckline and shining blond hair instead of paying attention.
“Merlin, you are… vile!” he rasped.
Harry gave the C.O.M.A. volume to Flitwick and told the Headmistress about his message to Snape. Both McGonagall and Flitwick approved of this move. Snape’s Imagic turned up shortly afterwards and –just as Harry had expected– he insisted on stepping in for the Fat Lady.
Hermine blushed for being praised and nodded.
Draco must have seen Harry’s attempts in the beginner’s corner of the ballroom, getting first instructions from Flitwick. He blew at his tea and Harry could see the tiniest bit of a pink tongue tipping the rim of Draco’s cup. Which was totally distracting.
“That is not a very nice thing to say, Potter. But I can see your point. I most certainly did what I could to keep nosy guests at bay.”
“Draco? Oh – he hasn’t returned yet… but Kingsley is confident they’ll find him eventually. Or maybe he’ll come back on his own account, if he reads the Prophet – by catching Taurus Malfoy you made the front page of course.” Hermione said. “Anyway – Draco’s no longer in danger and that’s the main thing.”
Then he was gone.
Harry was amazed – and relieved that she did not expect him to accept that monster of an owl, who had invaded his kitchen a few days ago.
“Yeah, now you’re shocked, aren’t you? I’ve had casual sex with a number of guys. I wish I hadn’t. I wish I had never tried to live like my father but I did… at least for a while.”
Blaise chuckled and whispered, “Have mercy, Malfoy, he can’t help it, poor sod…”
“Twenty-six months exactly,” Josh specified, “Tonks and I were partners for a little over two years – and it was so much fun to work with her, the best partner I ever had. I learned a lot.”
Harry realized that by focusing on the latest findings about the painting he had totally forgotten about Laddley’s condition.
Draco stared at him. “Meaning what?”
When Harry approached the common room he found the door slightly ajar and heard voices coming from the room. He stopped in his tracks – obviously some other student was up already as well. Maybe Draco had left the door open to give him notice? He stepped closer, yes, that was Blaise Zabini’s voice… Harry was still undecided whether to enter or to walk away, when suddenly he heard his own name.
“Wow, that’s… that’s a rather intimate question…,” Cass stuttered, “… it’s impossible to choose just one… I would have to name at least a dozen or so…”
Mere minutes later Harry was bound to the very same chair as Draco –
The only person who was even more devastated than Harry was Cass. She was paler than usual and her puffy eyes were a clear sign that she must be crying a lot. Harry tried to talk to her whenever he could, not just for her sake but because he felt closer to Draco when Cass was around. Just looking at her comforted him. Right after the ball she had been angry at Harry, believing him to be indifferent. But Harry convinced her that he did care very much indeed and would go to great length to clear Draco’s name. Ginny’s insistence that Harry was trustworthy had helped too, so Cass came around to have faith in him again.
Harry groaned silently. He was determined to do something, anything to continue this investigation. They needed to find Taurus Malfoy or Draco’s safety was at stake!
Ron interrupted, “Wait a minute – why don’t we do this the Muggle way?”
He shook his head and sighed, “No, I didn’t. In fact it’s the other way round… he rebuffed me for ridiculous reasons.”
Pondering the consequences of having a brainy partner Harry’s mind wandered to Draco of course. How was Draco coping in hiding? What did he do all day long? Was he bored? And most importantly – did he miss Harry?
– could it be true, that Draco Malfoy
“What?!” Harry choked. “Headmaster? Me? You’re joking, right?”
“For once I agree with your cousin. Reluctantly.” Hermione gave Draco a stern look, “He has a point. With such grades you will need no coaching at all.”
Laddley stared at Tommy. “Are you making fun of me, kid? Or are you really that dumb? Well, I can certainly spell it out, if you need me to! I want no fucking poofter in my pool! Have you got it? Or do I have to shove this information up your freaking arse?”
“Ok, I’m listening. And I even might have to add something to the board later on,” he said, “I’ve just found out something about Laddley.”
Only when Luna said, “Oh this is wonderful, I’ll grow a beard for that occasion, I’ve always loved facial hair…” and Dean squinched up his face in uttermost terror, Harry finally started to laugh wholeheartedly, as did all of his friends.
So far he had been able to push those feelings aside. Mostly. With the exception of some heated phantasies under the shower. But that was private, right? Draco just was a very handsome bastard, perfectly normal for a gay teenager to be turned on by his looks. Didn’t mean a thing. Certainly no reason to actually fall for someone.
“But Mr Weasley still has a point,” Madame Pomfrey said, approaching Harry’s bed again. “Time’s up!”
Harry suddenly realized all his swimmers were gathered at the railing close to where he and Draco were having their shouting match. They were actually gawping at Harry and Draco, which irritated Harry quite a bit.
“Oh, he’s an absolute darling!” Josh winked at Teddy who seemed to enjoy the attention and raised his arms towards Josh, obviously wanting to be picked up. Harry felt a sudden pang of jealousy, when Josh lifted the baby in his arms and cuddled him with affection.
Of course he had already told Hermione and Ron about Josh’s findings, but thought it best to fake surprise, because he did not want Josh to be in even more trouble for having told Harry first.
he thought.
Josh wove his wand to make the frying pan glide to the table as well and took the chair across from Harry. He pointed to the other dishes and explained, “This is cornbread and that’s red salsa, a sauce to go with it. It’s rather hot, so you might try with care. And some salad of course.”
“I’ll stay here with Teddy,” Andromeda said, “call me if you need me.”
“Well, he really is a prick, isn’t he? Still, what he did for Cass… oh, bugger, let’s go home, Otto – I want to enjoy some more Malfoy-free days before school starts and I have to see that git every day again.”
“I’ll keep that in mind, Professor!” Harry said. During the investigation he had seen Professor Flitwick far more often out of class than in previous years.
And so they did. Andromeda stepped out of Harry’s downstairs fireplace at noon with an excited Teddy in her arms. She praised Harry’s spaghetti sauce and after lunch took a good look around the basement of the old house, which she had last seen as a girl. They did not walk up to the entrance hall, to avoid giving Teddy a start by the shrieking portrait of his hostile great-aunt. Finally they settled down in Harry’s favourite sitting room next to the kitchen, Andromeda and Harry sharing the sofa while Teddy and Otto occupied the old rug in front of the fireplace.
“Well, nearly losing my best friend, because the idiot decided to act the lonesome hero – it kind of changed my perspective.” Ron said earnestly.
Harry grinned back. He suspected she was glad to get rid of him. His many visitors had been quite a disturbance to the tranquillity of her ward.
“Right you are, Headmistress Longbottom,” Phineas Nigellus Black said with a snort, “Severus the fool can’t resist playing the hero.”
“Too much information – stop it, you two!” Harry protested.
Facing the painting Draco waved his hand in Harry’s direction saying, “Dear Daisy, may I present to you the famous Mr Harry Potter. He’s a superhero but surprisingly enough still quite a decent bloke, as I only found out recently.” Draco smiled at Harry.
“Sorry,” O’Malley added, “that’s about all I know, I’m afraid… I’m not even sure why they want to interview me at St. Mungo’s, but I’m afraid I have to leave right away, the Headauror was very outspoken about it.” He sighed and with a final nod he opened the door and left.
Josh passed a glance with Laddley. “Well… just so you know. Mr Laddley has asked to talk to you, that’s the sole reason for his transfer to Hogwarts.”
” he shouted – a magnificent silvery shape sprang from the tip of his wand.
“Oh, that’ll be great fun, watching you two trying to be polite to each other,” Cass seemed to enjoy their mutual discomfort immensely and Harry could not help but feeling a bit of a dumb-ass himself.
What was that supposed to mean? How should he know what to do
Crossing his arms in front of his chest Harry raised his voice, “Well, you might think this is none of our business, but there’s an official enquiry going on. You make it sound as if we were just two nosy school-boys! But McGonagall agreed on asking you and – franky, I thought you might prefer to tell us, before the Auror Department decides to interrogate officially.”
“Stop laughing, Harry,” said Draco, “you don’t want to encourage them! They can go on like that for ages – I’ve come to suspect they’re actually stand-up comedians in disguise. And excellent at procrastinating. They’ll be late and all in a hurry – and then they’ll blame us.”
Flitwick improved her protection, made some changes to the raptor which is guarding her… and now they have to stay at the seaside for some reason. That is why Polly has to play messenger once again.”
The common room was quiet except for Laddley’s sobs. Josh had listened in total silence. He looked concerned but not at all shocked.
Mrs Malfoy nodded at Harry.
Just when a sweet-smelling apple pie appeared at their table for pudding, Josh Jordan entered the hall. No longer wearing teachers’ robes but dressed in brown again, the young Auror headed right for their table. Harry had a distinct feeling he knew what was coming.
“I’m sure it does, Professor,” Harry responded. He felt inclined to smile encouragingly at Laddley. If Laddley was able to see the light of reason, Harry was willing to reassess his opinion of him. Especially today, with his heart full of joy.
As usual Harry’s place was next to Neville and right behind Draco. He looked at the back of Draco’s head and was unable to move.
“What’s your name?” he asked the little boy, trying very hard not to smile.
This announcement drew an outcry of approval and much applause from the students.
The trap was to be set right before Harry’s and Blaise’s next special training lesson, which was scheduled for late Wednesday afternoon. Therefore Harry was a bit distracted at the beginning of Wednesday’s last lesson which happened to be Charms. He took his usual seat at the back of the class next to Neville.
“I think we have to reconsider the safekeeping of late Headmaster Dumbledore’s wand,” said Minerva McGonagall who listened in to the interview.
“Well, there’s always Otto,” Draco said carefully. “He’s a Malfoy’s Owl. They are famous for secret messaging. If we take some precautions, nobody will be able to follow him.” Otto hooted excitedly – he clearly understood that his name had been mentioned. Draco gave Harry a questioning look.
Draco fumbled with the invisibility cloak.
“Back to Laddley. What did he do? Come on, tell me!” Harry insisted.
Cass and Draco stored their trunks away and sat down. Harry’s friends stared at the newcomers, as if they didn’t believe what they were seeing until Ginny blurted, “Wow, you two really could be identical twins! Harry told us you look alike – but I didn’t expect… this is… wow.”
Harry laughed and called Kreacher.
Harry sighed. Yes, he had guessed correctly. “Listen, Molly, I know you mean well but Draco is a much better person than we all believed him to be! Ron and Hermione think so as well and – “
Draco stepped back, “Wait a minute! You mean to tell me I’ve been hiding without cause? All these precautions not to be caught – and the Aurors are not even searching for me but for someone else?” He looked delighted.
“I’d like to go with them,” said Dean, “if that’s ok?”
As soon as they were safely out of the hall, Harry quickened their pace, turned a corner and pulled Draco into the nearest alcove.
“But how do we do that without going through Laddley’s stuff? I was so hoping to find a bottle of Draco-shaping Polyjuice hidden somewhere in his room – that would have been all the proof we need.”
They climbed through and Hermione chuckled. “
After seemingly endless consideration he decided to check every window facing the yard. Beginning with the ground-floor windows Harry moved slowly and with uttermost care alongside the wall on the ground. All of those windows were closely shut. If he remembered correctly, they belonged to the pub’s kitchen and storage room. It was a bit weird that it was dark behind the shutters. Come to think of it, there was no noise to be heard from the pub at all? Maybe the pub was closed on Thursday nights?
“Your parents were good people too! Everybody says so!” Ron said with feeling.
“Welcome!” Headmistress McGonagall boomed to the hall at large and Harry was as amazed as ever about that fog horn of a voice coming from such a fragile looking old lady. “As all of you have finally found your place –“ she shot Neville a stern look, “– you might be well aware that we, the staff of Hogwarts, have made some changes to the school. We like to think of them as improvements. The war that lies behind us, the deaths of so many brave witches and wizards, made us reconsider our traditions. We have questioned each and every one of them. Do these traditions still serve us? Thus we have asked ourselves. Or does a certain habit fuel conflict and hatred?
They all laughed and Harry had to admit, Draco’s tone was less vicious and more joking than before.
“Harry!”
He seemed very satisfied by Harry’s shock. “Do you finally realize what you are up against, Potter? This is not some school-boy’s prank! This is me, a powerful dark wizard, who’s already in possession of two Deathly Hollows and who will go to any lengths to obtain the Elder Wand as well. Do you really want to test my determination?”
Josh nodded. “I’ll see what I can do. Of course I’ll have to ask for permission at the Ministry but I guess you might be able to return early, maybe tomorrow if not today. And I have to check in with Mrs Malfoy before we can leave.”
“Lucius was there, but neither his parents nor his brother. He excused their absence with urgent family business but it seemed odd. The first of many signs, that this invitation was not what it was supposed to be. Lucius was in exceedingly good spirits, he joked and laughed while showing us around. And he was especially nice to Tim, complimented him on his looks, asked him lots of questions about Muggle Arts – and Tim was simply enraptured. For the first time it dawned on me, that Lucius might be homosexual. His sexual desires had never concerned me before, nobody talked about it at school, at least not in front of me. I had been totally ignorant, but now I was alarmed.
“Whatever,” Ginny said, “if you’re so concerned, you’ll just have to come with us instead of going to the village, Draco!”
“It’s mostly pure-blood families and big institutions who commission paintings and collect. The Malfoy collection of fine Magical Arts is one of the most famous in England, other families worth to be mentioned are the Bulstrodes, the Selwyns and the Shafiqs – these four are the only families that still collect big scale. Or at least, they did before the war. The Malfoy fortune is frozen until Draco’s probation is over and I guess it’s the same for other pure-blood families. The fifth relevant private collection used to belong to the Ollivander family. But their paintings were rendered to the Ministry by Garrick Ollivander’s father, as his only son’s single talent and interest has always been wandlore. Since then the former Ollivander collection is stored at the Ministry archives, which happen to hold the greatest number of magical artefacts in the world.”
Harry stared at her. Did she ask him out? How was he supposed to react? He certainly did not intend to go with an eleven year old girl!
Harry laughed at his friends. “Don’t worry! I’ve figured it out by now that you’re living together. I won’t tell anyone of course, your secret is safe with me.” He grinned at them reassuringly and they started walking again.
“Do you now?” He laughed before adding in a fake Scottish accent, “Took you long enough, lad!” He pulled dark glasses out of his pocket and grinned at Harry.
Harry stared at the man. He knew that icy gaze from the incident board well enough.
Kissing Draco was far more exciting than any kiss Harry had ever shared before. Their tongues met – jolting a wave of arousal through Harry’s body. This was different, this was new, this was what he wanted. Harry groaned without moving away from Draco’s mouth.
Harry slapped Ron’s shoulder harder but laughed. He was awfully glad that Ron was joking again. They resumed walking quietly for a few minutes. It was a fine morning. Harry enjoyed the fresh autumn air, the sprinkle of frost on the trees which gradually melted as the sun came out. When the path took a turn they could finally see the village. Hogsmeade was the picture of an old-fashioned hamlet, with its weather-beaten stone houses and smoke drifting from their chimneys straight up in the air.
“Exactly,” Harry nodded, “that’s where you’ll be heading to. And you need not fear detention, Hermione, this is an official invitation from the Headmistress. As Madame Pomfrey still believes me to be unfit for Apparation, I’ve been asked to name someone to step in for me – and I took the liberty of giving them three names. McGonagall agreed. It’s going to be quite a large search party anyway, McGonagall, Flitwick, Shacklebolt, Josh and Narcissa.”
“But he didn’t do it! Even when he had the chance, at the top of the tower, he just couldn’t – and that’s what makes all the difference!” Harry shouted. “He never wanted to actually kill Dumbledore in the first place!”
“C’mon Dray, let’s go – clearly we are not wanted!” Cass laughed and darted off into the grounds. Draco shrugged, stuffed his hands into his trouser pockets and followed his cousin in a more subdued pace, not without glaring at Harry one last time before he turned around and was gone.
“I had to gain most of my magical education from books up until now…” Cass shrugged. “Plus I’ve always loved books.”
Harry wondered,
Just in time Harry had remembered to inform Josh. He had excused himself under the pretext of having to call at school and got out of the house. The back garden was secluded enough for Harry to conjure his Patronus unspotted, thus preventing three guys in weird clothes from disturbing this perfectly respectable Muggle neighbourhood.
Finally Harry went to the Guest House’s common room after dinner. He had rarely been there in the evenings, as the novelty of having his own private room had been more tempting than any want for company. Like most nights before, Ron and Hermione retreated to their respective rooms at exactly the same time. Harry strongly suspected, Hermione had done something to the wall between their door-to-door rooms. Most probably she had managed to create a cosy two-room-apartment for the two of them. It must be nice to have some privacy with one’s lover, Harry thought.
This chapter is dedicated to all the fabulous and notoriously good-humoured librarians presently in quarantine, probably cataloguing their personal books at home.
Therefore most of Malfoy’s usual crowd would be gone, and being on probation would not increase his popularity either. If his cousin was hanging out with ‘Potter’s gang’, as Harry was well aware his circle of friends was labelled, Draco was prone to be rather lonely this year. Harry realized this thought didn’t please him half as much as he would have expected.
“Right,” Harry cleared his voice. Cass’ distress had shaken his confidence but he needed to keep acting as if he were more interested in the investigation than in Draco’s safety. “What exactly has happened to incriminate Draco further?”
They reached the eighth-year’s table and all conversation stopped abruptly. Harry had the distinct feeling, he knew what his table mates had been talking about, but still felt less awkward about it than he had expected to.
“Wow, guys and girls – we have to split you up, you’re far too many to get into the pool all at once!” Harry shouted over the crowd.
“– and we played Bridge and I was quite content,” the Imagic shrugged apologetically before she addressed the former Headmistresses, “I had no idea you were trapped with me!” She dropped her glance and sighed, “I am so very sorry!”
Draco nodded. “Will they let you participate in the investigation? Now, that everybody knows you’re with me?”
Ron chuckled. “Yeah, she is. And I certainly don’t blame her… actually he comes in quite handy – her endurance on the dance-floor is much better than mine – I’m already beaten. I should probably let her lead…”
The class fell silent. Everybody knew that Patronuses of this shape were very rare and Harry’s stag was famous. Several students turned around to look at Harry and started to whisper. Finally Draco’s Patronus dissolved into thin air.
“Please forgive me for asking, I certainly don’t want to intrude – and I also don’t want to keep you any longer from your friends, your presence is eagerly awaited at the common room for sure – ” the Imagic motioned to open the door.
“Creating an Imagic is considered the highest form of Magical Arts, only very few artists are capable of it. It’s a required skill for the position of Charms Master of Hogwarts of course, as it is his or her duty to create an Imagic of the Headmaster or Headmistress for the famous portrait collection of Hogwarts.” Cass paused and added, “I’d very much love to see those paintings by the way…”
“As far as I know my son has been fascinated by you since your very first encounter at Madam Malkin’s – you might remember that? Harry Potter was all he would talk about for the rest of the afternoon.
“Aren’t they beautiful?” Ginny said softly as her eyes followed Draco and Cass.
“'You alright, Mr Potter?” Draco called after Harry. He sounded slightly worried – had he missed Harry at the early morning hour? Or was this just wishful thinking?
Harry laughed and took a sandwich which squeaked slightly when bitten. The smoking ham tasted very nice.
“Yeah, I might have charmed the cards a bit,” Dean grinned at Luna.
“Of course not,” cried Flitwick and Harry and his friends just nodded. It was quite embarrassing to hear about stuff like that in the presence of a teacher.
“Her Ladyship knows a great deal about everything,” McGonagall said with a smile, “this is an excellent idea, Ms Granger! Yes, please do so… but”, she looked at her watch, “maybe tomorrow … it is already very late.”
is the password? Not really a high security choice, is it?”
They all laughed. It wasn’t the first joke Tavin had cracked this evening, he seemed to be really witty. Harry totally understood why Tommy was smitten by his boyfriend. The way Tommy and Tavin looked at each other pulled at Harry’s heart. Would he ever find someone equally devoted?
“What are you even talking about? I’ve done nothing wrong! At least not since after the war… so I have nothing to fear, right? If the Aurors think they have evidence against me, they must have made a mistake and I simply have to sort this out!”
“I see a chair in front of a curtain, a curtain made of a heavy fabric with a strange pattern… wait a minute, are these ancient runes?” Harry asked.
Harry felt a pang of regret. “Look, I’m sorry. Truly, I am. It’s just… you haven’t found anything useful yet… just yesterday evening you said so yourself.”
– properly.”
best friends and you better keep that in mind.” Hermione glared at Harry. “No sneaking off, do you hear me?”
“I’m so sorry, Minerva,” he said, “there’s no signature on this painting and I’m not familiar with the artist’s style… I still have no idea who has painted it.”
Harry was oddly touched by this idea.
The moment Harry heard Ron mentioning Cass’ name – the penny dropped! He gasped. What an idiot he had been! Of course Ginny hadn’t snogged Draco – but Cassy! Suddenly everything made sense. How could he have been so ignorant? It was obvious – the girls were ever so close, they cuddled all the time and barely were able to keep their hands off each other – they were in love.
,” Hermione beamed at him. “Very clever! Malfoy owls are a special breed famous for secret messaging – I should have thought of that. Of course it must have been Draco’s idea to give you one of their owls last summer. Looks like he really was courting you even before you knew it.”
They climbed through the portrait hole and stepped down the staircase, away from the Fat Lady who looked far too curious for Harry’s taste.
As Blaise was very fond of gossip he had already told several people about Harry’s conflict with Professor Laddley before the Headmistress had asked for his discretion. He didn’t even known what exactly had happened and wasn’t fully aware of Tommy’s involvement, but still rumours spread among the students like wildfire.
“But… I’m not even a very good student! Surely teachers need an academic mind and I’m more… the practical type. I mean, I love Hogwarts but…”
“Oh yes, I can and I will with great pleasure! I will report your outrageous behaviour to the Headmistress immediately and I sincerely hope I don’t have to see
“He said, you seem to be interested in Magical Arts lately and it might be useful for you to know a bit about famous artists and collections.” Cass gave Harry a questioning look, who just stared at her. How come Draco knew about his interest? Harry was quite surprised as he had never told Draco anything about the Imagic issue.
“If you say so,” Harry said, “don’t worry, I’m not going to rip his head off or something, we’ve managed not to kill each other for seven years now – so I guess we’ll survive another one,” Harry grinned. “I’m just glad you finally get a chance to go to Hogwarts, it’s such a great school. Ms Malfoy said you’ll be taking sixth-year’s lessons? I’m sorry you won’t be in our year but the sixth year students are a nice crowd as well.”
Harry nodded.
“Many of the remaining Imagics are quite frightened,” Harry went on, “they are afraid to get abducted as well. Some have stopped visiting other paintings at all, others only dare to walk around in pairs.”
Harry reread the letter. ‘
Draco just snorted in reply.
A rattling sound from the window made them both turn their gaze and Harry gasped at the sight of Otto. Why was the owl back so soon?
been the one obsessed with that guy for years!”
“Leave him alone, Gin,” Cass looked concerned.
“But… surely Lucius Malfoy and the other offenders were put on trial by the Wizengamot?”
“As we have not enough space for the larger than usual number of students, an extra dormitory for all of the eighth-year students has been installed, which also serves as a guest house. Professor Jordan will be so kind as to see the eighth-year students to their own dormitory. That is all for now, further news will be discussed tomorrow morning at breakfast. In closing I would like to quote our most famous Headmaster Albus Dumbledore – ‘
“You need not worry, Sylvia,” said Headmistress Nightingale, “Severus Snape is a good person, in spite of his intimidating looks. He will return your dog as soon as we tell him, that you miss your pet, I am quite certain of it.”
What was that about? Harry wondered. Well, Tommy actually had a very nice peach of an arse, no denying that. Harry had seen him often enough in speedos. Not that he was interested, but still.
Draco sighed. “Well, then that’s settled. We’ll stay so Harry can do a bit of sight-seeing.”
“Yeah, I know… I went to a Muggle school and have some close Muggle friends.” Cass said. “But my father had reasons of his own, he most certainly didn’t want to preserve me… doesn’t matter anymore – I’m here and I intend to enjoy every moment of it!”
A knock at the door interrupted his thoughts.
“You don’t say!” Ron shouted. “Dumbledore’s Imagic is at Malfoy Manor!”
Laddley, disguised a Draco, had taken the cup to the Archive and threatened to invite some dark wizard’s Imagic to join Ariana, if her brother was unwilling to enter the cup – until Dubledore’s Imagic gave in. At least the Imagic had pleaded and delayed the inevitable until the Polyjuice Potion’s effect faded on Laddley – therefore Dumbledore was able to identify the perpetrator and leave a message. Laddley must have been immensely relieved, that none of the Ministry’s employees seemed to notice his changed appearance, when he left the Archives. Immediately after the abduction he returned the cup, now holding Dumbledore’s Imagic, to Taurus Malfoy. Laddley insisted he had no knowledge about its present place of hiding.
“I said you’re a good friend, idiot! The best! Hell, I have the best girlfriend and the best pal one could wish for – I really am one lucky bugger!” Ron rubbed his eyes.
Ginny and Cass giggled, while Neville had a coughing fit.
“It’s a black and white cat.”
Hagrid chuckled. “He’s funny, your Ottie, I think he’s just messing with you!”
“Good evening, Professor,” Harry said. He was determined to be polite no matter what.
“Well, we’re a boring old couple, Frankie and I. Frank’s a vet and I’m a social worker, mainly doing school counselling. In a way, that’s how we met David, because I mistook him for one of my students. You know David’s cousin, Cass?”
“We, the staff of Hogwarts consider dining arrangements to be an important means of communication. That is why students of all four houses of Hogwarts will share tables from now on, according to their progress in education. On the other hand – for living arrangements the houses keep their traditional dormitories and their common rooms as well.” A collective sigh of relief went through the hall which seemed to make the Headmistress smile. “First-years to seventh-year students will sleep at their respective house dormitories as usual.”
Ron stopped. He looked intrigued. “But how can you even say that? And be so damn sure about it? You haven’t exactly spent much time together – I mean, outside of a classroom, just the two of you? What Hermione calls ‘quality time’, right?”
“Well… you could fight for him.”
“Oh – I didn’t –“
Hermione grinned and Ron said with a puzzled expression, “Oi, what was that about?”
“You two, you’ve got potential! But improving your technique is not enough, you need to build some muscle too. Check out the gym and get wet as often as you can,” Laddley nodded towards the pool. “If you help me teaching the beginners, I’ll give you extra lessons in the evenings – what’ you think?”
“Yep, all set and done,” Hermione nodded.
Harry gawped at her.
“Hi Polly, what’s going on?” Harry addressed the over excited animal.
Having Josh for a teacher was far less distressing than Harry had feared. Any awkwardness was gone after the first lesson, Harry’s fascination for D.A.D.A. got the better of him. Josh being an excellent teacher helped too. During each lecture he shared stories from his work as an Auror and he reserved plenty of time for practice as well. Soon enough everybody agreed on Josh being their best D.A.D.A. teacher since Lupin – well, everybody except Draco Malfoy, who seemed to somehow resent Josh. Cass blamed Josh being Draco’s probation officer for the dislike, which sounded reasonable enough.
“Let me get that straight. You’re asking me, if I want to spend the weekend with my boyfriend and two cute dogs at your house? When I have the chance to go back to school at once, no doubt to be interrogated by the Headmistress and get myself buried under tons of missed lessons? Hmm… I’ve got to think about that carefully.”
Well, it would certainly take some time to get used to that but he quite liked the idea of being on such friendly terms with Draco’s mother.
*Auntie, grinning like a Cheshire cat*
After a moment of stunned silence Flitwick cleared his voice. “Well, at least that makes sense. If indeed such a painting exists, it might well be part of the Malfoy collection. They are supposed to own paintings with some truly unique magic and hardly ever show them to the public.”
Harry and Hermione stared at him for a moment, before they both started to grin. It was Friday at lunch-break and – thanks to one of Hermione’s famous warming charms – they were sitting outside in the grounds although it was freezing cold. They wanted to discuss the Imagic issue in private.
“But… why are you telling
She smiled at him. “I just couldn’t stand it any longer… a certain amount of pining might be fun, but eventually it gets unhealthy.”
No matter how tempting those grey eyes might be... and although Draco admittedly had a very cute ass... and however arousing it was to think of certain pale lips and slender fingers while… well, taking a shower. Harry cleared his voice.
Harry did as he was told and suddenly new information appeared on the board, squeezing in between the previous writing. There were even some facts Harry had not been consciously aware of, such as the date of Mrs Malfoy’s visit to his house which was Monday the 24th of August. And he had even managed to place a picture onto the board, showing a wizard he had never laid eyes on before! The man was very pale and had ash blonde hair, his forehead was unusually high and he had a piercing stare. Harry was quite certain, they had never met, but he still looked familiar.
Harry’s heart sank but he was not altogehter surprised. In fact he had expected something like this.  He nodded gravely and said, “I see. Including Dumbledore’s?”
“Although Cassy’s damned motto tormented my preferred costume of course,” Draco said winking at Harry, “hardly gender-bending if I dressed up as superhero Potter!”
“Hold on – you won’t tell me where you are hiding? But I would never ever tell anyone – not even Ron and Hermione!” Harry was affronted.
They came to a halt in front of a wide pond. Branches of a weeping willow were touching the surface and two swans were gliding on the water. It was a sight of superb beauty and peace. Narcissa Malfoy sighed heavily before she continued her story and they strolled on.
