Sighing, Harry hit 'end' instead. The number cleared and a dial tone filled his ears once again. It really would be reckless to answer the ad. This was probably how people ended up being victims of serial killers. They just walked themselves right into it – desperate. "Am I that desperate?" he whispered, matching his point with a pathetic laugh.
. Being around Draco made him crave numbness again. He wasn't over this man, and the sudden resurgence of all those feelings tonight left him reeling in a way he didn't know how to cope with — at least not in any way he could consider "healthy".
Because it wasn't
Ron waved away Harry's concern, scanning the page where it lay between him and Hermione on the table. "Just rewrite it in your own handwriting; he'll never know the difference."
The only hope he still had came from the fact that no one had told him Teddy was dead yet. He assumed someone would have said something by now, if that were the case. And healers kept coming and going from the room Harry and Charlie weren't allowed in. There had to be some sort of progress if everyone kept hustling about. That
"At least once more," Draco said with a shrug, leaning in conspiratorially. "I really can't help that my mother raised me with better manners than those Muggles did you."
And the torn family photo perfectly positioned in the middle of Harry Potter's desk, conveniently missing the corner where Charlie's face used to reside. A corner crushed in Draco's fist as he made his way down to the Atrium. A corner of mere paper that meant the start to something new and something real.
Teddy was tempted to follow in those footsteps after this conversation. Maybe James had the right idea. "He's a good kid," he said down towards his untouched sandwich, that word tasting dirty on his tongue. "I don't think you have much to worry about with him. Honestly, he's far too blunt to be the hiding type."
"And why did the children think Andre was to blame?"
' that would signify his absence. Just waiting for all of this to go wrong.
Everything began to make sense again….
for romance, especially considering his own stale love life. And the day he had discovered the personals section of the newspaper, he was instantly addicted. They were like the beginnings of paperback romance novels come to real and brilliant life. It was refreshing to ruminate over them and imagine where these people's lives ended up.
"Harry." Draco paused and waiting for Harry to once again meet his eyes — those silvery pools full of weighted acceptance — before continuing. "I've told you before; we can stop whenever you want. Don't apologize."
Bellatrix, momentarily nonplussed, cut her focus back to Draco. "Be careful choosing the sharp ones, dearest nephew. I know how much you like to have the control in any given situation."
Thank you to everyone who has patiently waited, I hope you're still enjoying!
"I would expect nothing less from my stalker," Potter continued. He must not have noticed the way Draco stilled. "And I am curious to know how many there have been. I don't keep track myself. Do you know the number,
Just as composed as ever, Draco shrugged and waved to a few of the youths playing a round of Exploding Snap in the recreational area as he passed them on his way back to the office. "Just doing my duty — you know, saving the damsel in distress."
Doubting Shea could fix a single one of his damn problems, Draco snorted derisively and spewed out, "This case is trying every ounce of humanity I have. Every ounce I suppressed for years. Every ounce that haunts me because of the things I have done. And working so closely with Potter on it all is killing me. I feel like we're teenagers again, except this time I'm choosing the right side. And I hate how wrong that feels. I hate that the biases instilled in me since I was a child still linger just under the surface. I hate that I can't get rid of them no matter how much I scrub at my soul. I took this job to help people. I like helping people. But this case…. It's hitting too close to the way things used to be. It's bringing up those old memories again.
," Bellatrix continued, unfazed, "exactly what I asked, little one. Where. Did you. Find him? My bet is he's a
"I still can't get it to go away," Teddy whispered. "But that's okay. Nan said she likes it." He smiled, a little sadness glazing his eyes.
Six sets of parents later, Harry was sure he was never going to let Teddy out of his sight again.
Draco pulled out his wand, looking ready to leave before his face contorted with one last thought. "Also, about last night…." Harry stood straighter, fingers clenched in the back of his shirt. "Everything's a bit of a blur. Nothing, ehm…. Nothing happened between us, did it?"
Draco's tight grip was on Harry's upper arm and in seconds the world around them shifted. Before Harry could even prepare himself with a bracing breath, he was squeezed through space and deposited in unfamiliar surroundings. A forest he didn't recognize. He spun in a circle, trying to make sense of it before facing the other again. "We need to get back to the office. I think I was wrong. I think I have the wrong angle."
Unfazed, Astoria took his place in front of the full-length mirror mounted to his wardrobe. "He's very sweet, Draco," she reassured while swiping a mascara fleck from her cheek. "Even if he was absent the day they taught you gays about fashion…."
Harry blushed as well and cleared his throat awkwardly. "Theodore Nott. The supposed whistleblower. And before you lecture me, yes I did sneak a peek at your file. And, yes, I know that's not legal. Spare me for a moment and just…just listen. And try not to judge."
Harry whipped around quickly, following Theodore Nott's offended pointer finger towards the entrance to the eighth-year common room where a sprig of mistletoe hung waiting to catch them all off guard. He had to work to contain the soft smile tugging at his lips, the visual echo of a soft memory. "Haven't the foggiest." Harry shrugged and turned back to his History of Magic homework in a way he hoped exuded casualty.
in the morning."
Except…perhaps Teddy wasn't voicing any to begin with. His lips were moving like he was trying desperately to convey something, but nothing seemed to be coming. Nothing but a small, stunned squeak as he started to falter. He shuffled on his feet, expression confused. His face fell or maybe he lost the ability to control it. If even the barest drop of that poison had touched his lips, this could mean the end. The very thought had Draco frozen when he should be reacting. When he should be saving.
When Harry had offered to help the centre, he hadn't meant like this….
wasn't certain about keeping it…. But after all this," she rushed to add, even though Harry hadn't made a move to interject, "family seems too important to give it up."
Every second seemed to crawl by as if in slow motion. It took Harry exactly three steps to reach him, but he could have just as easily been running a marathon for how long it seemed to take for them to finally come face to face. Draco blinked furiously, attempting to jar his brain into catching up. His heart was going to explode from its erratic pace if he had to wait any longer.
clubs did he find you?"
together.
Hermione ignored his protest, too busy apparently consulting with the Slytherins by way of cryptic eye contact. Daphne lifted one too-skinny eyebrow. Theo huffed a disbelieving noise which felt far more insulting than any actual insult could have. And Blaise… Well, Blaise was still actually trying to cram despite the distraction of the mystery mistletoe.
"Who's the lucky groom, then?"
Someone shouted Teddy's name. It sounded like Harry, but Draco couldn't be certain over the rushing in his ears. He couldn't even hear the words the boy was saying and they were standing but a meter apart.
"You're past curfew, Potter," DeWitt interrupted with no hint of fondness to either his tone or expression. He unfurled a scroll of paper, one brow raising as he examined it. "And the charm detected traces of alcohol."
"I have not been 'shacked up' with Draco, okay? Merlin's beard, we're only friends." Harry sighed. "I hadn't gone to see him since the article, either, and he was also worried. He just came by last night, helped me talk through a few of my irrational fears. He had a few too many drinks and ended up passing out in my bed. That truly is all of it, okay?" Harry waited for another nod before continuing. "And I'm sorry for shutting all of you out. Call me a right numpty if you want, but I was just…scared. Which I'm sure is something you could never relate to, right? You're too badass a woman to ever be bothered with such a feeling." He ended his apology on a cheeky smile, hoping Hermione was in a place to receive his sarcasm. Testing how deep her anger might run.
With a shrug, Harry stirred his coffee, watching the cream overtake the color. "Decent, I guess."
For the briefest of moments, Theo considered he might be getting played. There was a sick feeling in his gut that this was too good to be true. It was happening too fast.
Harry noticed Astoria's posture stiffen, but she remained otherwise composed, even despite the raw emotion dripping from her voice. "No, not directly," she explained. "After the wedding and our hilariously disastrous honeymoon — he won't admit it, but poor Draco hid in the toilet with fake stomach troubles for three nights in a row, just to avoid having to consummate the blasted thing — we decided to live our lives as we wanted, our parents be damned. We told them we wouldn't be producing an heir and they promptly cut us off. Only financially, of course, because they still expect us to attend dinners and holidays." She clenched her fists for a moment before setting them to comb through Draco's hair again.
fault. I killed my son…."
Draco didn't look up. He didn't even budge from his slumped position, but he did mutter a response.
"Have you considered…a different gift?" Ron asked.

"Oh, shit," she giggled, tripping over her own feet as she attempted to wrangle her heels off. She then proceeded to hush herself, falling back against the door.
is why. Our forced arranged marriage is why."
"But, it's like you always said, there's nothing a little sunshine can't fix," Hermione sighed wistfully, throwing the room into the glaring reality of the daylight.
With another roll of his eyes, Draco continued to take notes. "You'll also be meeting my paternal grandfather - Abraxas. He's the only grandparent I have left and he hates me more than anything in the world. Well…he might end up hating

to move on. I need a fresh start. Coming out to the world like this, all at once, it's exactly what I want to do. I'm tired of having to do this one person at a time. It's exhausting. I'm fucking
"How long?"
Harry was silent. It was clear he hadn't been expecting this. Perhaps he had even been anticipating only good to come of this day. He had obviously had it easy so far. But the world was violently catching back up with him. As it always did.
"Hey, Harry?"
. He was perfect for Harry Potter right down to his squeezably thick center. But they never had the chance to try and be anything but new. They never had the chance to discover what a happy ending might be for the two of them.
It had now been four years since that rushed fuck that changed everything. Four years since the collapse of Draco's life as he had come to know it. Four years since he'd confessed what had happened to Shea, tears and snot dripping down his face. Four years since he was sure that was the end. Four years since the man merely laughed and took him back home. Four years since the most understanding person his life tried (and unfortunately failed) to put Draco Malfoy back together again.
But that scent never went away. It was stuck in Harry's nose. It was nestled into his brain. It was like an incurable headache. It was there all the fucking time.
"Were they truly incapable of putting their own salads together?"
If only it were that easy.
They'd been doing this all night, hastily groping one another in between small moments of sleep. Somewhere around one in the morning, they took a break for hydration and snacks — tossing balled-up pieces of bread into one another's mouth while naked on the kitchen floor. But, otherwise, they stayed between the sheets, attached at the mouth and legs entangled.
She stalked out of the room far faster than any innocent woman would. The look left on Ron's face as she went was of absolute devastation under a cracking mask. He settled into a bench at the table, head falling to the wood-grain. "Never marry a stubborn woman, Harry," he grumbled, picking a corner off of the bread loaf.
The challenge was to take your emotion for the day and apply it a work. It was Saturday at the bookstore, so of course I was extra anxious. This is a follow-up to the previous Jeddy piece I did.
The focus hopped around the circle to whomever wanted to speak next. And with each person, the crease between Harry's brows grew deeper. Their stories were more tragic than he could have ever imagined.
, Luna!" Harry shouted.
Deacon breathed heavily through his nose, making for the door labeled as his own. "Please stop firing our assistants, Draco. You see, I do tire of doing interviews."
"The coffee shop give you a raise already?" James set the pot on the stove before sitting down at the table. Far too close for Harry's current comfort even if he was a bit satisfied in the shared warmth.
"It's as if a weight has been lifted from my shoulders, Mother. Thank you." Only a slight twitch of Malfoy's fingers in Harry's gave away his lie.
After a sobering minute, Draco finally spoke but still didn't look up. "Harry…has no one ever told you it's fine just to be yourself?"
But of course…the fates were never that kind. Not when it came to these two men in particular. They could just never catch a damned break.
Dating wasn't something he had put too much thought into before this very moment. There wasn't one particular reason for it. He just…wasn't all that compatible with other people. Men, women, children, etc. People were exhausting. It was much easier to sit here in his empty home, dwindling away the remnants of his fortune.
's asked me to assist…. Apparently since I don't have any others in my load, it makes me the perfect candidate. They need someone who can put in their full focus…."
Harry jumped, jerking his hand back out of the bowl. Behind and to the left of the desk was a hallway, likely leading to the rest of the building. At his end of it now stood a woman, someone Harry knew to be familiar but couldn't quite place. His heart beat erratically in his chest as he took in her tall, wiry frame and the close shave of her head. He swore if she had long, dark curls...
indelicately dropped in front of him by the family owl.
"I'm…I'm not really hungry?" Harry replied, looking absolutely confused even as he settled into a chair. On the table were no less than ten plates of food all covered in magical bubbles. "Your side of our fights doesn't usually come with a menu."
A small fleck of blue in a sea of silver.
"So bad," Potter agreed.
"Hullo?"
"You are?" Draco was sure Harry sounded surprised. Even though he'd been "out" since he was twelve. Everyone knew it; it wasn't like he tried to hide it. "Huh…well, a bloke, then." Harry shrugged, but he didn't seem otherwise particularly fazed by this new bit of information. Another tick in the
Frowning, Harry mimicked the tired action. "Is Teddy here? Or is he still with Shea?"
and those things he
"Comforting to know my standards have apparently fallen so low," Draco grumbled as he all but slumped down on the edge of his bed.
But he still found himself pulling away. Straightening up and putting distance between them. "I can't, baby. I can't. Something happened yesterday and Harry might be off the case as soon as we get in today. I should be there – no matter what ends up happening. And…I need you here. Helping me, just in case."
Mercifully, Draco insisted upon staying with Harry for the rest of the evening. After he'd forced Harry into a bath and a shave, of course. When he emerged feeling whole and refreshed once more, he found his flat looked just as clean. Draco sat waiting for him in the armchair, dinner and drinks set out for them on the coffee table.
He heard their woes.
you interested in, then?" In her usually valued, but not exactly welcome, opinion, he had no drive or ambition for his life. He'd never exactly been able to answer the school-time question of '
"I know," Harry whispered, his eyes falling shut. "It just sometimes still feels like habit. Like…like, I see glimpses of that old you sometimes and I just still haven't reconciled the two people as one. But I'm still sorry. I'm trying to be better. I'm trying to be…new, too."
"Shame," Jeremy muttered, his eye-contact jittery and intense. "I am currently single myself and…you certainly are better looking than your pictures suggest."
"This is not courage," Draco muttered. His vision roamed over the photographs again as he sighed. "This is cowardice. This is…not being able to accept the new world as it is. This is pining for a dirty past that never should have been. This is murdering children because of a fear of the future.
He didn't stop until they were right there at the forest's edge, releasing Draco's hand slowly like he might be unsure of the action. Draco eyed the trees over Harry's shoulder, his heart pounding fiercely in his chest from both vivid memories and festering dread. As difficult as it was to meet the vivid green of Harry's eyes, he forced himself to hold that still-imploring gaze. It was the most comfortable of his two present demons.
James was coming closer and every step he took quickened Teddy's breathing. He quickly thrust a hand up between them at the absolute last second, his stomach oily at even the most minimal contact. But every other cell in him was buzzing, excited at the idea of more. “We both had a hand in this,” James reassured, closing his hand over Teddy's fingers. Digging that contact further into his chest. “I kissed back. I asked for more. I laid down on your sheets and asked you to…to do it.”
Bellatrix was less careful to hide her reaction. Her brow furrowed as she set down her knife and fork, turning her body almost fully to face her nephew. "Andromeda's Nymphadora?"
I feel like this is only a tease of what's really going on beneath the surface... but I can't be sorry. Y'all will just have to keep reading to get the rest! Be sure to let me know what you think in the comments and, as always, thanks for reading!
If he had all of Charlie, he rationalized, he wouldn't need Draco. If he could get what he needed at home from his husband, he could forget about his first love. It was complete bullshit and the oldest excuse for cheating in the book, but he still used it as valid justification.
"Except the ones you strike up with me. Those should convey to anyone listening in that you are absolutely head-over-heels in love with me."
He had been waiting for the time to come where he would feel ready. Couldn't this be it?
"A whole
With him, Draco brought the massive folder of case files for every victim. Including Teddy. His fingers lingered over the manila cover before he wrenched it open and pushed pictures across the table. Pictures of every single autopsy – raw and brutal. "Fifteen children, all but one located in America, all poisoned in their beds in the middle of the night. Plus, of course, the attempted murder of Edward Lupin in Harry Potter's own home. A ballsy but stupid m-"
He couldn't believe himself for thinking it, but Harry was actually feeling inspired by Draco Fucking Malfoy. Which, strangely, really was a much better outcome than how he had assumed this night would go. "You know, it's not often I get to talk to someone like you…I mean…someone like me." An involuntary smile flittered over his lips. "And I don't yet know how to be someone like me, so I have to admit it's a bit refreshing."
Harry rolled his eyes and held back an overexcited laugh. Instead, he quickly stripped himself of all his clothing and climbed quickly back into bed. Settling right back into where he had been a moment ago. Those eager fingers plunging into Charlie's thick hairline and savoring the soft moan he pulled in response. "If I give you the spells, can you perform them?"
. A-and…and that's all. Period."
His fingers carved unlearned paths into Charlie's muscles. Desperately trying to memorize the shape and swell of each stretch of skin at his disposal. A stark contrast to the way Charlie's hands merely settled onto Harry's hips. Holding him there with a limp, unsure grip. Like he still reserved the right to flee at any moment. "Relax," Harry whispered against his lips with a gentle, chiding nip.
Of course, he was lucky they were so supportive, there was no denying that. But couldn't they have at least let him have his moment?
"Yes. I haven't found the right woman quite yet." Drew cracked an easy smile and moved towards the kitchen. "Is that why you're here? Is it suddenly a crime to be a single, middle-aged man?"
Biting her lip, Ms. Shelton shrugged and curled her fingers around Harry's upper arm. "He still has to check in, Mr. Malfoy. It's for everyone's safety." She tugged, forcefully suggesting that Harry follow her back to her desk.
Draco shrugged and bit back a yawn. "About five hours, maybe. Those are from Shea, by the way. He told me to get you the biggest one in the gift shop."
, not since we started fucking, at least." Somewhere beneath his hard tone was a thin layer of hurt. Harry could hear it. He knew what Draco sounded like when he was fragile. He was attuned to it now. This was, however, the first time
. You and your significant other are devastated. But it's not just that. You also have a newborn baby. A baby who has no idea what has just happened. All she knows is that she depends on you for absolutely everything. Don't you think, in some capacity, you might want to recover from your tragedy so that your small, defenseless daughter has a chance at a normal life?"
Harry merely shrugged. "I sent them to be with Charlie. They're more his, anyway."
The woman smiled easily and nodded. "Apparently you may have passed out. You hit your head, too. But you'll be okay. You only lost a little blood." She pulled a wand from her hip and cast a few, silent charms. The haze pulsed a few times, mostly staying closer to a bright green, only shifting orange a couple of times. "You're dehydrated and your blood sugar is low. It's likely why you took your spill. I'll order up some dinner for you as well as something to manage your pain. In the meantime…." She turned and poured a glass of water which she gently tucked into Harry's hand. "Drink up and keep resting. My name is Poppy and I'm your nurse. If you need anything, go ahead and give a shout. The warding on the room with alert me." With nothing but kindness, Poppy gently squeezed Harry's arm before gliding out of his view.
His cheeks flaring brilliant red, Harry suddenly wished he had that mug of tea to bury himself into right then. "Dad,
Harry couldn't help but to agree with the boy that this day was, indeed, The Best. He'd never seen Draco so relaxed in public as he did with his child's hand in his own.
"You're going out?" Narcissa sounded so concerned. She even managed an expression which almost matched. If only she could find a way to force genuineness into her eyes.
And along with all of this, there was an oily sick feeling sinking into the pit of his belly. "I have a theory…. I would need to conduct a few more interviews to confirm it. But I think it would be best to start again tomorrow."
"Since…. Shortly after Scorpius was born."
That felt like a jab, but Harry let it roll off for now. "Coffee is good," he said, feeling the weight of his sleepless night in his bones. "Two sugars and like a third of the cup cream." Instead of following Harry's instructions, Malfoy set an empty mug down before him and brought a tray with the carafe and cream and sugar pots to the table. "Thanks…," Harry mumbled and poured his own.
"Teddy, sit down. We're going to talk about this," Harry said sternly the instant they touched down in their own home again. The boy was already making to run away. He stopped abruptly, falling into a sitting position right in front of the fireplace. "I didn't mean right here…," he whispered, but sat across from him anyway. "So…are you going to tell me what happened? I don't want to punish you without knowing what you need punishing for."
Harry still wasn't sure he hadn't dreamt it all. Well, perhaps not all of it. His body ached from twisting in so much pleasure, so he was pretty sure most of the night had actually happened. There was also too obvious of a hickey on his hipbone to ignore the reality of his time with Draco.
"Harry James Potter, don't you
Draco knew he was guilty of this, too. He, just like all those other losers, shelled out six Sickles per update to receive those owls. When a day passed without one, he found himself lost. It was on those days that he could really recognise just how obsessed he had become. He was constantly scouting the air for a chance glimpse of a pair of wings. He would get irritated when he saw nothing. He would snap. He would troll outside of the places he knew Potter was likely to hang out.
Their absence from his bedside was much harder to explain. It led to the difficulty of the questions Draco had to ask. And he wasn't quite ready for that. Or, more appropriately, he wasn't quite ready to hear the answers. "The healers won't let them in," Draco said gingerly. "Not yet."
Harry had effectively shuttered himself away in his little panic room of a flat for fifteen days. He'd been marking them off with careful X's on the back of an old building bulletin, growing more and more hollow with each pen-stroke. Rationally, he knew there was no way he could keep this up forever. Already, he was growing lonesome. Even if he was terrified to face people following his too-public coming out, he missed human interaction. The television wasn't exactly a proper replacement for real people. And he really could only wank so many times in one day to a fictionalized version of someone.
"You know, I think I made a mistake," Harry sighed while resolutely taking a step away. "You opened your mouth and ruined your entire appeal. It's just sad, really, how easily you fucked it all up."
A haunted echo of a smile graced Draco's lips. "You may just have to settle for a divorce…and maybe some counseling."
On the bed, Draco was starting to stir. He was groaning and adorably confused, but Harry really could only handle one catastrophe at a time. After a second of waffling between his two friends, Harry threw the potion down on the bed with a promise to be back in a moment and ran out after Hermione, calling her name. She hardly turned to acknowledge him and kept on her steady path back to the fireplace. "Wait!" Harry urged, a hint of pleading in his tone.
"And I feel like there was a burnt taste. Did you get that, too?"
A young Muggleborn girl who could be no older than sixteen had been abandoned by all her friends at Hogwarts after she attempted to kiss one of them in a moment of celebration. She barely managed to get the words out through her whole-body sobs.
Not that Draco was complaining.
of me to think you'd changed?"
was going to be his true undoing). He memorized the strangled color it took on and the exact way his bollocks wrinkled. He committed all of this to memory, all while knowing he'd have to obtain a Pensieve to be able to remember it as vividly as he ever hoped to.
Potter's words held a strange pressure. His hands were still working Theo's chest, fingers just going far enough downward to drive him crazy.
Just after Harry had arrived home with his husband, Draco broke into the house. It was by pure coincidence that they arrived at the same time. He had intended to get there before them. To take what he needed and be ready for what was to come. He knew all of his ex's wards and how to disable them. For this plan of his, all defenses needed to be down. The slightly paranoid, cautionary behavior so typical of Harry wouldn't help them catch this guy. Neither would Draco standing out in open sight just outside. Which was why he needed to break in. He needed that invisibility cloak. And he knew just where Harry kept that, too. Locked away in his school trunk next to everything else he tried desperately to forget.
It was only fitting that he were here now. The universe was right and finally back in balance. He was here, locked up and facing trial and Harry Potter was on the other side, giving him that
"Don't be so dramatic, Potter," Harry muttered under his breath even as he, rather dramatically, leaned his shoulder into the door and rested his forehead against the solid, grounding wood. "You'll make this your year. You
. And it was, coincidentally, then that one of the issues decided to solve itself. As he stood to try and stretch out even just a hint of the tension in his shoulders, the front door opened and Astoria came in literally stumbling.
"Yeah? That's good." Harry smiled, leaning down to kiss the top of the boy's head. His hair was still a shocking magenta. The same shade his mother used to wear. A shock to everyone from day one until now. He'd seen a picture of Tonks very recently, one taken just before her passing. The realness seemed to have stunned him a bit. And now…it was just stuck.
"Bullshit," Harry spat, seemingly unable to keep his distance any longer. He stepped right up to the bars, fingers white around them. Draco couldn't fault him for that seething hatred in his eyes.
Draco merely blinked back at Harry, one perfectly delicate eyebrow raised.
-ing back against the upper cabinet. "Bloke's still as gorgeous as ever, and knowing I ruined what I had with him? There's no fucking words for it."
"You've had so many. It's perfectly understandable if you would forget one of their names now and then."
"Teddy, can you just for
Harry's words came out harsher than he had intended. He could tell by the way Draco's breath hitched and his hand finally fell from Harry's back. But he didn't say a single word in reply until they had both apparated back to his backyard. And when he did…. "If your life and your marriage were so fucking secure,
"She's not like us," Draco mumbled, confirming why the thought of it made Harry so squeamish. He skipped the idea of a chair altogether and fell into a heap on the floor, leaning against the side of Harry's with the soft strands of his hair falling over Harry's arm. "I would never force someone to come out like that. I wouldn't even threaten it. But what that woman did as a teenager…. We all know my aunt was deeply disturbed, but even she didn't deserve the way Skeeter broke her heart back then. She should be ashamed of it, at the very least for the way things ended."
No one was around to hear them, but Harry felt it was important to back up his resolution with real words. If anything, he needed to prove it to himself that he could even say them. It felt like a step in the right direction. Like a commitment. He strode back through the door, right up to the window. The flag outside rippled in the slight breeze, like it was greeting him. With irrational delicacy, he grazed his fingertips over the glass and released a breath, feeling oddly comforted by his actions.
"Tainted magic."
Harry nodded, feeling a very satisfying relief at that. "Think we'll see this guy behind bars today?"
"I was. I don't consider magic a part of my life anymore." Smiling tightly, Graham took another long drag. "It wasn't something that runs in my family. I was the only one. I didn't like the way that made me feel. Alienated…. So when I met Ricky, I put it all behind me. Haven't looked back since.
He wanted a happy ending.
, that kiss. And he couldn't deny that for just a moment – just that singular moment – he felt like maybe there was more to Malfoy than he presented to the world. And just that thought put him in a sort of stupor.
Fast as a shifting gust of wind, Luna jumped to her feet. Harry startled, but laughed it off easily, the lightness of it feeling welcome upon the panicking pulse of his heartbeat. "I think I know what would help!" she exclaimed, doing a quick twirl before extending a hand down towards Harry.
"How about…around him?"
imagined. I'm merely carrying out his good work. Someone has to. Someone has to have the courage to do it."
like you thought I was going to hurt you. You haven't looked at me like that in...
"Can you reach your wand?" Harry asked, gasping for breath a few minutes later. He felt punch-drunk, a thrill akin to the start of a new relationship. Every sensation felt new and passionate.
"Only in pictures." Draco's voice was tight and controlled. He was also affected by the young girl's corpse, but was desperate not to show it. "This was the first body we had on our table. For all of the others, we only had the Muggle examinations to go off of. But it's all the same. The only difference is that we know what did this to her while they're all still baffled."
Attempting to lighten the mood – the
So...yeah, it's been awhile since the last update. To say the least, this babymaking process has been frustrating. Recently learned that I am pregnant after being told initially that I wasn't. And since finding that out it's been nothing but issue after issue. So right now we're playing the waiting game to see if baby is sticking around...
"Go on."
"You shouldn't be around Malfoy."
His carefully guarded freedom was walking out the door and he was helpless to stop it.
Harry snorted and Draco couldn't blame him for his disbelief. "Then clear it up for me, Draco." His voice was more strained than Draco could remember it being since their reconciliation. Even his body was tight. There was anger in every single part of Harry. The warmth and laughter he cherished was gone.
Shea shrugged, rather pointedly keeping his gaze trained upon the laptop screen. "Said he was tired or something. He went upstairs." The tension from the morning was definitely still in full effect in every syllable of the words he spoke to Draco. And most likely would still be until the intruders to their home were gone.
"Or, at least ones that won't be public."
Charlie was wringing his hands as he paced and Harry took an unhealthy satisfaction in making him sweat. "Bill confessed. He's not denying anything. And he's actually given the name of someone who helped him cover it up…."
Harry explained the full-detail of the night, skipping for now his own troubles. He started with a shaky recount of what they had for dinner and the Bakewell tart he knew his husband would have loved for dessert. A slow and gentle transition into the unsavory details. The debacle that he could only relay secondhand because he still didn't know what
"He's fine. This isn't an easy situation. There's no easy way to handle it."
"And what does that mean?"
." Draco's face further paled, if that was even possible, and he pulled a repulsed face. "No. Thank you. The potion should kick in soon." He finally opened his eyes again and levelled Harry with something between a wince and a smile as he resumed buttoning his shirt. "Hey, can I Apparate from here, or do you have wards up?"
Of course, these were all normal day-to-day things that wouldn't usually send him to the edge. But today….
Ron shrugged back. "Couldn't hurt, could it? Either that or just ignore it. If he thought you were asleep, maybe he didn't actually want you to hear it." Looking thoroughly impressed with his own advice, Ron failed to hide a proud smile by pursing his lips and looking away.
Draco shrugged, scratching one last note before tucking the clipboard under his arm. "It looks like you have a good path paved for it." His smile was tight, but filled Harry with hope nonetheless. "Just keep doing what you've been doing."
Again, that flicker of anger radiated inside Harry's chest. He'd just finally come to terms with who he was. He finally put a tangible name to it. And now? Now he was supposed to keep questioning that? When would it stop? When would it ever be acceptable for him to just feel content with who or what he was?
Leaving Harry breathlessly giddy at the idea of finding his people. People he could relate to. People he could share experiences with. People he could maybe even date….
For the first time in the last couple hours, Teddy willingly met Harry's eyes. He looked like he had tears still welling in his own. And maybe it was just wishful thinking, but Harry was certain there was something he wanted to say. Something he was holding back for…whatever reason. "I also need you to go get me your new coloring pencils. I'm going to hold onto them until you've earned them back." The threat of moisture finally came through. Fat, horrible tears rolled down Teddy's cheeks as he grudgingly nodded before lumbering off to do as he was told.
"Everybody knows it's my favorite dessert."
Before he could even think to miss Draco's presence, he was fast asleep.
It was easier not to
Harry rationalized they were on edge enough for the moment. And so was he. This thing they were doing was starting to feel less like fun and much more serious. He hadn't really signed on for a political statement. He wasn't sure he had what was required of someone so strong. People like that were likely far better adjusted in life than he was.
However, when it eventually became apparent Ron couldn't find anything else to add, Harry took pity on him and steered him towards the fireplace. There was plenty of time in the future for everything left unsaid. He thanked his friend for stepping in, reminding him that he probably shouldn't continue to do so in the future. As always, this statement was quickly brushed off with a promise to always be there when Harry needed it most.
This arrangement with Potter (of all people) hadn't been created lightly. Astoria only agreed to it after her terms had been negotiated – they would stay married, no one else would ever find out, and Draco would have to get her pregnant first. Their marriage wasn't born from love and Astoria couldn't deny that it felt better to merely be this man's friend. She didn't need companionship. All she needed was to please both their families while under a safe and steady roof. Especially once Scorpius was born and Astoria's blood malady ruined her.
"You really can call me Harry. If you want me to even pretend to be-"
A feeling only made worse once Potter started dating.
For the first time in a very long time, though, he felt nervous walking through the front door. The little bell above the frame tinkled loudly, giving him absolutely no time to quell his nervous composure.
It was reckless.
"Forget about what happened yesterday." On the counter next to the French press was a file. It was clean and crisp. No signs of wear or use. They hadn't poured over this one for hours and hours. It was new. "There's been another…. I've been up all night with the parents."
"Why not?"
In his irate state, Harry was clearly irrational. The moment he heard the door creak open, he nearly snapped. He nearly reached out to choke the person behind it. Or punch them. Or…hex them if he could manage the spellwork through his fury.
It felt good to have a barrier between him and that still-warm bed on the other side. The space and change of scenery allowed his head to clear, the heat of his impulses fading away to a manageable dull ache. For good measure, he splashed cold water over his face and buried a heavy sigh in the towel when he scrubbed himself dry again. With his thoughts once again manageable beyond the curve of Draco's hipbones, he continued his morning regimen. He brushed his teeth, fussed with his hair for a few seconds before giving up, and rolled on a layer of deodorant. As a final step to clear the dull ache from overindulgence, he downed a vial of Hannigan's Hangover Cure. As a further show of good faith and manners, he grabbed one for Draco as well and made to exit the bathroom, but paused at the sound of his Floo activating.
Outside, far below the window, the sound of crunching gravel broke the monotony of repetitive footfalls. Grateful for the distraction, Harry watched the bright lights of a compact car make their way down the drive. That would likely be the one called to take him away. To take him home. He inwardly scolded himself for not seizing his opportunity to leave, but soothed the ache with the idea of doing what was right. Although he had no attachment to Malfoy or his pain, he still felt there was an underlying obligation to help him. To stick through it.
Draco said 'we' like he had a say in any of this. Like he hadn't run all those years ago. Like he had remained loyal by Harry's side all this time. He said it so casually as if it merely rolled off his tongue. Absolutely natural. Absolutely
And there it was, the harsh reminder these patrol officers always made sure to slap in his face.
tried to hide his amusement, but he never really was all that adept at policing his emotions. "Sorry to hear that. Dating can be difficult." He smiled, something dark like sadness shifting across his eyes for just a moment. "And on Valentine's Day, no less. Ooph, that's gotta hurt."
Not for the first time in his life, Harry cursed just how much he looked like his father. He squeezed his eyes – the only visible trait he'd inherited from his mother – shut for a moment to try and quell the pain shooting through his chest. The scar spanning down the right side of his forehead, just barely cutting into his eyebrow, felt too warm below her touch. A bitter reminder of the less than perfect parts of their life. "Mum, it's me," he whispered, his voice cracking with emotion. "It's Harry. You know what happened…."
. Fuck. Just stay here, Charlie. If you ever loved me, you'll cooperate."
indicated they were running on limited time and he didn't want to be the reason anything was delayed. Once he had finished draping lacy tablecloths over every surface, he moved closer to the stage, carefully keeping his distance from Draco's manic path as he set props about for the drag queens and rolled out the purple, appropriately-named Magic Carpet.
Alright...so I'm not even sure how I feel about the direction this chapter took. Full disclosure: I'm consuming a TON of hormones and they're fucking with my head. I'm nothing but fuzz and static. In addition to that, my depression is off the charts because my body just doesn't know how to be fertile, I guess. So, yeah, all of this was written under stress and duress and I am keeping it. I waited a few days to post to make sure I liked it and I think I'm finally convinced that I do.
"And you declined it, right? We decided you wouldn't work any cases until he was at school."
Was it possible his fall from sobriety began not when he took his first sip this evening, but instead when he accepted Draco's request to sit with him on Valentine's Day?
"That would be because I don't share my personal business around the office," Draco muttered, once again through his teeth. "And I would appreciate not sharing it here. As I said before, our visit is purely business."
For a moment, Malfoy regarded him in stale silence. He was far too adept at diminishing a person's confidence beneath a simple gaze. But when he did finally answer, he seemed to hold no contempt for the curiosity. "Technically, Father did nothing, since he was never convicted. But my aunt is very proud of…," he faltered, a comforting sign towards his own unease. He swallowed, betrayed by the bobbing of his Adam's apple, and rushed to say, "Of nearly killing an innocent young couple."
"Why's that?"
Luna tilted into the touch and patted the back of his hand. "There's a lovely organization who've set up down the street from the Leaky. An equality centre for witches and wizards and other magical folk. I've gone to a few of their functions over the years and they have a group of people like you — queer-type people who are just coming out or coming to terms with themselves. They meet once a week for socializing and whatnot. They're called Sparks, isn't that just perfect?"
"Good to know..." Harry breathed long and slow, gathering his thoughts, before standing back up. "Thanks for your time, Chief. I'll be taking the rest of the day as personal leave." He gave a tongue-in-cheek salute before yanking the door open with enough force to drive it into the wall with a loud
"It's not an imposition if I'm asking you to stay. I'm asking for your help, Harry." Hermione made a show of touching her stomach again, raising a brow like he was supposed to catch on to something.
's bo—."
"Surely that man you were wasn't all bad." Draco's tone dripped with reason. "I mean…yes, you had your shit to work through. But who didn't after what we all went through? That doesn't make you a terrible person. That doesn't make the man I fell in love with…any less deserving of that love."
"I don't like chess," Teddy mumbled, setting down a now-skinless potato. Despite his protest, he slunk (not so quietly) out the door and up the stairs.
"You know I'm not going to hex you, right?"
"Yeah, I know, don't go gossiping about the Malfoy family's life of crime."
. Allowing whatever damage he left behind the chance to speak his frustration because he wasn't sure if he was ready to burst into tears or flames.
This right here was the biggest reason Draco didn't want to talk to this man. McClain was deranged and there was no seeing reason for someone like that. Not when they were embedded this deep. "By murdering innocent children," Draco said under his breath before jabbing one of the pictures with his finger. "Aren't you proud enough of your beliefs to own up to your handiwork? Aren't you proud enough to tell the world that you are the sick fuck who poisoned sixteen children?"
"You're not cold. You're wonderful and warm and I don't want to lose you." Shea sank to his knees on the carpet, reaching out to ghost his fingers over Draco's kneecaps. "But I don't want you to lose him, either. I didn't know he was the reason for it, but you've been different. Happier. I thought it was Scorpius. Or maybe it was returning to your world. Maybe both of those things were a part of it. But I think it was Harry who really made you happy. And I like it when you're happy. I like the man you are…when you're happy.
But he was there and he
By the time a tawny owl appeared on his balcony just as the sun began to set, Harry had fully changed his mind on the whole forgetting thing. He was almost relieved to see his name in Draco's careful script on the parchment and nearly tore the letter trying to wrestle it away from the finicky bird. After dumping a pile of treats in front of it, the owl finally released the letter and Harry carried it back inside like it was the most precious and breakable thing he'd ever held.
This plan of his only made it worse, as well.
When it finally came time for pudding, everyone agreed they'd already gorged themselves enough and opted instead to collapse into the hodgepodge of furniture in the Malfoy's sitting room. Harry nursed a celebratory glass of champagne, not one for the taste of it, while his companions drank straight from their second bottle. They made a giggly pair of drunks, that couple, and in their vulnerability Harry could easily spot the way Draco held Astoria with the softness of a sibling instead of a lover. It was sweet, really, the relationship they seemed to have crafted from the trauma Draco had referenced earlier in the evening.
The instant his boy's name came out of Bill's mouth, Harry snapped. The anger returned in full force, presenting itself with a sharp and unexpected punch right to the square of his brother-in-law's jaw. His knuckles were throbbing just after contact, matching the speed of his racing pulse. The pain didn't register initially, though, just the sound. The shocked holler and the 'pop' of something potentially breaking. "Did you think he wouldn't
Electing to stay here and play in this world had, with one simple sentence, become the dumbest mistake on his ever-long list.
And reckless called for abandon.
The ceremony was held at the edge of the lake, the descending evening sun causing the lake to shimmer beautifully behind the couple. Lovegood wore a laurel-green organza gown embroidered with glittering vine appliques along her white corset bust. It fit in perfectly with their lush surroundings and complemented Longbottom's simple white suit nicely. Aesthetically, it was all very pleasing. And, romantically, doubly so.
Teddy forced a smile of his own, interrupted by a fit of coughing. "Not great," he muttered once he'd regained his breath. "And, uh…really confused."
A deafening ringing filled Harry's ears. His head went blank and fuzzy and he was sure the room was spinning. This was panic. Fight and flight were waging a war within him, begging him to react. Hermione's warnings suddenly felt real and vivid. He was in danger here, under this roof with at least one person capable of killing.
"I need a fucking break." He stood hastily from his chair, unable to take it any longer. Since just after lunch, they had been talking circles around these files. And every single time Harry tried to voice a new approach, he was cut off before he could finish. For someone so desperate for help on this case, Deacon was incredibly limited. "Excuse me," he mumbled, stalking out of Deacon's office with no real destination in mind.
For a moment, both uncomfortably long and surprisingly short, Draco was left in anticipatory darkness. He held his breath, savouring the moment of feeling almost weightless. The wind picked up gently, wafting the scent of Harry — simply aftershave and generic soap — under Draco's nose. Every sensation pooled together to construct a general stillness. Of contentment and belonging.
The only other notable thing Harry left in the small, cramped flat was the ghost of himself. Every crack and corner of Draco's home was filled with the memory of the man he had come to love more than anything he could remember even dreaming for his life. Memories of where he'd sat, where they'd shagged, where they'd sunk to the floor in the kitchen and just…talked about absolutely nothing and everything all at once. Draco couldn't even grab a mug from the cupboard without some wanton thought pushing its way into his mind.
So he smiled and he shifted just enough to close the gap between the two of them. He laid his hand over Malfoy's. He squeezed. And when Malfoy gazed back at him, absolutely any person looking on would think the two of them were in love.
"I don't have a scheme!"
"Everything okay?" Hermione was frowning, he could hear it in her voice. It dripped with concern and confusion as she retook the seat across from him, all thoughts of cake forgotten for the moment.
"Yeah, I guess you haven't altogether ruined my birthday, either," Draco chuckled and relaxed back into his chair. For a silent second, he looked over Harry again before adding, "For the record, though, Tori's bringing back Chinese takeaway and if you eat any of my wontons, I
Harry forced a laugh. "In my defense, you pushed me..."
Even Arthur and Molly were laughing along. Normally they merely humored their son, but they seemed to genuinely need the distraction this time. All of them did. Especially Ginny who sat as far away as she could, still nursing her untouched dinner plate with a blank stare.
There were those dog-like commands again. Harry squinted at Malfoy's slim figure until the door closed behind him. At this point, he was about ninety-nine percent certain this man didn't have friends. And he certainly didn't have a real boyfriend or partner or…. Could anyone even stand him long enough to be a fuck buddy?
And Harry had ached for it ever since. He truly did love his husband. He was kind and attentive and gorgeous. He had such a gentle touch for someone so indelicate. And the way he made Harry feel that day, taking control and roughly fucking away their fear…. Touching him darkly and filling him up. Trying to make him forget how sickly worried he was just for a moment.
with Ricardo about who I was and…what I was…."
All it did was solidify what Draco already knew – Shea was far too pure for him.
Suddenly self-conscious, Draco pulled himself (a bit wobbly) to his feet. He brushed the grass from his backside as inconspicuously as he could and, by habit, smoothed back his hair.
He closed his eyes, breaths coming shaky and shallow from both the tears welling behind his lids and the memory now ingrained in his mind. Potter left him empty, lying beside him but still entangled by breath and limb. He caressed Draco wherever he could, almost to the point of overstimulation, but Draco wasn't about to complain. He wasn't about to give up even a second of being so close.
"Oh, I noticed," Ron interrupted with a snort. "Hermione all but chewed my arse for not requesting the night off before it was too late. Guess who bought their wife a ten-Galleon bouquet of special delivery flowers this morning." He raised his brow to indicate just who it could have been.
Like he was malleable and easy to sway. Theo had to hold back a grin in response to his wavering. Potter didn't even know it, but he was playing right into his hands.
"Isn't that something I'm not supposed to remember?"
Although Harry's tone said there was no room for discussion, Charlie was quickly on his feet. Ready to plead his own case on the matter. "Darling, you promised. We both agreed that since I was gone so often…Teddy needed someone who could be there for him. And consistently. You only have a couple more months of this deskwork. Why can't this wait? Why can't someone else take it?" He settled up right before the fire, his arms crossed in front of his chest. Looking every bit intimidating, if only he didn't carry such a soft and pliant expression. "Why does it have to be
"One," Draco counted, drawing the word out as Harry set to shimmying out of his own clothes. He just wanted a moment to catch up and feel like an active participant instead of sitting there gaping like an overwhelmed idiot.
The two halves of his heart were standing by the bonfire. How could he focus on how much it hurt when they were grinning so wide and beckoning for him to be by their side?
What he ended up focusing on the most, however, came down to that statement just before Draco left:
, I thought you were a burglar!"
Harry wasn't sure if he had proved anything by it exactly, but he did manage to get through all of the information Malfoy wanted learnt within those next few hours. By the time night had just begun to set, he was thankfully looking at Malfoy's house from over his shoulder. Watching it disappear through the back window of a cab. For the night, he was through with this strange charade. He was expected back early the next morning, of course. But in that moment, his life was his own and it felt more refreshing than he could have imagined before.
With the alcohol weighting his head and blurring his memories, Harry wasn't sure if anyone had. Sadness welled in his throat and he swallowed to temper it. "Everyone has this idea of me. Sometimes it's just easier to live up to it."
"Malfoy…."
"I'm honestly wishing I hadn't," Harry sighed.
Andrew McClain lived in a normal house in a normal suburb in the inconspicuous state of Maine. He had roses planted by his mailbox and kept his grass well-cut. His house was an unobtrusive blue and there was a dependable four-door sedan in the driveway. Nothing was amiss about any of it.
Charlie's lips were soft in Harry's hair. Soft and kind and just so typically
"What about Teddy? Won't that be a bit of a distraction to your 'full focus'?" Hermione asked gently. Of course, she would be the first to point out the one flaw nagging at him.
?" Malfoy snapped and pulled away, crossing his arms over his chest.
Every time, Draco was just as patient as the last. He would skim a kiss over Harry's jaw or caress his fingers across Harry's neck, whispering that it was okay and that they could wait. He spoke of the right moment like it was a dreamscape, ready and waiting for them.
"No, my
In the end, Draco said nothing. He didn't offer any advice or try to tell Harry anything he didn't already know. Instead, he stayed silent. He stayed there. He
It certainly wasn't what Harry was expecting. He had thought maybe the building front would be painted in extravagant rainbows or something equally garish. Which, of course, seemed silly to him now. The more colourful and inviting a building looked, the more difficult it was to hide under illusion charms. At least that's what Hermione had said in defence against Ron wanting to paint their house a nearly-neon shade of blue. That very well could have been a fib, but it sounded valid enough.
Mostly in spite of Hermione, Harry did exactly the opposite of what he should have. He went home, as he said he would. But once he was there, the words wouldn't come. He took one look at Draco curled up in a chair in the library, soft and delicate, and pushed all of his worries to the side again. Not permanently...just for that moment. He needed to be able to see Draco in the light for just a bit longer...
Harry was wearing a sickening grin when Draco turned around to face him. "No you weren't," he whispered, snapping shut the bottle of massage oil. "Not really, anyway. I know how you think of me."
"Oh, I think we were just about to leave, be careful with your clothes." Teddy already had a grass stain on the back of his little polo shirt. Draco tried not to look bothered when he turned to Harry for help. For a half-second, Draco caught an odd gleam in those green eyes and faraway smile before Harry whistled for the dog to go inside.
Between all the facts, Draco could only guess at the situation. That said, he had a pretty good hunch forming. His stomach churned at just the thought, but he needed to keep strong for this boy. He needed to keep a soft turn up to the corner of his lips and he needed to keep the panicked timbre from his voice. "I know this must be very painful for you, Teddy," he whispered, knowing anything louder would betray him. "I can only imagine how you must be feeling knowing the very little that I do…. But if you could give me something to work with, I promise you I will make whoever is hurting you pay the highest cost."
Truthfully, Harry hadn't thought far past his grand romantic gesture. He hadn't considered repercussions. He supposed it was likely Draco might whip out his wand the instant he attempted anything (and not in the sexy euphemism way), but it was also likely that he wouldn't. They had grown close since the start of term, moving swiftly from simply tolerating one another to actually enjoying being in one another's presence. And they were in that situation often seeing as they now shared a dorm room with the small number of other boys in their year who had been too caught up in the war to finish their seventh year.
Some of the attendees calmed when Draco asked him to open the meeting by introducing himself. He'd explained how he was in the process of telling people he was gay. That he was only "out" to a handful of his friends and one of them had encouraged him to seek out the centre. Someone cheekily asked him if he was single, which set the group to giggles when he blushed tomato red and begrudgingly nodded. However, his sharing ended there and they moved on to the next person with something to say.
Abraxas was also easily identifiable because Malfoy had painted a perfect picture of him, right down to the extravagantly technical wheelchair parked in front of the roaring fire. He looked not only quite old and frail, but also like he had the largest stick in the world wedged expertly up his ass. It was easy to believe he might revile absolutely anything and everything and make it known. Just the way he was eyeing Harry in that moment, a queer man who thought he actually passed rather easily, spoke louder than words ever could. What exactly did that mean for his infamous wicked tongue?
"I sent her for tea." Draco stood, sealing the letter and sending it away with a charm. He managed to still Harry's erratic breathing with the same, entrancing motion.
Harry's head flashed back up. Malfoy still stood in the same spot, watching him. Studying him? "I-I know," Harry stammered, forcing a laugh. "We're beyond all that schoolboy nonsense, yeah?"
"Tell me exactly what that means."
Draco's eyes shone with moisture under the lamplight when he met Harry's, and Harry found that he, too, was near tears. That his heart also felt that sentiment so deeply that he wanted to cry.
And then, all the other guests were gasping and buzzing with excitement, breaking the heavenly quiet. But all Draco could focus on was the pounding of his heart, so erratic despite the calm, before it came to a full stop once the weight settled into his arms.
It started with and banked upon Harry leaving and that, by far, wasn't the worst part but it sure felt that way. Not only because Draco now had to finish this case out on his own, but also because he was going to miss the presence of that man at his side again. It would be foolish of him to deny the violent feelings waging wars within him about that confusing subject.
Lots of emotions. Sorry not sorry....
Draco, feeling weirdly wrong in his own skin, nodded and hooked his arm through Harry's. Touching him always felt so intimate. Like their skin was on fire and the only solution to put that fire out was to strip down and hold one another. But the sensation today was different. The clothing between their skin didn't feel thick enough. The fire was ice and all he wished was to let go. He made short work of the apparation, landing them square in the entrance hall.
and they wanted to bask in his greatness for even just a single second.
Of course it was Harry.
All the while, Draco's hand never left his leg. The pressure was grounding and eventually enough to level him back out. "Sorry," Harry muttered when he felt he could catch his breath again. "I just…."
"I don't exactly know how I feel about that. I just know that it's not really a good feeling right now." And the hardness in Charlie's eyes definitely confirmed that. "But moving past your ex-boyfriend…who's going to be taking care of Teddy when you're working odd hours in America? Because I assume that's where you'll be if he's asking for your help."
, so I read them and read them and obsess over them. And then they repeat night after night…. They're worse, Cheryl. They're getting worse. They're becoming more vivid. And
I would never want to do something to fuck that up."
In all honesty, there was an exhaustive list of things they needed to talk about and Harry was certain he wasn't ready to broach a single one of those topics. The sound of his heartbeat replaced the general din of the café around them, signalling the coming of his own undoing. Whatever it was Draco wanted to talk about, it ultimately would come back to his current life path and past mistakes. Although that was ultimately what they were here for, Harry couldn't pretend he was remotely prepared for that conversation.
"It really is just a misunderstanding," Draco said to his knotted hands. Feebly begging for pity where he definitely didn't deserve it. "The items they found…they weren't mine." The tired excuse 'I'm holding them for a friend' sprang to mind and his cheeks darkened.
"Oh, no!" Astoria whined, sounding genuinely put out. "You're already here, how about Draco gives you a tour? I was just about to step out to grab us something to eat, anyway. I think it would be lovely for the two of you to catch up. Wouldn't it? Maybe you could even stay for dinner?"
It was easy.
Stopping so suddenly he nearly lost his composure, Draco nodded slowly. His lips tingled with the phantoms of a kiss he shouldn't steal as he turned away. "Yes…we should." He steeled himself on a shaky breath and tore the door back open with far-too-much force.
to do with this man. But all of it seemed so trivial. Dropping to his knees right there to show how he really felt definitely wasn't appropriate. Neither was making any sort of rash decision on their future without consulting Teddy first. They'd been through so much. They still had so much to go through. These unanswered questions hanging between them only added to the problem.
Draco had been told most of his life that he wasn't 'good'. He had been bullied into believing he wasn't worthy of love, a fact sealed for him by his arranged marriage. Since he was a child, he had been told what to believe and who to be. Who to make alliances with and who to avoid. Even now that they were together, there were still nights where he would ask
Harry read the letter three times over before he felt satisfied enough to set it back down. His heart, now stilled to a normal beat, felt simultaneously full and hollow all at once. What Draco had written was so light and full of hope. There was the hint of a plea in there somewhere, a desire for a repeat of their night before. He didn't even sign off with a mention of love, which had Harry second guessing himself once more. It was all entirely too much and not enough and all Harry wanted to do was Apparate himself into bed beside Draco and simply hold him.

a person if a wedding event's attire is something other than standard." — loosened his cravat — "I swear, you still look for ways to vex me on purpose." — and undid the top two buttons of his shirt. This left him in a white dress shirt, a deep red vest, and tuxedo slacks. It wasn't casual, by any means, but it would do. With a long-suffering sigh, he draped his discarded pieces over the stair bannister. They would be wrinkled by the time he returned; it was an absolute travesty, especially since he'd purchased the set specifically for this event.
Harry breathed slowly through his pressed lips. He hadn't even realized he'd been holding it in. Holding it inside so he didn't scream. Didn't cry. A whole life of this and he still wasn't fucking used to it.
"No…." Harry tilted his head enough to peek up at Ron out of one eye. "It was fucking fantastic."
"They can't be

to think otherwise. What he had in the past was just that. And it needed to stay there. As much as he had loved the last few days with Draco in his little escape world…. This was his home. And he couldn't leave that. He couldn't leave this man. Someone who cared about him and their child so unconditionally….

He loved Charlie.
With all of this on his mind, he had been comforted by the idea of seeing Ron and Hermione tonight. Of having a moment in his life that wasn't different and wasn't confusing. He'd received a copy of his article for the
Wincing at the sudden commanding shriek, Harry stepped back from the large door as it swung open. He was a few millimeters taller than Malfoy, but attempted to shield himself behind the other man anyway. The step difference helped. From around his barricade, Harry could just barely see a woman, looking as shrill as the manor itself, gazing down at Malfoy with a half-smile. Warm, yet quite aloof. "Morning, Mother," he greeted, but made no attempt to step closer.
It wasn't just that something was wrong with Teddy. Someone was hurting him. And there were far too many possibilities as to how. Draco was crawling in his skin just thinking about it.
And, of course, Harry was factored into every single one of her plans. He didn't have any of his own, hence the current stretch of unacceptable unemployment after a string of short-lived lame career ventures. Most recently, he had attempted the life of a barista…and quickly found he certainly wasn't cut out for the drama of it.
them. Not like this. This time saw him as an active participant. His hands were shaking, but he did slip them under Harry's nightshirt. He did reciprocate the desire to map out his lover's body. Whether that was a true desire or skilled acting, Harry wasn't entirely certain. But he didn't want to know. He just continued to run the warning not to question through his mind every other second.
"He's punishing me for considering his nan's suggestion."
Instead, Harry simply clarified, "What am I to you?"
"I like a man who knows what he wants," Potter laughed after another moment of silence. He wasted no extra time with concern or questions, eagerly walking back to the edge of the bed. With one hand, he pushed Draco back into the mattress. The other was far more adventurous, grasping his manhood and coaxing it to full realisation. Draco could have wept. He had been touched by so many before, but this was the first time it felt so right.
He most certainly wasn't ready for what actually happened. Charlie's entire countenance shifting after a long, steeling breath inward. His strong arms maneuvering Harry like it was nothing. Like he was weightless. Like they had practised this move a thousand times. In the astonished blink of the eye, Harry was straddling Charlie's legs and he was pulled into the deepest kiss this man had ever given him.
"F'ck noooooo!"
He hurried to the lift as best as he could with all of the attention surrounding him. All of the people stopping him to say 'good morning' and introduce themselves. To welcome him and enquire what he might have been doing there. Rumors already flying after Rita's article. Harry could only imagine how Draco's morning was going…. Perhaps that was why he had left so early - avoid most of the prying people.
Draco being the mess that he was, found that too easy of a promise to break.
With a sigh, Harry picked the letter back up and once again read it over. By the time he reached the last sentence, he'd drafted his reply in his head and allowed the words to flow freely onto a waiting page.
"Sorry, I should've just rung the bell…."
Harry had scrubbed his skin raw and still didn't feel clean. The dust had washed away just fine, but beneath that was a thin layer of unshakable unease. And seeing Draco calm as can be? Didn't help in the slightest.
All Harry could manage was a groan, his arms wrapping loosely around Draco's neck. He accepted the kiss without a contrary thought, the taste of himself on Draco's sinful tongue weirdly stirring a lazy fire in his belly.
Draco pulled the warrant from the breast pocket of his suit jacket. "Andrew McClain?" he asked, holding the paper out towards the stranger.
While she cleared her throat to fight back tears, Harry pointedly avoided meeting Hermione's gaze. One fucked up night brought them all of this. Life had become something none of them knew how to navigate any longer. Voldemort, Horcruxes, and killing curses all felt like small fires now. Everything before seemed easy in comparison to the way the world order felt now. It all sounded ridiculous running through Harry's head, but he couldn't quiet the invading thoughts. "Things will work themselves out," he tried to reassure, his tone not quite convincing to his own ears.
They were practically in the middle of beautiful nowhere by the time the delicate purr of the car ceased. To both sides of them was a forest of lush trees as far as the eye could see. They'd been driving down this road for quite some time, Harry watching the verdant green go by in a daze. And now that they were stopped…the trees seemed thicker than he had previously noticed. Enclosing this house in front of them in pure, unbreakable privacy.
With a shrug, Malfoy finally turned back around to face him. "You didn't ask for specifics," he stated. "You, rather stupidly, just entered into an agreement without knowing what was expected of you. Did you read the contract you signed yesterday? Of course you didn't…. But this
After a deep breath in and out, Harry recounted what Astoria had divulged to him the day before. It took him several long pauses and more nervous ticks than he could count to get it all out, but once every detail was finally clear between them, it felt like a massive weight had been lifted. Which would have been fantastic, he was sure, if he wasn't so sure that weight had been solidly planted upon Draco's shoulders instead. With every sentence he breathed, his partner's shoulders sagged just that much more.
Luna refilled her glass with a perfectly steady wand as she too consumed the note. "It's not terrible, Harry," she placated when she finished, followed by a deep gulp of her wine. "If you're intending it to be silly, that is."
I fought with this chapter for a long time. More specifically, I fought with Harry. He's being moody and stubborn and impossible. But I finally wrangled him! I hope you enjoy the new chapter and please be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts!
"It's just dinner," Harry reminded himself through gritted teeth, lining his toes up with the edge of the area rug before the fire. It wasn't a major step forward, but at least he'd gained a few centimetres. "Just like we do every single week. Just dinner…." He sighed. If it was
"Everyone knows where you live, Harry, it's not a secret." Draco, without bothering to ask, pushed past Harry into his flat and closed the door resolutely behind them. For a too-long second, he continued to stare before reaching out to tug on the beard himself with a restrained smile. "Guess I was right to be worried, wasn't I?"
After Ron and Hermione, Luna was the first person Harry wanted to come out to. If anyone ever made him want to be his real, authentic self, it was Luna Lovegood. She set an example he wanted to live up to every day of her life. Like right in that moment as she sat cross-legged on the paved bank of the Serpentine — she wore a bright yellow sundress with eggplant-coloured wellies, her long blonde waves pulled up into several-too-many knots around her head. In her outstretched palm was a smattering of nuts and seeds which she enthusiastically offered to any curious bird who fluttered by. She was an image straight out of a picture book and drew a few stares from passers-by. But she didn't care and Harry loved her for it.
as they were. They were so wrong they were
"Whoever said there was anything common about you?"
One day previous, Draco stayed longer than just the night. He stayed in bed with Harry, feeding one another breakfast. Complaining about the life he had run away to. Taking for granted what he should hold onto. And ultimately leaving without so much as a goodbye.
"I have it handled for the both of us," Malfoy insisted, fluttering his hand in the air like it was preposterous just to ask. "Your mother?"
"I may be…fake dating a guy for money," Harry said on a rush and winced, waiting for the recourse.
Draco looked around again, pushing Harry off towards a more secluded hallway. One much quieter and without a single soul in view. The invading thought of going a few steps further and hiding themselves away in a storage closet crossed Harry's mind but he shook it away. It wasn't the right time, as much as he was desperate to forget where he was for even just a moment.
". "I'm certain I could
"Sometimes us great and honorable folk like to be pampered bottoms, too," Potter laughed, leaning in for another breath-stealing kiss. "I take it since that's what you were expecting, though, you're on board?"
"You're really not angry?"
The inside of the house was just as cozy and well-maintained. Nothing immediately screamed 'murderer'. If anything, the floral upholstery and sensible cream-colored walls screamed 'boring'. The Patrol officers had set to their task of tearing everything apart, but Harry had a sneaking suspicion they wouldn't find anything.
. They were both laughing, the moving picture stuck in a loop of their happiness. Draco scanned the headline, too aware of the two leaning in for a kiss from the corner of his eye.
"I see the way you're looking at me. I should explain myself," Deacon hastened to add. "You see, we have a case that has crossed over your borders recently. A case we are particularly eager to wrap up as well as keep quiet. And, you see, Draco highly recommended you. You may want to warn your husband, Mr. Potter; I think he may have a bit of a crush on you."
"Those were life-saving dumplings! A man shouldn't be judged by the lengths he will go for good food. It's simply not fair."
The meeting concluded shortly after May's outburst of surprising comfort. Draco ensured every single one of his Embers made it safely onto the Knight Bus, bidding each of them a personal goodbye. Harry watched from the doorway of the centre, waving with a distracted pinch to his face. Rosetta had muttered that same quote to him another two times before she left, imprinting the words over any other thing he attempted to focus on.
"Draco, you're here! I missed you!"
The light that lit up in Draco's eyes was enough to seal Harry's already iron-clad vision of him. "You dress like you've never shopped from anything but an Argos catalogue. Your hair is an absolute mess. As far as first impressions go…you definitely know how to leave one. I'm honestly just surprised you even date men. How many men have you dated exactly?" He
Frowning, Teddy trailed off. He slowly lifted his gaze to meet Draco's. Taking in the mix of feelings playing upon his face. Nodding like he understood the confusion all too well. "It's happened since the first time. Since the Obliviation. No one else knows that. I'm almost certain…." He shrugged. "If I tell you the name, can you promise me no one else will get hurt?"
Malfoy didn't just sit in the opposite corner of the window seat. He folded in on himself and nearly became something different entirely. Like a child or…or, perhaps, just like a real person instead of a programmed robot. Between the two of them were a couple decorative pillows upholstered in soft blue corduroy and Malfoy pulled one into his lap. He hugged it so tight Harry could see his knuckles turning white.
…dirty rumors about where their money even comes from…."
To his credit, Draco did look like he had, at ten o'clock on a sunny Saturday morning, literally just peeled himself out of bed. He had a distinct caffeine-less look about him, still wore his pyjamas, and his hair was too-obviously un-coiffed. He even had a little pillow crease on his right cheekbone, which was entirely unfair because the last thing Harry wanted to do was dwell on Draco Malfoy's sinfully sharp cheekbones. Especially when those joggers of his didn't leave too much to the imagination. Not that Harry needed any imagination to know what — or, more importantly, what
"You may want to look away for this next part, Mr. Potter, if you're feeling queasy," the medical examiner – a petite woman named Mel who looked well-past the age for retirement – warned before pulling the sheet down to expose the girl's chest. "On the outside, she looks unharmed. But when you take a look inside…." There was a sick, squelching noise as she peeled back the Y-cut flesh.
"I should have chosen you when I had the chance."
of him at every goddamn second. But here, he only one who stopped to stare at him was Draco. And it wasn't really in wonder or amazement. He actually looked rather annoyed.
This boy was specifically created by the universe to make Draco shine. He was put on this earth to bring a smile no one else could elicit to that man's face. Scorpius was a miracle in a cherub's body.
"Well…some people care…." Potter scuffed the toe of his trainer against the ground. "Not that I'd rather they didn't care, but there are people who do. I still get fan mail, you know."
," Draco breathed when Potter's fingers delved that much further. When they popped the button of his trousers and when one fingernail traced the ridges of the zipper's length. The soft vibration pulled a keening noise from Draco's throat, his arms going tighter around Potter's neck. His fingers grasping at Potter's unruly mess of hair. His fingernails biting moons into the constellation of freckles across the back of Potter's neck.
is guilty, too."
"You see, that's top secret," Deacon said quickly.
Draco set his cup on the coffee table between them and pulled the small journal from the pocket of his peacoat. He found the entry easily, having obsessed over it enough in the past week to have worn a crease into the binding. Draco never actually had a problem remembering the dreams. He could recall most details with vivid clarity. But he indulged Cheryl's request to put them on paper because it was easier than explaining to her that he had been holding back from the one person who wanted to help him work through them. "I did write it down," he mumbled, extending the book out over the table.
Fighting his heavy eyelids, Harry ghosted his fingers over the knots and divots of Draco's spine. He revelled in the way Draco became pliant under him, in the way he trusted him enough to wholly and fully relax beside him. "That sounds mighty unhealthy, Malfoy," he teased, earning a lazy swat to his stomach.
in this house, Potter. Your mere existence and bizarre luck doesn't give you any sort of free pass here."
It wasn't until they were securely locked behind the door to their shared room that Malfoy chose to speak a word. Even when he did, his voice shook with what sounded like frustration, but could just as easily be read as fear or white-hot anger.
"Was this 'friend' the whistleblower that you threatened?"
Their ends came swiftly, Harry giving in to the crest of his orgasm first with Draco following him over that loud and messy edge on a string of punctuated profanities. On the high of it all, Harry couldn't truly fathom where his body started and Draco's ended, especially as they collapsed into a sticky, sweaty heap across the middle of the mattress. Their limbs tangled together and their panting breaths coming in unison.
"Let me," Potter gently commanded, his weight upon the mattress pulling Draco closer to where he matched his position. His fingers pushed Draco's out of the way, taking over the task until the stranger's chest was bared before him. "I couldn't stop thinking about this," he said in between each kiss he pressed across Draco's sternum. "I couldn't stop thinking about what having more of you would feel like…."
"Much to both of our parents' disapproval." Astoria's mask slipped again and she trained her eyes on her hands. They were wringing nervously in her lap, putting further on edge. "I'm not saying he's a bad person. Don't come back and twist my words on me – that is
As an adult, Harry definitely still enjoyed the Disney movies of his childhood and definitely rented the crap out of
Settling into the plush chair beside the boy's bed, Draco reached for his hand. Teddy eagerly gave it, squeezing back as hard as his little muscles would allow. "That's understandable. It's been a confusing night." Which was a massive understatement…. "Any questions you might have for me?"
"Harry? Did you hear me?
"This situation?" Malfoy questioned, only to be interrupted by a welcome and chaotic distraction.
After an embarrassing moment of fumbling, he finally managed to locate his round frames and mash them onto his face. With the clarity came understanding, accompanied by a wan smile.
"No," Theo answered quickly, the speed of his own tongue leaving him dizzy. He blinked a moment, pulling back. "No, I've never had sex."
Closing his eyes with a soft sigh, Harry resisted the urge to step back into the man's arms. "I've tried to ruin myself too many times to count. They never seem to let me…."
It was taking him ages to work up the courage.
"Scorpius was premature...because Draco pushed me while I was pregnant. I fell against a table.
If it had just been Luna's bridal bouquet of fern fronds and buds of St John's wort in his arms, Draco might have been delighted. He might have been amused. He might have been able to laugh this all off. But with his own carefully-selected arrangement tied to it by a torn strip of organza from her gown, all Draco could manage was feeling put on the spot.
Approaching cautiously, Draco settled a hand on the man's arm and gently guided him back towards the door. "I know you don't like to talk about it, Rudy. I'm sorry about this, but we have a few more questions about Andre."
if I've made you feel uncomfortable."
Astoria nodded. "He doesn't sleep well most nights, so we'll let him keep dreaming, shall we?" She tenderly brushed Draco's platinum-blond hair from his face and wriggled to make herself more comfortable beneath him.
Trains were the best and foam swords were the best and "Daddy,
When the gravity of Harry's feelings for men — the thing which broke through his solace and set him apart as
He just wanted this life.
"I'm so happy for them," Harry sighed. Draco looked at him over his shoulder and he did, indeed, look punch drunk on their love. "I want a love like that."
"Excuse me?"
Draco must not have loved it. There must have been something missing. Or he must have resented Harry for what he couldn't have himself. Why else would he ruin everything they had by turning back to dark magic?
Draco ended up pacing across the front of the small stage while Harry continued to set the chairs out. A quick cast of
"I'm looking for a new apartment," Harry said possibly too loud – eager to change the subject. "We'll be out of your hair soon. Promise."
of me to bring you flowers upon that flawed line of thinking." He unknotted the two bouquets before flailing the one he'd brought. "These flowers, not sure if you'd worked that out for yourself by now." He sighed and tossed both of them aside. "I should have left it all as a schoolboy crush and I…I
There were only two other people in the room and Harry instantly knew who they were.
The symbolism of that action wasn't lost on him. He was right back to where he had been a month ago — so ashamed and worrisome. Shutting everyone out because he was afraid. Hiding a part of himself away from the world because he couldn't handle the rejection. He hadn't changed one bit, not really. For a time, he had been able to handle it all because he had been able to control it. But, when it was once again out of his hands, he reverted back into the same shell of a person he had been before.
"Deep breath," Theo warned before pouring all of his concentration into disapparating. Well…most of his concentration. There were a few of his cells adamantly trained on Potter's hands and their secure location on his ass.
And Harry never wanted that afternoon to end.
"Oh, no no
The brunt of his well-deserved punishment and discomfort floated through the open master bedroom window. The noises were…vivid, to say the least. Harry was moaning and groaning and swearing on half-breaths. There was a swiftly-growing pit of jealousy in Draco's stomach. Harry was muttering his thanks to the gods and begging for more. He was mewling and grunting his praise. His voice was as Draco had never heard it – so vulnerable and soft. So broken. A mess of pieces he had never witnessed.
"Like…a real proper representation of our community. Do I need to look a certain way?
Harry could feel the room shift around them. The implication had been heavy in his voice and Charlie's unease was palpable. "Um…I hope it's okay that I ordered pizza. It's what Teddy asked for. And, you know," the bed creaked as he hastily stood, "I should get back. The delivery man could show up any moment."
He hadn't slept in four-going-on-five nights, afraid he would experience it all over again and again. Just as helpless to stop it this time as he had been a week ago.
Harry himself was purposefully settled into one corner of the plush window seat, the spot opposite of him vacant and waiting. He had gestured to it a few times when he'd managed to catch Malfoy's eye. He'd been waved off
surname?) wasn't until the next afternoon. Harry knew if he sat at home, he would go mad. Also he might actually have to tell Hermione of his latest bout of idiocy. And, besides, it really was high time he visited his parents again.
Brows knit together, Harry snuck a look at Malfoy from the corner of his eye. Gauging his reaction to the screaming and pleading and threatening. But he only appeared as cool and aloof as ever. His eyes were securely fixed upon the table, tracing the groove of a distinct grain with the pad of his finger. No one could have ever suspected him of being anything other than wholly disinterested in absolutely anything else.
"Fuck it," he muttered, icy grey eyes snapping open and locking onto Potter's. Staring at him relentlessly as he took slow, careful steps forward. Trying not to stumble. Trying to look sure. "It's my birthday," he stated, slipping carefully onto Potter's lap. His arms went around the man's neck, lips so sure this time when they caught Potter's. His hips so sure as they ground down. His hand so sure when it reached between them to massage Potter's obvious approval.
Draco looked damn good in a suit.
Draco snorted, secretly proud that they couldn't break him of this favorite phrase. "Fuck, yes. Daddy's tired. Daddy did…a lot of work this weekend…."
I know none of this is easy. Second
Startling at a knock to the bedroom door, Harry pushed the covers away. He slammed his eyes shut, feigning sleep once again.
"Lunch should be ready soon."
But he also didn't want her to inevitably see it and wonder why he hadn't told her first.
"Am I not fuckable?"
The telephone was in Harry's hand before he'd really even thought about it. He'd already typed in the digits listed at the end of the ad. All he needed now was to press 'call'. All he needed was to think past the rapid beating of his heart long enough to have a conversation with the person on the other end.
," Harry continued once his hand was securely fitted over Draco's mouth, "you're upset about something." The silver of Draco's eyes darkened as he narrowed them in silent response. "Are you going to tell me what that something is?"
Just as the sun was setting behind the horizon — the impossibly late hour of the Summer Solstice sunset only adding to the romanticism of it all — the bride and groom shared their first kiss as a married couple. Draco had to look at his shoes for fear of finally shedding the tears stuck in his throat.
"Fuck," he whispered, retraining his eyes on the window. Blinking away the moisture clouding his vision.
Mel shook her head. "I didn't get to examine any of the other bodies, but I have seen their reports. From those reports, I can confidently say that this is directly in-line with every single one of them. You're still looking for the same murderer, Mr. Malfoy."
Short and uneventful chapter - sorry. More interesting drama coming, I promise!
— Draco!" on a groan dripping with reckless abandon, matched so perfectly with the protest of the mattress springs and the slamming of the bedframe against the wall.
Cheryl nodded as if everything made perfect sense to her. "The erotic dreams?"
"Then…what?" Draco pressed, frowning.
"Why is the ice cream a secret?"
Harry was far smarter than he appeared. It wasn't good for him. Draco winced at the question and averted his eyes. His fingers loosened on the belt loops, but Harry didn't step away this time. He stayed close against the bars, his face far softer. His expression far more lenient and full of sudden understanding. "I can't answer that."
It was quite easy, at that moment, to say Harry's first impression of this woman was that he hated her. She was every evil queen presented in a tidy, poised package.
And he sure didn't like it now.
When the meeting finally ended, Harry had all but made up his mind on never attending another one. His confusion didn't belong in a place so full of valid tragedy. And it really wasn't fair to any of the other attendees for him to sit there admiring how stubble accentuated Draco's jawline instead of actively listening to them or offering validation.
even is — there's something we need to discuss."
"My dad was in Gryffindor."
Maybe Draco was right.
"Nooo," Astoria whined, barreling back against Draco on a misstep. "I'm not ready for bed. I'm wide awake!" The slur to her tongue unveiled that lie pretty clearly.
Draco didn't need to read the words on the page before him, but it helped to have something to focus on besides his own quavering voice.
, perhaps you should explain to your mother just why I shouldn't be cooking?"
Harry knew what type of dirty look Ron was giving Draco before he even caught glimpse of it. He'd been on the receiving end of that glare a few times and knew it wasn't something to trifle with. "Yeah, he's upstairs," he rushed to say and ushered him out with an apologetic smile back to Hermione. Who, of course, smiled back with too much patience and tasked herself with scolding her husband. "We converted the old meeting room into a temporary bedroom. It's easier on him when he has the strength to get out of bed…."
"No...I took some personal time." Harry sloughed off his jacket, comfortable in the toasty warmth from the fireplace. "I thought we could spend the afternoon together."
"Just go get your ex and leave," Shea muttered, ducking further towards his breakfast. And taking another large swallow of his wine.
Since he couldn't determine whether this was a good or a bad thing, Harry simply made a noise of acknowledgement. Truthfully, he felt like he could sleep for another half a day. He was exhausted — the all-encompassing type of exhaustion where he felt it in his bones, his mind, his
Frowning, Charlie set aside his mug and leaned forward. "What's happened with Teddy?" he asked on a shuddery whisper.
No, it was best to get his phone call over with and simply retire as planned. As heavy as his eyelids felt….
"It was," Harry chuckled, hoping that would help keep things light. "Was there…," he trailed off, almost too afraid to continue. The night had been so good up until that dangerous tipping point. He cleared his throat and trudged on. "Was there a reason you were aggressively baking a cake so far out of your depth?"
"No, we can't," Harry groaned. "He said those words, verbatim, to me last night."
The effect with the face he wore now, however, was clearly not as strong. Potter's widening grin clearly spoke to this, as did his low and pitying laugh. "I think I would, too," Potter said gently, soothing the flare of hurt in Draco's belly just enough. "As long as that
Draco's cheeks darkened. "I, er…I disabled them."
there. Staring. His brow was furrowed and Draco could almost see the gears physically turning in his brain. He imagined Harry trying to put it all together — every lingering look or too-familiar compliment. Every dropped hint or nearly-intimate moment.
Harry nodded. He wanted to argue that this didn't mean his childhood was perfect or without pain, but held his tongue.
He felt like a coward.
…stop asking." In a nervous twitch, he ran his fingers through his hair. Again. On a normal day it was a mess, but right now he could be considered mental by image alone. "I'm just glad Draco was there. Otherwise…."
had caused Draco to sound like that in the entire span of their relationship.
Teddy nodded and the floodgates crashed open. "I promised not to say anything…. I'm not supposed to know. The memories…." His voice died on a squeaky sob. The meaning carried through painfully well on his tormented expression. "I'm not supposed to know…."
Guilt and shame
Not knowing any better, Narcissa still thought he went prowling on these nights he didn't come home. He could never fathom correcting her with the truth. "I promise to be home in a few hours. There's just something I need to take care of."
True to his word, Harry did eat a healthy helping of wontons — but only after Draco admitted he was stuffed and pushed them in his direction with a good-spirited smirk. Although he was close to bursting himself, Harry put them away like it was nothing to keep the joke alive.
Draco fully succumbed to the idea of flopping back on the mattress. "I'm going to let the stereotyping pass, simply because I know you're trying to help."
And then, of course, there was Draco. Draco, who had always tried to be that perfect pure-blood son — the proof of which was permanently etched into his forearm. Draco, who appeared to be the solid rock for all of these people, regardless of who they were or what they had done. Draco, who accepted their burden as if it were his own, giving them meals and a place to stay and who promised to write scathing letters on their behalf even while his own problems sat unsolved.
Potter responded with vigor, pumping in and out of Draco with the full strength of every muscle. He was a man on a mission, delighting in every moan he wrenched from Draco's throat. He was literally beaming, taking every second he could to press his lips or teeth into some yet untouched section of skin. He praised the arch of Draco's spine and his willingness to take whatever he was given. And, most importantly, he fucked like a goddamn champion. There was no future here where Draco was walking away unsatisfied for the night.
It was going to happen. It was bound to. The boundaries were only there to be broken. They were fooling themselves to think otherwise. But not like this.
They were sickeningly in love, and Draco found himself growing increasingly cynical at the sight of them. He was glad their vows, full of herbology puns and wispy poetry, were short — especially with Harry sitting beside him the entire time, smiling like a damned fool. It was obvious he was proud of his friends, which was sweet. But the longer they sat there, watching something so bloody beautiful, the more Draco found himself dreaming of his own future. There wasn't a single scenario he could imagine where this man beside him wasn't an integral part of it.
Potter's house on Grimmauld Place existed in its own private corner of the world. Draco knew from his mother that it was a residence passed down through the Black family, rendered Unplottable and guarded with every security measure known possible. Potter had acquired it following the passing of his godfather (even though it rightfully should have reverted back to the Black family name…) and had occupied it since the end of the war.
Draco sighed and shrugged, like he had been doing in response to every plan Shea had tried to concoct as a solution. "Or…as I've said since last night, you could just talk to him. Harry is extremely oblivious so I would suggest a direct approach. Don't try and play mind games with him. You'll only end up disappointed."
"Certainly not."
If this were so easy, Draco would have done it months ago. Right now he was wishing he had. Perhaps then they wouldn't be in this mess. "I can't…," he said to the floor. "I can't tell you…why I had those things. And I can't tell you whose they are. I can't tell you anything…."
He had seen a ghost where none existed.
"Don't be ridiculous," Draco fired back without missing a single beat. He didn't even look over at Harry, like he wasn't even stunned by his attempt to bow out graciously. "Everyone botches something during their first big case. You're not all that special."
"That all depends on you, really. If you're as smart as you say you might be, we could be done within a few hours." Malfoy smirked, turning just enough for Harry to see it. "Prove me wrong, Potter."
…he could see why Potter had wanted this man.
Holding his jaw tightly, Draco nodded and seemingly gave up on dressing altogether. He'd made it back into his trousers and two buttons into his shirt, which was definitely a decent accomplishment. He closed his eyes and just breathed in and out for a spell before finally gritting out, "Just trying not to let it back up. Already puked up everything from last night, so my stomach's just…churning." He wrinkled his nose and swallowed hard and Harry felt guilty for having helped him into this state.
Standing once again, Draco crossed the cell. Settled up against the bars and layered his hands over Harry's. "I can't think of a time in my life that I have ever been as happy as I was in those two days," Draco whispered.
into the cushions — and the shrill anticipatory gasps from Harry and Astoria both — he remained dead asleep. Harry watched a few quiet seconds just to be sure, and when he found himself satisfied Draco wouldn't wake, he gently rose from the carpet and looked towards the door. "Well, I s'pose…we should take his hint and head off to bed ourselves, yeah?"
Vaguely, he remembered Draco's office having a window. And he was literally itching for a cigarette, the need for nicotine causing him to worry the skin from his bottom lip. He slipped into the small room, rushing to crack the window with a lit cigarette already dangling from his mouth.
Luna leaned in closer, patting his hand. "Your flowers speak words too quiet for him to hear," she pressed, brow rising. "Harry requires a statement to be made at a much higher decibel in order to process it." Someone on the other side of the fire called her name, and she craned her neck to try and see who. "I'm sorry, Draco; I have to go. Promise me something, though?" She waited for him to nod before standing and leaning closer to whisper in his ear, sending a chill down his spine. "Don't give up on him. Not just yet." She kissed his cheek before leaving him alone once again.
Even just a glimpse of that thought caused a smattering of red splotches to canvas his alabaster cheeks. "Thank you for letting me know. I-I still have some prepping and digging to do before I can interrogate him. I just want to be prepared. Let them know I'll try my best to be down before the end of the day."
"Is it too late to negotiate our terms here?" Harry asked, his own voice sounding muffled and foreign to him. It was the only thing he could think to say while his mind felt so dangerously overwhelmed.
Harry's knuckle had hit the table straight-on and now it felt like every nerve up his arm was buzzing and Malfoy was gripping his fingers so tight and every particle of the air was drenched in ugly silence save for the
The only indication that Deacon was the least bit startled was that his eyes were round as saucers. Otherwise, he remained absolutely cool, calm, and collected. "Fine," he hissed, rifling through his own set of the case files. "There was one father, a single parent you see, I couldn't get enough information out of on my first interrogation. Ask him your questions. See if it can get you anywhere new." He threw the file across the desk, the papers spilling and floating to the floor in a slow cascade. "Draco, go with him. Keep him out of trouble."
out now, I should be setting a better example, right? Given my public status and all that Thestralshit."
Harry Potter was asking Draco Malfoy for permission to
Every word Harry spat seemed to cause a darker and darker cloud to form over Draco's previously jovial face. By the time he finally shut up, those things he didn't mean still heavy on his tongue, it was too late. Draco had taken more steps away, looking ready to run."
Returning that still obviously visible grin, Draco leaned in. "Harry James Potter, you know better than literally anyone just how much I love it." He paused, head tilting to the side coyly before adding, "And you."
"I may have lied all those times before," Draco managed to croak past the layer of sticky coating his throat. He smacked his tongue, a secret smile playing at the corner of his mouth. "

That unfiltered sunlight should have been a wake-up call, but it only served to make matters worse. His anxiety only heightened without the protection of that month specifically dedicated to being proud of who he was. If he'd felt exposed before, that feeling was only ten times worse now.

He couldn't quite imagine a week of this man and his likely horrid family yet. But he was starting to feel like he might be able to. It was going to be pure torture.
Anywho, without further ado - the newest chapter! Please leave a comment with your thoughts, I always love to hear them!
Harry paused just for a steeling second outside of his parents' bedroom door. It wasn't right, but he always had to brace himself before dealing with his mother. He just never knew what he was walking into anymore. Maybe he should have asked his father how things were that day. Given himself a bit of a head start.
"I don't think so." There was that heart-stopping smirk again. "Are you?"
"I had a meeting earlier outside of the Ministry; I saw him apparate in as I was headed out," Hermione said as soon as he was gone. She looked over her shoulder at him, brow raised. Like she was waiting for a ball to drop. "What did he want with you?"
Deacon's a real catch."
Teddy shrugged, flipping it back over and scanning the article for himself. "It was in the kitchen with a note from Uncle Draco's mum. I didn't read the note."
"Of course," she breathed and finally set the paper down between them. "It's just, a few weeks ago you were hardly ready to even tell Ron and me. I just need to be sure you're not being used for someone else's gain here. Maybe Malfoy's in a better place now, but he doesn't have a very innocent track record…."
' right, you need to be authentic. That's the whole of it. Be you because you'll never quite fit in someone else's shoes. As for the rest of it? There's no set number of ways to be queer in any respect.
"No," Draco interrupted once again, "I rather prefer
"And the healers found traces of Obliviation. And…there was some…." Draco breathed heavily through his teeth. "I don't know how to say this, Harry…."
Draco did the work for him. He closed the distance and enveloped the man in his warm hold. He kissed him just behind the ear and whispered his apology. Like those gentle touches and sincere words could fix anything and everything. And perhaps they could.
right for each other?"
"Your boss is a dick," Harry snapped the instant they landed in an alley beside the listed address.
"I think I forgot to put something in. Treacle? I can't remember if the recipe wanted treacle…."
Harry was lost.
But all he really felt was in complete and total awe. And…perhaps, a bit turned on….
It felt like Harry needed to take advantage of every single sensation because who knew when he would feel them this way again.
He knew exactly what Draco was saying. He didn't need to stop his internal crisis to listen to him clarify it.
this time. He pulled back first, gently tugging Draco into an embrace of headier intentions. His hands were up Draco's shirt before Draco's had even begun to make their way round to his backside. He had been the one to suggest they move things to the bedroom, stumbling back down the hall. And now, as a result of his own actions, they were kneeling in front of one another on Draco's bed — each of them panting and gasping and clearly on the precipice of something truly meaningful.
"You can worry about all that in the morning," Harry muttered to himself, biting his lip in one last moment of hesitation before finally relenting and crawling atop the mattress. As he'd planned, he curled up close to Draco, remaining face to face. Watching him breathe in and out steadily, the rhythm of it lulling him into a relaxed stupor.
"I've already got a Harry on the list... Surname?"
Harry's jaw snapped closed, the mood promptly killed. "Fuck you," he hissed and ripped his shirt from Draco's hands, smoothing it back down over his stomach.
"Dinner is, of course, going to be very formal. However, you should dress in…." Malfoy looked him up and down, taking in Harry's basic t-shirt and jeans. He was back in full maniacal focus. "Just stay in that; it's perfect. Not that you probably have any options which would be fitting, but this very clearly says you don't give a single fuck."
His eyes scouring their surroundings with something like embarrassment, Draco rushed to shush him. "
Day in and day out for near a week, Draco had been making these same excuses. He was being a coward. He was being slimy. He was avoiding dealing with what was now reality, holed up in this office that smelt like stale cigarettes and the undertone of Harry's cheap cologne. He really should have gotten the whole ordeal over with by now. He shouldn't have put it off. The waiting was killing him and so was this cramped, little room overloading his senses. But he couldn't make himself face that man again. He couldn't force himself to walk just down the hall and confront the monster he had lured right into the best parts of his life.
"It's the right house," Draco said softly, taking off his suit jacket and tie, stashing them inside of the mailbox. Relaxing even further, he untucked the faded green shirt he wore, undoing the top two buttons, and took his shoulder-length hair from its tie. "The first time we were here, he wouldn't let us in for about an hour because we looked like Mormons. You'll need to dress down, as well." He waited until Harry had done the same before heading up the cement path overtaken with weeds.
Of course, it all had to end eventually, just as all good things do. Deep down in the most carnal parts of himself, Harry knew he wanted more. He would happily rut into this man — feeling every inch of him answering in a glorious return of passion until they were both spent — if not for the subtle alarm bell ringing in the back of his mind. A warning, really, telling him he simply wasn't ready. That this was a milestone and he wanted to remember it all fondly, without a single hint of regret. He wanted this passion, but he wanted it delicately placed somewhere down the line.
"So…what I want to do for you, Draco…is to set you free."
His head in the clouds, Draco led Potter back towards one of these doors. He chose one still marked '
Malfoy nodded, jotting it down. "Lucius; also my father's name. And your mother?"
. As in a psychological need to be (ful)filled by the most basic and carnal act of sex with another red-blooded human being.
Kingsley nodded, smiled, and stepped past Harry only to pause and turn back. He grasped Harry's shoulder gently, pausing briefly before softly intoning, "Harry, I feel the need to clarify that I would not be an appropriate dating candidate for you."
deserve for him to be bitter about her happiness. He pushed the wine glass away, grabbing instead for his discarded bouquet of flowers. By now, he'd carried them for a good few hours. The warmth of the day had wilted their poor petals and a lack of moisture had them looking visibly parched. They looked the way he felt inside — discouraged. "Here, I brought these for the two of you. Hopefully, Longbottom knows a few tricks for their recovery."
"Is this you trying to rationalise whether I'm worth an explanation, or…?"
story. He placed the darkest one in front of James, squeezing his dad's shoulder on his way past with the other two. "You can't afford to lose the house."
because they had both decided it reached the widest audience. But it had, indeed, been Draco who suggested he do it in the first place. He'd said Harry's celebrity status would help the centre best. Harry had been eager to impress Draco, but he hadn't needed that much convincing. He was
it. The man's sigh was abrupt and his tone was short. Like he was trying to restrain himself. "He's not in yet. He took the new assistant to breakfast. It's his tradition for the first day." Trying and failing.
"Tomorrow?"
Draco was going to give up. But if he gave up, Teddy couldn't tell the truth.
Harry looked fragile again. It was easy to see, even just in the way he walked. He was holding himself close and tight, like he had to police every limb. Once this case was over, Draco never wanted to see him like this again. As much as he might think this was what the universe wanted for him, Harry Potter wasn't cut out to be an Auror. He had just been a boy caught up in the simple matter of circumstance.
Luna smiled softly, tilting her head. If Draco's cheeks were as rosy as they felt, she would easily be able to clock his buzz. "Neville grew the elderberries himself," she said, draping herself into the chair beside him, carelessly wrinkling the fabric of her dress. She crossed her legs, revealing her neon-yellow jelly sandals. She was so distinctly herself and Draco couldn't deny he loved her for it. "We were picking them last summer when he proposed. We made love along the riverbank amongst the bushes; it was beautiful."
"Oh." Draco relaxed once more, rolling his eyes with a soft snorting noise. "Suppose you'll make me put it into words, then?" He tilted his eyes to try and meet Harry's gaze. When Harry pointedly kept staring at the floor, he sighed heavily and pressed his forehead into the back of his hands, pushing Harry's knuckles into the metal of the chair.
That was a fact plainly stated over frosty mugs at midnight.
"I'm bored."
"You warned me not to disclose illegal activity…."
Draco might have known the number of people Potter had taken home, but he wasn't about to admit that. That would take this conversation from playful to creepy all-too-fast. "I think I would prefer to focus on just one," he muttered, looking up through his eyelashes. It was a seductive look he had mastered while wearing his own more delicate face.
Harry truly and wholly had never felt like he did when he was around Draco. He was never as whole or complete as when he was by his boyfriend's side. And that feeling in the pit of his stomach when he simply thought the word "boyfriend"? It was like a cross between the wholeness of home and the fluttering of a thousand soft butterfly wings.
Malfoy merely scoffed and led them up the drive. The gate sat halfway up but by the time they reached it, it was already swinging open for them. The hedges never broke the entire way to the house and the chill down Harry's spine never dissipated. It became especially unbearable once they reached the front door – massive and reminiscent of the one the villagers ram down to attack the Beast – and Malfoy muttered in a hollow, haunting voice, "Welcome to Malfoy Manor…."
Blood.
"And what would make you think I was lying?" Harry countered, frustrated at his betraying, squeaky voice.
and wasn't about to shy away from getting it.
Harry could feel the intensity with which they were both staring at him. He was uncomfortable, so he was prattling on. Neither of them cared much about these details. But if he kept talking about the boring stuff, he could keep himself calm. And it kept him from having to speak the hard truth.
Even so, he couldn't help but to feel like he was missing out.
It was, of course, wrong to do so, but Harry couldn't hold back the startled frown. "You're sure?" Not once since they had started dating had Charlie even mentioned the possibility of leaving Romania. Harry had never felt it was fair to ask him to, either. And yet, here he was, ready and willing to drop the thing he was most passionate about. Most likely for Harry specifically. And for them as a couple. And for them as a family. It was laudable, as much as it soured his stomach.
James was patient, but there was definitely a sigh waiting just behind his lips when he asked, "Do I really have to come right out and demand to know where you got the money? Did you rob a bank or…or are you standing on dark street corners…? I know you love
"Step. Back." Draco's own tone was the epitome of nervous. It wavered, betraying his fear. His slight lack of confidence. All he could see, almost literally, was the unstoppered vial between the man's translucent fingers.
Charlie being home for good meant no more stolen weekends. No sneaking around in complete comfort. No more lazy afternoons of Draco sprawled out in his bed, begging to be fucked.
Writing this chapter absolutely kicked my ass.... I have most of what happens next already planned out but this was severely getting in the way. But it's done now! Please be sure to leave a comment with what you thought of this chapter! Love you all!
Nodding slowly, Harry stood from his chair. He was making his way to the door without even thinking about it. "Just…give me a minute, please. I need to speak with Draco before I fully agree. Excuse me." He blew a hasty puff of smoke, stubbing his cigarette out on the back of the door.
"Thanks," Malfoy said and shook Harry's hand without missing a single beat, which really wasn't fair considering the way Harry's head spun.
"I want to be what you want."
"Plagued?" When Malfoy sat up, he looked weary even past the situation at hand or the muscle ache from their romp. The longer Harry assessed him, the worse off he appeared. There were bags beneath his eyes which couldn't possibly be fixed by just one night of sleep. Ill-fitting clothing aside, he wore his body like it was too heavy. And Harry had done this to him.
"Which one?"
"No, I'm afraid I'm actually here for the job instead of as a friend today."
Harry would never be able to look into those eyes the same way again. He wasn't certain he
Malfoy didn't come to Harry's rescue. He just left him to try and defend his presence on his own. Like a rotting fish on a pristine beach. Perhaps it was payback for calling him out the day previous. Or maybe he was just that much of an asshole. A game Harry could play, as well. Or…die by the sting of a thousand wasps just trying. After all, he was being paid for his acting. Why not make the most of it?
The lust-blasted hue to the silver of his eyes.
It was on that mix of too much beer and an indulgent amount of fried wontons that Harry found himself sated and relaxed. Under this pliancy, his tongue felt loose and carefree — finally making him brave enough to voice some of the concerns roosted in his worrisome mind. "So," he began on a slur, "since I'm, like,
How was Harry expected to even
The last thing Harry wanted was to come right out and say the thing he had been worrying himself sick over. If he invited that word into this conversation, it wouldn't leave, and he didn't want that on his hands. So, he thought back to the rest of what Draco had confessed to his "sleeping" form that night, drawing on the barest hint of his panic. "Do you really think I'm sickeningly naïve?"
Harry told himself it was a friendship.
Harry hummed his agreement, finally able to put a name to the feeling of hope filling him.
"And has a son," Harry interjected with much less confidence. "Teddy — he's only two."
words. On what he really meant.
Typical. It was just absolutely bloody typical that Draco Malfoy would do something terrible to Harry Potter and still be forgiven. Not that Potter knew it was him, but still. The man was too trusting. He was too soft. How was he still
"I think it's a bit late for that," Harry muttered, not an ounce of sympathy in his tone.
"How would I know? I haven't left this flat since the article dropped." Harry was grinning, hollow and flat.
"Harry? Darling? Are you still asleep?" Harry shifted just barely, giving a non-committal groan. "Andromeda's just dropped Teddy off. Didn't know if maybe you'd like to come down for dinner?" He felt a pressure dip near the other side of the bed, but made no move in response. "If you're too tired, I understand. It's just…I'm only here for the night, Harry. I would like to spend some time with you."
In a very childish display, Harry slunk down the skewed part of the mattress and fell into a heap on the floor. He curled his knees to his chest and let loose a loud groan. The King echoed back a pathetic mewl from his perch. For some reason, that sealed it for him. He was going to be an adult and go back to the Ministry. Not for Draco, but for the damn cat.
morning. This could have been one of those mornings where they hadn't gone to bed angry. This could have been a morning where they basked in the glow of one another instead of hashing out the things Harry had slurred and shouted in his state of inebriation.
Harry's friends had never been anything but kind and honest with him. He knew it was ridiculous to fear their reaction. They might end up being surprised, but he couldn't imagine them reacting unkindly. It was just that they, like everyone else, already had a solid perception of him. This one little, almost insignificant thing about him could change everything about the way they acted towards him.
"And why would they be worried about that?" Harry snapped. He felt like he couldn't breathe. Like something vital to him was being taken away. Again that monitoring haze shifted orange, inching towards red with every gasp he pulled.
to have been something they could have done differently.
For a moment, Harry waited and thought. He didn't know much...and what he did know was vague. It was starting to appear like he didn't really know anything at all. "It was an arranged marriage and the two of you grew apart. Or never clicked in the first place? Scorpius was only a few months old when you filed for divorce."
to be a good sign. They wouldn't hurry for a corpse. Would they?
did. You killed Voldemort." Harry winced — it still felt wrong after these few years to be known for greatness gained by having murdered someone…even if that someone was hardly human by the end. "And you saved many lives, including Draco's. It's something you should be proud of."
