“The removal men could have put them in their respective rooms. I don’t understand why you want to carry everything yourself,” Draco said.
Harry wanted to object, but sneaking up the Eiffel Tower at night didn't seem like a bad idea at all.
This kiss was different from the first. Mostly because it didn't take Harry as off guard. Possibly because this time his drunken state allowed him to not question why he raised his hands and buried them in Malfoy's hair, pulling him lower. Why he met the questing tongue with his own and explored the hot mouth he was offered.
"Are you serious?" Harry asked when they met up the following Friday. They were on their way up into the sky in a tiny plane. Skydiving, the Muggles called this.
Harry grunted and Draco looked down to see Tom pull on a condom and slick up his cock, three fingers still buried in Harry's ass.
“So yes, it’s him,” Draco said finally when he’d had a few sips of wine. “He’s still an arrogant ass, as you can see. And not the least bit sorry.”
Harry thought about that conversation a lot over the next two weeks as he sat at his desk, picking apart each case he was assigned.
Draco sighed and looked at him. Sometimes he missed the days when Harry had fidgeted with his sleeves, too nervous around Draco to not stammer or spit out his drink. The vacant expression when Harry just stared at him like he couldn’t believe his luck.
"Break-in at Gringotts, Potter," Williamson mumbled next to him. "We've got an alarm for every big institution. When it sounds scraping like that - it's Gringotts alerting us."
Tom’s voice was lower now. Draco had forgotten how good a dirty talk he was. While Harry was good at sex itself and ready to try most everything, he was very quiet. Tom could drive someone insane without touching a single part of their body.
"Malfoy Jr was banned from accessing his family vault at his trial," Roberts said. Below the counter, he fisted his hands. "That's what the Wizengamot ordered. How come you just let him walk in?"
Draco was almost surprised when he finally climaxed. His entire body shook, and he buried his hands in Harry's hair, pulling him further, so he swallowed every last drop of his come.
Ron grabbed his arm. Harry noticed that many of the present people still eyed him in interest. And Dean was standing right there next to them.
Tom was still as handsome as Draco remembered. Now he had to be in his mid-thirties, but there was no grey hair in sight. To think it had been seven years already since his twentieth birthday party.
“Why don’t you walk there now, Draco? Touch the tiles, have a better idea of the scene. Describe what he looks like when the wet water runs down his chest.”
But then there was this complete calm Draco felt when he was with him now. This certainty that they were a team, and could talk about anything. And that Harry wasn’t insecure in their relationship.
Harry had no idea what he would want to say, anyway, should they 'accidentally' run into each other again. Malfoy had been drunk and high on Felix, he hadn't been a master of his senses.
"Well, of course not. You are Saint Potter." Malfoy's face contorted, but then he just sighed and leaned back, closing his eyes. "Some people duplicate Muggle money and exchange it back to galleons and thereby cheat the currency. Others hex the Muggle brokers, so they get mortgages for free. Why do you think most wizards and witches are wealthy, even with our small society? Economically it shouldn't be possible."
Harry found his prostrate instantly and then started rubbing there like his life depend on it. Draco's eyes rolled back and he looked up to the ceiling as he lost himself in the pleasure, the waves of sensation that came over him, and he finally grabbed his own cock and started wanking.
Harry grimaced. He was thankful Ron was talking to him. When he'd seen Ginny's betrayed face, he'd thought he'd ripped his relationship with all the Weasleys to shreds.
“And you tease him further. Push another finger in and twist them until you find his sweet spot. He says nothing, just lets his head fall back in pure bliss. His eyes are closed. He’s just rocking back onto your fingers and you see them disappear into his warm, tight heat again and again. ‘Draco,’ he says. ‘Please, honey. I need you inside of me.’ And that when you cannot take it anymore. You pull all your fingers out at once and fuck into him, in one fast push. He makes a noise which sounds like a gurgle.”
"It's lovely to have you here, Harry. Even if it isn't for long. Nymphadora and I really got on each other's nerves over long periods. But it will be good for Teddy to have you here." She stood in the door to Tonks’ room, which was now Harry's, and looked at him unpacking.
"It’s okay that you have your little plans. Come on. Tell me. You didn't come to Hogwarts at random." Draco was biting his pink lips, his eyes downcast, trembling slightly from the cold. He was fiddling with his wand. Then he inhaled deeply, meeting Harry's eyes.
Draco looked over in the direction Tom had pointed where a smaller but not less majestic house stood. He could see a black limousine, one door in the back still open, parking close by.
He heard Malfoy catch his breath. But he was so determined that Harry didn't want to offer walking by himself again. When they reached the second deck, Malfoy nearly fell, as he went to the ground. Harry quickly stepped aside.
With a steady motion, he lifted his hands and cupped Draco's face. He pushed himself to the tips of his toes, so their breath mingled.
Harry heard a figurative gong go off in his head. This was the moment to confess his odd encounters with Draco. The thing was, Harry had no idea where to even start that talk.
"Very good, Potter," Tom said. "Now both of you stay. You make a very appealing picture." Tom sped up, and the slapping of flesh on flesh echoed in their living room. Draco could see their reflection in the windows. They looked positively indecent. Harry spread between them like a fuckdoll, as Tom's steady rhythm shook him forward every time.
“I don’t know,” he said. “He’s great fun in bed - although a total control freak. He also doesn’t bottom.” There was silence. “Unless that has changed in the last years, which would certainly be worth discovering. And he likes his stable, reliable arrangements.”
"And if it isn't Harry Potter. Twice in one day even – how lucky!" Harry startled. He met Malfoy's eyes, who had his chin resting on his fist, merely looking at him. Harry should have thought this entire surveillance operation through more.
But Harry still kept coming into work every day. He sat there until late at night, and kept scribbling, kept tracking. Kept sleeping in his transfigured office chair. But it was like the light outside got a little dimmer every day.
Harry was just leaving on Friday evening to head to Andromeda's to babysit. The sisters wanted to go see a musical together.
"Wonderful," Tom said, and got his tie from his pile of clothes, and slid it loosely around Harry's neck. Draco reached forward and brushed aside Harry's hair, asking him with his eyes whether this was okay. Harry just smiled at him and lowered his head to lick at Draco's cock. Draco saw how Tom pulled the tie tight so that it looked like he had Harry on a leash.
The new dealer came, and Harry had to step back. Malfoy winked at him and returned to his game. Harry only watched from a distance as Malfoy won round after round until finally more and more of his opponents gave up and disappeared from the table.
Malfoy opened his eyes and turned to Harry. "Just – just destroying a few objects the Dark Lord gave us for safekeeping. They – they were dark – the kind of dark magic that eats away on itself and then becomes something twisted and uncontrolled. And I didn't like the idea of those cups sitting around in the vault for the foreseeable future. I tried to get a permit, you know? To dispose of them, but they wouldn't let me.
, Harry thought. He knew this mood. It made sense with the winning streak. He gritted his teeth together and followed, changing his clothes back to the plain jeans and t-shirt he'd had on before.
Draco sneered at that, then looked at Harry. "I – I'll leave you to it then, Potter,” he said. “Since your letter’s requirements are fulfilled." His lips twitched like he tried a smile but gave up halfway. Without even stepping into the shop, Draco turned around and walked off down the street.
“I don’t - ” Draco bit out and pressed the card into Harry’s hands who looked at him confused. Then his gaze cleared.
Harry met Mrs Malfoy's widened eyes. Malfoy had been out cold for an entire day at St. Mungos before signing himself out. Had he not told her? Well, Harry wasn't kind enough to keep this secret for him.
Two weeks later, Harry thought he had finally managed to push Malfoy's pink lips so far from his mind that they weren't a steady terror haunting his days. He'd actively prevented himself from picking up the map, tracing Malfoy's dot with his eyes, watching the little footsteps as they paced around his home.
Harry rolled his eyes and pushed passed him, knocking his shoulder. Savage could just fucking come out and say what his goddamn problem was. Otherwise, Harry would not waste any more breath on him.
“Tell me how round his ass cheeks are, how large his cock is. I’ve just gotten myself a bit of privacy. You called at the right time.”
He awoke early on the 31st of October and grabbed his invisibility cloak. He knew there would be some paparazzi lurking in Godric's Hollow, and he didn't want any pictures of this in the Prophet.
or the Killing Curse. I know all her deepest and darkest thoughts. I knew when she struggled, and when she despised herself."
So they were doing this, then. Draco opened up his trousers and left them on the floor in his atelier, as he walked over to the bathroom in nothing but underpants and one of Harry’s white shirts.
Draco lounged on the sofa when Harry finally emerged from the bedroom on Thursday night. They'd just finished dinner and Draco watched how the evening light slowly disappeared behind the garden fence. He smiled at Harry, stealing a quick kiss, trailing his hand over Harry’s naked back.
"We've been over this, Draco. Please – please don't try to reverse time and pretend we never had fun together."
When Harry stepped out on Diagon Alley, Draco was nowhere in sight. His only guess was that he had either disapparated or gone back to the car. When Harry entered the Leaky, he walked straight over to Tom.
"It totally is, mate. What did he do? Are they investigating him because of the Gringotts thing, now?" Harry blinked.
Harry tried very hard not to feel the same way he had when trusting his life to an aeroplane and a parachute.
"But whyever not?" Malfoy said. His voice was still as snotty as Harry remembered. "It's not for personal use. There is just quite the magical infestation in the cellars at the Manor. If you don't invest properly in cleaning that, it will fall apart under your nose. Think of the people who want to live there."
"I used to spend all my holidays in France when I was younger. Mostly down at the Mediterranean. But also here in Paris. I don't – " he exhaled. "I have a strong need to say goodbye to things at the moment. And I needed to come here to say goodbye to family holidays and the Malfoy ancestry."
Wheezes was by far the most impressively decorated house. A whole army of pumpkins was lined up behind the shop windows, and there were illusion spells in place that made the house seem to stand in the centre of thick fog. It was already packed with people, as they arrived fashionably late. Harry was greeted with loud yells, a few people coming over to clap him on the shoulder.
help you." Malfoy sighed profoundly and then startled as he saw Harry standing only a few feet from them.
Draco was past words. He couldn’t answer anymore. He only started fisting his cock for real; hard and fast and full of soap. He didn’t hear Tom anymore, didn’t want to hear lest he tell him to stop again. Draco was past caring. He just pumped, the pleasure climbing higher and higher until he sprayed his come all over the tiles. It almost instantly disappeared into the drain.
"Ron will come around. He's also a person of actions above words. You just need to wear him down. We can all do babysitting Teddy together – he's very good at moderating. And very distracting." Draco's arms wound themselves around Harry, squeezed him almost painfully tight.
Harry sighed and drank more beer, feeling only slightly ridiculous and glad that in actuality nobody could hear him. This day could only be handled slightly drunk.
"What are you even doing there?" Ron asked. "Andromeda told you a gazillion times that you're not allowed to bring your work home. It's not healthy."
"These Aurors were alerted by the wards," Ragnok said to him. "They wish to know why we let Draco Malfoy into his family vault."
Harry saw a few women around them raise their hands to their mouth, smiling. Then they started dancing. Malfoy had quite a good voice, though he slurred a few words.
"We are not doing that again," Harry said. "This was a once in a lifetime sort of thing. No inner Gryffindor is worth this insanity. I learned in Second Year that driving enchanted cars ends badly."
"Listen, Ron. Yes, it is. And you won't understand it right now. I'll come over sometime tomorrow, and we'll talk, okay? Please enjoy your party. I’m sorry."
Harry practically lived in his red Auror uniform, and Andromeda liked to remind him to take it off every once in a while by buying him clothes on her shopping trips. They generally were Muggle and very stylish. She always put them in Tonks' room because Andromeda wanted to have someone breathing life into it, move stuff around, make it seem less – dead.
Draco returned Teddy's dummy to him – Teddy would just randomly hand it to people – and got to his feet with a cough.
"I meant it, by the way," Malfoy said, eyes still closed. "I regret many choices I made, and I want to – " He went quiet. "I still had some remaining
Harry swallowed. “Here?” Someone standing in their garden would have a wonderful view of everything going on in the living room through the big window front.
“He comes home,” he picked up Tom’s narrative. “I’m covered in paint, he is sweaty. He’s tired and just drops his clothes as soon as he’s through the door, walking to the bathroom naked.”
The accounting woman widened her eyes, looking from Harry to Malfoy and back. Harry smiled at her reassuringly and pressed his index finger to his lips. Finally, she closed her mouth with a cluck and ducked her head to go back to her work.
"Give it up, Potter and focus on tracking the Carrows. They murder a human being for every day we don't catch them. Just leave Malfoy. Someone must have hit him on the head too hard, that's all."
“Yes,” Draco said. “Right there. Stay on your knees.” Draco was getting harder, looking down at Harry, who was partly listening to the speaker while he palmed his own erection, his naked body still a little wet from the shower.
“He reaches for his own cock, but you slap the hand away. You’re in control. You slowly surround his cock with one hand, the other you cover in shampoo. You circle his hole, tease him until he pushes back, then you slowly let it slip past the rim and push one finger in.” Draco reached back to his own ass, pushing the underwear lower. Following Tom’s instructions.
"Kreacher," Harry called into the dark of Grimmauld on Sunday. "I want to talk to you about something."
Draco had disappeared into his Atelier Room, without carrying any boxes, and spend the last few hours power painting human-sized canvases with the biggest brush he could find, finally throwing black paint at them with his hands.
There was noise at the table ahead, and Harry saw Malfoy grin and pull all the chips at the centre of the table over to him.
He pulled on Harry's sleeve and then walked off into the direction of the gates. Before Harry could say that he didn't actually want to fly to Paris, Malfoy had already placed his bag on the baggage control and walked through the detectors.
Draco's heart sped up, as he hovered above Harry's cock. He spread his legs wider, giving Tom a better view. Tom just leaned back in the cushions and gestured for him to continue, so Draco swallowed once and then let himself sink down onto Harry's cock. He moaned as it breached his rim, stretched him from the inside. Harry's hips spasmed and he slammed up, so Draco had to hold still for a while squeezing Harry tightly with his inner muscles.
"That's good," Tom said. "Keep going. You can go harder, Potter. Look at him losing his mind up here." Draco couldn't control the sounds which each thrust forced from him. He just keened but before he could climax, Tom's hand stilled the hand fisting his cock, and Harry's spasmed under him. Draco felt the warm liquid flood his insides and whined when Tom didn't allow him to come himself.
"Hey there, Potter," Tom said. "How about you show us how much those muscles are worth." Harry lifted his head to look up, then he bit his own lip and started fucking upwards, hard and fast. He had to support himself on his arms because Draco was being held slightly too far up in the air. There was a dazed glint in his eyes, a nearly feral look, as Harry slammed upwards again and again with so much force that Draco felt the air knocked out of him. He leaned back and breathed in Tom's aftershave, as he couldn't suppress the little sounds which came from his mouth.
Pain and pleasure spread like wildfire throughout Draco’s body as Harry began to fuck him in earnest, over his desk, like there was never a time when they didn’t do this.
Blaise had called in reinforcements for his second round of questioning. Pansy had been harder to dismiss than her boyfriend, but Draco did his best to sound detached when he had told her, “Nobody.”
“Wouldn't that have more flavor?” Draco tried to glare back at him. “And besides there’s nothing vanilla about me.”
He took another bite of bagel and swallowed before he allowed himself to ask, “Well what did you want to talk about?”
“Well, well, well,” a voice chuckled to his right, interrupting his thoughts, “fancy seeing you here.”
Leave it to Harry to supply him with yet another reason he didn’t typically bring his conquests home. But Harry’s voice was light and he was
“I always liked chemistry. Baking, too. I was good at both in high school,” Draco answered slowly, “But mostly I enjoyed Physics. I actually took a couple advanced Physics classes for electives during my time at University. It was challenging, in a good way.”
“I know you can take care of yourself. And how I acted, it’s actually been tearing me up a bit. To the point where my friends told me I either had to say something and stop avoiding you, or let it go and forget it. So, yeah. I’m sorry, okay?” Harry looked slightly hopeful at having got it all out.
“What?” Draco asked with an edge to his voice, indignity rising up in him. It was only their second time playing and he was already breaking the rules.
“What about you?” Draco gave him a skeptical look despite the fluttering building in his stomach at just how fucking
“You’ll find I’m very vegan friendly.” Green Eyes smiled kindly. “And not terribly picky about what I eat. If it tastes good, I’m game.” As if to prove the point he took out a piece of pizza from the box and took a bite. “Yum,” he hummed, the sound going straight down Draco’s spine and to his cock in a way he was certain Harry had
Draco looked reasonably green in the face, clutching his seat tightly and throwing secret but very obvious glances to their respective partners. The latter were screaming at each other over the roaring machine. They'd most likely done this a million times – and didn't have a general mistrust towards anything non-magical.
Quickly he exited the Hog's Head and looked around. Just able to see Draco ahead, walking up the street to Hogwarts. Harry would have liked to apparate after him, but Hogwarts' wards extended all the way to Hogsmeade now. So Harry sprinted after him.
“Have phone sex with Tom, both of us imagining fucking you in the shower. We totally did, dear. I want you to listen to it. And finger me to the instructions.”
"One second." Someone coughed. Then there was more heavy breathing and wood clattered to the floor. The wand?
“I know we have a ways to go ahead of us, but if you can put up with me - and I’ve already made it abundantly clear I can more than put up with you,” Harry playfully elbowed him in his side before his voice became more serious, “I would be honored to go through life by your side.”
It was slow going at first, Harry was thick and Draco was tighter than he thought. It burned a little, but as soon as he felt the head of Harry’s cock cross the tight rim of his arse, it became easier to fit him inside.
“Do you want something to drink?” Draco asked, moving towards the kitchen. Harry caught him by the wrist.
“Leave.” Harry moved forward ready to fight. Draco wanted to disappear, but running was never an option for him.
“So,” Harry said, casually taking a seat and passing over Draco his coffee, “do you want to start or shall I?”
Draco thought he might have to reevaluate his assertion of just how drunk Blaise really was. Or perhaps how drunk
If fucking Harry was going to become a regular thing in his office, he was going to need to rethink that judgement, and fast.
‘Well, if you haven’t figured it out yet,’ Draco thought, ‘I’m not normal.’ He took another sip and was about to open his mouth to give a mumbled thanks when Blaise spared him.
Harry’s smile didn’t falter as he slid a piece of folded scrap paper across the tabletop. “Will you meet me here this weekend?”
Draco gritted his teeth but remained quiet. He often found this worked better than protesting. It was a tactic that served to make her mad, but it was better than her twisting his words later on.
Draco had some thoughts on if it was a ‘bad thing’ or not but bit his tongue. Instead he offered, “That should be-“ Draco was about to say ‘interesting’ when someone knocked his shoulder.
And when he came later, pressed against the wall in the back of the club’s loo under the gaze of the wrong green eyes, he felt even dirtier than he had before.
Draco barely felt the cold air before Harry’s hand covered him, tentatively stroking upwards. Draco thought he might have heard him mutter, “Like velvet,” but he couldn’t be sure before his lips were claimed again. Harry simultaneously flipped them over and pushed them up further onto the bed.
“Good.” Draco felt the corners of his lips turn up slightly. “Surprisingly good. I don’t even usually
It was only after Draco had his blond roast in front of him that he felt safe to ask his one question of the day.
Draco had never really liked the clingy type before, but damn if Harry didn’t smell amazing, didn’t feel so good, didn’t act so
“Your place is amazing.” Harry looked at him, wide eyed. “You’re going to make me self conscious if you ever come back to mine.”
The man looked down in confusion. Draco followed his gaze. Sure enough, there was no name on the coffee cup.
The next morning, when Draco ventured to the coffee shoppe alone, he caught a glimpse of a headline on the paper by the counter:
The World Literacy Foundation is a wonderful charity that helps to combat illiteracy worldwide. If you would like to help and lend your support, please check them out here: https://worldliteracyfoundation.org/causes/uk/
Harry let out a small chuckle. “It’s your spunk too. And seeing as how I’m going to spend the night, I thought we could wash it off together in the shower.”
Swallowing down his rising anger, they were out in public after all, another thought occurred to him. “Are you sure you’re not stalking me?” Draco asked suddenly, narrowing his eyes.
Draco wanted to lean forward and  kiss those lips again. Or pull Harry close and hug him or just hold him for a while. Draco wasn’t even sure he knew
Harry laughed, but Draco got the feeling it wasn’t directed at him. “I almost want to believe that,” Harry laughed, though this time it sounded a little more uneasy. Suddenly Draco wanted to erase those fears.
Draco chose to ignore the warmth that spread along with the ‘family emergency’ bit for the moment. “I don’t know what you would do. I certainly didn’t
They barely moved past the doorframe of the bedroom when Harry’s lips were on his again. Draco melted into the kiss as he was marched backwards toward the bed, where his knees hit the long, upholstered bench that sat at the end of the mattress.
“Honestly, not that I’d really know what to look for, but I would say it was true love from the start. At least on his part anyway. She had just started to do ‘haul’ videos - you know those videos where people go shopping and show off what they bought?” Harry was nodding and Draco felt like a fool for having tried to explain it, “so he sent her some clothes to try from their latest line along with his personal information. I told him he was crazy. And apparently I know nothing about love because they are going on well over fourteen years strong now.”
Draco didn’t know when he decided sex should be fun. He certainly didn’t learn that from the state of his parent’s relationship.
“Flint-” Draco’s voice was firm, “do not make a scene here.” Damn how he sounded like his mother. “It will do no good for anyone.” Fuck, now he sounded like his father.
Instead he looked up and found himself lost in stupid, green eyes. Green eyes that looked exceptionally bright under the moonlight. Green eyes that were not behind glasses at the moment.
“What’s the rush?” Harry whispered, pulling back and running his hand through Draco’s hair and behind his ear. “We have all night.”
Harry let out a laugh which stopped mid-melody when he noticed Draco standing before him, glaring daggers at him.
If he felt like going back to woman, he might have taken her up on her offer, but as much as he recognized he could do with a good shag, he wasn’t
Was it Draco’s imagination or were those green eyes watching him more closely? “Same as the last,” he drawled.
Draco couldn’t tell if that was meant as a compliment but the pounding of his heart and the heat pooling in his stomach at the words begged him to believe that it was. ‘Why did this infuriating man have such an effect on him?’ he thought.
Draco had tried very hard not to resent them for it all. To escape the misery of Malfoy Manor, Draco had enrolled in University – a rebellious yet constructive way of spending his family’s money, which was rightfully his in the first place and while it was still there.
Draco held the eye contact for a moment before relenting. “No,” he reassured. “The look on your face,” he chuckled, “was worth it.”
Draco felt heat rise in his chest. He wondered if this was what it felt like to be missed. He had certainly felt abandoned when Harry had disappeared, but from the way Green Eyes was acting now Draco wondered if he’d blown the whole thing out of proportion.
in his baggy jeans, old shoes - albeit slightly nicer ones than normal - and white t-shirt. Draco hoped that he had changed from his meeting before coming here, but knowing Harry he’d probably simply removed a sport coat and left it somewhere. The thought caused his stomach to drop and he felt  his anger start to dislodge, freeing itself from deep within Draco’s psyche.
“Three questions today,” Draco greeted those green eyes the next morning, unsure of exactly why he was asserting this himself, “but you’re buying the coffee.” It wasn’t that he couldn’t afford it, it just felt like a more fair trade off.
Harry just swayed with the music, and in the end, he and Malfoy sang the lyrics together. Dancing with the other people in the room.
"Is it Death Eaters?" Harry asked. He raised his wand higher – ready to cast at any second. They'd rounded up most remaining members of the Inner Circle in the last months, and only the Carrows were still missing. But you never knew for sure.
Ron left when Andromeda returned close to midnight. He was living with George because they'd all been a bit concerned about what would happen after Fred's funeral. Harry could have lived there too. But in the early days, May and June, he'd felt at home within the dim light of Grimmauld.
. Harry groaned. Inside it was loud, a disco ball hung from the ceiling, and people were dancing to 80s music. Malfoy looked around at the people like he was seeing humans for the first time, but then that was his reaction to most Muggle things.
Draco considered this. It felt like a fair bargain. And he still had plenty of bagel to eat. He nodded.
Draco wanted to shoot something. He just hoped he could make it to his office without anyone else bothering him.
“Well, I have known Blaise since before the two of us could walk. He’s the heir to the Zabini fashion empire, and our families have always run in the same circles.” That was putting it delicately, but Draco pressed on. “Pansy was an up and coming YouTube star when we were in our early teens. He found her videos early on and instantly fell in love. You’ve never seen a man so happy than when he first started
Draco raised up his eyebrows at the caterpillar bit, but thinking back a beat decided he had something else he’d rather ask. “Why do you put up with me, then?”
“We were just headed out to meet Hermione - Ron’s girlfriend - for some food,” Harry said by way of explanation, “Would- would you want to join us?”
Draco wanted to yank that smile off his face, but he sucked down a breath and tried to be supportive. After all that’s what boyfriends did, right? They supported each other? Not that Draco would know first hand, it was only a theory, but he certainly didn’t want to deliberately start a fight, in their coffee shoppe, the morning before Harry was set to leave.
Draco blushed. He actually blushed. It was the truth, he’d been called out, and he actually felt his cheeks heat up.
Closing his eyes to shut out the world around him, he tried to picture he was on his bed at home and the cock in his mouth belonged to a man with bright green eyes.
“Why, Draco, did you just give me a compliment?” Green eyes looked pleased. “Wait - don’t answer that. That is not my question. And either way that’s how I am going to take it anyway so it doesn’t matter.”
Harry’s hand was large, warm, slightly rough but soft enough, and completely unexpected. Draco’s heart was not melting.
. Where he felt like he had some modicum of control. It would not be back at Harry’s flat where god-knows-what awaited him. It was rare he thought past a fast fuck, but he knew with Harry things would have to be different.
Jonathan Stroud and Cornelia Funke are both real Children’s book authors who have written some amazing works. I am not associated with either of them, but I love their books and very much enjoy the way they tell stories.
“Oi- lay off him, Pans,” Blaise said, effectively cutting his girlfriend off. She responded with a mock-pout that Blaise chased away with a quick kiss to the side of her lips. He turned back to Draco. "Drinks?" he asked by way of greeting.
The phone line went dead. Turning to his secretary Draco narrowed his eyes. “This better be important,” he muttered to himself as she ushered him out of his office.
‘Would he even have a reason to live if not being told what he should do by others?’ To be free from the pressure of others would also leave him to do whatever he wanted without having anyone watching him. At least if he achieved something they could pretend to care.
Dinner was certainly morphing into a strange mixture of emotions, which only added to the growing list of complications that came from simply being around the other man. Draco didn't know how to feel about that, or anything else that involved Harry for that matter.
“You are all alone, aren’t you?” the man asked, squinting down at Draco through the haze of the lights.
But Draco didn't want to come like that. With much effort, he told Harry to stop and moved forward, down his body until he hovered over Harry's cock, which was leaking all over itself. Harry let loose a grunt but otherwise remained silent as he waited for Draco to say or do something.
"You have other friends than me? Friends you don't name?" he asked, chopping some salad. "Are you going to be more specific? Or am I right in my assumption that you were meeting some chick?"
"So are we apparating?" Harry asked. He had drunk two beers, but apparating should still be manageable without danger.
Draco braced his feet against the stool's footrests and lifted himself slightly, starting to fuck himself onto the dildo. He had to shift around quite a bit before he found the right angle which kept hitting his pleasure centre. Then Harry was suddenly pushed forward and deepthroated his cock. Draco moaned when the tight heat engulfed him, as Harry's nose nuzzled his balls.
Harry just snorted. Everyone had a bit of Hufflepuff – it wasn't something you could defend against. Especially not when you considered yourself to be 'working hard'.
"Of course, Potter." Draco threw a second Muggle police uniform at him, as he hovered awkwardly in the door. Andromeda ushered him inside. Before Harry could ask him to come up to his room, she had already pulled him into the kitchen with a command to Harry that he should go change.
Roberts cancelled the call to the other Aurors and Harry levitated Malfoy’s body behind himself back to the cart. He didn't wake up all the way to St. Mungos.
"I do understand that all you want to do is help. But all transactions from that vault are blocked. The only way to access it would be by contacting the goblins. As there are wards now set up to prevent you from entering, I
"It's lovely to meet you again, Mr Potter." Her voice was very quiet. "I want to thank you again for your help during the trial." Harry only nodded.
Malfoy looked down at his feet then reached over to a bottle of white wine standing in a bucket full of ice.
The kiss was wet and tasted of wine. Harry's lips were chapped, but Malfoy didn't seem to mind as he traced them with his tongue. He smelled minty. Hands pulled at Harry’s hair and pushed his head farther into the cushiony seat. And Harry opened his mouth to the questing tongue. It had been so long since his last kiss.
"We might have miscalculated," he said slowly. "We thought he would walk in his father's shoes and invest. But he didn't – "
"You need to be quite crazy, to break into fucking Gringotts when all of Britain is searching for you," Savage sneered. "Oh, wait. That's what you did."
"Your apology is accepted, Draco. Although you should know that actions speak louder than words. I've heard from your mother that you've been trying to change – and I think we might be able to build an amicable relationship based on that."
Teddy giggled when Harry arrived for his Sunday visit at Tonks Cottage. It always welcomed him with a homey atmosphere, the small space crammed with many different styles of furniture, clothes, and pictures of the Tonks family.
"We still need to do one touristy thing," Malfoy said. "Otherwise this Eiffel Tower visit isn't complete." Harry met his eyes as a hand pulled him closer at his waist. He licked his lips before Malfoy bent his head and pressed their mouths together.
"I will be moving to Andromeda for the next few months," he said and grimaced as Kreacher's face fell. "No, it won't be forever. I just struggle living by myself at the moment."
Harry had to look twice before he was absolutely sure that was indeed Malfoy standing there in the cashmere pullover and the comfortable linen pants. He looked so utterly Muggle, even with the Dragonhide boots and the wand strapped to his forearm – Harry nearly overlooked him.
"Let's – let's get this over with." Draco threw the door closed after stepping outside. Harry noticed that he’d left the key on the seat and had parked the car in a space where parking wasn't allowed. The cops would get their vehicle back soon enough.
“Let me help,” Harry whispered, reaching up to run his hand through Draco’s hair while the other traced patterns on his stomach before both moved to his waistband to free Draco's cock.
Draco narrowed his eyes. Hadn’t he heard that recently? He vaguely remembered Harry mentioning it. Draco vaguely recalled that there had been a lot more feelings attached when it had been called out the first time around.
“Sensitive?” Harry breathed out, his voice holding something like awe, as he lowered himself to sensuously lick Draco’s hip, causing shivers to travel up the blond’s spine.
“Yeah, but you picked and gave me the pleasure of your company.” Harry smiled, taking Draco’s hand. “Where to next?”
“You?” Flint stepped past Draco and he turned around to see Green Eyes standing there, looking more livid than he’d ever seen him. “No offence, but I could snap you in two. You’re almost in a more sorry state than this one.” He rudely gestured towards Draco.
“I don’t know how I am going to explain it to my editor,” Harry said in between hard kisses, “and I’ll deal with my friends and fans, but of the two of us, you are probably going to have a harder time explaining what’s been going on.”
Draco’s mouth actually dropped open. He closed it quickly. “What?” He hissed, “and just who are you to make up stories about me?”
Pulling back, Harry smiled. It was genuine and his eyes were bright as he said, “I’d really like that.”
“Hmm, cold demeanor with ice-blue eyes? Heart of, clearly not gold, but a nice silver, perhaps? Drinks hot coffee with a shot of soy to try to help melt it?”
Stepping away from the bar, drink in hand, Draco made his way over to the glass railing that ran around the edge of the outdoor space, passing long, rectangular fire pits and the mid-century modern benches that surrounded them as they ran around the interior perimeter of the bar. Groups of trendy looking people sat on them, chatting over the music. Draco didn’t miss the lady who leaned forward as he passed, pushing her tits up at him as if they were for sale.
Draco steadfastly ignored that voice in his head and got up to leave, excusing himself with a brisk, "My car is here." It wasn’t true, as he had yet to call one, but it seemed as solid a plan as any.
The truth of his words hung in the air as Harry reclaimed his lips. The passionate kisses rolled over Draco’s body as Harry tortured him, running his fingers up and down Draco’s stomach and grazing his hips which caused Draco to jump.
“My best mate, Ron - you met him that one time, remember?” Harry looked at Draco for confirmation before continuing. “He comes from a huge family. When I first met them it was a little overwhelming, but overall it cemented that I wanted something like that. A built-in support system.”
“I used to be on the swim team in high school.” Draco realized Harry was explaining. “It’s the closest feeling I have ever come to flying.” A dreamy look overtook those green eyes for just a moment before it cleared. “Did you ever play sports?”
By the time they ordered some food, along with a glass of white wine for Draco and an IPA for Harry, the pair settled into an oddly reassuring pattern that resembled their morning coffee meetups, but with the added benefit of Draco feeling calmer from the wine. Much like how the caffeine from coffee in the morning settled his mind and allowed him to relax some, the wine allowed portions of himself to get swept up in the discussion as it bounced from topic to topic as Draco learned a little more about the man sitting in front of him. The man who was now proving to be quite the distraction. 'Maybe Harry had gotten it right with planning physical activities for their first few dates,' Draco mused to himself as he did his best to hide his growing arousal.
. Comes from being an orphan, you know? Attachment issues.” He shrugged. “But I can see myself with you. We work well together. I think you know that.”
He ran the back of his hand down Draco’s cheek. His fingernails burned. A firestorm brewed under Draco’s skin.
last all night with him. Or perhaps it was the other way around. But that was not what crossed his mind when Harry said those magic words. Instead Draco wanted to counter that if they moved fast they would each have all night to cum multiple times, following up round one with rounds two and three and maybe even four if he could handle it. But looking into those green eyes, Draco realized that maybe, just maybe, Harry actually meant they had
Was Harry asking him on a double date before they had even been a first? Draco fought the urge to shake his head to clear the thought.
Harry, still kissing him, reached his hands down to pull up on Draco’s sweater. Draco found he had to move his hands to continue pulling it off over his head. Looking down at his pale torso for a brief moment, it dawned on Draco that he could not recall the last time he’d taken his shirt off to have sex - it had certainly been a while. But as Harry reached up to twist Draco’s right nipple between his fingertips, Draco had to wonder why the hell he’d ever thought to neglect this part of his body. He arched up into the touch that felt so good.
Without thinking Draco groaned and looked around frantically before lowering his voice in a warning tone, “Not in the coffee shoppe,” he grunted out, “we’re not in a club-”
“Yeah, yeah it is,” Harry conceded, sitting back, crossing his arms and his legs, looking at Draco pointedly, waiting for a response.
unlike Pansy, her voice sounded exasperated, “why did you have to go and make your affairs so public?”
Draco considered this for a moment. ‘Did he want another question? What could he ask?’ He mulled it over a moment in silence, green eyes looking at him with an odd intensity that made his chest tighten. He suddenly wanted to ask something personal to take the heat off himself, but all he could come up with was, “Why did you decide to start writing?”
He just let himself feel the bliss of a good kiss, of awakening desire, and the fast beating of his heart.
After Harry was inside, he transfigured his clothes into the same outfit the doorman had worn and pushed forward. It was like he had used a time-turner to go back to the 19th century. The entire space screamed: old, aristocratic rich.
," Harry cast but nobody other than Malfoy and his team were down here. Quickly, Harry got to his knees and checked Malfoy's pulse. Although he knew a few healing spells now, some habits just couldn't be shed.
"To a life with only healthy doses of fear," he said. And when they jumped, they screamed. And Harry didn't know whether he imagined it, but he heard his name over the loud blasting of the wind in his ears.
They were alone in the roomy interior, the driver closed off from their conversation by a blackened window.
"It's cute, that you're stalking me again," he said and scooted closer. "What were your theories on what I was doing? I like having all your thoughts on me." Harry's mouth went dry. He didn't know how to react to this. He felt Malfoy's wine-heavy breath on his lips. Why hadn't he thought to sit opposite? With more distance.
"Vault 445," Ragnok called, and their little group got off the cart. The entire lower region of Gringotts was buried in dense swathes of smoke. Harry cast a bubble-head charm on himself and then followed behind his colleagues.
“So? What do you want?” Harry asked. “He seems like the type of guy we’d enjoy in our bed. But I feel like that’s up to you since you’re then one with the conflicted feelings.”
"Whatever do you mean, Mr Potter?" she asked. Andromeda helped Teddy burp and then pulled something delicious-smelling from the oven.
"Please say those goodbyes to your crush," he said quietly. "I want something else. Something more real and substantial."
That day, Harry awoke from drooling on the Carrow case files when a shrill alarm sounded through the Auror Department. Harry had again stayed the night to brood over witness accounts, ignoring his body's craving for a good night's sleep in comfort.
Harry sighed. Everyone here was drunk already, and Harry didn't want to deal with this right now. He also needed to go after Draco.
"Well." They sat in the car, neither inclined to go in. From the Leaky Cauldron, they would be out in the open – and there would be no way back. It would undoubtedly not go well.
Harry stood at attention before Roberts two days later. The Head Auror was looking through some parchment. Many quills and stacks of documents cluttered up the surface of his desk.
"What do we even want at the Eiffel Tower?" Harry asked. "It is bloody closed by now." He couldn't help but smile at Malfoy, who was too drunk by now to tie his shoelaces standing up and had to sit down to do it.
Then the car stopped at a red light, and reality came crashing into him. Harry swallowed and quickly untangled himself from Malfoy's arms and was out the door, forcing himself to not look back. He cast a Notice-Me-Not charm on himself and then apparated home to Grimmauld. He needed a reality check.
“Lie down,” he said and pushed the large pillow in Harry's direction. Harry’s mouth glistened and his eyes were dazed. He’d barely put down his head, when Draco already swung his leg over his face and sat down, now within perfect view of the window. There was nothing but darkness outside, and Draco could see himself in the reflection. It would only be a matter of time until Tom would come and find them like this.
Harry noticed that his hands were clenched into his trousers, and his shoulders trembled slightly until something shook him, and he became very still. It was like Malfoy had put an abrupt stop to whatever he had been thinking.
"With you?" Ron asked, and Harry turned to his friend, who had a ridiculous costume of what seemed to be a fisherman with a cowboy hat. He was holding two glasses in his hands.
Draco nodded. He cleaned up the kitchen that evening and then joined Harry in their new living room, curling up with a book. He liked this. Being able to talk about his feelings. Being sappy. He liked the hand which stroked his hair and the lips which kissed him just because - with no sexual intentions at all.
As soon as Malfoy saw Harry, he stopped his fiddling at once and stood very straight as he made his way forward.
Harry already looked so fucked out that he would most likely agree to everything now. Draco turned his head into Tom's neck. Rutted back and forth, just trying to get more friction somehow.
“I figured,” Tom sighed. “He’s too much of a football player for my tastes. I hope he doesn’t expect me to fake an interest in it. I have to do that too often already. He looks like a hot piece of ass though.”
Harry exhaled. It was so typical that Malfoy would just get away with this, with nothing other than a slap on the wrist.
"If you're a good boy. Of course, dear. I'm not a barbarian." Tom pulled Draco to his feet and got a high stool from the kitchen, positioning it behind the sofa.
"Well, then that's that. You made your choice. You can’t do the 'getting over it' for her. Mate, I cannot say I understand you. I'm so glad I have Hermione and don't need to go through this shit alone right now. But we all are in our own special headspace. And I just want all of us to come out intact. 'Mione told me often enough, I shouldn't get involved with the two of you. And Gin is tough. You hurt her, though."
"This isn't work exactly -" Harry followed Malfoy's dot as it moved from Diagon Alley into Muggle London.
Malfoy was stepping from one foot to the other, sometimes swinging his leg while rolling a fancy suitcase in front of himself. A few girls were eyeing him, in the way they did when they thought someone was cute, but they didn't dare approach.
“Oh no, can you imagine? Father worships the ground Tom walks on. I wonder - maybe I should have. It might have changed his perceptions of homosexuality somewhat. My mom told me recently that they bought a house in Singapore because Tom has an apartment there. My father is such a ridiculous man.”
"He's been in a – dark mood ever since his father was sent off to prison. Before too." She grimaced slightly and cast a sidewards glance at Andromeda, who was busying herself with the cutlery. "I was happy that he was getting better recently." She glanced down at her plate. "I thought he was on the upward path again. He's only just decided to give away the Manor –"
Draco shook his head. This was Tom. No shame at all. He pressed the record button on the phone, so he could use the Audio on Harry later. If Draco couldn’t handle a bit of phone sex, then he didn’t need to try stuff in the flesh. He would just consider this a trial run.
When they had to change trains, Harry got them two more bottles of wine. Malfoy thought it was horribly sweet and cheap, but drank anyway.
It was odd to imagine that his parents would have gotten married at his age. That they would have a child at twenty.
With that, he downed his glass and got more. Harry shrugged. As long as he wasn't the one paying. To think of it, he might have exactly brought 20 pounds on this trip. If Malfoy decided to just leave him in Paris, he would have to stay there.
That night Harry sat in his new bedroom, staring out into a different street and wrote a letter to Malfoy – no, Draco. He was very unsure whether Draco even wanted to know what Harry was doing about sorting out his life. But well.
Draco huffed but grabbed a larger box, promptly unable to see with all that cardboard in the way. Moving wasn’t his favourite activity, at least not when he had to do so much work himself. But getting out of that scruffy apartment in Greenwich, and moving into an actual house, was worth it.
Harry quickly rechecked that Malfoy was indeed still inside Aspidell's, a casino, and made for the door.
Harry stared at her, uncomprehending. Family manors, just as their vaults, were protected by powerful family wards. They couldn't be confiscated. The Ministry could only block access. Malfoy didn't need to give up his house.
"You're a bit loose, Draco dear. And Potter, I've been intrigued by our little call. I see you're already aware of what was said. Therefore, Draco," Tom pulled a large dildo - even larger than Harry's cock - from his briefcase made it wet and stuck it to the top of the chair. "Come, honey, how about you sit on this."
Then Malfoy traced his scar with his fingertips. He still had that giddy feeling to him. A sort of childish happiness. It was all wrong. The Malfoy he knew sneered at him, insulted him. Why was he so dreamy now?
"I suppose," Draco said and pressed a kiss to Harry's forehead. "But he knows how to fuck, doesn't he? And he may as well leave afterwards. He is unpleasant on a good day. As long as you are with me, I think he is more than able to entertain us from time to time. If nothing else, we may be able to extend our kinky knowledge."
"No," Malfoy said, clearing his throat. "We are taking the Metro to the Eiffel Tower." He confidently walked off – into the wrong direction – and Harry had to do the orientation for both of them. They had to run to catch the last train still leaving the airport for the city.
“Chelsea, is it? Potter, central midfield. I’m not a passionate football fan myself, but I have heard of you.”
"Draco Malfoy signed in for visiting first his new personal vault, and then the family vault at exactly 7:00 am."
"I'm very grateful to the Aurors and the responsibility you've trusted me with, even though I never finished my Hogwarts education. But I've noticed recently that it has taken a toll on my mental health. I wish to work for this division for a long time. I certainly want to return to Dark Arts related cases at some point. But I need to step back for a while, Sir."
He disapparated and reappeared on Curzon Street. It was located in Mayfair, and Harry looked around the reddish city buildings, trying to understand what had motivated Malfoy to come here. Being in London was always a special experience for Harry. City life was different somehow.
When they reached the jump height, they were both tied to their secondary jumpers. Harry could see Draco's legs wobbling. Harry himself felt oddly excited now that they were at the top. He'd only heard that freefall was supposed to be an exhilarating experience.
and the disco ball. And how he'd wanted to read about soundwaves from the Muggle perspective. And they couldn't help but grin at each other.
Harry raised his eyebrows, then grinned in his careless way. He took Tom’s offered hand and Tom smiled back with that edge. Draco had been so gone on that smile once upon a time.
Later, when Narcissa had left, Harry and Andromeda sat in the living room, drinking tea. Teddy had been put to sleep in his little crib located in Andromeda's bedroom. Harry would head back to work soon. Although to Andromeda, he would say he was going 'home'.
"Fine," Ron said, "tomorrow. But you better tell a story that makes some goddamn sense, alright?" With that, he let Harry go.
"So," Harry pushed the map into his backpack, "you heard anything from Hermione and Ginny?" Ron pushed Teddy into Harry's arms, where his hair changed from red to black and his skin darkened slightly. With both hands and gritted teeth, Ron managed to open the baby bottle and put some milk powder inside. Harry meanwhile tried very hard to put socks on Teddy's feet. As it turned out – that was harder than it looked.
He, the ground and the walls were now dirty from top to bottom, but that was how an Atelier had to look for Draco. This was his chaos space.
"Draco Malfoy," Roberts yelled. "This is the Auror Corps. Roll your wand over to us. Then come closer so we can see you."
"We only need to charm it now," George said. Wheezes had decided to expand their range again, and they would now also serve pastries. Especially cakes since Ron had discovered a talent of his own in developing delicious recipes, and had quite the hand for aesthetics.
“Tom,” Draco said. “Tom. No, I -” This wasn’t fair. It felt painful keeping the hand around his cock loose. He wanted to fist himself; hard, fast - And imagining Harry this slutty was driving him sparse. Harry, who never did more than grunt during sex. It was so hot to have him say all these things. If only in his head.
He was still very handsome in his thin but trained physique, the skin colour only lightly tanner than Draco's.
"Halloween has kept us busy in the last two weeks. And there are still two to come. Yay... After that, we'll start on the Christmas supply. He loves working. Everything else will come back eventually." Harry nodded and looked down. They changed the topic.
Draco’s hand closed tighter around his dick. With much effort he pushed down the wet underwear, using some soap for slick. He breathed deeply, as the water drenched his clothing, and he imagined that he, in fact, had Harry’s asscheeks in his hands.
"Well, the Knight Bus cannot drive either, and they're still in business. I put some of the same enchantments on this car. It can jump and stretch as well. Get in."
"Well, Potter. Come over," Tom said. Harry got to his feet and walked over, and let Tom push him onto the sofa, so he was on his knees, and had his head bent over the edge, soon hovering directly above Draco's cock.
Harry couldn't connect this woman with the one he remembered. Someone who'd been so utterly emotionless during their hostage-taking at Malfoy Manor. Someone seemingly unaffected by tortured screams. This was the woman he'd briefly met when she'd asked about her son before saving his life.
"Yes," Draco whispered against his lips, “I mean, I should.” His eyes were wide and dazed. So Harry closed the last remaining distance and pressed their lips together. Draco bent down more and twisted his hands into the fabric of Harry's uniform. He pulled him closer, so there was no space remaining between them any longer.
Draco barely controlled the itch to ask how Tom knew this was his phone number. Tom Riddle knew everything, and if he didn’t, he pretended to anyway.
"What is it?" he asked, his voice cracking. Savage shushed him, and Harry turned his eyes to Roberts who stood before the elevator, pressing the button without pause.
Draco looked back at the floor, but Harry couldn't stop staring at him. He stepped closer and put his arms around Draco's waist, pulling him in. Harry knew he was rash, and that he never thought things through – but he wanted this. He wanted Draco.
"Just keep going Draco, only around and around. Move those hips." Tom kept up the slow encouraging words, as he started undressing, all the while never looking away. He loosened his tie and slipped it over his head, followed by his cuffs and the shirt.
"That's what I never understood about your Weasleys. It would be so easy to just cheat the Muggles out of some of their money. They do the same damn thing themselves. The wealthy ones cheat the poor. A bigger house and some better clothes surely wouldn't have killed their inner
"No, Harry," Malfoy said matter-of-factly, and Harry grinned, enjoying the sound of his name in Malfoy's voice. It had a different tone than 'Potter' did. They had their arms hooked, and Harry held a bottle of champagne in the other. Mixing alcohol most likely wasn't the best idea at this point, but neither of them had much common sense left. They couldn't really walk straight any more, or the street was just awfully wobbly.
“Let’s start in the shower,” Tom said. “Imagine he comes home from practice - that’s where he’s now, right? What do you do?”
Champagne was passed around on trays. Men and women were sitting around gaming tables in suits and fancy dresses. A group of women was dancing on the stage singing jazz music.
Richmond was very green and he liked this old Manor house which his family had owned for a century, but not lived in for decades. He had paid a team to do repairs and cleaning. Harry was wonderfully adaptable in such matters, so Draco had made all the decisions in regards to new furniture and interior design.
When they boarded, Harry too felt his heartbeat strongly in his chest. This was his first time in an aircraft as well, and while he loved being in the air, here he was unable to influence what was happening.
bringing Draco Malfoy to a Weasley event. Especially because I don't even know where I stand with him. Life really used to be so simple. But how do you ask someone what their intentions are? Why did he kiss me? Does it mean he's interested in a relationship? Do I even want a relationship right now?"
“And he likes that, doesn’t he? He pushes his ass back, giving you a better angle. He’s a slut for you.” Draco’ swallowed. “Oh, I know what you like, Draco,” Tom said, breathing a little more heavily at the other end. “We’ve always had similar tastes.”
"How can you possibly always have such good cards?" an old man asked. "I want a change in dealer. I feel this game is rigged!"
"Let's go then," Harry said and forced a smile at Andromeda before they exited the house. He didn't know which of them looked less excited at the idea.
Draco exhaled and pushed another spoon of Harry’s perfect Chicken Curry into his mouth. It was Draco-adapted in spiciness, and he knew that Harry’s own would burn his tongue.
They found the Carrows at the beginning of October. Williamson was killed, as was Alecto Carrow. Her brother was sitting in a holding cell in Azkaban. Harry wasn't the only Auror who wanted to make sure that he got the worst possible sentence.
"Will you just take us to the bloody vault," he said. "He surely didn't start a fire out of the goodness of his heart."
Now, this was Ron putting his and Draco's encounters into the weird context of a date. Harry wasn't sure he was comfortable with that. It only made him remember the two kisses more – and how he had so much fun with this new Draco. His antics were so utterly ridiculous.
"I was meeting a friend," Harry said instead. Ron raised a single eyebrow and got up to make himself another sandwich.
Draco laughed in response. "I’m starting to believe that all the Muggles are Gryffindors. I like planes and trains. But cars." He shook himself.
The chauffeur nodded to Malfoy and opened the door to the back. He looked at them both neutrally. Harry did not want to know what he was thinking. Of himself in particular.
"What are you trying to say goodbye to today?" Harry asked, stepping up to stand next to him, mapping each expression on Draco’s face.
Harry didn't even bother acknowledging him. Savage hated him for whatever reason, and just never stopped being nasty.
An eagle owl arrived later that evening. Ron and George were downstairs preparing the shop for the next day, so nobody saw him open the window slowly. It felt a bit like letting a stranger with a drawn wand walk into his house.
"Hey, isn't that Malfoy?" Dean asked quietly and looked over Harry's shoulder to Draco who still stood outside, and had not yet stepped over the threshold. He was looking at the ground, holding onto the door with a hand, but the white-blond hair was unmistakable even through the foggy air.
It would be somewhat like, 'Mate, Malfoy and I have bonded over saying goodbye to random stuff in our lives and an extensive amount of wine.'
"Is everything alright?" Harry asked uncertainly. He had stopped after all – just walking away would be weird.
"I sometimes want to ask you whether life is always this hard?" Harry whispered at their stones gazing up at them through the veil of his cloak. "It seemed simple in school. There was always some sort of goal, something I had to do to survive. And now with all that gone, I just feel a bit lost. Like after an adrenaline rush, when you slowly come back down and feel off balance."
“I made dinner, and we still have that wine your mom gifted us,” Harry said in the voice he used when he thought he had to be cautious with Draco. “This seems like the day for it.”
"Well," Harry said, coughing again. "You said to bring who I'd been meeting with on the weekends, so I did. He's okay – not that much of a git any longer. Just give him some wine."
Draco sighed and looked at the many removal boxes still standing on their front lawn. They looked very heavy.
want, goddamnit. And what the hell is that outfit?" someone hollered. Harry rolled his eyes as Smith made his way from the back of the shop over to them.
"We're not taking a plane. They are awful for the environment, you know? All that pollution. We're taking a Portkey back."
"I want to be assigned less war-related work for the near future, Sir," Harry said after he'd entered Roberts' office. Roberts didn't say much for a long time, just leaned back in his office chair and looked at Harry.
"He Floo-ed to Hogsmeade," Tom grunted. Harry grabbed some Floo powder and threw it into the fire so quickly that he didn’t even have time to mentally prepare for the nausea.
Of course, if Malfoy hijacked planes it was in the middle of the goddamn night, so Harry arrived at the airport that evening at 9pm. The plane was supposed to take off at 11. He had not come to fly. He'd only packed his passport, to identify himself should it become necessary.
"I kinda still want to meet up with someone tonight," he lied. When he glanced up, Andromeda just smiled at him. Her eyes said that she didn't believe him.
"Invite her, okay?" Ron said. "Otherwise you will never believe that I can look past the fact that you ditched my little sister. It's been four months. I just – you seem a bit happier recently. And you're seeing that mind healer now. You no longer sleep in your office. And if that is because of someone in particular – don't be afraid that I will reject them, okay?"
“So, are we going to talk about it? Or do you need another blank canvas and paint?” Harry asked that evening.
“Would you stop staring at your broken nail for one second, Draco, and help your exhausted financé move your things.” Harry stood up on the porch of their new house, his arms crossed before his chest.
"There is nothing I can do, Potter," Roberts said again. "He broke his parole, yes. But accessing his vault is hardly a worse crime than what he's already been pardoned for. Because of you, by the way." He glanced up briefly. "Gringotts doesn't want to press charges. He burned his own property, after all."
“Our new shower is large and has dark green tiles. Harry’s already in the spray. He’s magnificent,” he said. “He stands with his back to me, there is nothing but a glass wall separating us. The hot water is running down his back, over the curve of his ass and down his legs. He just stands there, motionless, as the water drums on his head.”
“I step behind him and run my hands over the skin of his back. He sighs softly and leans back into me. Uncaring that I’m still partly clothed. There is no time to undress, I need to touch him. His skin is soft, but his nipples are hard and knobbly, as I reach around and twist them. His head falls back to rest on my shoulder and I suck on his neck, as I rub my cock against the creak of his ass.” Draco’s voice failed him at that. He imagined Harry’s head thrown back, exposing the long expanse of his throat, the deep hum rippling through the steamed air. Draco’s hand snaked lower and closed around his cock.
But then Malfoy took the microphone. Harry nearly bit his tongue smiling when Malfoy started singing in a deepened voice.
"This is good wine," Malfoy said, and looked down at the label, then handed the bottle over to Harry.
Suddenly it started raining, and not in the drizzly way he was used to but more like full buckets being emptied onto their heads. They were both wet to their bones within seconds.
Malfoy simply drank large gulps straight from the bottle after shooting the stopper to the ceiling. Harry wasn't so sure if the
"Harry avoids reading the Prophet, Cissy." Andromeda put Teddy down onto his play-blanket. "Draco has donated – well, more like lent – the Malfoy family estate to the Ministry, which will turn it into a museum. Some of the rooms will be changed to accommodate wizards and witches of special needs. Orphans too, till they are adopted."
Speaker-Tom said, and Harry’s breath caught as he pushed his mouth into Draco’s ass. He started liking at his hole while caressing his cheeks. The tip of his tongue trailing along the rim, only partly sliding inside. Harry's hands fondled up and down, massaging every last bit of skin.
A sad smile was reflected in the windows. The city flew by outside. Harry didn't think Malfoy would remember much of his first ride in a car.
He didn't really want to think about the time when he would be older than they had been when they died. In his head, they had always been so grown up. Now he realised for the first time that his brain was altering the picture of them.
Malfoy stuck out his tongue in response and got back to his feet, still breathing heavily. But he looked very self-satisfied. Even in the darkness, Harry could see the pink flush in his cheeks. They already had a nice view from here, so for a while, they stood still to gaze down at the city lights below.
“This is a family estate,” Draco said defensively. He was over Tom Riddle - thank you very much - and didn’t do idiotic stuff like stalking him. Harry and he had been dating for the last five years and planned to marry in a few months. “How are you?” he asked for lack of common sense.
Gringok pushed his glasses onto his nose and then jumped up to stand on the podium behind the counter just like Ragnok did. Now able to look down on their group from a higher viewpoint.
Then he came closer and lifted Draco off Harry's cock and turned him around so he was now facing Harry, and then sat him back down. But before Harry could slide inside, Tom held him there.
“Well, I got to go,” Tom said and pulled something from his pocket. “I just wanted to introduce myself. And express my interest in continuing our arrangement from back in the day, Draco. With you so close, that would be very convenient. Of course only if your fiancé agrees. He’s welcome to join.” With that, Tom handed them his card, winked and walked back to his car.
who still stood behind his counter. Ragnok stared at Harry with narrowed eyes, showing just a little bit of teeth. It was as if
"Oh, it's already here," Malfoy said, and Harry looked up to a long black limousine standing on the street, gleaming in the moonlight. "Come on, let's get in. It's my first time in one of these Muggle concoctions."
Finally, Tom's breathing got more and more irregular and he pulled the tie even tighter, finally forcing Harry's head back with a hand on his neck. Tom pressed his mouth against Harry's skin as he sped up and finally came, as always, without a sound.
Draco felt himself get closer to his peak, as he kept moving his legs, driving his orgasm. He was so deep in Harry's throat that every wall seemed to drag along his dick, the cavern unbearably hot. He felt Harry swallow around him.
The witch behind the counter, an old lady with fake red hair, blushed and then smiled in the whimsical way most strangers did.
“You push in a second digit and he lets out a grunt.” Draco moaned, still barely holding back from fucking into his other hand which was still fisted around his cock. “‘Beg for it,’ you say. Your hand is still only loosely holding his cock, and he’s desperately fucking into it now. But doesn’t get any friction. ‘Please, Draco,’ he says. ‘I need you. It’s itching. Please.’ He pushes his ass against your crock. ‘Please, give it to me. Fuck me with your hard cock. You gorgeous, thick trunk of a cock.’ But you still remain strong.”
"I love my sister, Harry. And I'm terribly lonely now. And while I can freely hate Bellatrix more than any other person – Narcissa, I cannot. She's unable to cast a
Ragnok twisted his large ears in annoyance and then pulled out a scroll and shoved it into Roberts's face.
"Whatever," Harry said. "We'll just return it when we don't need it anymore. How are we supposed to get there, though? Neither of us can
He sighed. “True,” he said. “But I was an impressionable young twenty-year-old and didn’t understand that if he
"Do you think the colour is okay?" Ron asked uncertainly. "It might be a bit hard on the eyes. And the mouth and those teeth are damn scary."
“Same as always. I realised there was someone moving in. And when I saw your white-blond hair on the front lawn, I thought I might as well say hello.”
"Could you just tell us what's going on?" Roberts asked with a sigh. "The people are frightened. We have sent a call to most Aurors still at home. Do I need to pull everything from your nose? There was a war. People are going to overreact."
“Tom,” he said. “What are you doing here?” The question felt like an understatement. Seven years, it had been. It should be: What
"So, is there a limousine waiting for us again?" he asked. They both froze, and Harry nearly hit himself. Until now they'd both easily avoided mentioning the topic of Friday night two weeks ago.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows and shrugged. Obviously not. At this rate, why had he even bothered buying a ticket?
"Your Gryffindor plant is a goddamn tree too," he mumbled under his breath as he got in on the passenger side.
"Not everyone can have luck stuck to their fingers like I do!" Malfoy's drawl answered. A few syllables were slurred – he must be a few glasses in.
, and tonight I just wanted to see where it would take me. No ill intentions at all. I'll give the money to fix up the Manor. I don't need it."
Draco tried to blindly walk up the stairs, but of course, he slipped - he wasn’t made for this peasant work - when a hand caught him around the waist and helped him regain his footing.
"What are you planning?" Harry asked after they had bypassed the controls. Harry still stared down at his ticket. Malfoy had somehow charmed the passport number, so it had fooled the Muggle controlling them.
“I know you had a long talk with Charlie about his romantic orientation.” Harry grinned at him. “Draco, it’s okay that you felt hurt when you had a crush on Riddle and were disappointed. It’s okay, that you had to distance yourself. And you can take your time thinking about this. We won’t do anything you aren’t one-hundred per cent comfortable with.”
"Oh, I've decided to buy a little house in the neighbourhood. Happily, my sister has allowed me back into her life, even with my many faults. And please, do call me Narcissa."
“He’s already loose and slick. He’s done some preparation before you came into the bathroom, and he’s got no patience. He’s breathing hard. ‘Draco,’ he sais. ‘Hurry! Don’t make this a game. Come on. Now!’ He pushes back against your hand, fucks himself onto your finger. He is so tight. You can hear the squishy, naughty sounds even over the spray of the shower.”
"Potter. Why the fuck are you wearing that as well? Did the two of you come in a partner costume? Are you two chums now? Is he paying you – though, in what currency?" He leered at them nastily and wobbled on his feet.
"Nope, I was just fortunate," he said, popping the p. The limousine was rolling. Harry had not heard anyone give the driver directions, so maybe they were just going around the city pointlessly. "I don't even know the rules of poker. I just raised and raised the wager."
"She was writing letters to me, you know? Always – although she asked me not to answer any of them. Or tell anybody. For years and years. She sent me money too, when Ted and I needed it. She would never tell me any useful information, it was mostly about her husband's drinking. Or Draco's arrogance and strange puberty phases. Or about her fear of Voldemort. Everything she couldn't tell anyone else."
Harry couldn't help the grin which spread on his face. Somehow he'd started to appreciate these cliff-hangers in his life. Jump out of a plane – why not?
Malfoy was easy to spot at a table at the far end of the room, his platinum hair shining even in the dim light. Harry had no idea how to play card games except for Exploding Snap, but Malfoy sat there in a relaxed posture as if gambling was all he did.
"Prove it," he said. It took Malfoy getting to his knees in front of him, offering up his back, to understand what he'd actually said. "No, no, no," he tried taking it back.
"I don't know what to tell you, mate. She's still unhappy." Ron sighed and handed the finished bottle over to Teddy, who had decided in the last two seconds that he didn't like drinking milk after all.
"So are we getting on a plane home in the morning?" Harry asked as they walked through Paris' city centre sometime later in the night. There were still people around swapping clubs or entering a new pub.
"Some white wine, please," Malfoy told the stewardess when she came to them after take-off. Harry sat at the window, staring out. With his broom, he'd never been able to go this high before. The outside temperature would be too cold. Clouds looked much like cotton candy from up here, he decided. Not the grey matter they were from underneath.
"I know 'Mione sends you the same long status reports she sends me, Harry. If you're asking about Ginny in particular, I think she's fine. They're both stressed because of NEWTs, and it's only October."
"You cannot bring that in here," someone said. Harry turned when something tucked on his hand, and he met the eyes of a large man, holding onto his champagne.
But he couldn't do it anymore. She'd wanted him to be there for her when all he wanted was to lose himself. Stick his head deep into the sand, and never pull it back out. The chasm between the happy days of snogging around the castle, making sure Ron didn't see them, were over. And it had shown in their kisses.
Maybe Harry should do that too. Actively cut out the parts of his life that hurt him, and no longer simply ignore them.
Harry quickly took on the task of pushing his tongue into Draco’s hole while spreading his cheeks wide. Everything was slippery now, from his crack to his cock. Harry's breath was warm, as fingers pressed themselves deeply into his skin, and his tongue was so wet as it pushed itself in again and again. Draco’s muscles compressed as Harry let go with one hand, and followed the instruction of pushing a finger into Draco’s ass.
Harry lifted his shoulders in a shrug, hands remaining in his pockets. God-damn-it, it was almost cute.
you were capable of this!” Draco was on his feet now as Harry advanced towards him, hurt clear in his eyes, but something else as well. Something Draco could not name beyond his own pain.
Harry came up slightly short at that, “I know I’m clean,” he leaned down and kissed Draco again with some small measure of force before pulling back, “but are you?”
Dammit, Harry hadn’t even paused to consider it. Draco was stuck, bound by the stupid rules of a stupid game by a stupid man who wouldn’t even
‘Bit of a break, my arse,’ Draco thought. ‘Can you be on a break when you’re not even involved with someone?’
Blaise laughed, but Draco had to strain to make out the sound over the music. “You,” he said sitting closer to Draco, “are my best mate, do you know that?”
To cover his tracks he leaned forward and kissed Harry for a third time, hearing Harry’s voice in his head from weeks ago whispering ‘third time’s the charm right?’ It pinged around in his head as he pressed their lips together, pressing a little harder, sensuously requesting entrance with his tongue, as the fire of the words spread down his veins when, for a glorious moment, Harry opened his mouth to him and they connected deeper.
The words seemed to encourage Harry as he pressed their bodies together. Draco could feel Harry’s hard length pressing up against his stomach. The heat and friction between them spurred Draco’s fantasies for all the wrong reasons, and yet suddenly they felt so right.
“My editor has me meeting with a publisher tomorrow, out of town. It’s not far, just a couple of hours, but I’ll be meeting with them early so she wants me to stay there overnight.”
Dinner with his parents always involved copious amounts of alcohol - typically of the rare, vintage variety. The buzz always helped with the boredom from another evening spent discussing business
"I thought you weren't coming anymore, Harry," Dean said, and Harry blinked at him for a few moments.
Then Malfoy pulled back and looked down at Harry from the top. He was smiling softly, and Harry felt something stir at the sight. Malfoy basically sat in his lap.
Harry sent Draco an apologetic glance as he made his way upstairs. He quickly stripped down and put on the uniform. This would be a great joke on Ron.
"What am I supposed to do?" Harry asked. He planned to visit his parents in the morning of the 31st, but after that he was free. He didn't really plan on spending the day alone.
Instead of going to the school, however, Draco made his way over to the Quidditch pitch. He turned back when he heard Harry's footsteps, and they just stood there in silence for a while, staring at the green lawn of the pitch. Draco's face was still expressionless – like whoever he'd been in the last weeks, had been erased from his memory.
Tom hummed, “The air is warm, the glass steamed up. Soon you can only see his vague silhouette. What do you do?”
"Very good, Draco," Tom said, lazily crossing his legs. "Now, slowly move your hips. Circle around, but don't lift up. Just around, forwards and backwards. Yes, that's good."
"Cissy was always the youngest of us. The most reserved. The one our parents doted on the most. She has strength when she is protecting people other than herself. I don't know how to explain this... She's nobody who would rebel against her husband openly. She's too traditional for that. Her fault was always a missing backbone. She isn't a bad person." Andromeda smiled at him sadly.
He, however, found not only Andromeda and his godson in the living room, but Narcissa Malfoy as well.
Heathrow wasn't a place Harry had ever been before. The Dursleys didn't like foreign things, so they had never entertained the thought of going abroad. Especially not if they had to take Harry – just abandoning him at home for a week was a line even they wouldn't cross.
Reluctantly Draco stripped out of his dirty clothes and took a shower, before putting on some of Harry’s shorts and his big jumper and sat down at the table with crossed legs. Harry just kissed him on the cheek and put some food on his plate. Draco felt more of the knot in his chest loosen. He was here, with Harry, who loved him. Harry who didn’t mind his antics and that he couldn’t sit at the table like a normal person.
Malfoy shrugged again. "I've always wanted to know how these Muggle birds can fly. Then I read up on it, and it is brilliant. I'm channelling my inner Gryffindor at the moment to gain this experience. Trust in science, Potter."
"Anyways, saying goodbye is a clean break. It allows me to say that while the past is a part of my life, of me...it doesn't have to be who I am anymore. I can move forward in a different direction. Be a different person."
“Well, Tom, he likes to plan his days. And he likes sex. As far as I remember he wants his sexual partners to be reliant. He might be possessive of a certain day or time. When I was twenty, I used to meet him on Monday and Friday night. But I knew he also slept with one girl from his fitness studio on Wednesdays and so on.
Malfoy had now made his way into the elevator. He met Harry's eyes one last time defiantly. Then he disappeared from view.
