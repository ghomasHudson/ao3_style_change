“You were nowhere near being subtle. In fact, I daresay you’ve gotten worse since school,” Draco says and grins when he sees the tips of Potter’s ears go pink.
At the end of the hall, Draco spots a corner that has a giant pile of candy wrapped in different colors of cellophane.
The first time they fucked, Harry insisted on being on his back even though he was dying to get on his knees for Draco. But there was something about showing the tattoo on his back, the words put there against his will, that kept him from doing so. One could even say he was self-conscious. When Draco had reached for Harry’s shirt, slowly hiking it up his chest, he started trembling. Then he remembered that Draco also has his own scars and brands, also put there against his will and forever a daily reminder of darker days.
Draco has a spare moment to really see him this time and finds that he’s easy on the eyes. He’s tall but Draco is taller by a few inches, and he’s got messy brown hair even after his unfortunate haircut with Gertie. There are a few lines on the sides of his head where Gertie went too close with the clippers and he feels like smiling, remembering that there was a time he was foolish enough to get his hair cut by Gertie. Nowadays Luna does the cutting. Still, though, it’s not a bad look and Draco considers it an upgrade. He also notices the impressive scar on the right side of the blood bag’s forehead. Hard lines shaped like a jagged thunderbolt. One scar line goes past his eyebrow and narrowly misses his eye.
Potter was going to be Ginny’s best man. It made sense. The bond between Potter and Ginny was something special and everyone could see it.
When Draco finally sinks down on his cock, Harry feels like he’s going to die. He’s tight and hot around Harry and it feels so right, so good.
Draco collapses in his arms, his back to Harry’s chest. Through the open hatch, Harry sees the corpse of Immortan Lucius fall from the driver’s seat. His jaw is missing. Pansy moves and takes control of the vehicle. Draco sags in his arms and Harry cradles him close.
“After Sirius’ death, the Order started using it less and less, instead deciding to meet at the Burrow. I hated being in there. I felt like I was missing something all the time like something was taken from me too soon. But I could feel the house if that makes sense? I could sense a broken feeling and that it needed someone. So I stayed and renovated it.”
The study is one of his favorite rooms of the house. It also has a splendid view of the Arno and he redid the window seats after moving in, making it cozier. He sets aside the papers scattered all over his desk and with a wave of his wand, he transfigures the table into a comfortable twin-sized bed.
Potter doesn’t respond, but he gives a nod at Draco and it’s all he needs before he cuts the engine and opens the door. He’s only been here under the cover of night and now here under the sun, he knows he’s being watched. He walks to the end of the Rig and raises his hands. It’s too quiet.
“Hold this, up, up,” Harry tells Pansy as she watches his blood start to flow through. He pulls the second needle from his lips and slides it into Draco’s arm, wincing at the blood that pools around it. The silence that follows is unbearable so Harry does the only thing he can think of in that moment: he starts talking to himself. Muttering and mumbling, suddenly with a need to tell Draco
Their skin is ruined and sags, their bones sharp and visible from the frame of their faces. Even while crouching they stand tall at nine feet. Wild patches of fur adorn their bodies, their claws sharp and strong enough to tear into metal. Eyes black as night and fangs sharp as knives, snarling, with saliva dripping from their mouth in large globs.
Suddenly, he sees Pansy reaching for the chain. The blood bag reels back and she falters seeing the ferocity in his eyes. Draco stands and grabs the chain and wraps it around the blood bag’s neck, pulling until he hears him choke.
He places something in Draco’s hand and it’s small. It sits in his palm, red as blood with small green leaves at one end.
Harry obliges and it comes to him so easily. “I love you. So much,” he says against Draco’s lips, “so fucking much.”
Hope. It feels daft now and slowly spills out of him as if he’s been stabbed. They’re looking at him with such remorse and pity in their eyes that he can’t handle it. He pulls free and walks. He can hear the faint calls of his name, but he can’t turn around, he just keeps going. He’s not wearing his brace, but it doesn’t matter. When he feels his leg start to shake he lets himself fall onto his knees, lips trembling.
He feels his mind slip into that sweet blissful space and he feels at home. Overwhelmed with the desire to do it—the
“More,” Harry begs, nodding feverishly when Draco adds a third finger. He mouths at Harry’s navel, leaves kisses on the taut skin, the pubic hair that pools at his groin, and pointedly avoids his cock. He kisses the inside of Harry’s thigh and feels a thrill when Harry rocks back against his hand, clenching hard. Harry’s hands coming up to fit through Draco’s hair in complete desperation.
The Rig then rams into the Gigahorse and the momentum knocks Draco and the war boy both off the vehicle but Harry is there, grabbing onto Draco as he hoists himself against the window by the driver’s seat and moves forward, harpoon in his other hand. Harry spares a glance down just as the war boy dies instantly, his body crushed by the wheels.
“Makes getting up early all worth it. And I guess my fiancée does have some amazing ideas,” Blaise agrees.
“Get back inside and whatever it is you do, don’t make a sound,” he tells them. When Luna starts descending down the open hatch on the floor he looks at Potter, amused at the way he raises a quizzical eyebrow. “I need you here.”
He doesn’t have too many fond memories of his last year at Hogwarts. Pansy and Blaise and Hermione had made it a little worthwhile, though. They bonded over the nightmares they still had. He apologized to Hermione for all his wrongdoings, for what had happened in the Manor and she forgave him. She reminded him, though, that it was his aunt who tortured her, not him. It wasn't unusual for him to wake in the middle of the night, covered in sweat, face twisted in pain, the smell of fire and ash too strong.
Draco’s the first one to look away, feeling raw and strung out. The sky has now turned into a warm tint of blue and purple.
“I was trying to be subtle,” Potter says sheepishly as if remembering that day is rather embarrassing. Because it was then. “I don’t think I succeeded though.”
“I can go with him,” Potter says and then lowers his voice, “There’s just something about being in the drawing room alone with Andromeda and your mother. I much would rather face a boggart. Please don’t tell them I said that.”
Draco lifts his hand and runs his fingers over the rough fabric of the scarf around his neck. He tunes out the rest of the speech, not caring for another word Lucius has to say. Water falls from the walls of the Citadel, released from the pumps, and he watches as the stragglers go rabid—refugees living outside of the Citadel and displaced from the War with no home to call their own.
“Yeah yeah, tell them I sent ye,” Gertie says. He hands the scissors off and he brings around the tattoo machine. When it turns on Draco suppresses a shiver at hearing the familiar sound again. Draco hates this part. He resists the urge to run his fingers over the brand at the back of his neck.
“Always knew you’d be good at sucking cock,” Draco moans and Harry feels hot all over. He opens his eyes and looks at Draco, eyes going hot when he sees the blush blooming on his chest going up to his neck and the way his lips quiver. Beautiful. Then Draco meets his eyes and Harry moans, mouth full.
Harry sees her immediately when he jumps back onto the Rig. It’s hard to miss the crazy wild black hair that blows in the wind. Dressed in black. Bellatrix. She’s leaning over Hermione who coughs up blood. He looks for something, anything he could possibly find and closes his fingers on a skull in the lancer’s perch and throws it at Bellatrix’s head. He runs and pulls her off Hermione, fingers clutching hard.
“My mother was born there. She was stolen and given as a gift to Lucius,” Draco looks down at his hands, scrubbed clean from dirt, grease and blood.
“This is incredible. You’ve gotten better.” Potter says after a while, looking impressed and Draco laughs because of course, leave it to Potter to be the true critic.
He’s seen that look before. Knows what it feels like to recoil at someone reaching towards you when you can barely hold back your own demons. Too many times Draco felt that way, nearly getting into a fist fight when someone dared to touch him.
He relaxes his throat, letting Harry fuck into his mouth, and feels his jaw start to strain. It’s a good kind of pain. One that he’s missed. He meets Harry’s eyes, staring back at him as he bobs his head.
“Did you get here together?” she asks, finally realizing that she’s got both of them standing outside her front door and Draco pales.
The rest of the dinner goes without incident. Every so often his eyes meet Potter’s and he feels pinned. There’s warmth in those eyes and it reminds him of hot summer fields and heather purple sunsets.
“Just a nudge,” he says and he’s right. That burst of guzzoline is enough to give the Rig a significant speed boost, just enough to avoid getting their tires spiked.
In the distance, Teddy plays a game of Quidditch with the boys of the village. Draco’s gaze trails after him as he dives down, looking for the snitch.
Harry gasps, body shaking with adrenaline as he leans up. When he opens his eyes, Hermione is there. “Come on!” she says and offers her hand and he takes it.
Blaise ushers them inside and past the entryway, Draco finds Pansy and her loving embrace. It’s only been a month since she last visited him. With her, it’s always as if no time has passed between them.
“How are you feeling?” Draco then asks, noticing the dark bags under her eyes. Her hands are covered in dried dirt and oil.
Draco finds his mother in the library later that night after dinner. She sits on the couch, legs tucked underneath and covered in a throw blanket. She has a fire going in a wood-burning stove and has a book in her hands.
Draco climbs on the bed, crawls over to Harry, and gives himself a moment to have this. He trails his eyes over Harry. He’s put on some muscle since the last time they were together and it shows on his arms and legs and it does
On the morning of Christmas Eve, Draco wakes up to find the streets peppered with snow. He makes an early start, already with a hot cup of tea, and puts on his apron, preparing to get to work. He’s setting the breakfast casserole in the oven when Potter comes through the kitchen, stifling a yawn, and looking gorgeous that he almost burns his hand closing the oven door.
“There’s a ridiculous amount of clear water. Lucius pumps it from deep within the earth and claims it all for himself. He calls it Aqua Cola. And because he owns the water, he owns all of us,” Ginny says.
He eventually finds an empty bench to sit on in the middle of a gallery room with Victorian portraits, and takes out his notebook. He flips through the pages, past dozens of sketch drawings and notes. He likes to write notes to preserve and cherish the memory of his visit. He returns to his hotel later that night and skips out on dinner just for the sake of catching up on sleep. He wakes early the following morning and orders room service and sits by the window. He eats his toast with marmalade, licking butter off his fingers, and drinks his tea. He knows he should send word to his mother that he’s arrived, but he’s not due back at the Manor until Sunday.
At that, Draco remembers. He had stayed with Pans to help clean up. The two of them managed to find a way to stay for another two hours just sitting in the living room, trying to sober up.
“Does it matter?” he replies, voice rough and right next to his ear and Draco shivers. Then he’s off Draco.
“You sure you don’t want that taken care of?” she asks him, motioning towards the cuts along his arms. They’re not as deep as the ones Draco has, but probably still a bit bothersome.
Draco falls on top of Harry and they lay there for a moment catching their breath, lungs heaving. Knowing that he must start to feel some discomfort, Harry pulls away from Draco and gently moves them so that Draco is on his back. He sighs as he lets his left knee fall, completely spent.
He catches Potter’s gaze lingering on his own scars, too. The harsh and jagged lines across his chest his loving aunt put there.
When Draco climbs inside the Rig, Potter is there with a rifle already waiting and he takes it. They say nothing, only look at each other in acknowledgement before Draco sees the bikes over Potter’s shoulder and aims.
“You have to mean it, boy,” she says with a mouth full of blood and rotten teeth. “Killing me won’t bring him back.”
Draco suddenly feels strung open as if he’s missing out on something. He knows that Pansy and Potter get along better these days after having worked together at the Ministry. From the sounds of it that friendship went far deeper than he imagined.
Draco looks up and sees Padma walk around the Rig in circles, her hands slowly tracing through the air and a visible ripple appears. The wards are new, something she’s been practicing. The first time she had successfully done it, Draco had been her test subject. With the barrier up, he couldn’t see or hear the Wives despite the fact that they were in the same room, standing just a few feet apart.
Luna nods. “I saw your mother at Gerbert’s just this week picking up some new seeds and a bouquet. She looked well. I think she’s in the middle of planning a redoing of the Manor gardens and fountain terraces. I’m sure she’s going to be so thrilled to see you.”
Fenrir and his pack. Werewolves who were once men but have now lost all of their humanity. Radiation poisoned their bodies and distorted their skin and bones. They only exist to hunt, and survive on the mere scraps of whatever they could find out in the Wasteland. This far East, far from the Citadel, anything is fair game. Draco turns his head just slightly and sees that Pansy is being circled by two werewolves. She’s biting her lip so hard that blood has started to drip down her chin. A drop falls at the same time the werewolf growls in front of her, snapping its teeth. He hears a choked cry. It’s Pansy. Something horrible twists inside Draco. Something a lot like fear.
It’s not that this holiday is weird, it’s that because it’s going so well that Draco finds it weird. Potter tries to help in any way that he can and Draco is used to that because that’s who Potter is. That’s what scares Draco the most. The fact that having Potter back here suddenly feels right and not strange at all.
They don’t talk about the last time Potter was here, though. A part of Draco wonders if it’s because it’s in the past and thus not worth bringing up. Potter has given him no sign, and they might have slept together but it was only once and nothing came of it. So far things haven’t crashed and burned. So Draco keeps his thoughts to himself and keeps those memories close to his heart.
“I was wondering,” Potter starts, looking especially nervous. “I know you’re not in town for much longer but perhaps you want to go out tomorrow for lunch?”
There’s a knock and Draco turns and Potter is there because of course there is nowhere in this forsaken estate that he can hide for any longer than five minutes.
Draco has thought about coming back, he’d be a fool if he didn’t admit as much to himself. He does know that leaving England becomes much harder each time after seeing Potter. He doesn’t have the faintest idea of what he would do if he stayed. He would rather stay on the Knight Bus than go back to live at the Manor even though it would make his mother very happy. Preparations for the opening of the exhibition were almost done. But maybe after...
He’s heard of house magic of course and knows that some ancestral homes become sentient. He’s curious and wants to know more but suddenly there’s a growl so loud and so deep and Draco feels it. He’s awake now and looks at Harry quizzically.
He walks into the kitchen and puts on a kettle for tea. He passes by the fridge and notices the other various postcards he keeps pinned to the door. Most of them are from Potter. It's become their own little thing. In his study, he finds what he's looking for. In a drawer, he keeps a stack of postcards he’s collected from gift shops and train stops all over Europe.
He laughs because of how ridiculous it all sounds, but it’s worth it just to see a smile pull on Potter’s lips. He looks divine. It does something to Draco, and he thinks how lovely it would be to see that smile again.
Draco moves so that the barrel of the gun is flush against his forehead. He eyes the blood bag, knows that he’s their only option of getting out of here alive. The eyes that stare back at him are hard and so green. It’s mesmerizing.
“Now, who would I be if I didn’t bring some kind of reminder of our misdoings from the before times?” Draco says. “I have a whole crate coming in from Tuscany later this week. Part of your wedding gift if you will.”
“Is this not a supply run?” Ace asks Draco a few moments later, yelling over the roar of the engine.
Draco tries to ignore the need to tuck back the curl that’s moved out of place. It’s such a stupid thing to notice and he finds it dangerous to be even thinking about it. There are more important things to consider like the fact that Potter said he’s no longer with the Aurors. No one had mentioned that to him.
Silence stretches until it’s thick and Draco rolls his eyes. He looks down and notices the name patch on the breast pocket of the uniform jacket the blood bag is wearing. The name is faded but still legible and Draco eyes it curiously.
He leans forward and Potter’s eyes widen just a little before Draco closes his eyes and presses his forehead against Potter’s. It’s the barest of touches. He lifts a hand and rests it over Potter’s heart. He smiles to himself when he feels the beating heart, feeling the heat of his skin through his henley. He doesn’t suppress the shiver when he feels a hand settle on the back of his neck. Draco leans into his touch and lets out a shaky breath when fingertips slide over the raised skin at the back of his neck: the brand of the Citadel. Potter turns so that Draco feels his lips softly brush over Potter’s forehead, his hair so soft against Draco’s jaw. He opens his eyes and stares out into the planes. His own heart thrums against his ribcage to a beat that matches Potter’s own heart, pulsing under his fingers.
“No,” Draco then admits, turning to Potter and watching him. Potter and art have always had such a soft spot in his heart. Draco is glad he can share this with him. “I didn’t want to push you away.”
On the dance floor, Draco spots Blaise dancing with Molly Weasley. She laughs, full of life and love, as Blaise leads her across the floor with a smile, twirling her with finesse. He was always the more gifted dancer between himself and Pansy. Ginny watches them from her table, teary-eyed and so happy. She’s got her hand in Potter’s who sits next to her.
When the Canyons are on the horizon, Draco throws a sideways glance at Potter and notices that he’s relaxed a little, but still furiously works the file against the back of his muzzle. Every now and then Potter narrows his eyes at Pansy, who throws glares at him.
“Of course everyone misses me,” he says instead, playing with the spine of the champagne glass. “Leaving becomes much harder every time. The way you all look at me.”
The others look at Potter, confused. Potter gets off his motorcycle and pulls a piece of cloth from inside his jacket. It’s a small map. He points at the center where he’s drawn the brand of the Citadel. “This is your way home.”
Draco realizes that he and Potter are alone in the kitchen. It should be like any other time where they found themselves in each other's company. It should be easier to be with Potter and it is, but every single time it’s also like the first time. What kills him the most is that Potter doesn’t ask any more from Draco than he’s willing to give. It’s not awkward and he’s not sure if he should be disappointed or not.
Smoke starts to rise from the hood of the radiators of the Rig. They could be on verge of overheating the engine at any second. They need to do something fast.
Pleasure rushes over him in waves, warm and sweet. He lets himself come, crying out into Harry’s neck, stills his hips, burying himself deep in Harry, and fills him up with warmth.
“We go back the same way we came,” Potter continues, “Through the Canyon. We can decouple the tanker at the Pass and close it off behind us.”
“I don’t know if I would have,” he answers truthfully. He needed that small push, a small leap of faith. He thinks that he needed to come back one more time to finally realize it. And he feels so selfish about it. But this time, it feels right. Draco has missed him. “I think there was a part of me that was afraid it wasn’t going to be the same. Five years is a long time, Harry.”
It doesn’t take long to catch up to the Rig, not after the kill switches have kicked in and the engine sputters, the Rig coming to a complete stop. Draco smiles, unable to hold back the smug look he throws the blood bag as he walks up to the door.
Draco opens his eyes and looks at her. “I am perfectly capable of getting myself home, thank you,” he says.
“My home isn’t here, Pans,” Draco says, voice soft. He turns and looks out into the night. They have this conversation every time. And every time it manages to bring Draco profound sadness to realize he’s missed more than he thought.
“Cut these, would you please?” he says, pushing the cutting board full of limes. He tries not to stare, but can’t help himself. Potter works with such finesse. He watches the way his fingers hold the knife and notices then that he’s rolled his sleeves up to reveal his forearms.
When his mother arrives, Draco notices she doesn't look all that surprised at seeing Potter in her son’s kitchen. What surprises Draco most of all though is that she comes up to him for a hug and then places her hands on his cheeks, and presses a small kiss on top of his head.
Draco walks back to the Rig and finds Potter already on the opposite side, reaching for the engine plates on the hood. They work together in silence. They dig through the mud with cold hands and dig in the steel plates next to the wheels. Pansy climbs inside the Rig and starts revving the engine, pressing on the gas. After a few tries and pushing, the Rig rides on the plates and pulls itself out of the mud.
Then, Draco reaches into his pockets, takes out the glasses and holds them out. He looks at Draco questioningly before taking the glasses, fingers running over the wired frames. “Where did you find these?”
The Riders put up a good fight, chasing after them to collect the cost, trying to steer them off road. It’s here where Draco really finds out what it’s like to have a co-pilot, someone who is on the same wavelength as him, someone who just
She turns and beckons to the door. “I don’t know why he always insists on helping when I am perfectly capable of carrying my own things,” she muses. Then she looks at Draco and her smile is warm. “Draco, dear, I’m so sorry we’re late. We had a bit of a late start. And we brought Harry with us. I do hope that’s okay.”
For dinner, Potter takes him to a nearby restaurant for hot pot. It's some of the best Draco's had in a very long time. They eat in comfortable silence. Only then does Draco realize that on their walk to the restaurant, he held Potter's hand the entire time.
At the same time the war boys call out to Draco. Out the window he sees the flares in the sky, far in the distance.
“Darling,” she says, pulling back from the embrace and eyeing him. He doesn’t miss the pointed look she gives him as she sees who's behind him. He knows that Potter is behind him and yet he is so unprepared for her mischievous look.
He leans up and looks at Draco. “However long it takes. I can wait. When you feel ready, I want to show you how beautiful you are as much as you’ve shown me.”
“We’re not going back,” Pansy says, arms stretched out in front of the Wives. She stands in front of them, unafraid. Draco has always admired that about Pansy.
He knows that Potter is joking, but the smile doesn’t quite reach his eyes and Draco feels an ache in his heart. If anything, he is glad that Potter has found some comfort within these halls. They walk past visitors and tour groups of students and seniors.
He’s watching Harry, the way he furrows his brow and his mouth hangs open in a silent moan. He leans down, kisses Harry’s nose. “You okay?”
series. It's a portrait of a woman wrapped in a dress full of constellations. They dim and glow in time and the stars behind her twirl bright. The fabric of her dress flows in the wind. The thin moon crescent behind her also glows brightly.
He doesn’t know exactly how long they stand there looking at one another but when Draco looks down at his wrists and sees the chains have been snapped, he doesn’t hold back. The fight is short-lived but rough and it ends with the blood bag pressed up against the wall. Draco’s got a knife pointed just under his chin. Eyes so green furiously stare back at him. Adrenaline pumps through Draco’s body but he keeps himself grounded and even, breathing softly.
The first time Draco sees him, it's the night before he’s meant to escape. Rumors were going around earlier in the day that the war boys had caught a fresh one. There hadn’t been someone whose blood tasted that good in a long time. Pure fuel, the war boys had called it. The rumors spread fast and soon everyone was curious—wanting to see the blood bag for themselves. Now Draco’s meeting with Gertie, the mechanic, and going over inventory when he sees the blood bag. His hair is wild, covering most of his face and for a brief moment all Draco can see are the piercing green eyes staring back at him. He’s got a gag tied tight around his mouth and he puts up a good fight trying to escape. Draco watches him, sees the way he overpowers most of the war boys. Eventually he realizes he’s outnumbered, stops resisting, and lets himself be manhandled onto a chair.
Harry reaches for him then, hands pulling him up for a long and hard kiss that’s all teeth and tongue. He bites at Harry’s lower lip and slides his tongue into the heat of Harry’s mouth, groaning when Harry sucks on it.
“Thanks,” Potter says, taking a mug and pouring himself some tea. Draco moves about, casting some charms to wash some dishes. Soft singing comes from the radio in the corner.
“Alright, alright,” Harry says with red swollen lips and Draco holds back the need to run his fingers over those lips.
Suddenly now that she’s said it, Harry knows what he has to do. He rummages through the small compartment and other junk, his hands shaking until he finds what he’s looking for: a knife.
The other war boys surrounding him yell at him and call him a traitor, but their threats soon turn into screams when Draco turns the steering wheel a little to the left and rams them into a swirling vortex. He watches as the vehicles get tossed up and explode in a cloud of fire and smoke, the storm lightning making vivid silhouettes of the bodies flying in the air. He barely has time to swerve to the right when one vehicle falls out of the sky and lands in front of him in an explosion of dust. He knows he’s got one more on his tail.
Having a moment to himself, he lingers on the thought that he is an outsider and won’t belong no matter what. He makes an effort to visit every so often but with curating the exhibition that opens next summer, he’s not been able to have as much free time this year. The fact that they are willing to visit him, though, is not lost on him. Pansy visits whenever she can and Blaise and Ginny always like visiting him in the summer.
When he’s flush against Harry’s arse, he slowly pulls back before thrusting back in and falters at how Harry’s hole stretches around him so perfectly. He has to close his eyes, hold himself still for a second.
Ginny is on the other side and when she sees Draco, she exclaims and throws herself at him. He wraps his arms around Ginny and hugs her back. He’s missed her.
They spend the rest of the afternoon going from gallery to gallery. Draco points out the new works on display and Potter tries to keep up. He knows that these details aren’t for everyone. They walk past large sculptures in one room. They resemble home hallways and doors made out of colorful hand-sewn sheer polyester fabric.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, leaning down and pressing a kiss to his forehead. “I didn’t mean to wake you. I just wanted to get some water.”
“Don’t know why you're so obsessed with my scars, considering how ugly they are,” Draco mutters quietly but Harry can see the blush on his cheeks.
The thing about decorating the tree is that Teddy loves doing it by hand. Draco helps wrap the lights with Potter as Teddy stands off to the side and directs them. It becomes rather endearing actually with Teddy telling them which ornament goes where. The tree this year is a gorgeous lush pine that he picked from the village with the help of Pietro, his neighbor.
“Can’t let my guests go hungry in the middle of the night,” Draco explains. “Especially after a good fuck.”
Draco had been away on a supply run to Gas Town when it happened. When he got back to the Citadel it was all everyone could talk about. An ambush on Bellatrix and her Death Eaters. She liked doing her own patrols, loved to hunt and no one was foolish enough to stop her. Gertie had told Draco that no one had survived except Bellatrix. She lost an eye and twelve men that day.
“Hasn’t been too boring so far,” Potter says, shrugging when Draco lifts an eyebrow. “We haven’t died yet.”
Today they’re heading to Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. Today they are hauling Aqua Cola and Guzzoline.
He has a brief moment of panic, wondering if he’s been caught, if they’ve found out his plans for escape. He wonders if they’ve found the rations and belongings that he stored underneath the tanker of the Rig. He’s out of his room and barely around one corner of a passageway when something crashes into him and pushes him back hard.
“Yes, I’m-I’m close,” Harry gasps as he cards his fingers through Draco’s hair. Draco wants this to last, but he knows he's close too, has been nearing the edge with each snap of his hips.
“Being around the Citadel and getting captured... Is that why you didn’t put up a fight when I found you?”
“I’m going to need you to drive,” he tells Minerva and winces at how rough his voice sounds. He reaches for the dagger buried deep at his side and pulls it out. It falls to the floor with a loud thud and he looks down at his hand covered in blood. He can’t die yet. “I’ll get him out of our way.”
He stands and sees Bellatrix on the floor, cackling as she pulls the knife out from her chest, blood pooling and soaking her robes.
He stands to the side and watches the way Potter’s brow furrows as he reads further deeper into the description of the piece. When he’s done, Draco hears the soft intake of breath and he takes Potter’s hand and presses a candy into his palm. Potter looks at him with sad somber eyes.
“No!” he shouts, watching as Pansy is lifted in the air, in the tight clutches of a polecat. Pomona tries to pull her back but it’s no use. She’s gone. They drop Pansy on the Gigahorse and she’s immediately pushed against the backseat window and she screams, looking at Draco. Lucius turns and also looks at Draco as he lifts his hand, one finger pointed up.
“We’re back to ‘Potter’ now are we?” Harry laughs, bright and eyes soft and warm. His curls stick to his forehead, wet with sweat and Draco brings up a hand to push them away.
“That’s not his blood,” Draco answers for him. Potter holds out a steering wheel and Draco takes it, a small grin pulling at his lips.
Draco’s other hand—pale and thin but so beautiful—covers his and Harry stills. He looks up and Draco’s looking at him and he’s saying something.
“It’s practically unguarded.” Pansy says behind him. “All the war boys are out here looking for us. All that’s left are sick war pups and half-lives anyway, too sick to fight.”
He feels himself stir awake in the middle of the night when Draco gets up. Draco pulls his hand from Harry’s and Harry lets him go, his own body shifting on their bed.
Draco watches how beautifully Harry takes his cock, the way the muscles on his thighs flex with every move, the way his stomach tenses under Draco’s touch. He brings a hand to rest under Harry’s rib cage, fingers moving over his tattoo. It’s an owl feather with beautiful intricate detailing and hints of white and black spots.
Before he met Draco he was a man reduced to the single instinct of surviving in a world that wanted him dead. Living as a feral animal hunted by scavengers and haunted by those he couldn’t protect. In search of revenge he instead found himself caught in between Draco and his escape, his compassion, and will to do the right thing. He’s seen the good in others but it had certainly been longer since he thought it was possible to be unbroken again. To love again. He had gotten used to it; being a road warrior searching for a righteous cause, who ran from both the living and the dead. When Draco got in his way, Harry found himself wanting to stay.
Draco thinks of his team, of the home that he’s created, and put every ounce of his being into loving. He also thinks of the void that he feels every single time he returns from England. The feeling of coming back to an empty house and an empty bed. He thinks of the fact that ever since then, Draco hasn’t taken anyone else to his bed.
Out on the balcony, the only light is coming from the candles in the hallway. In the moonlight, Pansy looks divine even though she’s got hours and hours of dancing under her belt. She sways a little with her steps and he takes her hand and helps her lean against the railing.
“Fenrir and his pack ruined the soil. They drove us out. We had nowhere to go,” Poppy says. There is sadness in her face.
Draco hands Potter a freshly made drink and watches as Potter drops a perfectly curled citrus peel. “My specialty,” he adds, looking proud.
“I’ve talked with the others,” he starts and swallows. “We’re never going to have a better chance at making it across the salt. We leave the Rig and load up the motorcycles with as much as we can and drive. We can be free. One of those bikes is yours. You’re more than welcome to come with us.”
“Remember me?” Draco says to Lucius and slams the harpoon inside. He lets go of the cable and it coils against the wheels and it snaps, pulling the harpoon back hard. There’s blood and a horrible sound.
Draco can’t help but laugh with him too. That was the thing about Blaise. The boy who he once knew as quiet and serious during the war had managed to also put to rest his grievances. After his mother’s death, Blaise inherited many things including the Zabini estate and the home he now shares with Ginny. He became a fashion designer and tailor and got by with a fine list of clientele, both muggle and wizard. Ginny was still a professional Quidditch player and still playing for the Harpies.
He takes the wine glass from Blaise. Almost immediately he can smell the robust ripe fruit, subdued by dark cherry and plum, surrounded by violet floral tones. Its rich finish is exactly what he needs.
By now he would have had the tree decorated as soon as the start of the month, but this is something he loves to do with Teddy. So he leaves it for last. The rest of the house, though, is already decorated to the gills.
Recovery for Draco is long and hard but Harry has all the patience in the world to endure the good days and the hard ones with him. They mourn the Many Mothers who didn’t make it and focus on preserving what’s left. There’s a sadness in Draco’s eyes when he learns that Minerva and Pomona died in the Rig. Harry knows all too well the way grief starts to swallow you until you’re bleak and empty. He doesn’t want that for Draco.
“How many days has it been?” Minerva asks and she looks so much older. Her soothing voice reminds him of the stories she would tell him of satellites and dancing lights in the sky at night.
Distracted, he misses when the elbow slams into his side and loses his grip. He feels blood pool in his mouth as he’s punched and dragged across the hot sand. The need to protect, to keep the Wives safe keeps him going despite the agonizing pain he still feels in his leg.
Together with the help of Blaise's assistant, they help him dress. Blaise also designed the robes for his wedding party. They are a gorgeous mixture of dark green fabrics. Blaise’s own robes are double-lined with black and a pale grey, soft and fine. He wears a muggle suit that’s fitted to perfection. He looks incredible and Draco can’t keep the smile off his face.
She means to argue but she can see it in his eyes, his pent up rage finally spilling over. He’s chosen his path. She nods.
“Are you hurt, Potter? You’re bleeding,” Luna says. There’s blood all over the right side of his face, hair wet and sticking to his forehead. Draco wants to step forward and brush Potter’s hair back.
She offers more firewhiskey but the bottle is empty and they go off in a fit of giggles and laughs. It reminds him of eighth year and the nights when they had too much to drink after a long day of studying at the library.
"You just never mentioned it, is all," Draco says to his mother when he pries. Since when? For how long?
Harry doesn’t see what gets pulled out. All that he cares about is catching Draco, pulling him back to safety.
“You didn’t push me away, though,” Potter reminds him. They come to stop in front of a diptych of contemporary paintings. The very same ones Draco found himself standing before many years ago when Potter walked up to him.
“Wasn’t nearly fast enough. For her, I mean. She got away in the end.” Potter says and there’s bitterness in his voice.
“Move, Draco,” Harry says and he doesn’t have to be told twice. He settles his hands on either side of Harry’s head and starts rolling his hips, biting his lip with each thrust. It feels amazing, it’s perfect. The heat around his cock is almost unbearable. Harry’s hands are on his arse, kneading and pulling him as if to get his cock in deeper.
Suddenly, Draco has an idea. He gets off the bed and walks around looking for his discarded shirt and trousers and puts them on.
He means to stand but freezes when he feels something sharp and cold against his throat. He can’t turn around. He sees Potter, sees that his eyes are hard and focused on something behind him. Potter slowly starts to raise his hands in the air.
Ginny smiles knowingly and Draco knows that smile. It’s too early in the evening to be the recipient of that smile. Merlin help him.
“Nicked them for myself after the boys took ‘em from you. Not that I was expecting to see you again, really. These are hard to come by. Figured it was worth something further down the line but since you’re here... I’d keep them out of sight.”
“It’s me,” Draco finds himself saying though he feels his heart at his throat. The look of shock followed by recognition on her face does something to his resolve. Hermione gasps and she leans in, pressing her forehead against his and she laughs and he smiles,
In the morning Draco wakes before his alarm, gets ready, and meets Pansy at Blaises’ home. Ginny and her party would already be at the estate having spent the night prior. The early morning is still brisk from the evening shower prior.
Draco is proud of himself for maintaining a cool composure at having Potter inside his home again. He pointedly tries to avoid thinking of what happened the last time he was here. He avoids looking at his bedroom when they walk past it, knowing that his heart will betray him if he does.
Only a few times does he allow himself to look at Potter, startled because he's already looking at Draco, expression soft and serene. He knows he shouldn’t stare, not when this many people are watching them. Potter looks incredible, wearing a deep charcoal muggle suit and long elegant robes that compliment his brown skin perfectly. His wild curls are somehow flawlessly tamed. Draco remembers how it felt to run his hand through that hair.
“Do you want to decorate the tree today?” he asks Teddy over breakfast the following morning. They sit in the kitchen, alone, both having the habit of being early risers. It doesn't last because Potter follows shortly after and Draco already has a cup of tea out and waiting.
Potter takes over and drives while Draco works on some repairs under the Rig. If any one of them had planned on getting some sleep, it’s now all lost. He spends the rest of the early morning getting lost in the mundane work of repairs. The engines are still overworked from earlier and doing this keeps his mind off what just happened. His leg still hurts like hell, but he presses on. He turns a flashlight on and focuses on what needs to be done.
Harry then reaches for him. Draco closes his eyes when he feels Harry’s hand on the back of his head, lightly pulling until their foreheads touch. Though Draco had been the one to initiate it many moons ago, he had soon learned to keep his distance. The first time Harry had initiated it, though, Draco was too stunned to say anything. The shock was all over his face and he couldn’t stop staring even after Harry closed his eyes. A clear sign that he felt safe, here with Draco like this. And this is what Harry loves the most about Draco—the easy silence that falls between them every time they’re together. His touch says everything.
“Sleeping next to someone you trust does that to you. Makes you feel safe even if they come back around.” She looks at Harry with a knowing look that makes him feel as if she can read his thoughts and see into him.
He pushes the carcass off his body and a surge of pain cuts clean through his leg when he stands. He almost falls, unable to stand up straight because of how much it hurts. Potter needs him. He practically drags his leg and picks up the shotgun. He aims and shoots. The werewolf falls over, dead. There’s a crazed look in Potter’s eyes. Draco reaches his hand out to Potter, and for a moment he’s sure that Potter doesn’t recognize him but it’s gone, quickly as it came, as he takes Draco’s hand.
“I don’t know, is there something you’re not telling me?” she asks quietly before greeting Potter. Pansy in particular got along with Potter far more than Draco could have ever imagined. It wasn't weird anymore, seeing his friends with Potter's friends. He looked at them with a warm feeling in his chest and moved on.
In the morning Draco wakes and he takes his time getting dressed. Today is his last day at the Citadel. There is no room for error even though a storm is thrumming inside him, wrecking his nerves. Everything he’s worked hard for has come to this moment. Today he escapes. He greets his lieutenants and when they hand him the steering wheel, he holds on tight until his knuckles are white.
His hands tremble as he turns on the Rig, pushing on the engine switch. The engine roars to life and it settles his nerves, hearing the familiar sound. He lets out a shaky breath, shivering when he pulls on the horn, signaling their departure. The remaining war boys and Death Eaters clear a path for the Rig, kicking and pushing the stragglers off the main road.
He finds Pansy already in the guest bedroom sitting at the vanity. Draco kisses the top of her head and takes the cigarette from her fingers. He brings it to his mouth for a profound drag.
even if half of it wont make sense. He’s free because of Draco and they’ve made it this far together.
He meets Potter at the door right as he moves to walk in and they both startle each other. He’s wearing a dark peacoat with a thick wool scarf wrapped around his neck. It’s freezing out, a bitter wind pierces through and Draco hugs his sweater close.
“That’s fine, I'll put him in the study,” Draco finds himself saying though he doesn’t know if his aunt has heard him.
The pain takes a second to set in, his mind too slow to register how it happens, only that there's something warm and hot on his back. He blinks, eyes readjusting to the moonlight shining down at him. He’s on the ground. The snarl that follows is deafening.
He doesn’t have to be at Blaise’s until the early evening, which means he still has the entire morning to himself.
. Sweat beads down his back and forehead, salt stinging his eyes. They’re both breathing hard, gasping for breath in the dry air under the sweltering sun.
“So you’ve thought about it then? About us, I mean,” Potter looks at Draco, eyes full of hope. With that same expression that Draco could never find the will to say no to before. He finds that years later, he still can’t. He lets himself have this and lets his fingers slide into Potter’s.
“We are not marred by the Wasteland. Magic comes easily to us as a result,” Ginny explains. “That’s why Lucius has been trying to breed us to pass on the magic to the babies. So far it’s only resulted in miscarriages.” There is a sadness in her eyes that Draco hates to see.
“Here,” Draco finds himself saying as he jumps off the Rig and walks over to them. He pulls on the thin scarf tied around his neck. He runs his hand over the fabric and pulls at it until he hears it tear, splitting it in half. “May I?” he asks, waiting, motioning towards Potter’s hand.
“Get them home,” he whispers again in Harry’s ear and when he pulls back, Draco’s fallen unconscious.
He moves for the gun holstered in the underbelly of the tank. Pain starts to sparks in his left leg and it makes him falter but he pushes through it to keep going. He trips and falls, his foot having been caught in the chains. A heavy weight pins him to the ground again and Draco feels it, the fury coarse through him and he welcomes it. He hasn’t felt this alive in years. The gun falls to the sand, unforgotten. He looks up at the blood bag and for a split second it’s like he’s seeing Draco for the first time. Their faces are inches apart and Draco stops breathing. He licks his lips, can taste blood and dirt. Green eyes trace down his face to his mouth.
“My turn,” Draco then says and pulls Harry off his cock. He gasps and licks his lips. He lets himself fall back on the bed and pulls his own pants down his hips. Draco slides out of his shirt and lets it fall around his waist, neither of them mind. All they can focus on is the feeling once Draco straddles him. He grinds up against Draco and it feels amazing.
“Here,” Draco says and he slowly pulls out and they both hiss at the loss of contact. He runs a hand through his hair before reaching over for a pillow, lightly taps Harry’s hips, and settles the pillow underneath.
To his left he sees Blaise on a motorcycle with Fleur. A lancer tries to throw a harpoon at Draco but Blaise is faster, their carbine rifle loud and precise. He watches as the driver stills, blood spilling from their head and the car swerves away.
“What?” the person next to him says, and they take off the scarf wrapped around their head, pulls down their goggles and Draco looks into Hermione Granger’s eyes.
Instead, Draco turns to leave but not before looking back one last time. The blood bag is now laying on his stomach, his shirt pulled up revealing his back. He’s still looking at Draco.
At that Draco leans up and looks over to the sun, watches it slowly fall down the horizon as the sky starts to dim. He then looks at Potter. "Is that what happened to you?"
The sharp pain at his side comes from nowhere and Draco screams. Pain sparks from his ribs and spreads down his spine and he gasps. He turns and sees a dagger buried deep at his side. Tears well up at how much it hurts and he starts to feel weak. His vision blurs and dark spots start to dance in the corners of his vision. His grip on Potter starts to slip but he holds on. There’s worry in Potter’s eyes as if he knows something’s wrong. Potter then leans up and finally latches onto the bars of the truck and Draco lets him go.
In the next moment, there’s a blow so close to his head that he hears ringing and the deafened shout of his name. He doesn’t know, can’t recognize whose voice it is. All that he can focus on is the fact that there is now a limp carcass crushing him. He grunts, the weight of it pinning him hard and heavy. When his vision clears, he looks around and sees Potter on his back. Potter pushes a werewolf back with a kick just before teeth snap closed over the space where his throat was mere seconds before.
“It could be with him,” she answers. “I see the way you two look at each other every time you’re in the same room, it’s rather sickening and lovely. But then I want to knock both of your heads against a brick wall because you’re both so thickheaded. Honestly, you men.”
Pulled back to his thoughts, Draco takes the bottle anyway, “Come now, more firewhiskey won’t kill us. I’ll make us something better.”
Draco smirks and then leans and kisses the head of Harry’s cock and then wraps his lips around the head. He hums when he feels the hand in his hair pull.
“Stay down and out of sight,” Draco shouts over the noise and drives the Rig forward, pressing down hard on the gas. In the rear mirror he can start to make out the war parties in the distance. “We’re about to drive into a storm.”
Draco makes his way to the kitchen to catch up with Blaise. The first thing he notices is the extended space next to the kitchen. A conservatory expansion was rebuilt to form an open dining room and sitting area. The last time Draco had been here, there had been floor plans and prints laying across a small rugged dining table. The idea of extending the kitchen had been Ginny’s and was a mere idea then. Now it has become a reality.
“Go with Harry,” he tells Teddy. His hands still on Teddy’s coat, his mind registering the slip-up, having said Potter’s first name. When he turns, Potter is looking at him, expression expectant and turning soft. Draco's surely blown it now. Luckily Teddy is there and Draco has never been more grateful for his cousin.
Potter walks up the stairs so that he’s standing next to Draco and being this close, he realizes that he’s nowhere near ready to see Potter again. Draco’s heart thrums in his ribcage, but luckily that’s the exact moment the front door opens.
“It’s got everything you need. As long as you’re not afraid of heights,” Luna says, eyes bright behind Fleur.
Many late nights were spent in this kitchen. It had become a safe space to talk about what they would do with their lives after the war ended. Blaise had been the one to encourage Draco to leave England. His mother and Pansy had asked him to reconsider, but they knew that they need only ask once before realizing that Draco had made up his mind.
The letter arrives on a Sunday morning. Draco is sitting in front of the fireplace and he’s got two notebooks out and an array of papers. He may be in a bit of a frenzy. There’s a light peck at the window then and he looks up, confused at seeing an owl he doesn’t recognize.
Draco’s impressed, really, he thinks to himself, that the blood bag has survived this far. As he approaches them, Draco notices that he’s got a gun pointed at them and that it’s a dead war boy over his shoulders. He drops the body, the metal chains clinking together; he’s still handcuffed to the body. For a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare at one another. Goosebumps tingle under the sweat on his neck. Draco feels like prey, trapped in a gaze that he can only describe as bitter. He makes a show to toss the wrench in his hand to the sand and slowly lifts his hands up.
With a proper haircut this time, Harry lets Draco trace his fingertips over the scar on his forehead. He finds that he doesn’t hate it when Draco touches him. Finds out instead that he craves his touch all of a sudden, as if he’s afraid something will happen and he won’t ever feel Draco again. He doesn’t know how to explain it, gets anxious when he talks about it and is thankful when Draco understands. Hatred and fear had carved a hole inside Harry’s chest. Something else starts to fill the space and it overflows. Something a lot like love.
“Then she is safe with Potter,” Draco says though he’s not sure if he’s saying that to reassure himself.
Draco watches from the hood of the Rig, knowing exactly what Ginny’s about to do. She waits again for his permission before she takes his hand and starts running her fingers over the open gash. She whispers words, in a language he doesn’t understand, and Draco watches the way Potter’s eyes widen. The gash on his wound closes up until it’s scabbed over, still red and tender.
Harry snaps his hips up and moans loudly, a cry practically prying out of his throat. “Fuck, D—Draco!”
“Some days are better than others. I'm happier, though. Being Head Auror wasn't turning out to be the way I had thought it would.” Potter says. "Thanks for asking by the way. About how I'm doing. People ask me what I'm going to do instead of asking how I'm doing."
They take off and drive and he doesn’t look back. When he looks to his left he sees Hermione driving next to him, her hair blowing in the wind and a determined look on her face. They’ll drive until sundown and rest. He’s unsure of what they will find across the salt, and a part of him is afraid. He looks ahead and sees nothing. Just a bleak horizon.
“One fuel pod of guzzoline just like you asked!” he shouts. His voice echoes along the Canyon. Silence. Blood rushes through his ears, his heart slamming against his ribs with nervousness.
“Well, I didn’t,” Ginny replies and presses her forehead against Luna’s and the Wives hug each other.
Once they’re in the storm it gets dark and the only light he can see are the flashes of lightning illuminating their path.
Some seconds pass before Harry turns and Draco moves so that he’s on his back and he looks up at Harry with a smile, sleepy and so beautiful. He tips his chin up and Harry can’t help himself, leans over and catches Draco’s lips in a soft kiss. Kissing Draco will always feel like the first time: soft, warm and intoxicating. Draco makes a soft sound when his tongue touches his. Harry moves his hands so that he’s undoing the ties that keep his shirt closed.
“Did you know that Potter was going to be joining us this year for Christmas?” he asks because it’s been on the back of his mind.
Draco’s friendship with Hermione is one that he doesn’t take for granted. He returned to Hogwarts for his eighth year along with Blaise and Pansy and found out that Hermione, too, had returned. Weasley and Potter remained in London to start their Auror training at the Ministry.
“Keep your hat on, it’ll keep you warm,” he tells Teddy and smiles when he huffs. He avoids looking at Potter and walks back into the kitchen. His ears are burning and his hands shake even after the front door closes.
Draco feels laid threadbare. He feels his chest tighten at also learning that his aunt also reads his work. It's not that he is afraid of this fact, it's that he wants to know more. If there is a single thing that Draco takes pride in, it's his writing. And he feels hopeful that he can share this with his family and those closest to him. Being nominated as a curator for the upcoming Wizarding Biennale was a bonus.
Draco meets Potter’s eyes through the windshield and they stare at each other for a few seconds before Potter’s gaze turns upwards. Above through the open roof, Draco sees a war boy standing over them. The pressure around his throat comes out of nowhere and he reaches for his throat, fingers pulling frantically at the cable around his neck. He gasps for air just as Potter moves out of sight. Soon the cable around his neck loosens and Draco pulls it over his head, watching as the metal snare pole drops at his side. He looks up again through the roof and sees a war boy restrain Potter as another throws a punch to his jaw. Desperate to help, Draco slams on the brakes and the momentum knocks them all onto the hood of the Rig. One falls overboard and at the last second they try to pull Potter off with them.
“Yeah,” Harry breathes, gasping softly when Draco wraps his other hand around his cock and gives him a firm stroke, thumb softly grazing over the head.
Hesitant, Draco eyes the texture of it closely and brings it to his nose and smells. He knows they’ve never seen anything like it before. Harry rolls his eyes and takes Draco’s hand with his own and brings it to his mouth. At the first bite, Draco’s fingers are wet and cold droplets slide down the palm of his hand which Harry licks.
“Did you ever think of me?” he finds himself asking when he pulls off Harry’s cock with a wet pop. He has to know.
Harry is utterly helpless so he only groans his response. Then he’s being pushed down again and he relaxes his throat, taking Draco deeper and it’s fucking perfect. His own cock is hard, flushed rubbing painfully against his pants.
“It’s good to see you,” Potter then says and Draco stops for a second before taking a large sip from his own glass. He waits for the gin to settle down his throat as if it will give him the courage for what to say next.
“No,” Harry replies. “It’s still hard to get used to this. I feel like I’m going to fall through at any moment.”
There’s one lancer still left and they're aiming a harpoon to the driver’s side. Draco’s eyes widen and he falls back inside, heart racing and hands digging into Potter’s jacket as he pulls him away from the window. The harpoon narrowly misses Potter’s head and instead it slams into the steering wheel. The pull back snaps the wheel right off and it jams Potter’s left hand, crushing it against the center pillar of the Rig. Draco looks around frantically for anything he could use, wasting no time to debate if this plan was going to work or not, and starts closing a spanner over the steering column. Ginny opens the back door and Luna helps her step outside. She lifts the bolt cutters and snaps the harpoon cable.
Draco tries to remember but the truth was, he barely remembered that night. “I don’t know if I do? I can barely remember that night with all the drinking.”
Bellatrix’s dagger almost catches him, rips into the shoulder fabric of his jacket instead. He’s so angry and she is a force, deadly. She’s bleeding, Harry having twisted her own dagger into the meat of her chest and she presses on, smiling as the dagger sinks in deeper just so that she can get close enough to laugh in his face.
He catches up to them and Draco can see the rage on Lucius’ face. The result of having what’s most precious to him stolen. Lucius doesn’t hesitate in aiming his favorite hand cannon at Draco. Suddenly Padma is there with Draco, standing in front of him, using herself as a shield and Lucius falters. Potter takes the opportunity to drive the Rig up next to Lucius’s vehicle, the Gigahorse. Draco and Potter take aim but it's no use. As long as there are war boys around, they will always throw themselves in the line of fire for their Immortan.
Potter looks around for anything to latch onto and then they both see it: the metal bars above the cow catcher attached to the front of the truck. Potter then looks up at Draco and he knows then that they’re on the same page. Draco veers the Rig closer to the truck until Potter is within reach of the metal bars.
Harry comes and he groans, mind going blank as he spills inside Draco, both of them gasping for breath. He kisses Draco as he strokes himself through his own orgasm, come spilling onto his knuckles and Harry’s stomach.
“Draco, son of Narcissa Black, clan member of Swaddle Dog and my Initiate son,” Minerva says. Her robes full of patches, belts and other trinkets clink as she steps closer to Draco and puts her hand on the one holding the knife to Draco’s throat.
Draco reaches for Potter like a lifeline and catches him by the leg before he falls off the Rig completely. He grits his teeth at the sudden weight pulling him down. Potter looks up at him with surprise. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see Luna and Ginny hold Potter by the other leg. There’s a pursuit vehicle in between the Rig and polecat truck and they press on the gas, speeding to ram into the Rig and Potter. Draco turns the steering wheel a little to the left so that the Rig crushes the vehicle against the truck instead. It goes up in an explosion of flames, the metal crushing under immense pressure.
He pointedly avoids looking at the door until his aunt is hugging him and giving a kiss on the cheek. She brings him back to the present.
“I have to tell you something,” Draco starts and winces as soon as he says it. Merlin, he really should have practiced this beforehand.
Harry feels hands clasp his and he leans into Draco. He freezes when Draco starts to wheeze. His hands move all across Draco’s body and he grimaces when his hand slides messily against the blood drenching his shirt and belts. Hermione comes to sit in front of Draco, her hands reaching for his face.
Draco takes his time and starts pushing back in, letting Harry get used to him before gently pulling back. He wants to be good for Harry so he waits until he feels Harry relax more into it, getting used to Draco, and gods, it’s everything. Harry’s legs wrap around his waist, crowding him.
This, Draco, briefly thinks, is what he’s been missing out on. This is what he’s wanted for months, years, perhaps all along. He runs a hand through Harry’s hair and his heart bursts at how familiar this all feels. He idly remembers how Harry had felt under him, what he tasted like. It feels like no time has passed at all. Draco can’t stop kissing Harry back. Suddenly, Harry breaks the kiss to softly mouth at Draco’s jaw, his neck, the base of his throat, teeth softly grazing his skin before sucking.
After a few more seconds of silence Potter opens the door and slides over. Draco considers it progress.
Draco looks at Potter, noticing the way he’s grimacing at his bloody hand though he says nothing about it. After some time, once they’re sure they’re not being followed, they have no choice but to stop to let the engines cool off. The sun is starting to set and a cool breeze sets in, giving them some respite after a long day.
“We’ve started doing scouts this far out,” she explains, “sometimes Death Eaters make patrols and we’ve had no choice but to assume anyone that isn’t us wants us dead. When we saw the Rig in the distance, we didn’t know what to expect.”
“How are you doing?” Draco asks, quiet, knowing that this could very well be a sore subject for Potter.
“I haven’t felt that feeling ever since...” Harry continues. “And you haven’t been over since that day.”
He lifts his hand with the need to run his finger over the faded patch, but pulls back almost immediately when Potter violently jerks back. There’s a wild look in his eyes and Draco keeps still.
He leans into her arms and hugs her tight. Behind her he sees the Wives, followed by Fleur Delacour, Poppy Pomfrey, and Pomona Sprout.
“Andromeda might have mentioned it,” she simply says, turning a page. “I told her that it wouldn’t be a problem.”
“Go,” Harry tells him and starts pulling away despite how much he hates it. “They need you. I’ll be here.”
“Fuck,” Draco whispers, unable to stop the slow roll of his hips, seeking sweet friction against Harry’s hand. His eyes flutter closed and he bites his lip. He helps Draco undress, pulling his pants down his hips until his cock springs free.
“Harry, darling,” Draco says and sighs when Harry does that thing again with his tongue, drawing out a half-laugh-half-moan from him. He should really get them out of the kitchen.
“Dead. Laid him to rest in the South. Death Eaters murdered him. We just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I found the same scouting party a few months later, led by a woman in black. I couldn’t kill her, but I blinded her in one eye.”
The truck he’s driving is threatening to burst at any second and when Harry looks behind, he can see the large clouds of smoke coming from the enormous gas tank. He needs to get off before he’s engulfed in flames. From the window he sees Ginny and she’s looking straight at him.
Potter shows up at his side fifteen minutes later. He eventually swerves into his path until he cuts Draco off and he has no choice but to come to a stop.
They can’t stop. Whatever happens they have to keep going. He falls back inside, the realization sending something cold and dreadful down his back. It curls into his stomach and makes him sick.
He wraps the throw blanket around himself and opens the window to let the owl in. He takes the envelope tied to their foot and reaches for the bowl of treats he keeps by the window. The owl chirps as they eat and Draco settles back in front of the fireplace. He turns over the envelope addressed to him and he smiles when he recognizes the scrawny print.
Her laugh is vicious and ugly. And she’s fast, catching his fist easily. The punch to his jaw is hard and hurts like hell. He loses his balance and falls back.
Then Harry rolls his hips trying to get more of Draco and smirks when Draco’s breath hitches. He moves his hands to Harry’s hips, holding him still.
He spares a glance down at the driver’s seat and sees Minerva at the wheel. She looks up at him. “Hurry! We’re almost at the Pass.”
The ongoing exhibition celebrates the work of contemporary and conceptual artists. One art piece spans most of the wall space in one room. It features panels of black cutout silhouetted figures across a vast white canvas. In adjourned rooms, small to medium framed drawings hang on the wall in a tight intricate space. They draw a crowd of visitors who take turns to stand in front of the paintings to be able to read and see the details.
“You can touch me, you know,” Draco then says, drawing in a breath as he starts moving his hips. He’s intent on keeping his word: making Harry feel good. At a particularly hard roll of his hips, Harry arches back. He knows he should be watching, wants to watch the way Draco fucks himself so beautifully on his cock, the way his body quivers and shakes. Draco bites his lips and slides his hands down Harry’s chest. It’s almost enough to make Harry come but he can’t. Not yet. He feels his body strung high, his arms straining from where he’s clutching the sheets. He wants to savour this, every twitch of Draco’s hips, every moan Draco doesn’t hold in.
“I love Florence with all my heart. I couldn’t possibly ask you to leave England either! Your family is there. Teddy is there.” Draco knows he’s babbling again because that’s what he always does but Potter is there, the calm to his fierce storm.
At the silence that follows she looks up from her book at Draco and immediately he feels pinned. “There won’t be a problem, right?”
“You decrepit berk, that was one of my expensive ones,” She hisses and slaps his hand away. She eyes the butt of the cigarette and sighs. “Come on, let’s wake up Blaise.”
“Is this enough?” he then asks, sitting in front of the fireplace, watching as Harry gets off the bed and fetches his trousers. He sits next to Draco and picks up the wine bottle and reads the label.
They make their Green Place here at the Citadel. This wasteland, broken and damaged and war-torn as it is, is all they have. It's a slow process trying to undo and pick apart the years and years of patriarchal and tyrannical rule Immortan Lucius kept the Citadel under. Fear is hard to break when that’s all everyone has ever known. They work towards destroying the oppressive power structures holding everyone back.
Draco makes himself useful and lifts the pistol, levels his aim and waits for the perfect shot. One werewolf falls over onto the sand, dead. There’s only one left and it jumps off the Rig and starts running towards a search light, far in the distance from where they came.
He feels for the water hose, clutches it tight and swings hard and it hits the blood bag square in the head. Draco feels his control start to subside, his patience stretched thin ready to snap. It’s like they’re continuing their fight back at the Citadel with no interruptions this time. Fighting again for control like this brings back vivid memories of when Lucius made Draco and other war boys fight for sport. No rules. Just your bare hands, the hard planes of sand, and the single instinct of winning pumping through your veins. His fight with the blood bag goes on like this with a push that turns into a pull—a fight that never ends. It's almost like a dance as if they’re equals.
Potter is practically in his space now and he’s so close. He grabs at the collar of Potter’s sweater, pulling him close until he’s flush against him. He can smell Potter, the hint of cedarwood mixed with the soap Draco keeps in the guest bathroom; the smell of Harry.
“You’ve got more friends,” Potter says, looking at the side mirror. Draco stands up and looks out into the distance, following his line of sight: Lucius.
“Get inside!” Draco yells at them, voice cutting off with a choke as he’s lifted off the ground. A clawed hand closes around his throat with a pressure he’s never felt before, and for a second his vision darkens. He’s slammed against the water tank of the Rig, the air torn out of his heaving lungs. He lifts the pistol and fires, closing his eyes and feeling something warm and wet splatter across his face.
Startled, he almost drops the knife he’s using and whirls around. “Circe, Potter, don’t blame me if you get yourself stabbed next time you sneak up on someone holding a knife.”
After the sun sets they settle in for a long night’s ride. Ginny offers to watch the rear just in case and she disappears through the hatch. Potter sits next to Draco and runs inventory with Pansy. Draco watches them out of the corner of his eye; sees the way Potter mutters quietly to himself while reloading clips and passing bullets to Pansy’s outstretched palm.
In reality, he wasn’t expecting to see Potter until New Years which isn’t that far off. But that’s beside the point.  Potter is inside his house. And now that he’s here... well, Draco’s been raised with good manners.
“I already have plans for lunch,” Draco admits and watches the way Potter nods, trying to cool his expression. “With my mother, you see,” he adds. “But, I was planning on going to the Tate Modern afterward if you wanted to come with me? And then maybe we can get dinner?”
He delays a few seconds before cooling his expression and turning around to see Harry Potter standing at the foot of the stairs. He’s looking at Draco with surprise and a slight smile pulling at his lips.
Of course it’s the war boy with the blood bag but he’s no longer at the front perch. The lancer is nowhere to be seen. Draco reaches for the gun holstered under the dashboard. He considers killing the blood bag first, to put him out of his misery but falters at the last second and he doesn’t know exactly why. Instead he aims at the window once, twice until the window breaks and then the war boy has his hands around his neck, fingers covered in blood. The car swerves away and gets enveloped in dust. As Draco switches gears and accelerates, he allows himself a moment of repose, finally focusing on the open expanse ahead.
“After Carlo’s death, it was hard to stay. I’m more of a consultant these days helping Hermione and Pansy when they need an extra set of eyes. Or sometimes at Hogwarts. I still want to help but in my own way.”
When he presses on Harry’s prostate, Harry arches off the bed, hands grabbing at the sheets, and his thighs start to tremble.
When the sun comes up he trades places with Potter again. After a few hours of silence, he hears muttering and sees Potter twitch in his sleep. He wakes, violently shaking, his fist raised as if ready to defend himself. A nightmare. Draco knows the signs all too well. He doesn’t move. He keeps still and waits until Potter’s eyes land on him and he recognizes what he sees, waits until Potter knows that he is safe.
She gives Draco a smirk and he narrows his eyes, daring him to say something now. Instead, she leans in for a kiss on the cheek and a hug and Draco opens his arms.
“Put down the wine, mother,” Draco later says, offering his hand to his mother. She looks at him, surprised. “Dance with me.”
He’s clearing the sand off the front of the hood of the Rig when he hears the screams. Alarmed, he slowly walks around the Rig until he sees them huddled together. The water hose now long forgotten at their feet, spitting out water. They stopped after the storm to clear the sand off the Rig and their clothes. He follows their line of sight and in the distance he sees a figure approaching them. His eyes widen when he recognizes them and sees that they’re carrying a body over their shoulders.
He climbs off and walks with Potter until they see which tires are embedded in the mud. The others are already awake, climbing out of the Rig. Luna wanders off and Draco watches her, notices the way she is staring out into the distance, into nothingness.
Harry gets some leverage as he plants his feet flat against the bed, pulls Draco up and fucks into him hard and steady. Draco sobs and falls forward. He rests a hand against the bed, next to Harry’s head.
Draco finds that he doesn’t want to lie to Potter. Somehow talking about it with him feels right, as if he would understand. A road warrior like himself. Running away from the Citadel and taking the Wives with him had felt just, as if he was righting a wrong. He’s done things he isn’t proud of. All done in Lucius’ name.
to please Draco. And Draco’s smile makes his heart soar. He lets go and gives his control and everything to Draco, knows that his heart and soul are safe with him, always.
They hear screams and see two werewolves on the roof of the Rig, trying to get inside. He watches as one tears into the metal roof of the Rig and easily pulls back the metal like torn fabric. Draco can’t run. He tries, but it falls flat, his leg locking in place. It’s enough to make him dizzy. Potter tries to reload his pistol but he drops a bullet. His blood soaked hands are shaking and he curses under his breath.
“What about your knee?” Harry says, lovingly running his hand across Draco’s knee, fingers touching the hard ridges of tissue.
He looks up and catches the wrench Ginny tosses to him and slams it down hard, narrowly missing the blood bag’s head. Pain blossoms in his skull as he’s headbutted hard. When his vision focuses he sees that the blood bag is falling backwards helplessly, dragged across the sand by the Wives who pull hard on the chain still tied to his muzzle. Draco stands and grabs the blood bag by the muzzle and whirls him hard against the water tank.
He can feel Potter’s eyes watching him as he works and finds it oddly comforting. Teddy shows up not too long after, practically bursting at the seams wanting to go outside and play in the snow. And who is Draco to deny him that? He’s working on buttoning up Teddy’s winter coat when Potter reaches for his jacket from the coat rack.
In the Turbine Hall, they walk around a large fountain installation piece. A museum tour guide is also taking a group of visitors around the fountain. They listen along and Draco explains in hushed tones the heavy historical and cultural references.
The Rock Riders live in the Canyons, a bandit clan, having settled to the far east of the Citadel. Normally crossing into their territory is forbidden and considered trespassing, but desperate measures called for Draco to sneak out one night many moons ago to make a deal. He’s broken from his thoughts as they get closer, and he lets his doubts roll off his back. He covers his forehead in grease and oil; the markings of higher ranking officers from the Citadel, and turns back and looks at the others.
“Lay him down,” Hermione says and Harry lifts Draco, hating the way he protests, weak and barely conscious.
“Well, invitations were sent out earlier this year and we’ve been working with the commissioners and artists on their works. Mind you, there’s still a lot to be done. I’m due back in Venice later this week to present our curatorial statement. To the muggle board of directors, if you will.”
In the living room, everyone sat on couches, love seats, and the floor around the coffee table. Luna, Daphne, Hermione, and Ron are sitting around the coffee table and playing a very serious game of Exploding Snap.
Harry isn’t afraid of heights he’s just not used to them. He feels uneasy being at the top of the Citadel. Despite how lovely everything looks from up there and how much he feels at home surrounded by the crops and plants. As long as Luna or Draco is up there with him, Harry doesn’t panic as much, doesn’t feel this fleeting feeling of being in free fall.
“Circe, Harry, of course. Who do you take me for? The last thing I want is my family to hear us,” he says as he finishes the last of the charms and drops his wand on the vanity table. He reaches for Harry’s trousers and starts undoing the buttons. He barely gets the zipper down when he slides his hands down Harry’s pants and touches his cock, already hard and wanting. Harry hisses when he feels Draco’s fingers close around his cock to give a lazy stroke from tip to bollocks.
He takes one final look around before he turns his back. A second later, the sound of bike engines roar everywhere and Draco’s surrounded. The first Rock Rider appears at the top, over a ridge.
“Honestly? Just about the same,” Blaise admits. “In two days I get to marry my fiancée and have all my friends in attendance. I’m more surprised that I’m taking this better than Ginny. The dress came in. She and Harry came back from the tailor yesterday morning. I couldn’t possibly spoil anything by being home so I joined Pansy out for brunch.”
They settle into a comfortable silence as they eat. Draco offers the platter of the frost-covered cakes while Potter pushes forward the bowl of fruits.
“There,” Ginny then says, standing, and Draco looks down at his leg. “I was able to stop the bleeding. And at least it won’t get infected... as far as that kind of thing goes around out here,” she quickly adds and smirks. The wound isn’t completely closed but it’s close enough and Draco feels loads better. He eyes the claw marks that had torn his skin. She whispers words that he doesn’t understand, a language that she and the others learned in the books Miss Sybill kept.
“Why can’t you stop? What have you done?” he shouts when Draco says nothing. His grip on Draco’s throat is tight and it makes him choke, but he keeps himself grounded and throws a punch to Ace’s face instead, his knuckles coming back full of blood. He narrowly has time to duck before the war boy driving next to the Rig shoots at him.
Draco appreciates Luna in such a special way because of how often she checks in on his mother. He would never be able to truly thank Luna for her efforts. His mother gave him her blessing to leave, but not without a look of sadness at her only son leaving. And that stayed with Draco. Some nights it got too hard to bear, knowing that his mother tended to an empty home. It brought him a sense of peace knowing that his aunt Andromeda and Teddy spent some of their days at the Manor with his mother and eventually some of his friends too. Every so often when he visited, she threw a dinner party or two. The first dinner party was when he came back after he graduated from his studies in Italy. With his friends and family present, being back to the Manor wasn’t so hard.
Arthur Weasley walks her down the aisle with grace. Draco watches the way Blaise and Ginny look at each other, grinning like they’re sharing an inside joke.
He leans his forehead against Harry’s and catches the little sighs pouring out of him with every thrust. Draco loves him so much, wants Harry like this all the time. He wants to be close to Harry in every way.
Blaise is getting married on Saturday and Draco is his best man. Though they live in separate countries now, the two are still close and Draco loves him dearly. He remembers that he was mildly surprised when Blaise first told him, three years ago, that he had started seeing Ginerva Weasley.
“Draco,” Potter says softly, “I have wanted you in any way that I could. In every single way, you could offer.”
“Merlin, Potter, I’m only thorough when I’m pissed out of my wits. Once you get me going on my work, I can’t seem to shut up.”
“Come on. Grab some of those treats we made such a fuss about,” Blaise says and leads him back out to the living room.
The first time Harry took a bite of his own, he didn’t know how to explain what he was tasting. It’s sweet, so sweet, and the juice fills his mouth and it’s not unpleasant. It’s completely new but he doesn’t hate it. He thinks it might be the best thing he’s ever tasted in his life.
Potter smiles and holds his hands up in surrender. He doesn’t look in the slightest sorry at all. “Sorry.”
He walks to the War Rig and opens the door and climbs inside. The other war boys and lancers get into position. Immortan Lucius appears not a second too late. Draco looks up and watches him, sees the way he points down to the stragglers of the Citadel as if they are vermin. He can hear all too clearly the disappointment in his father’s voice. Lucius stares down at them all, his blond hair wild, thin and frayed blowing in the wind. His white robes dotted with metal pins and other trinkets he’s stolen and claimed for his own, and of course, the large belt that holds the metal brand of the Citadel: a skull with a snake coming out of its open mouth.
He then moves so that he’s kissing along the side of Draco’s collarbone, lips stopping at the first scar on his chest and moving as it spreads into two, three scarred lines. He takes his time, leaving kisses and touches all over Draco’s chest and ribs, through smooth and rough skin. Arousal flares and shoots to his cock when he feels Draco’s hands in his hair, giving a soft pull. Harry moves until he’s kneeling in between Draco’s legs. He hums, content as if he’s exactly where he belongs.
Potter looks the same, hair wild at the top with a few longer curls covering his scar. He’s wearing a jumper and dark jeans because of course he is and, god, he realizes he's staring when Potter frowns a little. It’s hard not to. It’s been five years and somehow Draco still finds himself speechless when it comes to Potter. He’s always managed to roll into Draco’s life like a bombshell. He hopes he’s not being too obvious, but also expects Potter to call him out on it. He always did.
“Not nearly enough to make life perfect.” Draco says and there’s a profound bitterness to his voice. To Lucius it was always about what they could do with the Wives, a means to exploit their power. It was never about what the Wives could possibly want.
The question doesn’t throw him off, but it does send him down a spiral of what-ifs. He thinks of what he’s missed out on if he did and finds regret settling deep in the pit of his stomach.
“Look,” Potter says, meeting Draco’s gaze. “It won’t be easy. Some of us might not make it. But I guarantee you, 160 miles driving down those plains... there’s nothing but salt. At least—” he pauses and Draco feels that thing again. “At least this way, the both of us can find some kind of redemption. Together.”
At that he presses forward, speeding up a little until he sees Draco and he looks at Harry. His eyes are glassy and pale. Paler than Harry’s ever seen him. Harry feels something akin to worry and rage. It’s a feeling he’s all too familiar with, has lived with it most of his life. Knowing that something is wrong with Draco is more than enough to keep him going. Getting separated from the Rig means that he spends a great deal fighting his way to climb back aboard. Easier said than done though when everyone wants you dead.
He steals a moment to admire Harry like this, looking so at peace and so content. His linen shirt is open with two buttons undone and some of his chest hair peeks out. His sleeves rolled up to his forearms.
He lifts Draco again and looks at him; his full lips, pointed nose and closed eyelids full of grease and oil. Beautiful. Worth protecting. His hands have snapped necks and have taken so many lives, but he holds Draco ever so softly, like he is life itself.
Once they’ve moved the Rig forward there is a small burst of fire in the distance. The crows circling them fly away, screeching into the night. Draco looks out the window. He waits a minute or two but it feels like hours. He welcomes the rush of relief when he sees Potter again. The relief turns into something else and it makes him want to hold it close to his chest.
His profound appreciation for muggle art and art, in general, became a renewed curiosity after the war when he moved to Florence. He stands in front of portrait paintings that take him back to the days when he first walked these halls. He walks into a new room, a part of a new site-specific creation. Every surface and corner of the gallery room is covered in a brilliant and deep cobalt blue. The centerpiece in this room is a large portrait of a Black woman. Gold, blue, and black are the dominant hues along the painting.
Draco isn’t sure how much of a head start he has before Lucius finds out his Wives are gone, but he keeps driving. There’s no turning back now. In the far distance he can see the Canyons. Not too long after, one of the war boys spots scouts from the Rockies.
In the kitchen, they find breakfast served by Tinsy. Blaise was right. The sunlight coming through the windows is gorgeous. Draco rests his hands around a warm tea mug and closes his eyes and lets sunlight caress him.
Draco closes his eyes and hates himself for how his heart skips a beat at that. Leave it to Pansy to always know where to strike hard and fast.
He rummages through the compartment again until he pulls a tubing string and two needles. The rest of them watch him work and he quietly thanks Hermione when she helps him pull back his own sleeve so that he can slide the needle into his arm.
Then, Draco's mind betrays him and he's reminded of mornings in Florence, of the feeling of waking up with Potter in his arms. He remembers the feel of Potter’s hands in his hair while they sat out in the fields with Florence on the horizon. He's reminded of how beautiful Potter looked sitting at the windowsill of his bedroom. He's reminded of how the morning sunlight shined off him so beautifully, a view of the Arno behind him.
Draco looks back at the others and what he sees he can only describe as hope. It’s more than enough to convince him. Draco turns back to Potter and looks down at his outstretched hand. He takes it and clasps it without hesitation.
He wonders if Potter remembers these moments as much as he does. He allows himself to have this one thing if only for a night. Come tomorrow, things will go back to the way they’ve been.
Draco knows what to expect at the dinner party later tonight. He knows that he can’t bail no matter what. It still doesn’t make getting ready any easier. He settles on a cashmere sweater with dark trousers. The trench coat is a little overkill but he wears it anyway. He knows that he won’t be the most over dressed. He decides at the last minute to walk from his hotel. It's a nice night out. He finds an alleyway to duck into later to disapparate onto the street of Blaise and Ginny’s home.
“The only parent I’ve ever known was my mother. Now that I drive a War Rig, I’m never going to have a better chance.”
“I have always wanted you even if I lied to myself about it,” Draco adds, quietly. He opens his eyes and Harry is watching him, patiently. “I was so afraid.”
Potter doesn’t wait for Draco and starts walking. Draco watches him leave until he sees nothing but fog.
“I’m sure you will find something,” his mother answers and goes back to her book. Draco knows then that the conversation is over. He turns and leaves and swears that he sees the faintest hint of a smile on his mother’s face.
“They flipped over when we hit the rocks. I think they were afraid that I might have fallen and gone under the wheels.”
Just then, she lifts her other hand and he feels the cold press of the barrel of a gun at the side of his head. There's a loud bang, followed by the ringing in his ears as he falls. He can hear more laughter in the distance. He’s still alive.
“Out here everything hurts,” Draco says, smiling when she laughs. It doesn’t quite reach her eyes. She then gets up and softly cards her fingers through his hair before she walks towards Potter.
When Draco looks up he sees that Ginny has moved ahead, having ignored the fight completely completely. She’s reaching for the door of the Rig when two more warning shots are fired, one grazing her leg.
. In such an enclosed space, they move around each other like a well oiled machine. He opens the sunroof and stands and the rifle is there again, waiting and he takes it from Potter. One by one he takes down the Riders as fast as he can. He sees one to his right, ready to throw a smoke bomb inside the Rig when Potter gets to him first.
“Keep them off me,” Draco yells and keeps his course. It gets dirty and deadly fast, but Ace and the lancers are still by his side and that’s not for nothing. They’ve survived countless raids and ambushes.
"You never ask, dear. Besides it's the Manor," his mother replies like that's enough answer. It isn't but she has a point.
Later before they settle in for the night, he finds Potter again. He doesn’t plead, doesn’t think it’ll work that way, but finds himself wanting to nonetheless.
Neither of them said anything when Draco slowly started leaving his things at Harry’s. The spare toothbrush followed by a change of clothes. The specific quills and pens he loved he started leaving in the study. By the beginning of spring, he had also left one of his favorite mugs in the cupboard. Harry had also kept all the postcards Draco sent him. The fridge was covered in them along with colorful drawings that Teddy drew growing up. Harry had been right, Grimmauld Place was starting to feel like home. On the days when he stayed over, he could feel that the house felt more luminous. He could see it on Harry’s face when they napped on the couch. Sometimes he would walk into the parlor and see that the windows were already open, letting a slight breeze flow through and sunlight shine through the pale curtains.
Potter crawls so that he's out of sight and fits through the hatch. He moves down so that just his shoulders and head are visible as Draco slows the Rig down. “This is the sequence to turn on the Rig,” Draco says. Potter is still looking at him, watching. “You might have to drive if this goes sideways,” he says, and taps his fingers against toggle switches under the dashboard.
As usual, he has an escort led by one of his lieutenants, Ace. Assigned to protect the War Rig but most especially the supply they ran. He’s never failed Draco. They bring along a couple of pursuit vehicles with lancers to make sure they don't get raided by the other clans that cross over into their territory. Nothing Draco can’t handle.
He's out of time. He doesn’t know who speaks first, him or the Riders, but he’s yelling Potter’s name and running fast. The Rig comes to life, engine roaring mixed in with the sound of gunfire.
Their hands touch when Potter reaches for the glass, his fingers warm against Draco’s, but it’s gone within a second. He waits for a verdict, watching Potter take a sip.
“We’re going to the Green Place,” she tells the blood bag. She holds out the bolt cutters and he takes them, finally freeing himself. He throws the bolt cutters and climbs inside the Rig.
“Lest you find yourself choking on crumbs while eating, lying down like that,” Draco chastises and sighs when Harry sticks out his tongue.
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, smiling and wraps his arms around Harry and hugs him tight. He’ll never get over how perfectly Draco fits in his arms. “Rest now, you’re home.”
“I’m serious!” Potter says, laughing when Draco narrows his eyes. “It’s fantastic. What you do, I mean. Andromeda sometimes brings in a copy of your column whenever she comes over for tea. Though she doesn’t know that by then I’ve already read it. She’s been helping with translating.”
He helps Draco undress, fingers softly pulling his pants down his hips until his cock springs free. His eyes trail down Draco’s body and his hands move over his legs, thighs, and then his knees. He leans down and presses a soft kiss to the side of his left knee, mouth lightly tracing the marred skin before sliding up to the inside of his thigh.
They could make it out of this alive and without spilling a single ounce of blood, if they just stay still and keep quiet. Easier said than done, though. The one in front of Draco trots past him, smelling the air and starts to growl, the noise rippling from its chest, deep and hollow.
He gets up, stumbles just a little, and glares at the lot of them when they cheer him on. He goes about setting new glasses on a tray, hands going on autopilot. He decides to make something with gin.
He then realizes that Potter’s looking at him again with that crooked smile and Draco realizes he’s been staring. He has to look away, feeling his face go hot. He clears his throat and motions toward the adjoining room. “Shall we?”
Harry leans up, book now forgotten, and looks at Draco for a few seconds. When he meets Harry's eyes, he sees hope and love. He sees his future, the only future he wants. When Harry realizes what Draco means, he breaks out into a grin, wide and so happy. This is what convinces Draco that this is where he belongs. This is who he needs to be with for the rest of his life because nothing else brings him this much happiness. Harry’s smile. It puts the sun to shame.
“I know it’s a little overkill but, well, there’s plenty of food left,” Draco then adds after moments of silence and dread.
Draco watches, body frozen as they snap their jaws, full of teeth and impossibly wide. They make a run towards the Rig. They run on all fours and another low keening cry rips out of their throats again. They come to a stop at the tracks, their snouts pushing against the mud, sniffling loudly.
“Something in the eyes,” Pomona observes, looking at him and Draco’s vision blurs with tears. “Perhaps it is Narcissa’s child.”
A rage so potent and pure swells up in Draco’s chest that gives him a second wind. The thought comes to him easily and materializes itself clear as day—as if this is what it was always going to come down to: Lucius dies today.
“Great,” Draco says and means it. He hangs Potter’s coat and motions to the hall. “I’ll set you up in my study if you don’t mind.”
“I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be around others,” Potter says after, quietly. He looks down at his hands. “Being with you made me feel something I didn’t think I had in me anymore.”
Harry’s hand comes up to his neck, resting at the collar of his shirt before a thumb softly rubs against his skin. Draco opens his mouth and fuck, Harry’s tongue always knew how to make Draco come undone. He feels a shiver go down his spine along with arousal starting to pool around his groin. He moves his hands to Harry’s waist. Harry gives him an experimental roll of his hips that has Draco breathing hard against the kiss. He’s pushed against the counter.
He looks back out to the Rig and watches as the rest of the Wives and Vuvalini make their way across. Bellatrix moves to follow them but Minerva slams on the brakes and creates some distance between the two vehicles. Harry watches as Poppy looks at the Rig, at Minerva, and lifts her arm out as if grasping something and pulls it back close to her chest. The Rig violently swerves and flips over. The last thing Harry sees is Bellatrix’s body go under the wheels. What’s left of the Pass crumbles into dust, fire, and smoke.
Draco leans forward and soft lips are there to catch his and it’s everything. Kissing Harry again after all this time, so easy and so familiar. His heart thrums against his ribcage and he sighs when Harry bites his lower lip before running a tentative tongue over it. Nothing was ever shy between them. This time, Draco takes what Harry was always willing to offer.
“You’d be relying on the gratitude of a very bad man,” Draco continues. “You’ve already damaged one of his Wives. He won’t be so forgiving.”
“Look out!” Pansy shouts and Draco looks up to see jagged rocks straight ahead. He pulls the spanner to the right, but it’s too late. The impact slams Draco into Potter as the Rig hits the rocks. He has a brief moment of horrible sheer panic as it dawns on him that Ginny was still outside. He looks back and doesn’t see her. The door is knocked loose and hanging off its hinges. He stands again and looks out from the roof. There's a cloud of smoke and fire back at the rocks and as it clears, Draco sees the upturned undercarriage of Lucius' vehicle and the guzzoline pod going up in flames.
Potter extends a hand to Pansy and she takes one more look at Draco and she smiles, but it doesn't quite reach her eyes. Draco hates her for it.
“After you left, I felt this sense of calmness and happiness. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it’s true. That night the house felt complete. It went away the following morning. Ever since then it’s gone back to its normal feeling: hollow and depressing. I know it’s not Pansy because she’s been over at my house loads of times ever since then.”
“F—fuck,” Harry breathes out, body tensing, throwing his head back. The hand in Draco’s hair gives him a little hard tug. “Gonna make me come like this.”
“Once again, we send off my War Rig to bring back guzzoline from Gas Town, and bullets from the Bullet Farm. Once again, I salute my Imperator Draco!” Lucius’ voice booms. He can feel Lucius’ eyes on him, and he feels sick. “And I salute my half-life war boys who will ride eternal with me on the highways of Valhalla.”
They end up talking about a lot of things, some things that he will remember the morning after and others that he won’t. It’s so late that sleep comes to them so easily after they settle back in bed. Draco presses himself against Harry, with his chest to Harry’s back. He presses a soft kiss to Harry’s hair as he moves so that he’s flush against Draco. Harry finds Draco's hand and links their fingers, his thumb rubs against Draco’s knuckles with soft strokes. He waits until Harry’s breathing evens out when he’s sure that he’s fast asleep.
“Touch me, Harry,” Draco pants and he does. He grips Draco’s ass tight and starts snapping his hips up.
He hears shuffling and he can tell Potter has sat next to him. They stay there in comfortable silence. Draco doesn’t know why exactly Potter is here, but he appreciates the gesture all the same.
“Not bad,” he breathes out harshly, feeling sand between his teeth when he bites down a groan. “For a blood bag.”
“Harry,” he whimpers, his fingers going from gentle to tugging hard. He slides down Draco’s cock until he can feel Draco’s pubic hair softly nestling against his nose. He breathes harshly when Draco rolls his hips, body jerking when Harry relaxes his jaw.
“I thought you weren’t arriving until tomorrow!” she says, pulling back after kissing him on each cheek. Draco’s very aware that Potter is watching them but he doesn’t dare look at him, couldn’t bring himself to.
The wedding is as beautiful as Draco could have imagined it. He keeps the wedding bands close to his heart until it’s time for the bride and groom to exchange their vows. Ginny looks incredible, wearing a gown that compliments her so well, with a beautiful opening at the back. Her auburn hair was braided and styled into an elegant updo.
Later, Draco feels himself on the tether of falling asleep. Harry lazily runs his fingers up and down his back.
“An Imperator who lets their guard down next to their own Rig?” a voice says right next to his ear and Draco bristles. Something about the voice tugs on feelings long buried deep in his chest.
It’s like taking a breath. He clears his mind and calms his breathing. He’s in his element here, doing this. Potter stands perfectly still. When he has what he wants in his sights, Draco pulls the trigger. Through the scope he sees that he’s pierced the werewolf and it lets out a horrible yowl before it drops, body spasming. He lifts the rifle, cradles it close and smiles slightly when Potter shakes his head.
