“I’m not drinking your blood,” Harry said vehemently, and it was almost enough to make Draco’s lips slip into a smile.
“I wish I was. If only I could tell myself it was all in my imagination... but it wasn't. The guards and Aurors in Azkaban were worse than Dementors, and that should mean something to you. The Dark Lord was evil, but he never did – “
“Listen, I know this is a little awkward, but it really shouldn’t be. So Harry and Malfoy are dating now, that’s absolutely fine. We just need to get used to that.”
of this.
“Potter, you idiot,” Malfoy whispered, his eyes wide and angry. “Who else knows? Tell me!”
“I never – I could never imagine – fuck, Malfoy. Fuck it all to hell. I can’t believe that…”
“Come on, work doesn’t count and you know it.” Potter stretched luxuriously on the bench, still keeping a good distance between them, the considerate prat. “You need to spend time outside-outside, too. I know it’s scary, trust me, I get it. But no one can do anything to you, all right? You’re safe. I’m here.”
“And I’m meant to, what, believe you?” he scoffed, which was a fair point.
Potter gave it a moment, blowing air in his cheeks, looking adorably chipmunk-ish. “No, I don’t think so. I mean I used to have nightmares about it all the time after the war. That he somehow survived, that there was another way for him, another threat… but no. The body of Lord Voldemort is dead, and his soul – whatever that was – is also. I'm certain of it. A hundred percent.”
He opened his mouth, then closed it again. “You know what? I don’t think you’d want to know.” He chuckled at the stunned look Ron gave him.
There was silence for a few seconds, during which Harry felt pretty queasy. Then Snape gasped. “Did you – Draco, did you get
Draco wanted to protest, but he couldn’t. He wanted to shout, but he couldn’t. And when the man placed a hand on his hip, Draco knew what it felt like to die, because that’s what he was. He was dying. This was death.
“Fuck that, Potter, you're important to me too! I’ve grown to bloody – I mean, look at all this! I didn’t very well plan this, did I? And look at me now!”
“No,” Potter said, in a tone that implied that was that.
"Right, no, I must be confusing you with some other, goody-two-shoes twat of a hero that kept getting me in trouble."
Oh, hell, it was all too much. “What are you even talking about? Harry, why did you come here?”
! I’ll do it! I’ll do it! please, whatever you want, whatever he wants, I’ll do it! just don’t – please, don’t!”
Draco couldn't speak, so he let his eyes answer, saying
Draco nodded and did not look at him. “Every single night. Snape gave me so much Dreamless Sleep, I probably reeked of the stuff. It didn’t help though. I’d always wake up and know I've been dreaming of him.”
. Well, he didn’t feel ready. He didn’t feel righteous or cool or particularly courageous. The only emotion he was aware of was of being pissed off.
It lasted until about lunchtime. By one in the afternoon Draco began to feel giddy. He had no idea if Potter will be coming tonight or not. He had no idea when He will be back. He had no idea about anything at all in this life, and it was getting him awfully unsteady. The need for routine was very nearly overwhelming. How long was he meant to be left like this, alone, uncertain? How long was He going to keep away? Surely it couldn’t be
carry on a fucking conversation. “I don’t really follow it anymore, but Harry here is a huge Harpies fan. He listens to all the games. Oh, and call me Draco.”
“I wasn’t suggesting... that, exactly.”
“Hush, it’s all right. We help each other, right? We can both help each other.” Potter’s hand lay on the bed between them, asking, and Draco placed his right next to it, almost touching. He wanted to believe they can do that. “You saved my life, so I get to try and help now, right? it’s only fair.”
Draco detached himself from Harry and looked up at him, but not quite in the eye. “I thought he wanted to make me better. Everything he did – I thought it was because he wanted to help me. To make me worthy of my name.” He gave a small, sarcastic laughter. “I suppose he missed the mark on that one.”
“I won’t hurt you,” Harry hummed in agreement. His voice was smooth and sunny too. Draco exhaled heavily.
“Why, are you sorry they beat you to it?” the boy grimaced, nostrils flaring. “It’s not your concern, Potter.”
“He’s still not letting you have it?” Harry asked incredulously. It was just such an inconceivable thing to do, to take someone’s wand away from them. He could just as well have taken Malfoy’s arm; the wand was a part of him, if not the most important part.
Something was beating quite wildly in his chest, and Draco couldn’t tell for a second if it was his heart or something else, something dangerous. “But I’m… I’m me, Harry.” (and Harry deserved so much more. And he wanted him to have so much more).
“How would you like me to prove it to you, stupid boy? Your friend is all the way back in the drawing room. Come back with me and you will see.”
Harry’s smile grew a little warmer. “I’m really sorry for putting you in this situation, Malfoy. I can only imagine how much it sucks.”
It took two whole minutes and immense effort, but Harry managed to unglue his eyes from Draco’s
commit it. I actually… well, I actually did.”
“Right. But you’re… not together anymore?” the question was careful, Potter’s tone was soft, but the words still tore a hole in his chest. For a moment he couldn’t even bring himself to shake his head.
Draco shrugged, for what else could he do? He knew he’s not enough to change Potter’s mind. It didn’t truly matter, either, for he knew and had already paid the price for the truth. “I rather think a Chimera-Sphinx would be a better pet than me, anyway. Far deadlier.”
Hermione caught him when everyone went to the garden for a drink. “Draco, hey. Do you have a minute?”
“With you,” he said before he could really think of it. He cleared his throat and lowered his gaze to the floor, a little embarrassed. “I, er, want to eat with you. Here is fine.”
There was silence for a second when each of them was looking elsewhere. “Well that’s bloody wise of him,” Ron said finally. “Like you’ve been suggesting all along, but I guess it’s good he’s finally catching on.”
Harry looked at Ron and Hermione. “Sounds like a simple plan, no? Go in, grab her at her room, go back out. In and out before anyone notices.”
“It did? But why? I mean, if he just wanted to give you the task of killing me…” he paused when he saw the effect his words had on the blond. Draco shook hard and his eyes darted to the floor.
what an idiot, he should have known from the start; Harry had been spending an hour here, a couple of hours there in Scotland for months now. The cold air up the cliff had him breathless for a moment, and then when he could spare a thought to looking, he still couldn’t breathe. The previously-hovel Harry had purchased was… well. Not a hovel anymore.
Draco didn’t even know what he was talking about anymore, and of course that wasn’t what he thought, but he didn’t know how to take it back, either. Not without betraying Him completely, and he’s done enough of that already. “That’s not what I – you’re missing my point, Potter.”
“No,” Potter shook his head, and he raised himself a little on the bed. “No, you shouldn’t – not on the floor.”
“I have to go,” he said, getting to his feet.
, this whole entire place, this flat that had seen him so unhappy, this flat that meant the world to him and that kept him a prisoner – it all had to
At some point they started playing exploding cards, but both boys were too tired and content, and ended up lying right back on the sofa and staring at the snowflakes dancing outside the window.
He could see, despite the low light and his general hysteria, the myriad of cell-cages just like his.
“I’m so sorry, I thought he’d just send an owl back, I never thought he’d actually…“
The iron curtain was gone, but it didn’t shatter him. He’d been through the worst night of his life, the one he never expected to be able to survive again, but he had. He even went ahead and was cheeky to Him, which proved he was mad, but also meant something else. Every obstacle Draco thought he couldn’t handle tonight, he did. Everything he thought will kill him – well, didn’t. He was still alive, wasn’t he? Suffering so beautifully. He did it, he went through it, he was punished, and he came out the other side.
Draco couldn't blame his father, either. Not anymore. It was never actually his fault, and Lucius could not pay more than he already has, anyway. After everything that's happened... Draco couldn't even bring himself to think about him. No, he left all that behind; the second he made it out of Azkaban Draco vowed never to look back, and never once asked about his father. It was easier to believe Lucius was dead. But see, what was he doing now, thinking about it? No good. Back to something else.
“Let me take you to your father,” Bellatrix said with a strange expression. “I’m sure he will explain it all to you. Or perhaps you’d like me to call another friend of mine to really make you understand…” Harry knew immediately who she meant. And to think that she would do that to Draco – threaten her own nephew with that terrible monster – brought him dangerously close to his senses.
“There’s not many things a summer of torture and fear won’t change in you,” Malfoy said with a smile, but Harry knew he wasn’t kidding. He swallowed hard. “Oh, lighten up. It was only a few beatings, nothing I’ve not taken before.” He continued walking upwards, and Harry followed. Now he was gaping for sure.
Malfoy sighed and gave him a good look. “You’ve not been sleeping either? What’s bothering you?”
Potter didn’t take his peace-offering. “Draco, about what’s happened earlier. We don’t have to talk about it, but – “
I'd love to tell you to just skip the whole part in the middle. There's not going to be many hints in it to who He is, or actions that are crucial to the plot or anything. It's just a really long, really difficult emotional process, without which - well - the emotional component of this story won't really make sense. It might still not with it, too, but chances are it will work better. If you're worried about any of the triggers I've mentioned in the tags, do skip it though. If you feel brave but only, like, so-so, maybe only read every second bit (it'll make sense when you're in it). You can also read the end first. I - no, that's it, I've got no more suggestions. I really am sorry about this chapter, but it is the lowest point, rock bottom, absolute darkest. It will get better from here, can't not. It's physically impossible.
There was tension in the way Draco nodded. A mighty amount of it. “I… yes, I do know him. He came to the Manor a couple of times, the summer before seventh year. He was there to… confer with the Dark Lord.”
Harry wants to help. He really, really does. So what if Malfoy isn't exactly letting him?
he knew,
“Come on, be serious, you know it wasn’t you. I should never have let you believe it. I
“Why? Can you not think for yourself why? Are you really this dim, or are you just incredibly naïve?”
“I think he is trying to teach me,” he said quietly, watching the embers crackle and gleam. “With this whole thing with you. I think he’s trying to show me something, to… teach me something I need to know. Something about kindness, and forgiveness, and – and love.” He felt his cheeks burn, but he was pretty sure he was right. Didn’t the headmaster practically tell him that last year? That his greatest power he possessed over Voldemort is love?
“You… do?” Draco’s eyebrows knitted comically high on his forehead. “There’s a lot, Harry. A lot. And I don’t know if… telling you doesn’t mean I’d be ready for, I don’t know. A trial, or something. Not – not now, anyway.”
? He looked like a dead man, only much, much worse.
“Don’t be absurd,” Draco rolled his eyes, winded for some reason. “Of course I don’t need you to – I said I was going to trust you, didn’t I? It’s just, I… I don’t know if I… can.”
“I thought I will die,” Draco answered plainly. This was the only outcome he could foresee, from the very beginning when he decided to take Harry’s side. What else could have happened? Surely there was no other possibility.
“I want to see you. Your body. If – if you want to show me.”
Potter shook his head. “Never said it was. I know people aren’t two-dimensional.”
inside him… Draco crawled into a tiny little ball on the floor, feeling pathetic and disgusting and as miserable as he ever had. He wanted to roar. He wanted to spread out huge black wings and breathe fire over the whole city. He wanted to scream, to shout so loud they’d hear him in Hogwarts and in Azkaban and in bloody Dubai. He wanted them all to know, and he wanted them all to pay for it. For what they’ve
, it was all really happening. Potter really was there, with his bloody Potteriness that was so enchanting and frustrating simultaneously. His Potter. There were absolutely no words Draco could use to describe what it did to him. He could scoff in disbelief all he wanted, but the truth was there in the green eyes. It practically screamed at him every time Potter smiled.
“No – not Him. The guard. The one who – who had me apologize.”
“It’s… er… hmm.” Potter looked at him, questioning. Draco accidentally poked himself with the needle. “It’s about someone you know. A good thing, though. Do you want me to read it?”
“But you still carry the poison with you.” Draco thought he might die here and now if Potter doesn’t stop staring at him like this. “Do you think you’d ever - ?”
. Draco wanted to cry the whole time. And then when he flinched away from his reaching hand, like a total prick – as if hand-holding wasn’t something they did all the time now, as if he was scared Harry would
“All while keeping him alive,” Draco concurred. “Because thanks to me, He had Harry in His pocket as well.”
“Tell who what?” Draco begged. Potter’s eyes were huge and apologetic and they looked around frantically.
“What can I do, Malfoy. They don’t call me Golden Boy for nothing.” This remark helped rekindle some of the glint in the grey eyes. Harry noticed that in the light of the fire, they looked very silvery. He choked a little and turned his gaze on something else, anything else really. “So, have you, er, been able to eat recently?”
me. I am a dead man, Potter, whether you choose to accept it or not. The months I’ve spent totally humiliating myself – throwing myself at your feet – torturing myself in every possible way – they will all go to waste if you die. Everything I had gone through, everything I’ve suffered, it was all in the end for your sake. How dare you throw all that away and say it is for me? How
Draco couldn’t stop his lips from forming tear-choked words of gratitude. He would have kissed the Dark Lord’s robes but moving was impossible.
clawing even harder at himself. “What he did, it was very, I – “
“Harry, I know you didn’t want to hear it before, and I understand if you aren’t ready to hear it now, but you must know it is true. I care about you so much.”
“You must understand,” He said, this time to Draco. “After what happened – after that night when you finally started seeing reason – I’m afraid the damage Lucius suffered had been… irreparable.” He looked at Lucius’s empty eyes. “He went out of his mind. Tried to attack Parker – actually put him in a coma for a couple of months. He was a danger to himself and to others, Draco. I had no choice. I had to remove his memories.”
happens, I will always want to be your friend. If we break up I might be a little sullen, it might be awkward for a bit, I won’t lie. But once someone’s in, they’re in for life with me. Hell, even Ginny and I are talking again. You know that… you know I always come back.”
Draco’s cheeks burned red-red, darker than the wine. “Oh,” was his very elegant response.
of his heart in his ears. Weird, how that thing travels in his body. One would think it would stay put, but it was all over the place; flooding his mouth with bitterness, wild in his chest, heavy in his abdomen, raucous in his head. Surprisingly, his hand did not tremble at all as he pulled the knife out of the sleeve and took a deep breath. He can’t do it, but he will. It didn’t even take courage, now. His hand was already in motion, the forces of inertia would take care of it. It was out of his hands now.
“What – “ Snape was the first to react, eyes jumping from one figure of Draco Malfoy to the other.
to be rescued. He wanted to be a miserable tiny little ball on the floor and have no one see him or talk to him ever again. He wanted to be left to suffer for all eternity because it was the only thing he knew how to do and a lot more than what he deserved. He wanted… he wanted to die. With trembling fingers he plucked the vial from inside the thicker band of the bracelet, for a moment just staring at the green potion. Draco stared, and as he pressed it to his lips, his heartbeat slowed down. The screaming noises in his ears died down and suddenly he could hear the city outside, the cars and the people. He closed his eyes, softly kissing the vial like he would a lover, too lost and too sad to do anything else. He lay there for a long time before he was able to open his eyes again.
Draco shook his head, beaming. “I haven’t. I’ve never had them before. Something this sticky and messy? My father would've never allowed it in our dining room. I didn’t give you a ten because perfection is something you need to strive for. It’d be a good lesson for you. You’re far too lax about these things.”
Potter bit his lip, evidently pondering whether to say something or not. It took a minute before he made up his mind. “Yeah, actually – I’d seen them together before. She visits her sister often, I gathered.”
“You know,” Potter said musingly, “Dumbledore used to say that fear of the name only increased the fear of the thing itself.”
Draco rushed to the sitting room to find the man sprawled on the floor, the new security guard face down by his foot. He blinked at him for a moment, too confused to think properly. Did he really fall asleep? That seemed impossible, but the sleepy fog in his head and his sore neck told him it might have actually been a while. Huh. Draco didn’t think he’d have the courage to actually sleep. Perhaps he was just that tired, or
“But he-“
“Yes, and the Dark Lord is coming down as well – the drawing room’s where they came in from, so everyone’s heading there. It could really be happening this time.” There was excitement in Dolohov’s voice that rattled Draco. What alarm have they triggered? Where were the others right now? He stepped quickly to stand next to Granger, who gave him an ashen-colored look in return. This was bad, way worse than bad.
“How can you say that?” Potter’s voice was high and somehow moist. “How can it be better?”
She shook her head disbelievingly. “Oh, I dunno. Maybe when you started pretending I don’t exist. When you made every possible excuse not to see me.”
“But he lied,” he continued for some inexplicable reason, when Potter couldn’t seem to find any words. “He lied about that. I listened, and they still – they didn’t stop. But it was too late by then, I’d already… I can’t get rid of it. I tried when I was on parole, but there was nothing I could do. It’s instilled in me now.”
“And you really are sorry for everything?”
“Harry,” Draco repeated, because, really.
This dream-logic had him stumped. “What are you – “
“When I made you think I was here alone. It was… I was lying. I’m sorry.”
Merlin, if only he could see! Draco writhed desperately in his bindings. It was so much more horrible this way, not seeing them. Not knowing what they were going to do… he strained his ears, but there were too many noises to make sense of anything, and he was too frazzled to try. Oh gods. Panic felt like poison in his bloodstream.
There wasn’t much he could do against that imploring voice, and Draco basically ran. Only when he reached the bathroom door did he think about it – “Potter, the mattress!”
“You… what?” Now he just lost the plot. The words breached through the haze in his consciousness somehow, and Draco’s eyes sought the green ones in confusion. He did not understand the mixture of emotions swirling in them.
“I’m sorry, I had no idea. Please, I mean it, I really didn’t – I never expected – “
“Harry – “ he didn’t know how to say it, but it needed to be said. “No. It wasn’t either of those options. Of course I trusted you, but you were going to lose. You were blindsided by – He fooled you, and you were going to lose. Everything was going to fall and I knew… it was the only way. I didn’t do it because I wanted to hurt myself. I did it to free myself.”
“Wait a minute, pet, I just –

“Hit the nail on the head, I’d say. Of course, Fergus being alive was a well-kept secret, almost as much as my existence. Even Father’s Death Eaters had had no idea. We thought your Ministry would be very much intrigued by his appearance, but we couldn’t risk taking him out of his cover quite yet – it was imperative he remained where he was. Luckily we had a body to use for this purpose. Luck favors the prepared, after all.”
“Don’t, Harry, he’s all right. Don’t freak out, please. He’s in a rough shape, but he will make it.”
“I don’t

Nothing would help him.
not the one who’s going to die tonight.”
How, how was he meant to resist him? Potter was everything good in this world, he was the very concept of good taken from its abstract state and poured into a solid form. Draco would do anything, anything for him, he would give him it all, everything he had.
Draco didn’t think Potter picked up on that stupid remark. There was no going back from it now, though. “I merely meant that – well, I told you, I was reluctant at first. I didn’t want to share
“I do! it’s brilliant. It looks amazing on you, and it seems a really good quality. Does it do the work well enough? Keeping the winter chill out?”
“Malfoy – he’s with his dad, they went upstairs to his mum’s room to see her, they don’t know she isn’t there – “
The sound of Floo-flames kicking up ripped him out of his brooding. “Draco?” he heard the call, and inadvertently smiled.

“He’s seen better days,” Ron said and formed in Harry’s field of vision. “They’ve done some really nasty stuff, but he would be fine. Madam Pomfrey says it’s lucky we got him now and not later. She said he was very close.”
“Good,” Harry huffed. He crossed his arms on his chest. “So…” he had no idea what to say further. “I guess we don’t have to hide from Snape anymore?”

“Yeah, it was all right,” Potter was obviously not taking the bait. “I just don’t… I can’t believe I could be stupid enough to do – “
Thank you so much
, that He was inclined to… fucking hell, Draco knew He was a sadist, that He liked to see his pain, that He got off on it. Draco also knew He’s killed before – or, well, had suspected that, at least. Knew that He wasn’t averse to murder, if nothing else. But only when there was no other choice, when it was necessary, absolutely as a last resort. Not like this. Not just strolling around London murdering anyone who’s ever been in contact with him. Damn it, the ladies were customers, they were allowed! David, yes, that was a – a mistake on his part, a misjudgment, he was being careless. David might be his fault. Oh, gods, David was totally his fault. David died because Draco couldn’t obey a simple demand, couldn't keep his fucking shit together, because he was too stupid to see - but why did He have to kill Delilah? Draco balled his fists so tight it hurt. No rules were broken there, he didn’t do anything – why did He have to do that? To send Dementors to attack Daniel? To murder an entire party? Why did He do all of that? Draco knew he’s been living with someone dangerous, that he loved someone cruel, but he never believed He’s capable of this.
After the supermarket, as he promised, Potter took them to the bakery. Draco had never been inside a Muggle one, or at least not in this life, and it was a slightly stressful concept - he disliked being in small, packed places, as the chances he will be accidentally touched increased - but all in all it was actually pleasant. The pastries Potter picked, chocolate filled, rich and creamy eclairs, were sublime. They ate them at the bakery, sitting at a little table against the window, watching the passersby and making the odd comment between licking their fingers and laughing. It was brilliant. More than brilliant. It was… it was out of this world, out of this life, unbelievably perfect. Draco almost forgot to hate himself in these bright, shiny moments. Perhaps chocolate really was the answer to everything.
Another heavy noise, this time from outside the bathroom, suggested Harry was losing his mind. “Draco?
Warnings: none
“Potter? Status check?”
Something he knew, maybe, that a part of him knew all along – or didn’t know, he didn’t know anything, he never knew anything. The fog was becoming heavy again, and it threatened to take him under, he was going to drown –
“Yes, but Potter,” Draco carried on, a little hesitant. Having already had this conversation several times didn’t make it so much easier to push someone as strong-willed as Potter. Still, some things had to be said, so Draco had to bloody
“I should say not. Draco has not been a good boy, you see. He did some bad, bad things, and for some reason he thought it will be a good idea to try and cross me. I have taken such careful steps, went to such great lengths to ensure my son will be obedient to me. I worked with utmost precision, uprooting all the sad little weaknesses, inserting with an iron fist what nobility obligates. And yet…” he sighed. “It seems like it wasn’t enough. It seems like I have failed.”
“Worth what?” Draco asked, confused.
can he possibly avoid breaking any more rules?
“Your holly wand?” Draco couldn’t find the courage to speak louder than a whisper. “You’d let me
Not that he really knew what he expected, but it surely wasn’t this. Not for Him to gently pick up his trembling, bleeding body and lay it on the bed. Not to be washed – manually, no less – from head to toe, stroked softly and with care, and have dittany poured on his throbbing wounds. Draco didn’t expect any of that. And when He leaned down and kissed him, gently, lovingly, Draco almost choked. He didn’t know what to make of any of it.
A shade of burgundy colored Potter’s face with indignation. Draco saw it out of the corner of his eye. “You just made it my business, Malfoy! If you want me to lie about you being alive – if you want me not to tell anyone, you better at least give me a reason why. I think you owe me that.”
“Did you hear that, Draco? Grateful. You know, you should be grateful, too. You should be grateful the Dark Lord hasn’t killed you yet, even though you didn’t complete your task. And you should be grateful he hasn’t killed your mummy here, either.”
abused
Harry pulled him into a stop when he’d had just about enough. There was something on his face, not exactly anger, but something that hurt just as much, and Draco had to turn away from him before he started crying. There was a long moment of silence, occasionally disturbed by the buzz of some insects or the hoot of an owl. Draco counted his breaths and told himself quite sternly this was not going to turn into a panic attack.
“But I do care!”
Draco’s stomach churned. “No, and she can’t. Potter, you have to promise me you won’t tell a soul.”
“I want to go with you,” he finally said, and let them figure out what it meant. He was so tired. It looked for a moment like Harry was going to touch him, but he never.
“Well, have you ever… kissed someone before? I mean, a real kiss. Not like what we did.”
Draco knew the chances were slim, but if at any moment the ground could open up and swallow him whole, now would be perfect. “Him. My partner.”
Draco rubbed his tired eyes that still burned from the smoke. “Are you scared to fight a little boy, Malfoy?” He hoped this one would sting.
“I don’t – Potter, it’s done with. You don’t need to get so worked up about it.” Because I do, enough for the both of us.
“No, I know, it’s just… maybe if I'd known, I wouldn’t have been so – and we wouldn’t have been so – “ Harry’s cheeks were bright red. “I know it doesn’t work like that, but it would've been nice if we were friends sooner. Imagine how much trouble it could have saved us.”
Harry was stunned into silence. “Draco…” he started, but was cut off immediately.
choice.
“I need you to tell me something,” Potter said, his tone suddenly dropping to an icy whisper, and he made a very obvious attempt to control his rising temper. “And I need you to be honest. Did he ever – make you do – anything physical – “
“No, Potter. Not poor Draco, not now. Gods, don’t make it more difficult than it has to be, all right? I’m not above begging you, but I really wouldn’t like to have to.”
The words hurt like a whip to his shoulder blade, and Draco had to take some shallow breaths to empty his mind. He didn’t feel up to looking at Potter anymore, not when the green eyes were so full of fucking
– said fuck it, He was away, and Draco would drown if it wasn’t for Potter. A third part, one that was his constant companion since the first day outside, simply suggested he took the poison and got it all done with. All in all, he was bamboozled. Potter saw the turmoil in him, but said nothing.
“You got me a wand?”
“I know,” Potter smiled, and Draco cursed himself. Of course he does. Potter knew bloody
Potter looked uncomfortable, which was far better than the way he was all musing and brooding over Draco’s mysterious love life. “Er, no, not really. I don’t have a boyfriend. And I don’t really go out on dates at the moment, with everything that’s going on at work, so…” he gulped down the remainder of his juice and eyed Draco’s cold plate. “Are you done with that? You can have the leftovers tomorrow for dinner. I mean, if I don’t show up. I’m not sure if I’ll have the time and all, with the new… cases… things.” He must have remembered it would be Saturday, because his face was bright crimson.
was white. Inside, it was all white, besides for a little spot of fire in a place that for some reason he decided to name his gut.
“Well, so what if he did? Maybe he wanted my help, he knew I couldn’t turn down someone who’s family is being harassed by Voldemort!”
“No need, Harry Potter sir. Dobby can be invisible on his own.” And with that he disappeared from view completely. Ron’s voice shook Harry back into action.
“I don’t. Take it back. Put it in your pocket right away.”
Draco was pulled up to his feet, and He cast a spell to clean his face from any residues. “My love,” He said, and there was such fondness in His tone Draco went limp. Falling onto the tall man, he wrapped his arms around Him in a desperate attempt at controlling himself. Draco didn’t much know if he’s allowed to or not, but if he didn’t hold Him right here and now as tight as possible he would literally die. From the lack of rebuke Draco deduced He didn’t mind, and indeed He allowed Draco’s arms to entomb Him, holding Draco with the same fervor. “So long, then, my Draco. I shall return to you as soon as I can. I know you will do it for us, that you will vanquish this one obstacle in our way. I trust you.”
“I know, I know what you said. I know you wanted to feel in control, and I understand, I do. But now that we’re here, I’m just… would you consider just, for me, just
“Yes, I did say that.” Draco hoped the way his heart hammered wildly in his chest wasn’t overly noticeable. “And it wasn’t from either of these sources. I don’t know if it was saving Grove that gave Him the idea, or maybe the whole thing was planned from the get go. I haven’t a clue. But He must have used thorn apple on him as well, it doesn’t make sense otherwise, the Sectusempra was going to kill him. And so He had plenty of time to come up with this, I suppose. To choose and brew the precise type of poison that would fit His purpose. In the end it was just another way to control me. Not from any animal or plant… The poison was based on Him. He poisoned me with Himself.”
was staring at him,
, and that was all that mattered. The terrible mistakes he made… his silly fears and worries… they were nothing against that look in His eyes. Draco couldn’t say no to those eyes, even if he wanted to. Which he didn’t. Not at all.
“In order to bring them here, I had to come up with an excuse. I told them I intend to rescue Mother and required their assistance. When we arrived I came looking for you, but we got separated. I did not want to tell you anything before I had all three in my hands – I didn’t want to risk failing you.”
“Draco, you got this. You got it. Focus.” He pushed himself more into Harry, breathing in his scent, trying to ground himself through it. Harry, he told himself, Harry, Harry, Harry is here, Harry is here and it will be okay, it will be okay, Harry is here… the banging sounds slowed to a stop, and he was able to take a full, deep breath. “All right?” Harry asked, incredibly soft, and Draco whimpered into his collarbone.
“Incredibly sorry.”
“Shit, Draco – I knew this was a mistake, oh, fuck, oh, Draco…”
Halfway through dinner came the time for speeches. Being the best man, Harry got the floor first, and he got up from the table where they sat (in her infinite wisdom, Hermione decided not to put them in the top table). He cleared his throat a few times before he could manage a word.
Still, Draco knew everything had changed. He could feel it everywhere; in the shaking of his hands, in the doorways and in the carpet, in the delicate statues he hated. The flat was almost new to him, in that sense, and it was a staggering feeling. It wasn’t his home any longer. This place was a stranger to him, now.
(See the end of the chapter for
“All right,” Harry literally took a step back. “All right. I get it.”
The charade continued. “It’s something big. Really big.”
. To see him just – just laughing and smiling like a – I wanted to hurt him, Draco. I wanted to break his bloody face. It was all I could do to stop myself.”
He woke up every few minutes, glancing up, and there she was. She must have been lying on the bed with him, and her fingers left a buzzing sensation on his skin, but he would not move away for the world. She didn’t say anything, just looked at him, as if she could never have her fill. As if she would be quite content just looking at him for the rest of her life, like this was all she wanted in the world. Draco understood completely.
Harry looked back at him sadly. “It’s not… never mind, we can get into all that later. We have to move, now that you’re awake. I can help you down the stairs, I don’t think I have it in me to apparate at the moment – then when you’re all settled we can talk about everything.”
It wasn’t great, not yet, but it was getting better. And that was fucking something.
Lucius grabbed her by the shoulders and stared her down. “Silence, girl. Be quiet, or I will spell your dirty little mouth shut for you. Come, Draco. They will be expecting us down there, and as you say, we must first ensure the boy is present before we can let our Lord arrive.”
Of course He had to hear that. Draco closed his eyes. “I didn’t mean that, Sir.”
Malfoy shook himself and finally looked up at Harry. “Didn’t know for sure that I wasn’t going to be. I still don’t really know.” His voice was very flat.
“Cheers.” Draco couldn’t see it, but he was sure Potter just rolled his eyes. “And how are you?”
for Draco, and it was on a whole new level of too much. He couldn’t let this happen. His fucking light in this grim, grim world, and Draco lets him just torment himself so that
It was somewhat stabilizing to hear someone call him

“Harry,” he cried, more urgently than ever before. He wanted to ask him to stop, but wasn't sure if he could manage a please in front of Grove without it coming out as begging, and he couldn't show any weakness.
Harry made a sound that was worryingly similar to spitting. “You really are fucking insane.”
Word count: 800
“Potter, wait. I don’t want you to go.”
“Because I am forever in awe of their incredible healing and magical properties,” Draco answered impatiently. “Why do you care so much? What’s it to you?”
“What?” Draco blanched. He didn’t understand anything that’s happened around him. He didn’t understand a thing.
“Remember the time my floating head threw mud at you in Hogsmeade?” Harry asked, sticking his tongue out.
It was probably the lightest feeling Harry had left the room with in a while.
, he told it, but the voice only laughed. Is he really, on Harry’s side? Certainly he can no longer be on the opposite – not merely because they would kill him – but would he really be welcomed on Harry’s side? They would always treat him with mistrust, they would always hate him. He would always just be Malfoy to them, when he wasn’t so much of a Malfoy anymore, barely a Draco. Even Harry himself hadn’t really forgiven him, not that he expected him to: Draco would not have forgiven such betrayal, such cowardice. He did not forgive himself it, for that matter. Harry was right; he was not to be trusted. But then – but then – Draco’s breath hitched and he squeezed his eyes tighter. Enough. Enough. He had to concentrate.
to his fucking
Draco knew the cold anger in his father’s eyes. He knew what kind of retribution he will receive for it. At some point, be it sooner or later, he would have to face it; his father’s scorn, his fury, his punishment. Honestly, Draco did not know which one he feared more. He was worn so thin already, so very thin that he could barely even formulate a single thought. How would he be able to withstand him… that was a very good question. Despair threatened to wash him in the cold grey sea. He labored to bring himself back to shore and to the room around him.
“Excuse me, how much for these?” the third lady, a plump little woman, rattled a bunch of roses at him. “If I want to buy, say, a dozen?”
“Very well, Lucius, let him down,” Voldemort’s voice rose above it all, and Harry felt sick to his stomach. Draco was – he was – he didn’t look anything like his Draco. Not even a little. The only thing that made him recognizable was the mop of blond hair hanging limp on his face. Harry wanted to scream.
“Hey,” Harry started, hand sending towards him but never making the full way. “Hey, did I do something wrong?” his fingers moved in the air, as if trying to wipe Draco’s tears without touching him, and was there something he could have done that would make Draco love him more?
The blue bed covers were the first to go; Draco didn’t even know if he banished them or spelled them into a thousand pieces, he didn’t care. He Accioed the blanket from underneath the bed and cast it to oblivion. He shredded the pillows and splintered the bedframe and shattered the window and brought the whole wardrobe down on its side. Harry just stood there, holding the box, face open in shock, but Draco had no time for him. He whirled on to the door, uprooting it from its hinges, and upon sight of the phoenix painting in the hallway he literally screamed. He didn’t even need to say the spell out loud, it was burning so hard inside him, and within seconds the blasted canvas was aflame, and Draco was so far from done he was shaking.
Harry drew in a deep breath, unhappiness spilling from his bloodshot eyes. “You have no idea, Draco. I… fuck. I know you won’t – I know you don’t have any reason to trust me, but… Please, please just hear me out. I was just so tired
“Oh,” Hermione said in her best imitation of nonchalant. “Right. Well, he didn’t say anything special, anything we… didn’t expect him to say.” There was a definite tinge of pink on her cheeks.
“Oh. Sorry, you’re not actually meant to – you were out for quite a long time, and I had my bag with me, so I thought I’d look over some stuff. It’s the case files I’ve been working on, ever since the… what is it? Draco, are you okay?”
He couldn’t speak, hardly even raise his hand, but he somehow managed to point at the picture. “That – “
“Maybe you don’t have to,” Ron contributed in a low voice. “Maybe there’s someone else who can teach you that now.”
He could hear Potter’s shrug even if he didn’t see it. “I don’t know. I thought I should come. I wanted to.”
Was there a point, after feeling unbearably sick, when the acidic, awful juices just start leaking out? It felt like it. Drop after drop of acid melting down all his wirings, everything inside him. He was already being decomposed.
He was finally going to get what he deserved.
Ron tugged his sleeve and the three of them got up. His friends gave him pleading looks. “Let’s go, Harry. You heard him, he doesn’t want our help. We could go get a professor or something to come and help him.”
“I can’t make any promises,” Draco quirked an eyebrow. Whatever pride he still had in him stung, but the concern in his gut was overpowering.
It was too much of an order to ignore, and Draco was nothing if not obedient. “He introduced me to him as… as his pet. He said I was – that I would be – that I was the only pet fit to lie at his feet, as it were. I don’t know what they spoke of after that, I sort of blacked out. I understood then that the Dark Lord intended to keep me. I couldn’t focus on anything more.”
“How do we get the potion from Snape? He will never let any of us have it. It’s only Draco he likes, and he wouldn’t give it to him on account of being worried he will do… exactly what we plan on doing,” Harry flushed only a little. “Hermione, do you think you could distract him long enough for me to steal the flasks from his office?”
It was too late, because
“Potter, please. You can’t lie to save your life. You know full well you don’t care about
he was so here… Here where he could be hurt. He was weak and he needed and he was here to help him, because he was such an arse, and Draco… oh gods. He was putting Harry’s life in danger again, he was such a useless fucking whore, and he deserved – what did he deserve now? Not that punishment, all right, but what did he deserve? He needed to know. He needed to know what will happen to him, what the next hit will be, when will it come. He needed to know, he needed to be prepared, and he needed – “Draco?”
The grey eyes never seemed larger. “Yes, but… you said going there
, he begged so hard. There were tears and snot and whimpering involved, and a lot more
“What?”
“Draco, you don’t have to,” Potter said in an urgent little whisper, but Draco wasn’t looking at him. He shook his head.
Keeping His eyes directly on him, He took a step back. “I love you, Draco. More than I ever thought possible, more than I even wished to. You are the single most important thing to me, do you understand that? More valuable than any other.”
“Right. Well, let’s hope I do better this time then. It’s… where you keep the poison, yeah?”
Gut. What an interesting concept. That he had a gut, had to mean he had a body. Yes – he could feel it all around him. It was a startling discovery. There was pain everywhere; he
“So the poison was the bond? I mean, combined with everything he did?” Blaise asked. “And then when you had enough of the antidote, it stopped working? Is that why you didn’t try to…?” he didn’t complete his question. Draco considered it for a moment before shaking his head.
As if this day could still get any worse, the door opened and a snout-faced young man walked in, because Draco could really handle an interaction right now. In fact, to call him man was somewhat presumptuous; Draco wasn’t entirely certain it hadn’t been an ill-dressed pig standing on its hind legs.
“Draco, this isn’t your fault. I was the one who grabbed you as Lucius Apparated. You didn’t see where he went, by any chance?” Harry’s tone was very careful, but his face was cold. This was Auror Harry, and he was thinking of ways to get out of there. Already he was on his feet and trying the door, which of course was locked. He didn't even have his wand, for all the good it would have done him. Draco, in his utter bewilderment, in his complete and overwhelming daze, sitting on the floor without the slightest ability to move, wanted to kiss him.
“You should be glad this is all I’m doing, Malfoy. I could always go to Dumbledore and have you practically executed, instead. You're lucky to be receiving my mercy.”
“Not at all. You have some strange neighbors, Draco. Strange indeed.”
your fault. God, I can’t believe you… I can’t believe you still think that.”
Draco’s heart did the only reasonable thing and exploded. “She – what?”
Potter looked like he was about to argue, but then he sighed and nodded. “I had a pretty normal day, yeah. Some paperwork to fill in the morning, very boring. Chased this bloke around who was selling illegal potion ingredients – by the way, did you know the flower you keep in the shop is classed as a grade C dangerous plant?”
“Because what?”
“Let him go,” Potter demanded, and Draco was impressed against his will. He had no idea he meant
“N-no,” Draco cried brokenly, and it was so much
The seconds passed by torturously slow, and Draco invested all his energy into the stupid breathing exercises stupid Dr. Radford taught him. Slowly… even more slowly than that… the bundle of hysteria in his belly started to unwind.
and thinking was made rather impossible. Then he shook his head and begged his mind to work. “
, like having his intestines pulled out through his nose while getting bashed by a Dementor with a troll’s club. It was just so difficult now, because the iron curtain had to stretch to accommodate so much more. It had to make room for Him, and He took up a
“I – I’m – “ flabbergasted and airless, that’s was he was.
“You thought wrong,” he whispered, or rather cawed. There were more gasps around them.
Draco turned his head away so Potter wouldn’t see the tears. “Your friends?”
“For crying out loud, Harry, just stop. Please. I can’t take it anymore.”
“Know what?” Harry stopped him, and Draco shrugged.
Merlin, Mordred, Morgana,
“Erm, eating, mostly.”
Harry had to take a few deep breaths before he could bring himself to where the other three were standing and very poignantly not looking at each other. He tried to wipe the sticky blue color off his face, and was met with stern resistance. “Well,” he said in a would-be light tone, “That sucked.”
“What kind of reason?” Harry asked, but she just shrugged. Sorting began, and it was a little difficult to hold a conversation above the general uproar when each name was sorted into a house. Then all the noise in the room dissolved into non-existence as the headmaster rose to his feet.
Come say hi if you're on
They were expanding, though, right then and there, in this second that lasted at least a couple of hours; He tortured him. Abused him.
“Oh, yes. I remember making bets on how long you’d last. You cost me quite a bit of money that day when you came up first. I blame myself, though; never go against the Golden Boy, that’s rule number one.”
In that case… hell, there was no reason not to do it, was there? Draco cleared his throat and zoomed back to reality. The inside of his head was still a dangerous place, shimmering and deceptive. Never mind. He will live on the surface and Potter will have this, have this part of him, because Potter bloody deserved it and Draco simply could not fight it any longer.
for all he cared. That was it, that was it, that was it. he can rip himself to shreds about it later. Merlin, He will probably rip him to shreds sooner than that. It just didn’t matter. Potter – Potter was – Potter could never love him, but he was here. He didn’t need to love him. Draco wasn’t a flower, he didn’t need love to survive. What he needed was for that
He was beyond exhausted, and there was nothing about any of this that was right. His own head declared open war on him, and that bastard played dirty. Draco rapped long fingers against his temples, begging. Just stop it. Just stop.
The Death Eaters laughed, but the sound was distant and disconnected from him. Draco was only here, on his blazing knees, the pain shooting from his shin about to end him, the hollow in his heart making him cold. He would die here, and he could only hope it would happen soon.
“Yes?” There was such a hard line of dissatisfaction in His tone, and it worked on him instinctively.
So now, this? Now he was supposed to accept this? He was meant to be able to, to want to, he was meant – what was he meant to do, now?
“I don’t need St. Mungo’s, I swear. Just a few more days’ rest, and I’ll be fine."
to know?” Potter asked, disgusted. “When I see her, all frail and miserable as she is now, I’m just meant to – what, act like I’ve not just run into her son the other day? Is that really what you want?”
“I’m not concerned,” he said lightly, grinning towards Malfoy. “I know Harry’d have my back if I needed him; he already did, in front of
“Darling,” Narcissa said, her hand sending towards him then retreating just as quick. “Sweetheart, of course we’re not fighting. Harry and I are both very – passionate about ensuring your wellbeing, that’s all. We value each other tremendously. Personally, I thank the gods every day for him.”
The amount of relief that washed over him when he saw it was Harry next to him was so great, he didn’t even feel sick. He exhaled the largest amount of air in the world, but for the life of him he could not move. He wanted to jump at him, to collapse into his arms, to cry his name out loud, but even opening his mouth was a little beyond him. Draco was in full panic mode now; he tried to wiggle his fingers, to adjust the angle of his head, but everything was difficult and suddenly the pain was back. No. Gods, no. Harry! He shouted in his mind, then again, louder, Harry! But no voice came out of his lips. Nothing. Draco looked all around him in hysteria, his eyes being the only thing he could move, and again his surroundings made no sense to him. where was he? What was happening here? What sort of dark magic was he under?
In the first few minutes he didn’t even notice the quiet, so busy was he screaming at himself in his head and cursing his own stupidity. But after a while, when he reached the forest, he noticed. There was no one else around, no one else for possibly miles. The nearest Muggle residence was fifteen miles away, and this was all private property (Mother never told him where she got the gold to rent it). Harry, probably biting his nails bloody, was all the way back at the cottage. And so Draco was alone, in this place he didn’t really know, and
“Why would you?” Malfoy interrupted, finally looking at him. “Why would you ever even think about that? I’m just a selfish prat, aren’t I, always thinking about myself.” The bitterness in his voice seemed to seep into Harry’s own heart. “I asked you, Potter. Damn it, I begged you to leave me alone, to let this go. And now…” he took a deep breath. “If anything happens to her…” but he couldn’t continue; he just stood there, defeated, eyes looking somewhere that was much farther than the wall in front of him. Harry didn’t know what to do. He wanted desperately to say something, to do something, but he had no idea what.
The only reason Draco was able to say all of that was the resolute way in which he did not look at Potter. Looking at him now was a mistake. It cut his heart into tiny little pieces and then stomped them under a heavy metal boot. “Fuck,” was Potter’s reply, two minutes into the deafening silence. “Fuck.”
“Thursday.” Gods, tortured for five days… at least it made sense why he felt so rotten. He nodded bleakly. “Oh, Draco. I – I’m so sorry. I should have come find you sooner. I should have – I could have stopped him.” His heart did a strange sort of movement, contracting and expanding at the same time.
“That very night. He wasn’t extremely keen on you finding out, for obvious reasons, so I never pushed the matter further, but he did say he believed you had the right to know.” Dumbledore sighed and stroked his long beard. “That night when you came to me, Harry, I have to admit I had already known about Draco’s task.”
It took all of his effort not to visibly shiver, and so responding to this kindness was a little overwhelming. “Back, please.” He didn’t think he can stand this day to be much longer. Maybe at the flat he can tell Potter to fuck off and do some actual damage to himself. He felt like he needed a massive amount of pain before he could go back to thinking straight.
“It wasn’t on you,” he said then, his voice hoarse. He was absolutely powerless against Potter’s pain. In his shabby state, seeing somebody suffer could evoke nothing but a deep, furious sense of misery. “All those deaths, it wasn’t on you. You did so well. You saved so many people – even when they didn’t deserve to be saved.”
“That's not true. You know, I was pretty lonely as a boy.”
“It’s not that. The room is lovely. It’s fine, really.”
“No, you don’t, you know nothing! Gods, all this time I thought – I thought your version of me was the truth, but it isn’t! I’m not what you think I am, and Harry isn’t, and everything isn’t the way you taught me! You were just so full of – you have no idea who I am.
Venus De Milo stared right at him, somber. She was rather beautiful, he assumed. If her eyes had any color in them, he was certain they’d be a very bright green.
“I knew you shouldn’t have given him so much to drink, Ronald,” she snipped sideways once the tie was all done. “Now look what you’ve done.”
Him by his actions – nope, he wasn’t brave enough to try and imagine what would happen. Best not to, really. It took a moment until he realized everybody was looking at him.
“Unless you actually do that stupid thing he wants you to do,” Ron said lightly, quirking an eyebrow up. “Then there’s no guarantees who’s going to try and kill you.”
“Then you know what might happen,” Hermione said, tense on her seat, sending worried glances to Harry.
got to decide and no one, no one else could, no one else. Not Azkaban. Not Grove. Not Him. Not Harry, sadly, thankfully.
No, not sorry, not for himself, not for Potter, not for anyone. Draco had one purpose and one only, and it was Him, always Him. There was no confusion about that fact, not anymore. Not even if the voice screamed and tore his head from the inside. Not even if his very essence was tattered and shaky. Not even if the iron curtain was straining and clanging helplessly.
“Surprise, surprise,” Draco said, but the corners of his mouth twitched. “I don’t think she could go anywhere and not be the smartest witch in the place. It would ruin her, for one.”
was over with, he was just frightened. He scared Potter, flat out scared him, and for that he will surely have to face some ugly consequences. It took even longer for him to realize Potter was smiling. “Do you want to maybe get off the floor?”
Draco was an idiot for mentioning names, a thing he swore he'd never do in his life, but his big mouth had no regards for his safety, and he was too deep in the pit of his own anger to stop. “The next time you take a shower after a game with him, take a look. You’ll find he has a little birthmark on his right hip, just above his crotch, shaped somewhat like scissors. It's nearly, but not quite, hidden behind his pubic hair, which incidentally is the sickening color of an earwax flavored Bertie Bott’s bean. Used to give me heartburn when he made me suck him off. Which was how I learned all the charming details you can find in the Ministry’s locker room.”
“Yes,” Malfoy whispered, putting his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “I’ve wanted to do it all day. But I didn’t because – I still don’t know exactly – “
Harry chuckled, and the soft sound was soothing to Draco’s frayed nerves. “Thankfully it was Hermione’s turn. She made a curry, very tasty. I actually brought some back for you, thought you might like it.”
Draco laughed. What other choice did he have? Potter looked content now, leaning back in his chair with a relaxed smile on his face, and if Draco doesn’t do something about it
“You – you knew he will?” Harry reluctantly looked back at him. Before the explosion he remembered being ready to be cursed again, this time by Draco, when instead he was hit with a shield. A shield so powerful, he hardly even noticed the breach into the castle; he was perfectly cocooned in Draco’s warm, soft protection. In his love. Perhaps it was a stupid way to think about it, but there in the sitting room, overwhelmed by the pain and anger and fear, that was exactly what it felt like. Like he was wrapped deep and safe in Draco’s love.
me anywhere, and you very well know that. You’re just – now you’re just playing me, and that’s not right. It's actually stooping pretty fucking low. There’s no need for cheap tricks like that.”
“It’s not your fault,” Harry tried to comfort him, but his voice was robotic and harsh. “You’ve done brilliantly, Dobby. You should go and get that sorted, now,” he gestured towards the hole in Dobby’s shirt, undoubtedly caused by Draco’s spell. Dobby gave them all a little bow and disappeared in the sea of frantic house-elves.
Malfoy shook his head. There was disbelief in his eyes, and also some resentment. “Are you trying to tell me that all this time I spent hating you… you really were the good guys?”
Instead of replying he nudged him a little until Potter lifted his arm, allowing Draco to sneak under it and wrap both his own either side of Potter’s torso. He held on tight, and from there on the movement was quick; Potter nearly crushed him in his one-armed, sideways embrace, and Draco bent to lean his head against Potter’s chest. Even from behind the thick jumper he could hear Potter’s heart beating wildly, and he closed his eyes, reveling in the feeling. To be in his arms… to be held like this… he could cry right now if he didn’t hold himself just as tightly. The pan in Potter’s other hand stopped shaking.
“Ernie, one of them is coming right at you!” Harry shouted, looking to the edge of the room where the Hufflepuff stood. Ernie didn’t need to be told twice; he bolted towards Neville, and now they were both stranded pretty much in the middle of the room behind the desk. The last two figures were making their way towards them from either side, and now was the time to think fast. “Malfoy, we need to help them,” Harry gave a shout, and started searching for ways around. “Here, I can go behind that bench, and you can run from the other side and we’d get them both at the same time. Ready?”
him. Harry thought he deserved it, and Draco didn’t, not ever. He had to know. He had a right to know. And if he hates him for it –
If there was any way to express how sorry he was, Draco surely would have attempted it. But there wasn’t, and speaking was beyond him anyway, and besides – besides – he had nothing to say. Tears streamed down his cheeks again, as the only sort of reaction he could give.
, because he was being so
Dumbledore shook his head. “I don’t know. I find it hard to believe they would lose the threat with which they hoped to draw you by killing him. Nevertheless… his state might be such that they would have no other option.”
Draco blanked. “What do you mean?”
“Do you reckon he’ll come live at the cottage?”
He would not give them the satisfaction.
“Well, he did say so himself. But more than that, I could see it in him. He has changed completely, both over the terrible summer he had to endure, and after that in his encounters with you. He has learned to know you, Harry. He could never betray you after that; no, I’m inclined to believe he would give his life for you, if necessary.”
Merlin help him, Draco was lost to the sheer thrill of it.
“Retribution, you say?” Harry pointed his wand right at the boy’s chest. He was so close to him, he could feel Malfoy’s breath on his face, but the blond didn’t pull away. “Are you going to make me pay, or will you send your auntie to do the deed? Or perhaps, big old Voldy?”
Revulsion fought the exhaustion in his body. “So you know.”
“Professor, listen, there is something I really need to tell you – “ it seemed like they will not get a better time, and Harry was all out of options. He would have to confide in the man he hated, because he had no choice – because he had to save his friends no matter what it will cost. But Bellatrix, who walked towards them, caught the last part.
“Yeah, you really should have learned that sooner. It never really worked in your favor, going against me. I’m glad you finally wizened up about it.”
I couldn’t be the one who always had to crawl back, always had to apologize, had to be the bigger man. I was exhausted.” He sounded desperate, so sad and desperate, and Draco shivered with the intensity of his stare. The words felt – not rehearsed, but the way they were spat so quickly suggested Harry had been deep in thought about them for a while. “I always needed to be so strong, and it was just – it was too much. You really hurt me, you know? My heart was broken and I wanted… I thought you should be the one who comes to me this time." He stopped, shaking his head. "Draco, I didn’t know. I thought – I hated how it always happened to me, you know? All this shit. How people always betray me and I always have to forgive them for the greater good. How I could never have something – never truly have the things I wanted – how I always had to give everything up and just be a good boy about it. But Draco, I had no idea this wasn’t something that was happening to
For a very distressing moment, it looked like Potter might actually cry. Draco averted his eyes, filled with shame. He couldn’t do this, couldn’t see someone like
“Listen to me,” Harry croaked. “This was not your fault. Do you hear me? It
“It’s fine, don’t worry about it. My dorm is far closer than yours. Come on, let’s get going, before we'd literally stick to this window and freeze to death.” He pulled the boy by his scarf-covered hands, and Malfoy came easily, without any resistance.
One evening Draco returned well after sunset, all jittery and speechless and shaking with excitement. Harry nearly had a heart attack on the spot – the poor thing, he’d been waiting for hours for Draco to come back, and was probably sitting on literal pins and needles the whole time. But Draco very bravely managed to look past that, grab Harry’s hand in his (!) and practically drag him all the way to the little forest, all the while unable to fully answer Harry’s increasingly more frantic questions (“What is it? Where are we going? What happened? Are you all right?”) By the time they got to the forest, though, Draco couldn’t find the right path, and they weren’t able to catch the fireflies again.
“Like it?” Harry’s face softened into a smile. “Draco, I bloody love this.”
“Mother,” he cried out, but she stopped him with a minute shake of her head.
“No worries,” Potter said, shaky smile stabilizing on his face. “Can I make you some tea? Ron always makes me one when I’m like that. I think it’s the closest to god people can get.”
Harry’s pale features paled a little more. “Right, well, it’s relevant because I think – I think I know who your boyfriend is, but I’m going to need your help to prove it.”
, the growl said in his ear, and Draco was certain He’d meant it. There will not be a next time.
“This is all well and good, but the question was yet to be answered, my boy. Again I must remind you it is not really your decision what will be of the girl.” Lucius stepped right to him and placed a hand on his shoulder. He was cool to the touch in a way that made Draco think of ghosts. But he was unfortunately solid and very present.
Draco didn’t honestly think he will make it. He had no doubt this will be the thing that breaks him. However, he thought that by this point, there was no going back. He imagined he will be raped repeatedly into his death, and for once found no consolation in the thought of his demise. He just didn’t see any other way. Whatever it was that kept him from giving up was still there, and so Draco saw himself as doomed. He even tried to convince himself it won’t be that bad. What’s rape compared to the Cruciatus curse, right? Still, the rumbling in his gut told him it would be something else entirely. When he pictured the look on Greyback’s face, he actually felt faint. A small voice in his head told him very simply he could not do it. He just couldn’t. No matter what they want from him, no matter what they ask for, he must relent. He must, because he can’t do it. This was too much, way too much, and it was where he put the line, so to speak. Yet he didn’t.
“Of course,” Harry conceded instantly, and Draco had to turn to him now. “Yes, it’s absolutely your decision. I’m sorry. Of course we’ll do whatever you want. If you want to stop doing it, we will.”
“What morning?” Harry asked, but Andromeda was looking at Draco alone.
“I’ve already talked to him. I said all I had to say. There’s nothing more I want to hear from him.”
When Draco dreamed, it was always of Him. It was impossible to think about Him in the hospital room, where he was constantly surrounded by people asking him
Draco didn’t even look at him. “I'm not worried about anything that will happen to
That was news to Draco. He didn’t know he was broken. Now, peering within himself, he wondered what it meant. He used to be different? He was more than this once, more than just the white fog and the fire and the red-eyed master? The familiar ceiling and the Potter boy… yes, yes, there was more, he was more. He was
He must have been referring to the scowl on Draco’s face. “You can’t love me,” he said, and his anger (again with the anger? Where the hell does it keep coming from?) multiplied, heating him up from the inside. It wasn’t a pleasant heat, though. It could burn him.
“Elf magic,” Harry answered, raising his eyes to meet the grey. He didn’t really know how to say everything that’s been zooming inside him, and he hoped Draco can understand telepathically somehow. “Draco, he can find your mother.”
“I should go,” he said in the end, getting to his feet. Draco’s disappointed gaze followed him up, but he didn’t stand. Potter didn’t need another reminder that he can hardly walk.
“We never really broke up. I don’t know where He went, what He’s doing now, but He was never actually my ex. I don’t – it was so hard, being alone, having to… relive all those memories… you were there, and you were so perfect, so understanding – so bloody good – and I couldn’t… I couldn’t resist you.”
“I am Draco Malfoy,” he said to the totally silent room. “And that boy over there – he – that is Harry Potter.”
“Er, what is…?” Draco tried politely. He'd seen this thing around, maybe. Was it perhaps something to do with automobiles? Or the tube?
Draco rolled around and threw up a little, already, he couldn’t stand it. Because he wasn’t that boy anymore; he knew what was going to happen, he knew about the chair, he knew everything. What that pathetic, useless boy was feeling – it may have overwhelmed him in the beginning, this wealth of emotions he didn’t remember ever having, but soon it was going to crush him. Because all these feelings – everything that was bubbling inside him now, the anger, fucking indignation, his stupid disbelief – they were the reason he was broken, they were the reason it hurt so terribly bad. Now
More smut (after the asterisks). Now they've started, it's really hard to stop them!
Receiving a nod of approval, Draco sank to his knees in front of the tall man, sending unsure hands to undo His zipper. Holy hell. Usually he didn’t take charge in situations like these, and it was frightening and more than a little overwhelming, to feel that he can do this to someone, to Him. Pulling down His underwear and seeing how hard He was – for Draco – he nearly swooned. Breathing harshly through his nose he took as much as he could into his mouth and began the motions he hadn’t done in a while. They were an instinct in him now, after everything – but he
the way he looked, not after everything, but this was a definite improvement. The famished, miserable face he was used to glimpsing occasionally when not careful enough had changed, much for the better. There was rosiness on his cheeks and a slight sheen to his skin and his eyes didn’t look so sunken anymore as his face filled up a little. Some of the haunted look that defined him for years now had vanished. The effect was pleasing, even if a little concerning.
“Really?” his head popped up automatically. “Do you mean that?”
is going to make that much of a difference?”
“Little?” Potter laughed. “I wouldn’t advise telling them that. They’re kept pretty wild out here, I reckon. Look, aren’t they beautiful?” Potter approached one so quickly, Draco couldn’t even shout in alarm - but the cow did nothing, just continued grazing its little spot of grass free from snow. Potter petted it admiringly, his face alight and alive and damn it, Draco felt so much his chest was at serious risk of bursting. He practically ran at him because suddenly they were too far and he wanted Potter close, close, closer. Potter sent out a hand invitingly, but not demanding, and Draco grabbed it with intensity that must have hurt, but Potter didn’t let it show. His smile was luminescent.
“Not to mention cook a fantastic meal,” Draco rolled his eyes, but Potter looked very serious.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Then what? The world will burn to ashes? Evil will triumph? Hell will be unleashed?”
voices to begin with, because voices equaled crazy, and Draco didn’t think he was crazy. Not now, anyway. Not in the normal sense of the word. In the less conventional, loose sense of ‘doing things that will most certainly ensure utter and terrible doom’ then yes, sure, he was crazy. But Draco didn’t really care about that at the moment. He had very little space in himself to care for much. Hell, he’d been dead for years now and he didn’t even know it. But it must have been the case because now with Potter he realized he is finally, finally, alive.
“That’s because you’re all cold-blooded snakes,” he tried to say, but he wasn’t sure the words were coming out right. Malfoy had a point; it was very hot in here. He felt sweat actually dripping down his back, and his face was almost on fire. Malfoy was just
With some pains, Draco pulled away so he could look into the green eyes, a little less green now with how wide the pupil was in them. “More than anything I ever wanted, you prat.”
“Will what?”
“Well, I... I thought you were hurt. I thought you were angry.” Now it was Malfoy covering his eyes with his hands, and Harry couldn’t even begin to explain how gratified he felt, seeing how much the Slytherin cared. “I thought I’ve ruined everything.”
This was his first time inside, and the smell was even stronger and more enticing. For the first time in a while, Draco actually felt hungry. It was practically mouth-watering – which for a frightening second made him think of Azkaban. He tried to push the memory away as they were shown to a table by the window, but Potter noticed the change in his face.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked in a strangled kind of voice, but when Harry sucked on his lower lip, he opened his mouth and let Harry’s tongue in. Harry kissed him gently, smoothly, and soon he had him gasping for air, his eyes relaxing to their normal shut-state. With a quick decision, Harry’s hand sent to Draco’s semi-hard cock. He pulled at it in slow strokes, making Draco shiver underneath him. When he got his member fully erect, and Draco slightly heaving, he started moving again.
“I’m not! I’m not going to – force you to do anything or whatever. I’m not bloody Crabbe or Goyle. I thought you knew that.”
He shut his eyes immediately, trying very hard to calm down the hysterical beating of his heart. He just didn’t have the courage to look and see who was there. If it was his father, then – then – Draco really didn’t know what then. The possibility was just too awful. When a few minutes passed and no one addressed him, no one cursed or shouted or touched him, Draco began to be able to use his other apparently existing senses. Eyes shut, it was his hearing again which took charge; Draco thought he could distinguish the shuffling of paper. Someone was reading, perhaps? Writing a letter? Beyond that there was the clinking of glass instrument and – was that a soft humming sound, coming from a distance? At that Draco had to open his eyes. No Death Eater who respected himself would be caught humming.
for beta-ing this!
“Wait – Potter, wait – wait!”
“You can say that again,” Draco murmured and took a large gulp of his beer. For some reason it made him speak, which was odd, since alcohol never used to betray him like that. “Their way of dealing with the overload was simply throwing everyone in prison without refrain. So much easier to ignore the problem when it’s wasting away in a cell far enough from the public eye.”
Potter nodded too. “All right then. If it’s okay by you. I guess we could try.” There was a long silence, and Draco thought he might actually throw up if none of them said something soon.
The night before Draco was meant to be released back to his dorm, Harry gave him a present. It was a very small shard of a mirror hung on a string. “Is that a necklace?” Draco asked, quirking his eyebrow. “Very sweet of you, but I don’t often wear jewelry. I find it distracts from my natural shine.”
“I’m serious. I’m so happy to know that you can stand for yourself. That you aren’t too – scared of me – I can’t tell you what it means to me. Honest. It was my biggest fear, and to see that you’ve… I’m so relieved.”
“I – “ Harry had to think it over. “Does it even matter if he told me the truth now? He kind of had no choice, he had his back against the wall. And even if he did change his mind, even if some of it was real,” he said, full of doubt, “how could I ever forgive what he’s done in the beginning? All the lying and the making me fucking fall for him?”
“I can only imagine,” Potter nodded encouragingly. “Really, I admire that. You are such a strong person, Malfoy. Strong and incredible. Even if you can’t cook for shit.”
And now he had this, too. Not feeling safe, not yet, maybe not ever, but knowing what it would feel like. It was such a small piece, a tiny bite, but it was chewable. he could take it. However seemingly insignificant, that was a victory all on its own. And
, and Draco had to know now. He had to know. He needed to have it in his hands again so he could know. And wasn’t that the objective of this whole entire thing? Stopping the potions, speaking to Grove, hasn’t he already subjected himself to all these little catastrophes? This was the last in the chain of some very, very hard things he’d had to do. It was no different than the rest of them, and it had to happen.
“I don’t – “ and he really, really didn’t. Draco didn’t know what to make of the entire thing. Harry was here in real life, with a shitload of expectations Draco could never, ever meet, and for some reason it was filling him whole with fury. He was
He spluttered water all over the desk. It took a second before he was able to shake his head in a valid imitation of the way he would have reacted to a question like this say, seven years ago. “Thanks but no thanks, Potter. I’m absolutely fine. And there is nothing I need from the Savior, so you might as well just relax.”
Draco sniffled and tilted his head. He wanted to give Potter something too for this unexpected kindness, had to give something back. “I hope someday you'll realize the wizarding world doesn’t need you to take responsibility over it anymore. That you'll get to let go of it.” There was silence between them again, but it wasn’t so loaded this time. It was almost amiable. Draco drew a breath and got to his feet. “Tea?”
!” as he expected, it shattered with a loud bang, and shards fell near the others but not close enough to hurt them. Harry took the few seconds of general confusion to roll over to their desk. “We have to get that one first,” he shouted over the mayhem when curse after curse were shot in their direction. He pointed towards the nearest figure at the corner, only just visible from behind a pole. Neville caught on to his intention immediately and looked around.
“You have no idea – “ he started, but then paused and shook his head. “It doesn’t matter. Whatever, Potter, I will do whatever it takes. I was a coward, and a fool too, but seeing her tonight… I know I can’t keep this up. Everything’s bloody backfired but whatever, it doesn’t matter anymore.”
“Yes, right now. Do you want to kiss me right now?”
“Just so you know,” she said conversantly, “if you ever disappear on me again, I’m going to personally murder you.”
Something ignited in the hollow that used to be his chest. “Wait – wait! Bloody hell,
“Maybe we could take some hairs from other Slytherin kids – Zabini and Parkinson or Crabbe or something. We can say we went with Draco to help him. I’m sure they won’t hurt their own children.”
“No,” he hurried to say, “nothing like that. Just some technical details I thought you should be aware of. Not to do with me.”
“I just observed, Potter. As simple as that.” Actually, it wasn’t so simple; Draco was fairly surprised with himself for remembering so many details of a life he barely even recognized anymore. He didn’t let it show.
being his friend? He forced himself to move past it, though, before he broke apart. This was a dangerous path to take, and he’d disappointed himself enough times by now to recognize it. No reason to cause more pain to his already weak psyche. Especially something like that which could cause damage deep enough to take him under.
“No,” Harry wasn’t getting it, for some reason. He was usually so good at seeing what Draco needed.
“Look at you!” he melted, approaching the little thing with a truly unmatched level of enthusiasm. “Oh, you’re doing so well, got to the food all on your own!”
It took some time for him to fill them in on all the details. Draco remained silent as he spoke, and the other two made the occasional remark of shock or disdain. At last he was finished and looked at them all, draped as they were in silence. Hermione sat with her chin in her hands, looking thoughtfully into the fire. Ron’s eyes were fixed on Draco, who refused to look at any of them and kept his glance on the rug. Harry ran his hands nervously through his hair, waiting for someone to say something.
He didn’t like this feeling, and day by day he began to resent the role Dumbledore has given him. Keeping an eye on Malfoy made him feel like a cop eyeing up a suspect, and it completely ruined his balance. He found himself staring at the Slytherin instead of focusing in lessons; looking at his face more than at the food on his own plate; even when he closed his eyes he could see him. It was unnerving, really. And it hadn’t even been a week.
“All right, we’re in. Granger, you have eyes on the exits?”
me. But that was it, and I was honestly over it like three months later. So can we just – I dunno, be friends again? I’m sick of this.”
He was in fucking control.
Draco nodded, his throat tight. “Do you… like it?”
For a second Draco could not gather the meaning of what he said, because his brain shut off after Potter said he
Perhaps it was the command, perhaps it was how he couldn’t stand it anymore, perhaps it was something else, but he didn’t stutter this time. “Who made the potion?”
“Oh, well done. Well done indeed.”
“Do you want me to – as well?” Potter asked somewhere in the distance, and his fingers grabbed the material of his boxers. Draco thought he nodded, but couldn't be too sure. This was… complicated. He knew it’s what he needs, and was fairly certain it’s what he wanted too, but it didn’t make it any less complicated. Even a compartmentalizing genius like himself could appreciate the difficulty in this situation. “Draco, we don’t need to. We can stop here.”
“You’re an absolute arsehole,” Draco said truthfully, the first thing that came to mind, then rested his head on Potter shoulders. “And… yes. Thank you.” They both fell silent.
money than he should by the end of the day, He would only get suspicious. Someone else had better come along, so he can slip them the extra. Someone come along now, he thought loudly, aiming his energy towards the street. Anyone.
“Well, first Macnair’s going to be interrogated about Marvolo, then he’ll be trialed. I’ve already spoken to Cap, I explicitly told him you won’t be giving evidence in person – if you agreed to, you can submit your memories, but you won’t have to face him ever again. Unless you wanted to, of course. I mean – Draco, whatever you want, okay? What’s going to happen from now on is only whatever you want.”
Draco stared at it, for a long while not even registering a thing, still completely shook from how he
“We have nothing in common, you sick bastard,” Harry retorted, because brave as he was, he was also a little bit stupid.
Fright buzzed in his abdomen. Draco could hardly even pay attention to what was going on around him. Gabriel and Potter talked about something silly or another, and all the while Draco tried very hard to think. Something bad, it was something… something important… then he gasped, audibly enough for everyone to turn to him immediately.
It came to him like another slap to the face. Draco jumped to his feet and tore the freezer open, dragging a bag of groats back to his corner and proceeding to spill its contents on the floor. Then he took all his clothes off, one garment after the other in what must have taken an hour at least, until he was naked and shivering with cold. Then, with a vicious pleasure that came from the sheer humiliation and the petrifying fear, he lowered himself onto kneeling on the still-frozen grains, feeling them scrape and tear his skin. It was extremely painful, and the longer he stayed there the worse it would be. Draco shivered even wilder, cold and bare and so very anxious, hoping that these drastic measures will relieve the terrible ache he felt inside. He closed his eyes, in his mind repeating the words he said a million times over, in his waking hours and in his dreams.
“Of course. Always, you tosser.”
“Just lie down, all right? You need to rest. You’re not strong enough to be walking around like that. I really think you should be seen by a – “
(See the end of the chapter for
“I understand,” Draco muttered, not letting go of him.
“It’s not a – Harry, I’m still me. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I’m
“What the – “ he actually spoke out loud, so deep into bewilderment he just couldn’t keep it in anymore. Five tomes and on top of them another note. Draco’s fingers
Draco was far too broken and stunned to do anything but obey. The portkey glimmered and shook, and an uncomfortable moment later they were in a flat that looked recognizable, yet wasn’t the one Draco expected to see. It wasn’t His. Must have really been a hallucination. What –
And in any case, gay or not gay, he was thinking about bloody Malfoy. This was way, way worse than bad. This was terrible.
The night lasted for literally ever, or at least that’s what Draco figured. The doze he fell into was abrupt, and he found himself awake again with no hope of getting any more sleep. Every single second ticked by slower than the previous, and he’d lost his patience about half an hour into his sleeping attempt. What the hell? He was not used to going to sleep on his own. He was not used to being alone in this room. A creature of habit if nothing else, Draco found this whole ordeal maddening. Not that he needed any help to get mad, thank you very much. The insane type of mad, for the record. Well, the angry type of mad, too. He was not above being angry with anything and everything in a hundred miles radius.
“Yes, I’m sure you do. Well, if you’re feeling well enough to throw insults, I take it you’re okay. I’ll just go on and finish making dinner, then?” Draco shrugged, and Potter’s chair scraped the floor loudly as he got to his feet. More rattling and grunting and clanking signified he was busy at work, and Draco took the time to try and master himself.
“No!” he exclaimed in horror, eyes turning between his two friends. “No, we haven’t done that yet! We just – just a little bit of – “ but he really wasn’t going to explain any further, and in any case, Malfoy decided now was the right time to follow them out, and he stopped next to Harry.
“Harry, please,” Draco’s eyes opened just in time to see his grin, too sweet to be truly evil. He was begging for his own ruin. But he couldn’t help himself, even if Harry was – even if this would never – Draco blinked away the dock of tears and focused on the glorious revelation before him. The shimmer in Harry’s horns, the glint in his eyes, the swish of his tail. God, but he wanted all of it. The room was unbearably hot, and Harry was even hotter, all around him – the layers of fabric between them thin enough for Draco to feel just how much he needed it too – and it was wrong, and it was right, and it was everything all at once, everything he longed for, and for once Draco wasn’t going to fight it –
“Fine. Whatever. Then no.”
Harry’s head was still spinning out of control when the world widened from the tight black hole and the kitchen emerged in front of his bewildered eyes. It was impossible that they were able to get out of there, absolutely unbelievable… his heart was beating a hundred miles a minute. Panting, crouching with two hands on his knees, Harry looked around. The house-elves were all in disarray, running wildly and shouting, carrying large trays full of what presumably was medicine. Nearer to him were the two desolate faces of Ron and Hermione, back to their own bodies, and the stunned image of Narcissa Malfoy. None of them spoke for a minute.
“Yeah, I have. I just… I wondered if I’d be able to do it.”
“Draco, say something, please.”
“No, don’t,” Harry was quick to look back at him and pull on a contrived smile. “So you like fireflies?”
This fic was about the last of the seven deadly sins,
“Because some poisons are very specific to the maker, and so to – never mind, it’s too long and you’ll fall asleep halfway through my explanation. Let’s just skip it. How was your day?”
“Ron…” Harry was too choked up to say anything for a long while. “You bloody arse, of course I wouldn’t mind. Merlin, never make any decisions on your love life thinking about me, all right? That’s just pure creepy.”
“Wife? You know, the woman you married? Red hair, tons of freckles, mean Bat-Bogey hex?” Draco didn’t understand why Potter looked like he slapped him. The last he read, when he was living in Cambridge after Azkaban, Potter was engaged to Weasley. Surely they tied the knot since then?
. I can’t even breathe without thinking about it anymore. And it’s all thanks to you, so if you’d be so kind as to just
It was nearing closing time, and Draco was just trimming some flowers when he heard the door open but saw no one come in. He was baffled at first, but then as he caught on he became so furious that he chopped a poor sunflower’s head right off. “What the hell do
Sometimes he wouldn’t feel sad, though. Sometimes he’d feel such rage – such bone-crushing, heart-stopping rage, he wouldn’t even be able to shout. It wouldn’t even have a center, just span the whole entire world, a terrible roar of a physical presence
Draco shook his head disbelievingly. “I will never be free, Harry. Until he kills me, or until I die, I will always have to carry this burden.” He took in a deep breath. “There's no turning back for me anymore. After what I’ve done to her…” his voice broke and he paused, unable to continue.
“Come on, Malfoy, admit it. Ever since I said no to you on the train first year, you went out of your way trying to get me to notice you. To be honest, it was pretty embarrassing to watch. I’m fairly sure I only reached out to you this year out of pity.”
“Honestly, I’m not! I’m just… I dunno. Excited, I guess.” Quickly he turned away from her, a bit startled by
“Yes, for
He pushed through the bedroom door and was still fairly surprised to find it unlocked. He gave the bed a long look, hesitation turning into fear turning into exhaustion. He was always doing this to himself, second-guessing, digging in the scabs till they reopened. Enough. Enough. He had enough of it already, and it’s not even been a full day. He gave the bed one last look, then placed himself curtly on the rug. There was only a certain amount of change he was willing to take at a time, and this was not the moment to experiment too much. Draco knew he’s only a hair width away from falling into the abyss of his own crazy. He wasn’t scared of it – he was terrified. In Draco’s mind, there was enough to keep him entrapped for eternity.
“Comfortable?” Malfoy smirked. Then he slammed the book shut and got up, walking slowly towards Harry. He landed quite hard on the mattress, sitting right next to him. “I’m not very comfortable, no.”
“Because I wanted to,” Draco breathed, looking down. Everything hurt. “Only because I wanted to.”
Just like that, Draco didn’t want to live anymore. He never felt this way before – through all the crap, through all the unbelievable
to go to Azkaban and see him, if he
“Yes, well, but he’s not even been renting it. There are no contracts or anything whatsoever suggesting anyone’s even lived there in the last ten years. Don’t you think it’s a bit odd, that he simply doesn’t exist in the flat on record? Why would he be hiding?”
“I knew that,” Draco said, his voice hollow. “Of course, I always knew. I was nothing but grateful, it… I’m so sorry about – I never wanted to hurt you.”
do it.
Potter.
“But, Potter… it’s not going to be… I’m just going to tell you to come every night. You’d be sick of me.” The thought wasn’t just humiliating, it was crushing. Potter, who didn’t let go of his hand, squeezed.
“You – “ Malfoy started but then stopped, his head falling into his hands. “You're just too much, Potter.” Harry tried to hold him, but Malfoy resisted, pushing him away and looking at him with eyes so large they were about to tear up. “You are too fucking much.”
“You used to be so much better at lying,” Potter hissed, and if that wasn’t true… “Draco, I – look, I know it’s not my place. I’m not going to tell you what to do. I can only say that if that’s what it did to
“Are you here to punish me, too?” He thought he knew now why Harry came to him. True that he has paid a lot already, and a heavy price indeed – he had been
this one-shot was inspired by Uranus, an ice giant (also a gas giant, if you’d believe it) four times as wide as earth! Had to make an arse joke there, didn’t I? Which... brings us to the last planet in our solar system! (very much not in order, yes, you're right).
“On what?”
“Are you okay?” he whispered, and Draco whimpered out loud with it all. “Draco?”
won’t do anything to anyone ever again.
“No one likes the whiskey,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “they just like the way it makes them feel.”
“Shut it, or what?” the boy asked in a wide smirk. Harry felt the familiar anger bubbling inside him.
The man didn’t turn at once; he added a few words to the letter he was writing, then rested the quill down. Draco pushed at Weasley’s chest, forcing him backwards and wishing he would get the hint.
It was like this all day; up and down, up and down, from the height of lucid pain to the lows of the drugged-up, mindless state the potions allowed him to be in. Draco was very clear on what he preferred, probably the first thing he felt clearly about in the longest time ever, but the Healers were of a different opinion. They kept bringing him up to measure him in all kinds of different spells, to give him potions and mark his responses, trying to figure out what exactly was the curse that bound him. If their rapid, whispered conversations were anything to judge by, they were unsuccessful. If his mother and Harry’s faces were to be believed, it was a very worrisome situation. Draco couldn’t find it in himself to be worried, though, not right now. He was so, so, so tired, even when all he did was sleep. He was tired and helplessly scared, although he didn’t know exactly of what. It was just there, the panic. And constantly in the back of his mind the thought was nagging, because there was
