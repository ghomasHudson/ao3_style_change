“Thanks ‘Mione!” Ginny smiles and she and Luna make their excuses as they go to greet more of their guests that enter their quaint little cottage to the open double doors that lead to a field that serves as their garden.
Draco wants to say, but he knows he can’t tell her. Pansy would tell him how stupid he was, thinking he could date Harry Potter. Falling in love with Harry
Draco grumbles, but settles into Harry’s arms. His back flush against Harry’s chest, Harry’s arm around his waist. Harry presses a soft kisses on Draco’s neck, “Better?”
When Harry pulls away, he lays on his back, pulling Draco along with him. Draco lays his head down on Harry’s chest. He loves listening to Harry’s heartbeat. It suits him and lulls him to sleep.
“Still, you had a big part in planning this wedding and found time to go shopping with me. Next to your very busy working schedule. If I’d known you were that busy I wouldn’t have bothered you with such a trivial thing”
Weasley grabs Blaise by his elbow and pulls him along to their own dorm, “I’ll tell you if it’s worth it ‘Mione.” He shouts over his shoulder.
“Yeah when you beat me twice, I realised you were really something. You know, now one really beat me since I was eleven.”
Besides our positions don’t really lend to a one on one game. Maybe you should find a chaser, or better yet another seeker to play a game.”
Harry smiles brightly and pulls Draco on top of him, “I’m going to book it in the morning.” Harry promises before kissing Draco again.
He’s not able to stop the moans any longer and now there's noone here to hear them he let's them come out loud.
Draco makes his way outside and Dan grabs hold of his arm and turns him around. Draco stumbles and his back hits the wall. Dan steps into his space. “I promise you Draco. I’ll give you the best shag you’ve ever had, and you’ll be over Harry in no time.”
“Yep, that's probably why I still have all these old clothes that I never wear anymore. I never used to have anything of my own, and now that I do, I sometimes sort of hoard them. At least that's what ´Mione says.”
They appear on the pavement before Draco’s apartment on Cornelia street. Draco recoils, but Harry pulls him along into the apartment.
“Yeah, I most certainly did!” Another bloke places four pints on the high table. “And you must be Draco.” He holds out his hand and Draco takes it. It’s cool and a bit damp from the pints he just carried. “Nice to meet you. I’m Dan.” The bloke – Dan – smirks.
“Honestly,” Avery comes down the flight of stairs, “It’s right here!” Avery is wearing a forest green dress that cuts at her knees and complements her red hair perfectly. Her hair is not the same natural red as her boyfriend but rather a bright painted red. She throws Harry a smile and rolls her blue eyes with obvious affection for her boyfriend as she walks into the drawing room. Ron bounces down the stairs, “Thanks babe!” He yells after Avery as he hops on one foot to pull the other shoe on. Harry rolls his eyes as well and follows Avery to the drawing room. He grabs his suit jacket of a chair and pulls it on.
Harry follows Draco through the room, out of the double doors. He can feel the eyes on him, but he doesn’t care. He only has eyes for Draco. Outside, a taxi awaits. Harry slides in after Draco.
“What do you mean what am I doing? We were set up on a date, so I’m just hurrying along the steps. So I can take you home.” He leans back in and Draco shuffles further away, he almost falls of off the bench, “Err,”
After a few snogging sessions of various couples, Pansy gets up. “This is boring! It’s like spin the bottle without all the tension, because only people who like each other are snogging.”
Theo’s writing down the important ingredients of a swelling solution, when someone sits down in the empty seat beside him. Normally he hates it when someone sits down so close next to him, but when he looks up and sees Hermione, he can’t stop the smile spreading on his face.
“I’m fine!” He says, but it isn’t true. He’s drunk in the back of the car and he is crying like a baby coming home from the bar. Pansy and Greg had picked this night to tell their friends that they were engaged. And Draco had drunk a bit too much. Jealous of his friends. They’re able to be together all the time and in public. And Draco wants the same. He doesn’t want to keep secrets just to keep Harry, but it’s the way it is.
Harry looks up grinning like a devil, “definitely not.” He says. He walks up to Draco and presses his lips to Draco´s temple, “that´s. That´s probably the best thing I´ve ever heard.” He whispers.
Once in their dorm, Potter spins around, “Why do you want to play quidditch with me? You’ve been glaring at me all year.”
“I know you mister Potter.” Maurice says, and Harry doesn't invite him to call him by his given name. Fuck no. instead he just looks at him in anticipation of the riveting conversation lines like this almost always introduce. Maurice clears his throat. “Head auror, right?”
“She might set you up with Malfoy, mate. Bloody hell can you imagine.” Ron shudders and they make their way to their beds in adjourning rooms. When Harry lays into his bed he stares up at his canopy. He mulls over the information he has gathered about Draco Malfoy. Though Harry can’t say he would want to be set up with Draco Malfoy, or even be friends with him. but he can’t deny that he finds Draco Malfoy incredibly attractive. Harry shakes his head and turns on his side. He doesn’t have time for thoughts like this. No, he needs to prepare himself for his conversation with Robards and then after he’s settled at work. Then he can focus on finding someone to settle with. Someone who isn’t as confusing as Draco Malfoy. Someone sweet. Someone nice. Still, when Harry closes his eyes all he sees are Draco Malfoy’s dimples. And when he falls asleep he dreams about Draco Malfoy’s tattoos.
“And why the fuck did you fuck me before you decided to pack up and leave me sleeping, naked might I add, in our bed. Knowing.
Harry leans in close and whispers in Draco’s ear, his breath ghosting his neck and ear. “We could dare Neville to snog Hannah. He’s had a crush on her since forever, you know?” Oh, Draco knows what that’s like.
Then suddenly he pulls out of Blaise’s arms. Blaise stumbles, but steadies himself before falling over. Ronald isn’t so lucky; he stumbles back over the char and lands on his bum on the floor. He scrambles up not meeting Blaise’s eyes, “I’m sorry I – I have to go. To do… stuff.”
The advantage Blaise thought he had vanishes when Ronald makes his next move. Blaise frowns, staring at the board. He has every attention on winning this game. He knows exactly what he’s going to have Ronald do, when he needs to collect his debt.
Before Harry gets to respond the portkey hurls them away. When they land they hurry along a field to the wedding. Harry slides in a seat next to Pansy, “Seriously though Potter. What is this suit?” Pansy eyes trail over him, “If you can even call it that?”
“Well yes of course Ronnie ponnie!” Ginny says,  “Don’t tell the others but you are my favourite brother.”
Angry, Harry ran towards them. What the fuck was Dan thinking?! Harry pulled him of off Draco and punched him hard across the face. Dan cursed at him, but Harry ignored him and focused on Draco, “Draco. Draco, are you alright?”
Draco scowls, “I don't read the Prophet Potter they only write fiction. Especially Rita Skeeter, who I guess wrote the article.”
Theo nods, “right.” He turns his attention back on the parchment in front of him and tries to swallow the bile in his throat. Normally Theo relishes in the silence of the Library, but right now all he can hear is the pounding in his chest and his own thoughts looping through his head;
Saturday morning Theo sets up in the library. He and Blaise have decided to both flirt with their part of the ‘Golden couple’ as Blaise calls them. Though Theo isn’t sure they’re a golden couple, shouldn’t a golden couple fit together perfectly? Nevertheless, Theo’s here now, waiting for Hermione to show up so he can try and flirt with her. Theo’s never been a good flirter, but he’s confident he can try it with Hermione, the way he feels can’t just be one sided.
“The golden Dragon.” Harry says with a little flinch, and Draco opens his mouth to find out how in Salazar´s name Harry managed to get a table at
“You didn’t tell me you’d set me up with someone this pretty Michael.” Dan says keeping his eyes on Draco.
Draco ignores him as he elbows his way out of the bar. Dan keeps on his trail, “You know that Michael and I decided were better of as friends. So, I’m single again too.”
“It’s just,” Draco pauses for effect and can’t help but smirk at Harry’s eager expression, “I don’t know what to wear.”
Draco moans and nods then stumbles towards the bed toeing off his shoes and socks as he goes. He sprawls on his back. Propping himself up on an elbow looking at Harry as he undresses. When he’s completely naked he pounces on Draco. literally pounces. They kiss desperately, Draco’s nails digging in his back as he clings to Harry. Draco feels Harry’s cock pressing into his thigh through his trousers. And Draco moans in Harry’s mouth. Harry fumbles with the buttons on Draco’s trousers and when they pop open, he flips Draco over. Harry pulls Draco’s trousers and pants of at the same time. His breath ghosts over Draco’s back as Harry moves down.
Draco eagerly takes it form him, “Thanks.” It’s strange to Draco how freely Justin used his first name, but since this is the first friendly contact he has had with someone who’s not one of his friends he’ll try and be polite. “Thanks, Justin.” Justin smiles and turns back to his conversation with Ernie.
“Blaise realises Ronald is teasing him, but even that knowledge can’t calm the pounding of his heart or the fluttering in his stomach. “No, it doesn’t work like that.”
Harry rolls off Draco, then turns to the side and looks at Draco. Harry’s green eyes always seem to look into Draco. He reaches out to push some stray hairs out of Draco’s face before cupping his head and pulling him close for a kiss. It seems like Harry tries to convey all his feelings in this kiss, it lingers and is full of love.
Harry glances over at Draco Malfoy, who’s talking to Parvatti and Lavender his hands waving around as he seems to be elaborately explaining something. Pansy is right, he is handsome. Hermione steers the conversation away from Malfoy even though Harry’s eyes keep trailing back to him. And when Pansy and Hermione say their goodbyes sometime later, Harry and Ron also decide to go.
“Draco!” Justin nudges Draco with his arm and Draco pulls his gaze from Harry. Potter. He needs to call him Potter in public.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bitch, she knows the answer. And though Draco doesn’t try to hide his sexuality anymore, he doesn’t want to flaunt it. And he definitely didn’t plan on telling anyone this year. Daphne knows this, but ever since the war she dislikes him even more. And this is her way of telling him to fuck off he guesses. “Blokes.” He says as he tries to make his voice sound as level. As if it means nothing for him to share this information with his classmates. Even though gasps sound around the room, Draco tries to ignore it as he decides who to pick.
“Well not exactly no. I do help with some arrangements, but it’s because of all the weddings that are going to take place this year.”
“He’s gone missing. Ran out of my apartment by the mention of your name.” She lowered her voice, “I know you’re the one who broke his heart.”
“Okay.” Michael stands up, “Okay!” He says more to himself than to Draco and Potter, “Wish me luck.” He says before stalking determinedly to the bar.
It takes forever to fall asleep and when he does, he dreams of the war. He’s back at the battle of Hogwarts. Voldemort’s enormous snake is circling him and Greyback is eating someone, who looks like Dumbledore. And it seems like Voldemort is winning. Draco looks around for Harry, but he isn’t there.
Ronald blinks a few times. “You’re such a prick.” He says as he bunches up the front of Blaise’s shirt and pulls him against himself. Their lips crashing together.
Draco watches Harry walk away before grabbing the chair up from the floor and turning back to his work. The tea and pastry Harry had brought him wait on the desk under a carefully cast warming charm.
“So, I went out to the muggle world and I like to find unique places with really good food. So, I ended up wandering around one night and stumbled up on this place. And the food is really delicious.”
Hermione smiles and closes her book, “Want to leave to studying for now and go to Hogsmeade instead?”
Though Theo had the brilliant idea to steal the redhead’s girlfriend he’s afraid of conflict and especially with someone bigger and fitter than himself. He might be good in a debate but when it comes to strength, he doesn’t have a single idea what to do.
Pansy all but stormed up to him and pulled him aside. When she was sure there wasn’t anyone looking at them or listening in, she slapped him across the face.
I don’t know why you are laughing mate.” Ron says. “This means you’re the only one who’s still single.”
When Weasley’s gone for about ten minutes, Theo realises now is his chance, he looks over to Hermione and she looks back at him expectantly. She smiles a soft smile that makes Theo’s stomach flip. Is she waiting for him to come over? He gets up and turns his attention on the papers and books on his table. He makes sure he’s gathered everything, before looking back up at Hermione.
“I’m so happy to see you again, it’s been far too long. The letters just haven’t been enough.” She says the bright smile not falling from her face.
Blaise and Weasley are immerged in their game so Draco gathers his courage and looks at Potter, “So,”
“And again, they’re both single. Also aren’t they invited to most of the same weddings? Seems like perfect date material to me.” Avery backs Hermione up.
Harry wants to run over to him and press their lips together. Hold him close as he presses his face in the crook of Draco’s neck to inhale his delicious smell of lemon and spice. But he doesn’t want to scare him away, so he stays back. Only his eyes following Draco’s every move. Draco doesn’t even glance at him once.
I ever told ‘I love you’ to. And I – I can’t hurt like this ever again. I really, really can’t. Never again.”
“Daphne is Millie’s maid of honour and Blaise is Theo’s second best man.” Draco says as if that makes him less impressive.
Seeing Draco with Dan stirred feelings in Harry he’s been trying to push down ever since he walked away from Draco. Love. He’s in love with Draco. He wants to be with
“That’s what I’ve been telling you in all my letters.” Hermione smirks. “And don’t worry Ron. I’m sure you’ll like Pansy once you get to know her. She has the same sense of humour as you do.”
“Gosh!” Ginny’s red hair catches Harry’s eyes as she and Luna come up beside Hermione, “You guys are so tan now!” Both girls take their turns hugging Harry and Ron. “It must be from all that outside dragon taming you’ve been doing in Romania.” Ginny giggles.
It’s dusty inside and Harry frowns before casting some cleaning spells through the kitchen and sitting room.  He puts the cattle on and asks Draco to sit down on the couch with a movement of his hand.
“Well you know how the Dragon reserve is a bit of England with in Romania, but not all Romanians are so happy about it and there was quite a lot of crime when we first arrived. So I’ve been working for the ministry, kind of err auroring about you could say.”
Dan runs his finger over Draco’s jaw, turning his gaze away from Harry to himself. He wets his lips and presses them against Draco’s. Draco jumps away in shock, “What are you doing?!”
Harry takes of the undershirt he wears under his auror robes and puts on the new clothes Draco demanded he try. “Well? What do you think?” Harry rotates in a small circle.
Blaise had seen less of Ronald this week then he had since the start of this school year, a month ago. Every time Blaise caught Ronald alone, or set up a chess game. Potter came and demanded all of Ronald's attention.
They fall asleep like this. Pansy sleeps right through, but Draco’s flashbacks keep waking him up at least once every hour. Every time he closes his eyes images of him and Harry flash through is mind.
year Ravenclaws sitting nearby hear him. Hermione flushes red. It’s clear she doesn’t appreciate Weasley making such inuendoes in public. But with a soft smile at Theo she led Weasley to a small empty table. It’s not particularly private but it’s clearly a table for two.
“Of course, I did. Wait here.” Draco runs up the stairs. When he enters the bedroom, he realises that he’s still carrying the picture frame. He places it on the bedside table next to Harry’s side of the bed, next to Harry’s books. Draco has read them all as well now. He reads them when he wants to wait up for Harry. He grabs the scroll from the bed and runs back down the stairs. When he steps back into the kitchen Harry´s still staring at the camera. Draco clears his throat before speaking and Harry looks up at him and smiles. “It isn´t much,” Draco starts as he hands over the scroll, “But it has some sentimental value that I thought you might appreciate.”
“That’s because you buttoned it crookedly.” Hermione says as she starts unbuttoning his shirt and refastening it.
“What do you have there?” Draco asks. When Harry stumbles through the floo after his work on Monday with a black bag in his hand.
“Yes, you do,” Theo smirks, “You’re staring at the Gryffindor table.  It’s almost a pathetic as Draco over there.” Theo points over his shoulder at Draco a bit further down the table.
Draco jumps up and the chair he´d been sitting on promptly falls to the ground. He closes the little distance between them and presses his lips onto Harry´s. Harry chuckles against his lips before wrapping his arms around Draco and deepening their kiss.
“I'm going to vanish them as soon as possible.” Draco says without looking up. He just keeps grabbing shirts and throwing it on the throw away pile.
“What?! No, I didn’t. When would I have done that? And why would I buy this much?” Harry looks round his living room which seems to be stuffed with bags.
As he walks away, he wonders if it’s normal to say that you have to attend to best man duties. And he mostly wonders why this conversation with Maurice rattled him so much. It’s not like it should matter to him if Maurice and Draco have had a relationship. That does not mean they’re in a relationship right now. And even if they are, why would that matter to Harry? it’s not like he and – It’s not like he is jealous. Jealous of Draco. Draco being able to have a relationship next to his busy work schedule? Or just Draco having a relationship? No that can’t be it. Harry shakes his head as if that will clear it. He needs to have a drink. And maybe take Ron up on his offer to introduce him to the bloke that works in diagon near George’s shop. Maybe that will make him less jealous of other people’s relationships.
“Come on Ron!” Harry yells up the stairs, “We’re going to miss our portkey if we don’t floo to Hermione now.”
Good Theo thinks, Blaise’s not denying it, so he read him correctly. Now he can start part two of his plan. But Blaise stands up and stalks out of the great hall.
Harry looks up at Malfoy, his grey eyes not meeting Harry’s instead he stares at his fingers. Harry’s surprised that Malfoy told him anything at all. “You’re young to become a master healer.” Harry states, trying to keep the conversation away from their troubled past. Because he knows that will most definitely lead to some sort of fight, which Harry really doesn’t want. Especially not if they’re going to have to work together in the future.
“We’ll we,” Pansy indicates between her and Greg, “are done seeing all three of you mope. So, what are we going to do about it?”
“Honestly Potter. I think I recognized the shirt you were wearing when we went to Dominique from our 5
Draco tries to hide his shaking hands and blinks back his tears. He was right. Potter did leave him for her. He feels his friends’ eyes on him, and shakes his head, “No-Nothing.” He stammers.
He swallows and realise that this is the moment he’s been waiting for. That he should lean in and capture her lips with his. But they’re in the library and Theo always judges others for kissing here. He’s judged Hermione and Weasley before. And Theo’s afraid, not necessarily of Weasley, but what will Hermione do when he kisses her. Will she kiss him back? Will she pull away? Will she slap him across the face, run off and never want to talk to him again?
“Ah, I guess since you’ve been away you might not have heard. But I’m being promoted to head of Magical law Enforcement and I’ve been tasked with finding my replacement as Head Auror.” When  Harry doesn’t say anything Robards continues, “I’ve picked you Harry.”
“What are you smiling about mate?” Ron and Avery come back from the dancefloor followed by Hermione who was dancing with her girlfriend who is now talking to Draco and Lavender Brown.
Draco pushes down his disappointment. He knew this would happen when he asked Harry home, and when he saw him in his sheets. He falls back on his sheets, how could he have thought spending a night with Harry
“Yes. She was an auror trainee. Top of her class. She volunteered actually, wanting to go abroad. She’s now Ron’s fiancée.” Harry smirks.
Harry opens the scroll carefully as to not damage the parchment. His eyes flash over the paper and his lips part in O. “My parents wedding certificate?”
He took Draco back home and begged him to take him back. Draco told him he need time and Harry understood. He really did.
“Strip. Take off your clothes. Don’t worry you can keep on your pants.” Blaise glances at Draco, “for now.”
“Good, you were so hard to ignore anyway.” Harry says trailing a hand over his chest. And leans in for another kiss. After a short snogging session, Draco pulls away and steps from Harry’s lap.
“No, but Malfoy was talking about how he wanted to suck Harry’s cock.” Ron’s says turning slight green again.
“Err, yeah. I think. Robards wants to see me to talk about what I did in Romania and what I’m going to do now that I’m back in England.”
“My grandfather is an expert on sedative potions, and Draco had an internship with him for a couple of months. And when he lived in Berlin, we saw each other quite often.”
“Darling what’s wrong?” Pansy isn’t strong enough to keep him up, so when he falls to his knees, she sits down with him. She pushes his hair out of his face, “Draco?”
Potter sits up, an arm around Draco’s waist to keep him steady and kisses him deeply. With his free hand he unbuttons Draco’s trousers and takes out Draco’s cock, wrapping a hand around it. The angle is a bit awkward, but when Harry moves his hand, Draco gasps and moans. He tilts his head back and closes his eyes. Harry leans his head on the crook of Draco’s neck.
Seamus easily chugs his drink then turns to Greg to dare him to chug a bottle in one go. Greg in his turn asks Susan Bones who her crush is and surprise, surprise, it’s Potter. Draco throws his drink back in one go.
“So, I was wondering,” Maurice starts, and Harry forces himself to focus on the man in front of him, “that you could help me since you’re head auror. I just came to England, and I have completed my auror training in Germany and I’m looking for a position.”
“One night stands?” Pansy interjects helpfully with a smirk. “Merlin you’re just like Draco. At least you’re both handsome enough to still get laid when single.”
“Oh, we did see the game.” Pansy says, “Blaise is just sad that he couldn’t get a good view at his boyfriends bum.”
Malfoy smiles weakly and Harry wants to say more, but the waitress sets down their drinks and they order lunch.
Harry pushes in an extra finger and Draco rolls his eyes back in pleasure, “Salazar, Harry! Harry, Harry.
“So, as I was saying. Before sleeping beauty over there joined us.” Blaise smirks at Draco before turning to Pansy and Greg.
“Like it?” Draco glances up at Harry, who worries his lower lip between his teeth and has a serious frown. “I love it. I – Thank you. No one ever made me a cake before.”
Since Ron and Avery have moved out to their own apartment near Diagon Ally, Harry hadn't expected to come home to someone. Especially not to Draco Malfoy. He probably should have when he answered Draco’s note with request of his floo address this morning, but it didn´t even cross his mind. Harry stands still staring at his living room and all the paper bags and his clothes that overcrowded the room, and the blond head in the middle. “Malfoy?” Harry asks.
Harry nods affirmatively, “but today isn’t about us Theo. How are you feeling? Now that you’re a married man.”
“I trust your sense of style, Malfoy.” Harry says grinning, as he kicks off his shoes and steps out of your robes.
“Of course, you did.” Harry drops the old t shirt he had pressed against his chest and walks to his floo. “You hungry Malfoy? I'm ordering take out for us since we'll probably be here all night. Harry looks over his shoulder right as Draco vanishes the shirt Harry had held. Harry rolls his eyes and says he'll be right back. He steps through his fireplace and steps out at his favourite Italian place on Diagon. He orders a salad and two different pastas at the counter. Ten minutes later he steps back through the floo with his and Draco's dinner. When he steps back out at home Draco has placed the bags off the couch and the table and sets the low table with some cutlery and plates. He looks up when Harry arrives. “I hope you don't mind that I grabbed this from your kitchen.” He also places two glasses filled with water on the table. “I don't mind at all” Harry says as he places the plastic bag with their food in the middle of the table.
“I did, thank you Gawain.” Harry tells Robards, but his eyes seek out the other person in the room. He sits in one of the two chairs opposite of Robards desk, his eyes on Harry and his hair in a neater style than that it was at the party. His throat and arms covered with the robes of an master healer. He looks curiously at Harry, “Hello Potter.” He says with a inclination of his head.
Draco arches his back, one hand grabbing the sheets. The other tightens in Harry’s hair, pulling, urging him on and begging for more.
“Carbonara please.” Draco takes the box from Harry's hands. They eat in a peaceful quiet. Harry notices that Draco leaves the tomato pieces that were in the salad on the side of his plate and he quickly steals them with his fork. Draco looks at him out of the side of his eyes and smirks as he steals an extra piece of cheese from Harry’s plate. Harry chuckles, and even though he likes his salad with cheese as well he lets Draco get away with it.
“Also, I think my knowledge of German will be a great addition to the work force.” Maurice continues hesitantly when Harry doesn’t say anything.
Harry’s hand dips lower and wraps it about the both of them, making them both moan from deeply within. It only takes a few moments till Draco is spluttering a gasping. Harry following him suit.
“Draco.” Harry interrupts him. “This is truly one of the best gifts I’ve ever received.” Harry looks up and Draco can see tears in the corners of his eyes.
And Draco tries. He really does. But the game just goes on without him. Sometimes a loud noise will advert his attention for a little while, but his gaze always finds its way back to Harry. His muscles ripple beneath his skin. Every time he stretches Draco gets a clear view of his stomach, six perfect little packs and a small strip of dark hair leading down into his pants. Pulling Draco's gaze lower. Then he feels guilty and flicks his eyes back to Harry's face, starting the whole process again.
“I didn’t. Not really. Dan told me about Harry and I thought it be fun for us all the meet up. I actually thought Harry sounded more as someone for you then for me. I told Dan that, but I think he saw you and decided to try his luck. That’s what he always does you know. Try his luck.”
Malfoy orders a earl grey tea and Harry a regular coffee. When the girl leaves with a last bright smile at them, Malfoy grabs a menu hand hides his face behind it.  Harry clears his throat awkwardly, “So you’ve become a healer?” Malfoy hums in reply. Harry clears his throat again and flips the menu open. “I wanted to give back.” Malfoy says putting his menu down, “after everything.”
“Being the best delivery service money can buy.” He smirks at Draco. “Well maybe not money, but sex. Spectacular sex.”
“That’s not what I meant.” Harry laughs and when Draco frowns at him he explains further, “I meant this spending the day in bed. You and me intertwined. Eating take out and drinking expensive wine.”
Granger runs down the stairs a bag swung around her and books in her arms, “Ready?” she asks Theo. He nods eagerly and they start toward the door.
Harry didn’t know where to start, but he was still glad to be away from the party. With all those prying eyes and questions, he didn’t know how to answer. He went to the apartment on Cornelia street first, but of course he wasn’t there. Pansy would have checked it first.
When Pansy, Greg and Blaise showed up at the party, Harry’s heart sped up. Did that mean Draco was here? If he was here, Harry didn’t think he could fake not being in love with him. However, he wanted to see Draco badly. He hadn’t realised he missed Draco this much until he came so close to seeing him again. But he didn’t spot the recognizable blond hair.
Draco shrugs and gratefully takes the drink from the waitress, “Nope,” again he lets the p pop. “I get drunk but it’s not enough, cause when the morning comes, he’s still not there.”
The box is filled with his favourite French chocolates, but Draco doesn’t have the appetite to eat any of them. Ever since he started his desk job at the lower levels in the Ministry his father has been telling him he doesn’t need to work. That he needs to find a wife and produce an heir. “You’re the last Malfoy,” his father would say, “You need to make sure that the Malfoy name will continue. Don’t waste your time on work that’s beneath you.” And Draco would stare down at his plate and excuse himself as soon as he could.
Blaise can’t help but grin as he stands up. Ronald takes the hand Blaise lends him. He pulls him up and their chests bump into each other. Blaise curls his hand around Ronald’s neck, the top of his finger tangle in the red strands of hair. He wets his lips with his tongue and sees Ronald’s eyes follow the movement.
“Oh, that doesn’t matter Theo,” Pansy says, falling on the couch next to Hermione, “She just wants you in those tight robes. Don’t worry ‘Mione, we’ll organise a game when the weather clears up. so, we can have a proper viewing.”
Not allowing himself to second guess, Blaise leans in and kisses him softly. Ronald makes a surprised sound that sounds like,
Draco scoffs, “I was the one that wanted to be friends.” Draco starts sorting through the pile in front of him. “I can tell the wrong sort for myself thanks.” He mimics a high whiny voice.
And even though Dan’s in Draco’s space and trying very hard to keep his attention, Draco’s eyes keep trailing back to Potter. Who’s having a normal conversation with Michael. His hands around a cold glass and it makes Draco want to know that body like it’s his own. He certainly has filled out since Hogwarts. Gone is the scrawny little boy from Draco’s childhood, it’s been replaced with a broad shouldered, muscular man. His eyes are still the same sparkling green as from young Draco’s dreams and fantasies. But his old thick rimmed glasses have been replaced with a thinner model, though it’s still a round shape. It suits him. He still got that boyish look that Draco likes in a man.
They sit down next to each other and Harry places the salad in between their plates. “Carbonara or Bolognese?” He asks Draco.
Draco reads the note with a smile on a face. Though Harry´s handwriting is a mess and almost unreadable and he left him to wake up alone, Draco can´t help but be happy that Harry took the time to think about what Draco had said after their first night together.
When the game ends Ronald throws Blaise one of his rueful smiles and Blaise can’t help but grin back. His heart pounding fast in his chest.
Draco is putting on the kettle when someone knocks on the front door. No one ever comes through his front door; Harry always uses the floo. Draco closes his bathrobe tighter around himself and opens up the front door.
As soon as he saw the sun come up the following morning, he knew he should have waited. He should have told Draco that he was leaving, instead of leaving him to wake up alone. Instead he ran away like a coward because it would hurt too much to say it face to face. But he couldn’t go back now. It wouldn’t make sense; Draco was probably mad at him anyway. It makes no sense to go back to start an argument just to leave him again.
Harry and the Weaselette are standing on a street corner, really close together. Picture Harry holds both of her hands in his and Picture Weaselette keeps pressing a kiss on his cheek and pulling back with a bright red face.
“Of course! It’s your birthday!” Harry bounces. “I made reservations at a very fancy restaurant for an early dinner or a late lunch whatever you want to call it. So, we can drink in the afternoon and have the rest of the night for ourselves.” Harry smirks, “I made special plans for tonight as well, but those are secret.”
“Lunch?!” Michael looks like he’s seriously considering taking away Draco’s drink, so he downs it. It’s too much, so a bit drips down his chin.
Harry laughs and they hurry through the floo. When they stumble out in Pansy and Hermione’s apartment. “Good you’re here.” Hermione starts, she rumbles about and grabs an broken umbrella with a flower pattern. “Everybody hold on it’s ready to set off in about a minute.” They all hurry to hold on to the umbrella. Harry ends up between Pansy and Avery. “What are you wearing, Potter?!” Pansy asks Harry.
A brilliant smile overtakes his face, “I feel brilliant. Today has been great, everyone’s here, the sun shines and Millie looks beautiful.” He looks wistful, “She just keeps smiling and she shines, and her dress is beautiful of course. But that’s thanks to this guy,” he slaps Draco on his back, “the best best man.”
Wait, it isn’t a dream. This is really happening. Harry Potter is really kissing him. Making him feel all these things, not just in his head, but... Draco pulls away slowly, he really can’t get a hard on with all his classmates around. Harry gives him a shy smile and it makes Draco want to pull him back in and continue what did they started. They stand close, both breathing hard.
“Nice to meet you Draco.” Potter – Harry – says and he pulls Draco against him and presses his lips back against Draco’s.
Draco turns away from his friend, Michael; a muggle who’s shown him all the good bars and clubs to pick up boys. It’s dim in the bar and Draco doesn’t recognise the person at first, but something happened. He heard him laughing, saw the dimples first and then he heard the accent. “Potter?”
He pushes Draco over on his side and aligns their bodies. Rubbing together perfectly. They’re both panting more then kissing. Their heads leaning against each other, Draco’s right leg thrown over Harry hip and one of his hand is holding on to Harry’s ass trying to pull him even closer. His other holding on to Harry’s neck holding their heads together.
Harry hums, trying to sound unaffected. But they saw each other? Romantically? Sexually?! He tells himself to stay calm and just walk away. Maybe he can ask Pansy. “If you excuse, I have best man duties to attend to.” Harry says with a what he hopes is a polite nod.
“We? Why would you?  Ahh” a look of clarity crosses Blaise’s face. Theo must admit it unnerves him a bit. “You want to get into Granger’s pants!”
“I’m glad you guys came too; these games are always more fun with more people.” Justin Flinch – Fletchy says as he comes to sit down next to Draco.
Draco manages to throw a surprised look at Blaise just before Parvati stumbles into the hijacked charms classroom. “Couldn’t find an empty bottle.” She announces. A disappointed gasp sounds through the room.
“A couple of months ago, when Ron, Avery and I first started talking about going back, I talk to Kingsley and Gawain about it. They found a few aurors who were interested into coming to Romania. So I err, kind of trained them, so now they’re working there.”
“I think I can get some time off around then. It’s never really busy around that time anyway.” Draco says trying to sound casually, but his heart beats rapidly in his chest. Does this mean Harry wants to take their relationship a step further?
After sitting at the kitchen table, staring in his cold cup of tea. Draco gets up and goes after Harry to the bedroom.
Merlin, it still hurts. It’s been 2 months and he still hasn’t heard anything from him. It’s been so hard not to contact him, but Harry knows he needs to give Draco the space he asked for. Harry realises he really hurt Draco. He just hadn’t realised how much.
Malfoy snorts, “Of course not Potter. Unless you want the prophet and all your fans to fall all over you.”
As soon as Draco is outside, he apparates to the first bar he can think of. Of course, it’s the bar he met Harry in all those months ago. But right now, he doesn’t care, he needs to drink. He was about to have a late lunch anyway.
Both of the boys stare daggers at their friends. But Blaise leans in again, pressing his lips more forcefully against Weasley’s. Who, surprisingly leans into Blaise’s embrace and kisses him back eagerly. When they pull apart Blaise walks back with a smile on his face.
“Want me to enlighten you?” Blaise slowly closes the gap between them wrapping an arm around Ronald’s waist.
“Sure.” Harry grabs Malfoy’s upper arm, and with a turn of his heels Malfoy apparates them away. They land into a small alley and Malfoy leads Harry around the corner. Harry notices they’re in a muggle area as Malfoy leads them to a small café.
Draco toes of his shoes as well and throws his ruined shirt next to the bed. Harry steps in between Draco’s legs and tips his head up with a finger under his chin. He kisses him deeply, Draco actually groans deep in his throat when Harry’s hand roam over his chest.
“Yeah, yeah.” Harry stands up. “4 more.” He looks round the table. Michael and Draco both nod, “And buy some shots!” Dan shouts when Harry walks away.
The Golden Trio walks into the common room and both Granger and Weasley throw smiles in their direction. Potter, however, looks in the opposite direction. Even though both Blaise and Theo have been saying how into Draco Potter is, Draco doesn’t see it. Neither does he believe it. At least not until he sees it.
Draco doesn’t do anything but gape at Harry. He’s still here. He’s making him breakfast. Draco can’t comprehend anything about this situation. The craziest thing may be that Harry’s wearing a pair of Draco’s pants.
Harry glances at Malfoy then looks him up and down again. He wears tailored blue trousers and a white shirt with rolled up sleeves, showing off his tattoos again. “It was the only thing I had.” Harry shrugs.
“But this isn’t part of your question, is it?” Draco asks hastily as he sees Harry starting to get up.
Draco wakes up to the sound of an owl ticking on his bedroom window. He groans and forces himself to get up and open the window. His parent’s owl scoops in, a package in his claws. He gives it to Draco after several threats. The note is written his mother’s cursive handwriting.
“Yes. I – I do.” Draco frowns at Harry, who plates scrambled eggs and bacon on two plates. “Why are you still here?” the words are out of his mouth before he can think about it.
to. Well of course then bend me over for the chosen one. The saviour. He gets what he wants. One moment he wants to fuck the death eater the next he gets back together with his ex-girlfriend and to make ginger babies.”
“You should listen more often to your girlfriend, little sis.” Ron says with a smirk as Harry pulls the package from his pocket. He spells it back to its original size before handing it to Luna, “We hope you like it.” He says with a soft smile.
“Sssh,” Draco pulls him up and presses a hand over Harry’s mouth, “I hear someone coming.” Draco hastily grabs his wand, summons their clothes and shoes and closes the curtain with a swish.
“It’s just an old suit that I found in the back of the closet. It’s the only thing I had.” Harry shrugs.
The golden trio gather round near the staircases to the dormitories and start whispering. Potter throws a glance in Draco’s direction. When he sees Draco looking, he hurriedly looks away and starts talking hurriedly at his friends.
Hermione is completely absorbed in her books. Weasley however, doesn’t seem to even bother on his studies. He keeps distracting her with touches and kisses. Can’t he see that this is bothering her? Hermione’s clearly uncomfortable being this close in public. Especially in the library, her hide away place. Theo understands her completely. Unlike Potter, Weasley and even Blaise and Draco, they have had many friends during their early Hogwarts years. Theo’s honestly surprised he’s starting to gain more friends this eight year. They both used the library to hide away in earlier years. But till this year they hadn’t seen much of each other. Maybe every now and again, but their opposite positions of their houses made them stay clear of each other. Now they share a common room and their classes are smaller, so they see much more of each other. Maybe they see each other really for the first time. They have a lot in common and Theo admires her determination and her excessive knowledge. And now she always chuckles softly at his sarcastic comments in classes of remarks about their books. Every time she does so, it makes Theo’s stomach flutter.
“We have a reservation.” Harry says. And Draco raises an eyebrow. He didn’t know Harry had planned this. It makes his stomach flutter.
“It’s barely been used.” Blaise summons his chess set and places on the small table on the opposite of the room near the fire.
A couple of moves later Blaise has a little advantage again. And he knows he has to play it smart if he wants to win. He glances through his lashes at Ronald, “I have decided what I want when I win.”
“Merlin Draco,” Potter says training is fingers through Draco’s hair. The use of his first name makes something in his chest flutter.
Draco’s friends drive off with a final glance in his way. After a few minutes he sneaks in through the garden gates. Just to seal his fate.
Inside the box is a birthday cake. “Happy birthday Draco” spell the letters on the cake and the candles circling the cake light up.
“Yes, what the fuck are you doing here?!” Dan stalks towards them and Draco flinches and tries to slink away from Dan’s approaching figure. Harry notices it and steps in between them.
Potter now standing alone, looking a bit lost grabs Granger arm, “‘Mione,” he whines, throwing a look at the couch. Granger follows his gaze and sighs.
“You’re always going on about how Malfoy is the only one who gives you a challenge. And you do like challenge.” Weasley supports his girlfriend.
When they tumble on the bed Draco pulls Harry on top of him. Harry trails kisses over Draco’s jaw down his neck. Over his chest, down to his stomach and –
Weasley nods, probably more to himself than anyone else, before standing up. Weasley is tall, but Blaise is taller, so he has to tilt his head to look into Blaise’s eyes. Hesitantly Blaise cups Weasley’s face and gently brushes his lips against Weasley's.
“Why?” Pansy turns around and takes his face in her hands, “I’m sure there’s no one here who wouldn’t want to kiss that pretty face of yours love.” She drops her hands to his wrists and pull him along towards the circle that Lavender and Padma are urging everyone in. Pansy drops Draco next to Blaise, “You two sit down and participate. I don’t know why I didn’t insist on you two coming earlier.” She spins around and stalks to Lavender and Padma.
Once he sinks back down on their bed, right in the spot where he let Harry fuck him last night, he realises how empty this room feels. Without all Harry’s things there’s no life left in this room. The picture frames with pictures of Harry and his annoying friends and the one of his parents are gone, he even took the one with the picture of Harry and Draco together. There are no folders of Harry’s cases scattered about and his clothes are all gone. Draco’s clothes from last night still lay abandoned on the floor in front of him.
“Then why exactly do I have to try them on?” Harry asks as he already starts unbuttoning his auror robes.
“I´ll make sure l get off soon tonight.” Harry says smilingly before grabbing Draco close and kissing him soundly.
Right then Potter drops into the empty chair next to Hermione. Talking in earnest whispers, “I’m just going to stay here with you ‘Mione. Hide away from that blond git.”
“No Harry, nonsense. Please take a seat.” Robards motions to the chair next to Malfoy. “It’s actually great timing.” Robards continues, “Malfoy here is going to be the new Master Healer responsible for the aurors, and with his potion background he’s our go to guy for consults on potions and poisoning cases. Which I hope you will continue to do even with your promotion.”
“Me?” Weasley looks around flustered, his faces turning red. “But I’m not. I mean I never, err I don’t”
’re the one for me, not Ginny. It never was Ginny; I see that now. And I don’t know why I didn’t realise this before. I know I don’t deserve another chance, but if you give me one. I promise, I swear I’ll never let you wake up alone ever again.” Harry stops pacing and looks at Draco. Their eyes meet, Harry’s are bright, red, and wet.
The rest of the dinner passes in a blur. Somehow Draco manages not to moan with every bite. But Harry hadn’t managed not to look smug all through dinner. They shared a dessert because Draco insisted, he was full, but he still managed to eat most of it.
“Draco. Malfoy. It really is you.” Potter’s unusual eyes sparkle, “What are you doing here? In this mu- this bar?”
“You sure you don't want to stay for a drink?” Harry asks as he sits up. He can't explain it, but he feels the need to make sure Draco will stay just a little bit longer.
Harry startles as the old elf stands in front of me, “Merlin Kreacher!” Harry says as he presses his hands against his chest, “Warn a guy will you. I forgot that you were here.”
Pansy pulls his empty glass from his hands and shoves in a new, full one. Draco huffs “I was actually thinking about going back to my dorm. Blaise is moping.”
“Flattery won't get you out of it.” Draco says, “Try it with these.” Harry catches a pair black slacks Draco throws his way.
When Harry finally got home, Draco was already there. He was busy with the owls. Harry pressed a quick kiss on his neck and ran up the stairs to change.
“I know it’s all me, in my head. I’m the one who burned us down.” Draco say the words he’s been practising. “But it’s not what I meant. I’m sorry that I hurt you. I know that I’m a handful and I know that I can be overdramatic.”
Draco smiles as he looks down at the photo, in its him and Harry hold onto each other and smile brightly. “I think there’s an empty picture frame somewhere.” He pulls open a couple of drawers before he finds what he’s been looking for. He puts the picture in the frame, “I’m going to get you my present now.”
Harry chuckles, “I was thinking we could go after Christmas and celebrate New year’s together by sending it between the sheets?”
And Blaise takes his open mouth as an opportunity to deepen the kiss. Ronald grabs Blaise’s bicep to steady himself as he melts into Blaise’s touch. Blaise places his other hand on the small of Ronald’s neck to pull him a bit closer.
“Draco?” Harry lets his fingers ghost over Draco’s stomach, “Are you okay with this? Do you want this?” His fingers now trail over the zip of his trousers.
“I- uh” Potter sighs, “Let’s get changed.” He turns and starts toward their shared room. Draco and Potter share a dormitory with Theo and MacMillen.
Draco slams the evening issue of the prophet on the kitchen counter. He’s had a long and tiring day at the ministry, filing away old auror cases. Aurors kept checking up on him, he doesn’t know what they were thinking. What could Draco possibly do with the old, and then he means old, files.
Harry presses kisses all over Draco’s stomach, before tentatively pressing a kiss on Draco’s prick. Draco can no longer hold back his moan. Which only seems to encourage Harry, who licks the length of Draco’s cock before taking the tip into his mouth and bobbing his head up and down and his tongue swirling the head.
“Definitely,” Blaise grins one of his predatory grins and holds out his hand. Weasley takes it and they shake shortly.
"Potter." Blaise looks form Draco to Potter and back again. They're staring at each other. And it all falls into place. Potter going on about a blond git, of course that can only mean one person. And it seems like he is just as infatuated with Draco as everyone knows Draco is with Potter. They're both just too stubborn to make the first move.
“Then why did Master forget that Kreacher was here?  Was Master distracted by the young mister Malfoy.”
“You’re just sad that we don’t spend all our attention on you anymore.” Greg says while he’s filling his plate.
That morning Harry woke up with a sleeping Draco pressed against his side. When Harry stirred, Draco woke up and started pressing kisses all over Harry’s chest. They had spent at least an hour in bed before getting out and ready for work. There was no time for breakfast, they were already late. Harry had thought about saying it then; “I love you.” He should have, but he didn’t. He pushed Draco against the kitchen counter and kissed him deeply, before rushing off to the Ministry. And
This, however, doesn’t seem to bother Dan. Because he starts the nibbling on Draco’s jaw. Draco tries to push Dan away, but he’s too drunk and stumbles. Dan pins Draco’s arms to his sides against the wall and presses his lips forcefully against Draco’s. Draco struggles, but he can’t seem to push Dan away.
“Well Potter, it may be good for you to get acquainted with healer Malfoy, since you are going to be responsible for the aurors.”
Draco throws him a dark look but leans down. He can’t believe he’s doing this. In front of his entire year. That Harry lets him do it.
"I'm not!" Theo objects, "I was just wondering. Besides how do you know it's not going well with Hermione and me?"
“Draco please. I know I probably have no right, but please drink this so we can have a proper conversation.” Harry holds out a bottle of hangover potion.
“So, let me get this straight,” Dan says, demanding Draco’s attention again. “So you were, unfairly handsome, incredibly vain and a bad boy?” Dan whistles.
“That’s mostly just been Ron though.” Harry says,  “That’s why he’s so tan all of a sudden. Though in the beginning he could only turn lobster red.” Ron is tan now, but still not quite close to Harry’s natural dark skin.
Draco looks at Harry, who’s staring at him wide eyed. “Did I say that out loud?” Draco asks, softly.
“First of all, it’s way too expensive. Not all of us are as rich as the Malfoys. Besides I’d look utter ridiculous in those clothes.”
He all but runs out of the common room. Blaise sinks down on a chair, and flicks his want to gather his chess set, then sends it sailing back to the dorm. He stares into the fire. The kiss was amazing even better than he had anticipated, and Ronald even kissed him back. But still Blaise can’t help but think that he screwed up somehow.
Ronald raises his eyebrow and leans over Blaise to look at the cover of the book. His knee pressed against Blaise’s thigh. His throat exposed just inches above Blaise’s mouth. He places one hand on Blaise’s chest to stabilise himself. “Really? Divination? I didn’t know you were into that.” He sits back, his had trailing slightly over Blaise’s chest.
Potter looks at him, his green eyes burning into his, “Okay.” The car drives away, as if the streetlights pointed in an arrowhead leading them home.
Dan leans in close, the alcohol clear in is breath. “It’s a pity though, you’re so pretty.” Dan walks away, towards the bar, a gleam in his eyes.
“I have an idea.” Millicent stands up and stalks towards Harry and Draco. She grabs a bottle of fire whiskey and spills a trail over Harry’s bare chest. “I dare Draco to lick it off.”
“What Malfoy means to say is that the people here still respect you and that you don’t have to worry about establishing your authority. And I’m not starting as Head of Magical Law Enforcement within the next two weeks. So you’ll shadow me for the first and I’ll show you the robes. It isn’t that hard Potter. Especially not after what you set up in Romania.”
Harry wanted to interrupt her and say that he wasn’t single, but she didn’t give him the space. And if she would have, she would have pressed him until he told her who it was, he was dating. And he wasn’t ready to tell her just yet. He needed to speak it through with Draco first.
“No, I can't. I already stayed longer than I intended to do, but I couldn't help it when I saw the state of your wardrobe. I have an early day tomorrow.”
Dan gets up, “Michael, switch with me. I want to get to know the date you promised me.” Dan flashes a wolfish smile.
He smiles to himself as the players bustle inside the common room. Ron spots Blaise sitting with the chess set and raises his eyebrow in challenge. Blaise mimics his look and smirks. Ronald starts toward him, when Potter grabs his arm. “Ron, you have to help me!”
Harry releases Draco’s cock, presses kisses on Draco’s thighs as he hoists his legs over his shoulders. Then murmurs something and continues on, making Draco moan and shiver. There’s been very little occupying Draco’s mind, but when he softly slips a wet finger between his cheeks before pressing into his hole, all clear thoughts really leave him. The only thing Draco can think is ‘Harry’ and how good this feels.
“Pansy and Greg starts snogging instead. Draco tries to get away from them and bumps into Theo instead.
him. Sure, Pansy made friends with Lavender Brown and the Patil sisters over their love for gossip. And Theo has found a study buddy in Granger. Greg, surprisingly, has been hanging out with Hufflepuffs. Trying to fill a Vincent shaped hole with Hufflepuff fluff and kindness. Draco however, not so surprisingly, hasn’t made any new friends.
“Well Pansy and Blaise were going on about how hot you and Greg look in quidditch robes. How that’s the best part of the quidditch. So, I wondered if that’s true and maybe I’ll finally enjoy quidditch too.”
“Come on Ron,” Granger says, grabbing the red redhead by his arm and pulling him along out of the room, “Malfoy’s probably right. We should talk to each other.”
“Do you need help getting over him? My offer still stands. I honestly think you’ve gotten even more handsome then you were before.”
“Pansy reminded me that I owe her a favour. I’ll take you to my tailor.” Malfoy’s eyes trail over Harry and he tries not to squirm under his scrutinizing gaze. “We’ll be able to make something of you yet.”
“I don’t feel like playing quidditch right now,” Greg continues. It sounds forced and Draco realises he’s trying to continue Pansy’s plan. Probably to get to whatever Pansy said in his ear.
“So, if you could please go away so we can get to it.” Draco says, slightly snickering at how red Weasley flushes.
Not Malfoy, Harry thinks to himself. But he can’t help look across the room at the person in question. Draco is talking enthusiastically with his friends. His hair is falling in his face and his tattoos almost seem to be brighter in the fairy lights that hang through the room.
“I’m going to take a piss.” Draco shakes himself free from Michael as he walks towards the toilets. He only stumbles into one table and a chair.
Within no time Harry has Draco a moaning mess beneath him. He’s slick with Harry’s saliva and open from his fingers. Maybe Harry should go away for a week more often if this are the consequences, Draco thinks to himself.
An hour and some floo powder stains later he arrives at the office, where auror Johnson is hovering over his desk. “Malfoy.” He says briskly, “I need you to go to the archives and research potion accidents over the last 5 years.”
Draco hears Harry coming down the stairs, back from the bathroom. As soon as he steps into the kitchen, Draco throws the paper at him. “What is this?” He sneers.
Michael looks from Draco to Harry and back again. “We hated each other at school,” Draco explains. “We haven’t seen each other since school. So 7 years?” Harry nods. “I honestly don’t know if we don’t hate each other still.”
“Where are you going?” Granger asks, and at this particular time Draco is glad for her inquisitiveness, because he’d like to know too. Though he’d probably go anywhere with Harry right now. “To our dorm.” Harry shrugs. He opens the door and pulls Draco along out onto the hallway.
They’ve been talking for a long time and the restaurant is almost empty when they get up to leave. Harry pays, but Draco makes sure to leave a big tip for the sweet waitress. Who smiles and waves at them when they leave?
“I’m,” Draco hesitates, can he really have a normal conversation with Harry Potter, the chosen one, the hero of the wizarding world and his school nemesis in a muggle bar. “I’m actually meeting someone.”
Maurice’s face lights up, “Thank you so much mister Potter. Draco told me you would be able to help me.”
Voldemort is walking up to Draco, his wand out, “Who’s going to safe you now, Draco?” Voldemort changes into Dumbledore, who changes into Lucius, who changes into Harry. “It wasn’t enough, Malfoy.” Dream Harry spits.
Harry doesn’t care and pushes them further on the bed, till Draco’s head is resting on the pillows. Harry kisses him softly, tenderly and Draco relaxes completely under Harry’s touch. His nails digging into Harry’s bum.
Harry looks down at the black suit that he found in the back of a closet. “It’s the only thing I could find.”
Pansy stills. “You told him you loved him. That’s huge! You never told that to anyone. Or have you ever?”
“Stop for now. Let’s just go for a butterbeer and study afterwards in the common room on the comfortable couch.”
But instead of kissing him, Draco pushes his hips forward. Potter gasps when their cocks rub against each other.”
Draco laughs, “How many do you own? Do I even want to know?” Draco thanks the waitress who gives him a glass of wine as well.
“Oh,” Pansy crawls on his lap, presses a kiss on his neck and whispers something in his ear. Draco sees Greg’s face light up.
“Why'd I have to break what I love so much? Please don’t walk away Harry, I love you. I do; I love you. Please just tell me that you're still mine, tell me that we'll be just fine even when I lose my mind. Tell me that it's not my fault, tell me that I'm all you want even when I break your heart.”
“I won’t end up with Ginny. I’ll never officially be a Weasley. And Ginny is not the one for me. Sure, I’d love it if my children go to Hogwarts together with ‘Moine’s if I ever have them. But I want them with you. I want it all with you.
“Okay follow me.” She seats them further at the back, away from the crowd. “What could I start you off with?”
Harry pulls him towards breakfast. They’re both barefoot in the kitchen and to Draco it feels like sacred new beginnings of something that will be the end of him.
“Fuck off Nott!” Blaise rolls his eyes. “Meet me in the library after Divination and before Potions I have a study period.”
Blaise looks at Theo, wondering whether he should feel relieved or guilty. In Theo’s eyes he can see the same question reflected.
Draco roughly pulls Harry in for a kiss, he can taste himself on Harry’s lips and it turns him impossibly more on. “For heaven’s sake. Why are you still wearing your clothes.” Draco grabs his wand that lay disregarded on the sheets and vanishes Harry’s clothes.
“Well because you ask so bluntly,” Draco rolls his eyes, but can’t help the smile that plays on his lips, “Why don´t you come over and join me?”
but Harry interrupts. “I know it’s a wizarding place and we both rather not go out in the wizarding world, but the restaurant is really great, and we can both use a glamour so nobody will know it’s us. And besides, it won’t be busy in the restaurant when we’re there, cause I was late with my reservation so we could only get a table at 4.”
Harry gapes at him for a minute, his mouth opening and closing like a fish. “I can’t talk to you when you’re like this Draco.”
When he finally found Draco, Harry couldn’t believe what he saw. Dan was pushing him up against the wall. Forcing his tongue down Draco’s throat.
Hermione and Avery exchange a look like they want to object, but Ron nods understandingly, “And it’s not Malfoy.” He says to his girlfriend.
“Git,” Ronald says, his complexion clearing and a smile spreading on his face. Just like Blaise hoped he would. “I’ll be having nightmares for years.”
“How do they even know this!” Harry throws the latest prophet on the dinner table next to where Draco’s reading his potions magazine. Draco glances over to read the headline.
“Yes,” Draco softly lets his fingers glide from Harry’s bum to his hair and pulls him in for a soft peck. The shape of his body is new. “You can move now.” Draco whispers.
Eventually Luna joins the conversation and starts talking about nargles of course. At that point Harry stops listening fully and looks for Draco in the crowd. He takes a few steps away from the two girls now deep in discussion in order to get a better look of the room. When someone places a hand on his waist and whispers in his ear, “It’s getting late. Want to share a taxi?”
Harry’s moving his body against Draco and with his left hand he pulls Draco against him. His other hand is trailing across stomach, making Draco shiver. Pleasure surges through Draco every time Harry moves his hips.
“And it looks like he’s going to hurl.” Blaise leans back over the passenger seat and scrunches his nose.
“It’s late darling. Should I go with you and settle you in before you go to bed. A good night’s sleep will do you good.”
“I’m sure everyone would like to snog Draco,” Pansy says, “but we can hardly all snog him. That won’t make the game anymore fun.”
When the common room door opens the happy couple at least stops kissing. Pansy turns around in Greg’s lap, her back pressed flush against his chest.
“I know I’m to blame, but I don’t want to do this to you. And I don’t want to lose this, with you.” Draco sighs, “It’s not your fault the papers write constantly about you and speculate about your love life. But I’m highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you. And I realise your ex is still your friend and I shouldn’t have said those things about her. I was mean and wrong and I’m sorry. But I’m so terrified that if you ever walk away, you’ll go back to her. That you’re going to leave me for her. And I can’t, Harry I can’t live with that.”
Malfoy smiles at his hands, “Yes well. I worked as a regular healer for a while, but quite a few people refused to let me work on them. So I started working more and more on the background at the potion’s lab of Mungo’s. But I liked the rush of being an active healer, so sometimes I got the work along on the emergency auror cases.” Malfoy shrugs, “they mind the least. When the position of master healer opened, they offered it to me. It’s not as active as I would like but I get to manage a team of healers who respect me and maybe I get to spring in and help in the emergency room every once in a while.” His eyes flick up to Harry’s. He looks hopeful, like he’s asking Harry.
“I- Colin Creevey’s camera. I got it from his brother Dennis yesterday at my birthday dinner at the Burrow.”
“Why? Why now? You hid me away for months. We didn’t even tell our friends, I told myself it was because of the papers, but we both know that’s a lie. And then you left.”
“Granger. Hermione,” Blaise looks at Hermione and she nods at him with a smile on her face. “Hermione wants Theo to play a quidditch games, so she can see how hot he looks in quidditch robes.”
They order a large pizza to share from the Italian place on the corner. When it arrives, Harry opens the door and pays the deliverer and Draco grabs a bottle of wine and glasses. It’s still a warm night and they settle on a couple of pillows that Draco keeps there for nights just like these. They eat their food and sip their wine as they stare at the night’s sky and the stars that slowly blink into view.
He pulls away so he can look at her face, though she’s blurry through his tears. He shakes his head, “But it wasn’t enough.”
Harry clears his throat; he needs to get out of this conversation. “Right, just come in on Monday and we’ll talk about it then.”
“Hey! Greg doesn’t look like that.” Pansy objects from the couch, her feet resting in Greg’s lap. “Greg looks more like he’s ready to pass out.”
“About auroring?” Harry asks amused, looking at Draco once more. For some reason Draco always looks his best at weddings. This time he's wearing a blue shirt with rolled up sleeves, to show off his tattoos. Which he only seems to do at weddings. White trousers that fit snugly over his leg and bottom and expensive looking loafers. His hair falls freely in his face, but he doesn’t bother brushing it out of his eyes. “Yes,” Draco says, “so I’ll leave you two to it.” Draco turns away and Harry can’t help that his eyes follow him across the room.
Ginny and Hermione laugh, but Luna is too focused on unwrapping the little box, when she opens it and pulls out the silver chain with an amethist stone hanging on it, she beams. “Oh it’s perfect thank you! This will keep the warspurts at bay Gin! And it fits perfectly with our wedding theme.”
Draco throws on a t-shirt and steps into a clean pear of boxers. He all but runs down the stairs and throws open the double doors. but Harry isn’t there. The kitchen and living room are dead. Autumn air blowing through the open windows.
“Sure. Sure.” Draco says, not really caring. He’s relishing how Harry’s hand feels holding his upper arm and the way his breath feels against his skin. Harry pulls away, and Draco immediately misses the warmth he radiates.
Draco clears his throat and wipes his own wet eyes with the back of his hand, “You said that the first time.”
The next two weeks went by fairly well. He thought about Draco constantly but that is to be expected. Though he tried his best to push it away. He went out with Ginny on two dates, just to see. On the second date she told him that they were throwing a party. When he asked why she told him; “To celebrate us getting back together of course, silly.” Yes, right. Silly. He hadn’t even realised that they’d gotten back together this quick.
“If Harry wants a date to the weddings, I know this guy who works on Diagon near George's shop. He’s nice and blonde.” Ron argues, “I can introduce you mate!” Ron says enthusiastically.
“How is McLaren doing by the way?” Harry asks changing the subject, acquiring after one of his injured aurors.
Draco turns around to put on the cattle, his hands are shaking, and his breathing is ragged. They haven’t fought like this since Hogwarts. And Draco didn’t mean to let it escalate to this extend. The article just rattled him more than he expected it would.
“No, what happened is you had a date without me. And what is stupid is that cheap, ginger, hobbit of a girl. Who probably only wants to sleep with you now that her pathetic quidditch career is over!”
As soon as they’re outside Harry warps his arms around Draco’s waist and apperates, taking them home. They land in the middle of their bedroom.
Harry breathes Draco’s name over and over into Draco’s neck. One of his hands sneaks down and wraps around Draco’s cock. After just a few strokes Draco comes undone. His eyes rolling back in his head and his fingers digging into Harry’s skin, Harry’s name on his lips. Harry gasps and stills as comes, his eyes locking with Draco´s. He presses a desperate kiss on Draco´s lip.
They pull a little bit apart and Ronald uses his free hand to cup Blaise’s face to pull him in for another kiss. Blaise can’t help but grin as he lets Ronald take the lead.
Draco hesitates on one hand he wants to take the potion and yell properly at Harry, until he begs Draco to take him back. On the other hand, he wants to throw the potion against the wall and make harry walk after him, begging for forgiveness. And he knows both are fantasies.
“They were, but he saved one especially for you.” A man Harry doesn't know says, as he steps next to Draco and places one of his hands on the small of Draco’s back. Harry glances from the hand to Draco's flushed face, back to the hand, to the intruder. “Maurice Blau,” He introduces himself and extends his hand to Harry. Harry takes his hand and shakes it, maybe a bit rougher than he should have, but he can't seem to care. “Harry Potter.” He introduces himself.
“You have no idea how bad I wanted to hear you say those words, but now. How – How can I trust what you say. I gave you everything I had and you,” Draco’s breath hitches, “You left me. When I was at my most vulnerable.”
“Who has nice hair?” Harry asks from behind Draco. Draco spins in his chair. How much of that had he heard.
Potter has been ignoring Draco ever since this school year started. In the summer, after his trails, Draco went to Potter to thank an apologises to him. Afterwards they even exchanged quite frequent letters. Friendly letters. But when they got back to Hogwarts it all stopped and Potter started ignoring Draco. Which never happened before, not even when they weren’t friendly. It drives Draco mad.
“Why would I do that? It’s true. She only wants you now because her quidditch team keeps losing, even the Canons are beating her horrible team. And she
Potter lunges forward and kisses him forcefully on his lips. Surprised Draco gasps. Potter pulls away as fast as he kissed him. They stare at each other for a second then they both move forward and kiss each other desperately.
“Well Ron’s older brother Charlie works and lives in Romania at a dragon sanctuary, so we went there and got a job. Ron loved it, but it wasn’t really for me.”
“Hell yeah!” Harry smiles and undoes Draco’s trousers and shoves them down, they gather around his ankles. Harry snickers and walks backwards to his bed, “Come on then!” Harry climbs into Draco’s bed and shuts the curtains.
Draco looks up wondering where Dan has gone, but glad non the less that he stopped forcing himself on Draco.
“What?! You can't throw them away.” Bemused Harry watches as Draco grabs his favourite shirt and looks at it disgustingly before putting it on the pile. “That's my favourite shirt!” Harry grabs it off the pile and holds it close to his chest.
“What?!’ Hot tea spills from his cup onto Draco’s lap. It burns a little but he ignores it, instead he stares at Harry.
Ron kept him up after work. He kept talking about how great it was that he and Ginny were getting back together. Harry just wanted to go to him, to Draco. He just wanted to go to his kitchen and cook a nice meal, while Draco sat at the kitchen table complaining about his work.
Blaise seems to be considering, he probably wonders what would be worse. “Dare.” He finally settles.
“We were. Then he left me after fucking me.” Draco downs his drink, “Literally not figuratively.” He waves at the waitress for another drink.
Draco moans and tilts his head a little to the side, Harry leans in and presses sloppy kisses along the length of Draco’s neck. When he finds
Draco snorts, “Potter was the star player. His team almost always beat mine and it was always his fault.” Draco pouts.
Greg carries Pansy to the dorms, “Good luck Blaise, Draco with your games. We’re going to play our own right now.” Pansy shouts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Told you everyone wanted to kiss your pretty face.” Pansy says, leaning over Blaise’s lap, who’s smirking cruelly at Draco.
“I’m leaving.” Theo says standing up. “I’m going to the library to hide from you crazy people. Hermione do you want to come along?”
Harry pulls of off Draco, “Right, you’re right.” He stands up and holds out his hand for Draco. Confused he takes it, and Harry pulls him to his feet and drags him across the circle.
“Godric this place is a mess.” A familiar voice says behind him. Draco turns around in his chair, “Potter?” he asks, “What are you doing here?”
“That’s what I do.” Malfoy smiles at Harry, his grey eyes sparkling, “But why Romania? Why not France or Italy.”
“No, they live back at home in Germany, but my parents immigrated to Germany after the first rise of Voldemort, and I’ve found that I feel more at home with English people. And now that I’m looking for a partner to settle down with, I have this feeling that I need to find him in England.”
Harry pushes another finger and Draco breaks the kiss as he pushes his head into the pillows. “You Okay with this?” Harry whispers in his ear.
Draco spends the rest of the day on Greg’s and Pansy’s couch. She forces him to eat something but mostly just holds him.
Harry nods curtly, but doesn't bother to elaborate with words. Why would he? He looks Maurice over once more, expensive designer suit. Muggle surprisingly. But still, he seems very pretentious.
“So,” Draco raises his eyebrows, Harry looks at him confused. “I guess all the rumours are true.” Draco grins. “You’re my lover.”
They pull apart slightly. Draco stares into Potter’s bright green eyes, lust gleaming in them, his glasses askew on his face. “Now you’re not glaring.” Potter says ruining the moment.
Theo and Hermione settled at a table in the secluded aria of the library. They’ve finished their arithmancy homework and are now quietly discussing which material they’ll need to study for their N.E.W.T.S exam.
“Among other things.” Harry grabs Draco’s hips and pulls him against him. “There’s only one thing that makes me doubt.”
“I know,” Draco smiles. “Remember Dominique’s face when he saw you for the first time. It was spectacular.”
“Yes,” Draco smiles to himself. Harry was right, Draco loves to be cuddled. Draco relishes in attention, and he knows it. The heath of Harry’s embrace, the afterglow of the amazing sex, lulls Draco into sleep.
“You can be as active as you want to Malfoy,” Harry says, keeping Draco’s gaze, “As long as you save my aurors.” It sounds weird to say that, but it also forms a warm proud feeling in his belly.
Draco ignores Dan who saunters away. He blinks at Harry, “Why are you here, Harry? Why do you care? You left me. You broke my heart.” Draco says thinking of Pansy’s words.
When they've finished eating Harry vanishes the empty packages and takes the empty plates with the cutlery down to the kitchen. When he comes back Draco has grabbed a bag and takes out various polos in shades of green and blue. “Try these on he says without looking at Harry.”
“Good. Now that we’ve established that. I think it might be good for you two to have a conversation. Malfoy can fill you in on what he does and it’s never too early to start a good working relationship.” Robards says.
“I do not have affections for any part of the Golden Trio.” Draco denies with his pointy nose up in the air.
“Really Potter?!” Draco says angrily. “When there's a madman living in your house threatening to kill your parents if you don't do what he asks of you then talk to me about choices.”
He went back to the office, but he didn’t get any work done. He couldn’t concentrate. Ginny’s words circled through his mind. Hers and Ron’s and Hermione’s and Mrs. Weasleys. And all the other Weasley’s who supported their relationship in the past. Even Fred. Though all he could see when he closed his eyes was Draco’s sleepy face looking up at him, his eyes sparkling and his lips pink. His hair mussed, like it only was in bed. Only Harry ever saw him like this, and he loved that. He loved that Draco let himself be seen like this only with Harry around. And Draco was so gorgeous, but when he was like that, sleep ruffled in Harry arms he was the most beautiful.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He doesn't even get halfway before Harry pulls him over presses their lips together. Harry kisses him eagerly his hands roaming over Draco’s body, trying to touch everything at once.
Weasley walks up to the table and the two big blokes bend over the tiny table inspecting the tiny pieces.
Harry drags Draco through the common room and up to the dorm. As soon as the door closes behind them Harry pushes him against the door. “I’ve been wanting to do this since Halloween. You looked so good in those blue robes.” Harry leans in and kisses him desperately, his hands braced on either side of Draco’s head against the door.
“Oh, come on Draco. I didn’t mean it like that.” Dan cups Draco’s face with a hand, “It’s just Michael promised me a good time. He told me you’re the type of guy who goes home with a man every now and then. And I mean, you’re hot. I’m hot. Let’s just have some fun.” Dan tries to pull Draco’s face closer.
Millicent looks around the circle, “Definitely Potter. He’s wearing little so you can see everything that’s going on.” Millicent smirks, Harry frowns and Draco chugs his drink. “And… Draco.” Gasps sound through the circle.
Not even half an hour later Weasley gets up with lots of noise. Everyone in the library looks up and at him. He doesn’t even flinch, but Hermione does. Weasley cups her face and presses a sloppy kiss on her lips, then stalks off. Theo rolls his eyes, why does Weasley feel the need to mark of his territory so? He really doesn’t need to worry with a girlfriend like Hermione.
“We’ve really been away too long, haven’t we mate?” Ron says as he hands Harry a bottle of cold beer. Harry nods, his eyes not leaving Draco Malfoy, as Ron continues. “I mean I don’t understand how they can be friends with the ferret.” Right as he says that Hermione looks up and spots them. Malfoy also looks their way, his and Harry’s eyes meet and Harry hurriedly looks away. Hermione says something to Malfoy who nods at her with his dazzling smile. Hermione walks away from him and bounces up to Harry and Ron. She throws her arms around Harry’s neck first and then around Ron’s. “I’m so glad you are back!” She exclaims, “When did your portkey get in?”
They slip on either side of Draco and the blond actually glances to either of them, taking his eyes off off Potter. “What do you two want?”
Draco’s look turns dark, “I’m not a fool Blaise. You’re just trying to get a rise out of me and I’m not playing along.” He stands up.
“Then Blaise will do his charm thing and ask Potter to entertain Draco if he doesn’t do alone. Potter will sputter and Draco,” she fixes Draco with one on her looks, “You will get up and ask
So, he told her he needed to think about it. Like the idiot he is. She seemed content about it and the rest of the lunch she rambled on about quidditch. The new techniques she was practising, her teammates. Her wins and her losses. On and on it went. Harry did really like the game, but even he had his limits. Him and Draco always had discussions about quidditch since they both supported different teams, but that always ended in snogging sessions, not in Harry wanting to slam his head repeatedly on the table.
“Well actually,” Hermione steps closer, “I guess I can tell you guys now, since you are back and maybe you can even give me some advice Ron.”
“I told him I loved him. I love him Pansy. And he still left me. He left me!” His hair sticks to his tearstained face.
Harry pulls something out of his pocket and with a quick engorgio enlarges it to his normal size. It’s a carton box. “What is it?” Draco asks.
Blaise shrugs to himself when Draco’s ready to share, he will. And turns his attention back to the chessboard, Ronald orders his knight to a different position.
Harry pushes him to the side and rushes inside. He slams the door shut. “Sorry ‘bout that, but I think a reporter was following me.”
His heart ached as he untangled himself from Draco and placed his head carefully on a pillow. “Harry,” Draco mumbled a slight smile on his lip. It is probably better for him that Harry leaves him now, it’ll hurt him less if he does it now.
Theo sighs and pulls his Transfiguration essay in front of him again. And he tries not to stare at Hermione. Normally, when it’s just the two of them, he’s pretty good at that. But with Weasley sitting there it’s hard not to. His eyes keep trailing back to the couple.
The sandwich is doable, but Draco had much rather gone to the teashop tugged between two large muggle coffeeshops just a few streets away from the ministry. He could kill for one of their herbal blends teas right about now. It always seemed to ease his muscle aches and right now his back is killing him. Bend over a low table while sitting on a chair that was missing one of its legs it shouldn´t be surprising. Maybe he could take a long bath once he got home, that might help with some other aches as well, Draco thought to himself.
"Every time I have a chance with Ronald, Potter shows up and demands all his attention. whining about some blond git."
“I thought Gryffindors were brave. Never expected you would refuse to complete a simple bet. But if you’re really afraid of a kiss.” Blaise shrugs, faking nonchalance, but his heart is beating fast in his chest. He’s been thinking about kissing him for so long and now that he’s so close, he doesn’t know how he’ll take it when Ronald turns away.
“That we really are great friends, but nothing more.” Ronald’s smiling brightly at Blaise. “We’ve both known it for a while now, but it just took a chess game for me to really realise it.”
Draco smiles brightly, this is turning into his best birthday yet. “What kind of restaurant?” Draco asks curiously.
“I reckon I could fit in these robes. But then you’ll have to take them off first.” Blaise says smirking.
Draco follows Harry down a narrow street. “Where are you taking me Potter? Should I be worried?” Draco asks not able to hide the humour from his voice.
“Yes, it is.” The waitress is back at their table and hands Draco the wine list with a smirk. “Tonight’s chef’s special is a roasted duck breast with a blackberry and wine sauce and a salad and roasted potatoes on the side.”
“I know! Merlin, I know. But if you had the chance to save them wouldn't you have done everything in your power to do so?”  Draco blinks rapidly.
“I know who can help you with that.” Pansy says. Before Harry gets to ask who the tent hushes and the wedding ceremony starts.
Theo waits near the entrance of the library for Blaise. When he spots the tall guy, he urges him to follow him a bit further into the library.
Hermione´s pressed against Theo’s side, they’re going over their history of magic notes, listening to the rain clattering on the windows.  The common room is empty, most of the eight years are playing a friendly quidditch game or looking on.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“You have no idea.” Harry whispers in his ear as he turns Draco around and pulls of Draco’s jacket and sweater at the same time. His hands skimming Draco’s sides his lips sucking the sensitive skin on Draco’s neck. “I’ve missed you so much. That mission took way too long.”
Once in their dorm door closes behind them, Harry pushes Draco against it and kisses him deeply. Draco groans deeply and melts into his touch. They stumble towards Harry’s bed, shoving off their shoes and pulling of their sweaters as the go along.
When they step out of the floo in the stuffy and dusty living room of Grimmauld Place Ron turns to Harry. “You better not tell Hermione that you’re other relationship was with Charlie and most of your one night stands were with blonds blokes.”
“You can’t just dare me to do things, the game’s called truth or dare.” Longbottom says, already standing up.
“That’s a birthday cake.” When Draco doesn’t say anything but stare Harry pipes up again, “It’s chocolate, your favourite. Do you like it?”
Draco spots Dan clutching his face just a few paces away. “What the fuck?” He shouts. At who, Draco doesn’t know.
“Hey,” Draco has never seen Blaise this uncomfortable. Blaise is an impossible handsome guy, with flawless dark skin, broad shoulders, big hands and a jaw that could cut paper. He could get anyone he wanted, but he settled his sight on a Weasley the most stubborn of wizards. And he picked the Weasley who probably hadn’t even considered all the possibilities of his sexuality. Making it impossibly hard on himself.
Pansy and Blaise step through the door, shedding their coats and gloves. “How was the game?” Hermione asks them, not moving away from her position at Theo’s side. It makes his chest flutter.
. To hell what his friends say. Ginny isn’t the one he’s supposed to be with. The one meant for him is standing right in front of him twirling a potion bottle between his long fingers, a pout on his handsome face. His hair perfectly styled. He sees it now.
She pokes a finger at his chest, “You’re going to do your auroring and find him. Right now! Or I’m going to tell your new old girlfriend and your so-called friends what you’ve done to my best friend.”
Harry laughs breathlessly and removes his fingers. He whispers a wandless lubricant spell and slicks his cock up with his now wet fingers. He adjusts Draco’s legs around his waist and positions himself. Slowly Harry pushes in. Draco digs his nails in against the slight burn.
Theo opens his mouth to object, but the door opens quicker and the quidditch players walk in. most of them hurry up tot the stairs going to dormitories, leaving a trail of water in their wake. Weasley and Greg walk up to the couch.
“Yes, it was,” Harry agrees. He had to blink back his tears several times. Ginny and Luna had written their own vows and they brought most people to clutching their loved ones. Harry of course hadn´t had a loved one to clutch, still he was moved. It almost made him want to start working less to make time for dates. “Thanks” he says just before he takes a sip of the cool champagne. He needed this. He was becomming hot in his suit.
“Isn’t that kind of the same?” Pansy looks like she’s putting two and two together and Draco’s eager to get away.
“McLaren?” Theo steps next to Harry smiling at both him and Malfoy. “I spoke to him once at the leaky. Millie knows him from work, she’s a receptionist at the ministry as you probably know. And all he talked about was his son’s toad.” Theo snickers to himself. “But how are you guys doing? The only single ones left.”
“Come in!” he hears Robards say from the inside and he pushes the door open. “Aah Harry there you are. Good morning, I hope you had a pleasant trip back to jolly old England.” Robards says.
“At that point Blaise will propose a chess game with his new special chess set.” Yesterday after, what Draco now describes as the worst breakfast ever, they went to Hogsmeade and Blaise bought a really old chess set. Draco bought a light blue sweater that brings out his eyes.
They all take a pint and follow Michael to a corner table, where there’s more light and the music is less loud.
“Uhm, well, we’ve mostly been studying,” Granger stammers, and Theo tries to hide his crimson face behind his glass. “But we’ve not only been studying.” She glances from Theo beside her to the other side of the circle where Weasley sits next to Potter and Finnigan. Who, in his turn stares down into his glass instead of meeting her gaze.
“Well then Head auror Potter, you better have brought an expensive birthday gift for my girlfriend. Both of you! For the three you boys have missed.” Ginny smirks.
Moreover, Draco Malfoy isn’t wearing wizarding clothes. Nothing at all even similar to the robes Harry thought the pureblood would prefer the wear. Instead Draco Malfoy wears a pair of dark blue loafers, a pair of dark blue skinny jeans that do amazing things for his long legs and pert bottom, and a white button down shirt. The buttons of the shirt are undone at the top, showing off the pale skin of his throat, neck and even the top of his chest. Harry can see the light reflect on the thin silver lines of scars there. The sleeves of the shirt are rolled up showing off strong forearms. His left arm seems to be covered in bright colourful tattoos. And even though Harry tries he can’t see what they are and if the dark mark is still visible.
Harry pulls his hand from behind his back. In it he held a steaming to go cup from the teashop Draco had been dreaming about just minutes ago, “One hot herbal blend tea and,” Harry shows Draco his other hand in which he holds a small white paper bag, “A still warm pain chocolat.”
“Why would I ask for your floo address if I wasn’t going to use it?” Draco crosses his arms over his chest and looks at Harry like this is obvious. Then turns back to the pile of Harry’s clothes closes to him and starts sorting it out.
Suddenly Draco can’t breathe. He needs to get away from this. From these feelings that are threatening to bubble over. He drags a hand over his face, it comes back wet. He didn’t even realise the tears started flowing out.
Draco stares in horror as the trail is near the elastic band of Harry’s boxers and slowly seeping lower.
“Don’t be a wuss Harry,” Granger says grabbing Theo’s arm. “We’re off to the library.” She pulls Theo behind her off through the door.
Theo glances around. People are milling about the entrance, some going in others going out. This doesn’t seem like the ideal spot for this conversation, so he proposes to go somewhere a bit more private.
When they've gone through all the bags and Draco finally gives into Harry's complaining, Harry lets himself fall on the couch with a moan of agony. “That was the worst two hours of my life!” He complains.
“Why?” Harry walks up to Draco, “Let me tell you a story to explain. I walked into a muggle bar with a new friend who told me he needed someone to set up with his best friend. Because his best friend had a new hot friend he really wanted to meet. So of course, good friend that I am, I went with him. Low and behold I ended up in the hot friends bed. And listen, this is really important.” Harry gives him a serious look, and Draco can’t help but smirk at his look. “The guy was really hot.” Draco laughs.
“I need some air.” Draco rushes past his friends, out of the house. Ignoring Pansy who calls after him to wait.
In the chair next to him Malfoy snorts, but when Harry looks at him he doesn’t look back and doesn’t say anything more.
that I would wake up confused and upset. Exactly like you promised you would never do. You promised. The very first night you slept with me. That’s is really the thing I can’t understand. Why? Why did you sleep with me?”
Harry clutches his glass close to his chest. He feels out of place at Pansy’s and Greg’s engagement’s party. It’s still weird that he considers them friends now he has known for a while now that Hermione’s close to Pansy, but he still hadn’t expected to be invited to this party. Not after what happened with Draco.
Pansy and the Patil twins find places in the circle as Lavender slowly glances around the room, looking for a victim. “Hermione!”
“Huh,” Ron looks from Harry back to his girlfriend and back at Harry again. “But he was talking to Malfoy. What were you talking about?”
For the first time, Harry walked away from a fight with Draco Malfoy. The words he spoke had placed doubts in his mind. Was he going to leave Draco to be with Ginny? Everyone who knows him best says so. Are they right and is he just as oblivious as the all always tell him he is? And if he is should he leave right now, before he hurts Draco even more? But he loved Draco. He did, didn’t he?
“You know what Draco? Fuck you!” Harry interrupts Draco’s rant and storms out of the kitchen, slamming the door behind him.
Harry laughs and flicks his hand over their bodies. Draco feels a soft sensation of a cleaning charm.
Draco pulls back but he tumbles of the bench. Someone catches him before he hits the ground and pulls him to his feet. “Dan, you’re drunk. Leave Malfoy alone.” Potter says, his arm still wrapped around his waist.
will go shopping otherwise you’ll just buy the same shirts again.” With one last sneaky look and a wave Draco walks away from Harry to the other side of the room.
Harry kisses him. It tastes salty, Draco realises it’s because of his tears. Harry pulls of Draco’s shirt and tugs him towards the bed, their lips not parting. Once they reach the bed, Harry turns Draco around. He undoes his trousers and pulls it and his pants down at once. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry Draco,” whispers in his ear.
He´s made his way through 4 boxes when Draco decides to take a break and eat his sandwich. He still has a lot more boxes, shelves even, to go, but if the aurors wanted their information faster they shouldn´t have send him alone he muses.
Harry starts to take of his clothes. His tan skin covers smooth muscles, a few scars are scattered across his body. Draco wishes he could study them up close, but he can hardly crawl across the floor and start studying his body.
“Darling, I know it’s hard. But facing it is the best way to get over him. And you will get over it and before you know it, you’ll be moving on with someone else.”
“Trivial?” Draco places his empty champagne glass on the high top table next to them and crosses his arms sternly over each other, “Shopping for clothes is never trivial. Especially when you help such a hopeless case as you, Potter.” Draco smirks mischievously when he snaps Harry’s last name like he used to when they were kids.
With a curt nod Draco continues to sort through his pile, separating some of Harry's newer hoodies and vanishing the rest. He accios a new pile, jeans this time, when he says softly, “I'm sorry.” He glances through his lashes at Harry, grey eyes sparkling with tears he didn't let out, “for being such a little prick when I was younger.”
“Yes, I want this.” Draco takes Harry’s face into his hands and kisses him slowly. “Are you sure too?”
Draco slips his hands under Harry’s shirt, his nails dragging over his back. “Bedroom?” Harry breathes. Draco grabs his wrist and pulls him up the stairs to the bedroom of Draco’s new 2 floor apartment. The first floor exists of a small hallway with double doors that lead to an open plan kitchen and living space and a staircase that leads to a big bedroom with in suite.
For someone so smart and well spoken. When he gets nervous it amazes Draco that he can’t speak at all. But it seems to amuse Granger, because she smiles softly. “I’ll just grab my books. The we can go to the library. I was thinking we should try and search in the charm section for another angle.”
Theo flushes, his light complexion makes him look as red as a strawberry. ‘I- Not that, but I-” he stammers, “I would like to get to know Hermione better. More than just a friendship, yes.”
Theo realises he’s been looking too long when Hermione meets his eyes over the tables and flushes. Theo quickly looks back to his essay.
When he walks back out of the toilet, he immediately bumps into Dan. It’s like he’s been waiting on him. “Michael told me you were here.” Dan brushes his hand over Draco’s cheek. “He also told me something else.”
“Well that’s too bad. I was really looking forward to go out on the pitch.” Draco says just to satisfy her.
“Have you made a career switch we don’t know about ‘Mione?” Ron asks, “Are you a wedding planner now.”
Draco pushes the bedroom door open with his foot. His lips not leaving Harry’s, his hands busy pushing Harry’s jacket from his shoulders. Harry finger at Draco’s button down, but when they don’t butch he just rips the shirt open. Draco gasp, “That was one of my favourite shirts, you barbarian.”
The last thing that Draco things before he falls asleep is that he hopes he never loses Harry. Hopes this never ends. Because that’s the kind of heartbreak time could never mend.
“You bought this much because we need to replace your entire wardrobe,” Draco says as he looks confused at a very old pair of Dudley’s joggers before vanishing them with a huff, “And I went to Dominique today on my day off to pick all the items you would need. I just placed it on your account.”
Blaise brushes his lips against Ronald’s, over his cheek to his ear. “I won our little bet.” He presses a soft kiss behind his ear before pulling away completely.
“I- yes.” Theo’s afraid Blaise is not going to agree to help him with this plan, but then his face breaks into a big smile, flashing his bright white teeth. “I’m in.”
His arms give out and he collapses onto Draco. Both of them breathing hard. “That was,” Harry rolls off Draco and falls on the sheets next to him, “Merlin that was amazing.” He grabs Draco’s hand, “You were amazing.”
Harry stalks him in his dreams, his thoughts when he can’t find sleep, his daydreams during classes and all the meals. He’s even gone to calling him Harry in his mind. It needs to stop, but as Draco glances at Harry when he laughs at something Weasley says he can’t help the way his heart stutters and how he wants these feelings to never end. The way Harry’s eyes light up. The way he throws his head back, his unkept hair falling back and forth. His hands wrapped around his glass.
“See Ron’s busy. I’m busy Malfoy wants to play quidditch and you’re not doing anything.” Granger says. “Unless you rather study?”
Draco just shrugs. He can’t tell them that the mention of Harry’s last name sends him right back to waking up alone in their bed. With his smell still lingering and his touch still ghosting on his skin.
“Ron and I wanted to get away from England for a while. Ron because he and Hermione broke up and I, well, because of everything really.” Harry laughs.
Draco’s unsure of what to do with his hands, but when he grazes his hands against Harry’s back, he hears approving sounds. Encouraged he grabs hold of Harry more forcefully. This seems to encourage Harry as well cause pushes his hips against Draco’s. As Harry’s hard on rubs against Draco’s he gasps and bumps his head against the door.
“No. I’m not marrying Draco, Ronald.” Hermione says shushing Ron, “And don’t call him that! I was just asking him if he could help me pick out an engagement ring for Pansy.”
The chosen one. How could he ever think he could be with him? And then she would tell Granger, who would tell Harry, which would make everything worse. So, he says nothing. He just let’s her hold him as his tears roll down his cheeks freely.
Hermione rolls her eyes. “Oh and Harry. Oliver is getting married, so you might be want to go to that wedding.”
Harry pulls away from his neck and places his forehead against Draco’s. For a moment they just sit there and breathe each other’s air.
The suit, Harry had almost forgotten he needed one for his duties as best man at Ginny and Luna's wedding. “Thanks Malfoy. I appreciate it.”
Merlin, Weasley seems to be licking Hermione’s neck. Theo’s stomach flips uncomfortably. Weasley should just go and do that to Blaise. He would probably melt into Weasley’s arms the way he hoped Hermione would do. Instead Hermione pulls away and says something under her breath, her face flush and angry. Weasley mumbles something and begrudgingly turns back to his studies.
When they finally pull apart Draco´s sure his hair´s a mess and there´s a bruise on his neck where here kissed him a bit too roughly. “I need to get back,” Harry mummers, “I´m quite sure I spend at least most of my break finding you in this maze of files.”
“Yeah, Draco’s mum showed up during the ceremony ad Draco demanded she’d make wedding pictures like the ones he’d seen in his parents wedding album.”
As Draco bows down to untie his shoes, Harry’s pants land next to him. Now Draco stumbles in his haste to get out of his shoes, trousers and pants. But when he finally does, he pulls open the curtains and climbs into the bed.
While Blaise hasn’t been able to keep his mind of off Weasley since Halloween, Draco in his turn hasn’t been able to keep his mind of off Potter. Well, maybe since ever. But it took a turn for the worse after Halloween. Potter had been dressed in tight pants and a fitted shirt with buttons undone at the top. Draco really hadn’t known what he was dressed at, but he couldn’t stop staring. And unlike Blaise, Draco knows that Potter has been single since before Halloween. Which did even worse things for his thoughts, both during the day or at night.
!” Draco gasps and moans. Harry smiles wickedly as he his releases Draco once more, and crawls on top of him. “Merlin Draco,” Harry rubs his nose against Draco’s, “You really are gorgeous.”
Harry thought about storming off. However, he knew that Draco never thought Dan attractive and Harry glanced back against the pair by the wall. Now that he looked closer it seemed that Dan was literally forcing himself on Draco.
Draco grabs a pair of trousers and shoes, and he tries to ignore the fact that the closet is half empty. He dresses himself and tries to stop himself from crying. Once he’s dressed, he stumbles to the floo.
Draco, clearly very pissed, blinked at him. Eventually Harry got Draco away from Dan and gave him the spare hangover potion he’s been keeping in his coat pocket.
“You mean, we’re both fucking hilarious.” Pansy says as she wraps her arms around Hermione’s middle and presses a kiss on her girlfriends cheek. Harry laughs.
Draco knows that if he’d look over to his friend, he’d see a blush on his cheeks, even through his dark complexion. But Draco doesn’t dare glance that way, because Harry’s fingers started moving over his leg and Draco’ll need on all his concentration to keep a straight face and not to make any strange noises.
“We could change that,” Padma Patil says, “I’ll snog Draco if you dare me to.” She glances shyly at Draco and Harry’s hand tightens around Draco’s thigh. Or is that just his imagination?
When Harry isn’t busy catching dark wizards or hanging out with his friends, he spends his time in Draco’s apartment. Every time he comes, he brings bags with foods and spends his time in Draco’s kitchen. He always ends up making something delicious dinners and way too much. Draco always eats the leftovers the nights Harry doesn’t show.
Draco rolls on his side to face Harry, he’s unsure whether Harry plans on staying over. Was this an one off for him? Draco can’t imagine Harry plans on this being anything more than physical. Draco shivers when a cold gust of air brushes his skin. Harry grabs the sheets and pulls them over their bodies. It’s as if he can sense Draco’s insecurities, because he opens his arms, “Come here. I know you secretly love to cuddle.”
Draco takes a step back; his hands are shaking. His eyes flick over the rest of the bathroom. There are no towels on the floor, which normally he would be glad about, but now it just means that Harry isn’t here. The laundry basket is almost empty, he doesn’t see the usual red of the auror robes. And then he sees the cup where they leave their toothbrushes. There’s only one. And somehow that makes it all too real.
